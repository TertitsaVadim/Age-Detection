I read quite a fewdiscussion boards and find that when someone is looking for a specializedmedical cable that the replies usually tell them to call Belden or Alpha. Thereis nothing wrong with Alpha or Belden however, keep in mind they mass producegeneric wire and cable that covers a wide variety of uses and may not meet allyour needs.If you wanted to race in the Daytona 500, would you go to your neighborhood cardealer and buy a generic automobile to race? Of course not, you would build acustom car with the performance to handle the racetrack conditions, the type ofrace and your driving style. The same applies to medical cables, Yourrequirements are specific to your application which may include size, numberand type of conductors, bio-compatibility, sterilization techniques oreven a custom colored jacket.  Custom medical cables are designed specifically for yourrequirements and type of use.
<br />Often for new designs and products,a small quantity is needed for prototypes, proof of concept or testing. Custommedical cable manufacturers understand this and normally have the capabilities to manufacture small runs of customwire and cable. If your medical cable design is simple, ask your custom cablemanufacture if they have any sample stock or over runs in stock that match yourcable requirements.
<br />Get the right cable for your medicaldevice by contacting a medical cable manufacturer and discussing your needs andapplication. The more the cable manufacturer knows about your needs the betteryour design will be suited for you.
<br />What to tell your custommedical cable manufacturer:
<br /><br />Type of use     – How the medical device will be used, the environment, will the cable be     subjected to repetitive flexing, high temperatures or abrasion?
<br />    Sterilization – Is     the cable reusable or disposable? Will the cable be sterilized? If so how and how many cycles.
<br />    Patient contact     – What bio-compatibility requirements are needed? Explain the extent of     patient contact with the wire or cable.
<br />    Mechanical requirements – Voltage, temperature, flex cycles and EMI     shielding. Will the cable experience repeated bending or twisting motion?
<br />    Physical requirements     – The number of conductors, size, plating, cable construction, shape and     overall diameter.
<br />    Expectations     – Discuss what you want for performance and product longevity. Do you     expect product lifetime to be 6 months or 6 years?

It isn't recommended to use standard/ generic wire and cable in your medical device design unless the wire or cable doesn't need to meet any medical requirements or is used internally in your device. Every industry has it's unique requirements when it comes to wire and cable. The medical industry is no exception. Medical wire and cable is readily available &quot;off the shelf&quot; however, many medical industry engineers turn to custom medical cables due to their application's unique requirements. What makes medical wire and cable different? Medical devices are designed to be precise whether it is for diagnostics, patient monitoring, surgical or provides imaging/video. Medical device cables may need to provide multiple functions with just one cable such as, data, power fluids or air. Medical cables can be complex or a simple design, in either case custom medical device cables offer the performance and longevity needed for this type of application.
<br /><br />Another unique feature of medical device cables is the insulation and jacket compounds are formulated to meet the specific requirements of medical applications such as:
<br /><br />Sterilization - Sterilization techniques      include autoclave, E-beam, chemicals to name a few. What insulation and      jacket materials can withstand do vary and it is important to take this      into consideration when designing your medical device. Sterilization properties chart is a helpful      tool, but discussing your requirements with a custom medical cable      manufacturer can save you research time.
<br />    Bio-compatibility -      Patient contact is another requirement for medical device cable. Contact      can be from exterior to implantable. Medical wire and cable jacket      compounds are available in many grades and the extent of patient contact      should be discussed with your medical cable manufacturer.
<br /><br />Disposable or reusable?
<br /><br />Disposable cables are normally used for a limited usage and do not undergo repeated sterilization before being disposed. Disposable wire and cable are made of less expensive materials such as PVC. Reusable medical cables normally have to withstand anywhere from hundreds to over a thousand sterilization cycles.
<br /><br />Medical device wire
<br /><br />Medical device lead wires can also differ from generic wire. Sensors and monitoring devices are becoming smaller, wireless and their functions are more complex. Patient monitoring devices often require lightweight, small gauge, ultra flexible wire for patient comfort while being monitored. Patient monitoring devices are sometimes worn for long periods or even implanted. The need for small extremely flexible wire is becoming more evident with these types of medical applications.
<br /><br />A few examples of long term patient monitoring include:
<br /><br />Fetal monitoring devices - Fetal monitors can be wired to a receiver or      wireless for extended monitoring. The monitor is connected to a unit which      sends information to a receiver allowing the patient to move freely. Small      gauge very flexible wire and cable is used for this type of product.
<br /><br />Sleep monitors      - Patient comfort is important with this type of device. The ultra      flexible wire need to be lightweight and a small gauge using flexible      insulating materials such as TPE or silicone.
<br /><br />Heart monitors      - This type of long term device normally uses cables instead of lead      wires. Heart monitor devices can be connected to an implant then to a      battery/power pack or sending unit which sends information to a      receiver/recorder. Cables may be required to send data, supply power,      be flexible and be resistant to abrasion and cleaning solutions. Other      types of heart monitors may be connected to sensors externally on the body      for extended periods.
<br /><br />When considering your medical device wire and cable for your product be sure to speak with a custom medical cable manufacturer to find out what materials and construction will work best for your device.

In that respect, it is already quite obvious to see why functional, effective, and reliable medical cables are an absolute necessity for an evermore technology-dependent medical field.
<br />There are many different types of medical cables that are needed during everyday medical practices- a medical wire that connects a medical ventilator to a power source or something as simple as a medical cable that connects a specialized printer to print out custom patient reports and the like.
<br />However, these days, the medical technologies used to treat patients have become more advanced as well as highly customized, which means that the computerized apparatus that are currently being used to treat patients need to be created from parts that have been specialized for certain procedures and applications.
<br />Take, for example, MRI machines. Although the basic function of MRI machines are the same- to visualize internal bodily structures using a medical imaging technique- there now exist needs to tweak an MRI machine to make it capable of taking more specialized images for internal bodily structures. In order to do this, however, specialized medical cables are needed.
<br />Just like a specialized MRI machine, there are, and will be, many medical devices that are needed for more and more specialized reasons, calling for the need for customized parts, especially cables. This is because medical cables are what powers the machines and relays information from one part of the machine to the other.
<br />Medical cables can be composed of so many different materials such as cadmium copper, beryllium copper, and carbon fiber. But each type of material has very specific strengths and weaknesses. For example, carbon fiber has the property of being almost invisible with MRIs and other medical imaging procedures as well as the property of being radio translucent, making them the near perfect material with which to make EKG leads or wiring in defibrillators.
<br />The complexity and variety of medical cables necessitates the need for specialists who are highly capable of creating effective and trustworthy custom medical cables. Not only does the complexity and variety of medical cables dictate a need for specialist, but the fact that a good amount of medical environments need sterilized medical devices shows that medical cables need to be made by trained and trusted specialists.
<br />There are custom medical cable specialists who can help figure out how to develop medical cables according to virtually any specification. These cable specialists can help create custom cables and wiring for medical devices such as devices used during surgery and even specialized devices such as laser eye surgery devices and tools.

<br />Why would anyone need custom wire?  Wire is constructed differently, it is important to use a wire that was made for your type of application. There are many reasons people turn to custom wire. Custom wire can be manufactured to meet specific requirements such as, high voltage, extreme temperatures, high flex cycles and improved flexibility to name a few.
<br /><br />Three of the most common reasons people turn to custom hook up and lead wire are:
<br />•	“My existing wire keeps breaking.” Wires that break and fail are usually not designed to be repeatedly flexed or bent. High flex custom wire is normally made with high strand count conductors and sometimes with alloys. Hook up and lead wires that are off the shelf are normally available in solid core, 7 or 19 strand. This wire is intended for static installations where the wire is not required to move once it is installed and is not intended for repetitive movement and high flex applications. As the fine strands break loss of conductivity and complete failure will occur. High strand count conductors will withstand this type of environment due to the construction and number of strands. High strand count wire can sometimes be purchased off the shelf, but in most cases need to be purchased from a custom wire and cable manufacturer. Custom lead wires can be manufactured with the application in mind using materials intended to withstand movement such as robotic /automation, handheld devices, and other applications.
<br />•	“I need a more flexible wire for my project.” Ultra flexible wires are are manufactured using very high strand count conductors and flexible insulation and jacket materials which are hard to find ready-made and off the shelf. Custom wire and cable manufactures specializing in super flexible wire and cable can assist you with your flexibility requirements. There are several types of insulation that can be used to make a wire extremely flexible. Silicone insulated wires are probably the most flexible wire available together with high strand count conductors the wire can be extremely limp even described as “noodle wire” even in the larger gauge sizes. 
<br />•	“I can’t find the wire I need anywhere.”  This is usually the case when a small gauge wire is needed, retrofitting and repairs, or a wire becomes obsolete.  Wire gauges smaller than 30AWG can be difficult to find off the shelf, turning to a custom wire manufacturer that works with small gauges is usually the only option. Custom wire can be made smaller than 50AWG by some custom wire manufacturers.  Often we have requests for hookup wire and cables for equipment that needs to be repaired, updated, or overhauled. This type of situation the existing wire can’t be identified or the existing wire needs to have improved performance. Custom cable manufacturers can reverse engineer existing wire and suggest better construction or materials to achieve the improved performance and longevity of the wire.
<br />Contact a custom wire and cable manufacturer to find out if a custom wire is needed for your application. Starting out with the right wire will save time and money in returns, repairs and redesign. They may tell you that a custom wire design is not needed and an off the shelf wire will work just fine for your application.

There are a variety of reasons design engineers turn to custom wire and cable for their projects, but the main reason is simply they cannot find a ready- made cable that meets all their requirements.
<br /><br />Unique requirements may be as simple as needing:
<br /><br />Very small or odd gauge wire.
<br />    Special materials.
<br />    Unique construction.
<br />    More flexibility.
<br />    Custom colors, jacket finish, or custom printing.
<br /><br />More complicated custom cable requirements may involve complex construction such as, composite cables or hybrid cables. Many applications have unique requirements that can only be met with a custom cable made specifically for that application.
<br />Getting started with a custom cable design.
<br />Custom wire and cable manufacturers take the application into consideration when designing a custom cable. The more your custom cable manufacturer knows about the environment and usage of the wire and cable the better the performance of the custom cable will be.
<br />Gather your data.
<br />Have all the information about your project ready and include as much information as possible. You may not have or know all the information your cable manufacturer should be able to assist you.
<br />Information to have:
<br /><br />Number, size and plating of conductors
<br />    Cable O.D.
<br />    Voltage, operating temperature
<br />    Impedance, EMI requirements
<br />    Other requirements- Certifications, bio-compatibility, flex cycles, flammability.
<br />    Include a description of how the cable will be used.
<br /><br />Don't forget to include small details like jacket finish (matte or glossy), custom colors, smooth, etc...
<br />Finding a custom cable manufacturer.
<br />The wire and cable industry is relatively small. Get a recommendation from your contract manufacturer, industry friends and even Google. Each custom cable manufacturer has their own specialty or niche. Be sure your cable manufacturer has experience with the type of application you are working with for example, aerospace/space cables, low smoke materials, medical cables, implantable wire and cable and others. Experienced in manufacturing for your type of application will save you in delays and problems down the line.
<br />When you get a quote from more than one, make sure the cable designs are similar. If not, find out why.  It is always a good idea to compare the designs and cable components and ask questions in ensure nothing was missed with your custom cable design.
<br />Custom wire and cable advantage
<br />The benefits of using a custom cable over a readily available cable are many. The two main benefits of using wire and cable designed specifically for your product is going to outlast and outperform an off the shelf solution in most cases.
<br />Readily available wire and cable is mass produced to cover a wide range of usage in a variety of industries. A generic robotic cable may work well in one robotic application may not work in a medical or aerospace robotic application. Often when using generic cables concessions are made in order to accommodate the cable.

But what about using silicone in ribbon cable? Manufactures turn to silicone ribbon cables when applications require flat cables with specialized requirements or extreme flexibility. Flat cables and ribbon cables are often used when space is a factor ribbon cables can also be easily mass terminated using
<br />an insulation displacement connector (IDC). Ribbon cables are manufactured in a variety of materials and configurations including silicone; the most common and least expensive insulation is PVC.
<br />Space is a luxury as devices become smaller. Manufacturers are using flat and ribbon cables for more applications.
<br /><br />Industries include:
<br /><br />Aerospace
<br />    Automation/Robotics
<br />    Medical
<br />    Industrial
<br />    Automotive
<br />    Telecommunication
<br /><br />These types of applications often need insulation materials other than PVC due to special requirements such as extreme temperature, low smoke, flammability, flexibility, sterilization and chemical contact. Silicone is an excellent choice for these types of requirements. Not only is silicone wire extremely flexible, it can withstand millions of flex cycles, and has good steam and chemical resistance. Silicone ribbon cables can be extruded or bonded depending on the type of termination that is used. Extruded ribbon cables have a tighter center to center tolerance than the bonded ribbon cable. When using a bonded ribbon cable, terminating with IDC is recommended. Extruded ribbon cables normally require tooling to control shape and pitch which may add to initial cost. Bonded ribbon cables normally do not have special tooling used.
<br />Flat cables can be manufactured in a variety of constructions which may include zip cords, ribbon cables and flat cables with an outer jacket. Custom cables can also be constructed with shielded twisted pairs, overall shield, and with tubing or lumens. Custom flat cables are also available in smaller gauges which you cannot find &quot;off the shelf&quot;.
<br />Silicone insulated wire and cables do have their drawback. Silicone has poor abrasion resistance, which can be a critical problem for applications where the cable comes in contact with sharp objects.  Higher abrasion resistant formulas are available for silicone. Consult your wire and cable manufacturer regarding your application to find out the options available to you.

Medical device designers many times focus on the device and overlook the wire and cables that is needed for the device to perform its function. Medical cables tend to be more specialized due to the many types of uses and environments it is subjected to. The wire and cable is many times not thought of until the end of the design process, which may be too late. Knowing your medical cable limitations and the options available to you in the beginning is important especially when designing housing or specifying connectors. Some things to keep in mind when specifying wire and cable for a medical device: 
<br />•	Size- With the size of devices becoming smaller many times smaller gauge wire and cable is needed. Off the shelf wire and cable usually go as small as 28AWG. Fine wire and custom cable designs are usually needed.
<br />•	Flexibility- Handheld devices and medical robots require flexible cables which can withstand repetitive flexing. Higher stranded conductors and sometimes alloys are needed to achieve this.
<br />•	Sterilization- Sterilization can be done with alcohol, steam or gamma to name a few. Cable jackets need to withstand the sterilization process.
<br />•	Bio-compatibility- Medical grade cables are needed depending on the level of contact with the patient. Bio-compatible and implantable grade compounds are available for medical devices.
<br />•	Construction- Cables sending signals, power and even gas/fluid can be constructed in on jacket. Constructions can vary from the simple wire to complex hybrid cable.
<br />•	Unique- Medical devices are all unique in regards to application, requirements and environment. You should not use an off the shelf mass produced cable designed for to meet the generic needs of a variety of industries for a specialized medical device.
<br />Considering your wire and cable needs from the early stages of your product design will prevent problems down the line in regards to failures in the field, design issues and time constraints. Designing custom medical cables for your application ensures you have a medical device that will exceed performance and longevity you require.
<br /><br />Depending on the type of use a variety of medical grade insulation materials are available. Reusable medical cables are built to endure constant flexing and extended cycles of sterilization. Insulation may be Teflon®, TPE or silicone rubber with TPR or silicone jackets. For disposable medical cables PVC and PE are the insulation most commonly used. Discuss your application with your custom cable manufacture in order to choose the right material for your medical device.
<br />Working with a custom wire and cable manufacture is easier than you think. Custom wire and cable engineers work with you every step of the way to determine and suggest the best materials and construction for your medical application. It's like having a wire and cable expert on your team. Cable designs are usually modified throughout the design process to accommodate changes to the device design. Many custom wire and cable manufacturers are able to produce small quantities for prototypes and clinical trials.

Wire and cable is manufactured in a variety of configurations, not all wire is the same. The conductors for wire (aside from solid core) are made of multiple strands of fine wire bunched or twisted together. Conductor stranding plays an important part of the flexibility and the performance life of the wire. The more individual wire strands in a wire, the more flexible, break-resistant and stronger the wire is. Hi flex applications where repetitive flexing is required use different stranding than wire used to wire a building or home. &amp;quot;Off the shelf wire normally is available in solid, 7 strand and 19 strand constructions which is fine for applications not requiring flexibility or repetitive movement.
<br />Repetitive flexing can cause conductor strands to break over time which lowers the conductivity of the wire. Using higher strand wire helps eliminate this problem. High strand wire is used in medical handheld devices, robotics and even headphones.
<br />Many custom wire and cable manufacturers offer high strand wire which you cannot obtain easily from distribution. For example, a 20AWG wire can be manufactured with a solid conductor or solid core all the way to 168 strands. Knowing which conductor stranding option will best suit your needs is important.
<br />Identifying the conductor call out: A typical call out is XX (YY / ZZ). The &amp;quot;X&amp;quot; is the gauge of the wire, &amp;quot;Y&amp;quot; is the number of strands and &amp;quot;Z&amp;quot; is the gauge size of those strands. Once you understand what these numbers mean, identifying the conductor construction is simple. A wire gauge chart is a handy tool to view wire gauge stranding options
<br />The more common conductor stranding configurations are concentric (true concentric, equilay concentric, unidirectional concentric, and unilay concentric), bunched and rope.
<br />Rope stranding is conductor construction consisting of single strands assembled together into concentric or bunched configurations. Rope constructions consist of concentric or bunched members stranded together into the final concentric or bunched configuration. Rope stranding has the advantage of increasing flexibility by using a larger number of finer strands while maintaining a tighter diameter tolerance than a simple bunched construction. Ropes are more evident in the larger AWG sizes, such as 8 AWG and larger, but there are also many applications that require the flexibility of rope constructions in the smaller gauges. Constructions vary and can contain hundreds or thousands of strands.
<br /><br />Depending on the use, the type of conductor is important. Hi flex and load bearing applications would require conductors with higher tensile strength such as alloys. Copper conductors are normally for less rigorous flexing 
<br />Flexible wire is a term which can be interpreted in many ways from hi flex to the actual flexibility of the wire. Letting your cable manufacturer know what your expectation is for the flexibility of your wire or cable will help in choosing the right conductor stranding. Calmont has manufactured extremely flexible large gauge wire and cable as big as 4/0 which is limp and flops over the end of a table. Of course insulation and jacket material also plays an important role in making a flexible cable, but the conductor stranding is where you start

Knowing which type of medical grade insulation or jacket material to choose from medical cable manufacturers is important. Before designing a cable, you need to answer these basic questions:
<br /><br />•	Is the cable disposable or reusable?
<br />•	Will there be patient contact? Bio-compatibility requirements?
<br />•	Will the cable be sterilized? If so how?
<br />? Flexibility requirements?
<br />? How will the cable be used?
<br />Medical cables fall into two categories, reusable and disposable. Disposable one patient use cables are normally made of less expensive material such as PVC and are not subject to repetitive sterilization due to short term use. Reusable cables often times have to withstand many cycles of sterilization such as, autoclave, gamma, E-Beam, and chemical sterilization. Knowing how the cable will be sterilized is important in order to narrow down your jacket options as some materials will break down or can’t withstand certain types of sterilization. 
<br /><br />Medical grade insulation and jacket materials differ depending on the type of contact it will have with the patient. Implantable grade insulation materials are usually Teflon or silicone rubber. Common jackets are silicone rubber or implant grade Polyurethanes. For other uses medical grade materials include PVC, TPE, polyethylene, FEP, PFA, and polyurethane.
<br />Medical cables application and use vary from sensors to complex surgical devices. Relaying this information to your cable manufacturer is important. Cables can be subjected to repetitive flexing, abrasion, getting stepped on or rolled over by carts. Choosing a material that can withstand the day to day use will prolong the life of the cable.

This is due in great part to Pop Culture which has for years made both men and women feel that they must follow their high standards in order to fit in with society.  Hollywood celebrities play a big role in influencing their fans into taking part of various trends.  It now seems as if plastic surgery is no longer something that people look down on.  People have become more open to it and see it as a great way to enhance your body until it reaches perfection.  
<br /><br />With the help of a qualified plastic surgeon Boston patients are able to enhance the overall appearance of their breasts.  Media and pop culture put a tremendous amount of pressure on women so that feel they need to have a slim body with the proportioned curves.  The most popular plastic surgery procedure among women is breast augmentation. For women, having breasts that are either too small can be a major issue.  Women with small breasts will often complain that they are self-conscious because of this issue.  They complain that they are unable to “fill” their clothing the way that they would like to.  
<br />Although women with large breasts also complain that they are not happy, breast reduction is not nearly as popular as breast augmentation Boston.  Since large breasts have become a key attribute that society considers attractive, many women desire to have fuller looking breasts.  Most, if not all celebrities have large breasts. This is no coincidence; celebrities that were not born with full looking breasts have undergone breast augmentation to enhance their appearance.  The first step that you will need to take if you are considering breast enlargement is to consult a plastic surgeon that will be able to inform you on the different breast implants that are available.
<br />The two most common implants which are used for breast enlargement are filled with silicone gel or saline and come in either a round or tear drop shape.  These breast implants are available in different cup sizes to give breasts a natural look while increasing their size. One common result of aging is that breasts begin to sag.  When this happens, breast augmentation is not the best option since it will not correct sagging of the breasts.  A breast lift is the best option for breasts that are experiencing the downside of pregnancy, nursing, and gravity.  During this procedure the breasts are lifted and raised by removing excess skin and tightening the surrounding tissue to reshape and support the new breast contour.  Often times, a plastic surgeon will recommend that the patient undergoes a breast augmentation and a breast lift to achieve the best results possible.

Some women may opt for this type of plastic surgery for medical or cosmetic reasons that may include under developed breasts, difference in breast sizes, or they want to change breast size after pregnancy or breast-feeding. Breast augmentation Boston procedures may be suitable for a woman who:
<br /><br />•         Is bothered by having breasts that are too small.
<br />•         Has well-fitting clothes around the hips but too big at the bust line.
<br />•         Is self-conscious about wearing a swimsuit.
<br />•         Notices her breasts are getting smaller and losing firmness after childbirth.
<br />•         Sees that her breasts have altered in size and shape after weight loss.
<br />•         Has one breast that is noticeably smaller than other.
<br />During an initial consultation, you will be asked about your desired breast size as it helps to understand the expectations of the patient and whether or not they may be achieved. A plastic surgeon Boston specialist will examine the breasts and may take photographs for the medical record. An evaluation of your medical history may include information about medical conditions, drug allergies, medical treatments received, any earlier surgeries, and medications currently being taken. Furthermore, you should also discuss any weight loss being considered as you may be asked to stabilize your weight before undergoing any surgery. You may also be asked about having any plans for pregnancy as it may unpredictably alter breast size, hence affecting the long-term results. The procedure is carried out by using one of two types of breast implants:
<br />1.       Saline Implants. These are filled with sterile salt water to a pre-determined size that may be modified during surgery.
<br /><br />2.       Silicone Implants. These are filled with soft elastic gel requiring a longer incision to place implants.  
<br />A breast augmentation surgery starts with a baseline mammogram, one before surgery and another some months after surgery. This helps to detect future breast tissue changes. The plastic surgeon will administer medication using local anesthesia or intravenous sedation, although some cases may require general anesthesia. These medications do provide comfort to the patient during the procedure. The breasts will be wrapped in gauze dressings or a surgical bra and then you will be taken to a recovery area to be monitored. As this is an outpatient procedure, you will be encouraged to arrange for someone to drive you home after surgery and stay with you for at least a night.
<br />Within a few days dressings may be removed but most likely you will be required to wear a support bra. Showers may be allowed 3-7 days after surgery and all the stitches will be removed in a week. Initially, there may be some discoloration and swelling that may disappear quickly and residual swelling resolving within a month. The discomfort that ensues after your surgery will definitely be worth it once you see the rewarding results.

Besides being extremely flexible, silicone rubber can withstand autoclave and other forms of sterilization. Properties that make silicone suitable for medical applications include: Low thermal conductivity, low chemical reactivity, low toxicity and thermal stability (consistency of properties over a wide temperature range of 100°C to 250°C). Abrasion resistance is a concern when considering silicone insulation or jacket. Formulas for higher tear strength are available to increase resistance to abrasion.
<br />Applications suitable for silicone cables include:
<br />•	Arthroscopic
<br />•	Surgical Robotics
<br />•	Electrosurgical
<br />•	Implantable
<br />•	Ophthalmic
<br />•	Foot Switch
<br />•	Patient Monitoring
<br />What makes a material medical grade? Materials are tested for bio-compatibility and are categorized to be used for medical applications. Medical grade materials are generally grouped into three categories: non implantable, short term implantable and long-term implantable. Materials approved as USP Class V and VI can be considered medical grade, most medical grade silicone is at least Class VI certified.
<br />Uses for medical grade silicone cables include:
<br />•	Tubing/Lumen
<br />•	Drains
<br />•	Feeding tubes
<br />•	Catheters
<br />•	Implants for long and short term use
<br />•	Sensors
<br /> Co-extruded and multi-layer silicone cables can be used for high voltage applications such as X-Ray and MRI equipment which require electrical noise suppression and limited power loss . Co-extrusion involves extruding a semi-conductive silicone layer around the conductor to remove air thus reducing corona. Extruding both semi-conductive layer and jacket simultaneously insures no air or particles are caught between the layers. Benefits for co-extruded silicone include corona, moisture &amp; ozone resistance, lightweight and flexible cable design and radiation resistance to name a few.
<br />When working with your custom cable manufacturer, it is crucial to provided them as much information as possible about the application, the environment, sterilization and bio-compatibility requirements. The more information you can provide to your silicone cable manufacturer will help in determining if silicone is right for your application and to offer you material choices that will enhance your product's performance.

Even with the most flexible wire insulation, the flexibility of the wire will depend on the conductor stranding. Conductor construction is key in achieving a noodle like flexible wire. There are two things to look at when choosing the right conductor: 
<br />1. Number of strands. Conductors are made of many fine strands which are cabled together to meet the required gauge size. is available from one strand (solid) to hundreds depending on the gauge size. The higher the strand count the more flexible and resistant to flexing fatigue the wire will be. For example a 24AWG wire the stranding options are from 1 strand (solid) all the way to 105 strands. That’s quite a range.
<br /><br />2. Conductor construction. How these fine strands are put together is as important as the strand count. The most common configuration is concentric. Concentric conductor may be defined as: a central wire (strand) surrounded by one or more layers of helically laid wires in a geometric pattern. Rope stranding has the advantage of increasing flexibility by using a larger number of finer strands while maintaining a tighter diameter tolerance than a simple bunched construction.
<br />Flexing vs. Flexibility
<br /><br />High Strand Silicone Wire
<br />To some flexibility means to withstand repetitive flexing, while to others it means how much the wire will bend and rigidity. For both types of applications a high stranded conductor is recommended. For repetitive flexing one should consider using an alloy material for higher strength and flex cycles. For noodle like flexibility a standard copper conductor is fine.
<br />Flexible cables
<br />Flexible cables also use high strand conductors, but there are more factors involved controlling the flexibility; Such as, Shielding, outer jacket material, cable lay construction and type of conductors just to name a few.
<br />It's always best to discuss your flexibility needs and the conductors available with a wire and cable manufacturer, especially one that works with high strand count conductors. Off the shelf (commodity) wire manufacturers usually work with solid, 7 and 19 strand conductors which are less flexible than the high strand conductors.

There are some misconceptions regarding silicone wire and silicone cables. Listed below are five facts you probably didn't know about silicone insulated wire that I get asked frequently. 
<br />1. It doesn't have to be tacky. Recently at a trade show I handed a visitor a sample of our silicone wire and he said: &amp;quot;Wow, this isn't sticky, we stay away from silicone because it's always sticky.&amp;quot; Silicone rubber is normally tacky, this can be a problem especially in medical applications where you don't want dirt sticking to the cable. Silicone cables can be made so they are not tacky or sticky. This is accomplished with manufacturing techniques and formulas can be used to make the jacket smooth and not tacky. Normally silicone wire and cable is coated with Mica to keep it from sticking to itself during the manufacturing process, this coating is not acceptable in some applications that requiring clean environments. The alternative is to manufacture the silicone so it is not sticky from the start.
<br />2. Available in ribbon cables. Silicone cables can be manufactured as ribbon cable a few different ways. Silicone ribbon cables can be extruded, bonded and even molded into ribbon and flat cables. Silicone ribbon cables can be extruded as a ribbon cable which offers the tightest center to center tolerances. Bonding the ribbon cable involves extruding the individual silicone wires separately then they are bonded together, this method is less expensive than extruding the ribbon cable because there isn't any additional tooling. Bonded silicone ribbon cables work best with IDC connectors and soldering. Molded ribbon cables are usually silicone wires encapsulated with a silicone outer jacket, this method allows for unique flat shapes. 
<br />3. Low outgassing formulas are available. Aerospace, specifically space applications often have outgassing restrictions for the wire and cable. Recent advancements with silicone formulas and manufacturing techniques have created low outgassing silicone cable. For space craft and satellite applications Calmont manufactures silicone wire and cable products which meet NASA .01% TML requirement. Depending on your outgassing requirements, check with your silicone cable manufacturer to find out what is available. Click here to view Aerospace insulation properties chart.
<br />4. Reinforced silicone is available. High strength silicone formulas are now being used to increase abrasion resistance of silicone wire and cable. Fluorosilicone has better abrasion resistance than the standard silicone. Additional measures can be taken to reduce abrasion such as strength members between layers and nylon outer braid to protect the silicone insulation.
<br />5. Doesn't burn. Silicone insulation is self extinguishing, it will not burn. Flame retardant additives can be added to meet flame requirements such as VF1

Reusable medical cables often times are subjected to sterilization processes and are built to endure extended cycles of sterilization. Understanding how a wire or cable will be sterilized is crucial to determine what materials to specify when designing a medical device. Insulation and jacket materials vary when it comes to resistance to chemicals, heat and other sterilization techniques.
<br />Common types of sterilization include:
<br />•	Heat/steam - Autoclave
<br />•	Chemical
<br />•	Irradiation - E-Beam &amp; Gamma Ray
<br />Autoclave (heat/steam) resistant materials for reusable medical cables include FEP®, TPE, silicone or with TPR or silicone rubber jackets. Radiation resistant medical cables can be made with silicone and Teflon® (if water is not present). TPE and PVC can be made for Gamma sterilization with limited sterilization cycles. PVC is not commonly used with chemical sterilization, alcohol based liquids can break down the plasticizers (an additive for PVC) and can make the PVC brittle and damage the insulation or jacket. PVC is more commonly used with disposable applications.
<br />It is always best to discuss with your custom cable manufacturer what types of sterilization and how many sterilization cycles the cable will be subjected to. Cable manufacturers experienced with medical cables and their applications can help narrow down your choices based on sterilization techniques, bio-compatibility and other requirements.

Many designers shy away from using custom cables due to not knowing what is involved or they have dealt with manufacturers who do not specialize in custom cable designs. Here are five myths that we can clear up.
<br />1. Really expensive - People that are new to designing products often think you need thousands of dollars to have a custom cable made. The truth is for as little as $500 (sometimes less) you can have custom wire or cable made to your specifications. When comparing custom wire and cable to the &quot;off the shelf&quot; custom is obviously more expensive, but we are not comparing apples to apples here. Custom cable is designed to your specific product or application requirements which may require special materials or construction. In the early stages of product development where small prototype quantities are needed, the cost of the cable can be higher than production quantities.
<br />2. Huge minimums - Using a custom wire and cable manufacturer is important. Custom cable manufacturers are set up to run many types of materials and constructions and usually have to set up the machinery for each job. Minimums are small or non existent. Commodity/ off the shelf manufacturers normally are running the same materials and construction over and over, so for this type of manufacturer to stop production to make an unusual cable is costly. If you approach a commodity manufacture, it is not uncommon to be quoted a 10k-15k minimum. Unless you are using an unusual or uncommon material that itself has a minimum buy, you can order small quantities from the custom cable manufacturers.
<br />3. Expensive tooling charges - Custom cables do not normally do not require special tooling. Tooling charges or N.R.E. can be expected for custom printing, unusual shapes and flat ribbon cables which require special dies to maintain wire pitch and extruded shape.
<br />4. Long lead times - Custom cable lead times can vary depending on material availability and construction. On the average hook up wire can have a 2-4 week turn around and cables can run 3-6 weeks. Commodity cable manufacturer lead times for custom cable can run 8-14 weeks or longer.
<br />5. &quot;I need to know all about wire &amp; cable&quot; - Design engineers sometimes shy away from custom cable designs because wire and cable is not their forte. Custom cable manufacturers have engineers and custom wire and cable designers on hand to assist their customers with choosing the right materials and construction. It's like having a wire and cable expert on your team. Cable designs are usually at no additional cost.
<br />Of course there are exceptions to the statements listed above. Lead times and minimums can be affected by material choices and complicated cable designs. When considering custom wire and cable designs for your product, be sure to contact a custom cable manufacturer. Working with a company which manufactures custom cable products enables you to buy smaller quantities, faster turnaround, and you buy a cable specifically made for your application.

To some, very flexible wire can mean able to withstand repetitive flexing while to others it describes the limpness of the wire or cable. When describing a &amp;quot;super flexible wire&amp;quot; to your wire and cable manufacturer be sure to be clear on which you need either hi-flex or limpness. Is there a difference? There is a difference between the two types of wire and cable which begins with the conductor stranding and material.
<br />High flex cycles and repetitive flex wire and cables are specialized for these types of applications. Whether you are working with a custom wire and cable manufacturer or buying commodity robotic cables, special attention should be taken with regards to the conductor stranding and material. Specifying a high strand count alloy conductor in your wire and cable design is key to the longevity of the cable. Lower strand count conductors such as a typical 19 strand will not last long in a hi-flex environment, as the individual strands break due to the stress and fatigue, the weaker and less conductive the conductor will become until it inevitably fails. High strand conductors can be constructed in a way that the stress of flexing is absorbed by the large number of fine strands and having a few strands break will not affect the conductivity as would in a 7 or 19 strand construction.
<br />The use of high strength alloys is recommended for hi flex life. They offer high breaking strength and greater flex life with only a small increase in DC resistance. Cadmium-chromium copper, cadmium copper, chromium copper, and zirconium copper are most frequently used. View our conductor stranding page for types of conductor configurations available and our wire gauge table for stranding options.
<br />A wire and cable company will usually offer hi-flex and repetitive flexing applications can be found in:
<br />•	Robotic and automation
<br />•	Medical and surgical hand pieces
<br />•	Sensors and instrumentation
<br />•	Aerospace
<br />Flexible wire and cable in terms of limpness also requires high strand conductors but may not require the use of alloy materials depending on the application. Descriptions of this type of wire include:
<br />•	Ultra flexible wire
<br />•	Noodle wire, noodle like
<br />•	Hi flex
<br />•	Limp wire
<br />The other key to flexible wire is the insulation or jacket material choice. There are many flexible materials depending on your requirements. The most flexible insulation material is silicone rubber, but depending on your application it may not be right for you. When discussing your flexible wire requirements with a wire and cable company be as descriptive as possible and discuss the application in order to narrow down your material choices. Flexible wires are available in most gauges. The wire pictured here is a 1050 strand 6 AWG and is extremely flexible and quite limp. Custom wire and cable manufacturers usually stock high strand conductors for flexible and hi-flex wire applications.
