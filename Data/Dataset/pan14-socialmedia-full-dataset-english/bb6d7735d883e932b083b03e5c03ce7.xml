Pamplona has long been a center of attraction with the bull-run tradition from the medieval times where herdsmen drive their bulls across the plains and town streets into the bull ring within the city.
<br /><br />Pamplona is an important city between Castilia and France which embodies a diverse architecture, cuisine, culture, tradition and customs since the days of past epochs. The various influences from the Visigoths, Moors, Franks and Romans shaped the city to what it is today.
<br /><br />St. Fermin festival
<br /><br />One of the most popular festivals in Pamplona is the St. Fermin festival in July. Hundreds of international visitors come to Pamplona to join in the festivity which brings thousands of locals across the region.
<br /><br />Thousands of people of all races throng the city streets to watch dozens of bulls released to run the cordoned city streets directing the bulls to the bull ring before confronting skilled matadors. Older folks and families are wise to observe the annual ritual from a safe location while adventurous thrill-seekers participate in excitement.
<br /><br />Outcome
<br /><br />Although the bull run is part and parcel of a steep tradition in Pamplona, there is a certain level of risk involved where participants and by-standers can be injured in the event. One such undesirable incident is the death of an American youth who was gored to death in 1995 by a bull. Another runner was experienced the same fate in 1924. 
<br /><br />Many young and enthusiastic runners are still game to participate in the Bull Run despite the risks involved which only heightens the mystique of the festival. Tourists are advised to stay on the safe sidelines to observe the event while they are free to join in the merry making later in the night with music, dancing, singing and fireworks. There are plenty of activities which liven up the place and festival during the eight day event <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3Zha2FudGllaHVpemVuc3BhbmplLnZpbGxhbWFyLm5sLw__" target="_blank">vakantiewoning spanje</a>.

The whole drama unfolds with the majestic natural landscapes around Ronda which lies on the isolated sierra ridge that is divided into two by El Tajo, a majestic gaping river gorge that drops steeply down 130m at its other sides. The gorge gives sight to a spectacular 18th century Puente Nuevo which is an ancient arched bridge with tall whitewashed houses seemingly sitting on its edges precariously.

Further down the same spot, one can view other feathered species like crag martins. Ronda is well visited by day trippers from all around Costa del Sol.
<br /><br />Ronda can be enjoyed in three sections; its northwest is the modernized Mercadillo quarter; Ciudad lies across the ancient bridge; at the south is the San Francisco suburb. Ciudad is an ancient Moorish town that has retained the Moorish characteristics through its houses with several fine Renaissance mansions. There are many intricate paths for a visitor to discover through random wandering.

<br /><br />One can cross the bridge to Calle Santo Domingo which is also called Calle Marqués de Parada that would lead to No. 17 Casa del Rey Moro; this 18th century mansion has Moorish foundations and a lovely garden which is open to the public on a daily basis. An interesting underground stairway called the Mina leads the way down to the river in 365 steps. 
<br /><br />The river is the main source of water supply in times of old especially when the city was under siege; this ancient site also has a viewing balcony to admire the towering rock walls of Tajo and its species of birds that make their habitat there <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3Zha2FudGllaHVpemVuc3BhbmplLnZpbGxhbWFyLm5sLw__" target="_blank">vakantievilla spanje</a>.

The town and its surroundings offer beautiful natural landscapes that are tranquil and ideal for a relaxing holiday for the lone individual or family.
<br /><br />Ancient beauties
<br /><br />There are obvious hump-shaped cupolas at the river banks on the southwest region as well as unique glass roof-windows at old Baños Árabes which are open to the public for viewing at no cost. A 13th century old Roman bath has been recently restored utilizing the Roman system that offers cold, hot or tepid baths. Great effort has been put in to preserve this ancient structure. There are well preserved barrel-vaulted ceiling as well as octagonal brickwork pillars that support horseshoe arches which showcase the impressive architectural sophistication of that epoch.
<br /><br />At the Ciudad quarter stands Plaza Duquesa de Parcent which is Ronda’s town square that is of exquisite beauty. In the center is Santa María La Mayor Cathedral which stands in the site of a former Arab mosque. One can view the graceful external structures that combine Gothic, Renaissance and Moorish styles. Hence, it is not surprising to see a belfry on top of an ancient minaret on this monument. Although the inside is not as impressive, there are still interesting arches sporting Arabic calligraphy and other Arabian components such as an old Arab mihrab which is a prayer niche. 
<br /><br />On the plaza’s west stands Casa de Mondragón which was a Moorish palace that is opened for public viewing. There are 3 well preserved patios of original stuccowork with a well carved ceiling. A museum exists to showcase local archeology with Moorish offerings. 
<br /><br />At the plaza’s northeast stands Museo Lara housing the best works of rondeño Juan Antonio Lara. The family owned and ran a local bus company with Señor Lara being an avid collector of fascinating antique clocks, armaments, pistols, musical instruments, archeological finds, cinematographic equipment and cameras since childhood. These are showcased in Museo Lara. 
<br /><br />Historical beauties
<br /><br />Towards the end of Ciudad lies the remains of Alcázar after the French destroyed it in 1809. The fortress was once virtually impregnable which served as the Moorish capital until 1485 before Granada fell to other hands 7 years later <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3Zha2FudGllaHVpemVuc3BhbmplLnZpbGxhbWFyLm5sLw__" target="_blank">villa spanje</a>.
<br /><br />There are exquisite town gates of Moorish descent as well as Re-Conquest influence in their celebration of winning the region again. The Puerta de Carlos V stands next to the Alcázar before entering San Francisco suburb as a reminder of their conquest.
