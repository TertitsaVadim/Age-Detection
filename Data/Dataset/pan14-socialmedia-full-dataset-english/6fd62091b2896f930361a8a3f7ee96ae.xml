Everyone has issues, and I have my own to struggle with. It is hard enough to have to listen to my well-meaning friends comment about me not having a professional career like them, comments that hit “below the waist” type and problems in the family that I don’t know how to handle things at times. Ate Ria gives me words of encouragement and support and helped me through some rough spots these past few days and I don’t know what I’d have done without her. Steffy tells me that jeez what I do is too much work and that I just took the path less traveled then my cohorts. My situation at home and at work is demanding, and putting stress on everyone, and I can’t talk to mi famila of what I’m going through. The past few days its been raining, so I’ve been walking to Clarke Quay at night to ponder, weep and cry in a doped up state. In times like this ,I turned to the Quran and to my books, especially Paulo Coelho’s The Alchemist. Here are some inspiring quotes from the book:
<br /><br />It's the possibility of having a dream come true that makes life interesting.
<br /><br />Never stop dreaming.
<br /><br />Not everyone can see his dreams come true in the same way. 
<br /><br />Everyone seems to have a clear idea of how other people should lead their lives, but none about his or her own.
<br /><br />The world's greatest lie: At a certain point in out lives we lose control of what's happening to us and our lives become controlled by fate. 
<br /><br />When you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it.
<br /><br />Intuition is really a sudden immersion of the soul into the universal current of life, where the histories of all people are connected, and we are able to know everything because it's all written there.
<br /><br />If you can concentrate on the present, you'll be a happy man…the secret is here in the present. If you pay attention to the present, you can improve upon it. And if you improve on the present, what comes later will also be better…Each day, in itself, brings with it an eternity.
<br /><br />Everything has been written by the same hand.
<br /><br />All things are one.
<br /><br />Courage is the quality most essential to understanding the language of the world.
<br /><br />Everyone on earth has a treasure that awaits him. 
<br /><br />Wherever your heart is, there you will find your treasure. 
<br /><br />You've got to find the treasure, so that everything you have learned along the way can make sense. 
<br /><br />There is only one way to learn. It's through action. 
<br /><br />Listen to your heart. It knows all things, because it came from the Soul of the World and it will one day return there. 
<br /><br />This natural world is only an image and a copy of paradise. 
<br /><br />The existence of this world is simply a guarantee that there exists a world that is perfect. 
<br /><br />No heart has ever suffered when it goes in search of its dreams, because every second of the search is a second's encounter with God and with eternity. 
<br /><br />Most people see the world as a threatening place, and because they do, the world turns out indeed to be a threatening place.
<br /><br />When you possess great treasures within you, and try to tell others of them, seldom are you believed.
<br /><br />No one fails to suffer the consequences of everything under the sun. 
<br /><br />There is only one thing that makes a dream impossible to achieve: the fear of failure. 
<br /><br />When we love, we always strive to become better than we are. 
<br /><br />When we strive to become better than we are, everything around us becomes better too. 
<br /><br />Without love, dreams would have no meaning. 
<br /><br />Love is the pure language of the world...A language without words…the one true language of the universe. It requires no explanation, just as the universe needs none as it travels through endless time.
<br /><br />Love is the force that transforms and improves the soul of the world.
<br /><br />The boy reached through to the Soul of the World and saw that it was a part of the Soul of God. And he saw that the Soul of God was his own soul. And that he, a boy, could perform miracles. 
<br /><br />No matter what he does, every person on earth plays a central role in the history of the world. And normally he doesn't know it.
<br /><br />A philosophy of life: I'm an adventurer, looking for treasure.

He wasn't able to move, nor was he able to breath properly the whole of Sunday and the rest of the night. At 5am my grandfather was groaning in pain non stop, and with the persuasion of my fragile grandma he agreed to be sent to hospital. Doctors found that he was in the end stage of renal failure, his body has alot of toxic in it. Doctors were direct, that he had a 50/50 chance of surviving. Hearing that weakend all of us, what else can we do but pray to Allah for him to recover and to take care of grandfather. Doctors placed him on dialysis in the SICU immediately, we were not allowed to see him. At about 5pm the doctor came out and explained that the tube was inserted into the artery instead of a vein, and that they cannot stop the bleeding without an operation. What was at first just a dialysis treatment ended up into an operating procedure, he had lost a lot of blood from 5 till about 8pm as they set up the operating theatre. 
<br /><br />The whole extended family stood outside the operating theater worrying,  crying, stressed along the darkened corridor of the hospital that once served the British army. My grandma fainted when she saw my grandfather as he was wheeled out of the operating theather and into the SICU. They managed to seal the artery, and there was nothing else we could do but wait for him to wake up from GA. He lost alot of blood and yet they did not replace the amounts that were lost when spurting out of the vein. I took my grandma back to her place, and accompanied her for the past week, she lives alone with grandfather, and it wasn't advisable to leave her by herself in her current state so I ignored my feelings of sadness and try to make her laugh and think of other things.  
<br /><br />Every morning we walk to the hospital from the flat, me breathless, she silent as we trudge up the hill. She'd stay all day there by his side, whilst I rushed off to work at 1pm. I'd play tag team with my uncle or my aunt who'd come over to replace me when I'm at work. My grandfather was transfered to MICU, and then he was lucid, thinking straight and refuses to go for dialysis treatment. We keep encouraging him, persuading him that it would enable him to live life to the fullest. The doctors had informed me in the mornings that if he were to continue with just medicines he only had a mth and a half to live. To do what my grandfather says, or to continously encourage him to undergo the treatment, he says he is well already and says that medicines were sufficient and we shouldn't undergo dialysis as he it'll cost a bomb. But we don't care, as a whole family we'll all chip in to ensure that he is healthy, he was thinking it just a way to make the government rich because dialysis treatment is expensive. But for him we were willing to undertake anything just as long as he got better. He is awaiting for my uncle who had gone to shanghai for work to come back and to make the decision for him, and I bet tomorrow morning, my darling grandfather would still stand his ground that meds were working for him and that he didn't need dialysis. I'm leaving for California on Thursday, and I have a sinking feeling that makes me not want to go at all. But if I don't, no one's gonna get the work done and meet the suppliers and the drunk skaters etc. Its a worrying trip that I am very unhappy to go. I don't know what to do anymore. Tonight I'm back home in my bed, I have to settle bank documents, reservations and tix because no ones free to do it. I'm tired, exhausted, depleted, I just want my grandfather to get better and discuss Paulo Coelho and the concept of The Zahir with me again. I want my grandfather to see my cousins grow up, me get married and have kids. I just want him to be well. He cried when I told him this. I know he doesn't want to burden his children, but this is the only way for him to be there for my grandma. The 16th will be their 51st anniversary.

That child understands magic moments. We can stifle its cries, but we cannot silence its voice. The child we once were is still there. Blessed are the children, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. If we are not reborn – if we cannot learn to look at life with the innocence and the enthusiasm of childhood – it makes no sense to go on living.
<br />-By The River Piedra I Sat Down And Wept by
<br />Paulo Coelho 
<br /><br />It is always important to know when something has reached its end.
<br />Closing circles, shutting doors, finishing chapters,it doesn't matter what we call it;
<br />what matters is to leave in the past
<br />those moments in life that are over
<br />-The Zahir by Paulo Coelho
<br /><br />There are three things that a child can teach an adult:to be happy for no reason; to be always busy doing something; and to know how to demand - with all one's might - what one wants.
<br />-The Fifth Mountain by Paulo Coelho
<br /><br />The warrior of light concentrates on the small
<br />miracles of daily life 
<br />-The Manual of the Warrior of Light by Paulo Coelho

It does not matter, I am just crazy to think I even mattered to you.

What happened was that I told her I was not happy that she and her sister were being used by their brothers. I do not like them to be taken advantage off. She says I do not understand, I should move out and learn how it is to live alone. God, I have lived alone, and it was the most peaceful and happiest time of my life. Her words hurt, even more so that she felt that I would not know how it is like to be her and her sister being in a big family since I only have my brother, when I understand what she is going through. My heart hurts even more just thinking about this but no one cares, I might as well die and not bother anyone anymore

<br /><br />&quot;The month of fasting has come, the emperor's banner has arrived; withhold your hand from food, the spirit's table has arrived. 
<br /><br />The soul has escaped from separation and bound nature's hands; the heart of error is defeated, the army of faith has arrived. 
<br /><br />Fasting is our sacrifice, it is the life of our soul; let us sacrifice all our body, since the soul has arrived as guest. 
<br /><br />Fortitude is as a sweet cloud, wisdom rains from it, because it was in such a month of fortitude that the Koran arrived. 
<br /><br />...Wash your hands and your mouth, neither eat nor speak; seek that speech and that morsel which has come to the silent ones.&quot;

We are happy that we were able to fast and pray in Ramadhan, and have hopefully attained Taqwa, the goal of fasting. 
<br /><br />In the holy Qur'an Allah talks about Eid. He says in Sura al-Baqarah, ayat no.185: You shall complete the number (of days) and you may glorify God for His guiding you, and that you may be thankful. Imam Ali (a) has a very beautiful hadith about Eid in which he says: Eid is for him whose fasts have been accepted by Allah, and whose worship has been appreciated by Allah. Everyday in which you do not disobey Allah is a day of Eid. This hadith is something to think about. Every day in which we do not commit a single sin, is actually a day of Eid for us. The Holy Prophet (s) and our Imams celebrated Eid and encouraged all Muslims to do so. They told Muslims to wear good clothes, put on perfume, and go to the mosque to recite the Eid prayer. They also said we should exchange Eid greetings, visit each other, and generally pass the day joyfully. We are supposed to remember the poor by taking out the fitrah before Eid, and visiting them and sending them gifts if we can. The day of Eid is meant for remembering Allah. The Holy Prophet (s) says: &quot;Give beauty to your Eid by doing Takbir&quot;. It is said that the Prophet (s) himself used to come out of his home on the day of Eid, reciting the Takbir and glorifying Allah in a loud voice.
<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.irib.ir%2FOccasions%2FRamadhan%2FEide%2520Fetr%2FEid%2520Fetr.en.HTM"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.irib.ir/Occasions/Ramadhan/Eide%20Fetr/Eid%20Fetr.en.HTM</a>
<br /><br />Last night, after listening to the Maghrib Adzan call for prayers and an indication that it was time for Iftar and to break my fast for the final time in the month of Ramadan this year, I don't know why but I started to tear up. It reminded me of the time when my late grandmother and I would make rice cakes  as the adzan plays on the radio, and afterwards the Takbir was recited. I am saddened that Ramadan was over and of the memory of my grandmother as she fill up the grains of rice into the containers made up of coconut leaves years ago.
<br /><br />This is how the Takbir goes:
<br /><br />Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar 
<br />Allah is Great, Allah is Great 
<br /><br />Allahu Akbar 
<br />Allah is Great 
<br /><br />La illaha il Allah 
<br />there is no God, but Allah 
<br /><br />Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar 
<br />Allah is Great, Allah is Great 
<br /><br />walilahil Hamd 
<br />to Him belongs all Praise 
<br /><br />Allahu Akbaru Kabeera 
<br />Allah is the Greatest 
<br /><br />wal-Hamdulilahi katheera 
<br />And all Praise is due to Him 
<br /><br />wa Subhan allahi 
<br />And Glory to Allah 
<br /><br />bukratan wa aseila 
<br />eventide and in the morning 
<br /><br />La illaha il Allah 
<br />there is no God, but Allah the Unique 
<br /><br />sadaqa wa'dah 
<br />He has fulfilled His Promise 
<br /><br />wa nasara abda 
<br />and made Victorious His servant 
<br /><br />wa a'azza jundahu 
<br />and made Mighty His soldiers 
<br /><br />wa hazamal-ahzaaba wahdah 
<br />and defeated the confederates 
<br /><br />La illaha il Allah 
<br />there is no God, But Allah 
<br /><br />wa laa na'budu illa iyyah 
<br />He alone we worship 
<br /><br />mukhlessena lahud-deena 
<br />with sincere and exclusive devotion 
<br /><br />walaw karehal-Kafeeroon 
<br />even though the idolaters hate it 
<br /><br />Allahumma salli ala sayyedna Muhammad 
<br />O Allah, have Mercy on our Prophet Muhammad 
<br /><br />wa ala aalie sayyedna Muhammad 
<br />and on the family of our Prophet Muhammad 
<br /><br />wa ala as-haabie sayyedna Muhammad 
<br />and on the companions of our Prophet Muhammad 
<br /><br />wa ala ansari sayyedna Muhammad 
<br />and on the helpers of our Prophet Muhammad 
<br /><br />wa ala azwajie sayyedna Muhammad 
<br />and on the wives of our Prophet Muhammad 
<br /><br />wa ala dhurreyatie sayyedna Muhammad 
<br />and on the progeny of our Prophet Muhammad 
<br /><br />wa sallim tasleeman katheera 
<br />and Bestow upon them much peace. 
<br /><br />To my fellow muslim brothers and sisters, I wish you an Eid-Al-Fitri Mubarak!

<br />Perhaps I should have waited for a more opportune time to tell you then tonight
<br />I am wary of what the future might bring
<br />Perhaps the truth is that I do not want to leave you hanging
<br />I am uncertain of what lies ahead
<br />Perhaps I am just feeling afraid
<br />I am hesitant to tell you how I feel
<br />Perhaps it is because I know these feelings are real
<br />Uncertainty clouds every decision I make
<br />For every question I ponder over
<br />For every direction I inch toward
<br />What I am certain is that everything is for the better
<br />Whatever happens, happen for a reason
<br />When one door closess another door opens towards new opportunities
<br />All I can do now is just seize the day and face the possibilities that lie ahead

There is a legend that everything that falls into the waters of this river – leaves, insects, the feathers of birds – is transformed into the rocks that make the riverbed. If only I could tear out my heart and hurl it into the current, then my pain and longing would be over, and I could finally forget.
<br /><br />By the river Piedra I sat down and wept. The winter air chills the tears on my checks, and my tears fall into the cold waters that course past me. Somewhere, this river joins another, then another, until – far from my heart and sight – all of them merge with the sea.
<br /><br />May my tears run just as fast, that my love might never know that one day I cried for him. May my tears run just as far, that I might forget the paths we walked together, the memories we’ve had, the dreams we’ve saved for each other. I shall forget the roads, the mountains, and the fields of my dreams – the dreams that will never come true.
<br /><br />But how can I not recall those moments? That is why I write – to try to turn sadness into longing, solitude into remembrance. So that when I finished my own story, I can toss it into the Piedra, Only then, will the waters extinguish what the flames have written.
<br /><br />All love stories are the same.
