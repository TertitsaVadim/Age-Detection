<br />You know I love you still
<br />Will I wait a lonely lifetime
<br />If you want me to--I will.
<br /><br />For if I ever saw you
<br />I didn't catch your name 
<br />But it never really mattered
<br />I will always feel the same.
<br /><br />Love you forever and forever
<br />Love you with all my heart
<br />Love you whenever we're together
<br />Love you when we're apart.
<br /><br />And when at last I find you 
<br />Your song will fill the air
<br />Sing it loud so I can hear you
<br />Make it easy to be near you
<br />For the things you do endear you to me
<br />How you know I will
<br />I will.

<br />I'm crazy, crazy for feeling so blue
<br />I knew you'd love me as long as you wanted
<br />And then someday you'd leave me for somebody new
<br />Worry, why do I let myself worry?
<br />Wond'ring what in the world did I do?
<br />Crazy for thinking that my love could hold you
<br />I'm crazy for trying and crazy for crying

<br />Two can be as bad as one
<br />It's the loneliest number since the number one
<br /><br />No is the saddest experience you'll ever know
<br />Yes, it's the saddest experience you'll ever know
<br />`Cause one is the loneliest number that you'll ever do
<br />One is the loneliest number, worse than two
<br /><br />It's just no good anymore since she went away
<br />Now I spend my time just making rhymes of yesterday
<br /><br />One is the loneliest, number one is the loneliest
<br />Number one is the loneliest number that you'll ever do
<br />One is the loneliest, one is the loneliest
<br />One is the loneliest number that you'll ever do
<br />It's just no good anymore since she went away
<br />(Number) One is the loneliest
<br />(Number) One is the loneliest
<br />(Number) One is the loneliest number that you'll ever do
<br />(Number) One is the loneliest
<br />(Number) One is the loneliest
<br />(Number) One is the loneliest number that you'll ever do

<br />I'm so tired, my mind is on the blink 
<br />I wonder should I get up and fix myself a drink 
<br />No,no,no. 
<br /><br />I'm so tired I don't know what to do 
<br />I'm so tired my mind is set on you 
<br />I wonder should I call you but I know what you'd do 
<br /><br />You'd say I'm putting you on 
<br />But it's no joke, it's doing me harm 
<br />You know I can't sleep, I can't stop my brain 
<br />You know it's three weeks, I'm going insane 
<br />You know I'd give you everything I've got 
<br />for a little peace of mind 
<br /><br />I'm so tired, I'm feeling so upset 
<br />Although I'm so tired I'll have another cigarette 
<br />And curse Sir Walter Raleigh

<br />linking to your heart
<br />does it end if I pull the plug
<br />how true in words
<br /><br />among the rooftop stains
<br />buds sprout from the dust
<br />I know you can live without me
<br />whistle in the breeze
<br /><br />along the line on the wall
<br />winding to the top
<br />vines climb madly city lights sadly
<br />reality comes back to me
<br /><br />Is it really me writing this to you
<br />Is it the real you sending this to me
<br /><br />you said you're leaving this country soon
<br />I know it doesn't matter to us
<br />but somehow I feel so sad today
<br />It's not about you going away
<br /><br />among the rooftop trees
<br />sky is wet &amp; grey
<br />I know you can live without me
<br />whispers in the breeze
<br /><br />Is it really me writing this to you
<br />maybe it's the real but only a part of me
<br />Is it the real you writing this to me
<br />maybe it's all lies
<br />but it's alright
<br /><br />along the line on the wall
<br />linking to your heart
<br />does it end if I pull the plug
<br />how true in words
<br /><br />among the rooftop stains
<br />buds sprout from the dust
<br />I know you can live without me
<br />whistle in the breeze

<br />I can't find the love I want 
<br />Someone better slap me 
<br />Before I start to rust 
<br />Before I start to decompose 
<br />Looking in my rearview mirror 
<br />Looking in my rearview mirror 
<br />I can make it disappear 
<br />I can make it disappear 
<br />Have no fear 
<br /><br />I like pleasure spiked with pain and 
<br />Music is my aeroplane 
<br />It's my aeroplane 
<br />Songbird sweet and sour Jane and 
<br />Music is my aeroplane 
<br />It's my aeroplane 
<br />Pleasure spiked with pain 
<br />That motherfucker's always spiked with pain 
<br /><br />Sitting in my kitchen, hey girl 
<br />I'm turning into dust again 
<br />My melancholy baby 
<br />The star of mazzy must 
<br />Push her voice inside of me 
<br />I'm overcoming gravity 
<br />I'm overcoming gravity 
<br />It's easy when you're sad to be 
<br />It's easy when you're sad, sad like me 
<br /><br />Just one note 
<br />Could make me float 
<br />Could make me float away 
<br />One note from 
<br />The song she wrote 
<br />Could fuck me where I lay 
<br />Just one note 
<br />Could make me choke 
<br />One note that's 
<br />Not a lie 
<br />Just one note 
<br />Could cut my throat 
<br />One note could make me die 
<br /><br />Song: Aeroplane
