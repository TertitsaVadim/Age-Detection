We have to make a concerted effort to incorporate more exercise into the daily routine of our families.  The proof is there for those who are willing to see it.  We are too busy to make meals so instead we make a drive-thru run, pick up more movies than we can watch in a night and then wonder why we have to shop in the plus sized department.  <br /><br />Biking: Fun For Everyone <br /><br />When you have access to a nearby bike trail, biking is a great way to spend time with the family and get in your daily exercise at the same time.  There are a few precautions to consider though:  Go over safety rules so each member of the family knows what to expect and how to behave on the trail.  Be sure to have everyone properly fitted for a helmet and age appropriate seating for the youngsters who be the passengers of other riders, whether in an individual baby seat or in a trailer that accommodates several children. <br /><br />Family Fitness Feud <br /><br />One great way to have fun with exercising is to invite a neighboring family to a friendly competition.  We all know a neighbor that thinks they have to &quot;one-up&quot; all of the other neighbors on the street.  Wouldn't it be great fun to beat them in a weekly competition where the whole family can participate?  Compete for bragging rights or for a fun outing at the loser's expense. <br /><br />Backyard Olympics - Family Style <br /><br />You can have a Frisbee throw, target practice with squirt guns, jump rope and run around the outside of the house a predetermined number of times.  Walk across a 2X4 like a balance beam, toss tennis balls into a bucket and see who can do the most jumping jacks.  Then put them altogether to create an obstacle course.  Whatever you choose to set up for the family, make sure that all members can participate and have a good time doing it. <br /><br />Free Play and Team Sports <br /><br />Team sports are a great way to learn unity, trust and the rules of the game.  Don't hesitate to participate, too, by coaching or covering for the coach during practice.  If your kids see you having fun, they will want to get out and exercise too.  Don't discount the benefit of impulsive, boisterous play.  Swim, catch lightening bugs, throw the football and roll down a hill.  Skip stones across the creek, and hike through a national forest.  If you can do it as a family and have fun, then get out and do it. <br /><br />To read additional information on <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.personalizedbeachtowels.org%2Fbeach-towels-clearance%2Findex.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.personalizedbeachtowels.org/beach-towels-clearance/index.html</a>  make sure you see <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.personalizedbeachtowels.org%2Fbeach-towels-clearance%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.personalizedbeachtowels.org/beach-towels-clearance/</a> .

If you've ever watched a good detective movie you know that it's the little things that tell the most about a person's character. Your house should, of course, pertain to your likes and dislikes, and reflect your characteristics. But instead of going broke over decking out your house in finery, you can choose awesome home accessories without breaking the bank.<br /><br />Take a step back. Examine your life and the style in which you live it. Maybe you spend a lot of time outside, or perhaps you entertain lots of guests. If you do, examine if they are loud and wild parties or if they're more simple events. The ages of your children will make a difference as well, especially if you have toddlers. All of these factors contribute to how you should set up your decor.<br /><br />Think of how carefully you put together an outfit to make sure certain pieces match and blend. In the same way, a room should reflect your personal uniqueness. Rooms are like people in the sense that they tell a story. Whatever your room looks like will likely tell a story about you, and thus this is a reflection for any visiting friends or relatives.<br /><br />Color. It's everywhere. Pick your favorite color. How you paint the walls of a room will create a certain mood and actually influence the mood that you're in. When you're outgoing and lively, then brighter colors are probably your forte. Oranges, yellows, bright greens and blues are probably right up your alley. On the other hand, for the more reserved, you might prefer mellower colors like brown and white.<br /><br />Furniture also says a lot about a person. Rounded, old fashioned pieces practically shout about you being laid-back, while sharp edged, modern pieces lend a hand to a more energetic vibe. Choose pieces that are also practical. You don't want a little toddler playing around sharp-edged furniture, and neither do you want to set out glass figurines where he might reach them.<br /><br />There are lots of easy, cheap ways to improve the look of a room. You don't have to spend any money, you just have to use a little creativity. For example, it's possible your kitchen is looking a little drab. Add a new tablecloth and a vase of flowers - real or fake - and some place mats. You'll be surprised how much this brightens things. Paint the trim around windows or put up pictures that have been placed in the attic for years.<br /><br />The possibilities are endless. The smallest things can brighten up an entire house, and at the same time, tell the story of you.<br /><br />To read more about <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.personalizedbeachtowels.org%2Fbeach-towels-clearance%2Findex.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.personalizedbeachtowels.org/beach-towels-clearance/index.html</a>  please visit <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.personalizedbeachtowels.org%2Fbeach-towels-clearance%2Findex.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.personalizedbeachtowels.org/beach-towels-clearance/index.html</a> .

Summer is a great time to let everyone sit outside and relax in the warm air so you will have a great time with your friends and family at any casual outdoor event that you throw. You could do some grilling or simply just sit outside and enjoy the great weather. <br /><br />Here are some steps you can take to make sure that your next outdoor event is a great one.<br /><br />1. Make sure that the area you use to gather outdoors is a visually appealing one without tall weeds or grass and with clean furniture that people will want to sit in.<br />2. You should always have a look at the weather report before your event to make sure that everything checks out. If everything looks good, send and e-vite to all of your friends early enough so that they can make plans.<br />3. If it is overbearingly hot outside, make sure to provide umbrellas or some manner of shade.<br />4. Use 2 separate trash cans with one being used for recycling only.<br />5. You will want to provide a cooler or some other container that will be a great place to store drinks and you will want to have a couple of different locations that these drinks can be stored.<br />6. Now would be a great time to bust out the grill and turn this outdoor get together into a barbecue. Make sure to take all food preparation precautions!<br />7. Make sure that you have more than enough chairs so that no one will be left uncomfortably sitting on the ground. If you do not like the aesthetics of some chairs, drape elegant cloths over them.<br />8. Create an outdoor buffet by bringing in a large folding table where you can keep food, napkins, plates, utensils, etc. Having a table will also give you the chance to decorate it.<br />9. You will want to have sunscreen, bug spray and other similar things available for your guests. Also make sure to have plenty of cold water available.<br />10. If you have a pool and are hosting a pool party, make sure that there is always an adult that is supervising the area.<br />11. Bring out the speakers so you can listen to someone's iPod.<br />12. Make sure that the menu you plan is easy to prepare, yet quite satisfying.<br />13. Most of all remember to have fun with your friends! <br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thoughts.com%2Fgina4beach%2Foutdoor-exercising-for-the-entire-family"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.thoughts.com/gina4beach/outdoor-exercising-for-the-entire-family</a> ,
