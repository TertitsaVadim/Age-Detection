<br /><br />SEO in Charlotte NC offers some interesting opportunities. Doing a search in the search engines will return numerous results for companies that claim to provide SEO services in Charlotte. But let’s dig a little deeper and look at these companies and the services they provide.<br /><br />At first glance you will notice that many website development companies also have a page optimized on their website for SEO, and on that page, they talk about the SEO services that they provide when they deliver your new website. That should be the first red flag for you right there because SEO is not an event, it is a process. SEO is not “done” and then forgotten, it is a daily task that is tweaked on a regular basis on a consistent and continual basis.<br /><br />What these website companies call SEO really is nothing more than some well-placed text in key areas of the website – the meta tags in the source code. These tags define the website when the search engines “spider” the website. While on the surface t

<br /><br />Carolina SEO Services is located in the beautiful Lake Norman area of Charlotte, NC. This area is home to numerous small-to-medium sized companies which could benefit from the SEO services that we provide.<br /><br />Most small businesses have a website that was put up and then basically forgotten. In many cases these websites never had any SEO “done” on them. Likely, there has been no new content added and the websites are simply collecting cyber dust. And the business owners wonder why they are not getting any traffic.<br /><br />One business owner recently told us that the only traffic to their website are from people that already know them. As we began to look into their website it was very obvious why. Web developers are great at developing at websites, but are not usually very good at implementing SEO. The result is too many websites that are sitting idly by with no organic traffic.

<br /><br />There are good options to consider when selecting a Charlotte SEO company for SEO services with your company's website. While most of these SEO providers in Charlotte and surrounding areas also do webdesign, there are a few &quot;pure&quot; search engine optimization agencies. Carolina SEO Services is an example of a Charlotte SEO company that concentrates only on SEO.<br /><br />Why is this important? Well, first of all doing SEO one-time when the website is developed is not nearly enough to achieve top search engine rankings. And that is what most website developers do when they design a new website. They put a few loosely-defined keywords in the meta tags, submit the site to the search engines and call that SEO.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the unsuspecting website owner sits back and waits for traffic to come to their website. They wait days, weeks, and months and still there is no traffic. The website looks great and it has great content but the search engines do not even know it exists.

<br /><br />One of the most famous things about Lake Norman is that the area is at the epicenter of NASCAR. Mooresville, NC which is one of five towns that border Lake Norman is known as &quot;Race City USA&quot;. Many of the NASCAR drivers live on Lake Norman along with thousands of other people that are linked to NASCAR's sprawling business.<br /><br />Because of NASCAR's presence here, there are hundreds of companies that offer products and services to the race industry. While the Lake Norman area has definitely suffered during the economic crisis, the race industry has somewhat sheltered a good part of the industrial base.

<br /><br />How much SEO costs should be a concern for any company that is considering an SEO project. But the reality is that what SEO costs is probably a lot less expensive that what it costs not to do SEO. Let me explain …<br /><br />Let’s say that you are my buddy John who owns a heavy equipment sales rep firm where the average sale might be $3000 with good profit margins. They have a very successful 30+ year old business and have been doing business with the same customers for many years. But lately there is new competition from internet marketers selling the same products online and John is now starting to get squeezed out of some of the deals he used to always win.

Some companies rely on their website developer, some companies try to do the SEO themself, and others look to outsource SEO services to a reputable search engine optimization firm. The benefits of outsourcing SEO are many and we will discuss some of them later in this article.<br /><br />The traditional view of SEO is that it is a technical issue and should be turned over to and managed by a technical staff. Nothing could be further from the truth as SEO is much more of a marketing issue than it is a technical issue. Yes there are some technical aspects that need to be managed, but search engine optimization is all about branding your website for the keyword terms that your potential clients are searching to find your website.

<br /><br />Higher search engine placement - every internet marketer with a website wants to achieve that goal. Unfortunately, most have no clue about how to make it happen.<br /><br />Whether it is a small-to-medium business, or an individual internet marketer there are too many instances of beautiful websites that are collected dust and getting no traffic. In fact, the majority of websites get no meaningful daily website traffic and our definition of meaningful is simple - that there is enough traffic to make the website a profitable venture.<br /><br />Internet techies talk about search engine optimization and click through rates and other technical jargon. This only confuses the issue even further for most small business owners because all they want is more traffic from new prospects who want to buy their products or services. They could care less about the technical aspects of SEO that the so called experts get caught up with, these business owners just want results from higher search engine placement.

But companies who see SEO as only a way to get higher search engine placement are missing the point. There is much more than just high rankings, it is also about identifying your company's online presence that will build your online visibility.<br /><br />Perhaps using the term SEO is not the right approach when discussing internet marketing, because SEO has such a technical tone to it that makes some people feel uncomfortable. Business owners are looking for solutions to their business problems, and they never invest in something that they do not understand. Our experience with SEO is that the majority of people are confused about search engine optimization and do not understand what it does or how it works - and therein lies the difficulty of getting business owners to buy an SEO project.

There could literally be hundreds if not thousands of websites going after the same market that you are so it comes down to, who has the better optimized website. And to beat your competition for having the best optimized website you have to understand what your competitors are doing with their website.

<br /><br />In this post we are going to start from the beginning and provide an overview of the Veretekk gold system.<br /><br />This blog is dedicated specifically to the Veretekk platinum control panel, but to properly grasp the power it provides, you must first understand how much value the Veretekk gold system provides. Keep in mind that the platinum control panel allows you to host up to 20+ gold systems. The result is a powerful internet marketing tool which provides seamless internet marketing, promoting and advertising capabilities.<br /><br />So what is the gold system? First, the Veretekk system was originally developed over fourteen years ago and there is nothing like it on the market. We like to call it the merging of singularities which means that our tool set provides all the internet marketing tools under one product umbrella. For the small sum of only $54.95 per month the Veretekk gold system provides tremendous value.

<br /><br />The internet is quickly replacing other forms of printed media such as newspapers, magazines, newsletters, etc. It is natural then that online advertising costs continue to rise because of the ubiquitous nature of the internet – it is basically impossible to avoid as the internet is now everywhere you turn. Whether it is in business systems, on our mobile phones or hotspots all over city landscapes, the internet is available at every turn.<br /><br />Advertisers wants to spend their money where the people are getting their information. At one time in the not so distant past, that meant traditional print, radio and television advertising because that is where the eyeballs were. For example, in today’s world newspapers and magazines are reporting lower circulation rates and are seeing their advertising rates dwindle – advertisers do not want to continue spending top advertising dollars where they do not get a positive return on investment.

<br /><br />Most new internet marketers come into the business with little idea on what it takes to be successful with an online business. Unfortunately, most believe that just throwing up a well-designed website is all that it takes and people will come charging to their website.<br /><br />Those that have been in the business for awhile understand that nothing could be further than the truth. The fact is, putting up a website is the easy part, just about anyone can take the standard WordPress tool, buy a pretty template and have a good looking website overnight (assuming that WordPress is the platform they choose). But that is where the hard part of internet marketing begins – building the online presence of the website and building notoriety in the search engines.

<br /><br />Small businesses are at a disadvantage when it comes to internet marketing and must be more innovative than larger companies to establish a presence. That is because larger companies have more brand awareness and get a lot of web traffic just from the brand identity of going to bigcompanyname.com.<br /><br />Small business companies meanwhile have to rely on the search engines for the traffic they get to their website. For companies that have a good search engine marketing program in place this is not a problem. But the majority of small businesses have never done any marketing on the internet and as a result, get very little traffic.

<br /><br />The Veretekk Platinum Control Panel SEO Drill is a very useful tool for SEO purposes.<br /><br />The Platinum Control Panel SEO drill is similar to the drill in the Veretekk gold systems which submits “ads” into 1-family classifieds.<br /><br />The big difference of the Platinum Control Panel SEO drill is that the “ads” are placed into the numerous SEO portals. The benefit is that you have backlinks coming from multiple domains, all of which are aged and are highly ranked by Google.

<br /><br />The Veretekk Platinum Control Panel Page Maker tool is one of the SEO tools and can be found under the &quot;Tools&quot; menu.<br /><br />The Platinum Control Panel Page Maker utility allows you to create HTML pages using whatever content you want to create. You can assign a keyword relevant file name and upload it to any of the 42 Veretekk Traffic Portal domains that comes with each Gold system under the Veretekk Platinum Control Panel.<br /><br />This effectively provides you with a very broad footprint to create and activate an unlimited number of individual webpages on the Traffic Portals of any Gold system you control. So in a Platinum Control Panel system with 20 gold systems, each of which have 42 traffic portals, gives 840 domains where you can create unlimited free pages. Think about the search engine power of all those unique backlinks pointing back to your website.

<br /><br />Building back links is something that flusters a lot of internet marketers because they understand how important it is to do this exercise, but they do not know how to go about building them. Many internet marketers buy links, but buying links can become quite expensive and does not really provide a good long term solution.<br /><br />A better approach is to find a linkbuilding tool that automates the process and allows you to build high volumes of back links very easily. We are very much in favor of helping internet marketers control their own destiny instead of repeatedly purchasing services that they could do themselves.

<br /><br />One of the best things that can be done for an online business is to engage in high quality link building. Doing this on a long term, consistent basis provides high search engine rankings for just about any keyword term that is targeted. <br /><br />After all, Google has openly stated that the number one factor in gaining search engine rankings is the number of keyword relevant links pointing back to a website. This translates simply into one thing - high quality link building is where all the effort should be for anyone that is wanting to implement an online advertising and marketing program. <br /><br />The problem is that most internet marketers do not know what that means or how to go about getting it done.

And it causes many questions to be asked, such as what does &quot;high quality backlinks&quot; mean, where do you find them, what can you do to get them, etc.<br /><br />Well, the best answer we have found for getting high quality backlinks is the Veretekk Platinum Control Panel which provides a robust set of tools for search engine marketing that allows business owners to gain notoriety in the search engines for their website.

<br /><br />Getting high search engine rankings is not an easy task. Besides taking a lot of hard work in producing content and building backlinks, it all starts with finding the best keywords. And that requires having a good SEO keywords tool for the necessary research that is the basic foundation of any SEO program.<br /><br />There are numerous keyword tools on the market and most do an admirable job of providing various methods of looking at keyword search results. What is interesting, is that almost all of them take their own unique approach to analyzing the search data.

<br /><br />How to get backlinks is one of the most perplexing questions for most internet marketers and the industry is rife with false information and false claims about the best method. Most of these methods involve spamming, or other methods that are simply outdated and do not work effectively.<br /><br />For example, there are numerous tools available that allow automated blog comment posting as a preferred method to build high quality backlinks. But there are a couple of problems with this method because it is basically nothing more than spamming other blogs’ comments with a bunch of worthless, non-sensical information. Most of these comments get caught in the blog spam blocker and never get approved anyway, so it is a waste of time and effort.

<br /><br />In our opinion, many internet marketers make a common mistake of leaving the back link building process up to so called “link building sites”. And this is often done at a price that is sometimes overly expensive without a corresponding value for the investment.<br /><br />You can see ads all over the place – PR5 links for $150, or PR3 links for $79. But that should raise red flags concerning what does that really mean, and better yet, what does that get you for the investment.<br /><br />From our experience, it does not get you a whole lot. For example, let’s look at some popular link building sites that are advertised on the Warrior Forum which is quickly becoming a cesspool of spammers and carnival barkers. On that site you will often see ads from “Angela’s backlinks” where you can subscribe to get monthly updates from Angela on where to build links.
