<br />It can lead to creation or destruction
<br />Watch what you desire and your belief system
<br />Churn them in the mind, spirit and soul
<br />if you can digest it stay with it
<br />If not spit it out....
<br /><br />I have been bitten by the serpent
<br />I have died and descended into hell
<br />but the dawn of the third day came 
<br />after three years
<br />Now I ascend into heaven because
<br />I am a child of miracle,
<br />the chosen... the destined
<br />I AM WHO I AM Gods shadow
<br />YHVH
<br /><br />Hmm...
<br />Finally the silence is broken
<br />The walls of Jericho is fallen
<br />The mist is cleared,
<br />The darkness has veered 
<br />from my path, from my face
<br />Life's curtain is raised
<br />And life is radiant like a beautiful interlocked lace

<br />To scream out loud to the heavens and beyond
<br /><br />Today I visited ''a whole new world''
<br />A new fantastic point of view.
<br />My body tingles with remembrance
<br />The shivers run through like a cream of 
<br />chocolate dripping down the side of a pie
<br />My soul quivers with thoughts of your hands 
<br />running through every curve of my skin
<br /><br />Your eyes, they speak volumes to me
<br />A language only for nourishing my essence
<br />No don't stop! Just keep loving me.
<br />Let your soul meet mine in a place
<br />where no one can tell us no
<br />where to stop, or say we are only dreaming.
<br />A whole new world
<br /><br />A place for the essence of the soul
<br />and every tingling particle of our being
<br />I choose to be happy in the now
<br />then and forever. I will lift up my soul
<br />to the heavens and sing with a resounding voice
<br />How great is art the works of thy hands.
<br />For your mind is the essence from whence I came.
<br /><br />I AM Who I Am! A Creature of Light.

<br />Thoughts swarm through the labyrinth of my mind.
<br /><br />Like the Myth, &quot;Who is John Galt?&quot; 
<br />I asked myself. Who is Hoselita?
<br /><br />I thought about the space I dissolve into.
<br />I am nobody, I am nothing. Yet “I Am”
<br /><br />Who Am I? Why do I get so tired ever so often?
<br />The space I dissolve into fills me with . . . nothing,
<br />Live Anew?
<br /><br />What do I do? Where do I start from?
<br />Who can give a reason to all my unanswered questions?
<br /><br />Success seems to elude me.
<br />What could I be doing wrong or not doing?
<br /><br />I must really lack imagination and commitment but then again... 
<br />&quot;The Content Of Your Thought And Personal Belief&quot;.
<br />(<a href="http://en.facebox.com/isisneptune/blog/blogid=74184" target="_blank">http://en.facebox.com/isisneptune/blog/blogid=7...</a>) 
<br /><br />Thus... where do I go from here?
<br />&quot;Must I Weep For Reason and Effect&quot;
<br /><br />I know I must pass through the jungle.
<br />The jungle from whence I originated
<br />and thither shall I pass.
<br /><br />As I pass through the many faceted gems of life,
<br />absorbing the different fragrance of experiences;
<br />I begin to understand that &quot;mans existence is
<br />A reflection of what he thinks&quot;
<br /><br />This is the full dawn of reality.
<br />I must supersede myself.
<br />My limit is no where in sight.
<br />I know I can reach as far as my mind can fathom.
<br />And that far I must reach.
<br /><br />I am willing to drop all attitude that negates growth
<br />one at a time or maybe one a week
<br /><br />Successful I have to become
<br />And Fear I shall drop. 
<br /><br />Oh yes Fear, of things that are not,
<br />except imagined by the weakness of the mind.
<br />Strength I must seek, from the source whence it comes
<br /><br />And then she Spoke . . .
<br />I Am In The Light From The Shadow of me

<br /><br />Growth is all we need in the different aspects of our life but &quot;Everybody wants to be somebody, nobody wants to grow.&quot; - Johann W. von Goethe
<br /><br />It has been said that growth provides the only measure for the existence of life, yet tumors grow and seek to snuff out the life of their host. Better, then, to think of this process we call growth as more than a measure. In the course of growing our businesses, the term &quot;maturity&quot; might be a better fit. Do you ever think of the maturity of your business? Are you maturing as you grow?
<br /><br />I can say I have grown and still in maturation. What about you?

<br />Copyright © Hoselita Ikoli
<br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ErrandConcierge.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.ErrandConcierge.com</a>
<br /><br />To succeed in any online business, you must be seen to offer an essential service.
<br />I thought I should summarize the above statement from my online experience and give you something nobody ever says online.
<br /><br />I know a lot of us love to read in bullets or numbers to get the gist at a glance, so I would just do that since I am a lazy writer.
<br /><br />1. Everybody operates the Internet as a game of numbers. Just reach as much people as possible, market your money making product, get the money and no proper training outline and little or no support.
<br /><br />2. You log unto a site and the curse of technology overwhelms you both mentally and psychologically. You are practically suffocating in piles and piles of information that leads to yet another labyrinth and you begin to believe that you are really in the spider’s snare and it tentacles are about to go round your body. Well I felt like that, ever in a myriad because of lack of proper organisation of the training centers of some of these programs plus, slow support response or total lack of response except you get response from autoresponders.(machines)
<br /><br />• Good News to You. I just found an Exciting place where the training is superb. If you are an Internet Dummy like me. Then the PlugInProfitSite is your bet. It teaches you step by step method of incorporating a lot of money making ventures and ideas together.
<br /><br />3. Anyway, How frustrating can that be? Your questions on support issues not properly answered. Nowhere to really go from there... To crown it all it looks like you have to always go through a short course to get somewhere which might later be nowhere.
<br />What next…
<br /><br />What They Aren’t Saying- about Your Online Business
<br /><br />1. It as serious as any other business you really want to develop and grow, especially long-term focus.
<br /><br />2. The growth rate you desire will be determined by your basic knowledge of the internet as well as the amount of effort and time you put into it.
<br /><br />3. You must always learn to be focused. Your dreams and your goals must be clearly defined and kept in clear focus.
<br /><br />4. No pain no gain. (If you learn to enjoy the work you do, you will always look forward to spending time on it. The time and effort you invest in your business should not be an incidence).
<br /><br />5. Look before You Leap. Research all business ideas and programs for consistency before you plunge into it. Good programs are usually designed for beginners since the Gurus already know their way around. If you are a beginner and you can’t find your way around a program, chances are that it is not meant for you.
<br /><br />These are great sites that give you your money’s worth and much more . . .
<br /><br />These are great sites that give you your money’s worth and much more . . .
<br /><br />PlugInProfitSite - Great for Beginners
<br />Empowerism - Great for Beginners
<br />SFI marketing - Free Membership
<br />Traffic Swarm - Free Membership
<br />IMC – – Free Membership
<br /><br />The 5 programs above are a synergy to one another so that you get a well-rounded lesson about online business.
<br /><br />6. If per chance you are still reading this then it is safe to assume that you are probably thinking about an online business. Perhaps you probably want to visit Stone Evans the PlugInProfitSite Guy to learn all you need to know about Online Success.
<br />It is better to save about $600 - $1,000 before embarking on your online or offline business which can yield more than that in a month’s time given the proper guidance and support
<br /><br />7. But for your business to grow, You Must Advertise. The degree of advertisement will determine the extent of your growth.
<br />For advert an average of $500 is needed for a starter
<br /><br />8. You can be rest assured that I went through the hard way to get here? Before you join any program you must learn to look at the smaller prints. Read everything on the website. Website should be easy to navigate.
<br /><br />If you do things the shortcut method, expect to get short term results.
<br /><br />There Are No Shortcuts ! ! !
<br /><br />9. You must be open minded and ready to learn everyday.
<br /><br />10. For Online Business Start-Up, like any other business you must invest a lot of time and effort. From my experience, a novice going through the right process of learning Online Business will need a minimum of 1-3 months to start making money online. This income will cover all expenses and yield dividends: 10 times greater about only a month - 3 months: provided you have all the Online support you need.
<br /><br />11. Online support should not take more than 24 hours. After acknowledgment, expect to get a reply. Tops, 3 days.
<br /><br />12. Be prepared to test new strategies when your business starts growing.
<br />Be adventurous but cautious.
<br /><br />13. Are you ready to maintain the discipline of being your own boss?
<br />NOBODY IS WATCHING YOU... That takes a lot of discipline.
<br /><br />14. HOW DETERMINED ARE YOU?
<br /><br />The list can go on and on but I would like to defer to some other time.
<br />I hope to see you soon.

<br />The Home Biz Guy             <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.pluginprofitsite.com%2Fmain-14760%2Fdotcomology.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.pluginprofitsite.com/main-14760/dotcomology.html</a>
<br />Author of Dotcomology - The Science of making Money Online
<br /><br />These days, it seems like everyone wants to work from home and make money on the Internet. But before you even turn on your computer, the first question you have to ask yourself is whether you’re cut out for this kind of work.
<br /><br />The fact is, building a home-based business isn’t for everyone. Some people like the commute. They really do enjoy having a boss who tells them what to do, and they like the routine of working nine-to-five for an ordinary salary that can barely pay the mortgage. Personally, I think they’re nuts.
<br /><br />More reasonably, there are people who are 
<br />concerned about the risk of starting up their own business. They’re not sure it’s worth the 
<br />investment of time and money, and they’re scared of the responsibility that comes with running their own company. They wonder if there is another way to escape the rat race.
<br /><br />I’m sure there is. You could win the lottery or 
<br />wait for your Aunt Sue to keel over and leave you her condo. Or maybe you could sit down with a pen and paper and draw the blueprint for &quot;The Next Big Thing&quot;. Anything can happen... Right?
<br /><br />For me, what happened was creating a successful, self-running Internet marketing system. It didn’t happen without effort. It didn’t happen without at least some initial investment of both time and money and, of course, it doesn’t happen now without me making sure that the taxes are filed 
<br />and the paperwork is done. But it happened.
<br /><br />I’m my own boss. I work from home according to my own schedule and I get to pocket all the cash my business makes. If you’re prepared to give an e-business the time, the work and the money it needs to get started and get growing, it can happen for you too.

<br /><br />So what do you do when you have to throw your best foot forward when all you want to do is to wallow in self pity, procrastinate, and just be nothing.
<br /><br />My behavior lately is to put things off till the last moment, thinking there is alway time. Avoid doing it and carry the same to-do-list everyday. Boy who am I fooling!
<br /><br />But today was different for me. Why? search me! All I know is that something snapped inside of me and I knew I am absolutely finished with negative state of mind. At least, for now. I'd had enough and it was time to move on and make changes.
<br /><br />What did I do?
<br /><br />Sitting in front of the mirror with my dairy spread in front of me, I  started writing out all the negative thoughts that I attributed to my bad mood. There were about 14 pity guest feasting in my moment of weakness.
<br /><br />Mine! What is the solution then. I just rephrased all the negative thoughts to their POSITIVE ASPECTS. 
<br /><br />&quot;I AM&quot; AND &quot;I WILL&quot; AND &quot;I CAN&quot;.
<br /><br />Half way through the solutions my mind was crystal clear. I could feel even the tiniest vibrations of my being. I was bursting with excitement. My mood was uplifted. I started to remember who I am and what I am capable of creating. I am not crazy about the fact that it is so easy to forget who I am, but I am enthralled with the transformation anytime I remember.
<br /><br />Do you know what I found out? 
<br /><br />There are two scenarios that are always present anytime I find myself in a sorry state situation.
<br /><br />1.I do not take time for myself to meditate and order my day.
<br />2. I've gotten caught up in other peoples dramas and negativity until it feels like my own.
<br /><br />Take away those two scenarios and I return to being a joy-seeking, life-celebrating creative person. And I will bet everyone reading this can relate one way or the other. I will bet you can think of at least one behavior that, when added to or subtracted from your daily life, changes your entire perspective.
<br /><br />Primarily, I wanted to remind you that you are not alone. Everyone experiences foul mood. Even those people we  associate with positive energy and success. We all have moment, days, weeks or months that make us ask, &quot;why bother?&quot; It is part of our human nature to forget who we are. But forgeting only makes remembering that much sweeter.
<br /><br />Hail and Hearty
