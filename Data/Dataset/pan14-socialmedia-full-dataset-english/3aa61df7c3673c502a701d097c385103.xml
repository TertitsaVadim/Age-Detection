<br />  By May 4, I have done fifty hours of physical activities, these activities include yoga  exercises, aerobics  dancing, Pilates, climbing mountains and walking. These activities lead me to a healthy physical and mental condition.
<br />First of all, I will talk about yoga exercises. Because I’m a little bit hunchback, mum told me to do some exercises, and I went to gymnasium in Nanjing University to do yoga exercises. This was my first time to do it, so I was a little stressful and nervous, However, after I experienced this, I felt relaxed and comfortable, I learned that I should be a competitor against myself .If I could win myself, I could overcome any difficulty. Yoga exercises gave me an excellent chance to challenge myself. Through the exercises, I enjoyed the great benefits. First, I can improve my body flexibility. Second, it can accelerate blood circulation and prevent diseases. In addition, it leads me a positive attitude towards life and set my mind at rest .Through the yoga exercises, I learned a lot and I tried to change my imperfect lifestyle and diet. What I learned have connections with my experience. I learned what I should do, so I have abundant experience for my future. I think yoga exercises are an excellent way to keep healthy.
<br />Next, I will talk about aerobics dancing, I also do this exercises in Nanjing University gymnasium. Same as yoga exercises ,this exercises could also improve my body flexibility and accelerate blood circulation .However, it still have differences, Unlike yoga exercises, aerobics dancing is more vigorous and energetic, Through the aerobics dancing, I could improve bad physical conditions ,thus to  form a exquisite manner, Furthermore ,I can relieve mental pressure and make me feel relaxed. When I was dancing, I diverted my attention form worries, I forgot frustration, instead, I enjoyed the happiness of dancing, I felt relaxed and delighted .In addition ,I can make friends with more people, this can broaden my horizon, I danced with others, we encouraged with each other and had fun together. Therefore, I can both improve my physical health and enjoy great fun.
<br />  Then I will talk about walking, climbing and Pilates. Pilates is a kind of exercises which is very similar to yoga exercises. However, I prefer yoga exercises to Pilates. Besides, I often walked home after school and climbing Purple Mountain on Sundays. It took me about twenty minutes to walk home. In my opinion, walking is a good way to keep health. I still remember that I walked home after school in winter. Before I walked, I felt cold .However, after I walked for twenty minutes, I felt warm, and this is very good for my health. On Sundays, I climbed Purple Mountain with my father. Climbing is also a good way to keep healthy. Through climbing for hours, I broke into a sweat and this can prevent a cold effectively. During climbing, I got enough physical exercises and relax myself. Besides, I could also enjoy the beautiful views of the mountain and tempered my will. Now it’s easy to see that there are lots of advantages of climbing.
<br />Honestly, doing physical exercises brought me numerous benefits. through exercises ,I got ninety-five  percent in physical Education of Term 3.I have never thought  I could got a such high grade in Physical Education. Therefore, the achievement encourages me to put more efforts and made more progress.

<br />I interviewed an excellent art professional, Ms. Hadley, on March 24. As many people know that Ms. Hadley is an art teacher. She teaches us Grade 10 Art curriculum, she is a quite kind and humorous teacher.
<br />As an art teacher, her job involves many duties, such as preparing lessons, quizzes, exams; valuating 150 students; teaching British Columbia curriculum and so forth.
<br />Another question is “How did you first get started in your job”, when I asked her this question, she told me her experience in childhood. When she was young, she wrote that I would like to study art in the future in her diary. However, she had no idea if she could be a teacher. After she got the Bachelor of Fine Arts, she went to India for six months. Suddenly she knew that she would be a teacher, and then she got the Bachelor of Education, after that, she became an art teacher.
<br />During the interview, Ms. Hadley felt relaxed and was willing to talk with me. In her opinions, there were many benefits of working the field of art, such as happiness, freedom, interesting, good for brain, salary and the most significant is, it was her dream. Then she told me her favorite artist. He is R. B. Kitaj. He is a painter and a printmaker and was born in Britain. His work were a little bit abstract and strange, but not totally abstract. This artist is quite good at printmaking, and Ms. Hadley also loves printmaking.
<br />She told me a few things she enjoyed afterwards. One of them is Free Hug. She said that it was one of her most wonderful experiences. Before, she had seen this but never tried. On March 13, Ms. Hadley and some of students first tried this activity at Gulou square. I also took part in it. We held a “Free Hug” board and stood there, if anyone wanted a free hug, we would give him/her a hug. This activity was very successful, and Ms. Hadley appreciated it a lot. Furthermore, she also enjoyed her students, she considered her students as gifts given by God. This was a really high valuation. In addition, when I asked her something interesting during the job, she said that when she asked “Is your brain empty” and one student said No. She thought it surprised her and stimulated her into greater efforts. 
<br />Finally, when I asked what one of the challenges she faced in her job was, she told me a real story when she taught a boy. That boy was very strange, and he was extremely thin, Ms. Hadley said his leg was almost half width of her leg. However, the boy was very good at art; he could create quite excellent works. Ms. Hadley gave him very high valuation of his works, but when she talked with the boy about his health, the boy was not willing to face the serious problem. Therefore, Ms. Hadley talked to other teachers and wanted to help the boy out of poor health condition. In fact, this kind of things is not her responsibility; from here we see that Ms. Hadley is a quite kind teacher.
<br />Through the interview, I gained lots of precious things, I gain specific career-related information, and I gained interview experience. Moreover, I interviewed with a person who has a job I am quite interested in. In conclusion, this was a marvelous experience for me.

<br />On June12, I went to enjoy the Shanghai expo with hundreds of students and several teachers. I was so excited and delighted before the trip. In a word, I desired a wonderful and unforgettablel experience.
<br /><br />Spending about four hours on the bus, I arrived at Shanghai expo. I was astonished by huge crowds of people walking towards the expo when I got off the bus. The crowds seemed constantly and would never end. Then, I became a member of the huge crowds.
<br /><br />After I entered the gate, I was free. My friends Carol and Jessica, along with me, visited pavilions all by ourselves. At the beginning, we visited Lithuania. Then we visited Croatia, Switzerland, Belarus, Cyprus, San Marino, Cambodia, Philippines, Brunei Darussalam, Republic of Moldova and Cuba. Finally, we visited the Chile pavilion. Personally, I held that Chile pavilion was the best of all the pavilions I visited. Chile experienced an earthquake this year. However, the country did not give up. Through the pavilion, I saw that Chile was trying to recover form the disaster. Inside the pavilion, there were videos showing what the functions of cities. The videos caused people to think deeply about Chile. Besides, there were some photo shows. However, the most interesting and attractive thing is the “inversion”. In a room, all the things were inversing on the ceiling. They did not fall down on the ground. The scene really surprised me a lot. 
<br /><br />Althrough there was a sea of people visiting the expo, I still felt satisfied and delighted. Through the trip, my horizons was broaden. Furthermore, I experienced an amazing and fantastic expo.

<br />During this summer holiday, I went to swim with my mother at the sports center of Nanjing University. Through swimming regularly, I gained a lot that I could not learn from classes.
<br /><br />Actually, I did not swim for a long time before this summer. I was afraid of swimming because my ears were not comfortable after swimming. Therefore, at the beginning, when my mother suggested me to swim, I felt unhappy and unwilling. However, I went to swim after hearing my mother’s persuasion. Although I was still a little bit displeased, I did not give up.
<br /><br />I remembered when I first went into the swimming pool,. I felt cold and did not want to move. After playing the water for awhile with my mum, I felt better and tried to swim for a short distance. Surprisely, I could still remember how to swim. My mother appreciated my performance, then I encouraged my mother to have a try. To my surprise, my mother swam not bad. On the first day, we swam for about one hour. In fact, we swam for an hour almost every time. 
<br /><br />Through swimming, I learnt a lot during the process. I learnt the importance of perseverance. Same as swimming, doing anything else also requires perseverance. No matter how difficult and tough it is, we should persist and keep trying it. For instance, when I swam in the pool, there were lots of people in it. On the contrary, I kept swimming and practising instead of sitting there. I kept healthy through persisting swimming. 
<br /><br />In addition, my physical health also benefits a lot. After swimming for an hour, I felt relaxed and released my pressure. In this case, I can pay more attention to things I want to do. I feel energetic instead of feeling sleepy and tired. This is an obvious advantage. 
<br /><br />To sum up, swimming is an excellent way to keep healthy. Besides, I obtained lots of knowledge that I can not learn from books.

<br />11A
<br />Food Inc. Writing
<br />May.2.2011
<br />It is quite common that people are getting more and more confused when facing the food they eat. Foods which contained lots of unknown ingredients usually are great threaten for our health. From my perspective, there are several groups of people should account for this situation.
<br /><br />One of the major groups of people flows to the farmers. Personally, food safety is closely connected with them. It is known that foods are initially come from farms and fields. Farmers, a group of people who take care of these crops and domestic animals all the time, had the duties to ensure those animals and fruits are green and unpolluted by chemicals. In other words, agriculturalists have the responsibilities to keep our food safe.
<br /><br />Another group should be manufacturers and food companies. They are also related with the food safe since food processing certainly influence the raw materials. Facts and examples shown in Food Inc. help me clearly recognize the truth and dark side of the food industry. To be more specific, chickens, beefs and other kinds of meat are processed in an unsanitary means. Moreover, chickens are shown to grow up in gloomy and unhygienic conditions before they are sent to those mysterious factories and infamous companies. It definitely shocked and threatened consumers who still believe that manufacturers are trustworthy.
<br /><br />Besides, governments are accountable for food safe. In the first place, certain organizations and departments ought to investigate those questionable food companies and industries. Also, they can make those infamous events of food published on news or mass media and known by public. In addition, local government should examine food companies and chains deeply and strictly. Once there are problems appeared, government should penalize this company. Furthermore, related ministers should carry out some policies which limit and supervise the behaviors of food industries. To sum up, government and organizations need to pay more attentions to doubtable farming and food manufactures.
<br /><br />Above all, agriculturalists, manufacturers and governments are responsible for food safety. Related departments and businesses should put more effort to maintain the food safe as our health are the most important and precious.

<br /><br />In the late afternoon of April 29, I went to an Italian restaurant with my friend Carol. This restaurant is called Ciao Italia Pizzeria. It is located at 193-2 Shigu Road in Nanjing. The reason why I chose this restaurant is I was attracted by the advertisement on Map magazine. It says “Nanjing’s real Italian restaurant, with home-made pasta and our specialties of pizza steak and seafood.”
<br /><br />Initially, we ordered Insalata Mista. It is mixed green salad. I did not know what kind of food in it so I asked the waiter and he told me that there are vegetables in it. However, to my surprise, the vegetables tasted badly and were extremely bitter. Thus, I added some oil-like stuff with the vegetables. Anyways, I almost ate up reluctantly.
<br /><br />After the unpleasant salad, there came the Siciliana. It was a kind of pizza with tomato, mozzarella, ham, artichokes, mushrooms and black olive. It seemed quite delicious and tasty when the waiter put the dish on the table. Unfortunately, it was also bitter and sour when I tasted it. I really dislike the green-bean like stuff, artichokes and the black olive. I belived it was not delicious because it did not fit my personal taste. on the other hand, it may be great for people who favour this kind of savour. 
<br /><br />Finally, we had a great Panna cotta. It was an Italian pudding and it was especially sweet and palatable. This was the best one among these three dishes. 
<br /><br />To sum up, the Italian food is vastly different compared with food I usually eat. The taste is strange to me and I could not used to it. Besides, the environment of the restaurant is not comfortable as well as the atmosphere. What is even worse, the service is unsatisfactory as we waited for a long time after orderd. Also, the prices are unreasonable when contrasted with another Italian restaurant I tried in Grade 10.
<br />Accordingly, I would not recommend others to eat in the restaurant.</div>

<br />11A
<br />Physical Activity 
<br />2010-2011
<br /><br />During my Grade 11, I perform eighty hours of physical activities. These include swimming and riding a bicycle. Through performing activities regularly and constantly, I get abundant benefits and enjoy doing physical exercise.
<br /><br />When talking about benefits of riding bicycle, I would say there are mainly three types of advantages, they are physical, mental and ecologic ones. In the first place, riding bicycle helps me keep physical healthy. Bicycling could improve the development of hearts. Also,it is helpful to the joints. It is especially significant to physical health because as people become older, there may appear bone diseases. Fortunately, bicycling offers great opportunities for me to exercise my joints and prevent from getting diseases of joints when I get older.Furthermore, riding bicycle enhance the cardiovascular function and make me more healthy.
<br /><br />Another aspect of merits is it keep me mentally healthy. Initially, riding a bike is relaxing and pleasant. After school, I usually riding a bike with my friend, Carol. I love chatting with her and sharing our interests and goals. During bicycling, I find it assists me to release heavy pressure from school work and become happy and pleased. Also, riding a bike is more quicker compared with automobiles. This certainly make me feel pleasant. Furthermore, I enjoy the fascinating landscapes and scenes when I am riding a bicycle. Personally speaking, riding in a slow pace and enjoy the nature at the same time might be the most comfortable and peaceful thing I have ever experienced. On the contrary, when driving a car, you may miss the nice sights and fails to enjoy the beauty of nature. 
<br /><br />The third advantage of bicycling is ecologic ones. This is quite obious when compared with automobiles. The first one is it saves fuels. Bicycling completely do not need to consume any fuels. Also, bikes never emit any waste gases and pollutants. Therefore, bicyling is environmental-friendly. 
<br /><br />On the other hand, swimming also provides lots of benefits. Like bicyling, it also has both physical and mental aspects. One of them is that it help me to strengthen my  flexibility, enhance my balance and blood circulation, and develop a stronger heart and a better figure. Apert from this, it is good for the health of lung and also reduces the risk of stroke, heart attack and diabetes. Also, swimming help me out of indigestion problem. In addition, swimming help me release stress and feel relaxed. From my perspective, I feel happier, lissome and lighthearted. To be more specific, every time I swam with my mum, I had a great time. Although my mum is not good at swimming, she still have lots of fun and I was always willing to teach her.Sometimes, we played the water and compete with each other. That really help me out of depressing and unhappiness and assist me to foster a positive attitude towards life.
<br /><br />To sum up, I discover huge amounts of strengths of physical health, not only help me to keep healthy, but also make contributions to my mental health and environments. I truly enjoy and appreciate physical health and exercise.</div>

<br />Exhibition 1
<br />Aug.23.2010
<br /><br />In last summer, August 23, I went to Nanjing Art Museum with my father to enjoy the art work created by Kathe Schmidt Kollwitz. From visiting this excellent exhibition, I learnt more about art and life.
<br /><br />Kathe Schmidit Kollwitz was a female German painter, printmaker, and sculptor in twentieth century. Her empathy for the less fortunate, expressed most well-knowingly by the graphic means of drawing, woodcut, etching and lithography. Most of her works demonstrate the poor workers, farmers who were humiliated, the death and the fearless fights. Apart from these, there were starved children and mothers who endured all the hardships. To my surprise, all of her art works were black-and-white. To most people they were not pleasant, but they expressed great tenacity and intense spirit strengths.
<br /><br />One of my favorite is the “remembrance”. It applied the method of woodcut which attracted my attention. By the moment I saw this art work, I found it was thrilling and heart shaking. There were vast amounts and types of feelings in this woodcut. Fundamentally, some unfortunate farmers and workers were watching the people in the centre except one person, who seemed dull and strange. Also, behind the two hunchbacked people, there was person who closed his eyes and expressed a feeling of worry. Exclude these two people, the things held by the man attract left people’s attentions. From my perspective, the person in the centre carefully held money or food given by the man beside the person. It strongly impressed me when I watched the facial expression and behavior of the person in the middle. It was extremely unpleasant when I saw the hunchbacked people. They were so afraid and frightened. However, on the other hand, these unfortunate farmers and workers looked firm and indomitable. It was especially distinct when I watched the woman who was holding her baby. Personally speaking, she was unflinching and tenacious. She did not escape from the hardship and discard her baby. Instead, she chose to face it bravely and become firm. 
<br /><br />Although there were not many lines and patterns, Kathe Kollwitz illustrated the mighty and great figure of mothers, who were fearless, persistent, and selfless. Also, the art work did not have complicated lines, no bright and strong colours, but each single line implicated intense emotions and expressions while contained heart shaking powers in the black-and-white world.
<br /><br />Later I understood the style of works by Kollwitz. She was involved in two world wars and the enormous changes in German political situation. Therefore, with her experience, the terrible feeling and emotions were vividly expressed in her art works. Through presenting the hardships brought to impoverished people by wars, such as males died in the war, mothers lost their children, wives were separated away from their husbands, children lost their parents, her art works are filled with desire to equality and the fight towards tyranny of the government.
<br /><br />Finally, Through enjoying the master works of Kathe Kollwitz, I was deeply impressed by the love and courage of mothers and the firmness of the unfortunate groups of people. I recognized that Kollwitz aimed to express the truth of people’s life and desire during the war through created unforgettable pieces of art. I really appreciate this exhibition as it provided me a chance to closely feel the difficuties and hardships of life.

<br />Cultural Awareness-German
<br />Jan.21.2011
<br /><br />On 21st of January, I went to a German restaurant named Paulaner Brauhaus with my friend Carol. This restaurant is located near Wutaishan sports stadium, #123 Guangzhou Road in Nanjing. We had delicious lunch there and I appreciated this restaurant.
<br /><br />The reason why I chose this restaurant is I believed in Map Magazine. It says “we offer a unique mixture of bars, pubs, restaurant, lounge, event-location, beer garden and brewery beneath one roof”. Then Carol and I took a taxi to arrive this restaurant as we did not where it was. Unfortunately, the driver also fails to recognize this restaurant. After we got off the taxi, we walked around Wutaishan and Guangzhou Road. Eventually, I found “Paulaner Brauhaus”. From my experience, I held that it was not easy to find. 
<br /><br />I enjoyed the scene around the restaurant and believed it was pleasant. Next, we ordered after looking at the menu. I ordered smoked salmon with mixed salad, 120g Australian filet steak with grilled vegetable and black pepper sauce, and cream rice pudding. It was a set and the waiter said it was less expensive than ordered them individually. 
<br /><br />My favorite one is the steak with black pepper sauce. It was truly delicious especially with the great black pepper sauce. I held that the chef certainly put efforts into this dish. On the contrary, the salmon with salad and cream rice pudding is more plain and less tasty but not unpalatable. The foods differ from what I usually eat definitely since the German food has more calories and are more attractive. 
<br /><br />The environment and the service are quite satisfying. The restaurant is well-decorated and clean. Besides, most customers are young people and middle-aged people. I strongly recommend others to try the steak in “Paulaner Brauhaus”.</div>

<br />School clubs
<br />Sept.-Nov.2010
<br /><br />From September to November in 2010, I performed fifteen hours of club activities, eleven hours were hiking club activities, and the rest four hours are French participation.
<br /><br />Compared with Grade 10, I chose two different kinds of clubs. I decided to attend hiking club because my friend Jessica, also were my classmate in grade 10, is the leader of this organization, she encouraged me to join and I agreed. Another one is French Club, both my interest and Carol’s persuasion led me join in French club. Fortunately, both of these clubs were absorbing and practical. 
<br /><br />In the first place, I will summarize the experience and significance of the hiking club. When talk about experience, I held that I encountered a lot in this club. Briefly, I climbed the Purple Mountain on 4th.November, 10th.November and 1st. December. In total, I performed in the activities for eleven hours. Through climbing the Purple Mountain, I got both physical and mental benefits. Initially, there are abundant physical advantages of hiking mountain. One of the merits is it is a great endurance workout since I have to walk for a long time to reach the top. Also, climbing can improve my flexibility, like cycling, which I have mentioned in my personal health section. Apart from this, mountain climbing assisted me to improve coordination and ensure balance. Although I got extremely tiring after hiking, my physical condition became better and less stressful. On the other hand, there were enormous mental benefits. One of the major strength is, climbing is relaxing and enjoyable. It seemed quite similar with recycling, but hiking was more delectable. To be more specific, I felt rejuvenated when I saw the breathtaking sceneries, breathed the fresh and clean air, and heard the birds singing. While enjoyed the nature, most stress and pressure were released before I realized it. Furthermore, when I climbed the Purple Mountain with my friends and classmates, I enjoyed chatting, sharing our interests and exchanging our experiences with them. As time flies, our friendship would develop better and closer.
<br /><br />Not only hiking club, but also French club benefited me from lots of aspects. Personally speaking, I learnt a brand new language! As you know, French is completely fresh for me as I have never studied French before. Therefore, I found it was difficult for me to learn it. However, I did understand and learnt some useful and practical vocabularies, phrases and simple sentences. For instance, I learnt numbers from zero to ten; some simple greetings like “Hi”, “how are you” and “What’s your name?”; and the French pronunciation of alphabet letters. Moreover, I practiced these simple sentences by making conversations and playing some interesting games with members of French club. It is quite responsible that when I spoke something in wrong pronunciation, the leader and the teacher corrected me immediately and patiently. From my perspective, I definitely appreciated French club for providing me a free and great chance to learn French effectively. 
<br /><br />Eventually, the two clubs I involved in were particular enjoyable and unforgettable, not only I acquired lots of benefits, but more significant is, I enriched my school life and left valuable experience forever.

<br />Volunteer experience 1
<br />2010-2011
<br /><br />From March 2010 to April 2011, I had gained thirty hours of volunteer work. These include tasks performed using technology and tasks done by hand. Here I will discuss what I have done without using technology. 
<br /><br />There are several main types of jobs I have volunteered for Ms. Bartell. One of them is making the envelopes using calendar paper. This was quite creative and interesting as I had never tried before. Initially, I tear a piece of calendar paper, they I use the template to draw the outline of the expansion version of the envelope with a pencil. Then I cut the calendar paper followed the outline. After folding it carefully and taping some double-side tape, an envelope was actually done. Different from other types of envelopes, these envelopes were more attractive since the covers had beautiful patterns, and they were more personalized, which stood out from those plain machine-printed envelopes. Apart from this, I also helped Ms. Bartell mark and organize the quizzes. I still remembered that I performed this volunteer work with Carol and Jessica. Ms. Bartell appreciated us to help her and said we were super efficient. Also, I helped Mr. Davis and Mr. Orchard for 2.5 hours and 1 hour respectively. For instance, I assisted Mr. Davis to remove the answers from the reference books and carried these books to Mr. Fyfe. It sounded quite easy and simple. However, the books were very heavy and tiring. On the other hand, what I have volunteered for Mr. Orchard was comparatively simple. To be more specific, I put the letters into the envelopes (not the ones I made for Ms.Bartell) and wrote the student names on the covers. 
<br /><br />Besides volunteer work I have mentioned above, I also help Ms.Bartell colour the film contest certificates. Basically, I used markers of different colour, painted on the certificates and tried to create non-repetitive patterns and drawings on each of them. Furthermore, I helped Mr. Bartell clean her office and took off the sheets on the wall and wiped the dusty desks. Although the cleaning work is a little tiring, I actually gain some fun and pleasure from the labor. In addition, I was asked to make some small cards, which are tied with keys. In the first step, I drew an outline of a card on a piece of a cardboard. Then I cut from the big piece and write some labels on the small card before I attached it with a key. Moreover, I made some advertisement of GCA tutor program posters. Similarly, I painted the advertisement of student success workshop, made name lists of the workshop and hung them around GCA building. 
<br /><br />Through volunteering without technology, I gained lots of knowledge of practical skills and communication skills. Briefly, I understood techniques of making handicrafts and posters; I enjoyed the process and results of labor; and discovered and exercised my creativity; I improved my communication ability; I foster a positive and optimistic attitude towards life. Also, volunteering narrowed the gap between teachers and students and leads the relationship more closely.

<br />Exhibition 2
<br />Apr.22.2011
<br /><br />In the afternoon on 22nd of April in 2011, I went to visit the exhibition called “China hundred Jinling Exhibition” with Carol. This exhibition was held in Jiangsu Province Art Museum. I decided to go to this exhibition because I was attracted by the title of the exhibition and it was a free exhibition. Luckily, it did not disappoint me; instead, this exhibition was truly worthy to visit. 
<br /><br />One of art work I loved was home by Sang Jianguo. It was a traditional Chinese realistic painting, which was characterized by fine brushwork and close attention to detail. Moreover, it won a gold prize in the “China hundred Jinling Exhibition” in Chinese painting. In this painting, it illustrated a part of home and the scenes outside of the window. From the painter’s perspective, I saw a lady stood in front of the window and watched the landscape outside. To be more specific, the lady wore a pink-red hair clip on her wavy hair, with a black pullover, purple corduroy skirt, black stockings, bright pink socks and a pair of red-purple cotton-padded slippers. Apart from her clothes and appearance, her right arm was relying on the mop stick of the mop while she held the top of the rod with her left hand. 
<br /><br />Besides, the settings in the room were fascinating. On the right, there was a bunch of light yellow flowers with long green stems, which was placed in the glass bottle. Behind it, the purple certain was pulled to the right hand. On the left of the curtains and the flowers, there was the mop and a small green rubbish basket. On the left side, a television was hung on the wall. Below it there was a white socket. On the white line it was a red and green plug base. Also, there were lights alone the roof. 
<br /><br />Furthermore, the scenes outside of the window were particularly attractive and vivid. In general, there were lots of building and a river around this flat. The buildings left others an impression of Chinese typical and modern building style. From the drawing, there were most yellow-painted buildings. On the contrary, there was a tall, plain building on the left. Beside the high architecture, a river and several colorful ships were included. On the other hand, the sky had lots of clouds and had little sunlight. 
<br /><br />As most people know, meticulous traditional portraits pursuit to create accurate hook lines and elegant colours. Mr. Sang's meticulous paintings not only inherit the Chinese tradition but also had his own explorations. His creations, from one aspect, remain the tradition, which concentrate on the fine lines; from another aspect, he absorbed the advantages of western paintings, which focus on colour expressions. This is actually the perfect combination of traditional Chinese drawing and western realism style. Personally, the unique point of Mr. Sang’s art work is the combination of both eastern and western styles.
<br /><br />Generally, I enjoyed a pleasant time visiting this exhibition. More significant is, it broadened my horizons and enriched my experience in my youth time.

<br />Volunteer experience 2
<br />Oct.2010-Apr.2011
<br /><br />During October in 2010 to April in 2011, I finished volunteer work done by using technology. Generally, these volunteer works were involved in computers.
<br /><br />To begin with, I helped Ms. Bartell checked the GCA alumni; create main framework of student success workshop PowerPoint presentations; typed attendance of student success workshop into Microsoft Word; added business card information into Gmail contacts; reviewed GCA alumni entered into Gmail contacts to guarantee no one was missed; helped Ms. Bartell upload postcard images and type notes for students who failed in term 2; and typed the reports of students who had a tutor into computers. 
<br /><br />During volunteer using technology, I encounter some interesting things. For example, when I checked the alumni, I sometimes got confused because some of them had different class but shared same name. Then I had to ask Ms. Bartell to confirm whether it was the right one. Also, when I created the PowerPoint, I mainly typed the title on each slide, and found a picture which had some connections with the topic. When I search the topic, for example, memory, there were lots of images appeared, but I had to select them and decided which one to put into the PowerPoint. Apart from this, I also experienced something new when I added the business cards. To be more specific, Ms. Bartell gave me several business cards and asked me to type the information into her Gmail contacts. When I typed some Chinese business card, I did not how to translate the name of their jobs as there were cultural differences between Chinese and western culture. Additionally, I knew a great website called Postcrossing when I was asked to upload the postcards images on this website. Moreover, I learnt how to scan the images into computers. To my surprise, it was not too complicated, at least easier than I thought. Furthermore, I practiced typing for quite a long time. During typing reports, not only speed up my typing speed, but also provided me chances to become familiar with computers. 
<br /><br />Although what I have done seemed simple and easy, it actually taught me a lot and possessed lots of benefits. One of the advantages was it made me become more modern and intellectual. For instance, I was able to use computers from fundamental level, such as Microsoft word and using internet. I also learned some practical skills on PowerPoint making. Apart from these, I helped Ms.Bartell finish lots of small tasks and became an effective and helpful assistant of Ms. Bartell. In addition, volunteering enriched my spare time. I can even imagine if I did not volunteer constantly, I would probably waste great amount of time through sleeping or surfing on the Internet. 
<br /><br />Finally, I really appreciate volunteer experience, for it provided me a chance to gain lots of practical knowledge about computers, offered me a great chance to had close communication with teachers, enriched my life experience and helped me stand out among others when I seek jobs in the future.</div>

<br />Go To a Performance
<br />Aug.28.2010
<br /><br />In last summer, I went to watch the performance called “Gateway to music - The Cheatles” in Nanjing Cultural Art Center with my father. The concert started at about half past seven to half past nine in the evening of August 28. Personally, I loved this concert and enjoyed it.
<br /><br />In the first place, I would like to introduce the “The Cheatles”. They are the first band to render songs of the Beatles with lyrics in Chinese. This band, likes the Beatles, also include four members; Martin Fleischer, Peter Merker, Kai and Richie. Before, they have given lots of public concerts and performed on music festivals and charity events. As 2010 is the 50th anniversary of the Beatles, they held this concert to yearn the Beatles.
<br /><br />During this concert, they performed lots of songs of the Beatles, such as Yesterday, Hey Jude, Let it Be, eight days a week, nowhere man, something, Twist and Shout, Imagine and so on. To be honest, I loved most of the songs especially Yesterday, Hey Jude, Imagine and Let it Be. When performing Hey Jude, they leaded all audiences to follow them and sing together. I remembered that the last has repeated for lots of time as they were not satisfied with reactions of the audiences. Also, Let it be was extremely impressing.
<br /><br />After the concert, I got signatures of Kai and Richie and bought a CD named “Let it be”. Actually there was only one song in the CD because the Cheatles aimed to raise funds for charities and help unfortunate people. Anyways, I truly appreciated this concert and had a great time with those people who loved music.</div>

<br />Activity organized by GCA teacher
<br />Mar.12, 2011
<br /><br />On the Planting Day, March 12, I went to Lishui Tian Sheng Bridge to plant trees with other GCA students. I had a good time there and gained a lot.
<br /><br />To begin with, we gathered together at the school gate in the early morning. After waiting for some time, I got on the bus and sat beside Carol. After about one to two hours, we arrived at our destination-Lishui Tian Sheng Bridge. There were lots of people around the gate. Then we entered into this park and walked towards the planting site. During this process, we visited the zoo and some interesting sites. I watched the camels, monkeys and peacocks. Some of them were having meals, some were playing with friends, some were taking photos with visitors, and some merely walked around. After visiting those places, Carol and I walked the Tian Sheng Bridge. We found it had another name, it was Yan Zhi Bridge. This bridge was quite unique as both sides of the river were surrounded by huge stones. However, the bridge was not wide, but it was quite famous and I took a photo on the bridge. Then we went to plant trees and enjoyed a great time there. In the afternoon, we walked around the park and discovering the beauty of nature.
<br /><br />Generally, we had an enjoyable time there and put efforts in protecting the environment. I truly appreciate this activity organized by a GCA teacher, as it offer me a chance to enjoy the beauty of nature, take the responsibility of protecting environment, as well as a memorable experience in my life.</div>

<br />Mental Health
<br />2010-2011
<br /><br />Through hearing the lecture given in the Transition 11 class, I understood various mental health issues. There were Stress and Depression caused by smoking, drugs, alcohol, cigarettes and so on.
<br /><br />When talk about stress, there are mainly three aspects, symptoms, influence and solutions respectively. When someone had stress, a rush of adrenaline, headache and stomach problems may appear. Also, he/she may suicide if the people get too much stress. On the other hand, there were several solutions. For instance, people can have deep breath, stretching, eat well to relax, and they ought to remove attentions to things that can make them happy. Also, doing some outdoor activities, such as hiking or running will also work.
<br /><br />Another main mental health issue flows to depression. Similarly, there were also three parts, symptoms, impact, and treatments. Main indications were having trouble with sleep, lose appetite, and cry a lot, grades start to drop and so on. Apart from this, serious depression may lead to suicide, alcoholism, anxiety, physical health problems, family conflicts and work-related problems. So, how can depression be treated? In the first place, sufferers need to take medicine. Secondly, patients should talk with families and friends. If it was too serious, talking with professional therapists and doctors was also necessary. Thirdly, people who had depressions needed to regulate by themselves.
<br /><br />Finally, the lecture given in Transition 11 class was extremely useful and essential, for it helped me understand the two main mental health issues, stress and depression; and reminded me to foster a positive and optimistic attitude towards life.

<br />Nutrition
<br />2010-2011
<br /><br />Physical health is particular essential in our life. If we are unhealthy or sick, we may not study or work effectively. Therefore, nutrition is a significant issue and people ought to keep a healthy lifestyle and eating habits.
<br /><br />Generally, eating a wide variety of fresh foods is beneficial for our health compared with those processed food. Also, vegetables slow digestion and allow better absorption. Moreover, they help people balance essential nutrients and assist us regulate blood sugar. On the other hand, meat provides us energy to consume every second. 
<br /><br />Not only we should have healthy food, but also need to keep proper eating habits. For instance, we should have meals regularly. Also, we should have breakfast everyday. Apart from this, we should try to balance our food. By this I mean, vegetables are as significant as meat and other types of food. 
<br /><br />Personally, nutrition is closely associated with our personal health. We should select healthy food to eat and foster a proper eating habit.

<br />Forrest Gump
<br />May.21.2011
<br /><br />It is quite common that a lot of people classified Forrest Gump, the main character of this movie, as someone who has disabilities. However, it is essential to realize that a disability does not mean someone is a burden on society, but can actually be an active and contributing member in the society.
<br /><br />There are several reasons why it is necessary to realize that a disability is not a burden on society. One of the major one is it will alter opinions and thoughts of normal people towards them. It will change a lot if less people hold disabilities are useless and stupid. In other words, it will decrease discrimination and provide equality as a whole. Once people look at them from a proper and objective perspective, disabilities will not suffer from the discrimination. Instead, they are totally equal with normal people.
<br /><br />Another main reason is that it will provide more opportunities for them to make contributions. In this movie, Forrest Gump enlisted the army and joined the Vietnam War. During the war, Forrest saved some soldiers and made contributions for the nation, as well as received awards from U.S president. Therefore, if people at that time treat Forrest equally, he would make much more contributions benefit the society.
<br /><br />Furthermore, although people like Forrest have weaknesses, they possess numerous talents and potential beyond ordinary people. For instance, Forrest Gump was able to run as fast as wind and run across the country. Apart from this, Forrest had an uncanny ability for ping pong and competed against Chinese. Obviously, Forrest Gump owned great potential and talents that surprised ordinary people. May be Forrest mother’s “stupid is as stupid does” worked, Forrest earned lots of money from shrimping boat, which is the only boat survived in the Hurricane Carmen. 
<br /><br />Finally, I would like to quote a sentence in Forrest Gump, “life was like a box of chocolates, you never know what you’re gonna get” as the conclusion. Similarly, nobody knows whether disabilities are burden on society, everyone is unique, and has the potential to be an active and contributing member.</div>
