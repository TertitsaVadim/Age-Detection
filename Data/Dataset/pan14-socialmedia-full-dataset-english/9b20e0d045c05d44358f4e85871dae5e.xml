<br /><br />If images of white dresses are dancing in your head, then you must have been recently engaged. Of course, many women have had an image of their wedding in their head since the time they were born, but will the real life live up to your dream?
<br /><br />Capturing a personality
<br /><br />Although it may seem that all wedding dresses are alike, there are many ways to capture individual styles. White may be the traditional wedding gown color, but more brides are choosing off-white or a light cream as an alternative. This can show your fashion consciousness, while still remaining true to the traditional coloring.
<br /><br />If you're a bit more vibrant and outgoing, you may want to do something daring at your wedding. This thought may be accentuated if you are looking to do a themed wedding as well. Try a different color altogether. Do something wild like red or purple. While they might not be the standards, they will definitely liven up a wedding photo.
<br /><br />And if you're looking for a theme for your wedding, you will want to study related dresses to the time period or culture. If you're looking for something that is renaissance inspired, then you may want to look in costume shops for styles that can be turned into wedding gowns.
<br /><br />Using your body type
<br /><br />If you're looking for something that is flattering, then you're going to need to try on a lot of dresses before you do. But this is a good thing. Many times, brides find that their dream dress doesn't always look like the dream in their head.
<br /><br />For women who are shorter in stature, you may want to select a gown with longer lines and seams. Although your high heels will help to create a taller look, the cleaner and simpler the dress, the more it will elongate you. You should pick something that doesn't have a lot of detailing because it may cause the eyes to look at one particular area rather than you as a whole image.
<br /><br />For the taller woman who is looking to create a less lengthy style, you will want to find a dress with more detail toward the bottom of the dress. This helps to draw the eye away from the height.
<br /><br />All in all, whatever dress makes you feel beautiful is the one that is right for you. So, don't let convention or tradition stand in the way of your dream. Short or long, detailed or not, your wedding dress should reflect everything that you are feeling on your wedding day.

<br /><br />Las Vegas has been known as a different sort of wedding town particularly for the drive through weddings, but now Las Vegas weddings are starting to be known again for something else.
<br /><br />Brides getting married in Las Vegas are starting to style their wedding dresses after the fabulous Sin City … literally.
<br /><br />Red is the new color for brides to wear while walking down the aisle in Las Vegas. Most brides who choose to wear red are wearing wine red corsets with white, flowing, layered skirts. Some of the skirts even have detailed red on it: red sequins, red jewels, or even red ribbons.
<br /><br />Las Vegas wedding fashions may never be the same. Grooms are already dressing in red to match their brides dresses. But even more shocking is that someone else will be wearing the white?
<br /><br />It is fast becoming a custom in Las Vegas for the brides maids to wear the white while the Las Vegas bride sports the red. Though the brides maids dresses don't look like wedding dresses, it is exceptional to note that brides definitely stand out with their red wedding dresses.
<br /><br />Many Las Vegas brides have found their red wedding dresses online, but others have had them custom made. Custom wedding dress makers are far from scarce in Las Vegas.
<br /><br />Also surprisingly enough, these custom dresses usually aren't overpriced and are quite affordable to make a lady in red. Depending on the dress maker, a deep red Las Vegas wedding dress can run between $500 to $2,000.
<br /><br />While Las Vegas brides continue to peruse the Las Vegas strip with their bridal party, they now match the strip a little better, but stand out twice as much.

<br /><br />It goes without saying that we all want to look our best for the big day. So preparation is the key. Take care of your skin, hair and body in the months leading up to the wedding and you will have a good base to start from.
<br /><br />Starting with body, you want to look slim and happy in your wedding gown not bloated and insecure so watch what you eat in the months coming up to the wedding and exercise regularly. A good tip to prevent bloating as sworn by Hollywood stars before the Oscars are to cut down on carb's the last few weeks before the big day. This should eliminate any unwanted bumps and bulges.
<br /><br />To give your skin that healthy glow desired by all, you need to drink plenty of water, at least 2 liters per day, dehydrated skin looks dull, dry and unattractive. The essential fatty acids found in salmon, tuna, nuts and seeds are essential for beautiful skin and hair, try to eat as much of these as possible. Jennifer Lopez swears by this, she is so well known for her glowing, perfect skin that her perfume was called Glow in reference to her glowing complexion.
<br /><br />Keep your skin in shape with a daily cleansing, toning and moisturizing routine. It's very important that you are using the right products for your skin type. You can get advice from your local beauty sales counters on the best products out there for you. Remember to exfoliate your skin weekly, this will eliminate old dull skin cells and reveal new fresh skin beneath.
<br /><br />You should have an exfoliating routine for your back, arms and chest or any other part of your skin that will be on show in your dress. This will give a lovely healthy shine to your body. Remember to lash on loads of body cream after you exfoliate to sooth and moisten the skin.
<br /><br />If you are unlucky enough to have dry frizzy hair or you use color and harsh styling products regularly, you need to give your hair regular hair masks to bring the life and shine back to your tresses. Most salons provide hair treatments with lovely essential oil and vitamin products, which are great for your hair and scalp as a lovely weekly or biweekly treat. The price can range from $30 to $80 depending on the salon.
<br /><br />If you are more of a DIY girl why don't you purchase your own intensive moisturizing hair conditioner and do your own treatment. When you have put the treatment in the hair apply heat to using a hairdryer, then wrap your hair in cling film to keep in the heat, leaving as long as you desire this will prove a more intense treatment allowing the moisture to penetrate the hair cuticle.
<br /><br />Your hair will be shining with health and smelling yummy on the big day.
<br /><br />Now for the real magic &quot;make up&quot; of course. Now that you are all glowing and beautiful nature sometimes needs a little help to give us that Hollywood beauty we all desire. The next step is your make up application. If you are going to get your make up done professionally you should shop around, just be cause they are &quot;professionals&quot; doesn't mean they are talented.
<br /><br />Make sure you have an idea of what you want to look like on the day, bring bridal photos with make up styles you like and ideas on what hair style you will have also helps.
<br /><br />A clean fresh look always works with definition on the eyes. Make up that looks good in person is usually too little for photographs; the last thing you want is your eye disappearing in the photos. A good idea is to bring an instant camera with you and take photos of the various make up looks you have tried out, between you discuss what you like and don't like. Remember a photograph is less forgiving than a mirror.
<br /><br />Finally your hair, the range of styles are endless. Do not try out any new hair colors or cuts in the months leading up to the wedding, You don't want to try something different and trendy and then hate it leaving you no time to grow it out. Stick to what you know suits you. Also going for the most up to date styles isn't recommended you don't want to look back on your photos in ten years time explaining to your kids how it was fashonable at the time.
<br /><br />The first decision up or down? Wearing your hair up shows off your neckline and bone structure, always flattering in photographs. On the other hand more people are going for the sexy wavy tresses look that is being sported by Gwyneth Paltrow and Jennifer Aniston on her wedding day, very bohemian chic.
<br /><br />Your wedding gown will ultimately dictate your hairstyle. The rule of thumb is usually sexy wavy tresses equals' plain simple dress. The simple up style will flatter the more elaborate dress. Either way what you feel comfortable with and the prettiest with is the style for you, a happy comfortable bride is a pretty bride.

<br />Every couple has their own problems. Sometimes it leads to break of relationship. Many lovers say that time heals the heart. It is right but you should know simple and useful tips to forget your ex love. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5icmlkYWwtYnV5LmNvbS9jaGVhcC1jb2NrdGFpbC1kcmVzc2VzX2MxNg__" target="_blank">red cocktail dresses</a>
<br /><br />At the first place you should “be published”. New people, new emotions will make you to think not only about your ex love. Look through your evening <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5icmlkYWwtYnV5LmNvbS9jaGVhcC1jb2NrdGFpbC1kcmVzc2VzX2MxNg__" target="_blank">wedding cocktail dresses</a> and find some special. Than call your friends and visit some unofficial event or party. It will bring to you new encounters and maybe among new friends will be your next love. It doesn't mean that you should go there with an idea to find exactly new relationship. 
<br /><br />At the second place is self treatment. Ask yourself why your ex is merit for you? You are the best and the past will not prevent you happiness. You should understand that the fate is in your hands. Everything that happens – happens for the better. If your ex has gone it means that you will meet somebody more appropriate for you. 
<br /><br />At the third place is your environment. Throw out all photos, videos, letters – all that can recall the memoirs of your ex love. Her or his gifts you should remove too. Most important of them you can leave as exception. You should remember that all kind of things that remind you make all this tips useless. And you will be in depressions all your life. 
<br /><br />Finally I want to say that to forget your ex love is not easy. It takes a lot of times, energy and feelings. Be sure not to close your heart to another love because you don't know where and when you can meet your lovely half. Try always to be yourself, not to lie yourself and to look at the world with beautiful and open eyes.

And if you want to invite the whole gang, think about a fun-filled wedding weekend and reunion at an activity-rich resort, beach, or lakeside town. Whatever you decide, beach weddings are often memorable, unique, and offer a plethora of options. Here are eight steps to make planning yours an official breeze.
<br /><br />1. Scout Out Locations
<br />Choose a location based on your wedding style and nonnegotiable guest list (if any). Unlike a hometown affair, you can’t assume everyone will be able to attend, especially if you’ve chosen a beach that requires a journey for most people. You’ll want to compare facilities and, if you’re marrying on a private beach, look into any permit fees, container laws, and clean-up charges.
<br /><br />2. Start Early
<br />Start researching and planning your beach wedding as soon as possible. Not only do you have to reserve your venue, but fulfilling the marriage and potential permit requirements of the state in which you are to be wed may take a few months. For example, some public beaches’ parks commissions may require you to detail explicitly all pieces of equipment you’ll be bringing to the site, as well as all food and beverages to be served there. Remember that you’ll also need to have a plan in place for clean-up, which is one part of the wedding process you don’t usually need to think about when your holding your affair indoors.
<br /><br />3. Ask the Right Questions
<br />Two maxims to keep in mind here: No question is stupid and you’ll never know until — and unless! — you ask. Achieving your dream wedding means having all the information you need to make the perfect choices. Read our articles about beach wedding ceremony and beach wedding reception basics to guide you through the beach marriage maze.
<br /><br />4. Be Flexible
<br />Mother Nature works in mysterious ways. We can’t stress this enough: Always have a back-up plan in place for whatever she throws your way. Don’t feel compelled to organize the day on a drill sergeant’s time schedule; if you need to be on a rain delay for a couple of hours, the rest of the day can still proceed as planned.
<br /><br />5. Work With Those in the Know
<br />Stress not! Work with a bridal consultant who specializes in beach weddings and/or a wedding planner based in the area where you’ll be married to help you navigate a particular beach’s requirements (these can vary by county and within towns). Planners also serve as expert eyes for finding — and overseeing — local vendors.
<br />6. Guide Your Guests
<br />If you’ve chosen a relatively unknown section of beach, make sure guests know how to find it and can traverse any boardwalks, rocky areas, or grassy dunes. Be sure to place a welcome basket at the front of your ceremony site (suntan lotion, bug spray, etc.) and goodies that will remind them of the setting — parasols, refreshing glasses of lemonade, or cozy beach blankets, for example.
<br /><br />7. Arrive Early
<br />Plan to arrive to your site a few hours early to be sure the set-up goes off without a hitch. Try to relax, and stay hydrated — you don’t want to start wilting during the ceremony!
<br /><br />8. Get It in Writing
<br />If you’ve been on The Knot.com before, you already know our number one rule when dealing with vendors: Make sure you confirm all agreements in writing before you let a single dollar bill leave your wallet!

Know It And Be The Good Parent<br/><br/>“Mom, Which styly cheap homecomeing dresses should I choose?” If your daughter ask you like this, what is your answer? “Sorry honey, I’m hurry, go and ask you classmate?” “Oh, how can you choose this? It’s shame!” “Is this type good? You ‘d better choose this as my”. On, come on, do you this your princess will like these answer? They want get help from their trustable people! So, moms, except your fashion dresses, you’d better know the 2013 homecoing dresses trends!
<br /><br />Bejeweled – Of course, help your daughter also stand out by literally lighting up the room with sequins and rhinestones. Keep the shiny accents in one area of your body though, to avoid looking like a Christmas tree in homecoming. Go for beaded necklines, bodices, cut outs and cross backs. If you are wearing this type of dress to homecoming, don’t wear too much jewellery.
<br /><br />Peek-A-Boo Cutouts – It wouldn’t hurt if you brought in the sexiness through your homecoming dresses. But instead of wearing outfits plunging necklines and miniskirts, you should go with conservative peek-a-boo cutouts on the back and slitted shoulders. A flash of skin is all you need to pay tribute to your beautiful and maturing figure.
<br /><br />Mullet Layer and Asymmetrical Hemlines – Be adventurous with a dress that gives you the best of both worlds – glamour and comfort. In 2012, it is all about being unique and versatile with high-low hemlines, and during homecoming, you’d definitely want to look elegant and nature without taking away that youthful spirit.
<br /><br />Feather, Ruffles and Lace – Although these may be dated about a year, the following flirty accents still remain relevant in 2012 and will go well on any young woman going to homecoming dance for the first or last time. Again, the events are all about having fun and embracing innocence. So, you’d definitely be in style if you get ensembles that have these embellishments. It would be preferable if you have a solid colored bodice as base, since it’s quite easy to look awkward if you go overboard with the design.
