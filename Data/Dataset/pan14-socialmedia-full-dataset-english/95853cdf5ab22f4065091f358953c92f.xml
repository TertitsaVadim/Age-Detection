I now own it solo, longg sad stroy.  I am off on the road again soon.  Down to London to work on a photoshoot then a few day off to rest and do the tourist thing. 
<br /><br />I am teaching again, kids are a nightmare but then whats new? 
<br /><br />Personally I am just kicking back on my time off and advertisingg my services, yep its timee to get those ads ot for make up artist services.  Maybe I will get a bit and start doing films again who knows. or I might just plot somethingg of my own, a kitchen sink drama or possibly a horror movie.

<br /><br />For me there is nothingg really holding me back and I want ot make the move, I am single, good at my job (so I am told), and I want out of here.  I have been let down on my personal life and just think its time to move on.  I have very few positive memories of the UK, Scotland and me just aren't compatible and I am not afraid of walking away and starting again.  Hell I might find someone to fill thise quiet nights and actually find myself with a personal life aggain.  (I am being nagged by friends to get back out there but why<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/unsure.gif" alt=":)" />.  
<br /><br />Still things could be alot worse, I am in a job I enjoy, I have good friends and family that care.  All thats missing is that special someone to complete things.

Out of the blue I find out that someone I cut contact with has made his presence known again. 
<br /><br />With everything that went on between us most of it personal and sad do I get back in contact.  I am not sure if this is about money or an attempt to make me contact him, either way I a mnot sure what to do.  I do miss him but I can't take the arguments and recriminations.  
<br /><br />Lets be honest here, we didn't cut contact without good reason, so why now months down the line do you do this to me? 
<br /><br />Its just left me spinning, I want to see or hear from him but not if its going to be back to the way it was before.  
<br /><br />Hell I need a break.  Maybe its time to take a holiday and regroup.  London was great when I got away and now I am back to square one and don't know what to do.

I am co writing the story and bringing some of my expereinces into play and her skills as a writer. So far it is looking good.  
<br /><br />On friday I am off to Livingstone to teach a class on make up for halloween, the group have been working on costumes so I can't wait to see what they have come up with. 
<br /><br />Saturday brings me through to edinburgh for a production meeting.  Woo, a film or rather a musical based on a wedding.  I am working on the principal cast and have a team working on the rest for two days, I need the extra hands to acheive the overall look, a busy time ahead.
<br /><br />etween writing, designing and teaching I will need to do my tax return.  Who said art is all fun and games?

I am registered on a couple of sites that are designed to allow you to meet new people, I seem to be of the opinion that if your looking for someone then the first and only option is &quot;take me now&quot;.  
<br /><br />I want to know a person first, I am inclined to fall for someone who treats me with resect, talks to me and gets to know me,   Date me, talk to me, get to know me.  
<br /><br />Is this someone that only effects Westerners (I know a generalisation) or is this across the board? 
<br /><br />Can anyone answer me that?

<br /><br />Me and a dear old friend are discussing the possibility of travelling.  We hope to move to europe and just work when we have to and travel, see a bit of the world. 
<br /><br />As she put it &quot;once you step trhough the looking glass its hard to go back.&quot;  Which we both did.  I have seem some interesting and bizare things.  Its aweird little world out there and if people only knew how much weirdness is out there, you would be shocked.  
<br /><br />So the time has come to step out of theshadows and see what can be achieved,

Ok its not ideal he needs to keep quiet and live privately but its good to have someone who finds m attractive and is happy to talk to me for me. 
<br /><br />Work wise I am just enjoying my self, the weather is bad, snow everywhere and things are very quiet but I have found a new agent and some new contacts that could be useful.  
<br /><br />I am feeling posiitve and happy things are looking up and I am glad.
