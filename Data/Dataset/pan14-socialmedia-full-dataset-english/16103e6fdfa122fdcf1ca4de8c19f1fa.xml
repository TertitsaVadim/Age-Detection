Elastomeric coatings from Topps fit the bill, since these rubbery substances are not only waterproof, but also elastic enough to accommodate deformations due to heat expansion and other factors without cracking or springing leaks. Finally, elastomeric membranes and coatings such as EPDM roofing can be a component of so-called “cool roofs” – roofs that are colored white, in order to reflect sunlight. This has the effect of dramatically reducing the temperature in the building, especially the upper floors, and lower cooling costs in the summer.

More comfortable than hard metal or plastic, liquid rubber molding won’t hurt when held against the face for a long time.

Some say ‘that’s good’ and some say ‘that’s bad.’ I think the market place has begun saying more and more ‘a black roof is bad.’ I say that for two important reasons. First, white roofing membranes have really been pushed. From the federal government down to local business owners, white roofing has really begun to take over and is being specified more and more. The second reason I feel that black EPDM has been considered a less than stellar option is because the market says so. (I know that sounds very similar to the first reason. But this actually refers to the manufacturers themselves and not the policymakers.) Many manufactures have begun selling ‘white-on-black’ EPDM (in some cases for the second time), obviously trying to take a cue from the market place. Its logical reasoning: If black roofs are so good, why the push for white roofs, why the development of white-on-black EPDM? I realize that there may be a lot of political reasons for pushing white roofing, but not everything is a conspiracy.
