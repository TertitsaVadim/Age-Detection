<br /><br />The masculine one lacked chest hair and it seemed to become a real problem for him. So, one day he decided to visit the doctor to see why he had no chest hair and if there was something he could do about.
<br /><br />Well, the doctor said there was nothing wrong with the guy, and really the only thing he could try to stimulate hair growth was to smother Vaseline all over his chest daily and perhaps the skin would become stimulated enough to produce hair.
<br /><br />The masculine homosexual was elated. He went immediately home and smothered his chest in Vaselinel. 
<br /><br />When his partner came home and jumped into bed with him, he felt the Vaseline and asked, &quot;What in the hell are you doing?&quot; 
<br /><br />The masculine one explained what the doctor said and waited for comment from his partner. Finally, his partner said, 
<br /><br />&quot;Don't you think if that was true that you would have a &quot;pony tail&quot; coming out of your ass by now?&quot;

<br />With the recent problems being encountered by Windows users all across the country, people are begin to ask themselves if windows is a virus. In response to the high demand for an answer to that question a study was done and concluded the following.
<br /><br />1. Viruses replicate quickly.
<br />Windows does this.
<br /><br />2. Viruses use up valuable system resources, slowing down the system as they do so.
<br />Windows does this.
<br /><br />3. Viruses will, from time to time, trash your hard disk.
<br />Windows does this.
<br /><br />4. Viruses are usually carried, unkown to the user, along with valuable programs and systems.
<br />Windows does that too.
<br /><br />5. Viruses will occasionally make the user suspect their system is too slow (see 2) and the user will buy new hardware.
<br />Same with Windows, yet again.
<br /><br />Maybe Windows really is a virus.
<br /><br />Nope! There is a difference!
<br /><br />Viruses are well supported by their authors, are frequently updated, and tend to become more sophisticated as they mature. So there! Windows is not a virus.

<br /><br />1. Don't imagine you can change a man - unless he's in diapers.
<br /><br />2. What do you do if your boyfriend walks out? You shut the door.
<br /><br />3. If they put a man on the moon - they should be able to put them all up there.
<br /><br />4. Never let your man's mind wander - it's too little to be out alone.
<br /><br />5. Go for younger men. You might as well - they never mature anyway.
<br /><br />6. Men are all the same - they just have different faces, so that you can tell them apart.
<br /><br />7. Definition of a bachelor: a man who has missed the opportunity to make some woman miserable.
<br /><br />8. Women don't make fools of men - most of them are the do-it-yourself types.
<br /><br />9. Best way to get a man to do something - suggest they are too old for it.
<br /><br />10. Love is blind - but marriage is a real eye-opener.
<br /><br />11. If you want a committed man - look in a mental hospital.
<br /><br />12. The children of Israel wandered around the desert for 40 years. Even in biblical times, men wouldn't ask for directions.
<br /><br />13. If he asks what sort of books you're interested in, tell him checkbooks.
<br /><br />14. Remember a sense of humor does not mean that you tell him jokes, it means that you laugh at his.
<br /><br />15. Sadly, all men are created equal
