But I found a bad thing is that my log had lost. There are 7 hours on the log. I feel very sad about this. I remember that I and my classmate Jane. We visit the older and talk to them. They are very lonely. We tell them many things about school life. They are very happy and tell us many stories about them when they were young. They told us the life was difficult in the past. They told us many things about themselves. We can know many things about life. Then we say bye-bye to them. 
<br />  I do some volunteer work with Lydia. We went to a shop to sell things. We ask people what they want and told them the good things about that thing. We stand the shop all day and feel very tried about this. We learn some skills that how to talk to others and be confident. 
<br />  I also do some volunteer work in my uptown. I sweep the floor and clear the door. After snow, I also sweep the grand and make people walk easily. I feel very happy when I see people can through the street. 
<br />  I think volunteer work is very good for us. It is really worth doing the volunteer work. I think it is very useful to us to learn how to help others. Everybody should know how to help others and know it is very good thing. 
<br />  I will continue to do volunteer work and help others. I think it is very good for us to have the experience. It is can help us know we should help the world, be more responsible.
<br />  Through this I can learn many things. How to treat stranger, how to talk to others, how to be polite to others. I really think it is my experience in my life. I will never forget it.

So Jane and I went to a restaurant called Henry’s home. It is an American restaurant. We ate many things. We ate pizza and ribs. It is delicious. We ate the snails. It is really good. We also drink two kinds of drinks. It is little strange when we drank them. But it also was good. The pizza is really big and we can’t eat it at all. I think the best food is the ribs. I went to this restaurant with my family very long time ago. But I can still remember the ribs are the best food in this restaurant. I told to Jane and she wanted to try. So we ate this food and we think it is good. The other food I think good is that the snails. I like eating snails. Somebody think it will be a little terrible. But l like it very much. 
<br />We also take the pictures about the food. We think it will be a little strange and take this photos secretly. We laugh at our action and we all think very happy. I think this activity can help us learn many different culture from different countries. Food is a language, l think. Sometimes people can talk with each other through the food. This activity can also help us know friends. Make our relationship more close. I like this very much! I will never forget it.<img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/109247225_1218333_28598418.jpg" />

<br />And it is health for us. 
<br />  Although I do not like doing physical activity, I still learn much exercise about P.E. At last summer holiday, I learn the tennis and it is my favourite activity. I also can play badminton and in P.E. class, I also learn some badminton skills in the class. And the P.E. class has more exercise and more difficult because in my tradiontal school, the study is the most important things. I cannot adapted the environment at the first. But I also think the exercise is everywhere, we should practice ourselves in the life, not just in the class. Then I found a surprising thing that is my home is very far to the bus stop. And every day, I will go there about 10 to 15 minutes and I will go home spend the same time. Before, I am a lazy girl. I do not want to have more other exercise expect something must be done in P.E. class. But during the physical activity, I learn many things from this. I walk to school every day. It is really very hard for me. Because in the past, I lived in the school in middle school and never walk too much like this. But now, l should go to school by walking every day. It is challenge for me to walk to school every day. In winter, it is really cold and the wind is very strange. In these days, the weather get warmer and it is too hot. I think about if the summer coming, what should I do? It is really hot and also I am afraid of summer because I cannot stay in hot environment too long time. So I think the walking not just easy activity. In fact, every activity is all very difficult. Noting is easy when you do it. And I also attend once badminton club to playing badminton. It is very good for us. Because playing badminton is very good for our health. I went there with Helen and Lucy. There are many people playing badminton there. They all play good I think. And some of them are in school badminton team. I play the badminton with Helen and she is good at playing badminton. Later, I heard she became a member of badminton team. 
<br />I think if you want to do physical activity, you can do it every day. Like when you go home, do not by the lift, just mount stairs. It is also a physical activity and health life style. Put a little time to do some exercise every day or every month, you can be more health. And after this, I decided to go swimming everyday and have more exercise. I think I will be more health because of the physical exercise.

I go there with my friends Jane Tammy and Helen. The professor is very kind and humorous. He teaches us mach knowledge about art. 
<br />At first, he shown us the college. He took us to the art room. In the art room, there are many students painting. We also go to the music room. And we saw a student playing the piano. And Tammy has learned how to playing the piano when she was young. So she played the piano in the music room. The students are very hard I think. Because they all practice in the evening even it is Saturday. We also saw some students are dancing and we went to there dance with them too. The professor also took us to see the students’ artworks who are student the design. The artworks are on the wall. And they are really beautiful. In the music room, there are two students practice singing. It is funny I think. After all of this, we just start the interview. We ask the professor the questions and he always answers carefully. The first question was Jane asked. She asked him his job or study involve. And he said that at first it is about his hobby and study environment. He likes orchestral and he learn this when he was young. Then he went to the university after Gaokao to learn more about this. Then because of the job required, he stay in school and teacher students about the orchestral. So his job involved teaching. And the second question’s answer is similar with the first one. Because the hobby, he chose the art. And the third question was asked by Helen. It is about his some benefits of working the field of art. He thinks that his benefits are what he is doing know. That is what he is learning and teaching. He told many about this like his university, the college. And then I asked him the forth question that is about his favourite artist and artwork. And he said that his favourite artists are Beethoven and Mozart. He likes the artworks are Beethoven’s hero and Mozart’s concerto. Because he thinks that the classical is good. And the popular music maybe is the fashion right now. But it is easy for us to forget. So he rather likes the classical. And this is also can be fashion when it came out. After the interview, we took photos with him and gave him a bunch of flowers. We think it is respecting for him and it also a polite action. After this interview, I suddenly want to learn a kind of music or art to make my life more interesting.
<br /> From this interview, I know more about the art. It is good for us to know more about this kind of cultural. I hope I can have more chance to know more about art. It is really funny!

<br />  We went to the music play called ‘mobile music ’. It is hold in Olympic Stadium. And it is beginning at 19:30 p.m. There are many stars in this music play. And my favorite star called Lin Youjia is coming to this music play. I think his voice is really good and attractive. When the music play was start, it began to raining. We all wear the cap and see our favourite stars. I think everyone not only audience but also the singers all very hard because they should under the rain to perform or to see. The music play was until about 12 o’clock. It is really too late. I was tired but also very happy. I like the music play although there are many not famous singers in the music play. And some audiences not pay attention to them. I think it is impolite and we should respect them even some of them we never heard. Maybe in one day we can hear their names, maybe they will be famous. We should respect their work because they are hard when they perform under the rain. I learn many things from their spirit. And I know more about music, if you are confident, you will have chance on the stage. I think this music play not just interesting for me. It help me many things in life. I will never forget this experience.

I went to there with my classmate in middle school. It is held in Jiangsu provincial art museum. This exhibition shows us the painting. And it is use the oil paints to create the paintings.
<br /> There are many artists form Jiangsu to make the exhibition. It is contemporary artwork. Most of them are about person paintings and views paintings. And it all made in several years. My favourite artwork that I find is the painting called ‘taste’. It is made by Qing Yibei, not very famous in the China. The artwork was made in 2008. And in the artwork, I saw many things. It is not many shapes and not uses many lines in the picture. The colour is cold colour. There is a woman in the picture, and her hand is hole a little apple she has already eaten. Behind her, there is a big mountain and many small houses in the mountain. The sky is very blue. The woman’s face has many wrinkles.  
<br />  The artwork makes me think very sad. I am not feel good after seeing. The woman held an apple. The apple is already eaten. I think the artwork bring me a feeling that is bitter feel. It is make me remind the poor life when China built the country not during very long years. The people have nothing to eat and China is a poor country. And it also made me remind now. Some areas are very poor in China, and they have not money, have not things to eat. They really poor but they cannot change this because the location and the economic. I feel very sad about their lives. It is really unfair but people can’t chose where was born. I think this artwork let us know we should take care of these people and give them more money. We also should know our lives are happiness and we should treasure the life that we have.
<br />  I really think this artwork is successful and it is good. First, it can made us think more things out of the artwork. And I think the woman’s eyes are the most successful part. Because I really think the eyes can talk to others. And from the eyes, I can see the hopeful to the hopeful to the new life and a bit helpless for the present life. I like the artwork but I will not buy this if I can buy this. Because I think the good thing will share to all the people. Let more people accept this kind of education.
<br />From this painting exhibition, I know more about art’s spirit. I think I will attend more exhibitions like this. Because it really meaningful. Maybe at next, I am interested in foreign paintings. Then I can know more about art cultural and know more about the art. I really like this unforgettable exhibition, I think it is good for us to learn more about cultural.

I went Gulou Park with my classmate Jane and Tammy. And also, our teacher Mr.Burt, Ms.Bartell, Ms.Hadley and Mr.Gallinelli were going with us. 
<br />  When I go there, they all took actions to find people and give them a hug. I chosen this event because I think it’s very meaningful and interesting things. This can help people to know more about each other. I am very shy and talk very few to strangers. I really like this event. I give the free hug to many old women. They are very kind and always smile to us. We gave them the small card and told them this event. Some people are shy, they refuse us. But some people are agree with this. I think it's really exciting activity. I felt very good when I give my hug to strangers. But the feeling when some people refuse us is not very good. But maybe they are afraid strangers, too. This activity is very popular in foreign countries. It is encourage us to be friendly and support people who might never otherwise have any kind of connection. 
<br />  Through this activity, I learn how to talk to the strangers. I am not so shy when I talk to others. I think it’s very meaningful. I like this event and I hope to have more events like this. It is good for us more easy-going and more kind when we meet strangers. I like this activity!

The trip is really long and we just play cards on the car. About 1 hour, everyone just fall asleep. When we arrived in shanghai EXPO, it about 9’o clock. I just want to say, the people is too much! We lined about 1 hour and get in to the expo. But every country’s stadium has a long line. My friends and I chose the Egypt pavilion because we think Egypt is a mysterious country and we are interested in mummy. But when we enter in the pavilion after lined 2 hours, we are disappointment. There is only a mask in the pavilion and a video introduce the country. Not any mummy or interesting things. After we watch the Egypt pavilion we do not want go any pavilions. We just find a restaurant and drink some water eat some food. We heard that Japan pavilion is really funny but the police told us it will line about 6 hours! I think it must be crazy. I forgive it and just go to some small pavilion or just stand outside. The passport which is given by school, we just gain 2 stamps in it. The passport is first time used in expo of Canada. 
<br />  It is a really boring and tired trip because the people are too much and the hot day.

It is a new restaurant and the decorating style is a kind of Southeast Asia style. The restaurant has many people and the service is really good. We find a seat beside the window. Outside the window, there is a little bridge and the small river under the bridge. It is a quiet good and beautiful view can help people eating. It is better to costumers and when people eat these foods, they will feel happier and fantastic.
<br />  I feel it is a good restaurant and a really good atmosphere. The food is really delicious and I love Thailand food. The taste is a little bit strange but is fantastic. My favourite food is the curry crabs. This is delicious and use curry to cook. I love crabs very much, that is why I love this food. We also eat some snakes about traditional Thailand food. It is also very good and taste well. 
<br />  I like eat foreign restaurant because food is a kind of culture, we through food to know more about a country. It is a good way and a good choice to know more about a place.

Actually, I think it is not very delicious and I do not like it. The Mexico food is too simple and it taste like Chinese food. The Mexico rice is famous but I do not like it. I order the beef and I think it is not well because the taste is too strange. The environment is good but there are too many people in there. Although the food is not delicious my parents and I still have a happy lunch because we talking to each other and have a good time. 
<br />  I found that have lunch with family is a good chance to chat with family. In the other days we do not have enough time to have communication. We have a good time chatting in the Mexico restaurant. 
<br />  However I do not like the food in Mexico. But it is a good chance for me to know more about Mexico and its culture. 
<br />  Finally, we went home but this lunch will be a fantastic time in my life.

Jiming Temple is a really famous temple in Nanjing. Every year, when spring festival, there are many people in Nanjing went to the Temple and hope to have a lucky year. To people in Nanjing, Jiming Temple like a sign. 
<br />  In China, Buddhism is famous and people believe it well. This temple built nearly xuanwu lake and it was rebuilt in the Ming Dynasty. Behind the temple there is a wall called taicheng. And there is also a famous vegetarian restaurant and it is healthy.
<br />  Compare with the Protestantism, the Buddhism is closer to me because it is popular in china many years. 
<br />  When I am in the jiming Temple, some Buddhism is said the Buddhist scriptures and it is hard to understand. Although I cannot understand, I still listen it because I want to be respect to the Buddhism.
<br />  I always do not understand why people want belief. I think when people have belief in their hearts, they may feel they have dream and spirit. 
<br />  during the religious service, I know more about the religions especially the Buddhist. I think I will attend more Buddhist events in the furture.
