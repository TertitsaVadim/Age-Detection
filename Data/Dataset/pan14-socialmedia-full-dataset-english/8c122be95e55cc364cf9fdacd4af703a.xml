<br /><br />In an effort to increase sales and gain market traction, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jYXJsb2NhdGUuY29tL0xleHVzQ2Fycy5hc3B4" target="_blank">Lexus</a> announced their “December to Remember” sales event began Tuesday November 1st and will run through January 3, 2012.  The luxury brand is offering financing and lease specials on various 2011 and 2012 models.  Specials vary by region but include financing rates as low as 0.9% and leases as low as $309 a month on certain vehicles for well qualified buyers.  
<br /><br />The early sales kickoff was prompted by Lexus’ inventory issues from production disruptions from Japan’s earthquake as well as slow sales.  Sales were down 14.2% for October compared with a year ago, and sales remain off 16.2 percent for the year.  Inventory is rebounding though, with supplies up from September but still low compared to last year.  As of Oct. 1, the brand had just a 29 days' supply compared to a 47 days' supply at the same time last year.   
<br /><br />Lexus is hoping the sales push will help the dealer regain its longtime position as the luxury sales leader.  
<br /><br />Stop by your local <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jYXJsb2NhdGUuY29tL0xleHVzQ2Fycy5hc3B4" target="_blank">Lexus dealer</a> and check out their holiday specials.

The biggest visual overhauls to the seven-passenger, three-row crossover appear at the front of the vehicle. The Flex’s boxy shape, a standard of the vehicle since its debut last year, will be replaced with rounder edges and an overall sleeker look. The blue manufacturer logo above the front grille will be replaced with the model name: “FLEX” in block letters. Three new color options will be introduced, as well as two-tone roof options.
<br /><br />Interior updates are set to include both cosmetic and functional upgrades. The 2013 Flex’s interior will give customers a modern, sophisticated driver zone, featuring updated clusters, steering wheel and electronic finish panels, as well as new seat trim. The new Flex will feature MyFord Touch®, Ford’s entertainment and communication system. The newest MyFord Touch system features a cleaner display, with two 4.2-inch screens in the instrument cluster and an eight-inch screen in the center stack, as well as more options for usability and access.

<br /><br />The Los Angeles Auto Show was the location for <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jYXJsb2NhdGUuY29tL0ZvcmRDYXJzLmFzcHg_" target="_blank">Ford’</a>s announcement regarding the redesign of their 2013 Ford Escape SUV.  The radical redesign of the small sport utility vehicle will include a sleeker profile with an arcing roof line and new high-tech features.  
<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jYXJsb2NhdGUuY29tL0ZvcmRDYXJzLmFzcHg_" target="_blank">Ford</a>  is hoping the new Escape model, which surpassed the Honda CR-V as the number one selling SUV in America for 2011, can remain in the top spot with the help of the redesign. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jYXJsb2NhdGUuY29tL0hvbmRhQ2Fycy5hc3B4" target="_blank">Honda</a> is right on Ford’s tails though, with a redesign for the CR-V (which led sales from 2007 to 2010) and increased supplies after the Japanese earthquake and tsunami interrupted production.  
<br /><br />The 2013 Ford Escape will include the following upgrades and changes:
<br /><br />•	The introduction of two optional Ecoboost engines: a 2.0-liter, 237 horsepower version for stronger acceleration and a l.6-liter, 173 horsepower engine for higher gas mileage. The base-model Escape will come with a standard, non-turbo 2.5-liter, 171-horsepower four-cylinder engine, an update from the current model. No optional V-6 engine will be offered and Ford is dropping its gas-electric hybrid version as well.  
<br />•	Increased cargo capacity: 68 cubic feet with all rear seats down, or 34 cubic feet behind the rear seats
<br />•	New high-tech features including parallel parking assist and a power rear liftgate
<br />•	The entertainment, navigation and phone system will be an upgraded version of MyFord Touch.
<br />•	New safety features will include Curve Control, which automatically slows the vehicle if it is cornering too fast. New technology in the side air bags also adjusts their inflation to take into account the size of the passenger.
<br />•	The use of recycled and soy-based interior materials

		<document id="1d2304d25faac90e0259d7c87870ccaf" url=""><![CDATA[SL Roadster to Drop 300 Pounds<br/><br/>Mercedes-Benz has released plans to unveil an all-new SL Roadster at the North American International Auto Show in January. The new SL takes its name – SL standing for “sporty” and “lightweight” – to another level with an aluminum body that weighs over 300 pounds less than its predecessor. 
<br /><br />The SL’s new bodyshell is 89 percent aluminum, with only the A-pillars, the roof frame, and a few other components made from heavier material. Bionic design structures further reduced the vehicle’s weight. The aluminum bodyshell, along with a variety of coating materials, guarantees the best corrosion prevention measures on the market – there’s no point of attack for rust. A variety of high-tech joining techniques are used throughout the exterior and interior of the car. The overall result gives the driver more power and less weight, with better comfort, more safety, and lower levels of resonance and vibration. 
<br /><br />Exact horsepower, gas mileage, and torque numbers haven’t yet been released for the new SL Roadster, but Mercedes is expected to release more information and pictures before the Detroit show.

<br /><br />The study included more than 25 hybrid vehicles that had twin conventional vehicles that they could be compared to.  The study was conducted over an 8 year span from 2003 to 2011, by the Data Institute which is an affiliate of the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.
<br /><br />The author of the study Matt Moore said that weight is a large factor in the analysis.  Hybrids are about 10 percent heavier than standard cars, and the extra weight gives them an advantage compared to other cars.  The reason that hybrid cars are heavier than conventional cars is because of the complex high-tech batteries and engines that are required for their operation.  In essence the same part of the hybrid car that is making it more fuel efficient is also making it safer. 
<br /><br />Simple physics states that in a crash involving two cars, the smaller and or lighter car will be the one that incurs the most damage.  The weight of the larger car will be more likely to push the lighter car backward at impact, rather than vice versa.  Subsequently, the smaller car’s driver and passengers have the higher risk of getting injured in an accident.
<br /><br />Many newer hybrids such as the Toyota Prius, Nissan Leaf, and Chevy Volt were not included in the study because they do not have twin conventional cars to be compared to.
<br /><br />This study conducted by the Highway Loss Data Institute is giving hybrid cars one more reason to continue their move up consumer shopping lists.  From fuel efficiency to safety Hybrid cars are continuing to become a more viable car option.

GM, Ford, and Chrysler are among three of the large automakers who recently promised to grow their workforce by 2015.
<br /><br />According to a new forecast, the auto industry is going to provide a jobs boom in the Midwest over the next four years.  The Center for Automotive Research, is estimating that automakers and auto parts suppliers will likely have to hire approximately 200,000 workers by 2015.  
<br /><br />This potential increase in workforce is great news for the states that make up the nation’s autobelt, Ohio, Indiana, and Michigan, as they have been hit hard with substantial job losses in recent years.  While it may not be enough to recoup all of the job losses that have been endured in recent years, it will sure be a good start to getting back on the right track.
<br /><br />The potential job gains are reported due to recent labor deals with General Motors, Ford Motor, and the Chrysler Group.  All three of the respective labors deals made this fall include promises to hire new employees to build the next generation of cars and trucks.
<br /><br />GM promised to retain 6,400 workers in its labor deal, Chrysler promised to add 2,100 in their deal, and Ford will add over 6,000 in their deal.  However, the largest increases will come from auto parts suppliers who will have to increase their workforces to meet the needs of the growing automakers.
<br /><br />As can be expected the Midwest is welcoming the job growth in light of the recent economic climate.  The creation of 200,000 jobs will no doubt go a long way to help the economies of Ohio, Indiana, and Michigan.

<br /><br />According to ratings provided by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration released this month the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jYXJsb2NhdGUuY29tL1RveW90YUNhcnMuYXNweA__" target="_blank">Toyota Camry</a> has earned a five-star composite score.  The NHTSA composite scores are composed of five-star ratings for frontal, rollover, and a combined side pole and barrier tests.  The side-pole test simulates a 20 mph side-impact crash into a 10-inch diameter pole or tree.
<br /><br />The redesigned 2012 Camry earned a five-star overall rating getting four stars in the frontal test, five stars in the side-crash test, and four stars in the rollover test. The 2012 Camry features a reinforced body structure that utilizes high-strength steel construction to help withstand cabin deformity during severe collisions, absorb impact energies, and help enhance occupant safety.
<br /><br />Only three cars, Toyota Camry, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jYXJsb2NhdGUuY29tL0NhZGlsbGFjQ2Fycy5hc3B4" target="_blank">Cadillac CTS</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jYXJsb2NhdGUuY29tL0NoZXZyb2xldENhcnMuYXNweA__" target="_blank">Chevrolet Camaro</a>, out of the 22 trucks, SUV’s, crossovers, and passenger cars tested earned a five-star rating.  NHTSA said it will test 74 vehicles for the 2012 model year, including 42 passenger cars, 22 SUV’s/crossovers, 8 pickups, and 2 minivans, representing 81% of the 2012 models by sales volume.
<br /><br />The NHTSA directs highway safety and consumer programs and is dedicated to achieving the highest standards of excellence in motor vehicle and highway safety.  The agency has set the standard for safety helping consumers find safer cars with its five-star ratings.
<br /><br />The fact that the Camry earned this five-star overall score after enduring the rigorous NHTSA testing is a testament to the strong design and safety focused engineering put into the Camry.

The concept model will give some glimpse into the redesigned <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jYXJsb2NhdGUuY29tL0hvbmRhQ2Fycy5hc3B4" target="_blank">Honda</a> model.
<br /><br />The 2013 Honda Accord Coupe production model is likely to mirror the concept in a number of ways, including appearance and powertrain performance. The concept will feature a 3.5 V6 engine with a continuously variable transmission, expected to provide five percent more power and ten percent more fuel economy than the current Accord model. 
<br /><br />The Accord Coupe Concept will feature a dynamic and aggressive profile, similar to that of the redesigned 2013 Accord. 2013 will mark the Accord’s 36th year, and will bring the release of the ninth-generation version of the popular car. The Honda Accord was named one of Car and Driver’s “10 Best” cars of 2012, for a record 26th time.

The new SRT Viper will be an individual in the SRT different brand, and is expected to host a whole new set of features.
<br /><br />The new SRT Viper will serve as the cornerstone for the SRT brand, Chrysler’s Street and Racing Technology sub-brand. Currently, Chrysler’s SRT lineup includes the Chrysler 300 SRT8, the Jeep Grand Cherokee SRT8, and the Dodge Challenger and Charger SRT8.
<br /><br />In addition to adding to the SRT fleet, the new Viper will bring more jobs to <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jYXJsb2NhdGUuY29tL0NocnlzbGVyQ2Fycy5hc3B4" target="_blank">Chrysler</a> production in Detroit. The 2013 Viper SRT will be produced exclusively in Chrysler’s Connor Avenue Assembly Plant in Detroit. The plant was shuttered a year and a half ago, when the production of the Dodge Viper was halted. Between 1992 and 2010, just over 28,000 Vipers were hand-built in two plants by Chrysler employees.
<br /><br />The 2013 Viper will debut next spring, at the 2012 New York Auto Show in April. Production of the Dodge Viper ended in July 2010, and the new car is expected to be a total revamp.Speculation, especially regarding the possible return of the Viper’s classic 10-cylindar engine, abounds.

<br /><br />A quick Twitter search for “Lexus commercial” reveals reactions ranging from sentimental: “I really do like the Lexus commercials where the chick gets her man a new car,” to the hateful: “I'm so sick of these Lexus car commercials for Christmas. I mean honestly, how many rich people have chimneys large enough?” to the analytical: “Why in all the new Lexus commercials the woman is the one giving the car as a gift?! I guess women are doing the most in the economy now.”
<br /><br />The recognizable jingle, the predictable scene – Lexus commercials have become a Christmas tradition to love or hate. They are, however, working.
<br /><br />December is one of the biggest sales month for Lexus and other luxury car makers, due to increased marketing and year-end discounting. This year, more Lexus cars are selling: sales were up nearly ten percent compared to last year’s sales during November, and are expected to continue to increase through the end of December. 
<br /><br />Love or hate the Lexus tune, the automaker isn’t planning any major changes from the conspicuous ad campaign soon. Haters may find some solace in Honda’s new ad campaign, parodying the Lexus ads.

<br /><br />The Toyota Prius C – to be sold in Japan as the Toyota Aqua – is a compact hatchback in Toyota’s Prius line of small hybrid vehicles. The Prius C is slated to be released in the U.S. later in 2012. 
<br /><br />The Prius C is expected to sell well in Japan, where compact cars are popular. The price tag, under $20,000 and significantly lower than other Prius vehicles, is expected to appeal to American audiences as well. Motor Trend Magazine has predicted that the car’s size, price, and powerful hybrid engine will make the C Toyota’s “most important Prius.”
<br /><br />The newest Prius comes loaded with standard options, including Bluetooth connectivity, a safety system including nine airbags, and much more. Entune, Toyota’s popular infotainment system, will also be available on the C. 
<br /><br />The real selling point of the Prius C is, of course, the gas mileage. The car’s 1.5-liter Synergy Drive hybrid engine is expected to provide better that 50-mpg city fuel mileage on the EPA cycle to make it the highest of any non-plug-in model.
<br /><br />The Toyota C is set to go on sale in the first half of 2012. Toyota is expected to roll out several more Prius models through the year.

According to CNW Marketing, pent-up demand for new cars during tough economic times led to a surge in used car sales last year.
<br /><br />CNW says many traditional new car buyers have shifted to the pre-owned vehicle market during the economic recession, and many are still option for used cars. The increased pool of used car buyers has led to higher demand for used cars, especially newer models. “Nearly new” vehicles – ones that have just come off short-term leases and are backed by warranties – are in particularly high demand; however, a downturn in dealer leasing over the past years has fewer of these vehicles on the market.
<br /><br />With used car values up, both dealerships and private parties have pushed to sell their pre-owned vehicles, both traditionally and online. The combination of demand and marketing push worked: CNW predicts that the trend of record used cars sales will continue into next year.

<br /><br />The 700C, a concept the automaker created to explore future minivan appearances, was unveiled Monday. Chrysler plans to use the 700C’s time at the Detroit auto show to garner consumer feedback on the looks of the new concept vehicle – futuristic, rounded, distinctly crossover-y. 
<br /><br />The concept vehicle features blended front and rear door handles, as well as sliding doors. Its leaf-shaped front windows slice across the front sides of the vehicle, and the Chrysler emblem is printed on the rear glass, adding lots of interesting window design. The interior of the 700C is smaller than a traditional van, but still features three rows.
<br /><br />The concept crossover was built merely as an exercise in design, and is not likely to see production. However, speculation about the replacement of Chrylser’s Town and County and the Dodge Grand Caravan – competing models from the same automaker, both rapidly aging – added to the 700C hype.

The actual reveal of the all-new CUV follows a progressive reveal of the Encore on Buick's Facebook page.
<br /><br />Buick says that its family-friendly, five-passenger Encore targets buyers seeking style and fuel efficiency from a crossover. The crossover’s exterior styling features are similar to those of Buick Enclave, with chrome accents, painted lower side panels, and Buick’s signature waterfall grille. The interior boasts many of Buick’s classic luxury trim features, such as wood grain trim, as well as multiple available features. Cargo space will also be a selling point to family buyers: the Encore features 18.8 cubic feet of storage behind the rear seat, topping comparable small CUV models to be released this year by higher-end makers like Audi and BMW.
<br /><br />A 140-horsepower Ecotec 1.4-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine, with a six-speed automatic transmission, will power the vehicle. Buick has not released fuel economy information, but the same engine used in the Encore powers the Chevrolet Cruze and Sonic, both of which achieve more than 40 miles per gallon.
<br /><br />The 2013 Buick Encore will be available in dealerships during the spring of 2013. It will be available in four trims: a base trim, Convenience, Leather, and Premium.

<br /><br />2012’s North American International Auto Show saw the highest opening day attendance in five years, up more 5,000 from last year. A total of 195,024 attended the show on Saturday and Sunday, during the opening weekend. Overall, three-quarters of a million people are expected to explore, shop, and dream about the concept and production vehicles on display.
<br /><br />There was no shortage of vehicles to view at the show: more than 500 cars, trucks, SUVs, and crossovers are on display. Everything from production models by the Big 3 to high-end concepts fill the Cobo Center in Detroit. 
<br /><br />The revival of the American auto industry may be the reason behind increased car enthusiasm. In 2009, the North American auto industry produced 8.6 million cars, nearly a third less than the previous year. In 2011, the number had climbed back to around 13.5 million; much closer to the “old,” pre-recession average.This year, production is expected to continue to rise.

The aging trend of vehicles has stalled U.S. auto sales since 2009, when they reached a 30-year low of 10.4 million new cars and trucks sold.  The slow growth has put the brakes on auto companies and parts manufacturers hiring in large numbers.  
<br /><br />Last month the unemployment rate fell to the lowest level it’s been in three years at 8.5%.   There seems to be sunshine on the horizon for dealerships.

The Consumer Reports National Research Center has recently conducted a survey of the 2012 Car-Brand Perception.  Toyota, Ford, Honda, Chevy and Mercedes-Benz maintained their stay as perennial leaders of the past and present, but watched their point gap decrease.  The small electric-car builder has seen a rise with recent dramatic events like gas price increases and the economic downturn.
<br /><br />The Top 5 Car Brands by Perception are led by Toyota, Ford, Honda, Chevy and Mercedes-Benz, with BMW, Volvo, Cadillac, Lexus and Tesla rounding out the top ten.  The survey asked the consumer how important each factor was to the respondent <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jYXJsb2NhdGUuY29tL1NlYXJjaENhcnMuYXNweA__" target="_blank">making a car purchase</a>.  Safety was the top consideration, followed by quality, value, performance, environmental friendliness, design and style, and technology and innovation.  
<br /><br />Consumers are recognizing the forecast of more electric cars to the market, with Fisker and Tesla making a showing in the latest survey.  Small producers that were added to the 2012 survey are scoring better than many well-established brands.  Awareness is still relatively low on many of these electric car brands compared to the more established companies, but respondents familiar with Fisker and Tesla held them in high regard in certain categories.  
<br /><br />Car-brand leaders do not stand out from the rest of the pack the way they have in the past, and individual factors show the perceptions leading to significant changes.  Category scores reflect the number of times that the particular make was mentioned as a standard of the particular attribute in all seven categories.  
<br /><br />Consumer Reports National Research Center conducted a random, nationwide telephone survey of 2,045 adults from Dec. 1-5, 2011, and collected survey data from 1,702 adults in households that had at least one car.

Bentley is returning to northern Finland next month to offer guests a chance to drive the 6L 567HP Continental GT coupe and 621HP Continental Supersports coupe.  The course is unusual and challenging for <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jYXJsb2NhdGUuY29tL1NlYXJjaENhcnMuYXNweA__" target="_blank">all drivers</a>, but four-time World Rally Champion Juha Kankkunen will be there to teach.  
<br /><br />“The circuits are crafted from snow and ice and are unlike any other track or road you have seen before,” says Peter Barnes a senior instructor with Bentley Driving.
<br /><br />“As well as drawing inspiration from Juha’s world records, Bentley’s engineers and professional drivers have used Finland’s extreme conditions to enhance the safety and handling capabilities of our cars. We’ve got a great deal of knowledge and expertise to share but the accent for Power on Ice will always be on fun and taking part in something far more memorable than a normal skiing holiday,” adds Peter.
<br /><br />“Power on Ice mixes the pure exhilaration of slaloming a Bentley supercar on a purpose-built course or taking a spin around a ‘figure of eight’ track, with the opportunity to acquire advanced techniques from a personal instructor, that will enable drivers to handle their cars with confidence even in the harshest weather conditions,” Peter explains.
<br /><br />Bentley’s continued innovation and luxury reputation meets inspiration and imagination in Finland for a totally unique driving experience.  The Continental is suited for winter driving with the all-wheel-drive system with Torsen differential, ensuring dynamic and safe handling on all road surface.

It is similar to the Honda Crosstour in design and look, and has proportions to the BMW X6.  
<br /><br />The sloping rear roofline descends over the rear hatch in a conventional manner.  Surprisingly, a button will promote the ‘Falcon Wing’ rear side doors to ascend towards the sky and show DeLorean characteristics.  
<br /><br />The roomy interior has three rows, with seven seats and has much more cargo room than most crossovers, especially when the Falcon Wings have been raised.  
<br /><br />The ‘frunk’ is a trunk that Tesla has placed in the front of the car, with the engine in the rear.  Powertrain and chassis similarities are almost identical with the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jYXJsb2NhdGUuY29tL1NlYXJjaENhcnMuYXNweA__" target="_blank">Tesla Model S</a> sedan, except the Model S is RWD.  Two electric motors can be ordered on the Model X, so one can drive the front wheels and the other can drive the back.  
<br /><br />The X’s launch might still be a few years away, but a few details came out in Hawthorne, California’s design building.  The battery pack comes in 60 kw and 85 kw hours. The Model X weighs 10-12% more than the Model S, so it will suffer than in performing.  
<br />Tesla states that the Model X gets to 60mph in 4.4 seconds.  The Model X will go into production in 2013.  
<br /> “The thing I've always wanted to do, the thing I'm going to do next, is a mass-market car,” said founder and CEO Elon Musk.  
<br /><br />The mass-market car has been called the Gen III, and powertrain components from the Tesla Model S and X can be scaled down to fit even smaller cars, like the Toyota RAV4 EV and Smart ED, both built with Tesla powertrain components.  
<br /><br />“That's my aspiration, not a promise, I really believe we'll be profitable within 12 months,” said Musk. “Early next year.”

Who is currently making their way to leading the realm of vehicle safety you may ask, well the answers Ford, that’s who.
<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jYXJsb2NhdGUuY29tL0ZvcmRfVVM_" target="_blank">Ford</a> has upgraded its state-of-the-art vehicle testing track simulator (VIRTTEX) that was developed in 2001. The simulator is composed of a dome that sits on top of a hydraulic system. This then replicated vehicle movement. The upgrades help measure driver braking, acceleration, and driver’s reactions in varying conditions.
<br /><br />VIRTTEX has helped Ford examine the driver responses and created advanced early-warning systems to better prepare the driver in case a potential collision may pop up. The updates in VIRTTEX have already assisted Ford in determining when the early-warnings should be set off.
<br /><br />The VIRTTEX simulator upgrades have put <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jYXJsb2NhdGUuY29tL0ZvcmRDYXJzLmFzcHg_" target="_blank">Ford</a> on top in the safety development world. Ford new safety updates will challenge all competing car companies to be safer than they are, working out even better for the consumer.

Hyundai took that phrase to heart dishing out an extremely high amount of money for their recent advertising ventures. Hyundai’s U.S. CEO states that this risk was well worth it.
<br /><br />Hyundai was a large sponsor of this year’s Grammy Awards, aired two commercials during the Super Bowl in February, and ran nine spots during the Academy Awards last month. Many auto manufacturers weren’t even willing to put up the money for one Super Bowl TV ad spot.
<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jYXJsb2NhdGUuY29tL1NlYXJjaENhcnMuYXNweA__" target="_blank">Hyundai’s</a>advertising budget is roughly half-a-billion dollars, so in the grand scheme of things, advertising in the big events isn’t setting them back too far. In February Hyundai’s sales increased 12.8% and grew their market share from 4.4% to 4.5%.
<br /><br />Hyundai is looking to establish their selves as large brand, thus targeting audiences through these large media events makes them appear to be a large brand. Hyundai has had an extreme influx of traffic to their consumer websites, especially after those large promotional events.
<br /><br />The <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jYXJsb2NhdGUuY29tL1Jlc2VhcmNoUGFnZXMvMjAxMi1IeXVuZGFpLUVsYW50cmEtNGRyX1Nkbl9NYW5fR0xTXyhBbGFiYW1hX1BsYW50KS9SZXNlYXJjaFN1bW1hcnkuYXNweD9zaWRfMTA4NjEyMl9yZHdzaWRfNjYwMjBfbWFrZWlkXzEwMDAwMTRfeWVhcl8yMDEyX21vZGVsX0VsYW50cmE_" target="_blank">Elantra</a> was promoted during the Academy Awards and sales grew 51.6% in February. Sales of the Accent subcompact car rose 23.8% in the month. Those are just two of the increases that Hyundai has seen since their new marketing efforts have been set into action.
<br /><br />It’s obvious to see Hyundai’s strategy has recently been successful, but how long can the sales increase? The highly viewed programs are started to spread out through the rest of the year, it will be interesting to see what is going to happen to Hyundai’s sales in the next year.
