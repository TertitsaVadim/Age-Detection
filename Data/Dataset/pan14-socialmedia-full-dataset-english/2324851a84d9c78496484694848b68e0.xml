<br />I will not let this get me tired, so much to do, and no phone call!            
<br /> Life really throws you a curve when you think, everyone is giving up on you.<strong></strong>  
<br />You can't live for anyone else, but yourself, I have tried that, it just breaks your heart!
<br />With that said, I shall try to live life, knowing that no one will be around to pick the peices up if I fall apart!!  SO THE OBJECT IS NOT TO FALL!!!   That is so hard,... I will just leave it at that..

<br />Well, I was hoping and wishing that we would.   I waited long enough for him. AND THE WAIT WAS WORTH IT!!! <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/hug.gif" alt=":)" />  What has happened in the past year, is the past.  All I Want is for us to be HAPPY!!  I look forward to his phone calls, and text massages. But most of all, I look forward to him holding me, making me MELT.... he does it so well.. Could it be, cause I LOVE HIM SO MUCH...  We have our own instant Family, I love him even more, cause he loves my daughter like his own... and even though I have not met his son, I do love him also. 
<br />Someday we all will be together, I do hope so.   I will stop for now. My LOVE FOR YOU IS RUNNING SO DEEP INSIDE ME, I WANT THE WORLD TO KNOW WHO I LOVE, BUT FOR NOW, IT WILL HAVE TO BE  KEPT TO OURSELFS.
