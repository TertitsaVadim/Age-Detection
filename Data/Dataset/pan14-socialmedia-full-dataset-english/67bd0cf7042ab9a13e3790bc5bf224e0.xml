The mercury inside the vacuole will change slightly because of the temperature. The expansion of mercury will make its length change obviously. The variation range of human body temperature is usually from 35 ? to 42 ?, so the thermometer's scale is usually from 35 ? to 42 ?, and each degree is divided into 10 parts. As a result, the thermometer cab read accurately to the degree of 1 / 10. tube neck of the Thermometer in the lower part near the vacuole part is a narrow curved neck, at the test temperature, the mercury of  vacuole , volume expansion when it is heated,  mercury of the neck part can rise to the tube in a position, with its body temperature to reach thermal equilibrium, the column is constant.Necessary Tricks that Deserve to Learn for Maintaining Your &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.medicalequipmentpro.com%2FBlood-Pressure-Monitor%26quot"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.medicalequipmentpro.com/Blood-Pressure-Monitor&quot</a>; title=&quot;Blood Pressure Monitor&quot;&gt;Blood Pressure Monitor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When thermometer is taken away from the body, the mercury will contract due to the low temperature outside. The mercury then breaks at the narrow swan-neck part, which prevents the mercury in the upper tube from going down and makes the mercury column keep the same height as the thermometer touches human body. Clinical thermometer is maximum thermometer and can record the maximum temperature it has ever measured. The thermometer used should be adjusted back to zero that is to toss it downwards to make the mercury inside the tube go back to the vacuole. Other thermometers should never be thrown. This is a main difference between thermometer and other liquid thermometers.&lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.medicalequipmentpro.com%2FPULSE-OXIMETER%26quot"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.medicalequipmentpro.com/PULSE-OXIMETER&quot</a>; title=&quot;Pulse Oximeter&quot;&gt;Pulse Oximeter&lt;/a&gt; , Top Mother's Day Buys for Love&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first thermometer was invented by Galileo in 16th century, but convenient and dependable thermometers were invented until 300 years later. In 1654, students of Galileo used alcohol in place of water, and made a kind of thermometer that can`t influenced by atmosphere. And it was first used to measure people`s temperature by Santorio –an Italian professor of medicine. About 10 years later, Arc De Mea made another kind of thermometer by hydrargyrum instead of alcohol. From then on, this kind of thermometer was widely used in clinical diagnosis. Although the mercury thermometer has been widely used in clinical section, it has been found that there are still many inconvenient points. So in 1867, a doctor from London, Britain called Allbutt invented a kind of thermometer which is specialized to measure human and animal temperature in accordance to the character and demand of this process. Since then, the thermometer was finally invented and has been used ever since.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mercury is stored at the end of the inside ball of the mercury. When the mercury is heated, it will expended, and goes up along the very narrow grass tubes. Therefore, a slight change of body temperature will lead to a large-scale rise of the mercury in the glass tube. After measuring body temperature, remember to swing the thermometer sharply to let the mercury go back to the mercury bulb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1714, Gabriel Fahrenheit invented a mercury thermometer which is graded within the limits of water's freezing point and body's temperature. A Dutch doctor used it to take temperatures of his patients with fever. However, most doctors didn`t use it due to its big size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later, Albutt designed a kind of thermometer which could quickly and accurately measure the temperature and whose length was only about 15 cm. It is regretful that Auerbert's thermometer came out too late to give help to Karl Windlitch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1868, the German professor Vunderlish published the book &quot;Disease and Body Temperature&quot;, recording 25,000 cases of body temperature changes of patients. While the thermometer he uses was twice of Allbutt's and everytime it would cost him 20 minutes to record one temperature.&lt;/p&gt;

In the newly released report, Merrill Lynch, Bank of America said that as Dubai's official data is not completely open,The Dubai world's debt is lack of transparencyin the whole crisis. These uncertainties would significantly push up the risk premium of debt guarantees, and the restructuring plan that Dubai World announced will probably impact on prospects for economic recovery in the Gulf region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report shows that the current debt exposure in the UAE has not been fully revealed, these debts are still problematic. In the $184 billion debts of UAE, Dubai owes $88 billion and Abu Dhabi owes $90 billion. Bank of Merrill Lynch says despite $88 billion  debt, Dubai this year, there are still nearly $500 million in mature debt in the next three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which includ about $120 billion in 2010, while $19 billion s and $180 billion respectively in year of 2011 and 2012. Analysts predict that the total debts of Dubai world are 26.5 billion dollars, of which 80% need to be paid within the next 3 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, the debt of turnover may be costly higher than these valuations, for these figures include only the amount of principal repayment. The Central Bank of UAE has taken an active attitude. To appease the market-panic by the debts crisis, UAE Central Bank in Abu Dhabi announced on Sunday that it is setting extra liquidity facilities, backing banks sectors. In the statement, the central bank of UAE said that it has notified the local banks that they are accessible to the special extra liquidity arrangement tools connected with current accounts of central bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, the interest rate is 50 basis points more than 3-month interbank interest rate of the Bank of the United Arab Emirates. For the central bank's statement, the United Arab Emirates economist John Sfakianakis said this move was mainly to restore the confidence of investors around the world to the Arab region, so that the panic caused by the crisis would not be broadened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But he also said that the statement did not mention Dubai, meanwhile the central bank did not disclose the the size or value of this arrangement . For the suspicion and speculation of the outside world of, a Dubai and Abu Dhabi officials denied the existence rift between the two governments on this Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also said that the discussion about supporting Dubai's finance is always done by Dubai and federal agencies like the Central Bank &amp;amp; Ministry of Finance.&lt;/p&gt;

Woodstock can be seen as one of the grand events that well defined the late 1960s; moreover, it had a happy ending.&lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.medicalequipmentpro.com%2FThermometer%26quot"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.medicalequipmentpro.com/Thermometer&quot</a>; title=&quot;Infrared Thermometer&quot;&gt;Infrared Thermometer&lt;/a&gt;  Boots Before Mid-summer Day&lt;/p&gt;
<br />&lt;p&gt;On the mornings of 15th to 18th August, in 1969, tens of thousands of people gathered in the cute ranch on the outskirts of New York. Listening to the moving music of the greatest rock stars of that era while enjoying the delights either legal or illegal. Endured rain and mud and exhaustion and hunger pangs, they felt like a giant community and dispersed.The Best After- Sales:&lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.parkerpenshop.co.uk%26quot"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.parkerpenshop.co.uk&quot</a>; title=&quot;parker pens&quot;&gt;parker pens&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
<br />&lt;p&gt;In the year after1968, when violent riots took place in Chicago, all the large gatherings of young people were considered impossible. So, Woodstock was really a big surprise in that year. Although at last the music festival wasn't carried out as planned just as they said in the slogan &quot;peace and music for three days&quot;. But Woodstock was still a happy gathering, especially when people remembered it. But at that time, the New York City treated it as a disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
<br />&lt;p&gt;As time goes by, Woodstock sounds more like a fluke success: an incredibly elegant successone filled with muddy, mess. Young people who participate in Woodstock were university students, artists, workers and politicans. And of course, the fledgling hippies, and they brought with them their illusive way of life to the scene.&lt;/p&gt;
<br />&lt;p&gt;The unique Woodstock till shines its rose-colored light. It was limited, but filled with happiness at the same time which was totally different from those problems of that time, for example, Vietnam War, ethnic conflict as well as the generation gap which was often referred to. The freedom of Woodstock has double meanings: one is that you can get in and out freely, for it is free.&lt;/p&gt;
<br />&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, it meant liberation including drug abuse and removal of clothes bondage. Some cynics may think: the so-called &quot;peace and music&quot; is more or less another illustration that those spoiled baby boom generation can do everything as they wish. To those Woodstock participants, they brought more drug than food in their luggages to participate in a free concert.&lt;/p&gt;

What are their advantages? Will there be more new Internet companies, whose front end and background might not be present Google, EBAY or Sina model? Even the 3 million strong server clusters of which the operator like Shanda games is proud is the core competitiveness? When the machine in a cartoon's home can play his work through the SNS video device, does he need to go to manage a website? Probably a housewife does not know Html programming, doed not know the word site, but she can only use the SNS cookbook publishing program and a PC in the kitchen to help millions of people master her craft, and her stances on the stove is quite clear. What are you thinking at that time? In today's Internet now, we as the clients are like a dummy, do some slavery things only through the server, look at other people's sites, play other people's games, send emails, in addition to these, we have no freedom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now is the time to start a revolution! Central task of the revolution: how to let more than 10 million computers play their own roles, let users create and control their own information, without the company's servers manipulating us. Individual power is weak, the birth of the Internet makes syntaxis of individuals' and strange forces in a short time possible, while SNS makes the possibility become a reality. The ultimate significance of SNS is to integrate the scattered individuals in the Internet orderly and organicly, just like the silk thread strung pearls. The key is to make the pearls find the pearls and the fish balls find the fish balls. If an SNS always let the fishball fall into the pearl base, or vice versa, it is definitely a disaster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To let the same type of individuals associate perfectly is the core application of SNS. Now almost all of the SNS take the webgame as the core applications for getting users together, which is obviously a departure from the basic value of SNS. SNS takes human relations as a basis. The user inevitably have the behaviour characteristics of participation, communication and sharing. This kind of behaviour spends a lot of time. Therefore, the core applications of SNS should invovle two basic characteristics of simple operation and high frequency property of participation. Internet application which now can meet the two characteristics is only the microblog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Living the life from the days into the scripts is the inevitable result of the information age and the rapid urbanization, which is also the reason why microblog is highly regarded. Significance of microblog for the individual is not confiding but listening. Individuals will be more concerned about the content published by the objects followed, and associate by responses. This series of acts like release, attention, following, recovery, re-release form a virtuous communication cycle. Each man and followed object form a small circle, a number of which link together to form a SNS Network. Microblog makes SNS more valuable. Microblog can not be said to be the only core application of SNS, but the success of microblog definitely can promote the success of SNS, which is of course only the success on applications. From the time used, the mobile terminal has more potential than a computer to become the main platform of SNS. The successful commercial application must tie the other twin brother SMS. Microblog and text message are born to make a pair. Break down the boundaries between the two means not only to create a new network application, but to create a new business model. The key is how to merge the interests of the enterprise, microblog and the user into a harmonious business system.&lt;/p&gt;
