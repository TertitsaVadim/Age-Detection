Compost tea is the Cadillac of liquid plant food and if you make your personal compost tea, your plants will respond with larger and better blooms as well as elevated vigour.<br /><br />And lastly, no matter the size of the container, it is essential to soak it all the way to the bottom at each and every watering.  Continue watering until water emerges from the pot bottom.  This ensures the roots can reach all components of the container and develop properly.
