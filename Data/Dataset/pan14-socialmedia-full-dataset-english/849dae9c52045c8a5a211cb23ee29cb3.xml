They also see me as kind, considerate, and understanding; someone who will always cheer them up and help them out.

<br /><br />Stories (Hekayat)
<br /><br />Forget you?? No dear love, as long as we are together, I won’t forget you
<br />There’re heart, whenever you forget them, you always come back and remember
<br />Stories of my life and the past ones say that I love you
<br />And I never said it, to anyone but you
<br /><br />Stories and memories with you
<br />Say and you know it, that I am the closest to you
<br /><br />With you, I lived my life, in the light, in your eyes
<br />And your love was all my wishes, when our eyes meet
<br /><br />Forget you?? How could I, I can’t love any more
<br />Your love, is my story if you’re with me, or even far
