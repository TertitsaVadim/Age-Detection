<br />An outlaw straight from birth
<br />My mama danced around a fire
<br />And pulled me from the dirt
<br /><br />I live out in the woods
<br />I'm not misunderstood
<br />Maybe you're thinkin' that I won't
<br />I'm thinkin' that I would
<br /><br />That's why I'm dressed in black
<br />Ain't ever comin' back
<br />Cause I'm the black sheep of the family.
<br /><br />No, you look the other way
<br /><br />I'll spit right in your face
<br />Cause I'm the black sheep of the family
<br /><br />One, one sick son of a gun
<br />I'm crushin' you for fun
<br />Don't find yourself on the wrong end
<br />Of anything I've done
<br /><br />Cause I'll lay you to waste
<br />I guess I like the taste
<br />I'll take you out the back door
<br />And shoot you right in the face
<br /><br />Cause I'm the black sheep of the family

<br />Another day's been laid to waste
<br />In my disgrace
<br /><br />Stuck in my head again
<br />Feels like I'll never leave this place
<br />There's no escape
<br /><br />I'm my own worst enemy
<br /><br />I've given up
<br />I'm sick of feeling
<br />Is there nothing you can say
<br /><br />Take this all the way
<br />I'm suffocating
<br />Tell me what the fuck is wrong
<br />With me
<br /><br />I don't know what to take
<br />Thought I was focused but Im scared
<br />I'm not prepared
<br /><br />I hyperventilate
<br />Looking for help somehow somewhere
<br />And no one cares
<br /><br />I'm my own worst enemy
<br /><br />I've given up
<br />I'm sick of feeling
<br />Is there nothing you can say
<br /><br />Take this all the way
<br />I'm suffocating
<br />Tell me what the fuck is wrong
<br />With me
<br /><br />Goddddddd!!!!
<br /><br />Put me out of my misery
<br />Put me out of my misery
<br />Put me out of my
<br />Put me out of my fucking misery
<br /><br />I've given up
<br />I'm sick of feeling
<br />Is there nothing you can say
<br /><br />Take this all the way
<br />I'm suffocating
<br />Tell me what the fuck is wrong
<br />With me

<br />Hopeless, with nothing to say
<br />I screen my eyes
<br />Hoping to see you again
<br /><br />This is my curse (the longing)
<br />This is my curse (time)
<br />This is my curse (the yearning)
<br />This is my curse
<br /><br />There is love burning to find you
<br />Will you wait for me?
<br />Will you be here?
<br /><br />Your silence haunts me
<br />But I still hunger for you
<br /><br />This is my curse (the wanting)
<br />This is my curse (time)
<br />This is my curse (the needing)
<br />This is my curse
<br /><br />There is love burning to find you
<br />Will you wait for me?
<br /><br />And still I want
<br />And still I ache
<br />But still I wait
<br />To see you again
<br /><br />Dying, inside, these walls 
<br /><br />Can I see your face in these tears?
<br />In these tears
<br />And I see your face...
<br /><br />There is love

<br />Drifting further every day
<br />Getting lost within myself
<br />Nothing matters no one else
<br />I have lost the will to live
<br />Simply nothing more to give
<br />There is nothing more for me
<br />Need the end to set me free
<br /><br />Things are not what they used to be
<br />Missing one inside of me
<br />Deathly lost, this can't be real
<br />Cannot stand this hell I feel
<br />Emptiness is filing me
<br />To the point of agony
<br />Growing darkness taking dawn
<br />I was me, but now He's gone
<br /><br />No one but me can save myself, but it's too late
<br />Now I can't think, think why I should even try
<br />Yesterday seems as though it never existed
<br />Death Greets me warm, now I will just say good-bye

<br /><br />but all i know is u r everything 2 me &amp; i dont want anymore than i have.....

<br />Like I never wanted anything
<br />I suppose I'll let this go and find a reason I'll hold on to
<br />I'm so ashamed of defeat
<br />And I'm out of reason to believe in me
<br />I'm out of trying to get by
<br /><br />I'm so afraid of the gift you give me
<br />I don't belong here and I'm not well
<br />I'm so ashamed of the lie I'm living
<br />Right on the wrong side of it all
<br /><br />I can't face myself when I wake up
<br />And look inside a mirror
<br />I'm so ashamed of that thing
<br />I suppose I'll let it go
<br />Untill I have something more to say for me
<br />I'm so afraid of defeat
<br />And I'm out of reason to believe in me
<br />I'm out of trying to defy

<br />One at a time
<br />Ready to play
<br />(I can't see them anyway)
<br />No time to lose
<br />We've got to move
<br />Steady your hand
<br />(I am losing sight again)
<br /><br />Fire your guns
<br />It's time to run
<br />Blow me away
<br />(I will stay, in the mess I made)
<br />After the fall
<br />We'll shake it off
<br />Show me the way
<br /><br />Only the strongest will survive
<br />Lead me to heaven, when we die
<br />I am the shadow on the wall
<br />I'll be the one to save us all
<br /><br />There's nothing left
<br />So save your breath
<br />Lying in wait
<br />(Caught inside this tidal wave)
<br />Your cover's blown
<br />No where to go
<br />Holding your fate
<br />(Loaded I will walk alone)
<br /><br />Fire your guns
<br />It's time to run
<br />Blow me away
<br />(I will stay, in the mess I made)
<br />After the fall
<br />We'll shake it off

<br />That I've come to believe my soul's on the other side.
<br />All the little pieces falling, shatter.
<br />Shards of me,
<br />Too sharp to put back together.
<br />Too small to matter,
<br />But big enough to cut me into so many little pieces.
<br />If I try to touch her,
<br />And I bleed,
<br />I bleed,
<br />And I breathe,
<br />I breathe no more. 
<br /><br />Take a breath and I try to draw from my spirits well.
<br />Yet again you refuse to drink like a stubborn child.
<br />Lie to me,
<br />Convince me that I've been sick forever.
<br />And all of this,
<br />Will make sense when I get better.
<br />But I know the difference,
<br />Between myself and my reflection.
<br />I just can't help but to wonder,
<br />Which of us do you love.
<br />So I bleed,
<br />I bleed,
<br />And I breathe,
<br />I breathe no...
<br />Bleed,
<br />I bleed,
<br />And I breathe,
<br />I breathe,
<br />I breathe-
<br />I breathe no more.

<br /><br />Is it over yet, in my head?
<br /><br />I know nothing of your kind, and I won't reveal your evil mind.

<br /><br />So sacrifice yourself, and let me have what's left.

<br />I stand at the crossroad
<br />Where the weight of my burden
<br />Eclipses my resolve
<br />This broken path I've chosen

<br />Though I feel forgotten
<br />You've carved my name in stone
<br /><br />In these desperate times

<br /><br />This is daily crucifixion
<br />And these rusted nails leave scars
<br />My jagged crown is on my side
<br />Because it never fell
<br /><br />In these desperate times

<br />When all else fails
<br />Remember me
<br /><br />Theres no question
<br />You're the answer

<br />I think we lost today
<br />There's no morning after
<br />And no one's around to blame

<br />We'll start among hypocrites
<br />The melody of our time
<br /><br />So say goodbye to the world
<br />We are the dead can't walk the earth
<br />Scream your lungs out
<br />Wait for laughter
<br />You don't have to wait forever
<br />It's the next disaster!
<br /><br />What decides when you've lost the war
<br />When the first man falls?
<br />Or when they erase it all?
<br /><br />We're too numb to feel
<br />The downfall starts here
<br />Hold your breath and swim
<br />Swallowed my life's tear
<br /><br />In times of make believe
<br />No one really seems to care
<br />Maybe I should care less
<br />'Cause I will die too
<br /><br />What will it take for us to realize
<br />The more we provoke
<br />Winter will come twice
<br /><br />Save all your prayers
<br />I think we lost today
<br />There's no morning after
<br />And no one's around to blame
<br /><br />Scream you lungs out
<br />Wait for laughter
<br />You don't have to wait for ever
<br />Here's the next disaster!
