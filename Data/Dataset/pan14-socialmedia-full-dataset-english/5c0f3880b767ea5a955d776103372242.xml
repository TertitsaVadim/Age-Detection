Many stores would get given Smith another selection. It's called rolling above, extending the original loan by paying down only the fees and interest.<br /><br />National Money Mart, with nearly 300 stores, prides itself as an industry leader in best business practices, and does not allow rollovers. It even allows customers to flee fees and pay just the 59 % interest on their financial loans, if repaid on the deadline. But at Money Mart, the due date is always the day before payday.<br /><br />&quot;Of course, anybody who had the cash in their pocket before payday probably would not have borrowed money with these terms anyway, &quot; tells Fox, of the Customer Federation of America. &quot;That really sounds like another among the list of debt traps. &quot;<br /><br />The Star sought job interviews with key figures at a number of big payday lenders, including Money Mart, Unicash, Cease `N' Cash, Cash Money along with the Cash Store. Citing the lawsuits, none was ready to sit down for an interview.<br /><br />Money Mart, in a statement, said it is &quot;disappointed&quot; with the class-action proposal, and intends to &quot;vigorously defend&quot; it's interests.<br /><br />Tim Voisin, a Kitchener man in back of Stop `N' Cash â?? a chain of 60-plus stores â?? didn't answer Star requests for interviews. The company's lawyer, Steven Sofer, tells his client, like many other lenders facing lawsuits, believes it's a model that is actually legitimate.<br /><br />&quot;Each one of them has a business product which it believes does not violate the Criminal Code, and court will ultimately decide whether they're right or wrong, &quot; tells Sofer.<br /><br />He points out that not just one payday lender has been charged criminally. &quot;I think what that suggests is that everybody recognizes that none these companies are loan sharks. &quot;<br /><br />Bob Whitelaw is performing the talking for the industry. He is the CEO and president of fresh formed Canadian Association of Community Financial Services. Whitelaw was lured away from his previous job as CEO in the Canadian Council of Better Business Bureaus to head in the newly formed payday connection.<br /><br />His old job included outing scams. With some sort of background in ethics, his new job is chief spokesperson and lobbyist for any payday lending industry, which often he admits is ageing, fragmented and suffering from an &quot;image&quot; problem.<br /><br />Whitelaw defends this company as a service most people need, and are applying.<br /><br />&quot;We're accessible, we're safe. You can walk in, the staff treat people well, and protect your privacy. But we're there to undertake one thing â?? help you to get that money, and fast.<br /><br />&quot;It is short phrase, and it has a definite end. It forces them to pay it back. It is not a personal line of credit. And they don't work with it daily, by and large, &quot; Whitelaw says. Lately, he's set his sights in the Criminal Code provision that sets out associated with interest limits.<br /><br />Smith's suit is considered one of at least eight recommended class actions in Nova scotia alleging that payday lending companies charge criminal interest rates.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5rYW5ldmEuY29tL2Jsb2cvMjc4MzcwLmJsb2c_" target="_blank">Title Loans Toronto</a>

The transaction was the same there â?? pay off, loan again, drive to another lender.<br /><br />Three hours and three to four loans later, the paycheque has been gone.
