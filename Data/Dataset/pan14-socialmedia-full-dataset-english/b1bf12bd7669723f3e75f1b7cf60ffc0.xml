<br /><br />So many people today don't know what to believe; they don't know where they're from, who they are or where they're going.--They're in absolute CONFUSION!--Because they've lost touch with the only concrete frame of reference, and that's GOD and His explanation of life, the BIBLE! They've lost faith in God, so therefore they lose faith in Love, and therefore they lose faith in Life, in people, in EVERYTHING!
<br /><br />But WE (those who have accepted Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior) have found Love that lasts forever and a God that cannot fail!--For we &quot;know Him, Whom to know is Life Eternal&quot;! (Jn.17:3) We're born again and we now have an utterly different outlook on life and a new way of looking at the World, thank God!
<br /><br />And besides the wonderful happiness, life and love that living for Jesus gives us, we've also been given a real PURPOSE in living and Someone to live FOR! We now LIKE to face life, and find a thrill in our new-found tasks and the greatest of pleasure in the fellowship of our new-found family and the greatest of satisfaction in our new-found faith. Thank You Jesus!&quot;
<br /><br />Ah, Sweet mystery of life; At last I've found thee, Now at last I know the MEANING of it all!&quot;--It's JESUS

<br /><br />You should no more try to find your own way through life than you should try to take a long trip without a map.
<br /><br />While travelling along a road, you can only see what's around you moment by moment. But if you'll look at the MAP and have faith in it, you can also see where the road CAME from, regardless of where you started out yourself. And even if you've never been to your final destination or travelled that road before, you can know where the road is GOING, where it's supposed to end. But if you don't take time to study the map you could waste an awful lot of time or maybe even ruin your chances of getting to your destination at all!
<br /><br />Just as you must look at the map, believe it's true and follow it to get where you're going, if you will take God's Word, believe that it is for you, read it and follow it, you'll come out at HEAVEN!--Absolutely! Without fail!
<br /><br />Just follow the Map Book and you'll know where you're going. God can see it all! And He not only knows where you are right now, and where you came from, your past, but He knows where you're going!--Do YOU?--You CAN!

<br /><br />...believing, trusting, helping, sharing, encouraging, confiding, understanding, caring, feeling, touching, giving, praying. Love is communication. Love is an emotion. Love is passionate, alive, vibrant and warm! Love is something that gets better all the time!
<br /><br />Love is the greatest need of man, so Love is the greatest service to man. Love is spiritual, but is manifested in the physical. Love is seen as it is put into action. Love is thoughtfulness. Love is always!--It knows no hours nor days! Love is always finding a way. Love is giving all. Love is rare--the unselfish kind. Love is priceless. Love is its own reward.
<br /><br />Love is not hurting anybody. Love is choosing to suffer and hurt yourself so that you can help someone else. Love is courage. Love is total sacrifice! Love is never lost. It always has its effect sooner or later. Love is forever.
<br /><br />Love is saying you're sorry. Love is quick to forgive. Love is humbling. The truly loving are truly humble. Love is the Name of God. Love is the power of God! Love IS God!--God IS Love! God's ultimate love is...JESUS! (1John 4:8,9)

<br /><br />No one can ever fully understand God. It's impossible, because He says, &quot;My ways are above your ways. For as the heavens are higher than the Earth, so are My ways higher than your ways, and My thoughts than your thoughts.&quot; (Isa.55:9) So forget trying to explain God! Quit trying to understand Him! Stop trying to diagnose Him and take Him apart and analyse Him! Just accept Him and His Word by faith!
<br /><br />Jesus tried to make it simple, He said, &quot;Except you become as a little CHILD, you cannot enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.&quot; (Mat.18:3) A baby is such a good illustration! A little child understands God better than most adults. Even before he learns to talk, he understands love, the simplest, yet most profound thing in the World! But what little baby understands his mother or father or how he was born or all about life? He just feels their love and accepts it and receives it!
<br /><br />It's all so simple that many people just can't believe it! The Love of God, like the love of any father, is that simple! It's just a matter of faith. It's impossible to fully understand God and His Love. But it is possible to RECEIVE Him and to love Him in return!

<br /><br />Healing has always been one of our most desperate physical needs. Jesus healed all that came unto Him, anybody and everybody, saved and unsaved, as long as they had enough faith to believe in Him for their healing. Their most immediate need was a touch to their bodies, even before they could understand Salvation, and He often healed their bodies first of all!
<br /><br />The day of miracles is not past! God is STILL in the business of transforming bodies that need it. He's still the Great Physician! He still says, &quot;I am the Lord that healeth thee, Who healeth all thy diseases and forgiveth all thy iniquities.&quot; (Exo.15:26; Psa.103:3)--Not just some or a few or many or most, but ALL of them! God can heal ANYTHING!
<br /><br />He's your Heavenly Father, He loves you and He answers prayer! In fact, He's more willing to give than you are to receive! God cannot only do it, but He WANTS to do it! All He asks is that you honour Him with faith, by believing His Word and His promises. It's just that simple! (1Jn.5:14,15; Heb.11:6)
<br /><br />Do you have faith in God and His Love?--Have you personally met the Great Physician? If not, receive Him and His healing power into your life now!

<br /><br />Perhaps you're like a lot of people who say they don't believe in God, but aren't really atheists. Maybe you simply haven't made a final decision because you haven't had a real chance to know the Truth! But even if you have doubts or questions on your mind or heart that need answering in order for you to be convinced, if you're SINCERE and really want the answers, if you really want to know God, He will show you!
<br /><br />Even if you don't believe in God or the Bible or anything else, you can put God in a test tube and PROVE He exists!--And YOU are the tube! You just need to put God in YOU and see what HAPPENS! If you'll just sincerely pray, &quot;God, if there is a God out there somewhere, SHOW me! REVEAL Yourself!&quot;--And He WILL! Once you admit the possibility, then you're giving God a chance and there's a tiny spark of faith, a little mustard seed of faith has begun to grow! And God will honour that faith by letting you see and feel and know the proof!
<br /><br />God loves faith! He loves us because we believe Him!--And once you believe, then He will prove Himself in many ways so that you will no longer have to believe purely by faith. He will prove Himself to you by answers to prayers and miracles, even by the change in your own life!

<br /><br />We CANNOT save ourselves by our own works, our own goodness, even our own attempts to keep His laws and to love Him. We cannot be good or perfect enough, to earn, merit or deserve the Heavenly perfection of His Own Holy Salvation by His Own grace, Love and mercy! It is impossible for anyone to be saved without the miraculous power of God!
<br /><br />Accepting Salvation is a work of God's GRACE. It's free; it can only be received. It's the gift of God, you can't work for it.--You can't EARN a GIFT or else it wouldn't BE a gift! God's Word says, &quot;By GRACE are ye saved through faith--and that NOT of yourselves!--It is the GIFT of God.--NOT of WORKS, lest any man should boast!&quot;--(Eph.2:8,9)
<br /><br />God's idea of goodness, of TRUE righteousness, is a sinner who knows he needs GOD, and depends on HIM for Salvation. God's idea of saintliness is not self-righteousness and sinless perfection. It's a sinner saved by grace, a sinner who has no perfection, no righteousness of his own, but is totally dependent on the grace and the Love and the mercy of God by faith! Those are the only saints there are--there are no others! You haven't got anybody's righteousness except Christ's, and He's the only One that can give it to you! (Phi.3:9)

<br /><br />If you really haven't got enough sense to believe in God, then you can just look at His Creation and know that there is a God! Just logically and reasonably, anybody in their right mind should know there's a God! Anybody who really believes that it all happened by accident is a fool! It's ridiculous! All you have to do is sit outside and look at the trees and the birds, and you'll know that it wasn't an accident.--Too much planning went into it all. God's entire glorious Creation is a constant testimony of the existence of a Divine Designer and Creator.
<br /><br />Although the whole Creation testifies of the existence of the invisible God, many people today refuse to receive the testimony, because they choose to be ignorant!--Thus they've cooked up the ridiculous, idiotic scheme of evolution!--To try to get rid of God and the knowledge of God, &quot;as they did not like to retain God in their education&quot;. (Rom.1:28)--They don't want to confess that He exists.
<br /><br />But we marvel at the work of God's hands, and we see Him in His handiwork, and, as His Word says, we understand Him by the things that are made, so that we know God, and glorify Him as God, and are thankful! (Romans 1:20)

<br /><br />Beloved, the time is growing shorter. The days are becoming more evil and things are moving faster as time goes on. (Eph.5:16; 2Tim.3:1) From all we can gather from God's Word, we certainly can't expect to go on much longer in this World as it now is! In fact, it looks like it's all going to wind up within the next few years, and if we look into Bible Prophecy, all the signs are pointing to The End! (Mat.24)
<br /><br />So to say the least, we're living in exciting times and there are going to be some big changes made!--And the quicker things get worse, the quicker it'll all be over! The quicker the World's paper money economy crashes, the quicker will rise the One World government of the Antichrist, which means the quicker will come the Great Tribulation and the glorious Second Coming of the Lord and Heaven on Earth!
<br /><br />So it behooves us to work as though everything depended on work and pray as though everything depended on prayer. It's almost over! This is almost The END! &quot;Even so, COME QUICKLY, Lord Jesus!&quot; (Rev.22:20) Amen?

<br /><br />One of these days very soon, the King of kings is going to come back to claim His Kingdom! &quot;And He shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many people: And they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks.&quot; (Isa.2:4) There will be complete disarmament at last!--The World's first real genuine and lasting disarmament, beating their weapons into instruments of peace!
<br /><br />At last there will be peace on Earth which shall never end under the reign of Jesus Christ, the Son of God and Prince of Peace Himself! Today's wicked and vengeful men of war will be stopped at last! There'll be no more big powers and oppressed poor! No more corruption, vice, crime or crooked politicians! He's going to stop all their war business, He's going to break the arrows and the swords and the bows (Psa.46:9), and all those planes and tanks and missiles are going to be burned up! Thank God!
<br /><br />Then and only then, under the supreme and powerful rule and reign of the God of Peace and the Prince of Peace and the men of Peace, will all wars finally cease and the World at last be governed fairly and well with true justice, liberty, peace, plenty and happiness for all! Hallelujah!--What a Day that will be!

<br /><br />Jesus is the picture of patience, calmness, love, gentleness and long-suffering--the picture of tenderness, gently wooing like a dove. He goes where there are open and receptive hearts that are hungry. He seeks out the low and the humble and the contrite heart, but resisteth the proud. (Lk.1:53; 1Pet.5:5<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cool.gif" alt=":)" /> He waits lovingly and meekly at your heart's door, not forcing Himself upon you, not pushing the door open, but waiting for you to simply open your heart, and invite Him to come in.
<br /><br />Jesus promised, &quot;Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If any man hear My voice and open the door, I WILL come into him.&quot; (Rev.3:20) When you open your door to Jesus, He always comes in! He likes to fill every place that's made for Him! If you will just open your heart, His Spirit of Love will flow in!
<br /><br />You can have Jesus and all He has to give, which is everything, right this minute if you'll just pray and ask Him to come into your heart with His Love, life, liberty, truth, peace, plenty and happiness here, now and forever! Simply pray: &quot;Jesus, come into my heart! I believe You are the Son of God. Please forgive me for my sins and help me to love You and to love others and to tell them about You, in Jesus' name. Amen.&quot;
