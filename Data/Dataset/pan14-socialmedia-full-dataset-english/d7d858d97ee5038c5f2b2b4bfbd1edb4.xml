<br />A young child may latch onto a favorite stuffed animal or an old blanket and carry it with them wherever they go. When the child is lonely, scared or tired, this &quot;security blanket&quot; is comforting. Eventually, the child learns to let go of the item and becomes aware of his or her ability to cope with these unsettling feelings. 
<br /><br />As an adult, I may revert to fear, anxiety or doubt when I am faced with a life challenge. The security of old thought patterns may be more comforting to me than taking a different path. However, as I learn to let go and let God, I find that God has instilled in me all that I need to face life with confidence and composure. 
<br /><br />Today I put away my security blanket. I let go, and I let God. And I am at peace. 
<br /><br />Do not worry about anything.--Philippians 4:6

<br />An acorn holds within it the promise of a vibrant oak tree but no potential for an apple tree. The kind of faith seed I plant determines what will mature in my life as well. I ask myself, Where am I placing my faith? Am I focusing on those things I want to see growing in my life or focusing on my difficulties? When I want harmony and love, I put my faith in God's love. When I desire prosperity, I put my faith in the always available abundance of God's kingdom. 
<br /><br />Today I sow and nurture seeds of faith in God's goodness. I know these seeds will germinate in their own time. I nourish my faith with prayers of gratitude, knowing that a glorious garden of harmony, love and prosperity is being prepared for me. 
<br /><br />Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen.--Hebrews 11:1

<br />Today I look for blessings and find them all around me. I pause to notice the brilliant sunshine or, perhaps, the refreshing rain. I choose to be thankful, no matter the weather. 
<br /><br />I rejoice in the goodness of all people--those I hold near and dear and those who are a world away. I behold their divinity and pray they feel the joy of knowing God's love. 
<br /><br />Blessings come in many forms. Some are welcomed and easy to distinguish, while others are recognized only through the lens of steadfast faith and overcoming. Throughout this day, I remember to rejoice and give thanks for blessings great and small so that I may realize the sublime joy in each moment of communion with God. 
<br /><br />Let your faithful rejoice in your goodness.--2 Chronicles 6:41

<br /><br />When God leads you to the edge of the cliff, trust Him fully and let go, only 1 of 2 things will happen, either He'll catch you when you fall, or He'll teach you how to fly! All who have been suffering from abuse, the lack of in their lives, persecution, all the negativities of life which the enemy has bring unto you; TODAY! God is going to shift things around for you today and let things work in your favor. 
<br /><br />All Jehovah God ask of you is to believe through Jesus Christ. Do you believe that God closes doors no man can open and God opens doors no man can close. If you need God to open, some doors for you....just open your mouth and give Jehovah God the praises that he deserves. 
<br /><br />Have a blessed day and remember to be a blessing...

<br />If in the course of my day I accumulate resentments, it is like picking up rocks and putting them in my pocket. If I collect the rocks and hold on to them day after day, month after month, I feel the burden grow. When I refuse to let resentments go, I am weighed down by the hurt and anger I carry. 
<br /><br />Forgiveness means looking beyond behaviors. Without condoning hurtful actions, I accept that each of us is doing the best we can in that moment. The truth is that we are all children of God and nothing can diminish or change that. As I release the belief that I can lose my good or lose my power, I let go of the negativity weighing me down and I forgive. Freed of resentment, I am ready to love others, to laugh and to live joyfully. 
<br /><br />Whenever you stand praying, forgive, if you have anything against anyone.--Mark 11:25

<br />When the bird waketh, and the shadows flee;

<br />Sweet the repose beneath Thy wings o'ershading,
<br />But sweeter still to wake and find Thee there!
<br /><br />So shall it be at last, in that bright morning
<br />When the soul waketh, and life's shadows flee.

<br />Shall rise the glorious thought, I am with Thee!

<br /><br />Often the way God works in a person's life is through other people. If there's anything in my life that is praiseworthy, so much of it, from my perspective, relates to the people around me—my family, friends, and ministry partners. These people know and understand the power of biblical friendship.
<br /><br />I'm sure you too could report that major steps forward in your relationship with God have come through Him working through the influence of other people. If we're going to continue to go forward spiritually and be the people that God wants us to be, we need to take hold of one another in caring, supportive, biblical friendship.
<br /><br />Friendship has always been a priority relationship with God. Throughout His Word, when God has wanted to picture a relationship of intimacy and integrity, He described friendship:
<br /><br />Of David and Jonathan, 1 Samuel 18:1 says &quot;the soul of Jonathan was knit to the soul of David.&quot; James 2:23 calls Abraham, &quot;God's friend.&quot; Jesus Himself describes the highest kind of love in terms of friendship, &quot;Greater love has no one than this, that someone lays down his life for his friends&quot; (John 15:13-14). Proverbs 17:17 says, &quot;A friend loves at all times, and a brother is born for adversity.&quot;
<br /><br />In each of these contexts, godly friendship is a God-given refuge in hard times. Friendship is a bond in seasons of heartache, disappointment, and failure. A godly friend says, &quot;Times are hard? You're disappointed and discouraged? You've failed personally? I'll stand with you, man. I'm not going anywhere.&quot; Real friends come alive in those times. They move in closer.
<br /><br />Biblical friendship—lasting, loving friendship is a wonderful, very powerful thing. God created you and me to need each other. I want to be that kind of friend, don't you? God help us not just to want others to be like that for us, but help us to be that kind of a friend to the people in our lives.

For what can be known about God is plain to them, because God has shown it to them. For his invisible attributes, namely, his eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly perceived, ever since the creation of the world, in the things that have been made. So they are without excuse. Romans 1:18-20
<br /><br />Every scientist agrees that for every effect in the universe there must be a cause.
<br /><br />Like the science professor who was out walking in the forest with one of his students and noticed a little glass sphere on the ground. They picked it up to examine it more closely.
<br /><br />The professor said, &quot;I wonder where this came from . . .&quot; Looking around, they saw no one.The student said, &quot;Yeah, I wonder.&quot; Then with a twinkle in his eye he added, &quot;I wonder if it was ten times bigger, would we know where it came from then?&quot;&quot;It had to come from somewhere,&quot; the professor said, &quot;It can't just show up.&quot;And he said, &quot;Yeah, I agree with that. But what if it was like a hundred times bigger than it is?&quot;&quot;Well,&quot; he said, &quot;all the more reason to know it had to come from somewhere.&quot;The student went on, &quot;Well, what if it was like a million times bigger?&quot;The professor then jokingly said, &quot;Well, then it would have gotten here on its own.&quot;
<br /><br />How foolish! But isn't that exactly what people do? They look at our universe, so incredibly complex and vast that it makes our minds swim when we study it, and they deny God's work. The human mind cannot even comprehend the universe that God made yet some people arrogantly make this exception, &quot;Well, this is the one time that there was an effect without a cause-the one time we got this whole thing from nothing.&quot;
<br /><br />The Bible calls that suppressing the truth in unrighteousness (Romans 1:18). Fact is, when people reject the truth that the immense effect had to be caused by something, they are resisting it only because they don't want it to be true. They reason that if there's a God, they're going to have to be accountable to Him. So they choose not to believe any of it.
<br /><br />Psalm 19:1 says, &quot;The heavens are declaring the glory of God.&quot; Creation itself is shouting &quot;There's a God! There's a God!&quot; Some choose to listen while others refuse in spite of the obvious evidence. When people deny a Creator, Psalm 14:1 says, &quot;The fool has said in his heart there is no God.&quot; Some people stand off at a distance with phony intellectualism and say, &quot;Well, I don't see the proof for God.&quot; Then please go out on a starlit night and look up at the skies. Now what's your answer? The heavens itself testify to God's glory.
<br /><br />How did the universe get here? The scientific world has speculations, not meaningful explanations. I'm going to go with there's a God and He spoke it into existence like Genesis 1 tells us. I don't understand Him or how He made it all but you don't have to be a genius to know that you can't throw a stick of dynamite into a printing factory and get the Declaration of Independence. An effect testifies to a cause. A design shouts a designer. I'm convinced by these arguments and choose to believe in a sovereign Creator God.

<br /><br />There are some who have gone through so much that their prayers aren’t as eloquent as they used to be. There is no concern for subject verb agreement. The poetic prowess no longer captivates the listener as it once did. All that has happened has zapped the strength, the desire, the motivation. After all of this, it’s all that one can do to cry out the name of Jesus.
<br /><br />We’re supposed to be growing with each test, trial and/or tribulation that comes our way. God would desire that we “grow” through life and not just “go through life.” There are far too many Christians who are simply going through life and not growing through life. The situation is the same. The challenge is the same.
<br /><br />You’re still worried about the same things with the same people. There has been no growth; there has been no change; and this stage of weakness is not the stage of weakness that God can work with and work through.
<br /><br />We claim we’re children of God. We claim the anointing of God. We claim to operate with the power of the Holy Spirit. Then why, pray tell, is there no growth? Why are you still in the same state of weakness wherein you’re not able to lift any more weight today than you could when you started this faith walk?
<br /><br />In our text, the Apostle Paul asked Jesus three times to take away the thorn in his flesh. Jesus simply replied, My grace is sufficient for thee. In other words, you are where you are, it is what it is, now allow yourself to be broken to the point where it’s all about God and not about you. It’s not by your power nor might, but by the spirit of God.God knows us. We are fearfully and wonderfully made in His image; we’re brought to life because God breathed the breath of life and man became a living soul. God desires that we not live in a weakened state but have power to tread over scorpions and serpents. Power to overcome. Power to make it through. The word of God tells us that even in our weakness, that’s when his power works best.
<br /><br />So tell yourself-- I’m not giving up. I’m struggling but I’m not giving up. I’ve slowed down, but I’m not giving up. It’s taking me a little longer these days, but I’m not giving up. The vicissitudes of life have caused my vim and my vigor to wane, but I’m not giving up.
<br /><br />The apostle Paul was a man of great intellectual means, yet now a converted man of great spiritual means. There are many of us who could learn a lesson from Paul. He finally realized that it wasn’t about his intelligent quotient; it was about his spiritual quotient. He realized that his education didn’t matter, his economic status didn’t matter, his connections didn’t matter. Nothing mattered but his relationship with Jesus Christ.
<br /><br />In his moment of weakness Paul called on Jesus, who reminded Paul he must go through and must grow through. The message is the same for us today. Today, it’s an issue for you, but tomorrow new mercies you shall see. Today, in your weakness, you just want the pain to stop, but through that pain you’re growing. Today, in your weakness, you just want the problem solved, but through the problem you’re growing. Today, you just want peace, but through the turmoil you’re growing to understand that peace doesn’t mean the absence of conflict. Today, you just want the season of lack to end, but through the season of lack you’re growing to understand that the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want.
<br /><br />There’s a whole lot of stuff to make you weak in the physical, but there’s a whole lot more to make you strong in the spiritual. So my brother, my sister, remember God’s grace is sufficient. There is power in your weakness.
<br /><br />Scripture Of The Day: &quot;Three different times I begged the Lord to take it away. Each time He said, My gracious favor is all you need. My power works best in your weakness!&quot; - II Corinthians 12:8-9

<br /><br />Have you ever committed a BIG, terrible sin and felt so condemned and horrible as a result? I know I have. When we get like this, it seems to take days and even weeks for the painful stench to subside. It is almost as if we are shunned by God until sufficient time has passed for Him to not be totally disgusted with us. But is that really the way God deals with His children? NO!
<br /><br />THE TRUTH
<br /><br />The Lord is not our &quot;condemner,&quot; He is our Savior and Friend. He is &quot;good and ready to forgive.&quot; He has a heart of love for us, EVEN when we sin HUGE sins that bring terrible devastation. Remember the prodigal had &quot;dissed&quot; his father something fierce. He had wasted his father's money on parties and prostitutes. He ended up in the pig sty of life, needy, broken, sin-stained, and alone. He was filthy inside and out. Yet when he repented and returned to his father, he found his father to be &quot;good and ready to forgive, and abundant in lovingkindness.&quot; What a beautiful picture of the mercy and grace of God that is available to us when we repent!
<br /><br />WHAT TO DO
<br /><br />Let me encourage you, no matter what terrible sins you have committed, to take those sins to Jesus in humility, brokenness, and true repentance. Believe His Word. He will receive you, and lavish on you complete and total forgiveness and restoration. The consequences of your sin don't magically disappear as a result, but your heart is immediately made right with God. And that is the most important thing.
<br /><br />TWO MOUNTAINS
<br /><br />If you have BIG sins from your past that continually haunt you and bring you down, if you are struggling with guilt, shame and condemnation, go to the right place with those sins. Go to Mount Calvary.
<br /><br />You see, there are two great mountains in Scripture: Sinai in the Old Testament and Calvary in the New. Sinai is the mountain where Moses received the 10 Commandments. It is the mountain of Law. The Law was given to show us we are guilty before God. It was given to lead us to Christ and His grace. When you sin as a Christian, do not take your sin to Sinai. At Sinai, you will only find condemnation as the Law cries out, &quot;SINNER!&quot; Take your sin to Calvary, the mountain on which Christ died. At Calvary, you will find mercy, grace, and the blood of Jesus that washes white as snow.

<br /><br />And He said to them, “Because of the littleness of your faith; for truly I say to you, if you have faith as a &quot;mustard seed, you shall say to this mountain, ‘Move from here to there,’ and it shall move; and nothing shall be impossible to you.” Matthew 17:20
<br /><br />When I was in seventh grade, Physical Education class was mandatory. I loved sports and considered myself athletic, so P. E. was something I really enjoyed. One day, however, it was not so enjoyable. My class and I were taken outside to run the newly constructed  obstacle course, complete with monkey bars, a rope climb, a tire run, a stomach crawl, and the dreaded eight-foot wall. Getting over the wall was the very first obstacle. It ate my lunch. My time was pitiful because I had such trouble with the wall. Have you ever felt like there was a wall in your way, a mountain in your way? Have you prayed about that obstacle, but nothing changed? That is exactly what the disciples faced when they tried to cast out a demon and could not do it. Jesus told them the problem was the littleness of their faith.
<br /><br />FAITH MOVES MOUNTAINS
<br /><br />What mountain are you facing today? What major miracle do you need God to perform in your life? Is your need in the area of marriage, or finances, or spiritual breakthroughs, or relationships, or physical/emotional healing? Jesus said, “Be it done to you according to your faith” (Matthew 9:29). Faith is the key to moving mountains. What if you did something really crazy today? What if you got your heart so right with the Lord and took Him at His Word? What if you spoke to that mountain of an obstacle before you and said, “Mountain of ______________, on the authority of Jesus’ promise to me, I say to you, ‘GET OUTTA MY WAY!’” He told us to speak to this mountain. He told us if we have just a mustard seed of faith and pray according to His will (see 1 John 5:14-15), He will do what we ask Him to do. He responds to prayers offered in faith without any doubting.
<br /><br />MY MOUNTAIN
<br /><br />I am ashamed to admit this, but I have been so faithless with regard to the finances of From His Heart Ministries. I have looked at the dicey economy and our ministry’s growing financial deficit and have been drowning in a sea of doubt and discouragement. I sensed the Lord say to me, “Jeff, I will do for you according to your faith. If you don’t start believing Me, if you don’t start speaking to this mountain, you will not see any miracles take place.” So, by faith, I am choosing to turn the corner today. I am going to quit speaking words of doom and gloom, and start speaking words of faith and abundant provision. My Father owns the cattle on a thousand hills. It is nothing for Him to sell a few to meet the financial needs of From His Heart Ministries. And He will be faithful to do so, if I will walk by faith and not by sight. This is His work, not mine. He is the President, not me. My job as a branch is not to sweat and strain out the fruit; it is simply to abide in the vine. It is to believe Him for BIG things and live by faith. Will you join me today in speaking to your mountain, whatever that mountain may be? Will you join me in believing God? All we need for miracles to occur is a little mustard seed of faith in a great big God. Are you in?

<br /><br />When I was about six-years-old, I saw a city dump for the very first time. I was blown away by all the piles of trash, debris, and food garbage concentrated in one place. As we got out of the car to look around, my dad told me to watch out for rats. Yikes! I was glad when we left that place. It seemed depressing, even to a six-year-old.
<br /><br />WHERE ARE YOU LIVING THESE DAYS?
<br /><br />Can you imagine having to live at the city dump? Can you imagine spending the night with the garbage and the flies and the rats and the roaches? YUK! No one wants to live at the dump. But the truth is this: a good number of you reading this e-mail are living in an emotional dump right now. Life has hit you between the eyes. You feel so overwhelmed, misunderstood, used, abused, and forgotten. You are filled with depression, discouragement and dread. You believe things are really terrible in your life, and you feel as if you are never going to experience better days. You have trouble seeing the bright side of anything. Every time you look out on the horizon, all you see is more trash.
<br /><br />TIME TO MOVE OUT I know a lot about the emotional dump. I have spent more time there than I would like to admit. (In fact, I was just there for a good part of Wednesday morning!) When I get down, sing the blues and have a pity party, the Lord always reminds me of my problem. You see, dump dwellers tend to look out – and just see more trash, more depressing circumstances. What they need to do is LOOK UP and get their eyes on the Lord! The psalmist in Psalm 42 had a strong talk with his depressed soul. He grabbed his soul by the scruff of the neck and said, “Listen here, soul. I am not going to keep despairing. I am not going to keep looking out. I am going to start looking up and put my hope in God!” God is the One who can calm the raging storm. God is the One who can turn things around with a word. God is the One who can make a way where there seems to be no way. God is the One who can heal the sick, raise the dead, and make an immediate difference no matter how bleak the circumstances. Put your hope in Him, and praise Him for His presence in your life! Moving today can be today for you if you will get your eyes off your problems and onto the problem-solver. The song says it best, “Turn your eyes upon Jesus. Look full in His wonderful face. And the things of earth will grow strangely dim, in the light of His glory and grace.”

There is nothing magical about the process. The Bible is not a book of spells. It is simply a matter of meditating on the Word of God until it becomes so rooted in your heart that it becomes more real to you than your present circumstances. When a person reaches this point, his or her faith is ready to be activated by words.
<br /><br />Establishing your heart in the Word of God is essential if you want to see the physical manifestation of God's promises. Because Scripture is infallible, whatever God says must come to pass. God's Word is full of faith. The way a believer begins to establish his or her faith is to hear the Word of God preached (Romans 10:17) in addition to reading, studying, meditating on and speaking it. If you make this your lifestyle, you will be walking by faith and experience the promises of God come to pass in your life.
<br /><br />Your heart is your epicenter of faith in God's Word. Many people mistakenly make confessions when their heart is not grounded on the Word of God. They are actually only mentally assenting to the words they speak. They don't really believe the words they are saying; they are only hoping that what they say will come to pass. Consequently, they get frustrated when they don't see the manifestation of what they are speaking.
<br /><br />Romans 10:10 says, &quot;For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.&quot; You must believe in the integrity of the Word before you speak it. Otherwise, your confessions are in vain. Second Corinthians 4:13 says, &quot;We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak.&quot; Joshua 1:8 stresses the importance of meditating on the Word day and night. In doing so, we make our way prosperous.
<br /><br />Jesus is our ultimate example of operating the principle of faith. He knew that whatever He spoke would come to pass. Why? Because He had meditated on the Word to such a point that it regulated His life (Psalm 119:97-104). When He cursed the fig tree in Mark 11:12-24, the results came immediately. What He had spoken had no choice but to come to pass because they overflowed with the faith of God. The same results can be yours when you don't doubt in your heart (Matthew 21:21). Jesus said that whosoever shall say, or speak, to something in faith will see it changed.
<br /><br />Settle the Issue
<br /><br />Walking by faith, or walking by the Word of God, must become a settled issue in your life before you can experience God's abundance. For you to experience divine health and healing, financial prosperity, deliverance and the numerous other benefits of God's covenant, it will depend on whether you choose to accept the world's opinions and reports over the integrity of God's Word. I don't know about you, but I'm not going to put my trust in a system that is falling apart and is unreliable. If you put the principles of the Word to work while pursuing a life of love and holiness, you can prove God for yourself. Give His Word a chance and watch Him come through for you every single time.
<br /><br />Scripture Of The Day: &quot;For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.&quot; - Romans 10:10 (KJV)

By this I mean positive in line with God's plan and purpose. I am not talking about the power of positive thinking just as some kind of esoteric regimen. That is good, but it is not good enough for us to achieve what God would have us to achieve.
<br /><br />This is the point I want to make. Thinking positively is always better than thinking negatively, and it will put you in a better frame of mind to accept what is going on around you. However, it will not change your circumstance. On the other hand, the power of positive confession, in line with God's Word, will change your circumstances in a positive way.
<br /><br />Jesus said, in Mark 11:23: &quot;For assuredly, I say to you, whoever says to this mountain, 'Be removed and be cast into the sea,' and does not doubt in his heart, but believes that those things he says will be done, he will have whatever he says. That means you will have the negative as well as the positive. If you do not want the negative, you had better stop saying the negative.
<br /><br />Why not say something that will help reinforce in me positive ideas so that I develop it into a habit? When I get to a situation in life, I do not have to say, &quot;What shall I say now?&quot; I don't want to say &quot;Take care.&quot; I don't want to say &quot;She makes me sick.&quot; When I develop a habit of speaking positively, I will not have to say that, because it will become as easy as breathing, an automatic reflex action. According to Mark 11:23, the will of God is for us to say it with our mouth and believe it in our heart.
<br /><br />I want to show you a mathematical equation so that you will understand how important the things I have stated are. If the number of times a thing is repeated is any indication of its importance, then we need to be very careful that we learn the lessons that the Spirit of God is showing us in the Word of God. As we read Mark 11:23 again, I will point out this mathematical equation:
<br /><br />&quot;For assuredly, I say to you, whoever (1) says to this mountain, 'Be removed and be cast into the sea,' and does not doubt in his heart, but (1) believes that those things he (2) says will be done, he will have whatever he (3) says.
<br /><br />Notice the ratio, 3 to 1. Jesus only mentions &quot;believing&quot; one time, but He mentions &quot;says&quot; three times. I wonder is the Man trying to tell us something. Yes! He knew that Christians would not have a problem with the believing part because they will believe anything, even a lie.
<br /><br />People do not have a problem with believing. However, where they fall short is &quot;saying.&quot; &quot;Honey, you ain't gonna get me to say that! I ain't gonna say that I got something I can't see. You ain't gonna make a fool out of me!&quot;
<br /><br />Jesus knew that people would not have a problem believing. Their problem would be confessing or saying. Inhibitions, self-centeredness, not wanting to look different to other people are problems for most people. Now, we will dress like a fool and look different, but for some reason, that does not bother us. However, when it comes to saying something that lines up with the Word of God that is a problem. When it comes to the things of God, most people suddenly have this great spirit of sincerity rising up in them. This great &quot;honesty&quot; spirit comes on them, and this great desire to be perfectly circumspect. Yet, oftentimes they say they have things that they do not have and never think anything about it.
<br /><br />Here's an example:
<br /><br />&quot;Say man, I haven't seen you in a long time. When are you going to give me my five dollars you told me you were going to give me three weeks ago?&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;See me Friday I'll have some money then.&quot;
<br /><br />You are telling a lie. Friday has not come yet. The company you work for may go bankrupt and if it does you will not have any money on Friday. However, you are already confessing the future, and you have no problem with that.
<br /><br />&quot;Meet me right here outside the gate, and I will have my paycheck on Friday.&quot;We do not have a problem with that because we believe the word of men. The man told you he was going to pay you on Friday. The man always says and does what he says he is going to do; but God, you cannot count on God. If God says it will come to pass, it may not. We have great confidence in the words of men and based on their word, we will go out telling it all over town.
<br /><br />The power of positive confession works. If you believe that it will come to pass, you have to say it. We receive what we say if we believe it in our heart. This is the Word of God! 
<br /><br />Scripture Of the Day: &quot;I tell you the truth, if anyone says to this mountain, 'Go, throw yourself into the sea,' and does not doubt in his heart but believes that what he says will happen, it will be done for him.&quot; - Mark 11:23

He was certainly one of the most influential people who ever lived.&quot; (The World Book Encyclopedia) Who is &quot;He&quot;? Jesus Christ, the founder of Christianity.
<br />In spite of what the encyclopedia says, however, to hundreds of millions of people in the Orient and elsewhere, Jesus Christ is a stranger, just a name they may remember from high-school textbooks. Even in the churches of Christendom, there are theologians and clergymen who say that we really do not know Jesus and cast doubt on the genuineness of the four extant accounts of his life (the Gospels) found in the Bible.
<br />Could the Gospel writers have forged the life story of Jesus? Not at all! The well-known historian Will Durant, after analyzing those Gospel accounts, wrote: &quot;That a few simple men should in one generation have invented so powerful and appealing a personality, so lofty an ethic and so inspiring a vision of human brotherhood, would be a miracle far more incredible than any recorded in the Gospels. After two centuries of Higher Criticism the outlines of the life, character, and teaching of Christ, remain reasonably clear, and constitute the most fascinating feature in the history of Western man.&quot;
<br />Still, there are those who would dismiss Jesus Christ as unworthy of their attention because of what his professed followers have done. 'They dropped an atom bomb on Nagasaki,' some in Japan would say. 'And Nagasaki had more Christians than most cities in Japan.' But can you blame a physician for a patient's illness if the patient fails to follow the doctor's guidance? Most people claiming to be Christians have long ignored Jesus' prescription for overcoming mankind's ills. Yet, Jesus gave the remedy for our day-to-day problems as well as for the afflictions of mankind worldwide.

Very little is known about his childhood. It is well attested, however, that when he was about 30 years of age, he started his ministry to &quot;bear witness to the truth.&quot; (John 18:37; Luke 3:21-23) The four disciples who wrote accounts of his life focus on the three and a half years that followed.
<br />During his ministry, Jesus Christ gave his disciples a command that could be an antidote to many of the world's ills. What was that? Jesus said: &quot;I am giving you a new commandment, that you love one another; just as I have loved you, that you also love one another.&quot; (John 13:34) Yes, the solution to many of mankind's problems is love. When, on another occasion, Jesus was asked which commandment is the greatest, he answered: &quot;'You must love Jehovah your God with your whole heart and with your whole soul and with your whole mind.' This is the greatest and first commandment. The second, like it, is this, 'You must love your neighbor as yourself.'&quot;—Matthew 22:37-40.
<br />Jesus showed us by words and deeds how to love God and fellow humans. Let us consider a few examples and see what we can learn from him.
<br />His Teachings
<br />In one of the best-known sermons in history, Jesus Christ told his followers: &quot;No one can slave for two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will stick to the one and despise the other. You cannot slave for God and for Riches.&quot; (Matthew 6:24) Is Jesus' teaching about putting God first in our lives still practical today, when so many people believe that money solves all problems? True, we need money to get by. (Ecclesiastes 7:12) Yet, if we let &quot;Riches&quot; be our master, &quot;the love of money&quot; will control us, dominating our whole life. (1 Timothy 6:9, 10) Many who have fallen into this trap have ended up losing their family, their health, and even their lives.
<br />On the other hand, looking to God as our Master gives meaning to life. As the Creator, he is the Source of life, and thus, he alone is worthy of our worship. (Psalm 36:9; Revelation 4:11) Those who learn about his qualities and come to love him are moved to observe his commandments. (Ecclesiastes 12:13; 1 John 5:3) By doing so, we benefit ourselves.—Isaiah 48:17.
<br />In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus also taught his disciples how to show love for fellow humans. He said: &quot;All things, therefore, that you want men to do to you, you also must likewise do to them.&quot; (Matthew 7:12) The word &quot;men&quot; that Jesus used here includes even one's enemies. In the same sermon, he said: &quot;Continue to love your enemies and to pray for those persecuting you.&quot; (Matthew 5:43, 44) Would not such love solve many of the problems that we face today? Hindu leader Mohandas Gandhi thought so. He is quoted as saying: &quot;When [we] shall get together on the teachings laid down by Christ in this Sermon on the Mount, we shall have solved the problems . . . of the whole world.&quot; Jesus' teachings about love, if applied, can solve many of mankind's ills.
<br />His Deeds
<br />Not only did Jesus teach profound truths about how to show love but he also practiced what he taught. For example, he put the interests of others ahead of his own. One day Jesus and his disciples were so busy helping people that they had no time even to eat a meal. Jesus saw the need for his disciples to rest up a bit, and he took them to a lonely place. But when they got there, they found a crowd waiting for them. How would you have responded upon seeing a crowd who expected you to work when you felt that you needed a little break? Well, Jesus &quot;was moved with pity for them&quot; and &quot;started to teach them many things.&quot; (Mark 6:34) This concern for others always moved Jesus to assist them.
<br />Jesus did more for people than teach them. He also extended practical help. For example, on one occasion he fed more than 5,000 people who had been listening to him until late in the day. Soon after that, he fed another large crowd—this time more than 4,000—who had been listening to him for three days and had nothing left to eat. On the first occasion, he used five loaves of bread and two fishes, and on the latter, seven loaves and a few little fishes. (Matthew 14:14-22; 15:32-38) Miracles? Yes, he was a miracle worker.
<br />Jesus also healed many ailing ones. He cured the blind, the lame, the lepers, and the deaf. Why, he even raised the dead! (Luke 7:22; John 11:30-45) Once a leper entreated him: &quot;If you just want to, you can make me clean.&quot; How did Jesus respond? &quot;At that he was moved with pity, and he stretched out his hand and touched him, and said to him: 'I want to. Be made clean.'&quot; (Mark 1:40, 41) Through such miracles, Jesus demonstrated his love for the afflicted.
<br />Do you find it hard to believe in Jesus' miracles? Some do. Remember, though, that Jesus performed his miracles in public. Even his opposers, who tried to find fault with him on every occasion, could not deny that he was a miracle worker. (John 9:1-34) Further, his miracles had a purpose. They helped people to identify him as the One sent by God.—John 6:14.
<br />In performing miracles Jesus was not seeking attention for himself. Rather, he glorified God, the Source of his power. In Capernaum he was once in a home filled with people. A paralyzed man wanted to be healed but could not get in. So his friends lowered him on a cot through the roof. Upon seeing their faith, Jesus healed the paralytic. As a result, the people &quot;glorified God&quot; and said: &quot;We never saw the like of it.&quot; (Mark 2:1-4, 11, 12) Jesus' miracles brought praise to Jehovah, his God, and helped those in need.
<br />Miraculous healing of the sick, however, was not the main thrust of Jesus' ministry. One who wrote an account of Jesus' life explained: &quot;These have been written down that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ the Son of God, and that, because of believing, you may have life by means of his name.&quot; (John 20:31) Yes, Jesus came to earth so that believing humans might have life.
<br />His Sacrifice
<br />'Jesus came to earth?' you may ask. 'Where did he come from?' Jesus himself said: &quot;I have come down from heaven to do, not my will, but the will of him that sent me.&quot; (John 6:38) He had a prehuman existence as the only-begotten Son of God. What then was the will of the One who sent him to earth? &quot;God loved the world so much that he gave his only-begotten Son,&quot; says John, one of the Gospel writers, &quot;in order that everyone exercising faith in him might not be destroyed but have everlasting life.&quot; (John 3:16) How was this possible?
<br />The Bible reveals how death became the unavoidable lot for mankind. The first human couple received from God life with the prospect of living forever. However, they chose to rebel against their Maker. (Genesis 3:1-19) As a result of this action, the first human sin, the offspring of Adam and Eve inherited the unwelcome legacy of death. (Romans 5:12) In order to give mankind real life, sin and death must be done away with.
<br />No scientist can get rid of death by some kind of genetic engineering. Yet, the Creator of mankind has the means to bring obedient humans to perfection so that they can live forever. In the Bible this provision is called the ransom. The first human couple sold themselves and their offspring into slavery to sin and death. They traded life as perfect humans obedient to God for life independent of God, making their own decisions as to what is right and what is wrong. To buy back perfect human life, a price had to be paid that was equivalent to the perfect human life that our first parents forfeited. Having inherited imperfection, humans were not qualified to provide that price.—Psalm 49:7.
<br />So Jehovah God stepped in to help. He transferred the perfect life of his only-begotten Son to the womb of a virgin, who gave birth to Jesus. Decades ago, you might have rejected the idea of a virgin birth. Today, however, scientists have cloned mammals and introduced genes from one animal into another. Who, then, can rightly question the Creator's ability to bypass the ordinary process of procreation?
<br />With the existence of a perfect human life, the price to redeem mankind from sin and death became available. Yet, the baby born on earth as Jesus had to grow up to be the &quot;physician&quot; able to furnish the &quot;medication&quot; to cure mankind's ills. He did this by living a perfect, sinless life. Jesus not only saw the anguish of mankind under sin but experienced the physical limitations of being a man. This made him an even more compassionate physician. (Hebrews 4:15) The miraculous healings that he performed during his life on earth proved that he has both the will and the power to cure the sick.—Matthew 4:23.
<br />After a ministry of three and a half years here on earth, Jesus was killed by his opposers. He showed that a perfect man can be obedient to the Creator despite even the greatest trials. (1 Peter 2:22) His sacrificed perfect human life became the ransom price, able to redeem mankind from sin and death. Jesus Christ said: &quot;No one has love greater than this, that someone should surrender his soul in behalf of his friends.&quot; (John 15:13) On the third day after his death, Jesus was resurrected to spirit life, and some weeks later he ascended to heaven to present the ransom price to Jehovah God. (1 Corinthians 15:3, 4; Hebrews 9:11-14) By doing so, Jesus was able to apply the merit of his ransom sacrifice to those who follow him.
<br />Would you be willing to benefit from this way of healing spiritual, emotional, and physical sicknesses? To do so requires faith in Jesus Christ. Why not come to the Physician yourself? You can do that by learning about Jesus Christ and his role in saving faithful mankind.

		<document id="8cb77c6abff89e2245ab9a6a1f55911d" url=""><![CDATA[JESUS' MIRACLES-HISTORY OR MYTH?<br/><br/>FOR millions around the world, the belief that Jesus Christ worked miracles is almost as important as belief in God himself. The Gospel writers—Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John—describe some 35 of Jesus' miracles. Their accounts suggest, however, that he performed many more supernatural feats.—Matthew 9:35; Luke 9:11.
<br />These miracles were not performed for entertainment. They were intrinsic to Jesus' claim that he was the Son of God, the long-awaited Messiah. (John 14:11) Moses had performed miraculous signs when he presented himself to the enslaved nation of Israel. (Exodus 4:1-9) Logically, the Messiah, the one prophesied to be greater than Moses, would also have been expected to produce some sign of divine backing. (Deuteronomy 18:15) The Bible thus calls Jesus &quot;a man publicly shown by God to [the Jews] through powerful works and portents and signs.&quot;—Acts 2:22.
<br />In times past, people generally accepted without question the Bible's portrayal of Jesus as a miracle worker. But in recent decades, the Gospel accounts have come under fire from critics. In his book Deceptions and Myths of the Bible, Lloyd Graham refers to the Bible account of Jesus walking on the water and goes so far as to say: &quot;It takes a lot of ignorance to believe this literally, yet, literally, millions do. And then we wonder what's wrong with our world. What better world would you expect of such ignorance?&quot;
<br /><br />Impossible?
<br />Such criticisms are not reasonable, however. The World Book Encyclopedia defines a miracle as &quot;an event that cannot be explained through the known laws of nature.&quot; By that definition, a color TV, a cellular phone, or a laptop computer would have been considered miracles just a century ago! Does it make sense to be dogmatic and call something impossible simply because we cannot explain it according to present scientific knowledge?
<br />Another fact to consider: In the original Greek language in which the &quot;New Testament&quot; was written, the word used for &quot;miracle&quot; was dy'na•mis—a word basically meaning &quot;power.&quot; It is also rendered &quot;powerful works&quot; or &quot;ability.&quot; (Luke 6:19; 1 Corinthians 12:10; Matthew 25:15) The Bible claims that Jesus' miracles were a manifestation of &quot;the majestic power of God.&quot; (Luke 9:43) Would such works be impossible for an almighty God—One who has an &quot;abundance of dynamic energy&quot;?—Isaiah 40:26.
<br />Evidence of Authenticity
<br />A close examination of the four Gospels yields further evidence of their believability. For one thing, these accounts are markedly different from fairy tales and legends. Consider, for example, the false stories that circulated about Jesus in the centuries following his death. The apocryphal &quot;Gospel of Thomas&quot; relates: &quot;When this boy Jesus was five years old . . . , he went through the village, and a lad ran and knocked against his shoulder. Jesus was exasperated and said to him: 'You shall not go further on your way', and the child immediately fell down and died.&quot; It is not hard to see this story for what it is—a contrived piece of fiction. Furthermore, the capricious, mean-spirited child portrayed here bears no resemblance to the Jesus of the Bible.—Contrast Luke 2:51, 52.
<br />Now consider the authentic Gospel accounts. They are free of exaggeration and fictitious overtones. Jesus performed miracles in response to genuine need, not to satisfy mere caprice. (Mark 10:46-52) Never did Jesus use his powers to benefit himself. (Matthew 4:2-4) And he never used them to show off. In fact, when curious King Herod wanted Jesus to perform a miraculous &quot;sign&quot; for him, Jesus &quot;made him no answer.&quot;—Luke 23:8, 9.
<br />Jesus' miracles also stand in stark contrast to the work of professional illusionists, magicians, and faith healers. His powerful works always glorified God. (John 9:3; 11:1-4) His miracles were free of emotional rituals, magic incantations, showy displays, trickery, and hypnotism. When Jesus encountered a blind beggar named Bartimaeus who cried, &quot;Rabboni, let me recover sight,&quot; Jesus simply said to him: &quot;'Go, your faith has made you well.' And immediately he recovered sight.&quot;—Mark 10:46-52.
<br />The Gospel records show that Jesus performed his powerful works without props, specially planned staging, or trick lighting. They were performed out in the open, often in front of numerous eyewitnesses. (Mark 5:24-29; Luke 7:11-15) Unlike attempts by modern faith healers, his efforts to heal never failed because some ailing one supposedly lacked faith. Says Matthew 8:16: &quot;He cured all who were faring badly.&quot;
<br />In his book &quot;Many Infallible Proofs:&quot; The Evidences of Christianity, Scholar Arthur Pierson says of Christ's miracles: &quot;Their number, the instantaneous and complete character of the cures he wrought, and the absence of one failure in the attempt even to raise the dead, put infinite distance between these miracles and the pretended wonders of this or any other age.&quot;
<br />Secular Corroboration
<br />Pierson offers yet another argument that backs the Gospel accounts when he says: &quot;No confirmation of the miracles of scripture is more remarkable than the silence of enemies.&quot; Jewish leaders had more than ample motive for wanting to discredit Jesus, but his miracles were so well-known that opponents dared not deny them. All they could do was attribute such feats to demonic powers. (Matthew 12:22-24) Centuries after Jesus' death, the writers of the Jewish Talmud continued to credit Jesus with miraculous powers. According to the book Jewish Expressions on Jesus, they dismissed him as being one who &quot;followed the practices of magic.&quot; Would such a comment have been made if it was even remotely possible to dismiss Jesus' miracles as mere myth?
<br />Further proof comes from fourth-century church historian Eusebius. In his book The History of the Church From Christ to Constantine, he quotes a certain Quadratus who sent a letter to the emperor in defense of Christianity. Quadratus wrote: &quot;Our Saviour's works were always there to see, for they were true—the people who had been cured and those raised from the dead, who had not merely been seen at the moment when they were cured or raised, but were always there to see, not only when the Saviour was among us, but for a long time after His departure; in fact some of them survived right up to my own time.&quot; Scholar William Barclay observed: &quot;Quadratus is saying that until his own day men on whom miracles had been worked could actually be produced. If that was untrue nothing would have been easier than for the Roman government to brand it as a lie.&quot;
<br />Belief in the miracles of Jesus is reasonable, rational, and fully in harmony with the evidence. Nevertheless, Jesus' miracles are not dead history. Hebrews 13:8 reminds us: &quot;Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today, and forever.&quot; Yes, he is alive in the heavens today, able to use miraculous powers in a far grander way than he did when on earth as a human. Furthermore, the Gospel accounts of his miracles (1) teach Christians practical lessons today, (2) reveal fascinating aspects of Jesus' personality, and (3) point to a time in the near future when even more spectacular events will take place!
<br /><br />&quot;In the fourth watch period of the night he came to them, walking over the sea.&quot;
<br />—Matthew 14:25.
