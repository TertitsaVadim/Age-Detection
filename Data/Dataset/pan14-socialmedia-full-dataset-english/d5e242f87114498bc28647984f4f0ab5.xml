After all, you're the one who taught it to her. But it does help even so to see things from another viewpoint, so that you can break free of your roadblocks and get on to your own success.<br /><br />Conversational hypnosis is hard to perform, much less master, but when you master it, the only people standing between you and your goal are those who stand their ground with what they believe in. There's no harm in trying, though, so you might want to have a few tricks up your sleeve for a hard to crack person. This is what this article will be doing and by the time you're reading this, you may have something new in your arsenal of persuasion skills.<br /><br />Conversational hypnosis, or covert hypnosis for short, is the process of tapping into the subconscious of your target through words and gestures. It is dubbed as covert hypnosis because your target is not aware that you are working your magic on him. There are three tricks to a successful covert hypnosis ops; and they are gaining trust, not talking too much, and maintaining a veil of mystery. If you should talk, try to talk them into focusing their attention away from what you're doing.<br /><br />The simplest form of covert hypnosis I can cite is funnyman Jeff Dunham. Dunham is a ventriloquist stand up comedian, and if you haven't seen him before try watching him for some laughs. Dunham exchanges words with his puppets with funny dialogue, and the audience becomes enchanted with the puppet to mask whatever else the ventriloquist is doing such as moving the leg of a puppet so it would fall out of the podium; a situation the puppet will react to.<br /><br />In a nutshell, covert hypnosis masks your ulterior motives with flowery words and body language. This stealthy approach to hypnosis is essential to its success. Blow your cover, and your act is predictable. It is possible to recover, however, but only if you maintained an aura of mystery. For instance, if you spoke little but there are tons of meanings in your words, your mishap could be dismissed as nothing but a thought borne out of paranoia. If you have gained the trust of that person, your misstep will most likely be unnoticeable.<br /><br />Talking too much can cause you to say something you didn't want to say. This betrays the trust you established in the beginning, and your target will think of you as nothing more than a fraud. When all these three tricks fail, you have little to no chance of recovery. It's important that in conversational hypnosis, you try to protect these three. If you haven't established these images of yourself yet, you'd best be going.<br /><br />Most people vividly remember the scene in Star Wars when Obi Wan Kenobi looks into the eyes of a guard and convinces him that the three wanted fugitives right in front of him are not the people he is looking for.

Wouldn't it be great to have similar influence over people? The term conversational hypnosis suggests that we can.<br /><br />Of course, conversational hypnosis is not as simple as it sounds. Rather, it is a series of well-choreographed strategies and manipulations that may bring others around to your point of view.<br /><br />The principles of conversational hypnosis were first conceived by the great hypnotist and psychotherapist Milton Erickson. Erickson believed that trance states were not rare occurrences that had to be elaborately induced. He believed people slip into trance states several times a day, for instance, when they are waiting for a bus or concentrating very hard on something they are reading.<br /><br />Erickson also theorized that directly trying to induce a trance state in someone or trying to give them direct suggestions might lead to resistance. He preferred to use rapport, indirect suggestions, and confusion to induce trance states and influence compliance.<br /><br />Rapport<br /><br />The first step in conversational hypnosis is creating a rapport with the subject. This means agreeing with what they have to say. For instance, if the subject says, &quot;There's no way out of this,&quot; the proper response is, &quot;You're right. There's no way out.&quot;<br /><br />Confusion<br /><br />The next step in conversational hypnosis is to confuse the issue.

Blow your cover, and your act is predictable. It is possible to recover, however, but only if you maintained an aura of mystery. For instance, if you spoke little but there are tons of meanings in your words, your mishap could be dismissed as nothing but a thought borne out of paranoia. If you have gained the trust of that person, your misstep will most likely be unnoticeable.<br /><br />Talking too much can cause you to say something you didn't want to say. This betrays the trust you established in the beginning, and your target will think of you as nothing more than a fraud. When all these three tricks fail, you have little to no chance of recovery. It's important that in conversational hypnosis, you try to protect these three. If you haven't established these images of yourself yet, you'd best be going.<br /><br />When thinking about hypnosis, many people think of the swinging pocket watch on a chain, or gazing deeply into a spinning top. Believe it or not, there are no magical spells either, or incantations that must be invoked to induce a hypnotic state in someone.<br /><br />But what is conversational hypnosis, you might ask? Is it real and can it be used?<br /><br />Conversational or, as it is sometimes called covert hypnosis is very real and you can learn to use it. One of the main reasons people learn to use this form of hypnosis is to influence people subtly and indirectly.<br /><br />Milton Erickson, a noted psychotherapist, believed trance states were a natural phenomena that people slipped in and out of several times a day. With this knowledge, Erickson found that if he used indirect suggestions with a bit of confusion, timing and rhythm in his rapport with individuals, he could induce them into trance hypnotic states.<br /><br />There are three stages used in conversational hypnosis. The first stage is developing a rapport with the subject. The goal is putting yourself at ease, allowing the subject to get comfortable and become at ease with you. It is a subtle trust issue of letting the subject feel at home conversing with you. This also allows the subject to become receptive to you and that is important.<br /><br />The second stage of conversational hypnosis is more tricky. It requires you to throw some mild confusion into the conversational stew. Nothing dramatically alarming, but enough confusion to throw the subject off balance.<br /><br />As an example, the person might be discussing an incident involving someone both of you know. Suddenly you interject a point the person mentioned, yet you repeat it back to the subject as happening differently. When the subject tries to correct you, you agree with what he said the first time, acting as if you were both in agreement all along.<br /><br />To confuse is to put someone in a vulnerable state. You are throwing them off guard. In this state of confusion, the subject is now vulnerable and open to suggestion. Everyone is different, knowing that difference goes a long way to inducing a subject properly.<br /><br />If  conversational hypnosis sounds interesting, something you wish to delve into deeper, there are several good publications on the market that address this topic in great detail.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.itrainmymind.com%2Fconversational-hypnosis%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.itrainmymind.com/conversational-hypnosis/</a>

This focuses primarily on what most people know as the art of persuasion. What this means is covert hypnosis is different in a variety of ways from both clinical hypnosis and stage hypnosis.<br /><br />The use of clinical hypnosis is what hypnotists turn to when curing people from any particular phobias, or perhaps headaches. Using therapeutic hypnosis can help people with such things as losing weight and quitting smoking. The practice of stage hypnosis is all for show and entertainment. Therefore, it is not an appropriate style of hypnosis to learn if the power of persuasion interests you.<br /><br />The type of hypnosis you need to study in order to persuade people is what we refer to as covert hypnosis. The techniques used with this kind of hypnosis are language and behavioral. The goal of the hypnosis itself is to alter both the decision making process and the emotions of the person being hypnotized. The reason language patterns represent only part of this process is that no language pattern provides any guarantee of success. Not every conversation you engage in with a person will be identical, therefore language patterns simply offer models of communication, which are modifiable for each social instance you could possibly have with each person you are trying to hypnotize successfully.<br /><br />The covert persuasion behavioral techniques partially entail social strategy, as it is referred to by the art of persuasion. Any strategic behavioral patterns become persuasive techniques, which are quite valuable. You can imply the power of any non-verbal suggestions in order to influence those around you. A portion of any social strategy involves the ties you create, as well as the manner in which you decide to make use of them. Social strategy can also implicate arranging the appropriate social locations or environments at the right time.<br /><br />Therefore, covert hypnosis is a process of integrating a variety of distinct persuasion techniques into one fluid impact. A qualified trainer in this field should never rely on solely on language to influence people, as there will potentially be occasions when the people around you may not be willing to engage in conversation, or will feel uncomfortable doing so if they don't already know you. Thus, the persuasion artist needs to create the befitting social ambiance, which will result in people feeling drawn to talk to you.<br /><br />Another influence you will have in creating the correct social setting is positioning yourself as a figure of authority in various social arrangements. People will automatically regard you as a person of value where they will have a desire to speak with you. This will give you the perfect opportunity for covert hypnosis to begin.<br /><br />It is well known that companies such as Cadbury, and Volvo have used conversational hypnosis as part of their sales and market research programs. Others such as McDonalds and Wal-Mart require their leading executives to undertake hypnosis training as part of their induction. So what are the business advantages of understanding this skill and why are so many Fortune 500 companies looking to use NLP and hypnosis techniques?<br /><br />Conversational hypnosis is the skill of using apparently normal conversation to make suggestions to a person subconscious mind.

When you lose weight with hypnosis the process relaxes you and those feelings will carry over upon waking. This means you will have far fewer cases of stress eating because you'll have access to those same feelings of relaxation and satisfaction that you experience while under hypnosis. For most people, this is a key factor in weight loss because nearly everyone stress eats at least once a year or more.<br /><br />The hypnosis treatment will leave you feeling better about yourself and with more of a sense of control. People who feel better about themselves are more likely to make healthier lifestyle choices such as opting for a salad instead of those greasy fries. When you feel like you're in control of your life then you feel empowered to tackle things such as your weight. However to lose weight with hypnosis does not mean you'll be dropping three dress sizes in a month. Instead the focus of weight loss with this method is healthy, long-lasting weight loss. Doctors have long proved that losing one and a half to two pounds a week is the absolute most our bodies can handle and keep it off. This provides our bodies with enough time to actually adjust to its new needs, such as food intake. While we don't fully understand why hypnosis works, doctors do know it is possible to lose weight with hypnosis.<br /><br />By Mike Roberts.<br /><br />When hearing about covert persuasion, the subject is not only an art, but a science as well.

Say you've got a friend who's got lots of great ideas, seems gung ho at getting a business going, but then can never seem to follow through. She is absolutely stymied as to why things get stuck in this way. You can see that the problem is really low self-esteem rather than lack of smarts or initiative. When the going gets tough, in other words, your friend gives up because she simply thinks she doesn't have it in her to do it.<br /><br />You know better, so you want to help your friend increase her low self-esteem. That, you know, will help her be successful. So through covert hypnosis, you begin by absolutely agreeing with your friend when she says, &quot;I'll never make anything work!&quot; By absolutely agreeing with her (establishing rapport), you throw her off balance (create confusion), which gives you the ability to implant a suggestion while she's off balance that she can actually succeed.<br /><br />What if it's you, though? What if you don't have the ability to break through some particular roadblock you've got? You know about covert hypnosis, but obviously, you can't practice it on yourself.<br /><br />The solution is rather simple. Have a friend practice it on YOU. For example, if you've gotten someone out of the doldrums and onto a better life by doing covert hypnosis on him or her, eventually, you may just break the secret of why that was so successful. If you do, you can train that friend in the ins and outs of covert hypnosis, and then be the subject yourself during casual conversations.<br /><br />Now, here's the thing. You're not going to entirely be unaware that any kind of hypnosis is happening, likely, when your friend is practicing it on you. After all, you're the one who taught it to her. But it does help even so to see things from another viewpoint, so that you can break free of your roadblocks and get on to your own success.<br /><br />Conversational hypnosis is hard to perform, much less master, but when you master it, the only people standing between you and your goal are those who stand their ground with what they believe in.

		<document id="7844a12bbf030d89e265f7a434711e1a" url=""><![CDATA[covert hypnosisThe Principles of Conversational Hypnosis<br/><br/>On an unconscious level, the subject wants resolve from being confused and is open to solutions to escape this state of affairs the subject is now in.<br /><br />The third stage has everything to do with timing. While the subject is still in a state of confusion, the subject is also distracted. It is in this unconscious, distracted state that your window of opportunity is waiting for you to plant your suggestion.<br /><br />Remember, conversational hypnosis is subtle. If it is your boss at work you are setting up to hit for a raise, don't blow it with, &quot;By the way, you should give me that raise instead of Julie from accounting.&quot; The suggestion is not subtle and will bite you real fast.<br /><br />Conversational or covert hypnosis works, but not on everyone. The process takes practice in a few areas of the stages. Also, knowing how to properly read the subject is essential before trying this technique on them. Everyone is different, knowing that difference goes a long way to inducing a subject properly.<br /><br />If  conversational hypnosis sounds interesting, something you wish to delve into deeper, there are several good publications on the market that address this topic in great detail.<br /><br />The covert hypnosis community has lately been buzzing with excitement about a new training program controversially released by renegade hypnotist Steven Perliari.<br /><br />What makes this course unique is that you get to discover more 'dark side' areas of influence and persuasion that most other &quot;Politically Correct&quot; training programs avoid. You learn how mentalists, fake psychics, charletans and psychological illusionists like Derren Brown do their thing, and how you can easily replicate their tricks, and use them to influence, persuade and hypnotize others.<br /><br />It may sound a little weird - doing a fake psychic reading in order to hypnotize or persuade somebody - but it's actually quite simple, and even ticks all the boxes of a traditional persuasion set up. A technique like cold reading - where you pretend to psychically read someone's mind and tell them things about themselves that, supposedly, you could never have known (it's actually just a simple trick of language - and Steven shows you exactly how it's done), essentially works in 3 main ways...<br /><br />1: You overload or &quot;wow&quot; their conscious resistance offline, rendering them super responsive to the suggestions you give,<br /><br />2: You gain a massive amount of rapport by feeding back to someone what they perceive to be their most personal secrets, making them trust you very deeply and very quickly. This also acts as a very powerful form of pacing and leading, conditioning people to listen to, believe and respond to what you tell them.<br /><br />3: By demonstrating such mental insight you are giving yourself massive social proof. Whether you use cold reading or another mentalist style trick (you will learn several) the prestige and awe this gives you elevates your social status, and causes you to be perceived as an authority figure, making people highly likely to listen to you, and respond to what you tell them.<br /><br />Ok, so now we know vaguely how these techniques work, let's quickly address the key question of this article - are they dangerous, and should you be learning them?<br /><br />My answer is no and yes (in that order). Covert Hypnosis Revealed by Kevin Hogan is an essential addition to the library of any expert or aspiring hypnotist or persuader, and will not steer you wrong.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwallinside.com%2Fpost-204262.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://wallinside.com/post-204262.html</a> ,  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.getjealous.com%2Fblog.php%3Faction%3Dshowdiaryentry%26amp%3Bdiary_id%3D2064767%26amp%3Bgo%3Djos2010rademaker"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.getjealous.com/blog.php?action=showdiaryentry&amp;diary_id=2064767&amp;go=jos2010rademaker</a>

Yes, however you have to also.<br /><br />People are generally skeptical about the power of hypnosis to quit smoking. This is mainly because hypnosis is never advertised like other quit smoking aids like nicotine patches, gums, inhalers etc.<br /><br />To answer your question, does hypnosis work to quit smoking?<br /><br />Yes it does. And many people (including me) have used hypnosis successfully to stop smoking forever.<br /><br />Hypnosis is a rather unique technique that uses a very unique approach to assist in smoking cessation. It affects the sub conscious mind of the patient to inculcate a certain behavior in them. Just like smoking became a part of our life by repeated behavior over the years. But, hypnosis is method by which a new behavior can be inculcated in the sub conscious without the long and strenuous task of not smoking for years.<br /><br />So when you use hypnosis to quit smoking, this behavior, which is essentially that of a non-smoker is seated so deep in your brain that you will hardly feel the need to smoke after a few sessions.<br /><br />Hypnosis works by putting the patient in a relaxed state of mind. When in this sub conscious state, the hypnotist talks to the sub conscious mind and persuade it into thinking that you have been a non-smoker all along.<br /><br />This procedure might seem to be over ambitious to those who have never tried hypnosis before. But it has been used by many and is a clinically proven method.<br /><br />It has been proven that hypnosis is a legitimate technique and not some Hollywood fantasy. It is being used by the military, by the government, and even by top level scientists to study human behavior.<br /><br />In the sub conscious state of mind, humans are able to reach the part of their brain that they cannot achieve while they are conscious. This is exactly what hypnotist do to make a person quit smoking.<br /><br />Not only in smoking cessation, hypnosis has been used by millions to help them in many other problems of their lives. For example, weight loss, stress, self - confidence, procrastination etc.<br /><br />If you are still skeptical about hypnosis, then I would suggest you just give it a try. It doesn't cost much to download a hypnosis tape from the internet. It will only take a few minutes of your time and you can feel the effect instantly.<br /><br />You will never quit smoking unless you take action. Using hypnosis to quit smoking is taking action to achieve what you want.<br /><br />When we talk about hypnosis we mean working with your subconscious mind which is usually found on the right side of your brain. Whereas the conscious mind is on your left side. If you plan on going through self hypnosis then it is important that you know this.<br /><br />If we take your conscious mind, it's the part which is used during the waking day functions in a very critical and also logical way. This part of the brain doesn't really accept any sort of information till it can first decide if the information which it receives is logical or not. But then the subconscious functions which exist are kind of the opposite. You will be straying away from your main objective for the hypnosis.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fsegnalo.virgilio.it%2FJanPeeters%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://segnalo.virgilio.it/JanPeeters/</a> ,  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sitesays.com%2Fuser%2FTam2012Peeters"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.sitesays.com/user/Tam2012Peeters</a>

If you haven't established these images of yourself yet, you'd best be going.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fkira2010huysman.livejournal.com%2F2187.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://kira2010huysman.livejournal.com/2187.html</a> ,  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thoughts.com%2FTom2012Aerts%2Fconversation-hypnosis001"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.thoughts.com/Tom2012Aerts/conversation-hypnosis001</a>

You may have tried some of the more common techniques to help you kick the habit, but they haven't worked either.<br /><br />So, what do you do?<br /><br />Quit smoking with hypnosis!<br /><br />Hypnosis isn't the first thing you think of when you think of a stop smoking tool, but it can be far more effective than all of the &quot;well-known&quot; tools - like patches and gum. As an added benefit, when you utilize quit smoking hypnosis, you don't have to worry about uncomfortable withdrawals and cravings. Instead, hypnosis works quickly and effectively.<br /><br />In order to understand how stop smoking hypnosis works; you first have to understand the relationship between smoking and your mind.<br /><br />When you puff on a cigarette, the nicotine in it creates a powerful effect in your mind. Since it makes your mind feel good, your subconscious mind decides that this is a sensation that it wants to feel again and again. As a result, your subconscious can't stop thinking about it.<br /><br />The relationship between smoking and your mind is so strong that you can't quit on your own. Instead, you will need the help of a qualified consulting hypnotist. That's because hypnosis is the only stop smoking tool that actually address your addiction at its core - deep in your subconscious mind. The other tools - like the patches and the gum - address your conscious mind, but that's not the root of the problem. Until you deal with your subconscious, you will never be able to completely kick the habit.<br /><br />What exactly will you do?<br /><br />During a quit smoking hypnosis session, your consulting hypnotist will help you go into a trance-like state. Once you're in that state, you will have access to your subconscious, and your subconscious will be very open to suggestion.<br /><br />As a result, you can change the way your subconscious thinks of smoking. Instead of having a subconscious that thinks smoking is a great way to relax and feel good, you can teach it to view smoking as a terrible habit that's slowly killing you. By teaching your subconscious to associate smoking with bad things, it will stop craving cigarettes.<br /><br />During a quit smoking hypnosis session, you may also train your subconscious to do something else anytime you go to reach for a cigarette - like reaching for a glass of water instead.<br /><br />No matter which technique - or combination of techniques - you and your consulting hypnotist decide on, you can rest easy knowing that stop smoking hypnosis works quickly. In fact, you can be on your way to a longer life in just a few sessions!<br /><br />More and more people are turning to self hypnosis mp3s to aid them in their personal development. The reason for its popularity is that it is easy and convenient to use. Listening to it for just several minutes each day is enough to help you attain those positive adjustments that you wish for. It relaxes you and affects your subconscious in order to rid you of the negative things inside you that encumber you from living a happier life.<br /><br />Personal development is very important but very hard to achieve. It is well worth the rewards so try it for yourself today and do not hesitate.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fkira2010huysman.livejournal.com%2F2771.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://kira2010huysman.livejournal.com/2771.html</a> ,  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailystrength.org%2Fpeople%2F795474%2Fjournal"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.dailystrength.org/people/795474/journal</a>

When other hypnotherapists found out I was revealing information about covert hypnosis they didn't like it. So I beat them to the punch and formed a &quot;hippie&quot; anti-Nathan group.<br /><br />Why?<br /><br />I invite you to draw your own conclusions. Just ask what you think when you see a group of hippie protesters. Its highly unlikely the average person is going to want to join them - let alone believe them. People are herd followers, and most people will only follow the majority.<br /><br />Why would anyone want to be on the losing side?<br /><br />They wouldn't.<br /><br />So as it turns out, some people call me a witchcrafter, others call me the work of the devil - but hey, don't shoot the messenger.<br /><br />I decided to release covert hypnosis information to the general public because its used all the time right under their noses. And just because it can be used to seduce women, spawn cult leaders, and make money doesn't mean its my fault people use it that way.<br /><br />In other words, I can hand you a loaded gun but it doesn't mean that you have to pull the trigger - or even hold it (let alone point it at anyone).<br /><br />On the flipside, covert hypnosis knowledge is good to know because you can stop it dead in its tracks. You'll be able to spot it, disarm it, and retaliate. Plus, it can be used ethically. Imagine helping someone who is depressed feel a lot better, for example.<br /><br />Anyway, I've used a lot of covert hypnosis in this article already. There is &quot;wops, ambiguity, metaphors, perceptive associations&quot; and so on. If it sounds complicated don't worry, they're just fancy lables for easy methods.<br /><br />For example, remember the beginning of the article? I told you the first paragraph was hypnotic. You read a story about what &quot;my friend said and did&quot;... He visited the website at the end of the article and was amazed by it, remember? Let's look at this closer now... The story only makes sense to you by relating to my friends experience. In other words, you &quot;imagine&quot; saying and doing what my friend did and said.<br /><br />The simple sentence (to read the article to the end) then puts you into the future - you imagine reading the article to the end. Since the brain tends to follow what is imagined - you are still reading this, aren't you?<br /><br />I've also repeated myself a few times about reading this article to the end, and visiting the website when you finish this article ( <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.folkd.com%2Fdetail%2Fwww.folkd.com%252Fdetail%252Fwww.officialbookmark.com%25252Fstories%25252F268700%25252Fcovert_hypnosis002003.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.folkd.com/detail/www.folkd.com%2Fdetail%2Fwww.officialbookmark.com%252Fstories%252F268700%252Fcovert_hypnosis002003.html</a> ,  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fdelicious.com%2FTom2009Peters%3Fcount%3D15"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://delicious.com/Tom2009Peters?count=15</a>

Truthfully, the watch routine is making the subject feel weird and nauseated.<br /><br />Using watches to hypnotize like in stage shows are normal for entertainment purposes although the hypnotist's practice is real. People watching the show can really be captivated by the hypnotist since hypnosis seems to be very easy to do. How easy can it be? People who volunteer to be hypnotized by the stage hypnotist are willing individuals who are aware that they are going to be hypnotized and their mind is prepared for such activity. That is the first step. Acceptance. Second step is readiness. Third step is focus. Learning how to hypnotize someone with a watch is not necessary at this point. You don't need to swirl any object to the person you are going to hypnotize. It will just annoy the person or make him or her feel sick.<br /><br />How can you effectively hypnotize another person? You have to be equipped on the techniques about hypnotizing. Read books and check free websites online that teaches you how to learn hypnotism.<br /><br />Is it hard to learn? It is moderately challenging since you have to study how it is done and you have to be committed. It is like studying any subject in school. You have to read the basics. You also have to practice what you know and hypnotism doesn't successfully happen overnight. You have to practice over and over again until you get it right. How to hypnotize someone with a watch used to be a technique until conversational hypnosis, NLP, induction hypnosis and other methods proved to be more useful.<br /><br />To be truly exceptional in the art of hypnotism, you must go through a learning process before you can see the outcome. Use the skill on the &quot;field&quot;. Practice whenever you have the chance and you should start that with people you know to achieve some positive feedback. The more you use your hypnotism techniques, the quicker you will be learning from it and improve yourself every time you use it. The more hypnotism techniques you learn, the better hypnotist you are going to be. Say goodbye to the notion on how to hypnotize someone with a watch. Hypnotize someone with the expertise that you have acquired.<br /><br />If you want to learn how to hypnotize someone, it is probably best to learn from a working hypnotist, if possible.  Some hypnotists are reluctant to reveal their techniques, both because they may be earning a good living from a few simple secrets, and because they would prefer that their 'club' of hypnotists remain small and exclusive.<br /><br />If you want to learn how to hypnotize someone in particular, you should be aware that it is thought that some very literal minded or skeptical people cannot be hypnotized, and many hypnotists also believe that no-one can be hypnotized against their will. However, this is still a matter of debate. Also, people vary in their levels of 'suggestibility' - this is their natural tendency to go along with suggestions or instructions.  A very assertive person with a big ego may make a difficult subject, while a timid or enthusiastic person will be an easy one. Furthermore, there are some especially important factors for the suggestion scripts, and most stages should be tailored to the subject.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.democratandchronicle.com%2Fapps%2Fpbcs.dll%2Fsection%3Fcategory%3DPluckPersona%26amp%3BU%3Ddc7e8f89658b465d87b5d2e6521899f5%26amp%3BplckPersonaPage%3DBlogViewPost%26amp%3BplckUserId%3Ddc7e8f89658b465d87b5d2e6521899f5%26amp%3BplckPostId%3DBlog%253adc7e8f89658b465d87b5d2e6521899f5Post%253a889b8d70-6b6e-44d2-ae7d-be84d8ede537%26amp%3BplckBlogItemsPerPage%3D5"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.democratandchronicle.com/apps/pbcs.dll/section?category=PluckPersona&amp;U=dc7e8f89658b465d87b5d2e6521899f5&amp;plckPersonaPage=BlogViewPost&amp;plckUserId=dc7e8f89658b465d87b5d2e6521899f5&amp;plckPostId=Blog%3adc7e8f89658b465d87b5d2e6521899f5Post%3a889b8d70-6b6e-44d2-ae7d-be84d8ede537&amp;plckBlogItemsPerPage=5</a> ,  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailystrength.org%2Fpeople%2F795474%2Fjournal"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.dailystrength.org/people/795474/journal</a>

This will awaken your conscious mind. You will find yourself refreshed and aware of things more than when the process was started. Repeat this process several times a week until the results are achieved. This is only one technique to perform self-hypnosis. There are many other techniques available.<br /><br />One area to be concerned with is you conscious mind interfering with the self-hypnosis process. It is natural for you to think of several other items when you are trying to concentrate on one task for relaxation. Resist the temptation to do so. Focus all of your attention on one task. Do not think about what is going to happen in an hour, in the afternoon or even tomorrow. If this happens renew your efforts to narrow thoughts to one item. Keep the item in mind, then relax completely. Your subconscious mind is powerful, if it is controlled properly, performing tasks that used to be impossible are now achieved. The results are rewarding, plus a feeling of complete control happens without being aware of it occurring.

What's your purpose?

You have to answer these questions so that you will have a clear definition of your goals.<br /><br />Define the goal then focus your attention towards it. It's best that you define a single goal. Self hypnosis techniques are least effective when you are gunning several goals simultaneously. Learn to do it one step at a time.<br /><br />Hypnosis won't work if you are thinking of a lot of things.

In other word, Hypnosis  is a 'suggestion' that being used by someone to persuade other people to do something where people who has given 'suggestion' not even realized it.<br /><br />There are several types of hypnosis and its very popular now.<br /><br />- Ericksonian hypnosis<br />- Subliminals<br />- Traditional hypnosis<br />- Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP)<br /><br />A very simple technique of hypnosis is a Questions or 'Story telling'. When people ask for something or telling a story, we can say that they offers a suggestion to our unconscious mind. This technique has been developed by Milton Erickson which is the author of isomorphic metaphors (Isomorphic metaphors is a hypnosis technique that persuaded someone by telling a story and the unconscious draws a one-to-one relationship between elements of the story and elements of a problem situation or behavior).<br /><br />If we could discover more about hypnosis then we can find a huge benefit of it. Basicly, people can use it in different way like self-hypnosis, Hypnotherapy, psycotherapy etc.<br /><br />In medical, Hypnosis is used by physicians or psychologists to treat many disease like stress, depression, over weight. And for people who want to quit smoking, They can use self-hypnosis to against it.<br /><br />Bottom line, Hypnosis can be a useful method to solve your health problem. you can learn more about hypnosis in conversational hypnosis techniques site.<br /><br />As every story requires an introduction before the denouement, or sex requires foreplay before the climax, hypnosis inductions are techniques utilized by hypnotherapists prior to the &quot;trance&quot; stage of hypnosis itself.  These techniques are imperative in the process of hypnosis as such requires attention in order to determine the best method suitable for different personalities undergoing hypnosis.<br /><br />The most common, and perhaps the father of all hypnosis inductions is the Eye-Fixation technique. It is when the hypnotherapist uses an object as a means of focusing one's attention. It can be any object with a striking color or image, held from about eighteen inches from the eyes, at a position above the forehead (10 or 11 o'clock position) in order for the eyes and eyelids to strain, and the subject to steadily  stare at the object. This technique is very common and is even often seen in movies.<br /><br />Relaxation technique is another method of induction. This is when the subject is asked to close their eyes and follow a guiding voice (the voice of the hypnotherapist that is).  This method requires skill in both parties, as this involves the imagination. This is best to use for subjects who are auditory rather than visual. Auditory individuals appreciate hearing words and have well-developed vocabularies. They have finely tuned ears and can easily process information they hear. They can easily picture what they hear and stay focused, leading them to the trance stage.<br /><br />Hypnosis inductions come in many different forms, approaches and methodologies. These techniques are practiced and applied depending on the type of personality in order to achieve the desired results for those who undergo the process. Bottom line is this: it is only you who knows which hypnosis techniques benefit you.<br /><br />Starting right with hypnosis which means learning how to perform it before actually doing it will help you understand more and benefit from the merits of self hypnosis techniques.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fsegnalo.virgilio.it%2FJanPeeters%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://segnalo.virgilio.it/JanPeeters/</a> ,  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bibsonomy.org%2Fuser%2Fmiep2010geevers"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.bibsonomy.org/user/miep2010geevers</a>

This British hypnotist and magician often uses covert hypnosis to convince his 'victims' to do exactly what he wants them to do. On one occasion, he even made them accept blank pieces of paper believing, in fact, that it was money that he used to pay them for some goods.<br /><br />But I digress! Here's how my own story unfolded...<br /><br />One day, whilst living in France, I went to the supermarket to buy some food and also a gift for my husband.<br />The food only cost a few euros, and I intended to use my private savings to pay for the gift separately.<br /><br />Whilst waiting in line, I spent some time in preparing the correct payment in order to speed up the buying process at the front counter.<br /><br />My gift cost 11.36 euro and, since I didn't want to end up having a large quantity of small change, I prepared by sorting out my last 20 euro note together with a 2 euro coin to pay for the gift.<br /><br />Now, here's where the cashier became confused.<br /><br />When it finally came my turn to pay, the cashier registered my gift and then asked me if the food was also mine. I relied &quot;Yes&quot;, but I wished to pay for the items as two separate purchases.<br /><br />He said &quot;Okay&quot; and then told me that I should first pay him 11.36 euro.<br /><br />Looking slightly bored, he turned his head away to look at the people waiting in the line. However, I soon caught his attention, looked him straight in the eye and said: &quot;Here! I have the money all ready for you!&quot;<br /><br />I then handed him the 20 euro note plus the 2 euro coin. The cashier looked surprised. He took my money, placed them in the register and gave me back 64 cents.<br /><br />&quot;Excuse me,&quot; I said. &quot; But I gave you a 20 euro note.&quot;<br /><br />The cashier looked at me and said in a calm tone of voice: &quot;No, it was a 10 euro note. I distinctly saw it.&quot;<br /><br />All of a sudden, he had me doubting myself.<br /><br />I truly believed I gave him a 20 euro note, but... he sounded absolutely sure of himself. I paid for the food from my other purse, and then I asked him again: &quot;Are you sure that I didn't give you a 20 euro note?&quot; - &quot;Absolutely sure&quot; was his reply.<br /><br />We had already recognized each other, since I shopped regularly in that supermarket, and he seemed like an honest guy.<br /><br />The trip home only took a few minutes and, whilst walking, I took my time to think the whole episode over once again.<br /><br />I knew that, only a short while ago, I had a specific amount of money in my purse. I knew I had only purchased three things prior to this and, after some simple calculations, I was certain that I had given him a 20 euro note.<br /><br />Home again, I telephoned the supermarket and told them what had happened.<br /><br />They asked the cashier to close the register and count the money in the till.<br /><br />After a short while, our telephone rang, and I heard the cashier's embarrassed voice. It is a simple way of just getting you acquainted with how to hypnotize yourself.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fmylinkvault.com%2FAnn2009Neyens%2Fpage-1.htm"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://mylinkvault.com/Ann2009Neyens/page-1.htm</a> ,  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.officialbookmark.com%2Fstories%2F274050%2Fconversation_hypnosis002003.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.officialbookmark.com/stories/274050/conversation_hypnosis002003.html</a>

So if you have a belief that says &quot;I am a smoker.&quot; then that programming will sit in your subconscious mind and become part of your belief system.<br /><br />That's why some people find it so hard to stop smoking. They feel like they are ready and want to make the change, but if their subconscious believes them to be a smoker then they will be doomed to fail. It doesn't matter how much you think you want to stop at a conscious level, unless you can convince your subconscious mind it will never happen.<br /><br />Hypnosis provides a safe and very effective way of doing just that. It bypasses the critical conscious mind and talks directly to the subconscious changing and removing your limited and unhelpful beliefs, increasing your chance of success.<br /><br />Some people are afraid of hypnosis, believing they will somehow have to give away control. Nothing could be further from the truth and hypnosis is actually nothing more than a deeply focused daydream. It's often called a trance and this can put people off, but the truth is that most of us spend at least some of the day in trance. For example have you ever driven home and realise you have no conscious memory of the journey? It can be scary, but it was simply you going into a mild trance. You trust your subconscious mind to let you breathe so its perfectly safe to let it drive you home. Don't worry, if anything out of the ordinary had happened, your conscious mind would have been alerted straight away.<br /><br />So can hypnosis be used to deliver real change. Absolutely yes, and as a bonus, it is safe and effective and has no side effects!<br /><br />I have been a clinical hypnotherapist for several years and I have closely witnessed many almost miraculous results with hypnosis. Whilst I am not claiming that hypnosis can help with everything all the time, it does a pretty fantastic job in my experience.<br /><br />Over the last several years I have helped so many people with such a wide array of things. I have helped probably hundreds of people, maybe thousands quit smoking for example. I have helped many people lose weight, quit addictions, become more confident, attract a new partner...the list goes on. I receive many heart warming emails from across the globe from satisfied clients who have listened to my audio sessions. From experience I know that hypnosis works.<br /><br />Hypnosis works by reprogramming the subconscious mind. The subconscious mind is the most powerful part of our mind. It is the part that is intuitive, creative, and instinctive. It is the part of our mind that is responsible for our habits, fear responses and automatic functions such as our breathing, sweating and heart rate.<br /><br />Although our subconscious mind is very powerful, it has difficulty understanding language. That is why you can explain to a small child or indeed anyone that a spider is nothing to fear. On a conscious level that person will fully understand and probably agree. The reality is that there are countless examples of people who have overcome their key issues and that have stopped a number of addictions.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fdelicious.com%2FTom2009Peters%3Fcount%3D15"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://delicious.com/Tom2009Peters?count=15</a> ,  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fdiary.com%2Fnotes%2F3079287"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://diary.com/notes/3079287</a>

Master persuaders and hypnotists have been integrating conversational hypnosis techniques within their everyday conversations to convince people to accept their ideas; and they've been proven to work.<br /><br />One simple yet effective conversational hypnosis technique is the use of presuppositions. Presuppositions assume that the person you're persuading has already accepted your proposal or has reached an agreement with you, even he has not yet done so. See how the questions below &quot;presupposes&quot; your desired outcome.<br /><br />&quot;Are you still willing to join me in my quest?&quot; (This question does not ask &quot;if&quot; you're willing, but it presupposes that you're already willing.)<br /><br />&quot;I will give you $100 when you finish this task. (Notice I didn't say &quot;if&quot; but &quot;when.&quot<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/wink.gif" alt=":)" /><br /><br />&quot;When do you want to start doing your assignment?&quot; (It assumes you already want to do it; the only question is &quot;when&quot; to start).<br /><br />&quot;How happy are you to be here in this memorable event?&quot; (It assumes you're already happy; the only question is your level of happiness.)<br /><br />&quot;I'm glad you checked this out. This will give you the perfect opportunity for covert hypnosis to begin.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2FMiet.newsvine.com%2F_news%2F2011%2F09%2F25%2F7950435-conversation-hypnosis001"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://Miet.newsvine.com/_news/2011/09/25/7950435-conversation-hypnosis001</a> ,  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fway2bookmarks.com%2Fstory.php%3Ftitle%3Dconversation-hypnosis002003"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://way2bookmarks.com/story.php?title=conversation-hypnosis002003</a>
