<br />Malaysia Rs 18 per litr
<br />In India it's 51 per litr
<br />Why this difference in Asia itself ? World Market CRUDE Oil is not
<br />the reason for this. It's all Gain for private owners? As we are the
<br />general public, or Common Man as R.K.Laxman wud hv said, we have to
<br />raise our voice.
<br />IT HAS BEEN CALCULATED THAT IF EVERYONE DID NOT PURCHASE A DROP OF
<br />PETROL FOR ONE DAY AND ALL AT THE SAME TIME, THE OIL COMPANIES WOULD
<br />CHOKE ON THEIR STOCKPILES.
<br />AT THE SAME TIME IT WOULD HIT THE ENTIRE INDUSTRY WITH A NET LOSS
<br />OVER 4.6 BILLION DOLLARS WHICH AFFECTS THE BOTTOM LINES OF THE OIL
<br />COMPANIES.
<br />THEREFORE &quot; 24th JANUARY &quot; HAS BEEN FORMALLY DECLARED
<br />AS NO PETROL DAY NO 1 SHOULD BUY PETROL..

<br />  This is all about Maha Shivratri that y we celebrate it..... and wht is Shivratri... Hope u'll like to read it..... Bam Bam Bhole....... Bam Bam Bhole...
<br /><br />Happy Maha Shivratri......
<br /><br />About Maha Shivaratri
<br /><br />Maha Shivaratri is celebrated throughout the country; it is particularly popular in Uttar Pradesh. Maha Shivratri falls on the 14th day of the dark half of 'Margasirsa' (February-March). The name means &quot;the night of Shiva&quot;. The ceremonies take place chiefly at night. This is a festival observed in honour of Lord Shiva and it is believed that on this day Lord Shiva was married to Parvati.
<br /><br />On this festival people worship 'Shiva - the Destroyer'. This night marks the night when Lord Shiva danced the 'Tandav'. In Andhra Pradesh, pilgrims throng the Sri Kalahasteshwara Temple at Kalahasti and the Bharamarambha Malikarjunaswamy Temple at Srisailam.
<br /><br />About The Lord
<br /><br />Shiva - the word meaning auspicious - is one of the Hindu Trinity, comprising of Lord Brahma, the creator, Lord Vishnu, the preserver and Lord Shiva or Mahesh, the Destroyer and Re-Producer of life. Shiva is known by many names like &quot;Shankar&quot;, &quot;Mahesh&quot;, &quot;Bholenath&quot;, &quot;Neelakanth&quot;, &quot;Shambhu Kailasheshwar&quot;, &quot;Umanath&quot;, &quot;Nataraj&quot; and others.
<br /><br />For few people, Shiva is &quot;Paramatman&quot;, &quot;Brahman&quot;, the Absolute, but many more prefer to see Shiva as a personal God given to compassion for his worshippers, and the dispenser of both spiritual and material blessings. Related to the Absolute concept is Shiva as &quot;Yoganath&quot; meaning the Lord of Yoga, wherein he becomes teacher, path and goal. As such he is the &quot;Adi Guru&quot; or the Highest Guru of 'Sannyasins' who have renounced the world to attain the Absolute.
<br /><br />He is the most sought-after deity amongst the Hindus and they pray to him as the god of immense large-heartedness who they believe grants all their wishes. Around him are weaved many interesting stories that reveal His magnanimous heart. Not only this, but these stories and legends also enrich the Indian culture and art.
<br /><br />Time is invisible and formless. Therefore Mahakal Shiva, as per the Vedas, manifested himself as &quot;LINGUM&quot; to make mankind aware of the presence of Eternal Time. That day when Shiva manifested himself in the form of &quot;Lingum&quot; was the fourth day of the dark night in the month of 'Magha' i.e. February-March. Maha Shivratri continues to be celebrated forever and ever.
<br /><br />Shiva ratri vratam
<br /><br />Shiva rathri is one of the most auspicious vratas (Fast) for the devotees of Lord shiva.
<br /><br />History of Shivaratri
<br /><br />Once when everything in all the worlds got reduced into Lord shiva, in that darkness of nothing present, the mother pArvati worshipped Lord shiva in the Agamic way with great devotion. The parameshwar pleased by Her prayer blessed Her. She asked for the benefit of all the creatures that in future whoever worships the Lord on the shiva rAtri day with devotion, they should be blessed and should be given the ultimate liberation. The pashupati granted that showing way for all of us to get blessed easily.
<br />When Brahma and Vishnu fought between themselves as &quot;who is the greatest&quot;, Lord Shiva appeared before them as a pillar of fire. They were not able to find the starting and end of that pillar. This day is Thirukkaarthikai.(1)
<br /><br />Then Brahma and Mahavishnu repented for their mistake and prayed to Lord Shiva for forgiving their sin worshiping the shiva li.ngam which is the form of the flame. In the night of Shiva rathri Lord Shiva appeared before them and blessed them. Devotees pray the God throughout the night of Shiva rathri by performing Abisheka, chanting and other holy deeds.
<br />Every month in Krishna paksha chathurdhasi (fourteenth moonday) is called masa Shiva rathri. The one that comes in the month of &quot;Masi&quot; (mid February to mid March) is called Maha Shiva rathri. This is considered as the most important vrata by the devotees.
<br /><br />There are many incidents told about the greatness of this day. Once a hunter in a jungle after searching throughout the jungle, was quite tired and could not get any animal. In the nightfall a tiger started chasing him. to escape from that he climbed a tree. That was a Bilva tree. The tiger sat under the tree waiting for him to come down. The hunter who sat on a branch of the tree was quite tense and didn't want to sleep. He was plucking the leaves and putting down as he was not able to be idle. Below the tree there was a Shiva lingam. The whole night went on like this. God was pleased with the Upavasa (hunger) and the Pooja the hunter and the tiger did even without knowledge. He is the peak of the grace. He gave the hunter and the tiger &quot;Moksha&quot;.
<br /><br />In a Shiva temple on a Maha Shiva rathri day the lamp kept in the altar was very dim. That time a mouse which came take its prey touched the flame. Due to the heat it moved its head immediately. In the process it kindled the lamp and the altar was illuminated well. Lord Shiva, pleased by this deed made the mouse Mahabali, the renowned asura king.
<br /><br />There are many incidents like this told in our Puraanas. If we do the vrata with pure devotion and love there can be no doubt about getting the Grace of the Almighty.
<br /><br />The Story Of King Chitrabhanu
<br /><br />In the Shanti Parva of the Mahabharata, Bhishma, whilst resting on the bed of arrows and discoursing on Dharma, refers to the observance of Maha Shivaratri by King Chitrabhanu. The story goes as follows - Once upon a time King Chitrabhanu of the Ikshvaku dynasty, who ruled over the whole of Jambudvipa, was observing a fast with his wife, it being the day of Maha Shivaratri. The sage Ashtavakra came on a visit to the court of the king.
<br />The sag asked the king the purpose of his observing the past. King Chitrabhanu explained that he had the gift of remembering the incidents of his previous birth.
<br /><br />The king said to the sage that in his previous he was a hunter in Varanasi and his name was Suswara. His only livelihood was to kill and sell birds and animals. One day while roaming through forests in search of animals he was overtaken by the darkness of night. Unable to return home, he climbed a tree for shelter. It happened to be a Bael tree. He had shot a deer that day but had no time to take it home. So he bundled it up and tied it to a branch on the tree. As hunger and thirst tormented him, he was kept awake throughout the night. He shed profuse tears when he thought of his poor wife and children who were starving and anxiously waiting for his return. To pass away the time that night he engaged himself in plucking the Bael leaves and dropping them down onto the ground.
<br /><br />The next day he returned home and sold the deer and then bought some food for himself and his family. The moment he was about to break his fast a stranger came to him, begging for food. He served the food first to stranger and then had his own.
<br /><br />At the time of his death, he saw two messengers of Lord Shiva. They were sent down to conduct his soul to the abode of Lord Shiva. He learnt then for the first time of the great merit he had earned by the unconscious worship of Lord Shiva during the night of Shivaratri. The messengers told him that there was a Lingam at the bottom of the tree. The leaves I dropped fell on the Lingam. His tears, which had shed out of pure sorrow for his family, fell onto the Lingam and washed it and he had fasted all day and all night. Thus, he unconsciously worshiped the Lord.
<br /><br />As the conclusion of the tale the King said that he lived in the abode of the Lord and enjoyed divine bliss for long ages and now he has reborn as Chitrabhanu.
<br /><br />The Festivity
<br /><br />People observe a strict fast on this day. Some devotees do not even take a drop of water and they keep vigil all night. The Shiva Lingam is worshipped throughout the night by washing it every three hours with milk, curd, honey, rose water, etc., whilst the chanting of the Mantra &quot;Om Namah Shivaya&quot; continues. Offerings of Bael leaves are made to the Lingam as Bael leaves are considered very sacred and it is said that Goddess Lakshmi resides in them.
<br /><br />Hymns in praise of Lord Shiva, such as the &quot;Shiva Mahimna Stotra&quot; of Pushpadanta or Ravana's &quot;Shiva Tandava Stotra&quot; are sung with great fervour and devotion. People repeat the 'Panchakshara' Mantra, &quot;Om Namah Shivaya&quot;. He, who utters the names of Shiva during Shivratri, with perfect devotion and concentration, is freed from all sins. He reaches the abode of Shiva and lives there happily. He is liberated from the wheel of births and deaths. Many pilgrims dock to the places where there are Shiva temples.

But even the great philosophers, with their profound definitions, could not fully touch its true essence. In a survey of 4-8 year olds, kids share their views on love. But what do little kids know about love? Read on and be surprised that despite their young and innocent minds, kids already have a simple but deep grasp of that four-letter word. 
<br /><br />&quot;Love is that first feeling you feel before all the bad stuff gets in the way.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;When my grandmother got arthritis, she couldn't bend over and paint her toenails anymore. So my grandfather does it for her all the time, even when his hands got arthritis too. That's love.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;When someone loves you, the way she says your name is different. You know that your name is safe in her mouth.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;Love is when a girl puts on perfume and a boy puts on shaving cologne and they go out and smell each other.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;Love is when you go out to eat and give somebody most of your french fries without making them give you any of theirs.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;Love is when someone hurts you. And you get so mad but you don't yell at him because you know it would hurt his feelings.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;Love is when my mommy makes coffee for my daddy and she takes a sip before giving it to him, to make sure the taste is OK.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;Love is when you kiss all the time. Then when you get tired of kissing, you still want to be together and you talk more. My mommy and daddy are like that. They look gross when they kiss but they look happy and sometimes they dance in the kitchen while kissing.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;When you tell someone something bad about yourself and you're scared she won't love you anymore. But then you get surprised because not only does she still love you, she loves you even more.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;Love is when you tell a guy you like his shirt, then he wears it everyday.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;Love is like a little old woman and a little old man who are still friends even after they've know each other so well.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;During my piano recital, I was on a stage and scared. I looked at all the people watching me and saw my daddy waving and smiling. He was the only one doing that. I wasn't scared anymore.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;My mommy loves me more than anybody. You don't see anyone else kissing me to sleep at night.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;Love is when mommy gives daddy the best piece of chicken.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;Don't feel so bad if you don't have a boyfriend/girlfrein d. There's lots of stuff you can do without one.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;Love is when mommy sees daddy smelly and sweaty and still says he is handsomer than Robert Redford.
<br /><br />&quot;Love is when your puppy licks your face even after you left him alone all day&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;When you're born and see your mommy for the first time.
<br /><br />&quot;Love goes on even when you stop breathing and you pick up where you left off. 
<br /><br />&quot;I know my older sister loves me because she gives me all her old clothes and has to go out and buy new ones.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;You really shouldn't say 'I love you' unless you mean it. But if you mean it, you should say it a lot. People forget.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;You have to fall in love before you get married. Then when you're married, you just sit around and read books together.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;You never have to be lonely. There's always somebody to love, even if it's just a squirrel or a kitten.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;You can break love, but it won't die.&quot;
