<br />secure a feeling of happiness and wellbeing is misplace. The truth-the liberating truth-is that the two have nothing to do with each other. Our most glorious dreams are like quicksand. Far from making us happy, most desires, even when fulfilled, are often a burden that we are then forced to carry.

<br />even into old age.
<br />Our thinking, learning, and acting, can turn our genes on or off, thus shaping our brain anatomy, and our behavior. The idea, that the brain can change its own structure, and activity, is the most important news.
<br />All of the disciplines will have to come to terms with the fact of the self-changing brain, and with the realization, that the architecture of the brain differs from one person to the next, and that it changes in the course of our individual lives.
<br />Best wishes!

<br />1.	In business, when things aren`t working it`s time to mix it up
<br />2.	Deals are the art form, Other people paint beautifully on canvas or write wonderful  poetry, one can make deals, preferably by big deals
<br />3.	One doesn’t make deals for the money. One has got enough, much more than you`ll ever need. You must do it to do it.
<br />4.	A little more moderation would be good. Of course, you life hasn`t exactly been one of moderation.
<br />5.	As long as you`re going to be thinking anyway, think big.
<br />6.	Sometimes your best investments are the ones you don`t make.
<br />7.	I try to learn from the past, but I plan for the future by focusing exclusively on the present. That`s where the fun is.
<br />8.	Money was never a big motivation for me, except as a way to keep score. The real excitement is playing the game.
<br />9.	If you`re interested in `balancing` work and pleasure, stop trying to balance them. Instead make your work more pleasurable.
<br />10.	Part of being a winner knows when enough is enough. Sometimes you have to give up the fight and walk away, and move on to something that`s more productive

<br />If the focus isn`t on the money, but on the jobs that bring the money, these jobs are generally thought to make people happy. People strive for that perfect relationship, the perfect house, the beautiful body, the approval of others, all in an attempt to be happy.
<br />Some of them are the things that you would expect; money, friends, health, living conditions; others are things you may not think of in your daily life, such as your neighborhood, community involvement, and sense of meaning in life.

Economy is stressing people out, and stress has been linked to a number of illnesses, especially to weight gain. In addition to weight gain associated with financial problems, or a difficult job, woman also added ponds, when grappling with strained family relationships, and feeling limited, by life`s circumstances.

<br /> ? 
<br />Manners make the middle class in any country. 
<br />Catching up with the west begins with good manners; not cars, stereos or even blue jeans. It is simply a ?matter of putting the horse before the cart. Manners are all about how we treat others whom we don`t know ?personally, and probably never will. As early as 1873, Professor Thomas E Hill wrote a book “Essential ?Handbook of Victorian Etiquette”. He mentioned:  
<br />?01. Do not always commence a conversation by an allusion to wealth,  
<br />?02. Do not call upon a person in reduced circumstances with a display of wealth, dress and equipage. 
<br />?03. Do no make a parade of being acquainted with distinguished or wealthy people or visiting foreign lands. 
<br />?04. Never be over-boastful in praise of one`s country,

<br />Most of us invariably take a look at ourselves in the mirror at least once a day. The mirror ?diligently and without being judgmental, reflects what is and what is not. We accept what it tells ?us without much complaint. We then try to better, in whatever way possible, that which is ?possible to change for the better and simply accept the rest as given. We take pride in what we ?have in terms of form, beauty and appearance and try not to dwell too much on what we lack ?outwardly. We may also resolve and work towards those areas that need to be improved. We step ?out of the house, with this `approved` confidence, and are ready to take on the world.?
<br />Let`s say we are able to hold the mirror to reflect our mind and heart. Chances are that most of us ?don`t make the effort, perhaps because we my not approve of the kind of reflection we might get ?to see. It may be too much for our ego state to accept. It is never easy to get ourselves to accept ?what we don`t like to see n us, especially that which we cannot actually `see`.?
<br />Your views, suggestions, or comments are most welcome. 
<br />Kind Regards!?

<br />In India, the big `C` stands not so much for `Cancer` as for `Corruption. Corruption, which seems to ?thrive at all levels, is perhaps the single biggest threat to our national economic and ethical ?health.  
<br />Abolish corruption? It`s like saying `let `a abolish gravity`. Corruption has become as essential ?factor in our lives as gravity, which keeps everything in its place. Any suggestion that it could be ?done away with sounds like a joke, and not a particularly funny one at that.  
<br />OK, so corruption is something unavoidable, something that we have to learn to live with. But ?who`s responsible for it? How does the spiral of corruption begin? Who`s at the beginning of the ?ghoos story? The other day, the answer to that question was revealed tome. I realized who the ?source of corruption is: it was me.?
