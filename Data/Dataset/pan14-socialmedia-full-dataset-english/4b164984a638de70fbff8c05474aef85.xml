<br /><br />The image of cereal bars as a healthy snack is a ‘myth’, as study finds that many contain higher levels of fat and sugar than a can of cola. According to study, one of the 30 bars contains more than 30% sugar. Specifically, one bar, Nutri-Grain Elevenses, contained nearly four teaspoons of sugar (18g) – more than in a small 150ml can of cola (15.9g) and 20% of the recommended daily allowance.
<br /><br />A kind of tracker roasted nut bar was found to be almost a third fat, and while some of this came from the peanuts and hazelnuts that also provide some nutritional content, the ingredients also contained vegetable fat and harmful hydrogenated fats. A cereal bar named monster puffs with their tag line “great for your lunchbox” marketed to children, contained 43.5% sugar, or more than two teaspoons.
<br /><br />As Micron Associates Health Group compared the nutritional content of the bars they have used the manufacturer’s information and applied traffic light labeling to see if the levels of fat, saturated fat, sugar and salt were high, medium or low.
<br /><br />The study found out that there were six of the seven cereal bars targeted at children were high in saturated fat. Only the Nakd Apple Pie was the only bar in the said study did not contain any added sugar, while the Alpen Light Apple and Sultana was the only one to have three green traffic lights for fat, saturated fat and salt. The Weetabix Oaty Strawberry Crusher bar was the healthiest choice for children with a low salt content and medium levels of fat and saturated fat, the Micron Health concluded.
<br /><br />World Health Organization is calling for manufacturers to reduce sugar and fat in food products marketed to children and for tighter controls over the way they are promoted. Executive director Richard Lloyd said: ”People often choose cereal bars in the belief they’re healthier than chocolate or biscuits but our research shows this can be a myth.” With high levels of sugar and saturated fat in some of these products they should be on the sweet counter, not marketed as health foods.
<br />Furthermore, manufacturers need to be much clearer about how much sugar, fat and calories are loaded into each bar so people can make an informed choice. We want all foods to have the traffic light color coding system so people can see easily what they’re eating and giving to their children.
<br /><br />A spokeswoman for Kellogg’s, which makes the Nutri-Grain Elevenses bar, said: ”We’re confused as to why anyone would call a Nutri-Grain Elevenses snack a cereal bar. If you’ve eaten one you know it’s not. It’s a baked bar and looks and eats much more like a muffin or cake. We bake it like a cake and market it as a mid-morning snack.
<br /><br />”In fact compared to other similar mid-morning snacks, it’s one of the choices that have slightly less sugar than the norm.”

<br /><br />Opening a bank account in Barcelona is an easy process. You can either open a bank account immediately, before permits and registration is organised – in which case you will have a non-resident bank account – or wait until you are a registered resident, when you will be able to open a resident account. Even if you open a non-resident account, change this to a resident account as soon as you can to avoid high bank charges.
<br /><br />All you need to open a resident bank account is your NIE number (numero de identificacion de extranjero or foreigners’ identification number). Many bank workers speak English, so it may be worth checking that you can communicate with at least one member of staff, or even better the manager, before choosing the bank and branch in which to open your account.
<br /><br />Many websites of Spanish banks can also be read and navigated in English, making online banking, bill payments, transfers and even international transfers, very easy to do yourself.
<br />The following major Spanish banks have English websites:
<br /><br />BBVA <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbva.es"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.bbva.es</a>
<br />Bankinter <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bankinter.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.bankinter.com</a>
<br />Grupo Banco Popular <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bancopopular.es"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.bancopopular.es</a>
<br />Other major banks include Banco Santander and La Caixa. Your choice of bank may depend on its convenience for home and work, and availability of English speakers. Take a look at the websites for their ease of use too.
<br /><br />Spain also has a network of local savings banks, which provide the same services as regular clearing banks but have a more obvious social responsibility presence within the area. The local savings bank for Barcelona is the Caixa Catalunya.
<br /><br />There are three main ATM networks in Spain, Telebanco 4B, ServiRed and Euro 6000 and most ATM’s allow you to change the language so instructions and requests are easier. Make sure your bank is a member of the network that you see most commonly around where you live and shop, as you will be charged for withdrawing money from a network that your bank does not belong to. Telebanco 4B is the most popular with the largest number of ATMs, followed by ServiRed and then the Euro 6000 network of savings banks.
<br /><br />Opening hours of banks in Spain are short, only mornings until 2pm in the summer (May to October), and then an additional one evening per week or a Saturday morning. It may be possible to find a bank situated in a large shopping centre that opens late all weekdays. This is very useful to sort out any problems outside usual working hours.
<br />Most international banks are represented in Barcelona and the surrounding areas. Barclays has several branches Avenida Diagonal, 419, and Pg Gracia, 45. Citibank also has branches at Rbla Catalunya, 12 and Via Augusta, 128-132. Dutch international online bank ING also operates current accounts in Spain through its website<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ingdirect.es"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.ingdirect.es</a>.
<br /><br />Although most current accounts are issued with a cheque book, these are very rarely used in Spain; most shops and restaurants don’t accept them, preferring cash, debit or credit cards. It is also difficult to use foreign debit and credit cards that use the chip and pin system, as this does not yet operate in Spain. It is also advised to keep your bank account in your home country open for return visits.

<br /><br />Because of the growing demand, Enterprises now want executives who can secure deals with local businesses and governments without the aid of a translator and even an individual to be paid-off and who understand that sitting through a three-hour dinner banquet is often a key part of the negotiating process around the world. These are just the statements in which the Tyler Group holds onto and one of the reasons why we set realizations over and done with lining a rope of business updates, travel and tours, financial and legal services particularly in Barcelona for everyone's feat and mostly for Global expat connections.

<br /><br />Bradley spoken with thousands of men and women about their finances, after a while, patterns emerge in differences between the genders with regards to money. This includes how they viewed money, how they managed money, and most of all how they wanted to learn about money.
<br />It might be taking too many conclusions based on these experiences, but then Bradley Associates came across a recent study on the gender gap in financial literacy that supports the following findings.
<br />A study from Financial Finesse found that a company that provides workplace financial wellness services, women are falling behind men in several areas of financial planning. This gap is noticeably growing with regards to paying off debt, arming an emergency fund with a few months’ living expenses, and having basic stock, bond, and mutual fund knowledge. This basically implies that there is no gender gap with respect to longer-term planning. It is the fundamentals of financial management where women are coming up shortly. Let’s take the statements below for you to understand why.
<br />• Women want peace of mind: For women, financial peace of mind is the ultimate personal finance goal. Women want a secure and sound financial future for themselves and their families, and they view their investments as a way to support and protect their loved ones. Surveys — and my personal experiences as a financial advisor — show men are typically more interested in wealth accumulation.
<br />• Women want time to research their options: Women are deliberate decision-makers and take their time doing research. Women prefer gathering information from a vast group of experts before taking action and initiating a plan. Women also prefer thinking through and planning for “devil’s advocate” and “what if” scenarios to help protect them against the unexpected.
<br />• Women want an ally, not a bossy know-it-all: Education, collaboration, and patience are critically important to women. If a woman feels condescended to or the environment does not foster question-asking, then she’ll disengage from the dialogue. A woman needs to feel the financial educator is an empowering ally, not a rival. Whereas men typically want the facts and information to make investing decisions on their own, women prefer a collaborative, nurturing environment.
<br />Here’s how you can take matters into your own hands.
<br />•Educate yourself.Look for an investing class at a local community center or college. Many of them are free or very low cost. Join an investment club. Ask your daughter, sister, mother, or friend to attend with you. Have fun with it.
<br />•Make the most of the savings tools available to you at your workplace or if you are self-employed.
<br />•If your spouse or partner handles the money, call a family finance meeting. Ask that individual to teach you what s/he does. Find out how the budget looks, bills are paid, household cash is managed, and investments are monitored. After you understand, take your turn. You don’t have to do it forever, but you should know how. You may even enjoy it and improve your family’s finances.
<br />•If you choose to get professional financial help, interview prospective financial advisors. If the advisor won’t take the time to listen, get to know your needs, and explain concepts to you clearly and simply, then feel free to walk out and don’t look back. Find an advisor who speaks your language at your pace.

<br /><br />BP announced today that it is beginning the next stage in the process, required under the TNK-BP shareholder agreement, regarding the potential sale of its shareholding in TNK-BP. 
<br /><br />This follows the decision of Alfa Access-Renova to exercise its right to enter a period of negotiation to purchase part/ all of BP’s 50 per cent share in TNK-BP. As a result BP will tomorrow enter into a 90-day period of “good faith” negotiations with Alfa Access-Renova as required by the TNK-BP shareholder agreement. 
<br /><br />BP is also able to and will enter into negotiations with other interested parties in parallel for the sale of its share in TNK-BP. 
<br /><br />There can be no guarantee that any transaction will take place. 
<br /><br />A further announcement will be made when and if appropriate.
<br />Notes to editors:
<br />TNK-BP is a leading Russian oil company, owned equally by BP and Alfa Access Renova. The company was formed in 2003 as the result of the merger of BP’s Russian oil and gas assets and the oil and gas assets of Alfa Access Renova.
<br />TNK-BP is vertically integrated with a diversified upstream and downstream portfolio in Russia and Ukraine and international interests in Brazil, Venezuela and Vietnam.

<br /><br />BP America, Inc. announced today it will donate $1 million to support disaster relief efforts in Louisiana and Mississippi following Hurricane Isaac. 
<br /><br />The donation will be made to the American Red Cross and The Salvation Army and divided equally between the two hardest-hit states. 
<br /><br />“This assistance cannot fix all that has been broken by this natural disaster, but we hope it can help some of those in need today and contribute to a sustained recovery effort in the months ahead,” said Crystal E. Ashby, Executive Vice President of Government and Public Affairs for BP America. 
<br /><br />The storm forced BP to evacuate workers from offshore platforms and drilling rigs in the Gulf of Mexico, as well as from onshore facilities in south Louisiana and Mississippi, where hundreds of BP employees live. 
<br /><br />Separate from this donation, BP is also providing assistance to our employees and their families in the region.

<br /><br />The Tyler Group outlines the location for a local Barcelona tourist office in the city and gives you a little information on how each office can help you.
<br /><br />There are 5 main Barcelona Tourist board offices in the city. There are also some other minor offices e.g. in Barcelona Sants station but the main ones are covered below.
<br />Main Barcelona tourist office in (or rather under) Plaça Catalunya Square
<br />Barcelona tourist office at Catalunya square central Barcelona
<br />Metro: Catalunya (Green Line, L3) and (Red Line, L1)
<br />Address: Plaça de Catalunya, 17
<br />08002 Barcelona, España
<br />Open: 08:30 – 20:30
<br />Closed: 01 January and 25 December
<br /><br />Tel:   +34 93 285 3834
<br />Services. This office is the main tourist board office in Barcelona and can help you with many essentials e.g. finding accommodation, booking the Barcelona Bus Turistic (open air bus tour), city maps, bus and transport information and other general tourist information questions. This Barcelona tourist info office also has a gift shop with an extensive range of quality souvenirs for your visit to Barcelona.
<br /><br />The Tyler Group TIP
<br />Tourists often have difficulties finding the Catalunya tourist office – even though it’s the biggest tourist office in Barcelona and it’s on the busiest square in Barcelona. Why? Because it’s actually underground! The way to find it is first to find the El Cortes Ingles (the large shopping complex) the tourist office is close but actually under the Catalunya Square near the fountain. Look for the large pillars with an ” I ” at the top. These pillars are just outside the tourist office. There are two entrances to the Barcelona tourist office – each pillar marks an entrance.
<br /><br />Columbus Monument Tourist Office
<br />Address: Pl. Portal de la Pau (near the Columbus monument)
<br />Metro: Drassanes (Green Line, L3)
<br />Open: 08:30 – 19:30
<br />Closed: 01 January and 25 December
<br />Not as comprehensive a service as the other 2 main Barcelona tourist information offices given above. Mainly supplying leaflets, port information and information on cultural attractions. Barcelona Bus Turistic and Barcelona card enquiries can also be made here however they do not provide an accommodation booking service unlike the other two offices above.
<br />Barcelona Tourist Office – Cultural events in Barcelona (Oficina d’ informacio cultural)
<br />Address: Las Ramblas, 99 08002 Barcelona, España
<br />Metro: Liceu (Green Line, L3)
<br />Tel:  +34 93 316 1000
<br />Open: Monday – Sunday: 10:00 – 20:00
<br />This Barcelona tourist board office is somewhat different from the others. It does not offer any advice on accommodation, tourist attractions or tours. Its sole purpose is to provide you with comprehensive information on Barcelona Cultural activities. If you attempt to ask them questions on anything other than cultural activities and events they will direct you to the Catalunya tourist office which is the nearest main tourist board office from them.
<br /><br />Barcelona Airport Tourist Office Information
<br />There are two Catalunya Tourist information offices at Barcelona airport. They are situated at T1 and T2B. They deal with all general tourist information questions.
<br />Airport Terminals T1 and T2B Tourist offices
<br />Open: 09:00 – 21:00
<br />Closed: 25 December and 01 January
<br /><br />Tourist Office for the Regional Government of Catalonia
