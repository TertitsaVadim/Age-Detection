<br /><br />Would you be surprised to learn that maritime attorneys who have spent their careers advocating for injured maritime workers have all reached the same conclusion? The conclusion is the shocking answer to the question of what an injured maritime worker's greatest fear is. And that answer has little to do with doctors and recovery times, the answer is simply that injured maritime workers are afraid of being blackballed by the maritime industry.Why you could need to file a maritime injury claim? To address the concern of being blackballed or blacklisted, we need to first take a look at why you might need to pursue an injury claim. When you are hurt offshore, you could quickly find yourself in a situation where you have growing medical bills, little income and an uncertain future. Some injuries turn out to be permanent, barring you from continuing your career as an offshore worker. The thing you need to understand about a maritime injury is that you may not know the full extent of damage or how it will impact your life. &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.minibootsaleuk.com%2Fugg-roxy-tall-boots-red-p-309.html%26quot%3B%26gt%3Bred"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.minibootsaleuk.com/ugg-roxy-tall-boots-red-p-309.html&quot;&gt;red</a> ugg boots australia&lt;/a&gt; As a result, it may be critical to pursue an injury claim, as it may be the only way to be sure that you and your family are protected financially. A successful maritime accident case could entitle you to:&amp;bull; Lost wages - both past and future  &amp;bull; Medical expenses - both past and future &amp;bull; Disfigurement &amp;bull; Pain and suffering  &amp;bull; Mental anguish  &amp;bull; Other damagesAre you at risk of being blackballed within the &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.minibootsaleuk.com%2Fugg-roxy-tall-boots-chocolat-p-307.html%26quot%3B%26gt%3Bsandy"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.minibootsaleuk.com/ugg-roxy-tall-boots-chocolat-p-307.html&quot;&gt;sandy</a> roxy ugg boots&lt;/a&gt; maritime industry? Even with the severity of their injuries, many offshore workers are hesitant to take action against their employers. If you fall into this group, it is important that you understand who truly is at risk of being blackballed and who is not. From the experience of our maritime attorneys, the workers who &lt;a &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.minibootsaleuk.com%2Fugg-adirondack-tall-boots-chocolate-p-319.html%26quot%3B%26gt%3Bugg"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.minibootsaleuk.com/ugg-adirondack-tall-boots-chocolate-p-319.html&quot;&gt;ugg</a> adirondack boots&lt;/a&gt; href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.minibootsaleuk.com%2Fugg-classic-argyle-knit-boots-purple-p-245.html%26quot%3B%26gt%3Bpurple"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.minibootsaleuk.com/ugg-classic-argyle-knit-boots-purple-p-245.html&quot;&gt;purple</a> boots Australia&lt;/a&gt; are sometimes shunned from the industry are those who:&amp;bull; Have a history of filing frivolous lawsuits: These are workers who file baseless lawsuits wasting the time and money of all parties involved. So you can understand why many offshore employers are reluctant to hire these types of individuals.  &amp;bull; Have filed 6 to 7 lawsuits during their careers: If you have been hurt offshore due to negligence or an unseaworthy vessel, you may have the right to obtain compensation. However, not every injury is grounds for legal action. Repeatedly filing numerous lawsuits over the course of your career could be grounds for blackballing.Blackballing doesn't happen to everyone. If you feel that you have a legitimate offshore injury claim, you should talk with an experienced maritime lawyer. A maritime attorney will be able to review the details of your case and explain your best course of action.

Now you can have what you want without missing a payment on a bill, and still be fashionable while keeping your finances steady.Staying up-to-date with the latest trends in fashion can be very harmful to your wallet. The more expensive something is, the more it seems that it's something you ought to have. And right now, everyone seems to be wearing bape shoes, or bathing ape shoes.

The odds were against him. He was an old man, in failing health, his work as a songsmith and recording artist mostly forgotten. When he died in 1960, there was no Country Music Hall of Fame, and rockabilly was all the rage. The only way you could hear the Carter Family was on 78 rpm records, which most major com- panies had stopped making by that time.
<br />    Only ten years later, record bins everywhere had Carter Fam- ily LP reissues from RCA, Columbia, and Decca. Scholars were tracing the sources of Carter Family songs, and one learned group searched out and issued a selection of their rare radio transcriptions, with annotations and exhaustive commentary. A. P. Carter, they said, was &quot;one of the makers of modern Curious as the results of their 1931 Louisville sessions may seem, there's little reason to question Ralph Peer's decision to pair the Carter Family with Jimmie Rodgers. They were, after all, the two most successful and best known acts in what was just then emerging as &quot;hillbilly music.&quot; On the other hand, aside from the fact that they all played stringed instruments and per- formed songs that were old, or sounded old, America's Blue Yodeler and the Patron Saints of Traditional Music had surpris- ingly little in common.

<br />  The Nashville Sound was successful. Record sales achieved a life-saving level quite quickly and rose steadily to respectable and even healthy proportions over the next fifteen years. But the dream of full assimilation, economic and social equality with the Tony Bennetts and Andy Williamses of this world, proved elu- sive.
<br />    One bottom line, it seems in retrospect, is that the whole idea didn't have much potential to begin with; the primary demo- graphic target of Nashville Sound music, eventually defined to a tee by producer Billy Sherrill as &quot;the housewife washing dishes at 10 A.M. in Topeka, Kansas,&quot; just didn't buy many records. Another is that in the same way the rock 'n' roll kids had been able to tell a genuine hepcat from a possum in tiger-striped sharkskin, that housewife knew that no Nashville smoothie-not
<br />one of them in the long line from Gentleman Jim Reeves to Roger Miller to Charlie Rich, the Silver Fox-would ever golf regularly with Mel Torme. The image was a fake.
<br />  The image also made industry personnel uncomfortable, for throughout the Nashville Sound era, which lasted well into the1970s, there was in country music a constant feeling of walking on eggshells.
<br />   On the social front, this feeling was apparent in the industry's exaggerated concern with its image in Nashville itself. Prior to this period of attempted sophistication, the disdain in which the social elite of &quot;The Athens of the South&quot; held the white-trash music business in their midst had never been much more than vaguely irritating. Now it mattered a lot. It really hurt the exec- utives of the country recording industry that while the nation at

In1957, Nudie reached the height (.or depth) of excess when, for $10,000, he designed a twenty-five-carat gold lame tuxedo f'or Elvis Presley. By the late 1950s, the thinestone Nudie suit had become synonymous with steel guitars. But within a few years, as country labored to acquire a sophistic:ated look to go with its smooth Nashville Sound, coun- try costumes toned down; dinner jac:kets and formals replaced the thinestones. During the 1970s, the country image changed yet again as Waylon, Willie, and the Outlaws donned T-shirts and blue jeans, just like rock stars of' the day.  Today, with the return to musi styles of the forties and fifties led b  artists like Emmylou Harris, Dwighr Yoakam, and Randy Travis, the cos- tumes are beginning to sparkle again.

<br />workers wore no helmets or goggles and many cutting machines had no safety shields. Nonetheless, as Hong told it, the workers had been so deeply moved by &quot;the solicitude and warm care of our Great Leader&quot; that they had erected the monument to his visits.
<br />     Whatever the motive for installing &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.louisvuittonmonogramvernisbags.com%2Fauthentic-louis-vuitton-wallets-outlet-letters-canvas-bags-p-718.html%26quot%3B%26gt%3Blv"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.louisvuittonmonogramvernisbags.com/authentic-louis-vuitton-wallets-outlet-letters-canvas-bags-p-718.html&quot;&gt;lv</a> white purses&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; it, I was impressed by some of the machinery. A lone woman operated a 100-meter-long system for making the tractor's gearbox, peering down from a car riding on rails above. Another lone woman operated the console that controlled the engine block machin- ing. &quot;Every machine and piece of equipment in the factory was produced in our own country,&quot; Hong said proudly. With a million &quot;intellectuals,&quot; includ- ing engineers, North Koreans &quot;can solve our problems.&quot; Hong noted Kim Il- sung's personal approval of the gearbox-making system: &quot;Our Great Leader said this is one of the great creations.&quot;
<br />    Despite the considerable automation already accomplished in the fac- tory, I thought the tractor assembly line still moved slowly, compared with automotive plants I had visited in other countries. The workers had a lot of waiting-around time on their hands. Officials said the factory produced one hundred. tractors a day, which seemed a low figure considering that this was mass production of just two basic models. Officials obviously agreed: They wanted greater productivity. A colorful sign exhorted workers: &quot;A[l should come out to fulfill the resolutions of the Seventeenth Session of the Fifth Cen- tral Committee of the Workers' Party.&quot; One of the resolutions was pre- dictable: &quot;Produce more!&quot; The sign praised model workers, showing their pictures and describing their feats. One woman &quot;did her job 200 percent.&quot;
<br />      The factory operated six days a week, on two shifts. It wasn't clear how many hours an actual shift might be. Hong, when I asked him about it, replied:&quot;In principle, according to the labor law, we do not allow them to work more than eight hours.&quot; The general rule of thumb, he said, is &quot;eight hours' work, eight hours' study and eight hours' rest.&quot; Overtime work requires &quot;approval from hi8her administrative organs.&quot; Considering the many reports of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.louisvuittonmonogramvernisbags.com%2Flouis-vitton-couguar-black-p-263.html%26quot%3B%26gt%3Blouis"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.louisvuittonmonogramvernisbags.com/louis-vitton-couguar-black-p-263.html&quot;&gt;louis</a> vuitton black&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; all-out work campaigns pushed by higher-ups in the party and government, it &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.louisvuittonmonogramvernisbags.com%2Flv-purses-wallet-c-73.html%26quot%3B%26gt%3BLouis"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.louisvuittonmonogramvernisbags.com/lv-purses-wallet-c-73.html&quot;&gt;Louis</a> Vuitton Purple Patent Zippy Wallet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; was easy to speculate that an eight~hour workday &quot;in principle&quot; could often stretch out longer in reality.
<br />   Retirement ages, Hong said, were sixty for men and fifty-five for women-typical figures for East Asian countries, including Japan, at that time. I asked if many people of retirement a8'e stayed on in the workplace for whatever reason. I hoped the answer would hint at whether there might be pressure to postpone retirement to counter the shortage ofyounger workers. Hong said an occasional person of retirement age would stay on as a part- time &quot;advisor,&quot; drawing both pension and salary. In ~act I had not seen many obviously elderly people working in his tractor factory or elsewhere. If such a practice was actually rare, that might have been one measure of the extent to which Confucianism, with its deference to age, remained a cultural force

They were directly blamed for the basi- cally sleazy Urban Cowboy craze that briefly touched country music. They were probably responsible for the New Traditialists, who responded against the new commercialization of Urban Cowboyism (Nashville Sound as filtered through Gilley's in Pasadena, Texas, and then by the Eagles in California) by returning to a stripped-down, no-frills, back-to-the-basics hard- country music.

We actually had to become more tightly knit than before, rather than opening up.&quot; What do you think about Radio Free Asia?&quot;It's a very good idea.

Once we are unified, we no longer have to use our money to build up our military might. We can use all our re- sources for the betterment of the people's lives.

Right now [October 1994] I'd speculate they're teaching with reference to the North Korea-U.S. talks- maybe somethin8' to the effect that the United States won't give up what we want so we'll still have to advance reunification through force. Each year the New Year's teachings by Kim Il~sung and Kim Jong-il were emphasized.

There's a huge prison in Kyowaso, Yongdam, Kangwon Province. There's a big political prison at Mount Chol, Tong~nim, North Pyongan Province. In fact [that white part of] North Pyongan is all prison camp area. The white part near Pyongyang is Kaechon. That's where I was. In the far northeast, at Hoeryong and Kyongsong are two political prison camps. Hoeryong is No. 13 or 14 and Kyongsong is No. 11. I know that because my son was a prison guard. Looking at the map, probably the places are where they have camps. That's the likely reason for keeping the monitors out.&quot; Would the authorities fear simply that foreigners would see that there are prison camps? Or is the fear that they would see that people are starving in the camps?&quot;There's no way they'll let foreigners in those areas.

To understand part of the reason fo such concern, one had only to recall North Korea's dismay at NATO: Kosovo intervention, which was justified on the basis of human rights.
<br />       In the quest for better foreign relationships, establishment of diplomatii relations with Italy was viewed as a milestone. Previously no members of thi Group of Seven industrialized countries had relations &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.louisvuittonmonogramvernisbags.com%2Fcl-hot-red-c-78.html%26quot%3B%26gt%3Bsupra"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.louisvuittonmonogramvernisbags.com/cl-hot-red-c-78.html&quot;&gt;supra</a> womens skytops grey pink and white in size 10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; with Pyongyang. Aus tralia, the Philippines, France, Taiwan, Japan, even Britain were on the lis of countries that contemplated joining in the diplomatic dance. But with a] the additional diplomatic activity there were few reports of positive results u human rights terms.
<br />  Some analysts worried that, on the contrary, having more polit: government-to-government relationships might be giving the regime addec leverage to do as it pleased with-and to-its own people. After all, outrigh enermes and long-time critics or detractors of a country don't hesitate to con demn &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.louisvuittonmonogramvernisbags.com%2Fauthentic-louis-vuitton-wallets-outlet-letters-canvas-bags-p-718.html%26quot%3B%26gt%3Blv"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.louisvuittonmonogramvernisbags.com/authentic-louis-vuitton-wallets-outlet-letters-canvas-bags-p-718.html&quot;&gt;lv</a> white purses&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; its human rights violations-but countries that are in the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.louisvuittonmonogramvernisbags.com%2Flouis-vuitton-monogram-multicolor-white-handbags-p-231.html%26quot%3B%26gt%3Bbowling"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.louisvuittonmonogramvernisbags.com/louis-vuitton-monogram-multicolor-white-handbags-p-231.html&quot;&gt;bowling</a> montaigne pm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; process o improving diplomatic relations think at least twice before speaking thei minds in such cases.
<br />        John Pomfret of The  Wadbington POdt in a February 19, 2000, article re ported that the situation of North Korean re~ugees in China had worsenet precisely because of Pyoneyang's improved relations with other countries The article quoted a United Nations official who lamented the &quot;total silence with which the international community greeted the forced repatriation o seven North Koreans who had fled to China and thence to Russia. &quot;In mas' parts of the world the Americans would be outraged,&quot; the UN official con tinued. But the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.louisvuittonmonogramvernisbags.com%2Flv-classics-monogram-c-69.html%26quot%3B%26gt%3Blv"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.louisvuittonmonogramvernisbags.com/lv-classics-monogram-c-69.html&quot;&gt;lv</a> handbag women monogram&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; article quoted aid officials as saying foreign (read Ameri can<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/unsure.gif" alt=":)" /> officials' gratitude for progress on weapons issues had made themles' eager to put pressure on North Korea re8'arding refugee issues.
<br />       PyonS;yang had further plans to use diplomacy in ways that could bodf ill for starving or otherwise unsatisfied, or dissatisfied, citizens of'North Ko rea who might wish to vote with their feet. Those plans involved the countD most interested in improved relations, South Korea, whose President Kin Dae-jung was pursuing a &quot;sunshine policy&quot; to try to lure the North into c
<br /> peaceful relationship. South Korean press reports quoted a unification policj
<br /> official in Seoul as saying on February 17, 2000, that North Korea had of. fered Seoul some secret reunions of families divided by the Demilitarizec
<br />  Zone - a hot-button issue in South Korea.  In exchange, though,  Seoul woulc
<br /> have to agree to help Pyongyang deter the defection of North Koreans witl:
<br /> relatives in the South. That category had accounted for a large percentage oi
<br /> successful defections, since the Southern family members were often williry
<br /> to pay for agents to undertake rescue efforts.

My brother taught me a little. But if anyone had offered us help, that person would have gotten in trouble. No one helped. &quot;My uncle on my mother's side was vice~commander of the Second Army Corps. He met the governor of the province and asked him for clemency. 
<br />     The governor arranged for us to be resettled. In 1980, we moved to Maengsan County, 120 kilometers east of Pyongyang, where Mother worked as farm- hand. People who were deemed anti~communists, capitalists or landlords, or who had helped South Korea during the war, were resettled in Maengsan County. Seventy percent of the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mensnikeairmaxshoes.com%2Fnike-air-max-2011-women-c-90.html%26quot%3B%26gt%3Bnike"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.mensnikeairmaxshoes.com/nike-air-max-2011-women-c-90.html&quot;&gt;nike</a> air max footwear 2011&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; people there are like us.

The soil was poor. Transportation was poor. It was in remote mountain terrain. The nearest train station was 30 kilometers and the way to get there was on foot.  &quot;Every time I start talking about the past I just start crying,&quot; Bae said. &quot;I don't recall any good experiences. When I was in semor middle school, my only hope was that some day I could enter the army. I had no hope of goingto a university.
<br />      But by the time of graduation,  I realized that I could not even enter the army because of my father's status. So I had lost all hope in life. North Korea should be called the Feudal State of Korea. It's like during the Yi Dynasty, when it was the yangban [nobles] against the ordinary people. We started bribing authorities and I was allowed to go to Maengsan County automotive school, where I learned to drive. I went to work driving a truck for a truck-and-driver-hire organization. I did that from 1988 to May 1993.

The head of one foundation dedi- cated to medical and food aid for North Koreans traveled through the country a couple of months a~ter Finance Minister Mun's speech. Compared with what he had seen on earlier trips, the aid organizer found that the lives of orclinary people remained &quot;difficult almost beyond description.&quot; Starting with the years of most acute famine, &quot;North Koreans have had to turn to in- formal coping mechanisms,&quot; he told a U.S. congressional committee. But an
<br /> illustration he offered could just as well have been taken as an omen of change for the better. &quot;Even individuals who work in government ministries rely on
<br /> outside sources of income to acquire the goods and services they need for their families,&quot; he said, reporting that &quot;the North Korean economy has slowly
<br /> improved over the past few years,&quot; thanks mainly to &quot;the informal economy.&quot;
<br /> He told how informal coping mechanisms, including produce from private
<br /> plots and farmers' markets, had &quot;halted North Korea's precipitous econormc
<br /> slide toward oblivion.&quot;But the foundation chief still found the country unable &quot;to move beyond an 'informal economy' on the macro level.&quot; Missing, he said, was &quot;the struc- tural reform needed to promote  legitimate  international trade. . . .

At the very least, North Korea was displaying that sense of bustk
<br /> that I had found so lacking by comparison with &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mensnikeairmaxshoes.com%2Fnike-air-max-95-men-c-76.html%26quot%3B%26gt%3Bair"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.mensnikeairmaxshoes.com/nike-air-max-95-men-c-76.html&quot;&gt;air</a> max store 95&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; China in earlier decades.

This has set capacity ~ree, but at the same time there is a growing need to support people who have difficulties in coping with these changes.

Meanwhile fine-tuning of the new econonuc measures pro- ceeded. The original 2002 devaluation of the won had not sufficed to attract people to the official moneychangers. In the summer of 2003 the rate report- edly was adjusted to match the black market rate.lo
