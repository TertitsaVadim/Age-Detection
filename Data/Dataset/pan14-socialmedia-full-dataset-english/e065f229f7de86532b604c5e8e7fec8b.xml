My globe seemed peaceful and I was filled with exhilaration. It was a very good day.<br /><br />Yes, the day before yesterday was the type of day I usually like to see. There are many such days. Sunny, warm days, regardless of whether because of the weather or simply because of the warmth in our hearts are often pleasant.<br /><br />But yesterday was completely distinct.

I turned on the laptop and the screen remained blank. I couldn't get through to anybody on the telephone. By late afternoon, I leaned back in my chair and sighed. Yes, yesterday was not a really good day.<br /><br />These days is far better than yesterday, but not rather as excellent as the day prior to. At least, not yet, anyway. You see, it's still morning.

So will the good days also. They each will pass. Nothing stays the identical.<br /><br />All items alter. The seasons of the year as well as the seasons of our lives preserve changing. It is the law of the universe. So enjoy great days although they last. And the not-so- great days? Tolerate them. They will not last, either.<br /><br />An old Chinese proverb says, &quot;You cannot stop the birds from flying more than your head but you surely can stop them from producing nests in your hair.&quot; Don't let a undesirable day maintain you from seeking forward to great ones.<br /><br />Live life one day at a time. The Universe will sustain you. You do your component and the Universal Forces will usually do theirs. You are as valid and as beneficial as any person else in the planet. Hold on keeping on. To modify the words of U.S. president, John F. Kennedy, &quot;Ask not what this day will bring to you. Rather, ask what you will bring to this day.&quot;<br /><br />May possibly your day be filled with all good issues.
