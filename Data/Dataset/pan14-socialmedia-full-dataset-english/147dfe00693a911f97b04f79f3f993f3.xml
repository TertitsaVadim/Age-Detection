<br />Girl: &quot;Can we do what?&quot;
<br />Guy: &quot;You know, can I be your first, finally?&quot;
<br />Girl: &quot;Um.....no.&quot;
<br />Guy: &quot;Why?&quot;
<br />Girl: &quot;Because, 1. you have a girlfriend, who happens to be my friend.......&quot;
<br />Guy: &quot;So, if you don't tell, I won't tell.&quot;
<br />Girl: &quot;Besides that, I'm waiting for someone special. Someone that I want to be with for the rest of my life to be my first.&quot;
<br />Guy: &quot;I'm not special to you?&quot;
<br />Girl: &quot;You're my friend. That's all.&quot;
<br />Guy looks forward and keeps driving. 5 minutes pass....... Guy starts to run his hand up the girl's thigh.
<br />Girl: moves his hand, &quot;Don't touch me!&quot;
<br />Guy: tries to kiss her.
<br />Girl: screams, &quot;Would you stop.&quot;
<br />Guy: continues trying.
<br />Girl: moves to the back seat
<br />Guy: parks on an abandoned street and gets in the backseat with the girl
<br />Starts to kiss her..
<br />Girl: pushes him off and scoots over, &quot;Please, don't do this.&quot;
<br />Guy: &quot;Don't do what, I know you want it, I can see it in your eyes.&quot;
<br />Moves over to her and starts to unbutton her pants.
<br />Girl: pushes him harder and says, &quot;No, don't.&quot;
<br />Guy: getting aggravated, punches her and tells her to stop &quot;playing hard to get&quot;.
<br />Girl: crying, continues to fight.
<br />Guy: punches her harder, pulls her pants off, and holds her down.
<br />Girl: screams as he penetrates her, &quot;NO, please don't do this to me!&quot;
<br />Guy: puts his hand over her mouth.
<br />An hour passes.........
<br />Guy: pulls back and wipes himself off.
<br />Girl: sits on the corner of the seat, sobbing.
<br />Guy: looks at her and says, &quot;You better not tell anybody about this. If you're really my friend, you won't tell anybody. You know I love you.&quot; He reaches out his hand to touch her cheek.
<br />Girl: pulls back, &quot;Just take me home, now.&quot;
<br />Guy: says, &quot;Alright.&quot; Gets in the front seat and drives her home.
<br />2 months later.........
<br />Girl: &quot;Doctor, what's wrong with me. I haven't had my time of the month in 2 months.&quot;
<br />Doctor: looks at her, &quot;You haven't been having your &quot;time&quot; for a reason.&quot;
<br />Girl: looks at him and says, &quot;Why?&quot; dreading the answer that she was sure to receive.
<br />Doctor: &quot;You are pregnant.&quot;
<br />Girl: faints.
<br /><br />The story gets out that she is pregnant, and people start looking to the guy. He claims that it isn't his because she was sleeping with every guy in the school(which was a lie). He goes to her and tells her, &quot;I'm telling you, if you lie to people and say that I raped you, I'll kill you.&quot;
<br /><br />The Girl is completely devastated. First, he took her virginity and got her pregnant....then he lied about it. So completely depressed......the girl commits suicide by drug overdose.......
<br />Girls, if this story touched you, repost it as &quot;That's Fucked up&quot;
<br />Guys, if this story touched you, repost it as &quot;I'll kill any fucker who does this&quot; if you care

<br />Images of my fist going into that face over and over.
<br />Seeing the bloody mess that used to be the bitches face.
<br />However ugly she was, she looks much better now.
<br />I can feel the ghostly joy from the visions as I release my rage.
<br />Picturing the mess it has created.
<br />And I hunger for more, like a drug addiction.
<br />Use it once and you can become hooked instantly.
<br />There is no more holding back so I relinquish control.
<br />Racing through me like a raging storm finally free.
<br />Even though these images I see,
<br />As enticing as they may be.
<br />Somehow I control it, somehow swallowing it back down.
<br />As much as I want to, nothing is what I'll do
<br />For now...

<br />Is how I become free.
<br />Nothing is how I wish it seems,
<br />I wish my dreams would merge with reality.
<br /><br />I search my heart,
<br />To decipher thoughts inside my head.
<br />With nowhere to start,
<br />My heart now full of lead.
<br /><br />My body aches from my mistakes,
<br />Always betrayed by lust.
<br />Never realised how much it takes,
<br />Now in nothing I trust.

<br />Enshrouded in my emotions.
<br />Wondering how so many people can be so heartless,
<br />Confused with all of loves commotions.
<br /><br />I try to understand love,
<br />Knowing  that it is just like a rose.
<br />Realising it isn't always as pure as a dove,
<br />But will eventually die as does a rose.
<br /><br />Never before have I felt such pain,
<br />Never before have I felt so lost.
<br />Once again my heart has been slain,
<br />Now I know what love does cost.
<br /><br />Tormented by these dreams.
<br />By these haunting nightmares,
<br />Where nothing is what it seems.
<br />In love and nobody cares.

<br />Takes your dreams,

<br /><br />I try to sweep away the past,

<br />Flying like a lonely angel,

<br /><br />I grow weary of this petty existance.
<br />I start resenting the living.
<br />And wish I could walk along the plains of death.
<br />I see him there in the distance,
<br />I see Death Waiting, waiting for me.
<br />Luring me in with promises of suffering relieved.
<br />No more pain, no more sorrow he whispers.
<br />Slowly I begin the journey along Death's path.
<br />Lusting after the sweet release only he can deliver.
<br />Into his arms and to the gates I flee.
<br />Only to stop at someone's heart felt plea.
<br />I turn back to look at from whom it came...
<br />She runs to me, pleading for me not to go.
<br />I stand rooted in place in front of Death's gate.
<br />One more step and I can be free and without pain.
<br />I can't move because of her, because I love her
<br />But thats why I must depart.
<br />I try to voice to her why but the words wont come out.
<br />She begs me to stay and I move back.
<br />But Death whispers of sweet things I recieve only with him.
<br />My compulsion towards Death begins to sway.
<br />Seeing the hurt in her eyes make me start wanting to live,
<br />Just so she would hurt no more.
<br />She begs me to stay, states that she loves me.
<br />I want to but know I can't, it would destroy me further.
<br />Turning my back on the love of my life, I begin again.
<br />In front of Death's gates I stop and turn once more.
<br />Only to whisper four short words to her
<br />&quot;I'm sorry, my love...&quot;
<br />I turn again and stirde through Death's gates.
<br />To be unbound from the chains which tied me to life...

<br />u.....you're
<br />heartless...for sure
<br /><br />One night a guy &amp; a girl were driving
<br />home from the movies. The boy sensed
<br />there was something wrong because of
<br />the painful silence they shared
<br />between them that night. The girl then
<br />asked the boy to pull over because she
<br />wanted to talk. She told him that her
<br />feelings had changed &amp; that it was
<br />time to move on. A silent tear slid
<br />down his cheek as he slowly reached
<br />into his pocket &amp; passed her a folded
<br />note. At that moment, a drunk driver
<br />was speeding down that very same
<br />street. He swerved right into the
<br />drivers seat, killing the boy.
<br />Miraculously, the girl survived.
<br />Remembering the note, she pulled it
<br />out &amp; read it.
<br />&quot;Without your love, I would die.&quot;
