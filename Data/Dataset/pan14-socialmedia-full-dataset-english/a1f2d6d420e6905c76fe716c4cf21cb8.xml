<br /><br />The diversity among Peter Max's art has made him one of the most famous and celebrity modern artists. Max's highly varied artistic history includes a number of different subject material, mediums, and historical contexts. While Peter Max art runs the gamut, his work has several permanently defining features that help juxtapose his diversity and still give him a signature as an artist. Despite what medium, what time period, and what subject a Max work is from it is easily recognizable for art collectors and art critics alike as a Peter Max piece. This signature has helped him be successful in multiple modes and has yielded his reputation as an extremely diverse artist.
<br /><br />His diversity is perhaps best epitomized by his varying roles as an artist during different time periods. Max began the poster craze of the 1960s. With his psychedelic posters in vibrant colors, he became the father of the countercultural movement of the time. While his early art represented the psyche of the 1960s, his later art would go on take on a much different role within pop culture. Much of Peter Max's work during the 1980s, 90s, and 2000s was known for its patriotism. The Liberty Head series are among the most famous of All <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5vcmlnaW5hbGFydGJyb2tlci5jb20vcGV0ZXItbWF4LWFydC1vcmlnaW5hbC1jYW52YXMtbWl4ZWQtbWVkaWEuaHRtbA__" target="_blank">Peter Max Paintings</a>. Max's original art pieces including 44 Obamas and 100 Clintons also demonstrate his art's new patriotic tone. Perhaps most indicative of his patriotic art were the revolutionary portraits he painted after the September Eleventh attacks of every fire fighter who lost their life. It was not only the subject matter that varied through this dramatic change in Peter Max art, but it was also the emphasis. Peter Max's 1960 psychedelic poster work was focused on the future and space, things larger than himself. His later art of the 1980s and on emphasized more tangible qualities and the way things are in the present. Max's original art also progressed in medium as he grew as an artist. He combined his print making experience with his painting experience to make a significant contribution of original art known under the &quot;mixed media&quot; category since it combines different artistic mediums into one.
<br /><br />Today, while much of his artwork continues with his patriotic focus, he has also focused on pursuing new interests in his work. As the world's most notable pop artist, he has stayed true to his name in recent years through <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5vcmlnaW5hbGFydGJyb2tlci5jb20v" target="_blank">Original Artwork</a> capturing famous people and events. The most famous of these include his paintings of Taylor Swift, Willie Nelson, Shaquille O'Neil, the 1994 FIFA World Cup, and the Super bowl. His interest in World Peace and the environment has been revealed in famous Peter Max art including his famous Without Border and Day Dream.
<br /><br />His artwork has changed dramatically over the course of his dynamic career. However, he has become and remains so famous because no matter how often or how significantly his work changes, it is still always iconic Peter Max. The ability for Max to make his work recognizable has created the artistic identity that he has held. His use of vivid colors, bold yet fluid lines carefully used and spaced apart all give him an artistic style that has outlasted the changes in medium, subject, focus, and time. His subject matter is also always positive, upbeat, and optimistic. Even if what he is painting and how he is panting changes, Peter Max art remains iconic and true to the ever true to the reputation as the pop artist he has become.

<br /><br />Erte bronze sculptures, paintings, and other famous artwork have come to represent an artist, a style, and two distinct periods in American history.  Considered the founder of the art deco movement and the 1920 and 1930s and the father of the art deco resurgence of the 1960s, Erte art experienced two distinct periods of widespread critical acclaim and public appreciation.  Famous for his iconic drawings, paintings, etchings, prints, and bronze sculptures, Erte was a master of many mediums. 
<br /><br />One of Erte’s most famous works is his Arctic Sea.  This image was captured as a famous Erte painting as well as a bronze sculpture.  It depicts a beautiful woman standing with her lower body draped in a cloak that appears to be a wave.  On her head is the tip of the wave to one side is an extravagant head piece that appears jeweled.  Its position and shape harkens images of a sail.  The woman’s neck is draped in beautiful necklace.  In images where her face can be seen, she has a serious, stern expression.  
<br /><br />Erte’s Arctic Sea is so famous because it clearly shows the roots of Erte’s fashion design background.  Erte’s work in fashion launched his artistic career.  The artist began working with Harper’s Bazaar magazine in 1913.  During his career, he designed over 240 covers and also worked with other popular magazines of the times including Vogue and Cosmopolitan. He went on to create costumes for Broadway actresses and dancers.  His fashion sensibility, known as art deco, went on to influence fashion, art, and architecture.  It defined the year in which he first began his career, and later came into popularity again through an art deco resurgence movement in the 1960s lead by the artist himself.  The way the woman in Erte’s famous image Arctic Sea is pictured captures this art deco style and design sensibility perfectly.  The way she holds the draped fabric over her lower body like a wave and the use of her extravagant headpiece as a sail shows that <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5vcmlnaW5hbGFydGJyb2tlci5jb20vZXJ0ZS5odG1s" target="_blank">Erte</a> is confident in his ability to manipulate fashion and design for his desired artistic outcome.  The long lines and beautiful fashion element highlight the artistry that defined Erte throughout his long career. 
<br /><br />Arctic Sea’s popularity is perhaps catapulted because it was an image that resurfaced throughout Erte’s career.  Appearing first in 1925 in an Erte Painting, the image would be reproduced in other paintings, sculptures, and prints throughout his prolific career.  The last incarnation was in an Erte bronze sculpture created in 1988, two years prior to the artist’s death. 
<br /><br />Erte’s Artic Sea has become so iconic because it is quintessentially Erte. It defines the artist and his career.  The widespread use of the image throughout his career, from the early stages to near his death, shows that it serves as a symbol he kept coming back to.  It’s use in many forms, for Erte paintings to prints to paintings also shows the wide range the artist had.  It also perfectly captures Erte’s background in fashion and the art deco style for which he is famous for creating.   Because of this, Erte’s <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5vcmlnaW5hbGFydGJyb2tlci5jb20vZXJ0ZS9vcmlnaW5hbF9wYWludGluZ3MvYXJjdGljX3NlYS84MTYuaHRtbA__" target="_blank">Arctic Sea</a>  has become a perfect representation of the artist and has gone on to become one of his most popular works as a result.

<br />Robert Wyland is without question the pre-eminent modern marine artist, and he may very well be the most famous and recognized marine artist of all time. But beyond just creating beautiful works of art, Wyland is famous for his environmental awareness and ability to raise awareness among others that his artwork touches.
<br /><br />Robert Wyland grew up painting from an early age. While his young obsession was dinosaurs, he soon became heavily influenced by Jaques Coustea, a scientist who studied, researched, and photographer marine life. These interests lead him to begin painting marine life himself. Wyland majored in sculpting and painting in school.

His art delivers a direct and very lift like quality. All of his art has a tranquil, serene quality. His most famous work of all are his large scale outdoor murals of whales and other marine life. The largest of these covers the entire Long Beach Convention Center and is 1280 feet long and 105 feet tall. It took over 7000 gallons of paint and each marine creature showcased was painted to actual size. Wyland has painted 100 “Whaling Walls” in over 70 cities in 12 countries and 4 continents around the world. The walls feature life sized whales and are extremely impressive in their detailed life like quality as well as their enormous scale. Wyland painted the final whaling wall in 2008 in front of the Great Wall of China. Impressively, Wyland does not accept compensation for any of his whaling walls. He paints them to get others to appreciate and respect marine life and focus attention on his cause. An experienced SCUBA driver, Wyland draws inspiration for his lifelike work for the up close personal experiences he has had with marine life.
<br /><br />Wyland’s personal passion has been water conservation. The Wyland Foundation helps individuals recognize the importance of keeping our oceans and waterways healthy and safe. It also emphasizes protection watersheds and the preservation and access to healthy water for living. He communicates his foundations efforts primarily through his art, but also through educational outreach and live events.

<br />The famous artist Romain de Titroff, better known by his initials as Erte, was so multi-talented and produced such a wealth of art throughout his long and illustrious career that most people would think it difficult to choose one stand out work of art. In the case of Erte paintings; however, the decision is easy. The most iconic work of Erte art is by far his iconic and generation defining Symphony in Black.
<br /><br />Erte’s classic Symphony in Black showcases a tall, slender woman painted all in black. She has a very Avant Guard hat and fashionable clothing. She holds onto the end of a long leash with a small dog at the end of it. This famous piece of Erte artwork has been reproduced thousands of times. The image was used repeatedly by the artist himself in paintings, prints, and Erte sculptures. It has also been copied and reproduced countless time by other artists and among popular culture.
<br /><br />One of the major reasons Erte’s painting Symphony in Black is so famous is because it so clearly represents the artist’s aesthetic. Erte is considered the father of the Art Deco movement. His art’s aesthetic not only defined his art, but it went on to be symbolic of an entire era. In the 1920, Erte directly influenced culture’s art deco aesthetic through fashion and art, both of which he played a pivotal and era defining role in. He went on to influence movies, popular culture, architecture, design, and many other areas indirectly as well. Symphony in Black is quintessentially art deco in its styling. The painting’s use of all black, long slender lines, and use of negative space, represent of the era’s art deco aesthetic that Erte created.
<br /><br />Another reason for the widespread appreciation for Erte’s artwork Symphony in Black is that it represents the evolution of his artistic career. Beginning in fashion design, making costumes for the theatre and designing covers for Harper’s Bazaar, the viewer can immediately recognize Erte’s artistic roots upon looking at his famous Symphony in Black. The very fashion forward outfit and hat worn by the woman display Erte’s appreciation for fashion. The fact that this image was reproduced over and over again throughout Erte’s career in a multitude of mediums also represents the artist’s history. Erte While <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5vcmlnaW5hbGFydGJyb2tlci5jb20vZXJ0ZS5odG1s" target="_blank">Erte bronze</a> sculptures, paintings, and prints are the most famous today, the artist worked with many mediums including painting, sculpture, photography, print making, fashion design, interior design, along with others. The use of the iconic image from Symphony in Black in so many forms represents Erte’s vast flexibility and skill as an artist.
<br /><br />Finally, Erte’s artwork Symphony in Black is interesting for art critics and collectors because the majority of the image’s use came later in Erte’s career. Not only was Erte famous as the father of art deco, but he also experienced of widespread appreciation during the art deco revival of the 1960s onward, also created by Erte. This nostalgic look back on the art deco perspective of the 1920s and 1930s was largely created be Erte and created a massive resurgence in the popularity of Erte art. Many Symphony in Black renderings were created late in the artist’s career, between 1980 and 1990. 
<br /><br />Erte’s Symphony in Black is considering the defining work of the artist’s career. It’s ability to capture the essence of both Erte, and the generations and aesthetic which he created make it a stand out among a vast body of Erte artwork.

<br />Born Maurice Verrier, the artist often known as <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5vcmlnaW5hbGFydGJyb2tlci5jb20vY2hhcmxlc19sZXZpZXIuaHRtbA__" target="_blank">Charles Levier</a> is most of the most famous in both French and American history. The famous artist signed paintings with both names, and this approach has led to considerable confusion among many scholars. His work under both names is of the same subjects, material, and style, making his signature art easy to identify for the trained critic or collector. Although his heritage was French, he shared his time in France and America throughout his career making a huge impact on the art scene and culture of both nations.
<br /><br />Born in Corsica in 1920, Levier held artistic promise from a young age. At 17, he enrolled at L’Ecole Nationale Superieure des Arts Decoratifs. In his early education, he studied with Andre Lhote and Rouault. However, Levier’s early career was halted due to Levier’s military service for the French Army during World War II, where he served primarily in the North African conflict. His career took off in 1949 when he opened his first one man show in Lyons. He opened his first American show in Los Angeles one year later. He spent significant time in American and France and his art gained fame in both locations. 
<br /><br />Charles Levier was a favorite artist among the pop culture elite in America. The rat pack, including Frank Sinatra, as well as Jackie Kennedy was major collectors of his work. His work referenced earlier French work due to its emphasis on cubism. The same design principles were echoed in the midcentury modern movement in America, making Levier’s art particularly popular during the 1950s and 60s in America. In 1955, the famous gallery owner Dr. Lilienfeld took notice of Levier’s work. Dr. Lilienfeld’s taste was widely respected, and his endorsement of Levier catapulted his art career to a new level. Dr. Lilienfeld was such a strong advocate of Levier’s talent and vision that many art historians consider Charles Levier’s broaden success in American impossible without his support. 
<br /><br />The oil paintings created by Charles Levier vary in subject matter. Most are of city or landscapes or women. They are of both American and French subjects, but the quality of his art is always uniquely French in style. He is considered a figurative painting, and his paintings and both expressionistic and dramatic. Levier used colors to create feelings and perspective within his artwork. He used a range of mediums. While his most famous works are oil paintings, he also used watercolor, acrylic, and other forms of painting. He also did some more abstract work that has gained widespread popularity among collectors, especially in recent years.
<br /><br />Charles Levier’s most famous oil paintings include Camaraque, Fleurs Sur Balcon, Two Nudes, Village Corde, Pair of Young Ladies, and Miss Liberty. Today, Levier’s <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5vcmlnaW5hbGFydGJyb2tlci5jb20v" target="_blank">original art</a> can be seen at the famous Museum of Modern Art and the Menton Museum of Art in Paris, the Atlanta Museum, the Seattle, Museum, the Evansville Museum, the New Orleans Museum, and the San Diego Museum. Charles Levier passed away in 2003, but his famous artwork continues to let his legacy live on.

Although glass blowing in an ancient art with deep historical roots, it was only beginning to become a widely appreciated art medium in modern America at the time Dale Chihuly began studying art. After studding interior design at the University of Washington, Chihuly continued to broaden his artistic horizons by enrolling in the nation’s first glass program at the University of Wisconsin. After that time, he received the prestigious Fulbright scholarship to study glass blowing at the historic Venini factory in Venice, Italy. The Venini factory was groundbreaking because of their team approach to glass blowing where many hands touch a single piece of art. Dale Chihuly’s art went on to encompass this group technique in its implementation. Later in his career, Chihuly was sidelined from the process due to an accident and declining health issues. His incorporation of the team approach to glass blowing early on in his career allowed him to be the mastermind of how the art would come together without blowing any of the glass himself.

Strong cases have been made for many of the obvious candidates of course: Pablo Picasso, Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenschtein, Salvador Dali, and many others. While this is a great company, let us make a case for a less obvious choice: Romain de Tirtoff, or more commonly known as Erte. Erte paintings and sculptures are some of the most iconic in the world today. But beyond the artist’s popularity, he has influenced nearly every aspect of popular culture both by defining a generation through his aesthetic while remaining popular today.
<br /><br />Erte lived from 1892 to 1990 and made an enormous impact on the global art scene during almost the entire duration of his life. He first came onto the scene notably in 1910 when he moved to Paris to become a designer. In 1915, he signed a contracted with the famous Harper’s Bazaar magazine where he would go on to paint over 200 covers. During the same time and into the 1920s and 30s he designed numerous costumes for actresses and opera stars. This <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5vcmlnaW5hbGFydGJyb2tlci5jb20v" target="_blank">original artwork</a> has a direct impact on the aesthetic of the time since ordinary women wanted to emulate the fashions seen on famous celebrities of the time. Erte’s covers and costumes also gained him much notoriety because of their unique style. Many people were fashion designers at the time, but Erte’s style was unique to him. It seemed to capture the essence of the generation and be in line with what they thought was beautiful and fashion forward. Erte is considered the father of the Art Deco movement.
<br /><br />The Art Deco aesthetic created by Erte’s original art would not only be influential in the art and fashion world- it would go on to define the entire generation. His point of view would go on to influence popular culture, architecture, cinema, books, and plays. While one can make a case for any number of twentieth century artists having immense influence over the art world, they are hard pressed to find someone with as much influence over society at large at Erte’s defining role in creating the Art Deco movement.
<br /><br />Many artists have made an impact on popular culture only to fall into the background once a new Avant Guard idea took over in art and society. Since artists and art collectors pride themselves on being on the cutting edge of what’s new it is hard for any individual artist to hold the heart of the community for long. In the 1940s and 1950s, the Art Deco aesthetic faded into the background and began be replaced with how new artistic expressions. Just at the mid-century modern aesthetic would go on to define the 1950s; Art Deco could have easily faded into the background only to become synonymous with the 1920s and 30s without much social relevance past its period based identity. But that was not the case for the Art Deco movement, or for Erte. They both proved their resilience and widespread public appreciation during the Art Deco resurgence of the 1960s. This period allowed the artist to experience a second period of immense popularity. Erte’s resurgence lasted until his death in 1990. In the later portion of his career, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5vcmlnaW5hbGFydGJyb2tlci5jb20vZXJ0ZS5odG1s" target="_blank">Erte bronze</a> sculptures and Erte paintings became his most popular mediums. Today, Erte sculptures and paintings remain more popular than ever. The Art Deco movement created by Erte has seemingly done the possible: it has defined an era of the past while still remaining popular and socially relevant today.
