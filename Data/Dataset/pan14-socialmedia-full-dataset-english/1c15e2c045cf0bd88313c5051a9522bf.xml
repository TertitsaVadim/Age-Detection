But the true story here is the amazing potential of SUTI and their projects working closely with the top Technology Research Universities.<br /><br />One of the project we find intriguing and currently driven by SUTI is  company logo<br /><br />The new generation AquaStar cooling system achieves an ultra-high efficiency 40-plus SEER (Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio) rating, has no CFCs or toxic gases, improves Indoor Air Quality and reduces AC electricity operating cost by up to 40 percent.<br /><br />With more energy efficient minds, Environmental focus, and government incentive, this technology is becoming more and more a priority and a necessity. Reduction of electricity cost of up to 40% is reason enough for this company to get some serious notice. With the backing of Texas A&amp;M University, and SUTI direction, this is no doubt a success to add value to SUTI’s bottom line. More details can be found at <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.aquastarcooling.com%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.aquastarcooling.com/</a><br /><br />This is just 1 of many projects underway lead buy SUTI and backed by top rated Universities. With this mindset and tapping into the new and innovative minds today, SUTI has a HUGE potential just as we have seen in another successful Company/University teamwork collaboration -  Research in Motion (RIMM).<br /><br />There is definitely monster value built up in this rarely explored area. RIMM was developed at Waterloo, Canada and has been a monster success generating over $20 Billion in sales per year - all from a University group with an idea. SUTI is that next group with a HUGE line up of potential portfolio of winners<br /><br />SUTI is positioned perfectly with shares shifted into longer and stronger hands, and with HUGE potential from SUTI’s group of companies backed by over two dozen TOP Universities across the nation.<br /><br />With a float and outstanding of 41 Million, there is no doubt that the 55 Million shares traded on SUTI last week and 77 million shares this month,  that any and all added shares to the float have been eating up and have been shifted to long term and stronger hands - this paves the way now for a bullish run to MEGA gains.<br /><br />And to re-iterate the potential of SUTI and our sights towards the $0.10 target level, if we look at our last 3 picks:<br /><br />USEI – 134 Million float<br /><br />AERS – 100 Million float<br /><br />CMGO – 70 Million float<br /><br />These plays gave members over 3,000% gains and all have HUGE potential – this definitely shows our persistence in conjunction with our members seeking long term goals with long term targets. With float of less than half then these plays, SUTI stands to gain large!<br /><br />The collective here will push SUTI towards success and to where it should be<br /><br />”Coming together is a beginning; keeping together is progress; working together is success.”<br /><br />SUTI is a solid company with solid fundamental, and trading at $0.0105 is way undervalued and too good to pass up. This is why next week we will continue to buy shares from anyone looking for “Beer Money” and holding long term for monster gains.<br /><br />SUTI<br /><br />ABOUT SUTI<br /><br />Select University Technologies, in.<br /><br />“We will either find a way, or make one.”<br /><br />The words of Carthaginian General Hannibal Barca are usually associated with his best-known military campaign. The quote, however, is not about Hannibal’s stunning victory. The quote is about the importance of strategy and tactics…about finding or making a way – a better way – to achieve success.<br /><br />Hannibal was a gifted strategist, tactician and commander, and his place in history is about creating a new and better way. It is not so much the WHAT, but the HOW, that is Hannibal’s genius, reputation and legacy. And it is the HOW that is central to the SUTI story.<br /><br />SUTIMCo Inc. is in the business of building businesses, and changing the paradigm of technology commercialization. The process inputs are PEOPLE, SYSTEMS, TECHNOLOGY and MONEY; and the outputs are the large liquidation event for each portfolio company.<br /><br />Join the up-to-date discussion in our Skype Chat Room.
