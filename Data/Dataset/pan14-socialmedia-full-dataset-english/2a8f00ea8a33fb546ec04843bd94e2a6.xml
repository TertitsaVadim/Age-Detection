<br />I am lest affected I am invisible to all.
<br />No one see me hears me or knows me.
<br />I slip through the crowds unnoticed.
<br />No one realizes they have a vampire in there mist.
<br />No one can tell when they actually look hard enough to see me.
<br />But once they look they turn away than turn and look again and I am no longer there.
<br /><br />But in one crowd.
<br />I was looked at more than once longer than most by one man.
<br />Than finally he walked over to me.
<br />I could not bare to move a muscle.
<br />Never before has this happened.
<br />I stand still as a statue as I have in the past when people glance at me.
<br /><br />He walked over to me.
<br />Telling me he knows what I am but not who I am.
<br />I simple stated that know one knows who I am that hardly any one knows what I am.
<br />I asked him what he wants from me.
<br />He didn’t reply but tilted his head and bared his neck and whispered “bite.”
<br />“Not here not now. Follow me and I shell.”
<br /><br />He followed me to an ally so dark he could hardly see.
<br />But he still did follow and stood in front of me when I stopped.
<br />Bearing his neck to me again I bite the pulse in his neck and sucked hard to get that sweet delicate juice.
<br />But I realize it is not so sweet the blood flow not as fast.
<br />“What are you?” I asked when I released his neck.
<br />“I a one to.”
<br /><br />So now we go together and stay together.
<br />No one notices us but some glance and see nothing.
<br />Though those that look think they feel someone looking at them.
<br />Now me and Jesse for that is his name are never apart.
<br />You may think you see us you may not.
<br />Walking through the crowds together picking out our pray together.
<br />Never leaving each others side.</div>

<br />But from the natural way that I am.
<br /><br />My Darkness changes though.
<br />Some times it converges with others and makes them hate more.
<br />Other times it makes them hate less.
<br /><br />Manley I just stay away from others.
<br />Sometimes others stray my way but I avoid them.
<br />On some rare occasion I stay to see what happens.
<br />Its not always good because sometimes there is hardly any Darkness around some and it just makes darker.
<br /><br />My Darkness is made by others Darkness.
<br />My Darkness is a world of chaos.
<br />A world of neglect isolation.

<br />The greens, yellows, and pinks turn pale.
<br />The oranges, grays, and browns turn pale and chalky.
<br />The reds, blues, and purples mix together.
<br />The blacks just stay the same or get a little lighter.
<br /><br />This all seems impossible.
<br />I love the blues, purples, and reds so why are they mixing?
<br />The greens, yellows, and pinks I could really care less about.
<br />The oranges, grays, and browns are ok.
<br />And black I just love.
<br /><br />Than I realize I’m seeing people’s moods and feelings.
<br />Right now my friend Danielle is re, for anger.
<br />A little kid named Reece is yellow, for happens or joy.
<br />A guy named Nate is purple, for having a perverted mind.
<br />Me I have a mix of purple, blue, red and black.
<br />Blue for being calm and black for depression.
<br /><br />The colors are all over the place.
<br />Some duller than others, some brighter.
<br />The duller the color the less the emotion or feeling.
<br />The brighter the color the more some one felt.
<br /><br />Suddenly the colors go away and all I see is the natural colors of nature.
<br />Peoples skin tone are normal, their colors too.
<br />No more confusion for my part.
<br />Thank God.</div>

<br /><br />Misplaced, alone and confused in anger,
<br />I lay upon the freshly tilled dirt,
<br />longing to smell you once again.
<br />Soil and petals slip between

<br /><br />Dead long ago,

<br />I can’t help it I like the color black.
<br />Black is like m signature color.
<br />I am always wearing black in some form.
<br />Weather it is my nail polish, my clothes, or my make-up.
<br /><br />Well I am always wearing black nail polish and make-up.
<br />So I guess I’m maybe Semi-Goth.
<br />But I might possibly turn full Goth.
<br />Besides there are Gothic people who aren’t always depressed.
<br />So what does it matter if I’m Goth or not?
<br /><br />Besides Goths like some things I like anyways.
<br />Goths are into vampires and stuff like that.
<br />They like wearing black, I do too.
<br />Although they wear black from head to toe.
<br />I don’t, but I do wear a lot of black.
<br /><br />Goths are cool
<br />They are people I would possibly hang with.
<br />Goths make their life the way they want it to be.
<br />I want to make my life what I want it to be not the life I have right now.
<br />Goths are rebellious, so ain’t I.
<br /><br />I think I want to be a Goth.
<br />I think I maybe turning into a Goth.
<br />If I am I think I will like it better.</div>

<br />That is the only key that I have left.

<br /><br />In the past I was foolish enough to give out keys.
<br />The guys before all lost their keys I gave them.
<br />Now I know that they never truly loved me.
<br />I should have never given keys to false love.
<br /><br />His key will be the last, 
<br />For my heart can’t take the heartbreak again.
<br />It won’t take the heartbreak again
<br />If my heartbreaks again, I will have breathed my last.
<br /><br />He has the key to my heart.
<br />His is a special key.
<br />His kill will unlock all of me.
<br />That is if he turns it right.
<br /><br />The thing with his key,
<br />Is that the key will only work if he truly loves me.
<br />Otherwise it is no more.
<br />And so I shell be too.</div>
