Paris is one of those rare places that can conjure images of grandness, sophistication and wonderment by the mere mention of its name alone.<br /><br />Of course, there are the classic iconic structures such as the Eiffel Tower and Arc de Triomphe, recognisable by their silhouette alone. But as great as these places are for photo albums, they don't even come close to telling the whole story.<br /><br />Indeed, rather than heading straight to the tourist hotspots, bypassing all the wonderful places in between, Paris is a city that is best discovered by travelling through it at a steady pace, whilst taking the time to soak in all that makes Paris what it is.<br /><br />Given its ideal location by the River Seine, perhaps the best way to get to know the real Paris is by boat. Best of all, enjoy the trip.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5zaG9ydGJyZWFrc3RvcGFyaXMub3JnL2NoZWFwLWRpc25leWxhbmQtcGFyaXMtcGFja2FnZXMtaW5jbHVkaW5nLWZsaWdodHMv" target="_blank">Disneyland Paris packages</a>

The resort is located at Marne-la-Vallee in the eastern suburbs of Paris, the capital of France.<br /><br />Construction began in 1988 and the theme park complex was officially opened on 12 April 1992, but attendance was low. And there were protests from those who thought a Disney park in France would harm French culture.<br /><br />In 1994, two years after opening, it had to be rescued from bankruptcy with a 16 billion franc rescue package, and concerns as to its survival only really faded with the arrival of a billionaire prince from Saudi Arabia who became the company's largest investor.<br /><br />In October 1994 the park changed its name to Disneyland Paris, and is now known as Disneyland Resort Paris.<br /><br />In 1995, the theme park started to attract more visitors and what was almost a failure for the Walt Disney Company has over the years become more and more popular and successful.<br /><br />There's nothing like Euro Disney short breaks for a short burst of fun. This is a must for children, but will please all ages because young and old can find their favorite Disney characters from movies like &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot; and &quot;The Lion King&quot; to name two.<br /><br />One of the best times to visit Euro Disneyland in Paris is on weekdays. But try to avoid the French public holidays and school vacations because the park gets very crowded at these times. The least busy time is September to October and May to June.<br /><br />The resort offers a great selection of hotels in and around the park. And most are within easy walking distance of the attractions. The many restaurants and bars in the park can be very costly, especially for the whole family.

I will always recall the amazement on my children's faces after they first entered the park and saw all their favourite characters we did truly have a very magical holiday.<br /><br />So how much of the reality is a trip to Disneyland Paris is it truly affordable or is it beyond most peoples' price ranges? Well if you make the time to plan and research all your options it will be possible to make huge savings but you need to remember that this is really a special place thus you do have to repay a premium. I always find this an issue and love thinking up means of finding savings as this can add to the fun of the vacation.<br /><br />Booking a package cope well in advance is usually the cheapest option as that is when the special offers have their best. You will also see that the offers are limited hence the earlier you book the more choice you'll have over hotels etc. As a rule of thumb I would do a little research within the websites so I learn how much a package is and then have a trip down to my local travel agent and present them the challenge connected with beating the price you will be surprised what they produce. It may not be cheaper but they will add in a few extras that might usually have incurred a new charge.<br /><br />If you want to tie in a visit to Disney within a holiday in France then I recommend you also do somewhat research, buying tickets in advance usually exercises cheaper than on your gate. Rail companies and other travel providers usually have special deals for example in case you cross with Eurotunnel you can get a free day hopper complete and 15% off additional tickets a huge saving especially if there are lots of of you travelling with each other.<br /><br />If you are not staying on site then take a look at each aspect of you trip while you don't want any nasty surprises when you're there. The main things to think about are;<br /><br />&lt;ul&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt; Travel&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;Accommodation&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;Entrance Passes&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;Food and Drink&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;Car Parking&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;Souvenirs&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;Extras - such as Wild West Show &lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;/ul&gt;All of the above can figure out quite pricey but savings can be made on each of the above with careful planning example staying offsite within the apartment is often much cheaper than the onsite hotels. Consider buying a fifty percent board option from Disney as this calculates much cheaper than buying individual meals. [/b]<br /><br />Disneyland Paris brought every one of the Disney experiences can be found in their parks in america to Europe in 1992. But thanks to Eurostar Disneyland Venice has now become probably the most popular day and long weekend destinations for many theme park fans over Britain and Europe.<br /><br />Today you can move directly from Waterloo Stop London to Disneyland park without ever requiring you to change trains. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;<br />&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;<br />&lt;br&gt;So as you is able to see public transport and the road systems are well placed to allow you to Disneyland Paris easily however We would advise you avoid driving around Paris during the rush hour that you can find large build ups involving traffic.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2NhbXB1c2J1Zy5jb20vYmxvZ3Mvdmlldy5waHA/aWQ9MTEzODY3" target="_blank">A Short Break To Disneyland Paris At Christmas</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5iYXJuY3VsdHVyZS5jb20vYmxvZy92aWV3L3Bvc3QvNjYyMDUvRkFNSUxZX0ZVTl9fQUxMX0lOQ0xVU0lWRV9IT0xJREFZU19UT19ESVNORVlMQU5EX1BBUklT" target="_blank">Disneyland Paris Cheap Deals - Getting the Best Value From Your Trip to Euro Disney</a>.
