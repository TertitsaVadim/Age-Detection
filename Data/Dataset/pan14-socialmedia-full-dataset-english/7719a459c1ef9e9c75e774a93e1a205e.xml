Converting the entire museum from halogen to LED light bulbs was a major part of that decision.
<br /><br />The effort will make the Rockland, Maine, institution one of the first—if not the first—art museums in the nation to use LED lighting for all of its galleries. The lights will dramatically reduce the museum’s energy consumption, allowing the Farnsworth to allocate more funds for programs and exhibitions.
<br /><br />For the LED project, the museum has partnered with Efficiency Maine and California-based LEDtronics. The relamping will not only help protect displayed artwork by reducing the potentially harmful effects of standard lighting on works of art, but it will also provide budget relief while promoting a healthier environment by reducing energy use.
<br /><br />The Farnsworth currently has over 480 bulbs in its galleries with an average of 75 watts per bulb. The museum hopes to replace all of its 75-watt halogen bulbs with 15-watt LED and 14-watt CFL bulbs. The resulting savings on electricity is estimated to be $15,800 annually. Additionally, with the reduction of unwanted heat that the LED and CFL bulbs will provide, the project is expected to produce a savings of 127,950 unwanted BTUs per hour, and a savings of 10.6 tons per hour of cooling.
<br /><br />As part of the collaborative agreement with Efficiency Maine, the bulbs received third-party independent testing. With the test outcome more successful than expected, Efficiency Maine has agreed to assist the project with a commitment of more than $13,000 towards material costs. That commitment gives the Farnsworth confidence that the project is a worthy one and will assist Efficiency Maine in their goal to provide greater access to energy-efficient products for businesses and individuals across the state of Maine.

<br /><br />With oversight by the Farnsworth’s curatorial department, a rigorous review process identified two specific bulbs that satisfy lighting requirements for most of the museum’s galleries. The LEDtronics PAR30A-15W-XIW-001M LED bulb provides soft and unfocused light, while the PAR30A-15W-XIW-001S LED Spot provides more focused light. Not only do the lamps adequately light the works of art using up to 85% less energy than incandescent lamps, but they also offer—with a CRI of 86—a wider spectrum of light more closely approximating natural light, thus eliminating the adverse color effects of typical incandescent bulbs.
<br /><br />In addition, in the long term the valuable artwork is spared from damaging UV rays that other types of lights are known to emit. LED bulbs produce no ultraviolet rays that traditionally fade the fine colors found in artwork. The new lighting has already been installed in the Library Gallery. Installation in other galleries and work areas will follow. The LED project is a multi-year effort that will make the museum a leader in environmentally responsible practices. Once this initial phase is installed, there will be further incandescent replacements with another 200-300 pieces of the PAR30 LEDs.
<br /><br />The project is supported in part with a grant from the Maine Arts Commission and also supported by Efficiency Maine.

Representing a district mostly of small towns and rural communities, and having national security on top of his agenda, it is no surprise that in recent years he has co-sponsored or debated for proposals to help make America more energy-independent.
<br /><br />“Energy reform is not just a matter of wanting to keep our air and planet clean, as worthy and as important as those goals are,” he told his House colleagues in January while debating legislation to reduce energy consumption derived from fossil fuels and to increase energy production from renewable resources. “It is also a matter of national security.” Last June, he voted for Energy and Environmental Law Amendments that increases energy efficiency standards for various domestic appliances.
<br /><br />It was only natural that during an Oct. 5 discussion meeting in Southern California with a small group of prominent Pakistani-American professionals, a presentation on LED lighting by the event’s host sparked Congressman Skelton’s interest.
<br /><br />“Although the purpose of the meeting was to address issues of U.S.-Pakistan relations, I could tell the congressman was taken with the energy-saving potential of LED lighting following my introductory presentation,” said Pervaiz Lodhie, President and CEO of LEDtronics, Inc., a Torrance-based company that for 27 years has been innovating light-emitting diode lighting technology and has grown into one of the world’s leading suppliers of energy-efficient, long-lasting LED lamps, clusters and arrays.
<br /><br />“Congressman Skelton was particularly impressed with the potential of solid-state lighting to become a major contributor not only to U.S. energy independence but also to reducing greenhouse gases and the creation of green jobs,” said Lodhie, noting that LED lighting and solar energy industries have become the top job creators in the U.S. in the past years.
<br /><br />Rep. Skelton and wife Patricia were surprised to recognize familiar landmarks among the many architectural applications of LEDs in the LEDtronics slide presentation. Two of the wide-encompassing LEDtronics lighting projects around the world are found in the nation’s capital: the South Capitol Street Bridge, which boasts blue light fixtures from the company, and the Bolling Air Force Base, some of whose streets are illuminated by several types of LEDtronics luminaires and lamps.
<br /><br />Other LEDtronics lighting products are featured in many applications and sites around the globe: U.S. Army Garrison Humphreys in South Korea; Vincent Thomas Bridge, Los Angeles Harbor; Daley Plaza in Chicago; Buckingham Palace in London; Zapopan tunnel in Jalisco, Mexico; Palace Theatre in Albany, New York; Hillsboro Arch in Oregon, and turtle-friendly boulevard lights in Florida, among many others.
<br /><br />“Americans are urged to save energy in their homes, starting with one simple action: changing a light bulb,” Rep. Skelton has told his constituents and supporters. “Households should replace one light bulb in their home with a compact fluorescent light bulb (CFL) that has earned the Energy Star label,” he has written in his weekly column of January 4, 2009.
<br /><br />A year later and following his lunch meeting at LEDtronics, Rep. Skelton might be inspired to urge his constituents to replace the CFL bulb with an LED bulb, considering that the latter outlasts the CFLs by more than 5 times (50,000 hour lifespan vs. 10,000) and consumes less than half the energy on average.
<br />As Rep. Skelton had written then, it is a “cost effective method to reducing energy costs.”

<br /><br />2009 marked the 50th anniversary of the lighting of the trees along North Michigan Avenue, which was the first street in the world to adopt this annual holiday event in 1959.
<br /><br />For half a century, the trees along the street, the roughly mile-long stretch of North Michigan Avenue between Oak Street and the Chicago River, have been illuminated to signal the official kick-off of the holiday season in the Windy City and around the nation. This stretch—one of the top-ten hospitality, fine dining and retail districts in the world—is, in many ways, the heart of the city, a place that bustles with life year-round.
<br /><br />Christmas 2009 marked another milestone for the annual lighting event—the use of LED string lights to adorn the sidewalk trees lining the 900 block of Michigan Ave. called 900 West Shops. About 10 trees were festooned with 100 strings of LEDtronics LED String Lights, replacing incandescent lights used previously and reducing energy consumption by 70%.
<br /><br />The LED strings were part of the Lights Nov. 21 Lighting Procession event.

She had recently seen tricolor lighting atop the Empire State Building during a visit to Liberty State Park and thought the Bayonne Bridge should be similarly decorated in patriotic lights.
<br />Her lobbying efforts inspired the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which maintains the Bayonne Bridge—the fourth longest steel arch bridge in the world.
<br />After seven years, the historic span that connects Bayonne, New Jersey, with Staten Island, New York, wore a necklace of red, white and blue LED lights custom designed by LEDtronics, Inc. of Torrance, California.
<br />Spanning the Kill Van Kull tidal strait and first opened in1931, the Bayonne Bridge was the longest in the world until 1978. Today it carries about 20,000 vehicles per day over its four lanes.
<br />“When we initially showed the bridge Maintenance Group the LEDtronics 180-degree fixture that is used on the Vincent Thomas Bridge in Los Angeles Harbor, they liked the concept but needed the light to be 360 degrees and in red, white and blue,” says Jeffrey Mizel of RF Industries East, the representatives involved with the project.
<br />“As they also wanted to use the existing fixtures, we were provided with samples from the bridge, and LEDtronics engineers set about designing a BSD-1928-OPB-004—a retrofit, mogul-base, 360-degree design,” adds Jeffrey.
<br />It was a perfect solution. In 2009 the project was completed, and the 1,675 feet of the main arch span were illuminated with patriotic LED lighting using about 14 each of BSD-1928-OER-004 (red), BSD-1928-TPW-004 (white) and BSD-1928-OPB-004 (blue).
<br />The little girl, now a teenager, was inspired with what she saw.
<br />Other than the Bayonne and the Vincent Thomas bridges, the LEDtronics BSD-1928-001 series of lights are also installed on the South Capitol Street Bridge in Washington, D.C.
<br />Two other bridges in the area are under consideration to be retrofitted with LED lighting.
<br />The Bayonne Bridge was dramatically blown up in the Steven Spielberg-directed 2005 movie War of the Worlds, starring Tom Cruise and Dakota Fanning.

<br />So, the Southern California consulting firm was not surprised with the energy cost savings it observed at a small-scale beta site in a large homeowners’ maintenance corporation—population 24,000—located in South Orange County, California. After the installation of solid-state landscaping and pool lights, and management of lamp burn time, the monthly monitoring of the electricity bill showed considerable cost reduction.
<br />For its latest landscape-lighting project at one of the largest master-planned communities in the same coastal area, Mukherji Associates replaced halogen lamps with 32 LEDtronics GDL002-200-TPW-001M floodlights to illuminate landscaping along roadways, and 15 PAR38-7X3W-XIW-120AMD bulbs in uplight fixtures for tree and shrub lighting. 
<br />“In addition to the energy savings, these lights will save annual relamping costs as the life of these lights is 50,000 hours,” says company principal Ram Mukherji. The project was financed by San Diego Gas and Electric at zero interest over about five years, payable through energy savings per month.

<br /><br />“Every light at the library that we replaced was using 900 watts of ballasted power consumption and we helped reduce that by nearly 90 percent,” says Pervaiz Lodhie, CEO of LEDtronics. “Not only does the LED lighting in the pendant fixtures save greatly on power but because of the low heat they generate, the room temperature is dramatically reduced so as to save on the air-conditioning cost.”
<br /><br />The historical pendant lighting fixtures located in the main common areas of the library were important for the library to retain. Upon consultation with LEDtronics, Inc., a Torrance, Calif.-based company that started the energy-saving LED lighting movement in the U.S. nearly 28 years ago, a high-power LED cluster designed for retrofit into the pendant fixtures was successfully implemented, without compromising the library’s historical integrity.
<br /><br />The library’s 900-watt, energy-inefficient metal-halide lighting was replaced in each pendant fixture by a 95-watt LED cluster product.
<br /><br />The major concern for the Pasadena Central Library and the City was to reduce burdensome maintenance and power consumption costs as well as to improve the quality of lighting. Since the old metal-halide bulbs were buried within the library fixture's pendant bowl, most of their lumen production was being dampened, and what light intensity was left over was inefficiently bouncing off the upper reflector surface of the pendant fixture to create ambient lighting for the library patron areas. By having the newly installed 95-watt LED cluster of light project upwards from the top of the pendant bowl directly into the upper reflector surface, the library actually achieved higher task area footcandle measurements than with the use of the old bulbs.
<br /><br />In addition, there was a 17-watt LED lamp placed at the top of the pendant fixtures to produce required uplight to the high ceiling above the pendant lamps. Most importantly, beyond the increased lighting performance, the City is able to save 788 watts for each of 30 reworked pendant fixtures. For the library’s weekly hours of operation, that equates to approximately 50,000 KwH in annual energy savings just for the pendant lamps.
<br /><br />Moreover, the City of Pasadena points out that the high cost of maintaining the hard-to-reach suspended fixtures is virtually eliminated, as the old metal-halide bulbs and ballasts no longer need to be replaced on a continuing basis. This represents an additional annual savings of thousands of dollars for periodic bulb and ballast replacement that the City would otherwise need to schedule.
<br /><br />The City of Pasadena decided on the project partly due to the success of the LEDtronics-manufactured LED ceiling panels installed two and a half years ago in the downstairs document room at the library. The 40-watt LED ceiling mount panels replaced the old 90-watt ballasted fluorescent fixtures, during the course of a refurbishment project in mid-2008. Ever since, the LED panels have been operating continuously for at least eight hours per day, a minimum of five days per week.
<br /><br />Close observation has shown that there has been no diminishment of LED light intensity since that time, thus producing more energy savings at the library, and proving once again the sustainability of well engineered premium LED products.
<br /><br />The LED revolution is upon us. Every day, more companies, municipalities and other government agencies across the nation are converting to energy-saving, eco-friendly, environmentally-safe LEDs as the 2012 mandate for phasing out traditional incandescent bulbs inches closer.<img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/112215237_2729930_31067026.jpg" />

<br /><br />Renovation of the 97-year-old Beaux Arts-inspired building was part of a multi-phase, $107-million project that included the modernization of the electrical system to support multimedia presentations and events, improve climate control and enhance exhibition lighting in an energy-efficient manner. Modernizing of the lighting system involved a retrofit from incandescent light fixtures with custom-manufactured LED systems without compromising the historical integrity of the original fixtures, notably in the Rotunda.
<br /><br />LEDtronics provided 90 of 5-watt PAR38-180 Series bulbs and 160 of 1-watt DEC-G25F Series frosted bulbs through the distributor, American Electric Supply of Corona, California, to the contractor of record. The lamps were first installed in summer 2008.
<br /><br />Both types of bulbs offer a color temperature of 3000 Kelvin. Most of the PAR38-180 bulbs were of a narrow beam configuration, and were positioned in a crisscrossing beam fashion around the perimeter of the 57-foot-high Rotunda dome—the centerpiece of the museum building. The rest were medium beam, and were installed in recessed fixtures as down lights around the building’s upper walkway. Use of the 5-watt LED lamps represents a minimum savings of 4,000 watts when compared to the 50-to-60-watt incandescent PAR-style bulbs that might otherwise have been utilized.
<br /><br />The DEC-G25F-style frosted globe lamps were used as accent lighting all around the inside perimeter of the Rotunda. The complete installed set of 1-watt LED bulbs only consumes about 160 watts, compared to the 2,240 watts that would otherwise be consumed had the architect designed in a similar set of standard 14-watt G25 incandescent bulbs.
<br /><br />The LED bulbs were installed not only to reduce energy consumption and improve light quality but also to reduce maintenance costs. Incandescent bulbs would go out often and the poor accessibility made replacing them difficult. Based on the LED’s 50,000-hour operational lifetime and the museum’s weekly hours of operation, maintenance teams will need to replace the LEDtronics lights only about once every 15-plus years.
<br /><br />There is another advantage to the LED switch: The dramatic reduction in lamp-generated heat. This provides major benefits both in terms of much less air-conditioning required to keep the older bulbs cool, and also because keeping the temperature in the rotunda down is important since heat can cause the lead in the skylight to soften.
<br /><br />Originally dedicated when the Natural History Museum opened its doors in 1913, the Rotunda, crowned by the stained-glass skylight, is one of the museum’s most elegant and popular spaces. The colonnaded hall has often been used as a filming location, while the museum’s distinctive main building is on the National Register of Historic Places.
<br /><br />The museum is the largest in the western United States, and its collections include nearly 35 million specimens and artifacts and cover 4.5 billion years of history.

<br /><br />Operating either in 120VAC dimmable or in a wide voltage input range of 90-290VAC, the line of Edison medium screw-base and GU24 bi-pin base bulbs come in various PAR20, PAR30 and PAR38 styles. With energy consumption ranging from 7 watts (PAR20) through 12 watts (PAR30) and up to 15 watts (PAR38), the lamps directly replace incandescents and halogen lamps that consume up to 100 watts, and even compact fluorescent bulbs up to 26 watts, resulting in tremendous energy savings. These state-of-the-art PAR lamps boast 20 percent higher efficacy than the previous generation of LEDtronics PAR lamps.
<br /><br />All of the 120VAC dimmable PAR lamps are UL listed.
<br /><br />The new lineup of PAR lamps provides an outstanding color quality in a 3200K warm-white light and boasts a CRI of 82 that enhances colors and safeguards their fidelity. The focused beam of around 45 degrees generates brightness ranging from 333 lumens (PAR20) to 762 lumens (PAR38).
<br /><br />These LEDtronics PAR LED bulbs offer long-lasting durability, easy drop-in installation in existing 26mm Edison/E27 European screw-base sockets or GU24 dual-pin sockets, and sturdy construction in an aluminum heat-sink body with UV-stabilized plastic Fresnel lens over the latest generation of high-efficacy Cree LEDs.
<br /><br />Because LEDs have no filament, their solid-state design renders them impervious to shock, vibration, frequent switching and environmental extremes. With an average lifespan of up to 50,000 hours, white LED bulbs operate more than 20 times longer than the equivalent incandescent bulb! Unlike compact fluorescents, LEDs contain no harmful mercury; and unlike incandescents, LEDs do not emit large amounts of heat and no ultraviolet or infrared light. This makes them perfect for use in museums, hospitals, offices or areas where UV radiation might degrade the surroundings (such as illuminating valuable artwork, wine cellars or food service areas). The fact that they run remarkably cool also means they greatly reduce the fire hazard normally associated with the use of incandescent lamps.

<br /><br />Furthering its long-term plan to lower its carbon footprint and protect the environment by creating sources of renewable energy for its buildings and reducing energy usage and costs, the District expects to complete a larger solar power project in the summer of 2011 at its Irvington Pump Station in south Fremont.
<br /><br />Following a site survey, LEDtronics recommended possibilities for a variety of energy-efficient LED lighting solutions to replace HID and fluorescent lamps around the plant, such as for post-top lamps, shoebox fixtures in parking lots and other traffic areas, wall-packs on several buildings, and various types of indoor and outdoor lighting.
<br /><br />Before final budgeting is secured for the complete retrofit of LED lighting, USD decided on three areas within the plant to study and test the use of LED materials: In the Alvarado Pump Station, 25-watt wall-pack LED flood lights to replace 250-watt HPS fixtures and 4-ft fluorescent-replacing LED T8 tube lights for pump rooms; at the main distribution building, 4-ft LED wraparound lens-style T8 tube-light fixtures.
<br /><br />USD is an independent special district which provides wastewater collection, treatment and disposal services to the 328,000 residents and businesses of the cities of Fremont, Newark and Union City in the San Francisco Bay Area. It treats a dry weather average of 25 million gallons of wastewater per day.

Comprising an integrated modular system, the RPLH Series are complete assemblies that incorporate the lens, lamp and lamp holder.
<br /><br />The RPLH Series is an excellent choice for applications where space is a concern and aesthetics a consideration. RPLH22-02-0X-02Z47 is 22mm and the RPLH30-02-0X-02Z47 30mm mounting hole, with behind-the-panel depths ranging from 0.93 to 1.04 inches. Offering sunlight-visible light colors, the RPLH Series Lamps and Holders can be employed in utility monitoring boards, industrial control equipment, audio and intercom panels, broadcast equipment, nuclear power status stations and medical instrumentation.
<br /><br />Like the incandescent bulbs commonly used in panel mount applications, LEDtronics’ RPLH Series LED lamps feature T3¼ (9mm) single-contact miniature bayonet bases that give installation a familiar twist. RPLH Series LED lamp assemblies are rated for 130VDC/120VAC input – 50Volts DC minimum. They directly replace 28MB, 313, 757, 1819MB series incandescent bulbs. All LED light output colors are sunlight visible and include: 650nm red, 610nm amber, 596nm yellow, 519nm green, 462nm blue and 8000 Kelvin white.
<br /><br />Raised Lexan® fresnel lenses resist impact, provide an optimal viewing angle of 180 degrees, maximize light dispersion and come in a variety of colors. Designed for screw-on mounting, lenses are independent of the lamp fixtures, enabling them and the LED lamps to be easily changed.
<br /><br />The RPHL Series lamp holders are made of rugged, black Rynite® polyester resin (UL class UL94V0, UL listing E110075) that withstands the rigors of industrial environments and provides enhanced viewer contrast. Holders incorporate captive terminal screws with self-lifting pressure wire clamps that accept up to two 14-gauge wires. Lamp holders are rated for incoming voltages of 130VDC/120VAC input – 50Volts DC minimum. Compact RPHL Series holders fit many space-restricted applications with behind-the-panel depths of 0.94&quot;, 1.04&quot; and 0.93&quot; 22mm and 30mm fixtures, respectively.
<br /><br />The solid-state design of the RPLH Series LED lamps renders them impervious to electrical and mechanical shock, vibration, frequent switching and environmental extremes. With an average life span of 100,000-plus hours (11 years) and up to 50,000 hours for the white LED—more than 30 times longer than the equivalent incandescent lamp—RPLH Series LED lamps operate reliably year after year. Savings from reduced maintenance costs and downtime quickly return the capital investment expenditure!
<br /><br />Additionally, RPLH Series LED lamps produce almost no heat and require 80% - 90% less operating power than equivalent incandescent bulbs, making them as friendly to the environment as they are to the operating budget.
<br /><br />Founded in 1983, LEDtronics® leads where others only follow when it comes to designing, manufacturing and packaging state-of-the-art LEDs to meet the world’s constantly changing lighting needs. Our inventive product line encompasses an array of direct incandescent lamp replacement Based LEDs, low-cost snap-in and relampable Panel Mount LEDs, high intensity sunlight-visible Discrete LEDs, PCB LEDs circuit board status indicators, surface mount diodes SMT LEDs, full-spectrum rainbow RGB LEDs and Infra-Red (IR) LEDs.

<br />by Austin Siegemund-Broka Staff Writer
<br />Posted: 08/11/2011 06:29:36 PM PDT
<br />Updated: 08/12/2011 08:23:04 AM PDT
<br /><br />Lights fill the LEDtronics conference room - rows of unique ceiling lights, boxy warehouse lights, hanging chandeliers, stylish streetlights lined up against one wall.
<br /><br />Light-emitting diodes, called LEDs, power every one of them.
<br /><br />The sight dazzles, but it also represents how Torrance-based LEDtronics works with LEDs.
<br /><br />&quot;We keep building custom products. That's what we are doing; we do that constantly,&quot; said Pervaiz Lodhie, LEDtronics president and CEO, glancing around the room with the look of a proud father.
<br /><br />Every LEDtronics light houses environmentally friendly LED chips, bits of solid chemicals that glow when electrons move across them.
<br /><br />But LEDtronics specializes in &quot;packaging&quot; the LEDs, Lodhie says - they build LED chips into lighting fixtures of hundreds of different shapes, sizes, and colors, designed to fit the diverse applications of LEDs today.
<br /><br />Customers, including IBM, Toyota, Boeing and the city of Torrance, come to LEDtronics for light fixtures as well as custom-designed lighting systems.
<br /><br />The company estimates they've designed over 10,000 LED fixtures, and Lodhie says LEDtronics develops one new product or redesign every day.
<br /><br />&quot;We are constantly being challenged by the industry to give them the precise color, the precise this or that,&quot; he said.
<br /><br />LEDs today consume 90 percent less energy than traditional incandescent bulbs and last about 100 times longer, though they often cost much 
<br /><br />LEDs also give off no energy as heat, their colors are easily adjustable and they are durable, able to withstand physical shocks and vibrations.
<br /><br />The market for the resilient light source took off in the late 1990s, more than tripling in size from 1995 to 2003, according to market research firm Strategies Unlimited.
<br /><br />Strategies reports that the industry grew from $3.8 billion in 2003 to $5.6 billion in 2009, driven by a boom in LED backlighting for cell phones and TVs; the market then doubled in 2009, reaching $10.8 billion in 2010.
<br /><br />Rarely does the market's demand for a new technology rise that quickly, says Vrinda Bhandarkar, a senior analyst at Strategies Unlimited. 
<br /><br />&quot;There's a lot of excitement and `cool' associated with LEDs,&quot; she said.
<br /><br />But the LED market's recent boom doesn't tell the whole story, Lodhie says.
<br /><br />&quot;What people are finding as a `new LED market' has been there for decades. It was behind the scenes, and nobody really knew,&quot; he said.
<br /><br />Lodhie and his wife started LEDtronics in their Torrance garage in 1983.
<br /><br />Lodhie remembered early LEDs, developed in the 1970s, that only came in a couple colors and gave off little more than a dim glow.
<br /><br />But despite those limitations, he knew, the LEDs' durability made them perfect for applications where they would weather vibration and couldn't easily be changed.
<br /><br />LEDtronics initially produced LEDs as small indicator lights for a handful of niches - manufacturing machinery, elevators, military aircraft.
<br /><br />LEDtronics supplies the same kinds of lights to those markets today.
<br /><br />&quot;These were the natural places that drove the industry continuously,&quot; Lodhie said.
<br /><br />But LEDs increased in brightness roughly tenfold every decade, and 1995 brought the first white LED.
<br /><br />LEDtronics packaged each new LED chip into bulbs for an increasing array of customers and applications, Lodhie says.
<br /><br />Today, they still produce lights and indicators for industries such as healthcare, aerospace, defense and electronics.
<br /><br />But Lodhie says some customers now use LEDtronics' lights in outdoor lighting, for parking lots and car dealerships, and in interior lighting design for museums and other architectural projects.
<br /><br />The company has also developed streetlights in Torrance and Pasadena, and bridge lighting for such structures as the Golden Gate Bridge - part of a movement by cities, including Los Angeles, Seattle and Boston, toward using LEDs in municipal lighting.
<br /><br />And they've even designed LEDs for entertainment lighting projects, such as decorations on sets for the Tony-winning musical &quot;Wicked.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;The revolution has been taking place, but people didn't see it,&quot; Lodhie said. &quot;It's a really exciting time for me, (with) what I have done in creating this market.&quot;
<br /><br />But Lodhie also does not see LEDtronics' success - or the current LED industry boom - as the end of the revolution.
<br /><br />&quot;It has just begun. It's a drop in the bucket; a lot more has to happen,&quot; he said.
<br /><br />LEDs will provide light in more and more lighting applications, Lodhie believes.
<br /><br />Market analysts, including Bhandarkar at Strategies Unlimited and Jamie Fox, LED research manager at competing firm IMS, say the same.
<br /><br />&quot;LEDs are the future of light. Most lighting applications will go to LED lighting,&quot; Fox said. &quot;Most people agree on that; it's just question of when.&quot;
<br /><br />Lodhie says LEDtronics, and the LED industry, do still face several obstacles to widespread LED use.
<br /><br />Many governments, including in the United States, have passed laws to phase out some types of incandescent bulbs to reduce energy use. That is good news for the LED industry.
<br /><br />Some LEDs' high purchase prices can scare consumers, Lodhie says, though LEDs usually cut energy expenses enough to make them a strong long-term investment.
<br /><br />For consumers considering in-home LED lighting, for instance - a growing market, but one in which LEDtronics participates only minimally - LED light bulbs can cost daunting prices of $20 to $30.
<br /><br />But increasing LED usage and better technology will drive production costs and prices down, Lodhie says.
<br /><br />&quot;It's just a continuation of making it more affordable for more and more people, and that is happening,&quot; he said.
<br /><br />He plans to enter the residential LED market more fully when that happens, and when the company's brand has a stronger public presence.
<br /><br />But more crucially, he says, many lighting consumers just aren't aware of the possibilities and benefits of LED light.
<br /><br />As consumers increasingly accept the energy-sipping bulbs, Lodhie believes, LED use will simply keep increasing.
<br /><br />&quot;There's no limit to applications,&quot; he said. &quot;There's no end to it.&quot;

The bulbs operate on 120VAC and provide a concentrated 40-degree beam of light from a cluster of 40 LEDs.
<br />The energy-efficient R16-40-SIW-120AM (3,000K warm white) and R16-40-TPW-120AM (5000K natural white) draw just 1.7 watts each and provide up to 140 lumens. Up to 90% savings in energy costs over incandescent and halogen bulbs, and an operating lifespan of up to 50,000-hour LED make these high-efficacy R16 lamps ideal for architects, retail store display creators, entertainment designers and other lighting professionals to integrate economical illumination into maintenance-intensive applications—display spot lights, showcase lights, area lights, signage and backlighting, in addition to reading and task lights. They also can be used as individual pixels in a large dot matrix screen and moving signs.
<br />A clear, shatter-resistant lexan lens and a white polycarbonate sleeve protect the LED cluster from environmental stresses, making the lamps suitable for both indoor and outdoor use. Solid-state design renders LEDs impervious to electrical and mechanical shock, vibration, frequent switching and environmental extremes. Additionally, with the use of multiple LEDs, an LED cluster lamp continues to provide light even if one or more emitters fail, unlike what befalls an incandescent bulb when its filament breaks.
<br />The virtually maintenance-free LEDtronics R16 lamps are also environmentally friendly—they contain neither lead nor mercury. As well, they reduce light pollution in outdoor installations and, as a result, are compatible with the international “Dark Skies” initiative.
<br />Because of their low power draw, they are ideal for use with alternate or renewable energy resources like solar and wind power.
<br />The R16-40-SIW-120AM and R16-40-TPW-120AM bulbs come with a 3-year limited warranty and are priced $49.50 each; availability is stock to 4-6 weeks for special requirements. Large-quantity discounts are available.

The series LED60T8SM-360-XPW-001W 5-foot bi-pin LED tube lights fit into standard G13 bases and are designed with a smaller tube diameter to accommodate the space inside food coolers and freezers and display cases. Additionally, the minimal lamp heat output of LEDs over that produced by incandescent lamps keeps temperatures inside the coolers and freezers optimally lower. As well, with their much wider ambient operating temperature and humidity ranges, the LED tube lights have a greater performance in cold freezer-type applications where fluorescents have high failure rates.
<br /><br />The 60-inch-long tube lamps come in clear (LED60T8SM-360-XPW-001W) and frosted (LED60T8SM-360-XPW-001WF) and operate on a wide input voltage range of 90 to 290 volts AC, thus accommodating both North American or European currents. They typically consume 21 watts at 120VAC, delivering a total lumen output of 1,950 (clear lens) and 1,798 (frosted lens) at color temperatures between 4500K to 5200K (pure daylight white). They provide a brightness of 668 maximum candelas (clear lens) and 527 (frosted lens) across a wide beam pattern of up to 140 degrees. Other viewing angles, tube lengths and a variety of LED light colors are available for OEM customers.
<br /><br />These premium-grade T8 LED tube lights are ideal for food industry refrigerators, coolers and freezers, deli cases, floral refrigerators and coolers, office lighting, general and street sign backlighting, task lighting, under cabinets/counters, display cases, interior design uses, and retail store displays.
<br /><br />When it comes to rated life, the LEDtronics series LED60T8SM-360-XPW-001W really shines. While conventional fluorescent lamps typically have an ideal-condition rated lab life in the range 8,000 to 24,000 hours, the LEDtronics tube lights boast a real world operating life of 50,000 hours and more—5.7 years of continuous light output. Furthermore, since the LED lights produce so little wasted heat, the temperature inside the fixture does not build up as it does with conventional fluorescent tubes. That means the LED tubes produce less heat, which saves on display case and freezer air-conditioning costs.
<br /><br />The sturdy construction of a UV-resistant polycarbonate housing over the LED tube provides increased protection — no glass to break and no mercury environmental hazards to worry about as with fluorescent tubes. In addition, the housing shields against many environmental effects, allowing them to be placed in locations where typical tube lights would be more vulnerable to the elements, thus eliminating the additional expense of light-robbing plastic tube guards—a major problem in the food industry. Also, LEDtronics tubes perform well in a wide range of ambient operating temperatures: ~-22°F to ~+122°F (~-30°C to ~+50°C), making them ideal for applications subject to frequent on-off cycling or very low temperatures, such as in food freezers and coolers.
<br /><br />Other benefits of LEDs over fluorescents include: Quick and easy installation to minimize retrofit costs; no ballast nor starter needed, thus no radio frequency to interfere with radio and cell phone signals; instant, full-strength light-up; no buzzing or flickering; and directional distribution of light—good for interior task lighting.
<br /><br />Solid-state design renders LEDs impervious to shock, vibration, frequent switching and environmental extremes. Savings from reduced maintenance costs and downtime quickly return the capital investment expenditure, making them as friendly to the environment as they are to the operating budget. The LEDtronics T8 tubes comply with RoHS—the lead-free and mercury-free European directive. They emit no infrared or ultraviolet radiation. Unlike conventional fluorescent bulbs, LED lights are not disposed of as hazardous waste at end of life.
<br /><br />The LEDtronics series LED60T8SM-360-XPW-001W and LED60T8SM-360-XPW-001WF come with a 3-year limited warranty and are priced $109.00 each; availability is stock to 4-6 weeks for special requirements. Large-quantity discounts are available.

<br /><br />Nestled in the foothills of the Hualapai Mountain range, the award-winning Kingman Regional Medical Center (KRMC) is a community-owned 235-bed healthcare facility located in Kingman, Arizona—the seat of the Mohave County. It is the largest provider of health and wellness services in northwestern Arizona and has been often recognized as one of the nation’s top 100 hospitals in the State of the Nation’s Hospitals report. At 3,500 feet in elevation, the hospital sits in a beautiful high-desert rural community.
<br /><br />The medical center was using 250-watt HPS lamps in 88 fixtures throughout the campus, running on voltage ranges from 120VAC to 277VAC. The poles are mostly around 16-20 feet high, with some in the 24'-26' range; they are spaced 40-60 feet apart in the parking lot.
<br /><br />When Howard Industrial Sales made a demonstration of the 88-watt LEDtronics SLL003P-30X2W-XPW-005 LED luminaire, the chairman of the board, managers and other executives were all impressed by the light output and the resulting detail clarity in the security cameras, not to mention the energy savings of 202 watts per fixture.
<br /><br />The proposed upgrade to LED lighting also coincided with the KRMC embracing the green movement in recent months and undertaking a leadership position in environmentally friendly solutions in their community.
<br /><br />An initial order to replace the 88 HPS lamps was shipped within a few months, followed by another shipment to bring the total to 104 LED lamps. The shoebox-style LED luminaires use over 60% less energy than the conventional HPS units that were being used, and require much less maintenance in the way of bulb and ballast replacement. The LEDtronics LED parking-lot lights are provided with a 5-year warranty and will provide useful light with no more than 30% light degradation at 50,000 hours of operation. This results in an estimated savings slightly in excess of $100,000 during that time frame.
<br /><br />What started as a project to get better-lit images out of the security cameras ended up as a whole package of energy savings as well as security benefits and better lighting for users of the parking lot. Due to the success of the project, Kingman is now looking at other areas within the facility where LED lighting might bring energy savings as well as reduce maintenance labor and time.

The lights are located on several blocks of Linden and Carpinteria Avenues in the downtown area and include lights on the Amtrak rail platform and its adjoining public parking lots.
<br /><br /><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/112215237_15308508_48232305.jpg" />
<br /><br />According to the city’s calculations, each of the 199 HPS lamps at 138 watts each consumed 604.4 kWh annually—a total of 120,284 kWh and an energy cost of $15,035 (at $0.125 per kWh, 12 hours of operation each evening). With the switch to the brilliant and more directional LEDtronics 29-watt LED bulbs, the annual energy cost came down to less than $3,160—a dramatic 80 percent savings. In addition, the LED bulb life is four to five times longer than the replaced HPS bulbs, resulting in reduced maintenance costs that yield additional savings.
<br /><br />In addition to the $11,600 savings on its annual energy bill, this reduction in power usage by 96,000 kWh translates into a decrease of its carbon footprint by an estimated 33 tons of CO2 yearly.
<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5sZWR0cm9uaWNzLmNvbS9NZWRpYS9QcmVzc1JlbGVhc2VzLmFzcHg/cHJlc3NJRD0yMjk_" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/112215237_3686572_48232317.jpg" /></a>
<br /><br />“I like the results very much,” said Matthew Roberts, director of the city’s Parks and Recreation Department that installed and maintains the street lights. “The LEDtronics lamps fit into the existing light fixtures with only minor modifications and look great. I think the consensus is that the new bulbs produce fewer glares, are easier on the eyes, and have a very appropriate color temperature for our needs.”
<br /><br />The Santa Barbara County city is a coastal community of 13,040, with small-town charm, beautiful beaches and breathtaking mountain views. It hosts the annual California Avocado Festival.
<br /><br />“All of the lights installed so far have worked as promised,” says Roberts. “It’s great to know our streetlight electrical meters are turning more slowly, saving tax dollars. It’s also nice to know the products were assembled in the USA.” The product was designed and engineered at the LEDtronics factory in Southern California.
<br /><br />The project started in early 2010, when the city began to study the conversion of pendant street lights in its downtown area to LED bulbs that are more energy-efficient, cast a more natural warm light and reduce light pollution. They looked for solutions that were cost-effective, more environmentally friendly and also more night-sky friendly.
<br /><br />After testing the LEDtronics LED30HPS-600-SIW-002-BU pendant lamp for two months, the city applied for funds and received $74,117 from the California Energy Commission under the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grant (EECBG) program from the U.S. Department of Energy, which is part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA). The bulbs are certified “Made In USA.” The total project cost was $78,580.
<br /><br />Carpinteria’s lighting efficiency project is in line with the California Long Term Energy Efficiency Strategic Plan, which holds the state’s local governments to be leaders in energy efficiency by 2020, both for their own facilities and throughout their communities. The city so far has replaced over 90% of its traditional street lights with LEDs.
<br />LEDtronics LED30HPS-600-SIW-002-BU
<br /><br />According to city officials, the LEDtronics LED bulbs were selected because of their high efficiency, appropriate 3000K color temperature, and because they fit inside the existing globe diffusor without significant modification. The new LED bulb also allowed for the elimination of the HPS bulb's ballast and starter. As well, LED bulbs produce little or no ultraviolet light (UV) which, as generated by the HPS bulbs along with the high heat, causes the polycarbonate globe diffusers to yellow and become brittle.
<br /><br />With longer life for the globe diffusers and reduction of visits to each light by maintenance staff, the 10-year projected cost savings is expected to reach $150,000. This is in addition to the significant energy savings inherent in the LEDtronics LED bulbs that the city has already started to enjoy.
