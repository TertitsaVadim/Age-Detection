<br /><br />[( WE D0NT KNOW WHY )]
<br /><br />-- your FiRST KiSS isnt always your BEST KiSS
<br /><br />-- If you can tie a KN0T in a CHERRY with your tounge, it doesn't mean you are a good kisser .. it just means your TOUNGE MUSCLE is strong
<br /><br />-- ALL GiRLS are NOT hoes, and ALL GUYS are NOT PLAYERS .. EVERYONE gets a LiTTLE H0RNY sometimes
<br /><br />BE A GREAT KiSSER W/ THESE TiPS
<br /><br />-- T0UCH HiS/HER FACE
