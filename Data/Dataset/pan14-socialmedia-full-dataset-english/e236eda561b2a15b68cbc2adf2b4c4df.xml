Today thanks to the rapid evolution in technology, a musician can record a song and share it with listeners around the world. In the past, distribution was controlled by the record labels. Unless you had a record deal and used <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5lYXN5cmVwbGljYXRpb24uY28udWsvY2QtcmVwbGljYXRpb24_" target="_blank">CD Replication</a> or CD Duplication it was almost impossible to reach listeners outside of your immediate area.
<br /><br />CD Replication and CD Duplication was not only controlled, but there was no way around the high costs of physical distribution. CD Replication could be prohibitively expensive for the starving artist. However, with free MP3 distribution via the internet, an artist’s music can reach across the world. An up and coming Latin diva can share her tunes with someone in Europe. The next rock star in Africa can share his music with someone in Japan. The Internet has opened a door that allows artists to share their art with anyone, anywhere, at any time.

<br /><br />A transaction-processing server prepares the data and then communicates the information to an automated replication robot. On demand DVD Replication simplifies the process. The replication robots master the CD, duplicate it, label it and verify its content. The CD or DVD is then packaged and labelled ready for immediate postal dispatch.
<br /><br />The benefits of On Demand DVD Replication include:
<br /><br />• Priority scheduling with on demand DVD replication
<br />• Rapid turnaround
<br />• No requirement for you to forecast demand
<br />• Eliminates the need to hold and manage expensive stocks
<br />• Contract pricing
<br /><br />Due to high equipment cost and the high level of technical expertise required, few companies can offer this kind of service.

		<document id="197200678203d12fce09d7f5362fe653" url=""><![CDATA[Brief Introduction to DVD Replication<br/><br/>DVD Replication provides a cost effective way to produce low volumes of DVD for demonstration purposes. It is important to note this method does not produce a genuine retail quality product. Only DVDs manufactured by replication will provide the shop ready article.
<br /><br />For replication it is common for the minimum production run to be 500 and in some cases 1000. DVD Replication provides the option of lower quantities. It is worth noting however that it can prove more cost effective to replicate – especially if you are likely to require more copies in the future. Costs for DVD Replication remain similar for each time you order whereas replication unit costs are lower. For example if you ordered 200 duplicated DVDs initially and then had a requirement for a further 200 a short time later, the likelihood is it would be far cheaper to replicate 500 or even 1000 at the outset.

It is done on CD silk screening. The companies that are involved in CD duplication use the latest technology and equipment and adhere to strict quality regulations and controls. Since a large number of copies are created during replication, it is not an expensive procedure. The vendor will give you the first duplicated copy of the CD to make sure the quality and get your approval. The first copy is also important because the quality of all the other copies depend on that first copy, instead of the master disc. Not only this, CD Replication service providers usually provide beautiful packages for the CDs. CD replication is a good option especially for the businesses, in which projects have to be worked on with a large number of CDs like five hundred or more and when all the people working on the same project require the same master disc.

To start off, DVD duplication is simply the process of burning data from an original DVD onto another existing DVD recordable disc. Bulk duplication is possible with high quality industrial grade duplicators which can produce formats playable in different DVD players.
<br />On the other hand <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5lYXN5cmVwbGljYXRpb24uY28udWs_" target="_blank">bulk DVD replication</a> involves the generation of a clone of an original master copy. A glass master is created from the original master and from it a stumper is then created. The stumper is defined as the mirror image of the contents in the DVD. The stumper is then mounted onto a High Tech injection mould machine and in the molding process a replica of the mould is produced on the normal DVD disc which is then coated using a thin layer of reflective aluminum.
