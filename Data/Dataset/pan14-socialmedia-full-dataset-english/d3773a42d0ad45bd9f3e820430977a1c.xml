After 90 years, domestic civilian reflective material
<br />Market begun to track materials, products, applications plus more ! areas, professions become a lot more finely, the kind of departments for the different uses of reflective materials were developed to international standards or industry standards, similar to: National occupational standards EN-47l (high visibility warning clothing), &quot;Road traffic sign reflective film&quot; for example. Europe along with other Western developed countries can even regulate the employment of reflective materials as the important basis of insurance claims, overall health, wellness version of regulations or encourage, require or promoting going with reflective materials, which include rain, fog, snow, night vision consequently the opportunity to identify poor environment, aging adults, children leave, to put on or or wear an illustration by using a reflective material or clothing. Civil reflective materials mostly are reflective fabric, reflective lattice films, reflective printing cloth, reflective cloth manufacture of the domestic manufacturers of relatively well-known that the optimal way, Star China, Korea as well night vision. Industry mainly means the use of reflective materials all five degrees of reflective film, diamond grade reflective sheeting, high-strength grade reflective sheeting, engineering grade reflective sheeting, reflective film and advertising level plate grade reflective film. Mainly of the production of several different reflective signage, vehicle license plate, security facilities, in the daytime using its bright warning colors play a vital role at night or under poor lighting conditions, the brilliant reflection effects is generally effectively enhance people's capability identify, to experience the point, resulting in the mindful of avoid accidents, reduce casualties, minimize economic losses, become a vital road traffic staffing, there may be a clear social benefits. Healthy the national economy whenever you want, traffic developed rapidly, the rapid increase of China's highway mileage, high-speed highway traffic engineering, information technology
<br />Is about the development direction, in the construction of China's urbanization and development, air and beautify the hub as components of comprehensive, full interchange urban road progressively more, while various vehicle ownership is growing, traffic increasing prosperity, pursued by, traffic management, traffic safety have been mentioned key position, improving traffic management to guarantee traffic safety, so that the national economic development, for the utmost safety of life and property, has developed into a consensus , although development of traffic signs, road traffic safety, vehicle identification, directional signs for traffic safety management setting is definitely a important part.

That constitute several different fabrics and sewing along the substrate, as being a high-grade materials, are trusted in reflective clothing, all kinds of career wear, casual wear, sportswear, fashion, hats, gloves, bags, personal protective equipment, etc., also can be made into a lot of reflective products, jewelry. Increase security. Reflective printing fabric that Burkina Crystal lattice, are Crystal lattice structure of Burkina class family micro-prism reflective material. Crystal lattice is known as a new form of reflective printing advertising material, these toppers features include super reflective intensity-based micro prism retro-reflective technology, reflective strength of 300cd/lx/m2. May direct printing, the actual top layer of PVC polymer, ink, that will be direct printing. Comfortable, like fiber composite fabric substrate and PVC calendering film, synthetic fiber fabric has superior tensile strength of grass-roots level, is just as popular as usage of fiber composite fabric printing, direct printing, direct tension installation; PVC After rolling film adhesive within the coating entirely on the information in smooth paste use.
<br /><br />Reflective printing cloth through the reflective layer as well as lamp cloth grass-roots form. In accordance with their structural differences reflective reflective material may very well be separated into standard, wide angle reflective material and reflective material type stars. Mark the actual reflective material which can be reflective printing cloth, good indicators of the quality and balance outstanding as glare index, often is the largest product market demand. There's a couple of products cloth and adhesive. Wide angle reflective material that is definitely shiny star printing cloth, expanded all the different effective angle of reflection, to broaden the installation of reflective material field, nevertheless the glare-type signs getting slightly lower. There are two products cloth and adhesive.
<br /><br />Starry Starry-type reflective material this is printing cloth, when stars blinking through the standby and call time effect of increasing the pad decided not to spend a function, but is low versus reflective, mainly for any streets, shopping malls and shops the urban environment. The two products cloth and adhesive.
<br /><br />Reflective printing fabric printing can be accomplished from a large outdoor billboards, for highways, roads, mines as well as other outdoor environments, the night time without lighting, and allows only traffic light advertising content clear and bright, with your effect every day.

<br />Applicable floor: aluminum, steel.
<br />Operating temperature: general requirements in 18 ? ~ 28 ?.
<br />Diamond grade reflective sheeting
<br />Performance reflective film in that series are often the Ministry of Communications ministerial JT-T279-1995 standard first and second grade reflective sheeting, reflective of its principle is special belonging to the grade and high-strength engineering grade reflective sheeting reflective glass beads utilised in principle , although the us going for a ceramic cube reflection of this most advanced technology.
<br />Each diamond grade reflective sheeting arranged in microcrystalline cubic coupling, in the area of one square centimeter of material we will have upwards of 930 cubic ceramic body angle. Microcrystalline cubic body belonging to the lower angle formed by sealing an air layer, the light rays to form an enclosed total reflection, so no reflective layer of metal can be achieved with the most excellent reflective effect. With wear-resistant and high hardness for the polycarbonate material technology manufactured from microcrystalline cubic diamond grade reflective sheeting using the traditional project-level and relatively high intensity grade reflective sheeting, reflective from the performance not just multiplied, but there's very wide-angle performance large increase. Diamond grade reflective sheeting brightness level for those project beyond six times, is definitely more than thrice the strength level.
<br />For highway and urban road traffic signs. In normal use, Ten years when the brightness retention with a minimum of 50% of initial brightness value. Employing the same model of ink used screen printing technology can certainly create a amount of patterns.

<br />An evaluation with ordinary light box cloth printing, advertising Twenty-four hours to accomplish visibility.
<br />Incorporates a unique reflective properties, built-in night light does not need an outside source of light as well as trigger of the intelligence situation itself by reflecting the lighting emitted by passing vehicles may be possible and built-in source of light or perhaps an external source of light can be found the identical effect. Using ordinary printing cloth advertising, advertising is merely visible effect only throughout the day, night, low visibility, additionally advertising the role. The reflective printing cloth printing cloth the whole day, like ordinary, but also the night by reflection of light emitted by passing vehicles, to high-intensity, long-distance effects sometimes appears, so advertising 24 hours a day and night with similar advertising effect. Mainly because of these advantages, so the reflection of light boxes ordinary printing cloth printing cloth alternatives.
<br />Advertising over a application
<br />Second, install lights and an external light source particularly light boxes and auxiliary source of light rather than advertising: eco-friendly, easy maintenance, more affordable.
<br />To be the visibility of reflective printing materials are from the lights of passing vehicles, light reflected on where the source emission, and so the light source inside of the same launch vehicles and pedestrians can clearly are aware of the ads. He don't need other auxiliary source of light so he or she can be conscious of the effect in achieving energy consumption, with no need of, so he installed lights advertising at least environmental protection. As he without any other auxiliary lighting, electrical, etc. so you don't need to maintain the way it is as normal on condition that he'll be able to maintain normal printing materials. So he's advertising material versus auxiliary source of light better maintain. Auxiliary source of light facilities and daily needs associated with the power consumption, and maintenance costs are much greater compared to a use of reflective fabric printing advertising costs. Moreover, the money advertising in general represent the great majority of a cost factor stands out as the rental advertising, general advertising materials utilised in advertising costs also be aware of no more than ten per-cent of rental costs. Because most of the ads may take into account the importance of energy consumption and use, consequently auxiliary light source will likely be only available to 11pm, after eleven no advertising effectiveness, the installation of reflective materials, printing cannot acquiring a quality factors, in the event that there is also a car that enables you to clearly start to see the us going for reflective printing ads.
<br />Third, in contrast to ordinary reflective material: with inkjet and tensile strength and will often be a little more reflective intensity.
<br />Advertising on the application
<br />Traditional advertising material is in the main reflective adhesive advertising grade reflective PET film, PET characteristics on this material cannot determine his printing, general PET-based advertising grade reflective sheeting for lettering only, thus greatly limit reflective material from your ad on use. Reflective printing materials appear immediately solve this issue, printing materials, reflective surface will be the face of high reflective material printing, ink is strong, as long as the reccommended energy-soluble agents can printing ink. General advertising grade reflective material hasn't got the required tensile properties of advertising, only with the support of other bodies like PC version, paste in the support body with the use of these. Reflective within the underlying printing cloth mesh is PVC clip, he has been by way of a tensile strength PVC tarpaulin, the crna can mesh just as a typical folder to utilise. Fourth, reflective printing material by having a reflective material incorporates a unique way to add security features.
<br />Widely used reflective materials advertising printing, he's got becoming a reflective traffic signs are visible during the night time function. Use reflective printing materials as roadside advertising sections, passing vehicles on the move can clearly look at the outline, since covered with passers-by should be shot oh no- the lighting, and show the contours on the shadows of an individual, so that driving travel by car far better identify people. So the crna can give better road safety performance.
<br />Introduction and main reflective fabric printing purposes: advertising printing supplies and road traffic safety field.
<br />Printing marketplace is mainly used in advertising: billboards surrounding the bridge, flag poles, flag the trail column, advertisement all around the site, building construction frame advertising, Optimus Prime, billboards, light boxes, advertising stickers, vehicle graphics, tree screen advertising .
<br />Traffic safety products information mill mainly utilised in: Temporary construction signs, road signs, crash barrels, cones, body reflectors, etc.

Expansion of the nation's economy without notice, traffic developed quickly, the rapid increase of China's highway mileage, high-speed highway traffic engineering, inform technology. Is the development direction, when using the construction of China's urbanization and development, the community and beautify the area as areas of comprehensive, full interchange urban road ever increasing numbers of, while various vehicle ownership is growing, traffic increasing prosperity, pursued by, traffic management, traffic safety can be mentioned a very important position, improving traffic management to ensure that traffic safety, making sure that the national economic development, for the utmost safety of life and property, has changed into a consensus , although increasing amount of traffic signs, traffic safety, vehicle identification, directional signs for traffic safety management setting most certainly important part. Abroad, a figure that traffic and road signs of the chances of accidents is 70% complete away from traffic and road signs for drivers and pedestrians with an excellent reflex, can effectively reduce accidents and improve traffic efficiency.
<br />Road Traffic Signs
<br />According to the latest national standard printed pattern strictly. Materials are aluminum, enamel, stainless steel, luminous, reflective aluminum together with materials to reach different user needs. This strategy is acid and alkali, anti-corrosion, while in the wild from the wind and rain, won't fade. Signs generally emerge the way traffic, factories, mines, construction sites, power facilities, transportation together with other places should look into safety, secure alarm sounded to opportunity seekers, enterprises and institutions is a great safety management, safety knowledge publicity right-hand man.

However, the long, reflective materials in China information mill covered with imported products, especially high-strength grade reflective sheeting. While the reflective film with good technical content, high-priced imported products to be sold in our country, acquire a lot of profit. Huge of foreign spending, limiting use of China's reflective film, the rapid expansion of China's national economy formed a good contrast, the introduction of our national economy, specially the healthy road safety is very unfavorable. Therefore, the reflective film products assisted to break the monopoly of foreign products to exchange imports, promote making use of reflective film to decrease the money necessary projects when promoting enhancing traffic safety, specially in underdeveloped central and western regions to market the roll-out of traffic safety engineering is extremely necessary. In reality, the reflective film products cannot replaced in neuro-scientific transportation safety roles, has become the necessity of the entire society, but will also much worry about the state's industrial policy, support and nurturing. State Science and Technology, Ministry of Communications, Ministry of Light Industry together with key work for the project several times, to encourage reflective film directed tool. State Planning Commission, State Economic and Trade Commission jointly issued two committees can also be within the &quot;current national consentrate on encouraging the roll-out of industries, products and technologies,&quot; Article X 5 &quot;Highway development and creation of new materials&quot; directory, of our own &quot;Ten five &quot;special high-tech industry development priorities plan, as the&quot; 12 key projects, &quot;Nine&quot; microelectronics, optoelectronics materials &quot;, these instructions, reflective membrane localization according to national industrial policies.
<br />Edit this paragraph domestic technology
<br />Reflective materials are mainly designed for domestic rock, equipment, technology in three tasks of technical problems. Major unprocessed trash use within reflective material, including resin, pigments, glass beads, etc., as raw material for that reflective product any performance impact essential. For instance, the adhesive resin need to have good workability, excellent bonding capabilities, there isn't a protection in case the surface layer of a product, the adhesive resin, aka permeability, washability, surface resin requires good transparency, good refractive index, excellent weather resistance and stability of your respective resin layers of access need to become a good complement the character of reflective material so that it will are eligible of your optical properties in the product, application requirements and manufacturing process requirements; for paint, high transparency must be used sex, hue stability, good compatibility with resin, for glass beads, necessitates a high refractive index, high transparency, low penetration rate of loss, good roundness, consistency and good size dispersion. Enormous industry, new materials civilized world, increased efforts to fit research, new materials, emerging, and foreign large-scale chemical enterprises to type in the factory, the raw material required reflective materials was largely resolved. Production gear is our industrial base to attain reflective materials, reflective materials, products of various equipment used varies with regards to the product process, process requirements, in addition to the characteristics among the rock familiar with discover appropriate device configuration accuracy, operation , determine an acceptable device structure. As well to consider the request in order to meet the production technology to offer the minimum equipment investment. Now, nearly several of development, equipment, production capacity has improved, however the device's design capabilities are determined by the reflective material or manufacturer, Berry was companyname's mailing address early development of kit by many manufacturers in order to and mimic, as reflective materials, equipment at your house to put a foundation. The present day special equipment from the processes reflective material configuration is reasonable, they do business with a laptop closed-loop feedback control to obtain synchronous operation frequency using constant tension control, adjustable temperature control sub-region, variable frequency constant pressure together with technical means, equipment operation and stability, coating drying ability, quality control, more stable, however amount of automation equipment to be further enhanced. Production process is and recycleables, production equipment, complementary, inseparable, due to the raw materials with the design of sulfur, to look for whether or not to meet the requirements of a production process, also to determine the production process, it are going to be possible without changing the material circumstances, seek could be implemented in your easiest and plenty of reliable procedure to process the fabrication line depending on different production processes, which has a volume of coating methods, making the various types, different properties of coatings can achieve micron-level precision with the controlled coating, can guarantee full format associated with the coating uniformity. The degree of domestic products, technology has reached the condition of foreign products, foreign products a lot of products much more in contrast to production process slimmer. China's standard two in order to 5 reflective materials, glass beads on the territory with the method of reflective material in domestic production has formed a comprehensive industrial chain, using a micro-prism type reflective film reflective film world only 3M, Avery, etc. holds several reflective materials related to core technology, our R &amp; D using this project has just entered phase, micro-prism reflective material on China's current energy production is treated for civilian purposes and less demanding traffic reflective film lattice, and then the creation of such product manufacturers generally smaller , nor really have to master the core technology of capital and capacity.

If a laser beam during a certain range to beads before contact any point associated with the surface, as a result high refraction for the beads within the beads following your condenser surface reflection layer, the lighting reflective layer parallel to the direction in the light rays reflected back. the organization of retro-reflective after the numbers of glass beads too reflection, bright images look while watching experiment revealed that if the refractive index of glass beads around 1.9, the lighting rays to well together from the rear surface of the glass beads, than the effect of retro-reflective best, when your refractive index of below or over 1.9, the incident charge lines were special discuss the away from glass microspheres and internal, the moment the retro-reflective effect will disappear. practical use by virtue of objective conditions. glass microspheres beads concerned with the refractive index is generally 1.9-2.1, and its diameter is invariably lower than 0.8 mm glass beads at the back if you convey a layer of reflective layer, then the return reflection effect would be greater. so magical glass micro- beads is the place where the development approach to production out of it that adheres to that: First the rock at quite high temperatures melt into liquid glass, liquid glass by using special nozzle to form a assortment of fog droplets, these droplets on the surface tension beneath action of automatic formation of your respective rules of spherical, then search through a cooling process, it is useful glass beads. With glass beads carryout a great number of return reflective material, most notably light-emitting fabric, reflective paint, reflective ink, etc. Using these materials range around the public security, traffic, fire, railroad, mining together with other departments inside PPE and civilian products are visible their presence. driver driving in the dark, simply because of opposite traffic lights, street lights, searchlight towers and advertising neon effect, quite likely going to cause traffic accidents, despite the fact that reflective material signs issued inside the lights of bright light exposure particularly eye-catching, to alert the trucker focus on the relevant traffic information, improve driving safety in rain, fog, wind together with low visibility conditions, reflective materials to improve highlight its value, numerous western world the availability of road and rail traffic signs, front and rear reflective material should be used, life-saving agency also provides international marine lifesaving equipment will be furnished with reflective material to facilitate night search and rescue work. Take a look at can discover why the traffic police, firefighters or other wore the uniform to a reflective material with your reflective tape on clothing or reflective signs warning drivers to push carefully and effectively help the safety for this wearer and now lots of firms are applying reflective materials to wear the products towards the beautiful, practical, with regards to the added security features. This magical reflective material in our production and life of many conveniences, there are lots of useless watching for him every bit of us love science, hard thinkers to build up.

Reflective materials industry in China nowadays have indeed made remarkable achievements, but on the field of reflective material, you will find still an empty entry, just like micro-prismatic reflective sheeting, high, precise, sharp reflective material products in the domestic quantity not make were satisfied. Reflective materials, production technology, R &amp; D technology has to be further enhanced. Other reflective material enterprise degrees of the scale aren't many, many small manufacturers, independent research and development capacity is weak, poor business management skills. Reflective material for the future market development will in the end require increasingly strong technical force, and further improve product quality, costs decline further, which has a higher demand in the enterprise belonging to the reflective material.
<br />The reflective material used as recycleables around the industrial field, industry by storm the rapid growth of information technology today, the reflective material companies and businesses have using the development trend of your Internet to enjoy the network card, from bid for that portal advertising to corporate website on the reflective material construction reflective material industry portal construction, in addition to by making usage of third-party e-commerce platform trade, has become a major trend for the times the reflective material industry, on top of reflective material and industry professionals platform landing stage within the Internet, marketing network for any reflective material to improve increased efficiency, but this field is just a start, network marketing tools sooner, the reflective material will probably be constantly updated and progress.

Work with a great related departments of public security and traffic, traffic supervision, fire, railroad, coal, civil reflective material, reflective fabric, reflective lattice piece, reflective printing cloth.
<br />China's vast territory, large population, inside the above market situation analysis, plus body reflective logo over a Secretary of state for Public Security promulgated new standards, requiring large trucks are affixed reflective logo, annual demand reflective film inside the millions of square feet if not more. Greater civilian reflective material markets, could have been immeasurable. However, for several years, the reflective material market imported products, the monopoly, especially high-strength grade reflective sheeting. Reflective film with good technical content of imported products at high prices in China to offer, get the great deal of profit. Lot of currency exchange expenditure, restricting the promotion and applying reflective sheeting, which formed an incredible contrast into the rapid growth and development of China's national economy, the creation of China's national economy, particularly the continuing growth of traffic safety factors are very unfavorable. Therefore, the localization of the reflective film to snap the monopoly of foreign products, import substitution, lower the value of the promotion and utilizing the reflective film to grow the roll-out of traffic safety engineering, get hold of, to enhance the development of central and western underdeveloped components of traffic safety engineering, it is extremely necessary. Indeed, the role of reflective sheeting products can't replaced in neuro-scientific transportation security, has long been a person's eye of society in total, much the concern of this national industrial policy, support and assistance. National Technology Commission, Secretary of state for Communications, Ministry of Light Industry has repeatedly projects to a target projects to let the advancement directional reflective film products. State Planning Commission, State Economic and Trade Commission will also be involved in the two committees jointly issued the &quot;current national concentration on encouraging enhancing that is a, products and technologies catalog&quot; in Article 5 highway project development and production of new materials catalog, in China 10 The five &quot;high-tech industry development in key special planning as a&quot; 12 key projects, &quot;Nine due to microelectronic, optoelectronic materials, these reveal that the localization for this reflective film in keeping with national industrial policy.
