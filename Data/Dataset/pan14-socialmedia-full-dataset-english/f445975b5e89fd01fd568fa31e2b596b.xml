<br /><br />A young nurse appears to give him a partial sponge bath.
<br />&quot;Nurse&quot;, he mumbles, from behind the mask, &quot;Are my testicles black?&quot; Embarrassed, the young nurse replies, &quot;I don't know, Sir, I'm only here to wash your upper body and feet.&quot;
<br /><br />He struggles to ask again,&quot;Nurse, are my testicles black?&quot;
<br />Concerned that he might elevate his vitals from worry about histesticles, she overcomes her embarrassment and sheepishly pulls back the covers.
<br />She raises his gown, holds his penis in one hand and
<br />carefully takes his testicles in the other, lifting and moving them around.
<br />Then she takes a close look, and gently replaces his gown and bedding. 
<br />&quot;There's nothing wrong with them, Sir.&quot;
<br /><br />With difficulty, the man pulls off his oxygen mask, smiles at her and says slowly, &quot;Thank you very much. That was really wonderful, but, listen very, very closely. ARE-MY-TEST-RESULTS-BACK?&quot;

<br /><br />The first dwarf, however, is unable to get an erection. His depression is made worse by the fact that, from the next room, he hears his little friend shouting out cries of &quot;Here I come again ONE, TWO,THREE...UUH!&quot; all night long. 
<br /><br />In the morning, the second dwarf asks the first, &quot;How did It go?&quot; 
<br />The first mutters, &quot;It was so embarrassing. I simply couldn't get an erection.&quot; 
<br /><br />The second dwarf shook his head. &quot;You think that's embarrassing? I couldn't even get on the bed!&quot;

<br /><br />A man buys several sheep, hoping to breed them for wool. After several weeks, he notices that none of the sheep are getting pregnant, and calls a vet for help. The vet tells him that he should try artificial insemination. 
<br />The guy doesn't have the slightest idea what this means but not wanting to display his ignorance, only asks the vet how he will know when the sheep are pregnant. The vet tells him that they will stop standing around and will lie down and wallow in the grass. 
<br /><br />The man hangs up and gives it some thought. He comes to the conclusion that artificial insemination means he has to impregnate the sheep. So, he loads the sheep into his truck, drives them out into the woods, has sex with them all, brings them back, and goes to bed. 
<br /><br />The next morning, he wakes and looks out at the sheep. Seeing that they are all still standing around, he concludes that the first try didn't take, and loads them in the truck again. He drives them out to the woods, bangs each sheep twice for good measure, brings them back, and goes to bed. 
<br /><br />The next morning he wakes to find the sheep still just standing around. One more try, he tells himself, and proceeds to load them up and drive them out to the woods. He spends all day shagging the sheep and upon returning home, falls listlessly into bed. 
<br /><br />The next morning, he cannot even raise himself from the bed to look at the sheep. He asks his wife to look out and tell him if the sheep are lying in the grass. 
<br /><br />&quot;No,&quot; she says, &quot;they're all in the truck and one of them is honking the horn.&quot;

<br /><br />The officer asks her for her license and registration. She says, &quot;License, what´s that?&quot;
<br /><br />He replies, &quot;It´s what they ask for when you buy liquor.&quot;
<br /><br />She says, &quot;Oh, I get it,&quot; and hands him her license.
<br /><br />Then she asks what a registration is. He says, &quot;It´s probably in your glove box. Just open it and give me the papers inside.&quot; She does, so he returns to his car.
<br /><br />He calls the police dispatcher and says, &quot;I think I just pulled over the dumbest blonde ever! She didn´t even know what a license was.&quot;
<br /><br />The dispatcher says, &quot;I know who she is. She´s driving a new BMW, with pink mirrors.&quot;
<br /><br />The cop says, &quot;Yeah, how´d you know?&quot;
<br /><br />The dispatcher says, &quot;Never mind that, just go up to her car and drop your pants.&quot;
<br /><br />The cop says, &quot;No freakin´ way!&quot;
<br /><br />The dispatcher says, &quot;Just trust me, all the cops in town have done it.&quot;
<br /><br />So the cop agrees and reluctantly walks up to her car. He looks around and then drops his pants.
<br /><br />The blonde woman says, &quot;Another breathalyser test? No problem, I pass these all the time.&quot;

<br />glass of champagne. The woman perks up and says, &quot;How about that? I just ordered a glass of champagne, too!&quot; 
<br /><br />&quot;What a coincidence,&quot; he said, &quot;This is a special day for me, I'm 
<br />celebrating.&quot; 
<br /><br />&quot;This is a special day for me, too, and I'm also celebrating!,&quot; says the 
<br />woman. 
<br /><br />&quot;What a coincidence,&quot; says the man. As they clinked glasses he asked, &quot;What are you celebrating?&quot; 
<br /><br />&quot;My husband and I have been trying to have a child, and today my 
<br />gynaecologist told me I'm pregnant!&quot; 
<br /><br />&quot;What a coincidence,&quot; says the man. &quot;I'm a chicken farmer. For years all my hens were infertile, but today they're finally laying fertilized eggs.&quot; 
<br /><br />&quot;That's great!&quot; says the woman, &quot;How did your chickens become fertile?&quot; 
<br /><br />&quot;I switched cocks,&quot; he replied. 
<br /><br />She smiled and said, &quot;What a coincidence!&quot;

On his orientation tour he noticed a very old, seedy looking camel tied out back of the enlisted mens barracks. He asked the Sergeant leading the tour, &quot;What's the camel for?&quot;. 
<br /><br />The Sergeant replied &quot;Well sir it's a long way from anywhere, and the men have natural sexual urges, so when they do, uh, we have the camel.&quot; 
<br /><br />The captain said &quot;Well if it's good for moral, then I guess it's all right with me.&quot; 
<br /><br />After he had been at the fort for about 6 months the captain could not stand it any more so he told his Sergeant, &quot;BRING IN THE CAMEL!!!&quot; 
<br /><br />The sarge shrugged his shoulders and led the camel into the captains quarters. The captain got a foot stool &amp; proceeded to have vigorous sex with the camel. As he stepped, satisfied, down from the stool, and was buttoning his pants he asked the Sergeant, &quot;Is that how the enlisted men do it?&quot; 
<br /><br />The Sergeant replied, &quot;Well sir, they usually just use it to ride into fucking town.&quot;

<br /><br />She told Little johnny, &quot;The bigger they are the dumber the person is.&quot; 
<br /><br />Little johnny, pleased with the answer, goes to play in the ocean but returns to tell his mother that many of the men have larger willies than his dad. His mother replied, &quot;The bigger they are the dumber the person is.&quot; 
<br /><br />Again satisfied with this answer, the boy returns to the ocean to play.
