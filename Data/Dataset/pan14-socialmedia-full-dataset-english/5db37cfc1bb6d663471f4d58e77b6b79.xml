Players have voiced concerns over the disparity between the money earned by stars who reach the latter stages of grand slams and those who exit in the early rounds. British newspaper the Sunday Times reported that they were planning to start a rebel event, possibly in Dubai, if pay is not increased for the Melbourne tournament in January. But the ATP, which represents the interests of male players, has denied it would help players in organize any such action. &quot;The ATP has been clear and repetitive in telling players that it will no.<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5sb3Vib3V0aW5zcGFzY2hlci5mci8_" target="_blank">louboutin pas cher</a> ot organize a boycott,&quot; it said in a statement. &quot;Instead, ATP Management and players have taken a diplomatic approach this year with the grand slams to address player compensation issues. &quot;The grand slams are important events that generate significant revenues, and the players who perform there should share in an acceptable percentage of those revenues like they do on the ATP World Tour.&quot; How 'Big Four' earned a pay rise for tennis colleagues The Australian Open, held in Melbourne every January, is one of four grand slams in tennis -- along with the French and U.S. Opens and Wimbledon..louboutin In 2012, first-round losers at the year's first major tournament were given $21,600, compared to $22,500 in France and $23,000 in the U.S. and Britain -- the latter three having increased by 20%. The biggest disparity is in Australia, which has the highest prize purse and biggest winner's check of almost $2.4 million. &quot;We are pleased that the discussions initiated by the ATP with each of the grand slams this year have resulted in certain prize money increases for players in 2012,<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5sb3Vib3V0aW5zcGFzY2hlci5mci8_" target="_blank">christian louboutin pas cher</a> &quot; the men's ruling body said. &quot;We remain focused on our active dialogue with these events about player compensation .christian louboutin pas cher or 2013 and beyond. The players remain unified and passionate about this issue.&quot; Australian Open boss Craig Tiley, in New York for the U.S. Open which began on Monday, attempted to quell boycott fears. &quot;We are the first to say that for tennis to be a viable career, the top 250 players need to make a good living,&quot; he told Australian news agency AAP. &quot;The top 250 players in tennis make about a quarter of the amount of money in tennis as they do in golf. So that could be a good benchmark for us. And the PGA Tour's prize money has increased more than the ATP Tour's has, so we have to address that too. &quot;Our relationship with the playing group is very, very strong. It's in everyone's interests (not to strike). We're very confident that whatever needs to be resolved will be.&quot;

Malaga, BATE Borisov and Dinamo Zagreb were the other teams to progress to Thursday's group draw in Monaco. With nine minutes to go in Belgium, Anderlecht and AEL Limassol were locked at 0-0, and the Cypriot side were going through. Then, Dieudonne <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5sb3Vib3V0aW5zcGFzY2hlci5mci8_" target="_blank">louboutin pas cher</a> Mbokani stepped forward to notch his second goal of the tie and give the Belgian champions hope of making it through. With one minute to go, the Belgians finally made their pressure count when substitute Olexandr Yakovenko scored to send his side through to the main draw. In Italy, Braga managed to produce a similar escape act against Udinese.<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5sb3Vib3V0aW5zcGFzY2hlci5mci8_" target="_blank">christian louboutin pas cher</a>  The first leg had finished 1-1, with Braga unlucky to not have a clear lead to bring to north east Italy. The home side looked determined to make their Portugese opponents pay for t.louboutin pas cher heir lack of a cutting edge in the first game and were deserved leaders at half time. Pablo Armero had given his side the lead after some fine work from Dusan Basta on the right wing. In he 72nd minute, substitute Ruben Micael capped of a fine second half recovery from Braga with an equalizer that set the match on course for a tense penalty shoot out that would decide who progressed to Thursday's draw and reap the financial rewards that accompany a place in the tournaments latter stages. Udinese's Brazilian midfielder Maicoseul was the player to make a name for himself in the worst possible way. His disastrous attempt at a delicate chipped penalty landed comfortably in the arms of Braga goalkeeper Beto, and proved to be the only missed penalty off the night. The Udinese players were shaki.louboutin ng their heads in disbelief as Micael celebrated scoring the winning penalty that saw Braga advance and Udinese go out in the final qualifying round for the second year running. Spanish side Malaga confirmed their first ever appearance in the Champions League group stage with a 0-0 draw in Athens that ensured their first leg victory took them through. Panathinaikos had given themselves a difficult task after leaking two goals in the first leg, and the early exchanges made it clear that the Spanish side wanted to kill the game off with any early goal. The Greek side did their best to return the attacks, but as the game wore on Malaga became more comfortable to sit back and keep the ball and limit their opponent's opportunities. Malaga have endured a miserable start to the season, seeing a number o.christian louboutin pas cher f key players move to other clubs and its owner, Qatari investor Abdullah bin Nasser bin Abdullah Al Ahmed Al Thani, take a step back from his previous committed involvement, and will hope that advancing to Europe's premier competition will help them get their season back on track. Belarussian side BATE Borisov comfortably progressed with a 1-1 draw against Israeli side Hapoel Kiryat Shmona that gave them a winning aggregate margin of 3-1. BATE became the first Belarussian side to make the group stage in the 2008-09 season, and will be hoping to improve on their record of two draws and four losses in this year's competition. Croatian side Dinamo Zagreb advanced with the same scoreline over two legs, enjoying a 1-0 over Maribor to advance to the group stage for the second successive season. A goal from Portuguese defender Tonel in the 12th minute ended Slovenian side's chances of upsetting Dinamo, and they will now have to settle for a place in this year's Europa League.

Robson, who recently won silver in the mixed doubles at the London Olympics, is currently ranked 89th in the world wasn't expected to pose much of a challenge to the three time U.S. Open champion, but the Belgian struggled to find an answer to Robson's impressive serve. To put Clijsters success in New York in perspective, Robson was only nine years old when the Belgian last lost a match at the tournament. Clijsters has 41 tour titles to her name, behind only the Williams sisters off players still active, while Robson is yet to claim her first tournament victory. Robson will now face ninth seeded Na Li in the second round Top seed Victoria Azarenka breezed through her second round match against Kirsten Flipkens, taking only 27 minutes to record a 6-2, 6-2 victory. Azarenka, the reigning Australian Open champion, certainly sent out a mes.louboutin pas cher sage to her rivals with a dominant display that totally overawed 26 year old Flipkens. &quot;I think it was another good performance today,&quot; Azarenka explained to the U.S. Open website. &quot;I think that Grand Slams are the toughest ones to play for sure,&quot; she added. &quot;It wasn't as easy maybe as the score was, but I think I played well. I always take it match by match no matter where it is, whatever my ranking is. I have been doing it for pretty much my whole career.&quot; Azarenka goes on to meet Chinese 28 seed Jie Zheng, and will be hopeful of progressing to the U.S. Open fourth round for the first time since 2007. &quot;It will be definitely a big challenge. She can definitely show good tennis, and I kind of need to step it up in the later rounds coming up. I'm looking forward to play against her.&quot; Joining Azarenka in the third round is the little known American Mallory Burdette. Still listed as an amateur, Burdette is unable to accept any of her prize money -- currently standing at $65,000 -- a.<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.louboutinspascher.fr%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.louboutinspascher.fr/</a> she would forfeit her place at Stanford University by becoming a professional athlete. &quot;I have already checked the amateur box, so if I know correctly, you can't go back once the tournament starts. So it's done,&quot; she confessed to the tournament website. &quot;At this point, I'm used to giving the money up, I think the money goes straight back to the tournaments if I don't declare it, so they probably love me at this point!&quot; Burdette was encouraged to sample the pro tour by Stanford tennis coach Lele Forood &quot;I wasn't sure if I even wanted to play tennis as a career, but Lele was so supportive and encouraged me to give it a shot,&quot; she explained. &quot;I wasn't sure if I even wanted to play tennis as a career, but Lele was so supportive and encouraged me to give it a shot. &quot;I really want to be a psychiatrist. So I was interested in med school. I would have finished up my degree and I would have gone to some type of program where I could take all my pre-med requirements and then .christian louboutin pas cher hopefully go to med school. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5sb3Vib3V0aW5zcGFzY2hlci5mci8_" target="_blank">louboutin pas cher</a> &quot;I had given that a lot of thought at the beginning of the summer and I was preparing for that. I still am in a lot of ways, but my success this summer has kind of taken me in a different path a little bit. So I think my focus will be a little bit different when I go back to school.&quot; Burdette, ranked 254 in the world, will most likely meet third seed Maria Sharapova in the fourth round, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5sb3Vib3V0aW5zcGFzY2hlci5mci8_" target="_blank">christian louboutin pas cher</a> if the French Open champion meets expectations and overcomes Lourdes Dominguez Lino in their third round match up. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5sb3Vib3V0aW5zcGFzY2hlci5mci8_" target="_blank"><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.louboutinspascher.fr%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.louboutinspascher.fr/</a></a> Sixth seed Petra Kvitova enjoyed a relatively comfortable work out on Louis Armstrong Court, as she beat Frenchwoman Alize Cornet in straight sets, 6-4, 6-4. The Czech, who won her maiden Grand Slam at last year's Wimbledon Championships, took just 78 minutes to beat the one time world number 11. Number 19 seed Nadia Petrova easily beat world number 53 Simona Halep, cruising to a 6-1, 6-1 that will see her face Lucie Safarova in the third round. Safarova, the 15th seed, had a testing second round against Canadian Aleksandra Wozniak. After splitting the first two sets, the Czech number two was able to find something extra in her game to seal a 6-3, 4-6, 6-2 win.

		<document id="3d4d4cfcf68e8b47baaddb42ad189424" url=""><![CDATA[louboutin pas cher Republicans found a<br/><br/> he second night of the Republican National Convention in Tampa featured speeches by Mitt Romney's running mate, Rep. Paul Ryan, and by former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who served former President George W. Bush. CNN contributors and analysts offered these assessments of the evening: Maria Cardona: Ryan distorts the truth; <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5sb3Vib3V0aW5zcGFzY2hlci5mci8_" target="_blank">louboutin pas cher</a> Rice counts on short memories Paul Ryan knocked it out of the park from a rhetorical standpoint and brought down the house as expected. Great line about what was on his iPod versus what was on Mitt Romney's. Great play for the youth vote! But it was disappointing to see him continue the tremendous distortion about President Barack Obama cutting Medicare,<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5sb3Vib3V0aW5zcGFzY2hlci5mci8_" target="_blank">christian louboutin pas cher</a> when his own plan calls for the same cuts that will actually reduce benefits for seniors. We heard continued criticisms but no real solutions. He said he would keep our spending to 20% of GDP but didn't outline what programs he would cut to get us there. Perhaps we already know why. We have his blueprint in the Ryan Budget, which does nothing for middle-class families except make them bear the brunt of the tax cuts he would give wealthy Americans. Ryan talked about moral creed, but his budget slashes programs aimed at protecting those that he said we have an obligation to protect. If that is the RomneyRyan American dream, then voters -- young, old, middle class, African-American, Latinos and women -- would do well to say thanks, but we'll keep our hope and change even if it takes four more years to get there. Three things struck me about Condoleezza Rice's speech. First she mentions the 911 terror attack, which is a big risk reminding voters it was actually Obama who ordered the capture and killing of Osama bin Laden. She also mentioned the nation's debt, perhaps hoping voters would not remember it was actually her boss' tax cuts, two wars and a Medicare prescription drug plan, all unpaid for, that added to that debt and plunged the country into deep deficits. Then she mentioned immigration in the context of having to find a way to be more compassionate. This may have been an effort to erase for Latino voters the strident, offensive language on immigration and immigrants that Romney (his &quot;self-deportation&quot; fix, for one thing) and the GOP have adopted in recent years. It certainly won't be enough. Maria Cardona is a Democratic strategist, a principal at the Dewey Square Group, a former senior adviser to Hillary Clinton and former communications director for the Democratic National Committee. Opinion: Paul Ryan a true son of Janesville, Wisconsin Erick Erickson: Ryan a 'hard guy to paint as spooky' Here's a fact about political campaigns: In close elections, parties often take the gamble that elections are base elections, i.e., they win by turning out their base, which they conclude is larger than the other guy's. Right now, the Democrats have concluded that their base is larger than the Republicans, and they want a.louboutin pas cher base election. The way to get the base out -- and not the independents, who most, if not all, polls show are going for the GOP -- is to go negative. The Democrats have every incentive to make this election as nasty as possible. The Obama campaign website claims that Mitt Romney wants to send women back to the 1950s. A liberal group runs commercials showing a Paul Ryan lookalike shoving a grandmother in a wheelchair off a cliff. Ryan's job was to get independents comfortable with Romney-Ryan. His goal was to tell independents that it was OK for them to vote for Barack Obama in a historic election and it is OK to like him now but want a new man in the White House. He excelled. His rhetoric was not as high as Condoleezza Rice's speech, but he hit the high notes, related well and made it about the lessons he learned from his mom (carefully pointing out she was on Medicare as he expected to be). Ryan is a hard guy to paint as spooky. He is a good-looking, charming guy with a good-looking, charming family. He's got youth but relates to older people. The Obama campaign has failed, over several weeks, to define him and will now regret that choice. Ryan hit all the right notes and defined himself as a compassionate guy with a plan to fix problems. The one problem His existence on the campaign trail continues to make him more consequential than the actual presidential nominee. Right now though, the GOP doesn't care. Erick Erickson is the editor of the conservative blog RedState and a CNN political contributor. Hilary Rosen: Ryan speech short on ideas and misleading on Obama Rep. Paul Ryan was supposed to be the smart addition to the ticket -- the one full of great ideas and policy truths. Unfortunately, his speech to the Republican convention Wednesday night was short on policy ideas and anything but truthful. -- He told a story he knows to be untrue about a GM plant closing after the president had promised to keep it open, yet the plant actually closed when George W. Bush was president. CNN fact check: Did Ryan get Obama's GM speech right -- He criticized the president for rejecting the conclusions of his budget commission, yet didn't say that Ryan himself was on the commission and voted against the recommendations. -- He complained about the deficit but neglected to mention his multiple votes over the years in Congress for things such as unlimited and off-budget war appropriations and tax cuts for the wealthy that have produced record deficits. -- He attacked Obama for cutting $700 billion out of Medicare (though the Obama plan puts some of the savings from cutting fraud back into actual health care), yet he neglected to admit that his own plan does the same thing. Ryan offered no policy prescriptions for a new economy. He obfuscated his own record and deliberately misled the country about Obama's record. Tonight was his introductio.<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.louboutinspascher.fr%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.louboutinspascher.fr/</a> n to America -- a chance to showcase how Mitt Romney was creating a new guide to the future. This is the next generation Republican leader Judging from the reaction, I don't think the country was impressed. Hilary Rosen, a CNN contributor, is a Democratic political strategist and former chief executive of the Recording Industry Association of America. 'Gen Xer' Paul Ryan takes up GOP torch, makes case to young voters David Gergen: Have Republicans found a young Reagan The delegates here in Tampa loved Ann Romney Tuesday night and loved Condi Rice Wednesday night. But Paul Ryan delivered the speech they have been longing for, and they exploded in enthusiasm. Conservatives will surely wonder whether they have found a young Reagan. On the biggest stage of his life, Ryan spoke with the assurance, clarity and humor of a man of far more experience. He understood that the best way to make an effective indictment of President Barack Obama was to tell a story, and he did that well. As a CNN focus group said after, he seemed to do it as well without scaring people as an extremist. Democrats will rightly take him on next week as they have sharply different views of how to create a fair and growing society. The press will rightly check his facts. Critics will rightly charge that he didn't spell out the Romney-Ryan economic plan. But Ryan accomplished something important: he pushed the debate onto a higher plane where we might get a more serious conversation about the tough, tough choices ahead. David Gergen is a senior political analyst for CNN and has been an adviser to four presidents. A graduate of Harvard Law School, he is a professor of public service and director of the Center for Public Leadership at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government. Follow him on Twitter. Reihan Salam: Rice and Martinez make the strongest impression It is striking that the standouts of the Republican National Convention so far -- Condoleezza Rice, the African-American Stanford political scientist who served as secretary of state during George W. Bush's second term; and Susana Martinez, the first Latina governor of New Mexico -- represent what remains a very white, very Anglo party. For Republicans looking to the future, this is very good news indeed. Though many GOP stalwarts lamented their weak 2012 presidential field, the last two days have demonstrated that the party has a very deep bench. While Paul Ryan gave an extremely effective, politically savvy speech, it is Rice and Martinez who made the strongest impression, and who seemed to demonstrate that the Republican party is broad, inclusive, and forward-looking. Though it's hard to tell if this year's RNC will do anything to change hardened public perceptions, its selection of speakers has been almost unbelievably good. Reihan Salam, a CNN contributor, is a writer for the National .christian louboutin pas cher Review's &quot;The Agenda&quot; blog; a columnist for Reuters Opinion; a policy advisor for e21, a non-partisan economic research group; and co-author of &quot;Grand New Party: How Conservatives Can Win the Working Class and Save the American Dream.&quot; Ryan's speech gives undecided voters mild nudge toward Romney William Bennett: Ryan makes a strong case against Obama's record Last night, Paul Ryan introduced himself to the American people with a profound display of youthfulness, optimism, and authority -- authority that comes from an unquestionable knowledge of the economy and budget but also from having lived life and worked hard. He delivered the convention's first searing line-by-line indictment of the Obama record in a tough, powerful, yet appealing and sympathetic way. During his time in the House, Ryan relied heavily on statistics, charts, and wonky graphs, of which he had unparalleled expertise. But last night's speech was something more. He made a philosophical case against the President's record with emotional appeal and real life, relatable examples, like the following: &quot;College graduates should not have to live out their 20s in their childhood bedrooms, staring up at fading Obama posters and wondering when they can move out and get going with life.&quot; I've known Paul Ryan very well through the years, starting when he worked for me at Empower America. He has had a remarkable tenure in the House. When he was picked by Mitt Romney to be Vice President I thought he would be good, but I didn't know how good. Last night he was great, and chances are he will only get better. William J. Bennett, a CNN contributor, is the author of &quot;The Book of Man: Readings on the Path to Manhood.&quot; He was U.S. secretary of education from 1985 to 1988 and director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy under President George H.W. Bush. Ruben Navarrette: Ryan does what Romney can't Paul Ryan is Joe Biden -- without the gaffes and with a good head on his shoulders. That was my takeaway as I watched Ryan's powerful speech Wednesday night accepting the Republican nomination for vice president. In 2008, Barack Obama chose Biden as his running mate because the Harvard Law School graduate who seemed aloof and unable to relate to the concerns of everyday Americans felt he needed a running mate who understood the lunch bucket crowd. This year, Mitt Romney -- another Harvard Law School graduate who is often accused of not being able to relate to everyday Americans -- chose Ryan for much the same reason. Romney needed someone who could go before the American people and do something that Romney has -- in two presidential elections -- been unable to do for all his success in business: explain in plain language what's broken and how his party's values and his expertise can fix it and show everyday Americans that he understands their plight and knows how to keep government from making it worse. That's what the 42-year-old son of Janesville, Wisconsin, needed to do with this, the most important speech of his political career. Well, to borrow a phrase: Mission accomplished.
