<br /><br />&quot;Jessy you love me don't you&quot; a smile; his
<br />Their breathe spirts weep
<br />&quot;Daddy you know i do; what is it?&quot;
<br />He smiles at his friend; his hand creeps
<br /><br />His friend takes my hand; looks me in the eyes
<br />Daddys creeping up my nightie; cold hands
<br />I try to pull his hand away;
<br />their grip is strong!
<br />They look at one another; nod; something planned
<br /><br />I feel my palms sweat; Daddys under my knickers
<br />&quot;Daddy im going to bed! Night&quot; Pulling again
<br />But there grip is to strong for weak me
<br />I look at both; and ask, who are these men?
<br /><br />His fingers going up me; pulling away
<br />His friend leans forward; a kiss? Why?
<br />His toungue moving mine; my eyes squint
<br />Lean back and away; &quot;Why are you doing this?&quot;
<br />No answer, i feel the pain inside me; him
<br />Chucks the quilt on the floor; me to
<br />I try and scamper away, but im not fast
<br />&quot;O Daddy please, i love you&quot;
<br /><br />His friend; pulling at my nightie
<br />And my Dad pulling my pants down
<br />His friend pinning my hands to the floor
<br />As my Dad lies himself on the ground
<br /><br />I squirm; as Daddy friend pulls me up
<br />And places me ontop of Daddy; thrusts within
<br />I cry; i bite; i scratch; i slap; i fail
<br />&quot;O Daddy please you win you win!&quot;
<br /><br />I can feel my skin rip; my virginity breaking free
<br />I can feel the blood seep down my leg
<br />&quot;Daddy your hurting me please&quot;
<br />I plead to him and his friend; not even a beg
<br /><br />Daddys laughing; why does he laugh?
<br />His friend shoves himself in my mouth and moans
<br />Tieing my hands together; moving in and out
<br />&quot;Ride me Jessy&quot; He laughs and groans
<br /><br />They smile at one another; laugh to
<br />They roll me over and spread me wide well
<br />My daddy sits on my face; himself in again
<br />While his friend talks and pushes himself inside
<br /><br />I can hardly breathe; i gag for air
<br />I cough and splutter; cry and weep
<br />I beg and plead; but its no use
<br />Theyve already made me hurt and bleed
<br /><br />I stare into his eyes; that look upon me
<br />This is not my Dad; where is he?
<br />If he was still here; would he care
<br />Would he actually even; see?
<br /><br />Finally they get of and lie me on the sofa
<br />My cheeks blouchy from tears and pain
<br />They play with them selfs; all over me
<br />Rub it in; making me feel the shame
<br /><br />&quot;Why Daddy? Please tell me why?&quot;
<br />Dad looks at his friend; and waves him away
<br />&quot;Jessy i love you&quot; he smiles and kisses my cheek
<br />&quot;Is that all you have in your heart to say?&quot;
<br /><br />He puts my nightie on me
<br />he walks me to my bedroom door
<br />Ever since that night; His friend
<br />And himself every Friday come back for more
<br /><br />&quot;Night sweet Girl; You are my life&quot;
<br />Closing the door, tears still down my face
<br />Still the smell of him and his friend
<br />Fade into me like disgrace
<br /><br />I watch the Moon go down; the sun come up
<br />&quot;Jessy its school&quot; Knocking at my door
<br />I cant help but cry; weep in pain
<br />Because im so scared he wanted more
<br /><br />But one night daddy took it too far
<br />Daddy and his friend came back for one last shot
<br />They were worried they would get caught
<br />So he and his friend took me to a cemetary lot
<br /><br />I was blindfolded and my hands were tied back
<br />&quot;Daddy please!! Not tonight!&quot;
<br />Daddy and his friend both had their last fun
<br />After that i tried to put up a fight
<br /><br />I begged daddy &quot;Please no more!&quot;
<br />All he could say &quot;Shut up, you stupid Bitch!&quot;
<br />Daddy unblindfolded me at last
<br />He said I love you so much
<br /><br />He went back into the car and pulled out a bat
<br />&quot;Daddy I swear I wont say a thing!!!!&quot;
<br />I was dead
<br />After only one swing..........................

<br /><br />other boys
<br /><br />his age rather
<br /><br />curious.
<br /><br />He had been hearing quite a bit
<br /><br />about 'making out'
<br /><br />from the older boys, and he wondered
<br /><br />what it was
<br /><br />and how it was done.
<br /><br />One day he took his question to his
<br /><br />mother, who
<br /><br />became rather flustered. Instead of
<br /><br />explaining
<br /><br />things to Johnny, she told him to hide
<br /><br />behind the
<br /><br />curtains one night and watch his older
<br /><br />sister and
<br /><br />her boyfriend.
<br /><br />This he did. The following morning,
<br /><br />Johnny
<br /><br />described EVERYTHING to his mother.
<br /><br />&quot;Sis and her boyfriend sat and talked for
<br /><br />a while,
<br /><br />then he turned off most of the lights.
<br /><br />Then he
<br /><br />started kissing and hugging her. I
<br /><br />figured 'Sis must
<br /><br />be getting sick, because her face started
<br /><br />looking
<br /><br />funny.
<br /><br />He must have thought so too, because he
<br /><br />put his
<br /><br />hand inside her blouse to feel her heart,
<br /><br />just the
<br /><br />way the doctor would. Except he's not as
<br /><br />smart as
<br /><br />the doctor because he seemed to have
<br /><br />trouble
<br /><br />finding her heart. I guess he was getting
<br /><br />sick too,
<br /><br />because pretty soon both of them started
<br /><br />panting
<br /><br />and getting all out of breath.
<br /><br />His other hand must have been cold
<br /><br />because he
<br /><br />put it under her skirt.
<br /><br />About this time 'Sis got worse and began
<br /><br />to moan
<br /><br />and sigh and squirm around and slide
<br /><br />down
<br /><br />toward
<br /><br />the end of the couch. This was when her
<br /><br />fever
<br /><br />started. I knew it was a fever, because Sis
<br /><br />told him
<br /><br />she felt really hot.
<br /><br />Finally, I found out what was making
<br /><br />them so
<br /><br />sick......-a big eel ;had gotten inside his
<br /><br />pants
<br /><br />somehow. It just jumped out of his pants
<br /><br />and
<br /><br />stood there, about 10 inches long,
<br /><br />honest, anyway
<br /><br />he grabbed it in one hand to keep it from
<br /><br />getting
<br /><br />away.
<br /><br />When Sis saw it, she got really scared-her
<br /><br />eyes
<br /><br />got big, and her mouth fell open, and
<br /><br />she started
<br /><br />calling out to God and stuff like that. She
<br /><br />said it
<br /><br />was the biggest one she's ever seen; I
<br /><br />should tell
<br /><br />her about the ones down at the lake by
<br /><br />our house!
<br /><br />Anyway, Sis got brave and tried to kill the
<br /><br />eel by
<br /><br />biting its head off.The eel spit on her face
<br /><br />a little bit and then, All of a sudden she
<br /><br />grabbed it
<br /><br />with both hands and held it tight while he
<br /><br />took a
<br /><br />muzzle out of his pocket and slipped it
<br /><br />over the
<br /><br />eel's head to keep it from biting again.
<br /><br />Sis lay back and spread her legs so she
<br /><br />could get
<br /><br />a scissor-lock on it and he helped by lying
<br /><br />on top
<br /><br />of the eel. The eel put up a hell of a
<br /><br />fight.
<br /><br />Sis started groaning and squealing and
<br /><br />her
<br /><br />boyfriend almost upset the couch. I guess
<br /><br />they
<br /><br />wanted to kill the eel by squashing it
<br /><br />between
<br /><br />them.
<br /><br />After a while they both quit moving and
<br /><br />gave a
<br /><br />great sigh. Her boyfriend got up, and sure
<br /><br />enough,
<br /><br />they killed the eel. I knew because it just
<br /><br />hung
<br /><br />there, limp, and some of its insides were
<br /><br />hanging
<br /><br />out.
<br /><br />Sis and her boyfriend were a little tired
<br /><br />from the
<br /><br />battle, but they went back to courting
<br /><br />anyway. He
<br /><br />started hugging and kissing her again. By
<br /><br />golly,
<br /><br />the eel wasn't dead! It jumped straight up
<br /><br />and
<br /><br />started to fight again.
<br /><br />I guess eels are like cats- they have nine
<br /><br />lives or
<br /><br />something. This time, Sis jumped up and
<br /><br />tried to
<br /><br />kill it by sitting on it. After about a 35
<br /><br />minute
<br /><br />struggle, they finally killed the eel. I knew
<br /><br />it was
<br /><br />dead, because I saw Sis's boyfriend peel
<br /><br />its skin
<br /><br />off and flush it down the toilet.
<br /><br />Now that you've read it, post it and have
<br /><br />goodluck
<br /><br />in &quot;gettin' sum&quot; forever...Ignore it, and U
<br /><br />will
<br /><br />have a

<br />Guy: No, this is fun
<br />Girl: No it's not. Please it's too scary!
<br />Guy: Then tell me you love me.
<br />Girl: Fine I love you. Slow down!
<br />Guy: Now give me a BIG hug.
<br />Girl: hugs him
<br />Guy: Can you take my helmet off and put it on yourself? It's bugging me.
<br />(in the paper the next day): A motorcycle had crashed into a building because of brake failure. Two people were on it, but only 1 had survived. The truth was that halfway down the road, the guy realized that his brakes broke, but he didn't want to let the girl know. Instead, he had her say she loved him and felt her hug one last time, then he had her wear his helmet so that she would live even though it meant that he would die.
<br /><br />If u love any one this much...let them know...before its too late... I love you 4 ever.....and always 2 the end....i cant live without you.....Bcuz ur my friend..... Send this to 10 ppl in the next 5 min....and....u will get kissed on friday by the love of your life.XX

<br />I can't look at myself.
<br />I can't feel any better.
<br />Everything's fading.
<br />I don't know why.
<br />I want you to know,
<br />That it wasn't a lie.
<br />It meant everything.
<br />Those words I spoke.
<br />But you lead me on.
<br />It was all a joke.
<br />I don't know how,
<br />Things got this way.
<br />I didn't used to be,
<br />The way I am today.
<br />I hope you remember,
<br />What you did to me.

<br />But here's my fair well,
<br />You won't see me again.

With you, what you see is what you get. You have no patience for flirting and can't be bothered with someone who is trying to be coy, cute, demure, and subtly enticing. You are an up front person. When it comes to sex, it's action that counts not obscure hints. ! Your mate's physical attractiveness is important to you. You find the chase and challenge of the &quot;hunt&quot; invigorating. You are passionate and sexual as well as being much more adventurous than you appear; however, you do not go around advertising these qualities. Your physical needs are your primary concern.
<br /><br />B - You give off vibes of lazy sensuality. You enjoy being romanced, wined, and dined. You are very happy to receive gifts as an expression of the affection of your lover. You want to be pampered and know how to pamper your mate. You are private in your expression of endearments and particularly when it comes to lovemaking. You will hold off until eve! rything meets with your approval. You can control your appetite and abstain from sex if need be. You require new sensations and experiences. You are willing to experiment.
<br /><br />C - You are a very social individual, and it is important to you to have a relationship. You require closeness and togetherness. You must be able to talk to your sex partner before, during, and after. You want the object of your affection to be socially acceptable and good looking. You see your lover as a friend and companion. You are very sexual and ! sensual, needing someone to appreciate and almost worship you. When this cannot be achieved, you have the ability to go for long periods without sexual activity. You are an expert at controlling your desires and doing without.
<br /><br />D - Once you get it into your head that you want someone, you move full steam ahead in pursuit. You do not give up your quest easily. You are nurturing and caring. If someone has a problem, this turns you on. You are highly sexual, passionate, loyal, and intense in your involvement, sometimes possessive and jealous. Sex to you is a pleasure to be enjo! yed. You are stimulated by the eccentric and unusual, having a free and open.
<br /><br />E - Your greatest need is to talk. If your date is not a good listener, you have trouble relating. A person must be intellectually stimulating or you are not interested sexually. You need a friend for a lover and a companion for a bedmate. You hate disharmony and disruption, but you do enjoy a good argument once in a while it seems to stir things up. ! You flirt a lot, for the challenge is more important than the sexual act for you, but once you give your heart away, you are uncompromisingly loyal. When you don't have a good lover to fall asleep with, you will fall asleep with a good book. (Sometimes, in fact, you prefer a good look.)
<br /><br />F - You are idealistic and romantic, putting your lover on a pedestal. You look for the very best mate you can find. You are a flirt, yet once committed, you are very loyal.

<br /><br />J - You are totally fucking marvelous!
<br /><br />K - You can be very romantic, attached to the glamour of love. Having a partner is of paramount importance to you.

<br /><br />The boy couldn't have been more than 5 or 6 years old. 
<br /><br />The Cashier said, 'I'm sorry, but you don't have enough money to buy this doll.' 
<br /><br />Then the little boy turned to the old woman next to him: ''Granny, 
<br /><br />are you sure I don't have enough money?'' 
<br /><br />The old lady replied: ''You know that you don't have enough money to buy this doll, my dear.'' 
<br /><br />Then she asked him to stay there for just 5 minutes while she went to look a round. She left quickly. 
<br /><br />The little boy was still holding the doll in his hand. 
<br /><br />Finally, I walked toward him and I asked him who he wished to give this doll to. 
<br /><br />'It's the doll that my sister loved most and wanted so much for Christmas 
<br /><br />She was sure that Santa Claus would bring it to her.' 
<br /><br />I replied to him that maybe Santa Claus would bring it to her after all, and not to worry. 
<br /><br />But he replied to me sadly. 'No, Santa Claus can't bring it to her where she is now. I have to give the doll to my mommy so that she can give it to my sister when she goes there.' 
<br /><br />His eyes were so sad while saying this. 'My Sister has gone to be with God. Daddy says that Mommy is going to see God very soon too, so I thought that she could take the doll with her to give it to my sister.'' 
<br /><br />My heart nearly stopped. 
<br /><br />The little boy looked up at me and said: 'I told daddy to tell mommy not to go yet I need her to wait until I come back from the mall.' 
<br /><br />Then he showed me a very nice photo of him where he was laughing. He then told me 'I want mommy to take my picture with her so she won't forget me.' 
<br /><br />'I love my mommy and I wish she doesn't have to leave me, but daddy says that she has to go to be with my little sister.' 
<br /><br />Then he looked again at the doll with sad eyes, very quietly. 
<br /><br />I quickly reached for my wallet and said to the boy. 'Suppose we check again, just in case you do have enough money for the doll?'' 
<br /><br />'OK' he said, 'I hope I do have enough.' I added some of my money to his with out him seeing and we started to count it. There was enough for the doll and even some spare money. 
<br /><br />The little boy said: 'Thank you God for giving me enough money!' 
<br /><br />Then he looked at me and added, 'I asked last night before I went to sleep for God to make sure I had enough money to buy this doll, so that mommy could give It to my sister. He heard me!'' 
<br />'I also wanted to have enough money to buy a white rose for my mommy, but I didn't dare to ask God for too much. But He gave me enough to buy the doll and a white rose.'' 
<br /><br />'My mommy loves white roses.' 
<br /><br />A few minutes later, the old lady returned and I left with my basket. 
<br /><br />I finished my shopping in a totally different state from when I started. 
<br /><br />I couldn't get the little boy out of my mind. 
<br /><br />Then I remembered a local news paper article two days ago, which mentioned a drunk man in a truck, who hit a car occupied by a young woman and a little girl. 
<br /><br />The little girl died right away, and the mother was left in a critical state. The family had to decide whether to pull the plug on the life-sustaining machine, because the young woman would not be able to recover from the coma. 
<br /><br />Was this the family of the little boy? 
<br /><br />Two days after this encounter with the little boy, I read in the news paper that the young woman had passed away. 
<br /><br />I couldn't stop myself as I bought a bunch of white roses and I went to the funeral home where the body of the young woman was exposed for people to see and make last wishes before her burial. 
<br /><br />She was there, in her coffin, holding a beautiful white rose in her hand with the photo of the little boy and the doll placed over her chest. 
<br /><br />I left the place, teary-eyed, feeling that my life had been changed for ever.. The love that the little boy had for his mother and his sister is still, to this day, hard to imagine. 
<br /><br />And in a fraction of a second, a drunk driver had taken all this away from him. 
<br /><br />Will you think again before you drink drive?????? 
<br /><br />Now you have 2 choices: 
<br /><br />1) Repost this. Only for ones who have a heart 
<br /><br />2) Ignore it as if it never touched your heart
