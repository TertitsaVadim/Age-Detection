<br />He asked one of his New Christian Student to stand and . . .
<br /><br />Professor : You are a Christian, aren't you, son ? 
<br />Student : Yes, sir. 
<br />Professor : So, you Believe in GOD ? 
<br />Student : Absolutely, sir. 
<br />Professor : Is GOD Good ? 
<br />Student : Sure. 
<br />Professor : Is GOD ALL - POWERFUL ? 
<br />Student : Yes. 
<br />Professor : My Brother died of Cancer even though he prayed to GOD to heal him.
<br />Most of us would attempt to help others who are ill, but GOD didn't. How is this GOD good then? Hmm? 
<br /><br />(Student was silent ) 
<br /><br />Professor : You can't answer, can you ? Let's start again, Young Fella. Is GOD Good? 
<br />Student : Yes.
<br />Professor : Is Satan good ? 
<br />Student : No. 
<br />Professor : Where does Satan come from ? 
<br />Student : From . . . GOD . . . 
<br />Professor : That's right. Tell me son, is there evil in this World? 
<br />Student : Yes. 
<br />Professor : Evil is everywhere, isn't it ? And GOD did make everything. Correct? 
<br />Student : Yes. 
<br />Professor : So who created evil ? 
<br /><br />(Student did not answer) 
<br /><br />Professor : Is there Sickness? Immorality? Hatred? Ugliness? All these terrible things exist in the world, don't they?
<br />Student : Yes, sir. 
<br />Professor : So, who Created them ? 
<br /><br />(Student had no answer) 
<br /><br />Professor : Science says you have 5 Senses you use to identify and observe the world around you. 
<br />Tell me, son . . . Have you ever seen GOD? 
<br />Student : No, sir. 
<br />Professor : Tell us if you have ever Heard your GOD? 
<br />Student : No , sir. 
<br />Professor : Have you ever Felt your GOD , Tasted your GOD, Smelt your GOD? Have you ever had any Sensory Perception of GOD for that matter?
<br />Student : No, sir. I'm afraid I haven't. 
<br />Professor : Yet you still Believe in GOD? 
<br />Student : Yes. 
<br />Professor : According to Empirical, Testable,Demonstrable Protocol,Science says your GOD doesn't exist. What do you say to that, son?
<br />Student : Nothing. I only have my Faith. 
<br />Professor : Yes, Faith. And that is the Problem Science has. 
<br />Student : Professor, is there such a thing as Heat? 
<br />Professor : Yes. 
<br />Student : And is there such a thing as Cold? 
<br />Professor : Yes. 
<br />Student : No, sir. There isn't.. 
<br /><br />(The Lecture Theatre became very quiet with this turn of events ) 
<br /><br />Student : Sir, you can have Lots of Heat, even More Heat, Superheat, Mega Heat, White Heat, a Little Heat or No Heat. But we don't have anything called Cold. We can hit 458 Degrees below Zero which is
<br />No Heat, but we can't go any further after that. There is no such thing as Cold. Cold is only a Word we use to describe the Absence of Heat.We cannot Measure Cold.Heat is Energy. Cold is Not the Opposite of Heat, sir, just the Absence of it. 
<br /><br />(There was Pin-Drop Silence in the Lecture Theatre ) 
<br /><br />Student : What about Darkness, Professor? Is there such a thing as Darkness? 
<br />Professor : Yes. What is Night if there isn't Darkness? 
<br />Student : You're wrong again, sir. Darkness is the Absence of Something. You can have Low Light, Normal Light, Bright Light,Flashing Light . . .But if you have No Light constantly, you have nothing
<br />and its called Darkness, isn't it? In reality, Darkness isn't. If it is, were you would be able to make Darkness Darker, wouldn't you? 
<br />Professor : So what is the point you are making, Young Man ? 
<br />Student : Sir, my point is your Philosophical Premise is flawed. 
<br />Professor : Flawed ? Can you explain how? 
<br />Student : Sir, you are working on the Premise of Duality. You argue there is Life and then there is Death, a Good GOD and a Bad GOD. You are viewing the Concept of GOD as something finite, something we can measure. Sir, Science can't even explain a Thought. It uses Electricity and Magnetism, but has never seen, much less fully understood either one. To view Death as the Opposite of Life is to be ignorant of the fact that Death cannot exist as a Substantive Thing. Death is Not the Opposite of Life: just the Absence of it Now tell me, Professor, do you teach your Students that they evolved from a Monkey?
<br />Professor : If you are referring to the Natural Evolutionary Process, yes, of course, I do. 
<br />Student : Have you ever observed Evolution with your own eyes, sir? 
<br /><br />(The Professor shook his head with a Smile, beginning to realize where the Argument was going ) 
<br /><br />Student : Since no one has ever observed the Process of Evolution at work and Cannot even prove that this Process is an On-Going Endeavor, Are you not teaching your Opinion, sir? Are you not a Scientist but a Preacher? 
<br /><br />(The Class was in Uproar ) 
<br /><br />Student : Is there anyone in the Class who has ever seen the Professor's Brain? 
<br /><br />(The Class broke out into Laughter ) 
<br /><br />Student : Is there anyone here who has ever heard the Professor's Brain, Felt it, touched or Smelt it? . . .No one appears to have done so. So, according to the Established Rules of Empirical, Stable, Demonstrable Protocol, Science says that You have No Brain, sir. With all due respect, sir, how do we then Trust your Lectures, sir? 
<br /><br />(The Room was Silent. The Professor stared at the Student, his face unfathomable) 
<br /><br />Professor : I guess you'll have to take them on Faith, son. 
<br />Student : That is it sir . . . Exactly ! The Link between Man &amp; GOD is FAITH. That is all that Keeps Things Alive and Moving.
<br /><br />NB: That student was Albert Einstein.

<br />With several long hours before her flight.
<br />She hunted for a book in the airport shop,
<br />Bought a bag of cookies and found a place to drop.
<br /><br />She was engrossed in her book, but happened to see,
<br />That the man beside her, as bold as could be,
<br />Grabbed a cookie or two from the bag between,
<br />Which she tried to ignore, to avoid a scene.
<br /><br />She read, munched cookies and watched the clock,
<br />As the gutsy &quot;cookie thief&quot; diminished her stock.
<br />She was getting more irritated as the minutes ticked by,
<br />Thinking, &quot;If I wasn't so nice, I'd blacken his eye!&quot;
<br /><br />With each cookie she took, he took one too.
<br />When only one was left, she wondered what he'd do.
<br />With a smile on his face and a nervous laugh,
<br />He took the last cookie and broke it in half.
<br /><br />He offered her half, as he ate the other.
<br />She snatched it from him and thought, &quot;Oh brother,
<br />This guy has some nerve, and he's also rude,
<br />Why, he didn't even show any gratitude!&quot;
<br /><br />She had never known when she had been so galled,
<br />And sighed with relief when her flight was called.
<br />She gathered her belongings and headed for the gate,
<br />Refusing so look back at the &quot;thieving ingrate.&quot;
<br /><br />She boarded the plane and sand in her seat,
<br />Then sought her book, which was almost complete.
<br />As she reached in her luggage, she gasped with surprise.
<br />There was her bag of cookies in front of her eyes!
<br /><br />&quot;If mine are here,&quot; she moaned with despair,
<br />&quot;Then the others were his and he tried to share!&quot;
<br />Too late to apologize, she realized with grief,
<br />That she was the rude one, the ingrate, the thief!

<br />to have stitches removed from his thumb. He said he was in a hurry as he had an appointment 
<br />at 9:00 am. I took his vital  signs and had him take a seat, knowing it would be over  
<br />an hour before someone would to able to see him. I saw him looking at his watch and decided, 
<br />since I  was not busy with another patient, I would evaluate his wound. On exam, it was well healed, 
<br />so I talked to one of the doctors, got the needed supplies to remove his sutures and redress his     
<br />wound.                                                                     
<br />While taking care of  his wound, I asked him if he had another doctor's appointment this morning, 
<br />as he was in such a hurry.                       
<br />The gentleman told me no, that he needed to go to the nursing home to eat  
<br />breakfast with his wife. I inquired as to her health.                      
<br />He told me that she had been there for a while and that she was a victim of Alzheimer's Disease.                                                    
<br />As we talked, I asked if she would be upset if he was a bit late.          
<br />He replied that she no longer knew who he was, that she had not recognized him in five years now.                                                     
<br />I was surprised, and asked him, 'And you still go every morning, even though she doesn't know who you are?'                                      
<br />He smiled as he patted my hand and said, 'She doesn't know me, but I still know who she is.'                                                          
<br /><br />I had to hold back tears as he left, I had goose bumps on my arm, and thought, 
<br />'That is the kind of love I want in my life.'                     
<br /><br />True love is neither physical, nor romantic.                               
<br /><br />True love is an acceptance of all that is, has been, will be, and will not be.                                                                        
<br /><br />With all the jokes and fun that are in e-mails, sometimes there is one     
<br />that comes along that has an important message.. 
<br />This one I thought I could share with you.                                                      
<br /><br />The happiest people don't necessarily have the best of everything; 
<br />they just make the best of everything they have.                                
<br /><br />'Life isn't about how to survive the storm, but how to dance in the rain.'                                             
<br /><br />We are all getting Older                                    
<br /> Tomorrow may be our turn.                          
<br /> Enjoy life now-it has an expiration date!

<br />Then how can we hate others for their one mistake. 
<br />Think before you hate someone or hate yourself.
<br /><br />Swimming along the flow is effortless but swimming against it needs effort. 
<br />Don't go the way life takes you, but take life the way you wanna go. 
<br />Dare to be different.
<br /><br />The greatest advantage of speaking the truth is that you don't have to remember what you said. 
<br />Think about it.
<br /><br />A beautiful saying: 
<br />&quot;If your eyes are positive you would like all the people in the world. 
<br />But if your tongue is positive all the people in the world like you.&quot;
<br /><br />Life is about the art of drawing without an eraser.
<br />So be careful while taking decisions about the most valuable pages of your life.
<br /><br />Life is like a coin. 
<br />Pleasure and Pain are the two sides. 
<br />Only one side is visible at a time. 
<br />But remember other side is also waiting for it's turn.
<br /><br />If you like someone, show it. It will be sweeter then telling. 
<br />But if you don't like someone. Just tell it. It will be less painful then showing it.
<br /><br />A very true but strange quote: 
<br />&quot;Love doesn't start in morning &amp; end in evening. 
<br />It starts when you don't need it &amp; ends when you need it most.&quot;
<br /><br />What's greater then mom's love? 
<br />Which pillow is better then lover's lap? 
<br />Which company's better then friends? 
<br />There are some things in life with no substitutes. 
<br />Love them forever.
<br /><br />A boy loved a girl so much. One day he proposed to her. But she refused. 
<br />Still he was not sad. His friends asked him, didn't you feel bad? 
<br />He said, why should I feel sad? 
<br />I lost the one who never loved me. 
<br />But she lost the one who really loves her.

<br /><br />Most of us create our own problems by interfering too often in others' affairs. We do so because somehow we have convinced ourselves that our way is the best way, our logic is the perfect logic and those who do not conform to our thinking must be criticized and steered to the right  direction, our direction. This thinking denies the existence of individuality and consequently the existence of God.. God has created each one of us in a unique way. No two human beings can think or act in exactly the same way. All men or women act the way they do because God within them prompts them that way. Mind your own business and you will keep your peace.

<br /><br />This is the most powerful aid to peace of mind. We often develop ill feelings inside our heart for the person who insults us or harms us. We nurture grievances. This in turn results in loss of sleep, development of stomach ulcers, and high blood pressure. This insult or injury was done once, but nourishing of grievance goes on forever by constantly remembering it. Get over this bad habit. Life is too short to waste in such trifles. Forgive &amp; Forget, and march on. Love flourishes in giving and forgiving.

<br /><br />This world is full of selfish people. They seldom praise anybody without selfish motives. They may praise you today because you are in power, but no sooner than you are powerless, they will forget your achievement and will start finding faults in you. Why do you wish to kill yours in striving for their recognition? Their recognition is not worth the aggravation. Do your duties ethically and sincerely.

<br /><br />We all have experienced how jealousy can disturb our peace of mind. You know that you work harder than your colleagues in the office, but sometimes they get promotions; you do not. You started a business several years ago, but you are not as successful as your neighbour whose business is only one year old. There are several examples like these in everyday life. Should you be jealous? No. Remember everybody's life is shaped by his/her destiny, which has now become his/her reality. If you are destined to be rich, nothing in the world can stop you. If you are not so destined, no one can help you either. Nothing will be gained by blaming others for your misfortune. Jealousy will not get you anywhere; it will only take away your peace of mind

<br />Is the kind you can sit on a porch and swing with, 
<br />Never say a word, 
<br />And then walk away feeling like it was the best conversation you've ever had. 
<br /><br />It's true that we don't know 
<br />What we've got until it's gone,
<br />But it's also true that we don't know 
<br />What we've been missing until it arrives.. 
<br /><br />We never get what we want,
<br />We never want what we get, 
<br />We never have what we like, 
<br />We never like what we have.
<br />And still we live &amp; love. 
<br />That's life...
