One type that you may want to try is Powerbait, which is made by Berkley, a well known manufacturer of fishing tackle.

You may also discover bonafide benefits from night fishing, an option many trout fishers never consider. There are dangers in fishing at night, of course. You should be especially careful if you haven't been in the area you have chosen before. Always carry reliable flashlights with you as well as a stock of fresh batteries. Be mindful of the fact that if the fish see your lights, it will scare them off. So, make it a habit to turn them off when you are near the river, stream, or lake in which you hope to catch a trout or two. Another good rule is to check out the area for night fishing in the daytime so you become familiar with the terrain. Needless to say, you should take a buddy or two with you if you plan to do any night fishing. Why is night fishing a good alternative? Your chances of catching more trout increase at night because the trout are normally more lively. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5hbGl2ZW5vdGRlYWQuY29tL21hdGhpYXNtdW5raDQxMC9Db21tb25zZW5zZS1Ucmlja3MtZm9yLVRyb3V0LUZpc2hpbmctU3VjY2Vzcy1wcm9maWxlLTI4NTQ5MTkuaHRtbA__" target="_blank">How you can Succeed At Trout Fishing How</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2xpdW9kcmV2dXR5bWhhLnBvZG9tYXRpYy5jb20vZW50cnkvMjAxMi0wOS0xNlQwN18wNV8yNS0wN18wMA__" target="_blank">Catching Trout - Tips to Help You</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2NvbW11bml0eS5iYWJ5Y2VudGVyLmNvbS9qb3VybmFsL2NpYXJhbmxhbmdobzQxMC82MDE3MzU2L2Jhc2ljX3RyaWNrc19mb3JfdHJvdXRfZmlzaGluZ18tX3RoZV9tZXRob2RzX3lvdV9tdXN0X2tub3c_" target="_blank">Crucial Methods to Make Your Trout Fishing Far more Rewarding</a> When you venture into a new region to try your hand at trout fishing, make yourself familiar with whatever fishing regulations are in place for the area.

Weather is a factor that you need to consider, including the bait that you're using and the lure that you have on your line. The purpose of this article is to introduce you to some proven tactics that will enable you to catch more trout.  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RoZWZpc2hpbmd0dWJlLmNvbS8_" target="_blank">click here for info</a><br /><br />Make sure you use a light line when trout fishing. This is a very fundamental tactic. Generally, you would do well with four pound test line and in no event should you use a line that is heavier than six pound test. Why a light line? Trout have very good eyesight and if your line is heavier, they can see it better. Many men and women who are new to fishing will instinctively use a heavy line. They just don't have the experience to realize that they are jeopardizing their chances of hooking a trout. If you want to camouflage your line so the sharp-sighted trout don't see it, a mono-filament line that's light blue will do the trick. As a mater of fact, you should only use light tackle when trout fishing. A light, 5 foot rod is good for most situations. The size of your lures is also important. For best results, choose lures that are small. Your hook size should also be small. Size 10 or less. <br /><br />Figure out what time of day the trout are out and about and you will have more trout to choose from. Follow the food. Fish are activated for the most part at the same time that the insects they eat are out and about. Early evening is a good time for this, as insects start coming out. There are a lot of variable factors to keep in mind, however. These include the seasons, atmospheric conditions, and other environmental conditions. A case in point - in the summer when it's extremely hot trout are more likely to venture out for a meal in the early morning hours. You should also make your bait match the weather conditions. Try earthworms when there has been a rainy spell. They are abundant in the water because they get washed in and the trout feed on them. Use crickets or grasshoppers as bait on windy days, as these insects are naturally blown into the water. So, the bottom line is to try to match your bait to whatever the environment is currently feeding the fish. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5hbGl2ZW5vdGRlYWQuY29tL2NpYXJhbmxhbmdobzQxMC9XaHktVHJvdXQtRmlzaGluZy1DYW4tYmUtaHVnZWx5LUVuam95YWJsZS1Uby1wZXJmb3JtLXByb2ZpbGUtMjg1NDkyOS5odG1s" target="_blank">Trout Fishing - the Fundamentals for Results</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2xpdW9kcmV2dXR5bWhhLnBvZG9tYXRpYy5jb20vZW50cnkvMjAxMi0wOS0xNlQwN18wN18yMy0wN18wMA__" target="_blank">Some Fundamentals Of Trout Fishing To know</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2NvbW11bml0eS5iYWJ5Y2VudGVyLmNvbS9qb3VybmFsL3JhbmRvbHBoaHViYjI2LzYwMTczNzcvdHJvdXRfZmlzaGluZ18tX3RoZV9zZWNyZXRzX3RvX3Jlc3VsdHM_" target="_blank">Commonsense Approaches for Trout Fishing Results</a> Rainbow trout are one of the most popular types of trout that you can fish for, and there are certain techniques to keep in mind if you're going to go rainbow trout fishing.

Fortunately, you have numerous places to choose from and can usually find a good spot not far from home. While half the fun of trout fishing is just going outdoors and &amp;quot;fishin'&amp;quot;, it's always more fulfilling if you bring home a batch of freshly-caught fish for dinner. This isn't always easy to do. If you keep reading, this report will give you more information on how to hook more trout.  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RoZWZpc2hpbmd0dWJlLmNvbS8_" target="_blank">click for source</a><br /><br />Hooks are important. If you use the wrong hook your odds plummet, not only with trout, but for all fish. If you want to brag about &amp;quot;the one that got away&amp;quot; then don't keep your hooks sharp. If they're dull, you'll more than likely lose more fish off of the hook than you will keep. Learn how to sharpen your supply of hooks and, when they don't work any longer, buy new ones. Another problem with many hooks is that they're too large for catching trout. Try gang hooks. You take two small hooks, tie them together, and you will have one of the greatest tools for catching trout. Consequently, you can then use twice as much bait, which enhances your chances of getting a strike. In summary, if you use gang hooks, or sharp, small hooks, you will theoretically attract more trout to your set up. <br /><br />One of the most popular types of trout fishing is fly fishing. People that do flyfishing use special line, fishing equipment, and fly-like lures that are specifically designed to attract trout. Many flyfishing schools have opened up across the country to help people learn how to fly fish. If you enjoy fishing, it's worth learning about, but beginners trying it on their own are likely to become frustrated. One of the hardest things to do is cast the line the right way. You can find some videos online that demonstrate it, but it's best to learn it from an experienced fly fisherman. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5hbGl2ZW5vdGRlYWQuY29tL3JhbmRvbHBoaHViYjI2L1Ryb3V0LUZpc2hpbmctSG93LVRvLUFjaGlldmUtc3VjY2Vzcy1Xb3JraW5nLXByb2ZpbGUtMjg1NDk0Mi5odG1s" target="_blank">Techniques for Profitable Trout Fishing</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2NvbW11bml0eS5iYWJ5Y2VudGVyLmNvbS9qb3VybmFsL3JhbmRvbHBoaHViYjI2LzYwMTc0NzMvdHJvdXRfZmlzaGluZ19hY2hpZXZlbWVudF9tYWRlX2Vhc3k_" target="_blank">Trout Fishing Results Done affordably</a> Be sure to check with the local authorities to become familiar with local fishing regulations. Every district will have their own rules. Every state offers a fishing license. Get one for the state where you will be fishing. Trout fishing is often done in very rural places, such as mountain rivers and streams, and you should make sure you're not wandering on someone's private property by mistake.

Fishing and mountain streams that are running rapidly are part of the excitement of trout fishing which is done in the North American forests and wilderness. We've collected some useful trout fishing strategies that you can apply on your next fishing trip.  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RoZWZpc2hpbmd0dWJlLmNvbS8_" target="_blank">click</a><br /><br />Trout fishing is fun because you can use a variety of lures and different bait when fishing. If you go fishing, you might want to try Powerbait, a company that has a great amount of respect in this industry. Powerbait is a special blend of dough that's designed to imitate the appearance of natural trout food such as larva and eggs. It is important<br />to put your bait on your hook in the proper way, despite the fact it already smells like real trout food. Different types of bait should always be tested in order to determine which one will be more successful. The easiest way to tell which type of bait is working and which one is not is by how many trout bite at each particular one. <br /><br />There are a lot of reasons people love to fish for trout, and one of the main reasons is the taste of this fish.<br /><br />However, some people don't like trout, which is their choice, of course. Trout is not like those delicate, white fish you buy in the supermarket. Its taste is more flavorful, more &amp;quot;gamy&amp;quot;, than other species of fish. Pan frying is a popular way to prepare trout. This is an easy way to cook your trout back in your camp over a campfire. With pollution as rampant as it is today, you have to be careful about eating anything you catch in the wild. Always research to make sure that the fish in the area where you are fishing haven't been contaminated with toxins. It's an easy matter to check online with your state's Health Department or Fish and Game Department to see if there are any reports of contamination or pollution in the area you plan to fish in.  Trout are numerous in most of Northern America, but not all waterways will contain them. In order to be successful finding trout, you should take the time to understand their preferred terrain. If you live near a lake, or a stream, or even a river, you may have trout nearby. These are the kinds of places that trout live in. They prefer cold water. If you<br />come across a cold, swift-flowing stream and you can see bubbles on the top of the water, you may have found your lucky trout fishing spot.<br /><br />Trout thrive on oxygen rich water. If you find a swift moving stream with bubbles - which indicates a high oxygen content - you will most likely also find trout. There are certain objects - both natural and manufactured - that trout use for resting under and searching for something to eat. You might want to check around an old log jam, or a stone outcropping that has water below it, or even an old, overturned boat that has been in the water for a long time. Trout fishing is a traditional outdoors recreation that millions of Americans enjoy. One of the reasons<br />is that you can usually find a great place to go trout fishing in most areas of North America. Have you always dreamed of catching a trophy marlin to hang on your wall over the fireplace? Well, someday maybe you will. But for now, just take a walk to your local stream and enjoy a pan-fried batch of trout for your dinner. The above tips will increase your enjoyment and success at this great sport.

Trout fishing has a lot of factors including using certain bait, using the right lure, and a host of other variables. The purpose of this article is to introduce you to some proven tactics that will enable you to catch more trout.  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RoZWZpc2hpbmd0dWJlLmNvbS8_" target="_blank">check this link right here now</a><br /><br />If you want to be a successful fisher, you have to educate yourself about hooks. There is a right hook for each fish and you must be sure that is what you are using. You have to keep your hooks sharp or the fish can slip right off of the hook. It's easy to sharpen dull hooks and, when they are no longer useful, they can be replaced. Another problem with many hooks is that they're too large for catching trout. One good technique is to use what is known as gang hooks. These are created by simply tying to small hooks together. This means you can use double the amount of bait, which increases the likelihood of catching something. In summary, if you use gang hooks, or sharp, small hooks, you will theoretically attract more trout to your set up. <br /><br />Many people love the taste of trout, and this can be one motive for trout fishing.<br /><br />Naturally, this is a personal choice. There are actually people out there who don't enjoy eating trout. Trout meat is darker and deeper in flavor than the fish that have white, or light, flesh. It also tends to be stronger tasting. If you are like a lot of other people, as soon as you return to your camp or site, you can't wait to pan fry a batch of your fresh trout over a campfire and enjoy them immediately. Be sure to check in advance of eating any fish you catch in the wild, however. Double check to make sure the waters in which they live haven't been polluted or contaminated with anything. Most states have a Department of Fish and Game or a State Department of Health where you can find out information on the local area. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wdXJldm9sdW1lLmNvbS9yYW5kb2xwaGh1YmIyNi9wb3N0cy8yNDAzNzc1L1dhbnQrdG8rQ2F0Y2grTW9yZStUcm91dCUzRitUcnkrdGhpcythZHZpY2U_" target="_blank">Catching Trout - Ideas to help you</a> One important thing you should be prepared for is to wear the proper clothing before you go fishing. Fishing all day in cold streams requires that you wear waders so that you can get around in comfort. You will definitely be miserable very swiftly if you do not have waterproof insulated boots to wear. If you don't plan to go into deep water, a good pair of waterproof boots will be sufficient. Fishing vests are also very useful, as these give you a place to store your extra lures, hooks and other gear. You should bring sunglasses, a hat, and some type of sun protection for your trip. Finally, don't forget to bring insect repellant. Since trout feed on insects, you will obviously be in bug infested territory. <br /><br />Outdoor sports, such as trout fishing, are a lot of fun, but it's also a challenge - especially for the beginner. If you enjoy being out in the unspoiled &amp;quot;wilderness&amp;quot; then you will enjoy trout fishing. At most of the locations where you find trout, you also find unspoiled nature.

The appearance is often different with each fish and they live in many different aquatic locations. For instance, rainbow trout have a variety of colors on their scales making them very colorful. Rapid waters tend to have these types of trout; fly fisherman enjoy fishing for them in the rivers. Another type of trout, Brook trout, are not technically trout but are considered to be in the family. Brown Trout are found in many different places in Northern America. Lake Michigan is known to have some especially large brown trout. You may also discover bonafide benefits from night fishing, an option many trout fishers never consider. There are dangers in fishing at night, of course. You should be especially careful if you haven't been in the area you have chosen before. Always carry reliable flashlights with you as well as a stock of fresh batteries. But be prudent with whatever form of lights you carry. Don't use them close to the water. They could frighten the fish. To be on the safe side, make a trek to the site where you plan to do your night fishing in the daytime. This will give you more confidence when you go at night.

Fishing all day in cold streams requires that you wear waders so that you can get around in comfort. The footwear that you have must be waterproof and insulated or you may find yourself too uncomfortable to fish. Waterproof boots are okay to use as long as you stay in a shallow area of the river. Fishing hooks and lures can be easily stored in a fishing vest; this is why you need one if you go flyfishing. You should bring sunglasses, a hat, and some type of sun protection for your trip. And, of course, always bring insect repellent. Trout usually live where insects are prolific, which means you need to bring insect repellent at all costs.

You send off vibrations, also, and this - for a trout - is the same thing as hearing you. And you won't be able to hide your odor from them!<br /><br />Most of this is just plain common sense but it well worth your while to keep things like this in mind. Don't just blunder into your fishing spot! Strange as it may seem, the color of your clothing can make a different. You want to merge into the environment you're in as much as you can. Gray, brown, tan, and green are good colors - similar to wearing camouflage gear. White and bright, flashy colors are not a good choice because you can be seen much more easily by the fish. Trout are very sensitive to odors and if you have the smell of cigarettes or even a strong smelling hand cream on your hands, this could cause to fish to avoid you. Any strong odors on your hands passes onto the bait you handle and, trout, being smart, decide that this bait isn't righteous food. Therefore, it's very important that you keep your hands washed when you are going to be touching any of your lures or bait. Don't tromp your way into your fishing hole. Be as quiet and stealthy as is humanely possible. A lot of fishers never consider night fishing for trout, although it can be very advantageous. It can be dangerous if you're not familiar with the terrain, so be careful and make sure you bring the right equipment, such as a couple of reliable flashlights. Of course, any lighting you bring must be kept as far from the stream or river you'll be fishing in as possible, or it may scare the fish away. To be on the safe side, make a trek to the site where you plan to do your night fishing in the daytime. This will give you more confidence when you go at night. Don't go night fishing alone.

To make matters worse, it's even more annoying when you are fishing in a river that has a history of a lot of trout, but they aren't biting for you. Most of the time you can change your luck by a few simple adjustments to what you are doing and the trout will snap up your bait. Read on to discover some good maneuvers you can take.  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RoZWZpc2hpbmd0dWJlLmNvbS8_" target="_blank">trout fishing</a><br /><br />Hooks can make all the difference in the world. You must use the appropriate hook or you won't catch anything. If you want to brag about &amp;quot;the one that got away&amp;quot; then don't keep your hooks sharp. If they're dull, you'll more than likely lose more fish off of the hook than you will keep. Make it a habit to check your hooks before each trip and sharpen them if necessary. Toss out the one that are no longer useful and buy some more. Speaking of hooks, a lot of fishers use hooks that are simply too big for hooking trout. One of the best techniques for trout fishing is to use gang hooks, which are two small hooks that are tied together. So you end up with twice as much bait, which is much more tempting to a trout than a single baited hook. So if you want to get more trout to bite, use smaller, sharper hooks and try gang hooks. If you like to see rivers and trees, Brook trout fishing may be the hobby for you. Living in very frigid waters, the Brook trout can be found in streams and rivers in the wilderness. They are a very colorful fish sometimes having green, brown, and red in their colorations. These trout are very good to eat, yet some people will actually only catch them to put in their pond and keep as a pet to be seen. If you do a lot of flyfishing, you will be aware of spinner-bait and how effective it is. Fish populations are actually maintained by fishermen that use the catch and release techniques. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RoZWZpc2hpbmd0dWJlLmNvbQ__" target="_blank">The Fishing Tube</a> Understanding how to catch and fish for rainbow trout is half the battle in regard to getting this elusive fish on your hook. It is important to do a lot of fishing in deep water areas as this is where rainbow trout tend to hang out.

You can use many types of lures or bait for rainbow trout, but worms are among the best. Leading your bait hit the bottom of the river, and then rise to the top, is the best way to nab a rainbow trout any day. At times, this may cause your line to get caught on the bottom of the river, but that's one of the risks of drift fishing. <br /><br />There's so much more you can learn about trout fishing if you just look around. This report has just barely given you a head start on successful trout fishing. Be that as it may, there is enough information presented in this report to get you well on your way to many happy experiences trout fishing.

We'll help you get more fish into your creel with the tips in this article.  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RoZWZpc2hpbmd0dWJlLmNvbS8_" target="_blank">The Fishing Tube</a><br /><br />When you go trout fishing, bring along a large selection of bait and lures to see which works best for you. One type that you may want to try is Powerbait, which is made by Berkley, a well known manufacturer of fishing tackle. If you're looking for bait, Powerbait is a great option which mimics the food that trout naturally eat. Once you put it on your hook, you will see all of the colors and the strong scent that each one comes with. Of course, trout don't always respond the way you hope they will, so you may have to test out different types of bait. The amount of times that trout bite at your bait will lead you to understanding which one really works. Many men and women who like to fish for trout never give night fishing a thought, even though there are many pluses to night fishing. There are dangers in fishing at night, of course. You should be especially careful if you haven't been in the area you have chosen before. Always carry reliable flashlights with you as well as a stock of fresh batteries. Of course, any lighting you bring must be kept as far from the stream or river you'll be fishing in as possible, or it may scare the fish away. You should always visit the area during the daytime first, to make you more comfortable when you go at night. Don't go night fishing alone. This is a fundamental rule all good trout fishers follow. Share the experience with one of your trout fishing friends. Fish are often more active at night, which gives you a better chance to catch them. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2NpYXJhbmxhbmdobzQxMC5wb3N0ZXJvdXMuY29tL3Ryb3V0LWZpc2hpbmctaG93LXRvLXN1Y2NlZWQtcGVyZm9ybWluZy1pdA__" target="_blank">Secrets for Productive Trout Fishing</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWdlbnRlLmNvbS95b3VyX3BhZ2UvYmxvZy92aWV3X3Bvc3RpbmcuaHRtbD9waWQ9MjczMzE0NCZhbXA7cHJvZmlsZV9pZD03MzUxNjQ1JmFtcDtwcm9maWxlX25hbWU9bWF0aGlhc211bmtoNDEwJmFtcDt1c2VyX2lkPTczNTE2NDUmYW1wO3VzZXJuYW1lPW1hdGhpYXNtdW5raDQxMA__" target="_blank">Why Trout Fishing Are often very Exciting To Do</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy56aW1iaW8uY29tL0dlbmVyYWwvYXJ0aWNsZXMvbzhPQjNfN0NnT3UvU2VjcmV0cytHZXR0aW5nK2dvb2QrcmVzdWx0cytUcm91dCtGaXNoaW5nP2FkZD1UcnVl" target="_blank">Basic Strategies for Trout Fishing - The techniques You Need To Know</a> You certainly won't find trout in every lake, stream or river that exists, but they are located in and about most of the North American continent. In order to be successful finding trout, you should take the time to understand their preferred terrain. Lakes, rivers, and streams are the favorite habitat of trout. You will find trout living where the water is cold. If the water you are fishing in is swift, but you can see bubbles on the surface, you have probably located a good place to look for trout.<br /><br />The bubbles tell you that the water is oxygen laden and this is a major attractor of trout. If you want to find the locations where trout rest or hunt, look for manufactured or naturally occurring objects in the water that provide cover for the trout. This includes docks, underwater vegetation, logs and rocks. <br /><br />If you want to engage in an outdoor recreational sport that is both a challenge, but also a lot of fun, you won't go wrong choosing trout fishing. One nice thing about trout fishing, besides getting you outdoors to enjoy nature's beauty, is that most trout fishing takes place in high mountain lakes, streams, and rivers. If you learn the techniques and tips that are presented in this report, your trout fishing expeditions will become more productive. As you learn more about this fascinating sport, you'll be able to predict the behavior of the trout and catch more of them.

The reason that many people like this particular sport is that it can be done while hiking through the mountains and is fast-paced. The next time you go fishing, use these tips if you plan to go fishing for trout.  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RoZWZpc2hpbmd0dWJlLmNvbS8_" target="_blank">check this site out</a><br /><br />Hooks can make all the difference in the world. You must use the appropriate hook or you won't catch anything. Once you have decided on the correct hook, you must make sure it's sharp. If you don't, they won't snag the fish. It's easy to sharpen dull hooks and, when they are no longer useful, they can be replaced. Don't make the mistake a lot of newcomers to trout fishing make and that's using hooks that are too big for catching trout. Gang hooks are a good method for catching trout. If you wrap two small hooks together, you have a gang hook. Simple! So you end up with twice as much bait, which is much more tempting to a trout than a single baited hook. In summary, if you use gang hooks, or sharp, small hooks, you will theoretically attract more trout to your set up. <br /><br />You should time your fishing for when the trout will be most active. Follow the food. Fish are activated for the most part at the same time that the insects they eat are out and about. Early in the evening, when the day starts to cool off, is when the insects start stirring. However, you must realize that the weather, climate, and time of year makes a difference. If the days are very hot you will most likely find that the trout prefer to come closer to the surface to find food when it's still cool in the early mornings. The weather will also determine which kind of bait is most favorable to the trout. Try earthworms when there has been a rainy spell. They are abundant in the water because they get washed in and the trout feed on them. Grasshoppers, as well as crickets and other small flying insects, get blown onto the surface of the water on windy days. This is a good time to use them as bait. It's always best to have bait that's similar to what the trout would normally be eating.

Ask about them before you head out. If you're fishing in a state other than your own (assuming you already have a license for your state) make sure you get a fishing license for that state. Even though most trout fishing is done in what appears to be wilderness areas, some of it may be private property. Don't make the mistake of trespassing. A lot of areas protect the health of their local fish, and the overall fish population, with local restrictions. Be certain to inquire locally about any restrictions that are in place. Over fishing is one of the reasons local areas place restrictions. Not only is this bad for the fish, it makes it impossible for anyone to enjoy fishing in the area. <br /><br />Trout fishing is an outdoor activity that's fun and challenging. If you enjoy being out in the unspoiled &amp;quot;wilderness&amp;quot; then you will enjoy trout fishing. At most of the locations where you find trout, you also find unspoiled nature. If you learn the techniques and tips that are presented in this report, your trout fishing expeditions will become more productive. If you seriously want to catch more trout, keep studying about trout fishing and learn to second guess their behavior. Once you do that, you will have no trouble landing as many fish as you want.
