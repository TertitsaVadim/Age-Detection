<br />New Jersey- A couple Joann Smith and Wayne Betha who owns the real estate firm pleaded guilty to stealing from home sellers by taking profits from home sales, and well as defrauding mortgage companies by falsifying the earnings of loan applicants.
<br /> According to the report released on Mortgage Fraud Blog and reviewed with the Micron Associates Professionals, it showed that between the month of August 2006 and February 2008, with their real estate firm, S&amp;B Property Management and Maintenance LLC of Trenton, the couple stole over $600,000 from sellers in connection with 11 home sales. Smith and Betha ostensibly averted the sales into their own bank accounts for their personal use, misleading the seller into believing they were not entitled to all of the profits from their homes.
<br /> The couple used a variety of schemes to fraudulently divert proceeds from the home sales into bank accounts maintained by Smith and S&amp;B. They represented to sellers and title companies that monies were owed to them for expenses, including property renovations and repairs that were never done and exorbitant consultant fees that they claimed the sellers had authorized. Many of the checks issued by the title companies handling the property sales were written to the home sellers, but Smith convinced the sellers to sign the checks over to her for payment of business expenses and fees. In several instances, the defendants falsely indicated on HUD forms and tax forms that the sellers directly received all of the profits from the home sales. They also omitted to tell sellers that they were agreeing in mortgage closing documents to pay large, unauthorized “seller’s concessions or seller’s assists” to the buyers.
<br /> Most of the sellers were having serious health financial problems and could not continue paying their mortgages. The 11 homes are in Trenton (4 homes), Ewing (1 home), Hamilton (2 homes), Orange (1 home), Willingboro (2 homes), and Camden (1 home), New Jersey.
<br /> In arranging for sales of three of the homes, Smith and Betha provided false information about the salary or wages of the buyers on settlement forms filed with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and mortgage applications, causing three mortgage companies to issue loans totaling approximately $641,800.
<br />The victims were not financially sophisticated. They did not understand the details of the property closings and, because of their financial woes, were anxious to be free of the obligation of paying mortgages they could no longer afford. Smith and Betha took advantage of these facts to steal the victims’ profits from the home sales.
<br />Smith sometimes wrote false notations on checks written from her account and the S&amp;B account to make it appear that payments were made for home repairs. Other times she would write a small check to the seller and write “gift” in the memo portion of the check. Smith and Betha used the diverted funds for personal expenses, withdrawing hundreds of thousands of dollars, primarily as ATM withdrawals, checks written to cash, and checks written to Betha.
<br />No corporate business tax returns were filed with the State of New Jersey for S&amp;B for 2005 through 2008. Smith also failed to file state personal income tax returns for those years. Betha failed to file a state personal income tax return for 2007.
<br />Under their plea agreements, they will each face a sentence of five to 10 years in state prison and will be required to enter a consent judgment to pay restitution to the home sellers, as well as the mortgage lenders, to the extent that the lenders have sustained losses.

<br />A computer virus is a computer program that can copy itself and infect a computer without your permission or knowledge. Viruses can also spread to other computers by email or when you connect to the Internet. The term “computer virus” is sometimes used as a catch-all phrase to include computer viruses, worms, root kits, and other exploits. Once on your computer, many of these threats tend to show little to no symptoms so they can survive undetected or they can disable your anti-virus software without you being aware. At the same time, less than 25% of computers are fully protected because the anti-virus software is not kept up-to-date, installed on all the computers in a home, or the operating system or other applications have not been patched to fix security holes. These issues highlight a fundamental flaw in today’s home network security and why an additional layer of protection is needed.

<br /><br />For financial adviser John Tyler, the past two to three years have brought a slow return to normalcy. 
<br />As the recession unfolded, discussions about whether the financial system will collapse are largely behind Tyler who says his clients can now afford to think much more rationally, take risk and expect returns. But the investors went through a long, trying mental process to get there, he said. 
<br />“Now they can put their toes in the water,” said Tyler, vice president and financial adviser at Houston-based Hulburd/Tyler Group, a wealth management practice under the private banking and investment group at Merrill Lynch. 
<br />“That might come in the form of some high-quality fixed income, some high-quality municipal bonds. We’re now to the point where they’re starting to think about high quality equities that are going to pay them in dividend.” 
<br />Tyler, a 7-year veteran of the financial advisory business, joined Merrill Lynch three years ago when he partnered with Jim Hulburd to form the Hulburd/Tyler Group in November 2009. The wealth managers average 23 clients each and manage between $25 million and $50 million per client. 
<br />The Hulburd/Tyler Group typically has two categories of clients, energy or technology executives and business owners, Tyler said. For C-suite executives, the group can deal with concentrated stock issues, help them create liquidity and perform other wealth advisory functions. For closely held businesses, the duo helps them through a process to understand whether they can sell their business or walks them through a process that teaches them what it means to run the business with longer-term investment goals in mind. 
<br />“Our experience in planning and executing things is as good as anyone in the industry,” he said.

<br /><br />London is gearing up for the final events of the London Olympics ahead of Sunday night’s closing ceremony. Crowds are expected to line the streets over the weekend to watch the walking races and men’s marathon as athletics concludes in the Olympic Stadium.
<br />A number of extra closing ceremony tickets could be made available before Sunday’s spectacular, Orgizer Locog said. Sunday, the final day of the Games, will see athletes compete for 15 gold medals in events including mountain biking, boxing and basketball. The final weekend of the Games is expected to be bathed in sunshine, with forecasters predicting temperatures of up to 26C.
<br />Team GB is seeking to boost their best medal haul for 104 years, but failed to secure wins in BMX finals on Friday. Shanaze Reade finished sixth in the women’s final and Liam Phillips fell in the men’s race. Britain has so far won 54 medals, including 25 gold. With two days of competition still remaining, the team has already eclipsed its Beijing Olympics total of 19 golds and registered the best medal haul since the 1908 London Olympics.
<br />Thousands of spectators are expected on the streets of central London to watch the walking races and men’s marathon, which are free to attend, and set to take place on Saturday and Sunday respectively.
<br />The action in the Olympic stadium will end on Saturday with Team GB’s Mo Farah competing in the 5,000m final and Jamaica’s Usain Bolt attempting to win a third gold medal when he runs in the 4x100m relay.
<br />The president of the International Olympics Committee has described London as “a city partying” and said the kindness of British people had helped deliver more than anyone expected at the Games.
<br />Jacques Rogge said the success was “very reassuring for the future of sport”. Sailing pairs Luke Patience and Stuart Bithell, plus Hannah Mills and Saskia Clark both won silver in the men’s and women’s 470 medal races. Great Britain’s women’s hockey team earned bronze by beating New Zealand 3-1.
<br />Boxer Anthony Ogogo had to settle for bronze after losing his middleweight semi-final to Brazil’s Esquiva Falcao Florentino but GB’s Luke Campbell will fight the Republic of Ireland’s John Joe Nevin in the bantamweight final.
<br />Taekwondo’s Lutalo Muhammad won bronze. Ethiopia’s Tirunesh Dibaba failed in her bid to make history by becoming the first female athlete to defend both long distance racing titles. She took silver in the women’s 5,000m title, which she adds to her 10,000m crown
<br />The owner of a family-run south London furniture store burned down in the 2011 riots has been invited to the Olympics Games closing ceremony. Maurice Reeves, 81, who owns House of Reeves Furniture, was invited by Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg.
<br />Mayor of London Boris Johnson announced a cycling weekend as part of the Olympic legacy, to be held in London on 3 and 4 August 2013. The aim is to encourage people to get fit and commute by bike.
<br />The mayor of Rio de Janeiro has congratulated London for putting on “the greatest Games ever” and revealed details of the city’s plans for 2016. Events will be held in four areas and the Maracana stadium, where the opening and closing ceremonies will be held, is being redeveloped.
<br />Earlier, Labour Leader Ed Miliband backed calls for political consensus to get more children involved in sport after the Olympics. He said he agreed with Dame Tessa Jowell, former Labour Olympics minister, who has appealed for a non-partisan 10-year plan to build on the legacy of the Games.
<br /><br />The government has insisted that it is committed to building on Britain’s Olympic success.Prime Minister David Cameron said it was time for a “change of culture” in schools to promote competitive sport, rather than setting targets for the number of hours of physical education completed.
<br />He said there was a need to hold people who are responsible for education policy to account to “capitalise” on the inspiration provided by the Games.
<br />Locog’s director of communications Jackie Brock-Doyle said organizers will know whether more closing ceremony tickets will be available for sale when the set is moved into the stadium on Saturday night.
<br />The ceremony’s musical director, David Arnold, has said the spectacle would reflect Great Britain as a whole.
<br />The composer, who has written music for Bond films, said it would be based around 30 classic pieces of British music.
<br />George Michael has already confirmed his participation and the Spice Girls and Tinie Tempah are among acts reported to be performing.
<br />Sailors Stuart Bithell, left, and Luke Patience won silver. On Monday, Heathrow is expected to see one of it’s busiest-ever days when thousands of athletes and officials leave the UK after the end of the Games.
<br />A guard of honor made up of Heathrow volunteers will applaud athletes as they pass through a specially-constructed Games terminal. The site will be decommissioned after three days and returned to its original use as a staff car park.
<br />Meanwhile, reports suggest the Olympics have prompted a rush of marriage proposals.
<br />The venue for Olympic Park big screens is believed to have seen 25 proposals since the Games began.

<br /><br />As The Tyler Group guides you to shopping malls and centers in Barcelona. Las Arenas shopping centre Barcelona. Centro comercial Las Arenas de Barcelona. Spectacular new shopping mall that opened in 2011 in a former Barcelona bull fighting ring and which welcomed 10 million visitors in its first year of operation. Las Arenas is close to Montjuic hill with attractions like the MNAC musuem and the Magic Fountain. It is also very convenient for shopping if you attending events at the Fira Montjuic Exhibition centre. Las Arenas has brand name shops, restaurants and is home to the Barcelona Museu del Rock. Don’t miss a stroll on the skywalk terrace on the roof with restaurants and panoramic views of Montjuic hill and Barcelona. Crowning the building is a domed theatre, concert and event space called “Cúpula de las Arenas.” El Centre de la Vila. Small shopping centre in Vila Olimpica in Sant Marti district of Barcelona. Popular due to the Yelmo Icaria VO cinemas, a well-stocked supermarket with some foreign food items, and a few good restaurants that can be enjoyed before watching a movie. Try El Burro Chilango who make authentic Mexican tacos al pastor and other dishes. El Corte Inglés Barcelona stores. El Corte Ingles is the biggest chain of department stores in Barcelona and Spain. They have multiple stores in all major Spanish cities and in various locations in Barcelona. The biggest Corte Inglés in Barcelona is the huge bomb shelter style building on Plaza Catalunya. Corte Inglés stores are open Monday to Saturday from 10.00 to 22.00. The Corte Inglés on Plaza Catalunya has an excellent if a bit expensive supermarket in the basement which is open until 22.00 every night, which is later than most supermarkets. They also have a good delicatessen shop with imported foods from around the world. El Corte Inglés means “the English cut” as in tailoring – not “the English court” as many think. Centro Comercial Gran Via 2. Shopping mall in Barcelona is a big shopping centre in Barcelona with all the major brand name shops. Gran Via 2 is the only the shopping centre in the southern area and Montjuic area of Barcelona. It is conveniently located on the Gran Via street of Barcelona past Plaza Espanya and close to theBarcelona FIRA trade fair pavilion and IKEA L’hospitalet, one of the two IKEAS stores in Barcelona.

The Maremagnum shopping mall. Open all week including Sundays. Maremagnum is a modern shopping mall with many brand names shops, restaurants and bars. It is located at the bottom end of Las Ramblas walking street in the Port Vell harbour of Barcelona. Previously Maremagnum had many pubs and bars on the top floor, but from 2012 the roof floor has reinvented itself on gourment food and has re-opened with a nice open-air terrace surrounded by a selection of twenty new gourmet restaurants that offer good quality dining with harbour and all the city and harbour views. So a nice place for lunch or dinner now. Nearby attractions of Maremagnum include the Barcelona Aquarium, the 3D IMAX cinemaand the Barcelona harbour tours.
