<br /><br />Saint Peter showed him to his house, a small cottage on a tiny plot in the woods. The closets were full of simple but servicable clothing, and the kitchen was stocked with the basic needs. Bill slowly settled into a modest and quiet life in heaven.
<br /><br />One day, Bill was walking in one of Heaven's many fine parks, when he ran into a man dressed in a fine tailored suit.
<br /><br />&quot;That is a nice suit, my friend,&quot; said Gates. &quot;Where did you get it?&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;Actually,&quot; the man replied, &quot;I was given a hundred of these when I got here. I've been treated really well. I got a mansion on a hill overlooking a beautiful lake. I have a huge five-hundred acre estate, a golf course, tennis courts and three Rolls Royces.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;Were you the Pope, or a doctor who healed the sick?&quot; asked Gates.
<br /><br />&quot;No,&quot; said his new friend, &quot;Actually, I was the captain of the Titanic.&quot;
<br /><br />Hearing this made Gates so angry that he immediately stalked off to find St. Peter.
<br /><br />Cornering St. Peter, Bill told him about the man he had just met, saying, &quot;How could you give me a paltry new house, while you're
<br />showering new cars, a mansion, and fine suits on the Captain of the Titanic? I invented the Windows operating system! Why does he deserve better?&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;Yes, we use Windows here in heaven,&quot; replied Peter, &quot;and the Titanic only crashed once.&quot;

<br /><br />A mouse looked through the crack in the wall to see the farmer and his wife open a package.
<br /><br />&quot;What food might this contain?&quot; The mouse wondered.
<br /><br />He was devastated to discover it was a mousetrap.
<br /><br />Retreating to the farmyard, the mouse proclaimed this warning, &quot;There is a mousetrap in the house! There is a mousetrap in the house!&quot;
<br /><br />The chicken clucked and scratched, raised her head and said, &quot;Mr. Mouse, I can tell this is a grave concern to you but it is of no consequence to me. I cannot be bothered by it.&quot;
<br /><br />The mouse turned to the pig and told him, &quot;There is a mousetrap in the house! There is a mousetrap in the house!&quot;
<br /><br />The pig sympathized but said, &quot;I am so very sorry, Mr. Mouse, but there is nothing I can do about it but pray. Be assured you are in my prayers.&quot;
<br /><br />The mouse turned to the cow and said, &quot;There is a mousetrap in the house! There is a mousetrap in the house!&quot;
<br /><br />The cow said, &quot;Wow, Mr. Mouse. I'm sorry for you, but it's no skin off my nose.&quot;
<br /><br />So, the mouse returned to the house, head down and dejected, to face the farmer's mousetrap... alone.
<br /><br />That very night a sound was heard throughout the house - the sound of a mousetrap catching its prey.
<br /><br />The farmer's wife rushed to see what was caught. In the darkness, she did not see it.
<br /><br />It was a venomous snake whose tail was caught in the trap.
<br /><br />The snake bit the farmer's wife. The farmer rushed her to the hospital. When she returned home she still had a fever.
<br /><br />Everyone knows you treat a fever with fresh chicken soup so the farmer took his hatchet to the farmyard for the soup's main ingredient.
<br /><br />But his wife's sickness continued.
<br /><br />Friends and neighbors came to sit with her around the clock. To feed them, the farmer butchered the pig.
<br /><br />But, alas, the farmer's wife did not get well...
<br /><br />She died.
<br /><br />So many people came for her funeral that the farmer had the cow slaughtered to provide enough meat for all of them for the funeral luncheon.
<br /><br />And the mouse looked upon it all from his crack in the wall with great sadness.
<br /><br />So, the next time you hear someone is facing a problem and you think it doesn't concern you, remember ---
<br /><br />When one of us is threatened, we are all at risk.
<br /><br />We are all involved in this journey called life. 
<br /><br />We must keep an eye out for one another and make an extra effort to encourage one another.

We naturally don't like change and we don't like to feel sadness or loss so we tend to settle for what makes us feel better, even if it's in a failing situation and in our rational minds we know we shouldn't. You have to be willing to experience the loss and let go. You have to decide that you want more for yourself and when you have, that's when you begin to heal and time will do the rest.&quot;

<br /><br />A women appreciates a man who looks good or at least tries to. Women take great care and effort of what they wear for different occasions and also take note of guys who do the same. Clothes is THE difference between dashing and ordinary. In addition, women do take note of shoes. It explains why they have a whole shoe rack full of shoes. Therefore, choose your shoes wisely too. Although different women have different taste in choice of clothes for men, it is generally acceptable to look neat and tidy. Here are some ways to achieve it.
<br /><br />1. Dressed Suitably
<br /><br />Formal wear are for formal occasions such as dinner in restaurants. T-shirts and jeans are for simple date at the mall. Shorts and singlets are for jogging in your nearby park and so on. You get the picture.
<br /><br />2. Iron your clothes
<br /><br />Its not a very good image to portray if your clothes are crumpled and you go out on a date. A woman will think that you are lazy and do not place any importance on the date.
<br />3. Do NOT wear clothes with vulgarities, sexually suggestive images or words
<br /><br />We know that these clothes might be your favorite as it is very cheeky or portrays your style that you do not give a damn what's happening around. However, its a definite no no for dates as its rude, insensitive and too explicit for any potential girlfriends/wives to take it. 
<br /><br />4. Go for well known , respected brands
<br /><br />We do not want you to show off. However, it is always nice to wear something that lets you get noticed by your date. If branded stuff is not your thing, at least get a simple respected brand that do not portray you as a cheapskate.
<br /><br />5. Ask another women for opinion
<br /><br />Lets face it. Man are pretty hopeless at fashion. That's why we hate shopping.(The clothes look the same anyway) To understand what is appropriate, what is nice on you, it is always good to get a female's opinion. After all, your date is another female and it is your date that is going to judge you on your date.

<br /><br />6. Try to look healthy
<br /><br />Get a tan if you look pale and sickly. Beef yourself up in the gym if you look scrawny. Go running if you're overweight and look fat. Its always important to look healthy and nice in front of your date. It projects a sunny image and women love it.

<br /><br />In case no one has told you, everyone needs time alone -- to get a handle on who you are, to take stock and really get into who you are. We need to cultivate and treasure quiet moments -- to hear the sunrise, and taste the sunset. 
<br /><br />Why renewal? Well, when we get used to seeing the same old things... we tend to ignore and not remember why we do things. The wonder of electricity... is it just a switch for you -- has the wonder of it died away? How about church rituals... just the same old thing or do you really get the inner feeling of what is happening? How about looking at why you are here. Is it just to go to work, feed the kids, pay bills, etc. 
<br /><br />Why are we here? Can you remember? It's like working -- we've done it so much... but we forgot why we work and therefore it becomes a drudgery. Life in general... with all the things happening today... we look at the earth signals as disasters and have forgotten that Mother Earth sends us messages. Have you heard about the meteor that is going to hit some day? Just another incident you say... nay, I say... there is something spiritual going on. 
<br /><br />Renewal can mean to reconnect... a time to be reminded of our inward connection with the divine essence of ourselves which is within... not in the physical world but inside of you. That's why the spiritual aspect is so important... it is so quiet, that you may not hear it. Time-out to remember! 
<br /><br />So what's the purpose of all this? Just to remind you to renew your connection with the Divine within. Demonstrate it in your every day life. Be the unconditional love. Stop judging. Look and know that we are all here in this educational surface (Planet Earth) to learn and to remember who we are. 
<br /><br />I invite you to renew your commitment to Higher Self... to take time for you, to slow down and look at what messages your mind, world, and affairs are showing you. Don't like working at the shop? Too much talk? Look inside. It may be your own internal chatter that you need to stop. Stop it there and it will stop outside. 
<br /><br />Renew your inner spiritual self. Look at the messages that God is telling you everyday. Like the seasons, we must change. If we still are holding on to old beliefs and habits we have had since 19???... we must evolve and become anew. Become the chameleon, change colors with each situation, and demonstrate the divineness within. We must remember to do random acts of kindness and senseless beauty... not just for yourself, but for all of us. 
<br /><br />Reconnect with the aliveness within. And remember to look at every situation in your life as God's particular dealing with your soul. The next time something happens that is out of the ordinary in your life or in the world, see if you can figure out the message. Remember God talks to us all day long. It's up to us to become open enough to hear and correctly interpret messages. So let's listen to our still small voice and remember.... you are holy. Walk it, live it, and be it! 
<br /><br />The more we let our own Divinity shine, the more we will light up the path for others. So take time to nurture your Light and let it shine!
