<br /><br />Anybody under the age of 13 should not read this,
<br />and if you do, you should not repost this.
<br />Just because you were born in '97 doesn't mean you're a 90's kid.
<br />It's not like you could remember the original Simpsons.
<br />I am sorry but three conscious years of the 90's just wont cut it.
<br />You're a 90's kid if:
<br />You can finish this [ice ice _ _ _ _ ]
<br />You remember watching Doug, Ren &amp; Stimpy, Pinky and the Brain and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
<br />AAAAAAAH Real Monsters!
<br />You've ever ended a sentence with the word &quot;PSYCHE!&quot;
<br />You just cant resist finishing this . . . &quot;Iiiiiiin west philidelphia born and raised . . .&quot;
<br />You remember TGIF, Step by Step, Family Matters, Dinosaurs, and Boy Meets World, mighty machines, and Thomas the tank engine, as well as Mr.Dressup.
<br />You remember when it was actually worth getting up early
<br />on a Saturday to watch cartoons.
<br />You got super excited when it was Oregon Trail day in computer class at school.
<br />You remember reading &quot;Goosebumps&quot;
<br />You took plastic cartoon lunch boxes to school.
<br />You still get the urge to say &quot;NOT&quot; after (almost) every sentence . . . not
<br />when everything was settled by rock paper scissors..or bubble gum bubble gum in a dish...and even better daddy had a donkey inky binky bonky.
<br />when you'd go to the same freakin place on a field trip every freakin year
<br />when britney spears was cool and backstreet and nsync were gods.
<br />when cops and robbers was a daily activity.
<br />when we played Hide and go seek until our legs grew numb.
<br />when we used to obey our parents
<br />You used to listen to the radio all day long just to record your FAVORITE song of ALL time.
<br />&quot;Where in the World is Carmen San Diego?&quot; was both a game and a TV game show.
<br />Captain Planet. He's a Hero.
<br />You knew that Kimberly, the pink ranger, and Tommy, the green ranger, were meant to be together.
<br />You remember when Super Nintendos and Sega Genesis became popular.
<br />You always wanted to send in a tape to America's Funniest Home Videos . . . but never taped anything funny.
<br />You remember watching Home Alone 1, 2 , and 3 . . . and tried to pull the pranks on &quot;intruders&quot;
<br />You remember watching The Magic School Bus, Wishbone, and Reading Rainbow on PBS.
<br />You remember when Yo-Yos were cool.
<br />You remember those Where's Waldo books.
<br />You remember eating Warheads.
<br />You remember watching the 1st Batman, Aladdin, Ninja Turtles, and 3 Ninjas movies.
<br />You remember Ring Pops.
<br />You remember drinking Surge, and Tang.
<br />If you remember when every thing was &quot;da BOMB!&quot;
<br />When they made the new lunchables so that you could make pizza AND tacos.
<br />You remember boom boxes vs. cd players.
<br />Making those little paper fortune cookie things, and then predicting your life with them.
<br />You played and/or collected &quot;Pogs&quot;
<br />You had at least one Tamagotchi, GigaPet, or Nano and brought it everywhere.
<br />. . . Furbies.
<br />You haven't always had a computer, and it was cool to have the internet.
<br />And Windows 95 was the best.
<br />You watched the original cartoons of Rugrats, Power Rangers, The original Transforms, and Ninja Turtles.
<br />Michael Jordan was a king.
<br />YIKES pencils and erasers were the stuff!
<br />All your school supplies were &quot;Lisa Frank&quot; brand.
<br />You remember when the new Beanie Babies and Talking Elmo were always sold out.
<br />You collected those Beanie Babies.
<br />Carebears
<br />Gak was the coolest stuff invented.
<br />Lambchop's song never ended.

<br />You remember a time before the WB.
<br />You collected all the Troll dolls
<br />If you even know what an original Walkman is.
<br />You remember wanting to sit on the orange Nickelodeon couch.
<br />You've gotten creeped out by &quot;Are You Afraid of the Dark?&quot;
<br />You know the Macarena by heart.
<br />&quot;Talk to the hand&quot; . . . enough said
<br />You always said, &quot;Then why don't you marry it!&quot;
<br />You know the significance of the number 23.
<br />When you played Super Mario on a daily basis.
<br />Gameboy Pockets.
<br />You went to McDonald's to play in the playplace.
<br />You remember playing on merry go rounds at the playground.
<br />Before the MySpace frenzy . . .
<br />Before the Internet &amp; text messaging . . .
<br />Before Sidekicks &amp; iPods . . .
<br />Before Panic at the Disco . . .
<br />Before PlayStation or X-BOX . . .
<br />Before Spongebob . . .
<br />Back when you put off the 5 hours of homework you had every night.
<br />Back when &quot;U Can't Touch This&quot; was one of your favorite songs.
<br />Back when Offspring was cool.
<br />When carrying cellphones was difficult. 
<br />When light up sneakers were cool.
<br />When you rented VHS tapes, not DVDs.
<br />When gas was $0.95 a gallon &amp; Caller ID was a new thing.
<br />When we recorded stuff on VCRs.
<br />When we called the radio station to request songs to hear off of our walkmans.
<br />Pokemon and digimon were on the rage!
<br />Way back.
<br />Before we realized all this would eventually disappear.
<br />Who would have thought you'd miss the 90's so much!!!!!
<br /><br />If you have new ideas to add to this, just let me know<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/4210//smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" />

		<document id="ad90796118edd0192a43b610fb1ceb8f" url=""><![CDATA[Love letter. (from hillaryluv)<br/><br/>As far as the east is from the west, that's how far my love is for you.  I wish to be with you always, but right now, I can not, and that is why I write you now.  My heart yearns for you to be by my side, holding my waist, caressing my cheek bones, kissing my neck.  
<br /><br />I can not describe my love for you in words without making it imperfect.  All I can say to barely describe my feelings for you is that I gave you the keys to my heart, and you unlocked a series of emotions I have only felt when experiencing God.
<br /><br />I praise the Lord daily and nightly for bringing you into my life.  You must have been sent from Heaven.  You are my Guardian Angel, my love, my dear, my all.
<br /><br />With every stroke of my pen, or every key touched to make this letter, my love grows stronger.  I think of you consistently.  I love you eternally.  From the moment our eyes met, I fell in love with you, and my love has been ever growing for you.
