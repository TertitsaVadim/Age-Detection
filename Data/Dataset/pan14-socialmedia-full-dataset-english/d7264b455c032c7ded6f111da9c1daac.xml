<br />The first part is called &quot;the pledge&quot;.
<br />The magician shows you something ordinary.
<br />The second act is called &quot;the turn&quot;.
<br />The magician takes the ordinary something and makes it into something extraordinary.
<br />But you wouldn't clap yet, because making something disappear,isn't enough. 
<br />You have to bring it back.
<br />Now you're looking for the secret.
<br />But you won't find it, because,of course, you're not really looking.
<br />You don't really want to work it out.
<br />You want to be fooled.

<br /><br />1-Free your heart from hatred.
<br /><br />2-Free your mind from worries.
<br /><br />3-Live simply.
<br /><br />4-Give more.
<br /><br />5-Expect less.
<br /><br />No one can go back and make a new start.Anyone can start from now and make a brand new ending.
<br /><br />God didn`t promise days without pain,lauther without sorrow, sun without rain,but God did promise strength for the day,comfort for the tears,and light for the way.
<br /><br />Disapointment are like road humps,they slow you down a bit but you enjoy the smooth road afterwards.Don`t stay on the humps too long.Move on!
<br /><br />When you feel down because you didn`t get what you want,just sit tight and be happy,because God is thinking or something better to give you.
<br /><br />When something happens to you,good or bad,consider what it means.There`s a purpose to life`s events,to teach you how to laugh more or not to cry too hard.
<br /><br />You can`t make someone love you,all you can do is be someone who can be loved,the rest is up to the person to realize your worth.
<br /><br />The measure of love is when you without measure.In life there are very rare chances that you`ll meet the person you love and loves you in return.So once you have it don`t ever let go,the chance might never come your way again.
<br /><br />It`s better to lose your pride to the one you love,than to lose the one you love because of pride.
<br /><br />We spend too much time looking for the right person to love or finding fault with those we already love, when instead we should be perfecting the love we give.
<br /><br />When you truly care for someone,you don`t lok for faults,you don`t look for answers,you don`t look for mistakes. Instead,you fight the mistakes,youaccept the faults, and you overlook the excuses.
<br /><br />Never abandon an old friend.You will never find one who can take his(or her) place.
<br /><br />Friendship is like wine,it gets better as it grows older.When you receive this,you know you are cherished.

<br />Thy Protestant to be
<br />Or bid me love, and I will give
<br />A loving heart to thee
<br /><br />A heart as soft, a heart as kind
<br />A heart as sound and free
<br />As in the whole world thou canst find
<br />That heart I'll give to thee
<br /><br />Bid that heart stay, and it will stay
<br />To honor thy decrees
<br />Or bid it languish quite away
<br />And't shall do so for thee
<br /><br />Bid me to weep, and I will weep
<br />While I have eyes to see
<br />And, having none, yet I will keep
<br />A heart to weep for thee
<br /><br />Bid me despair and I'll despair
<br />Under that cypress-tree
<br />Or bid me die, and I will dare
<br />E'en death to die for thee
<br /><br />Thou art my life, my love, my heart
<br />The very eyes of me
<br />And hast command of every part
<br />To live and die for thee

<br /><br />The best things are nearest : light in your eyes , flower at your feet . duties at your hands , the path of god just before you . then why grasp at the stars . do life's common work instead and be assured that the daily duties are the sweetest things of life .....

His father gave him a bag full of nails and said to him, “My son, I want you to hammer a nail into our garden fence every time you need to direct your anger against something and you lose your temper.” 
<br /><br />So the son started to follow his father’s advice. On the first day he hammered in 37 nails, but getting the nails into the fence was not easy, so he started trying to control himself when he got . As the days went by, he was hammering in less nails, and within weeks he was able to control himself and was able to refrain from getting and from hammering nails. He came to his father and told him what he had achieved. His father was with his efforts and said to him: “But now, my son, you have to take out a nail for every day that you do not get .” 
<br /><br />The son started to take out the nails for each day that he did not get , until there were no nails left in the fence. 
<br /><br />He came to his father and told him what he had achieved. His father took him to the fence and said, “My son, you have done well, but look at these holes in the fence. This fence will never be the same again.” Then he added: “When you say things in a state of anger, they leave marks like these holes on the hearts of others. You can stab a person and withdraw the knife but it doesn’t matter how many times you say ‘I’m sorry,’ because the wound will remai

<br />In the equations and logics...
<br />that lead to reason.
<br />But after a lifetime of such pursuits,
<br />I ask,
<br />what truly is logic?
<br />Who decides reason?
<br />My quest has taken me through the physical,
<br />the metaphysical,
<br />the delusional...
<br />and back.
<br />And I have made the most important discovery of my career.
<br />The most important discovery of my life.
<br />It is only in the mysterious equations of love...
<br />that any logical|reasons can be found.
<br />I'm only here tonight because of you.
<br />You are the reason I am.
<br />You are all my reasons.
<br />Thank you.

<br /><br />DON 'T cry over anyone who won't cry over y ou.
<br /><br />Good FRIENDS are hard to find, harder to leave, and impossible to forget.

<br />love is a temporary madness.
<br />It erupts like an earthquake and then subsides.
<br />And when it subsides you have to make a decision.
<br />You have to work out whether your roots have become
<br />so entwined together that it is inconceivable
<br />that you should ever part.
<br />Because this is what love is.
<br />Love is not breathlessness, 
<br />it is not excitement, it is not the promulgation 
<br />of promises of eternal passion.
<br />That is just being &quot;in love&quot; which any of us
<br />can convince ourselves we are. 
<br />Love itself is what is left over 
<br />when being in love has burned away,
<br />and this is both an art and a fortunate accident.
