<br />i don't know for i couldn't even count the days i was crying, losing someone and loving someone is different yet every aspect of it tells me nothing that the incorrigible truth is that it really hurts when you love especially if the other doesn't love you. its better to lose someone for you know where they will be. but in loving someone there is only trust that is mostly not in use anymore for its hard these days to trust and believe in someone. everywhere you look, and being observant, you will smell lies anywhere scattered among the streets, malls, business centers, and meetings of the elite, there's nothing you could do about it cause you yourself know that you also lie, its true i know cause i've done it many times before. as a person with such limited experience, i've already seen the world at its gruesome face, yet i know the worst is still to come. i wanted to forget it yet there's nothing i can do to stop, nor forget it; cause were born to live with it, but within my past i buried it covered it discreetly and finally had myself diminish it from my own memory, but no matter how i repress it, my emotions keeps it hanging back to existence trying to run my life in complete disarray for there's nothing but pain and hatred inside....

With so  much in mind and goals beyond others reach, is laid my intentions for others. Looking  through a new perspective and demeanor was a living strength for me to uphold. i was trapped in the past and lived there for years with nothing in my thoughts but to hold you near. and now that i found something else to behold i finally gave you up and moved on and its when i realized that i've been there for long and i have forgotten more important things in my life. but now i'm carefree as before and dreamt of you again, only this time i know you'll never really be mine, and such truth still brings heartache, yet i continue to do so, for i know that time shall heal what destiny has scarred in me

Am i a sacrifice? i ask myself... for what? for all these inhumanities and sins this world has committed, then do so. i am bound to death that's what i think and this is all i have.  as fate had my destiny compromised, it binded me with hate and anger never happiness. My hearts content is so void its all black and gray, not a single space for the colors of life, nor the rainbow of each passing moment...

<br />i feel blank today like a sheet of paper unused, unwritten and totally nothing in the page. i'm so spaced out that sleeping the whole day was the only remedy, a mere junction in my life where an example of boring disgrace has fallen upon me, there's nothing to do but i'm confused its like the weather is with me i thought it was goin to rain but there was none. i dreamt the whole day thinking that i was out there everywhere and nowhere enjoying the satisfaction of living something you always wanted, but i always woke up and look at the ceiling knowing i was the one who made it and its not gonna come true. emptiness what does it mean? a void, a blankness, nothingness, a black hole ........
<br /><br />i wanted to do something, but my body wouldn't just cooperate, my mind couldn't cope, and i myself doesn't like it at all. and all the willingness in my body left me hanging in the edge of life.  i just wish i could change in a whim, be a different person, have a different life, thats what were all aiming for but i just can't reach mine. *sigh* i'm not tired, i just want changes i want to be something, someone with a purpose, a direction in life, and someone to be with in every step of that way. i wanted to be simple, but maybe circumstances wouldn't just allow me to be one. well i'll just wait for the mean time for what destiny has declared and fate had said i shall concede.

<br />I just want, to know where are you now? what are you doing? and lastly what do you feel? i didn't have the courage to ask, the strength to say it to you. to question you about your feelings and tell you mine too. and maybe i was right in deciding that i really should forget you and don't tell you anything cause in the end i know i'll just embarass myself, if only i know what you feel fo r me , then maybe, just maybe i could sleep well and not wonder in my dreams about what could happen. if only i did and said what i should have a long time ago. but maybe that wasn't right either for my insecurities denied me of my rights to come and be free, to break my shell, and walk proud amidst all those vain people. that i could be proud of what i am inside not only outside. yet i still fathom which part you played in it you were used by other people and you used them too, but in the middle of it all is your undecipherable behavior, disguised attitude, and mysterious personality, but i know who you were, and what you did and still do i really didn't want to know you but maybe love is just as persistent as an athlete to win, but mine failed its will to win....

<br /><br />i'm a complex person that describing myself in simple means is such a hard thing to do. 18 yrs. have passed and i'm still alive, looking for the reason why i'm living this distorted life. beyond this constant disturbance and indistinct environment, i had struggled won and losed some fights, but i still kept going and living, weary and tired lonely and confused. what am i  supposed to do, where should i go? Questions that i kept on thinking, pondering, hoping for the answers to flow in and end this confusion. i keep saying i should forgive myself, but i can't the truth brought out too much pain. unable to bare my soul, i had accumulated much of the hurt inside....
<br /><br />changes have come and passed, events happened and things got different. my life is just a tiny piece of the entire structure trying to fit itself. as the webs of lies intertwine itself the load got heavier and its strings broke apart leaving mine in a shattered state of fear and alarm hiding itself looking for a safer place inside this dark core in my life.
<br /><br />i own my life, better yet i am my life this is me, this is what i am. a few know me or else no one really does. i can open up, but never bare my soul completely as i am an archetype of lies, i have beliefs, which i can never believe and truths that can never be complete. shattered and scattered moments, is in my mind, yet i could never accept in my life.

<br />everything felt so right, i felt so happy in the outside yet
<br />my insides felt so empty, so hollowed its as though my mind left my body with no soul and my heart which is restless found a void to dwell upon nothing in it but darkness that gives me a sense of emptiness , when will i accept that you cannot be mine. how many times have i told myself that loving you was wrong, but then again i cant help myself, wondering how great it could be if you would only love me? a longing in my heart that only you can satisfy how will i accept my fate? my destiny?  acceptance is very hard for me to do, cause everynight your memories come back to me just as it has been flown away with the wind, in my memoirs its only you, in you where i found that great happiness in which i would always have and to never let go........
<br /><br />but you can never ever be mine. how stupid of me to think that one day you would also love me as i love you, that one day i'll forget. goodbye is all i could say for nothing more hurts than saying i love you to someone who wouldn't accept it , what lies ahead of me is my future full of dark void ready to swallow me... my wholeness is incomplete , my life is ruined, but it can never solve that problem, only i can reduce myself to such position. while i fantasize, and dream which is free but it hurts to know it will never be real </span></strong>

<br />i haven't expected anything like it at all, i was just there doing nothing, but suddenly you made my heart beat frantically, and just seeing you can't satisfy my craving, every smile you made completed my day and every moments we shared i savored and treasured in my heart. then suddenly you vanished, , but not literally, you vanished in a sense that your old self disappeared you changed; and i was hurt, it caused me pain to see you differently, everything was wrecked,and my heart was in pieces. unbearable as it may seem, but i continued my facade of strength. time passed by still you continued to changed, yet i hoped that you would one day come back. and you did, you came back you were there again and told me, you wanted me back too, but you know what it was already too late cause someone had already patched up my heart again so i could forget the past and i made it, i forgot all about you. i can't come back to you either, you know why? because this person showed me a clearer future than you did, cared for me that you never did, loved me openly not like you did keeping it to yourself, who told me words you never cared to say, and loved me more than you would ever do. maybe the truth is you really didn't love me, you just needed me by your side to guide your lost soul and i didn't care too, as long i continued loving you silently and even just hiding it to myself. it may have been Unrequited love  for all i care, though time healed my dilemma, and destiny brought you back, but fate gave me a chance for love, its just that its not you, not anymore,

As i try to close my eyes and sleep away the rest of the night, my mind found your face amongst the past treasures i buried. I didn't know why, but you popped up from nowhere ready to haunt my dreams, vulnerable as it may seem but i guess you still own a part of my heart that has always been yours. You may not be here, but our memories are. You make up a piece in my life, though it was lost  because of hate, but i found again for forgiveness is the only for me to start getting over you. There's this place, a special one that will always be yours, the 'First' to have my heart  and broke it again and again, yet a part of it clings to those moments we had, even though i know not all of it was true. I just hope that this end with a new shining horizon and a new happiness to be found and experienced. Hoping that one day i'll find the right one, the unperfect one, that'll complete my life. . .

<br /><br />hollow as it was, it still felt unfair, knowing that i should have been happy and laughing it loud, yet i got what i didn't bargain for, the consequences of my past actions. it doesn't feel so fullfilling anymore the nights of endless pursuit, and the dreams of things that will and may never happen. maybe its time to try loving myself the way i used to, cause it seems like insecurity and jealousy have seeped up under my skin threatening to engulf my heart into the dark abyss of unhappiness. 
<br /><br />blaming anybody won't solve anything, pointing fingers to anyone won't give me solutions and the only way to get rid of something is to try and think it over. but right now my mind is rattled by the continuous struggle over life and temptations, trying to avoid flaws and any more transgressions. disappointment and embarrassment emotions i know very closely, and experienced verly highly but in the end it helped me endure what others haven't. life in all fairness will always be unexpected, unfair and endless 'till you end it yourself and or nature takes it for you......
