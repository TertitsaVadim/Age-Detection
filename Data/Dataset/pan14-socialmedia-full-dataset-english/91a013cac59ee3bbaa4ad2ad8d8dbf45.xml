<br />Handy in an emergency, but otherwise they just look silly. 
<br /><br />Lads are like ... Coffee 
<br />The best ones are rich, warm, full-bodied and can keep you up all night long. 
<br /><br />Lads are like ... Parking spots. 
<br />The good ones are taken, and the ones that are left are extremely small. 
<br /><br />Lads are like ... Cement 
<br />After getting laid, they take a long time to get hard. 
<br /><br />Lads are like ... Chocolate Bars 
<br />Sweet, smooth, and they usually head right for your hips. 
<br /><br />Lads are like ... Mini skirts. 
<br />If you're not careful, they'll creep up your legs. 
<br /><br />Lads are like ... Bananas. 
<br />The older they get, the less firm they are. 
<br /><br />Lads are like ... Horoscopes 
<br />They always tell you what to do, and are usually wrong. 
<br /><br />Lads are like ... Weather 
<br />Nothing can be done to change them. 
<br /><br />Lads are like ... Snowstorms 
<br />They sound exciting, but you never know when it's coming, how many inches you'll get, or how long it will last.

<br /><br />other boys
<br /><br />his age rather
<br /><br />curious.
<br /><br />He had been hearing quite a bit
<br /><br />about 'making out'
<br /><br />from the older boys, and he wondered
<br /><br />what it was
<br /><br />and how it was done.
<br /><br />One day he took his question to his
<br /><br />mother, who
<br /><br />became rather flustered. Instead of
<br /><br />explaining
<br /><br />things to Johnny, she told him to hide
<br /><br />behind the
<br /><br />curtains one night and watch his older
<br /><br />sister and
<br /><br />her boyfriend.
<br /><br />This he did. The following morning,
<br /><br />Johnny
<br /><br />described EVERYTHING to his mother.
<br /><br />&quot;Sis and her boyfriend sat and talked for
<br /><br />a while,
<br /><br />then he turned off most of the lights.
<br /><br />Then he
<br /><br />started kissing and hugging her. I
<br /><br />figured 'Sis must
<br /><br />be getting sick, because her face started
<br /><br />looking
<br /><br />funny.
<br /><br />He must have thought so too, because he
<br /><br />put his
<br /><br />hand inside her blouse to feel her heart,
<br /><br />just the
<br /><br />way the doctor would. Except he's not as
<br /><br />smart as
<br /><br />the doctor because he seemed to have
<br /><br />trouble
<br /><br />finding her heart. I guess he was getting
<br /><br />sick too,
<br /><br />because pretty soon both of them started
<br /><br />panting
<br /><br />and getting all out of breath.
<br /><br />His other hand must have been cold
<br /><br />because he
<br /><br />put it under her skirt.
<br /><br />About this time 'Sis got worse and began
<br /><br />to moan
<br /><br />and sigh and squirm around and slide
<br /><br />down
<br /><br />toward
<br /><br />the end of the couch. This was when her
<br /><br />fever
<br /><br />started. I knew it was a fever, because Sis
<br /><br />told him
<br /><br />she felt really hot.
<br /><br />Finally, I found out what was making
<br /><br />them so
<br /><br />sick......-a big eel ;had gotten inside his
<br /><br />pants
<br /><br />somehow. It just jumped out of his pants
<br /><br />and
<br /><br />stood there, about 10 inches long,
<br /><br />honest, anyway
<br /><br />he grabbed it in one hand to keep it from
<br /><br />getting
<br /><br />away.
<br /><br />When Sis saw it, she got really scared-her
<br /><br />eyes
<br /><br />got big, and her mouth fell open, and
<br /><br />she started
<br /><br />calling out to God and stuff like that. She
<br /><br />said it
<br /><br />was the biggest one she's ever seen; I
<br /><br />should tell
<br /><br />her about the ones down at the lake by
<br /><br />our house!
<br /><br />Anyway, Sis got brave and tried to kill the
<br /><br />eel by
<br /><br />biting its head off.The eel spit on her face
<br /><br />a little bit and then, All of a sudden she
<br /><br />grabbed it
<br /><br />with both hands and held it tight while he
<br /><br />took a
<br /><br />muzzle out of his pocket and slipped it
<br /><br />over the
<br /><br />eel's head to keep it from biting again.
<br /><br />Sis lay back and spread her legs so she
<br /><br />could get
<br /><br />a scissor-lock on it and he helped by lying
<br /><br />on top
<br /><br />of the eel. The eel put up a hell of a
<br /><br />fight.
<br /><br />Sis started groaning and squealing and
<br /><br />her
<br /><br />boyfriend almost upset the couch. I guess
<br /><br />they
<br /><br />wanted to kill the eel by squashing it
<br /><br />between
<br /><br />them.
<br /><br />After a while they both quit moving and
<br /><br />gave a
<br /><br />great sigh. Her boyfriend got up, and sure
<br /><br />enough,
<br /><br />they killed the eel. I knew because it just
<br /><br />hung
<br /><br />there, limp, and some of its insides were
<br /><br />hanging
<br /><br />out.
<br /><br />Sis and her boyfriend were a little tired
<br /><br />from the
<br /><br />battle, but they went back to courting
<br /><br />anyway. He
<br /><br />started hugging and kissing her again. By
<br /><br />golly,
<br /><br />the eel wasn't dead! It jumped straight up
<br /><br />and
<br /><br />started to fight again.
<br /><br />I guess eels are like cats- they have nine
<br /><br />lives or
<br /><br />something. This time, Sis jumped up and
<br /><br />tried to
<br /><br />kill it by sitting on it. After about a 35
<br /><br />minute
<br /><br />struggle, they finally killed the eel. I knew
<br /><br />it was
<br /><br />dead, because I saw Sis's boyfriend peel
<br /><br />its skin
<br /><br />off and flush it down the toilet.

<br />&gt;read it every day.
<br /><br />&gt;You may not realise it, but it's 100% true.
<br /><br />&gt;1. There are at least two people in this world that you would die for. 
<br />&gt;2. At least 15 people in this world love you in some way.
<br />&gt;3. The only reason anyone would ever hate you is because they want to be
<br />&gt;just like you.
<br />&gt;4. A smile from you can bring happiness to anyone, even if they don't 
<br />&gt;like you.
<br />&gt;5. Every night, SOMEONE thinks about you before they go to sleep.
<br />&gt;6. You mean the world to someone.
<br />&gt;7. You are special and unique.
<br />&gt;8. Someone that you don't even know exists loves you. 
<br />&gt;9. When you make the biggest mistake ever, something good comes from it.
<br /><br />&gt;10. When you think the world has turned its back on you take another
<br />&gt;look.
<br />&gt;11. Always remember the compliments you received. Forget about the rude 
<br />&gt;remarks.
<br /><br />&gt;If you are a loving friend, send this to everyone, including the one
<br />&gt;that sent it to you.
<br /><br />&gt;If you get it back, then they really do love you.
<br /><br />&gt;And always remember... when life hands you a Lemon, ask for tequila and 
<br />&gt;salt and call me over!
<br /><br />&gt;Good friends are like stars...
<br />&gt; You don't always see them,
<br />&gt; But you know they are always there.

<br />She asks him why he is staring.
<br />He replies: &quot;I have a question to ask you, but I don't want to offend you&quot;.
<br />She answers, &quot; My son, you cannot offend me. When you're as old as I am and
<br />have been a nun as long as I have, you get a chance to see and hear just

<br /># 1, you have to be single and # 2, you must be Catholic.&quot;
<br /><br />The cab driver is very excited and says, &quot;Yes, I'm single and Catholic!&quot;
<br />&quot;OK&quot; the nun says. &quot;Pull into the next alley.&quot;maybe we will see what we can do.
<br /><br />The nun fulfills his fantasy with a kiss that would make a hooker blush.
<br />But when they get back on the road, the cab driver starts crying.
<br /><br />&quot;My dear child,&quot; said the nun, why are you crying?&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;Forgive me but I've sinned. I lied. I must confess, I'm married and I'm
<br />Jewish.&quot;
<br /><br />The nun says, &quot;That's OK, my name is Kevin and I'm going to a Halloween
<br />party.&quot;

You'll break hearts too, ???so remember how it felt when yours was broken.??? You'll fight with your best friend.??? You'll blame a new love for things an old one did.??? You'll cry because time is passing too fast, ??? and you'll eventually lose someone you love.???

<br />Stuff a miniature marshmallow in the bottom of a sugar cone to 
<br />prevent icecream drips. 
<br /><br />The Real Woman's Way 
<br />Just suck the ice cream out of the bottom of the cone, for God's sake. 
<br />You are probably lying on the couch with your feet up eating it 
<br />anyway. 
<br /><br />Delia's Way 
<br />To keep potatoes from budding, place an apple in the bag with the 
<br />potatoes. 
<br /><br />The Real Woman's Way 
<br />Buy Smash and keep it in the cupboard for up to a year. 
<br /><br />Delia's Way 
<br />When a cake recipe calls for flouring the baking tin, use a bit of the 
<br />dry cake mix instead and there won't be any white mess on the outside 
<br />of the cake. 
<br /><br />The Real Woman's Way 
<br />Tescos' sell cakes. They even do decorated versions. 
<br /><br />Delia's Way 
<br />If you accidentally over-salt a dish while it's still cooking, drop in 
<br />a potato slice. 
<br /><br />The Real Woman's Way 
<br />If you over salt a dish while you are cooking, that's tough. Please 
<br />recite with me the Real Woman's motto: &quot;I made it and you will eat it 
<br />and I don't care how bad it tastes.&quot; 
<br /><br />Delia's Way 
<br />Wrap celery in aluminum foil when putting in the refrigerator and it 
<br />will keep for weeks 
<br /><br />The Real Woman's Way 
<br />It could keep forever. Who eats it? 
<br /><br />Delia's Way 
<br />Cure for headaches: Take a lime, cut it in half and rub it on your 
<br />forehead. The throbbing will go away. 
<br /><br />The Real Woman's Way 
<br />Cure for headaches: Take a lime, cut it in half and drop it in 8 
<br />ounces of vodka.Drink the vodka. You might still have the headache, 
<br />but you wont give a damn? 
<br /><br />Delia's Way 
<br />If you have a problem opening jars, try using latex dishwashing 
<br />gloves. They give a non-slip grip that makes opening jars easy. 
<br /><br />The Real Woman's Way 
<br />Why do I have a man? 
<br /><br />Finally the most important tip 
<br /><br />Delia'sWay 
<br />Freeze leftover wine into ice cubes for future use in casseroles 
<br /><br />The Real Woman's Way 
<br />left over wine???? Hello!!!!!

<br /><br />They arrive at the club and the doorman says, &quot;Hey, Dave! How ya doin'?&quot;
<br /><br />His wife is puzzled and asks if he's been to this club before.
<br />&quot;Oh, no,&quot; says Dave. &quot;He's on my bowling team.&quot;
<br /><br />When they are seated, a waitress asks Dave if he'd like his usual and brings over a Budweiser.
<br /><br />His wife is becoming increasingly uncomfortable and says,&quot;How did she know that you drink Budweiser?&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;She's in the Ladies' Bowling League, honey. We share lanes with them.&quot;
<br /><br />A stripper then comes over to their table, throws her arms around Dave, and says &quot;Hi Davey. Want your usual table dance, big boy?&quot;
<br /><br />Dave's wife, now furious, grabs her purse and storms out of the club.
<br /><br />Dave follows and spots her getting into a cab. Before she can slam the door, he jumps in beside her. He tries desperately to explain how the stripper must have mistaken him for someone else, but his wife is having none of it. She is screaming at him at the top of her lungs, calling him every name in the book.
<br /><br />The cabby turns his head and says, &quot;Looks like you picked up a real bitch tonight, Dave.&quot;

<br />He walks into an ordinary well furnished waiting room and strips. Minutes later, a naked, drop dead gorgeous, young girl walks in.
<br />&quot;Hello&quot; she says &quot;I'm your personal trainer, and if you can catch me, you can fuck me!!&quot;
<br />After an hour of chasing her in and around the furniture a bell rings
<br />&quot;Better luck next time&quot; she says 
<br />When he gets home he discovers he's lost 3 kilos.
<br />&quot;Wow&quot; he says to himself &quot;I'm definitely going back there&quot;
<br />The next day day he comes back for his next session, again he's told to go in and strip, but while he's waiting he decides to push all the furniture to one side to give himself a better chance. Just as he's finished doing that a 7 foot tall, big muscled, hairy man walks in.
<br />&quot;Hello&quot; he says &quot;I'm your personal trainer, and if I catch you, I'm going to fuck you!!&quot;

<br /><br />He orders the guy out of bed and ties him to a chair, while tying the girl to the bed he gets on top of her, kisses her neck, then gets up and goes into the bathroom. While he's in there, the husband tells his wife:
<br /><br />&quot;Listen, this guy's an escaped convict, look at his clothes! He probably spent lots of time in jail and hasn't seen a woman in years. I saw how he kissed your neck.&quot; If he wants sex, don't resist, don't complain, do whatever he tells you. Satisfy him no matter how much he nauseates you. This guy is probably very dangerous. If he gets angry, he'll kill us. Be strong, honey. I love you.&quot;
<br /><br />To which his wife responds: &quot;He wasn't kissing my neck. He wwas whispering in my ear. He told me he was gay, thought you were cute, and asked me if we had any vaseline. I told him it was in the bathroom. Be strong honey. I love you too!!&quot;
