<br /><br />Every girl wants that one guy that will make her smile when she sees him, hears his voice, or when he's near her.
<br />Every girl wants that one guy that she'll never forget, no matter what happens
<br />Every girl wants that one guy that she can be near and feel safe like the only thing to fear is the unforever
<br />Every girl wants that one guy who will make her laugh when she's crying, but only after he put his arm around her and says it's ok... even though he doesn't know whats wrong
<br />Every girl wants that one guy that says it's hard being so far away, even if he's only on the other side of the room
<br /><br />How cliche in the most unforgettable way, because every girl wants to be with that one guy that makes her feel special, like she's some one, and no matter what any one tells her, she will always think back to that one guy who made her smile, made her laugh, who helped her find herself,  and who was simply there to make her day better, no matter how far away, how near, or how crabby she was.  
<br /><br />It sounds like that song every one knows that everyone gets sick of after being played on the radio one too many times, but everyone still loves it, because its still a good song, if it wasn't the radio wouldn't have played it in the first place. 
<br /><br />It sounds like an everyday cinderella story, but instead of meeting him &amp; falling in love immediately, it's the simple wants of that one girl that helps her find her prince charming, and that one dance when they first start to like each other even though they don't know each other yet, but it comes in time.
<br /><br />The story of the everyday girl who wants to find her prince charming, that one guy, that one moment, the unforgettable cliche.

<br /><br />I'm 15 for a moment
<br />Caught in between 10 and 20
<br />And I'm just dreaming
<br />Counting the ways to where you are 
<br />I'm 22 for a moment
<br />She feels better than ever
<br />And we're on fire
<br />Making our way back from Mars 
<br />15 there's still time for you
<br />Time to buy and time to lose
<br />15, there's never a wish better than this
<br />When you only got 100 years to live 
<br />I'm 33 for a moment
<br />Still the man, but you see I'm a they
<br />A kid on the way
<br />A family on my mind 
<br />I'm 45 for a moment
<br />The sea is high
<br />And I'm heading into a crisis
<br />Chasing the years of my life
<br />15 there's still time for you
<br />Time to buy, Time to lose yourself
<br />Within a morning star 
<br />15 I'm all right with you
<br />15, there's never a wish better than this
<br />When you only got 100 years to live 
<br />Half time goes by
<br />Suddenly you’re wise
<br />Another blink of an eye
<br />67 is gone
<br />The sun is getting high
<br />We're moving on... 
<br />I'm 99 for a moment
<br />Dying for just another moment
<br />And I'm just dreaming
<br />Counting the ways to where you are 
<br />15 there's still time for you
<br />22 I feel her too
<br />33 you’re on your way
<br />Every day's a new day... 
<br />15 there's still time for you
<br />Time to buy and time to choose
<br />Hey 15, there's never a wish better than this
<br />When you only got 100 years to live
