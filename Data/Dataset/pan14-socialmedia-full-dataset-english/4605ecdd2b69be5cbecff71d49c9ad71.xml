<br />staring at the dusty yellow ceiling.
<br />I know his eyes are glazing
<br />over my body like honey
<br />over a raw ham shank.
<br />The mattress is damp
<br />with sweat and encrusted
<br />with semen stains.
<br />Jayson leans over my abdomen;
<br />he gawks at my breasts,
<br />saliva running down his chin.
<br />He takes off his wire frame
<br />glasses then fixes his
<br />beady black eyes into mine.
<br />I feel the warm vapor
<br />of his breath nestling on
<br />my brow, then I sneeze.
<br />He licks the mucus off my lips.
<br />&quot;Oh Jayson&quot; I coo.
<br />I close my eyes and feel
<br />his rough ginger beard
<br />and his ochre nose
<br />slowly trailing down
<br />my stomach, then,
<br />his wet and flaccid
<br />tongue entering me
<br />like a cold snail.
<br />I wait for a few minutes
<br />whilst it nestles inside
<br />my vagina, listening to
<br />him breathe through his
<br />stuffed up nostrils.
<br />I accidentally let off wind,
<br />but thankfully it's silent.
<br />Then he resurfaces, coughing
<br />and scraping my pubic hair off his tongue.
<br />I sit up and inspect his penis
<br />in its full priapic glory.
<br />I imagine it entering me
<br />at magnificent speed,
<br />continuously thrusting.
<br />I imagine it entering with
<br />the force of the atom bomb on Hiroshima,
<br />like the Eurostar through the channel tunnel.
<br />&quot;Sorry&quot;, he says,
<br />&quot;I don't have any condoms.&quot;
<br />&quot;Alright&quot;, I say.
<br />We lie naked in silence,
<br />turned away from each other.
<br />In the corner, a decrepit
<br />old black, brown and orange cat
<br />lying on a deck of empty pizza boxes
<br />watches us, purring,
<br />like one of those cheap handheld
<br />fans that you buy in holiday resorts.

<br />When nature causes sap to rise
<br />Before the dawn in the early hours
<br />When from the shadows she emerged
<br />With an ethereal quality
<br />She moved slowly in the half light
<br />Of the flickering candlelight
<br />Revealing her form in snapshots
<br />Naked but for the flimsiest garbSomething filmy, delicate and sheer,
<br />Which hung from her sylphish form
<br />Like a fine cloak of gossamer
<br />A delicate silken web covered with dew
<br />As she came closer her scent assailed my senses
<br />Initially it cloyed in my throat, sickly sweet
<br />Then intoxicated me like strong wine
<br />Then she stood before me
<br />Wearing the light gauzy fabric
<br />Diaphanous and insubstantial
<br />Which rendered her naked to my eyes
<br />And I gazed into the hypnotic green of hers
<br />The spell was broken by her sweet breath
<br />Which plumed between us in the cold air
<br />In rhythm to the heaving of her chest
<br />Her breasts crowned by her arousal
<br />My eyes moved from the erect sentinels
<br />To the sable triangle below her soft belly
<br />Then returned to be once again entranced
<br />By the sultry green eyes of the seductress
<br />In a silken movement she discarded the flimsy garment
<br />And moved closer, only millimeters away
<br />So close I could feel the beating of her heart
<br />And with every breath she took
<br />Her nipples gently brushed against my skin
<br />Then I felt her hands on my skin
<br />And electricity seemed to move between us
<br />Her touch, soft and delicate on my skin
<br />And as they moved across my body
<br />It felt as though I was being wrapped in silk
<br />Her lips pressed gently against my skin
<br />As she kissed my chest, my neck, my throat
<br />Then up to my cheek and finally my lips
<br />Where she moistly kissed my mouth
<br />Then without warning she became animal and urgent
<br />As she pushed me onto the bed
<br />Her nails dug deep into my flesh
<br />And her mouth pressed hard against mine
<br />Her tongue was darting into my mouth like a piston
<br />Her hands sought me out and found me hardand pulsing
<br />She tugged at my hardness, then enveloped me
<br />Immersing me in her, coating me in warm honey
<br />Her muscles were tight about me
<br />As all at once she was rising and falling on me
<br />Her mouth left mine and her tongue exploredmy ear
<br />And her sharp teeth chewed at my lobe
<br />Deep rasping breaths turned into loud animalmoans
<br />As her exertions became more urgent
<br />Her mouth returned to mine as her passions grew
<br />And when the first orgasm rippled through her
<br />Her kisses turned to bites and she bit my lip
<br />Then she began to lose control and she lost the rhythm
<br />I gripped tight on her hips and imposed my beat
<br />Her moans had turned to wails
<br />And she whipped me with her hair
<br />As she cast her head back and fourth with each stroke
<br />Then that moment arrived
<br />When we both stood upon the edge,
<br />Of that most delicious precipice
<br />Between the bestial coupling, primeval and base
<br />And that joyful release of climax
<br />I exploded inside her with an involuntary grunt
<br />And she let out a banshee wail
<br />All of a sudden I was wide awake
<br />Laying alone, my skin moist with sweat
<br />The bed in total disarray
<br />I was breathing hard and
<br />I imagined I could still smell her scent
<br />And as I moistened my lips
<br />I detected something odd
<br />The metallic taste of blood on my tongue...

<br />I feel my unconscious merge with yours
<br />And I hear a voice say, &quot;What's his is hers&quot;
<br />I'm falling into you
<br />This dream could come true
<br />And it feels so good falling into you

<br />Falling into you
<br />Falling into you
<br />Falling into you

<br />Quite an act to follow
<br />Its gravity defying
<br />even when not trying
<br />Girl I am screaming obscenities
<br />Quietly and in the privacy
<br />of my little black diary
<br />Please, wear a loose dress,
<br />Yes I am obsessing
<br />But it has your blessing
<br />Girl, why ask my opinion,
<br />Is it to have dominion?
<br />Overnight the colour of my hair
<br />is maturing from black to gray
<br />Stress wrinkles are appearing
<br />as I sit reminiscing
<br />Her daring saucy butt
<br />can provoke a heart attack
<br />and with my fragile luck
<br />That’s how I will bow out.

<br />thinking about everything so far,
<br />i am beginning to wonder
<br />if life is supposed to be like this;
<br />high on a pedestal one day,
<br />kissing the dirt the next,
<br />the balance keeps tilting
<br />from the good to the bad;
<br />nobody said life would be easy and simple,
<br />but nobody said life can be so hard,
<br />struggling through a hazy cloud of confusion,
<br />life seems a bitch;
<br />one hand giving things not asked,
<br />while the other not giving things asked,
<br />it’s like taking one step forward,
<br />and two steps backward;
<br />disheartened and feeling the blues,
<br />the road to happiness seems to be enigmatic,
<br />in this crystal maze of life
<br />the game goes on until the end;

<br />It takes but a moment, but the memory of it usually lasts forever.
<br />None are so rich that can get along without it-
<br />And none are so poor but that can be made rich by it.
<br />It enriches those who receive, without making poor those who give-
<br />It creates sunshine in the home,
<br />Fosters good will in business,
<br />And is the best antidote for trouble-
<br />And yet it cannot be begged, borrowed, or stolen, for it is of no value
<br />Unless it is given away.
<br />Some people are too busy to give you a smile-
<br />Give them one of yours-
<br />For the good Lord knows that no one needs a smile so badly
<br />As he or she who has no more smiles left to give.

<br />As others were; I have not seen
<br />As others saw; I could not bring
<br />My passions from a common spring.
<br />From the same source I have not taken
<br />My sorrow; I could not awaken
<br />My heart to joy at the same tone;
<br />And all I loved, I loved alone.
<br />Then- in my childhood, in the dawn
<br />Of a most stormy life- was drawn
<br />From every depth of good and ill
<br />The mystery which binds me still:
<br />From the torrent, or the fountain,
<br />From the red cliff of the mountain,
<br />From the sun that round me rolled
<br />In its autumn tint of gold,
<br />From the lightning in the sky
<br />As it passed me flying by,
<br />From the thunder and the storm,
<br />And the cloud that took the form
<br />(When the rest of Heaven was blue)
<br />Of a demon in my view.
