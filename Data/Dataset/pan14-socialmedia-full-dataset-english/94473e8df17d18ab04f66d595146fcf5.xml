Les has a remarkable collation of 78 rpm vinyls dating back to the 1930s. it is a pleasure to hear those voices from beyond the grave together with Les commentary. <br /><br />The radio license limits severely the geographical cover of the broadcast yet a poll reveals some 2500 faithful listeners enjoy the station. The local area is mostly a farming community in this central northern part of Tasmania. They obviously like to sing along those old hits while riding their harvester all day across the countryside. <br /><br />Fusion is a Christian ministry using the village of Poatina as a reformation centre for people fleeing addictions and abuse. The radio broadcast originally located there has now a studio in downtown Longford - the closest township, to muster local community involvement. <br /><br />Sponsors are a rare breed and are much needed to bring in the cashflow of a volunteer institution. <br /><br />Outside broadcast is a way to be seen and face up to the listeners. Events include the local butcher store grand opening (a station sponsor) and celebrations such as Australia Day or the local agricultural show. These are run along the principle of open crowd festivals innovated by Fusion International. The concept is to organise entertainment and activities to get a local community interacting with each other. Suddenly people encounter their neighbours after dwelling in the area for some time but never getting the chance to participate into anything worthwhile. <br /><br />Somehow in our advanced 21st century society people have to be reminded again how to socialise with each other and be conscious that not everybody is a terrorist or a paedophile. <br /><br />The <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYXJ0Zm0ub3Jn" target="_blank">Tasmanian Midlands Community Radio</a> mandate fits nicely with the Fusion agenda of social welfare. In fact many Poatina inmates serve as volunteers at the radio station and have their own late night program - Captain Midnight. <br /><br />More recently Heart FM indulged in a website to provide Fusion supporters a taste of the programming by providing the download of specific mp3 files.

It is as if time had stopped in the early 1900s and you can drive past miles of pristine farmland or wilderness without any sign of anybody. In other words you can have Tasmania all to your own to rest your soul from whatever was driving you mad. <br /><br />The state is beset with the highest jobless ratio in Australia. It is also the land of an acrimonous dispute between the conservationists and anyone else who dares to makes a living from the land - be it forestry, under ground resources, agriculture and of course fishing... The local government grants a subsidy for the ferry service from the mainland. It is the life line of the island for tourism but also the demise of local manufacturing slaughtered by competitors. <br /><br />The capital Hobart has each weekend a booming open market at Salamanca. Vendors have to reserve a space way in advance and spread from the harbour stretching to the steps of the Parliament House. It's like Tasmanians have turned themselves into homecraft artisans producing all manner of merchandise from wooden products to quilts, jams, and clothing. <br /><br />Launceston and Hobart are unique towns - no gridlock and no high rise buildings. The local councils have a tight grip on what style of architecture is permitted there. To the point - there are hardly any new buildings especially in the central business district. <br /><br />The local radio broadcast is your best connection to the grapevine and an insight to the issues the Tasmanian folks deal with. Farming is a wide sector. Instead of competing with large estates producing wheat, small farmers specialise in niche segments like herbaceous plants or flowers. Plants used for producing drugs are also harvested here. Sadly Tasmania lost its only export shipping line and now the Port of Melbourne slaps a hefty levy on all traffic. <br /><br />If you are touring the state to unwind and take stock on what to do with your life bear in mind that young Tasmanians are moving in the opposite direction to find prosperity in Victoria or New South Wales. As a visitor, be prepared for the unforgiving nature of the weather. Scores of visitors have to be searched for each season from Cradle Mountain or Lake St Clair - heading off with T shirt and light footwear in the sunny morning only to be trapped in a blizzard the very same day. <br /><br />I was staying in <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3BvYXRpbmEuaW5mbw__" target="_blank">Poatina Motel</a> smack bang in the middle of the island. You could drive for two hours and be at any location for a day trip.

To them it was a new method where they could re-use their abilities in image composition. The camera was held on a tripod and the operator could precisely compose and focus the image under a black cloth to cut ambient light. <br /><br />Maybe the lack of colour forces the mind to evaluate the graphic composition of the image. <br /><br />The only place in life where we see in black and white is at dark or in badly lit situations like in a cave. Therefore subconsciously black and white may be related to fear or unease. <br /><br />Black and white gives an image an unusual level of abstraction. Your eye never operates independently of your mind. A smooth shading in the levels of grey is quite suggestive in expressing volume or even temperature. In yesteryears of chemical darkrooms the operator would mask some parts of the image to give more time for some rich graduation to show in the highlighted areas. <br /><br />A black &amp;amp; white portrait always has more stature than the same picture in color. Yet again the portrait of a young person is more attractive in color unless you focus on the plight of the orphan the poor or the sick. A black and white picture of a woman causes you to concentrate on her stare as the makeup has a lesser impact. Looking into someone's eyes is a gateway into looking into their soul. Black and white portraits have this uncanny effect. <br /><br />The loss of colour in a still-life or a landscape has a powerfulappeal. The canopy of trees quickly turns into a silhouette. A grey sky heralds rain or worse a hailstorm even if the picture was captured on a bright sunny day. Still objects contend with one another through forms and degrees of contrast. <br /><br />Photography has the ability to take existence out of time but this is even more so in black and white. It is only recently that newspapers print in color. Photo journalism has come up with a long tradition of celebrities and leaders providing instant recollection of their faces precisely because those portraits are etched in our mind in black and white. <br /><br />See <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3Bob3RvZXhoaWJpdGlvbi5iaXovbmF0dXJlLnNodG1s" target="_blank">Photo Exhibition - nature</a> for some fine illustrations.

But an easy life can also be called by another name: selfishness. <br /><br />Just like you see avid joggers running on a cold windy morning in search of fitness you may wonder if some people actually willingly stretch themselves in the area of finance, education or family. <br /><br />Do you know someone who has been hit by a marriage split-up? Have you opened your home to provide a safe setup for recovery? <br /><br />Do you follow emerging trends in your field of expertise so that you will engage your career where new openings will be? Or do you wait to be made redundant to act about it with the hope of receiving a golden handshake or some government benefit? <br /><br />Is the spare room in your home cluttered  with junk, discarded furniture and miscellaneous obstructions or it is kept in shape so that you can provide for an unforseen visitor? <br /><br />Do you earn simply enough money to support your needs because you do not want to pay too much taxes or do you aim at having enough resources to be empowered to act on the cause you feel strongly about? <br /><br />Do you go out of your way to be reconciled with a disenfranchised family member or do you sing to yourself &quot;que sera, sera&quot;? <br /><br />Have you saved aside some extra cash for a rainy day? Would you be ready to use it as guarantee for a person in need you care about? <br /><br />If you run your own company do you shy away from hiring staff - cruising along nicely just on your own, or do you see your ability to train and provide employment for others? <br /><br />Do you volunteer to teach at the local school or do you spend your spare time following stupid reality shows to ease your boredom? <br /><br />Do you speak to the cash register operator when you do the groceries or do you rush home to connect with social media - folks you can never see face to face? <br /><br />Do you know people next door, do you keep in touch with local events, do you participate in local politics or have you decided to think your vote does not count? <br /><br />The choice is yours: you may decide to venture out of your comfort zone at your own call or at the worst possible time you will be jolted in the deep end because you avoided all the chances beforehand. <br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2JyZWFkLW9mLWxpZmUuYml6" target="_blank">bouncing back in life</a>

You have to wear it! That's how you are being seen in the marketplace. People say &quot;First impressions last&quot; - so ensure the first impression is the best one. <br /><br />In the not so distant past corporate symbols used to be specially designed typefaces often incorporating a graphic element. They were strictly black &amp;amp; white and often used optical illusions where the white space became itself an element of the design because of its surrounding borders. <br /><br />Today with the advent of colour, logos are a de-facto corporate effigy rather than a corporate stamped signature. This is a fashion and I guess you have to tag along with the fashion of the day but ask yourself: Do you really have to use all the shades of the rainbow simply because you have full colour printing? <br /><br />Can your symbol be used for embroidery on garments? How does it show in black and white when transmitted through a fax machine? Does your logo provide the same instant recognition really big as signwriting on a panel van or shrunk down like a postage stamp for a cassette label? <br /><br />You can do some clever animation for the web and for videos on DVD?. With such a broad range of uses the challenge is to keep the same business identity across the board. The worst thing you can do is to use one style one place and another somewhere else. It kills your identity. It gives out a subliminal message that you are unreliable with no well defined corporate goals. Yes some large institutions have renewedtheir logos recently but they managed it all at once and at great expense. <br /><br />Some business owners rely on having a consultation with their employees to pick from a selection of several designs. You will get as many points of view as there are voters. What is important is how the community perceive you out there in the street and how you stand out from your competitors. <br /><br />Here are some good <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2NvcnBvcmF0ZWxvZ28uYml6" target="_blank">defining your image in the marketplace</a> ideas.

How do you remove the cheats and the liars from the rest of the crowd? How do you check if the skills claimed are current or long forgotten? To answer these concerns and more recruiters are now turning to aptitude tests in droves. <br /><br />A jobseeker might look very sharp at the interview but perform badly under stress. There are also times where it is not feasible or convenient to check references. <br /><br />How do you rate qualifications from different institutions locally and abroad? <br /><br />So are knowledge assessments the way to go? It depends. Tests can be used to double check your feelings about an applicant. Ultimately taking up employment has risks for both parties. Avoid using tests to single out on social or cultural background. Senior workers may fail tests that rely overly on memory when in the workplace the required information to execute your task is readily available. A perfect parrot never makes a good team member. An applicant who passes tests with flying colours might in fact be utterly fed-up in the role because there is nothing new to learn... <br /><br />It is a skill to craft a test which specializes in a given topic with different perspectives while avoiding guesswork and double meanings. <br /><br />The Myers-Briggs personality tests are surrounded with argument as people are divided as to what it is they are actually measuring. Only half of people retested within a nine month period will return the same profile! <br /><br />Ultimately if you blindly rely on the results of personality tests during the hiring process it puts your leadership style into question. If you cannot gauge the selection of people who will work under your authority what do they have left to look up to? <br /><br />Knowledge assessments will bring together four classes of people. People who want to practice as they re-enter the job market, candidates sponsored by an employer to undergo a series of tests before being called for an interview, agencies who use online knowledsge tests as a benchmark to screen applicants down to a shortlist and finally experts in a certain field who encapsulate some of their knowledge by writing a test. <br /><br />There is an issue as to if you should allow someone to sit a second time for the same test. To avoid this, some tests providers modify the order of questions at random or select a shorter set of questions from a larger pool. In that situation when we compare the replies of several applicants we are not comparing people who were given exactly the same experience. <br /><br />So at the end of the day <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2FwdGl0dWRlLXRlc3QuaW5mbw__" target="_blank">Aptitude Tests</a> are neither good or bad - it's how you use or abuse that technology that turns them one or the other. In a world where everything depends on Key Performance Indicators and Return On Investment the appeal of knowledge assessments gives you the appearance that you have performed due diligence. What about chatting with somebody over a cup of coffee and taking the time to know that person?

There is no easy way to form your backlinks trove in a hurry. <br /><br />The internet in just ten years has become a very mature marketplace. Gone are the days of the dotcom bust where there was no limit. Now that the dust has settled down we can review the various trends that swept across our commercial horizon and select the good ideas from the bad ones. <br /><br /><strong>Banner Ads</strong> <br />Animated GIFs were the pride of many graphic artists who did a fine job of getting the visitor's attention but the response rate over time fell to dismal levels. Blatant promotion has become a worn out method. People hate to be side tracked in the course of their web surfing. Over time indivuduals have built a blindness to anything that shines and grabs. <br /><br /><strong>Link Directories</strong> <br />Akin to a bookmarking service, web addresses with page after page of links have gone past their use-by date. Search engines no longer report links found there. People prefer to do a search rather than going to a favourite portal and then drill down to their category of interest - only to find poor quality links not really related to their request. <br /><br /><strong>Resources Pages</strong> <br />Scratch my back and I'll scratch yours was the mantra of do-it-yourself webmasters. Since few people write directly in html anymore, there has been a dichotomy between the techies and the promoters and the result was the dominance of search engine advertising. Two way links were also cause for foul play. Someone would put up a link for you and remove it soon after you did your part in good faith. <br /><br /><strong>Leaving a Reply</strong> <br />The boom of blogging sites some years ago witnessed another malpractice: planting stupid URLs on any blog opened for comments you could find. The response was swift. Fast on the back of anti email spam measures people tried to streamline the stamping out of such ill. The no-follow link was born. You could click on it but it wouldn't tally in your website ranking. <br /><br /><strong>Writing Articles</strong> <br />This is the flow of the free economy - bait people with a piece of some value and cause them to return for another piece worth buying. Writing some useful information in order to build your repute as an authoritative source gives you the chance to leave a lead at the end of the article informing people what you do. <br /><br /><strong>Affiliate Programs</strong> <br />Pay per click (PPC) programs are plagued by fraud. Your opponents might click on your ads to eat up your advertising budget. Unscrupulous website operators might get people to click on their ads to bump up their income (thinking another IP address might hide their tracks). Instead of paying people for each click on their link, affiliate marketing schemes pay a commission on each sale generated by that link. A cookie is set on the visitor's browser to track the originating page landing in case the sale is made at a subsequent visit. <br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2FmZmlsaWF0b3JzLmJpeg__" target="_blank">Affiliators</a>

Previously that was never an issue - couples trusted their neighbours or had family who would keep watch for you. Now things are becoming more complex. People are too tired and busy to do that kind of favour. <br /><br />Unveiling the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hvdXNlbWluZGluZy5pbmZv" target="_blank">house minding system</a>. There are out there it appears scores of people, mobile enough to come and live at your home and mind it for you while you are overseas for an extensive period of time. <br /><br />An vacated home is rarely a good idea. You have to look after chickens and cats and dogs. You have to maintain the garden, empty the mail, and take the garbage out on collection day. Lights turned on at night give the warm feeling that indeed somebody resides there. Some have resorted to timed switches to turn lights and radio on and off to give that impression but it fools no one - especially thieves or nosey neighbours. <br /><br />How can you leave your most precious possession - your house - to a complete stranger? Landlords have long known that tenants are a breed apart and have to be kept at a distance via realtors. Are house sitters any better? While you are having fun away, can you hide a video camera in the ceiling and from afar check its image via the net? Will they have mad parties and befriend all the scumbags off the road? <br /><br />Finding the right person will make all the difference. Any contract is based on trust. What could be the reason for a decent individual to come and live and care for your home while you are away? First, they might be touring like you and offer their know-how in exchange for free rent. It could be a retired person who adores gardening but lives in a flat and doesn't have enough space of their own. It could be a school teacher who is free during school breaks. It could be a separated person who needs the tranquillity and peace of a new home to regain composure in their life. It could be an animal enthusiast who breeds dogs and does some networking. <br /><br />In a disconnected world you will see there are many folks who can meet your need while you can also meet their need. The internet is rife with <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hvdXNlbWluZGluZy5pbmZv" target="_blank">opportunities to connect</a> and this is your chance to offer substance and value to a stranger. Who knows - one day it might be you.

The positive side is that it is done with a computer program which is the same for all so that at least we have a level playing field. <br /><br />In order to ascertain what your web page is on about we use the concept of keywords. It is a token encapsulating your field of endeavour. How it appears and how often will be the yardstick to figure out how closely you are really part of that category. <br /><br />The search engine will massage that information to rank your site. You can get a feel of how well you are doing with the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2tpbmdkb21rZXlzLmluZm8_" target="_blank">SEO utility</a> <br /><br /><strong>Off page optimisation</strong> <br /><br />How can a unsighted, ignorant computer discover how legitimate is your call to fame for the keyword mentioned above? Easy - by just corroborating what others are saying about you in cyberspace. Amazing -  because that is one thing I have absolutely no control over. <br /><br />A backlink is any link out there sending people back to you. Just as you send web traffic to other commonly related sites there must be some information about what you do or say together with a link back to your domain. <br /><br />How that happens is the ubiquitous art of web marketing and the search engines use the number and quality of links pointing to you as a popularity contest to differentiate between you and your competitors. <br /><br />It is not only the number of links out there which is being added to calculate your page ranking - it is also the anchor text. This gives the algorithm an idea about the keywords you really belong to against what you say about your activity on your web page. If scores of pages out there fail to confirm your domain with a given keyword then your claim to that keyword on your own site is challenged. <br /><br />Another ingredient is the neighbourhood your backlinks come from. If you are an investment consultant and your backlinks come from sites also loaded with hordes of massage parlours or dieting propositions (in other words totally irrelevant industries) then the weight of those backlinks is discounted since it is plain to see that they did not originate from wholesome promotional activity but from a conspicuous attempt to place (or worse purchase) links in a frenzy.

I beg to differ. Your financial position tells heaps about where you are going. It works likewise for a person or a business. In fact clever, financially minded people consider their estate as a business. <br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3dpc2VhY2NvdW50cy5iaXo_" target="_blank">Wise Accounts</a> has a clever report called &quot;Source and Application of Funds&quot;. It pinpoints from one financial set of accounts to the next where money has been released and where funds have been consumed. <br /><br />The fine balance in your finances between what you owe and what you own may not be changing daily in a striking manner. Looking at it in the right scope though will reveal some changes you need to be atuned to. <br /><br />Financial issues have the trait of catching up on you in discreet ways. If you fail to pick up the trend early enough it can be quite overwhelming to redress the situation afterwards. <br /><br />You assume you are doing nicely on your way to financial independence when without your knowledge a hidden leak is nibbling away at your savings. There are scores of deceitful disguised costs lurking behind varied dealings which over time will rob you of your hard earned cash. Other times you are the culprit by pandering in items you could do without for the lack of discipline. <br /><br />The only way you will get to find out soon enough is by keeping your accounting data up to date. Don't wait for the end of the financial year to figure out if you are in the black or in the red this year &amp;ndash; you need to know that today!

The good news is that if you tame the rebel within you, you will go somewhere. <br /><br />So how do you make it happen? May I suggest you have a good look at this <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2dvYWxzZXR0ZXIuaW5mby9nb2FsX3NldHRpbmdfd29ya3Nob3Auc2h0bWw_" target="_blank">goal setting workshop</a>. It is your life coach internet resource where you can document your projects to be. More precisely it will be your assessment of achievement where you can measure your accomplishment. How you spend your resources speaks a lot about your priorities. Having to keep a record of where you spend each of those precious resources will cause you to face a few things about yourself. <br /><br />Two by-products of this concerted approach is that you will start planning your week ahead and managing your money. Welcome to the real world of achievers! Life is an obstacle course. Don&amp;rsquo;t just start the race &amp;ndash; finish the race! Bad things happen to good people for no fault of their own. Turn your back on the past. Forget bad habits due to your past upsets and take stock of your potential. If you don't begin believing in yourself who will? You hold the formula to your future no matter your condition, your looks, your background, etc&amp;hellip; <br /><br />If life is a challenge then what is worth going after? Unless you are committed on reaching your purpose your energy will disappear at the first setback. Prepare for setbacks &amp;ndash; they are part of living. If you have obstacles it only means one thing: you are alive and it only depends on you to discover paths to get where you ought to be. <br /><br />Learn from pre-schoolers. Nobody said to them; &quot;You can't do that.&quot; They fantasize and role play through games all day long. They express out and speak what is in their mind. <br /><br />Reconnect with the child you once were and realise your dream.

Is it any better than tossing a coin? Contrary to popular belief an algorithmic trading system based only on technical analysis can unearth a reliable number of good trades. <br /><br />Why is it so? First of all let us be specific. Not all stocks that you find to trade are worth putting your money at risk. That's in fact a given because you have a finite amount of money to trade with &amp;ndash; therefore you have to be quite specific about what you pick. Individual stocks especially those with a small capitalization are to be avoided unless you have insider knowledge. Indices and very large stocks are reliable under the spotlight of technical analysis. Even better still commodities are found to be the best. In Spring 2010 a rare metal such as platinum yielded close to 100% returns in just 9 months. Imagine doubling your investment in one year. <br /><br />A trading program doesn&amp;rsquo;t care about a company financial statement (or what is left of it after the spin accountants have done their magic on it.) As the old saying goes: &quot;Everything you need to know is already factored in the price!&quot; An automated trading system doesn't fret about being in or out of the market. It is constantly in the market reversing from long to short and back again. It does not give in to market hysteria but it does take advantage of big moves in the market by being bold enough to change side early in a trend. <br /><br />You might think such <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RyYWRpbmdwYWwubmV0" target="_blank">an algorithmic trading strategy</a> is the prerogative of banks who have at their disposal scores of computer geeks. Have a look at <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RyYWRpbmdwYWwubmV0" target="_blank">this automated trading system with results published daily</a>. It runs on a 9 months rolling window of data. For each item traded a chart and a log of trades with a tally of profits and losses is available. <br /><br />Even though there are many items to choose from speculators tend to trade in an field or market they are familiar with. They mentally recall the last high or the last low over the last 6 months. Regardless comparing your performance with what Trading Pal performed can be quite a wake up call to the shortfalls of your own homegrown method (If you can call it that when what you do is give in to your fears.)
