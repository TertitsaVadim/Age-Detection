It was said that because LEDs can produce a wider spectrum of white light, a more accurate range of color reproduction was possible. However whilst this might be true in the case LED backlit TVs that use arrays of RGB LEDs positioned directly behind the LCD panel, it is not necessarily the case for edge-lit LED lighting which is the method of lighting that the majority of LED TVs on the market employ. This is because the type of LEDs which produce this superior white light and are known as RGB LEDs, are only used in TVs with rear LED array configurations. Edge lit TVs use another type of LEDs called ‘white LEDs’ which do not share the superior qualities of RGB LEDs.<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5sZWRsaWdodHByaWNlLmNvbQ__" target="_blank">LED Strips</a>
<br />Couple this with the fact that CCFL (fluorescent) technology has since improved over the same period and you will find that the performance of CCFL LCD TVs and edge-lit LED TVs is now very similar with regards to color reproduction.<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5sZWRsaWdodHByaWNlLmNvbQ__" target="_blank">LED Strip Lights</a>
<br />Ultra thin design with Clear Motion 960 – Samsung’s highest rating for any of their TVs. Smart TV with Samsung Apps, Web Browser and QWERTY keyboard / remote. Massive discounts available if you know where to buy it!
<br /><br />As already mentioned there are other factors which also come in to consideration. One is that active 3D TVs benefit from the superior brightness and contrast of LED vs. LCD TV. This is because 3D TVs which use active shutter 3D TV glasses have the effect of dimming the display due to the filtering effect of the shutters built in to the glasses. The improved brightness of LED TV can compensate for this reduction of brightness in 3DTVs.
<br /><br />Other features such as auto brightness sensors and micro-dimming also affect the perceived brightness and contrast levels. When the room in which a TV with an auto-brightness sensor is located in is darkly lit, the TV reduces the brightness of the display. This improves the viewing experience and reduces power consumption. But whilst LED TVs characteristically have higher levels of brightness it is not necessarily always an advantage as fine detail can be lost when the brightness levels are too high – hence this why features such as auto-brightness and micro-dimming exist.
<br /><br />The fact of the matter is this, other features influence the quality of the picture produced more than LED lighting alone. A good LCD TV can produce better results in terms of picture quality than a bad LED TV and vice versa.
<br /><br />Energy Efficiency – LEDs are frequently touted are the eco-friendly TV. It is true that LED TVs use less power than both LCD and plasmas. If you believe the figures then LED TVs can use up to 40% less power than standard LCD TVs. I’m sure that if someone where to actually take the time to compare the power ratings for all LCD TV vs. LED TV currently on the market then the figure would not be anywhere near 40%.
<br /><br />Anyway, from a little research, what I can say is that owning a 60 inch LED TV will save the average owner approximately $50 per year in electricity costs compared to owning the equivalent 60 inch LCD TV. It might not be a large amount, but over the average LED TV lifespan it would approximately equal the extra cost for purchasing the LED versus LCD, meaning that the TV basically paying for itself.
<br /><br />Improved Reliability – There is no disputing that LED TVs have a longer life than CCFL LCD TVs, on average an LED TV will last about 30-50% than an LCD TV. This is because LEDs are more reliable than the fluorescent lamps in conventional LCD TVs. Depending on usage an LED should have a life of 10 years or more. Also the performance of fluorescent lamps degrades over time, the brightness and the whiteness of the light can be reduced by a considerable amount, a problem which is not present with LED lighting.

However there is no definitive answer as to which is type of TV is the best, like most choices your personal requirements will depend whether to opt for LED vs. LCD.<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5sZWRsaWdodHByaWNlLmNvbQ__" target="_blank">LED Strips</a>
<br />The whole debate is somewhat confusing because of the fact that an LED TV is still technically speaking an LCD TV – all be it one that uses LED lighting to illuminate the LCD panel rather than CCFL (fluorescent lamps). Consumers who think that LED TVs are a radically different are misguided, although it is understandable why some people might have this misconception because some advertisers have portrayed LED TV technology in such a way which leaves consumers confused about its significance.<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5sZWRsaWdodHByaWNlLmNvbQ__" target="_blank">LED Strip Lights</a>However most consumers now appreciate that LED televisions are actually just LCD TVs that use LED backlighting rather than CCFL, and so now the term LED TV has simply become a convenient phrase use to distinguish them from conventional LCD TVs that use CCFLs. There are however some real and practical pros and cons between LCD vs. LED, and this is the issue that consumers are trying to get to the bottom of when deciding between LED TV vs. LCD TV.
<br /><br />In order to make a choice between the two variations of TV technology you need to understand these pros and cons and then prioritize the importance of each before making your decision.

General lighting should be sufficient to ensure that when choosing merchandise and making purchases, the visitor will not feel discomfort. This is a top priority for most stores. At too low-light vision buyer will be constantly tense, why you may receive a feeling of discomfort. Today, as the average level of illumination, experts recommend choosing 1,500 at 1 m from the floor. Thus it is desirable to monitor the uniformity of illumination; in sight of a man should not be large differences of brightness and shade.<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5sZWRsaWdodHByaWNlLmNvbQ__" target="_blank">LED Strips</a>
<br />It must take into account the qualitative characteristics of light - its color and hue. Color rendition - the ability to properly transmit light color - if possible should be high (greater than 90). Particularly stringent requirements for this parameter must be presented in the stores that sell goods, color nuances which are of fundamental importance: it is cosmetics, textiles, etc.<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5sZWRsaWdodHByaWNlLmNvbQ__" target="_blank">LED Strip Lights</a>
<br />Using this source of low color may reduce the popularity of Buyers: daylight color product will differ from that which has been selected, and the person may be disappointed. It is important to follow and a color temperature of light determines its color.
<br /><br />Hue of light can influence the perception of the goods. The warm yellowish light (color temperature below 3200 K) relaxes, creates a tranquil atmosphere and cool light (more than 3500 K) has a stimulating effect. Lighting warm tones will find application in clothing stores, in grocery stores (such as in bread section). Cold light can illuminate the goods, which have elements of metal or glass.

It is estimated that during the day office worker 10 000 times looks from the document at the keyboard or computer screen. However, the design office is not always first consider the location of fixtures, which can lead to the fact that employees will feel discomfort from lack of light, color distortion, flickering lamps, and high temperatures generated by lighting equipment. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5sZWRsaWdodHByaWNlLmNvbQ__" target="_blank">LED Strips</a>
<br />Every other office staff sooner or later becomes the owner of the so-called &quot;eye syndrome, which arises because of constant fatigue. Quality office lighting should be closer to the performance of daylight. It is recommended to cover office fluorescent or energy saving lamps white shade. Yellowish tint of energy saving lamps and incandescent lamps promotes relaxation and can be used when covering recreation areas. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5sZWRsaWdodHByaWNlLmNvbQ__" target="_blank">LED Strip Lights</a>
<br />According to the International Commission on Illumination, thanks to improved room lighting can increase employee productivity by 3-11%. But this should be done properly to not get the opposite effect. How to achieve the same result? First of all, the lighting should be emphasized functional. In this light should organically fit into the surroundings, matching style of interior design in general, 
<br />The main objective of the lighting system - is to create ideal conditions for vision, in which most effectively can be performed a variety of processes. Office lighting should provide an easy and accurate detection of the smallest detail, whether on paper or on screen.
<br /><br />It is difficult to imagine a modern office without a computer. However, the monitor is very vulnerable to the glare. Glare can be caused by bright lighting elements, strongly illuminated surface or ill-placed windows. The only light that does not gives glare - fluorescent. That is why they are used to illuminate the screen with a deficiency of another world. With regard to lighting of industrial premises, with a lack of natural light and the combined use of artificial lighting, in which the lack of standards of natural illumination supplemented artificially.

Shadows should be mitigated by applying, for example, lamps with light-diffusing opal glass, and under natural light using shading devices (blinds, shutters, canopies, etc.). <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5sZWRsaWdodHByaWNlLmNvbQ__" target="_blank">LED Strips</a>
<br />On a design artificial lighting can be of two types - general and combined. System is used for general lighting in rooms where the entire area of the same type of work performed (casting, welding, electroplating circuit), as well as in administrative, clerical and warehouse facilities. Here distinguish the general uniform illumination (the light is distributed evenly throughout the floor area) and localized general lighting (including the location of jobs). <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5sZWRsaWdodHByaWNlLmNvbQ__" target="_blank">LED Strip Lights</a>
<br />When performing precision visual works (jewelry, metalwork, turning, controlling) in places where the equipment creates deep, sharp shadows or work surfaces are arranged vertically (punches, guillotines), along with the general use local lighting. 
<br /><br />Fluctuations of light in the workplace, resulting, for example, a sharp change in voltage, determine peread aptatsiyu eyes, leading to significant fatigue. The constancy of light in time stabilization is achieved by a floating voltage, rigid mounting fixtures, the use of special schemes include HID lamps. 
<br /><br />But the variety of industrial lighting fixtures is not limited to the interior. This also includes street lights. 
<br /><br />Germicidal lamps are used for air disinfection, drinking water, household items, food, blood transfusion stations, children and school facilities and production facilities of industrial enterprises. Signal lights to indicate output, safe evacuation routes, fixing the boundaries of hazard zones as conditionally assign to the industry.

Lamps of the new millennium do not have to compete with other light sources. But this does not mean that manufacturers are in place. The emergence of the new types and kinds of lamps is not a whim of designers and manufacturers. Their imagination is fueled by consumer demands. Light sources are needed for different types of lighting, different premises, different, often unusual forms of lamps. Since the lamps of bygone days did not differ diversity in them, regardless of destination, used mostly traditional incandescent bulbs. Once it had convenient for everybody.<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5sZWRsaWdodHByaWNlLmNvbQ__" target="_blank">LED Strips</a>  
<br /><br />Now the market situation has changed radically. In a flat or intricately curved lampshade our good old incandescent bulb simply will not fit. In a luxurious crystal chandelier, it will look like something out of place, though so much time and effort was spent in selecting a suitable lamp, which, according to your plan, among other things also have to decorate the interior. What to do? <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5sZWRsaWdodHByaWNlLmNvbQ__" target="_blank">LED Strip Lights</a>
<br /><br />Diversity and high consumer quality light bulbs that now we can buy in the shops, just imagination! First of all, no one is going to abandon the traditional incandescent bulbs. Yes, they have disadvantages, and significant. Firstly, they are uneconomical, since a significant portion of energy transferred into heat: the production of light takes only 5-10% of energy consumption - then the premise basically is not covered and heated. Secondly, they quickly burn out. But at the same time, their pleasant soft light is able to create a homelike atmosphere, making our holiday after a busy day of calm and complete.

This stand consists of a ring and two or three feet. The ring, which will keep the lamp, should be made of heat resistant material, as when using Halogen lamps, it can experience significant temperature changes that can deform the ring. It should be remembered that use halogen or incandescent lamps of high power in the spotlights in ceilings is not worth it. Power halogen bulbs in the lamp should not exceed 35 Tues to protect the film from the burning ceiling used one or several insulating rings. The rings are made of heat resistant plastic master directly under the concrete lamp with all its features.

Using krypton lamp brightness increases by 10% compared with the conventional and silicified interior surface of the bulb gives a soft, no glare. Improved lamp can endure the shocks and tremors due to the additional holders of the helix. In the fight for consumer boldly entered fluorescent and halogen lamps, the advantage of these lamps is that for the same power consumption, they provide two to three times more light and serve three to four times longer. When electricity prices are increasing, only one solution - to reduce costs, this will help to halogen lamps, which can save up to 80% of electricity and will be an important source of savings. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5sZWRsaWdodHByaWNlLmNvbQ__" target="_blank">LED Strips</a>
<br />In addition, they have more natural color reproduction, and small size, a real godsend to designers: do not need wires with large cross section and large chucks. Fluorescent lamps can produce light, the spectrum of such a daycare. Until recently in Russia, such lamps in the home were used rarely. This was due to the peculiarities of our economic situation. Then the electricity was relatively cheap, and lamps, whose production is based on high technologies, pricey.

In the following text I'll talk  about this aspect. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.laptopaccessories.asia%2F%26quot%3B%26gt%3BLaptop"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.laptopaccessories.asia/&quot;&gt;Laptop</a>  Accessories&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
<br />&lt;p&gt;A. Misunderstanding one: There is no need to charge the battery before  it is running out.&lt;br /&gt;
<br />  Notebook  batteries are now lithium batteries. Lithium batteries, run out of battery  again for a long time filled with do not have any role, or even harmful.  Because lithium does not exist in the so-called &amp;quot;cache effect&amp;quot;, only  the early nickel batteries have this feature. Laptop battery life in general  with the man-made damage, or natural life. Basically, the battery life are  fixed 300-600 charge and discharge times, generally available 2 years.&lt;br /&gt;
<br />  B.  Misunderstanding two: when the power is connected, the battery can pull or not  pull&lt;br /&gt;
<br />  &lt;br /&gt;
<br />  Pull or not pull depends on the actual usage: Connect the DC power at the same  time do not disconnect the battery and the battery does no harm, because the  battery is fully charged, will not accept any electricity into the power will  be directly to the laptop power supply supply system. But when the laptop  high-speed operation, the internal overheating is best to remove the battery,  otherwise it is harmful.&lt;br /&gt;
<br />  C. How to  charge the laptop battery properly.&lt;br /&gt;
<br />  We should  avoid the battery is run out of recharge, because this will give the battery a  lot of pressure which will resulting in damage. A more feasible approach is to  charge about 20-30% of power remaining. In fact the notebook lithium battery in  the number of &amp;quot;light / charge&amp;quot; is limited, all used to recharge will  significantly shorten the battery's life. At the same time, the battery should  be charged in a dry place, The heat problem, which also is the enemy of the  battery.&lt;br /&gt;
<br />  Tip:  useing of mobile phone battery is different from that of laptop battery, many  people may experience in the use of mobile phone battery to determine that the  laptop battery should be all used up recharge, this idea is not true.&lt;br /&gt;
<br />  D. How to protect the battery  which is not in use for a long time &lt;/p&gt;
<br />&lt;h1&gt;What should we do in protecting a  laptop battery, put photoelectric or  otherwise.  &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.laptopaccessories.asia%2F%26quot%3B%26gt%3Blaptop"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.laptopaccessories.asia/&quot;&gt;laptop</a>  parts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
<br />&lt;p&gt;Put the  photoelectric long-term preservation, the batteries will lose activity, and  even lead to the control circuit protection self-locking and can no longer use  fully charged, long-term preservation will bring safety risks, the best way to  save is the will power to about 40% and then stored in a cool, dry place, about  20 degrees Celsius is the ideal storage temperature. Of course, the best month  to take the battery out with time, can guarantee the battery good state of  preservation, but not so the battery is completely lost and damage the battery and  even lead to the control circuit protection self-locking and can no longer use  fully charged, long-term preservation will bring security risks, the best way  to save is the will power to about 40% and then stored in a cool, dry place,  about 20 degrees Celsius is the ideal storage temperature. Of course, the best  way to protect the battery is to take the battery out at least one month a  year, which can guarantee the battery's good state of preservation, and protecting  it from damage by completely lost.&lt;br /&gt;
<br />  E.  Several measures on extending laptop battery's working hours&lt;/p&gt;
<br />&lt;h1&gt;1&amp;gt; to  reduce the brightness of the screen: you can use the fn + down / up key  combination to quickly adjust brightness (specific the fn + which keys need to  see their own laptop).2&amp;gt; use of standby, sleep and other functions: when a  long time without a computer, notebook standby or hibernate, saving power and  extending the life of the computer.3&amp;gt; Open the cpu Speedstep function, can  greatly extend the battery working time: cpu speedstep function is the default  in the bios to start when using the battery, cpu will automatically drop the  frequency to use to save energy. If not open, you can boot into the BIOS, press  F2 to find the Performance settings Speedstep the Enable to Enabled.4&amp;gt; when  using the battery, try to turn off the wireless, Bluetooth and infrared port.  Removed without the use of peripherals and avoid enable large 3D applications,  games, etc., to reduce unnecessary battery consumption. &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.laptopaccessories.asia%2F%26quot%3B%26gt%3Bwww.laptopaccessories.asia%26lt%3B%2Fa%26gt%3B%26lt%3B%2Fh1%26gt"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.laptopaccessories.asia/&quot;&gt;www.laptopaccessories.asia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt</a>;

		<document id="f449562b1d7f3bb3d02e26f49a73e5d7" url=""><![CDATA[The differences between the original notebook power adapter<br/><br/>Comparison  of the original power supply and the so-called OEM power on the market : &lt;br /&gt;
<br />  The  differences:&lt;br /&gt;
<br />  1: The price  difference:The price of OEM Power Supply is cheap; while the  original power supply is expensive. Let's  take the 65W power supply as an example: A OEM power supply is about 20 yuan or  so, while the original power supply is about 60 yuan.  &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.laptopaccessories.asia%2F%26quot%3B%26gt%3BLaptop"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.laptopaccessories.asia/&quot;&gt;Laptop</a> Accessories&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
<br />  2: Power: On the  market, the proportion of good OEM power dissipation is  about 30% (the difference between the  proportion is even higher); the original manufacturer's power ratio is less  than 10%. Take the ordinary 65W power supply for example: the OEM power supply  with a hour power loss is more than 22W, the original manufacturer power supply  to an hour of loss is less than 7W. Calculated in accordance with 10 hours a  day, the OEM power electricity losses more than the original power supply 150W.  It means that in 10 days OEM power l power losses 1.5 kWh more than the  original one. And It will be 4.5 kWh more in a month. Nowadays the electricity  in public electricity is 0.65 yuan / kWh. The use of OEM power will take you  3yuan RMB more than an original one. And that also means 36yuan RMB a year.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.laptopaccessories.asia%2F%26quot%3B%26gt%3Blaptop"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.laptopaccessories.asia/&quot;&gt;laptop</a> parts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
<br />  3: Life  is different: Usually the domestic manufacturers OEM power's life is about(the  bad ones may be sent to repair in 3 months), while the original power's useful  life is more than 5 years.&lt;br /&gt;
<br />  4: EMI  (European power electron beam radiation safety indicators) indicators of  differences: Usually the domestic OEM power supply is never has the EMI  radiation safety indicators insecurity. It has the to our bodies, while the  original manufacturer of power all through the Europeansafety testing  standards, EMI is complianced. It's radiation to our bodies is within the  safety standards!&lt;br /&gt;
<br />  5:  Safety certification is completely different: the original power's LABEL  (label) which means the product is in full compliance with the safety standard  certification in many countries around the world and is fully achieved in many  countries of the world imports of product safety certification licensee is not  casually pasted everywhere. It is a sign of a quality and safety! Domestic OEM  power supply usually easily find a printing factory which may not have taken  any certification standards to print label and stik it up. Theproduct's safety  and quality without any effective supervision and protection, and problems need  to produce manufacturers bear the joint responsibility!&lt;br /&gt;
<br />  6: the  size of the manufacturer: the original power production enterprises to large  manufacturing plants, well-known enterprises around the world; lines and  first-class production equipment, while the domestic OEM power production  plants are all small underground factory.&lt;/p&gt;
<br />&lt;h1&gt;Similarities:&lt;br /&gt;
<br />  1: Overall:  Domestic OEM power supply and the original power supply look almost the same;  if not, it cannot deceive the customers;&lt;br /&gt;
