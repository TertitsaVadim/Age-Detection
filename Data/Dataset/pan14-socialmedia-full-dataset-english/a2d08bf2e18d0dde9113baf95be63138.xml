Doctors couldn't come up with the cause of his death. His mother checked his emails to see if she could figure out what happened. Turns out he was still signed into myspace. She found he had gone to sleep after he read and didnt repost a chain letter about a little girl that kills you in your sleep with no natural cause of death.
<br /><br />This is the bulletin he read:
<br /><br />My name is Jaime Heras. I'm 14 years old. I'm a murderer. I have no face. When you look at me you'll die immediately.You have 900 seconds to repost this or I will visit you tonight.
<br /><br />Repost this &quot;Guy died having SEX&quot;
