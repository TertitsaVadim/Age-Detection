ASUS Transformer<br/><br/>With the keyboard dock, you add 8 hours of battery life, an Android optimized keyboard with trackpad, two USB ports, an Facts slot, as well as, a chance to “close” it into an easily carried Android netbook. But these traits feature a unit price: $150 to become exact. That’s not to imply that the Acer’s screen is bad, it’s actually very, excellent which has a 160 degree viewing angle. It’s only inside a next to each other comparison that you simply see the differences, and even then, they aren’t glaring.<br /><br />Overall performance:<br /><br />This might virtually certainly be a tie due to similar hardware specifications, nonetheless it entirely possible that Asus has handled things in a very slightly different manner, probably inside their customization of Honeycomb 3.0. Of all tablets tested, the Asus’ Camera functions would be the only ones that exhibit issues, a lot of them quite bad, like choppy recording and blurry screen when moving the internet tablet about, so that it is tough to see what you’re filming. There’s and a much bigger bugs that result in forced closes and lockups. One app that we test on all PC tablets is FPSe, the Playstation 1 emulator, because it really stresses all aspects of an system. While the Acer, much like the Xoom and G-Slate, runs FPSe okay, it simply won't are powered by the Asus tablet pc (UPDATE: Today’s FPSe update solved the matter using the Asus tablet pc, also it now runs fine). Even Polaris Office, included around the Asus, has some conditions lead it to crash unexpectedly. I suspect that you have other programs which won’t run properly around the Asus that will work okay on other Honeycomb tablets. Hopefully, when Asus is aware it’s update issues (units being bricked), consequent firmware and software updates will solve these issues and bring stability for the Transformer.<br /><br />The Acer, conversely, did flawlessly with just one forced close after i had about 10 tabs open inside the browser. In addition to that, it’s been stable as a rock and everything I’ve tried onto it works all right, including Asus’ own  My Water Live Wallpaper and My Weather Widget.<br /><br />Additional items:<br /><br />The two Acer and Asus offer their particular version of cloud networking and sharing, however the Asus’ version generally seems to be more effective overall so far as convenience and operation. The Acer carries a handful of nifty features such as Haptic feedback and little extras like a song recognition app and a non-standard multimedia player, while the Asus provides the Polaris Office Suite and Remote Desktop app that can develop both Macs and PCs.<br /><br />Unit price Difference:<br /><br />Here i am speaking about the gap of approximately $50, with the ASUS Transformer set to be released for your unit price of $399.99, even though the Acer Iconia A500 has been released at $449.99. We know today, every bit counts.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br /><br />It’s no secret we’re big fans with the ASUS Transformer. With it’s innovative form factor, great life of the battery, 2 SD Card slots, excellent IPS screen, and Keyboard dock, we’re likely to provide it with a huge thumbs up!<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theandroidtablets.net%2Fasus-eee-pad-transformer-vs-acer-iconia-a500-comparison-1067%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.theandroidtablets.net/asus-eee-pad-transformer-vs-acer-iconia-a500-comparison-1067/</a>
