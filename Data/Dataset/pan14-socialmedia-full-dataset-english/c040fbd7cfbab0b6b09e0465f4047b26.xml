<br /><br />If you watch the animated hijinks on TV's Family Guy, The Cleveland Show and American Dad, you know that Seth MacFarlane, the brainy, bawdy creator of those kickass shows, does not cater to audiences who call him juvenile, stupid, vulgar and foul-mouthed. So stop reading, MacFarlane haters. Ted is not for you. MacFarlane's debut as a feature director hits all the sweet spots that irritate prudes. Is it dirty? Yes. Does it take full advantage of the R rating? Oh my yes. Is it funny? It's hysterically, gut-bustingly funny. Mark Wahlberg is just terrific as John Bennett, a good-natured Boston dude who wonders if he'll ever be responsible enough to marry his girlfriend Lori (a gorgeously feisty Mila Kunis). Finding the right job isn't the problem. The problem is Ted, a toy bear John has been living with since childhood. Back then, he wished for a walking, talking bear who'd love him as a friend and comfort him when thunder comes. Wham! John's wish comes true. Ted pops into life, scaring John's parents and becoming a media celebrity.
<br /><br />Ted goes on The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson. He smokes pot. He picks up hookers. The fickle public grows tired of him. But not John. John stays Ted's friend. They're &quot;thunder buddies,&quot; crawling into bed at the mere sound of a rumble from the sky. What worked for John as a kid doesn't cut it with Lori. She wants John to herself. That's the plot MacFarlane cooked up with Family Guy collaborators Alec Sulkin and Wellesley Wild. Best of all, MacFarlane does Ted's voice in a way that sounds even more Boston than Wahlberg's. Using the latest in motion-capture techniques, MacFarlane even does Ted's moves. And boy can Ted move. Wahlberg played their scenes together basically staring at a stick, with the computer adding Ted later. But it works. The scene in which John tries to guess the name of the white-trash girl Ted wants to marry is time-capsule worthy. As is the &quot;Thunder Buddies&quot; song (&quot;Fuck you thunder/you can suck my dick&quot<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/wink.gif" alt=":)" />. You get the point.

<br /><br />No onDownload Take This Waltze would ever mistake Sarah Polley’s Take This Waltz for a generic rom-com. It’s too packed with highly specific, often flagrantly odd details, from the way married couple Michelle Williams and Seth Rogen playfully pillow-talk in goofy voices into each other’s eyeballs to the scene where Williams cracks up during a water-aerobics class with Rogen’s sister (Sarah Silverman), and eventually gets publicly shamed for her lack of bladder control. The form of the movie is familiar—person in stable-but-stagnant relationship meets someone new and begins to question everything—but actor-turned-writer/director Polley (following up her remarkable 2006 directorial debut, Away From Her) both injects new life into the formula and loses her way somewhat by adding thick levels of idiosyncrasy. Take This Waltz is simultaneously a coming-of-age film, a love story, a breakup story, and an indie quirkfest, and it tries to do so many things at once that it can’t hit many of its marks cleanly. But at least it’s never boring, and rarely predictable.
<br /><br />Williams stars as a freelance writer comfortably married to Rogen, a cookbook author who spends most of his time experimenting with chicken recipes. Their partnership is close and familiar, characterized by baby talk, wrestling, and the kind of private verbal games that spring up between couples, like their discomfiting habit of describing creative ways they’d like to mutilate each other. But their toxic cuteness curdles when Williams meets neighbor Luke Kirby, a quieter, more intense man whose habit of undermining her and putting her down somehow draws her. There’s nothing particularly dark or domineering about Kirby, who banters along with her, but he’s franker and more aggressive than Rogen, and his conversation comes without a sense of childish play, and with distinct sexual undertones. (Or overtones, during a sedately erotic scene where he builds a sexual fantasy between the two of them over drinks.) In some ways, he’s a Mild Pixie Dream Guy, full of his own twee idiosyncrasies—he’s a rickshaw-puller by day and an artist in secret—and newly arrived in the world, free of backstory or friends of his own, ready to pull Williams from her stasis.

<br /><br />Sam Harper is a fast-talking New York salesman with money and soul problems, and the way Chris Pine plays him in “People Like Us,” you either want to hit Sam or help him out. Which means the film is doing something half-right.
<br /><br />A standard movie type — think Jack Lemmon in “The Apartment,” Tom Hanks in “Nothing in Common,” Hugh Grant in “About a Boy” or Tom Cruise in “Rain Man” and “Jerry Maguire” — Sam is into avoidance. When he gets news that his father, a once-famous music producer, has died, Sam does all he can so he and his girlfriend (Olivia Wilde) can skip the funeral. But once he’s in L.A. to deal with his bitter mom (Michelle Pfeiffer), Sam is handed a bag of cash his dad left for him. It’d be a life-saver if he didn’t have to deliver it to a mystery woman and her 11-year-old son.
<br /><br />That the woman, Frankie (Elizabeth Banks), is messed up too is no surprise in a dramedy like this. Nor is the bond that develops between Frankie’s son (a good Michael Hall D’Addario) and Sam over music and guy stuff. What’s unexpected is how long the movie draws out its twist — Frankie is Sam’s half-sister, also ignored by their free-livin’ dad — without being as bad as it could have been.
<br /><br />You can see Sam’s brand of gotta-prove-myself drive in director Alex Kurtzman, who co-wrote the movie with Roberto Orci. The pair penned some of the last decade’s biggest action blockbusters, including two “Transformers” flicks and 2009’s great “Star Trek” reboot. Kurtzman, it seems, is also seeking to prove he can be a person like us.
<br /><br />While such desperate strivings work against the movie, eventually it wins us over, if the music of second chances appeals to you.
<br /><br />Pine (aka the new Capt. Kirk) is the right front man. Sam has to appear to be a good-looking shell who’ll shill for anything except authenticity, and Pine has that earnest slickness down. It’s an effective performance; if you don’t buy him, you’ll tune out the heart “People Like Us” really wants us to know it has. Banks, an appealingly vinegary actress who hasn’t caught fire in movies, is also good, though Frankie’s working-class life requires more “acting.”

<br /><br />The result is a film that stands up against its predecessors, is an improvement on Spider-Man 3 and has the added bonus of 3D technology to make the action that much more exhilarating. The Amazing Spider-Man returns to the beginning of Peter Parker’s story and his transformation into Spider-Man, but it’s not a prequel, as a lot of this material has been covered before, nor is it hugely different from Raimi’s vision.
<br /><br />Rather it’s a fresh take on events with subtle differences; for example Webb introduces us to Peter’s parents in flashbacks for the first time, and his love interest isn’t girl next door Mary Jane, but fellow student Gwen Stacy (Stone) who featured in Spider-Man 3.
<br /><br />A high school student, Peter becomes interested in the mysterious death of his parents in a plane crash and his father’s secretive scientific work. His curiosity leads him to the Oscorp research laboratories where his father worked alongside Dr Curt Connors (Ifans), and fellow student Gwen Stacy is an intern. It’s there Peter has an encounter with a spider giving him his arachnid-like superpowers which he uses, initially, to find the murderer of his Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen).
<br /><br />It’s also at Oscorp that Dr Connors conducts cross-species genetic tests on himself, accidentally becoming Spider-Man’s first supervillain, The Lizard.
<br /><br />Andrew Garfield steps into the spandex suit with ease. His Peter is studious and slightly socially awkward, but rather than being a nerd, he’s just a good guy with a skateboard and a camera who likes to keep to himself. It’s great fun watching him discover his Spider-Man powers and laughing at the cheeky confidence they give him, and Garfield has a genuine rapport with his fellow cast mates Sally Field as Aunt May and Sheen. He also has plenty of on-screen chemistry with his off-screen girlfriend Emma Stone.

<br /><br />With just the charming indie rom-com 500 Days of Summer to his name, Webb is relatively inexperienced to take on a big budget 3D special effects blockbuster and yet his handling of the action is a revelation. Spider-Man’s aerial work is heady stuff as we literally swing and swirl alongside him through the streets of NYC – if you’re in Auckland its worth seeing this film in the Imax theatre, although unfortunately the CGI Lizard doesn’t appear quite so seamless on this big screen.
<br /><br />Plenty of what you’ll see in The Amazing Spider-Man will be familiar and as you’d expect from a superhero comic book adaptation, a little cheesy at times. However Webb has successfully added some depth and darkness to Peter Parker’s back-story, presented us with characters who are easy to invest in emotionally and thrilled us with impressive highflying action.
<br /><br />Regardless of what you want to call this film, as far as new beginnings go – and this is clearly the beginning of another series – it’s a pretty good start.

<br /><br />Laguna Beach entrepreneurs Ben (Johnson), a peaceful and charitable Buddhist, and his closest friend Chon (Kitsch), a former Navy SEAL and ex-mercenary, run a lucrative, homegrown industry—raising some of the best marijuana ever developed. They also share a one-of-a-kind love with the extraordinary beauty Ophelia (Lively). Life is idyllic in their Southern California town...until the Mexican Baja Cartel decides to move in and demands that the trio partners with them.

<br /><br />Release date: 20 July 2012 Certificate: 15 Director: Christopher Nolan Starring: Christian Bale, Anne Hathaway, Tom Hardy, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Marion Cotillard What's the story? When dangerous masked rebel Bane (Hardy) puts Gotham under threat, the reclusive Batman/Bruce Wayne (Bale) comes out of hiding. Meanwhile a mysterious cat burglar (Hathaway) and a beautiful business associate (Cotillard) come into his life. What did we think? Epic from the get-go, the final part of Nolan's Batman trilogy may just be his best, combining spectacular action set pieces with thrilling plot developments and thorough characterisation - something blockbusters so often lack. The story's more complex than it may sound, going back into the pasts of various key characters and examining Batman's own personal demons as only Nolan can.Aside from a few choice one-liners, Nolan definitely has his trademark long face on. While The Dark Knight Rises is very entertaining, this is no escapist comic book romp, taking a fairly serious look at life choices and mortality through its tragic hero who's driven on by anger and heartbreak. Bale remains the perfect choice for this tortured soul, looking more world-weary than ever out of his empowering costume and only smiling in a approximately one scene (well, Cotillard would do that to anyone). Lightening the tone a touch is Anne Hathaway as Selina Kyle, not once referred to as Catwoman but clearly a feline figure complete with skin-tight catsuit and makeshift ears (sometimes goggles, other times a decorative hair piece). Suitably slinky, she drops her voice an octave when the bad kitty kicks in and the film's all the more fun for it - you miss her when she's not onscreen. Still, there are many interesting characters who deserve space, not least policeman Blake (Gordon-Levitt), who finds common ground with Bruce Wayne and becomes increasingly key to the plot. Gordon-Levitt is perfectly understated as the principled everyman who rises to the occasion without fuss or showmanship. If Nolan's Inception pushed Gordon-Levitt towards the leading-man A-list, this could be the final nudge he needs. Cotillard, meanwhile, is a charismatic presence, if also a little sidelined by the male characters. Tom Hardy looks suitably buff and menacing in his creepy mask, even if his voice sounds like Brian Blessed wearing Darth Vader's headpiece. Meanwhile the seasoned supporting cast are solid as ever - Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine among them. The movie also looks and sounds terrific, with a dramatic score from Hans Zimmer and spectacular effects (the Batmobile gets ever-interesting). There are other, ballsy elements of The Dark Knight Rises that are even more worthy of a mention - but you're just going to have to discover those for yourself.

With epic proportions of Shakespearean tragedy, the film follows two unique characters, whose rags-to-riches success stories reveal the innate virtues and flaws of the American Dream. The film begins with the family triumphantly constructing the biggest house in America, a 90,000 sq. ft. palace. Over the next two years, their sprawling empire, fueled by the real estate bubble and cheap money, falters due to the economic crisis. Major changes in lifestyle and character ensue within the cross-cultural household of family members and domestic staff.

<br /><br />Starring: Astrid Berges-Frisbey, Daniel Auteuil, Jean-Pierre Darroussin, Nicolas Duvauchelle, Sabine Azéma Summary: Eponymous well-digger, Pascale, is a widower living with his six daughters in the Provence countryside at the start of World War I. His eldest, Patricia, has returned home from Paris to help raise her sisters, and Pascale dreams of marrying her off to his loyal assistant Felipe. But when she's impregnated by a wealthy young pilot who promptly abandons her for the frontlines, Pascale is left to contend with the consequences. (Kino Lorber) French A-lister Daniel Auteuil plays it safe with his directorial debut, a polished if predictable remake of Marcel Pagnol’s 1940 melodrama. It’s a tale of love across the class divide, as 18-year-old Patricia (Pirates 4’s Astrid Bergès-Frisbey), the daughter of Provencal well-digger Pascal (Auteuil himself), falls pregnant to a dashing pilot (Nicolas Duvauchelle) on the eve of WW2. To paraphrase Casablanca, the problems of these characters don’t amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world, but those looking to lose themselves in bucolic beauty won’t be disappointed.

<br /><br />Plot Summary: &quot;The Watch&quot; is a sci-fi comedy about a suburban &quot;neighborhood watch&quot; group that serves as a front for dads to get some male-bonding time away from their families. The group finds itself in over its head when it uncovers a plot to destroy the world. Parents need to know that The Watch is a raunchy summer comedy that ends up veering into sci-fi territory. A group of neighborhood dads forms a watch unit that becomes a much bigger responsibility than any of them initially expected when they must defend the world against alien attackers. With a screenplay written by Seth Rogen and Ben Stiller, Vince Vaughn, Jonah Hill, and Billy Crudup starring, expectations are high for The Watch to serve up something original and fun. That said, like many movies featuring these Hollywood superstars, the humor is geared toward mature audiences, so parents should be expecting lots of strong language, drinking, smoking, crass sexual behavior, and slapstick violence. You may have already seen the trailer for Ben Stiller, Vince Vaughn, Jonah Hill and – hooray! – Richard Ayoade’s new comedy, Neighbourhood Watch. But that movie doesn’t exist anymore. Or at least, the title doesn’t. Now the movie is simply called The Watch and has cranked out a new, red band full-length trailer. Take a gander below.The premise has not changed: the foursome are still part of a neighbourhood watch group formed less from a sense of community responsibility and more for the chance to escape their dull suburban lives and enjoy a little bit of a power trip. But they get far more than they bargained for when they discover evidence that something otherworldly is going on.
<br /><br />While the whole alien element has been kept low-key, this latest promo shows the lads exchanging some predictably raunchy banter, but also gives us some solid evidence that their seemingly quiet little ‘burb has been invaded by some non-human new residents.
<br /><br />As for the title swap, that’s been forced by the real-life shooting death of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin at the hands of a neighbourhood watch member in Florida last February. You can see why a film that features a neighbourhood watch element going up against kids might consider the shift.
<br /><br />With Hot Rod director Akiva Schaffer working from a script by Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, The Watch will arrive in the US on July 27 and hits our screens on August 29.

<br /><br />While details on the film have been slim, an announcement email from Fox Searchlight sent out today not only reveals the name change and a limited release date (July 25), it also discloses the full synopsis of the film. The film centers on Paul Dano‘s character, a once-successful young author who is felled by some intense writer’s block and a dismal love life. When he starts writing about a new character, Ruby, Calvin’s spark comes back – but everything is thrown into disarray when he discovers Ruby (Kazan) in his apartment.
<br /><br />But, not for the first time, all it takes for a man to be inspired is the right woman, who in this case is Ruby (Kazan), an offbeat redhead with luminous blue eyes Calvin meets in a park. Immediately, the words start to flow again as he works on his Olympic portable. “It's almost like I'm writing to spend time with her,” he marvels as the pages begin to accumulate. Suddenly, however, she materializes in his apartment, his imaginary muse suddenly flesh and blood before his eyes.
<br /><br />The most conventional scenes, in which Calvin has his brother Harry (Chris Messina) over to convince him that Ruby's for real, are also among the funniest. It's Harry who challenges Calvin to write something to see if Ruby follows suit. When, just short of the story's halfway point, Calvin finally accepts the reality of the power he has over his dream girl, he vows, “I'll never write about her again.”Further abrupt personality shifts and relationship imbalances follow, but when Kazan seems to have written herself into an inescapable corner, she manages with impressive dexterity to address the manifestly implausible nature of her creation on the way to a resolution that's sweet and, happily, doesn't feel like a cheat.
