But doctors think otherwise when you ask them. When the moles are in normal shape and when the normal moles do not increase, you need not fear that it might turn cancerous. But any abnormal or unusual changes in the shape, size or even the number should warn you that something bad may happen in the future. Then you must definitely take steps to eliminate those moles at once. If you notice even the slightest change in the color of the moles or other similar changes, do not hesitate to go to a skin doctor or a dermatologist.

<br />There are few things that you might require while <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5tb2xlZ29uZS5uZXQvc2tpbi1tb2xlLXJlbW92YWwuaHRt" target="_blank">removing skin moles</a>. Among them are items like bandage, baking soda, garlic juice, honey, apple cider vinegar, and others. How do you apply apple cider vinegar juice on the moles? First, get some cotton ball and make sure it is sterilized. Dip the cotton ball into the vinegar until it has been fully soaked. Apply it on the area where the mole is. Putting a bandage over the cotton ball will ensure that the mole will truly be thoroughly applied with the apple cider vinegar. Change the cotton ball on a daily basis. This is done for around one month. Then the desired results will start to show. Sometimes, you could notice some scarring. But this cannot be avoided in natural remedies.
<br /><br />Honey is also a very effective product to be used in mole removal. Put honey on the moles for about 15 to 30 minutes. Honey is very safe, since it contains absolutely nothing that could <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5tZWRpY2luZW5ldC5jb20vYWxsZXJneS9hcnRpY2xlLmh0bQ__" target="_blank">cause allergies</a>. Even if it is placed on the skin for a long time, it is safe. Afterwards, use warm water to wash it all off. Make it a point to use only lukewarm water. It can be done daily until the moles disappear. This need not be applied on moles near the hair, as honey might cause graying of hair in some people. The moles could also start to disappear if you make it a habit to rub pineapple juice on them around four times a day. You may also want to forego the juice and directly rub pineapple slices on the moles. Or you could take a bit of the juice and use it to rub on the moles. There wouldn't be any fear of charring or burning of the skin. Even if there are scars, it will be very small and will not be noticed.
<br /><br />If you choose to use baking soda as a mole remover, then you should probably know that there is a system to it. For instance, you can apply half a teaspoon of baking soda along with castor oil. Make sure you only use about 5 drops of castor oil. After mixing the two together, it will then be applied directly on the moles. If you wish, you can just place a bandage on the moles after applying oil and baking soda mixture. Leave this on overnight. The bandage can be removed in the morning when you wash off the mixture from the skin. This is followed for around one month to get a good result.
<br /><br />Many people claimed to have tried these home remedies and achieved great success. They are satisfied with these remedies as it does not cause any side effects. Surgery is also an option to have moles removed, especially if the moles are found to be cancerous.

Sunlight could be one of those two reasons. Skin aging accelerates when it is exposed to the sun or its ultraviolet rays. This is the type of aging that most people try to avoid since it is premature. If the skin gets damaged too much, it could result to skin cancer or melanoma. There are a lot of studies and research which tackles the interconnection between mole formation, exposure to radiation and melanoma.
<br /><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/179671103_14328601_49278726.jpg" />
<br />The other reason that could be blamed for the emergence of <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2VuLndpa2lwZWRpYS5vcmcvd2lraS9NZWxhbm9jeXRpY19uZXZ1cw__" target="_blank">facial moles on the skin</a> would be genetics. Genetics is one of the main reasons for many medical conditions and illnesses that is besetting many people. So if you discover moles suddenly springing up in various parts of your body, you can bet your top dollar that genetics has something to do with it. Perhaps your ancestors and even your parents also have facial moles. Moles that can be attributed to heredity are known to pose high risks of developing into melanoma or skin cancer. Treating it would need a lot more care than usual. Often, the suggested method of treatment would include laser surgery or even cryosurgery. You can also choose to apply immediate surgical procedures, excision being one of them.
<br /><br />Heredity is usually the main reason for the formation of the type of moles we know as dysplastic nevi. This will lead to the development of hundreds of moles on the body. The larger moles are deemed to be atypical moles. If these large moles reach a high number, maybe 50 or so, you could be sure that skin cancer or melanoma is a very high probability. You have to be more watchful and monitor these moles closely. 
<br /><br />Does age have a bearing on mole formation and development? Usually, moles appear while one is still young and, in some cases, gradually disappear as they grow older. Those who have a white skin will actually be having more moles. An average of 30 moles could appear. Sometimes, they might even have around 400 moles. The length of the telomere will have a lot to do with the number of moles that will eventually appear in one person. 
<br /><br />The longer the telomere is, the more moles there will be forming. The telomere of a person with 10 moles will be considerably shorter than the telomere of a person with 50 moles. You can be sure that the telomere will also have a lot to do with the aging process of an individual. Technically, moles are skin lesions and they are known as nevi. Moles appear not only on the surface of the skin. There are moles that can form underneath the surface. In other cases, they can be found above the surface of the skin. 
<br /><br />The decision to remove the mole or to allow them to remain on the skin depends on both health as well as cosmetic reasons. If you want to look better and the only way to achieve that is to have those moles removed, you can try laser surgery.

There are many instances where the skin moles are removed purely for cosmetic reasons. In fact, majority of these procedures are carried out for cosmetic purposes. In a few cases, where doctors have reason to believe that the moles may be cancerous, the removals may be carried out for clinical purposes. Aside from cancer risks, there are also other health risks and dangers posed by moles when they are not removed.
<br /><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/179671103_8515911_49521325.jpg" />
<br />Dermatologists - doctors who are experts when it comes to skin care - are the ones who are usually conducting these skin mole removal procedures. But many general medicine practitioners are also able to carry out the said removals. General medical practitioners are also able to carry out these procedures, which qualify as minor surgical procedures. It is probably only when the moles are a bit more complicated or deep-seated that they can turn it over to the dermatologists. In the event that the moles are found to be potentially cancerous, they should be referred to oncologists. When it comes to cancers, the specialists are the oncologists.
<br /><br />The use of anesthesia is often employed when these procedures are carried out. This means that they are painless (and there is therefore no reason to fear them). This means the patient will remain conscious all throughout the procedure because there was a local anesthesia administered which doesn't make you lose consciousness. The patient only loses 'sensation' in the anesthetized part of the body. After the procedure, it is a given that the anesthesia will wear off, and that is when the pain will be felt. The solution for this is to use painkillers that have been prescribed by the doctor. In most cases, the wounds incurred in the course of having skin moles removed heal within a few days. It is also possible that hospitalization would be required in case the wounds do not heal and actually become worse. Such cases are rare though. 
<br /><br />There are also instances when the wounds are stitched by the doctors after the skin mole removal procedure has been performed. This is applicable when the moles removed are so deep that there is a <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2VuLndpa2lwZWRpYS5vcmcvd2lraS9SaXNr" target="_blank">risk</a> to some of the sensitive tissues being infected if they are left open. Stitching is also done in the case of large moles where long and considerable incisions had to be performed to remove them.
<br /><br />One thing that everyone should be aware of is the possibility of having scars at the end of a procedure which involves incision. Thus, if one is seeking to have the moles removed for cosmetic purposes, he or she has to know that there will be a tradeoff. The moles are likely to be gotten rid of, but in their place, we are likely to have scars. So it becomes a question of figuring out which is better between living with moles or living with scars.

They only underwent some changes, both major and minor. While it is true that products for skin care and mole removal keep popping up left and right, you cannot trust all of them to be actually effective in removing the moles. Hence, people need to have some understanding of not only what the products are, or the various functions in skin care, but also the mole condition and its causes. Aside from the skin or mole removal product that you will be using, you should also give equal attention to your skin. When choosing which skin product will be safe and effective for your skin and your mole condition would be greatly affected by your knowing exactly what type of skin you have.
<br /><br />You should definitely start doing some research first. Benign mole growths are not excuse to use your skin to test the different mole removal products until you find one that actually works. If the products fail to give the desired result, it could actually make the problem even worse. A wise step toward complete treatment and removal is seeking the medical advice and attention of a dermatologist. He is actually in the best position to make suggestions about what treatment you should use after conducting tests that would analyze your skin and the mole condition.
<br /><br />This brings us to the products that you will use to deal with the moles. The length of time it would take for your treatment for mole removal would depend on both the products you will use and your skin type. Most of the products commonly sold nowadays are manufactured in the form of creams. Mole removal will take place once these creams, which are a combination of natural and artificial ingredients, are applied directly on the affected area or the moles. You should pay extra attention on what the components are.
<br /><br />To prevent making use of a cream that contains components that would damage your <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2VuLndpa2lwZWRpYS5vcmcvd2lraS9Ta2lu" target="_blank">skin</a>, it is important to read everything that is written on the labels of these creams. Ask the vendor about the cream and what it is all about, even if you bought it with a doctor's prescription.
<br /><br />Did you know that even natural homemade creams can still pose a risk to the person using it? The real dangers in homemade natural mole removal creams are the amounts one should apply and the right intervals. Granted that most of creams are made from edible food products, but the wrong quantities for the various ingredients used to make the cream my give negative results. Before applying anything, you should arm yourself with information first.
<br /><br />Now we can also see pills for this purpose being manufactured although the users still haven't fully latched on to it. They are still dubious about its effectiveness. The mere fact that pills cannot be applied directly on the skin is one reason why the public is still yet to embrace these pills as mole removal products.

The reason why they are referred to as natural methods is because the main tool or resource used are plant products.

But the people suffering from these mole conditions have a number of options when it comes to the treatments they could use for these problems. The common surgery method is a very simple and very quick method for this problem. The process is fast and come with minimal to no pain at all. The skin where the mole is would be applied with the proper anesthetic, and the dermatologist would then proceed to cut the mole off. Some stitches will be necessary if the mole was big, but in most situations that is never the case. The healing of the stitches will be aided by some pills that the doctor will prescribe for the pain.
<br /><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/179671103_10081197_50461391.jpg" />
<br />Freezing is another surgical treatment but with a high degree of sensitivity. In this procedure, liquid nitrogen will be directly applied on the moles and this will cause them to wither until they eventually fall off. It could get painful and you should probably expect to have some scars, depending on the type of your skin. Cryotherapy - the other name for this process - should be done with a dermatologist's presence.
<br /><br />It would also please you to know that there is a more recently develop surgical treatment that has been known to remove moles easily and successfully. Just like cauterization, the area around the skin would have to be numbed by the doctor first before the mole is cut off. The mole will be removed by using an electric point directly on the inner skin tissue it is attached to. The mole cell will get the direct hit, and soon you won't have to worry about the mole coming back after it has been removed. Scars, however, are a huge possibility in this procedure, which is also known as electrosurgery.
<br /><br />Surgical mole treatment methods are known to provide effects that are more lasting or permanent than other options. However, not all surgical methods will apply to everyone because of the diversity in skin types. This is especially apparent in laser surgery. You will notice that darker skin would show more flawless results than people with lighter skin who underwent the procedure. In this procedure, the nerves and <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2VuLndpa2lwZWRpYS5vcmcvd2lraS9UaXNzdWVfKGJpb2xvZ3kp" target="_blank">skin tissue</a> where the moles are located are directly treated with a special light - or laser - to kill them. Often, the healing process could last for two weeks, tops. But take note that this procedure does not come cheap at all.
<br /><br />Further evaluations and assessments would reveal that there are upsides and downsides to all of these surgical treatments. It would be up to you to study them carefully in order to make a good decision on which surgical procedure to apply. With the help of a doctor who have made the requisite tests and skin type analysis, you will be able to choose better when it comes to which surgical procedure you should go for. It would be in your best interests if you get as much information as you need about your mole condition and how to get rid of moles before taking the final step and choosing one specific surgical process to undergo.

Almost every one in the world has a mole. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5tb2xlZ29uZS5uZXQ_" target="_blank">Skin moles</a> are not harmful but sometimes they become the root cause for cancer. Shapes, colors, types, and size makes moles different from each other.
<br /><br />It is natural if moles are formed. The formation of moles takes place because of the disturbance in melanin and further it results in formation of melanocytes. These melanocytes form a cluster of cells which gives a shape of growing skin.
<br /><br />Moles are not restricted to the skin of the face. People have moles on the skin and might be anywhere on the body. Moles are developed in the young age up to 20 years. If your mole looks ugly to you then you can remove it in many ways.
<br /><br />Excision is the method to remove mole surgically. Proper treatment requires use of anesthesia. To lesser the pain anesthesia is used. During the unconsciousness, removing the mole and stitching of the skin is done; thus the patient doesn't feel any pain. Two methods of excision is stitches and <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2VuLndpa2lwZWRpYS5vcmcvd2lraS9DYXV0ZXJpemF0aW9u" target="_blank">cauterization</a>. These methods are totally different. Cauterization is done by burning the mole and stitching is done by cutting the grown part.
<br /><br />Remedies at home are tried to eliminate this mole completely. Herbal medicines are used for this kind of method. People use different, home available things, such as baking soda, garlic etc, for this purpose. These remedies don't work on cancerous moles.
<br /><br />For removing moles, laser therapy is also considered as one of the best method. People scared of surgeries, might find this is an easy way. Cells of the moles are killed by subjecting laser on them. But the problem is that sometimes cells under the skin fail to die and the mole may grow back again.
<br /><br />Direct consultation with the specialist is known as prescription method. Consultants give medicines related to moles.
<br /><br />The most painful method is shaving the mole off. In this method, the moles grown on the skin surface, is completely removed with a tool. Don't forget to sterilize the tool before cutting the mole.
<br /><br />One can kill the mole by decreasing the temperature and this method is known as cryosurgery. The cells present in the mole will die at low temperature. The instrument used for cutting is dipped into the nitrogen liquid, which lowers its temperature. With the decreased temperature mole doesn't grow back because the blood circulation is stopped, and no blood reaches the skin moles.
<br /><br />Recognizing the mole is also an important feature. The most common type of skin moles are nevi. These moles are just like any other growth on the skin, and people have many moles of this kind sometimes 10 plus. The congenital mole is possessed by the person since his birth. A typical mole is very irregular in shape.<object width="336" height="295"><param name="movie" value="http://en.pan.netcom/go/widget/videoID=en-4635709"></param><param name="wmode" value="window"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><embed src="http://en.pan.netcom/go/widget/videoID=en-4635709" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowFullScreen="true" wmode="window" width="336" height="295"></embed></object>

You need not fear, that these moles can be cancerous. Most of them are benign, anyway. Do not think that you already have cancer simply because the shape, color and size of your mole have changed. 
<br /><br />Don't immediately go frantic with worry, until you had a doctor check it out. Other manifestations of skin moles are freckles and skin tags. Some people also have benign lenities or keratosis. It doesn't matter that moles are as diverse as they come, they can be easily dealt with using many mole removal methods.
<br /><br /><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/179671103_13325246_48237601.jpg" />
<br />Why do moles exist? 
<br /><br />Moles develop due to anomalies in the skin's cell formation. If the cells are aligned in such a way that they have enough space to themselves, moles would not be formed. If the cells are tightly packed together, moles are even quicker to develop. This crowding of melanocyte cells or concentration of the cells in a single area on the skin might lead to the development of moles. It is the melanocyte cells, that are responsible for skin pigmentation. Without melanocytes, you will not get your skin color. Many people attach doubt to the mole's color. 
<br /><br />Do the moles change the color and or become darker.
<br /><br />Changes in hormonal levels during pregnancy can cause darkening of mole's colors. It might also darken due to excessive exposure to the rays of the sun. Apart from this, you can experience a change in color, whenever there are hormonal variations in the body. It is normal to notice color changes in moles during the pubescent stages.
<br /><br />You may also have congenital moles, or those that appear from birth. These are permanent moles which do not fade out in course of time. One out of a hundred people has this congenital mole. Congenital moles have a greater chance of turning cancerous than the moles that are formed after birth. Skin cancer or melanoma could occur in them. Immediately consult a dermatologist if you fear you may have melanoma in your moles. When it exceeds 7mm, go straight to a doctor. 
<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jYW5jZXIuZ292L2NhbmNlcnRvcGljcy9mYWN0c2hlZXQvUmlzay9tb2xlcw__" target="_blank">Dyplastic moles</a> also exist. Dyplastic moles are way larger than your average moles. They do not have a shape. Because of this irregularity in shape and size, they are easily distinguishable. It is normal for one person to have more than a hundred of these moles all over their body. They are also more prone to cancer than those who have congenital moles.
<br /><br />A doctor should be consulted with at the smallest sign of alterations in color, size and shape of the mole.<object width="336" height="295"><param name="movie" value="http://en.pan.netcom/go/widget/videoID=en-4667342"></param><param name="wmode" value="window"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><embed src="http://en.pan.netcom/go/widget/videoID=en-4667342" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowFullScreen="true" wmode="window" width="336" height="295"></embed></object>

<br /><br />Mole is an unwanted skin condition generally found among many people. Skin moles, in medical world, are termed as, 'Melanocytic nevi'. They are harmless and benign. They do not bother persons, since they are not itchy. Not all moles may be present at birth. Person tends to develop them later in his life. Congenial growth of the human skin is nothing but skin moles. Moles are dark in colour.
<br /><br />Factors responsible for moles' formation
<br /><br />Skin moles are caused, when cells, named as 'Melanocytes', tend to grow collectively, rather than spreading separately. Genetic reasons are one of the reasons behind having this problem. One of the reasons for formation of these, is overexposure to sunrays. Hormonal imbalance may also turn out to be the cause behind these. You may be eager to find out '<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5tb2xlZ29uZS5uZXQvaG93aXR3b3Jrcy5odG0_" target="_blank">how to get rid of a mole</a>'. You will find answers as you move further. 
<br /><br />Are moles cancerous?
<br /><br />Most of the moles are benign, excepting a few, which may tend to be cancerous. When the family history is affected by skin cancer, the person with moles has to be vigilant, since there are more chances that he will develop some moles likely to give him skin cancer. Dysplastic moles cause melanoma cancer, which is rare type of skin cancer. When moles suddenly change their characteristics, such as sudden change in colour etc, it's an indication, that consultation with the doctor is must.
<br /><br />Is it possible to remove these?
<br /><br />There is only one answer to it, that is, 'Yes'. With simple remedies, it can be removed. Rubbing gently on the affected area by using castor oil can work wonders. Simply placing slices of pineapples may help to get rid of moles. Honey mixed with flax-seed oil is very good and can be applied as a lotion. These remedies do take a lot of time to fructify. Hence, one must be patient enough to try these. Due to advancement in the medical field, there are a lot of creams and other products available in the market. Since these are not time-consuming and prove to be effective, people prefer these to natural remedies. A day may come, when the person will find them disappeared.

<br /><br />The option of surgical procedures is always available to those, who can not wait and want immediate results. There is always a possibility of scars, when a person tries to remove moles at home. Size of the mole decides size of scar. This is the reason why, a certified doctor is required. An expert dermatologist is the best person to do this job, rather than anyone else. But it is required that before you take any decision, you are needed to consult a doctor, as surgery may cause infection, and even nerve damage in some cases. Furthermore, people may find it in excess of their financial capacity. 
<br /><br />Final words:

They do not have to be removed mandatorily. However, they may cause social embarrassment to some people. This might lead to low self-esteem and lack of confidence. In some cultures, moles at certain spots are regarded as beauty marks. Achieving perfection in everything is becoming motto of life. An easy question must be asked before following any measures...Is it not chasing perfection constantly making us lose our individuality?

This shows that hormones have a role to play in the appearance of moles. When there is a hormonal change in puberty, moles can form.

They feel that the facial beauty will be enhanced to a great extent, if the blemishes and the moles or warts on the face are removed without any scars or wounds. Even a single mole that has formed on the chin, cheek or forehead can make some people spend so much money just to get them erased. Other people would probably think that's a total waste of money. 
<br /><br />You can't deny the advancement in the field of science and technology, though. Laser surgeries on the face are now being performed in hospitals that it is no longer a strange sight to behold the number of people going there just for that. Despite the risks that come with surgical procedures, they are willing to give the treatment a try. It is a fact that cosmetic surgery was responsible for many changes. Of which, some were drastic. 
<br /><br />Tired of Melanocytic nevus...wondering <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5tb2xlZ29uZS5uZXQvaG93aXR3b3Jrcy5odG0_" target="_blank">how to get rid of moles</a>? You can perform the following simple procedures. What you should do first is to get the best doctor; preferably one who is a specialist in skin problems or plastic surgery. The doctor will provide you lots of information on the budget and the actual procedure. He will discuss about the important factors that need to be considered before taking up any course of medication or any surgical procedure.
<br /><br />It could be risky especially for those who have allergic reactions to some ingredients of the cream itself. Thus it is not advisable to try out any type of topical as well as internal medication, without consulting a physician. All the risks and benefits you will be getting from the laser surgery will be summed up to you. This will bring you a sense of calm when the day of the procedure arrives. You will be clearly explained about what will be done during the mole removal surgery before entering into the operation theater. 
<br /><br />Once these are done, you can arrange a specific date for the surgery to take place. On the day of operation, local anesthetic will be given. The purpose of this is to numb the area to be treated. The cutting of the mole will be performed using sterilized medical tools and equipment. The scalpel will be used particularly to shave off the mole. The depth to which the cut will be extended will depend on the type of moles. 
<br /><br />Melanoma is harmful and thus has to be cut straight from the bottom. Slight shaving will easily remove other normal moles. If it is a raised mole, then the depth of cutting will also increase accordingly. The follow up treatment after the laser surgery or excision surgery is also important and needs to be followed appropriately. 
<br /><br />There are also various forums or blogs on how to get rid of <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2VuLndpa2lwZWRpYS5vcmcvd2lraS9NZWxhbm9jeXRpY19uZXZ1cw__" target="_blank">moles</a>. You will be surprised when you read through them because you will learn that items you would normally find at home such as pineapple extract, flax seed oil, garlic, or coriander seed paste are also useful as mole or skin tag removers. You may try these methods, although you shouldn't expect the effects to be as fast as that of laser surgery.

If you are one of the unlucky ones, then you should get acquainted with the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5tb2xlZ29uZS5uZXQv" target="_blank">mole removal</a> methods at once.
<br /><br /><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/179671103_14328601_49278726.jpg" />
<br /><br />The first decision you have to make is whether you want the treatment to be performed by a professional or if you want it done in the comforts of your home. Professionals would mean you would have to choose among facial mole removal methods that include excision, cauterization, cryotherapy, and shaving.
<br /><br />With excision, a sharp blade will be used to cut out the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2VuLndpa2lwZWRpYS5vcmcvd2lraS9NZWxhbm9jeXRpY19uZXZ1cw__" target="_blank">mole</a> and stitches will have to be done. It is possible that this facial mole removalmethod can leave a scar that is noticeable ' a tradeoff to it being not too expensive. It will be up to you whether you will send the mole that has been removed for testing to see whether it is malignant or benign.
<br /><br />Electrical current is the main element in removing moles through the method known as cauterization. Electricity is used to burn off the mole. This is more expensive than excision and is more painful as well. However, it happens to be one of the most effective treatments.
<br /><br />Cryotherapy is a very cheap facial removal method that involves freezing the mole by nitrous oxide and thus destroying the mole. But not a lot of people are impressed with it. It is the least effective of the methods and it can cause many side effects, including blistering and other skin irritations.
<br /><br />Shaving of the mole means removing the mole with the scalpel. There will be no stitching required, which is the case with excision. Aside from being deemed as the safest method, you won't have any worries of your skin being marred by scars. But, as is the case of any type of shaving, it's not a permanent solution. You would have to shave regularly as the mole grows back.
<br /><br />Laser mole removal is another favorite among the many facial mole removal methods. You won't have to worry about scarring or any pain (ergo the non-use of anesthetics), despite the fact that this is the most expensive method there is. Since it is without pain, people prefer it over other methods. Moreover, there is not even that feeling of discomfort that you get from other methods. But since it takes a while for the laser to penetrate deep into the skin and kill the mole at its root, you'd have to go for repeat treatment sessions.
<br /><br />Nowadays, there are quite a lot of creams in the drugstores that promise to remove the moles. Most of them are cheap but whether they produce the desired results is questionable, especially since the same cream will have different effects on different skin types.
<br /><br />There are a number of questions you should first ask yourself when deciding which facial mole removal method to use. How much pain can you bear? How much are you willing and able to spend? Will you do it without anesthesia or with? How long do you want to wait before the moles disappear? Consider all of the above and then make a decision that will be the best one for you.

<br />Do you know that there are simple home remedies for mole removal? You can have your home mole removal after a biopsy has been conducted. A cancerous mole should be operated on as early as possible to avoid its spread to other parts of the body. If it is found to be malignant, go ahead with your home mole removal methods. 
<br /><br />You should take note of the color of the moles, how large they are and how deeply rooted they are. After proper guidance from a dermatologist and after confirming that the moles are not malignant, you can try the methods for <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5tb2xlZ29uZS5uZXQvZmFjaWFsLW1vbGUtcmVtb3ZhbC5odG0_" target="_blank">mole removal at home</a>.

This application should be done regularly until the moles have completely disappeared. Application can be done on areas other than the face. You can try it on any part of the body.

<br /><br />Wash the area around the moles thoroughly with warm water. Use a towel to dry it afterwards. Dip cotton swabs into apple cider vinegar and apply on the moles. You should be mindful of the acidic content of the vinegar. Too much of acid level might lead to charring of the skin layer and lead to permanent damage. 
<br /><br />The best position to be in while applying this treatment is to be flat on your back. It is better not to lie under a fan, as it will lead to quick drying and evaporation of vinegar. If it does, the treatment will not be as effective. Do this treatment for ten days in succession, with each daily session lasting ten minutes each. You can perform it daily, three to four times each day. Then rinsing is performed using cool water. 
<br /><br />Use of honey on the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy53ZWJtZC5jb20vc2tpbi1wcm9ibGVtcy1hbmQtdHJlYXRtZW50cy9ndWlkZS9tb2xlcy1mcmVja2xlcy1za2luLXRhZ3M_" target="_blank">moles</a> can also help in fading of moles over a period of time. You can skin the drinking of the juices and apply them directly on the moles instead. Every morning, you can apply pineapple juice on your face. It is known to have an effect on the melanin present in the moles, which is responsible for their pigmentation. Over a period of time, the moles will fade out and it will disappear completely in a month.

It would be to your advantage if you get the opinion of a dermatologist before undergoing any sort of treatment for your skin. Before recommending a specific treatment, a thorough assessment of the moles will have to be done by the doctor. 
<br /><br />If the moles are too large and if it keeps growing, then it cannot be usually treated by simple and natural methods. You may use the natural remedies but the results you want could take ages before they appear. Surgeries could bring you the results you want much faster. There might be slight scar formation, but your facial beauty will be restored.
<br /><br /><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/179671103_8515911_49521325.jpg" />
<br /><br />A biopsy test is usually recommended by doctors. A negative result in the biopsy test is the go-signal required by some to proceed with natural treatments to remove their smaller moles. However, it is a different story if it turns out that the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2VuLndpa2lwZWRpYS5vcmcvd2lraS9Nb2xlXyUyOHVuaXQlMjk_" target="_blank">moles</a> are cancerous. Excision would most likely be the recommended course of action. You have to ensure that the mole will be completely removed. If there are still small bits of the mole left behind, you are risking the cancer's recurrence. 
<br /><br />It is often recommended for older people to undergo laser treatments. If the patients are too old and they are unable to bear the pain of surgery, they can try the laser treatment. There is also the fact that, with laser treatments, you can be sure that the only thing targeted will be the moles. The skin and the cells around the moles will not be subjected to ill effects of the laser. The moles will be completely obliterated once they are hit with the laser light. 
<br /><br />The pigments found within the moles will be damaged. It will also leave the top part of the dermal layer destroyed. With smaller moles, you can expect to undergo this treatment only a few times. If, however, you have bigger moles, you may have no choice but to go to more treatment sessions. Portions of the moles will be removed with every session you undergo. You may notice a small scar forming during your last session. Do not worry; with due and proper care of your skin, these scars will eventually fade. The scars left behind by excision treatments are usually more pronounced than those caused by laser treatment. Use of razors will also lead to more scar formation and there will be excessive pain.
<br /><br />The pre treatment measures as well as the post treatment measures are always important. An example of a pre treatment measure is the application of cleansers on the areas affected before putting garlic paste or cumin seed paste on them. If cleansers are not applicable in your case, lukewarm water or soapy water would do. They will effectively wash away all the dirt and dust off your face.
<br /><br />Caring for your face or skin does not end when the treatment has been successfully carried out and you've gotten the results you wanted. As much as possible, stay away from direct sunlight. If you stay out in the sun too much or too long, the more damage it will cause to your skin. Other dark spots would simply take the place of the moles that were removed during the treatment. All your earlier efforts in removing the moles would have been all for nothing.

The cutaneous outgrowths that are often seen in people are referred to as skin tags. Basically, it is a loose pack of skin hanging from a stalk. These skin tags could be skin colored while others are brown. Other names for them are soft fibroma or papilloma colli.
<br /><br />It is quite often that you see people taking in illicit drugs and steroids for weight gain. Bodybuilders often do this because they need to gain weight really fast in order to perform better in their chosen sport. One of the bad effects of the steroids is the formation of skin tags in different region of the body. Collagen fibers becoming tangles and trapped beneath the skin leads to these outgrowths. Steroids and other causative agents can cause this bonding and tangling of collagen fibers, ultimately leading to the formation of skin tags. 
<br /><br /><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/179671103_15662943_49619030.jpg" />
<br /><br />It is probably noticeable how women who are undergoing hormonal changes at certain periods are more prone to having skin tags. This is indicative of a relationship between one's hormonal levels to the possibility of having skin tags appear. You may have seen pregnant women suddenly develop skin tags in the areas under their breasts or in their groins. Another noted cause for skin tag formation is the changes in the level of insulin in the body. It is not strange to see someone suffering from insulin resistance to have skin tags. Diabetes patients, for one, are skin tag-riddled most of the time. 
<br />Anybody ' men, women, adults, children, teenagers, babies, older people ' can have <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2VuLndpa2lwZWRpYS5vcmcvd2lraS9BY3JvY2hvcmRvbg__" target="_blank">skin tags</a>. The skin tags also appear randomly. It can appear on any part of the body, and also at any time. Thus it means that it can appear in normal people. You do not have to be in your teenage years or even pregnant to have one. There is no need to be a weightlifter or a bodybuilder. Some people might be more prone to skin tags than others, though. However, the bottom line is that skin tags can happen to anyone.
<br /><br />For men, skin tags often appear under the neck; for women, they can be found under the breast region. Skin tags are also developing in the underarm and eyelids among men. Sometimes, it can even appear in the middle region of the body or in the under folds of skin. Regions which are always exposed to the rubbing of skin and clothes will be more susceptible to the formation of skin tags.
<br /><br />Once you see skin tags appearing on your body, you might wonder why they are there to begin with or what caused them to surface at that particular point in time. According to doctors, it can even be present due to hereditary reasons. It is also a fact that overweight people tend to have more skin tags than thin people. Heredity would dictate that skin tags will be found from one generation to the next. That is the reason why you see whole families having these skin tags.
