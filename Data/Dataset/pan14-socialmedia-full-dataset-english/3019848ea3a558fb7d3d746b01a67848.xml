I felt very excited that i could taste delicious japanese food with my classmates and grade 12 students. 
<br />  DA YU is a cafeteria that famous for japanese food. It is a little expensive and 150RMB per person, so we ordered many different kinds of food. 
<br />  I ordered a onobrychis ice-cream for dessert first, because i liked eating sushi very much, so i ordered two kinds of sushi, one kind had vegetables inside, and the other had meat. Sushi was a type of traditional food in japan ,so i really liked it. 
<br />I also ordered roasted beaf because beaf was a kind of healthy meat and fulled of energy.I remembered that the roasted beaf and fish were also famous in japan,so l wanted to have a try to taste them. 
<br />  After about a few minutes ,my ice-cream was sent to me. The onobry on it was not sweet but the ice-cream tasted very well,but there was just a little ice-cream in the bowel.Less than the picture in the menu. 
<br />Then we waited for about 10 minutes, the sushi and roasted beaf were sent in order. I couldn't wait to eat them. I was surprised that the sushi there were very very big. As three normal sushi that i ate before, but i still tasted one. There was a piece of yuba outside the sushi ,and inside of the rice, there were some cucumbers, carrots and pickles in it. I thought it is healthy. The sushi is a little acid because there was a kind of special vinegar in it. Rice in it tasted very dilicious, i like the sushi! 
<br />Then i tasted the beaf. The beaf were cutten into many small pieces and a little sweet, but i liked it.The sauce on it smelt very nice. I ate three pieces and they were easy to chew. 
<br />I also eat the fish, pumpkin pies and many other japanese food. At the same time we chatted with grade 12 students about our study and played games. They were all very friendly. I really enjoyed the time and i will not forget it!

<br />I was very nervous when I came into rest house. Because I have never been to this place before, and the elder in it looked very strange. I encouraged myself to chat with them, because this is my duty there. I hoped they could feel happy. 
<br />This time ,I chatted with two old men. They told me a lot about their daily life in rest house that I couldn’t imagine before I came there. They were like the kids, they didn’t know what is camera. I took pictures for them , show them my school photos and told them the interesting stories in my school. They were very happy to listen to my stories. 
<br />After chatting with two old men, I knew deeply about the elder’s living situation in rest house. There are some facts and my opinions I have to write there and want you to know. 
<br /><br />THE ELDER’S LIVING SITUATION . 
<br />I feel a little sad when I have been to rest house. Almost the elder’s are not healthy people. I saw many old people were disabled. Some of them have just one arm or four fingers in a hand. Some of them sit in the wheelchair all day, they can’t do any exercise. Even there are some dementias. The can’t take care of themselves. From the talking I know that although their basic life can be continued there are some staves can help them, their lives are very boring. Because most of them are not a healthy person ,no one cares the details in their daily life. Like a old lady ,she often stays in bed ,so her bums are decay. Maybe a little exaggerating, but the old men are really pitiful. They need more attention from society. 
<br /><br />THEY NEED HOMAGE 
<br />The staves in rest house don’t respect them. They sometimes even say some bad words to them. I think this is very rude and unfair. They are old people ,although they are disabled. you can’t do like that. Everyone needs homage. 
<br /><br />THEY NEED TO BE LISTENED 
<br />The elder there are lonely ,their lives are very monotonous. Because they can’t go to someplace far from here. They hope someone who can listen to them. This morning ,the old man told me his life when he was young about 1 hour. I listened carefully,I knew he need to utter what he want to say. I think, we help them, not only on lives ,on eating, wearing….,but also the spiritaul, it is important too. Society need to pay more attention on these vulnerable, respect them, help them from the material and spiritual. 
<br />Finally, I talked with the president ,she is a kind women. She is friendly to the elder. She is truly love them. I will take more photos to the elder. I hope I can do better the next time. At the ending I want to say Please love the elder around us!

<br />Some white collars work there and foreigners  will eat here. The environment in the restaurant was very comfortable. Although there was a little dark but there was not much people here just a family there. We could hear the music when I came into the restaurant. The surveyors here were very polite and warm and they passed us the menu as soon as possible.    
<br />There were many kinds of American style food and I ordered a plate of special fried ice because I havn’t tasted before . Catherine ordered some vegetable salad. We waited for about 15 minutes and the food passed to us in order. The fried rice looked very colorful and I felt hungry when I smell the fragrance from the food. I couldn’t wait to taste it . There was sausages, shrimps , onion, eggs , peppers in it so it was nutrition and it tasted very good. The sausages and shrimps in it I liked very much.. I tasted some vegetable salad which from Catherine. I didn’t like the vegetables that without seasoning maybe I wasn’t used to eating it.
<br /> We ate the food quickly and both of us thought it was not bad and the environment ,surveys here was good, but the only disadvantage was the food here were expensive. A small cup of drink cost 26 RMB and it didn’t the price and some of the price of food I thought it was ok.. Over all I still enjoyed the fried rice and salad in Henry’s Home. If I had chance after that , maybe I will go there with my friends and parents.

Jiming Temple is a very famous Buddhism Temple in Nanjing and it attractes a lot of visitors to visits here and it is not far away from my school, so I choose to come here to learn more about Buddhism. I think Buddism is a kind of symbol of China, as a Chinese it is meaningful to know something about it.
<br />   When I got there it was almost 5:00pm and there was not much people here so the whole temple was  peaceful and solemnly in the sun set. 
<br />   After I enter into it I saw the main temple in the centre of the ground with the dazzling red gate. I took picture in front of the gate and when I come into the temple there were many colourful status of different Bodhisattva in it . The atmosphere suddenly becomes serious. I kneel on the small cushion in front of the status and kowtow to the Bodhisattva, at the same time I made some vows in my mind. It says it is very efficacious to make a vow in front of the Bodhisattva.
<br />  The most meaningful thing was that I interviewed a old Buddhist nun before I leave. She is very old and looks very kind. I asked her if they eat meet everyday ? She answered me determined that they never eat meet and they only eat vegetarian diet in the temple. I also very interested in their daily life and she told me that they got up at 4:00am everyday and then they started to pray to Buddha, after that they cleaned the yard. In fact there was no big difference between their lives and nomal peoples’. They have school and they can teach the teenagers and visitors about the Buddhism and she also told me many truths about life and I was very admire of her, but regrettable she didn’t want to took picture with and I could understand her.
<br />  I like this special experience because I know deeply about our traditional religious and learn a lot about how to live

<br />  About 5:00pm ,we got to the XuanWu Lake Park. The park is famous and not too far away from school. It took us about 15 minutes by bike to get there. We heard the flower exhibition from our planning teacher. She recommended us to enjoy the beautiful flowers here and many classmates said that was great after they came back from the exhibition.
<br />  The flower exhibition was mainly a rhododendron exhibition. The time we got park that there was not much people in it the park and the exhibition was very peace and quiet. We saw some parts of large green grassland and on the grass most of the area was empty but on the edge of the grass there are some rhododendron with different colours. When we saw this kind of scene. We felt a little disappointed because we spent time getting here, we hope we can enjoy the beautiful flower exhibition, but the most of the flowers withered away and there was almost no people. Like the end of a big party, we were late for it, but we can still find some flowers that bloomed, we took pictures with them.
<br />  When I looked at the colourful flowers, I felt that although we were late for the exhibition, we also enjoy the beauty of flowers.

This was the first time that I joined the band to performed in front of all the GCA students and teachers in the school assembly hall.
<br />  I learnt to play guitar for almost two years and I like rock music a lot so join or organize a band is my dream. After I got into GCA for a few months I knew GCA has its own band and this made me very excited and fortunately luckily the band was looking for a guitarist among the new students for preparing the Christmas Performance, so they contacted me. I was very happy to know the members in the band called lost soul and during the practicing time the three seniors and I  become good friends and they teach me a lot on the music, band even the study. The practicing was hard for me and during the weekends we still kept practicing .
<br />  After the three-week-practicing the performance day finally coming. In fact, I felt very nervous when I saw so many audiences . I tried to breath deeply to calm down and they encouraged me to try my best. We were the first and the enthusiastic applause from the audience made me more confidence. At the first song, because it was a little difficult to play so I made a mistake but in the second song—1973, I finished successfully.
<br />  We were all satisfied with the performance and it was also an indelible memory for me. I become more confidence and believed myself a lot and I also understand that if we want achieve our dreams, try your best to create chance for yourself and work hard on the precious chance is the only way. Don’t give up achieving your dreams!

The experience that I couldn’t forget were doing voluntary work for Nanjing Library.
<br />  In February,2010 my classmates and I went to the Nanjing Library to do voluntary work for them. We were arranged to help the area of comprehensive. We were surprised to see so many books in this big area of library and the thousands of books were put on different book shelves by their kind and each book has its number. Today our duty was to keep the book on the shelves in order and put the books in the barrow to the book shelves by their numbers. This work need us have enough patience and careless to finish because the numbers were in a mass and we must look for the right shelf one by one. After learning how to look for the right shelf from  enthusiastic book keeper, we start our works. At the beginning I was patient enough to look for the shelf from the side of the library to another side and put the book in right location, but after 30 minutes I couldn’t bear much more and the different books , numbers made me crazy and dizzy. I put the books away and didn’t want to touch them any more. The work was not as easy as we saw, it was boring and tired. My two classmates saw I was having a rest on the desk and asked me thoughtful what’s wrong with me and I told them I was crazy for the numbers , they smiled at me and said this work required enough patience and you should try your best to look for it and make yourself calm down when you feel dizzy about the boring work. I saw them still working hard and I felt ashamed so much. In the next several hours I try to do the work as my classmates said and I was surprised to find that if I try to keep myself calm down I didn’t felt crazy and boring much more and I could remember the numbers very clearly and quickly! This find made me pride a lot, so the work finished successfully in the following hours.
<br />  After this volunteer experience I learnt how to put the books for the library and how to keep patience when you feel boring on a thing you dislike. If we want to work effectively and safely with others to succeed as individual and collaborative workers, the learning and community skills are the most important two things. You can figure out others’ mistake and teach them quickly if you have a strong community skills and said politely , you will attract more admire and belief from your partners. From this experience I found out that to have a patient mentality is also important in our daily life and if we can listen to others’ suggestions about the mistakes I had and correct them on time we can collaborate with others easily in the life or for the job.
<br />  Overall, I benefited a lot from this volunteer experience.

The main activities I did were climb the mountains, skip and rope, running , sit up, ride the bike, play the badminton, jogging.
<br />  In the October in last year my class went to climb Jiuhua Mountain with our Mandarin teacher together. This was a meaningful activity experience for me. We kept climbing the mountain for more than 1 hours until we got to the top of the mountain. During the climbing I was very tired and wanted to have a rest a lot but I still insisted climbing because I knew if I stop I would not have strength any more and we also helped each other during the climbing. From this activity, as an athlete I learnt that insist doing a thing is very important during our life and we can’t give up easily. Insist doing it, maybe you will achieve successful and also help each other in your groups can gain more friendship for you and the friend may help you when you meet difficulties in the future. My fitness goal is that never gives up when I have not finished a thing yet, so the climbing matches it very well.
<br />  Skip and rope, sit up are my mainly physical activity during my school time, because I like taking exercise so I did this two activities many years ago and I an used to doing them every day for an hour. I think this was a way to insist exercising and it can also lose fit. Sometimes after school I felt very tired and don’t want to do anything any more but I think that if today I don’t do it, may be tomorrow, the day after tomorrow I will not do it again so I force myself to do. I can have a rest during skip and rope and this activity made my arms full of power and I am healthier than before.
<br />  In the weekend, I have more free time than when I at school so I choose some long-time activity like ride bike and running. I like riding bike in a sunny day because as an athlete I can enjoy the beautiful scene outside and take exercise at the same time, and this activity match my fitness goal because it is a free activity for me, I can go anyplace I want to goal. From riding bike I also learn how to enjoy life. Running is harder than riding a bike because it consumes my strengths a lot but I think it is a good chance to train my endurance so if I do it, I will insist finishing it.
<br />  From doing all the activity, the meaningful benefit is that they let me know the importance of endurance. You need it when you do anything in your life, so do not give up easily.

The exhibition was hold in Shanghai Art Museum and this famous museum attracted many visitors from all over the world. It was a Japanese artist’s personal exhibition and it was my first time to enjoy a kind of Japanese art in such a realistic place so I felt interesting.
<br />  The title of the exhibition was called The Message From Another space and the name of the artist was Eitaroh Miyajima. All the artwork in this exhibition was made by himself and the paintings were chosen from all his work from 1999 to 2009. The style of his artwork were paintings and drawings. The art was modern and seems a little surrealism. I think he mixed reality and fantasy together very well. The inspiration of the exhibition were all from the real life. The paintings were all acrylic paint.
<br />When I saw the paintings I was attracted by them. They were contemporary but full of thought and the colour of the paintings were very beautiful. There was a short poem for every part of the exhibition, It was his thought from life. When I enjoyed the artwork, a big paintings on the wall attracted me to see it clearly because of the colour.
<br />  The name of the painting was Spring Has Come. It finished in 2003. The artist used plenty of colourful, wide, wave lines, like the rainbows and he also used many many round shape patterns and a few of small triangles, there were also a few of narrow rectangles like the fingerboard of piano. The colours of the artwork has a strong opposite feelings. The most of the part above the whole painting is black like the universe and in the centre of the paintings  becomes very colourful and warm. I see the background of the painting is black universe, there is a red sun in the universe. Two colourful wide, wave lines. Behind the colourful lines there is a fingerboard of piano, under the piano there are many collective dark blue cobblestones.
<br />  When I look at the artwork I feel the colours are very comfortable and made me feel very warm although I am in a cold space, made me think the life is warm like in the spring. The artwork male me think about the music in the spring, a girl is playing piano in the wind of spring. The artwork reminds me an experience that I used to have an outing in spring and we left home at four o’ clock in the early morning, it was dark and cold outside but after few hours, the sun rose and the world became warm and thrive. I think he wants to communicated a kind of expectation of the future, just like the coming spring in the dark space, like the title of the artwork: Spring Han Come. The world is wonderful.
<br />In my opinion the artwork is successful . The colours and my first feeling of the artwork make me think this. I can understand the intension of the artist and what he wants to tell us although the images are abstract. I think a successful artwork is that can let you experience the feeling of the artist  although you are just standing in a museum. The painting can make me full of energy and when I feel upset, it can let me know the life is still as warm as spring, as wonderful as spring. I would buy it if I can.
<br />This exhibition made me think a lot about my life, and I enjoyed it a lot.

<br /><br />Summer is a suitable season for doing abroad wide range of activities. I enjoy doing activity in the summer holiday, especially swimming in the pool.
<br />  I swim twice a week during the summer holiday. I try to swim as long as possible because I think it is a such useful activity for keeping fit and exercise our endurance and I also love this activity because it is comfortable in the cool water. I can say goodbye to the hot weather so I really enjoy swimming. I have learnt how to swim when I was in elementary so I can swim very well now. It is a difficult process to learn how to swim and we need long time to practice. I learnt breaststroke very well although it can’t be very quick and it can exercise every part of muscle of our body. First to know how to float on the water it is a very basic and important part in swimming. We keep breathing and relax then screen living breath to get into water, it is very easy to float. Then we can learn alternated breathing and other swimming techniques.
<br />  I also did some other activities during holiday like skip rope, ride bicycle and sit-up. From last term, I have kept doing these activities.
<br />  I do skip rope every day at home. I think it is a convenient activity foe us because it needn’t too much space and any equipment so I choose to keep doing it.
<br />  For ride bike, I just choose comfortable weather to do this activity and each time about 1 hour. I like enjoying nice view and sunshine at the same time.
<br />  From doing physical activity I think to insist it is very important.

<br />  The second season of Rock Festival in NanJing called “bloom” started from April 30th to May 2nd. This was a piece of surprising new to me as a rock fan. I went to the first season of Rock Festival, because of the terrible weather, the heavily rain on that day, the performance was not as perfect as I expected, so I looked forward to this time of Rock Festival. In the afternoon of 2nd of May, my family and I drive to the Binjiang Park, where the Rock Festival was. 
<br />  It was really better than before. From the design of stage to the lighting equipment and the bands were better than last year too. I started excited before the show and I choose to stand in the first line, a good position to see the show clearly. Then, the performance began.
<br />  Until the last band called Left &amp; Right came out, the fans started to shout crazily. It was a different band from others before. When I heard the prelude and the sound of vocal, I was sure that I fell in love this band. It was my favorite heavy metal. The sound of vocal it’s murmur and gentle but full of power. His gesture on the stage was cool and attracted the attention from all the people. The other members had strong skill on instrument. Heavy metal required members played their instrument adroitly and quickly. This is the best band I saw in China. All the fans start getting high, shout and dance with the songs.
<br /> .This kind of Rock Festival improves the communication areas and development on rock. Rock was not very popular in China and this was a good chance to know and contact with rock. I opened up my filed of vision from this performance.

<br />  On the 19th December, Ereal and I went to that Church which located in Mochou Road. It was my first time to go to the church and experience Christ. We got there late so the Carol Service had already started for a while. The church was full of people and they sit quietly there, listened to the songs from the Holy Bible which sing the praised of the birth of the savior. The atmosphere was very solemn and sacred and I stand there gaze at the singers. They all wore white dress and hold a candle, nice and pure.
<br />  After the sing part, the next scene was the performance of the kids which from choir. The played the drama about how Jesus was born and his story. The kids were so lovely that they wore the costumes played seriously. From the show I knew the story of Jesus.
<br />  The third part was the performance from the believers. Most of them were good at singing and playing the piano. They were versatility. Some of them from China and some of them were from other countries and they were all kind and friendly. After all the show, the last part was pray. When the music of Silent Night started, emcee held the candle on the stage, pray with us. I closed my eyes and put my palms together devoutly, singing the song piously, meanwhile said wishes in my heart.
<br />  When we left the church, Ereal and I felt admired of this kind of activity. I knew the western culture more deeply from this religious service.

<br />  This year our band joined the show again but different from last year, we faced more challenges. One of our guitarists went to Canada and he was also our vocal, too. So other members in band recommend me to sing. I played guitar and sang at the same time, this was really a challenge to me. Other surprise was that one of the performance song was written by myself. I like to write songs in free time and this was my first time to write English song and sang it in front of all GCAs. 
<br />  Rehearse was hard and we practiced every night. Because we were the first one I felt quite nervous and check my guitar, loudspeaker box again and again to prevent any mistakes. After the announcement from the hosts, we went to the stage. The prelude of the first song was stated from my sweeping. I was afraid of mistaking but luckily I played it well. The song was easy to play, so the first song was successful.  
<br />  The main point was coming, my originally song. I sang it so carefully and put all my emotion into this song. I wrote the words from the experience in my real life like sang about myself. I felt proud that I can song my own song to you and I really enjoy it. The acclaim was loudly, the performance was successfully.
<br />  After it I felt I grow up a lot. I start to know I should take responsibility to my group and other members. We were the one.

Like skating club, music club, volunteer club, badminton club and so on. These clubs activities abundant my after-school life. I played different role in different club and learnt a lot from them.
<br />Volunteer club often organizes many interesting activities like this time they organized us to plant trees on Tree Planting Festival. That was such big event, on that day almost majority of GCA students and teachers joined. This can be considered as a club activity and I felt excited because I haven’t plant trees before. I didn’t have any experience on planting trees. We took on the bus for about two hours to reach Li Shui, a small prefecture near Nanjing. There was a very large park called Tian Sheng Bridge Park and that was especially for Tree Planting. It’s very crowded inside the park, people from other places also want to plant trees here. The problems were coming; we must work into many small groups but must follow the order from leader. Our group was separated with other people just because we waited for one student. We had to follow the crowded people and moved forward. Boys in our group took the response to carry the heavy hoes. After we arrived at our destination, we started to plant trees. This was one more challenges to us. We helped each other that boys removed the hard soils and rocks, dig a hole. Girls hold the small trees, let boys to add soils into the hole. It’s a difficult work for us, first time to plant trees.
<br />From Tree Planting I understand that to cooperate with others was a very important skill in communication, you can’t just think about yourself but also need to work hard on your own duty. Then you will finish your work perfectly. Volunteer club was such a good club to join, but the weakness was there were too much members in a club.
<br />Sports club was also very important for me to keep exercising every day. I favored the sports like badminton and skate, no violent training and you can enjoy the sports exercise. I am not good at running, basketball or football these kind of over strength sport. I like the peaceful life, do the stuff as slowly as possible. Skate matches my personality a lot. In a cool environment I felt comfortable and meanwhile I do the exercise

My mother knew a famous Thailand Restaurant in Hunan Road, so my parents, sister and i went to that restaurants called Golden Harvest Thai Opera Cafe at noon of that day.
<br />  Before we entered, the fervidly waitresses said hello in Thai to welcome us and they all wore the thai style clothes, very nice. The envirment of the restaraunt was comfortable and quietly. The overall arrangements of two floors in it was spaciously and tidy and enough for many customers to sit and enjoy food. The light of whole space not dazzling and bright, a little bit dark but soft, your eyes felt comfortable in this kind of light. Most of the customers are familes. Parents with their children, or with grade parents, not noisy. Generally I was satiesfied with this envirnment. 
<br />  It was my first time to taste Thai food and i was curious about it. The survive here was considerate and the waitress reconmmended us many speacil dishes. I ordered fried rice noodles, baked crab meet pie and fat of sago. My parents ordered some kinds of tea. After my first tasting of fried rice noodles, i was attracted by it speacil tasting. It tasted totally different from the fried rice noodles in China, it’s soft and full of elasticity. You can chaw it heavily, and the smelling was also different. They use a kind of perfume that from Thailand, a little bit sweet. My favourite food was fat of sago, it tasted fabulously good and i ate three of them! It was a kind of dessert famous in Thailand, very soft and smoothly, kind of like jello. Smelled like coconut. The baked crab meet pie also tated good. The meat pie were covered with lotus leaf from Thailand, so there is lotus smelling on it, very dilicious.
<br />  The main trait of Thai food was the utilize of perfume in different food, the perfume made them more taty than before and Thai food is bland diet, it’s also good for our health. I like this restaurant because of the enthusiasm survice of waitresses, so I recommond all of you to enjoy Thai food here! You will like here, too.

Recently our Biology class taught about evolution and classification of organisms. I thought there might be some relations between the museum and our Biology course, so I went to visit this museum with my mother on the 7th of May, during the weekend..
<br />Before entered the museum, we asked the staff about what’s in this exhibition. She introduced that there were mainly fossils of plants, animals, eggs or other things from different ancient time and introduction of each period. I felt excited about this museum. I was surprised when I saw a 6-meter-heigh dinosaur model at the entrance of museum. It’s so reality just like the real dinosaur ran out to our modern time. It was a big surprise for me and it was my favorite model in the museum.
<br />There were many fossils of turtle’s and dinosaur’s egg. Huge size fossil that formed by many small eggs. Until now these eggs were air drying and turned to hard stones. It’s looked pageantry. After we got to the second floor, the illustration on the wall beside the floor was bap. It meant the evolution of the species started. On the second floor it was divided into different part. The beginning exhibition area was the introduction of different kinds of fossils and creation process of a fossil. I read the introductions pictures and looked at the real fossils carefully. It was such a long time to create a fossil. The exhibition is inside start to introduce the classification of species and there was a picture of classification posted on the wall. I learnt this picture in the Biology class! I was excited that i could see the knowledge we learnt in class in the museum. I introduced the classification to my mother like what is Fungi, Planet and Animal. My mother was pleasure that I could use the information I learnt.
<br />The last area was just the picture introductions and some models, no real fossils. It told us the beginning and destroys of a period in ancient time. I learnt many reasons about why destroy would happed and the environment during that time. It was really a period that far away from modern time. Everything during that time was new and interesting to me. I was attracted by them.
<br />After visiting the museum I really learnt a lot about paleontology and the ancient organisms. They used to be the members of our earth but we had no chance to saw real them. Museum provides us a valuable chance to see them again.

My parents took me to see some exhibitions in Jiangsu Art Gallery in the morning. It was a modern museum that built not long ago and designed by a Germany. My mother likes to visit any kinds of art exhibitions and she thinks this is a good place to go and also a chance to improve my appreciation ability. I am also interested in art, so i went the gallery with my parents.
<br />Jiangsu Art Gallery is located near Nanjing Library and Nanjing Presidential, not far from our school and the ticket is free, so it was really a good to visit. On the first floor was a widely open space. The Exhibition of an artist called Liu Yi Fu put on display here and the introduction of him was covered the whole wall. He was a famous artist which bornt in 1960s and graduated from Nanjing Art School; he was good at painting on canvas. I was attracted by the style of exhibition so I enter the room.
<br />It was such wide room of this exhibition. The light is very dark inside and i felt cold. It created a kind of calm, lonely and peaceful atmosphere to match the style of painting. Only around each painting there was some bunches of soft light makes the painting looks full of beauty and peaceful. I like this kind of atmosphere, it calmed me.
<br />The styles of LiuGuo Fu’s painting were a little bit abstract. The main hues of first four painting were almost light grey. There was no people appear on the painting. He uses different luminance of light to create the mist view. Like wind flow through your brain, through the air. I felt lonely and deathly stillness when I saw these paintings. Like?I stand in a dark dream with sadness. I like this kind of misty style. My favourite painting called “No Name”. The colors of this painting start to become a kind of strongly visual impact, totally different from the ones before. Dark red and light yellow mix together then a steak of light white through the middle part of whole painting, make the main hue lighter. I like this kind of strongly emotion showed in the art work.  The style turns brutal of the following paintings, like the lightning tear the ground. Then the next paintings turned colors again, become purple and dark blue. I couldn’t know what was in the painting but I like them.
<br />From this exhibition, I got many inspirations in my mind. I can imagine. anything I like in the paintings. It improves my imagination. I enjoyed this exhibition

Physical activities are a very important part in my life. From doing them I am not only exercise my body, but also make my life richer. 
<br />I have to talk about swimming here, my favorite activity that I usually want to do it. I am a person that not good at over strength sports, like basketball, running, football and so on. I can’t bear too high temperature especially in summer, so swimming becomes a good choice to me. Swimming will exercise your whole body, after swimming each of my muscle felt painful that means the fat started to burn in your body. Swimming is not an easy sport to learn. The memory of swimming started when I was in primary school. I was six years old at that time, just a little girl. I was afraid of to put my head down into water, I thought I couldn’t breathe if I do that. I spent such long time to overcome this kind of fear ness and practice every day in the water. I f there was no hard training before; I would not enjoy swimming a lot. If you want to learn something well, you must put effort in. This was like experience to me .
<br />I don’t like the over strength sports, but I still played basketball in PE lessons. I try to challenge myself on my disadvantages. I am not good at basketball but it looks very cool when you play it. I learn it very seriously. The gesture to carry the ball; how to throw the ball to my partner and also different kinds of shoot. It’s difficult for me to shoot the ball into basket very accurately, so I practice it when there was a rest between each PE lesson. I borrow a ball from teacher, went to the area beside the central ground alone started to exercise. I was not tall enough to shoot the ball highly, but I use the skill that teacher taught us. At the last test, I shoot many balls into the basket and got a good mark.
<br />After that, I was not hate basketball anymore. I found out that, if I want to do something well, I can do it well. Firstly we must believe ourselves have the ability to solve these challenges, than we must take actions to do what we want. Never gives up. After a long time you will find out you already can do that.
<br />For swimming we must have the skills to coordinate each part of body, than we can flow on the water. For basket, you must high enough and know the right gestures on shooting use some skills and train it more, you will play it well

I heard many students like to do volunteers there, so I thought it might be an very easy stuff to do, but after I actually did it I changed my thought.
<br />  Before doing the volunteer, the staff of metro station told us about our works. We  need to stand at the exits of station as a guide to help the people with problems and we must wore the red uniform specially for volunteers. We were divided to work at different exits.
<br />  At the beginning time, I was unhappy about to stand at exits alone and I hate the red uniform, it looked very small and stupid wore outside my jacket. Many people passed from me often looked me in a very strange expression like to watch a monster. I felt very uncomfortable, not willing to wear the uniform. The staff at my exits was a helpful young man and we started to talk about this job. I asked him that if they should stand here whole day? He said then would change the turns to work. He also told me that this was a very tired work, they meet different people and solve many problems every day. While he was talking, suddenly an old lady standed outside the exits and try to speak to us “I bought the tickets just now, but the machine had some problems that I can’t enter.” She needed some help. The young man checked her ticket and smiled “No problem, you can enter form here.” He asked me to open the staff entrance, I felt surprised that “No problem to do that?” He said that the lady already bought the ticket, we need to prove hommization service, and everyone was busy so we can help them to save time. It’s our duty to help them. I felt admired to him and also on this job.  
<br />  It was my pleasure and duty to help people in need, so I stand at exits again and watch the stream of people carefully if any people need me. After twenty minutes I saw a girl with heavy luggage stand there worriedly, like looked for some people. I asked if she needed any help. She said she was from other cities and went to Nanjing for jobs with her friend, but she got lost of her friend and she has no cell phone. She almost cried and I felt I should help her. I lend my phone to her, she called her friend. She felt grateful to me and shake my hands. At that time I realized the importance of this job. Whatever at volunteer time or other time in my life, help people it’s always the most happy thing.
<br />  I was proud of this job, and this experience let me know the duty more deeply.

After the exam, our first term parents’ meeting was coming. I became one of the volunteer members to time the teacher when they were talking to parents.
<br />  We were allowed to wear suit and it’s my first time to wear such formal cloth, so my attitude to parents meeting become seriously. We gather at canteen at 12 o’clock, start our work. Firstly we fix up the meeting place, move all the tables and chairs in canteen. This work spent much of my strength as a girl, than we need to stick the pointer paper on the wall that easy for parents to find the location of each teacher. We worked three people a group, find location, cut tape, stick paper. Each person has its work. We finish the work as quick as possible, at about one o’ clock parents meeting began. 
<br />  We wait for teachers in the canteen. Here parents and teachers can have a face to face meeting, students translate for parents. I was the timer for Grade 10 Art teacher, Ms. La. Each parent only have 5 minutes time talk a teacher, for make sure every parent that wait in line would have chance communicated to teacher, we must remind teacher about time. Twenty minutes after teachers and parents start to come. I wait beside the teacher and look at the watch. During the waiting time I watch the meeting between teacher and parent. Some of parents looked worried on their face. They asked teacher very carefully on the marks of their child. Some of parents looked, may be their children got a good mark. I thought if all of us can work hard, our parents can happy every day. The time is over, but the parent seemed didn’t want to stop the meeting. It time for me to notice them. I said to teacher and parent very politely and softly that five minutes were over, hope they can notice the time. Sometimes the parent was not willing to stop, and the next parent always hurried me to notice teacher. On this time I felt hard, but it’s my duty on timing, so I have to stop the meeting.
<br />  I stand there until five o’clock in the afternoon, whole five hours! But that teacher still talked to parents. I felt impatient for waiting, but I thought of my duty, so I had to wait.
<br />  After the parent meeting I felt very tired but this experience let me understand the parents mood, care about their children. So we can do our best let our parents satisfied on us. We also need to be patient enough on our work, until the end we must insist to do our job.
