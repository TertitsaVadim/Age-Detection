Know What Good Posture Is<br /><br />Posture refers to the way human beings maintain their body to sit, stand and lie in accordance with gravity force and keep an aligned position by using various body muscles . <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fshop.intelliskin.net"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://shop.intelliskin.net</a><br /><br />Good posture has several requirements: Normal muscle mobility and strength, flexibility of joints, good strength in the muscle groups responsible for good posture, such as the spinous muscles in the neck and back, and above all, an awareness of one's own posture so that deviations from the normal posture can be recognized. <br /><br />Proper posture not only helps a person to maintain his spinal alignment at optimal level but also lowers the chances of common muscles issues often expected in bad posture case. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fshop.intelliskin.net"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://shop.intelliskin.net</a><br /><br />{2. Contributing Factors to Poor Posture| 2. Factors Contributing to Bad Posture | 2. Factors Causing Poor Posture<br /><br />The factors causing the poor posture can be equal in number to the factors causing the good posture. Examples of these factors can include obesity--where weakened abdominal muscles increase strain on the paraspinous muscles in the mid and lower back--pregnancy, high-heel shoes, diminished overall flexibility, and poor work environments and habits.  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.intelliskin.net"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.intelliskin.net</a><br /><br />3. Understanding the function of posture braces?<br /><br />Most of the over-the-counter, non-prescriptive braces exert their influence on the shoulders and upper back, gently pulling the shoulders back, thus pulling the upper thoracic area into slight extension.  But in most cases such braces usually strap around the upper should area and cover the mid back region in a cris-cross manner.  <br /><br />Some braces provide strong support to abdominal parts in the form of wide covering around the area to create pressure over these organs in a nice gentle manner.  Such type of supports prove helpful at later pregnancy stage to maintain the hyper extension over lumber spinal region. <br /><br />4. Braces Do Not Prove the Best Possible Alternative for Body Mechanics <br /><br />No doubt bracing can be useful in relieving the bad posture strain problems but it can’t be reliable as the best alternative for balanced body posture.  Getting training for proper bending, lifting and stooping can be useful in reducing the chances of normal injuries along with training the muscles to keep the proper posture while doing daily life activities.  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fshop.intelliskin.net%2Fposture-exercises-for-better-posture.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://shop.intelliskin.net/posture-exercises-for-better-posture.html</a><br /><br />Many people needs specific training to understand ergonomics and body mechanism.  Such incentives can help reducing the chances of work related injuries which can cause heavy financial burden over the company they are working in. Proper posture and body mechanics provides an atmosphere for a healthy back, and reduces the chances for early degeneration of the spinal column.<br /><br />5. Exercise and Training Pave the Way for Healthy Back <br /><br />For maintaining a good posture you need to train the muscle of your back and abdominal region.  Posture braces are actually used to train the muscles to act in a coordinated manner to achieve the good body posture.  Posture bracing is helpful in enhancing the spinal column alignment to reduce the chances of irregular muscular tension which can lead towards posture imbalances.<br /><br />There are various exercises are present which can be followed to improve the muscle tone and body posture.  These exercises include the both groups, covering the back and abdominal region. Even with a healthy back, weakened abdominal muscles will put an accentuated amount of stress and strain on the back muscles.

Understand what does good posture mean <br /><br />Posture is the way we humans stand, sit and lie against gravity, all the while maintaining proper alignment of the spinal column by using various muscles. . <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fshop.intelliskin.net"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://shop.intelliskin.net</a><br /><br />Good posture has several requirements: Normal muscle mobility and strength, flexibility of joints, good strength in the muscle groups responsible for good posture, such as the spinous muscles in the neck and back, and above all, an awareness of one's own posture so that deviations from the normal posture can be recognized. <br /><br />Proper posture not only aids in proper spinal alignment, it can greatly decrease risk factors such as back injuries from strains associated with bad posture. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fshop.intelliskin.net"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://shop.intelliskin.net</a><br /><br />{2. Contributing Factors to Poor Posture| 2. Factors Contributing to Bad Posture | 2. Factors Causing Poor Posture<br /><br />The number of factors contributing to poor posture can be equal to the number of factors contributing to good posture.  For example obesity due to which weak abdominal muscles can put strain on paraspinous muscles at lower region, pregnancy, flexibility issues, using high heel footwear and above all poor working conditions and life style.  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.intelliskin.net"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.intelliskin.net</a><br /><br />3. How posture braces can work?<br /><br />Most of the over-the-counter, non-prescriptive braces exert their influence on the shoulders and upper back, gently pulling the shoulders back, thus pulling the upper thoracic area into slight extension. Many of these braces strap around the front of the shoulders and subsequently cris-cross in back, between the shoulder blades.  <br /><br />Some supports the abdominal region in a form of large strap around the waist to press the abdominal parts against internal back muscles to create a support for them.  This type of compression is useful in case of pregnancy when there is a condition of hyper tension in lumber spinal region. <br /><br />4. Braces; Not a Proper Alternative for Body Mechanics <br /><br />While bracing can offer significant relief of back strains due to poor posture, it is not designed to be a substitute for proper body mechanics. Learning to bend, stoop and lift properly not only reduces the chances of injury, it can also serve to help re-educate muscles in proper posturing during work and normal activity.  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fshop.intelliskin.net%2Fposture-exercises-for-better-posture.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://shop.intelliskin.net/posture-exercises-for-better-posture.html</a><br /><br />Some people require proper training for understanding the body mechanism and ergonomics completely. This pro-active stance helps to reduce the potentials for work-related injuries which can be extremely costly to the company.  Training for proper posture not only creates a healthy environment for internal body support but also avoids the early degeneration of spinal column.<br /><br />5. Exercise, Train and Educate Your Way to a Healthy Back <br /><br />Good posture requires training and education of the supportive muscles of the back and abdomen.   Posture braces are actually used to train the muscles to act in a coordinated manner to achieve the good body posture.  Posture bracing is helpful in enhancing the spinal column alignment to reduce the chances of irregular muscular tension which can lead towards posture imbalances.<br /><br />There are various exercises are present which can be followed to improve the muscle tone and body posture.  These exercises comprise the back and abdominal groups.  As even with a strong back you can face stress over back area produced because of these weak abdominal muscles only.

How you stand, sit, breathe and even think.  The only factor behind your posture problems could be your own bad habits. But are you aware of their total influence on your actions? Try the following experiment. <br /><br />1. Fold your arms and note the position of your hands and which arm is on the outside. <br /><br />2. Now unfold them and fold them again but this time the opposite way.  <br />     Note your own feeling by doing this simple experiment. <br /><br />Are you feeling uneasy and odd?  Firstly you folded the arm in the way you naturally do it.  You did it with no thinking as you are habitual to do it.  But what happened at second time? You must have tried it after little thinking.  It might be possible that you have taken lot of attempts to accomplish it.  Actually you were not having an existing pattern for second one that is the reason it seemed awkward to you. It will probably feel wrong because you will not have done it like this before so the sensations from the muscles and joints will be new to you. <br /><br />The important lesson from this experiment is how the two positions feel.  The first position was habitual to you so you did not feel any problem in doing so but for the second you prepared your mind to take a different pose.  It does not mean that there was something wrong but the reason is that you felt it in a different way.  Would you feel same easiness in doing the second as you feel in first one.  That is why what you feel right or wrong is determined by your habits actually. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fshop.intelliskin.net%2Fhow-to-improve-posture.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://shop.intelliskin.net/how-to-improve-posture.html</a><br /><br />So familiar feels right, unfamiliar feels wrong. Here was a moment in your life when you observe people to know how to fold arms instead of folding yourself. So you learnt this behavior by observing others. If you have never folded them the other way around you will never choose to do it this way and probably never cross your mind that it could be done another way.  The way you folded it first time now has become a long term habit in your life. <br /><br />So when you repeat the same position for folding the arms it makes you aware that it is right and makes proper pattern for such position.  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fshop.intelliskin.net%2Fhow-to-improve-posture.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://shop.intelliskin.net/how-to-improve-posture.html</a> how to improve posture<br /><br />Now what about how you stand, sit and walk, your basic actions that you spend every day performing?  These actions also follow the same rule pattern which applies to your arm folding.  You should have no doubt in it. <br /><br />So how you sit at your desk is done in a way you have learnt to do it and it will feel right.  It does not mean that this is the only way to sit but you never tried sitting in other way.  If you did it then tell how did you feel? Can you maintain your new sitting position for long?  Most of people feel uncomfortable for using new set of muscle for new pattern of sitting. <br /><br />So all of us create our bubble to live in but can’t see outside it due to being enclosed. To the snowman inside his dome the weather never appears to change!  How could you rectify the poor habits you have developed in a wrong way? Neck, back and shoulder pain are the most obvious symptoms but how can you accurately identify the cause when the fault lies with the very equipment you would use to diagnose and correct it? <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fshop.intelliskin.net%2Fposture-exercises-for-better-posture.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://shop.intelliskin.net/posture-exercises-for-better-posture.html</a><br /><br />Another thing which does not seem clear apparently is that poor postural habits never let you perform at your full potential.  <br /><br />So if you want to change posture you will need to leave following the way seems right to you.  It’s true that you will feel uneasy to do so but remember that you are going to correct the wrong learning patterns.  So here you need to experience the same feeling which felt during the opposite arm folding to bring a positive changing habit. This is the only way you can be sure you are not engaging your old, poor habits.

How you stand, sit, breathe and even think.  The only factor behind your posture problems could be your own bad habits.  But have you realized how it can influence your actions?  Try the discussed experiment for this issues. <br /><br />1. Fold your arms and note the position of your hands and which arm is on the outside. <br /><br />2. Now unfold the arms to fold them again in an opposite manner.  <br />     Note your own feeling by doing this simple experiment. <br /><br />Are you feeling uneasy and odd?  Firstly you folded the arm in the way you naturally do it.  You did it with no thinking as you are habitual to do it.  But in second step you thought first and did after. It may even have taken several attempts to achieve. This is because you do not have an existing pattern for this movement and it has to be consciously worked out.  It will possible to have an awkward feeling as such position is new to your muscles and joints framework. <br /><br />The important lesson from this experiment is how the two positions feel. Your habitual pattern feels right and is easy to do, your non-habitual opposite way feels wrong and is not quite so easy to do.  It does not imply that second position was wrong itself but your muscles and joints were not habitual to do so. Would you normally choose to fold your arms in this manner?  So here your habits decide what is right for you and what seems wrong to you. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fshop.intelliskin.net%2Fhow-to-improve-posture.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://shop.intelliskin.net/how-to-improve-posture.html</a><br /><br />So familiar feels right, unfamiliar feels wrong.

The same pattern applies to these basic actions as well that apply to the learning of arm folding. Of course they are not. <br /><br />So you sit at your desk according to the learning pattern of your sitting, which seems right to you. There are many ways to sit but would you ever try these out? If you do, how do they feel? Can you maintain your new sitting position for long? People can soon become uncomfortable as they use new muscles for sitting that are normally inactive for sitting. <br /><br />So all of us create our bubble to live in but can’t see outside it due to being enclosed.

You can try the following experiment for such issues. <br /><br />1. You just have to fold your arm to see that which arm is on outside. <br /><br />2. Now just get back to previous position of unfolding and fold again with other arm on outer side.  <br />     Note your own feeling by doing this simple experiment. <br /><br />Does it feel odd or even wrong? In the first step you used your habitual ‘folding the arms’ pattern. You did not have to think about how you did it because you have an existing pattern; it’s automatic and feels right. Did you have to think for a moment before carrying out the second instruction?  It might be possible that you have taken lot of attempts to accomplish it.  Actually you were not having an existing pattern for second one that is the reason it seemed awkward to you.  It will possible to have an awkward feeling as such position is new to your muscles and joints framework. <br /><br />The purpose of this simple experiment was to just make you feel the difference between the two. Your habitual pattern feels right and is easy to do, your non-habitual opposite way feels wrong and is not quite so easy to do. There is obviously nothing wrong with the opposite arm-fold but that is exactly how it will feel.  Would you like to this second position for normal arm folding? What feels right and wrong is therefore determined by habits that may be working for you but also against you. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fshop.intelliskin.net%2Fhow-to-improve-posture.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://shop.intelliskin.net/how-to-improve-posture.html</a><br /><br />So familiar feels right, unfamiliar feels wrong. There was a time when you just watch others folding arms rather than doing it yourself. So you just learnt it in a proper way either with right arm on outside or with left one.  So if you are habitual to do it in one way then it implies that you were having no thought of doing it in an opposite manner. Whichever way you do it first you are likely to become stuck with it; it’s your habit for life. <br /><br />Folding your arms in the same way continues to re-enforce the feeling of rightness whilst creating the set of ‘rules’ for this pattern you will always follow.  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fshop.intelliskin.net%2Fhow-to-improve-posture.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://shop.intelliskin.net/how-to-improve-posture.html</a> how to improve posture<br /><br />Now come to the basic actions of life including sitting, standing and walking. Why should these actions be exempt from the ‘rules’ that apply to your arm-folding habit?  You should have no doubt in it. <br /><br />So you sit at your desk according to the learning pattern of your sitting, which seems right to you. There are many ways to sit but would you ever try these out?  If you ever tried it, what was the feeling? Can you maintain your new sitting position for long?  Majority feel awkward in following the new sitting pattern and using new muscle set for it. <br /><br />So everyman creates his own pattern and can’t observe it directly as other can.  It is just like living in a dome as a snowman with no feeling of change in weather outside. If you develop poor habits relating to movement how would you know?

To the snowman inside his dome the weather never appears to change!  If you learn wrong patterns for movements then how would you be able to rectify it?  You can experience common issues of neck pain, backache and shoulder pain due to these poor habits but it is not easier to detect and correct them properly. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fshop.intelliskin.net%2Fposture-exercises-for-better-posture.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://shop.intelliskin.net/posture-exercises-for-better-posture.html</a><br /><br />Never performing to your full potential is a less obvious symptom simply because if you haven’t been there how do you know if you are underachieving?  <br /><br />So while trying to bring a change in posture you have to leave what you feel right.

So here you need to experience the same feeling which felt during the opposite arm folding to bring a positive changing habit. This is the only way you can be sure you are not engaging your old, poor habits.
