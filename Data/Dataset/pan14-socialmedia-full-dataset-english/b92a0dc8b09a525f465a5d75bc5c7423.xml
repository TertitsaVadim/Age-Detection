I'm one of them...so I was the one who packed my dissecting set and notes very quickly and hopped out of the classroom! My disswecting set is a special ones though...because my set is not in a box but a plastic food container....which i later described it as economic dissection set because it is usually for economic food! After this, we we go to the lab with high hope because today is the day when we have our Dissection experiment. While waiting for others, we looked into the basket where the hamsters were kept. They are very VERY VVVEEERRRYYY cute....and is very active...they play around and swing on the strings! Though, most of them are looking very sick indeed. I reckon this is due to they were kept in the same basket for so long and they fought! After that, teacher show us once about how to dissect it. We picked one each and started. The procedure is very long...so I don't wanna put them here...But mine is very cute and obedient, like a baby...but she is a female, not pregnant! Only two in our class get pregnant hamster...When we found out who get the prenbant ones...most of us just sticked to the table as though the table is magnet and we are steels! And we convinced the person to opened up the plasenta to release the baby hamster ( they gonna die, at the end, so we just wish to learn more). We take it out and you can see its head, eye, ear, legs...so small and so cute...tiny...sigh...don't know how to describe! Though sometimes I feel sad because this is when I found out some success needs sacrifice...If you want to learn...you got to do it as good as you can...I feel sad for my hamster (hamster, hamster, if you are lucky...be in heaven...AMT<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cool.gif" alt=":)" />...but still I have to do it as good as I can...after we determine the digestive system...we are supposed to clean up...but since I done that too early...I was allowed to try dissecting other parts...I tried the head...but I can't find any instrument in my dissection set that can open that skull. so we end up taking photos with our project.
<br /><br />REST IN PEACE, Hamster....

And after weeks I went to my art lesson and work my PIG out! I finally finished that pig! Oh yes, forgot to tell you all, this year's lunar sign is pig, that's why you can see PIGS everywhere this year! And I would like to share my own-made-pig to all of you! It's actually some craft by primary school students. But I felt bored and thinks teenagers also can do something as cute like this...so I asked the teacher whether she would let me have a try....so she allowed...

Due to our school had applied for holidays which we have to place back, we have the whole week free! That sounds good, that sounds exciting, that sounds fantastic, but also...that sounds something else...OUR PROJECT! We are supposed to hand them in before Chinese New Year...Although teacher allow us to pass up one week after Chinese New Year, but in order for a relaxing holiday and also reserving time for STPM studying, my group thought it would be best if we just hand in this week. That's why we are working overtime to complete our work...that's tiring! Thanks to the good old leafs and insects, we have to find their scientific over piles of books, Internet and more! Why we can't get the same insect as seniors? Why our leafs are different from seniors? Things would have been more simple if they are the same! Finally, tomorrow is the last day! Hooray! The project can be said 98% completed...just left some paperwork and gluing....I hope tomorrow the three things would be safely passed onto teacher's hand...

Some think that study group is a group of good old friends sitting together, sharing their thoughts about their study; some think it was about some bright student teaching others; some this...some that...But I never get into contact with that. And recently, since I had moved nearer to school, one of my friends had offer me to join her in studying. I...accepted, but still I don't quite know what should we do in study group...err...is that group? If we are only two person? So I think I should asked around...
<br />But until now, we had three meetings...Each had its own agenda...
<br />Through this activity, I felt some kind of responsibility to study beforehand, because I might need to correct her mistakes, or I have to have my own presentation about certain subjects. And one serious thing is that, in such so-call study group, you share no secrets. I don't hide any information I get about a topic but share with her, through that, she might give you another interpretation towards the data.
<br />I wish to improve the group to be superb and would personally say that I liked that much!

Though, with some celebrations like Chap Go Meh...The school reopen, I collected all my hearts of having fun, and rearrange them into the Heart of Study. Lessons are up, school assignments are piling up as usual, routine for sleeping is shifted from 12-8 into 11-6, just to make sure I will have enough energy and concentration in class. But sometimes, I have to sleep a bit later just because of school work, what a pity...Schoolbags are getting heavier than before...And besides that, school reopen signifies something else! EXAM: The task-to-be-completed! Tomorrow is the start of mid term holiday, but there was nothing like holiday unless you count the hours for us to study are more because the exam is placed just after the holiday! You can just say that the whole week are just extra hours for us to prepare; or you can also say this is the moment the school are sending out sweets because the Christmas is coming earlier. We can't be sad because that's a good chance for us to boost our knowledge, but we can't be too happy because the joy of holiday was totally wiped away...Anyway, I got an extra exam for Music Theory next Monday! Help!!!
<br />I hope I can try my best still...

Here, I want to tell a real life experience.
<br /><br />In my General Study tuition, we are encouraged to read newspaper and jot down anything happened. This is due to this will beef up our general knowledge and language. So, at first, many of us are very very hardworking in reading the news, jotting down, and the week after that will announce on the class so that everyone can share. Then, for the first few weeks, we got loads of news, and large partition is about accidents, robbery and so on. But after time goes on, the news become less and less. And Accidents and robbery is not in our own notes. Although teacher will ask us to jot them down, but noone took notice again. From this, I'm sure, our class is too used to this type of news. Imagine how the rate of accidents had increased until it is just like a normal thing? And what will you think if robbery is just a daily routine?
<br /><br />That's terrible. And instead of showing us human is having civilisations and mordenation, I would like to say, those are only occuring from the aspect of material. From the aspect of morality, we are going downhill.

There are loads of them, both from the movie part and also with the book part! Oh, such a glorious moment, how can I , Harry Potter fan, be sitting right in front of the computer and sit still? My hands are itching...I gotta write and post this!
<br />Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint will be back for the rest of the film, after so many rumours of them might be stop...Oh, glad to see the trios back, I swear! I think their image as the three wizard student is already charring themselves into people's mind, and if there is a change, it is indeed hard to imagine. I can't deny there may be people &quot;dancing&quot; on the road with boards and cards over them bearing the banner &quot;BRING POTTER BACK!&quot; And their fifth film will be well released in the middle of the year, which is quite a relief, because at least I can watch it regardless of exam coming end of this year...one movie do no harm...
<br />About the books, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows will be released in July too! And the cover had just out with Harry Potter in it! And for the banner in the website, it showed Harry and Voldemort standing in a place, sort of a special venue, with hands raised. Don't know what others think, but I thought they are united...hehe...weird idea? And they seems to be summoning something...No doubt, if you want to hear the real stody, rush towards the nearest bookstore for it when it is released. I can't wait for more story about them, Ron and Hermione, Snape and Lupin, Tonks, Harry, and more...Dursley?

I think such a simple word should be sentenced as it is really a long time since I had been active on this blog. The 24 hours seems to be very very short with many kind of thing until I finally have to sacrifice my time over my this very own BLOG!
<br />I don't have much to say now that too many things had happened in this period of time.
<br /><br />There is my school Marching Comp, and Prefects State Marching Comp, school and many. As a student for Form Six, Iam considered to be lazy as I have time to spend in front of this glowing box with so many &quot;windows&quot;. The school however is speeding in breathtaking speed with lessons and activities. Our Biology still have loads to go until we reached our exam this November...Currently we just started the Nervous System...sigh...But we can't blame anyone, because the speed is already quick. Chemistry is racing to finish off the organic, currently just finished hydroxy compunds... and General Study is now in Dasar Luar...Maths...that's actually the most not speeding subject...We just get lessons, homework and we do some revision...
<br /><br />Oh yes, I remembered something, it's quite a news for Form Six student if I have to say. And whether it is good or bad, it depends. We have news that the co-curricullar activities marks for Form Six will be calculated using Lower and Upper Six marks. And for me, that's quite unfair. Because in my school, many positions are taken up by Form 5 student because they too need to apply for matriculation and all that. Besides, our activity only starts in Upper Six because we eneter Lower Six late in the year. And this will give those student who wish to continue to Form 6 a concept that they don't have to be active during Form 1 to 5 because they are not counted. And me and my classmates who had participated so actively in school feel disappointed because all our effort during Form 1 to 5 are just ashes....I wish the policy would be change though....

It's actually a good movie. You know, I can't tear my eyes off the screen when the movie starts. The first two are superb and I think, so are this. It's funny, excited and ...Here, I drew it, one is editted using computer to make it clearer, the other is not...<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/w00t.gif" alt=":)" />

Well, if you know what's it for, I think it's needed much. This is where my bardge prefect meet today, 12.30pm at the Old Town Coffee Shop. We, of course is not as few as this, but sometimes it is hard to gather all the member. They all have their own activities...After this, I think it is even harder to meet again. This is because after this everyone will continue their study in different places and if they goes to work, the working time will be much more different. So, I think everytime we have gathering, it's so precious...

This time, no cameras, no ovr-exitement, but still with my economic dissection set! This time we are really supplied with big fat white mice. They are a lot larger than those hamsters we used last time...So, when we reached the lab, we put our things right and go to watch those mice. Some of them are fierce and tried to bit our fingers off, but some are too scared until they hid in the corner and there are some who knew they must die, so they just slept...Since everyone wish to get the best rat, I just wait behind the crowd until all of them had done with it. Finally, they get their rats and I started to get rid of mine! There are one in the second basket and many in the third one. In the third one, there are few that tries to escape so I think I'm not that expert with animals hence go for the one in the second basket. It should have been too scare as its mate had gone, fainted...So when I go near it, it glued itself against the wall of the basket. I scratch its fur, of course with my gloves on, and then I carried it out. It is very thin...Poor little thing...
<br />Okay, this time we are going to see the respiration things...So I started...and at last, I am almost the only one who didn't miscut the srteries. My friends accidentally cut arteries near its neck and blood just flow out like pipe water...Some are even serious until their dissection baord are flodded with blood, oh dear. Then, of course, their rats died almost immediately...Some more, one of my friend which I think haven't put enough chloroform to her rat, dissect until half way when the rat get awake suddenly. There are chaos in the room because that's the first time...it's quite funny and finally they put the cotton with chloroform on its nose so that it will faint again...And many who take fat mice face their problem because their internals are full with fat, My God! Another one get fats and then, it got a fishball-sized tumour on its liver, oh gosh, it's the first time we saw a mice with tumour! Mine are good, only that I accidentally cut the thymus gland...Since I didn't take cameras, so I don't have photos with it...But today is really another experience...
