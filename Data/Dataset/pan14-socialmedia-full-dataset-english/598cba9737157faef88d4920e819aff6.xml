<br />That when she sees you
<br />Her heart brakes again
<br />Why is it
<br />The tears start to swell

<br />When she’s alone
<br />She just sits and cries
<br />Why is it
<br />You’re the only thing

<br />Why is it

<br />For you this way
<br />No need for sorrow
<br />Or any saddens
<br />What once was
<br />Will not be again
<br />This is the end
<br />Of a rode
<br />That once had beauty
<br />But now is cold
<br />A biter frost 
<br />As covered all
<br />And has left us to fall
<br />But you should be fine
<br />For what was shared
<br />Should not have been
<br />It was my fault
<br />For what was lost
<br />And the time that was wasted
<br />I am the one to blame 
<br />For the end
<br />And for the frost
<br />So do not worry
<br />And do not fret
<br />For none of this you did
<br />I brought this to myself
<br />Bringing you with me
<br />And now I must pay
<br />For what I have dun
<br />You should go on 
<br />And live your life
<br />With me far from your mind
<br />I will be fine
<br />All I really need it time
<br />I’m not sure how long it will be
<br />Maybe even an eternity 
<br />But I will be fine….
<br /><br />this is a poem, for someone that i really did care about..and to say the truth i think the first and  only guy i will truly love...hope you like it

<br />And may not be again
<br />A love that was shared
<br />But should not have been
<br />Two sides of a whole
<br />That did not fit
<br />A path so clear
<br />Now covered in fog
<br />She says good-bye
<br />Because she now knows
<br />That the love that was shared
<br />Should have been left
<br />To save him and her
<br />This painful death
<br />Both side must go
<br />There suppurate ways 
<br />There is no ease 
<br />And there is no way
<br />To say good-bye
<br />To what they had
<br />And what could have been
<br />But in the end
<br />She was overcome 
<br />By who she was
<br />And what she could not say
<br />What her  fears where
<br />And how lost she was
<br />In a land unknown 
<br />To get so close
<br />Was hard to do
<br />But she did really love you
<br />It might not have seemed 
<br />That this is true
<br />But all she did 
<br />Was care for you
<br />So now she must go
<br />The other way
<br />To save herself
<br />From another day
<br />From love and the los
<br />That she feels 
<br />Because of you
<br />Yet there is no fault
<br />To be put on you
<br />For she knows you are true
<br />This is her doing
<br />And hers alone
<br />She wishes to fix
<br />What she has broke
<br />But it seems 
<br />That what needs to be fixed
<br />Dos not want to be
<br />But she will still try
<br />For it was her doing 
<br />That all is not lost

<br />The love of war
<br />What was said
<br />Its really true
<br />That love and war
<br />Go hand in hand
<br />With all the intensity
<br />And all the will
<br />They are the same
<br />The love of one
<br />Can make a war of heart
<br />The love of two
<br />Is a battle over you
<br />Both look different
<br />Love and war
<br />But the passion put forth
<br />Is the same
<br />It can not be taken
<br />But can be gained
<br />In both there is casualties
<br />In war some die
<br />In love some bleed
<br />Though not seen
<br />And rarely thought of
<br />Love is a war
<br />In its self
<br />There are those who win
<br />And those who lose
<br />There is loss and gain
<br />Like cat and mouse
<br />Back and forth 
<br />The power tilts
<br />From one hand to the other
<br />Love is a war
<br />Fought everyday
<br />By you and me
<br />A battle still fought
<br />Long after we are gone
<br />Love is a war
<br />That will not end
