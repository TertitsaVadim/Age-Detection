Duffy was rational and reasoned, asking tough, fair questions, witnesses said. Only, the answers weren’t clear to Duffy, nor many of the agents in the conference room at the Beverly Hilton.<br /><br />Finally, Duffy lamented that the meeting was ending and the union’s strategy to combat ownership in the collective bargaining talks was still hazy to him. What are we doing here?<br /><br />This was when NBPA tempers flared, witnesses said, and union vice president  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nikekin.com%2Fnike-air-force-1-womens-c-78_81.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.nikekin.com/nike-air-force-1-womens-c-78_81.html</a> let loose on the agent - and indirectly - the dozens more in the room. Tension had been building between agents and union officials, and Evans offered a window into the union’s frustration with the challenges and second-guessing from agents.<br />“Evans went on and on about how the agents always want to tell [the union] what to do but don’t have any suggestions on how to make things better. Then Duffy would start to explain in a calm manner what he meant, and Evans kept interrupting him, cursing…”<br /><br />“Just a mess, ” another agent in the room said.<br /><br />It didn’t matter that the union had enlisted Kobe Bryant <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nikekin.com%2Fnike-air-max-247-womens-c-137_139.ht"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.nikekin.com/nike-air-max-247-womens-c-137_139.ht</a>  for a pep talk to the players later that day, many left like they had in several other cities on the union’s tour: angry, beleaguered and feeling like the union is on a death march to defeat. The NBA and the Players Association are meeting on Wednesday and Thursday in New York, and everyone agrees: the next seven to 10 days will determine so much about the outcome of this lockout. Either the owners will get serious about making a deal, or wait for the players to start missing paychecks in November and December, and ultimately try to get them to take a one-sided deal with the cancellation of the 2011-12 season looming.<br /><br />Most of the major NBA agents have told Yahoo! Sports they wanted to decertify the union and file an antitrust suit against the league. Hunter resisted those advances, wanting to see his unfair labor practice charges against the NBA through the National Labor Relations Board, and fight commissioner David Stern at the negotiating table.<br /><br />“We all know how this ends, ” one agent said. “It ends like all the others have - with us giving back everything. Billy had a chance to get out ahead with decertification early on, like [DeMaurice] Smith did with the NFL. Now, if it happens, he won’t be able to take the lead on it. ”<br /><br />For the agents, decertification throws the fear of an unfavorable court ruling into the owner’s minds, and, perhaps, motivates them to become more reasonable, more concessionary, in the labor talks. This week will test Hunter’s mettle, because if the NBA doesn’t come back with a serious, new proposal, what does he do? Keep offering more concessions, negotiating against himself? He’s insisted that won’t happen. Soon, the question will be simple: Have enough players banked enough money to wait this out, and call commissioner David Stern’s bluff?<br /><br />China isn’t taking NBA players with contracts, the European market is lean, and talks of global and domestic barnstorming tours with star players have been met with a shortage of corporate sponsors to pay the bills. The big-market owners don’t want to lose the season, but the players can’t get them to turn on small- and mid-market peers unless the players are holding together once the paychecks stop coming.<br /><br />Hunter prepared the players for more than two years to take on Stern and the owners, and always talked big in meetings about how he didn’t want to give them back anything. They were always going to give back to the NBA, it was just a matter of how much. That’s why the agents feel like they’re on a death march here, why they wanted to muck it up with decertification. They fear they’re going to lose everything - legitimate free agency, guaranteed contracts and fair compensation for stars who pack buildings, drive TV ratings and win championships.<br /><br />Between the powerbroker agents and the union, tempers flared in August and that will assuredly happen again. It’s September, the negotiating sessions are supposed to real now, and Billy Hunter is in a tough, tough place. It won’t be long until this gets much nastier, until all hell breaks loose. Won’t be long at all.

He gave up six runs over five innings Saturday to get credit for a 10-6 home win over Minnesota.<br /><br />The right-hander’s AL-best home ERA rose from 1. 38 to 1. 87. The Angels have won his last seven starts in Anaheim, with Weaver yielding three runs over 47 innings prior to his outing versus the Twins.<br /><br />Weaver has posted a 4. 74 ERA in winning all three career home starts against the Yankees, allowing two runs over seven innings in a 3-2 victory June 3.<br /><br />New York (87-55) has several hitters who have enjoyed success against Weaver, with Robinson Cano going 6 for 18, Curtis Granderson and Alex Rodriguez each 6 for 17 and Russell Martin 8 for 22. It’s been a different story for Derek Jeter <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.adidasnikeshoe.com%2Fadidas-superstar-2-c-179.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.adidasnikeshoe.com/adidas-superstar-2-c-179.html</a>  (2 for 19), Mark Teixeira <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.adidasnikeshoe.com%2Fnike-blazer-shoes-c-98.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.adidasnikeshoe.com/nike-blazer-shoes-c-98.html</a>  (6 for 26) and Nick Swisher (5 for 23).<br /><br />“I have to establish fastball command and put my offspeed stuff in good locations, ” Weaver told the Angels’ official website. “Obviously that’s always the challenge, especially against a team like the Yankees with all their weapons. ”<br /><br />Weaver is 6-0 with a 1. 83 ERA over his last 10 home starts.<br /><br />The Yankees have a slim lead over Boston in the AL East but are in commanding position to at least gain the wild-card berth.<br /><br />The Angels (78-65) will likely have to win the West to gain a postseason berth. They trail Texas by 2 1/2 games.<br /><br />New York won two of three in both previous series against Los Angeles this year. Granderson and Cano have combined for seven homers and 14 RBIs in the season series.<br /><br />The Angels had Thursday off after beginning a nine-game homestand with a 4-2 mark.<br /><br />The Yankees were scheduled to have an off day to travel to the West Coast but lost 5-4 in 10 innings at Baltimore in a makeup game Thursday. That contest began a 10-game road trip that includes New York’s only remaining off day next Thursday in which it will be traveling from Seattle to Toronto.<br /><br />“My concern is that they don’t get over fatigued, ” manager Joe Girardi said. “That’s when you worry about injuries. Without the off days, you can’t give them a day. You have to pick a day. ”<br /><br />The Yankees will start veteran Bartolo Colon (8-9, 3. 72), who is 0-3 with a 5. 00 ERA in six outings since his last victory July 30. Colon yielded four runs over 6 1-3 innings Saturday in a 6-4 win over Toronto.<br /><br />The right-hander, who pitched for the Angels from 2004-07 and won the Cy Young Award in 2005, is 1-0 with a 3. 97 ERA in two starts against them this season.

		<document id="dc44304437d76c4500692761cdf5e41c" url=""><![CDATA[Canucks re-sign ‘thrilled to be here’ Victor Oreskovich<br/><br/>VANCOUVER - Victor Oreskovich  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nikekin.com%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.nikekin.com/</a> didn't have a lot of options when it came to the one-year, two-way deal he signed with the Vancouver Canucks <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nikekin.com%2Fnike-air-force-1-"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.nikekin.com/nike-air-force-1-</a>   on Thursday. That's just the way it goes when you're a restricted free agent with no arbitration rights.<br /><br />Not to be mean, but basically it came down to sign or go sell shoes in the mall. And seeing Oreskovich had already explored that last option, his decision was pretty easy.<br /><br />“I really didn't have a lot of bargaining power, ” said Oreskovich, who will make $605, 000 in the NHL and $105, 000 in the minors. “I have to go perform and that’s how it is at any type of job. I have to go perform and earn my money. That's something I respect and something I understand. I'm just thrilled to be back. Hopefully, for many years to come. ”<br /><br />At only 25 with a wealth of raw talent, it's an interesting proposition. But one only he can answer. We've seen a bunch of guys in the past springboard one-year deals into multi-year contracts setting themselves up for life. We've seen a lot more fall off the map, never to play in the NHL again.<br />“Now, don't get me wrong, Victor made great strides last year, ” said Canucks assistant general manager Laurence Gilman. “But he's still a developing player. This is the year to establish himself. ”<br /><br />Oreskovich had three assists in 16 regular season games, but it was during Vancouver's Stanley Cup playoff run where he almost certainly solidified his spot on this year's team. Yes, the Whitby, Ont., native went scoreless in 19 post-season games, but he provided some energy, physicality and wasn't a defensive liability when on the ice. He obviously had the faith of the coaching staff, who played him in 11 of the Canucks’ final 12 playoff games, including all of the seven-game final.<br /><br />It doesn't hurt his chances that Raffi Torres and Tanner Glass  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nikekin.com%2Fnike-air-max-247-"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.nikekin.com/nike-air-max-247-</a> are gone. Of course, there are some new faces in town also looking to take those spots, but it's no secret the Canucks have high hopes for Oreskovich.<br /><br />“When we were making the trade to acquire Keith [Ballard] from Florida, we wanted Victor in the deal, ” said Gilman. “He provides a blend of size and speed and aggressiveness that we feel we need in the organization. ”<br /><br />At 6-3, 225 pounds, Oreskovich is an impressive sight on the ice. But wait until you see him skate. The big-bodied winger moves like a player 30 pounds lighter. The Canucks also like his smarts, work ethic and passion for the game. His hands still need some work, but you try and come back after selling ladies shoes and see how many goals you score off the rush.<br /><br />“It's been a crazy turn of events, that's all I can say, ” said Oreskovich, who is scheduled to arrive in town next week. “From quitting the game and going back to school to being a student, then coming back and being traded to Vancouver and going to Game 7 of the Stanley Cup … I'm just very fortunate and will never take things for granted again. “Especially, playing here in Vancouver, where I'm thrilled to be. I mean it, it's the most fun I've had playing hockey. &quot;<br /><br />Of all the lessons he's learned, maybe the biggest came to him in early summer.<br /><br />“Just thinking back, last year was huge on a number of levels, &quot; he said. “Once we got to the playoffs, we were playing against the best teams in NHL and the most intense hockey and I felt comfortable out there. Yeah, it was a disappointing ending, but I realized it was a big step forward for my growth as a person and a player. ”<br /><br />Oreskovich remains a restricted free agent next season, the only difference being that he will have arbitration rights.

This one was dedicated to the hockey players killed in a plane crash.<br /><br />Wearing black tags on their uniforms, the Russians beat Finland 79-60 on Thursday to advance to the quarterfinals of the European basketball championship.<br /><br />A day earlier, 36 players, coaches and staff of the Lokomotiv Yaroslavl hockey team died when their private plane went down in western Russia.<br />“Yesterday we were crying with the whole world, ” Russia power forward Semen Antonov said. “Rest in peace. ”<br /><br />A minute of silence was observed before Thursday’s games.<br /><br />“Today’s game was very important on two levels, ” said Russia’s American coach, David Blatt. “First, we wanted very badly to qualify and we did that. Secondly and more importantly, we played the game in memory of the hockey team from Yaroslavl. As sportsmen, they are our brothers and sisters. ”<br /><br />“We played the game with passion … and with a way of working hard, demonstrating the qualities of sportsmen that honor their memory, ” he added. “That was what the game was more about than anything else. ”<br /><br />Andrei Kirilenko <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.zozbuy.com%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.zozbuy.com/</a>  led a balanced Russian attack with 14 points.<br /><br />Also reaching the quarterfinals was Macedonia, a small former Yugoslav republic that marked its Independence Day by beating Georgia 65-63.

And nobody mentioned us. ”<br /><br />After a timeout, McCalebb dribbled as the clock ticked down before driving and putting in a left-handed layup for the win.<br /><br />“Everybody in the gym knew they would play pick-and-roll and that McCalebb would drive to the left, and still we couldn’t stop him, ” Georgia coach Igor Kokoskov said.<br /><br />McCalebb, who was born and raised in New Orleans, never played club basketball in Macedonia but led Partizan Belgrade from neighboring Serbia to the Euroleague Final Four. He is now with Montepaschi Siena and also guided the Italian team to the Final Four.<br /><br />Macedonia, looking for a playmaker after injuries to two players, offered him citizenship last year.<br /><br />Georgia (0-3) played without Atlanta Hawks center Zaza Pachulia, who has been ruled out for the tournament because of a left calf injury. The Georgians also lost point guard George Tsintsadze to a left knee injury midway through the second quarter.<br /><br />“They’ve beaten better teams than Georgia, but it’s a tough loss, ” said Kokoskov, an assistant with the Phoenix Suns. “Maybe it’s better to lose by 20. ”<br /><br />/<br />ANKARA, Turkey (AP)-New Jersey Nets <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.zozbuy.com%2FWholesale-Discount-nba-basketball-jerseys_c10.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.zozbuy.com/Wholesale-Discount-nba-basketball-jerseys_c10.html</a>  point guard Deron Williams has arrived in Istanbul to start his stint with Turkish basketball team Besiktas.<br /><br />The Istanbul-based club said the All-Star guard arrived Thursday together with his family.

There, he does some quick stutter steps, breaks this way and that, then hauls in passes thrown by one of the coaching assistants.<br /><br />He doesn’t want the passes thrown right at him, either. “Around the world, ” he calls it-above his head, at his knees, way over here or there. By the end of the day-every day-the goal is to catch 100 passes“It’s just like a jump shot in basketball, ” Gonzalez said. “The more you do it, the better you are at it. ”<br /><br />No one has done it better, not at the tight end position.<br /><br />And amazingly, at age 35 and in his 15th season, the Great Gonzo shows no signs of slowing down.<br /><br />“He’s not old, man, ” Atlanta Falcons teammate <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy56b3pidXkuY29tL1dob2xlc2FsZS1EaXNjb3VudC1uZmwtZm9vdGJhbGwtamVyc2V5c19jNi5odG1s" target="_blank">Michael Turner</a> jokingly told a group of reporters. “He’s fooling y’all. He’s faking that age. He wants to look more amazing to y’all by saying he’s old. ”<br /><br />All kidding aside, it does seem like Gonzalez has turned back the clock, defying his birth certificate and all those who thought he’d surely lost a step, if not two.<br /><br />“I could be biased, ” Gonzalez said, “but honestly, I feel better athletically. ”<br /><br />He’ll get no argument from the Philadelphia Eagles. Last weekend, Gonzalez hauled in seven passes for 83 yards and a pair of touchdowns in a thrilling 35-31 victory, including an early contender for catch of the year. On third down at the 4, Matt Ryan threw one high over the middle, seemingly targeting a fan sitting behind the end zone rather than someone in a red jersey.<br /><br />Not so fast. Gonzalez leaped and thrust an arm toward the roof of the Georgia Dome. The ball stuck in his huge right hand as if drawn by a magnet, his eyes intently watching as he pulled it toward his body. At the same time, he stuck his left foot into the turf, then tapped down his right toes for a split-second before tumbling out of bounds under the goal posts.<br /><br />At real-life speed, it seemed improbable that Gonzalez had actually pulled all that off-within the space of no more than a single second-for a touchdown. He wasn’t sure he got both feet down. The guy in the replay booth wasn’t buying it at all, ordering the referee to take another look at the video.<br /><br />When slowed down, it became clear the ageless tight end had pulled off another catch for the ages. Before the night was done, he’d gone past Terrell Owens for fifth place on the career list with 1, 081 catches. In the next month or so, he should pass Tim Brown (1, 094), Cris Carter (1, 101) and Marvin Harrison (1, 102), as well. That will leave him trailing only Jerry Rice (1, 549).<br /><br />All those guys are wideouts, of course.<br /><br />Gonzalez is already the unparalleled standard for tight ends, a player who helped redefine a position long occupied by hulking, lumbering players, more blockers than receivers.<br /><br />“You can pretty much throw it wherever you want, he seems to come down with it, ” Ryan marveled. “He made an unbelievable catch the other night, but that’s what we’ve come to expect from him. When i work with him in practice and talk to him in meetings, he tells me all the time, ‘If I get this guy in this position, just put it up there and I’ll come down with it. ”’<br /><br />In 2010, there were signs Gonzalez might have finally run into an opponent he couldn’t beat. On a team that won 13 games and captured the NFC South championship, he had 70 catches for 656 yards-a brilliant year for most tight ends, but not by his standards.<br /><br />It was his fewest catches and yards since 1998, his second of a dozen seasons with the Kansas City Chiefs. He had only one year left on his contract, so it was natural to assume this would be the farewell tour of a brilliant career.<br /><br />Hold off on that rocking chair.<br /><br />Gonzalez has made no decision about whether to return for a 16th season. At this stage, he’s just playing it week to week, relishing every moment. His long-term future? That’s something he’ll address at the end of the year.<br /><br />The Falcons will face divisional rival Tampa Bay on Sunday, and the Buccaneers know they’ll have to keep an eye on the old man. In fact, Gonzalez is counting on drawing enough coverage toward the middle of the field to open up things for receivers Roddy White and Julio Jones, who’ve been largely shut down the first two games.<br /><br />Buccaneers coach Raheem Morris compares Gonzalez to a movie that never gets old, no matter how many times you watch it.<br /><br />“‘Stars Wars, ’ that’s who he is, ” Morris said. “The same routes, the same thing he’s going to do. He’s going to run his route, use a legal push-off and he’s going to catch the ball. He’s mastered the art. He developed it, we use it. He’s the best at what he does. No doubt about that. ”<br />Tony Gonzalez ,Michael Turner,Philadelphia Eagles,Matt Ryan,steelers jerseys<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy56b3pidXkuY29tL1dob2xlc2FsZS1EaXNjb3VudC10aW1iZXJsYW5kX2MyNTYuaHRtbA__" target="_blank">l</a>

Deron Williams will be waiting for him.<br /><br />A former New jersey high school standout, Irving will try to help his <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5idXluYmFqZXJzZXkuY29tL2NsZXZlbGFuZC1jYXZhbGllcnMtYy0xNzMuaHRtbA__" target="_blank">Cleveland Cavaliers</a> end a three-game slide Monday night against Williams and the New jersey Nets.<br /><br />Irving leads all rookies with 18. 6 points per game as he plays his first professional game in the Garden State. He became a McDonald’s All-American a few miles from Newark at  St. Patrick High school in Elizabeth, N. J., before spending one season at Duke.

Hartnell and Timonen scored goals in the third period to rally against  a weary Pittsburgh team playing their third road game in four days.<br />“I don’t know if we were trying to be too fancy, but we wore them down at the end, ” Hartnell said. “Good things happen when you put the puck to the net and that happened  tonight. ”<br /><br />Evgeni Malkin and Craig Adams each scored for the Penguins. Sidney Crosby played in the third game of his comeback following a three-month absence caused by recurring concussion  symptoms.<br /><br />The Penguins lost for the first time since Feb. 19.<br /><br />The Penguins also blew their chance to move into a tie with the slumping <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5lYnV5bWFya2V0LmNvbS8_" target="_blank">New york Rangers</a> for first place in the Eastern Conference. One day after losing a shootout in Boston,  the Flyers moved two points behind Pittsburgh and three behind the Rangers.<br /><br />Because of penalties, the overtime featured 3-on-3 hockey. Hartnell ended it with his 35th goal and an even rarer feat—a Penguins loss.<br /><br />There was a playoff atmosphere from the start of the nationally televised game—the first of three between the rivals at the tail end of the regular season. Hartnell and Chris  Kunitz traded blows as part of a multi-player melee in the third, a sign of rising tensions as the postseason nears.<br /><br />“It was a playoff game, ” Hartnell said. “Odds are that we are going to end up with these guys in the first round. We got a point on them tonight. One step closer to getting  home ice. ”<br /><br />Crosby’s presence added some spice to the series and Flyers fans let Crosby hear it early. No. 87 wasn’t even on the ice when a derogatory chant about him was bellowed from  the upper deck. Crosby, long a thorn in Philadelphia’s sweater, was booed the moment he hit the ice for his first shift.<br /><br />The Penguins started the NHL’s longest winning streak of the season without Crosby and could be the team to beat in the East once the Kid rounds into form.<br /><br />Crosby, who had five assists in his first two games back, failed to earn a point and didn’t make an impact against a Flyers team that took two periods to find their groove. But  having him on ice this time of the season is a huge boost to the Penguins.<br /><br />“I just want to make sure that I am getting better and feeling better each game, ” he said. “I think as a group we played really well here in the last few. Most of the time  we’ve done some really good things. We just want to keep building off that. ”<br /><br />The Flyers failed to take a shot in the second until 4: 47 remained in the period, and they went nearly 18 minutes without a shot overall.<br /><br />The Flyers were booed off the ice in the second intermission by their restless fans.<br /><br />It didn’t take long to turn that around. On the power play, Timonen blasted a shot from the point past Fleury for his third goal of the season only 31 seconds into the third to  make it 2-1.<br /><br />Hartnell tied it minutes later when he aimed high on a tough angle shot from the goal line that made it 2-all.<br /><br />“We had to change our attitude and the energy and the motion and the skating, ” Timonen said.<br /><br />Fleury had 25 saves for the Penguins, who wasted a fast start and a chance to keep the winning streak rolling.<br /><br />“During the streak, you probably couldn’t have told our team we were on a streak, ” Penguins coach Dan Bylsma said. “We just picked up and go to the next game. ”<br /><br />Adams tipped in Kris Letang’s shot from the point for his fifth goal and the early 1-0 lead. Malkin made an MVP-caliber move when he took the puck completely around the crease  and slid it under Ilya Bryzgalov’s right leg for a 2-0 lead with 53 seconds left in the second period.<br /><br />Bryzgalov stopped 38 shots and turned away Crosby in the first. Crosby also had a pass intercepted by Flyers defenseman Matt Read.<br /><br />The Flyers improved to 3-1 against the Penguins this season.<br /><br />“We had our fair share of chances, ” Crosby said. “It’s just a matter of executing, but they are a good team and they battled back. ”<br /><br />Notes: The Flyers played without F Max Talbot (undisclosed injury) and D Andreas Lilja (throat). … The Flyers were outshot 40-27. … Flyers F Zac Rinaldo needed five stitches  after Hartnell’s stick accidentally slashed him in the face.<br /><br />Rleated:Scott Hartnell,Philadelphia Flyers,Danny Briere,Marc-Andre Fleury

''That's what I was able to do.''<br />Hamels (3-1) gave up a leadoff double to Willie Bloomquist in the first then retired the next 18 batters before giving up two runs on three hits, a walk and an error in the seventh.<br />''In the seventh he got into some trouble but he got out of it,'' Phillies manager Charlie Manuel said. ''It looked like he lost his command there for a while but he got it back.''<br />The left-hander allowed four hits overall. He struck out seven, including his final three hitters.<br />''When you're about to go out there and just plug away, have some quick at-bats, you do get into a comfortable rhythm,'' Hamels said. ''You want to go out there and have great inning after great inning.''<br />Hamels' single capped a five-run sixth inning. The Phillies won consecutive games to salvage a 5-5 record on their now-completed road trip. Philadelphia also won its first road series of the season.<br />''We're going home 5 and 5, which is better than 4 and 6,'' Manuel said. ''The old saying is if you go .500 on the road and win at home you'll be in the playoffs. I'm not sure I buy it, but that's what they say.''<br />The Diamondbacks have lost seven of nine. Trevor Cahill (1-2) gave up four runs and six hits in 5 1-3 innings.<br />Placido Polanco went 3 for 3 with two walks and scored twice. Carlos Ruiz also had three hits for the Phillies.<br />''We have some really good hitters,'' Hamels said.

Pence hit an RBI single that finished Cahill, Ruiz had an RBI single off Craig Breslow and Hamels looped a two-run single for a 6-0 lead.<br />''Our story today was we were unable to stop that sixth inning,'' said Arizona manager Kirk Gibson. ''Trevor got two guys on and Breslow came in and couldn't get it cut off.''<br />Consecutive one-out singles in the seventh by Aaron Hill, Justin Upton and Jason Kubel ended Hamels' shutout bid. Hamels walked Cody Ransom to reload the bases and Paul Goldschmidt hit what appeared to be an inning-ending, double-play grounder to shortstop, but second baseman Pete Orr dropped a toss and let a run score.<br />Hamels induced another grounder off the bat of A.J. Pollock, which did lead to a double play.<br />''He's throwing 2-0 changeups and locating,'' Gibson said. ''That's pretty tough.''<br />NOTES: Phillies 1B Ty Wigginton had a pinch-hit single in the sixth to extend his hitting streak to 11 games. ... Kubel has hit safely in nine straight and Hill has reached base in 14 games in a row. .
