There may be much focus on trying to eliminate certain behaviors in order to evoke particular responses in children which actually end up rote and repetitive for them without context. One in the goals in aiding these children ought to be in helping them get meaning. In order to do this we must be willing to not look at the child as broken, helpless to respond, or even struggling to communicate. These children ACCOMPLISH communicate, however they are not always able to manipulate their senses to communicate inside typical ways of other children. As a result, they can become quite simply frustrated and trapped. The therapist must enter their imaginative world and figure out how to communicate in their terminology. <br /><br />Dr. Stanley Greenspan gives a good example of a child who initially left for a psychologist who engaged the little one in repetitively placing pegs in the board or looking to find beads hidden under several cups. This was supposed to be a measure of your child's intelligence and abilities nevertheless it proved ineffective. The child constantly hurled the pegs to the floor. A different psychologist took a specialized approach in having mom participate with the child in several interactions. First, the child began grabbing the nose of the mother. Rather than redirecting the little one and seeking to have her refrain from the grabbing, the mother responded which includes a 'toot toot' noise and then allowed her to repeat responding with a new noise. The mother then gently touched the nose with the child and the child to the amazement of the mother smiled and let out a noise, &quot;mo mo&quot;. The little one had indeed communicated playing with her own language. Mom and child had made an actual connection. This showed to the psychologist that this child's cognitive development was within a normal range and here was a young child who wanted to exert some control over the woman's surroundings. Over time, the communication increased, and the mother could have 'pleasurable' discussions using her child that prior had never existed (Greenspan, The Growth with the Mind, 1997, pg. This approach incorporates the use of simple drawings and color to illustrate a continuing communication. This provides additional support to (children) who struggle to understand the quick exchange of information in a conversation (Gray, 1994). An advanced form of the social story is what is termed the 'thinking story'. &quot;Thinking stories demonstrate all of the possibilities as to what people may be thinking once they make certain statements, or once they display certain behaviors... Thinking stories follow a unique, structured format, using picture symbols from Comic Strip Conversations to define and illustrate that abstract concepts covered inside story (Baron-Cohen, 1990, Dawson &amp;amp; Fernald, 1987). The person or therapist while using social story can help guide the little one through and the use of feelings charts can also be a beneficial aid. To accomplish the milestones of a pair of way communication and complex communication, it is important inside sessions that the parents have that they utilize a dialogue while using the child, help guide these phones use their face, attachments, hands, to convey their desires and needs. <br />.<br /><br />[url=]Sindrome de asperger[/url], <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3JvZG5leXBhdHRvbjI0LndlYnNpdGV3aXphcmQuY29tL3NpbmRyb21lLWRlLWFzcGVyZ2VyLmh0bWw_" target="_blank">Sindrome de asperger</a>

Before language development will come, improving the understanding associated with non-literal and non-verbal communications ought to be worked upon. There are 6 main milestones with regard to children: self regulation and a fixation with their surrounding world; intimacy; two way communication; complex communication; emotional ideas; together with emotional thinking. In Greenspan's floor time model the first goal is to encourage attention and intimacy which helps inside further development of the first two milestones. The parent will actively play a period of play therapy engaging the youngster in creative play allowing the little one some direction over the session and taking a fixation with their activities together with providing encouraging feedback. Self-regulation becomes difficult for some children because sensory stimulation may be so overwhelming or their own attention may wander (Greenspan, Fundamental Partnership, pg. 8). Difficulties in intimacy take place because the child struggles to effectively read the cues getting given. Often times the children will have an easier time using adult relationships because adults are usually more able to adjust their cues to the amount of understanding of the child whereas this does not always occur with peers. A part of calling these children and guiding them inside intimacy milestone is to give them opportunities to connect to peers and to have them be ready to relate back what your partner is stating and experiencing. Making use of social stories and role plays can be helpful in aiding the child in understanding the feelings of others and their own feelings. A social story can be a device used where some sort of make believe dialogue is constructed and the child is asked to complete the gaps. &quot;A social story can be a story written to specific guidelines to describe a situation with regard to relevant cues and well-known responses (Gray &amp;amp; Granard, 1993). The use of comic strip conversations can also be employed. &quot;A comic strip conversation is the genuine 'art of conversation'. <br />.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5qYW1iYXNlLmNvbS9GYW5zL0Jsb2dQb3N0LmFzcHg/VU49bHVjYXNob3BraW5zMTIzMCZhbXA7U3RvcnlJRD04MDUwOA__" target="_blank">Sindrome de asperger</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2x1Y2FzaG9wa2luczEyMzAuZG11c2ljLm5ldC9qb3VybmFsLzEyOTg1Ng__" target="_blank">Sindrome de asperger</a>
