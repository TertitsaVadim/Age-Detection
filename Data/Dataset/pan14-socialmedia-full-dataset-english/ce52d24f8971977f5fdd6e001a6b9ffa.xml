<br /><br />Here is the group -- perhaps a lot more than any other -- in which shown Seattle's precipitous decrease right after four sequential National football conference Western championships.
<br /><br />Your Boys directed your Seahawks within Houston inside straight years, underscoring just how much Seattle's lineup eroded towards the end associated with Bernard Ruskell's five-years since president.
<br /><br />The particular Seahawks weren't merely beaten simply by Dallas, these folks were beaten up. Seattle's decrease in Dallas, tx on Christmas supported as a possible epitaph with regard to Robert Holmgren's closing season as mentor. It turned <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5teW5ld2plcnNleXMuY29tL2F0bGFudGEtZmFsY29ucy0yLW1hdHQtcnlhbi1yZWQtYXV0aGVudGljLWplcnNleXMtcC0xMDAxMTc5Lmh0bWw/Y1BhdGg9MTAwMDE2NV8xMDAwMTY3" target="_blank"><strong>Atlanta Falcons #2 Matt Ryan Red Authentic Jerseys</strong></a> out the very last game Walter Jones took part in as a Seahawk, the final game He Hasselbeck played in which period also it underscored just how undersized along with overmatched the Seahawks ended up.
<br /><br />San antonio trailed 14-0 before that scored a point, never do get the finish zone along with quit 7 carriers for the reason that online game while saving none. Showing up inside a across the country public game, your Seahawks had been totally uncompetitive.
<br /><br />Any kind of ideas which time has been the injury-induced aberration evaporated the following calendar year whenever Rick Mora was presented a new roster that's every bit as inferior. Seattle's 21-point loss at Dallas, tx in November. One particular ended up being the first of four years old highway loss associated with 30 points or even more which calendar year in the tailspin that will wound up precipitating at wholesale prices change on your operation.
<br /><br />It could be silly to look at Sunday's online game along with declared which Washington is here as a genuine competitor. The particular <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5teW5ld2plcnNleXMuY29tL25mbC1qZXJzZXlzLWdyZWVuLWJheS1wYWNrZXJzLWMtMTAwMDE2NV8xMDAwMTgwLmh0bWw_" target="_blank"><strong>Green Bay Packers Jerseys</strong></a> Seahawks earned a casino game by which Houston turned the ball over three times inside initial In search of min's plus a punt clogged and also returned to get a landing.
<br /><br />However the Seahawks weren't given everything within the lover on Sunday. That they strong-armed the actual Cowboys, flowing with regard to 149 metres upon crime and also authorized 8 meters flowing about security. It had been really amazing, as well as underscored the particular alteration of the team's lineup.
<br /><br />Washington is larger than it has been, and it is designed to acquire wars involving attrition. Your Seahawks are not going to always be bullied by the group just like Texas like we were holding in the closing couple of years involving Ruskell's program because president.
<br /><br />Another point which was the majority of outstanding are these claims game really was a new extension from the second-half development Dallas exhibited last time, any trend that genuinely commenced inside the second half of the Week Nine sport against Dallas.
<br /><br />What I identified many striking hunting back again with the scoresheet via which sport is simply precisely how similar Seattle's second-half performance has been on Saturday when compared with very last year's game, which Washington misplaced 23-13.
<br /><br />So just why did Dallas earn simply by Twenty this year whenever the idea misplaced simply by 10 recently? Turnovers. Tarvaris Knutson has been chosen off three times last year inside Houston, most inside other half.
<br /><br />Provides San antonio showed up? That has got to wait around to be seen, but Seattle's win in Weekend undoubtedly relied since substantial progress against an opponent that not way too not too long ago had been showing what lengths your Seahawks acquired dropped.

<br /><br />Field Yates of ESPNBoston.com reports that the team has released the wide receiver after just two games. Salas didn’t play in either of those games, which should give some idea about why he’s no longer going to be part of the mix at wide receiver for the Pats. The 2011 fourth-round pick was acquired in a trade with the Rams on Sept. 1 that cost the Patriots a 2015 conditional draft choice.
<br /><br />Per Yates, Salas isn’t the only player leaving the team. Running back Lex Hilliard and linebacker Mike Rivera have also reportedly been given pink slips on Tuesday. Hilliard and Rivera played on special teams for the Patriots in the first two weeks with Hilliard also seeing a little action with the offense.
<br /><br />Tight end Kellen Winslow accounts for one of the newly opened roster spots and the team worked out seven players on Tuesday. Wide receiver Brian Robiskie, recently sent packing by the Jaguars, and former Eagles defensive tackle Antonio Dixon were among the players trying to land a job in New England.

But the Giants’ reaction may have.
<br /><br />Lost in the threats/promises from guys like guard Chris Snee to retaliate against the Bucs in the future is the fact that the Giants already have retaliated.
<br /><br />When the Bucs lined up and fired off the ball, catching the Giants by surprise, Giants players started hitting and pulling and otherwise assaulting Bucs players after the play.
<br /><br />Zapruder-quality film of the incident shows center David Baas throwing a forearm to the head of linebacker Quincy Black after the play.  Even worse, guard Kevin Boothe rolls defensive end Adrian Clayborn over and drops a knee into his chest.
<br /><br />Last week, Texans defensive end Antonio Smith was fined $21,000 for kicking the head of Dolphins guard Richie Incognito, whom Smith believed was doing something dirty to his leg.  This week, the league office could be taking some money away from the team that believes (mistakenly) that it was victimized by the Bucs.

<br /><br />Sheesh.
<br /><br />Earlier this week, the Chargers announced that more than 11,000 tickets remained.  It’s unknown how close (or not) the Chargers came to selling enough seats to lift the curtain.
<br /><br />The Chargers eschewed the opportunity to reduce the minimum number of tickets from 100 percent to 85 percent.  If the final number fell within that 85-to-100 percent window, fans <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL215Y2hlYXBnb29kcy51cw__" target="_blank"><strong>cheap nfl jerseys</strong></a> in San Diego have every right to be miffed.
<br /><br />But not nearly as miffed as they’ll be when the Chargers move to another portion of Southern California.

<br /><br />Heyward-Bey was trying to catch a pass in the end zone between two Steelers defensive backs when he got caught with a shot to the head from safety Ryan Mundy. Heyward-Bey went down to the turf and remained there for several minutes while the medical team immobilized Heyward-Bey and put him onto a stretcher and cart to leave the field. We can’t know what might be wrong with Heyward-Bey at this point, but the reaction is definitely one of a team worried about a serious head and/or neck injury.
<br /><br />Heyward-Bey gave a thumbs up to the crowd on his way off the field, which is a great sign in terms of having movement in his upper extremities. He could also be seen talking to the medical personnel riding out on the cart with him.
<br /><br />There was no flag on the play despite the obvious shot to the head of a defenseless receiver from Mundy, incidentally.
<br /><br />It remains 31-21 early in the fourth in Oakland.

<br /><br />Per a league source, Stafford has a hamstring issue. For now, the expectation is that he should be OK.
<br /><br />As of Sunday, it wasn’t clear whether Stafford had an injury to his hamstring or, yes, his butt muscle.
<br /><br />Since the Lions likely won’t be saying much about Stafford’s status, it’ll be important to watch the injury reports as the week unfolds, in order to know whether and to what extend Stafford will be limited in his preparation for Sunday’s game against the Vikings.

<br /><br />The public animosity began when LeSean McCoy tweeted that Umenyiora was soft, overrated and just the third-best defensive lineman on the Giants. Umenyiora responded by calling McCoy “she” and “Lady Gaga” before moving on to “Twitter gangster.” Things died down for a while, before Umenyiora reopened things by wishing McCoy a “Happy Mother’s Day” in May of this year.
<br /><br />In an interview with ESPN, via Ralph Vacchiano of the New York Daily News, McCoy said that he wanted to respond to Umenyiora at the time but refrained because he was working on his contract extension and coach Andy Reid asked him not to say anything back to Umenyiora. McCoy got that deal done and now he’s decided to get things going again ahead of this week’s game against the Giants.
<br /><br />“Now that that’s over I can let you know how I really feel,” McCoy said. “Osi, to be honest, he is a good player. I think he thinks he’s better than what he really is. I think he’s a ballerina in a Giants uniform, but other than that that’s all I got to say about Osi.”
<br /><br />McCoy also had some words for anyone who thinks that this is just a little game between two players who really don’t have any hard feelings toward one another.
<br /><br />“I don’t know how he feels. He might think it’s a game, but I don’t play them type of games,” McCoy said. “So every time on the field I would say stuff to him like ‘You is a bum … You are the third best defensive lineman on the defense.’ Which I didn’t lie. Wait, I did lie. He’s the fourth now, so I actually did lie.”
<br /><br />Umenyiora responded without much bombast, but it doesn’t take much reading between the lines to see the dig at McCoy and the Eagles.
<br /><br />“I might be a ballerina in a Giants uniform,” Umenyiora said. “I’m lucky I got the contract. I’m lucky to be playing 10 years in the league, to have won two Super Bowls. All that is pure luck and I’m happy for him, I’m happy he got his contract and I’m happy everything is working out well for him in Philadelphia.”
<br /><br />McCoy’s got five more days to throw some more fuel on the fire before he and Umenyiora take the field on Sunday night.

<br /><br />Tynes’ field goals ranged from 27 to 49 yards in length, and he single-handedly accounted for 18 points as the Giants defeated the Panthers 36-7.
<br /><br />Tynes has converted all ten of his field-goal tries on the season and is eight-for-eight on PATs.
<br /><br />So, he’s been a pretty good fantasy option.

<br /><br />The Rams announced that they have been awarded tackle Joe Barksdale off of waivers from the Raiders. Barksdale was waived on Wednesday <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5iZXN0bmV3amVyc2V5cy5jb20vRGFsbGFzLUNvd2JveXMtLTk0LURlTWFyY3VzLVdhcmUtMjAxMi1Qcm8tQm93bC1ORkMtSmVyc2V5LTE3ODcwLw__" target="_blank"><strong>Dallas Cowboys #94 DeMarcus Ware 2012 Pro Bowl NFC Jersey</strong></a> when the Raiders signed defensive end Andre Carter and the Giants also put in a claim for his services, according to Jenny Vrentas of the Newark Star-Ledger.
<br /><br />Barksdale, a 2011 third-round pick, played in all 16 games as a rookie but didn’t seem to enjoy the favor of the new coaching staff put in place by Dennis Allen and General Manager Reggie McKenzie. Barksdale was inactive in all three games this season before Oakland decided to give him the same parting gift that they gave cornerback DeMarcus <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5odWZmaW5ndG9ucG9zdC5jb20vMjAxMi8wOS8yNy9odW1hbi1idXRjaGVyeV9uXzE5MjA0NDAuaHRtbD91dG1faHBfcmVmPXdvcmxkJmFtcDtpcj1Xb3JsZA__" target="_blank"><strong>The World's First 'Human Butchery'</strong></a> Van Dyke, their other third rounder picked last year.
<br /><br />The Rams are without left tackle Rodger Saffold for the next few weeks thanks to a sprained MCL and Wayne Hunter, his replacement, has been limited in practice both days this week with a knee injury of his own. Given the combination of injury and ineffectiveness across the entire line, Barksdale should be able to find his way into the St. Louis lineup at some point this season.

<br /><br />(Granted, sources said the same thing about Darrelle Revis’ “mild concussion” earlier this year, which cost him a game).
<br /><br />Cribbs was knocked out last Thursday when Ravens linebacker Dannell Ellerbe put a shoulder into his helmet, which then flew off before his head slammed to the ground. He walked off the field, but didn’t return to the game.
<br /><br />His absence left the Browns thin at receiver, as Mohamed Massaquoi (hamstring) and Travis Benjamin were also held out. There were no details on Benjamin’s absence, though he had his knee wrapped last Friday. Tight end Alex Smith (concussion) was <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5iZXN0bmV3amVyc2V5cy5jb20vTmlrZS1JbmRpYW5hcG9saXMtQ29sdHMtLXM1NDYv" target="_blank"><strong>Nike Indianapolis Colts Jerseys</strong></a> also out, leaving them short on receiving weapons.
<br /><br />“We’ll have to see,” Browns coach Pat Shurmur said of making a move. “We’ll make the roster as good as we can make it. We’re going to put the guys on the field that can play and give us the best opportunity to win.
<br /><br />“If we’ve got use three tight ends, if we’ve got to use two receivers, whatever the combination is, we’ve got plenty of plays and a lot of ideas and we’ll put the guys out there that will give us the best chance to win.”

<br /><br />And the Unitas family doesn’t mind a bit.
<br /><br />Joe Unitas, the son of the legendary Colts quarterback, posted a letter to Brees on his Facebook page (via the Baltimore Sun):
<br /><br />“Drew, I wanted to take a minute to congratulate you on tying my father’s record for most consecutive games with a touchdown pass. I’ve been follow your pursuit of the record since last season. I’m a big fan of yours, and wish you the best  Sunday night against San Diego as you try to break the record. My father always said that records were meant to be broken. I know that if he was still with us that he would wish you the best as well.
<br /><br />“When I look back on my father’s life I remember a man who was much bigger  than the game of football. The things he would appreciate most about you have nothing to do with football; it’s about who you are as a person. You’re a role model for today’s youth, a family <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5iZXN0bmV3amVyc2V5cy5jb20vTmlrZS1TYW4tRnJhbmNpc2NvLTQ5ZXJzLXM1MzIv" target="_blank"><strong>Nike San Francisco 49ers</strong></a> man, and a humanitarian who cares for his community.
<br /><br />“My father would tell you these are the important things in life, not some record in a book. Continue to be a leader for your team and the City of New Orleans. You’re a great quarterback but even better man. Stay healthy and safe this week and in the future. My family and I will be watching Sunday night cheering for you. Best of luck.
<br /><br />“Sincerely, Joe Unitas”
<br /><br />The record Unitas set is amazing, as has Brees’ pursuit of it. The Unitas family’s gracious response to his attempt is impressive as well.

<br /><br />When someone pops up later in the week, it’s troubling because there’s so little time left for the injury to resolve itself. That’s doubly true when it is your starting quarterback, so those in South Florida are forgiven if they’re a little bit concerned about the Dolphins offense right now. Quarterback Ryan Tannehill made an appearance of Friday’s injury report with a thumb injury.
<br /><br />It’s not known when or how Tannehill injured himself, although fearful hearts should be calmed a bit by the fact that Tannehill is listed as probable for Sunday’s game against the Bengals. Tannehill is coming off a monster performance with 431 passing yards against the Cardinals and his first four weeks have provided a fair amount of evidence to support Miami’s decision to make him a first-round pick this spring.
<br /><br />They might need him to put up another huge passing day this week with the news that cornerback Richard Marshall will be sidelined by a back injury this weekend. Marshall’s absence leaves Nolan Carroll as the likely starter across from Sean Smith, although Carroll <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5iZXN0bmV3amVyc2V5cy5jb20vQ2hpY2Fnby1CZWFycy0tMzQtV2FsdGVyLVBheXRvbi1CbGFjay1Vbml0ZWQtU2lkZWxpbmUtSmVyc2V5cy0xNTg3Ni8_" target="_blank"><strong>Chicago Bears #34 Walter Payton Black United Sideline Jerseys</strong></a> also missed practice time this week with an Achilles injury. He’s listed as probable, but a flare-up could leave the Dolphins reliant on Jimmy Wilson and R.J. Stanford.
<br /><br />While they’ll surely take that over any serious injury to Tannehill, they’d probably most prefer not having to make such a choice at all.

<br /><br />He may be trying to fill it with Browns rookie Trent Richardson. Richardson suggested this week that the Browns might have success running the ball on the Giants if they are able to effectively block New York’s defensive linemen during Sunday’s game at the Meadowlands. Umenyiora responded to this fairly bland comment Friday by telling Richardson he was welcome to try and find something sweet on the ground.
<br /><br />“If (Trent) looks on tape and he thinks he sees some candy, come try and get it,” Umenyiora said, via Ebenezer Samuel of the New York Daily News.
<br /><br />It’s not quite the gender confusion that marked Umenyiora’s jabs at McCoy, but you can understand why the man might want to switch things up a bit.
<br /><br />The Giants surrendered plenty of candy to the Eagles last week as Philly rolled up 191 yards on the ground en route to their 19-17 win. The Giants will be playing without defensive tackle Rocky Bernard this Sunday, which will force Umenyiora and his mates to do a little more than usual in order to keep Richardson from satisfying his sweet tooth.

<br /><br />A bad outcome on what happened to Adrian Peterson on the second play of Sunday’s win over the Titans, for example.
<br /><br />“The second play of the game I got my ankle rolled up and I was out of whack,” Peterson said, via FOXSportsNorth.com. “I was thinking about it too much. It was tender. I just had to come in in the second half and get some tape and adjust and refocus. I came out and did all right in the second half, but I just got to do better.”
<br /><br />Peterson returned to run seven times for 53 yards in the second half, which indicates the Vikings avoided that bad outcome. Coach Leslie Frazier confirmed it on Monday, telling the media that Peterson suffered a mild ankle sprain and, via Tom Pelissero of ESPN1500.com, “should be fine going forward.”
<br /><br />Peterson’s return has been a huge success through five games. He’s averaging 84 yards per game, his knee has responded well to a full workload and the last thing he needs is another nagging injury that would slow things down. It didn’t seem to be so much <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5iZXN0bmV3amVyc2V5cy5jb20vQmFsdGltb3JlLVJhdmVucy1zMTUxLzE_" target="_blank"><strong>Baltimore Ravens jerseys</strong></a> as a speed bump on Sunday, which is good news for the Vikings.
<br /><br />The news is less clear on receiver Jerome Simpson, who will have an MRI after experiencing weakness in his legs on Sunday. Frazier doesn’t expect Simpson to be out long, but the test results will provide the final diagnosis.

Jacobs said that he spoke with coach Jim Harbaugh, who seemed to be itching for a problem to deal with earlier this week, a couple of times in the last two days and that he no longer feels it is important for him to be on the field against Where <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2xhdGluby5mb3huZXdzLmNvbS9sYXRpbm8vcG9saXRpY3MvMjAxMi8wOC8wMi93aGVyZS1taXR0LXJvbW5leS1hbmQtYmFyYWNrLW9iYW1hLXN0YW5kLW9uLWtleS1pc3N1ZXMv" target="_blank"><strong>Mitt Romney and Barack Obama Stand on Key Issues</strong></a> the Giants.
<br /><br />“We ironed it out,” Jacobs said, via Matt Barrows of the Sacramento Bee. “We got it done. I understand where coach is coming from. Coach understands me with him playing football and understanding the athlete and the competitive nature of wanting to get out and help the team win. And not only that, against a former team. But in this case, the former team isn’t important. What’s is important is the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5iZXN0bmV3amVyc2V5cy5jb20vTmlrZS1NaWFtaS1Eb2xwaGlucy1DdXN0b21pemVkLUdhbWUtVGVhbS1Db2xvci1HcmVlbi1KZXJzZXktMjkzNjMv" target="_blank"><strong>Nike Miami Dolphins Customized Game Team Color Green Jersey</strong></a> long run.”
<br /><br />Jacobs also said that he while he could play right now, he no longer thinks that it would be smart for him to do so because he would rather be 100 percent healthy when he makes his return. Jacobs had a habit of expressing disgust or frustration with things during his time with the Giants only to do a similar backpedal a short time later. It would seem that we can put this into that category and move back to looking forward to seeing the Giants and 49ers play instead of listening to them talk.

The Patriots are vague and noncommittal without fail when it comes to injury situations, so this is no departure from their standard operating procedure.
<br /><br />Hernandez is listed as questionable on the Week Six injury report. He was limited in Wednesday and Thursday’s practices, but did not practice on Friday.
<br /><br />According to Jeff Howe of the Boston Herald, though, Hernandez’s travel bag was all packed up on Friday to make the team flight to Seattle for Sunday’s clash with the Seahawks. Howe suggests Hernandez was held out of Friday’s practice because the Patriots’ practice field was wet, and he’s trying to come back from a tricky ankle injury.
<br /><br />Howe also surmises that Hernandez could be available for a limited role at Seattle.
<br /><br />We’ll have more updates in Hernandez on Sunday. For now, it looks like his status could go either way. The Patriots may not decide whether to let Hernandez play until a pre-game workout to see how he’s getting around.

<br /><br />Although Lions coach Jim Schwartz was coy today about whether Best would be ready to play again, Lions General Manager Martin Mayhew later released a statement saying that medical experts had told Best and the Lions that it is still not safe for him to play.
<br /><br />“After today’s consultation with medical experts, including representatives from our medical and training staffs, it has been determined that Jahvid will not be permitted to return to play at this time,” Mayhew said. “Throughout this entire process we always have placed the highest priority on what is best for Jahvid from a health and safety standpoint. While today’s decision is disappointing from a football perspective, we fully and entirely respect and support this recommendation. Jahvid will continue to work with our medical and training staffs with the hope that he ultimately will be cleared  to the playing field.”
<br /><br />Although the statement expresses some optimism that Best will play again some day, at this point it has to be considered an uphill battle for Best ever to play football again. The 23-year-old Best, who suffered a very serious concussion in college and suffered two concussions last season, may have played his last football game.

When 49ers linebacker Patrick Willis heard that Millen criticized him, he wasn’t happy.
<br /><br />Millen said on 95.7 The Game in San Francisco that he thought Willis and 49ers linebacker NaVorro Bowman had the worst game he had ever seen the two of them play on Sunday. Willis later went on the same radio show, heard the same comments, and said Millen doesn’t know what he’s talking about.
<br /><br />“Whoever this Matt Millen guy is, I’d like to ask him if he could do what we do every day and do what we do for 16 games a year and see if he can hold up every game,” Willis said, via SportsRadioInterviews.com. “I doubt he would. I doubt he would be able to consistently play at a high level as Bowman and I do. I really don’t care about what this guy has to say.”
<br /><br />Now, it’s easy to rip Millen after his disastrous stint running the Lions, and believe me, I’ve ripped Millen plenty myself. But the reality is Millen did, in fact, play linebacker in the NFL at a high level. So Willis is wrong when he says Millen couldn’t do it. If Millen ever criticizes an NFL general manager for drafting too many bad wide receivers with Top 10 picks, that G.M. will be justified in saying Millen has no room to criticize. But Willis is wrong to suggest that Millen doesn’t know what he’s talking about when it comes to playing the linebacker position.
<br /><br />Still, Willis may be right to think that people were too quick to jump off the 49ers’ bandwagon this week.
<br /><br />“We went in and everybody is on your bandwagon when you are playing good,” Willis said. “Everybody has everything positive to say and when you don’t do well, they got everything critical to say. For us, we are going to continue to do the things we need to do and that’s play football. Every game is not going to be a perfect game. Every game is not going to be your best game.”
<br /><br />What the 49ers need to do now is play one of their better games on Thursday against the Seahawks. If they do, they’ll be back to being clear favorites in the NFC West, and Sunday’s loss to the Giants won’t sting quite so badly anymore.

<br /><br />The first one came in Week Three against the Colts.  He was cleared to return in Week Four, and he sustained another concussion against the Bengals.
<br /><br />Robinson missed the Week Five loss to the Bears.  Even with the bye week, Robinson did not participate in practice on Wednesday <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5sYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL2xhLW1lLXN0ZXZlbnMtMjAxMjEwMTcsMCwxOTY4MjE3LnN0b3J5" target="_blank">Slain Ambassador Stevens remembered by family and politicians</a> due to the concussion.
<br /><br />Robinson won’t return until he’s cleared by an independent neurologist.  After the first concussion, he possibly was cleared too quickly.  After the second concussion, it’s taking more time, as it should.
<br /><br />Hopefully, regardless of when he’s cleared to return, Robinson will be OK.

<br /><br />We reported on Tuesday that Graham was expected to be in the New Orleans lineup despite an ankle injury, but Wednesday’s practice came and went without Graham getting on the field. That obviously nudged the needle toward the negative on Graham’s chances of playing against the Buccaneers.
<br /><br />The needle moved in the other direction on Thursday. Graham was on the practice field in a limited fashion, raising hope that the Saints will have him available as they try to keep climbing out of the 0-4 hole they dug for themselves. Larry Holder of the New Orleans Times-Picayune reports that interim coach Aaron Kromer said Graham does not need to practice fully in order to play in this week’s game, which should mean we go down to the last minute when <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL29ubGluZS53c2ouY29tL2FydGljbGUvU0IxMDAwMDg3MjM5NjM5MDQ0NDg2ODIwNDU3ODA2NDk3MjY4MjM0NDc4Ni5odG1sP21vZD1XU0pfV1NKX1VTX05ld3NfMw__" target="_blank">Poll: Obama Leads in Wisconsin, Iowa</a> it comes to Graham’s status.
<br /><br />Kromer also said that the decision about whether linebacker Jonathan Vilma will go down to the wire. That particular wire is a bit earlier in Vilma’s case as the Saints would need to put him on the active roster on Saturday afternoon in order for him to play on Sunday.

<br /><br />Kindle, the Ravens’ first selection in the 2010 NFL draft, was waived on Saturday to make room on the 53-man roster for Terrell Suggs. But now that Kindle has cleared waivers and become a free agent, the Ravens are bringing him back for the practice squad.
<br /><br />Ravens coach John Harbaugh said at his press conference today that the Ravens were optimistic that Kindle would be back, and Jason La Canfora of CBS reported this afternoon that Kindle is, in fact, signed to the practice squad.
<br /><br />Kindle missed his entire rookie year after he suffered a fractured skull in a fall just two months after the Ravens drafted him, and since getting cleared to play in 2011 he’s been a major disappointment, appearing in just three games. But the Ravens are still holding onto some hope that he can do something in Baltimore, and the practice squad is his last chance to prove that he wasn’t a complete waste of a second-round draft pick.

<br /><br />It will probably be Friday at the earliest before we find out anything concrete about Graham’s status, but the early signs are better than they were last week. Graham’s injured ankle was well enough that he was able to practice on a limited basis for the Saints on Wednesday, something he wasn’t able to do a week ago. Graham did practice on Thursday, but he wound up being <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5iZXN0bmV3amVyc2V5cy5jb20vTmV3LU9ybGVhbnMtU2FpbnRzLTgwLUppbW15LUdyYWhhbS1HcmF5LXNoYWRvdy1qZXJzZXlzLTE3NTMzLw__" target="_blank">New Orleans Saints 80 Jimmy Graham Gray shadow jerseys</a> ruled out of the game before the team made its way to Tampa.
<br /><br />Interim coach Joe Vitt said that Graham was able to do “land-based things” during practice and sounded a hopeful note about how Graham looked while he was out on the field.
<br /><br />“He did routes on air (and) looked very, very good,” Vitt said, via Nakia Hogan of the New Orleans Times-Picayune.
<br /><br />How Graham’s ankle responds will be key to his hopes of getting back on the field this week. We’ll keep an eye out for that on Thursday, but this definitely qualifies as a good start to the week for the Saints offense.
