<br />Looking from a window above
<br />It's like a story of love
<br />Can you hear me.
<br />Came back only yesterday
<br />Moving further away
<br />Won't you hear me.
<br /><br />All I needed was the love you gave
<br />All I needed for another day
<br />All I ever knew
<br />Only you 
<br /><br />Sometimes when I think of your name
<br />And it's only a game
<br />And I need you
<br />Listening to the words that you say
<br />Getting harder to stay
<br />When I see you

<br />All I needed for another day
<br />All I ever knew

<br />Only you 
<br /><br />This is gonna take a long time
<br />And I wonder what's mine
<br />Can't take no more
<br />Wonder if you'll understand
<br />It's just the touch of your hand
<br />Behind a closed door
<br /><br />All I needed was the love you gave
<br />All I needed for another day
<br />All I ever knew
<br />Only you 
<br /><br />All I needed was the love you gave

<br />The shadow in the background of the morgue
<br />The unsuspecting victim of darkness in the valley
<br />We can live like Jack and Sally if we want 
<br />Where you can always find me
<br />We'll have Halloween on Christmas
<br />And in the night we'll wish this never ends
<br />We'll wish this never ends
<br /><br />(I miss you miss you)
<br />(I miss you miss you)
<br /><br />Where are you and I'm so sorry
<br />I cannot sleep I cannot dream tonight
<br />I need somebody and always
<br />This sick strange darkness 
<br />Comes creeping on so haunting every time
<br />And as I stared I counted 
<br />Webs from all the spiders
<br />Catching things and eating their insides
<br />Like indecision to call you
<br />and hear your voice of treason
<br />Will you come home and stop this pain tonight
<br />Stop this pain tonight
<br /><br />Don't waste your time on me you're already 
<br />The voice inside my head (miss you miss you)
<br />Don't waste your time on me you're already 
<br />The voice inside my head (miss you miss you)
<br /><br />Don't waste your time on me you're already 
<br />The voice inside my head (I miss you miss you)
<br />Don't waste your time on me you're already 
<br />The voice inside my head (I miss you miss you)
<br /><br />Don't waste your time on me you're already

<br />I laughed the loudest who'd have known?
<br />I trace the cord back to the wall
<br />No wonder it was never plugged in at all
<br />I took my time, I hurried up
<br />The choice was mine I didn't think enough
<br />I'm too depressed to go on
<br />You'll be sorry when I'm gone
<br />I never conquered, rarely came
<br />16 just held such better days
<br />Days when I still felt alive
<br />We couldn't wait to get outside
<br />The world was wide, too late to try
<br />The tour was over we'd survived
<br />I couldn't wait till I got home
<br />To pass the time in my room alone
<br />I never thought I'd die alone
<br />Another six months I'll be unknown
<br />Give all my things to all my friends
<br />You'll never set foot in my room again
<br />You'll close it off, board it up
<br />Remember the time that I spilled the cup
<br />Of apple juice in the hall
<br />Please tell mom this is not her fault
<br />I never conquered, rarely came
<br />16 holds such better days
<br />Days when I still felt alive
<br />We couldnt wait to get outside
<br />The world is wide, to late to try
<br />The tour is over, we'd survived
<br />I can't wait till I get home
<br />To pass the time in my room alone

<br />Het valt me dus op dat er de laatste tijd veel mensen zijn die zich niet lekker in hun vel voelen. Die het niet meer zien zitten, die depri en down zijn.. 
<br /><br />En ik blijf het zeggen: Als je me nodig heb: 
<br />klets tege me aan ,bel me, jank , sms, lach ,scheld ,App ,gil ,mail ,spreek met me af, kom langs.. maakt niet uit. 
<br />En schaam je vooral niet. 
<br />De mensen die me kennen, weten het: ik ben de laatste die raar opkijkt van je verhaal, die je de rug toekeert, of t niet zal begrijpen.. 
<br />Ik heb die shit ook (gehad).. 
<br /><br />Onthoud: 
<br />Het komt zoals het komt, en het word zo mooi als je het zelf maakt.. 
<br />Je bent alleen het beste waard, dus daar moet je ook voor gaan. 
<br /><br />En verder: 
<br />Lees t volgende, neem het in je op, en onthoud het! 
<br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
<br /><br />Wear sunscreen. 
<br /><br />If I could offer you only one tip for the future, sunscreen would be it. 
<br />The long term benefits of sunscreen have been proved by scientists, whereas the rest of my advice has no basis or 
<br />reliable then my own meandering experience. 
<br />I will dispense this advice....now. 
<br /><br />Enjoy the power and beauty of your youth. 
<br />Oh, nevermind, 
<br />you won't understand the power and beauty of your youth until they've faded, 
<br />but trust me in 20 years, you'll look back at photos of yourself ,
<br />and recall in a way you can't grasp now <em>how much possibility lay before you and how fabulous you really looked.</em> 
<br /><strong>You are not as fat as you imagine.</strong> 
<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration:underline">Don't worry about the future,</span> 
<br />or worry, but know that worrying is as effective as trying to solve an algebra equation by chewing bubblegum. 
<br /><em>The real troubles </em>in your life are apt to be things that never crossed your worried mind: the kind that blindsides you at 4pm on some idle Tuesday. (When that happends, call me, i'll be there to help you) 
<br /><br /><strong>Do one thing every day that scares you.</strong> 
<br /><br /><em>Sing.</em> 
<br /><br /><em>Don't be reckless with other people's hearts; </em>
<br /><strong>don't put up with people who are reckless with yours.</strong> 
<br /><br />Floss. 
<br /><br /><em>Don't waste your time on jealousy.</em> 
<br />Sometimes you're ahead, 
<br />sometimes you're behind. 
<br />The race is long,
<br /> and in the end, it's only with yourself. 
<br /><br /><em><strong>Remember</strong> compliments you receive;</em> 
<br /><strong>forget the insults.</strong><span style="text-decoration:underline"></span> (<em>if you succeed in doing this, tell me how)</em>. 
<br /><br />Keep your old love letters;
<br /> throw away your old bank statements. 
<br /><br />Stretch. 
<br /><br /><em>Don't feel guilty if you don't know what you want to do with your life</em>. 
<br />The most interesting people I know didn't know at 22 what they wanted to do with their lives; 
<br />some of the most interesting 40 year olds I know still don't. 
<br /><br />Get plenty of Calcium. 
<br />Be kind to your knees -- you'll miss them when they're gone. 
<br /><br />Maybe you'll marry, 
<br />maybe you won't. 
<br />Maybe you'll have children, 
<br />maybe you won't. 
<br />Maybe you'll divorce at 40; 
<br />maybe you'll dance the funky chicken on your 75th wedding anniversary. 
<br /><br />Whatever you do, <em>don't congratulate yourself too much or berate yourself, either</em>. 
<br /><strong>Your choices are half chance, <span style="text-decoration:underline">so are everybody else's</span></strong>. 
<br /><br /><strong>Enjoy your body:</strong> 
<br />use it every way you can. 
<br /><em>Don't be afraid of it or what other people think of it; </em>
<br /><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">it's the greatest instrument you'll ever own</span>. </strong>
<br /><br />Dance,
<br /><br />even if you have no where to do it but in your own living room. 
<br /><br />Read the directions (even if you don't follow them). 
<br /><br />Do <span style="text-decoration:underline">not</span> read beauty magazines;<strong> they will only make you feel ugly.</strong> 
<br /><br /><strong>Get to know your parents; 
<br /><em>you never know when they'll be gone for good.</strong> </em>
<br /><br /><strong>Be nice to your siblings: </strong>
<br />they're your best link to your past and the people most likely to stick with you in the future. ( love you Lis ) 
<br /><br /><em>Understand that friends come and go</em>, 
<br /><strong>but what a precious few should hold on.</strong> 
<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration:underline">Work hard</span> to bridge the gaps 
<br /><br />geography your lifestyle, because the older you get, the more you need the people you knew when you were young. 
<br /><br />Live in New York City once, but leave before it makes you hard. 
<br />Live in Northern California once, but leave before it makes you soft. 
<br /><br />Travel. 
<br /><br />Accept certain inalienable truths: 
<br />prices will rise, 
<br />politicians will philander, 
<br />you too will get old; 
<br />and when you do, 
<br />you'll fantasize that when you were young, 
<br />prices were reasonable, 
<br />politicians were noble, 
<br />and children respected their elders. 
<br /><br /><strong>Respect your elders</strong>. 
<br /><br /><em>Don't expect anyone else to support you. </em>
<br />Maybe you have a trust fund, maybe you'll have a wealthy spouse, 
<br />but you never know when either one might run out. 
<br /><br />Don't mess too much with your hair or by the time you are 40, it will look 85. 
<br /><br /><strong>Be careful whose advice you buy, <span style="text-decoration:underline">but be patient with those who supply it.</strong></span> 
<br /><em>Advice is a form of nostalgia; </em>
<br /><br />dispensing your life is a way of wishing the past from the disposal--wiping it off, painting over the ugly parts, and 
<br />recycling it for more than it's worth. 
<br /><br />But trust me,ive you need me, I'm the sunscreen.
