<br />by Stymie63 
<br />Locked in my cage, I stare at the emptiness;
<br />this very emptiness possesses my soul - 
<br />we are one.
<br /><br />The months pass, as do the years, 
<br />yet as time progresses, it loses all relevance. 
<br />I sit here trapped in a recurring nightmare, never to awaken.
<br />I feed on my own self-pity - 
<br />I never hunger. I merely exist, 
<br />captive in this asylum, biding my time; 
<br />my sole gratification, inebriated isolation.
<br /><br />The door to my cage is ajar, as is often the case, 
<br />yet it's pointless to leave; 
<br />each journey leads me back 
<br />to this God-forsaken realm of suffering and despair.
<br /><br />Long ago, I was free; 
<br />I remember faces, smiling faces. 
<br />A different me, in a different time - 
<br />it was a time of fulfillment, of togetherness, of love. 
<br />Then one day the fantasy ended, and I was here . . . 
<br />but enough about the past; I must face my reality.
<br /><br />Distant voices race through my head, 
<br />as I stave off insanity. 
<br />But this time, the voice is real. 
<br />Unsure of its origin, I feel my soul is not as cold; my burden lighter. 
<br />Though I smile, I soon shiver in frustration.
<br />Tears stream down my cheeks, 
<br />as I cannot deny that the other voice is my own, 
<br />as my rationality succumbs to my imagination.

<br />by Moondust 
<br />Purity once had a name,
<br />And beauty once had a face.
<br />Life once had a meaning,
<br />And once I was safe.
<br />Once there was freedom,
<br />And once I could laugh.
<br />Happiness once was alive,
<br />And once I had another half.
<br />Once I shared her love,
<br />Once I was by her side,
<br />Once I felt I fitted,
<br />So quickly that died.
<br />Her grace so great,
<br />Her beauty so vast,
<br />All I ever wanted,
<br />Was for it to last.
<br />Fate maybe had another plan,
<br />Or maybe she had another love,
<br />But it all fell apart,
<br />The hand too big for the glove.
<br />Now it's all died away,
<br />Happiness, joy, love; all memories.
<br />Now I walk alone in this dark, dark world,
<br />With no light to guide my way.

<br />by Cherenee 
<br />Inside my sleeve, I pull out my heart,
<br />handing it to you, &quot;careful it's fragile,
<br />and easily falls apart.&quot;
<br /><br />Extending your arms, you take the heart in
<br />your tender warm hands.
<br />It falls into a million shattered pieces - on
<br />the floor it lands.
<br /><br />You begin to bend down to pick it up, sorrow and
<br />sadness in your eyes.
<br /><br />Apologies are not enough.
<br /><br />Looking at you with tears in my eyes,
<br />I ask you not to pick up the pieces of a heart
<br />that has fallen apart.
<br /><br />I am the one who needs to pick up the pieces of
<br />my shattered heart - one by one, piece by piece.
<br /><br />I need to put it together again, some how. some way.
<br /><br />Each piece of my heart has a memory so true.
<br />Each piece of my heart has part of you.
<br /><br />You are the one who is leaving to start a new lease on life.
<br />I'll just be here on my knees picking up the pieces of a
<br />heart that feels like it's being pierced with a knife.
<br /><br />All my tears won't keep you near
<br />All my tears won't mend what's not here.
<br /><br />Again I look at you with a whisper in my voice,
<br />The only way my heart will mend and finally be complete,
<br />is if you and I can come together without being discreet.
<br />You see, what we have here and today, helps me face the
<br />world, with a love for you that gives a glow -
<br />but now, my darling, you made a choice.
<br /><br />My heart is on this floor, shattered and broke.
<br />With each piece I pick up -
<br />I need to learn to let go.

<br />by Anna Gillis 
<br />You said the words I love you,
<br />But it is obvious things have changed.
<br />I said the words I love you,
<br />And my feelings are still the same.
<br />You said I'll love you forever,
<br />But forever wasn't long enough.
<br />I said I'll love you always,
<br />And I'll mean it forever.
<br />But I can not imply to you
<br />What that means,
<br />'Cause your version of Forever
<br />Isn't what it seems,
<br />And my version of Always
<br />Seems like an unrealistic dream.

<br />Â© By Raven S. Farrell
<br /><br />Red for the color of her eyes after she cried those tears
<br />For what they left behind was nothing more than a smear
<br /><br />Gray for the sky because you broke her heart
<br />But why did you for she was both beautiful and smart
<br /><br />Black for her heart for she will never love again
<br />And you have created a dead person within! 
<br /><br />I cry for the time that you were almost mine,
<br /> I cry for the memories I've left behind, 
<br />I cry for the pain, the lost, the old the new, 
<br />I cry for the times I thought I had you <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cry.gif" alt=":)" />

<br /><br />* You can close your eyes to things you donât want to see, but you canât close your heart to things you donât want to feel. ~ 
<br /><br />* When you said forever, you meant a few months. When I said forever, I meant every day until I died. When you said always, you meant until you couldn't handle it anymore. When I said always, I meant until time ended. When you said you loved me, you meant I was no different from any other girl. When I said I loved you, I meant I had never felt what I felt for you. ~
<br /><br />* With you my heart will always stay. With you my thoughts will be every day. You remain to be the one that I regret letting get away. Why didn't I say what I needed to say? You are the one I will always use my wishes on. You are the one I will always wish was never gone. I'll constantly wonder what went wrong. I'll forever think of what I could've did that was never done. ~ Anonymous
<br /><br />* There's this place in me where your finger prints still rest... your kisses still linger and your whispers softly echo... It's the place where a part of you will forever be a part of me. ~ 
<br /><br />* How could an Angel break my heart? Why did not he catch my falling star? I wish I did not wish so hard. Maybe I wished our love apart. ~ 
<br /><br />* You hurt me once... shame on you. You hurt me twice... shame on me. ~
<br /><br />* True love? I used to believe it existed, but when youâve had your heart torn out and thrown on the floor, you just donât care anymore. . Ask me why I keep on loving ~

<br />you know that you are guilty of
<br />And I see that it is easy for you to blame

<br />When my girl told me she saw you with some girl

<br />other people fall in love with you, but you don't have enough time
<br /> to pay attention to the one who already does?
<br /><br />I'm not the girl that runs up to you when I see you 
<br />And I'm not the girl who jumps at every moment 
<br />To talk to you, but I am the girl who keeps it all inside 
<br />And regrets it all later....
<br /><br />Beware of the players, they'll steal your heart
<br />And they'll give it back, all torn apart
<br />Don't let them suck you into their game
<br />Because once you lose, you are never the same
<br /><br />Silly me I believed all the lies, 
<br />I expected a fairytale I'm not surprised,
<br />You cant be with someone for all of time, 
<br />You can pretend but you know it's not fine.
<br /><br />So this is how hearts break, Much more pain than I can take, 
<br />So I'll let you go this time, Don't worry I haven't forgotten how to pretend I'm fine.
<br /><br />Saturday I saw you holding hands with someone new 
<br />Somehow I kept my composure just like everything was cool 
<br />But inside I kept repeating &quot;Don't you let them see you cry&quot; 
<br />So I casually turned my head, As the tears rolled down my eyes
<br /><br />A sweet thing a guy can say is &quot;I love you&quot; but doesn't quite mean it. 
<br />But the sweetest thing he can say is &quot;I don't love you&quot; but cries inside.
<br /><br />I'm scared to fall more in love with you.
<br /> There are plenty of other girls out there that are better then me. 
<br />So why are you settling for me?
<br /><br />I'll sit and I'll smile
<br />as you tell me about your new girl
<br />I hope she's happy...
<br />She gets my whole world.
<br /><br />Now he's calling your house 
<br />Cuz he wants to hang out 
<br />And do that thing you do 
<br />You're getting overexcited and you cannot fight 
<br />The fact that he's bad news
<br /><br />Love? It's kind of complicated, but I'll tell you this... 
<br />the second you're willing to make yourself miserable 
<br />to make someone else happy, that's love right there
<br /><br />Having your boyfriend break up with you and saying &quot;We can still be friends&quot; 
<br />is like having your dog die, and your mom saying you can still keep it
<br />Don't be afraid to tell someone you love them. 
<br />If you do...they might break your heart...
<br />But if you don't... you might break theirs.
<br /><br />knew from the very beginning that you were just a flirt, 
<br />and yet I fell in love with you, knowing I'd get hurt. 
<br />I'll conceal my broken heart behind a smiling face 
<br />and though you thought I never cared, no one can take your place
<br /><br />You'll never know how much I miss you, you won't see it in my face, 
<br />You'll never know there won't be another guy to take your place cause 
<br />I'll be smiling when I see you, no my tears won't ever show, 
<br />I might always love you, but you'll never know...
<br /><br />Everyone says to give up on you, but they don't see you like I do. 
<br />you're the one who broke my heart, you're the reason my world fell apart 
<br />you're the one who made me cry, yet I still love you and I don't know why
<br /><br />Sweet is love when all is sane 
<br />Sweet is death to rid the pain 
<br />Cruel is death when all is well 
<br />Cruel is love when all is hell
<br /><br />Never say I love you, if you don't really care,
<br />Never talk about feelings, if they aren't really there.
<br />Never hold my hand, if you're going to break my heart,
<br />Never say you're going to, if you don't plan to start.
<br />Never look into my eyes, if all you do is lie,
<br />Never say hello if you really mean goodbye.
<br />If you really mean forever, then say that you will try,
<br />Never say forever, because forever makes me cry

<br /><br />[Talking:]
<br />You know with each day that passes by, I pray to god I'll never forget who you are.
<br />You mean everything to me.
<br />I love you
<br /><br />Ooooh Ooooh 
<br />Ooh I pray
<br /><br />You were in my dream
<br />Before I even knew that there was a you and me,
<br />Now I can't wait to see your smile,
<br />When I wake up each day,
<br />It makes it worth while
<br />With the kinda love you plant inside, 
<br />Specially with a heart so empty as mine.
<br />All your soft tenderness is the one thing that I don't wanna miss.
<br /><br />[Chorus:]
<br />I pray,
<br />When it's time for me to say goodbye
<br />I'll never forget looking in your eyes,
<br />I pray,
<br />That I feel your touch 
<br />And that God doesn't forget our love,
<br />I pray,
<br />When I close my eyes,
<br />I can still see visions of you on my mind.
<br />I pray,
<br />That I see you in another life,
<br />I pray that you still by my side.
<br />Oh I pray.
<br /><br />Everything that you give to me,
<br />Only comes in a fantasy,
<br />It seems like life goes by so fast,
<br />But in this time I wanna make it last. (I pray)
<br />I hate that we live to die,
<br />But only God knows why (I pray)
<br />We all have a purpose, 
<br />And to see you again it'll be worth it.
<br /><br />[Chorus]
<br /><br />[Slow rap:]
<br />I wish that I could stop time,
<br />I wish that I could rewind,
<br />To the very begining of every second of my life.
<br />To ask God on my hands and knees,
<br />To never let me forget all my special memories.
<br />See I'm only promised today,
<br />And if it's my time to go,
<br />I don't want the love of my life to ever fade away,
<br />So one last time
<br />Let me open my eyes.
<br />To see what my life used to be like.
<br />Oh God.

<br />by Little T 
<br />Loneliness is blue like sadness.
<br />It tastes like a sour lime with salt on it.
<br />It smells like rotten food and causes madness.
<br />For fun it likes to do nothing but bad things.
<br />While almost everything makes it angry
<br />Everything makes it sad,
<br />But nothing makes it happy.
<br /><br />Loneliness is smaller than you and me,
<br />But bigger than peoples' minds.
<br />Happiness is its enemy,
<br />But nothing can be its friend.
<br />Loneliness keeps its happy feelings in a secret place.
<br />Its favorite place is in peoples' minds.
<br />But it hates to be anywhere else.
<br />Making people feel bad is its greatest success.
<br />Not cheering people up it is greatest failure.
<br />Loneliness makes me feel as sad as a deserted island.

<br />When I was just a little girl,
<br />My mama used to tuck me into bed,
<br />And she'd read me a story.
<br /><br />It always was about a princess in distress
<br />And how a guy would save her
<br />And end up with the glory.
<br /><br />I'd lie in bed
<br />And think about
<br />The person that I wanted to be,
<br /><br />Then one day I realized
<br />The fairy tale life wasnât for me.
<br /><br />I donât wanna be like Cinderella,
<br />Sitting in a dark, cold, dusty cellar,
<br />Waiting for somebody to come and set me free (Come and set me free)
<br />I donât wanna be like someone waiting
<br />For a handsome prince to come and save me
<br />On I will survive
<br />Unless somebody's on my side
<br />Don't wanna depend on no one else.
<br />Iâd rather rescue myself.
<br /><br />Someday I'm gonna find Someone
<br />Who wants my soul, heart and mind
<br />Who's not afraid to show that he loves me
<br />Somebody who will understand I'm happy just the way i am
<br />Don't need nobody taking care of me
<br />(i will be there)I will be there for him just as strong as he will be there for me
<br />when i give myself then it has got to be an equal thing
<br /><br />I can slay (I can slay) my own dragons. (My own dragons)
<br />I can dream my own dreams. (My own dreams)
<br />My knight in shining armor (shining armor) is me.
<br />So I'm gonna set me free.
<br /><br />I donât wanna be like Cinderella,
<br />Sitting in a dark, cold, dusty cellar,
<br />Waiting for somebody to come and set me free.
<br />I donât wanna be like someone waiting

<br />On I will survive
<br />Unless somebody's on my side
<br /><br />I donât wanna be like Cinderella,
<br />Sitting in a dark, cold, dusty cellar,
<br />Waiting for somebody (oh - Oh) to come and set me free.
<br />I donât wanna be like someone waiting
<br />For a handsome prince to come and save me
<br />On I will survive
<br />Unless somebody's on my side
<br />Don't wanna depend on no one else.
<br />Iâd rather rescue myself.

<br />i knew there was something special
<br />i knew that i was going to enjoy and love every moment with you

<br />I know this day belongs to you
<br />For upon this day you were born
<br />But being apart on your special day
<br />Leaves my heart shattered and torn
<br /><br />I wanted to give you a special gift
<br />One that would surely last
<br />Something to put a song in my heart
<br />And dry away the tears
<br /><br />I thought perhaps balloons or flowers
<br />To put upon your grave
<br />But I knew that eventually
<br />They would just wither away
<br /><br />I thought about it long and hard
<br />What gift would surely last
<br />Something that you've never had
<br />On your birthday in the past
<br /><br />I realized that such a gift
<br />Couldn't come close to compare
<br />To the grand celebration
<br />That you must be having up there
<br /><br />So I'm sending you a birthday wish
<br />From the bottom of my heart
<br />To give me strength and courage
<br />Everyday that we're apart
<br /><br />I know you're happy in heaven
<br />With no sorrow, tears or pain
<br />But sometimes I'm so lonesome
<br />My tears fall like rain
<br /><br />So on your special day
<br />My wish I send to you
<br />Is someday I'll be with you
<br />When my chores on earth are thru
<br /><br />And as I tarry on thru the years
<br />Hold my wish close to your heart
<br />For God will come and take me home
<br />As long as I do my part
<br /><br />For now I must travel thru life alone
<br />For He isn't ready for me yet
<br />But what a glorious reunion we'll have
<br />When your smiling face I see
<br /><br />So on your birthday this year
<br />My wish I send to you
<br />Keep looking for me, don't give up

<br /><br />By Cory Martinez
<br />At first we loved, but not again.
<br />We met at the mall,
<br />and we talked ever since.
<br />We stood starring at each other,
<br />I wondered the time, we'd
<br />Stand together. Holding hands
<br />as we walk down the street,
<br />I wondered when our lips
<br />Would meet.
<br />My heart is broken, u seem
<br />to ignore, The pain I
<br />have, when u left me sore.
<br />Our love was strong In which now your
<br />heart is blind to see, now I feel
<br />that your love has forgotten
<br />completely about me.
<br />Well all in all I'm heartbroken
<br />Without u by my side,
<br />I wish we could love each
<br />other like we did that one time. 
<br /><br />A Deadly Love
<br />Â© By Felicia Renee McCormick
<br /><br />You walked into my life,
<br /><br />not knowing what to expect.
<br /><br />The anger and darkness that filled me frightened you,
<br /><br />but something kept you from leaving me.
<br /><br />Not knowing why you're still here,
<br /><br />your mind is a roller coaster of thoughts,
<br /><br />and feelings you never expected,
<br /><br />But strangely you never wanted them to end.
<br /><br />I could see your feelings grow for me;
<br /><br />the lust in your eyes cannot be mistaken,
<br /><br />with each day it grows more and more,
<br /><br />like the moon in the night's sky.
<br /><br />You're still confused on why you stay,
<br /><br />Knowing that your life could end at any moment.
<br /><br />The danger you're in, from just being with me,
<br /><br />excites you in a way you never knew existed.
<br /><br />What you don't realize is that I know what you are feeling;
<br /><br />you generally love me for the person I am.
<br /><br />What you don't know is that I am not a person at all,
<br /><br />but a creature of the night, a creature that could kill you at any moment.
<br /><br />And yet I let you stay, knowing what I could do,
<br /><br />I fear that I might have feelings for you.
<br /><br />They grow with each passing moment of time we spend together,
<br /><br />but I could never let it go too far, for you would never come back.
<br /><br />So as I watch you, and see your love grow for me,
<br /><br />I know that soon you will be gone forever.
<br /><br />And somehow you know this too,
<br /><br />but you're not afraid you're numbed by your lust for me.
<br /><br />As I watch you die, knowing I could have stopped it,
<br /><br />I tell myself that you meant nothing, but we both know that's not true,
<br /><br />I truly loved you and look at what I did to you.
<br /><br />Broken Heart
<br />Â© By Sarah B. Woods
<br /><br />You and I were the greatest thing
<br />Laughter and smiles is what we would bring
<br /><br />We would talk on the phone, until it was time for bed
<br />Even then I would see you, in my dreams, inside my head
<br /><br />Every time I saw you, I would always smile
<br />You could see a glow in my eyes from miles and miles
<br /><br />Man, I wish I was still holding onto you
<br />But you gotta girl now, so what can I do?
<br /><br />Now when I see you, there's always a frown
<br />Won't you please turn that sad frown upside down?
<br /><br />If you're not happy with this person, then just say goodbye
<br />Because seeing you depressed, brings tears to my eyes
<br /><br />Today I approached you, but you didn't say a word
<br />I still have feelings for you, haven't you heard?
<br /><br />I miss seeing you smile and laugh
<br />Won't you please remember the fun we had?
<br /><br />Holding hands coming from lunch
<br />Wow! I miss you a whole bunch
<br /><br />Just ask my family, you were all I talked about
<br />Now all I do is walk around the house and pout
<br /><br />I love hearing your voice; it brings a smile to my face
<br />It's a sound that I shall always embrace
<br /><br />I had no idea I actually felt this way
<br />Please tell me, why does it feel like you're pushing me away?
<br /><br />The reason we broke up, I don't even know why
<br />Just thinking about you now makes me want to cry
<br /><br />It was peer pressure; they said you lied too much
<br />But I would easily take you back with just one touch
<br /><br />The one your with, for you, doesn't even care
<br />That is why right now she gets pretty mean stares
<br /><br />Enough about her, she makes me sick
<br />I miss you way more than just a little bit
<br /><br />I need to toughen up; I know we'll always be apart
<br />That is the reason why right now, I have a broken heart
