<br /><br />This is a very interesting video from Nat Geo, they were able to come up with the world's most typical person. Of course it is still rather relative, the typical person they describe is supposed to represent 7 million of the world's 9 billion population. In other words the most typical man is only .001% of the world population which is not really too typical at all.  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/wink.gif" alt=":)" />

<br />Have you ever felt like everyone is talking and yet no one is really listening? Don't you just hate it when people open their mouths and all that come out are self serving words that really add nothing to a conversation? Why is it that it seems that good conversations are getting harder and harder to find these days?  If you have someone whom you could talk and listen to normally, treasure that person for he or she a rare treasure and you might not find another like them.

<br />I just love how a mojito can turn a bad day around. There is nothing like having a cool refreshing drink after a long hard day from work. A beer is always good but every now and then a little variety is also good. A little bit of lime, some mint leaves, a generous helping of alcohol and ice and you are all set! AHHH you got to love the person who came up with this one.  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" />

<br />This Saturday, March 12, Miguel Cotto will be facing Ricardo Mayorga in what I hope  will be a good fight. I will be sure to watch as I am a big boxing fan. Who wins the match really isn't important to me. I just want to see a good fight.

<br />They say well have an inner child, but how often do we see it indulged in such a grand scale? I just love that there were people who were willing to fund such a thing and people who were willing to take on such a challenge. It's amazing the things that can be done with a camera and a dream, it will move people to such great accomplishments!

<br />It was an action packed fight at the MGM Grand garden Arena as Miguel Cotto and Ricardo Mayorga put up a great fight. It was a closer fight than most expected with the very game Mayorga constantly coaxing Cotto into a brawl but the later refused to play along and instead fought a disciplined and smart fight. Cotto threw a viscous right hook that sent Mayorga to the canvas in the last round of the fight. Mayorga quit seconds later saying he broke his thumb in the exchange.

<br />I am really exited about the upcoming fight between Shogun and Jon Jones. Shogun has always been one of my favorite fighters and I am exited to see him back in the ring after defeating Machida about a year ago. Jones is another of my favorite fighters, his unusual striking and strong ground skills makes him one of the best light heavyweights today. This is a very interesting match up as both fighters have very exiting and explosive fighting styles, I'd be surprised if this fight goes the distance!

<br /><br />I've decided to make my foray into the design of other products. I'm guessing that lots of folks like iPhones, right? So, I'm going to start making iPhone cases. I couldn't decide at first whether or not to choose to make iPhone 3 or iPhone 4 cases, but I finally decided to design just for the newer one because more people probably have it. Ugh, I have Verizon, but I'm just too broke at the moment to get my own iPhone. Anyway, here's my first case design:

<br /><br />I love Taarab music. If you don't know what Taraab is, well here is a description: 
<br /><br />Taarab is a music genre popular in Tanzania and Kenya. It is influenced by music from the cultures with a historical presence in East Africa, including music from East Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa, North Africa, the Middle East and Europe. Taarab rose to prominence in 1928 with the rise of the genre's first star, Siti binti Saad.
<br /><br />According to local legend, taarab was started by Sultan Seyyid Barghash bin Said (1870-1888); he liked luxury and the pleasures of life. It was this ruler who started Taarab in Zanzibar and later it spread all over East Africa. He imported a taarab ensemble from Egypt, to play in his Beit el-Ajab palace. Later on he decided to send to Egypt Mohamed Ibrahim to learn music and he also learned to play the Kanun. Upon his return he formed the Zanzibar Taarab Orchestra. In 1905, Zanzibar's second music society, Ikwhani Safaa Musical Club, was established and continues to thrive today.

<br /><br />“The really important kind of freedom involves attention, and awareness, and discipline, and effort, and being able truly to care about other people and to sacrifice for them, over and over, in myriad petty little unsexy ways, every day.”
<br /><br />“Because here’s something else that’s weird but true: in the day-to day trenches of adult life, there is actually no such thing as atheism. There is no such thing as not worshipping. Everybody worships. The only choice we get is what to worship. And the compelling reason for maybe choosing some sort of god or spiritual-type thing to worship — be it JC or Allah, bet it YHWH or the Wiccan Mother Goddess, or the Four Noble Truths, or some inviolable set of ethical principles — is that pretty much anything else you worship will eat you alive. If you worship money and things, if they are where you tap real meaning in life, then you will never have enough, never feel you have enough. It’s the truth. Worship your body and beauty and sexual allure and you will always feel ugly. And when time and age start showing, you will die a million deaths before they finally grieve you. On one level, we all know this stuff already. It’s been codified as myths, proverbs, clichés, epigrams, parables; the skeleton of every great story. The whole trick is keeping the truth up front in daily consciousness.”

Now that I've found some inspiration again, I thought I'd share what I cam up with. Father's Day has actually always been one of my favorite holidays mostly because my brother and I always take a trip down to see our Dad for the weekend. My parents divorced when we were both really young, and my Dad moved pretty far away, but every Father's Day, he'd come back and pick us up to spend the weekend at his house. Once we got old enough to drive, we would take ourselves, but we always reminisced about the road trip when we were young. Anyway, enough about memory lane...check out my designs:

<br /><br />Haha this is pretty funny! What happens when a man battles with a ninja. I am a fan of ninjas, I think they're great. That's why since I was a kid I watch Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, then other ninja movies. Recently I also watched Ninja Assassin starring Rain, which is great!

<br /><br />Dwight: Damn it! Jim!
<br />Michael: OK. Hold on, hold on. The judge is in session. What is the problem here?
<br />Dwight: He put my stuff in Jell-O again.
<br />Pam: [Laughing]
<br />Dwight: That's real professional thanks. That's the third time and it wasn't funny the first two times either Jim.

<br /><br />I think there's a spoof now in Saturday Night Live, entitled MacGruber, which has spawned a movie. It's hilarious because the scene is always Mac trapped in a steam room of sorts with a ticking bomb and he has to dismantle it but hilarity ensues.

<br /><br />On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair
<br />Warm smell of colitas, rising up through the air
<br />Up ahead in the distance, I saw shimmering light
<br />My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
<br />I had to stop for the night
<br />There she stood in the doorway;
<br />I heard the mission bell
<br />And I was thinking to myself,
<br />'This could be Heaven or this could be Hell'
<br />Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way
<br />There were voices down the corridor,
<br />I thought I heard them say...
<br /><br />Welcome to the Hotel California
<br />Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)
<br />Such a lovely face
<br />Plenty of room at the Hotel California
<br />Any time of year (Any time of year)
<br />You can find it here
<br /><br />Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, she got the Mercedes Benz
<br />She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys she calls friends
<br />How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat.
<br />Some dance to remember, some dance to forget
<br /><br />So I called up the Captain,
<br />'Please bring me my wine'
<br />He said, 'We haven't had that spirit here since nineteen sixty nine'
<br />And still those voices are calling from far away,
<br />Wake you up in the middle of the night
<br />Just to hear them say...
<br /><br />Welcome to the Hotel California
<br />Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)
<br />Such a lovely face
<br />They livin' it up at the Hotel California
<br />What a nice surprise (what a nice surprise)
<br />Bring your alibis
<br /><br />Mirrors on the ceiling,
<br />The pink champagne on ice
<br />And she said 'We are all just prisoners here, of our own device'
<br />And in the master's chambers,
<br />They gathered for the feast
<br />They stab it with their steely knives,
<br />But they just can't kill the beast
<br /><br />Last thing I remember, I was
<br />Running for the door
<br />I had to find the passage back
<br />To the place I was before
<br />'Relax,' said the night man,
<br />'We are programmed to receive.
<br />You can check-out any time you like,
<br />But you can never leave!
