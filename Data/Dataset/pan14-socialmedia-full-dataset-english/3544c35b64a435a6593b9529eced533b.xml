<br />The ones lost when the morning
<br />falls asleep in the parks,
<br />with taste of tears at it's head.
<br /><br />It's people with bleeding wounds
<br />only for just one second
<br />more,
<br />people sheltered between your palms.
<br /><br />It's people with treasures in their eyes,
<br />you steal them leave them poor, smile formaly
<br />and leave.
<br /><br />People with crucified lips
<br />In peanut-sized truths
<br />that were yours just a thought away.
<br /><br />Silence People,
<br />Wind-and-dust People,
<br />Broken-apple People,
<br />People of Silent Embrace.
<br /><br />People that hurt you like a spot on the eye,
<br />and people forgotten in the train.
<br /><br />Only for those people
<br />Shut up and cry!
<br />All the rest we are just a grin,
<br />We're all just a scream.</strong>

<br />If you have any &quot;vision&quot;, crazy or not, after reading this story, please be welcome to post a coment.</em></span>
<br /><br />Cold outside, weird weather, somewhere between snow and fog.
<br />The tea has been boiling for minutes in a chinese boiling machine, I'm starring at it and waiting for Manolo to remember and order me to turn it off.
<br />Manolo dreams away. On the day shyft he used to show me frosted blondes and tell me about the things he would do with them if only he had the necessary... But at this hour the frosted blondes are warming up someone's bed.
<br />Unique event for tonight: outside the glass door a frosted old lady passing by.
<br />Manolo: Duuude just look at them for God's sake! Stupid old b'ches at this hour they're in the mood for having a walk... (barked my beloved comrad)
<br />Me: Oh come on, just let them be, they have little left, they live their lives to &quot;the fullest&quot;
<br />Manolo slowly stretches his hairy-rubensian arm and after a couple of shakes he manages to remove that chinese thing out the socket, then he rests for a while and continues:
<br />Manolo: There are 2 old ugly ladyes, twins, they show up from time to time near the American Ambassy with papers in their hands. They're screaming, telling people that they are followed by the former security service, that they are remote tortured  by tv, that they have microphones in their houses. Listen to me, the world is going crazy, today more than anytime so many crazy dudes on the street!
<br />Me: And you're their boss man! We're all a little swiped..
<br />Manolo: I'm telling you this is the disease of the century, doctors said so, not me. Most common problem today is the head thingy. Go and stiff that paper under the door or we'll be freezin' here. And turn off the light I'm getting sleepy.
<br />I obey. Then it get's really quiet. And I look outside the window, through the weather outside, through the window and the darkness of the building across the street, the &quot;twin&quot; of this one we are in.
<br />Beyond the fact that there is even darker and colder, I recall events from the past. About another colleague, who passed the psichological test, but has panick attacks, watches movies about war and has visions that he is followed by the russian secret service. And about a &quot;bi&quot; lady that &quot;hooked me up&quot; when I was younger and was about to rape me, but not until she told me that she thinks her husband or an ex boyfriend installed a microphone in her vag*na.
<br />And the list could go on.
<br />Painfull but funny, this people, most likely, viewed once some shocking movie or news, in such way that they have associated it to their lives and started to make a comfusion between them, just because that made them comfident about their knowledge and actions. The others around didn't see anything in any movie or news to be associated that way to their lives. And they stood sane and so we avoided a mass psychosis.
<br />I am a cop. I am not allowed to have visions, otherwise it would be really messy. I am not allowed to be afraid of the dark either. And I am not. Because Manolo, in case a monster shows up, can't run because he's fat and ill. I can run fast. But how could I leave Manolo alone? He's my mate, my comrad!
<br />Yet... I am afraid of the darkness in the building across the street. And the cold in there because of wich I almost couldn't wake up once when I chose to sleep across the street.
<br />Sometimes, inevitable, we get to be afraid of the darkness in some people's minds. A strange fear, like ice in our chest, that makes us want to run fast the opposite way. And if we manage to, then we are right, then we understand them, so we can forgive them, because they don't know what they are doing.
<br />Manolo dreams away. After the snorring I can tell that it is a dream about some frosted people. Happily he doesn't scream, so it's not the old ladyes. Everything will be just fine.
<br />From now on, each of us with his own movies and dreams.
<br />I draw back in the darkeness across.. and wonder who will be the first to turn on the light in the morning, me or Manolo?

<br />We crush
<br />We step on
<br />Soliloquize
<br />And we wonder why,
<br />Although we have witnesses
<br />We don't have comrads in arms
<br />Only victims.
<br /><br />On the roadside
<br />The trees are keeping silence
<br />And the wind on the leaves
<br />Feels afraid to blow
<br />For the echo
<br />May have left
<br />Or may be home
<br />But not for him.
<br /><br />I see the mirror
<br />Where it hurts most
<br />In other spots
<br />I don't look so much alike
<br />With that image
<br />Does it also see us smaller
<br />Further
<br />Or is it just making faces at us?
<br /><br />How could you answer
<br />To a stone
<br />So that you make it
<br />Reblume
<br />If you are also a stone
<br />Would that be an advantage?
<br /><br />Kisses.
<br /><br />Am i doing the same thing
<br />From different pieces of a dream?
<br />Should i be waiting in a louder manner?

<br />like raindrops fill my ear,
<br />stillness flowing through my veins 
<br />It's roar that I can hear.
<br /><br />It makes me new.
<br />It makes me old.
<br />It writes on me with dew
<br />And watches at my head.
<br /><br />It rains on my dreams

<br /><br />The sun sets
<br />Behind the dark forest
<br />And raises in flames from the sea
<br /><br />I once killed 
<br />A sparrow
<br />I shot with the sling in her
<br />And i hit her
<br />Then for a day
<br />And a full night
<br />I cried and mourned for her
<br />Then for a day
<br />And a full night
<br />I cried and mourned for her
<br /><br />My mom didn't beat me
<br />And did not punish me
<br />I was holding in my hands
<br />A piece of bread
<br />There's no reason she said
<br />No reason to cry now
<br />For what you have killed
<br />Stays dead forever.
<br />There's no reason she said

<br />for a girl
<br />I don't know why
<br />One day she died
<br />The other day she was burried
<br />I don't know why
<br />One day she died
<br />The other day she was burried
<br /><br />For long I don't shoot 
<br />with the sling in sparrows
<br />For long I don't go to any burrial

<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong>The Rain that Will Come by Pasarea Colibri</strong></span>
<br /><br />I am a young brother, who believes in justice,
<br />My eyes are black, but my hands are clean. 
<br />I love long hair and flowery shirts and rain,
<br />I dont answer when people talk in my back.
<br /><br />An insignificant fact can make me hope,
<br /> I bow and bring into balance what is holy with what is ephemeral.
<br /> Everywhere is heavy value on
<br /> Fear of honesty ...
<br /><br />But how many times, my friends, I smiled with sorrow,
<br /> When hopes seemed misleading.
<br /> When dishonesty and stupidity were hiding in holes their luck
<br /> You know how many times, my friends, I caught their game.
<br /> We're tired of twaddle, books and shock movies
<br /> With cold vamps and corpses, with cheap trade stars.
<br /><br />The Rain that will come
<br /> It will storm over all.
<br /><br />Im sick of marches, of trombones and taxes,
<br />of trademarks of standards and appearences.
<br /> Because money and stupidity are moral dangers
<br /> The circle of life forced us on deadly jumps.
<br />Over our flowers the shroom calls for desert
<br /> Blue birds fall from the sky, yet its not too late.
<br /><br />The Rain that will come
<br /> It will storm over all.
<br />Let us try to make
<br />A city without sins.
<br /> The Rain that will come
<br /> It will storm over all.
<br /> The Rain that will come
<br /> It will storm over all.
