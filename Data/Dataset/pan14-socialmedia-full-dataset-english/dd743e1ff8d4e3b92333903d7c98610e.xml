As for any stage of oral cancer, patients will require treatment to reduce and control the pain and relieve therapy side effects. Emotional and practical problems will be taken care of. This type of treatment is known as palliative care or supportive care.  <br /><br />Here is one quick resource before we get started:  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5sYXN2ZWdhc2Jlc3RkZW50YWxjYXJlLmNvbQ__" target="_blank">Dentistry Las Vegas</a><br /><br />OK, now let’s take a look at additional functional  guidelines.<br /><br />The determining factor of your treatment will be, where in the mouth the cancer began, whether the cancer has spread and how big the tumor is. Treatment choices and the expected results should be described clearly by the doctor. Make sure you consider the outcome of the treatment you choose in the way it is going to affect your normal activities like chewing, swallowing, appearance and also speech.<br /><br />If a biopsy test shows that you have cancer, the extent of the disease should be known by your doctor and recommend the best treatment.The stage is based on the size of the tumor, whether the cancer has spread and, if so, to what parts of the body. Lab test and endoscopy may needed at the staging level. Endoscopy is when a doctor uses a thin lighted tube to check your lungs, throat and windpipe.<br /><br />Surgery to remove the tumor in the mouth or throat is a common treatment for oral cancer. In other cases the surgeon may remove lymph nodes from your neck. There could be other tissues removed from your mouth and neck too. Sometimes you could only need surgery while in other cases a combination with radiation therapy would be the answer.<br /><br />Radiation is a form of local therapy also known radiotherapy. Only the affected area is affected by this therapy. For patients who cannot have surgery, radiotherapy alone can be done for small tumors. It may be used before surgery to kill cancer cells and shrink the tumor. This may also be done to destroy cancer cells that remain in the area after surgery.Radiation therapy uses high-energy rays to kill cancer cells.<br /><br />Two types of radiation therapy can be used to treat cancer of the mouth.<br /><br />•	External radiation:  This type of radiation uses a machine. Once or twice a day for 5 days a week for several months is what a patient goes through.<br /><br />•	Internal radiation (implant radiation):  When internal radiation is done, it comes directly to the tissue through radioactive materials placed in seeds, needles or thin plastic bags. Treatment of this nature requires you to be admitted to the hospital as the implants remain in place for a couple of days and are removed when you are discharged to go home.<br /><br />Some oral cancer patients may need both types of radiotherapy.<br /><br />If you use anticancer drugs to kill cancer cells, this is chemotherapy. Known also as systematic therapy for affecting cancer cells throughout the body as it enters the bloodstream. Chemotherapy is usually given by injection. It may be given in an outpatient part of the hospital, at the doctor's office, or at home. You do not need to be admitted to a hospital.<br /><br />Many people with oral cancer want to take an active part in making decisions about their medical care. Learning about your disease and the treatment choices available is only natural.You and your doctor can work together to develop a treatment plan that meets your needs and personal values.

If hot, cold, sweet or very acidic foods and drinks, or breathing in cold air, makes your teeth or a tooth sensitive or painful then you have sensitive teeth.<br /><br />Here’s a quick resource before we get started:  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5sYXN2ZWdhc2Jlc3RkZW50YWxjYXJlLmNvbQ__" target="_blank">Dentist Las Vegas</a><br /><br />OK, now let’s take a look at more  useful tips.<br /><br />Tooth sensitivity is usually caused by dentin on root areas exposed due to receded gums or periodontal disease.  For those people who are above the age of 65, tooth sensitivity is a very common occurrence but the whole of the world population is very prone to suffer from this condition.<br /><br />When the root of a tooth becomes exposed it does not have a layer of enamel like the crowns of your teeth. Instead the roots have a very soft covering called cementum, which once lost leaves the dentin of the root exposed.  Overzealous brushing or using very abrasive toothpaste can also cause abrasion of the tooth's enamel surface and expose dentin. <br /><br />To ensure that what you have is tooth sensitivity or dentin hypersensitivity, it is important to tell your dentist or hygienist so that he or she can assist you in choosing a good treatment.  If you brush poorly because of pain then there is more risk of tooth decay and gum disease but sensitive teeth can be painful to brush.  If your case is one where you have pain after taking hot, cold, sweet or acidic food and drinks which can also be a sign of decay with a cavity or hole in the tooth, or a sign of a broken tooth, your dentist will treat you with a filling or other treatment.<br /><br />Only visible with a microscope are thousands of tiny channels found in dentin. From the surface of the dentin to the very nerve centre of the tooth which is the pulp, you will find these channels running.  In these tiny channels is a fluid that after eating or drinking hot or cold foods, moves and irritates the nerves in the tooth, causing pain.<br /><br />To reduce your chances of getting tooth sensitivity, keep your mouth as healthy as possible with good oral hygiene to help prevent receding gums and periodontal disease. Brushing and flossing properly as recommended by your dentist or hygienist and using low abrasion toothpaste can help reduce the chance that you will have tooth sensitivity.  Tooth sensitivity can also be prevented by having a diet that is not too acidic. <br /><br />To treat tooth sensitivity, your dentist or hygienist may recommend that you use low abrasion toothpaste specially made for sensitive teeth. These toothpastes make the teeth less sensitive if you brush with them twice a day and also contain fluoride to help protect your teeth against decay. <br /><br />As an alternative, you may be prescribed a brush-on fluoride gel or a fluoride rinse, or high fluoride level toothpaste that is specially formulated to make your teeth less sensitive and provides extra protection against decay by your dentist.   These treatments have both the advantage of being done in your home and being inexpensive. <br /><br />Effective trick- An excellent supply of details could be observed utilizing RSS feeds by having an RSS reader.  <br /><br />The following are some RSS sites to take a crack at: FeedBase.net or<br />NewsIsFree.com<br /><br />RSS means Real Simple Syndication and is a vehicle for individuals to speedily get new facts, news and other good stuff without the need to sort through a great deal of net pages.
