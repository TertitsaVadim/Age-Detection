<br />that we don't have to change friends 
<br />if we understand that friends change. 
<br /><br />I believe- 
<br />that no matter how good a friend is, 
<br />they're going to hurt you every 
<br />once in a while and you must forgive 
<br />them for that. 
<br /><br />I believe- 
<br />that true friendship continues to grow, 
<br />even over the longest distance. 
<br />Same goes for true love. 
<br /><br />I believe- 
<br />that you can do something in an instant 
<br />that will give you heartache for life. 
<br /><br />I believe- 
<br />that it's taking me a long time 
<br />to become the person I want to be. 
<br /><br />I believe- 
<br />that you should always leave loved ones 
<br />with loving words. It may be the last 
<br />time you see them. 
<br /><br />I believe- 
<br />that you can keep going 
<br />long after you can't. 
<br /><br />I believe- 
<br />that we are responsible for what we do, 
<br />no matter how we feel. 
<br /><br />I believe- 
<br />that either you control your attitude 
<br />or it controls you. 
<br /><br />I believe- 
<br />that regardless of how hot and 
<br />steamy a relationship is at first, 
<br />the passion fades and there had 
<br />better be something else to take 
<br />its place. 
<br /><br />I believe- 
<br />that heroes are the people 
<br />who do what has to be done 
<br />when it needs to be done, 
<br />regardless of the consequences. 
<br /><br />I believe- 
<br />that money is a lousy way of keeping score. 
<br /><br />I believe- 
<br />that my best friend and I can do anything 
<br />or nothing and have the best time. 
<br /><br />I believe- 
<br />that sometimes the people you expect 
<br />to kick you when you're down, 
<br />will be the ones to help you get back up. 
<br /><br />I believe- 
<br />that sometimes when I'm angry 
<br />I have the right to be angry, 
<br />but that doesn't give me 
<br />the right to be cruel. 
<br /><br />I believe- 
<br />that just because someone doesn't love 
<br />you the way you want them to doesn't 
<br />mean they don't love you with all they have. 
<br /><br />I believe- 
<br />that maturity has more to do with 
<br />what types of experiences you've had 
<br />and what you've learned from them 
<br />and less to do with how many 
<br />birthdays you've celebrated. 
<br /><br />I believe- 
<br />that it isn't always enough to be 
<br />forgiven by others. Sometimes you 
<br />have to learn to forgive yourself. 
<br /><br />I believe- 
<br />that no matter how bad your heart is broken 
<br />the world doesn't stop for your grief. 
<br /><br />I believe- 
<br />that our background and circumstances 
<br />may have influenced who we are, 
<br />but we are responsible for who we become. 
<br /><br />I believe- 
<br />that just because two people argue, 
<br />it doesn't mean they don't love each other 
<br />And just because they don't argue, 
<br />it doesn't mean they do. 
<br /><br />I believe- 
<br />that you shouldn't be so eager to find out a 
<br />secret. It could change your life forever. 
<br /><br />I believe- 
<br />that two people can look at the exact 
<br />same thing and see something totally. 
<br />different. 
<br /><br />I believe- 
<br />that your life can be changed in a matter of 
<br />hours by people who don't even know you. 
<br /><br />I believe- 
<br />that even when you think you have no more 
<br />to give, when a friend cries out to you 
<br />you will find the strength to help. 
<br /><br />I believe- 
<br />that credentials on the wall 
<br />do not make you a decent human being. 
<br /><br />I believe- 
<br />that the people you care about most in life 
<br />are taken from you too soon.

<br />Couldn’t find my way 
<br />Every hatred that blocks my room of darkness 
<br />Every tears that falls down on my cheek 
<br />It makes me wonder should I continue to live? 
<br />When you came in times of my sorrow 
<br />Embrace me as if I’m going to hell 
<br />With every breath we take 
<br />You are the one for me 
<br />I would live in your love as the sea-grasses live in the sea 
<br />My hearts beats as your mine beats too 
<br />How I wish it will not going to end 
<br />New life for me to step on together with you 
<br />I will die just to be your angel 
<br />Angel who will watch when you are in your dream 
<br />When you sleep I watch you breathing 
<br />No one will harm you as my wings cover your soul 
<br />I love every move you make 
<br />I’ll kiss you with every sin you take 
<br />How I wish I could be in your arms as my last breath takes 
<br />You are the one who lifted me from my failures.

<br />And the way you cut your hair. 
<br />I hate the way you drive my car. 
<br />I hate it when you stare. 
<br />I hate your big dumb combat boots 
<br />And the way you read my mind. 
<br />I hate you so much it makes me sick. 
<br />It even makes me rhyme.. 
<br /><br />I hate it... 
<br />I hate the way you're always right. 
<br />I hate it when you lie. 
<br />I hate it when you make me laugh; 
<br />Even worse when you make me cry.. 
<br /><br />I hate it when you're not around 
<br />And the fact that you didn't call, 
<br />But mostly I hate the way I don't hate you; 
<br />Not even close; 
<br />Not even a little bit; 
<br />Not even at all.

<br />This is what you left me with 
<br />My heart weeps in tears 
<br />So shattered and torn 
<br />Only your love 
<br />Alone can repair
<br />My hopes and my dreams 
<br />Grow cold with each day 
<br />As I surely do fear 
<br />Your love for me 
<br />Has grown cold 
<br />Never to come again 
<br />In this life time to me 
<br />God If you only knew 
<br />How much I need you so 
<br />I still hold you in my heart 
<br />That will never change 
<br />All the time we have wasted 
<br />On things we 
<br />Shouldn't of faught about 
<br />That we cannot replace 
<br />Feeling so lost in my grief 
<br />I question myself 
<br />Is this to be my fate 
<br />To be forever captured 
<br />Without your love baby 
<br />Through out this endless time!

<br />these tears that well up in my eyes 
<br />my heart throbbing 
<br />a dull ache 
<br />at the back of my eyes 
<br />where i try to hide 
<br />all this pain 
<br />the only time i can cry 
<br />is in the pouring rain 
<br />i dont know if i can do this again 
<br />so many times i have tried 
<br />so many times i have cried 
<br />so many times that yes you hide 
<br />leaving me here to die inside 
<br />tearing up all my internal organs 
<br />burning through my skin 
<br />my heart shattering in to a thousand tiny shards of glass 
<br />my life ruined 
<br />its not longer worth living
<br />after all the love i was giving 
<br />the outcome is bleak 
<br />my heart left weak 
<br />unable to beat 
<br />on its own any longer 
<br />my tears trickle 
<br />making their way down my pale cheeks 
<br />staining the neckline of my new top 
<br />lips quivering 
<br />hands trembling 
<br />i have no controle 
<br />over my life anymore 
<br />it is destroyed 
<br />now that you have left me 
<br />and walked out the door
