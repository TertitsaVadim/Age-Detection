Many of the big fights of today are watched by millions of people around the world. Although MMA has been getting more popular as of late, it has been around for quite a long time and even had quite a following in the past couple decades. The UFC, or Ultimate Fighting Championship, has been holding fights for years to try and get this sport out to the masses. One of the more memorable events held in the last decade and a half was the UFC 21: Return of the Champions event held on July 16, 1999. <br /><br />This mixed martial art event was held at the Five Seasons Events Center that is located out in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. When it was first shown in the United States it could only be seen live on pay per view. Since then, it has been released on DVD for avid fans and followers. One of the biggest things that went on at UFC 21 was the changes in rules. In this event, all of the preliminary bouts would consist of two five minute rounds. The main fights of the night would be three five minute rounds and the final Championship round could go as long as five minute rounds. These rule changes made the sport more similar to the USA's unified rules of combat. The other major rule change to happen in the event was that it was the first UFC fight to bring in the 10 point must system that is often used in boxing. This was to help them better judge the fights. <br /><br />There were 8 bouts in this even, with 4 of them being heavyweight bouts, three of them being middleweight, and then a lightweight championship bout. The lightweight Championship bout was between Pat Miletech of the United States against Andre Pederneiras from Brazil. The match ended with Miletich winning by TKO. The doctor stopped the fight after a cut became too large to continue. There were two preliminary heavyweight bouts, the first being between Travis Fulton and David Dodd. The fight was decided after the two five minute rounds in favor of Fulton by unanimous decision. The next preliminary heavyweight bout was between Ron Waterman and Andre Roberts. This one didn't even last past the first round as Roberts won with a KO at 2:41. <br /><br />The first middleweight bout was between Royce Alger and Eugene Jackson where Jackson won by a KO in the second found at 1:17. Following that was the heavyweight bout between Jim Lajcik of the United States and Tsuyoshi Kosaka of Japan. The Japanese fighter came away with the victory after the doctor stopped the fight because Jim had a concussion. The next two middleweight bouts were between Paul Jones and Flavio Luiz Moura, and Jeremy Horn and Daiju Takase. Jones won the first match pulling a rear naked choke and putting his opponent into submission while Horn won the second bout after Horn got a TKO for his fierce striking ability. The very last heavyweight bout was between Maurice Smith and Marco Ruas where Smith won by injuring Marco's knee at 5:00 in the very first round. <br /><br />AUTHOR:- Jared Burgess writes reviews on various sporting events including the . <br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy55b3V0dWJlLmNvbS93YXRjaD92PWRHVEd6LWJIQ0NV" target="_blank">houston martial arts</a>

But did you know that there is such a thing called mixed martial arts?<br /><br />Mixed martial arts or MMA is a full contact combat support which allows players to fight in a competition using various fighting techniques. The rules allow the fighters to use various striking and grappling techniques both while standing and on the ground.<br /><br />But MMA was first introduced by the Greeks in 648 B.C. Back then, it was called the pankration which was introduced into the Olympic Games. Records show that there was a similar version of this in the 1800's which continued on in the early 1900's until the MMA came out in 1993 with the establishment of the Ultimate Fighting Championship or UFC.<br /><br />The difference between the MMA and those in the past is that this was initially created to find out which hand to hand combat technique works best to fight in a combat situation so fighters of various disciplines were gathered. During that time, there were only a few rules but more than 10 years later, additional ones were adopted to increase the safety of those who computed and to promote the sport.<br /><br />Today, you can see the Ultimate Fighting Championship on television. Research shows that mixed martial arts is now more popular today than boxing especially when more people were willing to pay to see it on pay per view channels surpassing wrestling and boxing.<br /><br />There are now 5 weight classes namely lightweight which is 67 to 70 kg, welterweight which is 71 to 77kg, middleweight from 78 to 84 kg, light heavyweight from 85 to 93 kg and heavy weight from 94 to 120 kg. There are 4 other weight classes but these are not currently being used by the UFC.<br /><br />How someone wins in mixed martial arts is pretty simple. If the opponent taps the floor, the match is over. The same happens if the opponent is knocked unconscious. Should both fighters still be standing at the end of the match, the winner will be decided by the judges.<br /><br />Illegal contact with the other opponent is called a foul. The referee inside the ring may deduct points from one player or even disqualify that person if the act committed was intentional or no contest if this was unintentional.<br /><br />One of the biggest differences in mixed martial arts is the ring where the fighters play. Unlike a boxing or wrestling ring that is shaped in a rectangle, competition here is done in an octagon shaped cage. The eight sided structure has walls of metal chain link fence coated with black vinyl. There is padding around the top of the fence and between each of the eight sections as well as two entry-exit gates which are opposite each other.<br /><br />Competitors who enter the ring have to wear proper attire. This means going into the ring with approved shorts and no shoes. Gloves must also be approved and have at least an inch of padding around the knuckles so the person will still be able to use his fingers and grab the opponent without the risk of injuring the hand.<br /><br />Is mixed martial arts nice to watch? The answer is yes given that there are now more people watching it and others who want to join the competition.  <br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy55b3V0dWJlLmNvbS93YXRjaD92PWRHVEd6LWJIQ0NV" target="_blank">martial arts houston</a>

This system is similar to that of the martial art of Judo which also uses different colored belts to signify rank or skill level. <br /><br />The colors of the different belts for adults are white, blue, purple, brown, black, black and red, and red. The junior belt colors for those under age 16 are white, grey, yellow, orange, and green. There is also a stripe award for those in the same belt rank. For example, a practitioner that has a blue belt with three stripes is more skillful than a blue belt with two stripes. <br /><br />White Jiu Jitsu Belts signify the initial or beginner rank for Jiu Jitsu students. There is no prerequisite to wearing the Brazilian Jiu Jitsu white belt. The next belt in the series is blue, and the beginner must demonstrate a well-rounded set of skills that include defensive positioning, escape and survival techniques, and elementary offensive moves like guard passes and common submissions. <br /><br />It is estimated to take between one to two years to earn a blue belt. It requires a huge amount of technical knowledge about Brazilian Jiu Jitsu as well as efficient implementation of these moves. The International Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Federation or IBJJF has declared that a practitioner must be at least age 16 to earn a blue belt and officially start with the adult belt system. <br /><br />Purple Jiu Jitsu Belts are considered to be the intermediate ranking in adult Jiu-Jitsu. It usually takes three or more years of blue belt training to earn a purple belt. Generally the rank of purple belt is held longer than most other ranks. They are usually qualified to instruct practitioners at the lower belt levels. <br /><br />The average amount of time it takes to go from purple to brown belt is two to three years. The brown belt is considered to be a transition between the intermediate purple belt and the elite black belt. At this point the practitioner already has the needed practical and technical skills, but time is spent refining and honing these skills to reach the black belt level. <br /><br />Black Jiu Jitsu Belts take between two to three years to earn from the brown belt, and it signifies an expert level of skill. Black belts advance through a series of degrees, and a 7th or 8th degree black belt may be awarded the black and red belt. This belt alternates between the colors or red and black, and it is sometimes called the &quot;coral belt.&quot; These practitioners are very experienced and have made an impact on the art of Jiu Jitsu. <br /><br />Finally, the red belt is awarded to those who have such fame and influence in the art that it has carried them to the highest successes. Based on the IBJJF's graduation system, it is said that the earliest one could receive the a 9th degree red belt is at 67 years old! Better late than never! <br /><br />Fighter's Market offers a wide variety of Jiu Jitsu and MMA gear for the BJJ Gi and MMA training athlete as well as MMA apparel for fans. Whether your goal is to fight in the UFC or win a jiu jitsu championship you'll need , gi pants, , and other MMA clothing. <br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWdlbnRlLmNvbS95b3VyX3BhZ2UvYmxvZy92aWV3X3Bvc3RpbmcuaHRtbD9waWQ9MzM1NjkwOSZhbXA7cHJvZmlsZV9pZD03NjEyNTI2JmFtcDtwcm9maWxlX25hbWU9Z3lkeWdpcGN5Ym85NDEmYW1wO3VzZXJfaWQ9NzYxMjUyNiZhbXA7dXNlcm5hbWU9Z3lkeWdpcGN5Ym85NDE_" target="_blank">7 Amazing Things Around martial arts houston</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5hbGl2ZW5vdGRlYWQuY29tL3hlY3VkdXRrb2xpODYxL0ZpdmUtQXN0b3VuZGluZy1UaGluZ3MtUmVnYXJkaW5nLW1hcnRpYWwtYXJ0cy1ob3VzdG9uLXByb2ZpbGUtMjcyNzQ0Ny5odG1s" target="_blank">Two Or More Astounding Items That Is Related To martial arts houston</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/elgerhowze/blog/blogid=11735059" target="_blank">A Set Of Amazing Things Which Involves martial arts houston</a>

The venue is in Las Vegas and the anticipation could not be any higher. It's true that both Wanderlei and Chuck are coming off back to back losses, but when you look at those losses and the quality of opposition it's clear that both of these guys are still at the top of their game.<br /><br />Wanderlei Silva has fought an absolute who's who of 205lb mixed martial artists and won the vast majority of those battles. He's defeated Quinton Jackson twice in dominant fashion, defeated Dan Henderson, Ricardo Arona, Kazushi Sakuraba, but has yet to face the best of the &quot;new&quot; UFC. How will Wanderlei match up against Chuck Liddell, Keith Jardine, Houston Alexander or Forrest Griffin? I personally think that Wanderlei's strength, power and aggression is difficult for any fighter to deal with. He has a wild style that could either make it a very easy night for Chuck, or the worst night of Chuck Liddell's career.<br /><br />Wanderlei likes to throw looping heavy punches, much like Chuck does, although Chuck's are just a touch straighter. The difference is in the clinch and ground game where I believe that Wanderlei Silva has a distinct advantage over Liddell. If Wanderlei gets Chuck in at close quarters it will be a very tough night for Liddell and three losses in a row may spell retirement for the &quot;Ice Man&quot;.<br /><br />Chuck Liddell needs no introduction to mixed martial arts and especially UFC fans. He has defeated two legends of the sport twice each. With big wins over Randy Couture and Tito Ortiz, Chuck Liddell established himself as the UFC's top light heavyweight player for much of the last three years. However, Chuck is coming off of two losses. The first was a flash knockout loss to Quinton &quot;Rampage&quot; Jackson, with that loss the belt changed hands and Quinton became the new light heavyweight champ.<br /><br />Chuck's second loss is more interesting. It came to Keith Jardine, now most MMA fans would argue that Jardine is strong and tough, but Chuck went into that fight as the favorite. The fight was close and the judges gave the decision to Jardine. There wasn't a single take down in the fight meaning that Chuck, formerly the most feared striker at 205lbs has been beaten twice in a row, both time on his feet.<br /><br />In the fight with Wanderlei Silva, if Chuck can keep his composure and land some big straight shots inside of Wandy's wild looping punches he can make a short night's work. Chuck hits very hard, but most of his really hard shots seem to be looping overhand rights, I don't think those will be particularly effective against Wanderlei Silva; Chuck needs to throw straight. Also, Chuck Liddell should avoid the clinch with Wanderlei at all costs, if he needs more incentive he should watch Wandy's two fights with Quinton Jackson.<br /><br />Let's all just hope that this fight happens as the rumors state on December 29th. I'm not picking a winner or a favorite in this fight, I just want to see it happen.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hvdXN0b24tbWFydGlhbC1hcnRzMzIub25zdWdhci5jb20vTGVhc3QtVHdvLUFzdG91bmRpbmctSXRlbXMtUmVsYXRpbmctbWFydGlhbC1hcnRzLWhvdXN0b24tMjQ3MzM5MDY_" target="_blank">Five Astounding Things Which Involves martial arts houston</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2NvbW11bml0eS5iYWJ5Y2VudGVyLmNvbS9qb3VybmFsL3dvY29qdXh6YWthOTgxLzU3NDYxMTEvM193b25kZXJmdWxfaXNzdWVzX2Fib3V0X21hcnRpYWxfYXJ0c19ob3VzdG9u" target="_blank">Two Additional Awesome Factors Which Involves martial arts houston</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3ZlcHVndWp3YXdpMTE0LnBvc3Rlcm91cy5jb20vYS1udW1iZXItb2YtYW1hemluZy10aGluZ3Mtb24tdGhlLXN1YmplY3Qtb2Y_" target="_blank">3 Remarkable Things Around martial arts houston</a>

The key to buying the right shorts is knowing what your options are. Keep in mind that the right shorts will matter. These shorts need to fit you well and provide for all of your needs in the ring. Consider the difference in buying a product that does nothing for you or may even give the other competitor an advantage and buying a pair that is easy to wear and even enhances your performance. This is an option that most competitors will have. <br /><br />Invest a few extra minutes in selecting the right shorts for your needs. The good news is that there are some great products on the market that can help. Many players are tempted to just go for the name brand and they think that these are going to be good enough. That's not the case. Even some of the top name brands do not have the same level of quality as other products.

Many MMA fighters have a training routine which consists of nothing but strength training. Yes it's nice to be able to have enough upper body strength for a major knockout punch, but what if the fight goes to the ground? You need to rely on more than just upper body strength. Train EVERY part of you. Develop your lower body strength, improve your running speed, your hand eye coordination, etc. This may sound like an obvious tip, but you'd be surprised how many people don't follow this tip and spend all of their training time focusing just on developing a better punch.<br /><br />2. Focus on training in more than just one style. This kind of goes with the first tip. This isn't boxing, this is MMA. There are all different styles and you need to be prepared for them. If you rely mostly on boxing skills and you face someone who is skilled in submissions, you're going to be in big trouble. Try to have an understanding of wrestling, judo, leg kicks, etc. <br /><br />3. Train for ground fighting. This is so important. Like I've said, you need to train in many different styles and parts of your body. But if there is one area to focus most of the time on, it would be ground fighting. Seriously, watch an MMA event. You'll notice just how many fights go to the ground. You need to be prepared for this. You need to know how to escape if someone has the mount position on you. You also need to know how to force a submission if you have the mount and you are losing energy after throwing multiple punches. DON'T skip ground graining!<br /><br />4. Don't bother spending too much of your time with punching bags. Use your time to train with a live partner and focus on takedowns. If you can master the art of the takedown, you can easily take your opponent down and finish the fight. Remember, when it comes to ground fighting, the person who ends up in the mount position is usually the one who went for the takedown. Don't wait for them to take you down. Make the move. <br /><br />5. Recognize your weaknesses and don't fret over them. If you have a weakness for kicks, don't obsess over trying to fix your weakness. Every fighter has a weakness in some part of their fighting style. Sure, it's good to practice and try to improve your skills in your weak area. But, you can also make up that lack of skill with skill in speed and takedowns.<br /><br />Hopefully you have learned something from these 5 tips. If you didn't notice, these tips generally have the same theme of technique over power. If you don't believe this is true, just take a look at some of Royce Gracie's older fights. Back when there weren't weight limits, Royce Gracie sometimes fought against fighters that were 200+ pounds bigger than him, but Royce Gracie would still get the win. Royce knew how to take them down and he knew how to make them submit. Follow his example. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" /><br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5kaXJlY3RvcmlzZS5jb20vbGlzdGluZy80MzUxNjQtNC1SZW1hcmthYmxlLUlzc3Vlcy1Bcm91bmQtbWFydGlhbC1hcnRzLWhvdXN0b24uaHRtbA__" target="_blank">4 Incredible Items On The Subject Of martial arts houston</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2Nlcm5jb3VyaWVyLmNvbS9jd3MvZXZlbnQvMjg3OTA3" target="_blank">Four Awesome Factors Surrounding martial arts houston</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5kZWluZWtvbGxlZ2VuLmRlL2Jsb2cucGhwP3VzZXI9cWVxYXNheGJ5Ynk0NjcmYW1wO2Jsb2dlbnRyeV9pZD01NDg2NjQy" target="_blank">2 Wonderful Factors Surrounding martial arts houston</a>
