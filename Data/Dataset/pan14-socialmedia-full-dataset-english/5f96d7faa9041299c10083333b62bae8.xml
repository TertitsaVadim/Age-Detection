I went there with Toland, Frances and Carlos from Grade 12. Also, Ereal, Jane, Bonnie, Helen, Wade, Wynton and Sunny are from my class went with us. We chose DaYu, a Japanese restaurant because we thought Japanese food would be more similar with Chinese food and many of us loved sushi. The restaurant is at 1912, it cost 150 RMB for each of us. It is one of the most famous Japanese restaurants in Nanjing.
<br />  I’d never been there before, it was my first time to go there. The cooks cooked food in many different ways. Some are baked, some are fried and some are boiled. The cooks were cooking in front of a big board made of iron. The board was very hot and they made the food with two small scoop. The food they made looked good, smelt good, and the most importamt was that the food tasted good. Although some dishes were very simple, such as salmon, it was still great. I didn’t like the environment because it was too noisy and crowded; however, the atmosphere when we were having meal was great. We grade tens learned many things from grade 12 mentors and we had a nice time talking with each other. The service wasn’t good , maybe because there were too many people. I would like to recommend this place to other people because although the service and the environment wasn’t good enough, the food was still delicious.
<br />  I had a wonderful time that night.

I volunteered at Nanjing Library, I helped an American exchange student to learn Chinese,I also volunteered at Nanjing Jimunasi Company.
<br />  From the eleven hours in Nanjing Library, I learnt that books are very useful. There are books about everything and it is not easy to organize them. I found that I wasn’t patient because it was very easy for me to get tierd of checking the order of the books. I learnt it was very important to get everything organized and in the right order so that it would be easier when we need something. In the future, during our work, it will be important if I can put everything in the right place so that I can finish my work effectively because I don't have to spend time looking for what I need. Being a volunteer at Nanjing Library can learn a lot of useful skills.
<br />  From teaching Chinese, I realized the importance of preparing and planning. I found that I could make things easier and I was good at explaining things. But it was often for me to talk about other things off topics. This job helped to practise my speeking so that others can understand my thought easily in the future. It also taught me how to communicate with a person from a different country. I think this job is very meaningful.
<br />  Nanjing Jimunasi Company is an organization that teaches ballet and rhythmic gymnastics. I picked up phones, helped to take the attendance, organized the files and to introduce the organization to people. It taught me how to make notes when answering calls. I learned how to talk to people in a polite and pleasant way to make them want to join the organization. I also learnt how to make a plan with details for a whole day. The experience was very precious.
<br />  Being a volunteer wasn’t easy. I can learn a lot of useful things because the work is form real life and I have to put effort into it if I want it to be great. I learnt many things I can't learn from school and I really appreciate to them.

We went to Le Mistral, a French Restauraut which is very famous in Nanjing. It at the downtown  of the city on the seventh floor of Sofitel. We chose this restaurant for many reasons. First of all, it has a very good chef who is famous for his steak. Secondly, the environment is quite good, it is quiet, neat and also luxury. The service is good, too. The last thing is both Bonnie and I love cheese. Bonnie relishes salmon and I am crazy about the way that French cook snails. I ordered snails and Bonnie ordered salmon. They looked fascinating and they even tasted better! We also tried the famous goose liver paste and it seems to be a little bit strange to me. For the main part we both ordered steak. The steak was very thick , it was hard to cur but it sure tastes good although it got kind of greasy in the end. One special feature of this restaurant is that we can see the kitchen through a glass wall. I can see cooks making food for us. I had a wonderful time that night and I would definitely go there again I will introdce this place to my friends in the future. It was one of the best French meals I have ever had.

The church is on Mochou Road which is very famous in Nanjing city. We chose this church because we are all planning to go to Canada in the future, so we want to learn about the differences of he religions between Chinese and Canadians. The services started from seven in the evening, we got there at seven thirty. I liked it a lot. Many Christians went onto the stage and talked about their stories with father and their consciousness. I found it interesting because their experiences are very different from mine. One old lady told us a story about her and her students ( she is an English teacher in the university), she said she asked one of her students: “What is life for?” Her student answered: “For suffering.” I was surorised by the answers because I never thoutht so, I always think that life is wonderful and I am very lucky to live like this. But they thought they came to the world is to suffer under different challenges, however, she said that was her thought before she met God, now she believes that God will tell her the right thing to do, and she starts to enjoy life and to be appreciated to everything, she also learned how to forgive.  I remembered one sentence “ if we cannot forgive those who fight against us, our blessing father will not forgive us” from the bible. I am not a Christian, but I think this sentence is very correct. I really like the church because people there are all very peaceful and their minds make me calm to consider a lot. Maybe I won't be a Christian but I agree with some principles from the bible, and I will by happier to know about these.

Her job is basically to explain and introduce different antiques. Her job includes explaning to visitors, reception, giving information, prapating knowledges to kids from school, public welfare activities, desigh the website of the museum and give speeches to different classes. During the Shanghai Expo time, four of her colleagues went to work there. She started her job because the love and passion for the ancient artworks and the mysterious storier in the history. There are a lot benefits of this job. She can level up her inside qualities and her stage is high because she always associates with people who are interested in the antiques and have good manners. Also, she can communicate with different types of people, from kids to teens, from army officers to leaders of the coutry, from teashers to pop stars all kinds of people. The drawbacks of this job is when it is holiday, she needs to pay more attention because there are too many people and she never had a two-day weekend. Also, there are a lot of information to memorize and it usually takes her much time to recite the backgrounds of the antiques. She likes a lot of artists, but it is hard for her to choose a favourite because she admires everyone of them. Mostly, the artists she likes are Chinese artists from the ancient China, mainly from Ming and Qing dynasty. She likes he artworks that have poems to go with the paintings. She tells me that to get this jod, you need a certificate for your Mandarin level and you must have a bachelor’s degree, it will be better if your major is history or art and design. The interesting part of this job is to listen from different people of their opinions on the same artwork because there are always very fuuny and creative responses coming out of their heads. She really enjoys introduing the histories of the antiques because this gives her a feeling of success. Although she needs to put a lot effort into reciting the articles, it is still very interesting for her to learn about the stories. She feels happy when she passes the information to others, especially to foreign people because she feels very proud when she sees they are impressed by the amazing artworks. She also faces a lot of diificulties, for example, it is very hard to remember the special Eglish words for the antiques, and she always needs to keep learning because the museum often excahge antiques with outher museums. However, she still really enjoys her job and she finds that it is fascinating that our ancestors have such brilliant ideas to build daily needs. The civilization of the old times also leaves her great impression because the antiques are very exquisite. Among all the different types of antiques, she like jade the best. She thinks jade is so beautiful that when you see through it and she can't imagine how old people sculped the jade son detaily. She loves her job and will keep on doing a good job.

The title of the exhibition is Message From An Alien Space. Th paintings are all painted by a Japanese who named Eitaroh Miyajima and started to have individual exhibitions since 1999, his is also one of the best-known contemporary Japanese painters. Through this exhibition we can know about his unique aesthetic interests, original painting skills as well as the viewpoint on the life and death, global environment protection which the world is facing to. 
<br />One of my favorite paintings is called Spring Has Come, which was painted in 2005. The painting uses acrylic on canvas, just like other his paintings. Eitaroh Miyajima sprinkled some shiny golden powders onto the painting to make it more outstanding. He also drew a lot of polka dots with different colours. There is a piano keyboard on the left side of the artwork, a sun around the top right corner amd some flowers on different parts of the painting. Down at the left corner, he painted some blocks in green. On the top of the keyboard, the artist drew some waves in blue, those waves are not smooth, they have angles. The major parts of the painting are the irregular stripes with soft edges in colours the are mostly pink series. There are some small shapes in the detail parts of the artwork in different colours.
<br />The artwork makes me feel very delightful and makes me think about a situation with warm creatures and confortable colours. The artwork doesn't remind me of other things I hve seen or experienced. Spring Has Come gives me a soft, harmonious and balanced feeling, the composition is a little bit messy but it can make people feel happy, just like spring, a season full of surprise and random things. Also, spring is a season which people all enjoy a lot. I think Eitaroh Miyajima’s intention is to show people the beautiful and wondergul feeling for spring, when everything wake up and we should be appreciate it.
<br />I think this artwork is very successful because it expressed the right feeling of spring at the bottom of my heart. It is absolutely a great artwork. The stripes in the middle of the painting make me think the artwork is good specifically because it is soft and smooth, the colours he used for the srtipes are gentle and gives people joy when people looking at it, that’s why I think it is successful. I would buy it if I can because it can make room more colourful and active.

We danced and sang a song from my favourite singer, Miley Cyrus. Teachers asked every class to act out a performance during the concert, Bonnie and I used the Hoedown Throwdown tone and the dance moves for our student union election, so we chose it as we were told to prepare a performance. It was a country song which had a country dance to match with. The song was easy to sing and the dance was not complicated, either. I felt very excited about it because I really like the song and the dance is very unique, it is the kind of dance I have tried before, so it is easier for me to teach them. I learned that it is not easy to lead a team, especially when not everyone is professional. I tried very hard to teach them the dance, they tried hard to remember the moves and we all put a lot effort into the performance. I also learned that when we gathered together, we usually talked too much, and we did not have a high efficiency. We faced many difficulties, for example, it was not easy to unify everyone’s moves. Also, we all had different things to deal with , so we didn't have much time to reherse together. We only had three days to prepare for the show. Everybody was nervous and not confident to remember all the moves and the orders of the moves in onky three days. However, a good result came at last for wo fought so hard to get it done. The response was great and we all felt very happy about it and we think we deserve it.

<br />  When I played tennis, I learned that I can respond very fast, but I can accurately measure the distance between the tennis ball and myself. I also learned that basic skills are very important, otherwise it is very hard to go further. Another insight is that practising is very necessary, when we repeat our moves for many times, we don’t need to respond to the ball, it bacomes to our nature. The connections between my experience and what I learned are changing plans when situation changes. The tennis ball never comes at the same route, sometimes it changes the path just in front of me, than it is important to change the way to hit the ball. Just like in real life, when something unexpected happened, we can’t stick to our old plans, changing is important. Tennis has a lot of benefits, too. I can practice to move faster and to see things with eyes more accrately. My personal fitness goals are to learn a popular sport in western country and practise my ability to rspond to diferent things. However, it is easy to get hurt during this kind of sport. We can’t keep playing for a long time because it very drastic. Also, if we play it for a long time, it will make our right arms thicker than the left ones. Anyways, I really like this sport.
<br />  When I did rhythmic gymnastic, I learned that the flexibility of different body parts is very important, as well as the balance of the body. I realized that if I want to do better, thinck is very important. In rhythmic gymnastic, we can’t only remember the instructions coaches gave to us, we need to find the knack by ourselves because different people have different habitts to finish the moves, we can’t rely too much on somebody. This is the same when we are finishing our work in our real life. We need to think and finish most of the work by ourselves because we don't know what will happen to others. My personal fitness goals for this sport are to learn something that common people don't know and to build my bady shape at the same time. Although it is an interesting sport, it is so easy to get hurt during the training time. We need to warm up very carefully and it is important to know whether you can do it or not because it is too easy too break somewhere. I started to do rhythmic gymnastic since I was nine and it my favourite sport.
<br />  I ride bike to school every day. I learned that it is easy for me to think about other things when I am riding because I always get into crashes and it hard for me to realized that I have crashed on somebady until I have done it. The insight I gained is to focus on what I am doing, otherwise it will be dangerous both for me and for others. The same idea in real life. Sometimes the whole project is broken may be a small careless mistake, so it is important to focus. My fitness goal for this sport is to exercise every day. I spend one hour on my way back and forth the school. I think it is an easy but not so safe activity.

		<document id="7961e911d60499faa8aaf4fde99ebde3" url=""><![CDATA[School Club/ Organization<br/><br/>GCA has plenty of clubs, I attended some of them. I joined Skateboarding Club, MUN Club and  Marketing Team. 
<br />  Skateboarding Club was the first club I attended, I learned that this club was created by Toland and Only from Grade 12 and we have a coach who goes to school in Shanghai but used to be a GCA student. The idea of creating this club is to make skateboarding more popular because in China, it is still a aport for a small group of people. Skateboarding is fun and can exercise at the same time, also the back of the skateboard has connections with art. The insights I gained about myself during this process is that I am the kind of person who is not afraid of falling down and I would like to take risks. We needed to listen to our club leaders, otherwise it was easy for us to get hurt. The club strenghth was that every member was active and liked to talk a lot. The weakness was that sometimes we got too noisy and might miss some instructions from the leaders. We bought our precious skateboards during the first activity and we learned how to skateboard during the following club activities. Now I have many ways to go out, including skateboarding. GCA students all have a chance to know more about the popular sport in North America and have one more way to make me look very cool. My personal fitness goal is to get something that I like and can exercise my body at the same time, skateboardind is absolutely one of the sports that matches my goal. However, it difficult for us to find a right place to practise because we might crash on other people, the nphysical limitaion is a big problem.
<br />  MUN Club is a club that stands for Model United Nations. JJ is the club leader and he created this club for more people to get to know about Model United Nations and take part in Model United Nations. Insights I gained during this process is that I am still not confortable enough to speak in front of hundreds of people and I don't have many ideas to improve different situations. We needed a high level English and could give random speeches in a short time. We also needed to be infected when we gave speeches and we should pay attention to others’ thoughts. The strenghth of this club was that everyone could speak and use English well, but the weakness was that we didn’t have too many people, so it was a littler bit boring when we had meetings. I attended HMUN China in March which was held by Harvard University. I was the delegate of Bahrain in WHO. I realized when I communicate with other delegates, I had to try my best to increase my country’s profits and I couldn't compromise easily, just like in real life. I also learned how to talk organized and orderly. I used the skills I used in the speech competion before. GCA could be more famous through this kind of events and I would get a lot of practice, including how to write different types of papers. The HMUN left me a deep impression.
<br />  Marketing Team is a club that works directly for Mr. Gallinelli. We helped with parent teacher meeting, GCA newspaper and GCA newstudents. The insights I gained during the process was that I was not very good at translating, sometimes I knew what that meant but I couldn't translate it into Chinese. To be a member of Marketing team, good Enlish is necessary because we always have a lot of Englich work to do. Also, we can't be nervous when we are standing on the stage because we need to translate for teachers when they need. The strenghth of this club is we can improve our English, the weakness is that we there is work to do, we usually become too busy that sometimes we can't finish our homework in a high quality. In the club, I translated on the parent teacher meeting, I translated for the GCA newspaper and I helped with the writing papers. Marketing Team trained my trslating skills and my ability to respond fast, they made me outstanding when I attented outher events. This club helped GCA to become a place with more fun. To me, it really trained me to be more confident and confortable on the stage.

The exihibition took place at Nanjing Culture Art Center. I went there by myself in the afternoon at about three o’clock. 
<br />  ACG stands for animations, comics and games. I am interested in these kind of things, so I chose this event. The exhibition lasted three days and thousands of people attended, there was a contest of cospalying at the same time. I liked the exihibition although there were too many people and it was so crowded that I couldn’t see the stage clearly, but it was still very eciting because I saw many cosers dressing up as my favourite cartoon characters. There were a lot of games hled for the visitors. We could see different cosplay teams act out their performances and some are fascinating. There were also many stalls selling souvenirs, models, disks, cups, mouserugs, cushions and clothes from the comics. I saw a gril wore a checked skirt in black and red, a pair of black boot and a black vest on top, she was cosplaying Nana from NANA, one of my favourite anmations, I very excited to see that. Most of the characters that people were cosplaying were from Japanese cartoons, but there are roles from Chinese cartoons, too. I took a picture with Grey Wolf, one of the most famous and loved cartoon images right now in China. 
<br />  I will go to this kind of exhibitions again if there will be one in the future.

<br />I have volunteered at Nanjing Jimunasi Company before, so it was not hard for me to do the work. This time, I tried something new. Since I have learned rythmic gymnasitc there for seven years, I was the coach’s assistant. I worked with kids who were five to ten. I found that kids between that ages were so annoying that I wanted to cover my ears. I have to face them with patience because it was very easy for them to cry. They always had fuuny moves and interesting words. The insights I gained during this work is that I am not a person with much patience and I usually how to confort little kids. I thought I liked children before I attended this work. My coach taught me many skills to deal with small kids, for example, when I was talking to them, I should soften my voice and bent down my body to make the same hight with the kids, I also needed to smile to them, otherwise they would be nervous to talk to me. I also had many duties. Since they were small kids, I needed to take them to the bathroom and make sure they wouldn’t hurt themselves. I also needed to tell them when they should take off their jackets and si on. From the Howlland Quiz that I was told I could be a kindergarten teacher, after this, I am pretty sure I won't be a kindergarten teacher now, however, this job taught me how to solve problems with children in the future. I liked this experience although it was not that enjoyable.
<br />I also volunteered at Nanjing Museum this time. I started to prepare for it one month ago. I learned a lot about the history of Nanjing silk, which is a unique technology that only Nanjing has it and it still can’t be replaced by electronic machines right now. The insights I gained from this job was that I really liked to procrastinate. I had a lot of information to memorize before a certain day, but I started to do it only one day befor the test. I felt frustrated about that. The skills I neede for this work was to be polite, confident and aware of the antiques. I also needed to translate the information to English by myself. My duties were to lead people to visit and tell them the backgounds or the stories of the silk. There was a huge machine to make the fancywork, it was my job to explain to the visitors that how this kind of machine work. This work really trained me a lot and I could learn at the same time. I really liked this volunteer work.
<br />For the parent teacher meeting that held in GCA, it spent a busy afternoon. I didn’t translate for the teachers but there was other work to be done. I needed to tell lost parents the right way, I organized the table in the cafeteria, I also needed to time for the teachers. I learned it was hard to organize such a big meeting, every small step was important, so a careful paln was necessary. I need to be polite anfd be aware of what was happening around the campus, when teachers needed help, I should be right beside them. It was not a confortable job, and we needed to cooperate with other students because school was big and parents were everywhere. This taught me how to behave in such big events and I learned how to do the proposal for big activities, I think I will be useful in the future.

		<document id="1e12a8ad8ce0b82a3f3cd0a79a084a22" url=""><![CDATA[Physical Activities, 2010 Summer<br/><br/>During this summer, I took part in two different types of physical activities. I tried tennis and rhythmic gymnastic. I also attended a rhythmic gymnastic contest and got the 17th place nation wide.?When I played tennis, I found out that responding fast is very important and I can do well in that. Although I still can't measure the distance between the tennis ball and myself well, I've improved from last several months.Also, the basic skills are very significant when I was playing tennis, and I think I've learned better than before. Since I've already known that practice is very necessary, I spent many hours practicing with my coach. Many times we even practice without tennis balls, it slowly became our nature. What I've learned from the experience I've earned was that we need to change plans as quickly as possible when situation changes. The tennis ball will never come through the same path, sometimes it started to go curves just in front of me, so that changing my moves will determine whether I will hit the ball or not. The same as my living experiences, when situations change at the last minute, we can’t keep on what we were planning to do, transition is important. Tennis has plenty of other benefits, too. I can practice to make my decision right away by make up my thoughts within a very short time. My personal fitness goals were to learn a popular sport in western country and practice my capability of responding, and I didn't change. That's why I chose to play tennis this summer. Meanwhile, this sport is easy to get hurt and keep playing for a long time is not a brilliant idea because it very drastic and it usually gets really hot in summer since it is one of the outdoor sports. Furthermore, we will strengthen our right arms a lot by playing tennis and it will break the balance between our two arms. ?When I did rhythmic gymnastic, I really put a lot of effort into it since I was going to participate in one of the most important contests in our country. I learned that the flexibility isn't the most important feature in this kind of sport, the balance of the body and the turns are also significant. I realized that if I wanted to do better, I needed to use my brain to think about my moves.Remembering the instructions that coaches gave us wasn't enough. We needed to think about the moves and find the tricks by ourselves because different people have different habits and advantages of their bodies, we can’t rely too much on coaches. This shares the same experiences when we are finishing our work in our real life. We need to fulfill  most of the work by ourselves since we don't know what will happen to others. My personal fitness goals for this sport are to learn a special skill that common people don't specialize in and build my body shape at the same time. Rhythmic Gymnastic stimulates me a lot, meanwhile, it is so easy to get hurt during the training time. Warming up carefully always decides if we will break ourselves or not, and it is important to make sure we are not doing something dangerous since some moves look easy to finish but they actually are on very high levels. I started to do rhythmic gymnastic since I was nine and it has been my favorite sport since then. 
<br />I learned a lot this summer and these two sports enriched my vacation life.

I chose to watch this performance because I really liked the author of this story, who also created one of the most popular TV series called Wulinwaizhuan. Anyways, the show started at seven thirty, and guess what? I met Bonnie, again. 
<br />  The show didn’t disappoint me at all, it was fabulous. It was a story about a woman who was very material, and all she cared was money. When she found out that her brich boyfriend was actually already married, she became poor, with only her luxury bags and a big house. She met a man who came to rent her house. He was thrifty, and cared a lot about details, which the girl didn’t like. However, a happy and weird life started between them when they started to live together. The girl always said that people would lost twenty-one grams when they died, so there was a saying that people’s souls weighed twenty-one grams. She thought her soul was valueless, and she was not greedy, she only wanted a twenty-one karat diamond to fix the mass she was going to lose after she died. The man eventually found that the girl had a kind and nice heart, the girl also found that the man was humorous and warm-hearted, and they fell in love in the end. 
<br />  I fell for this show not only because of the funny lines and interesting moves, but also its meaning about life and how real love was different from desire. Ningcaisheng, the author, absolutely surprised me again. I will go to his show again next time.

		<document id="66be0e4a546397215aa4954166a294b8" url=""><![CDATA[Volunteer at Nanjing Museum, 2010-2011<br/><br/>Nanjing Museum was one of the most important and famous museums in China. The construction itself was directed by Sicheng Leung, who was one of the most talented architects in Chinese history. Having a chance to become a volunteer guide in Nanjing Museum was a great honor and I learned a lot from this experience.
<br />  I applied to become a guide in the August of 2010. I received some documents from the employee and she told me I needed to recite all of them. The documents were almost about the history of Nanjing Museum and the antiques of all different pavilions. There were Jade Pavilion, Pottery Pavilion, Bronze Ware Pavilion, Silk Jacquard Pavilion and some other pavilions. Among all the pavilions, I chose the one with the most “Nanjing” feature, Silk Jacquard Pavilion. 
<br />  Silk Jacquard is a class of richly decorative shuttle-woven fabrics, often made in colored silk with gold and silver threads. In ancient times, only royal families and upper-class people had the right to wear clothes made by silk Jacquard. To be more specific, only Nanjing had the technique and the right to fabricate this type of brocade. Silk Jacquard is now the only method of fabrication that can’t be replace by machines. I chose to get to know those precious antiques because I am proud of being a Nanjingnese. 
<br />  After two tests on my knowledge and my mandarin ability, I was verified to be part of Nanjing Museum. My job was easy. I needed to explain the history and making method of silk Jacquard to visitors who looked confused and interested in those beautiful fabrics. Sometimes there were kids who were willing to know about silk Jacquard but they were so curious that they kept asking “why” and “how”. Honestly, I wasn’t a professor, and I didn’t know everything. Fortunately, there were two workers staying with me. They were two middle aged ladies who started to learn how to fabricate silk Jacquard about thirty years ago. They were very familiar with their jobs and when they were working, they looked so amazing. A big machine was put at the middle of the pavilion and you could see the fabulous fabrics coming out of the machine and you just could not take your eyes off their hands. In that case, I had one more job, that was to help the ladies to sell their product. 
<br />  From this volunteering experience, I learned how to communicate with all different types of people. There were foreign tourists that I needed to talk to them with English, there were young visitors who graduated from great universities and had unique perspectives, there were also free elder people who were fascinated by silk Jacquard. Not only got to meet all kinds of people, but also widen my own horizons and history knowledges when studying silk Jacquard. I have gained a lot from this working experience and what I’ve seen would help me in the future when I go overseas. I would like to continue this job and maybe transfer to another pavilion next month.

The exhibition was held by Bang of Beijing in Qixia Temple. Qixia Temple was famous because of the three skull of three buddhas. Sakyamun of course was the most crucial one, since he was the person who created buddhism. To see the skull of Sakyamun is a great honor, and I was excited about it. Although I don’t really have a religion, but Qixia Temple is a place where my family and I will go every year, and to see the skulls was never permitted before. It was a great chance, and I appreciated it. 
<br />  The three skulls were put on three different holders that made of gold. I had to say that the holders were beautiful, especially when shining under sunshine. The holder was like a pyramid without the top pointy part. Some jewelry was inlayed on the hodler, and the whole object gave people a feeling of  resplendent. One the middle holder was part of the skull of Sakyamun. It was small, only about three cube centimeters. It looked like a gem, with yellow spheres reflecting lights. The color was light brown, and the shape wasn’t regular at all. I couldn’t take a close look at it because they were blocked from visitors. Also, we were not suppose to take pictures, since the flash light might damage the precious bone. In addition, in buddhism, people needed to show respect to buddhas, taking pictures was one the rude reactions. 
<br />  Many people were praying in front of the skulls. I guess they were making wishes, or asking for something. After the exhibition, I met one of the monks in the temple, Shuguang. He was a high-level monk, which in Chinese was Gaoseng. My mother and I went to the exhibition basically because of my grandfather. My grandfather passed away a week ago, my mother was so upset. She wanted to talk to one of the Gaosengs so that maybe she could feel more peaceful and understood “death” better. Shuguang was a monk full of intelligent, both my mother and I felt better after talking to him. I was glad we came to this exhibition, and I did feel more powerful in fromt of the skull of Sakyamun. 
<br />  This exhibition left me with strong impression, since it was the first I had seen a real Sheli. Before I had only heard about it. It wasn’t similar to what I thought it would be, but honestly, it was beautiful. I liked the atmosphere there. Visitors were all quiet and paid respect to buddhas. I could feel their faith and this feeling made me feel strong. I have decided that I will go to Qixia Temple more often, to just appease my heart. By the way, maple trees on Qixia Mountain are the most famous attraction in falls, going there for a trip during the falls would be a great journey.

<br />  I started a Fashion Club this year. My plan was to hold a fashion show if possible, however, it turned out to be stucked at the middle of preparation. Nevertheless, I did organize some events. The biggest one was the dance we performed on the Halloween party. My members and I decided to show ourselves on the party, and a dance might be a great choice. We chose to perform Nu ABO by my favorite girl group, f(x). Nu ABO was a song with strong tempo and special tone. The dance moves were unique, too. I learned the dance by music video and live performances by myself. It wasn’t easy, honestly. Luckily, eleven -year experience of dancing made the process not too hard. I had the habit of memorizing different dance moves and I could find the trick of those moves due to my previous experience. The most difficult challenge was to teach my members. There were five of us performing this dance, and three of us had not danced before. I wasn’t worried about Ellyn because I met due to dancing programmes seven years ago. Bonnie, who seemed to show up in every single one of my article, had learned dancing for about two months when she was little and then quitted with no doubt. Mandy, a girl almost had not done any kind of sports, joined us because of her love for f(x). Bella, a girl seemed had danced before but not, took part in due to the same reason with Mandy. I had to admit that interest was an amazing feature. Mandy and Bella was enthusiastic about our show and they spent a lot of time exploring those moves. When we finished learning all the dance moves, we still had to figure out our position. I wanted to give them more chances to show themselves, so I made everyone stand in the front for some time. The performance was great and we won a lot of applause. This event taught me how to lead a team well and being patient was essential.
<br />  Also, just like last year, I am still a member of the Marketing Team, which officially changed its name to SAPC (Student Association of Publication and Communication). One of our jobs is to make our GCA newspaper, which now has a name called GCA Times. This year, I had my specific role in the newspaper. My job was to write brief introductions about latest music and movies. It was fun for me because I paid attention to entertainment part a lot. We also translated for the parent teacher meeting. I was Ms. Garret’s translator in the big meeting during the first parent teacher meeting in grade eleven. I missed the second one because I had to take my SAT courses during that time. These events helped me to improve my writing skills. I could have many chances to write and to translate. Those could accumulate experiences for me.
<br />  Next year I am planning to join Leadership Group, since I realize that knowing how to be a leader is important in my future life.

Although I am still a teenager, I really like to spend times with younger kids. They are so adorable in my eyes, both their hearts and appearances. Also, they make me laugh all the time. Due to this reason, I decided to do volunteer work for kids.
<br />  I got my first chance when my rhythmic gymnastic coach complained about her tight schedule. She just flew back from Paris and hoped that she could get more rest before staring her work. So, I got this opportunity to spend some time with little girls who were five or six year old. I had known them before because we needed to share training space from time to time. However, I hadn’t talk to them much. I could not remember all their names. My job was to teach them a set of ball (one of the items from rhythmic gymnastics). These moves were easy for me since I had done them eight years ago. I had to admit that girls. especially young girls, were noisy. They could see each other only once a week, so they couldn’t stop chatting. The topics, of course had nothing with rhythmic gymnastics, were basically about “what stupid things my classmates did” or “what funny shows I watched last nigh”. I was ignored by them sometimes. I wanted to be nice and gentle, however, the situation didn’t allow me to be like that. I screamed at them once and the volume  immediately went down to zero. I tried to make my face look as serious as I can, and it seemed to work a little bit. I finished coaching them after four hours, and I realized that my coach must be very tired every time after her lesson.
<br />  My second chance came when Bonnie, leader of volunteering club, told me about the tutoring and helping the kids of not native workers. Those kids were gathered and put into an elementary that didn’t have high technology tools or big pretty campus. We discussed about this and decided to help them. On April the second , Bonnie, Mandy, Kenny, Gordon, Jackson, Yolanda, Ereal and some other classmates went to Star Light Elementary School with three bags of snacks and eight packs of books. Our job was to play with the kids and teach them some English songs. The kids were from grade four and they were more active than we expected. We first taught them how to sing “Twinkle Twinkle” because of their school. Then we taught them “Head, Shoulder, Knees and Toes”. They were interested in these songs. Next came the peak of the day. We started to play “Hangman”. I thought about easy words like “supermarket” or “panda”. It was funny when I asked them which part of China was famous for pandas, and everyone of them answered “Sichuan” loudly, only Bonnie shouted “Beijing” with a even bigger voice. Her expressions were hilarious when she found out that only herself got this question wrong. We spent five hours with these kids and I had a really great time.
<br />  I’ve always wanted to have a career that relates to kids in the future, and these two volunteering experiences taught me how to communicate with kids at different ages. I as appreciated to these chances, and I hope that I can have more similar opportunities in the future.

Jiming Temple is one of the most famous and important temples in Nanjing. Since it is a temple, it is of course for buddhism. My family doesn’t have a certain religion, buddhism is the one we pay most attention to. In that case, I am more familiar with temples and buddhas. However, I haven’t Jiming Temple before, so Bonnie and I decided to visit there during the sakura season.  
<br />  Unfortunately, we missed the sakura season. We were late for a week. Nevertheless, Jiming Temple was still an attraction without those pretty flowers. The main buddha in Jiming Temple is the Buddha of Herb, which means when people get sick or don’t feel well, Jiming Temple is a good place to pray for people who believe in buddhism. We went there in the afternoon, so the sunshine was rich and the breeze made us feel comfortable. The constructions were all old Chinese style temples, with many colors and wooden columns. We saw monks holding a ceremony. We didn’t interrupt because it would be rude to buddha for being a disturbance. 
<br />  I liked Jiming Temple for basically two reasons. First of all, it was quiet there. Everyone taled at a low volume and the light music was comforting. Secondly, the monks there were very kind and nice. They smiled a lot and made you feel peaceful. I would probably go there more often in the future if I have time.

		<document id="fbac13d06d1778e9322d8440fce046fd" url=""><![CDATA[Physical Activities, 2010-2011<br/><br/>“You look sporty.” I’ve heard a lot of similar comments since I was only six. The funny part was that I’ve never been slim, but I’ve always been “sporty”. Yes, I am. I stared dancing when I was only five. Besides running, I am okay to do almost every kind of sport. Among all types of sports I’ve done, rhythmic gymnastics were absolutely the best ones.
<br />  Firstly, I fell in love with rhythmic gymnastics seven years ago. It is the kind of sport that needs flexibility, balance ability, strength and sense at the same time. This year I am going to take part in the National Youth Rhythmic Gymnastics Contest, so I am preparing for it now. It usually takes me three days to learn a set and months to practice. This time, since the set was harder than before, my coach spent more time with me to create these sets. I needed one set for the ball, one for the ribbon, and one for the rope. From doing rhythmic gymnastics, I learned that importance of practicing. After many times of practice, I could turn to be almost automatic, so that there wouldn’t be any mistakes. I had to throw the equipment and catch it after two or three rows. In that case, I had to respond to spontaneous changes very fast. It trained my respond ability. For example, in daily life, I am always the first one to react among all my friends. Also, by taking part in different competitions, I have trained a strong heart now. I also learned to be resistent, since I really needed to come over many challenges during the process. I could be exhausted and tired, but I had to keep repeating the same part. I have shaped my strong personality by rhythmic gymnastics. Not only it is a helpful sport, but I also like it a lot.
<br />  Secondly, biking also helped me. Riding from home to school might not be a long trip, but I taught me to enjoy the views on the way. My family and I moved to live downtown in winter and spring. In every Spring, sakura flowers blossoms and I had to go through the most famous street for sakura flowers. I learned that you were responsible for yourself. For example, when you are riding a bike, it is you who is going to get hurt if you fall down carelessly. In that case, be responsible to yourself is important. Biking also taught me that we could find it enjoyable from things we needed to do every day. 
<br />  I am planning to start my tennis again. I stopped this term because I didn’t have much time. However, I found out that tennis would be a very popular sport in western countries. Also, I want to learn horse riding when I have spare time in the future. Horse ring looks so elegant that I am looking forward to trying this kind of sport. I hope that I can have more chances to exercise next year.

This year is even better than last year, since we had to eat at two foreign restaurants. This time, I chose Wangping Steak and Tacos.
<br />  Wangping Steak is owned by Yongqing Wang, the richest man in Taiwan. His head chef developed the special steak called Taisu Steak which was fully cooked, but tasted like pink without blood. They also served French style lobster. I ordered Sea and Land Meal, which included a smaller portion of Taisu and a smaller portion of filet fish. I ordered this because I got to try both. I really liked the food there because it was so tasty. The atmosphere was great, too. Everyone was talking at a very low volume and the environment was clean and neat. The menu started with appetizer and finished with drinks. We needed to choose one item under each category. I went there with my parents on Valentines’s day, so they served wine for free that day. The store was located on Central Road, in a mall called Nanjing International Plaza. I would definitely go again if I have time and I will recommend this restaurants. 
<br />  Tacos, just like its name, was a restaurant that served Mexican food. I went there with Bonnie, Ereal and Charlotte on the day we finished our mid-term exam. This time I ordered some cooked rice with cheese, tomato sauce and sausages on top. The meal was okay, not as good as I expected. Maybe I didn’t like Mexican food very much. THe atmosphere was fine. There weren’t too many people at the environment was bright since we sitted beside big windows. I would recommend people to go there and try, but if you’ve already went, then it does’t worth a second visit to me. 
<br />  I’m looking forward to my next year’s Cultural Awareness, and I want to try more fabulous food.

It was an exhibition about photography. It was called “Wei Ye Animal-photographing Exhibition”. Wei Ye was the photographer, who was a young talented Chinese artist. The exhibition was held in 3 Coffee. Just like its name, 3 Coffee was a cafe on Qingdao Road. 
<br />  The cafe was a three-floor old building which has been there since twentieth century. The architecture had red-brick walls and white window frames. It was an European style building and it wasn’t big. There were only about eight tables inside. The exhibition was held there.
<br />  There were photos taken by Wei Ye all over the wall. Those pieces of art work looked warm under the dark yellow light in the cafe. There were more than ten kinds of animals shown in Wei’s pictures, including a flock of moose and a pair of buffalos, which left me the most impression. There were also many birds in the pictures. Since I personally hated birds a lot, I didn’t pay much attention to them. However, we could see that Wei had a special vision when he was photographing. His works gave us a feeling of peace and warm although the animals were in the motion. Most of Wei’s pictures were taken on the grassland or water during the time of sunset or sunrise. Because the coffee shop was tiny, we could take a very close look at those beautiful pictures. 
<br />  Now I am going to talk about my favorite piece from the exhibition. The photo didn’t officially had a name, either did other ones. Wei didn’t even give his show a specific name. It was the one that made to posters and the cover of the souvenirs. I that picture, a flock of moose were taking a walk. Most of their body parts were covered by the high grass. However, their heads and the significant horns were obvious in the picture. The sunshine fell from the sky and colored the moose with gentle yellow. This photo really showed a quiet and peaceful feeling. I fell in love with this piece of work immediately at the first sight. 
<br />  In all, the exhibition was enjoyable and I really liked it, especially when you were having tasty drinks while you were exploring in the world of photography. Wei’s photos motivated me to travel around the world to see those attracting view. I would love to see the lakes with small waves cause by the wind, or the adorable little foxes running around their mother, or the zebras lining beside a narrow river. Nature is powerful, but sometimes she is as gentle and kind as our mother.  
<br />  After enjoying those wonderful art works, Bonnie and I stayed there for another half an hour. I liked the atmosphere there, and guests were all talking at a low volume, which made me feel more comfortable than many other coffee shops. I would like to go to 3 Coffee again and have a cup of hot hot chocolate and lie on the couch to take a nap. Both the exhibition and the cafe left me with strong impression.

I wanted to be part of it, however, I wasn’t good at singing at all. In addition, they didn’t accept dancing program this time. In order to get involved, my best friend Bonnie and I decided to take the audition of MCs.
<br />  MC, which also means hosts, requires fast reactions and energetic expressions. Bonnie and I were two of the most active students in school, and we were full of enthusiasm. We passed the audition without any surprise, since we were the only group signed up. Also, we had fluent English that could express our thoughts properly. However, it was the first that we had been hosts, and we were nervous about it. It took us more than three hours to figure out what we were going to say and how we were going to act. Fortunately, we had come up with some brilliant ideas, and since the singers were our friends, we didn’t have a hard time. 
<br />  The event was a big success, at least in my mind. Everyone was paying attention and the atmosphere was quite good. From this event, I learned that working as a team is both necessary and useful. I had some wonderful ideas, and Bonnie had other fabulous thoughts. It worked perfectly fine when we put them all together. We were happy to be part of GCA Idol and if there if any a chance in the future, I would love to be involved again as a MC.
