Living with arthritis can be quite an overwhelming experience. However, the advice in this article will make it easier. This article will teach you valuable techniques that will help you manage, treat, and live with arthritis.<br /><br />Try to lose a couple of pounds. If you are overweight your arthritis is likely worse than it would be otherwise. Too much weight causes more joint strain, and that is what causes the painful flareups. Shedding some pounds can lessen how many times you have a episode, so losing that weight might be what you need.<br /><br />If you can help it do not take pain-killers to deal with your pain. Prescriptions pain pills are often addictive and are used to temporarily treat your pain. Use painkillers only as directed and only under a doctor's care.<br /><br />During a flare-up, it is important that you do not exercise. Even though this is normally helpful, during a flare-up, it could be damaging. Exercise is for keeping your joints healthy and flexible, not fighting arthritis pain as it occurs. You should hold off on any exercise until your joints calm back down.<br /><br />Maintain a journal. This record might give you some insight on what kinds of behaviors or actions are triggering arthritis flare-ups. Make sure you also take note of time of day, weather conditions and location to find other natural causes for your symptoms.<br /><br />The goal is to seek out a solution that will make the arthritis symptoms easier to deal with, while stopping your joints from getting any more damaged. Pain treatment helps the pain only and doesn't treat your condition, it can actually worsen it.<br /><br />When you feel arthritis setting in, get an early diagnosis. Early diagnosis and treatment will be beneficial in preventing future problems. This helps reduce damage on your joints which means less pain. It sometimes is the case that a doctor misinterprets your symptoms and thus misdiagnoses you. If you are told no by a doctor yet the symptoms persist, a second opinion is in order.<br /><br />It is possible that you could benefit from a professional counselor who is trained with emotional issues involved in arthritis. A chronic illness, like arthritis, can lead to emotional issues, such as depression. Counselors with specialized training will know how to direct you toward the tools you need, while keeping your emotional health in mind.<br /><br />It is a good idea to rest and relax every so often. Remember if you have an active day planned, you may experience stiffness and pain which will slow you down. Rest at various intervals during the day to re-energize and meditate.<br /><br />A nice walk after eating your evening meal is a good idea. Going for a regular walk after dinner can help you feel better and give you more energy throughout your evening. Even just a very short walk with one of your friends or family members can improve your health. This can also allow you to have some social time with this person.<br /><br />Rheumatoid arthritis can lead to unwanted weight loss. Being in pain, along with the chemical changes that the condition inflicts on the body, are the main culprits behind this problem. Therefore RA patients should be especially careful to check their diet for nutritional content, in order to keep from losing weight.<br /><br />This may not be a cure for arthritis, but these simple daily changes can result in stopping some of the common causes for the issue. Many people develop the problem because of everyday things, such as posture or the way they walk. With this article, you can begin to change these activities into something that can, instead, shield your joints from a lifetime of pain.
