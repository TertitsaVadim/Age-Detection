These sailors weren't too far from the truth, as mermaids have always served as a nexus for incomprehensible, impossible and irrational power--a threat to the merchant order that sent men onto the seas. An impossible hybrid of human and animal worlds, mermaids represent a plunge into the sacred unconscious, the nourishing and inundating parallel universe of dreams. The siren's song urges mankind to transgress the culture of rational, known identities and explore unconscious oceans of dreams, inebriation, lust and death. Typically, the Freudian view postulates the fish tail as a phallic symbol, which merely indicates that mermaids possess a virility, independence, wisdom and capability usually reserved (by culture) for the male. Nonetheless, the Greek language demonstrates a connection between pesce and pussy: delphis meaning large fish and delphys meaning uterus/vulva--a link noted by Aristotle and Hippocrates. Alchemists saw mermaids as a midpoint in the transformation from consciousness to unconsciousness.
<br /><br />Metaphysically, the mermaid metaphor hybridizes consciousness and subconsciousness--what we know and recognize rising out of the mind's surface (shaped as a woman), and what we do not know descending into the depths (shaped as a fish). The mermaid can pull us into the depths, guide us into an alien world. Mermaids are on the cusp of the physical abyss of the ocean and the psychological abyss of the inner mind.
<br /><br />So mermaids are special countercultural figures, hybrids that belong to neither animal nor human worlds and who serve as guides to a world of dreams and freedoms--a more animal man, a more sentient animal, dangerously liberated either way. Transgressors of rationality, linked not to earth but to the sea, they are more unstable, more changeable, more hysterical, more unreliable than terrestrial things. Mermaids are not &quot;earthy&quot; but &quot;oceanic.&quot; Sirens seduce one into madness--away from lofty thoughts of the superego, away even from the earthly thoughts of the libido, going into the nether realms of the subconscious. Mermaids create new terms for state of being--&quot;ocean consciousness&quot;--as alien as &quot;mushroom consciousness&quot; or &quot;peyote consciousness&quot;--and also suggesting a drug experience. But which drug?
<br /><br />How does one access mermaid consciousness?
<br />By following the siren's song.
<br /><br />But what is the real world analog of this song?
<br />What is the real world gateway to mermaid lands?
<br /><br />Consider: The sound of ocean waves, seagull cries, hallucinogenic seafood, frog or toad toxins, blue water lily, the Wiccan brew of belladonna/henbane/mandrake/datura...
<br /><br />As an analog to the mermaid realms, the faerie world is accessed by ingestion of the magic mushroom, fungus being a clear part of most faerie lore and culture. Faeries gather around toadstools deep in forests, and humans are sometimes said to go there--to participate in their world. Yet there is no clear folkloric relationship between mermaid culture and psychedelic drugs, no sacred experience meant to honor a cult of the mermaid, and visitations usually move from magic to mundane worlds. This paucity of information about mermaid culture makes sense; historically, man has had no experience of oceanic life. Man has lived in the mountains, the icelands, the forests, the deserts, the coasts--but not in the sea. Humans only experience the surface of the ocean. We ride on the surface and dip into the water to pull things out. When we see a rock or a fin or a figure rising above the surface, we know something is below. Other than that, the ocean is a cipher, concealing everything from cities to sirens.1 If humans had lived in the sea, rather than on land, then there would be greater need for an access (folkloric or pharmacological) to the depths. Mermaids seem especially alien because few humans have thought to have more than a passing acquaintance with the oceanic world. Fishermen are the most likely sources of cultic activity relating to mermaids, just as they are the most frequent sources of mythical lore. Lack of knowledge with undersea life would explain why there are no clear visions extant of oceanic kingdoms or sea sabbats.
<br /><br />However, there are numerous stories of mermaids becoming fully human and losing the ability to rejoin their mermaid life, suggesting that some humans (ex-mermaids) know the loss of oceanic flow state, a kind of comedown from a cosmic consciousness. These mermaids come out of a hallucination that they view as more real than the real world--more fulfilling, more encompassing, more empowering than mundane, demeaning society. The Mediterranean and European cradle of mermaid lore certainly had access to such fluxing worlds through the solanaceous drugs belladonna, henbane, datura and mandrake. According to Schultes, all &quot;have long histories of use as hallucinogens and magic plants connected with sorcery, witchcraft, and superstition. The extraordinary reputation of these plants is due primarily to the bizarre psychoactivity which they posess&quot; (86). Schultes notes that the major psychoactive chemical in these drugs is scopolamine, which &quot;induces an intoxication followed by narcosis in which hallucinations occur during the transition state between consciousness and sleep&quot; (86).
<br /><br />Shapeshifting hallucinations may have frequently accompanied intoxication from an ointment created by European witches from belladonna, henbane, datura and mandrake. Michael Harner discusses werewolf phenomena as a result of such drug combinations. And more significantly for mermaid lore, Gallileos scientific colleague Porta reported in 1589 that under the influence of solanaceous intoxication &quot;a man would seem sometimes to be changed into a fish; and flinging out his arms, would swim on the ground; sometimes he would seem to skip up and then to dive down again. Another would believe himself turned into a goose and would eat grass, and beat the ground with his teeth like a goose; now and then sing and...clap his wings&quot; (Schultes and Hofmann, p 88). Porta would seem to be describing mermaids in the first observation and sirens in the second.
<br /><br />In continental Europe, witches may have imagined transformations to familiar terrestrial animals, such as wolves, but on the coasts (particularly the traditional mermaid homelands of the Mediterranean and Celtic islands), where mans relationship with the sea is more pronounced, theres a greater chance of imagining a transformation into a fish. Shapeshifting hallucinations likely resulted from the desire to appropriate the characteristics of a powerful animal--which compliments the general purpose of engaging in witchcraft to increase wisdom, strength, or power. The shape itself would be suggested either by hypnosis or familiarity.2 In the woods, a powerful, free-ranging, dominant animal with frequent human contact is the wolf; in the ocean its the dolphin. Astonishingly, the 8th or 9th century Anglo Saxon manuscript Liber Monstrorum describes Scylla as having &quot;the head and breasts of a girl, like the Sirens, the abdomen of a wolf and the tail of a dolphin&quot; (Lao, 92). Scylla became a hybrid creature through Circes magic. This description would be contemporary with Medieval European witchcraft activity. Shapeshifting hallucinations explain why mermaid imagery more closely follows the pattern of werewolf imagery than demonic companionship--one becomes a mermaid rather than cavorts with one--because the mermaid is a by-product of the ritual and not the religious experience itself. Also, Harner explains how the solanaceous plant hallucinogens are so strong they cause 4-5 days sleep and recovery; a mermaid illusion is only a part of the conscious experience of the drugs, and the greater part of the experience is insensate. Thus the mermaid exists more in stories in which the hallucination is used as source material for storytelling pastimes. Many mermaid stories involve the mermaid becoming human for a short time but finding herself unable to shift back to her hybrid form; story patterns follow intoxication patterns in that hallucination is difficult to repeat.
<br /><br />Bridging the gap between witchcraft and mermaid legend is the sorceress Circe, who bedeviled Ulysses in Homers poem. In ancient Greece (also the original Western source of fish/human hybrids such as the tritons, nereids, and siren variations3), pharmacological knowledge was first largely dominated by men. Circe, as &quot;one of the first figures in Western literature to represent a skilled sorceress,&quot; signals a power shift toward women controlling esoteric and medical knowledge--as they did during the period of medieval witchcraft4. Circe is a particular threat because she is a female who can control behavior through pharmakoy--and is thus both desired and despised by Ulysses. Circe's advice later helps Ulysses resist the temptations of the sirens; she perhaps understands the drug gateways to these hybrid creatures consciousness.
<br /><br />For her &quot;magic,&quot; Circe quite possibly used a drug mixture similar to that of later European witches, including Datura stramonium. Circe links with mermaids in part because she dominated an island, but also by causing shapeshifting illusions--turning men into swine through application of a potion and hypnotic suggestion. Swine in ancient Greece represented a debased sexuality--similar to &quot;male chauvinist pig,&quot; a dirty animal who sees women merely as sex objects (Circe's main complaint against Ulysses men) [see footnote 39 in Scarborough, p 166]. Datura would indeed produce effects similar to those reported in Homer: absorption through skin, shapeshifting illusion and coma. Further, repeated datura applications would cause permanent mental derangement, interpreted as a permanent animal transformation vis a vis permanent hallucination. Short term applications would be reversiblethe effects naturally diminishing after 4-5 days coma-like sleepor medically reversible through application of another drug called moly, identified as Galanthus nivalis, or snowdrop [see footnote 51, Scarborough, p 166-167]. Like mermaids, Circe is a guide and gatekeeper of spiritual and physical transformation--a kind of mermaid without hybridization.
<br /><br />As women who adapted a number of metaphorical scripts to empower themselves, intoxicated witches &quot;became&quot; mermaids to act as gatekeepers to the psychological abyss with a real world key of solanaceous drugs. Their hallucinatory experience was coded in archetypal symbols of a pelagic world, but the transformation to self-wisdom and wholeness must have been very real; it certainly fits the larger context of shamanic exploration and communion surrounding this drug use.
<br /><br />Another possibility for a drug gateway to mermaid realms is raised by Ginzburg's explanation for the origin of the witches Sabbath in the possible use of amanita muscaria fungus, based on it's use as a hallucinogen in shamanic rituals. Ginzburg elaborately links shamanistic traditions of communicating with the world of the dead with animal transformations (such as werewolves, berzerkers, centaurs and many other manifestations--but not fish or mermaids). He then proposes a drug catalyst for these nocturnal visions, first suggesting ergot, but then toadstools (toad bread, toad excrement), a synonym for amanita muscaria (p 306). The toad of course links to the fairy world, which in Ginzburg's analysis is one of the analogies for the world of the dead. The mermaid also fits this pattern, being an animal transformation that links outsiders (the ocean, the subconscious, the dead) with the human world. However, amanita muscaria grows only in mountainous forests of fir and birch, not also likely areas for oceanic contact. Despite the amphibious connotation between toadstools and mermaids, it would seem unlikely that a mountain forest mushroom would be available to people likely to think of fish--or mermaids. Ginzburg does not address the role of solanaceous drugs in the line of shamanic rituals and myths which he pursues.
<br />Notes
<br />1. Thus, the sea becomes a perfect metaphor for the mind (another frontier we rarely know). The surface of the mind is a small part of the whole; we are conscious only of the suface and anything that rises above it and anything we randomly pull from its depths.
<br /><br />2. Possible addition of hallucinogenic toad venom to witches' brews--a formula proposed by Schultes and Hofmann (p 86)--may have suggested an amphibious transformation to some users.
<br /><br />3. The tritons of Greek myth might represent male sorcerors (pharmakoi) using datura potion and imagining their shape shifting to fish or dolphin (delphis) form. When these sorcerors imagined a female erotic counterpart, the Nereids, they thought as men instead of as fish, imagining erotic objects shaped as women rather than as hybrid mermaids. Nonetheless, some graphic interpretations of nereids exist on &quot;a second-century BC vase from Megara in the National Museum of Athens, and the other a first-to-second century Roman lamp in the Royal Museum of Canterbury&quot; (88).
<br /><br />4. Other mythical, religious and historical women associated with transgressive, rebellious or transformative powers and with mermaids include Lilith, Miriam, Virgin Mary, Stella Maris, the Syrian goddess Derceto (Lao, 86).

<br /><br />Q. How did your TV reality show Snoop Dogg's Father Hood come about?
<br /><br />A. They wanted to do a show based entirely on me but I wanted to incorporate the positive things I do, so I felt there was no better way to do it than through my family. So I said to the producers that it wasn't to be about the negative things that surround Snoop Dogg, it's about Snoop Dogg the father, the husband, the person.
<br /><br />Q. How does your wife deal with it when you do things like appear in porn films?
<br /><br />A. She knows the difference between the entertainer and her husband. She knows that the fans gotta have me, but she knows she's got me.

<br /><br />A. That ain't gonna happen.
<br /><br />Q. What do you think of the US elections?

Keisha Morris is the ex-wife of rap legend Tupac Shakur. The interview has been been published in F.E.D.S. Magazine Vol #2 Issue #5.
<br /><br />Before we go into this story let us describe this young woman. Keisha is a 27 year-old woman who has a Bachelors of Science in Criminal Justice graduated from John Jay College and also has a Masters in Education.
<br />She's a strong black woman who knows the meaning of standing on your own. She was born Keisha Morris and has a title and last name that makes her a part of rap history, Shakur. Not boasting of it, she says, &quot;I'm not proud of the things he did, but it was my job to stand by and support him.&quot;
<br />A Bronx native and proud of it, she enjoys sports, reading and talking to adults and children about their problems. She says you have to sometimes have been through or seen issues to explain them. We thought we would be interview a bandana wearing female who hates everyone but herself, cursing and smoking weed. Instead she was very well mannered. It took us some time to get her to relax.
<br />Tupac was a dream that turned into a nightmare. One day he was there for her to love then he was gone. &quot;We were just about to try again,&quot; says Keisha who doesn't smoke weed, cigarettes, or drink. She was just the opposite of Tupac.
<br /><br />F.E.D.S.: What's up Keisha! You have a lot to talk about, huh?
<br /><br />K: Yeah, I have a lot of things to talk about. I want to thank F.E.D.S. magazine for giving me the opportunity to express my feelings. I did this article for personal issues dealing with me.
<br /><br />F: Tupac chose you to be his wife?
<br /><br />K: Yes, whether people want to accept it or not. I want the credit that is owed to me. I want to thank Suge Knight for remembering and acknowledging my position.
<br /><br />F: You were married to a part of history. How did you meet Tupac?
<br /><br />K: We met in June of 1994. We were both at a party that Puffy was throwing at a place called the Capitol. He came into the club, I saw him and spoke to him for a brief moment and walked away. I saw him a month later at the Tunnel another club in Manhattan. He came over to me and told me how he had been thinking about me ever since. I was very surprised. He remembered everything from when we first met. He even remembered the clothing I was wearing. Then he asked if he could take me out.
<br />Initially, I was scared because I didn't know where he was coming from. I wanted to know &quot;Why me?&quot; out of everybody else. He said that he never had a woman treat him like I treated him, which was not impressed. I did not make a big deal out of him. He was attracted to that.
<br /><br />F: What was your first date like?
<br /><br />K: First of all I was a nervous wreck. He wanted me to meet him at his hotel and I was like &quot;Oh no!&quot; Me me in broad daylight with a lot of people around. I was very hesitant, but I went anyway. We went to the Chelsea Movie Theater to see Forest Gump and then we ate dinner around the corner in an Italian restaurant. He wanted to see Forest Gump because he read for the part of &quot;Bubba.&quot; I was in total shock, I couldn't believe who I was on a date with.
<br /><br />F: What album did he have out at the time?
<br /><br />K: He was in the studio at the time recording Me Against the World.
<br /><br />F: Did you go to the studio with him?
<br /><br />K: Yes. He recorded in both Los Angeles and New York. I used to go with him to Unique Studio.
<br /><br />F: Did he tell you about the shooting?
<br /><br />K: Well, he called me on the phone to tell me that he'd been shot and to call his mother.
<br /><br />F: After he called what did you do?
<br /><br />K: He was talking fine, so I continued at first, but I made the necessary calls to his family.
<br /><br />F: Did you have a relationship with his mother?
<br /><br />K: Yeah we had a relationship. In the beginning she was happy Tupac was involved with a woman like me, but after we got serious our relationship became distant.
<br /><br />F: Any reason?
<br /><br />K: That was a choice she made. I didn't have a problem with her. My relationship was with her son.
<br /><br />F: Did she think you married her son for his money?
<br /><br />K: I don't know.
<br /><br />F: How did Tupac feel?
<br /><br />K: He didn't feel that way. We never had a prenuptial agreement, he knew it was pure love.
<br /><br />F: Was it rough being married to Tupac?
<br /><br />K: There were a lot of ups and downs. We had unusual situations. We never had a regular day. Everyday was something with him. His court days, jail and his time on Death Row. Pac was a very complex person. I never knew what to expect from him.
<br /><br />F: How was the sex?
<br /><br />K: I don't believe you guys are asking me this. Just listen to his music. That wasn't the problem. Our problem was communication. He was stubborn and wanted to be in control.
<br /><br />F: Do you think Suge had love for him?
<br /><br />K: Suge had love for him and Pac loved Suge and the West. He only hated the East.
<br /><br />F: Your from the East Cost.
<br /><br />K: I was an exception, to many people were caught up with the whole situation.
<br /><br />F: Describe a Tupac moment.
<br /><br />K: I went to visit Tupac in Atlanta and the hotel room caught on fire, he got mad at me because I tried to escape. He said he couldn't trust me because I should have stayed behind with him to fight the fire.
<br /><br />F: When were you guys were married?
<br /><br />K: We were married on April 4, 1995 and divorced in 1996.
<br /><br />F: So you got married while Pac was in jail?
<br /><br />K: Yes. I moved upstate. I had to make sure he was all right. That was an experience that I would never go through again. The jail was 65 miles south of Canada in Dannemora. It was cold and prejudice.
<br /><br />F: What was it like on a visit?
<br /><br />K: It was horrible. It was such a process and hassle. I took a bus from the city which took about six hours. Then when you got there you'd have to wait in this room for your number to be called and you'd be searched. They put him in protected custody and he did not want to be there. He wanted to be in general population. They did not realize how big a star he was. The correctional officers gave him a hard way to go sometimes.
<br /><br />F: On visits could you touch him?
<br /><br />K: No we didn't have any conjugal visits, nor did we want any.
<br /><br />F: Who went to visit him?
<br /><br />K: A few celebrities came, lawyers, managers, Suge, and his family.
<br /><br />F: Did you and Pac ever have fights?
<br /><br />K: No we didn't have fights. I just had a girl calling my house.
<br /><br />F: Did you smack him?
<br /><br />K: No, there were other ways to handle it.
<br /><br />F: Where did you live?
<br /><br />K: I lived in Harlem and he lived in Atlanta, but stayed at a hotel or at my house.
<br /><br />F: Were you around Suge?
<br /><br />K: Yes.
<br /><br />F: How was he?
<br /><br />K: He didn't bother me.
<br /><br />F: Did you have any children?
<br /><br />K: No.
<br /><br />F: Why didn't you have any kids?
<br /><br />K: It just didn't happen.
<br /><br />F: When he died, did you and his mother go through anything?
<br /><br />K: No. I stayed away. I did not have anything to do with it.
<br /><br />F: But you were his wife.
<br /><br />K: I was not a widow. I had divorced him before it happened, but we still dealt with each other. I was supposed to go out to Vegas but I didn't.
<br /><br />F: Why did you divorce him?
<br /><br />K: I couldn't take the stress anymore.
<br /><br />F: Do you think he's dead?
<br /><br />K: He didn't call me.
<br /><br />F: Where did Tupac get shot the first time?
<br /><br />K: He was grazed in the hand and hand, the most crucial shot was the thigh because it hit an artery. All his sexual organs were in place though.
<br /><br />F: Did Tupac ever tell you he was going to forget and forgive everything that happened on the East Coast?
<br /><br />K: Yes, at one time he was going to just forget about everything and just move forward, but when Biggie and Puffy did that article about him he got upset.
<br /><br />F: What helped you get over his death?
<br /><br />K: Peace with myself and knowing that he is resting peacefully. On our first date he told me he was going to die by the time he was 25, he said it would probably be murder. I looked at him like he was crazy.
<br /><br />F: It was said that he divorced you because he only wanted to be married to his music?
<br /><br />K: He didn't divorce me. I divorced him.
<br /><br />F: If Tupac were still alive do you think he would have married Quincy Jones' daughter?
<br /><br />K: He had plenty of time to marry her, why didn't he? He told me he was using her just to get to Quincy. I'm not denying that they had sex- he had sex with a lot of women.
<br /><br />F: Did you get a lot of crank calls because of your relationship with him?
<br /><br />K: Plenty of times. That didn't bother me. I adjusted very fast. I was only 21 years old when I met Tupac and he wanted to marry me right away. People think he wanted to marry me because he was in jail and needed trailer visits, but that wasn't the case. I met him in June and in September he bought me a ring. Tupac married me so I would have respect when I called Death Row. I was holding him down while he was in prison. I talked to his A&amp;R and the video people. He didn't want people to say, &quot;Oh that's just his girlfriend.&quot; He wanted me to have the title. I could have kept the title- people say I should've went after hismoney, but for what?
<br /><br />F: So you didn't get anything?
<br /><br />K: Nothing! And I'm fine with that. I didn't marry him to be anyone or get anything from him. If we had a child that would be a different story, but I can take care of myself- he wasn't my father.
<br /><br />F: How did Suge and Tupac get together?
<br /><br />K: Pac called me and said, &quot;I want you to set up a meeting with me and Suge.&quot; So I called Interscope and they gave me the number at Death Row. The rest is history.

These fve, I think, is what every Nigerian artist and all of us should strive for if we want to make the kind of impact DA GRIN has had on us:
<br /><br />1. Servant Leader: DA GRIN was a “beast” on the mic. But beyond his immense talent, he had a very humble disposition. His body language on and off stage always seem to say,“ I might be on stage telling you my story through my music but at the end of the day, it is all about YOU; inspiring YOU to never give up in anything you want to achieve.” That is how servant leaders work. They don’t take the glory but instead focus on the needs of those they serve. Indeed the many who met DA GRIN testified to his unique down to earth quality, humility, empathy and his willingness to listen to the many who crossed his path.
<br />2. Attitude- DA GRIN had a good attitude, a rare commodity these days. He was willing to work on his craft and make it better by working with diverse artists with equally diverse personalities. We all know how difficult it can be to work with groups or individuals on any projects even if you all have the same goals. You have to deal with different styles, schedules, personalities, varying degrees of egos and attitudes. Yet, somehow, DA GRIN managed to work with numerous artists and in many instances helped shine or amplify the brands of the many he collaborated with. YQ, Naeto C, Sasha, Jazzman, Lala, Bigiano, Omawumi, 9ice, KSB, Carti Air, Ice Berg Slim, E-Jay and Pype, are just a few of these artists.
<br />3. Passion- “If there is no passion in your life, then have you really lived? Find your passion, whatever it may be. Become it, and let it become you and you will find great things happen FOR you, TO you and BECAUSE of you.” ~T. Alan Armstrong. DA GRIN understood this quote so well and it showed in his work. It didn’t matter the haters, naysayers and his inability to afford “1 Redbull” as he put it in his song “Ghetto Dreams” off his Sophomore Album titled ‘CEO.’ He remained relentless and had a clear purpose on what he was called to do and he pursued his passion, passionately.
<br />4. Perseverance- DA GRIN’s Mi So Fun Yin Entertainment record label is a clear showing of perseverance. “Mi So Fun Yin” which means, “I told you guys/ I told you so,” immediately indicates there were many naysayers but he persevered. In “Ghetto Dreams,” DA GRIN tells us we can’t imagine the insults he received, people basically said he would amount to nothing. But, he stayed focused, he was determined, he hustled from morning till dawn and was now reaping the benefits. The ability to never give up, regardless of the odds stacked against you, is critical and what great artists/persons are made of.
<br />5. Gratitude –“Gratitude is not only the greatest of virtues, but the parent of all others.” ~Cicero “Thank you” is a luxury in this day and age. If you live in Yankee or Jand, don’t even expect it. It is also worse among celebrities whether they be within or outside Naija. DA GRIN understood the importance of being grateful to his fans, colleagues, God etc. Whether it was on his album, collaborations with others etc. he said, “Thank you.” Gratitude to those who helped you rise to the top: friends, family, spouses, boy/girl friend, colleagues, media, managers, PR team etc.” is part of what makes you a great artist/person like DA GRIN.
<br />Similar Qualities like my main man 2pac Amaru Shakur they all got the spirit and ego 2 make a change in in the society, may their Humble and loyal soul rest in perfect peace........________PEACE OUT

Knowledge opens the eyes to the long term benefit, which lasts for ever. There is a necessary link between intelligence and morality, the willingness to put off a short-term gain for a long-term benefit that ultimately is greater and ever lasting. This kind of intelligence is conditioned by Islam.
<br /><br />Blessings are either roots or branches. The roots are things like iman, Islam, health, safety, and well-being. The branches are money, clothing, shelter, and so on. The best blessings are those connected with entering Paradise (which is the completion of blessings). Faith, patience, good character, swiftness in doing good, and promptness in worship are blessings of God and they are everlasting. Islam itself is the completion of God's blessings upon humanity.
<br /><br />The ornaments of this life are such things as a house, furnishings, and clothing. The more that one has of these blessings, the more he will be accountable for them. To be zahid (ascetic) does not always mean a lack of material possession. There is asceticism of the heart, in which one is not attached to the material world and is indifferent to it. In other words, a person's character and level of faith will not change if he loses his wealth. That's the sign of a zahid. But if one falls apart and plunges into despondency when losing something valuable, it shows an inordinate attachment to worldly life. [Hamza Yusuf, Purification of the Heart]

<br /><br />&quot;The genesis of life is as inevitable as the formation of atoms ... Life exists on other planets and we will find it within 20 years,&quot; said Andrei Frankenstein, director of the Russian Academy of Sciences' Applied Astronomy Institute, according to the Inter fax news agency.
<br /><br />Speaking at an international forum dedicated to the search for extraterrestrial life, Frankenstein said 10% of the known planets circling suns in the galaxy resemble Earth.
<br /><br />If water can be found there, then so can life, he said, adding that aliens would most likely resemble humans with two arms, two legs and a head.
<br /><br />&quot;They may have different colour skin, but even we have that,&quot; he said.
<br /><br />Finkelstein's institute runs a programme launched in the 1960s at the height of the cold war space race to watch for and beam out radio signals to outer space.
<br /><br />&quot;The whole time we have been searching for extraterrestrial civilisations, we have mainly been waiting for messages from space and not the other way,&quot; he said.
<br /><br />In March a Nasa scientist caused controversy after claiming to have found tiny fossils of alien bugs inside meteorites that landed on Earth.
<br /><br />Richard Hoover, an astrobiologist at the US space agency's Marshall space flight centre in Alabama, said filaments and other structures in rare meteorites appear to be microscopic fossils of extraterrestrial beings that resemble algae known as cyanobacteria.
<br /><br />Writing in the Journal of Cosmology, Hoover claimed that the lack of nitrogen in the samples, which is essential for life on Earth, indicated they are &quot;the remains of extraterrestrial life forms that grew on the parent bodies of the meteorites when liquid water was present, long before the meteorites entered the Earth's atmosphere.&quot;

<br /><br />In some of these systems, new connections must be authenticated and approved at the application layer. Once this has been done, the remainder of the connection is passed down to the session layer, where packet filters watch the connection to ensure that only packets that are part of an ongoing (already authenticated and approved) conversation are being passed.
<br /><br />Other possibilities include using both packet filtering and application layer proxies. The benefits here include providing a measure of protection against your machines that provide services to the Internet (such as a public web server), as well as provide the security of an application layer gateway to the internal network. Additionally, using this method, an attacker, in order to get to services on the internal network, will have to break through the access router, the bastion host, and the choke router.

Microsoft is being more aggressive with regard to UI design, but you could argue that this is because it didn't make the big change Apple did a decade ago. Neither company likes to make big changes. But faced with an iPad tsunami, Microsoft figured out it had better step up, and Windows 8 is the result.
<br /><br />When testing a new operating system from Microsoft (Nasdaq: MSFT), finding the right hardware is often the biggest problem. Many of the negative reviews of Windows 8, including my own, are tied to hardware that just wasn't designed for it.
<br />I was at Microsoft's TechEd last week, and after hearing presenters drill down in detail on the specs for what an ideal Windows 8 laptop should be, I experiences an aha moment. It came with the announcement of the new MacBook Pro Retina, which fit the specs for a non-touch Windows 8 laptop almost perfectly. The &quot;almost&quot; part is it doesn't ship with Windows -- but it is closer than any other laptop in the market.
<br />I'll explain why the best Windows 8 laptop comes from Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL), and I'm going to make the best Windows 8 tablet my product of the week.
<br />The Perfect Windows 8 Laptop
<br />Most of the existing laptops in market suck with Windows 8, with or without touchscreens. This is because Windows 8 really pushes three things: It pushes touch (of course); it pushes graphics performance; and it pushes resolution.
<br />Most existing laptops don't even have multitouch touchpads on them, and those that do often make them too small or put a border around them so you can't use the edges effectively. Windows 8 uses the edges and corners to bring up critical menus and aggressively uses gestures, so you need a large, multitouch touchpad that is set flush into the wrist rest. Otherwise you'll just get annoyed and frustrated when things don't work right.
<br />As a side note, this problem is particularly true of touchscreens. You need one very close in performance to the iPad and other top phones that use gestures heavily. Most Windows Tablet solutions were built to hit a price point and simply aren't sensitive enough to work reliably. (I'll get to this more in the product of the week section -- this is a teaser.)
<br />Windows 8 is the first version of Windows truly designed to scale with the screen size and resolution. It should be as accurate on a 10-inch display as it is on a 200-inch display -- assuming we could find and afford one -- and anticipates both great size and great resolutions.
<br />This means, unlike what used to happen with Windows on high-resolution displays in the past -- bad or tiny fonts and images -- this version will get better the higher the resolution, so the greater the better.
<br />It doesn't just push scaling though; it also is the first OS to fully take advantage of GPU computing, which means performance is now a blend of the central processor and the graphics processor. A top AMD (NYSE: AMD) or Intel (Nasdaq: INTC) processor won't be enough, you'll need a top AMD or Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA) graphics processor to truly get the most performance out of this puppy.
<br />I looked at all of the laptops in the market, and when the display requirement is added in, only the new MacBook Pro with Retina Display checks all of the boxes.
<br />MacBook Pro Retina Edition
<br />What really drove this home was that one of the Microsoft executives briefing me last week was running Windows on a MacBook Pro on top of Boot Camp, and he loved it. Think about it: The MacBook Pro has a large multitouch touchpad that is mounted flush to the wrist rest; that's one check. It has an Nvidia GeForce GT 650 GPU based on Nvidia's new top-of-the-line Kepler technology; that's another check. Finally, it has -- and this is what makes it truly stand out -- a Retina Display that is the highest-resolution display on a notebook in its class; that's the third check.
<br />Now, you do have to run the new OS on Boot Camp, so you'll likely take a bit of a performance hit if you were to go this route, but the MacBook Pro Retina, on spec, likely represents the gold standard for a non-touchscreen notebook computer.
<br />Wrapping Up: What Does This Mean?
<br />It means that Apple and Microsoft are largely on the same page when it comes to the hardware that people want. Microsoft is being more aggressive with regard to UI design, but you could argue that this is because it didn't make the big change Apple did a decade ago.
<br />Neither company likes to make big changes. But faced with what has become an iPad tsunami, Microsoft figured out it had better step up, and Windows 8 is the result. In the end, although both firms clearly aren't in agreement on software, on hardware -- at least laptop hardware -- they are in lockstep.
<br />This suggests that come Windows 8 launch, we are likely to be up to our ears in products that look like and have a similar spec sheet to the MacBook Pro Retina edition. Hey -- if you have to look like something, this attractive product is an excellent choice. You know, I'm warming to Tim Cook. He is no Steve Jobs, but so far he's doing OK, and he sure as hell is a lot nicer.
<br />Product of the Week: Samsung Series 7 Slate
<br />Product of the Week
<br />The Samsung Series 7 Slate (700T1A) was the showcase product at TechEd, and it really drove home why current Windows tablets suck and showcased the limitations Microsoft is targeting with the iPad.
<br />Currently, this tablet sells with Windows 7, and at around US$1,400, it prices out similar to two well- equipped iPads. Generally, the reason many of the existing Windows tablets suck is the OEMs tried to shave off costs and then ended up with expensive crap.
<br />While the iPad is around 10 inches, this Samsung approaches 12 inches, and size does make a huge difference if you want to use a tablet to create rather than just consume. You'll quickly find, like you probably did when you bought a larger monitor; that two inches can make a huge difference (that's what SHE said).
<br />Most of the existing tablets were built on the iPad spec and focused on consumption, but Windows' strength is that it is a full-featured OS and can do creation just fine.
<br />Samsung Series 7 Slate
<br />Samsung Series 7 Slate
<br />You see, most of the complaints about the iPad seem to come from folks who want it to be a laptop so they can more easily leave their laptop at home, but the iPad actually has less performance than a netbook and we know how netbooks ended up.
<br />The iPad wins where the netbook doesn't, because it doesn't officially try to be a notebook and fall short -- it tries to be an entertainment device and does that fine.
<br />A lot of people want more, though. In fact, I heard from three large company IT managers who raved about this tablet running Windows 8 and plan to deploy it instead of iPad or Google (Nasdaq: GOOG) tablets because their users want to work not just play. (Actually that may not be entirely true, it is likely the folks these people work for that are driving that requirement).
<br />With a wireless keyboard, this thing kicks the iPad's butt on productivity -- given the price difference, it better, huh? -- and with the right keyboard, this will easily replace both an iPad and a notebook computer, especially after the Windows 8 app store finally exits beta.
<br />At 1.87 pounds, this tablet is one of the lightest Windows tablets in the market. Tthe lightest Ultrabook I've tested weighed around 2.5 pounds, and the current iPad is only .43 pounds lighter at 1.44 pounds. That is less than a half pound more than the iPad for full notebook capability. Pretty impressive.
<br />It has a high performance capacitive screen that provides cellphone-like gesture capability, a reasonably high 400 nit display (most laptops are 350 but I'd prefer 500 or more) with 1,366 by 768 resolution, which is still way lower than the Apple Retina Display.
<br />It has full port out -- USB, HDMI, Micro SD -- and it is one of the first products to sport WiDi (HD video streaming to TV technology). It has a 128 GB SD drive, and it supports a stylus you can use to draw or sign things. It even ships with an attractive wireless keyboard (.65 pounds) for that full laptop experience while writing.
<br />The only thing I didn't like was it uses Intel's HD graphics, which significantly underperforms the Nvidia GPU used in the MacBook Pro. Some sacrifices were made for the tablet form factor and weight limit, but otherwise this is an amazing look into what Windows 8 tablets will have at the end of the year. As a result, the Samsung Series 7 Slate (700T1A) is my product of the week.

Also: Google releases a report detailing removal requests from governments around the world, and there's a MacBook Pro shortage in the UK.
<br /><br />Japanese police have arrested six men in Tokyo for creating a virus spread via a porn website Get Whitepaper: Simple Strategies for Enhancing eCommerce Profitability, according to the BBC.
<br />The virus was delivered in the guise of an app for watching videos. Once downloaded, the app demanded a payment of nearly 100,000 yen, or about US$1,267, every five minutes. The six men are believed to have raked in more than 20 million yen -- about $250,000.
<br />Citing Japanese police, BBC reports that nearly 10,000 people downloaded the virus, and 211 forked over money.
<br />Even those who didn't pay suffered: The virus was designed to steal personal information from the mobile devices on which it was downloaded.
<br />Two of the six men are senior managers in high-tech Japanese firms, according to police.
<br />Governmental Pokes and Prods
<br />Google (Nasdaq: GOOG) received more than 1,000 requests from authorities to remove content from its search results or from YouTube during the last six months of 2011.
<br />Google, which made the announcement in a blog post, bemoaned the requests, saying that they pose a risk to free expression. The company said it was all the more troublesome because the many of the requests came from Western countries thought to be free from censorship. The blog post mentions Spain, where regulators asked Google to remove 270 search results linking to blogs and newspaper articles, as well as Poland, where a public institution had asked the company to remove links to pages that were critical of it. The company said it didn't comply in either instance.
<br />Google also published a country-by-country list of removal requests, including how often Google carried them out.
<br />The removal requests sought to have about 12,000 items removed, about 25 percent more than the first half of 2011, according to Reuters.
<br />Google does comply with certain removal requests because some content is indeed illegal. Reuters cites Germany, where YouTube videos with certain kinds of Nazi references are removed because they are banned there.
<br />Piggybacking off the Google blog post, the BBC had an article about the content removal requests coming from the UK. Some 640 videos promoting terrorism were removed on the heels of complaints from the Association of Chief Police Officers, according to the report. In addition, five YouTube accounts linked to those videos were also terminated.
<br />Made in the USA
<br />The United States regained the crown of having the world's fastest computer, according to the Top 500 Supercomputer list.
<br />China took the title two years ago, and Japan grabbed it in 2011, according to ComputerWorld.com.
<br />The fastest computer -- an IBM (NYSE: IBM) located at the Department of Energy's Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California -- is reportedly capable of 16.32 sustained petaflops.
<br />It was a good showing overall for IBM. The company accounted for five of the top 10 spots and 213 out of 500. HP (NYSE: HPQ) was second with 141 systems in the top 500, according to ComputerWorld.
<br />After the U.S. lost the fastest-computer title in 2010, president Obama mentioned China's No. 1 ranking in two separate speeches, including the 2011 State of the Union, according to ComputerWorld.
<br />Apple Shortage in UK
<br />British people trying to get their hands on the new MacBook Pro could face some headaches -- or at least a huge wait -- according to The New Statesman.
<br />There is a month-long lead time for online orders from the UK, according to the report.
<br />While the delays aren't &amp;quot;a shafting of British customers to ensure American stores stay supplied,&amp;quot; according to the article, the UK is nonetheless short on the new machines. Only one store in all of Britain received any new MacBook Pros. That store, in London, was to use the MacBook Pros as display units -- but instead accidentally sold them.

<br /><br />History is a bath of blood,” wrote William James, whose 1906 antiwar essay is arguably the best ever written on the subject. “Modern man inherits all the innate pugnacity and all the love of glory of his ancestors. Showing war’s irrationality and horror is of no effect on him. The horrors make the fascination. War is the strong life; it is life in extremis; war taxes are the only ones men never hesitate to pay, as the budgets of all nations show us.”
<br /><br />Our bloody nature, it can now be argued in the context of modern biology, is ingrained because group-versus-group competition was a principal driving force that made us what we are. In prehistory, group selection (that is, the competition between tribes instead of between individuals) lifted the hominids that became territorial carnivores to heights of solidarity, to genius, to enterprise—and to fear. Each tribe knew with justification that if it was not armed and ready, its very existence was imperiled. Throughout history, the escalation of a large part of technology has had combat as its central purpose. Today the calendars of nations are punctuated by holidays to celebrate wars won and to perform memorial services for those who died waging them. Public support is best fired up by appeal to the emotions of deadly combat, over which the amygdala—a center for primary emotion in the brain—is grandmaster. We find ourselves in the “battle” to stem an oil spill, the “fight” to tame inflation, the “war” against cancer. Wherever there is an enemy, animate or inanimate, there must be a victory. You must prevail at the front, no matter how high the cost at home.
<br /><br />Any excuse for a real war will do, so long as it is seen as necessary to protect the tribe. The remembrance of past horrors has no effect. From April to June in 1994, killers from the Hutu majority in Rwanda set out to exterminate the Tutsi minority, which at that time ruled the country. In a hundred days of unrestrained slaughter by knife and gun, 800,000 people died, mostly Tutsi. The total Rwandan population was reduced by 10 percent. When a halt was finally called, 2 million Hutu fled the country, fearing retribution. The immediate causes for the bloodbath were political and social grievances, but they all stemmed from one root cause: Rwanda was the most overcrowded country in Africa. For a relentlessly growing population, the per capita arable land was shrinking toward its limit. The deadly argument was over which tribe would own and control the whole of it.
<br /><br />Universal conflict
<br /><br />Once a group has been split off from other groups and sufficiently dehumanized, any brutality can be justified, at any level, and at any size of the victimized group up to and including race and nation. And so it has ever been. A familiar fable is told to symbolize this pitiless dark angel of human nature. A scorpion asks a frog to ferry it across a stream. The frog at first refuses, saying that it fears the scorpion will sting it. The scorpion assures the frog it will do no such thing. After all, it says, we will both perish if I sting you. The frog consents, and halfway across the stream the scorpion stings it. Why did you do that, the frog asks as they both sink beneath the surface. It is my nature, the scorpion explains.
<br /><br />War, often accompanied by genocide, is not a cultural artifact of just a few societies. Nor has it been an aberration of history, a result of the growing pains of our species’ maturation. Wars and genocide have been universal and eternal, respecting no particular time or culture. Archaeological sites are strewn with the evidence of mass conflicts and burials of massacred people. Tools from the earliest Neolithic period, about 10,000 years ago, include instruments clearly designed for fighting. One might think that the influence of pacific Eastern religions, especially Buddhism, has been consistent in opposing violence. Such is not the case. Whenever Buddhism dominated and became the official ideology, war was tolerated and even pressed as part of faith-based state policy. The rationale is simple, and has its mirror image in Christianity: Peace, nonviolence, and brotherly love are core values, but a threat to Buddhist law and civilization is an evil that must be defeated.
<br /><br />Since the end of World War II, violent conflict between states has declined drastically, owing in part to the nuclear standoff of the major powers (two scorpions in a bottle writ large). But civil wars, insurgencies, and state-sponsored terrorism continue unabated. Overall, big wars have been replaced around the world by small wars of the kind and magnitude more typical of hunter-gatherer and primitively agricultural societies. Civilized societies have tried to eliminate torture, execution, and the murder of civilians, but those fighting little wars do not comply.
<br /><br />Archaeologists have determined that after populations of Homo sapiens began to spread out of Africa approximately 60,000 years ago, the first wave reached as far as New Guinea and Australia. The descendants of the pioneers remained as hunter-gatherers or at most primitive agriculturalists, until reached by Europeans. Living populations of similar early provenance and archaic cultures are the aboriginals of Little Andaman Island off the east coast of India, the Mbuti Pygmies of Central Africa, and the !Kung Bushmen of southern Africa. All today, or at least within historical memory, have exhibited aggressive territorial behavior.
<br /><br />Lethal legacy
<br /><br />Tribal aggressiveness goes back well beyond Neolithic times, but no one as yet can say exactly how far. It could have begun at the time of Homo habilis, the earliest known species of the genus Homo, which arose between 3 million and 2 million years ago in Africa. Along with a larger brain, those first members of our genus developed a heavy dependence on scavenging or hunting for meat. And there is a good chance that it could be a much older heritage, dating beyond the split 6 million years ago between the lines leading to modern chimpanzees and to humans.
<br /><br />A series of researchers, starting with Jane Goodall, have documented the murders within chimpanzee groups and lethal raids conducted between groups. It turns out that chimpanzees and human hunter-gatherers and primitive farmers have about the same rates of death due to violent attacks within and between groups. But nonlethal violence is far higher in the chimps, occurring between a hundred and possibly a thousand times more often than in humans.
<br /><br />The patterns of collective violence in which young chimp males engage are remarkably similar to those of young human males. Aside from constantly vying for status, both for themselves and for their gangs, they tend to avoid open mass confrontations with rival troops, instead relying on surprise attacks. The purpose of raids made by the male gangs on neighboring communities is evidently to kill or drive out their members and acquire new territory. There is no certain way to decide on the basis of existing knowledge whether chimpanzees and humans inherited their pattern of territorial aggression from a common ancestor or whether they evolved it independently in response to parallel pressures of natural selection and opportunities encountered in the African homeland. From the remarkable similarity in behavioral detail between the two species, however, and if we use the fewest assumptions required to explain it, a common ancestry seems the more likely choice.
<br /><br />The principles of population ecology allow us to explore more deeply the roots of mankind’s tribal instinct. Population growth is exponential. When each individual in a population is replaced in every succeeding generation by more than one—even by a very slight fraction more, say 1.01—the population grows faster and faster, in the manner of a savings account or debt. A population of chimpanzees or humans is always prone to grow exponentially when resources are abundant, but after a few generations even in the best of times it is forced to slow down. Something begins to intervene, and in time the population reaches its peak, then remains steady, or else oscillates up and down. Occasionally it crashes, and the species becomes locally extinct.
<br /><br />What is the “something”? It can be anything in nature that moves up or down in effectiveness with the size of the population. Wolves, for example, are the limiting factor for the population of elk and moose they kill and eat. As the wolves multiply, the populations of elk and moose stop growing or decline. In parallel manner, the quantity of elk and moose are the limiting factor for the wolves: When the predator population runs low on food, in this case elk and moose, its population falls. In other instances, the same relation holds for disease organisms and the hosts they infect. As the host population increases, and the populations grow larger and denser, the parasite population increases with it. In history diseases have often swept through the land until the host populations decline enough or a sufficient percentage of its members acquire immunity.
<br /><br />There is another principle at work: Limiting factors work in hierarchies. Suppose that the primary limiting factor is removed for elk by humans’ killing the wolves. As a result the elk and moose grow more numerous, until the next factor kicks in. The factor may be that herbivores overgraze their range and run short of food. Another limiting factor is emigration, where individuals have a better chance to survive if they leave and go someplace else. Emigration due to population pressure is a highly developed instinct in lemmings, plague locusts, monarch butterflies, and wolves. If such populations are prevented from emigrating, the populations might again increase in size, but then some other limiting factor manifests itself. For many kinds of animals, the factor is the defense of territory, which protects the food supply for the territory owner. Lions roar, wolves howl, and birds sing in order to announce that they are in their territories and desire competing members of the same species to stay away.
<br /><br />Wars past, present, future
<br /><br />Humans and chimpanzees are intensely territorial. That is the apparent population control hardwired into their social systems. What the events were that occurred in the origin of the chimpanzee and human lines—before the chimpanzee-human split of 6 million years ago—can only be speculated. I believe that the evidence best fits the following sequence. The original limiting factor, which intensified with the introduction of group hunting for animal protein, was food. Territorial behavior evolved as a device to sequester the food supply. Expansive wars and annexation resulted in enlarged territories and favored genes that prescribe group cohesion, networking, and the formation of alliances.
<br /><br />For hundreds of millennia, the territorial imperative gave stability to the small, scattered communities of Homo sapiens, just as they do today in the small, scattered populations of surviving hunter-gatherers. During this long period, randomly spaced extremes in the environment alternately increased and decreased the population size so that it could be contained within territories. These demographic shocks led to forced emigration or aggressive expansion of territory size by conquest, or both together. They also raised the value of forming alliances outside of kin-based networks in order to subdue other neighboring groups.
<br /><br />Ten thousand years ago, at the dawn of the Neolithic era, the agricultural revolution began to yield vastly larger amounts of food from cultivated crops and livestock, allowing rapid growth in human populations. But that advance did not change human nature. People simply increased their numbers as fast as the rich new resources allowed. As food again inevitably became the limiting factor, they obeyed the territorial imperative. Their descendants have never changed. At the present time, we are still fundamentally the same as our hunter-gatherer ancestors, but with more food and larger territories. Region by region, recent studies show, the populations have approached a limit set by the supply of food and water. And so it has always been for every tribe, except for the brief periods after new lands were discovered and their indigenous inhabitants displaced or killed.
<br /><br />The struggle to control vital resources continues globally, and it is growing worse. The problem arose because humanity failed to seize the great opportunity given it at the dawn of the Neolithic era. It might then have halted population growth below the constraining minimum limit. As a species we did the opposite, however. There was no way for us to foresee the consequences of our initial success. We simply took what was given us and continued to multiply and consume in blind obedience to instincts inherited from our humbler, more brutally constrained Paleolithic ancestors.
<br /><br />Fatality rate due to conflict
<br /><br />The last century has been called the Century of Total War: World Wars I and II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, and other conflicts took an estimated 187 million human lives. But after analyzing archaeological and ethnographic data, social scientist Samuel Bowles of the Santa Fe Institute in New Mexico has reported even worse fatalities in hunter-gatherer societies stretching back at least 10,000 years and continuing to the present. War appeared to serve a purpose, culling population whenever numbers rose too high. Counterintuitively, war might have also fostered altruism: Since winning battles required cooperation, wartime mortality might have aided the evolution of an altruistic human nature through the process of natural selection.
<br /><br />7%  Southern Sweden 
<br /><br />Remains by an ancient lagoon called Skateholm indicate a 7% adult mortality rate due to warfare 6,100 years ago.
<br /><br />21%  Southern Ukraine 
<br /><br />Analysis of Vasiliv’ka III, an 11,000-year-old burial site, shows that 21% of adults died as a result of warfare. Another site, Volos’ke, shows evidence of a 22% adult mortality rate due to warfare. 
<br /><br />30%  Northern India
<br /><br />At Sarai Nahar Rai, a site inhabited by hunter-gatherers between 3,140 and 2,860 years ago, war caused 30% of adult deaths.
<br /><br />46%  Northern Sudan 
<br /><br />14,000 to 12,000 years ago, 46% of Nubian adults died in war.
<br /><br />21%  Northeastern Australia
<br /><br />Among the Murngin, a group of maritime foragers, war accounted for about 21% of adult deaths between 1910 and 1930.
<br /><br />23%  British Columbia 
<br /><br />Across 30 sites dating to between 5,500 and 340 years ago, 23% of all adults died in war.
<br /><br />6%  Southern California
<br /><br />Across 28 hunter-gatherer sites, warfare led to 6% of adult deaths between 5,500 and 630 years ago.
<br /><br />17%  Venezuela-Colombia border 
<br /><br />Before first contact in 1960, warfare caused 17% of adult deaths among the Hiwi, who were foragers.
<br /><br />30%  Eastern Paraguay 
<br /><br />Ethnographic evidence implies that war caused 30% of the deaths among hunter-gatherers here prior to Western contact in 1970.
