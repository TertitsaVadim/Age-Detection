Les 5 Sens is near our school and famous so we choose this restaurant.
<br />There are many different French foods that we can choose. I ordered lasagna with green salad, and it is very special and delicious. Lasagna has many layers that beef stuffing and ketchup are in it. I liked my food because it is different, beautiful and tasty. When I was eating the food, I enjoyed it. French people usually use toasters to cook food, but Chinese people like to stir-fry, so French food has different senses of taste. The green salad is beside Lasagna, and including tomato and lettuce, however Chinese people seldom eat uncooked vegetable. Lasagna has strong taste tasty, but the salad is fresh and cool, so lasagna with green salad is a good match. Overall, I liked lasagna with green salad.
<br />The environment of Les 5 Sens is comfortable and warm. Although the restaurant is small, it is very elaborate and has western style. The table and desk are made of wood. There are small beautiful plants in the restaurant. The service was good, when we went to the restaurant, the waiters and waitress greeted with us, and they all can speak English. They were patient to introduce many popular French foods and gave us some ideas. The other people in restaurant were chatting to each other and relaxed. I thought they were business man.
<br />I would recommend my other classmates and people to eat in Les 5 Sens. I was happy to enjoy the food with my classmates and grade 12 mentors.

I worked in courtyard with other volunteers, and move the desks and chairs, then arrange the stage for dancing. It was a hard work, but I had learned some insights from it. I like doing volunteer work.
<br />   On the afternoon, the organizer told us to move many desks and chairs to the courtyard, because there would be a big place for many activities on the evening. We carried the desks and chairs from grade 11 classrooms that were on the third floors. It was my first time to work for school, so I was exciting. At the beginning of the work, I worked with a light heart; even the desks and chairs were heavy. Later, we had carried a lot of the desks and chairs?and we thought it is enough for the party, but the organizer explained that we needed more. Then we went back to work, and find some couches in the school. I gradually felt tired and boring, but we still needed many desks and chairs and the time was also limited?so I kept work hard with other volunteers. Actually, I thought I was hard to carry any desks, because my arms were so sore after moving many things. Finally, we had enough desks and chairs?then we were ready to welcome the party.
<br />   Our school held a dancing show during the party, so we also needed to arrange the stage for dancing. We carried a big red carpet to a big place near the courtyard, and it was beautiful and attractive. Some volunteers and I laid the carpet together, but it was huge and heavy, so we tried many times to make it flat and our hands were dirty. Then we used tapes to fix the carpet on the ground. Finally we had a wonderful stage that was our achievement. The Halloween party was coming; as a volunteer, I had done what I should do before the party beginning, so I was happy and satisfied with myself. Everybody all enjoyed the unforgettable Halloween party in the evening.
<br />    I had learnt a lot by doing volunteer work for school party. First I know work with other people can help us to finish our tasks or solve problems, so I realize that it is important for us to   cooperate with other students. For example, I carried the couch alone, and I felt tired, but I did not carry many couches because my efficiency was low. Then I moved the couches with other volunteers?so we can carry couches easily and quickly. I was also aware that we should do work persistently or not easily give up our goals after I was hard to kept moving desks and chairs. Overall, I was very happy to do the volunteer work, and I have learnt a lot by doing volunteer work.

<br />   Last year, my classmates decided to perform in our School Art Festival. I was very happy to join them, and we organized a small band because we wanted to sing and play music at the performance. We all liked to sing the song called I am yours. This song was very good and popular. One and I played the guitar in the band, and there is a girl that played the dumb. Four people were singing. Our small band is wonderful.
<br />   At the beginning, I need to learn how to play the song by myself, and different people had their own tasks. Some day later, the leader wanted us to practice together, so after school, we played in the class. It is terrible, because it is our first time to practice together. Everyone just kept playing or singing, and they did not care about other people. We all thought that we need to practice more. First, we should cooperate with each other very well, because we are in a band. Second, we must listen carefully when we are playing. We had played together many times before the performance. It is not very boring, and I think that we enjoy the music. Finally we can show the performance very naturally, we were confident to play. At the performance of Art festival, we all felt a little bit nervous, and many classmates wanted to see our show. We had tried our best to play, and it was successful.

<br />    One day after my dance class, I interviewed my dancing teacher. His name is Huang JunNing, and he likes us to call him phido. He is a good dancer that he has studied the popping for many years. I think my teacher also is a wonderful artist.   
<br />    At the beginning of the interview, my dancing teacher, phido told me that he loves popping and to dance. He just learnt dance with his friends, when he was in th e college. It is hard for him to start to dance popping, because nobody could teach popping at that time. Phido and his friends dance every day at a small place. Then they went to find some people who know the popping well. My teacher had practiced a lot, so he has very good basic skills. After computers are popular, he can study on the internet and look the foreign people dancing. My teacher was become professional, and then he started to performance.

Sometimes, there is a small action is difficult, so some students give up, but the he wants us to persist. In his opinion, confidence is also very important for us. If you are confident to yourself, you can do better, because you believe yourself. Most people are shy, when they are dancing. My teacher said that we should be natural when we solo.
<br />    He also thinks that we need to learn from different dancers. They have their advantages and disadvantages, and then we can check ourselves. My teacher hopes that we do not laugh at some new dancers. As we known, most of new dancers are not good at dancing, and they always do some mistakes, but we can’t laugh at them.

<br />   I like to do sports, such as playing basketball, swimming and dancing. Doing sports or physical activity make me relax and it is good for our healthy.
<br />   I am interesting in popping which is a type of dance, so I go to the dancing class every weekend at 1808 dancing studio. It is very exciting for me to have dancing class. At Saturday, I go to the dancing studio to dance with my friends. There are a big bright place and a large mirror on the wall, and it is comfortable for us to train. The dancing studio also has the perfect audios that are very cool, so the tone quality is good. 
<br />   There is about five students study popping with me that is very well, so the teacher can teach every student carefully. My dancing teacher is a handsome guy, and he is professional at popping. At the beginning of every class, we do the warm up, such as push-up. It is hard to keep doing it, and the teacher asks us to do sixteenth push-ups every times. We always do three times, and then it is very tough. After doing it, my arms are very tingle, but I still finish it because I want to be stronger. The teacher teaches us some basic trainings, for example, pop and wave. It is important for us to have high basic skill if we want to dance popping well. Popping is that you have very flexible muscle, because you should control your muscle and release the energy. Then you can show the popping. The teacher sometimes tells us a series of skills and trick in dance, and he wants us can make sense about popping. I think it is a difficult process for us, and the teacher teaches us how to listen to the popping music. I feel tired after dancing, and sometimes I cannot do an action well that I was unhappy. The teacher says that it is normal but I should be confident to myself. Our dancing studio holds a dancing show; I joined it and perform with other students. I have danced popping for half a year. I like popping and I will keep dancing.

<br />   One day at the weekend, my friends and I went a church that is located near the Mo Chou Road. It is my first time to visiting the church. I think the church is special and beautiful. There are many people went to the church and joined the activities.
<br />The church is not very small and it has a big lobby. There are many famous sentences on the wall, such as God will bless you. Some receivers gave us some paper of the Christianity that has much information.   
<br />   They were glad to receive us visit the church.When we arrived at the church, the activity of religious service was beginning. In the church, there is a clergyman lead the entire religious believers to sing songs. Some people told us that they were praising the god. Everyone was pious, because they were Christians. Sometime later, the clergyman started to reading the bible and introducing some useful books of the god.
<br />   We couldn’t take picture in the church and we needed to keep quiet when the clergyman was talking. There were also some common people to do the religious service. The clergyman talked the belief of the people, and he thought that god can save you. If you believe Jesus, you can be helped when you did the wrong things. At the end of the religious service, many people were talking with each other and got the different ideas from different people.

<br />      My first time to do volunteer work is in the Nanjing Foreign Language Bookstore. Many students tell me that the bookshop is a good place to do volunteer work. It is located near the downtown. My friends and I usually go to the bookshop at the weekend or holiday, and we had learnt a lot of things.
<br />     We went to the bookstore on the morning, and start to doing volunteer work. First, we swept the floor because there weren’t many people in the bookstore. The work in the bookstore told us how to do it well, and then we can make the floor clean quickly. Sometime later, the people and readers were coming in. Most of them are teenagers and students who study the foreign languages. They found the books that they want to look or buy, and they maybe just read or enjoy in the bookstore. Some people couldn’t find their favorite book, so ask for us, and sometimes we had ability to find them, but we weren’t very familiar with the bookstore, then we need to ask for the works in the bookstore.
<br />   In our free time, we can read the English book that we want to read, because the bookstore has many useful and sundry books. It is a good chance for us to study or read in a peaceful environment.
<br />   Sometimes, we need to arrange these books and we hope the books are neat, so the reader can feel comfortable in the bookstore. I think that it is a hard work for us to do. Actually, my thought was right, because the there are so many books and bookcases. We must find the types of the books so that we can know that where the books go. Each person arranged one area, and was in charge of it. We moved the books carefully, and some books were really heavy, so we helped each other. During our work, we would discover some books were broken, and then we gave the books to librarians. The work was so boring, and we just kept doing, but we wanted to finish our tasks. The librarians are very kind, and they can help us when we meet some problems
<br />   After arranging books, we need to clean the bookcases. This is our final work. The librarians told us that don’t make the books wet when we clean the bookcases. It means that we need do it very carefully. Some the people looked at, and chatted with us, because I think that they are curious about what we do. When they knew that we did volunteer work, they commended us and said it is a good for students to do some volunteer or social work.
<br />   Finally we finished our work and everything was good. We felt tired, but we knew that we did very well. I think when we do some work; we should know what we need to do. The most important thing is that we work with other people and help each other.

Food Culture Club is very attractive me because I like to taste many different foods from different countries. Food represents a culture of a country and each country has special traditional food or snacks. The background of a country will affect their dairy food and life. I am very interested in food culture club, and I can enjoy different food and chat with my friend about foreign countries. 
<br />   Our club time is open, and we usually talk about where we can go on the internet, and we do activity at weekends. Many of the Grade 10 students join and we make a lot of new friends. Amily hold activities many times, and one of the most unforgivable time is that we tasted the typical sushi in a small Japanese food shop. The sushi food shop is in the underground station, and many young people are willing to go and buy sushi. 200 AD after the Han era, China has begun to spread, &quot;Sushi&quot;. Many farmers eat sushi just to flee. AD 700, the Nara era, the Japanese outbound business travel business will spread into the sushi in Japan, then Japanese, marinated with some rice vinegar, plus some seafood or meat, pressed into a small, neatly arranged within a small wooden box, as the food along. Until 1700, the Edo years, the sushi was widely circulated in Japan, enduring, as a common good food. And sushi was welcomed. Sushi rice must be the material. Authentic Japanese sushi is with a little fat and slightly sweet Japanese rice. Cooked rice, add the right amount of sushi vinegar, sugar, salt and other seasonings, to be used to make sushi after cooling. In Japanese, there many seafood and chefs put them into the sushi, and it is very delicious. 
<br />This sushi shop is called Kyoto sushi. My favorite sushi is salmon sushi. Salmon meat is fresh and soft. Eating raw salmon is the most nutritious way. Each sushi cost about five RMB which is not very expensive. There are many ingredients we can put into the sushi. Authentic sushi can be sour, sweet, bitter, spicy, salty, and other flavors. Therefore, eating sushi should be based on the type of sushi to go with Sami material. For example, eating sushi, because of filling in their remaining fish, shrimp, we need to dip in soy sauce, thick mouth and smear the right amount of wasabi. When you eat perfect sushi, a special feeling will appear on you tip of tongue Simple as a delicious, natural for the taste, the reason why Japanese gradually become common practice throughout the world, loved by more and more because of this.
<br />We can eat sushi anywhere; it is a kind of famous Asian food about rice. I was very happy to enjoy the sushi with my classmates.

The artist just use blue and yellow to paint, then draw the different shades and shadows to make the color different. The background is the dark blue sky and white cloud, and the colors are made lovely by the artist. The ocean is wide peaceful and the blue color becomes lighter far away. The soft cloud like cotton candy flow on the sky, and the sun hide behind the cloud, then the light through the cloud out. The cliff is in front of the view, and it is yellow and brown, so there are not any grasses on it. The color of cliff and color of ocean have big contrast, and attractive people. I also realize that the artist has artistic talent, and he is in deep love the sea, hill, cloud and river.
<br />   Some the some town and steam can arouse the artist’s inspirations. In the exhibition, there are some paintings about Chinese farm. When I saw this painting, I know that they are the view of Loess Plateau because the yellow- brown land and trees without leaves are the clean symbol. In the painting, the background is a grass house which is common in Chinese farm. There some withered trees in front of the house because the weather in the north of china is dry. A woman led a white horse walk across the trees, and she wears a long coat and trouser because the wind is strong in plateau. This painting is real and pastoral, the sky is colored in light blue; the trees and the land are both yellow and brown. The women and her horse are drawn vivid, she has a big red scarf to prevent the hard weather, and we can only see her eyes on his face. Her clothe is colorful just like a flower on the land. This painting expresses the farmer’s life and the view of the plateau.
<br />   This artist is careful and attentive to draw his painting. In his art, we can see different views and drawing styles. I certainly enjoy this Natural Image exhibition.

Basically, we need to keep our bodies strong and health, and then we have enough energy to do what we want to do. I am interested in doing sports and do exercises with friends. Playing basketball, swimming, go hiking and dancing are my hobbies, and they are good for my health. Last year, I spent most of my free time to dance popping; this year, I sometimes play basketball with my classmates at weekend. 
<br />   I like to play basketball because I think that it excites my body to move, and I can release my stress and relax. Many boys do well in playing basketball, I am not very good at it, but my friends Robert is an expert. We usually choose a day which is sunny and cool to play basketball. Robert’s home is near the Nanjing Olympic Center, so it is convenient for a basketball court and the courts are free open for citizens. One day, afternoon, we went to the sports center together, and there were many empty places. Robert is not very tall, but he is quite quick and easily shoots a ball. I am taller than he, but I am a greener and do not have many advanced skills. Robert told me that one of the most important things of basketball is to cooperate because a simple player cannot defeat a perfect team. We play as a team; I am in charge of Rebound and defense. Robert is a shooter, and he can find any chance to get point as long as I do great in defense.
<br />   Other team’s centre was especially strong and as tall as me. I was weak to play with him and I cannot keep use body to compete. Because of this case, Robert lost many good positions to shoot, and he thought we need to change our tactical when we were in danger. I need to use bounce pass to give Robert ball quickly, and I became a screen for Robert to shoot or layup. This way made our attack faster than before. The other team did not prepare well for us new change and became panic. I do not contact with strong centre, and keep the body low, and then wait to catch the ball. Robert had a good ball handing and always was ready to shoot. We had continuity offense to against other team and the other team’s defensive mind was broken. The time goes fast, the environment was darker and the basketball game had to end.
<br />   Robert and I were tried and thirsty but we both enjoyed the process of the sports. I also learnt a lot about the basketball skill and practice my muscle. Sports make our life wonderful, in my free time, I went to play golf with my father and go hiking with my classmates.

It also supplies opportunities for us to do volunteer, and the manager in the bookstore also gives us different assignment every time. 
<br />   One day morning, I decided to go to the bookstore with my friends, and it was a hot day. There were not any people in the bookstore because it is too early. We meet the manager in the office, and she was glad to see us at weekends. A bookstore needs many people to work because the environment have to keep clean, the book should be arrange in order after people read, and help the readers to find what kinds of books they want. The manager gives us dusters and a bucket to clean the windows and bookcase. It is a simple task for us to do but makes us feel tiring. During the working, gradually, more and more people came to the bookstore, and we keep clean in the peace. I discovered that the bookstore has thousands of books for different readers to read and research when I was polishing the windows. We used many buckets of water to wash the dirty dusters after clean the bookcase, it was tiring just like doing the housework. 
<br />After a short rest, we were going to sweep the floor, and a beautiful environment will make readers feel more comfortable. The workers in the bookstore were pleased for us to help them do the clean. I was happy to work with my friends, and we were chatting with each other during the work, then the time goes fast. The manager told us that we need to know the different types of books in different places, because we should be the guides for some new readers and solve their problems when we were working. It is meaningful for us to practice to communicate with other people. Some people were surprised to see the volunteer in the bookstore, and they both realized that we are librarians; However, some problems of the readers that we cannot solve, and then we ask manager for help. In the free time, I liked to read some English novels, most of them were attractive and I can learn some new vocabularies.
<br />At last, the manager was satisfied with us and she thought that we help the bookstore a lot. We were confident to our assignments, and we also enjoyed the books. Some my classmates also do the volunteer in the underground. It is a tuff work like a guide for different passengers. Many people get lost or they do not know how to go into the underground, and they need volunteer help. In fact, we can learn a lot in the volunteer work and try our best to help other people.
