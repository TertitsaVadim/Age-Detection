<br /><br />Why Is It Myself That I Blame,
<br />Why Do I Feel a Shame...
<br />Why Do I Feel, Like Dirth?
<br />Why Did I Come On This Eerth?
<br /><br />Everyday I Cry
<br />That I Just Wanna Die!
<br />That I Can Leave This Place
<br />That Everything's A Closed Case!
<br /><br />Nerver I Will Find Happines
<br />Never She'll Give Me Forgivenis!
<br />(.......) You Know I Really Like You
<br />I Mean It, It's True!
<br /><br />Please Forgive Me My Mistake!
<br />I Know There Is No Way I Can Escape
<br />From The Quilt I'm Feeling
<br />It Has Already Grown To The Seeling
<br /><br />Promises U Can&quot;t Keep
<br />I Only Wanna Weep
<br />I Sit Here And Pray
<br />And Hope That One Day
<br />You'll Say
<br /><br />I'll Stay.....

<br /><br />Closed off from love 
<br />I didn’t need the pain 
<br />Once or twice was enough 
<br />And it was all in vain 
<br />Time starts to pass 
<br />Before you know it you’re frozen 
<br /><br />But something happened 
<br />For the very first time with you 
<br />My heart melts into the ground 
<br />Found something true 
<br />And everyone’s looking round 
<br />Thinking I’m going crazy
<br /><br />But I don’t care what they say 
<br />I’m in love with you 
<br />They try to pull me away 
<br />But they don’t know the truth 
<br />My heart’s crippled by the vein 
<br />That I keep on closing 
<br />You cut me open and I 
<br /><br />Keep bleeding 
<br />Keep, keep bleeding love 
<br />I keep bleeding 
<br />I keep, keep bleeding love 
<br />Keep bleeding 
<br />Keep, keep bleeding love 
<br />You cut me open 
<br /><br />Trying hard not to hear 
<br />But they talk so loud 
<br />Their piercing sounds fill my ears 
<br />Try to fill me with doubt 
<br />Yet I know that the goal 
<br />Is to keep me from falling

<br />Witness Me
<br />I Am Outside
<br />Give Me Peace
<br />Heaven Holds A Sense Of Wonder
<br />And I Wanted To Believe That I'd Get Caught Up When The Rage In Me Subsides
<br /><br />Passion Choke The Flower
<br />Until She Cries No More
<br />Possessing All The Beauty
<br />Hungry Still For More!
<br /><br />Heaven Holds A Sense Of Wonder
<br />And I Wanted To Believe That I'd Get Caught Up When The Rage In Me Subsides!
<br /><br />In This White Wave, I Am Seeking, In This Silence
<br />In This White Wave, In This Silence I Believe
<br />I Can't Help This Longing Comfort me
<br />I Can't Hold It All In
<br />If You Won't Let Me
<br /><br />Heaven Holds A Sense Of Wonder
<br />And I Wanted To Believe That I'd Get Caught Up When The Rage In Me Subsides
<br />In This Silence I Believe
<br />I Am Seeking
<br />In This Silence
<br />In This White Wave
<br />In This Silence I Believe
<br />I Have Seen You In This Violence You Were Silent
<br />You Are Breathing In This White Wave
<br /><br />I AM FREE!!!!

<br /><br />I've been caged by you for such a long long time
<br />You had your own particular way to fill my mind
<br />With low esteem, regarding myself
<br />So I kept me hidden within my shell
<br />And it took so long for me to see
<br />How demolishing you were to me
<br /><br />Look at me now I'm stronger than before
<br />Cause I found the strength within myself to close the door
<br />And I closed the door for you to ever come inside again
<br />I've tried so hard to keep me sheltered from your kind of men
<br /><br />I've been blind and foolish but I was just a girl
<br />You seduced me with your lies and promissed me the world
<br />Now I've had it with you and your twisted games
<br />And no longer will you make me feel so ashamed
<br />I have found the power to open the cage
<br />I left you behind me I turned the page 
<br /><br />Look at me now I'm stronger than before
<br />'cause I found the strength within myself to close the door
<br />and I closed the door for you to ever come inside again
<br />I've tried so hard to keep me sheltered from your kind of men 
<br /><br />Look at me now...
<br /><br />I've been caged by you for such a long long time
<br />You had your own particular way to fill my mind
<br />With low esteem, regarding myself
<br />So I kept me hidden within my shell
<br />And it took so long for me to see
<br />How demolishing you were to me
<br /><br />Look at me now, look at me now...
<br /><br />Some time ago I walked away
<br />You tought I'd never be the same
<br />I recovered on my own
<br />Without you now I'll cary on
<br /><br />Look at me now I'm stronger than before
<br />'cause I found the strength within myself to close the door
<br />and I closed the door for you to ever come inside again
<br />I've tried so hard to keep me sheltered from your kind of men 
<br /><br />Look at me now I'm stronger than before
<br />'cause I found the strength within myself to close the door
<br />and I closed the door for you to ever come inside again

<br />Not everything lasts
<br />I understand that now
<br />Everything changed
<br />When you walked away
<br />But I'll survive somehow
<br />Though I have regrets
<br />I'll learn to forget
<br />And just keep moving on
<br />Cause when love is gone
<br />You have to be strong
<br />Once touched by pain
<br />You're not the same
<br />But time can heal
<br />Your heart again
<br />So let the clouds
<br />That bring you down
<br />Just fade away
<br />Away
<br /><br />So I try to smile
<br />But after a while
<br />The memories come back
<br />But I won't give in
<br />Cause I know that then
<br />My heart will fade to black
<br /><br />And this time I learned
<br />That love can burn
<br />There's no right or wrong
<br /><br />I've got to be strong
<br /><br />Once touched by pain
<br />You're not the same
<br />But time can heal
<br />Your heart again
<br />So let the clouds
<br />That bring you down
<br />Just fade away
<br />Away
<br /><br />I know that one day I'll find that feeling again
<br />But until I do I'll do fine by myself
<br /><br />Once touched by pain
<br />You're not the same
<br />But time can heal
<br />Your heart again
<br />So let the clouds
<br />That bring you down
<br />You know that
<br /><br />Once touched by pain
<br />You're not the same
<br />But time can heal
<br />Your heart again
<br />So let the clouds
<br />That bring you down
<br />So let the clouds
<br />That bring you down
<br />Just fade away
<br />Away</em>

<br />I told you lies
<br />I thought the truth would set you free 
<br /><br />Surprise surprise
<br />It isn't all as it seems
<br />But who knew you'd wake up from your dreams 
<br /><br />If I told you myself
<br />Could've saved you the hell
<br />Now look who's sorry
<br />God I'm so sorry
<br />It was never the right time
<br />I guess it's do or die 
<br /><br />Just when you think you've got me figured out
<br />Just when you think you know me well
<br />baby you've barely even broke the ice
<br />My river runs wide and you're not inside
<br />But you're closer than you were tonight 
<br /><br />I'm a chamaleon
<br />And every spots hiding my scars 
<br /><br />But I will survive
<br />Cause I'll only let you in
<br />When I can be sure of who you are 
<br /><br />You can call it a game
<br />But it's me playing safe
<br />God that's so sorry
<br />I'm just sorry
<br />What can I say
<br />It's hard trying to stay alive 
<br /><br />Just when you think you've got me figured out
<br />Just when you think you know me well
<br />baby you've barely even broke the ice
<br />My river runs wide and you're not inside
<br />But you're closer than you were tonight 
<br /><br />And It's in your eyes
<br />That it's all or nothing
<br />What I can't disguise
<br />Is that you're on to something
<br />if I let myself go
<br />Will you still want me
<br />Will I be enough
<br />The fear of that haunts me
<br />Cause what if you walk away 
<br /><br />Just when you think you've got me figured out
<br />Just when you think you know me well
<br />baby you've barely even broke the ice
<br />My river runs wide and you're not inside
<br />But you're closer than you were tonight</span>
