<br />Before leaving he says to the sales clerk, &quot;I hope you don't mind me asking, but how old do you think I am?&quot; 
<br />&quot;About 35,&quot; was the reply. 
<br />&quot;I'm actually 47,&quot; the man says happily. 
<br />A little while later he goes to McDonald's for lunch and asks the order taker the same question, to which the reply is, &quot;I'd guess that you're 29?&quot;
<br />&quot;Nope, I am actually 47.&quot; He's starting to feel really good about himself.
<br />While standing at the bus stop he asks an old woman the same question. 
<br />She replies, &quot;I am 85 years old and my eyesight is going. But when I was young there was a sure way of telling a man's age. If I put my hand down your pants and play with your penis for ten minutes I will be able to tell your exact age.&quot; 
<br />As there was no one else around the man thought what the hell and let her slip her hand down his pants. 
<br />Ten minutes later the old lady says, &quot;OK, it's done. You are 47,&quot; 
<br />Stunned the man says, &quot;That was brilliant! How did you do that?&quot; 
<br />The old lady replies, &quot;I was behind you in McDonald's&quot;.

<br />They are both quite startled. The man turns to her and says, &quot;Ma'am, if your heart is as soft as your breast, I know you'll forgive me.&quot; 
<br />She replies, &quot;If your penis is as hard as your elbow, I'm in room 436.&quot;

<br /><br />lets see if it works....
<br /><br />I am taking the bait -
<br />what do I have to lose right?
<br /><br />Hope it works!
<br /><br />Supposedly The Phone Will Ring
<br />Right After You Do This.
<br /><br />Just read the little stories and
<br />think of a wish as you scroll all
<br />the way to the bottom. There is
<br />a message there - then make your
<br />wish.
<br /><br />No attachment on this one.
<br /><br />Stories
<br /><br />I'm 13 years old, and I wished
<br />that my dad would come home from
<br />the army, because he'd been having
<br />problems with his heart and right
<br />leg. It was 2:53 p.m . When I made
<br />my wish. At 3:07 p.m. (14 minutes
<br />later), the doorbell rang, and
<br />there my Dad was, luggage and all!!
<br /><br />I'm Katie and I'm 20 and I've been
<br />having trouble in my job and on the
<br />verge of quitting. I made a simple
<br />wish that my boss would get a new
<br />job. That was at 1:35 and at 2:55
<br />there was an announcement that he
<br />was promoted and was leaving for
<br />another city. Believe me...this
<br />really works!!!
<br /><br />My name is Ann and I am 45 years
<br />of age. I had always been single
<br />and had been hoping to get into a
<br />nice, loving relationship for many
<br />years. While kind of daydreaming
<br />(and right after receiving this email)
<br />I wished that a quality person would
<br />finally come into my life. That was at
<br />9:10 AM on a Tuesday. At 9:55 AM
<br />a FedEx delivery man came into my
<br />office.He was cute, polite and
<br />could not stop smiling at me. He
<br />started coming back almost everyday
<br />(even without packages) and asked me
<br />out a week later. We married 6
<br />months later and now have been
<br />happily married for 2 years.
<br /><br />What a great email it was!!
<br /><br />Just scroll down to the end, but
<br />while you do, think of a wish.
<br />Make your wish when you have completed
<br />scrolling. Whatever age you are, is the
<br />number of minutes it will take for your
<br />wish to come true. ex.you are 25 years
<br />old, it will take 25 minutes for your wish
<br />to come true).
<br /><br />However, if you don't send this to
<br />people in 5 minutes, you will have bad
<br />luck for years!!
<br /><br />Go for it!!!
<br /><br />SCROLL DOWN!!!!

<br />Behind my clothes, the secrets lie,

<br />That lives inside of me.
<br />Please listen carefully to her---
<br />She'll show that she's insecure.
<br />Please try to be a friend to her
<br />And show her that you care.
<br />Please just get to know her

<br />she committed suicide.
<br />She was teased and had no friends
<br />Because she wasn't pretty or thin. 
<br />I'm really close friends with her brother.
<br />That is how I know of her.
<br />She attended my high school,
<br />but ended her life cause she felt uncool. 
<br /><br />She was lonely, didn't know what else to do.
<br />She felt scared, had no one to turn to.
<br />She thought that ending her life
<br />would suddenly make everything right. 
<br /><br />She left, leaving loved ones in despair,
<br />not knowing that people really do care.
<br />At first when I heard about it, I chose to ignore,
<br />But when I realized it was her, my heart hit the floor. 
<br /><br />I've never met her, but I'm sure if I did,
<br />I'd be her friend, no doubt about it.
<br />She was so young, only fourteen.
<br />I hate it when other people have to be so mean. 
<br /><br />Only if people would have more respect,
<br />her soul wouldn't have been laid to rest.
<br />Her brother tells me a lot of nice things about her.
<br />She had everything planned, even her future. 
<br /><br />Now she can't come through with her dreams.
<br />Only if she knew, happiness is so much more than it seems.
<br />she listened to the negative things people said,
<br />ignored the nice things that went through her head. 
<br /><br />Told herself she was worthless, not one of a kind.
<br />Every day it would lurk though her mind.
<br />She fluttered through life with barely a care,
<br />ignored all happiness and what waited there. 
<br /><br />This is what I've heard from her brother.
<br />She was the best sister, unlike no other.
<br />If only people wouldn't judge a book by it's cover,
<br />'Cause the person you see on the outside
<br />may on the inside be another.

<br />I once knew,
<br />Never smiled once,
<br />She was always blue. 
<br />We played some games,
<br />She laughed until she cried,
<br />But the sadness never left her eyes
<br />Until the day she died. 
<br /><br />She would lie in her bed
<br />With tears in her eyes,
<br />Never thinking we all loved her,
<br />He filled her head with lies. 
<br /><br />She ran to the bathroom,
<br />Took every pill in there.
<br />She took a blade to her wrists,
<br />Never knowing we would care. 
<br /><br />She looked peaceful
<br />For the first time in her life.
<br />We loved her so, but she
<br />Was an abusive man's wife. 
<br /><br />Now she's gone, in heaven,
<br />But we still cry.
<br />Because of that asshole,
<br />An angel had to die.

<br />so don't try it.
<br />Suicide isn't quick, 
<br />it's long and painful.
<br />Suicide never used to be me, 
<br />but now it is.
<br />Suicide was never calming, 
<br />always away to have so much pain it didn't hurt anymore.
<br />Suicide has to be a blade, 
<br />so don't get pricked.
<br />Suicide is apart of love, 
<br />so don't love the wrong people.
<br />Suicide and death are close, 
<br />so don't flirt with them.
<br />Suicide never tells the the truth, 
<br />always belive the oppsite.
<br />Suicide kills slowly, 
<br />keep that in mind.
<br />Suicide will always be here, 
<br />so get used to it.
<br />Suicide takes over, 
<br />don't let it
<br />Suicide will eventually bite you, 
<br />bite back harder.
<br />Suicide will never die, 
<br />you will but it won't be to it.
<br />Suicide works well with your wrist, 
<br />so don't let it.
<br />Suicide is always there you just can't see it, 
<br />so open your eyes.

<br />And you may think I'm hurting inside 
<br />You may even decide to get violent 
<br />But do you really think I am going to hide? 
<br />You may be a lot bigger than me 
<br />And you may have won every fight 
<br />You may have damaged so many people 
<br />But how on earth do you sleep at night? 
<br />Knowing that so many people 
<br />Are running scared from your fist 
<br />And when somebody decides to stand up to you 
<br />Hitting them is hard to resist 
<br />Lots of people look up to you 
<br />Coz they are scared if they don't you'll turn sour 
<br />I bet half of them just think you're a bully 
<br />But when you say something to them, they just cower 
<br />So no one really idolizes you 
<br />And nobody wants to follow your path 
<br />They're just scared to open their mouths to you 
<br />Some of them won't even laugh 
<br />You have everybody below you 
<br />Obeying your every demand 
<br />But if somebody bigger and harder came along 
<br />You would bury your head in the sand 
<br />You think it's good to pick on people 
<br />And point out anything you can 
<br />Two children tried their best to challenge you 
<br />While the majority of them just ran 
<br />These two brave little soldiers 
<br />Were taught to stand up for their rights 
<br />But you being the bully you are 
<br />Saw it as an excuse for a fight 
<br />So you made them both feel like nothing 
<br />You sent them crying on their way home 
<br />They didn't want to admit that you bully them 
<br />So they felt they had to fight you alone 
<br />So you continued to bully them 
<br />You knew they wouldn't tell 
<br />And when the parents asked where the bruises came from 
<br />They used to say they fell 
<br />But the truth is if they had told someone 
<br />They wouldn't be where they are 
<br />But your name would have been shamed and laughed at 
<br />And you would not have won by far 
<br />But instead they took the punches 
<br />And they didn't say a word 
<br />Coz they thought no matter how hard they screamed 
<br />Their voices would never be heard 
<br />They thought it would make it worse 
<br />If they told someone what you did 
<br />So instead they waited for school to end 
<br />And until you were gone they hid 
<br />So all thanks to you not long ago 
<br />Two young bodies were found 
<br />And now they are nothing but bones 
<br />As they lie 6 feet under the ground 
<br />And nothing anyone does will change that 
<br />They obviously found it too hard to cope 
<br />You made them wish they weren't born 
<br />But to you it's just a joke 
<br />To me you are a murderer 
<br />Coz you made two kids want to die 
<br />You robbed them of their happiness 
<br />And you took away their lives 
<br />You may not have actually killed them 
<br />But you killed them deep inside 
<br />You tore at their emotions 
<br />And they knew they had nowhere to hide 
<br />So they did what they thought they had to do 
<br />Their pain was too great to mend 
<br />They wanted to go somewhere you couldn't find them 
<br />And they knew you couldn't hurt them again 
<br />But now think of both their families 
<br />How each day is another struggle 
<br />They can't hold their children's hands anymore 
<br />They can't reach out to them for a cuddle 
<br />You can live your life now 
<br />You can still target your dreams 
<br />But for the families that have lost their kids, 
<br />Well their lives have been ripped at the seams 
<br />I hope one day someone bullies you 
<br />And I hope you wish you were dead 
<br />And I hope each day is a battle 
<br />And you wish you'd stayed in bed 
<br />Children are dead because of you 
<br />And you've left so many lives in a mess 
<br />All because you’re just a coward 
<br />Who bullied two children to death
