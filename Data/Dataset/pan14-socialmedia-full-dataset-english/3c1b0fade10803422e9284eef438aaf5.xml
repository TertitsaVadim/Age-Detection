<br /><br />Most girls dont know how much power they have over guys. if a girl wants something all they have to do is ask and they will probobly get it, especialy is the girl is asking for sex or something to do with sex.
<br /><br />Guys hate sluts even though they have sex with them!
<br /><br />&quot;Hey, are you busy?&quot; or &quot;Are you doing something?&quot; ~ Two phrases guys open with to stop from stammering on the phone
<br /><br />Guys may be flirting around all day but before they go to sleep, they always think about the girl they truly care about.
<br /><br />Before they call, guys try to plan out a little about what they're gonna say so there aren't awkward pauses, but once he's on the phone he forgets it all and makes it up as he goes.
<br /><br />Guys go crazy over a girl's smile.
<br /><br />Guys will do anything just to get you to notice him.
<br /><br />Guys hate it when you talk about your ex-boyfriend or ex love-interest. Unless they're going for the “let-her-complain-to-you-and-then-have-her-reali- - - - - ze-how-wonderful-and-nice-you-are” method.
<br /><br />A guy who likes you wants to be the only guy you talk to.
<br /><br />Boyfriends need to be reassured often that they're still loved.
<br /><br />Don't talk about your guy friends to your boyfriend.
<br /><br />Guys get jealous easily.
<br /><br />Guys are more emotional than they'd like people to think.
<br /><br />Giving a guy a hanging message like &quot;You know what?!..Uh...never mind..&quot; would make him jump to a conclusion that is far from what you are thinking. And he'll assume he did something wrong and he'll obsess about it trying to figure it out.
<br /><br />Guys are good flatterers when courting but they usually stammer when they talk to a girl they really like.
<br /><br />Guys hate asking parents for money to buy girls presents. So they come up with ideas like saving their lunch money for a week. But it never works because guys are always hungry so they end up asking the parents for money &gt;anyway.
<br /><br />Girls are guys' weaknesses.
<br /><br />Guys are very open about themselves.
<br />It's good to test a guy first before you trust him. But don't let him wait too long.
<br />Your best friend, whom your boyfriend seeks help from about his problems with you may end up being admired by your boyfriend.
<br /><br />If a guy tells you about his problems, he just needs someone to listen to him. You don't need to give advice.
<br /><br />A usual act that proves that the guy likes you is when he teases you.
<br /><br />Guys love you more than you love them if they are serious in your relationships.
<br /><br />Guys will brag about anything.
<br /><br />Guys use words like hot or cute to describe girls. We rarely use beautiful. If a guy uses that, he likes you a whole hell of a lot.
<br /><br />Guys think WAY too much. One small thing a girl does, even if she doesn't notice it can make the guy think about it for hours, trying to figure out what it meant.
<br /><br />Guys seek for advice from girls not other guys. Because most guys think alike, so if one guy's confused, then we're all confused.
<br /><br />Any guy could write out a rulebook or advice book for flirting, but no guy can write out a book about relationships.
<br /><br />Try to be as straightforward as possible.
<br />A guy has to experience rejection, because if he's too-good-never-been-busted, never been in love and hurt, he won't be mature and grown up.
<br /><br />If the guy does something stupid in front of the girl, he will think &gt;about it for the next couple days or until the next time he spends time with the girl.
<br /><br />No matter how much guys talk about asses and boobs, personality is key.
<br />Guys learn from experience not from the romance books that girls read and take as their basis of experience.
<br /><br />Guys worry about the thin line between being compassionate and being whipped.
<br />If a guy looks unusually calm and laid back, he's probably faking it and is spazzing inside.
<br />When a guy says he is going crazy about the girl, he really is. Guys rarely say that.
<br />When a guy asks you to leave him alone, he's just actually saying, &quot;Please come and listen to me.&quot;
<br /><br />Guys don't really have final decisions.
<br />If a guy starts to talk seriously, listen to him. It doesn't happen that often, so when it does, you know something's up.
<br />If your best guy friend seems to avoid you or is never around when you're with your boyfriend, he's probably jealous and likes you.
<br />When a guy looks at you for longer than a second, he's definitely thinking something.
<br /><br />Guys like femininity not feebleness.
<br /><br />Guys don't like girls who punch harder than they do unless Ur dating then he wont punch hard and just likes to let u win just to see u smile
<br /><br />A guy has more problems than you can see with your naked eyes.
<br /><br />Don't be a snob. Guys can be intimidated and give up easily.
<br /><br />Everything in moderation. Put on makeup, wear perfume. Just not too much.
<br /><br />Guys talk about girls more than girls talk about guys.
<br /><br />Guys hate rejection, but they hate being led on even more.
<br /><br />Guys really think that girls are strange and have unpredictable decisions and are MAD confusing but somehow are drawn even more to them.
<br /><br />A guy would give his left nut to be able to read a girl's mind for a day.
<br /><br />No guy can handle all his problems on his own. He's just too stubborn to admit it.
<br /><br />Not all guys are assholes. Just because ONE is a jackass doesn’t mean he represents ALL of us.
<br /><br />We don't like girls who are too skinny.
<br /><br />We love it when girls talk about there boobs.
<br /><br />Always make sure you know what kind of stuff your getting into before making out with a guy ...like whether it's a one time deal or not ....
<br /><br />Believe it or not shy guys are the most easiest to talk to. it may not seem right but trust me they will start opening up like books after you just ask them questions about their lives and unnoticeable tell them about yours...
<br /><br />When a guy hits your butt it means that he wants you sexually
<br /><br />Even if they refuse it all guys are ticklish on the ribs.
<br /><br />Guys love neck rubs and if he lets you keep doing it ..It means that he really likes you or his neck really hurts...
<br /><br />Guys will test the waters to see how far they can get with you. Even if he doesn't intend to it will happen. Know how far it is you want to let him go and he will respect that...after you let him know a couple times.
<br /><br />When a guy sacrifices his sleep and health just to be with you, he really likes you and wants to be with you as much as possible.
<br />guys who are taken spend every night in bed thinking about you because to a guy he's girl is he's one true love and if a guy loses that love it will crush him it has such an effect on him that the guy can't go on with he's life because he's heart which has been opened has now been broken so don't hurt us guys
<br /><br />Guys if you don't repost this in one hr then you will lose the girl of your life.

Dont get me wrong , i know there are plenty of girls out there who arent like this at all , but i have put up with too much of this bullshit over and over again. Im sure any guys that take the time to read this know where im coming from , we may not act like it , but when we lose the one thing we thought we might not have to look for again , it hurts us to the core, especially if theres alot of memories and special times that they have had with you. Us guys just wanna be loved and not hurt, is it too much to ask ? Maybe it is but just think about it girls , cos if theres one thing guys hate, its being made to feel like some kind of cruel joke.

<br />To all the girls who look past the nice guys
<br /><br />Message:
<br />I'm sorry
<br />that i bought you roses
<br />to tell you that i like you
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />That I was raised with respect
<br />not to sleep with you when you were drunk
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />That my body's not ripped enough
<br />to &quot;satisfy&quot; your wants
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />that I open your car door,
<br />and pull out your chair like I was raised
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />That I'm not cute enough
<br />to be &quot;your guy&quot;
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />That I am actually nice;
<br />not a jerk
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />I don't have a huge bank account
<br />to buy you expensive things
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />I like to spend quality nights at home
<br />cuddling with you, instead of at a club
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />I would rather make love to you then just screw you
<br />like some random guy.
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />That I always held your hair back when you threw up,and didn't get mad at you for puking in my car,
<br />but when we went out you went home with another guy
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />That I am there to pick you up at 4am when your new man hit you and dropped you off in the middle of nowhere,
<br />but not good enough to listen to me when I need a friend
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />If I start not being there, and being used as a door mat, only to be thrown to the side when the new jerk comes around
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />If I don't answer my phone anymore when you call, to listen to you cry for hours, instead of getting a couple hours of sleep before work
<br /><br />I'm sorry that you can't realize.. I've been the one all along.
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />If you read this and know somebody like this
<br />but don't care But most of all
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />For not being sorry anymore
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />That you can't accept me for who I am
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />I can never do anything right, and nothing that I do is good
<br />enough to make it in your world.
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />I caught your bf with another girl and told you about it, I thought that was what friends were for...
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />That I told you I loved you and actually meant it.
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />That I talked to you for nine hours on Thanksgiving when your bf was threatening you instead of spending time with my family
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />that I listen to you at night talking about how you wish you could have done something different.
<br /><br />Ladies always complain and gripe to their friends that there is never any good guys out there, and they always end up with jerks who mistreat them. Well ladies next time you're complaining, maybe look up to see who you're complaining to, maybe that special someone is right there hanging on your every word as usual, screaming in his head &quot;Why won't you give me a chance?&quot; Because the person you are usually searching for is right by you.
<br /><br />If you're a guy and you agree with this letter, repost as &quot;I'm sorry &quot;
<br /><br />If You're one of the FEW girls with enough BALLS to repost, and you would never make your guy feel this way, repost as Subject To all the girls who look past the nice guys

Godammit people , if i wanted to be added as a friend and not even chat with you , then id ask for that. But im not so bad luck . I've been thinking about this for awhile and ive come up with a reason why this pointless phenomena occurs. So that the &quot;adder&quot; (not the snake) can look really cool, because they have 3482576 friends , not because they are actually interested, but so they look &quot;popular&quot; on this website , because out there in the real world , they are the kids who sit in the corners and dont try to make real friends! For example i have 219 friends, not a fact that im proud of because ive probably held a decent conversation with maybe 30 of them. So that means the other 189 peopel added me with no ontention to talk at all. TIs a weird and strange thing people anyways hope you enjoy it , ill write more soon.

I love emos , they have some of the best goddam taste in music in the world!! not to mention a kick ass style of dress sense<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" /> But the best thing about em , is that they have broken out of comformity and added a bit of that good old diversity to that thing we like to call life. Some of my best mates are &quot;emo&quot; and to be honest i wouldnt have em any other way, because if i didnt i wouldnt play in bands that produce some kick ass music, and its cos of these friends of mine that our music has something people can relate to , check out my songs in other blogs , you can see that most people can relate to the feelings expressed in them. SO to all you emo haters get on with life , because you are boring , and hate what you cant understand.
<br />Peace out !!

I dunno how to honestly describe it , i guess love could be one way to describe it  but thats just one of the feelings i experience when i hear their voice, when i see that its their name on the message i just recieved. Its a beautiful experience to just feel complete and alive and even if we may be worlds apart, i feel that they are next to me. You know who you are baby. One day we are gonna be together, i honestly hope we will be. If the sky falls apart , the world crumbles and i feel like i have nothing left, ill always think of the happiness you gave me. Thankyou.

<br /><br />Rule Two: You do not touch my daughter in front of me. You may glance at her, so long as you do not peer at anything below her neck. If you cannot keep your eyes or hands off of my daughter's body, I will remove them.
<br /><br />Rule Three: I am aware that it is considered fashionable for boys of your age to wear their trousers so loosely that they appear to be falling off their hips. Please don't take this as an insult, but you and all of your friends are complete idiots. Still, I want to be fair and open minded about this issue, so I propose this compromise: You may come to the door with your underwear showing and your pants ten sizes to big, and I will not object. However, in order to ensure that your clothes do not in fact come off during the course of your date with my daughter, I will take my electric nail gun and fasten your trousers securely in place to your waist.
<br /><br />Rule Four: I'm sure you've been told that in today's world, sex without utilizing a &quot;Barrier method&quot; of some kind can kill you. Let me elaborate, when it comes to sex, I am the barrier, and I will kill you.
<br /><br />Rule Five: It is usually understood that in order for us to get to know each other, we should talk about sports, politics, and other issues of the day. Please do not do this. The only information I require from you is an indication of when you expect to have my daughter safely back at my house, and the only word I need from you on this subject is: early.&quot;
<br /><br />Rule Six: I have no doubt you are a popular fellow, with many opportunities to date other girls. This is fine with me as long as it is okay with my daughter. Otherwise, once you have gone out with my little girl, you will continue to date no one but her until she is finished with you. If you make her cry, I will make you cry.
<br /><br />Rule Seven: As you stand in my front hallway, waiting for my daughter to appear, and more than an hour goes by, do not sigh and fidget. If you want to be on time for the movie, you should not be dating. My daughter is putting on her makeup, a process than can take longer than painting the Golden Gate Bridge. Instead of just standing there, why don't you do something useful, like changing the oil in my car?
<br /><br />Rule Eight: The following places are not appropriate for a date with my daughter:
<br />-Places where there are beds, sofas, or anything softer than a wooden stool.
<br />-Places where there is darkness.
<br />-Places where there is danceing, holding hands, or happiness.
<br />-Places where the ambient tamperature is warm enough to introduce my duaghter to wear shorts, tank tops, midriff T-shirts, or anything other than overalls, a sweater, and a goose down parka - zipped up to her throat.
<br />-Movies with a strong romantic or sexual theme are to be avoided; movies which features chain saws are okay. Hockey games are okay. Old folks homes are better.
<br /><br />Rule Nine: Do not lie to me. I may appear to be a potbellied, balding, middle-aged, dimwitted has-been. But on issues relating to my daughter, I am the all-knowing, merciless god of your universe. If I ask you where you are going and with whom, you have one chance to tell me the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. I have a shotgun, a shovel, and five acres behind the house. Do not trifle with me.
<br /><br />Rule Ten: Be afraid. Be very afraid. It takes very little for me to mistake the sound of your car in the driveway for a chopper coming in over a rice paddy near Hanoi. When my Agent Orange starts acting up, the voices in my head frequently tell me to clean the guns as I wait for you to bring my daughter home. As soon as you pull into the driveway you should exit the car with both hands in plain sight. Speak the perimeter password, announce in a clear voice that you have brought my daughter home safely and early, then return to your car - there is no need for you to come inside. The camouflaged face at the window is mine.

By now , you , reader, probably am confused as to what im talking about. What im talking about is how incredibly quickly people notice that a persons love status changes and begin to view the single persons more profile more critically , as if weighing up the pro's and con's of talking to them. i mean i guess it might just be me , but since i changed my status ,  so many people have been swinging by. Not to sound up myself , but it just raised the question in my head which has now become the topic of this blog. I can imagine there might have been some people that have thought about this. Ah well , it was a relatively short rant, expect more from me soon ,

<br />Ps. i know this wasnt very good

<br />These are our rules! 
<br /><br />(Please note... these are all numbered &quot;1&quot; ON PURPOSE!) 
<br /><br />1. Men are NOT mind readers. 
<br /><br />2. Learn to work the toilet seat. You're a big girl. If it's up, put it down. We need it up, you need it down. You don't hear us complaining about you leaving it down. 
<br /><br />3. Sunday sports. It's like the full moon or the changing of the tides. Let it be. 
<br /><br />4. Shopping is NOT a sport. And no, we are never going to think of it that way. 
<br /><br />5. Crying is blackmail. 
<br /><br />6. Ask for what you want. Let us be clear on this one: 
<br />Subtle hints do not work! 
<br />Strong hints do not work! 
<br />Obvious hints do not work! 
<br />Just say it! 
<br /><br />7. Yes and No are perfectly acceptable answers to almost every question.. 
<br /><br />8. Come to us with a problem only if you want help solving it. That's what we do. 
<br />Sympathy is what your girlfriends are for. 
<br /><br />9. A headache that lasts for 17 months is a problem. See a doctor. 
<br /><br />10. Anything we said 6 months ago is inadmissible in an argument. 
<br />In fact, all comments become null and void after 7 days. 
<br /><br />11. If you won't dress like the Victoria 's Secret girls, don't Expect us to 
<br />act like soap opera guys. 
<br /><br />12. If you think you're fat, you probably are. 
<br />Don't ask us. 
<br /><br />13. If something we said can be interpreted two ways and one of the ways makes you sad or angry, we meant the other one. 
<br /><br />14. You can either ask us to do something or tell us how you want it done. 
<br />Not both. If you already know best how to do it, just do it yourself. 
<br /><br />15. Whenever possible, please say whatever you have to say during commercials. 
<br /><br />16. Christopher Columbus did NOT need directions and neither do we. 
<br /><br />17. ALL men see in only 16 colors, like Windows default settings. Peach, for example, is a fruit, not a color. Pumpkin is also a fruit. We have no idea what mauve is. 
<br /><br />18. If we ask what is wrong and you say &quot;nothing,&quot; we will act like nothing's wrong. We know you are lying, but it is just not worth the hassle. 
<br /><br />19. If you ask a question you don't want an answer to, expect an answer you don't want to hear. 
<br /><br />20. When we have to go somewhere, absolutely anything you wear is fine.... 
<br />Really. 
<br /><br />21. Don't ask us what we're thinking about unless you are prepared to discuss such topics as football, rugby, the offside rule, or golf. 
<br /><br />22. You have enough clothes. 
<br /><br />23. You have too many shoes. 
<br /><br />24. I am in shape. Round IS a shape! 
<br /><br />Thank you for reading this. 
<br />Yes, I know, I have to sleep on the couch tonight; 
<br /><br />But did you know men really don't mind that? 
<br /><br />It's like camping. 
<br /><br />not all true... but it was good fun eh?

<br /><br />I never quite figured out why the sexual urge of men and women differ so much. And I never have figured out the whole Venus and Mars thing. I have never figured out why men think with their head and women with their heart. 
<br /><br />FOR EXAMPLE: 
<br /><br />One evening last week, my girlfriend and I were getting into bed. 
<br /><br />Well, the passion starts to heat up, and she eventually says, &quot;I don't feel like it, I just want you to hold me.&quot; 
<br /><br />I said, &quot;WHAT??!! What was that?!&quot; 
<br /><br />So she says the words that every boyfriend on the planet dreads to hear... 
<br /><br />&quot;You're just not in touch with my emotional needs as a woman enough for me to satisfy your physical needs as a man.&quot; 
<br /><br />She responded to my puzzled look by saying, &quot;Can't you just love me for who I am and not what I do for you in the bedroom?&quot; 
<br /><br />Realizing that nothing was going to happen that night, I went to sleep. 
<br /><br />The very next day I opted to take the day off of work to spend time with her. We went out to a nice lunch and then went shopping at a big, big unnamed department store. I walked around with her while she tried on several different very expensive outfits. She couldn't decide which one to take, so I told her we'd just buy them all. She wanted new shoes to compliment her new clothes, so I said, &quot;Lets get a pair for each outfit.&quot; 
<br /><br />We went on to the jewelry department where she picked out a pair of diamond earrings. Let me tell you... she was so excited. She must have thought I was one wave short of a shipwreck. I started to think she was testing me because she asked for a tennis bracelet when she doesn't even know how to play tennis. 
<br /><br />I think I threw her for a loop when I said, &quot;That's fine, honey.&quot; She was almost nearing sexual satisfaction from all of the excitement. Smiling with excited anticipation, she finally said, &quot;I think this is all 
<br />dear, let's go to the cashier.&quot; 
<br /><br />I could hardly contain myself when I blurted out, &quot;No honey, I don't feel like it.&quot; 
<br /><br />Her face just went completely blank as her jaw dropped with a baffled, &quot;WHAT?&quot; 
<br /><br />I then said, &quot;Honey! I just want you to HOLD this stuff for a while. You're just not in touch with my financial needs as a man enough for me to satisfy your shopping needs as a woman.&quot; 
<br /><br />And just when she had this look like she was going to kill me, I added, &quot;Why can't you just love me for who I am and not for the things I buy you?&quot; 
<br /><br />Apparently I'm not having sex tonight either....but at least that bitch knows I'm smarter than her. 
<br /><br />Just repost this to get a laugh... we know someones going through this sought of a drought, hopefully it gets to them.

They weren't any particular thoughts , just ideas and feelings floating around in spirals. Phone numbers, prices of things he wanted to buy , favourite bands and..... her. Alex smiled, glad he had something of meaning to think about. In his mind he saw her smile and a small gasp escaped his lips and his heart throbbed with longing. He loved her, even if she didn't know it. He had the perfect way to tell her , a song , written purely out of his heart and intended for only her to hear. Alex picked up his guitar and strummed a few chords then pulled out a battered tape recorder and set it on the floor and began to play, singing and playing the song that he had written for her. Then a wave of sadness swept over him. He didn't know her name. But he was going to change that.
<br /><br />Alex rumbled along the road , sitting alone on the bus as usual watching the houses pass by and the road being swallowed by the buses tyres. She sat up the front talking to her friend, she looked sad and concerned about something. As Alex looked on , her heard their conversation drift towards him.
<br />&quot;Why are you moving ?&quot;
<br />&quot;Don't know, parents want to , they hate it here&quot;
<br />&quot;But why? I'm going to miss you so much&quot;
<br />&quot;Don't worry, we will keep in touch&quot;
<br />&quot;But won't you miss him? Alex?&quot;
<br />&quot;Yes I will , I just wish he would talk to me, I love him&quot;
<br /><br />All at the same time , Alex smiled and felt his heart burst, a mosaic, a dance of broken gleaming fragments. She loved him , but she was moving. Alex couldn't remember being more happy and sad at the same time. Alex knew what he had to do to make her see he loved her too.
<br /><br />That night , Alex took his guitar to her house and found her bedroom window and sat on the lawn and began to play. His voice soared and lights began to flick on in the house and voices coudl be heard. Then her window opened and she appeared, tears coursing silently down her cheeks. He finished his song and walked over to her, pulling her close for a kiss that was only brief, but would be locked away in his heart forever, she leant in and whispered in his ear something he would remember forever, even when he grew old. Then her father appeared and Alex took one last look vefore melting into the night.
<br /><br />Alex never saw her again. People at school said she moved away the day after he sang to her. Alex missed her but with each day that passed it grew a little easier. Alex eventually sold his guitar and gave up his song writing, he didn't need it anymore, he'd achieved what he wanted and was happy with it. Alex grew up and met someone else, they married, had 2 kids and eventually divorced. It wasn't the happiest of endings, nor was it the saddest. Because Alex was content with it all, because he had a memory of a girl whispering in his ear something he would never forget. 
<br /><br />A name.
<br /><br />Annie.
<br /><br />THE END &lt;3

		<document id="6d46688aff67c7ed681aaa4f7815ff7a" url=""><![CDATA[Blog # 6<br/><br/>Well friends and readers , it has been a long time indeed since i've written a rant of epic proportions, this isn't cos i haven't had anything to rant about , its just been school work , driving and such, so all the annoyance and anger i have had over the past few months has been brewing up , and i swear i will explode if i keep this in much longer......... haha had you going didn't I ? I'm just joking , life has been relatively good as of late but there is one particular annoyance that has been eating away for awhile now and im pretty sure almost anyone can relate to this, if they have their P's or are over 18 (believe me its relevant)
<br /><br />So anyways , on to the topic of having your P's, OMFG best feeling ever!!!!! lol , now i've been on my red P's for 6 months now and  I have a small statement to make ; I DON'T WANNA DIE YOU ASSHOLES!!!!!, i swear every time i go driving there is a a massive invisible sticker across my windscreen that says: &quot;Pull Out In Front Of Me, I Want To Die&quot; every where i go there is some idiot on their full licence pulling out in front of me or speeding past to try and avoid me  , its not like i go out every morning thinking &quot; hahahahaha lets give P platers an even worse name by mowing down some old lady on the street!!!!!!&quot; i'm just like everyone else , trying to get to whatever destination it is im intending to reach but no  , people seem intent on making this impossible by getting up behind me , honking their horn , doing whatever,  some of you might be thinking its probs cos your a bad driver, and maybe thats true, but hey as far as im concerned, i havent been booked , dont speed (much) and havent ever had an accident , so im doing alright , so if theres anyone else out there who knows what im talking bout , i have sympathy for you. Now on to being 18 !
<br /><br />I turned 18 just the other week now its a fucking awesome feeling but i now understand why my best mate hates it ,sure you can drink and all that other shit legally, but then i've now noticed how everyone who is under the age of 18 is suddenly like &quot; hey wow your so cool now your 18!!!&quot; *rummages in wallet* so wanna by me a six pack?&quot;  sure some of you dont have a problem with it , cos they are your friends and all that but if theres one thing i hate, its being used to achieve someone elses needs. Its not cool to know that the only reason people are talking to you is cos they want something to drink or smoke , not cool at all. Another hate of mine is when people get drunk the use of the &quot;c word&quot; gets used, its fucking disgusting and the person who invented it should be shot , like seriously what a gross name , anyways, im feeling sleepy and tired after all tha ranting but hey , if you liked it and want more , just leave a comment on this blog and ill get round to it at some point or another<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" />

But still, it has some of my own personal feelings in it. Enjoy , comment, rate, criticise!<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/biggrin.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />Sometimes i wonder if i moved too fast for you , 
<br />?sometimes i wonder if should have said i loved you 
<br />?the look in your eyes, is something i despise 
<br />?because you cant say it back
<br /><br />Im sorry that i rushed into this ,
<br /> ?im sorry  that you dont want it ?
<br />we are two completely different people? 
<br />and its all my fault isnt it?!
<br />?Because i went out on a limb 
<br />?to show you everything could be just fine?
<br />if you had just let me?
<br /><br />You dont see the light die behind my eyes?
<br />when i see the words of someone else saying what i want to 
<br />?and you can say them back just as easily to them , but not me
<br />?WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON?!?
<br />am i really that much of a fucking fool to you ??
<br />just someone to toy around with ??
<br />or do you do it , to satisfy your own needs?
<br />of ripping out the hearts of others?
<br />and placing them on your shelf?, 
<br />a private collection of your own?
<br />of the thing you love called grief?
<br /><br />When we lie in bed together?
<br />gazing at the ceiling , when i turn to hold you?
<br />theres no one there, just an empty space, 
<br />?the one that you used to occupy??
<br /><br />NO MORE, NO MORE!!!?
<br />I’m through with you , im thinking clear now
<br />?GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY LIFE?
<br />ill burn the photographs, you cry the tears
<br />?ill break the windows, just leave
<br />?theres no place for you here anymore??
<br /><br />Tomorrow is a new day , and your not part of it , 
<br />?so ill fix the clowns smile to my face
<br />?and get through it , come home and let it slip 
<br />?to show the true feelings underneath
<br />?the feelings from beneath will show
<br /><br />I WILL SUCK YOU ( THE POISON) OUT OF MY SKIN?
<br />I WILL PULL YOU (THE RAZOR) FROM MY WRIST?
<br />I WILL UNTIE YOU (THE NOOSE) FROM MY NECK
<br />?I WILL EXTRACT YOU ( THE BULLET) FROM MY TEMPLE?? ?
<br /><br />I WILL FORGET YOU (THE MEMORY) FOREVER!!!!!?
<br />OH!

<br /><br />Torn to pieces that’s how I feel 
<br />confused by fake and what is real 
<br />did you even think of what you’d done?
<br />bent and kneeling , screaming and alone?
<br /><br />Chorus:
<br />Ripped to pieces, slashed to shreds
<br />looking through the eyes that bled,
<br />a lipstick smile, a mascara tear
<br />trainwreck of hurt pileup of fear
<br />twisted and broken, 
<br />the remains of me
<br /><br />Bright eyes fading into nothing 
<br />clutching onto something 
<br />what was it that made you go ?
<br />leaving me drowning in a pool of sorrow
<br /><br />Trying to crawl out , leave everything behind
<br />pick up the pieces, keep going
<br />the contempt you have for me is showing
<br />walking to escape your curse
<br />just leave me alone , to die in this hearse
<br /><br />Chorus:
<br />Ripped to pieces, slashed to shreds 
<br />looking though the eyes that bled
<br />a lipstick smile, a mascara tear
<br />trainwreck of hurt , pileup of fear
<br />twisted and broken . 
<br />the remains of me 
<br /><br />Come to nothing , final chapter, last verse
<br />(just leave me to die)
<br />walking to escape your curse
<br />I’m much happier here alone , dead in this hearse.
<br /><br />Useless Necessities
<br /><br />No sense of direction
<br />a compass with no needle.
<br />going round in circles
<br />lost in the maze of life.
<br /><br />The forgotten breath 
<br />as your head plunges beneath the surface
<br />the crowds begin to close in around you
<br />cutting you off from the life you crave.
<br /><br />Chorus:
<br />Do you really want it? or do you need it?
<br />just another useless necessity
<br />you have what you need, but in selfish greed
<br />you waste it
<br />take the time to appreciate it
<br />cos one day it'll be gone....
<br /><br />That last drink 
<br />slaking your thirst
<br />always wanting more that’s your problem
<br />one day you wont have it
<br />and you will drown in your sorrows
<br /><br />Chorus
<br /><br />The last kiss, that sweet embrace
<br />building up before the fall
<br />all i did was care
<br />but you couldn't get enough of them
<br />so i'm left to shoulder the pain and survive.
<br /><br />(first 4 lines of chorus)
<br /><br />Take the time to appreciate me
<br />cos one day i'll be gone...........

<br /><br />-We don't care if you talk to other guys. 
<br /><br />-We don't care if you're friends with other guys. DO YOU?? 
<br /><br />-But when you're sitting next to us, and some random guy walks into the room and you jump up and tackle him, without even introducing us, yeah, it pisses us off. HAHA. 
<br /><br />-It doesn't help if you sit there and talk to him for ten minutes without even acknowledging the fact that we're still there. 
<br /><br />-We don't care if a guy calls you, but at 2 in the morning we do get a little concerned. 
<br /><br />-Nothing is that important at 2 a.m. that it can't wait 
<br />Till the morning. 
<br /><br />-Also, when we tell you you're pretty/ beautiful/ gorgeous/ 
<br />cute/stunning, we freaking mean it. 
<br /><br />-Don't tell us we're wrong. 
<br /><br />We'll stop trying to convince you. 
<br /><br />-The sexiest thing about a girl is confidence. 
<br />Yeah, you can quote me. 
<br /><br />-Don't be mad when we hold the door open. Take Advantage of the mood I'm in. 
<br /><br />-Let us pay for you! 
<br /><br />Don’t &quot;feel bad&quot; 
<br /><br />We enjoy doing it. 
<br /><br />It's expected. 
<br /><br />Smile and 
<br /><br />Say &quot;thank you.&quot; 
<br /><br />-Kiss us when no one's watching. 
<br /><br />-If you kiss us when you know somebody's looking, we'll be more impressed. 
<br /><br />-You don't have to get dressed up for us. 
<br /><br />-If we're going out with you in the first place, you don't have to feel the need to wear the shortest skirt you have or put on every kind of makeup you own. 
<br /><br />-We like you for who you are and not what you are. 
<br /><br />Honestly, I think a girl looks more beautiful when she's just in her pj's. Or my t-shirt and boxers, not all dolled up 
<br /><br />-Don't take everything we say seriously. 
<br /><br />Sarcasm is a beautiful thing. See the beauty in it. 
<br /><br />-Don't get angry easily. 
<br /><br />-Stop using magazines/media as your bible. 
<br /><br />-Don't talk about how hot Morris Chesnutt, Brad Pitt, or Pete Wentz is in front of us. 
<br /><br />It's boring, and we don't care. You have girlfriends for that. 
<br /><br />-Whatever happened to the word &quot;handsome&quot;/&quot;beautiful?&quot; 
<br /><br />I'd be utterly stunned by a girl who greeted me with &quot;Hey handsome!&quot; instead of &quot;Hey baby/ stud/ cutie/ sexy&quot; or whatever else you can think of. 
<br /><br />On the other hand I’m not saying I wouldn’t like it either ; ) 
<br /><br />-Girls, I cannot stress this enough: if you aren't being treated right by a guy, don’t wait for him to change. Ditch his sorry, disgrace to the male population ass and find someone who will treat you with utter respect
