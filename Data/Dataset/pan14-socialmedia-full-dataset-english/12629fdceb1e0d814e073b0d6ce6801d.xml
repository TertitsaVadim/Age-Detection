<br />it does mean you haven't succeeded yet
<br /><br />Failure doesn't mean you have accomplished nothing...
<br />it does mean you have learned something
<br /><br />Failure doesn't mean you have been a fool...
<br />it does mean you had a lot of faith 
<br /><br />Failure doesn't mean you have been disgraced...
<br />it does mean you were willing to try
<br /><br />Failure doesn't mean you don't have it...
<br />it does mean you have to do something in a different way
<br /><br />Failure doesn't mean you are inferior...
<br />it does mean you are not perfect
<br /><br />Failure doesn't mean you've wasted your life...
<br />it does mean you've got a reason to start afresh
<br /><br />Failure doesn't mean you should give up... 
<br />it does mean you should try harder
<br /><br />Failure doesn't mean you'll never make it...
<br />it does mean it will take a little longer

<br />And it always will be.
<br />For love still remains
<br />Life's sweet mystery!
<br /><br />Love works in ways
<br />That are wondrous and strange
<br />And there's nothing in life
<br />That love cannot change!
<br /><br />Love can transform
<br />The most commonplace
<br />Into beauty and splendor
<br />And sweetness and grace
<br /><br />Love is unselfish,
<br />Understanding and kind,
<br />For it sees with it's heart
<br />And not with it's mind!
<br /><br />Love is the answer
<br />That everyone seeks....
<br />Love is the language,
<br />That every heart speaks.
<br /><br />Love can't be bought,
<br />It is priceless and free,
<br />Love, like pure magic,
<br />Is life's sweet mystery!

<br />To understand her, you need to spend your life time
<br />To understand her, you need to talk with her 
<br />But Still, It will be difficult for you to understand her
<br /><br />The best part of the woman, is to love her
<br />Her love will make you cry
<br />It will make you sorrow,
<br />Even feeling the pain, inside your heat 
<br />You will never want to say good bye to her
<br /><br />Hold her hand and look at her face
<br />You can see the seven wonder in front of you
<br />Walk with a woman and watch her smile 
<br />And you can hear thousand tunes in your heart
<br /><br />Get caught in the trap of her eyes,
<br />Get breathe in the fragnance of her hair
<br />And get mad, if she looks back at you 
<br />Then you will know what a woman is all About
<br /><br />If you love her, never say &quot;I Love You&quot;
<br />Because she will hate you
<br />If you really want to show care 
<br />Never Say it in words, because
<br />True Words are not enough for them
<br /><br />Your feelings and emotions
<br />Your happiness and joy
<br />Your motivation and Attitude
<br />Will have meaning, if she is with you 
<br /><br />If we understand her truly and if we look at the world
<br />We will see the people with no heartbreaks, no sorrows 
<br />No Tears and no fightings because, you will
<br />Undersand that, a Womans is just a Miracle.

<br />&quot;There is no love for you,&quot; it said.
<br /><br />Heart couldn't understand what took place.
<br />The truth of love and great feelings
<br />were only a nice warmth, touching my face.

<br />From a deep and peaceful sleep
<br />My heart is racing wildly
<br />Like a million little feet.
<br /><br />The panic that I used to feel
<br />Has turned to something new
<br />A feeling of strength and power
<br />That I have somehow learned from you.
<br /><br />You have empowered me
<br />To take a look within
<br />And find the love of a friend
<br />Where fear had always been.
<br /><br />So, now I reach into the dark
<br />And feel the ray of light
<br />From the love a friend sends to me
<br />Shinning bright into the night.

<br />Celebrate the first day of winter with an ice kiss. Put an ice cube in your mouth until your mouth becomes cold. Remove the cube, track down your love and plant a kiss that will send chills! 
<br /><br />- 2 - ELECTRIC SHOCK KISS
<br />The two of you shuffle your feet furiously on carpet. When you both have an electric charge, lean over and slowly aim for each other's lips. With your lips about one-half inch apart, move in even slower until a spark jumps between the two of you. Instantly after this happens, kiss one another...the please us the kiss right after the shock! 
<br /><br />- 3 - CAMPING KISS
<br />On a beautiful cool night, you and your love crawl into a sleeping bag outside. Cuddle and kiss. 
<br /><br />- 4 - REWARD KISS
<br />Next time your love performs some disliked home chore like cleaning the bathroom, mowing the lawn, or taking out the garbage, show your appreciation by tucking a candy kiss in a strategic location. 
<br /><br />- 5 - POST-IT KISS
<br />Use 3M Post-It notes to make a trail through your house that leads to your lips. Put a lipstick print or lip symbol on each note with an arrow pointing to the next note. You, of course, are at the end of the trail with a Post-It note over your lips that says, &quot;LIFT FOR KISS&quot; 
<br /><br />- 6 - KISSING IN THE RAIN
<br />The next time it rains, grab an umbrella, rain coats, and your love. Then go outside and kiss in the rain. If the spirit of the kiss moves you, remove the umbrella and kiss 'till the two of you are soaked. 
<br /><br />- 7 - HERSHEY`S KISSES
<br />Prepare a small bag of Hershey`s kisses and slip it into your love's purse, briefcase, or lunchbox. Attach a note that reads &quot;SORRY, I CAN'T BE THERE IN PERSON, BUT THINK OF ME AND DO THE FOLLOWING: Close your eyes and place the candy between your lips. Drop the candy in your mouth and roll it on your tongue until it melts. 
<br /><br />- 8 - TRACY AND HEPBURN KISS
<br />Make flash cards, and the two of you re-enact the following kissing scene from WOMAN OF THE YEAR 
<br /><br />(1942): (Reclining face to face on a couch, woman on top.) SAM: Something I've got to get off my chest.
<br />TESS: I'm too heavy?
<br />SAM: I love you.
<br />TESS: Me, too.
<br />SAM: Positive.
<br />TESS: That's nice. Even when I'm sober?
<br />SAM: Even when you're brilliant. (The two of you kiss.) 
<br /><br />- 9 - KISSES IN A BALLOON
<br />Cut out small red tissue lips, and place them inside an opaque balloon filled with helium (any party store could do this for you) Tie the balloon to your love's chair at dinner. Desert is a shower of kisses delivered by a sharp pin. 
<br /><br />- 10 - TOLL KISS
<br />Next time you are driving your love somewhere, stop the car before crossing a bridge or going through a tunnel, and say the toll must be paid before you can go any further. Of course, the toll cost in one kiss. 
<br /><br />- 11 - MORSE CODE KISS
<br />If you know Morse code, great, If not, this is a great way to learn. Find a Morse Code chart. Using long and short kisses, spell out a message to your love and have him or her try to decipher them. 
<br /><br />- 12 - KISSING METER KISSES
<br />We have parking meters, so why not kissing meters? Turn a box into your own kissing meter and wear it around your neck. Give your love kissing tokens to start your kissing meter. Have an &quot;expired&quot; sign appear when you need another kiss. 
<br /><br />- 13 - AUDIO STIMULATION
<br />Make a cassette of kissing noises and place in your love's cassette player (walkman, car or home) with a note attached. 
<br /><br />- 14 - BREAKFAST IN BED KISS
<br />Slip out of bed early and prepare a special &quot;Kissing&quot; breakfast to serve to your love in bed. Pick foods that you can easily pick up and feed to your love. Kiss between bites!
<br /><br />- 15 - STAIRWELL KISS
<br />This kiss is to be done at a party or at a gathering with your love. Steal away to a private location like behind a door or tree, or on the stairwell and passionately kiss each other. The risk of being discovered in the act is the key element. 
<br /><br />- 16 - SCUBA KISSING
<br />Wearing a diving mask and fins, simulate swimming underwater. Snorkel across the room to your love and kiss him or her. 
<br /><br />- 17 - EYE TEST KISS
<br />Make an eye chart like the ones that you see in a doctor's office where the letters get progressively smaller. Have the chart read, &quot;IF you can read this you are standing close enough to kiss me.&quot; Now find your love and give an eye exam.

<br />Good for nothing when bought;
<br />an extraordinary boon,
<br />and a matter of course,

<br />Feel your warm lips pressing mine,
<br />But you're not with me anymore,
<br />All I have left now is time.
<br /><br />Life sure isn't what it once was,
<br />Now that I'm alone,
<br />I wonder who it is who loves you,
<br />Can she call you her very own?
<br /><br />Does she feel like I once did,
<br />When you held me close in your arms?
<br />Does she really appreciate,
<br />Your love and all of your charm?
<br /><br />And I sometimes wonder,
<br />If you ever miss me too?
<br />Or has my memory simply faded,
<br />Like lots of memories do?
<br /><br />There's an old ache in my heart,
<br />That time cannot erase,
<br />Each time I think of you,
<br />I feel the tears on my face.
