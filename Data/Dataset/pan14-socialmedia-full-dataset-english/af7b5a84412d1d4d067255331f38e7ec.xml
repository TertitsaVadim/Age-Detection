<br /><br />Although Lambert went into Tuesday's three song apiece finale as the apparent front runner and was all but anointed the winner by judge Simon Cowell, the race appeared to be neck and neck.
<br /><br />Web site DialIdol.com, which tracks &quot;Idol&quot; voting trends by measuring the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy40dW5qLmNvbS8_" target="_blank">Pittsburgh_Steelers_jerseys</a> number of calls to voting lines that result in busy signals, said the result was too close to call.
<br /><br />The Web site has accurately predicted the winners of &quot;American Idol&quot; in past seasons.
<br /><br />The results will be announced at the end of a two-hour finale ton Wednesday that will include performances by Carlos Santana, Cindy Lauper, Queen Latifah, Lionel Richie, Black Eyed Peas, and some surprise guests.
<br /><br />Lambert, 27, a showy Californian who wowed audiences throughout the season <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5lbmpveWpkLmNvbQ__" target="_blank">Air_jordan_XX</a> . with his off-the-charts vocal range, was widely considered the favorite for the title and a recording contract heading into Tuesday's finale.
<br /><br />Cowell told him at the end of Tuesday's show. &quot;The whole idea about doing a show like this is that you hope you can find a worldwide star -- I genuinely believe with all my heart that we have found that with you.&quot;
<br /><br />Cowell was less effusive with Allen, 23, saying that the low key Arkansan student had earned his spot in the finale and that his parents should be very proud of him.
<br /><br />His comments followed the performance by both contestants of an original song <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5qb3JkYW4ydS5jb20_" target="_blank">Air_jordan_20_shoes</a> . co-written by new judge Kara DioGuardi that will become the winner's first single.
<br /><br />The song, called &quot;No Boundaries,&quot; was clearly in too high a key for Allen's vocal range. Cowell also poked fun at the &quot;mountains and hurricanes&quot; in the song's lyrics.
<br /><br />&quot;American Idol&quot; began as a cheesy summer talent show in 2002 but quickly morphed into a cultural phenomenon that attracts tens of millions of viewers a week to News Corp's Fox network. Ratings have sagged about 7 percent this season, but it remains the nation's top-rated TV show with some 26 million viewers.
<br /><br />&quot;Idol&quot; has generated a long list of stars from its winners and losers, including <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uaWtlLXN0YXItc2hvZXMuY29t" target="_blank">Nike_Air_Foamposite</a> .singers Kelly Clarkson, Carrie Underwood and Chris Daughtry and Oscar winner Jennifer Hudson.

		<document id="ebcd8bba6aa1ea0a37584e33dc106475" url=""><![CDATA[Back in Finals, Lakers Look to Finish the Job<br/><br/>A modest celebration swept across the Pepsi Center floor and down the corridor leading to the visitors’ locker room late 
<br /><br />Friday night. The Los Angeles Lakers had just been crowned Western Conference champions, and had the T-shirts, hats and a 
<br /><br />trophy to prove it.
<br /><br />But the celebration was subdued, and it ended at<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy41MmpvcmRhbi5jb20_" target="_blank">Air_jordan_V_sneaker.</a>  
<br /><br />the locker-room door. Inside, only one player still wore the commemorative T-shirt. Nearly everyone wore 
<br /><br />painfully serious expressions.
<br /><br />“There’s no satisfaction in this locker room at all,” the veteran Derek Fisher said.
<br /><br />For a franchise steeped in championships, the minor trophies, however shiny, rarely provide much comfort.
<br /><br />It has been seven years since the Lakers last embraced the  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uaWtlLXN0YXItc2hvZXMuY29t" target="_blank">Max_Tempo_2_Duke_Blue_Devils</a> . Larry O’Brien Trophy, and 347 days since they 
<br /><br />were crushed by the Boston Celtics in the 2008 finals. That series ended in a humiliating Game 6 rout, and criticism rained 
<br /><br />like confetti on their shoulders. The Lakers left TD Banknorth Garden soaked in frustration and anger. The feelings never 
<br /><br />waned.
<br /><br />“We started training camp Sept. 30, we were still frustrated, still angry,” Fisher said.
<br /><br />Redemption is now in reach, after a sometimes-difficult six-game Western Conference finals against the Denver Nuggets. The 
<br /><br />Lakers appear more capable than ever of claiming the franchise’s 15th title.
<br /><br />They won the last two games of the series in impressive fashion, using an efficient, well-balanced offense and some 
<br /><br />relentless defense. Their 119-92 series-clinching victory Friday was as complete a game as they have played in the 
<br /><br />postseason.
<br /><br />The final step is typically the toughest, but the Lakers feel better prepared for it. They were pushed to the limit by the 
<br /><br />Houston Rockets in a seven-game semifinal series. They absorbed every blow that the physical Nuggets threw at them. Last 
<br /><br />year, they breezed through the Western Conference playoffs with a 12-3  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5lbmpveWpkLmNvbQ__" target="_blank">Air_jordan_XXIII</a> .record. But the Lakers insist the harder path is the 
<br /><br />better one. 
<br /><br />“Much, much tougher,” Kobe Bryant said. “Mentally challenging for us. But we gained valuable experience, went through a 
<br /><br />roller coaster of emotions.”
<br /><br />Trevor Ariza offered a startling admission, saying, “We were happy just to be there last year.” They return to the finals 
<br /><br />more seasoned. “This year we know what to expect, we know what we have to do,” he said.
<br /><br />Whether they face Orlando or Cleveland, the Lakers will present a different look from what they had last June.
<br /><br />Andrew Bynum, their sturdy young center, is healthy now, after missing  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jb21ldG9hai5jb20_" target="_blank">jordan_basketballhoes_6_ring</a> the 2008 postseason 
<br /><br />after knee surgery. A broken foot left Ariza limited last spring. He has since blossomed into a top-notch defender and 3-
<br /><br />point shooter, and is starting at small forward.
<br /><br />“It feels great to be able to be back and actually being able to be an active participant,” said Bynum, the lone Laker who 
<br /><br />was — understandably — still wearing his white Western Conference champions T-shirt in the locker room Friday night. 
<br /><br />The Lakers were accused of lacking toughness against the Celtics. Bynum and Ariza provide an extra layer of it.
<br /><br />“Andrew, even though people at times question him, he’s continued to make sacrifices physically that at times other guys 
<br /><br />aren’t,” Fisher said. “He’s taken some good, hard, quality fouls that,<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy40dW5qLmNvbQ__" target="_blank">New_York_Jets_jerseys</a> . to be honest, put him into foul trouble and 
<br /><br />force him to go sit on the bench. But he’s not giving up easy baskets in there.”
<br /><br />The Lakers will continue to rise and fall with Bryant, one of the N.B.A.’s most lethal and complete offensive players, who 
<br /><br />is averaging 29.6 points, 5.3 rebounds and 4.9 assists in the playoffs. Their downfall last June was widely regarded as a 
<br /><br />failure of his supporting cast, notably Pau Gasol and Lamar Odom.
<br /><br />But both came through in the final two games of the conference finals, providing some reassurance. Gasol and Odom combined 
<br /><br />for 33 points, 24 rebounds and 9 blocks in Game 5, then came back with 40 points and 20 rebounds in Game 6.
<br /><br />“I think we learned a lesson, and we’re going to keep it this way,” Gasol said.
<br /><br />The Nuggets were left with impossible decisions on whom to double-team, and were left “a little out of balance” (Gasol’s 
<br /><br />words) as Bryant, Odom and Gasol took turns carving up the Nuggets with <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy40dWFmLmNvbQ__" target="_blank">Nike_Men_Air_Force_1_High</a> . their passing.
<br /><br />The Nuggets had played the Lakers to a 2-2 draw in the series before Odom and Gasol clicked into place.
<br /><br />“I saw little cracks in the Lakers,” Nuggets Coach George Karl said, “and somehow we’ve cemented those cracks back up. 
<br /><br />And I think they’re the best team right now in the N.B.A.”
<br /><br />By wrapping up the conference finals Friday, the Lakers earned a six-day break before the finals begin. Odom, who has a large 
<br /><br />contusion on his lower back, stands to benefit the most. Bryant, who played more than 86 minutes in the last two games and 
<br /><br />acknowledged having some fatigue, could use the rest.
<br /><br />When he was not filling up the box score Friday, Bryant was thumping <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy41MmpvcmRhbi5jb20_" target="_blank">Air_jordan_VI_sneaker</a> . teammates on the chest, grabbing them by 
<br /><br />the ears and generally exhorting them to give everything they had to close out the series. The only one shouting louder and 
<br /><br />more often was Fisher.
<br /><br />The decade began with Lakers dominance — three championships from 2000 to 2002. Bryant and Fisher are the only holdovers, 
<br /><br />and they carry both the pride and the burden of trying to rekindle the greatness. They have been back to the finals twice, 
<br /><br />only to be smacked down by Detroit in 2004 and Boston in 2008.
<br /><br />Bryant is still seeking his first title without Shaquille O’Neal. Coach Phil Jackson is still seeking the 10th ring that 
<br /><br />will push him past Red Auerbach for the most in league history.
<br /><br />Fisher, his stern look never softening, said he had to impress upon the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jb21ldG9hai5jb20_" target="_blank">jordan_basketball_shoes_10.5</a> .younger Lakers just how 
<br /><br />precious their opportunity is.
<br /><br />“What we’ve been through since 2004, and then to get back there last year and not get it done again, I don’t know if guys 
<br /><br />fully understand the frustration or the pain that comes with that, when you’re not sure if it’s ever going to happen again,
<br /><br />” he said. “I think all of our guys are excited about it, though, to have a chance to kind of right what we felt was wrong.
<br /><br />”

<br /><br />Wednesday, a move to beef up Atlanta's offense in hopes of contending in the NL East.
<br /><br />The 27-year-old McLouth was an All-Star last season and set career highs with a .276 average, 26 homers and 94 RBIs. The 
<br /><br />Braves desperately needed more offense from an outfield that <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy40dW5qLmNvbS8_" target="_blank">New_York_Giants_jerseys</a> .produced only 10 homers through the first 51 games.
<br /><br />Atlanta gave up outfielder Gorkys Hernandez, one of their top prospects, along with pitchers Charlie Morton and Jeff Locke.
<br /><br />McLouth, who is hitting .256 with nine homers and 34 RBIs this season, fills several needs for the Braves. In addition to 
<br /><br />bolstering the lineup, he won a Gold Glove in 2008 and had 23 stolen bases. Since the start of the '05 season, he has the 
<br /><br />best stolen base percentage (64 of 69) among all major <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5haXItc2hveC5jb20v" target="_blank">Shox_Go</a> .leaguers.
<br /><br />Another plus: McLouth is under contract through at least 2011, having signed a three-year, $15.75 contract in spring 
<br /><br />training. The deal includes a team option for a fourth year at $10.65 million, with a buyout of $1.25 million.
<br /><br />&quot;He gives us everything we're looking for,&quot; general manager Frank Wren said. &quot;He gives us an extra outfield bat. He gives us 
<br /><br />speed. He gives us defense. He brings a lot to the table.&quot;
<br /><br />It was a day of big moves for Atlanta. The trade was announced <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jb21ldG9hai5jb20v" target="_blank">jordan_basketball_shoes_2.5</a> .less than an hour after the 
<br /><br />Braves released 305-game winner Tom Glavine, saying they didn't feel the 43-year-old had shown during three minor league 
<br /><br />rehab assignments that he could still be effective in the big leagues.
<br /><br />Instead, the team called up highly touted prospect Tommy Hanson, who has dominated at Triple-A Gwinnett and will make his 
<br /><br />first major league appearance on Saturday against the Milwaukee Brewers.
<br /><br />&quot;We didn't want the season to get too far gone before we made some moves,&quot; Wren said. &quot;We thought some aggressive moves would 
<br /><br />put our club in good position.&quot;
<br /><br />The Braves went into Wednesday's contest against the Chicago <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5lbmpveWpkLmNvbS8_" target="_blank">Air_jordan_3.5.</a> 
<br />  Cubs trailing the East-leading Philadelphia Phillies by 4½ games. Atlanta hasn't made the playoffs since 2005, the 
<br /><br />last of their record 14 straight division titles.
<br /><br />By trading McLouth, Pittsburgh cleared a spot for one of its best prospects, former first-round pick Andrew McCutchen. He was 
<br /><br />called up from Triple-A Indianapolis, where he was hitting .303 with four homers, 20 RBIs and 10 stolen bases.
<br /><br />Pirates general manager Neal Huntington said trading <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5lbmpveWpkLmNvbS8_" target="_blank">Air_jordan_VI_ring.</a> 
<br /> McLouth &quot;may be the toughest decision we have made in my time with the organization.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;Nate is a quality player and person,&quot; Huntington said. &quot;But as we have said several times, tough decisions will need to be 
<br /><br />made as we build and sustain a championship-caliber organization. Nate has worked as hard as any player to become a starting 
<br /><br />major league player, proving wrong anyone who may have doubted him.

<br /><br />Branyan hit his 13th home run of the season, a towering blast that cleared the fence in straightaway center field, Lopez  slugged his sixth home run of the season  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uYmFqcy5jb20v" target="_blank">Orlando_Magic.htmlto</a> start  the fifth inning, and four batters later, Burke KO'd Twins starter Kevin Slowey with a solo shot to left field. 
<br /><br />It was Burke's first home run of the season, which includes 16 at-bats with the Mariners and 34 with Triple-A Tacoma. He now  has three homers in 355 MLB at-bats. 
<br /><br />Seattle had a chance to pad its first two-run lead, loading the bases with two outs in the fourth inning. Ichiro Suzuki  walked, Branyan singled and Adrian <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy51Z2cydS5uZXQv" target="_blank">UGG_Sandra</a> .Beltre was hit by a pitch,  setting up a crowd-pleasing at-bat for Ken Griffey Jr. 
<br /><br />His 16th career grand slam would have produced a 6-0 lead. But he grounded out to second. 
<br /><br />The Twins took advantage, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5haXJqb3JkYW5hYS5jb20_" target="_blank">jordan_3.5_sneaker</a> .scoring two runs  off left-hander Erik Bedard in the fifth despite having one hit, to tie the game at 2. Bedard walked Denard Span leading off  and surrendered a double to Joe Mauer. An infield out from the bat of Justin Morneau scored <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy41MmpvcmRhbi5jb20v" target="_blank">Air_jordan_IX_sneaker</a> . one run and sacrifice fly by Joe Crede  the other. 
<br /><br />But the home runs by Lopez and Burke in the bottom of the inning put the Mariners ahead to stay and presented Bedard with his  first career victory against the Twins. He had been 0-5.

<br /><br />relatively strong. But a new study, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5haXJqb3JkYW5hYS5jb20v" target="_blank">jordan_10.5_sneaker</a> .released on Friday, shows that fiscal malaise has finally – and fully – struck the digital sphere.
<br /><br />According to the Interactive Advertising Bureau and PricewaterhouseCoopers, online ad revenue in the US market sank to $5.5 
<br /><br />billion in the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5teWFqLXNob2VzLmNvbS8_" target="_blank">Nike_jordan_shoes_2009</a> .first quarter of 
<br /><br />2009, down 5 percent from $6.1 billion in the fourth quarter of last year. It is the first major slump of its kind since the 
<br /><br />burst of the dot-com bubble in 2002. (Revenue levels dipped – although not this drastically – in 2008.)
<br /><br />The news could be especially troubling for magazines and newspapers, which have increasingly turned to the web to make up for 
<br /><br />the loss of print ad  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5haXItc2hveC5jb20_" target="_blank">nike air shox</a>   Over the past few months, many outlets have 
<br /><br />shuttered or cut back on their print operations. In February, The Rocky <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy40dWFmLmNvbQ__" target="_blank">nike air force</a> Mountain News, the oldest newspaper in Colorado, ceased printing, and in March, the Seattle Post-Intelligencer shut 
<br /><br />its presses.
<br /><br />Remaining papers, such  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy51Z2cydS5uZXQ_" target="_blank">ugg boots</a> as the Boston Globe, have struggled to deal with declining 
<br /><br />print ad revenue – much of it lost to Craigslist, and other classified sites – while shifting to a web-centric marketing 
<br /><br />strategy. (In April, the Christian Science Monitor began publishing its daily edition online only.)
<br /><br />An uptick on the  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy40dW5qLmNvbQ__" target="_blank">NFL Jerseys</a> horizon? 
<br /><br />Despite the gloomy numbers, Randall Rothenberg, IAB’s CEO, said there was some cause for hope. “We’re confident that 
<br /><br />growth will resume as the U.S. economic climate improves,” Rothenberg said. “Interactive advertising is the most 
<br /><br />accountable way to reach  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jb21ldG9hai5jb20_" target="_blank">Jordan basketball shoes</a> consumers – and in this economy, 
<br /><br />digital media will be a core component of any successful marketing campaign.”
<br /><br />David Silverman, a partner  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5lbmpveWpkLmNvbQ__" target="_blank">Air jordan</a> at PricewaterhouseCoopers, concurred. “Current 
<br /><br />economic conditions are clearly challenging,” he told the BBC today. “Nonetheless, interactive media continues to consume a 
<br /><br />larger piece of the overall advertising pie.”

<br /><br />The right-hander, who Pittsburgh acquired a week ago as part of a four-player trade that sent Nate McLouth to the Braves, 
<br /><br />informed the Pirates that he felt some tightness in the hamstring before the start. He still took the mound in the first --

<br /><br />Morton was replaced by Jeff Karstens, who was initially scheduled to pitch on Wednesday before the Pirates handed that fifth

<br /><br />Tuesday's Cubs-White Sox game was rained out at Wrigley Field with no makeup date set, although the teams only have games 
<br /><br />here the next two days and are not expected to play a doubleheader then. 
<br /><br />The game could be made up in September. Both teams have open dates on Sept. 3 and Sept. 10, with the first being the more 
<br /><br />likely option.
<br /><br />It was the first rainout ever for the intra-city interleague games since they started counting in the standings in 1997. Two 
<br /><br />games have been shortened by rain.
<br /><br />The White Sox announced that Tuesday's starter John Danks would now start Wednesday afternoon and be followed by Gavin Floyd 
<br /><br />on Thursday.  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy40dWFmLmNvbQ__" target="_blank">Nike AIR Force</a>  That leaves Jose Contreras out of the mix for the Cubs.
<br /><br />The Cubs will throw Ryan Dempster on Wednesday night and Carlos Zambrano Thursday, meaning he will have an extra day of rest.

<br /><br />company's online file-sharing service. 
<br /><br />The new capabilities are available on iPhones that have been upgraded to the latest 3.0 software. The platform was released 
<br /><br />this month, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uZXctYWouY29tLw__" target="_blank">Jordan_XXI_shoes.</a>  along with the introduction of the new 
<br /><br />iPhone 3G S, at Apple's World Wide Developers Conference. The latest smartphone is set for release June 19. 
<br />The new Find My IPhone feature for MobileMe subscribers makes it possible for them to find a lost phone on a map and to send 
<br /><br />a message or alert to the device that will play even if the smartphone is in silent mode. If the device can't be recovered 
<br /><br />because its been stolen or for some other reason, then the owner can use MobileMe to remotely wipe out all the data. The 
<br /><br />deletion can <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5raXNzYWouY29tLw__" target="_blank">Nike_air_jordan_19.</a>  be undone if the owner later 
<br /><br />recovers the device. 
<br /><br />In launching the new capabilities, Apple warned that high traffic may make the services temporarily unavailable. Indeed, the 
<br /><br />Find My iPhone and Remote Wipe page on MobileMe were intermittently down on Wednesday, Apple enthusiast site AppleInsider 
<br /><br />reported<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5nb2dvYWouY29tLw__" target="_blank">. Nike_air_jordan_17_shoes.</a> 
<br /><br />People looking to test the services sometimes received the service: &quot;MobileMe Account is currently unavailable. We apologize 
<br /><br />for this service interruption and are working hard to resolve the problem,&quot; AppleInsider said. The delay appeared to have 
<br /><br />cleared up by <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5kdW5rMnUuY29tLw__" target="_blank">Nike_Men_Dunk_High.</a>  midday. 
<br /><br />While not exclusively an enterprise feature, Remote Wipe will certainly be welcomed by businesspeople who use their iPhone on 
<br /><br />the job. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jaGVhcC1haXItam9yZGFuLmNuLw__" target="_blank">air_jordan_17.</a>  In general, mobile security experts 
<br /><br />say the 3.0 software is a significant improvement for the platform, but it still lacks features available in handsets more 
<br /><br />geared toward business.

<br />The MBA said $84 billion of the drop is the result of fewer home purchases and the rest is due to fewer refinancings.
<br /><br />The MBA now expects existing home sales in 2009 will be 4.8 million units, a drop of 1.2 percent from 2008, and new home

In the BlueTool initialization script in the iPhone 3.0 firmware there are mentions of a new iPod Touch called &quot;iPod3,1.&quot; Given that the current generation is referred to as &quot;iPod2,1,&quot; this indicates Apple has a new version in the works. 
<br /><br />It's too soon to say what the new iPod Touch will look like or feature, but rumors point to a camera that takes video as being a <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy40dWFqLmNvbS8_" target="_blank">Nike_jordan_19.</a> likely edition. Other rumors indicate a larger screen, new wireless features, a digital compass, and GPS. 
<br /><br />While fans would love to see more iPhone-like functionality in the new device Apple has to make sure it doesn't give too much away: make the iPod too much like the iPhone then it takes away much of the reason to buy an iPhone. 
<br /><br />Apple's <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5haXItc2hveC5jb20v" target="_blank">Shox_Disobey</a> .last upgrade to the Touch line came last September, thus it would seem reasonable to assume that the next one would be this coming September. Being that it's an Apple product you can be sure more info will slowly come out in the months to come.

<br /><br />In recent years, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uYmFqcy5jb20_" target="_blank">NBA Jerseys</a> his prodigious talent had been overshadowed by a personal life 
<br /><br />fraught with court cases, financial distress and -- it must be said -- an element of the absurd as the reclusive singer 
<br /><br />withdrew further into a world in which his three children wore veils in public and the man himself was rarely seen. All that 
<br /><br />seemed on the verge of changing as Jackson prepped to kick off a series of concerts in London on July 13 -- his first in 
<br /><br />several years. 
<br /><br />His very rise to    <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5vbG9sYWouY29tLw__" target="_blank">Nike Air Jodan</a> stardom -- from chart dominance to glitter-covered glove 
<br /><br />to Bubbles the chimp to Blanket the baby -- defined the dual nature of celebrity and its ability to both venerate and 
<br /><br />eviscerate.
<br /><br />But many of us have indelible good memories of Jackson that predate the court cases, the surgery, the baffling behavior. For 
<br /><br />me, he conjures images of junior high school dances punctuated with gawky moonwalks, the anticipation of waiting for his 13-
<br /><br />minute long &quot;Thriller&quot; video to finally premiere on MTV in 1983 and always, always as the bright-eyed smiling kid who had the 
<br /><br />charisma to lead his  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5qb3JkYW5zcG9ydDIuY29tLw__" target="_blank">Jordan_V_sneaker</a> . brothers up the charts as 
<br /><br />the frontman of the Jackson 5.
<br /><br />Share your memories of Michael Jackson here and what, if anything, you plan to do to mark his passing. Does one of Jackson's 
<br /><br />songs resonate for you or perfectly crystallize a moment of your life? I'll be checking back throughout the evening to 
<br /><br />moderate.

<br /><br />weeks ago as crude oil prices hovered at about $70 per barrel, according to an industry analyst.
<br /><br />The national average for self-serve, regular unleaded gas was nearly $2.6613 a gallon on June 26, while two weeks ago it cost 
<br /><br />$2.6607, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy4ydWFqLmNvbS8_" target="_blank">Air_Jordan_melo_1.5.</a>  according to the nationwide Lundberg 
<br /><br />survey of gas stations.
<br /><br />The stability was mostly a function of oil price inertia, according to survey editor Trilby Lundberg. The price of crude oil 
<br /><br />per barrel hovered in a narrow range of about $69 to $71 in the past two weeks, Lundberg said in an interview on Sunday.
<br /><br />&quot;It comes down to crude as usual,&quot; Lundberg said. &quot;There is not going to be a demand surge any time soon because of poor 
<br /><br />economic conditions <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5teWFqLXNob2VzLmNvbS8_" target="_blank">Nike_jordan_shoes_6_ring.</a> 
<br />The average price for gasoline was well below the June 20, 2008, price of about $4.097 per gallon, but Lundberg noted that 
<br /><br />lower prices would not be enough to send people to the pumps as unemployment numbers stay high.
<br /><br />&quot;That price discount of a $1.44 is large but so is the number of motorists who are barely motoring at all,&quot; Lundberg said. 
<br /><br />&quot;The upcoming July Fourth holiday (is) hardly a point at all,&quot; she said, noting that most people commonly use gasoline to 
<br /><br />drive to work and back .<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uaWtlLXN0YXItc2hvZXMuY29tLw__" target="_blank">Dennis_Rodman</a> .  
<br /><br />&quot;Only a reversal in employment levels would revitalize gasoline demand,&quot; Lundberg said.
<br /><br />At $2.40 per gallon, Wichita, Kansas, had the lowest average price for self-serve, regular unleaded gas, while San Francisco 
<br /><br />had the highest price at $3.02 per gallon.

<br />The Associated Press 
<br />Monday, June 29, 2009; 8:24 PM 
<br /><br />LOS ANGELES -- A judge has granted Katherine Jackson limited control over some property in her son Michael Jackson's estate 
<br /><br />after she expressed concerns about the control of his business deals and bank accounts.

<br /><br />It does not detail the nature of those items and does not provide control of any money in the estate. 
<br /><br />The request by Katherine Jackson says she wants to take possession of thousands of items removed from Neverland Ranch that

<br /><br />A hearing on the request is set for July 6.

<br />For many U.S. homeowners, crisis hasn't meant urgency. Just as potential buyers have waited, many would-be sellers facing paper losses have not been forced to act. The standoff shouldn't be confused with stability.
<br /><br />The housing freefall slowed in April. Prices dropped 18.1% year on year, according to S&amp;P/Case-Shiller's index of 20 cities. They were lower in every city, but economists were encouraged by slightly more modest declines compared with March -- a possible  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy41MmpvcmRhbi5jb20v" target="_blank">Air jordan 10.5 sneaker</a> sign the market is near a bottom.
<br /><br />In some overbuilt cities, foreclosures have helped clear inventory while rapidly bringing prices back to reality. Phoenix and Las Vegas, for instance, have seen prices fall back nearly to 2000 levels. 
<br /><br />But markets like Boston and New York, where prices rose during the boom, albeit not as drastically as the Sun Belt, have slid much slower. Prices in Boston are still 48% above 2000 levels and New York's prices are 71% higher. Valuations in both cities are only   <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5vbG9sYWouY29tLw__" target="_blank">Nike air jordan melo 1.5</a>   about 20% off their peaks.
<br /><br />Would-be sellers in the Northeast appear to be taking their time. There, the inventory of homes for sale has increased just 17% since the end of 2005, before the market bubble burst, according to the Census Bureau. In the West, meanwhile, inventories have risen 74% over the same time period.
<br /><br />Transaction volumes tell a similar story. The National Association of Realtors says existing home sales in the Northeast fell 10% year   <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5kdW5rMnUuY29tLw__" target="_blank">Nike Men Dunk Mid</a> on year in April, while they increased 17% in the West.
<br /><br />Home prices in the less overbuilt Northeast are unlikely to correct as sharply as in some other markets. But further pain has likely been delayed, not avoided.

<br />In a blog post on Wednesday, chief privacy officer Chris Kelly said Facebook is in the process of simplifying and 
<br /><br />standardizing its privacy settings. 
<br /><br />For Facebook users ,   <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy41MmpvcmRhbi5jb20v" target="_blank">Air jordan XVII sneaker</a>    this means 
<br /><br />revisiting previous privacy choices. Over the next few weeks, Facebook plans to make a Transition Tool available that will 
<br /><br />ask users to specify their desired level of information sharing. Previous privacy choices will carry over to the new privacy 
<br /><br />settings. Whether users will migrate toward more or less openness remains to be seen. 
<br />&quot;We think Facebook is most useful when people can find and connect with each other, which is why this tool will enable you to 
<br /><br />make available those parts of your profile that you feel comfortable sharing in order to facilitate better connection,&quot; said 
<br /><br />Kelly .   <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5vbG9sYWouY29tLw__" target="_blank">Nike air jordan XVIII</a>  &quot;You will have the choice of being 
<br /><br />as open or as limited in the sharing of this information as you want.&quot; 
<br /><br />Facebook, however, seems to be encouraging its users to be less protective about their information, because private 
<br /><br />information can't be monetized. In March, it added an &quot;Everyone&quot; option -- an option not previously available -- to encourage 
<br /><br />broad information sharing. 
<br /><br />During a media conference call about the changes, Facebook VP of communications and public policy Elliot Schrage responded to 
<br /><br />the suggestion that Facebook appeared to be encouraging information sharing by saying that the company was trying to manage 
<br /><br />the tension    <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5kdW5rMnUuY29tLw__" target="_blank">Nike Men Dunk Low</a>    between privacy and openness. 
<br /><br />Facebook hasn't managed that tension very well in recent years as efforts to monetize the free service have led to privacy 
<br /><br />oversights. Its Beacon social advertising scheme, for example, created considerable controversy in 2007 for violating user 
<br /><br />privacy. The uproar eventually prompted an apology from CEO Mark Zuckerberg and a shift to an opt-in system. 
<br /><br />But lately, Facebook seems to be stepping through the privacy minefield with more self-assurance.

<br /><br />The blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average rose 44.13 points, or 0.5 percent, to 8324.87, while the broader Standard &amp; Poor's 
<br /><br />500-stock index gained 2.3, or 0.2 percent, to 898.72. But tech stocks dragged the Nasdaq down 9.12 points, 0 0.5 percent, to 
<br /><br />1,787.40. The major indexes have fallen for the past three weeks, the longest streak of declines since the markets bottomed 
<br /><br />out in March.   <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy4ydWFqLmNvbS8_" target="_blank">Air Jordan 22</a> 
<br />A report released this morning by the Institute for Supply Management showed that the non-manufacturing sector contracted for 
<br /><br />the ninth consecutive month in June, albeit at a slower rate. The trade group's index of activity in service industries was 
<br /><br />at 47 in June, 3 points higher than in May. Any reading above 50 indicates growth; any reading below 50 indicates 
<br /><br />contraction. Six sectors reported growth, while 11 contracted in June, according to the organization. 
<br /><br />The report was the latest indication that the nation's economic recovery remains ephemeral, even if the worst may be over. 
<br /><br />Last week,    <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5kdW5rMnUuY29tLw__" target="_blank">Nike Men Dunk Low</a>   investors balked at weaker-than-
<br /><br />expected labor reports showing the number of jobs on employers' payrolls fell by 467,000 in June while the unemployment rate 
<br /><br />rose to 9.5 percent, sending stock markets into a tailspin. 
<br /><br />Oil prices have risen sharply in recent months, though they moderated before the holiday weekend. Light, sweet crude for 
<br /><br />August delivery slipped to a five-week low today, settling at $64.34 on the New York Mercantile Exchange, down $2.39, or 
<br /><br />about 4 percent. 
<br /><br />Stocks were also down overseas. London's FTSE 100 dropped 1 percent, or 41 points, to 4195. In Asia, Japan's Nikkei 225 
<br /><br />declined 1.4 percent, or 135 points, to 9681, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng index dipped 1.2 percent, or 224 points, to 17,979.

<br /><br />mystery, reports CBS News correspondent Ben Tracy. 
<br /><br />The casket was on display at the memorial service Tuesday, but the Jackson family is now closely guarding its location and 
<br /><br />does not yet want the public to know when or where Michael Jackson will be laid to rest, opening the possibility that it 
<br /><br />could still be    <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5hajJ1LmNvbS8_" target="_blank">Air Jordan 11</a>  at Neverland, the singer's famed ranch. 
<br /><br />Meanwhile, the coroner's office is running tests on portions of his brain, hoping to determine whether he had any underlying 
<br /><br />condition, such as a tumor, that contributed to his death. 
<br /><br />&quot;This is being done to rule out disease and ultimately the toxicology report will tell us definitively as to why Mr. Jackson 
<br /><br />died,&quot; said Dr. Lawrence Kobilinsky, with the John Jay College of Criminal Justice. 
<br /><br />The death certificate lists the cause of death as &quot;deferred.&quot; The toxicology report may show whether prescription painkillers 
<br /><br />played any role in Jackson's death. But experts say Diprivan, a powerful anesthesia drug, allegedly used as a sleep aid by 
<br /><br />the singer ,  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy41MmpvcmRhbi5jb20v" target="_blank">Air jordan XVI</a>  sneaker  is often hard to detect 
<br /><br />on routine toxicology tests. 
<br /><br />&quot;You have to send urine and potentially blood and potentially hair to very specialized laboratories,&quot; said Dr. Paul 
<br /><br />Wischmeyer, a Diprivan expert. 
<br /><br />The shrine to Jackson at his parents' home was dismantled today. Also Wednesday, the Web site TMZ.com, which first broke the 
<br /><br />news of Jackson's death, reports that the Jackson family gave investigators a list of doctors who may have been 
<br /><br />overprescribing medication for Michael Jackson. It reportedly includes Dr. Arnold Klein, Jackson's longtime dermatologist. On 
<br /><br />&quot;Good Morning    <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5vbG9sYWouY29tLw__" target="_blank">Nike air jordan XVI</a> America,&quot; he said he is not one 
<br /><br />of the five doctors thought to be targeted by the investigation. 
<br /><br />&quot;I was not one of the doctors who participated in giving him overdoses of drugs or too much of anything,&quot; Klein said. &quot;In 
<br /><br />fact, I was the one who limited everything, who stopped everything.&quot; 
<br /><br />Meanwhile, a custody hearing for Jackson's three children will take place on Monday. It is not clear whether Debbie Rowe, 
<br /><br />Jackson's ex-wife, will fight Jackson's mother Catherine for custody.
