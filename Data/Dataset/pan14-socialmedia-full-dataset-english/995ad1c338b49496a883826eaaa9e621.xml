MMA is all about competition and that is what keep the school's name known.<br /><br />After you have weed insignificant gyms, the next thing that you need to do is choosing what discipline or technique you want to learn. As most fans would know, there are several disciplines in MMA and the more famous ones are Jiu-Jitsu, Judo, Muay Thai and wrestling.

You paid to be trained at these quality gyms so you should get what you wanted.<br /><br />Another aspect in how to find a qualified MMA gym that is good for you is scouting them first. Usually, gyms will let new and potential students to see the training sessions for the current students. Avoid places which do not do any sparring activities. Plenty of sparring are the key to gain experience and toughen up your body and mind. If the instructor said 'our style is really effective and deadly' but no sparring activities to prove that statement, just walk out of that poser gym.<br /><br />In a nutshell, choosing MMA gyms is the most important step in going to the path of an MMA fighter. Only great gyms produce great product so you should give your all in finding a qualified MMA gym for yourself.

The truth is, there really is no excuse not to give it a shot. Many MMA training regimes are fast and explosive, taking little time out of the day. Although this won't be enough to get you to the pros, it will certainly give you a platform to start with.<br /><br />Starting Your Training Regime<br /><br />When you're a beginner you will probably find yourself so bombarded with information that you won't have a clue where to begin. The best thing to do is to start with the basic stand up moves. The first punches you should learn are the; jab, cross and hook; and the first kicks you should learn are the; round kick, front kick and side kick. Once you've mastered these basic moves then you'll be able to complete bag work and shadow boxing exercises to increase your overall set of skills.<br /><br />Once you know the basic moves then you should design your own specific training routine. Try to work it around your own schedule, and don't just train the moves themselves as you will need to incorporate strength and conditioning exercise as well. When you're beginning try to train at least four times per week. Dedicate two days to practising your fighting with bag work or with a training partner, one day to strength training with weights, and one day to cardiovascular training such as running. Train for 30 minutes to an hour on each day and remember to warm up and cool down properly.<br /><br />Upping The Pace<br /><br />When you feel comfortable then you need to start upping the pace. This is about the time you should join an MMA gym and take some regular classes to learn new moves and techniques. MMA gyms are a great place to find training partners and the spar against other fighters. This is a good way to get an idea of what to expect in the ring.<br /><br />Once you have been training at the gym for a while then you should tell your instructor that you want to fight. Many gyms will arrange amateur mixed martial arts competitions for all of the local gyms. This is the best way to get your foot in the door, and if you have a fight coming up then your instructor will certainly put in that extra effort to ensure you're in good shape. After all, you are representing them as much as they are representing you.<br /><br />Going Professional<br /><br />Once you have a few amateur fights under you, and hopefully a few wins! Then you can start approaching professional promotions. At this point you should also start hunting for some form of representation such as a manager. This way you can leave the business aspect up to them so you can concentrate on training for your next bout.<br /><br />There is so much to think about if you want to become a pro MMA fighter. However if you are new to the sport then just try to learn a few things and have a bit of fun. Take things step by step and don't try to force yourself into fights before you're ready.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5kYWlseXN0cmVuZ3RoLm9yZy9wZW9wbGUvMjEwMDk5My9qb3VybmFs" target="_blank">Click here</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5tYWR2aWxsZS5jb20vYmxvZ3MvNTQyMjI3X2NsaWNrX2hlcmU_" target="_blank">Houston MMA</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5zdXBlcm5vdmEuY29tL0dheWxob2VMYWR5YXJmb3JnZS9ibG9nLzc0OTI1OQ__" target="_blank">Kids Karate Houston</a>

It requires elite athleticism coupled with an endless number of skills to master as part of your MMA training.<br /><br />Endurance<br /><br />Fighting 3-5, 5 minute rounds, the sport demands high levels of endurance from an athlete who is required to perform his lethal best from bell to bell.<br /><br />In an era of high-intensity-interval-training (HIIT) and Tabata protocols, endurance is an often overlooked aspect of MMA training, but probably one of the most essential.<br /><br />By endurance training we are talking about aerobic capacity, and this is developed by roadwork, swimming, bike riding or triathlons. These are just some suggestions, but any activity performed at a 120-150 bpm range will develop your endurance ability, as long as that activity is performed for between 40-90 minutes.<br /><br />The aim is to have a resting heart-rate of between 45-50 bpm. This is demonstration that your body is efficient at utilising oxygen as energy and each heartbeat is delivering a large amount of oxygenated blood to your muscles.<br /><br />Most fighters use traditional roadwork - or long slow distance (LSD) runs, to develop endurance. It is still common for many fighters to wake up at the crack of dawn and go for their morning runs before MMA training fully begins. Such endurance work is great active recovery and primes your body for a day of work in the gym. Some fighters also use roadwork in the evening, or prefer to swim, ride a bike, skip or shadowbox instead. The key is to target the 120-150 bpm heart range, and stay in that range for up to 90 minutes three or four times a week. A heart rate monitor is a great investment in looking to maximise endurance.<br /><br />Anaerobic<br /><br />As much as having a good aerobic base is the foundation of your athleticism, most your time fighting will still be spent in the anaerobic zone. Anaerobic power relies on glycogen reserves in your muscles and liver to fuel your body.<br /><br />These energy reserves, although extremely powerful, only last a couple of minutes before being depleted. This is why you will often see a fighter throw a quick flurry of punches and then gas out. It is then up to the aerobic energy system to break down fatty tissue and refuel the muscles with glycogen.<br /><br />The best way to train anaerobic capacity is using HIIT, Tabata protocols and a variety of other short workouts which keep your heart rate between 150-171 bpm.<br /><br />These are performed for short bursts of activity with short rest periods. For example using one HIIT protocol, you could perform 30-40 seconds of hard sprinting alternated with 15-20 seconds of jogging or walking. Do that for 15-20 minutes.<br /><br />The Tabata protocol is even more demanding and requires 20 seconds of intense activity which gets your heart to 170bpm, then 10 seconds of rest for 20 minutes. Anaerobic training is definitely not for the feint hearted and is probably the hardest to endure for most aspiring MMA athletes.<br /><br />Strength<br /><br />Strength is also crucial to MMA training. It's how you put them together as part of your MMA training and transition between each aspect of the fight which truly distinguishes you as a mixed martial artist.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5hbGl2ZW5vdGRlYWQuY29tL2FkYW1hYmFrNjE0L0tpZHMtS2FyYXRlLUhvdXN0b24tcHJvZmlsZS0yODE3ODYzLmh0bWw_" target="_blank">Click here</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5tYWR2aWxsZS5jb20vYmxvZ3MvNTQyMjMyX2tpZHNfa2FyYXRlX2NsYXNzZXNfaG91c3Rvbg__" target="_blank">Houston martial arts</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jZW9mdXNpb24ub3JnL25vZGUvMzIyMjU2" target="_blank">Find out more</a>

Every instructor wants to adults because they pay on time and the instructor can relate to them better than they can if they were younger (this why youth instructors frequently run the kids programs.)<br /><br />The best way to find people who would be interested in hardcore self defense is to run them through a selection process. A selection process allows an instructor the best of both worlds, they can teach a program that makes money (fitness) and up sell those people who are interested in kicking more butt to hardcore martial arts programs.<br /><br />This also gives the instructor the bigger benefit of dealing with people who know like and trust the instructor. They also know (in general) what the instructor teaches, how it is taught, and what they will learn. Therefore, dealing with other martial arts schools trying to steal techniques get weeded out from the beginning because they will mistakenly belief that the fitness class is the martial arts class. However, most of the backend up sell profits come from the instructor's real martial arts class which most people have to qualify to get into in the future.<br /><br />Make no mistake though, the martial arts instructor will find that the fitness class will make more money, but they do not even have to teach that fitness class. They can find someone locally or someone in their own school and focus on running the back end business until it is time to teach the martial arts class.<br /><br />It may even be smart to have the martial arts class be totally separate and only by approval by the main instructor. This class may include special belts, shirts, or whatever that instructor wants to put into that program. Different shirts or belts will cause other people to be curious about the program and they may suddenly feel the urge to try to qualify for the program when they previously did not have any inclination in taking the course.<br /><br />All in all, it is important to remember that people have to qualify to be a part of this program and get approved into the program. Not everyone should be let into this program, and not everyone should be able to pay to get into the program. If anything, this one course needs to be exclusive and treated like an exclusive club that people should want to be a part of in the future. That is how this strategy works best in the future of the martial arts school.<br /><br />Remember people have to go through the system or they will not like your class and they will be very hard to close. If possible, a person should be weeded out before they get to know your full classes because if they stay through the original course then you are likely to have a lifetime member of your school on your hands. If you do not use the fitness system to weed out clients, then you will be forced to have &quot;martial arts trials&quot; where you spend an hour or two &quot;closing&quot; a prospect. Therefore, update your systems and have a sales system in your pocket today.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5CYW1CYW1NYXJ0aWFsYXJ0cy5jb20v" target="_blank">Kids Martial Arts Houston</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5iYW1iYW1tYXJ0aWFsYXJ0cy5jb20vbWFydGlhbC1hcnRzLWtpZHMtaG91c3Rvbg__" target="_blank">Kids Martial Arts Houston</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5iYW1iYW1tYXJ0aWFsYXJ0cy5jb20vbWFydGlhbC1hcnRzLWtpZHMtaG91c3Rvbi8_" target="_blank">Houston martial arts</a>

It is a sport with a growing number of participants across the globe. If you are looking for a new and exciting way to remain healthy and fit, then kickboxing might just be what you need to add some energy to your life. Your heart and whole body stand to benefit from kickboxing in addition to the ability to be able to defend yourself from harm. This article explores some of those additional benefits.<br /><br />Improve your confidence <br />If you are looking for a way to increase your confidence levels, kickboxing is a great way to achieve your goal. Kickboxing demands a level of aggression that naturally leads to increased confidence. According to medical experts, the endorphins that are released in your body whilst taking part in a kickboxing also lead to a calm confidence in oneself. This tends to make you happy and often spills over, positively improving your quality of life. As you develop your strength, skills and general well-being, you will also find that contentment in who you are and what you can achieve leads to increased confidence. This can often have a positive effect on other aspects of your life such as your career. Kickboxing is also a great way to reduce stress levels that can also lead to low self-esteem.<br /><br />Burn off Excess fat - Get Ripped! <br />OK, so it might not give you the six-pack you've been dreaming, that is straight away anyway, but in time kickboxing leads to a conditioning and strengthening of the body that can result in your dream of a ribbed stomach. Kickboxing is an extremely effective way of burning excess fat in the body. An hour of kickboxing training is reported to be enough to burn as much as 800 calories. Those seeking for ways to shed some excess fat are definitely in for a good time by participating in kickboxing. The sport is great for staying fit. Even people who are suffering from poor coordination and posture can benefit greatly from kickboxing as it helps to deal with weak muscles and injuries. If you lead a rather sedentary lifestyle, such as spending the greater part of your day in front of a computer, kickboxing will help strengthen the muscles of your abdominal wall and back which are often weakened from such inactivity, resulting in poor posture.<br /><br />Feeling Sluggish? Boost Your Energy Levels <br />Kickboxing helps boost your energy levels when you are feeling sapped as the sport involves high energy cardio routines. Elimination of harmful toxins from the body is also a benefit to be derived from kickboxing training. Whilst exercising, your body will dump these toxins through your sweat, leaving you feeling generally more energised and active in day-to-day life. Much better than a bar of chocolate!<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5CYW1CYW1NYXJ0aWFsYXJ0cy5jb20v" target="_blank">Find out more</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5iYW1iYW1tYXJ0aWFsYXJ0cy5jb20vbWFydGlhbC1hcnRzLWtpZHMtaG91c3Rvbg__" target="_blank">Kids Martial Arts Houston</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5iYW1iYW1tYXJ0aWFsYXJ0cy5jb20va2lja2JveGluZ2hvdXN0b24_" target="_blank">Houston kickboxing</a>

There is actually very little difference between men's MMA and the female version; for example they both have similar rules, fight in the same styled rings, bout for fixed time limits and wear limited amounts of protective gear. The only thing that really differs is the type of equipment that MMA women fighters use, mainly due to the obvious differences in their body shapes and the size of their hands.<br /><br />Beginners of mixed martial arts may be both confused and excited by the wide variety of products that are available to them; especially women fighters who have to endure large sporting companies trying to sell them things that look good, but are useless in the ring. Looking sharp and sexy is actually an important part of being an amateur and pro fighter; you want people to remember you as the majority of spectators tend to route for the better looking or most colorful fighter. Though remember that your main concern should be protection against serious injuries and finding equipment that is comfortable to fight in.<br /><br />There are many different types of MMA equipment available, but here is a list and description of the most important and useful items that you might want to consider investing in for both training and fight usage:<br /><br />Sparring gloves:<br /><br />These gloves usually come in the traditional 'light bulb' shape or a Muay Thai kickboxing style with extra padding added to the top area. You'll want to choose a pair that weighs at least 14 ounces, otherwise both you and your sparring partner will end up getting hurt. Finding a pair with Velcro straps is better for training purposes as they slip on and off with ease compared with the traditional lace-ups.<br /><br />MMA woman fight gloves: <br /><br />Unlike traditional boxing gloves MMA gloves have an open fingered design with individual loops that hold your hands to the top part and padding covering the knuckles and wrist areas. A good starting weight for beginner is about 4 or 5 ounces which gives a natural feel and allows the fighter the freedom to move more freely when grappling their opponent.<br /><br />Rash guards:<br /><br />These look similar to a thin wet suit; they hug the top half of your body and are made of a special material that absorbs and pushes sweat away from the body. If you're wondering why this piece of equipment is so useful, try spending several hours in a training session with your hot sweaty body wrapped around another person. Women have the added advantage of having a number of tank top styled rash guards that double as a sports bra and chest protector, allowing in much more air than the long sleeved varieties.<br /><br />Chest Protectors:<br /><br />Designed especially for women with a particularly sensitive breast area; these come in 3 variations, a sport bra styled compressor that pushes everything in and provides padded protection, individual disk shaped turtle pad inserts that slip into the bra and a more bulky synthetic shield that wraps around your chest area.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5iYW1iYW1tYXJ0aWFsYXJ0cy5jb20vbWFydGlhbC1hcnRzLWtpZHMtaG91c3Rvbg__" target="_blank">Houston MMA</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5CYW1CYW1NYXJ0aWFsYXJ0cy5jb20v" target="_blank">Find out more</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5iYW1iYW1tYXJ0aWFsYXJ0cy5jb20vbWFydGlhbC1hcnRzLWtpZHMtaG91c3Rvbi8_" target="_blank">Houston martial arts</a>

MMA conditioning requires muscle and cardio endurance. You must be geared up for maximal energy depletion for at least three, five minute rounds.<br /><br />Training for MMA is thorough and nothing like other sports. Particular MMA conditioning techniques should focus on these attributes:<br /><br />Condition Your Legs<br /><br />Your legs are put-upon the most in MMA. Conditioning your legs will assist to improve your equilibrium and explosive ability. Your legs are your cornerstone. They will keep you steady and on your feet throughout a fight. Given that your adversary will weigh just as much as you, then it is important that you get strong enough to be able to squat at least two times your body weight.<br /><br />Squats Are Essential<br /><br />Those who are successful in MMA can squat more than two times their body weight. This helps to ensure The fundamental thing to remember is that you first understand the movement and to gradually keep adding more weight. It is O.k. to progress at your own speed.<br /><br />Upper Body Conditioning<br /><br />Learning correct lifting techniques will serve to improve your upper body strength and help you to control your opponent. Bench pressing is a lift that will help you gain upper body strength. Keep the bench press movements short and explosive. This will help to improve your upper body muscle endurance.<br /><br />Explosive Movements<br /><br />If you lift the weights slowly, it will not translate well into MMA fights because you need to have explosive moves. MMA conditioning should include exercises geared towards gaining explosive power.<br /><br />Your Body's Core<br /><br />MMA conditioning will not be complete without a reasonable core exercise routine. You not only need to strengthen your core for MMA fights, but to also help to prevent injury during training. The harder you train, the easier an MMA match will seem.<br /><br />Training Hard<br /><br />The trick to conditioning is to do your training harder than an real fight so that it will feel much easier. Once you master the correct MMA conditioning program, fighting and training will seem easier.<br /><br />Overall, if you are determined about being able to be the best trained fighter that you can be, then it is imperative that you train harder than you fight. Practice makes perfect. At times training can seem to be tedious. The top MMA fighters attain a deep understanding of what it takes to succeed. MMA conditioning, when performed correctly, will bring you to a new level as an MMA fighter.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5CYW1CYW1NYXJ0aWFsYXJ0cy5jb20v" target="_blank">Houston MMA</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5iYW1iYW1tYXJ0aWFsYXJ0cy5jb20va2lja2JveGluZ2hvdXN0b24_" target="_blank">Kids martial arts classes Houston</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5iYW1iYW1tYXJ0aWFsYXJ0cy5jb20vbWFydGlhbC1hcnRzLWtpZHMtaG91c3Rvbi8_" target="_blank">Houston MMA</a>

Being able to obtain your ideal body weight is a skill that you must learn so you can gain the right advantage over your opponent.<br /><br />The best MMA diet plan should be followed to a &quot;T&quot; and should be coupled with persistent and dedicated training. If you are a beginning or intermediate MMA fighter, then you know how much a diet can either help or interfere with both your training and you're fighting. If you have too much fat, then yes, you will be a little stronger, but you will not have as much agility, and if you diet too much you will lack the strength and power that it takes to successfully hold your opponent in down. This is why anyone who is striving to excel in MMA should pay close attention to their MMA diet.<br /><br />The MMA Diet Plan<br /><br />When you are training for MMA, it is best to eat small portions each meal and not try to stuff yourself all the time. Although you might be hungry enough to eat two or three plates at each meal, it is more important to eat more often throughout the day so your body has a chance to digest the food and be used for energy. The perfect MMA diet plan should contain lots of fruits and vegetables as well as complex carbohydrates coming from foods such as oatmeal. In fact, eating oatmeal is a good food choice even before you train as long as it is consumed 45 minutes prior. This will give your body time to work it out of your stomach so it can be used for energy.<br /><br />When you are an MMA diet plan, it is very important to stay away from soft drinks and desserts that have a high sugar content as well as almost all junk food and fried food. All of the foods just mentioned have a high propensity to help anyone gain a lot of body fat that will hinder your fighting. Ever try to kick you opponent with a lot of fat on your stomach? It is much easier when you are leaner.<br /><br />Instead of carbonated sodas you should concentrate on drinking plenty of water each day. Your muscles are 80% water and your strength will be directly related to how hydrated your body is. So, staying hydrated is key to your strength. Drinking plenty of water will also keep you from being dehydrated during training.<br /><br />Supplements to Avoid When On An MMA Diet<br /><br />Although creatine monohydrate can help you with your strength training in the gym, it can keep you from making weight if you are trying to fight in a lower weight class. Remember, you will get exactly out of your diet what you put into it. The right MMA diet will also help you train more aggressively both in the gym lifting weights and when you grapple. If you have dreams to being a professional MMA fighter one day, your MMA diet is not only imperative, it will literally make you or break you as a fighter.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5CYW1CYW1NYXJ0aWFsQXJ0cy5jb20_" target="_blank">Kids Martial Arts Houston</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5CYW1CYW1NYXJ0aWFsYXJ0cy5jb20v" target="_blank">Houston MMA</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5iYW1iYW1tYXJ0aWFsYXJ0cy5jb20vbWFydGlhbC1hcnRzLWtpZHMtaG91c3Rvbg__" target="_blank">Click here</a>

And its flagship organization, the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) hasn't even turned 20 yet. But its meteoric rise from holding 2,000 seats in Denver, Colorado back in 1993, to hosting an audience of 55,000 across the border, with millions of paying viewers worldwide.<br /><br />What makes people get hooked on MMA? Is it the gore? Maybe a more dynamic combat approach compared to boxing? Is it the next best thing to a street fight? Or other interesting stuff we can learn in the cage? While other sports like basketball and football require lots of running, MMA has the best athletes in the world, with all muscles and aspects of fitness utilized during the match. 5 minutes of constant moving is more tiring than 10 minutes of running and stopping for a breather. You punch, kick, grapple, carry, slam, backpedal, sprint, twist, move laterally, jump, take a hit, and what not; MMA fighters can do it all!<br /><br />Just like what UFC President Dana White would always say, &quot;So you want to be a F*@#$&amp;! Fighter?&quot; Back then, people were too afraid to train MMA due to its no holds barred nature and a bloody nature. With athletic commissions implementing sanctioning bodies and more rules applied to make it mainstream, we now consider MMA to be fun, safe, a perfect fitness outlet, and can be used for self-defense outdoors.<br /><br />While we spend tons of cash enrolling in MMA classes, it's hard to deny that, with a busy schedule (unless you actually train MMA as a profession), it might be a difficult long-term investment to commit weekly sessions in local MMA gyms. Sometimes, we wish to improve our strength at home. However, do you really think you can improve punching power with a heavy pair of dumbbells, or even kick with dumbbells? Or how you can strengthen your chokes?<br /><br />Actually, you don't need dumbbells and barbells to improve your striking and grappling power. You can now train various disciplines through Adaptive Resistance Training (ART), a form of Functional Training. ART represents what really happens when you modify strength training for real-life functional application. For ART training, you need to work against resistance. Although free weights and other options are available, many are limited in what you can do with them, relying on gravity alone.<br /><br />The equipment of your choice must be versatile enough to handle a great demand for ROM. It must have an adjustable cable attachments, depending on what type of strikes you need to develop. If you need to improve your punching power, make sure you adjust the pulleys near shoulder level. To increase your kicking power, position the pulley on ankle level, since you generate your kicks from the ground up.<br /><br />Your power, technique and ease of movement in the cage will improve in no time, as your conditioning and confidence soaring big time. Now get that kick-ass equipment, train hard at home, and kick ass out there!<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wdXJldm9sdW1lLmNvbS9hZGFtYWJhazYxNC9wb3N0cy8yMzYxMzUzL0hvdXN0b24rTU1B" target="_blank">Kids martial arts classes Houston</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3N0ZXZlbXVucm85MjQucG9zdGVyb3VzLmNvbS9raWRzLW1hcnRpYWwtYXJ0cy1jbGFzc2VzLWhvdXN0b24tMjQ3NjM_" target="_blank">Kids Karate classes Houston</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy52aWxhZ28yMS5jb20vZXZlbnQvS2lkcytNYXJ0aWFsK0FydHMrSG91c3Rvbi8xMzg4MzY4L3Byb2ZpbGU_" target="_blank">Click here</a>

With the demand continuing to increase, the fighter must be a fine tuned machine to keep up. Of course, this starts in the gym. Skill and strategy are important but they can't replace conditioning. When skill fails and courage fades the body must still be able to perform like a machine. For the human body to allow this, one must follow a good training program. --The following is a general outline of such a program. I call it the machine workout. To obtain maximum efficiency and control over the human body, the fighter must understand how the body responds to change. A great athlete needs strength, speed, agility, flexibility, and endurance to perform to the peak of their potential. Furthermore, an even balance of all of these attributes is required for efficiency in any situation. Any imbalance or weakness in any of these areas results in a weakness in the game of the athlete. To an MMA fighter, if there is a weakness, it will be exploited. Too much power training and you slow down. Too much speed training and you start to lose power. Even too much stretching can result in loss of explosiveness. So, while training for fights, the fighters and coaches should carefully monitor how much work is done in each area to keep the body from literally fighting itself. The best way to do this is Periodization or, separating the parts of the training goal into set amounts of time. These time periods can be a few days to several months depending on individual goals. This machine workout program, as I have nicknamed it, is specially formatted for MMA fighters. This is a general overview of the pieces and not descriptions of exercises for a workout. Before beginning the program, all the exercises that will be used for each period should be written down. An alternative to writing out the exercises is simply to work with a coach who can guide the fighter through each workout at a steady pace.<br /><br />I have broken the mentioned physical attributes into four workout periods. A block for flexibility training is left out because it should be included in every period to maintain full range of motion through the growing process. Endurance training is the first step to becoming a great athlete and a great fighter. Ideally it should be done for about 6 weeks followed by a rest period of at least 3 days. Isolating this type of training is helpful for many reasons. The world of competitive fighting is a crazy and unpredictable place. Fighters often take fights on extremely short notice. At the amateur level, some even agree to a match the day of the event. Dedicating a training period solely to endurance, when there are no upcoming fights, allows the fighter to already be in shape and compete on short notice. The key to endurance training is variety. In my own experience, adding swimming to my workout rapidly improved my stamina. There are so many demanding activities, so choosing many different types should be easy. The goal is not to make it to the bell, but to perform to the greatest of your potential, at every second.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2FkYW1hYmFrNjE0LmppZ3N5LmNvbS9lbnRyaWVzL2dlbmVyYWwvS2lkcy1LYXJhdGUtY2xhc3Nlcy1Ib3VzdG9uLTM_" target="_blank">Find out more</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2FkYW1hYmFrNjE0LnhhbmdhLmNvbS83Njc4ODEwNTIvaG91c3Rvbi1tbWEv" target="_blank">Find out more</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/stevemunro/blog/blogid=11978084" target="_blank">Kids Karate Houston</a>

As I was actively learning the different steps needed to defeat an opponent (like when you play chess, you must think ahead, it is about strategy, about strengths, and also about honesty, know yourself, and also trust your trainer).<br /><br />After my first class, I knew I was hooked, it wasn't mindless weight lifting, or running till I'm skin and bones. The professional MMA fighters and trainers were all in supreme shape, a perfect blend of strength, endurance, and mental balance.<br /><br />Now about battling in the octagon, it is not required by any MMA school that if you start taking classes you need to ever step into or even support the &quot;action&quot; in the octagon to test your skills. There are beginner's classes and children's classes that focus mostly on the &quot;getting in shape&quot; and TOTAL balance of mind, body, and spirit aspect of MMA. However, there are advanced classes and sparring and &quot;live&quot; sessions where you can test all of your MMA, again, without entering the octagon.<br /><br />Finally, there is entering the octagon. If you have an over whelming desire or ambition of becoming a Pro MMA fighter, then this is the path you will be taking. I never knew after my first class, that I would end up in the octagon, but yet here I am and loving each time I get to enter the cage. Bas Rutten, a UFC Heavyweight Champion, 3 time winner of the Pancrase world champion, now the retired Dutch MMA fighter is an MMA authority, revered and respected he advises that a fighter waits at least three years before their first MMA fight. I think this is a very good and sound rule of thumb.<br /><br />I entered the octagon after only one year of training and even though my stand up was really good and I was beating my opponent that way, eventually he exploited my weakness and took me to the ground and beat me with a &quot;rear naked choke&quot;. (MMA terminology yet I believe you can imagine it was less than pleasant and definitely not something I wished to repeat). I was not discouraged however, perhaps more motivated as I have never been a quitter and have stood by everything I've worked toward and still do until the end result is accomplished. Until then it is all a work in progress, as I am and will continue to be for there is no &quot;perfect&quot; technique or fighter yet they have perfected to the best of their abilities their own strengths and weaknesses and using that philosophy I worked harder on my ground game. My next fight, I sought out another &quot;striker&quot; as I thought this would be a good matchup, instead of fighting another fighter with a wrestling background. I say get into shape the MMA way and start today for a new body, mind, and outlook on life!<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2FkYW1hYmFrNjE0LmppZ3N5LmNvbS9lbnRyaWVzL2dlbmVyYWwvVGhpcy1zaXRl" target="_blank">Click here</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5pYW1zcG9ydC5vcmcvc2VhcmNoLz90YWc9aG91c3RvbittYXJ0aWFsK2FydHM_" target="_blank">Kids Karate Houston</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2FkYW1hYmFrNjE0LnBvc3Rlcm91cy5jb20va2lkcy1tYXJ0aWFsLWFydHMtY2xhc3Nlcy1ob3VzdG9u" target="_blank">Houston kickboxing</a>

Let's go back in time on how a properly executed kick can make a big difference in a match.<br /><br />In 2008, Seth Petruzelli managed to knock legendary street fight icon Kimbo Slice by using a kick to set up a knock out punch. Petruzelli used a well timed front kick against the advancing Kimbo. The kick stunned Kimbo and Petruzelli wasted no chance to follow up with a haymaker that knocked Kimbo to the ground.<br /><br />That is just one example on how devastating a kick can be in a match.<br /><br />The vast disciplines of martial arts offer many different forms of kicks. The technique that Petruzelli used is just one of them. All martial arts basically recognize these types of basic kicks:<br /><br />- The front kick:<br /><br />This is one of the very basic kicks in martial arts. It is a very simple technique to execute. To execute this technique, raise your knee and direct it to your target. Quickly snap your leg forward and hit your target with your toe. Once you hit the target, quickly pull your leg to resume your fighting stance. The main target for this technique is usually the solar plexus or the center area of the chest. Despite its simplicity, this technique can be lethal if you are able to follow it up with a strong punch or a stronger kick. The example we talk about in the early paragraphs of this article is the proof of the efficiency of the kick.<br /><br />- The side kick:<br /><br />This type of kick is commonly taught in Tae Kwon Do and Karate. To execute this technique, you must first turn your body sideways and then lift your knee. Afterwards, kick to your side by using your heel as the contact area. Your kicking foot must be parallel to the floor. The main target area of this technique is usually the midsection. Advanced martial artists also like to use this move to hit their opponents' heads.<br /><br />- The crescent kick:<br /><br />If you use a right-handed fighting stance, you initiate this type of kick by lifting your left knee. Afterwards, execute a kick using your foot in a circular, clockwise motion. To apply this technique using your right foot, then kick in a counterclockwise manner.<br /><br />These are the basic kicks that you must master before learning more advanced kicking moves.<br /><br />More advanced kicking techniques include the roundhouse kick and the flying kick. Most of them are not very effective in the MMA cage despite of their fancy looks. This does not mean that you do not need to learn them to become a pro MMA fighter. At times, mastering advanced kicks can also contribute significantly to your flexibility and agility.<br /><br />Remember, mastering punching basics and basic kicking techniques are essential for your development as a complete MMA fighter.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wdXJldm9sdW1lLmNvbS90aWVubmVyb3NlbjkyMy9wb3N0cy8yMzUyMDU3L0hvdXN0b24ra2lja2JveGluZw__" target="_blank">Houston martial arts</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/etiennerosendal/blog/blogid=11996254" target="_blank">Kids Martial Arts Houston</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWdlbnRlLmNvbS95b3VyX3BhZ2UvYmxvZy92aWV3X3Bvc3RpbmcuaHRtbD9waWQ9MzQ0MDQwNiZhbXA7cHJvZmlsZV9pZD03NjMxNzc1JmFtcDtwcm9maWxlX25hbWU9c3RldmVtdW5ybzkyNCZhbXA7dXNlcl9pZD03NjMxNzc1JmFtcDt1c2VybmFtZT1zdGV2ZW11bnJvOTI0" target="_blank">Houston kickboxing</a>

That said you must know some essential things before you choose or buy and MMA gloves.<br /><br />You will need different varieties for sparring and practise sessions, for actual competition fights and for bag work. This is due to the different padding in gloves and how much movement of the fingers they allow.<br /><br />MMA fight gloves are built to keep both fighters safe and protected. By design they have a lot less padding than sparring gloves and are designed for real competition. The type we use for bag work require a lot more padding to protect your hands. Of course your hands do need to be 'toughened up' but there are limits and I don't suggest repeatedly punching a bag as a safe method!<br /><br />For grappling work you will need the type that offers more freedom of movement.<br /><br />I should also talk about MMA handwraps - many fighter do not use them when practicing MMA, but I strongly recommend them. Again I must point out that finger injuries can be a serious setback keeping you away from training for months. Your fists are very important tools and I always make the effort to wrap and protect mine properly. Also, you will have to have wrapped hands during MMA competition so you may as well get use to it. Shorter wraps are available for those that have problems fitting them into your gloves.<br /><br />Cheap MMA gloves are best find at shops online. I do recommend trying them on to check they are comfortable. It's a bit cheeky but I will visit a store, try them for comfort and size and then order them online where they are cheaper! If you can't do this a good online store will offer a return guarantee so if you don't like them you can send them back for a replacement or refund<br /><br />A quality pair of MMA gloves will have padding which is softer and l like these gloves better for sparring. If your sparring buddy complains this will be an obvious clue. As well as protecting your own hands it's only fair to consider your training partner! Certain typesof gloves feel very 'snug' on the hands and this is a personal choice - not too loose, not too tight. Absorbing the shock from big punches is another thing to consider. A good strong bag is needed for this test! Get some real power into some punches and see if this impacts your wrists, hands or elbows. With the right level of padding the impact and shock should be minimal.<br /><br />At the same time as you order your gloves think about what other MMA gear you may need. As well as clothing like MMA shorts you may also order training aids like pads and focus mitts from a decent supplier. Mouthguards are something else to think about and another item I suggest spending money on and not going for a cheap option. You will take a lot of knocks in a fight and you want to protect yourself as much as you can!<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2dyb3Vwcy5kaWlnby5jb20vZ3JvdXAvenduZG5ta3dqYnZmaWZkaW9lc2ovY29udGVudC9raWRzLWthcmF0ZS1jbGFzc2VzLWhvdXN0b24tNjQwMzc1Mg__" target="_blank">This site</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5kYWlseXN0cmVuZ3RoLm9yZy9wZW9wbGUvMjEwMDk5My9qb3VybmFs" target="_blank">Click here</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wdXJldm9sdW1lLmNvbS9zdGV2ZW11bnJvOTI0L3Bvc3RzLzIzNTI0NjgvSG91c3RvbittYXJ0aWFsK2FydHM_" target="_blank">Kids martial arts classes Houston</a>

Do that for 15-20 minutes.<br /><br />The Tabata protocol is even more demanding and requires 20 seconds of intense activity which gets your heart to 170bpm, then 10 seconds of rest for 20 minutes. Anaerobic training is definitely not for the feint hearted and is probably the hardest to endure for most aspiring MMA athletes.<br /><br />Strength<br /><br />Strength is also crucial to MMA training. Because grappling is such an important part of the sport, being able to manipulate, manoeuvre and control your opponent often comes down to sheer strength.<br /><br />There are many ways to develop your strength, using barbells, bodyweight training, strong man training or even Olympic weight lifting.<br /><br />The key to gaining efficiency in these facets requires training with resistance of up to 90% of the amount of weight you can lift for one repetition, using short cycles of 3-5 repetitions for 5 sets.<br /><br />This could include 3-5 hand-stand push-ups for 5 sets, or 3-5 standing presses for 5 sets. Strength training is hard on your central nervous system so you should have plenty of recovery between sets to make sure you hit each set fully fresh. This could be between 3-5 minutes of rest between sets.<br /><br />Barbell training is an easy to measure and accessible way to train strength. Stick to big compound moves that train the body proportionally using multiple muscles in sequence. The squat, bench press, deadlift and shoulder press or pull-ups are perfect.<br /><br />The aim of the MMA fighter should be to develop strength such as you can squat 1.5-2 x bodyweight, bench press your 1.25-1.5 x bodyweight, deadlift 2-2.5 x bodyweight, and perform 10 pull-ups with 20kg of additional weight attached.<br /><br />Skills<br /><br />MMA is a constantly evolving sport and a number of unarmed combat disciplines have been incorporated by many fighters - from karate to sambo and from judo to taekwondo.<br /><br />Regardless of which disciplines you chose to incorporate into your own style, you will have to pay particular attention to three key parts of the sport - the striking, the grappling, and the submissions.<br /><br />All fights start standing, and often end there. You will need to develop skill in striking, be able to deliver knockout blows, and have proficient footwork and hand speed to control the fight and throw combos at your opponent. Two of the best striking arts directly applicable to MMA are Muay Thai and boxing - which often form the basis of most MMA fighters' striking skills. Some also incorporate taekwondo in order to develop a less predictable striking style.<br /><br />Grappling is also essential, and probably the most dominant discipline in the sport. You must control your opponent's body at all times, be able to fight in the clinch, control him up against the cage and on the ground. The best skills for this are wrestling - both freestyle and Greco-Roman, as well as judo and Russian sambo. It's how you put them together as part of your MMA training and transition between each aspect of the fight which truly distinguishes you as a mixed martial artist.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2FkYW1hYmFrNjE0LmppZ3N5LmNvbS9lbnRyaWVzL2dlbmVyYWwvS2lkcy1tYXJ0aWFsLWFydHMtY2xhc3Nlcy1Ib3VzdG9uLTM_" target="_blank">Kids Karate Houston</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2FkYW1hYmFrNjE0LmRtdXNpYy5uZXQvam91cm5hbC8xNTM0NDU5" target="_blank">Houston MMA</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3N0ZXZlbXVucm85MjQueGFuZ2EuY29tLzc2Nzg4MTMyNi9raWRzLWthcmF0ZS1jbGFzc2VzLWhvdXN0b24v" target="_blank">Kids Martial Arts Houston</a>
