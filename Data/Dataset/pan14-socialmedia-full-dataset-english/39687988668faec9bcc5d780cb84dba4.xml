If a woman is virgin before marriage she should be proud of it and celebrate it. Express your virginity during marriage negoriation or during love affair or even in married life. I am sure you will be honoured by your husband or lover. It will give you dignity acros your conjugal life. Every man likes and aspires a virgin wife. To the men folk Virgin wife is like Angel.
<br /><br />Virgin girl is not rara avis (rare bird). Stil 80 percent rural and 30 percent urban girl remains virgin in India. In Japan it is 99 percent, Thailand 98, Arab countries 99, Pak 95. But it is less in US 30 percent and Europe 20 (religious family only). Plz Forward it to your beloved women

This quote is very apt when we talk about science. I believe that science is everywhere. From the moment we open our eyes in the morning till the time we retire to bed at night. We live in a world of science, be it in the technological world or the phenomena of nature.Infact,the physiological processes occurring within our body are also scientific processes. There are uncountable examples which we can site in order to prove that science is ubiquitous. But it will be wrong if I assert that children indentify with science wherever they go and  in whatever they do. I feel, many children look at science as a subject and cannot always relate with science.
<br />            When children land into the world of entertainment they are the farthest from the thoughts of science. For example, how many children try to find out about the technology behind the electronic gadgets they use while playing games? It is true that children should not always be expected to think about the technology behind everything they come across at a very young age but they should definitely be encouraged to learn more about the simplest scientific principles which are used in our daily lives. For example, about the science behind constructing the rides in amusement parks. While preparing a seminar on Amusement Park Science, I realized more and more that children should know the physics behind these amazing majestic structures built by engineers by implementing some of the scientific principles which are taught in earlier years at junior and high school. As a matter of fact, this knowledge will not only surprise the children but also convince some of the parents who don’t permit their children to ride these fearing the threat of injury.
<br />          The designers carefully craft these thrilling rides like the roller coasters,UFO,Pirate Ship, Bumper Cars etc  and we are actually in less danger than we think. The principle behind the operation of a roller coaster is the conversion of potential energy into kinetic energy and vice versa. Different scientific concepts are utilized for designing the coaster like; the peak of the second hill is lower as some mechanical energy is lost due to friction. The roller coaster designer uses the knowledge of kinematics, acceleration, gravitational forces etc while designing this gigantic structure. The UFO or the flying saucer is also a very popular ride. In the UFO,a central driver hub has a circle around it and twelve four person gondolas are mounted on it. The driver hub is in turn connected to a hydraulic arm. There are no safety restraints on the UFO; the centrifugal force is strong enough to prevent the riders from experiencing any major movement while the ride is not at horizontal. In the pirate ship, the riders are subjected to various levels of angular momentum when the ship swings back and forth. This is a typical pendulum ride and the riders experience high gravitational forces and weightlessness. Bumper Cars are a good way to look at Newton’s second and third laws of motion. These cars run on electricity carried by a pole on the back of the car that leads up to wire grid in the ride’s ceiling. This grid carries electricity that runs the car. Electrical energy carried to the cars from the grid is converted to kinetic energy, some of which is converted to heat. Seat belts are provided in the cars to prevent the riders from injury. The type of collision, velocity of the cars and the mass of the individual drivers all come into play in bumper car collisions.
<br /><br />Thus, the engineers use basic  scientific concepts of acceleration, balanced and unbalanced forces, centripetal force,energy,friction,g,gravitational forces, inertia kinetic energy, potential energy,mass,momentum,Newton’s laws of motion,period,speed,velocity,weight,weightlessness etc to design the magnificent rides which have been giving us amazing experiences for decades now. Many new rides have come up recently and they are equally popular and safe.Thus,amusement park rides use the laws of physics to stimulate danger ,while they are typically safe.Infact,we face a greater threat of injury while playing sports or riding a bike than we do on a park ride.Furthermore,I know it is impossible for children to think about the science behind these rides while they have boarded them and their heart is inside their throat and our stomach is somewhere near their shoes, but they must analyze the physics behind the designing of these rides when they sit back and relax. By doing this they will come to know that learning science in the truest sense of the term is to learn how to implement the laws of science in designing something new and to relate science with the things of our day to day lives.

<br /><br />[PLEASE TELL YOUR FRIENDS
<br /><br />Great thought from wise men of the world....
<br /><br />I Like the first one...
<br /><br />3 Easy Ways to Die :
<br /><br />Take a Cigar daily - You will die 10 years early.
<br /><br />Drink Rum daily - You will die 30 years early..
<br /><br />Love Someone Truly - You will die daily.
<br /><br />1.. A foolish man tells a woman to STOP talking,
<br /><br />but a WISE man tells her that she looks extremely BEAUTIFUL when her LIPS are CLOSED. 
<br /><br />2.. One GOOD way to REDUCE Alcohol consumption :
<br /><br />Before Marriage - Drink whenever you are SAD
<br /><br />After Marriage - Drink whenever you are HAPPY
<br /><br />3. Three FASTEST means of Communication :
<br /><br />1. Tele-Phone
<br /><br />2. Tele-Vision
<br /><br />3. Tell to Woman
<br /><br />still FASTER - Tell her NOT to tell ANYONE.
<br /><br />4. Love your friends not their sisters. Love your sisters not their friends.
<br /><br />5. A man got 2 wishes from GOD. He asked for the Best wine and Best Woman..
<br /><br />Next moment, he had the Best Wine and Mother Teresa next to him.
<br /><br />Moral : BE SPECIFIC
<br /><br />6. Let us be generous like this : Four Ants
<br /><br />are moving through a forest.
<br /><br />They see an ELEPHANT coming towards them.
<br /><br />Ant 1 says : we should KILL him.
<br /><br />Ant 2 says : No, Let us break his Leg alone.
<br /><br />Ant 3 says : No, we will just throw him away from our path.
<br /><br />Ant 4 says : No, we will LEAVE him because he is ALONE and we are FOUR.
<br /><br />7. If you do NOT have a Girl Friend - You are
<br /><br />missing SOME thing in your life. If you HAVE a Girl Friend - You are missing EVERY thing in your life.
<br /><br />8. Question : When do you CONGRATULATE
<br /><br />someone for their MISTAKE..
<br /><br />Answer : On their MARRIAGE.
<br /><br />9. When your LIFE is in DARKNESS, PRAY GOD 
<br /><br />and ask him to free you from Darkness.
<br /><br />Even after you pray, if U R still in Darkness
<br /><br />Please PAY the ELECTRICITY BILL.
<br /><br />10. Why Government do NOT allow a Man to MARRY 2 Women.
<br /><br />Because per Constitution, you can NOT BE
<br /><br />PUNISHED TWICE for the same Mistake

<br /><br />Gujarati Funeral ... 
<br /><br />A family in Gujarat was puzzled when the coffin of their dead mother (Ba) arrived from the US . It was sent by one of the daughters.
<br /><br />The dead body was very tightly squeezed inside the coffin, with no space left in it when they opened the lid; they found a letter on top addressed to her brothers and sisters: 
<br /><br />Dear Chandrakantbhai, Arvindbhai, Smitaben and Varsha,
<br /><br />I am sending Ba's body to you, since it was her wish that she should be cremated in the compound of our ancestral home in GUJARAT .
<br /><br />Sorry, I could not come along as all of my paid leave is consumed. 
<br /><br />You will find inside the coffin, under Ba's body, cans of cheese,
<br /><br />10 packets of Tobler chocolates and 8 packets of Badam (peanuts) please divide these among all of you. 
<br /><br />On Ba's feet you will find a new pair of Reebok shoes (size 10) for Mohan. There are also 2 pairs of shoes for Radha's and Lakshmi's sons. Hope the sizes are correct. 
<br /><br />Ba is wearing 6 American T-Shirts. The large size is for Mohan.
<br /><br />Just distribute the rest among yourselves.
<br /><br />The 2 new Jeans that Ba is wearing are for the boys.
<br /><br />The Swiss watch that Reema wanted is on Ba's left wrist. 
<br /><br />Shanta masi, Ba is wearing the necklace, earrings and ring that you asked for. Please take them off her.
<br /><br />The 6 white cotton socks that Ba is wearing must be divided among my nephews.
<br /><br />Please distribute all these fairly. 
<br /><br />PS : If anything more required let me know soon as Bapuji is also not feeling too well now a days
<br /><br />People will Love you
<br />Hate but LOVE more!
<br />Argue but AGREE more!
<br />Talk but LISTEN more!
<br />Punish but FORGIVE more!
<br />Then you will Love people BUT People will Love you more.
<br /><br />you are not responsible
<br />you are not responsible for what people think about you!
<br />But you are responsible for what you make them to think about you.
<br /><br />good and sad times
<br />Write your sad times in sand
<br />&amp;
<br />write your good times in rocks!
<br /><br />people are great actors
<br />â€˜Donâ€™t assume that someone,
<br />who is always smiling is always happyâ€¦
<br />Because most people are great actors in this worldâ€¦â€™
<br />â€˜William Shakespeareâ€™
<br /><br />True Relation
<br />when someone hurts you and you didnâ€™t hurt back
<br />when someone shouts at you and you didnâ€™t shout back
<br />but
<br />when someone needs you
<br />you always come back
<br /><br />hard job, lazy man
<br />Whenever there is a hard job to be done,
<br />its better to assign it to a lazy man;
<br />he is sure to find an easy way of doing.
<br />- Walter Chrysler-
<br /><br />always keep praying
<br />A busy life makes prayers harder,
<br />But prayers make a hard and busy life easier.
<br />So always keep praying and
<br />remember me  in our prayers.
<br /><br />Times of trouble can be useful. They can show you who you really are, what kind of character you have developed. Troubled times help you grow stronger. Don't complain about your problems. The trouble you face today is training you to be strong in future difficulties. Remember, you are NOT alone unless you choose to be.  
<br /><br />F A M I L Y
<br />I ran into a stranger as he passed by, 
<br />'Oh excuse me please' was my reply. 
<br />He said, 'Please excuse me too;
<br />I wasn't watching for you.'
<br />We were very polite, this stranger and I.
<br />We went on our way and we said goodbye.
<br />But at home a different story is told, 
<br />How we treat our loved ones, young and old.
<br />Later that day, cooking the evening meal,
<br />My son stood beside me very still.
<br />When I turned, I nearly knocked him down.
<br />'Move out of the way,' I said with a frown.
<br />He walked away, his little heart broken.
<br />I didn't realize how harshly I'd spoken.
<br />While I lay awake in bed,
<br />God's still small voice came to me and said,
<br />'While dealing with a stranger, 
<br />common courtesy you use, 
<br />but the family you love, you seem to abuse. 
<br />Go and look on the kitchen floor,
<br />You'll find some flowers there by the door.
<br />Those are the flowers he brought for you.
<br />He picked them himself: pink, yellow and blue.
<br />He stood very quietly not to spoil the surprise,
<br />you never saw the tears that filled his little eyes.'
<br />By this time, I felt very small,
<br />And now my tears began to fall..
<br />I quietly went and knelt by his bed;
<br />'Wake up, little one, wake up,' I said.
<br />'Are these the flowers you picked for me?'
<br />He smiled, 'I found 'em, out by the tree.
<br />I picked 'em because they're pretty like you.
<br />I knew you'd like 'em, especially the blue.'
<br />I said, 'Son, I'm very sorry for the way I acted today; 
<br />I shouldn't have yelled at you that way.'
<br />He said, 'Oh, Mom, that's okay.
<br />I love you anyway.'
<br />I said, 'Son, I love you too,
<br />and I do like the flowers, especially the blue.'
<br />FAMILY 
<br />Are you aware that if we died tomorrow, the company
<br />that we are working for could easily replace us in
<br />a matter of days.
<br />But the family we left behind will feel the loss
<br />for the rest of their lives.
<br />And come to think of it, we pour ourselves more
<br />into work than into our own family, 
<br />an unwise investment indeed,
<br />don't you think?
<br />So what is behind the story?
<br />Do you know what the word FAMILY means?
<br />FAMILY = (F)ATHER (A)ND (M)OTHER (I) (L)OVE (Y)OU
