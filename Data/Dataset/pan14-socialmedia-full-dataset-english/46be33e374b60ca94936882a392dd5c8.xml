<br />His grace is sufficient to meet every need.
<br />How clear this truth is brought into view,
<br />When trials come, and so often they do.
<br />It’s in these times, to Him we flee,
<br />Bowing in submission, on bended knee.
<br />We then become His softened clay,
<br />Ready for molding, as humbly we pray.
<br />Heartache, tragedy, disappointment, and pain,
<br />Are the Potter’s tools for our spiritual gain.
<br />Whatever hardships we encounter each day
<br />Only conform us to His will and way.
<br />Our Lord walks with us, as we go through it all,
<br />Many times carrying us, lest we should fall;
<br />And that truth which we simply believed before,
<br />Now comes into focus even more;
<br />For the written words on the pages we see
<br />Have truly become a reality -
<br />And we know more fully what it’s all about...
<br />God’s Grace Is Sufficient without a doubt !!!

<br />1 Samuel 18:1–3
<br />After David had finished talking with Saul, he met Jonathan, the king’s son. There was an immediate bond between them, for Jonathan loved David.

<br />When the road you're trudging seems all up hill,
<br />When the funds are low and the debts are high,
<br />And you want to smile, but you have to sigh,
<br />When care is pressing you down a bit,
<br />Rest, if you must - but don't you quit.
<br />Life is queer with it's twists and turns,
<br />As every one of us sometimes learns,
<br />And many a failure turns about,
<br />When he might have won had he stuck it out,
<br />Don't give up, though the pace seems slow ..
<br />You might succeed with another blow.
<br />Often the goal is nearer than
<br />It seems to a faint and faltering man.
<br />Often the struggler has given up,
<br />When he might have captured the victor's cup,
<br />And her learned too late, when the night slipped down,
<br />How close he was to the golden crown.
<br />Success is failure turned inside out.
<br />The silver tint to the clouds of doubt -
<br />And you can never tell how close you are,
<br />It mat appear when it seems afar;
<br />So stick to the fight when you're hardest hit -
<br />It when things seem worst that you mustn't quit !

Now it springs up; do you not perceive it? I am making a way in the wilderness  and streams in the wasteland. The wild animals honor me, the jackals and the owls, because I provide water in the wilderness and streams in the wasteland, to give drink to my people, my chosen, the people I formed for myself that they may proclaim my praise.
<br /><br />“Yet you have not called on me, Jacob, you have not wearied yourselves for[a] me, Israel.   You have not brought me sheep for burnt offerings, nor honored me with your sacrifices. I have not burdened you with grain offerings nor wearied you with demands for incense. You have not bought any fragrant calamus for me, or lavished on me the fat of your sacrifices. But you have burdened me with your sins and wearied me with your offenses.
<br /><br />“I, even I, am he who blots out your transgressions, for my own sake, and remembers your sins no more.&quot; Isaiah 43:18-25
<br /><br />God keeps telling us again and again not to remember the former things. This is because you cannot enter God’s destiny for your life if you are a captive of your past, whether that past was full of failures or successes.
<br /><br />When you are bound by what happened yesterday you are afraid to step in today’s opportunities. God says he wants to do a new thing. He will make a way in the wilderness and streams in the desert.
<br /><br />Now, a desert has no life and is a place of torment. In the day it is too hot and dry. At night it is too cold. It is a place of extremes - when you expect relief the relief turns out to be a torment in itself-from extreme heat to extreme cold.
<br /><br />There are some elect people of God for whom life is a constant struggle. I want to encourage you that suffering does not mean you are any less a child of God. On the contrary, if you are always at peace and comfortable, it could be that you have compromised your faith and the world does not fight against you because you are no longer a threat to it.
<br /><br />There are people who are placed in certain situations in life so that they may be noticed and when God sets them free, people give God the glory. A good example is when Jesus healed the man born blind in the Gospel of John. When the Pharisees challenged Jesus to know if the man had been born blind as a result of his or his parents’ sins, Jesus answered, “Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.”John 9:3. Not all pain is because of sin. Not every straying in the desert is caused by sin. May be you are set up for the revelation of God’s glory in your life.
<br /><br />The good news is that God is looking for relief for His people even if they entered the desert because of their own sins. He says, “Do not remember yesterday’s failures. I am the one who blots out your trespasses. The Gospel is designed to bring relief to the afflicted. A poor man who hears the Gospel and believes should come out of poverty. It may not mean the he will get very rich but each man should be able to afford food, clothing and shelter.
<br /><br />But there is a catch. From Verse 22, God enumerates the following reasons why this deliverance has tallied.
<br /><br />Yet you have not called on me……
<br /><br />This means you are not praying for things to happen. I want to tell you, Church, unless you change your attitude about prayer, you will not come out of your situation despite God’s promise of deliverance. The day you begin to pray, God begins to show you the way out of the desert.
<br /><br />quote1 24-07-2011Lack of prayer in a person’s life is pride.This is because pride is an expression of self will that disregards God’s Sovereignty. The level of pride is measured by the level of prayer in your life. This is because a soon as you start praying you admit insufficiency in your ability which translates to humility to God.

<br /><br />Leaven is what is being referred to as yeast, yeast is actually a fungus. When you put it into flour it slowly penetrates to the parts of the dough and as it works it produces carbon dioxide gas which causes the floor to expand.
<br /><br />When you come to the Testament teaching, leaven is a type for sin. That is why Paul tells Corinthians not to celebrate Passover with the old leaven. However, Jesus is not talking about the kingdom of God behaving like sin, He is rather saying that the way leaven works in bread is the same way the kingdom works – slowly. You may not see the effect, and it may not be an explosion, but the word of God works slowly. God does not use explosions. Many times when you see people wanting to use explosion or explosive power or attitudes to solve their problems they are usually carnal. Those who use explosive anger, the Bible call them fools. Proverbs says anger dwells in the bosom of fools.
<br /><br />God works slowly with a lot of wisdom, tolerance, consideration and care and at the end of it the job is done. The word of God works like leaven, so when you are saved the first change may be visible. Sometimes salvation can show in the face of some people. This is especially so with the people previously possessed by demons as their countenance tends to change after deliverance. That is the visible changes of the work of God and the power of God. When someone is saved, you can see the peace, and that reflects in the face. When they were stoning Stephen they saw the face of Stephen as being peaceful. This was because there was peace in him which reflected on the outside
<br /><br />Every time you hear the word of God you change in a certain direction. When you hear the word of God over and over your character will be changed. If you stay in the word for one year there should be a change in your life. That is what the word of God is about.
<br /><br />In 1st Thessalonians chapter 5, the prayer of Paul which is the will of God, is that God should sanctify us wholly. A holistic sanctification is where the spirit, soul and body are sanctified and kept blameless until the coming again of the son of God.
<br /><br />According to the teaching of the word of God, man is actually tripartite where you are a spirit; you have a soul and are locked up in a body that makes you three measures. When you hear the word it actually addresses you as one person and that word is going to affect the three measures of you until all the measures are leaven. That leavening in Matthew is what is called sanctification in the book of Thessalonians.
<br /><br />Some people are just too much amorphous; amorphous is a creature just like an amoeba. This means in spiritual things they tend to be mixed up there is no distinction between the spirit, soul and your body. Such people are totally confused cannot relate with God properly. If this is your condition you will have a problem because there are things which will work well with the soul and others with the spirit and others with the body. No matter what you do to the body, the Bible says flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God. This is the preserve of the spirit.
<br /><br />If the body is destroyed the spirit leaves the body. In the resurrection, there is renovation of the body then the spirit returns. That is why Lazarus died sick and when he resurrected he was healthy because the body had been renewed and the condition that made the spirit leave the body had been reversed. In the same way, Jesus died with his body pierced and nails put through him. However after he resurrected all the pain was gone and he could walk to Emmaus. All those who are saved must live with the hope of resurrection. In resurrection, everything is reversed. No wonder Paul, in the book of Philippians said that he longed that he may know Him and the power of His resurrection.
<br /><br />This separation and reunion of body and spirit helps to illustrate how the various parts are distinct, each having its own role in the life of a believer which should not be mixed up. The word of God working through like leaven helps to maintain that distinction, as it is written, “the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intends of the heart. Hebrews 4:12
<br /><br />The word has got power to divide the soul from the spirit and to pierce into the joints and marrow so that every part is positively affected by the word of God so that you become a balanced person.
<br /><br />Some people who are attracted to nature sometimes go to an extent whereby it becomes what The Bible in the books of Ephesians calls inordinate affection. That is not worship. It is the emotions taken captive by nature which is also un-cleanliness. When Job was trying to reason his things out with God, Job said “Have I ever looked up at the moon and stars and secretly kissed my hand?” Job was affirming that he had not ensnared with the love for nature to the extent that he kissed his hands on their behalf which was idol worship. Those people who are attracted to nature, they need to be sanctified, for they are actually unclean.
<br /><br />The bible divides the essence of a man from the spirit and soul. When you allow emotions to be separated from spiritual duty you are a very sober person. Many times emotions come into the way of the work of God.
<br /><br />First of all as we read in Hebrews, the word divides the soul and spirit enabling us to worship God unhindered by the emotions created from the circumstance we are in. The soul is the seat of emotions while the spirit communes with God in worship. When some people lift up their hands and start pouring tears many times that is not because they are worshipping. Someone may be crying because his or her soul has been troubled. This happens where there is no demarcation between the spirit and the soul. In the book of Habakkuk, the Bible says, “Although the fig tree shall not blossom, neither shall fruit be in the vines; the labour of the olive shall fail, and the fields shall yield no meat; the flock shall be cut off from the fold, and there shall be no herd in the stalls: Yet I will rejoice in the Lord, I will joy in the God of my salvation.” Habakkuk 3:17-18
<br /><br />Habakkuk says even if he loses everything he will still praise the Lord, this is because his spiritual duty is detached completely from how he feels, that is what is called redemption. Some people refuse to go to church on Sunday because they slept without eating and became angry with God. That is a failure in Christianity; the problem is that the word of God had not been allowed to separate the spiritual duty and the emotional part.
<br /><br />When David said “Praise the Lord all my soul and all that is within me,” he had already made a demarcation between himself as the spirit of man and his soul which is also emotional. The problem with Christians today is that emotion comes in the place of duty. That is why we need the word of God which is sharper than any two-edged sword to make a clear demarcation from what is worship and what is not worship. When there is no demarcation between the spirit and the soul you tend to get into a lot of mess.
<br /><br />This is the same reason why today there are very many false prophets. People with little anointing of prophecy, prophesy on the level of emotion.
<br /><br />Lack of division between the soul and spirit has made it difficult for people to forgive each other because if you forgive you let go and not remember the wrong done to you. Forgiveness is spiritual duty and without a clear separation between the spirit and the soul, every time you want to forgive emotion of anger and resentment overtake you and are unable to let go.
<br /><br />There are two levels of sanctification, the first is always being cleansed from sin, and the other is being set a part. All those who get saved and God tells them to leave what they are doing and go and serve Him.
<br /><br />The second one which is being set a part can’t work if you are not sanctified from sin. There is nobody who is more anointed than the other, what differs is the measure of grace to do something. It’s like a teller and a bank manager, when theft occurs even though they are of different ranks they will undergo similar prosecution. That is how God deals with us - if you are given more God will demand more from you. No one is greater than the other what matters is the measure of grace.
<br /><br />Finally, the word also goes between bones and marrow. When you hear the word of God and believe it, the word is converted into spiritual power and stored in the borne marrow. This was seen when they threw a dead person in the grave of Elisha. The scripture testifies that when the dead man touched the bones of Elisha he came to life and Elisha remained dead. What was so special about the bones of Elisha? The bones of Elisha had accumulated the life power of the word.

<br /><br />When heart is heavy and body weary
<br /><br />And no one's there to lend a hand
<br /><br />And no one seems to understand
<br /><br />How lost and lonely we may be
<br /><br />With no relief that we can see
<br /><br />But we forget we have a friend
<br /><br />Who'll be there with us to the end
<br /><br />Who lifts us from the state we're in
<br /><br />And fills our hearts with hope again
<br /><br />Reminding us that when we pray
<br /><br />All our cares can fade away
<br /><br />For fervent prayer a new hope wins
<br /><br />And hides a multitude of sins

<br /><br />Today, I'm going to celebrate what an unbelievable life I have had so far: the accomplishments, the many blessings, and, yes, even the hardships because they have served to make me stronger.
<br /><br />I will go through this day with my head held high, and a happy heart. I will marvel at God's seemingly simple gifts: the morning dew, the sun, the clouds, the trees, the flowers, the birds. Today, none of these miraculous creations will escape my notice.
<br /><br />Today, I will share my excitement for life with other people. I'll make someone smile. I'll go out of my way to perform an unexpected act of kindness for someone I don't even know.
<br /><br />Today, I'll give a sincere compliment to someone who seems down. I'll tell a child how special he is, and I'll tell someone I love just how deeply I care for  him and how much  he  means to me.
<br /><br />Today is the day I quit worrying about what I don't have and start being grateful for all the wonderful things God has already given me.
<br /><br />I'll remember that to worry is just a waste of time because my faith in God and his Divine Plan ensures everything will be just fine.
<br /><br />And tonight, before I go to bed, I'll go outside and raise my eyes to the heavens. I will stand in awe at the beauty of the stars and the moon, and I will praise God for these magnificent treasures.
<br /><br />As the day ends and I lay my head down on my pillow, I will thank the Almighty for the best day of my life. And I will sleep the sleep of a contented child, excited with expectation because know tomorrow is going to be the best day of my life, ever!

<br />Perched on my home made bed
<br />I watched with envy while others eat
<br />And had no say over it
<br />Far from harsh words and beatings of that intolerable mother.
<br /><br />Oh! Lost my mother lost my father
<br />Beneath my legs, cold strikes in
<br />The everlasting night
<br />Beatings ,beatings until I faint
<br />In the house where there is no peace
<br />Through many days of passing hell.
<br />My heart burns.

<br /><br />Aids oh aids
<br />Like a wirl wind you pass
<br />No one talks a bout it
<br />Both young and old you take away
<br />And always thirsty for more.
<br /><br />Every thing ------
<br />Anything human flesh you happen to lay your hands
<br /><br />You devour mercilessly
<br />If only you could be like a ball to be kicked in the field to score the goal.
<br /><br />Bread winners are now gone
<br />Children left as orphans
<br />Homeless--------
<br /><br />On the streets they beg
<br />No food no cloths
<br />Worthless-----------
<br />With nobody to care for them.
<br /><br />Like donkeys orphans work
<br />Carrying the burden never meant to be carried
<br />Bearing penalty for sin never committed
<br /><br />You sweep all
<br />If only you could be a ball to be kicked in the field to score the goal.

<br /><br />I stand in the open, because I have no fear.
<br />I want to tell those who have eyes
<br />The covenant they put those who have eyes.
<br />Let us give hope for those suffering from AIDS
<br /><br />I speak with pain, for what struck my heart passed besides my brothers, I heard them say
<br />I cannot eat together, those affected with Aids
<br />Let us give hope to those suffering from AIDS
<br /><br />Aids do not discriminate, both young and old.
<br />Used razor blades dangerous to use.
<br />Fresh blood touched supplies the virus
<br />Those infected pass through pain
<br />Let us give hope for those suffering from AIDS
<br /><br />Reaching the end, tears flow my chick
<br />Thinking of the population which have already left us
<br />Hear me my brothers, hear me my sisters
<br />Stay put from risky behaviors
<br />Let us give hope for those suffering from AIDS.
