<br /><br />Mommy.. Johnny brought a gun to school,
<br />He told his friends that it was cool,
<br />And when he pulled the trigger back,
<br />It shot with a great crack.
<br />Mommy, I was a good girl, I did What I was told,
<br />I went to school, I got straight A's, I even got the gold!
<br />But Mommy, when I went to school that day,
<br />I never said good-bye,
<br />I'm sorry Mommy, I had to go, But Mommy, please don't cry.
<br />When Johnny shot the gun, He hit me and another,
<br />And all because Johnny, Got the gun from his older brother.
<br />Mommy, please tell Daddy; That I love him very much,
<br />And please tell Trevor; my boyfriend; That it wasn't just a crush.
<br />And tell my little sister; That she is the only one now,
<br />And tell my dear sweet grandmother; I'll be waiting for her now,
<br />And tell my wonderful friends; That they always were the best;
<br />Mommy, I'm not the first, I'm no better than the rest.
<br />Mommy, tell my teachers; I won't show up for class,
<br />And never to forget this, And please don't let this pass.
<br />Mommy, why'd it have to be me? No one deserves this,
<br />Mommy, warn the others, Mommy I left without a kiss.
<br />And Mommy tell the doctors; I know they really did try,
<br />I think I even saw a doctor, Trying not to cry.
<br />Mommy, I'm slowly dying, With a bullet in my chest,
<br />But Mommy please remember, I'm in heaven with the rest.
<br />Mommy I ran as fast as I could,
<br />When I heard that crack, Mommy, listen to me if you would,
<br />I wanted to go to college, I wanted to try things that were new,
<br />I guess I'm not going with Daddy, On that trip to the new zoo.
<br />I wanted to get married, I wanted to have a kid,
<br />I wanted to be an actress, Mommy, I wanted to live.
<br />But Mommy I must go now, The time is getting late,
<br />Mommy, tell my Trevor, I'm sorry but I had to cancel the date.
<br />I love you Mommy, I always have, I know; you know it's true,
<br />And Mommy all I wanted to say is, &quot;Mommy, I love you.&quot;
<br /><br />****In Loving Memory of The Columbine Students Who Were Lost****
<br /><br />Please if you would,
<br />Pass this around,
<br />I'd be happy if you could,
<br />If you pass this on,
<br />Maybe people will cry,
<br />Just keep this in your heart,
<br />For the people who didn't get to say &quot;Good-bye&quot;.
<br /><br />Now you have 2 choices,
<br /><br />1) Pass this on, and show people you care, repost as &quot;Try Not To Cry&quot;
