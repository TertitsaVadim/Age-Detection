He took out a jar of yellow liquid. &quot;This,&quot; he explained, &quot;is urine. To be a doctor, you have to be observant of color, smell, sight, and taste.&quot; 
<br /><br />After saying so, he dipped his finger into the jar and put it into his mouth. His class watched in amazement, most in disgust. But being
<br />the good students that they were, the jar was passed, and one by one, they dipped their finger into the jar and put it into their mouths. 
<br /><br />After the last student was done, the lecturer shook his head. &quot;If any of you had been observant, you would have noticed that I put my second finger into the jar and my third finger into my mouth.&quot;

<br /><br />The florist's son handed her a gift. She shook it, held it overhead, and said, &quot;I bet I know what it is. Some flowers.&quot; &quot;That's right&quot; the boy said, &quot;but how did you know?&quot; &quot;Oh, just a wild guess,&quot; she said. 
<br /><br />The next pupil was the candy shop owner's daughter. The teacher held her gift overhead, shook it, and said, &quot;I bet I can guess what it is. A box of sweets.&quot; &quot;That's right, but how did you know?&quot; asked the girl. &quot;Oh, just a wild guess,&quot; said the teacher. 
<br /><br />The next gift was from the son of the liquor store owner. The teacher held the package overhead, but it was leaking. She touched a drop of the leakage with her finger and touched it to her tongue. &quot;Is it wine?&quot; she asked. &quot;No,&quot; the boy replied, with some excitement. 
<br /><br />The teacher repeated the process, taking a larger drop of the leakage to her tongue. &quot;Is it champagne?&quot; she asked. &quot;No,&quot; the boy replied, with more excitement. 
<br /><br />The teacher took one more taste before declaring, &quot;I give up, what is it?&quot; With great glee, the boy replied, &quot;It's a puppy!&quot;

<br /><br />He said to the doctor, &quot;I think my wife is deaf because she never hears me the first time and always asks me to repeat things.&quot; 
<br /><br />&quot;Well,&quot; the doctor replied, &quot;go home tonight, stand about 15 feet from her, and say something. If she doesn't reply, move 5 feet closer and say it again. Keep doing this until we get an idea about the severity of her deafness.&quot; 
<br /><br />The husband went home and did exactly as the doctor had instructed. He started off 15 feet from his wife in the kitchen as she was chopping some vegetables. 
<br /><br />He said, &quot;Honey, what's for dinner?&quot; 
<br /><br />He heard no response. He moved 5 feet closer and asked again. No reply. He moved 5 feet closer. Still no reply. 
<br /><br />He finally got fed up and moved right behind her, about an inch away, and asked again, &quot;Honey, what's for dinner?&quot; 
<br /><br />She replied, &quot;For the fourth time, vegetable stew!&quot;

<br /><br />&quot;There might be some matches in the top drawer,&quot; she replied.
<br /><br />He opened the drawer of the bedside table and found a box of matches sitting neatly on top of a framed picture of another man. Naturally, the guy began to worry.
<br /><br />&quot;Is this your husband?&quot; he inquired nervously.
<br /><br />&quot;No, silly,&quot; she replied, snuggling up to him.
<br /><br />&quot;Your boyfriend then?&quot; he asked.
<br /><br />&quot;No, not at all,&quot; she said, nibbling away at his ear.
<br /><br />&quot;Well, who is he then?&quot; demanded the bewildered guy.
<br /><br />Calmly, Tony replied, &quot;That's me before the operation.&quot;

<br /><br />&quot;Oh, that,&quot; Frank said. &quot;Every time I cheated on you, I put an egg in this box.&quot; Sue was a bit unhappy about this, but figured that 3 affairs over twenty years wasn't so bad. 
<br /><br />&quot;But what about the 10,000 dollars?&quot; 
<br /><br />&quot;Every time I got a dozen, I sold them.&quot;

His wife glares at him and says, &quot;Who was that??!!&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;Oh&quot; replies the husband, &quot;that was my mistress.&quot; &quot;That's it,&quot; says the wife, &quot;I want a divorce.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;Ok,&quot; replies her husband, &quot;but remember, if you get a divorce there will be no more shopping trips to Paris, no wintering in the Caribbean, no Lexus in the garage, and no more country club. But, the decision is yours.&quot;
<br /><br />Just then the wife notices a mutual friend entering the restaurant with a gorgeous woman. &quot;Who is that woman with Jim?&quot; she asks.
<br /><br />&quot;That's his mistress,&quot; replies her husband. &quot;Ours is much better looking.&quot; says the wife.

The old lady pulled the doctor to the side and said, &quot;Doctor, I haven't had sex for years now, and I was wondering how I can increase my husband's sex drive.&quot; 
<br /><br />The doctor smiled and said, &quot;Have you tried to give him Viagra?&quot; 
<br /><br />The lady frowned. &quot;Doctor, I can't even get him to take aspirin when he has a headache,&quot; she claimed. 
<br /><br />&quot;Well,&quot; the doctor continued, &quot;let me suggest something. Crush the Viagra into a powder. When you are giving him coffee, stir it into the coffee and serve it. He won't notice a thing.&quot; 
<br /><br />The old lady was delighted. She left the doctor's office quickly. 
<br /><br />Weeks later the old lady returned. She was frowning and the doctor asked her what was wrong. She shook her head. 
<br /><br />&quot;How did it go?&quot; the doctor asked. 
<br /><br />&quot;Terribly, doctor, terribly.&quot; 
<br /><br />&quot;Did it not work?&quot; 
<br /><br />&quot;Yes,&quot; the old lady said, &quot;It worked. I did as you said and he got up and ripped his clothes off right then and there and we made mad love on the table. It was the best sex that I'd had in 25 years.&quot; 
<br /><br />&quot;Then what is the problem, ma'am?&quot; 
<br /><br />&quot;Well,&quot; she said. &quot;I can't ever show my face in McDonald's again.&quot;

<br /><br />His friend offered, &quot;Don't do that. There's a computer at the drug store that can diagnose anything quicker and cheaper than a doctor. Simply put in a sample of your urine and the computer will diagnose your problem and tell you what you can do about it. It only costs $10.&quot;
<br /><br />Bill figured he had nothing to lose, so he filled a jar with a urine sample and went to the drug store. Finding the computer, he poured in the sample and deposited the $10. The computer started making some noise and various lights started flashing. After a brief pause out popped a small slip of paper on which was printed: You have tennis elbow. Soak your arm in warm water. Avoid heavy lifting. It will be better in two weeks.
<br /><br />Late that evening while thinking how amazing this new technology was and how it would change medical science forever, he began to wonder if this machine could be fooled. He decided to give it a try. He mixed together some tap water, a stool sample from his dog and urine samples from his wife and daughter. To top it off, he masturbated into the concoction. 
<br /><br />He went back to the drug store, located the machine, poured in the sample and deposited the $10. The computer again made the usual noise and printed out the following message: 
<br /><br />Your tap water is too hard. Get a water softener. Your dog has worms. Get him vitamins. Your daughter is using cocaine. Put her in a rehabilitation clinic. Your wife is pregnant with twin girls. They aren't yours. Get a lawyer. And if you don't stop jerking off, your tennis elbow will never get better.

<br /><br />Not wanting to wake his wife, he undressed in the dark, crept into the bedroom and started to climb into bed. She sleepily sat up and said, &quot;Mike, dearest, would you go down to the all-night drug store on the next block and get me some aspirin? I've got a splitting headache.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;Certainly, honey,&quot; he said, and feeling his way across the room, he got dressed and walked over to the drug store.
<br /><br />As he arrived, the pharmacist looked up in surprise, &quot;Say,&quot; said the druggist, &quot;aren't you Officer Fenwick of the 8th District?&quot;
