There are a variety of different products you can use to keep your lake looking fresh, clean, and pure at all times. Some of these products can be used year-round, while some of the other products on the market are designed to be used solely during the hottest months of the year when algae blooms are most likely to occur.<br /><br />One of the most effective methods lake owners can use to keep their lakes looking clean year round is lake aerators. Lake aerators can be incredibly effective tools to keep your lake looking fresh and clean year round, because they can completely stop any algae blooms that may be present within a body of water. By increasing the availability of oxygen within water, algae blooms and other unwanted growths are hindered as a result.<br /><br />There are three different types of aerators you can purchase today. You can either have a waterfall installed in your lake, a fountain installed, or you can have an aerator system installed on the bottom of the water you are managing. All of these different methods can be very effective in reducing the amount of algae growth that occurs in water.<br /><br />Aerators that are installed on the floor of a lake are often believed to be the most effective systems available, because they add to the oxygen deposits that are present in the body of water they reside in. Waterfalls on the other hand only add oxygen to the parts of the lake they are closest to. Fountains suffer from the same drawbacks, because they generally only add oxygen to the surface of a pond or lake. I found that this blogger showed this well on this  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fbikereviewshack.com%2F611%2Fhighest-mileage-youve-motorcyling%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://bikereviewshack.com/611/highest-mileage-youve-motorcyling/</a>  web post.<br /><br />Of course, introducing a new aerator into your pond may not be the only water management tactic you need to implement to keep it clean and attractive. Other methods you might want to take advantage of to make your water more attractive include lake dye and beneficial bacteria.<br /><br />Lake dye can be a great addition to any kinds of water, because these products can greatly reduce the growth of algae blooms that occur within it. These products can also be incredibly useful, because they can increase the crispness and clarity of water as well. Along with performing all of these tasks, they can also give a lake a more attractive appearance and make it much more appealing to the senses overall.<br /><br />Beneficial bacteria can also be used to remove muck and grime from a body of water. Fish, falling leaves, and an assortment of other factors can dramatically alter the appearance and cleanliness of a pond or lake. By introducing beneficial bacteria into your pond, you can greatly reduce the amount of grime and muck that is present within your water.<br /><br />If you want to keep your lake or pond clean year-round, and you also want to make your water appealing to people who want to go swimming, you will certainly improve the quality of your lake or pond by introducing an aerator, lake dyes, and beneficial bacteria into your water today. Once you add these lake treatment products to your water, the water will be much more attractive, crisper, and cleaner throughout.

Regardless of a false initiation, this form of marketing has done well and made its way to achieve the best for itself and is a hit amongst marketing professionals who desire making use of this means for firms and associations. The Net is one interactive and informative medium that is far better than telephone than it had been assumed. It could be said that anything that looks less like an advertisement has better chances of being liked by all and accordingly the response can be seen from prospective people. Some of the names have well understood the secret and this why all this while they enjoyed ample level profits for their firms. With a lot of evaluation it was learnt that there are certain things that make a difference in making this mode of marketing, effective. It does make sense that if people are supposedly looking for branded clothing and if they come across a banner ad that is about a clothing house that has all the brands at one place then it is likely that they would click on the ad. Such ads could as well be in flash or animated.<br /><br />These symbol ads which are static have their own importance. Web based business' image could be efficiently made impressive if such a type is used. For a website promotion, a tool could be used as it would be capable at generating business and it is clear that if your advertisement gets highly exposed then more people will see it and therefore you have better chances of profits. When these promotions are aptly targeted at the right consumer group, you would be able to see the needed results for yourself. Evaluations have told that these promotions are meant to gel-well into sites and look a part of the content provided so that without making it obvious the main goal to increase sales can be attained.

For many working class people, stress is a part of daily life. Eating is a necessary evil, but pairing the two can be problematic to your weight.<br /><br />When you are stressed, the hormone Cortisol can cause your body to crave snack foods more. The urge to consume carbohydrates- such as cakes, candy or chips- can suppress your intake of healthy, low calorie foods such as fruits and vegetables. Your regular eating patterns can also be thrown off by unnecessary snacking.<br /><br />How can you avoid the personal sabotage to your healthy lifestyle? There are several ways to identify and combat stress eating, or any other kind of emotional eating for that matter.<br /><br />Start by having a good nutritional foundation in the first place. By eating right on a regular basis, your body is better prepared for handling stress and keeping your emotions in balance. Even when affected by stress, if you are well educated and used to making healthy food choices, you are less likely to let your emotions come in the way of your decision making. I found that this website described this incredibly on this  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Felectronicdrumkitreview.com%2Fhomework-games-ideas%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://electronicdrumkitreview.com/homework-games-ideas/</a>  web post.<br /><br />Instead of reaching for a simple carbohydrate (things with lots of sugar), satisfy your carbohydrate craving with a whole grain or something with a lot of fiber. Complex carbohydrates fill you up more and keep you full for longer, so you are less likely to over consume calories. Also, since complex carbohydrates are digested slower, you won't experience the mood swings that come with a sharp increase in blood sugar followed by a crash. If you are already stressed by outside sources, don't let your eating habits make the problem worse.<br /><br />Have a snack handy. When you know you're going to be in a stressful situation or on a time crunch, come prepared! Stress hunger can hit fast, so always have a healthy snack available. When you are emotional AND hungry, you are more likely to make a poor food choice, so don't get caught without a plan. Some good snack ideas are pretzels, fruit, peanut butter crackers, baked chips, whole wheat goldfish, or carrot sticks. When you already have a snack, why do you need to go to the vending machine and get a candy bar?<br /><br />Having your temptations in sight can have a huge psychosomatic effect on hunger. Hide the foods you crave most of the time. Purchase cookies less or instead of having six flavors of ice-cream, have one at a time in your freezer. Try putting the soda on the top shelf of your pantry so your kids don't automatically see it.<br /><br />Stress eating is not something anyone can cut out all together. It is a way we handle our ever quickening world. Just be aware of what is going on and keep in mind these few changes you can make to create a healthier atmosphere for yourself.

Interestingly enough, they have been used in Chinese medicine to treat anxiety and depression, as well as the common cold. Part of the coffee family, the gardenia fragrance has a blissful effect on those who purchase and cultivate them. The name literally means, &quot;garden flower.&quot;<br /><br />Occasions which most often call for gardenias are weddings and Mother's Day. They are symbolic of secret love, purity, joy, femininity, and artistic talent. In weddings, gardenias are often woven together into a bracelet or bouquet. Many also pin them to garments for a Victorian feel.<br /><br />For Mother's Day, gardenias are symbolic of the spirit of motherhood, and are pinned or worn as a corsage for daughters whose mothers have passed away. In this case, the flower represents the spirit, femininity, and grace of our ancestors.<br /><br />To receive a gardenia as a gift may represent a secret admirer telling you that, &quot;you are lovely.&quot; Certainly the gardenia--with its fragrance and beauty--easily represents that which is lovely.<br /><br />A basic gardenia is easy to make out of gum paste. Kids can enjoy making them as well as adults.<br /><br />To make a gum paste gardenia, you will need:<br /><br />A flower cookie cutter<br />Waxed paper<br />A knife or pizza cutter<br />A v-shaped glass<br /><br />Steps to make a gum paste gardenia:<br /><br />Roll out gum paste and cut out a basic pattern with your floral cookie cutter. The floral cookie cutter I use has ten petals around the outside, but this is not required.<br /><br />Slice inward toward the center of the flower with a knife or pizza cutter. These slices should be small to keep the center of the flower intact.<br /><br />Line a v-shaped glass with waxed paper. Rest your floral cut-out in the v-shaped glass. I found that this webpage described this nicely on this  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Felectronicdrumkitreview.com%2Fkill-director-drum-music-wombats%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://electronicdrumkitreview.com/kill-director-drum-music-wombats/</a>  post.<br /><br />Roll out additional gum paste and use your floral cookie cutter again. This time, slice your cut-out in half. Slice inward once again, this time producing a series of three small hearts.<br /><br />Press two hearts into the center of your flower. Then, press the final heart into the center of those petals.<br /><br />Pinch the edge of the petals to give a more delicate look. Allow your flower to dry, then, place on top of a cake or cupcake.<br /><br />Gardenias are white, but there is no reason why you could not branch out and make them different colors in making them with your kids. They look very much like a flattened rose. To make a rose, use a v-shaped glass that is smaller and steeper.<br /><br />Your kids will love how easy it is to make these flowers, you will love how beautiful they look on a cake!

There are lots of options to consider when planning your vacation and they may seem overwhelming. A good starting point might be to think about how you are planning to arrive in this tropical paradise. Since Hawaii is, after all, an island there are only two ways to get there: by sea or by air. When calculating time from California, your choice is between five hours in the air or five days by sea. Now, I know there's a big difference in time, but a Hawaii cruise might be just the excitement and relaxation you're looking for. I found that this blog demonstrated this simply on this  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Faskdatingexperts.com%2F695%2F23-yr-guy-ask-questions%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://askdatingexperts.com/695/23-yr-guy-ask-questions/</a>   web page.<br /><br />Depending on your preference of travel, a Hawaii cruise might sound much more appealing to you than traveling by plane. It is inevitable that every time you step onto an airplane, even if you did pay top dollar for first class, you find yourself in an overcrowded area, in close quarters with several hundred people, many who are possibly ill.<br /><br />You probably do everything you can, short of jump off the plane, to pass the grueling five hours. Then once you're off the plane you spend another hour or more enduring airport security and looking for your luggage before you even begin the trip to your hotel. Wow, doesn't sound like a great way to start a relaxing vacation. And just think, you get to do it all over again at the end of your trip, too.<br /><br />Now, visualize yourself heading to your departure point and arriving right at your hotel. No long security lines, no crowded planes. When you travel by ship on a Hawaii cruise it's just like checking into your hotel and relaxing while you head to your destination. You can put your luggage in your room and head straight to the pool deck, enjoy a cocktail, and spend the first five hours of your vacation basking in the tropical sun rather than dodging someone else's germs.<br /><br />When it comes down to it there's really no comparison. I know I would much rather spend my vacation to Hawaii relaxing on a cruise ship than wasting it in an airport. You will return home relaxed and calm from a week of pampering and luxury instead of stressed to the max from a long flight. The choice is yours, spend you days and nights in a luxurious room, enjoying delicious meals on a cruise ship of your preference, and you will truly enjoy your getaway to the paradise of the Hawaiian islands.

In 93% of those 1 in 60, it will only ever happen once. In the unfortunate 7% it can recur at an average frequency of around 10 years.<br /><br />It is usually a temporary facial palsy condition, causing paralysis of one side of the face. In around 1% of cases, including my own, it can strike both sides of the face at the same time (bilateral bell's palsy) leaving a person with no facial expression whatsoever and in no uncertain terms, truly &quot;wiping the smile off your face&quot;.<br /><br />In 50% of cases all of the facial paralysis will disappear within 3 months. In 20% this will take up to 6 months and in another 10% it may take up to a year to achieve a complete recovery..&quot;And what becomes of the other 20%?&quot; I hear you shout...<br /><br />The healing of the seventh cranial nerve, also known as the facial nerve, can continue at the rate of about 0.5 - 1mm per day for up to around 18 months and some consultants would say up to 2 years.<br /><br />After this time, it may be necessary to employ the services of a professional facial muscle trainer to &quot;retrain&quot; your facial muscles to work in their originally intended way. This training can take the form of manual Bell's Palsy facial exercises or in some cases the use of an electrical stimulator, both of which can produce major improvements many years after the facial paralysis.<br /><br />There are other treatments such as Botox injections and decompression surgery, that some suggest can alleviate long term symptoms such as synkenisis. Synkenisis is best described as remnants of facial paralysis or incorrect rejuvenation of the facial nerve, resulting in movements that are contrary to what was intended. In practical terms this may show as the corners of your mouth raising upon the closing of your eyelids; this being just one of a great many possible scenarios.<br /><br />A number of medical consultants hold the belief that Bell's Palsy is an illness with no known cause. In fact there are over 50 different illnesses that can cause facial paralysis and it is only when these have been ruled out that a diagnosis of Bell's Palsy is comfortably arrived at. Thus it is known as an idiopathic facial palsy, meaning &quot;of unknown cause&quot;.<br /><br />The most prevalent medical belief however, is that it is the reactivation of the herpes simplex virus (HSV 1) that is the cause of the illness. This is not the sexually transmitted herpes, this is the one that gives you the odd cold sore.<br /><br />It must also be said here that just because you get cold sores, that does not in any way whatsoever, mean that you will get Bell's Palsy. On the contrary, I have still never had a cold sore in my life and yet had bilateral Bell's Palsy. So, there is no more reason to worry about getting suddenly being stricken with Bell's palsy, than there is about losing another pound, dollar or euro on the weekly lottery.<br /><br />The herpes simplex virus is seldom of any medical importance and as stated, is most commonly associated with cold sores. Your immune system usually cures it extremely well if ever it tries to show up.<br /><br />Most of us do actually carry this virus around with us throughout our lives. 25% of people will never know they have it and never show any symptoms. 50% of people will have very mild symptoms at some point in life (not of Bell's Palsy) and 25% may be diagnosed with it upon showing some noticeable symptoms (but again, not Bell's Palsy).<br /><br />When we initially contracted the virus through normal human contact as a child we may have shown no significant symptoms at all. However, once contracted, the virus remains with us in a dormant state until it can be reactivated by some future event or when we are particularly run down and our immune system has been weakened.<br /><br />Without going into all of the medical terms, the resultant reactivation of the virus to cause &lt;a target=&quot;_new&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fbellspalsybook.allbellspalsy.info"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://bellspalsybook.allbellspalsy.info</a>]Bell's Palsy[/url], means that the virus has been dormantly awaiting its moment of glory on our seventh cranial nerve and upon reactivation, causes it to inflame.<br /><br />The seventh cranial nerve, on its way to the facial muscles, passes through the fallopian canal, a thin bony conduit in the ear area. Because of the inflammation to the nerve, when it is in the fallopian canal it can only inflame so much before it is in effect, crushing itself.<br /><br />It is when this happens that the &quot;crushing&quot; effect stifles its ability to transmit the impulses that are required to activate the facial muscles and achieve facial expression and therefore, a paralysis of the facial expressions on the affected side are apparent.<br /><br />Now, that being the most prevalent theory, the herpes simplex virus has been noticed as present in 60-70% of those who are diagnosed with Bell's Palsy. As early as 1970, a study by researcher Shingo Murakami identified HSV-1 as the primary cause of Bell's palsy and several subsequent studies have consistently verified Murakami's research.<br /><br />So, if we accept all of the above theory as being correct (and I would like to ask the obvious question about the other 30 - 40% who did not have HSV-1 present) then it is the virus that has caused the actual inflammation but surely, to be able to reactivate in the first place it must have taken advantage of our physical state.<br /><br />If our immune system has been perfectly capable of keeping this virus at bay since we were a child, then what has and could, allow this virus to manifest its reactivation within us, in such a way as to cause an outbreak of this fashion.<br /><br />It is therefore, to our immune system that we must look for the answers.<br /><br />A perfectly healthy immune system would quite happily take care of this virus' control and restraint. Therefore it must follow that for it to break out of its cell (excuse the pun) and wreak havoc with our facial nerve, the alarm bells must draw us to the conclusion of a weak immune system at the time of the breakout.<br /><br />So what depletes the strength of our immune system?<br /><br />Our immune system is fuelled by the good foods and drink with which we nourish ourselves. It is aided by the sunshine and fresh air in which we bathe and breath and it is also strengthened by keeping our physical health in good order, our weight reasonable and by trying to keep a positive, calm and unworried mental outlook.<br /><br />Conversely, it is compromised by a lack of the aforementioned good fuels, by illness, stress, sugar (I kid you not) and by being generally run down.<br /><br />I myself, although not suffering from any illness prior to having bilateral Bell's Palsy, would definitely agree with the other components to making my immune system extremely low, stress being the main cause of each.<br /><br />I was working too hard in a thankless job whilst not looking after myself properly in the food department, due either a lack of self esteem, extreme tiredness, or a feeling that there was not enough time to devote to this eating pastime. All of which are symptomatic of being very stressed.<br /><br />The doctor who first diagnosed me, when I had only one side of my face paralysed, gave me a prescription which, on top of the medicinal components, advised total rest, relaxation and rejuvenation.<br /><br />Having the condition for over 4 years, I have spoken to a great deal of fellow sufferers. Every single one of them truly believes that it was a build up of severe stress or in some cases a severely stressful event, that preceded their Bell's Palsy.<br /><br />Most of these people, including myself, have taken a philosophical view of the entire event and had a really good look at our lives. I mean, if you cannot even count on your own smile, then one must search for some truths that you can indeed count upon. It is most certainly an experience that will change you entire life, and for the better, if you want it to.<br /><br />Although it can be said with total conviction that stress reduces our immune systems and that a positive and calm mental outlook can actually boost our immune system's health and responsiveness, it is always a reactive and medicinal solution that is prescribed. I found that this site showed this nicely on this <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2RzbHJjYW1lcmFyZXZpZXdlci5jb20vY2FtZXJhLW5pa29uLWQ2MC1uaWtvbi04MC1jYW5vbi1lb3MtNTAwZC01NTBkLw__" target="_blank">Edris Mazingo</a>  web page.<br /><br />More importance should be placed on the preventative skills needed to live our lives with the awareness of stress and its early symptoms, rather than to try to correct the resultant illnesses that it will nearly always produce.<br /><br />It is a known fact that between 80 - 90% of attendees at doctors' surgeries are there with a condition or problem that has its foundations firmly rooted in a build up of stress.<br /><br />Is it therefore the herpes simplex virus (HSV-1) or for that matter, any other virus, infection or malady, that has caused the resultant complaint, or is it the tightening grip of the tentacles of stress upon our lives and therefore our physical immunity, that has forced the condition?<br /><br />There apparently is no proven cure or protection from Bell's Palsy. Time, rest and relaxation are the only widely accepted cures.<br /><br />I suggest that the instructions &quot;To lead a life with a positive, calm and unworried mental outlook, focussed upon hope, derived from a truth that can be counted upon&quot; should be folded into a bottle and sold as the preventative medicine for all ailments, in chemists, churches, hospitals, schools and even the workplace vending machine.<br /><br />I hope that you will always have a special smile and that it will always be special, to all who have the pleasure of seeing it.

The name &quot;slinky loops&quot; comes from the shape that is created when the tubing is tied into concentric coils. The purpose of this procedure is to make the long lengths of pipe more manageable during installation and to be able to construct a consistent heat exchanger in a given amount of space. Not all horizontal closed loop systems are constructed in the slinky method, some just lay out the pipe in a down and back layout.<br /><br />A slinky is most easily constructed by using a jig made out of plywood with edges to contain the tubing. Measured marks can be drawn onto the jig to give you a reference point for sizing the overlap (pitch) of the slinky as you build it. It will take three people to most effectively build a slink. One will do the tying, one will feed the coils to the one doing the tying, and one will pull the slinky along out the back of the jig as it is built. It will take three people approx. 20 min to tie an 800' slinky once they are up and rolling.<br /><br />The first step is to determine how long of a slinky you need to build based on the loop field design. A chart that shows the lengths of slinky coils based on tube length, pitch of coils, and diameter of coils can be found here. A length of tubing will be pulled off the roll that is the needed length to be the return from the very end of the coil back to where the manifold will be; this portion will be straight. Once this is pulled off the coil you can begin tying the tubing into loops. I found that this site described this smartly on this <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3BsZWFzZWFza2l0LmNvbS8yNzQ0L21zbi1yZXRpZXZlLW1zbi1oaXN0b3J5LWxvZy1sb2dzLXNhdmVkLWNvbXB1dGVyLw__" target="_blank">Refugio Minner</a> page.<br /><br />The first loop will be tied into whatever diameter you made the jig (36&quot; is good). The second loop will be laid over the first loop by whatever pitch is needed to make your total length work. For example if you have a 36&quot; coil with a 18&quot; pitch you would lay each coil approximately half over the one in front of it. It your length called for 36&quot; loops with 36&quot; pitch you would not overlap them at all but simply place each loop end to end as you tie the coil. Plastic zip ties are the preferred product for tying the loops.<br /><br />When you get near the end be sure to leave enough left untied to make it back to the manifold location. The first part of the coil that was left uncoiled can now be tied along the coil as it makes it's way back to the &quot;front&quot; of the coil. Both ends should now be close to equal distance from the loops and both at the front of the coil where you will build the manifold. Tape the ends of the pipe to keep dirt out if they don't already have caps.<br /><br />The final step is rolling the slinky into a donut roll which will actually resemble more of a giant birds nest but will in fact be fairly manageable and transportable. Simply start at the &quot;end&quot; (not the &quot;front&quot; where the lines are) and roll the thing up. Try to keep it as in line as possible when rolling it up.<br /><br />The slinky is now ready for transport. It will take two people to carry it due to both weight and shape. It can be transported in a truck of trailer to the job site if you built it elsewhere. Once onsite carry it to the trench or pit where it will spend its life and unroll it. If it is going in a trench I would suggest unrolling it besides the trench at the top and then with several people throw it into the trench. Be sure that the coil lays flat in the bottom of the trench but be careful if entering trenches that could collapse. The safer way would be to use a long pole to situate the slinky as needed.<br /><br />When bedding the loop field be sure the fill material is sufficient to provide good contact with the pipe without leaving air gaps and be sure that big rocks are not dropped on the pipe. In rocky soil screening the soil and bedding the pipe in two feet of fines is recommended. After proper bedding the tubing the rest of the back filling can be done and the area compacted.

From mind-blank comedies, to meaningful funny movies, you can enjoy them anytime of the day to get a laugh. And laughter is the best medicine to forget all worries.<br /><br />Here is the list of my selected top ten best comedy movies of all time:<br /><br />Ace Ventura Pet Detective:<br /><br />This is often rated as the most hilarious and most mind-blank comedy movie of all time. This Jim Carrey flick enabled him to gain fame as the most comic hero of the century. Ace Ventura has some scenes where you find yourself falling down laughing at the idiotic activities of the protagonist. And this has also been considered Jim Carrey's funniest movie ever.<br /><br />Zoolander:<br /><br />Another popular comedian, Ben Stiller, takes to his wits in this movie with Will Farrell. This is a great comedy to watch at home in your home theater with family and friends. You will laugh almost throughout the movie. The digital copy of the movie is available in Blu-ray format too.<br /><br />Royal Tanenbaums:<br /><br />This is a dark comedy with some meaning in it. Though this won't make you laugh like a mad man, this comedy is still considered a very good comedy movie thanks to some clever and funny scenes which make it one of my great comedy movies of all time.<br /><br />Me, Myself And Irene - This is another good comedy by comedy king, Jim Carrey. The character of Hank makes the movie worth watching. It is available in both DVD and Blu-ray formats. The split personality of Jim Carrey would make anyone laugh like a maniac.<br /><br />Pineapple Express:<br /><br />You will realize watching this movie why Seth Rogen is often called the best comic actor of recent years. He proves to be a really funny guy in this movie along with other funny guys like Red and Saul.<br /><br />Austin Powers:<br /><br />International Man Of Mystery - While preparing the list of my best comedies of all time one won't be able to exclude this adventurous and hilarious journey of Austin Powers himself.<br /><br />Happy Gilmore:<br /><br />Adam Saddler is known for his comedies and if you want to see him doing his best comedy, get Happy Gilmore this weekend. I found that this webpage demonstrated this really well on this <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2luc3VyYW5jZWFza2luZy5jb20vMzYwMS9pbmRlcGVuZGFudC1pbnN1cmFuY2UtYWdlbnQv" target="_blank">Maria Koulabout</a> web site.<br /><br />Life Of Brian:<br /><br />This is the best work of the Monty Python team. You are going to love watching it with your family around.<br /><br />Ace Ventura:<br /><br />When Nature Calls - Like the previous Ace Ventura movie, this one manages to maintain humorous moments throughout.<br /><br />Tropic Thunder:<br /><br />The final 30 minutes and the beginning of the movie actually bring this great comedy to my list of top 10 comedy movies.

Factor in the raising cost of gas and slowing of the economy and it is clear to see a population that is stressed out. Growing data indicates that a good belly laugh may be the best way to battle stress. So go to the local comedy club or check out the free comedy clips on line for some stress relief.<br /><br />Laughter's benefit on your health is no joke, and provide both long term and short term benefits. When you laugh, it doesn't just lighten your load mentally, it actually induces physical changes in your body. I found that this page showed this amazingly on this <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2JsZW5kZXJldmlld3MuY29tLzExOTAvc21vb3RoaWUtbWFrZXItYmxlbmRlcnMv" target="_blank">Dario Frandsen</a> website.<br /><br />Laughter enhances your intake of oxygen-rich air, stimulates your heart, lungs and muscles, and increases the endorphins that are released by your brain.  A good laugh cools down your stress response and increases your heart rate and blood pressure. A good, relaxed feeling, and lower stress rates are the result.  Laughter can also ease digestion and stimulate circulation, which helps reduce some of the physical symptoms of stress.<br /><br />Long term benefits include an improved immune system. Negative thoughts manifest into chemical reactions that can impact your body by bringing more stress into your system and decrease your immunity. In contrast, positive thoughts actually release neuropathies that help fight stress and potentially more serious illnesses. One study, of people with cancer who watched humorous videos showed less stress. and an increase in a particular cell activity that's beneficial in fighting diseases such as HIV and cancer.  Research increasingly shows that laughter may ease pain by causing the body to produce its own natural painkillers.<br /><br />Laughter can also help make difficult situations a little bit easier. One study of nurses who work in emergency rooms found that nurses who use humor in dealing with their patients and co-workers experience greater job satisfaction.  They also experienced feelings of personal accomplishment more than do those who do not laugh during their shifts.<br /><br />The data is in that laughter is good for you, and it is a lot of fun too. So get that funny movie or go to the comedy club or watch stand up comedy online to enjoy the positive effects of humor on your body and mind.

To some degree it could be argued that Mind Mapping evolved out of this movement but regardless of your views on that, there is no doubt that this is a powerful tool to have as you travel on your self-improvement journey. What I want to do in this article is share a few ways you can use this <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2d1aXRhcmFtcGxpZmllcnNyZXZpZXdlZC5jb20vMjAvZ3VpdGFyLWFtcGxpZmllci0yLw__" target="_blank">webblog</a> to help you.<br /><br />First of all let me explain exactly what a Mind Map is if you are unfamiliar with the concept. Invented by Tony Buzan, it is a way of capturing and organizing your ideas on paper (or in a dedicated software package) that mirrors the way the brain thinks. Drawn in color it consists of a central idea depicted by an image or keyword that has branches radiating outwards. On each branch is a keyword or image that reflects what that captures the essence of what that particular branch represents in relation to the central image. The further from the center the branch is, the less important it is relative to the central idea (in the context of the particular map of course).<br /><br />Mind Mapping is a powerful process and has almost spawned its own self-growth movement because the impact it can have on your thinking is quite incredible and there are more than one or two devotees who have become quite evangelical about it. Be wary of these people as you might think their enthusiasm can appear a little cultish. I myself sometimes cross over to the fluffy &quot;hug me&quot; side when over enthusiasm for Mind Mapping takes a grip so I know how easy it is to go over the top but that is only because it truly is a powerful technique.<br /><br />So how can you use it to support your own personal development?<br /><br />Well there are many ways it can help you and what I want to do here is list just a few of the ones that I have seen have the most impact.<br /><br />1. Setting Goals - if you want to make progress in all areas of your life, it helps to define exactly what those improvements are going to be and the best place to start is by writing out your goals. Using Mind Mapping will help organize your goals (one branch per area of your life) and by expressing them in images and using color, they will enter into your subconscious much quicker. If you refer to your goal Mind Map on a daily basis it will remind you of what you are trying to achieve<br /><br />2. Planning Your Activities - setting powerful and motivating goals is only part of the process for achieving success - you then need to start taking action. You will need to work out what you are going to do and when you are going to do it. Using a it to create a plan and keep track of its progress is highly recommended. Using good Mind Map software will also give you project management functionality for those more ambitious and therefore more involved goals.<br /><br />3. Taking Notes - to achieve something you have never achieved before you will have to do things you have never done before which means you will need to learn things you have never learnt before. Mind Mapping is a powerful tool for the rapid accumulation, storage, retention and retrieval of vast amounts of information. Using good Mind Map software can assist this because you can store summaries within your map and hyperlink to files, folders and web pages. These means you can create your own knowledge base of information to support you in your development.<br /><br />There are other ways of using Mind Mapping for self-improvement but these three will have the most impact in the shortest space of time. You can use the hand drawn variety of the Mind Map which is very powerful though I recommend you start with software as you will make the most progress in the shortest possible time with the technique.
