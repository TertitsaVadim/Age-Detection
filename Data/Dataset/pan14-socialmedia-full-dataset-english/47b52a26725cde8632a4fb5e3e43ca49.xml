<br /><br />Why dieting is the worse thing to do, if you aren't prepared to really lose weight and stay with the program.
<br /><br />We’ve all heard the rallying cry over the past decade: &quot;diets dont work!&quot; The backlash against diets has been tremendous, and rightly so. It’s a well known fact that approximately 95% of those who lose weight on a typical diet will gain that weight back (and probably more!) So obviously they aren’t working right?
<br /><br />Well it depends on how you look at it and whom you ask. There are still that 5% of people who apparently haven’t gained the weight back. (Wouldn’t you actually like to meet one of those people someday<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/4210//smilies/unsure.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />So I wouldn’t say dieting don’t work. Because technically, they do. In general, if you restrict your calories you will lose weight. If diets never allowed anyone to lose weight they would have been passé long ago. Instead the diet industry just keeps chugging along, raking in billions of dollars a year, making more outrageous promises. Somebody’s got to be getting some results somewhere!
<br />Perhaps the better question to ask yourself is this:
<br /><br />Does dieting work for you?
<br /><br />Diets may work in the sense that they can take off weight under certain circumstances. But diets are far from the best method to lose weight. Diets are harmful by their very nature of what they do to our physical bodies. Maybe worse is what they do to our minds. There are two ways in which diets train our minds to actually gain weight.
<br /><br />The Question would be, What food Source or Diets are they Focusing on? Is it the reality of REALLY losing weight? or is the false test to get you to buy into products, pills, drinks and all other types of ways to &quot;LOSE weight.&quot; - Internet is our friend, Do research about the company and find out if these people are telling the truth or lieing! Google is my friend and OneDietCombo is my source for Diet Information. Click Here --&gt;&gt;&gt; Diet Source The Other question, What will be the Result? It can be multiple things in different context. Most can be accurate in finding natural diet and mental diets.
<br /><br />Let’s say that I asked you to focus on a item you personally love the most(Think about this one for a minute) Salad Think about the way it looks in front of you, fresh -- cold -- dressingy but in reality we don't like to eat Salads (according to world satistics) we'd rather spend money on foods that can hurt us in the future such as; cheese burgers, fried foods, undercooked raw meat, etc... you get my point.
<br /><br />Not only do diets place our focus on food, but they also introduce a concept that humans are not good with: restriction. When you think of the traditional ‘diet’ do you lovingly envision the carrot sticks or the cottage cheese that you’re allowed to eat? Chances are that you started dreading the ‘diets’ food, while longingly picturing the restricted stuff like pasta, or chocolate cake, or butter tarts, or French fries. That’s a classic example of what restriction does to us. Our focus turns to what we can’t have.
<br /><br />So in going on a diet, we’ve psychologically moved ourselves closer to food by focusing on it and restricting it. Talk about setting yourself up for failure! Not only does the weight come back on, but you now have a very well trained food-focused mind that values the highest calorie and least nutritionally helpful food.
<br /><br />Don't beat yourself up on when to diet and why to diet. Put a Goal and Task, Deadline.
<br /><br />Goals are &quot;DREAMS&quot; with Deadlines and we will talk in later articles about this some more.
<br /><br />Set yourself to success....  say to yourself: &quot;I WILL NOT FAIL.&quot; Good Attitude. Go with it.
<br /><br />Take your diet seriously and you will see the difference in weight because the moment you start believing you can do it, then you set yourself to success and nothing will come in the way of your dream, your destiny, your Goals!
<br /><br />We will talk more about this later

<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL09uZURpZXRDb21iby5jb20_" target="_blank">Art-Right-Mind-Set.php</a> 
<br /><br />When it comes to dieting, far too many people set themselves up for failure before they even begin the process. They literally dread going on their diets and before they start the process are planning their mishaps along the way. Far too many would be dieters are planning their first Rocky Road mishap while eating their last bowl of Rocky Road before the big event. I have no idea why we tend to do this to ourselves but it is something I see in dieters everywhere. The far too popular notion is that one must binge on the foods most loved and enjoyed before beginning the dieting process because these things must be completely eliminated in order to shed those unwanted pounds.
<br /><br />If you are honest with yourself, nothing could be further from the truth. Moderation is simply a concept that many of us are loathe to embrace. You must change your way of thinking about food and your personal enjoyment of food in order for any. Food isn't the enemy. And that is something that not enough people really understand. Even the 'tasty' foods aren't the enemy. The enemy is your personal inability to properly portion the foods you eat. The problem is that the vast majority of us eat the wrong foods far more often than we eat the right foods. This is where the problems lie. Our bodies need the nutrients we are lacking by not eating the five servings of vegetables and three servings of fruit each day that we should consume. Our bodies know that something is missing and we feel hungry or deprived.
<br /><br />If we were actually consuming the proper balance of fruits and veggies each day we would find that we were far less likely to feel hungry and desire those foods that aren't as healthy. This means we would be much more likely to enjoy them in moderation as they should be enjoyed. Portion control is another problem that we have. We live in a society of &quot;up selling&quot;. Super sized fries and empty calories by the gallon of your favorite cola are offered with almost every fast food meal that can be bought. You must learn to say no to these things and avoid situations in which you may feel tempted to partake in these up sized orders. To be truly successful when dieting you need to embrace the process as building a healthier you rather than depriving yourself of something However, if you can learn to incorporate those small treats into your routine in moderation and burn those extra calories as well, then you should find yourself a much happier and more successful 'dieter' than you have ever managed to be in the past.

<br /> If you are not into the nerve-wracking tasks of on-page Search Engine Optimization, here the three major ways to accomplish off-page SEO.
<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3Nlb215Lm5ldA__" target="_blank">On-page search engine optimization</a>  is definitely one of the key methods if a website owner would like to improve the results for his or her website's searchability. However, on-page SEO often entails technical skills. Why? Not a lot of people are HTML enthusiasts. This is often what needs to be tweaked to do an excellent job in optimizing web pages. 
<br /><br />What if a geek friend already did the on-page optimization and now you want to know how you can contribute to the &quot;search engine goodness&quot; of your website? Off-page optimization is the next step. And the results you will have to pine for are one-way backlinks. Why? This is how many of the major search engines such Google, Yahoo! and MSN rank websites. The more backlinks from relevant sites with good page rank, the merrier. 
<br /><br />So how exactly do you gather backlinks? It's not an easy task but it's definitely less nerve-wracking than HTML if you are not the techie type. Here are some off-page SEO tips:
<br /><br /><strong>1. Article Marketing</strong>
<br /><br />Quality content has been discovered to be real king. Everyone is hungry for fresh and quality info and providing it will make backlinks go pouring in. It helps a lot to be a keen writer to be successful on this endeavor. Also, practise the proper way of using a resource box. It should only include a website that contains information relevant to the article you submit to article directories. 
<br /><strong>
<br />2. Forum Participation</strong>
<br /><br />Look for forums that are relevant to your website's content and keep on sharing information that will be indispensable for the members of the forums. For Example: Forums.SeoMy.Net (Our Forums)  Your signature or that tag-along message at the last part of each of your posts is what will work for your off-page SEO campaign. Keep it simple and make sure that it conveys something about your website. Learn how to hyperlink to make it easy for the people who want to visit your site.
<br /><br /><strong>3. Blogging</strong>
<br /><br />Blogs or web logs are now the most popular weapons of <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3Nlb215Lm5ldA__" target="_blank">SEO experts</a> . Aside from being easy-to-update, they don't require a too formal tone, which is what many readers are into. Informal dialog which can be accomplished through readers leaving comments and the blog author replying to the comments is what also keeps blogs fresh and search engine friendly. Maintaining a blog that's again relevant to your website's content will keep the search engines in touch with your site. Don't forget to have a link on your main website from your blog.  
<br /><br />The secret to be successful in carrying out these off-page <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3Nlb215Lm5ldA__" target="_blank">SEO methods</a> is to be consistent. Submitting quality articles to websites at least two to three times a week and regularly producing content for your personalized blog is a surefire way to make your website stand out. Forum participation should also be something done more frequently since it will not only help you up your website's popularity with the search engines but also make you learn new stuff from other forum members' participation. Also, if you discover that you don't enjoy these stuff, there's always a plan B - hire someone to do them for you!

<br /><br />If you've been using <strong>Google AdSense </strong>on your pages you obviously feel the need to somehow generate even more traffic for your website, which in turn would translate to more AdSense click and a higher income.
<br /><br />But who do you do this? Well, the major way you'll get visitors to see your website (other then using AdWords, which is encouraged as well) is to use some techniques to have search engines send more and more users towards your page, by ranking high in search results for your topics of interest.Believe it or not this is a technique, better known as search-engine optimization or simply <strong>SEO</strong>. So here are a bunch of tips that come handy under every amateur or professional optimizer's belt.
<br /><br />The first thing you need to take care of is the actual source code and layout of your page. This has to be kept as simple as possible. The problem comes when AdSense and the search engines themselves begin to have troubles in extracting the most relevant keywords on your site because of a too complex layout.
<br /><br />Secondly, try to have each one of your pages target only one specific topic. This way it is a lot easier for them to get indexed properly and for the AdSense ads to be consistent with the content of the site itself. Also, try not to include too many hyperlinks in your page as well. This also means you should try not to use too many AdSense ads on your page either. Get High ----&gt;&gt;&gt;  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3Nlb215Lm5ldA__" target="_blank">Search Engine Optimization</a> Ranking for Free. This link is our Main site Pleae Click on <strong>Search Engine Optimization </strong>to go there!!! or visit <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.SEOmy.NET"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.SEOmy.NET</a>
<br /><br />If there are certain keywords you wish to target, make sure the word you wish to target is present in the title, in the first paragraphs as well as in the name of the file. While you're at it you might want to ensure the word springs up in the page's last paragraphs. And of course, it's very important for your content to have original and compelling content. How do you do this? Well the easiest way to do it is to find something you're really passionate about. That way, providing you give it a lot of effort you're bound to have a great page quite fast.
<br /><br />If the content you use in your site is in the public domain (which is highly discouraged) make sure that you at least give it an original title, and add an opening and a closing paragraph of your own. This takes a little while, but if, after waiting, you still can't find your page near the top, you should try rewriting your title and your first and last paragraphs. It doesn't take much, often just changing a few words will give you the right results. 
<br /><br />And of, course there's the use of keyword tools that may aid you in finding some good keywords to include on your page that will drive visitors to your site more and more.So those are about the basic techniques in search engine optimization. You can find a lot of computer tools to aid you in doing this, and of course, Google is a great place to search for this. In the end, you'll find that<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3Nlb215Lm5ldA__" target="_blank">SEO</a>  is a complex topic, and entire books have been written on the topic as well. You might find that you have a lot of optimization you need to do in order to get more and more visitors to your site and clicking those precious AdSense banners.

The rating of the site in the search system directly influences the profits your company makes. It is easy.
<br /><br />Your company has a web site. It is a good and expensive <strong>website</strong> developed and designed by true experts from the web content company. It is easy to find your site by placing the name of your company in the boxes of major search engines, yet one should understand that only few persons come to your web site this way. Most of your potential customers will visit your web site by placing major keywords in the boxes of major search engines.

If you have an existing site, there is a high probability that you may have pages in the supplemental index, so use this as a reference, and make sure you follow the steps outlined here.
<br /><br />First of all, for those of you new to this topic.
<br />What is the Supplemental Index? Here is the short answer… Google has actually 2 indexes, on call the “Main Index” and a secondary one known as “Supplemental”. One way to verify that you are looking at a supplemental result is that you can see “Supplemental Result” in green text on the bottom line of any given Google listing.Learn More about keyword Research
<br /><br />Why do pages move from main to supplemental?
<br />There are many obvious, and some not too obvious reasons for this, but Duplicate Content and Non-Updated are the two main ones. A “too dynamic” url, in other words, with too many variables, or a page that is to deep in the site’s structure also accounts for this. A word of advice on linking: If you are doing excessive reciprocal links, link buying/selling or linking to spammy neighborhoods… stop! Google algorithms has very low trust in the inbound and outbound links of those sites.
<br /><br />Solutions to get out of the supplemental index.
<br />Now that you know what this index is and why you don’t your pages in it, I will go over ways you can get them out, and back to were they belong, the main index. I will group them in pairs as they are co-related:
<br />1. Duplicate Content and Content Quality. All your meta tags should be unique. All pages have common elements like navigation, footer, etc. Make sure your page have enough unique content to offset these elements, and that you are providing quality with as well. <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5zZW9teS5uZXQ_" target="_blank">FREE SEO REVEALS...</a> </strong>
<br /><br />2. Dynamic URLs and Site Structure. Keep all URLs as “static” as possible. Why passing 3-4 variables if there is a simpler way? And every page should be 2-3 clicks away from the home page, as far as the site structure. Please refer to Google Best SEO Practices – Part 4.
<br /><br />3. Your Internal Linking and Profile. Your sitemap, which is very important component of your internal linking, should include links to all the pages on your site, and it should be linked (normally in the footer) from every page. And your site’s overall link profile directly impacts the level of trust Google gives it, and since this affects the PageTrust, less trust often translates into more supplemental pages.
<br /><br />Again, like I said before, make it easy on Google, and they will make it easy on you

<br />optimisation, SEO, it can and should be used for more. The majority of
<br />internet users actually read the information that they find online;
<br />therefore, there is a good chance for you that your website content will
<br />actually be read. You should try and make your website content more easy to
<br />understand and attractive. It is also important to note that high quality
<br />content is likely to attract better advertisements. So make sure that
<br />your website grabs it all. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5zZW9teW5ldC5ibG9nc3BvdC5jb20_" target="_blank">FREE SEO BLOG INFORMATION</a> 
<br /><br />Well, the design of your website is also important. In fact, it may be
<br />just as important as your content. You want your website to look
<br />professional, attractive, and appealing. You will want to go with plain,
<br />simple, yet professional. If you need assistance with the design of your
<br />website, you may want to think about hiring the services of a
<br />professional web designer.
<br /><br />A lot of people also try setting up multiple websites that connect to
<br />your main site. And believe me this is actually a very effective way to
<br />build up your hit count, but only if your site's content makes for
<br />excellent reading or viewing. Without quality content, your site will soon
<br />stagnate, and all the other connecting sites and blogs with it. If your
<br />site has quality content, then this should be no problem for you.
<br /><br />And let me tell you that the best way to see an increase of visitors to
<br />your site is to make sure you have a large amount of unique and
<br />relevant content on your site. The search engines like the content that
<br />readers will find useful and informative. Make sure and try to provide as
<br />much value and information in your writing as possible and place
<br />everything you write on a different page of your site. Doing this aids your
<br />site's popularity and results in it becoming an online &quot;authority&quot;
<br />website. This can result in a massive jump in search engine rankings for your
<br />site. The best part is that search engine traffic is completely free.
<br /><br />The visitors in your website themselves is a great source of
<br />advertising, because once they visit your website they usually recommend their
<br />friends to visit your website and spreads from there, resulting in higher
<br />targeted traffic. For this to happen, your website should also be
<br />attention grabbing.
<br /><br />Another effective way to invite targeted traffic to your website is
<br />buying advertising space on websites that discuss topics about your
<br />product. You can be sure that the people visiting your website are interested
<br />and may possibly buy your product. You can do free advertising for
<br />your website as well. And by doing such you can attract a lot of visitors
<br />for your website.
<br /><br />We all know that website promotion is really important so that one can
<br />attract as many visitors as possible.
<br />The aim is to use the web traffic statistics to figure out how well and
<br />how popular your site is working for your visitors. One way to
<br />determine this is to find out how long on average your visitors spend on your
<br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5zZW9teS5uZXQ_" target="_blank">GET ALL SEO SECRETS</a> 
<br />site. If the time spent is relatively brief, it usually indicates an
<br />underlying problem.
<br />Finally, if you notice that users have started finding your website by
<br />typing in your company name, all it means is that you have achieved a
<br />significant level of brand recognition, and this is a sure sign of your
<br />success!!!

<br />How to Identify and learn more about Organic SEO
<br />Hey this is AJ from
<br />Rancho CucamongaCalifornia Wanted to share with you some SEO technquies i learned and discovered what works for this techniques...
<br />What Is Organic SEO?
<br /><br />Put in the simplest manner possible, organic SEO is search engine optimization done manually using no black hat methods, no underhand methods and no automated scripting. It is the purest form of optimizing your website for the benefit of search engines, while still retaining interest for your site visitors, and done well it is exactly the thing that search engines are looking for in a website. Once they find it they will reward your site with better rankings and improved positions within the search engine results pages. Throughout the course of this article it will be referred to as simply SEO.
<br /><br />Understanding The Search Engines
<br /><br />Understanding Search Engines and their general concept is vital to the use of effective SEO methods. Search engines enable their visitors to enter a specific word or term, known as keywords. Once submitted, all pages containing those keywords that can be found in the search engine’s directory are listed on the search engine result pages. Each page is “ranked” according to relevancy, popularity and a few other factors. Therefore, in theory, the more relevant a page is to a given keyword the more likely it will appear at the top of the listings.
<br /><br />Introducing The Search Engine Spiders
<br /><br />Another important factor to remember about search engines is that they don’t use real people to crawl the billions of websites and judge how relevant they are. Instead they use automated software called a “spider” or a “bot” that does this work much quicker. The calculations that the search engine uses to determine the ranking of a website are called algorithms and in the case of the major search engines like Google, Yahoo and MSN these algorithms are changed on a regular basis. The changes and the specifics of the algorithms are not released to the public in order to prevent black hat SEOs from manipulating their sites to reach the top of the pile despite containing to information relevant to the search query or keyword.This is the Best SEO Book
<br /><br />Optimizing For Search Engines – Optimizing For Visitors
<br /><br />Of course to some extent, all of us reading this article are probably guilty of altering our web pages to meet the whims of search engines but it must be done in a positive and organic way. We understand that optimizing a page purely for the benefit of search engines spiders may massively detract from the actual value of the site to your visitors. Search engines understand this too, hence the evolution of the algorithms. With each new algorithm created and usually patented by search engines like Google, we are getting closer to a structure whereby sites are genuinely judged on their value to visitors. It may sound like an Isaac Asimov novel but the algorithms and the spiders are basically becoming more human like.
<br /><br />Basic Components Of SEO
<br /><br />The actual methods of optimizing your website are saved for another article, but the basic components of an SEO campaign are broken down into on page and off page optimization techniques. On page SEO includes factors like keyword inclusion, content optimization, page structure etc… whereas the main contributing factor of off page optimization is inbound links. There are many different factors to each of these areas and different SEOs will give you varying information on which factors are the most relevant to gain higher rankings. These extensive differences in opinion occur because nobody is certain of the algorithm criteria.
<br /><br />The Benefits Of SEO
<br /><br />SEO is probably the most beneficial way to conduct Internet promotion. It is highly cost effective, can yield long term results and the leads it generates are opt in and targeted. This doesn’t mean you shouldn’t consider trying out alternative methods of advertising your site. For many, banner advertisements, press releases (can actually be used as part of an SEO campaign as well), PPC campaigns and sponsored listings prove to highly beneficial and including these will help your site’s popularity.
<br /><br />To Cost Effectiveness And To Life
<br /><br />The cost effectiveness is easily determined when you look at the potential of an SEO campaign compared to the method that many consider to be the next best thing – PPC. A PPC campaign will usually cost you anywhere upward of 5 cents per visitor generated. This means that for every thousand visitors you receive you will have paid $50. Some fairly basic SEO work on a web site containing ten pages will generate this kind of traffic on a monthly basis relatively quickly.
<br /><br />$50 doesn’t sound much but consider that you pay this in one month to receive the desired one thousand visitors. Over the space of a year you will have paid $600, and so on. Now consider that you are competing for a relatively competitive keyword and you find that you need to be paying a minimum of 50 cents per click to generate just the one thousand clicks in a month. All of a sudden you’re paying $6000 per year and you are still only getting one thousand clicks every month. $6000 will buy you an awful lot of SEO work and you should find that within a few months you are generating a lot more traffic using SEO.
<br /><br />Targeted Leads
<br /><br />Targeted leads are the best type of leads you can generate. It means that the visitors to your site are already predisposed to the basic topic of your site and are interested in what you have to say. It means that they will be more likely to purchase goods or services from your site, click on affiliate links or click Google ads to earn you revenue. Because SEO leads are physically searching for the topic that your site relates to you are guaranteed that they are interested in whatever you’re offering. First of all they search using keywords relevant to your site. They then read the description and name of your site and this further compounds their interest in the page in question and click on the link. Already they have become highly susceptible to the message of your web page.
<br /><br />So Remember…
<br /><br />SEO is a webmaster’s greatest tool but treated badly it can quickly blow up in your face. By ensuring you stick to the very letter of the law and do not use any underhand methods you should soon benefit from powerful leads that will frequent your site and earn you revenue.

<br /><br />Recently Google did a major PageRank update where a lot of sites were downgraded. Many experts believe this PageRank update was Google's response to link selling - sites which sell links lost points in their PageRank.
<br /><br />Google measures all web pages on a scale of importance from 0 to 10, which is shown in a small green pixel bar on browsers carrying the Google Toolbar. PageRank is &quot;supposedly&quot; measured by the number of backlinks to your site.
<br /><br />Online democracy in action, a link is a vote for your site. The more votes you have the higher your site is ranked. At least that's how it was supposed to work until a lot of high PR sites started selling links and put a monkey wrench into the whole system. The <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3Nlb2Rlc3RpbmF0aW9uLmNvbQ__" target="_blank">SEOdestination to all your needs is</a> ...
<br /><br />The latest update may be a smart move on Google's part to curtail this practice; who's going to buy a link from a PR2 or even a PR4 site? Besides this could be more than a warning that your site will go down even further if you continue to sell links.
<br /><br />Now this is more of a cosmetic change in PageRank than a real change in your true rankings in Google. Just because your PR goes down doesn't mean your keyword rankings or traffic from Google also goes down.
<br /><br />I saw some of my sites go up, some stayed the same, but my major site took a big hit - falling from PR6 to PR4. This was more of a devastating blow than I expected mainly for psychological reasons than actual consequences. After years of building the best content you can muster and constantly getting quality one-way links, to see that PageRank drop was very disappointing and hits to the core of your online work.
<br /><br />Google sometimes just slap you at the face without any apparent reason. but lets keep it up.
<br /><br />I have been around for a while so I have experienced many Google Updates - anyone remember the Florida Update? I also keep my ears peeled to discussions of the latest updates in Webmasterworld and Stompernet, and I even read Matt Cutts when I get real nervous... so I knew not to panic just because of the sudden drop in PageRank.
<br /><br />I also knew what most of the SEO experts were saying was true because my major keywords stayed the same and my Google traffic actually went up. But that's little comfort when you're talking about Google; you immediately go into overdrive and try to figure out where you went wrong. What caused the drop - because whether PageRank is meaningless or not, you're still going in the wrong direction.
<br /><br />I saw many of my competitors drop too, but many stayed the same and even a few increased in PageRank. What are they doing right; what am I doing wrong? I don't sell links but does Google think I am selling links was my main concern? I even moved one external link from my main page to another part of my site, just in case Google is mistaking that as a paid link.
<br /><br />Welcome to webmaster's paranoid hell! Well, i believe that every webmaster has becamed paranoid about google one day.
<br /><br />For SEO reasons I have very few external links on my main page. Can't see why Google downgraded my main site. I have been at PR6 for years.
<br /><br />Herein lies my main beef, with Google you never really know where you stand; you are constantly walking on eggshells. No matter how good your content or your site is - one misstep and you could be in the doghouse. All your hard work can be taken away in a heartbeat.
<br /><br />It wouldn't matter so much if it was one of the other two major search engines downgrading your site but this is Google.
<br /><br />Free organic traffic from Google is vital to any online site or business. I would take traffic from Google over any other source of traffic on the web, except for traffic coming from my articles on other sites, and even that traffic probably originated from a search in Google.
<br /><br />Google and Google PageRank have always been important to me - that's one of the reasons a sudden large drop causes so much concern. There's another important reason Google PageRank is important to me.
<br /><br />Most SEO experts mistakenly believe PageRank is meaningless because Google is not giving us the true ranking of any site or revealing all the backlinks, which is supposedly one of the major factors in how Google ranks sites. While this fact is obviously true, it has caused many to jump to another conclusion.
<br /><br />Because Google is not giving us the real ranking, many webmasters have dismissed PageRank as a vital element in their sites. Don't make the same mistake.
<br /><br />Google PageRank is extremely important if you're doing business on the web. The higher PR you have, the better. But it has nothing to do with keyword rankings or first page SERPs.
<br /><br />What many SEO experts fail to realize (not really their business) is the whole &quot;perceived&quot; value of PageRank.
<br /><br />Google, hate it or love it, has become the most respected company on the web in the eyes of the majority of the web's users. It carries enormous weight and prestige. The &quot;perceived&quot; value of a high PR7 or PR8 is extremely valuable.
<br /><br />We are not talking about link selling; we are talking about how a perspective business partner or customer will treat your site or business.
<br /><br />Say you have two identical sites you want to do business with online and you discover one is a Google PR2 site and the other is a <strong>Google PR8</strong> site - which one would you choose to do business with? Honestly?
<br /><br />From first-hand experience, I know any online company or marketer will get more business offers and be offered more partnerships/joint ventures if you have a high Google PR site than a low one. It will make a difference to your bottom line.
<br /><br />PageRank is important. PageRank has meaning. Even if it has little bearing on your SERPs rankings or Google traffic, PageRank can greatly influence the success of your online site or venture. Don't ignore or dismiss PageRank as a meaningless relic that didn't quite work out as Google had planned for it in the first place.
<br /><br />High PageRank will always be valuable.
<br /><br />The day Google gives its own site a PageRank of PR1 or PR2 instead of the current PR10 - that's the day you can dismiss PageRank as truly meaningless.

Everyone may have a different understanding of what “quality” is on terms of links, but essentially that is your decision entirely. If you have an existing site, that you need to build links for, use this as a reference check list to ensure that you are link building properly. I am going to review the key 6 areas.  T<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5zZW9teW5ldC5ibG9nc3BvdC5jb20_" target="_blank">his is all explained in my Blog... Click here to be a Subscriber for free SEO information</a> 
<br /><br />Is the page linking to you indexed in Google and is the cache version fresh? 
<br />Why is this essential? Google has a cached page of any indexed page on their index. So basically, this should be your starting point for any link partnership decision. You need to verify that the page the link partner is proposing for exchange, is actually indexed and that the cached version is of the page is fresh in their records, within 20 days old as a benchmark. This will show that the page in question gets crawled often. PageRank of the page is secondary, and comes normally afterwards in comparison to this primary check. 
<br /><br />Is the page linking to you on topic? Is this a themed link?
<br />There is a big difference between the types of links you can get. These type of link are very targeted and carry a lot more weight over generic or unrelated links. This is part of what explains why some sites with much less links that their direct competitors are able to outrank them for particular terms. Quality links from themed sources is the short answer. Focusing on just &quot;popularity&quot; and inadvertently ignoring &quot;reputation&quot; is a mistake a lot of online marketers make. Keep this in mind.
<br /><br />Is the Title tag of the page linking to you on-topic? What about the text?
<br />The title tag of the page linking to you is of great importance. When that is combined with text that is on topic with the page which is being link from, and other factors, the link value is increased greatly for the link. So as you can understand from this, is all about the co-relation of these factors that makes one link better than another.
<br /><br />Where is your link on the page located? Navigation, gutter, footer, body?
<br />Location of your link is another strong factor to consider. The most beneficial location is considered to be within the body area of content. Any repetitive areas like navigation, gutter, footer, etc would normally not carry as much weight as the main body area. “Run-of-site” links fall into this group. There is a preference for the first paragraph, but the middle or bottom within the body content are good areas as well.
<br /><br />How many other links are on the page? Home Page vs. Link Page PR gap?
<br />PageRank gets automatically diluted in relation to the amount of links on the page.
<br />Google guidelines currently suggest a maximum of 100 links per page. So here you
<br />want to make sure the number is as small as possible. I recommend targeting 20 links per page maximum on average to have room to allow those pages link growth. Also, what is the difference between the main page PR and the subpage were you are getting the link from? In the best cases, your link will be one point under the home page value. If it isn’t, you can consider other options with your link partner.

<br /><br />Cheating is the worst form of destruction to your relationship or marriage. The discovery of the act of cheating by the other half can either break the relationship or make it stronger depending on the strength of their love for one another. Cheating generally means that you are not fully satisfied with your current girlfriend or you feel that something is missing in the relationship. If you were completely in love and happy within your relationship, why it might happen that your girlfriend have an affair?
<br /><br />Trust is a big reason, not of your Girlfriend, but yourself. Probably for some time you have sensed something is different or questioned the change of behavior in your partner. A cheating Girlfriend in a Relationship can cause much emotional trauma, not to mention the harm it could cause if you have any kids or future plans.
<br /><br />Here is some Important Clues You Should be Looking For To Catch Signs for Cheating…
<br />What To Look For…
<br /><br />Changes in appearance and attitude. You Should Look For if She has a sudden preoccupation with her appearance. She is more interested on how she dresses; go often to a hair salon and even to gym, even if this wasn’t her main priority before.
<br /><br />Lessened intimacy. If in the past you used to share everything with your wife and then suddenly she seems distanced and clams up when you try to discuss intimate things, it could mean that she has already distanced herself emotionally and mentally from you. She is suddenly frigid and loses any interest in doing anything with her husband. She’s being secretive. She’s no longer sharing her daily events with you. She might avoid you because she feels guilty. Don’t get paranoid and suspicious, ask her if everything is ok and tell her she’s been acting differently lately.
<br /><br />Disinterest in family. If your wife is no longer excited to meet you at the door from work there must be a problem here. Or when your partner feels the sudden need to go out try to find a reason to accompany her. If she comes up with a reason that she had to go on her own push the issue, not too much but just enough to see if she becomes more uncomfortable.
<br /><br />Less arguing and fighting. She used to get angry if you didn’t want to come out with her and her friends, but now everything you do is all right by her. Once upon a time, your every move had to be premeditated, but now all the small things you used to mess up aren’t enraging her. This could be a good thing, but you wonder why she no longer cares.
<br /><br />More phone and internet. In the last time she speaks a lot at the telephone using a low voice or whisper on the phone and hangs up quickly. Maybe she set up a new e-mail account and doesn’t tell you about it. Watch out because she might buy a cell phone and doesn’t let you know. Ask her if she is being true with you and if she becomes accusatory then it is obvious that she is cheating you.
<br />She’s always late. In the past she never came home late but now this happens more and more. Her explanation is that she had to stay more at the office because she has a lot of work to do. Or she goes to the store and comes home four hours later. This is really a reason to worry. Cheating spouses often look and act guilty, give a general feeling that something isn’t right.
<br /><br />They try and avoid meaningful conversations, keep everything at a general and non intimate level.
