The white goods; fridges, freezers, ovens, washing machines, and driers account for a large chink of both our energy bills and Co2 emissions. And while there are alternative methods of cooking, cleaning and washing clothes, we still need our appliances.<br /><br />However, ensuring you buy the most energy efficient device can make a drastic difference considering the frequency of use and the amount of power these devices consume.<br /><br />Fortunately there are some energy labels on many white goods that can give you guidance on the eco friendly credential and the power and water these devices consume. These energy efficiency labels are governed by the EU so you can ensure of the power consumption of the device you are buying.<br /><br />Washing machines and Tumble Dryers<br /><br />For washing machines the energy efficiency scale goes from A to G with A being the most efficient. The labels also contain other information too:<br /><br />* Maximum spin speed<br /><br />* The total capacity<br /><br />* Water consumption per cycle in litres<br /><br />* Noise generated<br /><br />Tumble driers have a similar A-G scale, A being the most efficient. There is also guidance on the labels for capacity, noise and ventilation.<br /><br />Fridge freezers<br /><br />The same A to G scale is also indicated on the efficiency labels of fridges and freezers with similar information on their capacity.<br /><br />Other energy efficient devices worth considering<br /><br />There are other devices that are deigned purely for their efficiency. These are often far more efficient methods that traditional devices. Eco Kettles are one example. An eco kettle will only boil the required amount of water and is far more efficient than traditional kettles.<br /><br />Halogen ovens are an eco friendlier approach to cooking too. These heat-up instantly and require less energy than conventional ovens to produce the heat - saving money and energy.<br /><br />Whether you are a landlord or a tenant, it is important to know what responsibilities you have towards maintaining a rental property and the types of repairs for which you are liable.<br /><br />&lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;U&gt;The Landlords Responsibilities&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/U&gt;<br />&lt;br&gt;The &lt;I&gt;Landlord and Tenant Act 1985&lt;/I&gt; sets out the responsibilities of a landlord in all short-term residential leases under 7 years in length. The Act provides that the landlord is responsible for the following aspects of maintenance:<br /><br />&lt;UL&gt;<br />&lt;LI&gt;Keeping the exterior of the property in good repair. This includes ensuring that roofs, walls, doors, windows, pipes, guttering and drains are maintained and that any leaks or structural faults are repaired.<br />&lt;/LI&gt;<br />&lt;LI&gt;Keeping all installations or infrastructure for the supply of gas, water, electricity and sewerage in good repair. For example, a tenant is not responsible for redecorating or refurbishing a property when the tenancy ends, but where a property is let out for a term of several years, a provision requiring the tenants to redecorate may be included in the tenancy agreement.<br /><br />&lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;U&gt;Responsibility For Maintenance of Furnishings&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/U&gt;<br />&lt;br&gt;If the property is let as fully or part furnished, or with white goods such as a cooker, fridge or washing machine, it is the responsibility of the landlord to ensure that all of these furnishings are adequately maintained throughout the course of the tenancy.<br /><br />All electrical and gas appliances should be checked for safety on an annual basis, and the landlord should ensure that furnishings are fire resistant, fit for purpose, and are not likely to cause harm or injury.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uZXdzdmluZS5jb20vX252L2FwaS9jb250ZW50L2FydGljbGVzL3B1Ymxpc2g_" target="_blank">White Goods Bury my bank account, but there is a solution</a>

Even though many have the capability to purchase white goods online, they simply do not opt for such activities. Since they do not get to see the product (for real), they fear that they might get cheated in the process. In order to eliminate the fears associated with these people, the website will include a &quot;help and support&quot; section that will address some basic queries. Advanced information for conducting the transaction, with an ample number of screenshots will also aid the amateurs to feel good and comfortable.<br /><br />Here is an insider tip that is known to be highly effective - look out for the company information section. In there you will come across the history and motto of the company. The white goods will be grouped appropriately so that anyone will be able to find a product of their choice. Always stick with those online websites, who offer a variety (electrical appliances from all the reputed vendors must be highlighted and available for purchase on the website). Some of these service providers will also give away free interest free financing schemes to coax the internet users. Look out for the payment options listed on the website - the more the merrier!<br /><br />The utility bills that have to be paid on a monthly basis can really swallow up a substantial part of the monthly budget. Do not fret though because there are plenty of ways in which you can reduce them.<br /><br />The main cost of your utility bills is going to be because of heating your property, and with this being the case it is important that should you have a really old heating system then you replace it with a newer one. It also pays to seal up any draughts, where heat is being lost.<br /><br />Approximately a third of the heat in a property can be lost through the roof, if a property is not insulated properly. With this being the case it is important to have fully functioning loft insulation. Also, don't use every single radiator in a property when you have the heating on. The radiators in spare rooms and rooms not in use do not need to be used.<br /><br />Should you live in a warm climate then it is beneficial to use ceiling mounted fans as opposed to keeping an air conditioning unit running all the time. This will save you considerable amounts of money.  Take advantage of the winter sun by letting the direct light in which can heat a room up remarkably well. A lot of warmth can be provided by using this technique and it is completely cost free.<br /><br />If you have old appliances then you need to be replacing them. Although white-goods are not cheap, it will work out far cheaper in the long haul to get new ones. An example of the savings to be made is the fact that an old refrigerator costs &amp;pound;150,00 more to run pre year, than a new one does.<br /><br />Insulation for both your hot water tank and your pipes is of the utmost importance as so much heat is wasted by not doing this. that way you can be sure that you are running them as efficiently as possible.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5ja2hhLmNvLnVrLw__" target="_blank">White Goods in Bury</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5ja2hhLmNvLnVr" target="_blank">Bury White Goods</a>

For example, a tenant is not responsible for redecorating or refurbishing a property when the tenancy ends, but where a property is let out for a term of several years, a provision requiring the tenants to redecorate may be included in the tenancy agreement.<br /><br />&lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;U&gt;Responsibility For Maintenance of Furnishings&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/U&gt;<br />&lt;br&gt;If the property is let as fully or part furnished, or with white goods such as a cooker, fridge or washing machine, it is the responsibility of the landlord to ensure that all of these furnishings are adequately maintained throughout the course of the tenancy.<br /><br />All electrical and gas appliances should be checked for safety on an annual basis, and the landlord should ensure that furnishings are fire resistant, fit for purpose, and are not likely to cause harm or injury.<br /><br />What are white goods?

He was the owner of the first department store in Philadelphia in l878. It is said that he invented the said marketing strategy primarily to keep linen makers employed.<br /><br />White sales is mythologized as not necessarily a sale at discounted prices. People believe that there is actually no discount offered when goods are offered for sales because the products were marked up higher than the regular price in the first place.<br /><br />Moreover, goods for sale are not limited to household items and not only white items are sold. In addition, people say that white sales is for retailers to draw attention to their selling skills and care less about product knowledge.<br /><br />For other retailers however, white sales is a way to sell overstock merchandise and reduce inventory or a way to get rid of obsolete items. It may not be the best time for consumers to buy. Nonetheless, it is a positive way to complete an ensemble before the soon-to-be discontinued items are out of the market.<br /><br />A lot of modern retailers employ this marketing strategy as a clever method to drive traffic into the store in the hope that people will come to purchase not only the products on sale but also other items which carry higher margins.<br /><br />People take advantage of white sales on major appliances because some retailers do not always refer to sales on these major products as white sales but only on bed sheets and bath towels. Stores ordinarily distinguish sale of household linens and major appliances. &quot;Homes Sales&quot; however include both groups of household products.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wcmVzcy1yZWxlYXNlLmluL2VuL2tlZXBpbmctZ3JlZW4tYW5kLXdhcm0tZG91YmxlLWdsYXppbmctNjUwNDAx" target="_blank">Keeping Green and Warm With Double Glazing</a>

The white goods; fridges, freezers, ovens, washing machines, and driers account for a large chink of both our energy bills and Co2 emissions. And while there are alternative methods of cooking, cleaning and washing clothes, we still need our appliances.<br /><br />However, ensuring you buy the most energy efficient device can make a drastic difference considering the frequency of use and the amount of power these devices consume.<br /><br />Fortunately there are some energy labels on many white goods that can give you guidance on the eco friendly credential and the power and water these devices consume. These energy efficiency labels are governed by the EU so you can ensure of the power consumption of the device you are buying.<br /><br />Washing machines and Tumble Dryers<br /><br />For washing machines the energy efficiency scale goes from A to G with A being the most efficient. The labels also contain other information too:<br /><br />* Maximum spin speed<br /><br />* The total capacity<br /><br />* Water consumption per cycle in litres<br /><br />* Noise generated<br /><br />Tumble driers have a similar A-G scale, A being the most efficient. There is also guidance on the labels for capacity, noise and ventilation.<br /><br />Fridge freezers<br /><br />The same A to G scale is also indicated on the efficiency labels of fridges and freezers with similar information on their capacity.<br /><br />Other energy efficient devices worth considering<br /><br />There are other devices that are deigned purely for their efficiency. These are often far more efficient methods that traditional devices. Eco Kettles are one example. An eco kettle will only boil the required amount of water and is far more efficient than traditional kettles.<br /><br />Halogen ovens are an eco friendlier approach to cooking too. These heat-up instantly and require less energy than conventional ovens to produce the heat - saving money and energy.<br /><br />Whether you are a landlord or a tenant, it is important to know what responsibilities you have towards maintaining a rental property and the types of repairs for which you are liable.<br /><br />&lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;U&gt;The Landlords Responsibilities&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/U&gt;<br />&lt;br&gt;The &lt;I&gt;Landlord and Tenant Act 1985&lt;/I&gt; sets out the responsibilities of a landlord in all short-term residential leases under 7 years in length. The Act provides that the landlord is responsible for the following aspects of maintenance:<br /><br />&lt;UL&gt;<br />&lt;LI&gt;Keeping the exterior of the property in good repair. This includes ensuring that roofs, walls, doors, windows, pipes, guttering and drains are maintained and that any leaks or structural faults are repaired.<br />&lt;/LI&gt;<br />&lt;LI&gt;Keeping all installations or infrastructure for the supply of gas, water, electricity and sewerage in good repair. For example, a tenant is not responsible for redecorating or refurbishing a property when the tenancy ends, but where a property is let out for a term of several years, a provision requiring the tenants to redecorate may be included in the tenancy agreement.<br /><br />&lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;U&gt;Responsibility For Maintenance of Furnishings&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/U&gt;<br />&lt;br&gt;If the property is let as fully or part furnished, or with white goods such as a cooker, fridge or washing machine, it is the responsibility of the landlord to ensure that all of these furnishings are adequately maintained throughout the course of the tenancy.<br /><br />All electrical and gas appliances should be checked for safety on an annual basis, and the landlord should ensure that furnishings are fire resistant, fit for purpose, and are not likely to cause harm or injury.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5hZnJpY2FuZXdzd2lyZS5uZXQvc3RvcnkucGhwP3RpdGxlPXdoaXRlLWdvb2RzLWJ1cnktbXktYmFuay1hY2NvdW50LWJ1dC10aGVyZS1pcy1hLXNvbHV0aW9u" target="_blank">How Efficient is My Dishwasher?</a>
