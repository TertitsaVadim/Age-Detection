For those in the state, particularly in the Kashmir Valley, it is the time when gardens bloom, fruits ripen and tourists arrive.
<br /><br />This year, the arrival of spring has seen the state holding Panchayat elections after nearly a decade in Jammu and Kashmir.
<br /><br />The last Panchayat elections in 2001 had varied participation in different regions of the state. While it evoked a good response in Jammu and Ladakh, with participation ranging from 70 to 80 percent, elections in the Kashmir Valley were called a 'paper exercise', with participation ranging from 32 percent in Srinagar to 48 percent in Baramula. Kupwara was an exception with 66 percent participation.
<br /><br />The Hizb-ul-Mujahideen and the All Party Hurriyat Conference urged people to boycott the elections.
<br /><br />When Panchayat elections were announced this year, speculation was rife as to whether people would participate. The All Party Hurriyat Conference asked people to boycott the polls.
<br /><br />Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah sounded the right note at the start of the elections by saying the elections were an exercise in the decentralization of the administration.
<br /><br />Over 80 per cent people cast their votes, even in villages dominated by the Hizb-ul- Mujahideen. People participated in elections, even after militants brutally murdered a lady candidate.
<br /><br />The response of the people indicated, as Dr Manmohan Singh said on the occasion of National Panchayat Diwas in the capital, that people wanted to decide their fate themselves.
<br /><br />The new Panchayat leaders will have a say in the running of schools and hospitals and the state government would need to ensure that funds allocated are spent for the purpose they were meant for.
<br /><br />Militant threats did not deter people from participating in Panchayat elections, and this clearly indicated that separatist influence is on the wane in the state.
<br /><br />It would be wrong, however, to assume that people are satisfied with the status quo.
<br /><br />As indicated by the three central government appointed interlocutors -- Dileep Padgaonkar, Radha Kumar and M. M. Ansari -- people want a change, but that change differs from region to region.
<br /><br />The interlocutors have met over 500 delegations from different parts of the state, and a majority of them hold the view that a political settlement in Jammu and Kashmir must ensure unity and territorial integrity within the Indian Union. All delegations have demanded a fresh delimitation of constituencies based on the criteria of the size of the area and population.
<br /><br />The interlocutors also offered to meet the separatists, but the All Party Hurriyat Conference barred the separatists from meeting them. They asked separatists to send them their published documents which explained their stand on political settlement in the state, but in vain.
<br /><br />It is time that the interlocutors understand that separatists have little to offer. They do not represent anybody except themselves and some of them are receiving directions from their patrons from across
<br />the Line of Control.
<br /><br />The interlocutors could meet Moulvi Abbas Ansari, the suspended Hurriyat leader. Ansari reacted to his suspension by saying that it was 'Azadi' for him and the Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen to come out of the Hurriyat.
<br /><br />He told the interlocutors that he favoured a dialogue and added that for it to be meaningful, it should be acceptable to all parties - India, Pakistan and the Kashmiris. He also wanted the security forces
<br />to remain in their camps.
<br /><br />Dileep Padgaonkar has denied a report that says the interlocutors are likely to recommend that the Governor of Jammu and Kashmir should be elected and that the Chief Minister should be called Prime Minister.
<br /><br />The interlocutors have been able to establish that they are apolitical and are keen to find solutions to the various problems confronting the state. They are convinced that the people of the State want more autonomy and the three regions in the state want a change in the status quo. In the final analysis, that would mean delegating powers to the three regions.
<br /><br />It would also be necessary to create institutions to empower the regions. Before finalizing their report, the interlocutors will hold two roundtable conferences at Jammu and at Srinagar.
<br /><br />It is a wiser Omar Abdullah who would be looking forward to a peaceful spring and summer in Kashmir.
<br /><br />Past experience shows that even the slightest excuse is good enough for emotions to be roused. The state went through turmoil in April over the granting of the 'Dogra certificate', which was supposed to help in recruitment to the security forces by relaxing physical standards. The desire to gain political mileage fuelled an explosive situation.
<br /><br />In the final analysis, Jammu and Kashmir wants 'Azadi', which means different things to different people. In the final analysis the state wants 'Azadi' from the terrorists who promote violence.

		<document id="e9af61f187737cfaa3079eb44e46d02d" url=""><![CDATA[The Dangerous Chance Of Nuclear Weapons Being Grabbed By Ext<br/><br/>Salman Taseer, governor of Punjab (Pakistan), was assassinated by his own bodyguard, 26 year old Malik Qadri. As he was brought before a magistrate in Islamabad, he was showered with rose petals by hundreds of shouting supporters who also garlanded him. This scene at the court highlighted the intensifying of fundamentalism in Pakistan that has grown to an extreme point in that country.
<br /><br />Taseer’s was a prominent voice for secularism. He had been speaking against the nation’s bigoted blasphemy laws. Neither the leader of the Opposition in Punjab Mr Nawaz Sharif nor President Asif Ali Zardari attended Taseer’s funeral services. Pak Interior Minister Rahman Malik went so far as to say he prepared to shoot any blasphemer himself.
<br /><br />The fact is there is a vertical polarization in Pakistan. There is a large number of Islamic extremists (Talibanised Pakistani) and a very small number of liberals whose voice is hardly heard. Yet as fanaticism spreads, there is no sign of leadership from the Government of Pakistan. What is called the religious Right remains unabashed in its open loathing of Taseer and his secular stand, specifically his stand against Pakistan’s over-strict blasphemy laws.
<br /><br />The assassin Qadri hails from a suburb of Islamabad. He is a follower of Dawat-e-Islami, a Karashi based fundamentalist party. Qadri had joined the Special Forces branch of the Punjab police in 2002 and had been assigned to guard the governor. His record shows up the extent to which the police and the military in Pakistan have been infiltrated by the fundamentalist fanatics. The threat to India from this development comes from the fact that 100% of these fanatics are anti-India.
<br /><br />The Pak stockpile of nuclear arms has been constant cause of anxiety for the world. The USA has already constituted a panel to look over this stockpile. In a similar expression of concern Mr M K Narayanan,the former National Security Adviser (now Governor of West Bengal) had told the Americans that India had come upon instances of manifest attempts by the jihadi outfits to get hold of fissile material to make a crude nuclear bomb for use in a terroristic operation. These groups are all the time on the look-out for such material and this keeps India on the tenterhooks as India is their no one enemy and no one target.
<br /><br />Though these groups have not acquired fissile material they have enough physics to fabricate a crude bomb beyond dirty bomb. Narayanan made this unsettling revelation at a meeting with two Democratic Senators Russ Feingold and Bob Casey in New Delhi which was attended also by then US Ambassador in India David Mulford. Mulford immediately transmitted in a cable Narayanan’s assertion to Washington. The significance of this top secret cable is that this is the fist time an Indian officer has explicitly acknowledged the threat of a nuclear attack against India in a terrorist operation. India USA, the George Bush administration used to talk often of terrorist nuclear and biological weapons threat to American cities. But India hitherto consistently refused to talk in public about any possibility of any Indian city being the target of a crude nuclear bomb attack in a terrorist operation, ostensibly for fear of creating panic among the Indian people, especially when cross border terrorist infiltration is a common occurrence. Narayanan’s revelation to the American, however, shows that such a threat to India is real and that Indian security agencies are seized of the danger.
<br /><br />The driving force behind Pakistan’s nuclear ambitions is that country’s obsession with India as a rival and an enemy. This makes for Islamabad’s incapability to realize that the real threat to its integrity is from Taliban and other extremists. Its army claims to be in need of more nuclear weapons to deter its chief enemy India’s superior conventional weaponry.
<br /><br />Pakistan cannot feed its people, impart education to its children, or carry on its fight against its fundamentalist rebels without billions of dollars in foreign aid, mainly from the USA. Yet it is now constructing a fourth nuclear reactor produce more weapon fuel. Steadily building up its nuclear arsenal since President Barack Obama took office in 2009, Pakistan is well on its way to overtake Britain as the fifth largest nuclear weapon Power and is likely even to surpass France as the fourth largest. As a State that has a permanent persecutory paranoia attitude to its neighbour India has considerable cause for apprehension for its security.

Settling here is a grand way to chill out all through the holidays. If you are visiting India for the first time, in that case you should make an effort on settling at one of the well maintained one in New Delhi- the capital city of India. 
<br /><br />Guest houses are a sort of accommodation that are fairly like the inns, bed &amp; breakfast and public houses situated across diverse parts of the world. These are not costly always; however they can be if they are worth the lavishness they are putting forward. A lot of times these lodgings are family-owned and encompass a small workforce attendance also. 
<br /><br />Guest houses extend a service to the tourists who search for a cheaper place substitute to motels and <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5kb2xwaGlubi5jb20v" target="_blank">hotels in delhi</a>. The majority of them can be found in all the rage parts of the capital. They in addition offer facilities that are comparable to the hotels and motels. The welcoming ambiance of these places ensures that the visitors feel at home. 
<br /><br />The area of a guest house is important to make a decision about its appeal. In a metropolitan like New Delhi, it's essential to prefer the one that is located in close proximity to major business hubs. This will not just bank your time in arriving at your destination, all the way through the grave traffic usually found here.  Moreover, there are several guest houses situated close to the city's business hubs. These are only a walking distance away from the main administrative centers. 
<br /><br />These guesthouses put forward necessary facilities like comfy bed, cold and hot water, as well as additional most indispensable amenities anticipated by the visitors. Each guest house comes at a different price. It is wise to select one that falls within your individual financial plan. Though, it is sensible to opt for a superior guest house if you can extend your plan to exceed slightly.

		<document id="8d42f7b27067477ea4930f6face7082e" url=""><![CDATA[Post-Osama Global Setting: Challenges And Opportunities<br/><br/>Through his acts of reckless terrorism, Osama bin Laden was the single most destabilizing factor in the international arena. He gave a shattering blow to the American commercial hub and reduced New York's magnificent twin towers to the ground zero. The 9/11 terror act was a turning point in the history of the US, nay, of humankind. The Muslim world has never been the same since then. It continues to be in a state of flux and uncertainties even after the killing of the world's dreaded terrorist by American forces in Pakistan's suburban military town of Abbottabad. It is ironic that al Qaeda's supremo was being sheltered in the hilly hideout of Pakistan, apparently under the protective cover of ISI and within the knowledge of top brass-tacks of the army, which has military alliance with Americans.
<br /><br />After years and years of manhunt in the strategic AfPak belt, the American forces have taken the revenge for the 9/11 dastardly act. Full marks to the CIA for operating within the territory of Pakistan, and carrying out the 40-minute strike in Abbottabad, single-handedly without local backup. This has had its serious fallout beyond the boundaries of Afghanistan-Pakistan belt. It has thrown up several new questions on America's futuristic equations with Pakistan as well as democratic regimes.
<br /><br />Keeping Indian sensitivities in mind vis a vis Pakistan and Afghanistan, here is a relevant the question of American double standards on its response to counter-terrorism action by countries like India which has suffered the most by Pak-sponsored terrorism in Kashmir and beyond. It doesn't wish to see decades of Pakistani-sponsored terror acts in the same way as it sees al-Qaeda operations within America.
<br /><br />Well, Osama today is part of the turbulent history of militancy. He is dead and gone but bin Ladenism is very much around and will continue to kick unless Washington reorients its policies and makes its counter-terrorism plans and strategy more inclusive and broad-based while ensuring total secrecy. Interestingly, Osama's terror strategy could successfully change the global focal points - from Europe to the rugged mountainous areas of Afghanistan, the Northwestern tribal region of Pakistan, South Asia as a whole besides Iran, Central Asian republics and parts of Africa where one could hear echoes of Osama's militant Islamic teachings with varying effects.
<br /><br />Not that the majority of Muslims are or were willing takers of what the Saudi fugitive billionaire preached or stood for. Still, he caught on the imagination of the frustrated, the humiliated jobless young Muslims grounded in madrassa roots who, rightly or wrongly, feel that they have nothing to lose and everything to gain with Osama-blessed gun power. The operative word of Osama has been jehad against all shades of 'kafirs'. And death in terror acts is supposed to take them directly to heaven. What could have been more alluring than this gospel?
<br /><br />Be that as it may. The current global order is not going to change overnight. The process of change is bound to be slow and halting since the present players on the anti-terror job - from President Obama and his team to Pakistan army chief General Parvez Kayani to President Karzai of Afghanistan and NATO countries have their own politico-strategic agendas and priorities. India too needs to have its own perspective if it wishes to take on Islamic terrorism minus the old mindset.
<br /><br />As it is, in the Afghanistan-Pakistan region, there are various terrorist groups which work at cross purposes and for different masters. Osama's al-Qaeda might have lost its sheen in the Arab world but it is still held in awe. Pakistan has its own favourite terror groups, especially the Pasthu dominated Taliban faction. The Taliban group is also active in Pakistan. In this complex setting, we need to constantly remember that the tribals are traditionally warring groups. This makes the American task difficult for any anti-terror operation.
<br /><br />We also know about Pakistan's ambition to establish its supremacy in the mineral rich strategic region of Afghanistan and exit of Osama will not make any substantial difference in the AfPak belt, at least in the near future.
<br /><br />In this explosive setting, things are going to be equally worrying for India which wishes to see emergence of a peaceful and stable neighbour. It also wants to promote economic and related interests in Afghanistan. There cannot be any ready answer to the current mess. A lot will depend on how the US conducts itself and how Pakistan behaves vis a vis India.
<br /><br />As already stated, there are no shortcuts to fighting terrorism. This is a long drawn-out battle which has to be waged with determination and courage. Ironically, the US as a super power can do anything it wishes to in any part of the world including striking at terrorist camps. But it has said a blunt 'no' to use of the same option to India for reasons unexplained.
<br /><br />What is not being realized by American policy-makers is that in the absence of concerted and coordinated efforts they are, consciously or unconsciously, generating new forms of fundamentalism and extremists not only in Pakistan and Afghanistan but in other parts of the world as well. Herein lies a major challenge for democratic regimes like India.
<br /><br />It will be worth recalling here that Karl Marx and Lenin gave the world a new ideology to demolish the edifice of capitalism. However, the Soviet regime collapsed under the weight of its own dictatorial traits. Apparently, the followers of Marx and Lenin failed to account for human characteristics and weaknesses. They, of course, put a stop to sate sponsored religious shows. Things have changed dramatically since then.
<br /><br />We cannot yet be certain about the fallout from Osama's exit. All the same, I do not wish to see post bin-Laden terror threat as part of the clash of civilisations. Islam is not what its misguided promoters are propagating. It is a fact that certain teachings of the prophet and the Quran have been taken out of context to push hate-concepts and violence by vested interests.
<br /><br />Well, enough is enough. We do not wish to see a new form of bloodshed in the name of Islam and possible retaliation by the democratic forces. In the long run, the believers in democracy have to come together and work unitedly at the policy level as well as on the ground. Unless this is done, the battle against militant forces will be lop-sided and misplaced. President Obama ought to keep this basic fact constantly in mind if he means business and learns to evolve better trust equations with a democratic country like India.
<br /><br />Washington ought to draw appropriate lessons from the Gitmo files, WikiLeaks revelations and the documents and videos seized from Osama's Abbottabad mansion. They clearly establish that anti-India terror operations were being directed by Pakistani army officials and inter-services Intelligence Directorate. Even anti-India training camps in Pakistan are run by the army and ISI. Indeed, several terror groups like Lashkar-e-Toiba, Jamaat-Ud-Dawa and Hizbul Mujahideen have enjoyed direct support from the Pakistan army and ISI.
<br /><br />We ought to take into account these basic facts and overall complexity of the situation in totality and work out counter-terrorism strategies keeping in view Pakistan's jehadi face.
<br /><br />The Abbottabad-like operation apart, the democratic regimes need to take the challenge of Islamic terrorism as a battle of ideas. The objective should be to wean away the misguided youth from the terror path and bring them into the mainstream of modern education, economic well-being and better job prospects.
<br /><br />The only answer to jehad is an all-inclusive comprehensive development agenda with a human face. This is not an easy proposition, but it is worth trying since the global stakes are high for peace, development and stability. Even the Muslim leaders ought to learn from the middle Eastern and North African states, including Egypt, Yemen, Libya and Bahrain. Even Saudi Arabia has clear signs of unrest. The youth in these countries are not for jehad but for better economic deals and jobs. The underlying message is clear: the world of tomorrow has to be seen and assessed against Osama's disastrous jehadi phenomenon.

		<document id="2fb15cfe76dc46d56534f7539fc59d10" url=""><![CDATA[Kashmir Is Confident, To Continue Confidence Building<br/><br/>The summer, this year, has ushered in a confident Jammu and Kashmir. The law and order situation has been peaceful, the tourists have arrived in the Valley in large numbers, the infiltration from across the Line of Control has been at a twenty-year low, and the Government of India continued discussing confidence building measures with Pakistan during last week's foreign secretary-level talks.
<br /><br />The Indian delegation led by Foreign Secretary Nirupama Rao did not display any allergy when the &quot;K&quot; word came up at the talks.
<br /><br />The delegations reportedly spent nearly four hours discussing the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5oaW1hbGF5YW5hZmZhaXJzLm9yZy8_" target="_blank">Kashmir terrorism</a>. The confidence building measures are expected to result in a liberalized visa agreement, increase in trade and travel across the Line of Control (LOC) and better banking linkages.
<br /><br />It has been noticed that there was a suggestion from Chief Minister Omar Abdullah and the leader of the All Party Hurriyat Conference Mirwaiz Umar Farooq that the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5oaW1hbGF5YW5hZmZhaXJzLm9yZy8_" target="_blank">Kashmir crisis</a> should be discussed with Pakistan.
<br /><br />Only hardliner Syed Ali Shah Geelani felt that discussions with Pakistan were a waste of time.  The Omar Abdullah government has taken several positive steps that have enabled the Central and State Governments to look forward to a peaceful summer after two years of violence during the tourist season.
<br /><br />There have been significant changes. The Panchayat elections in the State have seen massive participation. The State Government has indicated that it is committed to implement devolution of maximum amount of power to the grassroots. Steps are afoot to set up a State Finance Commission that will help devolve financial powers to the newly elected bodies.
<br /><br />The allocation of Rs.6, 600 crores as the annual plan outlay for Kashmir – 600 crores more this year -- is expected to spur development in the State. Moreover Rs.1, 200 crores will be received by the State under the Prime Minister’s reconstruction programme.
<br /><br />The Planning Commission has suggested that some initiatives should be taken to further improve public private partnership in the development of both physical and social infrastructure.
<br /><br />Significantly, the controversy as to whether there would be a 'rotation' in the government has been set to rest. Home Minister Chidambaram, who reviewed the security situation, said on June 21, that the Centre and the Congress are happy with Chief Minister Omar Abdullah and there will be no rotational chief minister in the State. &quot;Everybody in the Central Government is happy with Omar as Chief Minister. I make it clear that there will no rotation.&quot;
<br /><br />Chidambaram also noticed that the security situation has improved in the Valley and one does not find the army in civilian areas like Srinagar city. It is confined to the barracks and the borders only. He drove around downtown Srinagar to feel the real situation.
<br /><br />Commander of the 15 Corps Lt.-Gen S. A. Hasnain also reviewed the security situation and disclosed that so far no infiltration has taken place this year. Two attempts by militants to sneak into Kashmir were foiled. He said: &quot;This is for the first time that infiltration has come down to zero in last 20 years.&quot;
<br /><br />One hopes that the peaceful environment would spur tourism and economic activities, which would result in increased employment. The paramilitary forces are expected to recruit over 3000 youth this year.
<br /><br />The Amarnath yatra has already commenced. The government has to deploy additional battalions of paramilitary forces, which would return to their barracks soon after.
<br /><br />It is expected that the committee appointed by the State Government to consider the withdrawal of the Armed Forces Special Powers Act from certain areas of the State where security scenario has improved, would submit its recommendations soon. One also expects that the group of interlocutors comprising noted journalist Dileep Padgaonkar, Prof Radha Kumar and M.M. Ansari, would submit its final report to the Central Government.
<br /><br />Looking back, the violence during the last two summers were largely due to elements working against the State to neutralize the massive participation of the people—61.47 percent -- in the Assembly elections in 2008.
<br /><br />Steps taken by the State Government to deal with lumpen elements and the reaction of the majority of the people who are keen to maintain peace towards the activities of separatists and their over-ground workers has succeeded in improving the situation in the Valley.
<br /><br />The stage is now set for meetings between the foreign ministers of India and Pakistan next month. And India would not be shying away from the &quot;K&quot; word during those talks.

Always wary of India's military might, Pakistan looks towards Afghanistan and the Central Asian Republics (CAR) as land masses that can meet its most significant strategic requirement. This has been the primary reason for its assisting Afghanistan during the Russian invasion and establishing a cordial relation with the Taliban regime, which was otherwise a pariah for the world community. Even now, Pakistan is maneuvering to position itself as the sole military arbitrator for Afghanistan post the imminent withdrawal of the NATO forces for the same reason. More importantly, it does not want to see India playing a significant role in the strategic affairs of Afghanistan.
<br /><br />The doctrine of strategic depth was fine tuned during the dictatorship of Zia-ul-Haq. His penchant for using militants, terrorists and other non-state actors for political effect was used liberally in giving shape to this doctrine. The fact that the Taliban emerged victorious in the post Russian regime gave yet another boost to the policy conceived by Zia-ul-Haq.  The government of Pakistan, under Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, extended recognition to the Taliban regime in Afghanistan on May 25, 1997, almost immediately after the government was established.  The Taliban government of Afghanistan responded by giving all possible consideration to Pakistan's security concerns. Thus during the period of 1990's, Pakistan made very effective use of militants, terrorists and the Taliban to wage a proxy/asymmetric war against India especially so in Kashmir. This was also the golden period in application of its policy of strategic depth.
<br /><br />All this was done without giving a thought to the long term effect that it would have on Pakistan's society, culture, and survival as a nation state. Apparently, short-term gains outweighed long-term considerations in the calculations of Pakistani decision-makers. That this policy was inherently flawed was pointed out by a number of eminent security analysts and experts both within and outside Pakistan. However, the idea of strategic depth was so deeply embedded in the Pakistani psyche that such sane advice could not motivate the leadership to consider its modification let alone a total withdrawal. Even the change in environment post the 9/11 attack on the World Trade Centre in the US and the resultant Global War on Terror (GWOT) of which Pakistan became an active partner, did not bring about a paradigm shift in the basic policy of the country.
<br /><br />While the Pakistan Army, under the leadership of a military dictator, involved itself in GWOT both logistically and operationally the relationship with non state actors was kept alive on the side through the infamous ISI. The result was total ambivalence in the definition of friend and foe with the roles being switched with comparative ease. This led to the evolution of lopsided policies like compartmentalising of militants into good and bad Taliban, striking a number of deals and counters deals, creation and break up of alliances, attacks and standoffs etc. Some militants were sheltered, others were set up for drone attacks or handed over to the US - this double game has been on ever since GWOT was launched. It was the common man of the war torn North West Frontier Province who came out as the worst sufferer from this warped policy.
<br /><br />Instability breeds anarchy and this became a bane for Pakistan on its western frontier. India Pakistan is such a matter where fundamentalist ideology started gaining ascendency and religious zealots started weaning away youth from the mainstream. Full use of media and communication means was made by the fundamentalists to achieve this objective.  Radios, websites, newspapers, periodicals, pamphlets, posters and banners besides the most potent electronic media were used to the hilt to spread the word. This phenomenon assisted the Islamist fundamentalists in creating a very formidable and dominant constituency amongst the people.
<br /><br />While the Pakistani Army, the government and the ISI continued with their policy of denial and two timing, the militants started closing ranks and establishing their writ. Such activity invariably attracts funding and wherewithal which started flowing in to convert the groups into miniature armies and the leaders into war lords. Alliances both strategic and ideological were made between the various groups to establish the religious authority of Jihad. The networked organisations set about planning attacks not only in the tribal areas of Pakistan and Afghanistan but also in India. Who can forget the visage of Baitullah Mehsud or Maulana Fazlullah also known as Mullah Radio amongst a host of others, who can forget the 26/11 terrorist attack in Mumbai which continues to haunt Indo-Pakistan relations?
<br /><br />A situation has now come about where Pakistan, due to its fallacious policies has started facing isolation in the world community.  Its leadership has lost the distinction between friend and foe, good or bad and is hurtling down a tunnel of despondency. The monster created by the Pakistani State is now ready to devour its masters and threat is now permeating from the source that was created to counter the same. The policy put in place to create strategic depth has turned out to be a strategic blunder.
<br /><br />There is a way out, Pakistan has to get over its fear of being overwhelmed by India’s might and clout as a regional power and convert its potential into a source of strength. It is time for Pakistan to look at India to provide to it strategic depth against its western neighbours rather than the other way round. This would require a paradigm shift in the existing which, unfortunately, is easier said than done. It is difficult to shed inhibitions and insecurities that have been nurtured for decades, but there seems to be no other way by which Pakistan can get out of the mess that it has landed itself into.

		<document id="fb153dbcd908f472739ae6027be0f30b" url=""><![CDATA[Pakistan using Taliban against India as its strategic arm<br/><br/>Pakistan's military thinking has perennially focused on the creation of strategic depth against India. Having failed to achieve that with its Afghan policy, Pak is now pursuing it in another way- by sending in hordes of trained &amp; armed militants &amp; jehadis into India through Kashmir &amp; other porous borders. Actually it's been doing that since the last 60 years- only difference is that now the focus is on them- possibly because of India's growing friendship with the US-or the world's growing disenchantment with Pakistan- post the Osama Bin Laden Fiasco. Recent events as outlined below quantify this charge. 20,000 rally over Kashmir, call for jihad, nuclear war against India-As per latest reports, Pakistan based extremist leaders, including Jamaat-ud-Dawah (JuD) chief Hafiz Saeed, have stepped up calls for jihad against India, even advocating the use of nuclear weapons if needed in the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5oaW1hbGF5YW5hZmZhaXJzLm9yZy8_" target="_blank">Kashmir war</a>. These vicious comments came at a massive rally organised by Jamaat-ud-Dawah to mark the Kashmir Solidarity Day-at a time when both countries are trying to find ways to revive the peace process. 
<br /><br />JuD deputy chief, Abdur Rehman Makki, also demanded that Pakistan's Prime Minister set up an independent ministry for the jihad in Kashmir. &quot;The JuD will provide the budget for this ministry, if (the PM) accepts our proposal,&quot; he said. Offering to provide one million trained fighters to wage the jihad, Makki called on the Pakistan army chief to provide Kalashnikovs for these fighters. 
<br /><br />Pakistan's Taliban claims 3,000 terrorists ready for battle against India- As per a Taliban spokesperson in Islamabad, Azam Tariq, the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan(TTP) has declared it is training terrorists to launch an attack on India. &quot;India is our jageer (domain),&quot; Tariq said, &quot;and we will attack to take possession of it. We are training lots of fighters and suicide bombers who will be used for this purpose.&quot; He added the Taliban would fight a &quot;decisive' battle&quot; in <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5oaW1hbGF5YW5hZmZhaXJzLm9yZy8_" target="_blank">India Pakistan</a> before proceeding towards the Middle East, presumably to evict Israel from that region. After taking control of Pakistan and Afghanistan, the TTP spokesperson said the Taliban would move towards India. &quot;For us, whether they are Hindus or Jews, they all are the same&quot;, he added. &quot;Soon, we will teach India a lesson. India's defeat at the hands of the Mujahedeen is written in our religious books,&quot; he boasted. &quot;There are around 3,000 trained suicide bombers with the TTP. Others are undergoing training. We are not preparing them for Pakistan, but for our real target-occupation of India,&quot; Tariq further said. 
<br /><br />Such vitriolic comments emanating from Pakistan only cement India's oft-repeated plea-that the jehadis &amp; the Taliban are being used by the Pak army against India- at will ! Jehdias: The Saudi foot soldiers- Going into the history of this phenomenon, we see that the jehadis, who are now the foot soldiers of the Pakistani military, draw their succour from Saudi Arabia, that promotes the virulent Wahhabi form of Sunni Islam. Any Sunni Muslim group willing to promote Wahhabism-whether through acts of terror, or through Wahhabi education in madrassas, or through peaceful preaching-gets generous aid from Riyadh and elsewhere in the Gulf. In Pakistan, the Saudis use the first two methods. Madrassas were set up in the 1980s in a concentrated way to train jihadis and suicide bombers to capture Kabul after the Soviet army left and US interest in Afghanistan waned. The Pakistani military, found to their delight, that these madrassa graduates were highly useful manpower to capture a divided Afghanistan in the midst of civil war. It was thus Saudi money, the madrassa-trained jihadis and the Pakistani military that created the Afghan-Taliban. But the primary interest of the Pakistan military, even before it was infested with jihadis, was to keep India out of Afghanistan. To that end, Pakistani strategists continued to perpetrate the hoax, that in Pakistan's security interests, Afghanistan must be controlled. The Indian bogie was also at the centre of Pakistan's weaponization. Pakistan's nuclear programme was sought to be sold around the world as a deterrent against potential Indian aggression. 
<br /><br />Simultaneously, the Pakistani military brass, who were beneficiaries of arms and cash transfers from the United States during the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, reached out to the jehadis, included them in their midst, and considered the whole as a tactically suitable arrangement. They found that no one, no ordinary Pakistani, was as committed and as driven against &quot;Hindu India&quot; as these jehadis- they came from far and near, and all they wanted was what the Wahhabis demanded- which was to impose Sharia. It was their anti-India zeal that the Pakistani military liked the most. During this interim period, the Pakistani military also used the national treasury and Saudi cash to set up hardcore anti-India terrorists. Concurrently, Islamabad worked on one other strategy-to create a condition that would force India to engage in a war with Pakistan. Such a development would then help further the cause of the jehadis, almost the way the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 led to their proliferation decades later. So initially, Pakistan put up a front office for the Americans that was devoid of jehadis. But in the backyard, the jehadis were assembling. The recent Mehran base attack shows that the back-office uniformed jihadis of Pakistan are now pretty much calling the shots.
<br /><br />Hardening of Strategy- The Zia Era -This doctrine was further fine tuned during the Zia era. is penchant for using terrorists and other non-state actors for political effect was used liberally in giving shape to this cause. During the1990's, Pakistan made effective use of militants to wage a proxy/asymmetric war against India, especially so in Kashmir. All this was done without giving a thought to the long term effect that it would have on Pakistan's society, culture, and survival as a nation state. Apparently, short-term gains outweighed long-term considerations in the calculations of Pakistani decision-makers. The idea of strategic depth was so deeply embedded in the Pakistani psyche that even the change in environment post the 9/11 attack did not bring about a paradigm shift in their basic policy.
<br /><br />So, while the Army involved itself in the GWOT both logistically and operationally, the relationship with non state actors was kept alive on the side, through the infamous ISI. The result was total ambivalence in the definition of friend and foe, with the roles being switched with comparative ease. This led to the evolution of lopsided policies like compartmentalising of militants into `good and bad Taliban', striking deals and counter- deals, creation and break up of alliances, attacks and standoffs etc. Some militants were sheltered, while others were set up as targets for American drones or handed over to the US - this double game has been on ever since. Sadly, it was the common man of the war torn North West Frontier Province who came out as the worst sufferer from this warped policy. 
<br /><br />Options for India- This development means that India will now have to prepare itself against a permanent enemy. That is not to say that this enemy will operate only from outside, which it will; if it hasn't already, it will also build nests within India. 
<br /><br />Once the Afghanistan war comes to an end or stalemates with the bulk of foreign forces withdrawn, the jehadis will focus against India, a potentially vulnerable target. The 26/11 carnage in Mumbai, in particular, made it evident that they have facilitators within India and elsewhere.
<br /><br />We know that all by themselves, the jehadis would not be able to cause much harm to India. Over recent decades, a non-jehadi but anti-India Pakistani military working hand-in-glove with the jehadis did some damage, but it was contained. However, a jehadi Pakistani military working with jehadi-terrorists, with a single-minded focus on harming 
<br /><br />India, is quite a proposition to deal with. We better be prepared- or lese we'll have hell to pay !!

		<document id="224ec9eb84878adc86ff0cf49e2ca7c8" url=""><![CDATA[Pak Army's Afghan Strategy Cause Of Concern For India<br/><br/> As US forces are expected to thin out from Afghanistan, revelations in recently assassinated journalist Syed Salim Shahzad's book, Inside Al-Qaeda and the Taliban (Pluto Press and Palgrave Macmillan, marketed by Pentagon Press, India) and Pakistan Army's recent actions to subjugate Afghanistan are raising India's anxieties as reflected in think-tanks' discussions. 
<br /><br />Syed Saleem Shahzad became the 37th journalist killed in Pakistan since the 9/11 attacks, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. His waterlogged body retrieved from a canal 60 miles from Islamabad, bore 17 lacerated wounds delivered by a blunt instrument, a ruptured liver and two broken ribs.
<br /><br />An investigative journalist contributing to Asia Times Online, who used to write articles exposing the relationship between the militants and the military, Shahzad, had written scathing reports about the infiltration of militants into Pakistan's military.
<br /><br />A New York daily quoted White House officials, who now believe that Pakistan's Inter Services Intelligence (ISI) ordered the killing of Shahzad, confirming the allegation made in media a few weeks ago. Classified intelligence obtained both before Shahzad's disappearance on 29 May and after discovery of his body showed that senior officials of ISI directed the attack in order to silence criticism. Yet another senior US official was reported to have said that there was enough other intelligence and indicators immediately after Shahzad's death to conclude that the ISI had ordered the killing. &quot;Every indication is that this was a deliberate, targeted killing that was most likely meant to send shock waves through Pakistan's journalist community and civil society,&quot; said the official.
<br /><br />The anger over his death followed unprecedented questioning in the media about the professionalism of Pakistan army and the ISI in the aftermath of the US raid that led to the killing of Osama Bin Laden.
<br /><br />Dr Lal Khan, in his book The Pakistan's Other Story, released in October 2009, wrote that to look at the Pakistan Army solely as the instrument of the ruling class would mean ignoring the real contradictions that had developed within it. Top military brass were involved directly in the economy, both the legal and the &quot;black economy&quot;, including drug running. The heroin pipeline in the 1980s could not have operated without the knowledge, if not connivance, of officials at the highest level of the army, the government and the CIA. Everyone chose to ignore it for the larger task that was to defeat erstwhile Soviet Union. Drugs control was on nobody’s agenda. In this orgy of destruction and loot, while General Ziaul Haq and his coterie of generals amassed huge amounts of black money, they were not content with the black capital coming from the drugs trade because they had to share this drug money with the different warlords, constantly changing loyalties, and the leaders of different Islamic fundamentalist parties and Islamic mercenary outfits involved in this reactionary insurgency. Hence, Dr. Khan claims, they also started smuggling the most advanced US weaponry for the jihad through the Pakistani supply lines under the auspices of the sections of the Pakistan Army involved in this CIA-planned operation. “There are reports that there is a burning hatred amongst the ranks of the army against the top brass amassing this mammoth wealth. Their perks, their privileges and their plunder have rekindled class hatred amongst the soldiers towards the officer caste. The lower ranking officers are also in a desperate psychological state. The war being fought for US imperialism has led to a rapid rise in the number of desertions within the army. Morale is very low and it is not an accident that the Pakistani military outfits are losing their battles in the tribal areas. It is for these reasons that general Kayani has given wage rises and other privileges to the lower ranks and soldiers. They are rapidly withdrawing army officers from civilian posts where a lot of them had been deployed during the Musharraf regime”, Dr. Khan wrote.
<br /><br />According to Ashley Tellis, the daring raid that killed Osama Bin Laden marked a turning point not only in U.S-Pakistan ties but also in power relations within <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5oaW1hbGF5YW5hZmZhaXJzLm9yZy8_" target="_blank">India Pakistan</a>. Most observers have focused on the first, but have failed to understand how worsening civil-military relations in Pakistan have contributed to the recent meltdown between Washington and Islamabad. “The shock that the United States could discover Bin Laden from thousands of miles away in a cantonment town, when he was overlooked by the military and its powerful intelligence services, confronted the Pakistani public with one of two possibilities: either their army was malicious, harboring an enemy whose allies were ravaging Pakistan every day, or it was incompetent, incapable of its discharging its principal task of protecting the nation. In either case, the Bin Laden affair raised the fundamental question of why such a military was offered preferential access to the public trough given its debilitating failures. The ease with which homegrown insurgents were able to attack a major Pakistani naval base, even as the intelligence services, for all their fecklessness, were widely suspected of torturing and killing a prominent Pakistani journalist who had uncovered connections between the deep state and extremists, filled the Pakistani populace with dismay and revulsion…Not since the disastrous Kargil war of 1999 has the army's reputation fallen so low. In a praetorian state, a loss of credibility is a threat to survival—and, hence, the Pakistani army struck back resolutely and early”, stated Tellis.
<br /><br />In June 2011, Pakistan army launched a series of missile and artillery attacks on Kunar and Nangarhar provinces in eastern Afghanistan, killing dozens of civilians. The missile attacks were accompanied by raids by the Pakistani Taliban, which is backed by the Pakistan army. On July 2, 2011, Defence Minister Abdul Rahim Wardak said in Afghan parliament that two Pakistani helicopters entered the Afghan territory. On July 5, 2011, Afghan border police commander Aminullah Amarkhel reported that hundreds of fighters from the Pakistani Taliban crossed the border into Afghanistan's Nuristan province, where they attacked police outposts and torched homes.
<br /><br />The Afghan foreign ministry expressed concern, warning Pakistan that &quot;the continuation of such incidents could adversely affect the spirit of improving the trust and cooperation between the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan and the Islamic Republic of Pakistan.&quot; Afghan lawmakers strongly condemned the Pakistani missile attacks, describing them as an &quot;invasion&quot; and as a reflection of Pakistan's &quot;dishonesty&quot; in its bilateral talks with the Afghan government, meant to strengthen the Afghanistan peace process. Criticizing the Karzai government for its silence over the missile attacks, Afghan lawmaker Farhad Azimi is reported to have said: &quot;I want to ask government officials as to why they call Pakistan a friend when it fires missiles into Afghanistan.&quot;
<br /><br />Afghanistan's intelligence service National Directorate of Security (NDS), accused the Pakistan military of being behind the missile attacks. NDS Spokesman Lotfullah Mashal told reporters that Pakistan has long been operating in secret to destabilize Afghanistan by backing the Taliban in the Pakistani tribal regions, &quot;but this time the Pakistani Army is taking its [military] intervention further, through heavily shelling Afghanistan in [broad] daylight.&quot; Afghan President Hamid Karzai referred to the attacks for the first time only on June 26, slamming Pakistan for firing 470 missiles into Afghanistan’s eastern provinces. A July 4, 2011 resolution of the Afghan parliament, which urged the UN Security Council and the Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC) to mount diplomatic pressure on Pakistan, described the Pakistani attacks in Kunar, Nangarhar, Khost and Paktia provinces as an &quot;act of invasion&quot; by Pakistan.
<br /><br />Responding to the accusations, the Pakistani army denied targeting Afghanistan. Army spokesman Maj.-Gen. Athar Abbas said: &quot;Rounds were fired for engaging the fleeing militants and there is a possibility that some may have accidentally gone across the border.&quot; 
<br /><br />The June attacks were not Pakistan's first use of force against Afghanistan this year. In early February, Pakistani planes bombarded Afghan Border Police posts and civilians' homes in Afghanistan's Nangarhar and Khost provinces. 
<br /><br />Pakistan's military campaign to control Afghanistan has been accompanied by the expulsion of U.S. and British military and intelligence officials from Pakistan. According to an April 21 report in the Pakistani media, some 500 CIA personnel were told to leave Pakistan in the beginning of this year. In late June, Pakistani Defense Minister Chaudhry Ahmed Mukhtar revealed that Pakistan has asked the CIA to leave the Shamsi airbase in Pakistan’s Baluchistan province, from which drones are dispatched to monitor and attack the Taliban safe havens in the Pakistani tribal region. In addition, 18 British military trainers have been told to leave.
<br /><br />On April 16, 2011, the entire top Pakistani leadership (except for President Asif Zardari) descended on Kabul for bilateral talks with the Afghan leaders. According to reports in the Afghan media, Pakistani Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani presented Karzai with a set of written demands: Afghanistan must sever its relationship with the U.S. and forge ties with China; keep Pakistan informed on the training and number of the Afghan security forces; appoint Pakistani officials to Afghan government institutions; and clarify Pakistan's share in Afghan mining and development projects; in addition, future Afghan governments must implement Pakistani strategies, and Pakistan must be made aware of any agreement between Afghanistan and its Western allies, including the U.S. and NATO.

		<document id="aa354eb2c6e15ee4db59ebdc4cb378a2" url=""><![CDATA[Changing Relations Between China And Pakistan<br/><br/>“Higher than the mountains, deeper than the oceans, sweeter than honey, stronger than steel, all-weather and time-tested” said - Masood Khan, Pakistan Diplomat, 2009. The statement reflects the time old relationship between China and Pakistan. Nevertheless, the unfolding of relationship between Pakistan and China over the issue of Pakistan’s hand in violence in Xingjian will be of strategic importance to India. 
<br /><br />It is the first time that China accused its closest ally for unrest in one of its important province--Xingjian. 
<br /><br />Xingjian is largest region of China sharing borders with Kazakhstan, Kyrgystan, Mongolia, Pakistan and Afghanistan. Its geographical location makes it an important region of China. 
<br /><br />This region has huge natural reserves, particularly of oil which China is planning to utilize. China cannot afford to lose control of this region due to strategic and economic reasons. As a result, China may take a strong position with regard to Pakistan’s involvement in Xingjian province.
<br /><br />In the midst of these allegations, the ISI Chief Gen Shuja Pasha paid an urgent visit to China. This visit had two main purposes.<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5oaW1hbGF5YW5hZmZhaXJzLm9yZw__" target="_blank">India Pakistan</a> is very often issue seen by every where. First, Pakistan relationship with the US were strained over the issue of terrorism. Pakistan might be looking towards China for its international support. Second, Pakistan wanted to convince China that it will cooperate with it to prevent terrorism in its region. 
<br /><br />This visit showed clearly that Pakistan could not afford to lose its ‘all weather friend’ particularly when its relationship with the US were not going well. However, China may face a tricky time while pressurizing Pakistan to deal with terrorism. Pakistan has a history of making visits and promises to deal with the issue of terrorism and to punish the defaulters. However, it has never implemented this in practice.
<br /><br />Therefore, it is clear that Pakistan government is unable to check terrorism in its own country. The recent operation of the US against Osama Bin Laden clearly shows that Pakistan provides sanctuary to terrorist and their activities.  Pakistan has faced lot of criticism from rest of the world for its policies; while China shows full faith and confidence in Pakistan’s security policy. 
<br /><br />No doubt, China is a close ally of Pakistan and both countries always work together to counterbalance India in South Asian region. 
<br /><br />China was responsible for bringing nuclear threat to India’s neighborhood. China has always helped Pakistan’s nuclear and missile programme. Recently, China concluded a nuclear deal with Pakistan on the lines of India-US nuclear deal. China showed its plans to help Pakistan to expand its Chasma nuclear energy complex in Punjab by building two reactors. China stressed on its cooperation despite all international objections and concerns regarding threat of looming nuclear terrorism in Pakistan. 
<br /><br />It’s high time that China should understand that terrorism knows no boundary and no religion. Pakistan plays an important part in China’s strategic calculations. However, China should change its policy of downplaying Pakistan’s terrorist threat. China should learn from mistakes of the US who faced the wrath of Taliban in Afghanistan which were its own creation during cold war period. This event showed that terrorism from Pakistan could travel into China easily. China will definitely face the heat of all kinds of threats coming from Pakistan as it also shares border with it. Therefore, China should change its policy of downplaying Pakistan’s threat. India should not lose time to use China’s recent sensitivities against Pakistan’s terrorism and should make China aware of its nuclear dimension. The unfolding of strategic triangle in South Asia can be turned in India’s favor if diplomacy is used effectively.

		<document id="84d1ce615406492195b2ec9f3e588a12" url=""><![CDATA[Terrorism is on the wane in J&K<br/><br/>Four top Hizbul Mujahideen (HM) terrorists surrendered before the security forces in Kulgam district on August, 18, in what is the biggest surrender in this year. Those who have surrendered include a Divisional Commander of the outfit, Mohammad Rafiq Sheikh alias Basharat, resident of Neoch, Mahore; Bashir Ahmad alias Rashid, also resident of Neoch, Mahore; Mohammad Maqbool alias Majid resident of Lar, Mahore and Mohammad Shafi alias Haroon Rashid resident of Deval, Mahore.  The surrendered terrorists handed over two AK-47 rifles, seven magazines, an under barrel grenade launcher, five under barrel grenades, 118 AK rounds, one wireless set, one mobile phone, one battery and three pouches to the police.
<br /><br />Mahore a small township of Reasi, District Udhampur; it has been a hub of militancy and terrorism for a long time. Being Muslim dominated in an otherwise Hindu dominated area, it witnessed a sustained attempt by terrorists to weed out the minority community. A number of preplanned massacres and selective killings aimed at creating fear among Hindus and forcing them to migrate took place over here during the peak periods of militancy. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5oaW1hbGF5YW5hZmZhaXJzLm9yZw__" target="_blank">India Pakistan</a> is a little bit different. These terrorist activities caused an acute sense of insecurity amongst the minority community.  For example, on June 4, 2001, and on August, 01, 2001 there were determined attacks to massacre civilians. Alertness of the Village Defence Committee (VDC) members foiled the move; another incident in the same month involved the shooting of two young girls, who due to their timely shifting to Jammu survived. The gunning down five members of three Hindu families at Thandi Behak, about 5 kms from Mahore is yet another sad chapter in the violent history of the area.
<br /><br />This area has traditionally been dominated by the terrorist cadre of the HM, especially so the Pir Panjal Regiment {HM (PPR)} of the outfit. Kashmir crisis A large number of the cadre had received training in Pakistan as was the case with Mohammad Rafiq Sheikh who has now surrendered after attaining the coveted post of Divisional Commander within the outfit. He had received training in Pakistan from 1992 to 1995 after which he had been inducted back and had been operating in the area for the last sixteen years.  After the killing of a terrorist called Badshah Khan he was appointed as a District Commander with another terrorist called Saddam was the Divisional Commander. Later Saddam was also killed in an operation and Sheikh went on to become the Divisional Commander with Reasi, Ramban and Kulgam in his control. The second surrendered terrorist Bashir Ahmed has also active since the year 2000; Mohammad Safi joined up in 2009 while Mohammad Maqbool has been in the line only for one year.
<br /><br />The fact that two of the surrendered terrorists had been in the fold of the HM for a short period of time indicates the complete lack of faith in the organisation amongst the locals who only a few years back, were attracted towards it in hordes to respond to the call of Jihad. Now the strength of the terrorist who have received training and indoctrination across the border is nearing zero. Those who have been motivated locally have neither the commitment nor the will to sustain for a long period of time, they get lured by money more than ideology and when the heat turns on them they simply wilt under the pressure. 
<br /><br />This surrender has come as a major blow to the already beleaguered HM and HM (PPR) and it seems that the presence of the outfit has been literally wiped out in Reasi. This is a major achievement for the government, the security forces and most of all the people of the region.  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5oaW1hbGF5YW5hZmZhaXJzLm9yZw__" target="_blank">pakistan india kashmir</a> is such a valuable topic.
<br /><br />A number of factors are responsible for this turn of events. Overall it was the total rejection of the cult of the gun and the joining together of all communities to fight the common menace of terrorism that led to a change in the environment.  Foremost in this regard is the bond between the people and the security forces. This bond led to the successful creation of VDC’s and the passage of timely intelligence to the security forces which, in turn, led to precision eradication of the terrorists in the region. 
<br /><br />Good governance and a stable government also made a major contribution. The people now see a silver lining in the cloud and they wish to become a part of the development process, this has been most aptly indicated by the huge turnout in elections, especially so, in the recently held Panchayat polls when people showed their favour for devolution of power to the grass roots level, something unheard of just a few years back. The surrender and amnesty policy most vigorously pursued by Chief Minister Omar Abdullah has also been responsible in motivating local terrorists to shun the path of violence and opt for rehabilitation under the generous dispensation of the policy. They have, in no small measure, been motivated towards this path by their families.
<br /><br />It is now important to maintain the process of normalcy. While following the route of prosperity and development due attention has to be paid to maintain pressure on the remnants of terrorism while also ensuring that the scourge does not raise its evil head once again. It has to be kept in mind that forces across the border will not lose a single opportunity, however bleak, to revive terrorism in the region. Hence, sustained vigilance by the security forces and the connect between the people, the soldier and onwards the government has to be kept alive and ticking. We have reason to celebrate but vigil cannot be compromised.

Our armed forces deserve a huge round of applause for their feat.
<br /><br />In order to carry out relief operations in areas rendered inaccessible due to the powerful quake, the Army during September 23-24 deployed over 100 troops of its Special Forces in Sikkim. The Army’s Para Special Forces deployed in nearby locations were brought to Bagdogra and then flown to totally cut-off regions in North Sikkim by Mi-17 choppers. The Special Forces troops carried with them special equipment, including climbing gear, to reach inaccessible regions and rescued stranded civilians as well as military personnel.
<br /><br />However, with a portion of a mountain caving in and many areas completely ravaged, the Army took some time to open the road from Tung up to Lanchen and Lachung in North Sikkim. The 6.8-magnitude quake had cut off many parts of North Sikkim like Chuntang, Lachen, Lachung and Upper Dzungu. Yet, in five days the Army was able to open about 40 km of the road in question.
<br /><br />The other problem was that the Army was not able to carry out high-intensity blasts because other portions of the mountain in that area were in a brittle condition and could have come down as a result of such blasts. As an officer of the engineering regiment said, “We have to be very careful so that it does not cause more damage to the roads. Moreover, we will have to build new roads and that will take some time” (PTI, September 24, 2011).
<br /><br />But what is most worrying is that Sikkim does not have any Advanced Landing Grounds (ALGs) despite it being stratetegically so important in view of the China factor. The Indian Air Force could have played the desired role in the aftermath of the quake if there had been ALGs. As newspapers quoted sources in the Eastern Air Command, the mobilization could have been faster if the Air Force had been in a position to land AN-32 or similar transport aircraft close to areas like Mangan, Chungthang or Lachung.
<br /><br />The Times of India (September 24, 2011) quoted an official thus: “There are two reasons for this situation. Only recently has New Delhi woken up from its sleep and realized that infrastructure development is required in the Northeast. This shift from its Pakistan-centric approach has led to development of facilities in Assam and Arunachal Pradesh. It may take some more time for infrastructure to be built in North or East Sikkim. The second reason was the Defence Ministry’s logic that these parts of Sikkim should be left largely underdeveloped for ‘strategic’ purposes”. There is apprehension that China may carry out a lightening strike across the Line of Actual Control in North Sikkim. The philosophy is that should such a strike take place and Indian forces be compelled to fall back, the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) should not get access to infrastructure. This may help the PLA to consolidate its position and proceed towards Gangtok and the remaining parts of the country.”
<br /><br />Another officer in the know of things has been quoted thus: “In reality, this is a ridiculous strategy. China is rapidly building infrastructure in the Tibet Autonomous Region. Lack of infrastructure on our side would not deter the PLA from continuing its march towards mainland India. India’s strategy should have been to create infrastructure in Sikkim and create defences to prevent any ambitions by the Chinese to annex the State. It is certainly a matter of concern that no ALGs exist in Sikkim. There are several of them in the high-altitude regions of Arunachal Pradesh where the terrain is not much better.”
<br /><br />It is indeed high time that ALGs were established in Sikkim. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5oaW1hbGF5YW5hZmZhaXJzLm9yZy8_" target="_blank">North East India Peace</a> is not just to come to the aid of people should a high-magnitude quake devastate their lives in the highly quake-prone zone, but also as part of a modern strategy to counter the advances made by China on the other side of the border. This imperative cannot be overemphasized.
<br /><br />Bureaucracy will not be of much help in giving a concrete and pragmatic shape to such strategy. Our bureaucracy, or most of it, still lives in a time-warp, unable or unwilling to evolve in sync with the modern strategic blueprints as worked on by countries like China. Therefore, strategic think tanks, serving and retired armed forces commanders, and eminent structural engineers must be consulted. It is they who are in a better position to suggest ways and means of strategizing areas like Sikkim in view of both their vulnerability to earthquakes and their significance from the point of view of geo-strategic dynamics.
<br /><br />Nevertheless, in the wake of the recent quake in Sikkim, our armed forces have done a wonderful job, proving yet again that when the call is made they are prepared 24 hours to rise to the occasion and serve the nation at their zealous and patriotic best. This has always characterized our soldiers, otherwise accused of so-called human rights violations during counter-insurgency operations even as they are part of such operations due mainly to police inability and inefficiency and even as they are ever ready to lay down their lives to protect the nation’s sovereignty!
<br /><br />Be that as it may, the golden lining is that our valiant armed forces will never fail us, as proven time and again. This thought itself is cause for huge celebration. Jai Hind!

		<document id="be4115dbc41b24fb065138b2502e3a1f" url=""><![CDATA[Azad Kashmir : Neither Azad nor Kashmiri<br/><br/>With the swearing in of Sardar Mohammad Yaqub Khan as President of the so-called “Azad Jammu and Kashmir” (AJK), which is more aptly termed as Pakistan Occupied Kashmir (POK), the ruling Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) has, in accordance with tradition, established its stranglehold on the region. Historically, it is always the ruling party, or a Pakistan Army sponsored party when the country is under military rule, which forms a government in POK. Recently, in a sham which passed off as elections, the PPP, predictably, established a majority in the legislative assembly and installed its senior member, Choudhary Abdul Majeed, as the Prime Minister. Sardar Muhammad Yaqub Khan, an erstwhile member of the All Party Hurriyat Conference, joined the PPP a little before the assembly elections and has been rewarded for his defection by being appointed the President of AJK alias POK. Thus the stranglehold is once again complete. The newly appointed President has not taken too long to establish his intention to toe the PPP line despite being in an apolitical appointment.  In his address after taking oath, he roundly condemned the arrest Ghulam Nabi Fai despite it having been established that Fai was involved in underhand lobbying sponsored by the ISI . He further said that his top priority would be the Kashmir issue as his ancestors had “liberated the territory of Azad Kashmir” and their mission has to be completed, so much for reconciliation.
<br /><br />A different version to the entire ballgame has been presented by Altaf Hussain, the exiled leader of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM), whose ”Mohajir” party members are being selectively targeted in the ongoing violence in Karachi.  In a telephone conversation with Sardar Atique Ahmad Khan, an ex-Prime Minister of POK, the MQM chief said, “Everyone in Pakistan is aware of the fraud in the recent Azad Kashmir elections.” “The current government is authoritarian and not a democratic government,” he added. 
<br /><br />In POK, every action of the civilians is scrutinised by the hawk-eyed army and the ISI. This is because the entire administration is in the hands of the Pakistani army. The army runs the schools, the water department, the power stations, and the transport. Mohammed Mumtaz Khan, a senior leader from Rawalakote has gone on record to state: 'Pakistani army is using POK as a training camp for terrorists, as for development, the area lags behind Jammu &amp; Kashmir by ages, where development had moved at almost the same pace as that of other cities in India.' In POK, no freedom is granted to the media, in fact there is no media at all. Whatever public opinion is there gets squashed immediately. There is no way you can go out and hold a protest march since an action of this nature invites retaliation with firing by troops.
<br /><br />The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRPC) has opined that people in POK have suffered gross violations of their rights, from being continuously 'watched and monitored' by Pakistan's ISI to denial of basic fundamental rights including access to judiciary and fair trial. As per HRPC 'People feel that their and political rights have been infringed under the guise of the Maintenance of Public Order Ordinance, which prohibits activities that are prejudicial to public safety”. The residents of POK lack a constitutional status in Pakistan even more so than the Mohajirs, the Balochis, the Pashtuns and the Sindhis who are now in open revolt against the government seen to be Punjabi (Army) dominant. Presently, there is no semblance of a Nation state in the geographic area which passes off as the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. In this turmoil the biggest victim are the people of POK and Northern Areas who are undergoing rampant colonisation. The recently held elections and the installation of the puppet government has laid the framework of continued exploitation in the long run.
<br /><br />Deep beneath the layer of deceit and blatant opportunism that has enveloped POK since the last six plus decades there is a very palpable disgust for Pakistan. Many in POK, including its large Diaspora in the United Kingdom and other parts of the world, find India's handling of its part of Kashmir more commendable. There is a growing awareness that while India has respected Kashmir's age-old practice of not allowing outsiders to settle down in the valley, Pakistan has allowed over 28,000 Afghan families to settle down and fleece the local populace in the name of Jihad. With regard to socio-economic parameters everyone is aware that Kashmiri’s in the valley are better educated and better skilled due to the better education facilities that are available to them. On the political front, India has held fair elections in the Valley right down to the Panchayat level while the Pakistani government not only indulges of gross manipulation of elections,  it also has the gumption of dismissing installed governments at will. 
<br /><br />Azad Kashmir is neither inhabited largely by Kashmiris nor is it Azad. There are voices of protest coming up; those actively involved in this crusade to obtain justice are Shabir Choudhry's Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front, Abdul Hamid Khan's Balawaristan National Front, All Party National Alliance, Karakoram National Movement, Karakoram Students Organization and Afro-Asian Peoples Solidarity Organization and many others.  These political organisations have, time and again, reiterated their demand for empowering the people of POK and Northern Areas to decide their future both political and economic outside the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. The time has arrived for the world, led by India, to intervene in this highly oppressed region and pressurise the government of Pakistan to pay cognisance to the just demands of the people.

But now- its a reputed American think tank who has said it- that Pakistan’s ISI wants the Taliban to be influential enough within the Afghan government so that it can keep India out. James Dobbins from the Rand Corporation and his colleagues recently visited Pakistan and interacted with ISI officials He is quoted as saying, “What the Pakistanis told us when we were in Islamabad – is that they share our interest in bringing peace, that they want the Afghan Taliban out of Pakistan and back into Afghanistan, but not in a position of dominating the country.”
<br /><br />“But they would like the Taliban sufficiently influential within the Afghan government so that, on the one hand, they have an incentive to stop interfering and get out of Pakistan … And, secondly, that they preserve Pakistani interests in Afghanistan, the principal of which is to keep the India’s RAW away from the Pakistani border-away from dissident elements within Pakistan, particularly in Baluchistan”, Mr Dobbins added.
<br /><br />Dobbins continues, “The other narrative is that they want a sympathetic force to dominate the Afghan government, for the same reason: to prevent it from becoming allied with India, which has far more to offer in terms of economic assistance and commerce”. “They’re going to continue to support the Taliban with that kind of outcome, so that the situation reverts to what they found in the 1990s, and then they possibility can put their clients back in power in Kabul, and in the rest of the country”, he said referring to the interaction with ISI officials in Pakistan, including representatives of the civilian government.
<br /><br />Though President Obama is determined to get out of Afghanistan by 2014, resolution of this war is getting tangled up in one of the world's most stubborn rivalries : India versus Pakistan. Citing India's influence in Afghanistan as its top concern, Pakistan is becoming increasingly critical to any military or diplomatic progress in the war if India is involved in any manner! It's a concern that Washington has to somehow manage.
<br /><br />Some current and retired Pakistani officials have hinted that as both the war and the peace efforts become more and more difficult, Washington and its Afghan allies might have todo more to reassure Islamabad that India won't play a major role in a future Afghan settlement. Its main worry, one might say bordering on paronia, is about having to defend both its eastern and western borders, if India and Afghanistan grew too close! It also alleges that India uses its consulates in Afghanistan to conduct espionage, stirring up anti-government forces in Pakistan's frontier regions. Officials mutter darkly about upto 19 Indian &quot;consulates&quot; based in sensitive border areas, as if it were fact (and the fact is that there are only three).
<br /><br />If we analyse India's role in the Afghanistan conflict, we will see that it was the Americans who propped us upto occupy centre-stage. But why-we shall see in the subsequent lines :-
<br /><br />India is More Important than Afghanistan- Newsweek's Fareed Zakaria warns that Obama shouldn't alienate India,(which he says is a key long-term ally), just for the sake of short-term gain in Afghanistan. He writes, &quot;Obama must keep in mind that South Asia is a tar pit filled with failed and dysfunctional states, save for one long-established democracy of 1.2 billion people that is the second-fastest-growing major economy in the world, a check on China's rising ambitions, and a natural ally of the United States. The prize is the relationship with India.The booby prize is governing Afghanistan.&quot;
<br /><br />India Should Lead Afghan Development- Forbes' Marshall M. Bouton and Alyssa Ayres call India &quot;the country best positioned to increase civilian assistance.&quot; India, like the US, has been victim to Afghanistan-based terrorism and badly wants the Taliban out”. India, they write, could provide key financial and cultural support while the US and NATO do the military `mopping up’. Obama should urge India to &quot;take on a more committed leadership role in Afghanistan's future and in building Afghan civil society.&quot;
<br /><br />Don't Abuse India- The Boston Globe's Nicholas Burns frames the challenge as &quot;how to balance a short-term need for progress in Afghanistan and Pakistan without losing sight of our equally important long-term ambitions with India.&quot; He writes, &quot;Influential Indians complain the Obama administration is diminishing America’s prior strategic priority on India, to avoid antagonizing regional rivals Pakistan and China.&quot; He suggests leading an India-Pakistan detente. &quot;India must be more sensitive to Pakistani concerns over its involvement in Afghanistan, while Islamabad should finally prosecute the terrorists responsible for the Mumbai attacks.&quot;
<br /><br />India Wants US Presence in Afghanistan- Juan Cole reports that India wants US to stay in Afghanistan. He says Manmohan Singh &quot;pressured&quot; Obama &quot;not to execute a hasty withdrawal from Afghanistan as that would have catastrophic results for the security and stability not only of Pakistan, but also for the whole of South Asia.&quot;
<br /><br />Pakistan Wants India Détente- The Washington Post's Ahmed Rashid argues that we in USA should lead the talks between Pakistan and India. &quot;The Pakistan military's primary interest in a regional strategy was that Americans would help restart Indo-Pakistan talks on Kashmir and other disputes that ceased after the terrorist attack on Mumbai, and negotiating a reduction of India's influence in Kabul, which Pakistan now blames for a host of ills (some imagined, some real).&quot;
<br /><br />History is witness to how the Afghan region has been simmering with conflicts for nearly three decades- first the Soviet occupation, then the Taliban regime (1994-2001), and to top it all-Osama bin Laden, who had made it his base. Many militants, including foreign mercenaries were then trained in his camps to go back and wage jihad in Kashmir. But in 2001, the Taliban was toppled, and a Northern Alliance–dominated government took its place. India educated Hamid Karzai then became President. India stepped in with multimillion-dollar reconstruction projects, which Pakistan resented, but couldn’t prevent -as it neither had the technology nor the money to help-embroiled as it was, with a war in its backyard-America’s GWOT-that had just hit the  road- post the 9/11 debacle !
<br /><br />So, in conclusion, we must realize that until Pakistan feels secure in its relationship with India, it will continue to believe that its interests are best advanced through clandestine support of the Taliban and other elements that destabilize Afghanistan. The way to win that trust, would be to resolve the festering Kashmir issue. Such a resolution would bring other dividends as well-deprived of the Kashmir cause, Islamist militancy within Pakistan would lose support. A strong diplomatic initiative will go a long way toward convincing local stakeholders that the US is not only committed to eliminating extremism, but that it is also invested in regional development. Subsequent peace would then free up vital trade routes to Central Asia-enriching Afghanistan, by opening Indian markets to Pakistani products and resources.
<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5oaW1hbGF5YW5hZmZhaXJzLm9yZy8_" target="_blank">India Pakistan</a> have fought over Kashmir twice since 1947.Resolving an issue that has been the failure of many great diplomatic efforts will by no means be an easy task. But Obama, strengthened by his mandate, and spurred on by his pledge to fix Afghanistan, is the man for the job. The time is right. Despite the economic meltdown, the US has leverage in the form of an agreement to sell India civilian nuclear technology and fuel. Pakistan has a civilian government for the first time in nine years, and is desperate for cash and trade. Even its Military, which actually runs the show, needs the American weapons &amp; their sophisticated technology.

		<document id="2d2c848c14bfda6888d001dda58c050b" url=""><![CDATA[Kashmir’s Strategic Significance Invites Intervention<br/><br/>The latest controversial media byte to emerge on the issue of Kashmir has come from none other than Prashant Bhushan, a reputed lawyer better known for being part of Team Anna. This eminent lawyer stated that a plebiscite should be conducted in Kashmir. The flak that he has drawn for this statement is fairly visible. In fact such was the embarrassment that his statement caused to his former associates that Anna Hazare proceeded on a “Maun Vrat” or a vow of silence to avoid commenting upon this controversial statement by his most trusted aide. He has, of course, obliquely panned Bhushan’s act through his comments on his blog. 
<br /><br />Many perceive the statement to be an attempt by Prashant Bhushan to play to the gallery. Now why a person of the stature of Bhushan should want to play to the gallery needs to be articulated, particularly so, since he hardly qualifies as being an expert on Kashmir, Kashmiris or any of the issues that involve them.
<br /><br />The Anna Hazare campaign against corruption in public life with all its nobility of purpose and intent was, in actual fact, a very meticulously planned onslaught on the Government of the day combining traditional tools like peaceful satygraha with modern day devices like image building and media management. Having achieved a limited amount of success, the core group perhaps does not wish to go into hibernation for too long lest the public, with its limited memory span, forgets all about them. While Anna himself has done enough work in the social sphere and is a stalwart who does not need to resort to publicity gimmicks to attract the spotlight, there are others in the core group who are not so blessed. It seems that they are devising measures to keep themselves alive in the public eye. Prashant Bhushan, while looking for media attention, came up this outrageous statement on Kashmir. The resultant manhandling of the lawyer, although a deplorable act, did bring an important fact to light - Kashmir’s status vis-à-vis India may be an issue for actors beyond the boundaries of India be it Pakistan or the US, but, as far as India and Indians are concerned it is a non-debatable issue. Kashmir is an integral part of independent and free India and there can be no two views about this.
<br /><br />Issuing controversial statements on Kashmir is a favourite past time with a number of pretentious thinkers who languish on the periphery of media glare and one that they resort to every time that they are seeking attention. Kashmir is primarily chosen as a topic for comment because it makes for good copy and grabs immediate attention even at the international level; the more outrageous the statement that is issued, the greater the media attention that it grabs. 
<br /><br />The value that Kashmir enjoys in this context is primarily because of the geopolitical primacy derived from its strategic location. Kashmir lies at the crucial meeting point of what is perhaps strategically, politically and economically the most dynamic part of the world. Thus, a number of countries have their own axe to grind over here. Pakistan, for instance, looks at Kashmir covetously so as to gain strategic depth as well as access to river water resources. In order to fructify its strategic ambitions, Pakistan sponsor’s terrorism and separatist movements in Kashmir through people like Syed Ali Shah Geelani who advocate Kashmir’s integration with Pakistan. 
<br /><br />Countries like the US look at Kashmir as an important link in their grand design for the Central Asian and South Asian regions. China and India are both emerging world powers with ambivalent relations with the US. Pakistan and Afghanistan together form a hotbed for propagating terrorism most of which is directed towards the US. An independent land locked Kashmir would suit the US who could use its money power to gain an operating base and thus a foothold in this region. Thus, every now and then the country purports an interest in and expresses concern over the human rights situation in the valley, simultaneously hinting at an independent status for the region. China’s entry into Pakistan Occupied Kashmir for furthering its economic interests by rampant colonisation is, by now, well documented. All these actors, unrelated to Kashmir yet harbouring vested interests in its future, do not hesitate in exploiting the situation while having no love lost for the people or interest in their well being. 
<br /><br />Kashmir’s strategic significance, its inherent God gifted beauty and unique natural endowment is also its bane. It is, therefore, incumbent, for the India and the people of Kashmir to understand the challenges, the hidden agendas of powerful lobbies, and stay ever vigilant to counter the same. Kashmir’s culture, economy, integration and most of all security is under constant threat. Under no circumstances can the level of security in Kashmir be lowered; under no circumstances can divisive political voices like the ones recently raised by Prashant Bhushan be allowed to gain centre stage. One wrong move can jeopardise the fragile political and security structure and have devastating consequences. The well-being of Kashmir and Kashmiris lies within the Indian Union. The security of Kashmir can be guaranteed only by the Indian Army, the Indian Para-military forces, the JK Police and the people of the region. This fact has been established unequivocally over a sustained period of time. Nothing should be done which upsets this structure. No doubt, every now and then individual egos and petty political gains dictate acts contrary to Kashmir’s interest, such aberrations have to be identified and nipped in the bud. All those hinting at changing the security paradigm should sit up and ta.
