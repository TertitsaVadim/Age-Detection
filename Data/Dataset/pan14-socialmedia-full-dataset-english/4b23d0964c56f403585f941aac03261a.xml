When someone is involved in a motor cycle accident the last thing on the injured biker’s mind is money, and yet in our society, money talks. So the Center for Disease Control and Prevention conducted a study from 2008 to 2010 to find out just how much is saved when motorcycle riders and passengers strap on a helmet before hitting the road.<br /><br />According to the study, over $3 billion was saved in 2010 alone, with total costs saved due to helmet use ranging from $2.6 million in New Mexico to $394 million in California. Economic costs saved from helmet use per registered motorcycle ranged from $48 in New Mexico to $1,627 in North Carolina, with a median of $286. In Massachusetts, the savings was over $400 per registered motorcycle.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5tYXJrc2Fsb21vbmUuY29tLw__" target="_blank">Personal Injury Lawyer Boston Massachusetts</a> Mark E. Salomone is always glad to hear of any new research that supports the prevention of motorcyclist injuries and their passengers. Having defended countless victims of <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5tYXJrc2Fsb21vbmUuY29tL21vdG9yY3ljbGUtYWNjaWRlbnQtaW5qdXJpZXM_" target="_blank">motorcycle accident injuries</a>, however, he knows how much helmets do to protect riders.  “Every time riders take their bikes to the streets,” he says, “they’re placing themselves at risk of serious injury and death. When a motorcyclist is hit by a distracted driver in a high-speed collision or if their bike has brake defects, helmets are even more crucial, as they can prevent serious head injuries and brain damage. ”<br /><br />Over 40 percent of motorcyclists killed in accidents between 2008 and 2010 did not have a helmet on, says the CDC report. On the other hand, helmets reduced fatalities by 37 percent for motorcycle drivers and 41 percent for passengers, which translated to 1,544 fewer motorcyclist deaths in 2010.<br /><br />In states where helmets are not required, 79 percent of the motorcyclists killed were not wearing one, compared to 12 percent in states where they are mandatory, the CDC said. Current Massachusetts motorcycle helmet law requires all motorcycle drivers and passengers to wear protective headgear, except when participating in parades.<br /><br />The other positive message in this study is that every Massachusetts resident benefits when our state saves money, as it helps the overall local economy. Who knows if the CDC’s findings will inspire new helmet law legislation in states without it, but money talks so it wouldn’t be surprising if lawmakers in those states take up the cause—and it’s a good one.<br /><br />&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;<br /><br />&lt;em&gt;If you or a loved one suffered motorcycle accident injuries, contact the tough, reliable attorneys at Massachusetts personal injury attorney, Mark E.

In 2010, a total of 129 pedestrians died in auto accidents and 2,113 pedestrians were injured, according to the Michigan Department of Transportation.

The majority encounter this particular significant issue yearly. SEE:  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.peakefowler.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.peakefowler.com</a>  For the most part, getting seriously hurt on the job is often as a result of negligence regarding businesses who don't have sufficient  safety tools and operating atmosphere  their own workforce. If you are ill-fated to get involved in an accident you ought to consult a personal injury attorney to enable you to get the  compensation you rightly deserve  specially when the injuries is permanent or perhaps incapacitating.  <br /><br />By using a personal injury attorney, the employer will in all probability end up being ordered to compensate much more than what he would usually present you with as a  negotiation. You will be pushed  to take the money rather then go to court but when it comes to money  concerns it is advisable not to  jeopardize you and your family’s fate. When an employer  pays punitive damages he will not likely make the identical mistake once  again. A short term injury may be worth  being compensated for, consequently do not hesitate to  see a highly trained injury lawyer irrespective of how  small the amount. Several lawyers work on a ‘no win no fee’ foundation, which means you need not stress about   having to pay your attorney unless you win the case. <br /><br />Accidents might result from improper instruction, inferior safety equipment or perhaps the absence of a safe and secure working environment.  No matter what the cause, you  have the legal right to seek compensation as well as hire a personal injury lawyer to make sure that your  case is properly presented. Healthcare  expenditures usually takes a toll on the finances, which is one of many factors why you need to seek advice from a personal injury lawyer to receive highest settlement. Personal injury can happen wherever. It doesn’t end up being at the office. Should you  be involved in a vehicle accident or slip and fall in a store, your odds of getting hurt unfortunately are just as bad. See:  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.slocumblaw.com%2Fchicago-lawyer%2Fpersonal-"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.slocumblaw.com/chicago-lawyer/personal-</a> injury-lawyer-in-chicago <br /><br />Many people don’t like the thought of a  long drawn out court procedure. Even so, the loss of salary as a  result of inability to work due to incidents is one thing that we can ill  afford. Prior to deciding to consent to any initially offer from the accountable person, be certain that you're attentive to the results. Agreeing to some sort of settlement will certainly renounce any kind of future right to make a claim. Subsequently, it is prudent to consult an injury  lawyer and understand fully your  privileges. You will have  the right to reclaim a significant sum in present, past, and  future lost pay. In addition, you may be entitled to claim future medical related expenses for physiotherapy, as well as other living expenses similar to rent as well as utility bills. Many people overlook their potential bills which might  only end up being pointed out through a seasoned injury attorney. <br /><br />The bottom line is to never sign any document to release the actual  individual to blame for your personal injury from future claims or agree to a modest amount as settlement. Exactly what matters is your  monetary coming years  which is often guaranteed if someone makes the best decision and consult with an injury lawyer.

According to the report, females face a greater risk of car accident injury possibly because cars lack safety features tailored to women.<br /><br />The study, published in the American Journal of Public Health (AJPH), relied on national traffic accident statistics from 1998 to 2008. Women are not necessarily in more auto accidents, but the design of safety devices like seatbelts and airbags may provide greater protection for men due to their larger size and their preferred seating position, according to the results. The report found that female drivers wearing seatbelts were more likely to be injured and sustained more chest and spin injuries than men wearing seatbelts in similar crashes.

Bar Association held its fifth annual 4ALL Statewide Service Day in March, and more than 460 attorneys from across the state worked together to field 8,648 calls over a 12-hour period.  Each year, lawyers participating in the event generously volunteer their time to discuss a wide variety of legal issues with callers, providing general advice and guidance where possible. <br /><br />The 4ALL Statewide Service Day aims to help those who would otherwise not seek legal advice, and to make them aware of the resources available to them to get the help they may need. This worthy program serves a real need, as many people just need a little guidance to point them in the right direction.<br /><br />But sometimes, more than advice is needed. Those who have suffered a personal injury as a result of an accident or negligence may need experienced legal representation to fight for compensation that is provided under the law.  See : <br />&lt;a href=<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.farrin.com%2Flocations%2Fcar-accident-charlotte-north-carolina%26gt%3Bcar"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.farrin.com/locations/car-accident-charlotte-north-carolina&gt;car</a> accident attorney Charlotte North Carolina[/url]<br /><br />When we speak with potential clients at the Law Offices of James Scott Farrin, sometimes we find that they are not seeking representation, but rather just want a little advice.  However, after our attorneys have had a chance to talk with them about the particular aspects of their case and their rights under the law, we’ve found that by the end of the call, many are eager to be represented.  <br /><br />Before they call us, most clients have already discussed their claim with the insurance adjuster for the at-fault party in their accident, and they often believe their case to be a simple, straightforward matter that can be settled directly. When they call us to discuss their lingering concerns and receive their initial consultation with one of our attorneys, many of these people come to understand how complicated the process of seeking compensation for their injuries can become and how important it is to have a personal injury attorney working on their behalf.  Insurance companies are working for their own interests – and they have teams of lawyers fighting to reduce or eliminate what they have to pay accident victims for their injuries. See: [url={<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fhttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.farrin.com%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://http://www.farrin.com/</a>]accident attorney[/url]<br /><br />Seemingly simple issues that clients think can be resolved without dispute often are much more complicated and can require the expert guidance of an experienced personal injury attorney. While the Law Offices of James Scott Farrin are unable to offer representation to every client who calls us, we have always tried to do our best to answer questions that potential clients have when they call. <br /><br />Even if you may not be seeking representation for your case, an initial case evaluation is free and confidential, and it may be beneficial.  You may end up speaking with an attorney who can provide answers to your questions and make you aware of legal issues regarding your case. The only bad question is the question that was never asked.

The commission also does not usually enforce fines for these violations of the law (up to $100 per day), and cases that are brought before it rarely lead to prosecution or sentencing.<br /><br />Lack of Protection<br /><br />Workers’ compensation was introduced in the 1930s to protect workers who were injured on the job. In North Carolina, businesses with three or more employees are required to carry the insurance, or they must certify that they have the assets to pay for their liabilities for worker injuries.<br /><br />However, the report by the Raleigh News &amp;amp; Observer indicated that about 170,000 companies in the state meet this criteria, yet databases show that insurance carriers only covered about 140,000 businesses for workers’ compensation insurance.<br /><br />When workers are hurt on the job and their employers do not carry workers’ compensation insurance, they can sue their employer orappeal to the N.C. Industrial Commission to get compensation.<br /><br />In the fiscal year 2011, the commission received 62,409 such claims, and about 75 percent of them were settled through mediation.<br /><br />Need for Reform<br /><br />The report by the Raleigh News &amp;amp; Observer noted that the N.C. Industrial Commission has the power to enforce the requirement that businesses carry workers’ compensation insurance, but that it rarely checks for lapses in coverage – which can be monitored through a state-mandated reporting system.<br /><br />The commission is usually not aware that a business is in breach of the law until an injured worker files  a complaint.<br /><br />This lack of oversight often leaves injured workers struggling to pay mounting medical bills while also being unable to work, and proceedings can go on for years before a resolution is reached. Moreover, according to the article, those businesses who choose not to purchase workers’ compensation insurance often do so  in an effort to cut costs and stay afloat, so most would not have enough assets to pay for any injuries should a case be decided in a worker’s favor.<br /><br />The legislature approved changes to the workers’ compensation system last year but did not address the problem with the lack of coverage. Instead, the new law focused on cutting the amount and length of payment due to injured workers so that the cost of the insurance would go down.<br /><br />Sen. Doug Berg, D-Franklin, a former deputy commissioner at the Industrial Commission, and a lawyer with the Law Offices of James Scott Farrin, called on Gov. Bev Perdue to make prompt reforms. He told The Charlotte Observer that he will ask Perdue to put reforms in the budget bill for this session.<br /><br />Berger also said the commission should be required to perform spot checks on workers’ compensation insurance to ensure compliance. He also suggested giving more authority to the Department of Insurance to investigate fraud.<br /><br />Gov. Bev Perdue called on the commission to make immediate changes to correct the problem.<br /><br />NORTH CAROLINA WORKERS’ COMPENSATION LAYWERS<br /><br />If you were injured on the job, don’t wait to find out if your employer is in compliance of the laws and will be able to provide compensation for your injuries.

Texting while driving was the top distraction, followed by eating and drinking, personal grooming and fiddling with the vehicle controls.<br /><br />As<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5mbGFnZXJ5b2NrZXkuY29tIA__" target="_blank"> personal injury lawyers in Philadelphia</a>, we at Flager &amp; Yockey, P.C. have represented people injured in car accidents due to distracted driving. It’s heartbreaking to see what victims and families experience due to the negligence of others.<br /><br />While the new study focuses on teen driving behavior, our accident attorneys in Pennsylvania know that young people are not always to blame for car crashes. We have seen how distracted drivers, young and old, can be responsible for serious car accidents in Philadelphia and elsewhere.<br />Researchers found that teenage females were nearly 10 percent more likely to become distracted while driving than boys. They were nearly 50 percent more likely to reach for something than boys, and nearly 25 percent more likely to eat or drink while driving than boys.<br /><br />Boys, however, were about twice as likely as girls to become distracted and look behind them and were also more likely to talk with people outside of the car.<br /><br />The AAA study also examined how teens act when they have peers in the car vs. how they behave when driving alone. With friends in the car, they are more likely to horse around while driving. When driving alone, the teens were likely to use mobile devices.<br /><br />It’s important for parents to speak with their teenage drivers about the dangers of distracted driving. Parents or guardians may want to restrict the number of passengers to one, which can cut down on boisterous behavior.<br /><br />Earlier studies found that texting while driving increases the chance of a car accident by 23 times compared to someone who is not texting. While even experienced drivers should not text behind the wheel, inexperienced drivers like teenagers who send or receive text messages may be at an even higher risk for a serious accident.<br /><br />If you or a loved one was injured in an accident, you should not hesitate to contact a personal injury lawyer for a free consultation.

For us, though, it’s an open-and-shut case (pardon the pun): branding is where it's at. Client after client, click after click, conversion after conversion, we've been proving for years that building a strong, memorable brand—rather than populating the ether with keyword-laden mini-you's—is the way to go.<br /><br />It all gets down to name recognition. Quick, say three company names out loud. What were they?  Come on, tell the truth. It was names like Apple, Target or Gap—not  cooltechtoysonline, buyeverythingstore or mycasualclothingsource—right?<br />There are a few core issues at play here. One is that we humans can only retain so much and, in the cluttered world of <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5iaWd2b29kb28uY29tL3NlYXJjaC1vcHRpbWl6YXRpb24tYXR0b3JuZXlzLWxhd2Zpcm1z" target="_blank">online, SEO-fueled marketing</a>—where everyone and their uncle is spawning keyword-rich microsites like bunnies—distinct attorney firm names will lodge in prospective clients' memory banks more than a long string of generic, run-of-the-mill words. In a sea of variations on &quot;personalinjurylawyerinyourtown&quot; sites, no prospective client is going to remember one over another. But &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; law firm's name is unique and &lt;em&gt;that's&lt;/em&gt; your branding, right there.<br /><br />Secondly, rankings show authoritative, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5iaWd2b29kb28uY29tL29ubGluZS1tYXJrZXRpbmctc2VydmljZXMtYXR0b3JuZXlzLWxhd2Zpcm1z" target="_blank">branded sites</a> rise to the top when they're &lt;em&gt;supported&lt;/em&gt; by—not diluted by—only a select few, carefully managed, keyword-rich sites. Lastly, Matt Cutts himself has said that Google is adjusting its algorithm so it won't help much to have keywords in your domain name anyway.<br /><br />Multiple, keyword-heavy sites might sound alluring but they're dangerous. By amassing keyword-rich domain names, the only thing you can be sure of is that you'll segment your traffic and fragment your conversion potential into a constellation of counter-productive, if not destructive, microsites (Google doesn't suffer buried main sites gladly).<br /><br />So yes, you can have a few additional domains but only if they support the mother-ship: &lt;em&gt;your brand.&lt;/em&gt;<br /><br />We know this is the opposite of what most of our competitors are saying but that's why we're the fastest growing <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5iaWd2b29kb28uY29tLw__" target="_blank">online legal marketing company</a> in the country.<br /><br />We help our clients rise above the noise, but it's not rarified air up here at the top and it's not rocket science. It's just smart. Come on up—the view's awesome.<br /><br />Check out <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy55b3V0dWJlLmNvbS93YXRjaD92PXJBV0Z2NDNxdWJJ" target="_blank">Matt Cutts'</a> take on branded sites vs. keyword-heavy microsites.
