The simple reason is because the first sets of people are equipped with these basic models while the latter sets are not.<br /><br />In this article, I will share with you basic principle you need to follow to make money with FiverFox.<br /><br />A: The first basic principle you need to know is deciding what you want to offer or sell to people on FiverFox. On FiverFox, all gigs/tasks are sold for $5, so you need to decide what you can offer for $5. After your sale, $1 goes to FiverFox and $4 gets credited to your account. So, deciding what you can sell for $5 is the first and most important step. You should not be wasting your time creating a website, composing a song or some strenuous tasks for $5 on FiverFox instead, you should be thinking about a task you can get done in ten minutes or so!<br /><br />B: After deciding what to offer on FiverFox, the next step is designing your title ad. This is as important as deciding what to sell. The ad is what catches the attention of potential buyers. It necessarily does not need to be long but it must be catchy! Make sure you let people know what you are offering but do not disclose all the details. Keep them guessing so they can click the ad and check the content of the ad!<br /><br />C: When you must have designed your ad, the next step is including the appropriate picture to make your ad lively. Including a picture in your ad is very important and must be related to what you are offering. If your ad is about Social networking or social marketing, it would be wise to include a picture of Facebook, Twitter or Flickr. This will make your ad lively and prompt people to click on it.<br /><br />D: Including videos in your ad is a good option but it is not compulsory. It has not been proven that gigs with videos sell more than gigs without. Nevertheless, if you can include a video, do so but your ad will work well with just a picture.<br /><br />E: When your ad is live, you should try as much as possible to make it easy for people to locate your ad. Note that you have a limited number of ads to display on FiverFox (twenty to be precise), so if your ad is not getting enough views, you can always edit and tweak it to start receiving views and clicks. If your gigs are viewed well and delivered promptly, they stand the chance of getting featured thereby getting you more orders.<br /><br />F: The next step is making sure your gigs get positive ratings. This is possible if you deliver your orders promptly and with the promise in the ad. Nevertheless, if your gig gets a thumbs-down, do not be discouraged, you can always get positive rating with new quality gigs!<br /><br />G: Finally, your efforts should not stop at creating quality gigs. You need to market your gigs for them to get maximum exposure. Use the power of Social Marketing /networking. Advertize you ads on Facebook, Twitter and so on. Use the power of word-of-mouth to maximize the publicity of your gig. Market them anyhow. Just get them exposed!
