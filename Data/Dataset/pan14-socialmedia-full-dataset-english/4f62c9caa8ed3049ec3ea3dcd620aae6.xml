<br />WASHINGTON – The current strong gains in hiring makes the Federal Reserve policymakers worried that it could buzz if the economic growth of the US doesn’t go up.
<br /><br />According to the Fed’s minutes on Tuesday, members were first stated their concerns before they make a plan to keep interest rates at record lows until at least late year 2014. However, some of the members want to take further procedures to improve the economy current status if a condition gets worse or inflation remains reclaimed.
<br /><br />After the meeting, Fed presented the somewhat current view of the economy mainly because of the three consecutive months of hiring in two years. It was concluded that there have been similar raptures of hiring in the previous two years which ended up fading.
<br /><br />On the speech echoed by the Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke last week in the economists gathering, the decline of the economy recovery was the main concern of Fed as it did last year.
<br /><br />Americans aren’t receiving meaningful pay augmentation. Gas prices are high. Additionally, Europe’s debt crisis could reflect on the U.S economy. Provided that the inflation will remain on its current position, analysts think that the Fed will likely give interest rates down in order for them to give the economy an additional support. Most of the economists don’t think that Fed officials will alter their interest-rate policy at their following meeting on April 24-25 and will only relieve credits if the economy gradually moves from its current status.
<br /><br />The economy outlook is going up. Employers added an average of 245,000 jobs a month from December through February. On the other side, the rate of unemployed dropped nearly to 8.3%. The government will report Friday on the job market in March. Most of the economists supposed that the report will give a better month of job creation with a net gain of 210,000 jobs. They also expect that the unemployment rate will remain at 8.3%.

<br />February 15, 2012 – LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA – (Kazor.com) – Britain is once again suffering a recession and unemployment risks coming close into three million this year as forecasted by the leading economic forecaster. The UK’s economic recovery is ‘paralyzed’ by Europe’s debt crisis, the Ernst &amp;amp; Young Item club will warn, as it cut its GDP growth forecast from 1.5 per cent to 0.2 per cent. According to Eldridge Financial Blog, the dire prediction comes after nine European countries including France, have had their credit ratings downgraded on Friday, dropping world stock markets into turmoil.
<br />Economists had hoped that exports and business investment would strengthen the economy this year, with public and consumerspending still in the doldrums. Nevertheless, Europe accounts for more than 40 percent of British trade and business confidence has been roughly hit by insecurity about the future of the Continent and the single currency. On Eldridge Financial Blog in the Sunday Telegraph quoted Professor Peter Spencer, chief economist at the Item Club, as saying: ‘Figures for the last quarter of 2011 and the first quarter of this year are likely to show that we are back in recession, and we are going to have to wait until summer before there are signs of improvement. Although he said the double dip was unlikely to be prolonged, he warned that unemployment was nevertheless likely to hit three million by early next year. Figures set for release on Wednesday are expected to show the jobless figures continued to rise in the three months up until the end of November. Professor Spencer admitted that the Item Club’s predictions were based on positive assumptions about European policymakers’ ability to keep the euro zone from falling apart. The longer the uncertainty continues, the more debilitating the impact will be on the UK’s economic prospects, he added. The European Commission vice-president for economic affairs, Olli Rehn, yesterday attacked the decision by Standard &amp;amp; Poor’s to cut down the credit ratings of so many European countries.
<br />The downgrades were ‘inconsistent’, claiming that the euro zone was taking ‘decisive action’ over the economic crisis.

<br /><br />Eldridge Financial Blog: While Energy costs, U.S. worries in economic expansion
<br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.eldridgefinancial-blog.com%2Fcategory%2Ffinacial%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.eldridgefinancial-blog.com/category/finacial/</a>
<br /><br />WASHINGTON (Reuters) – The Federal Reserve said on Wednesday: U.S economic actions kept growing moderately in the late winter months, however, the rising energy prices makes the manufacturers be anxious  as well as the retailers across the country.
<br /><br />In the reports showed in Eldridge Financial Blog the economy continued rapidly make an expansion at a self-effacing from mid of February through the late March.
<br /><br />It is said that some of the positive signs are the stronger manufacturing activity, steady hiring and improves retail business in most of the country.  Yet, there still a sense of threat specifically to the costlier energy and the increasing gasoline prices.
<br /><br />On the other side, the near -term outlook for household spending was encouraging, More than a few districts articulated their concerns that the staid increase of gas prices could limit the unrestricted costs in the coming months.
<br /><br />On the Eldridge Financial Blog report, on the collected data before April2 comes from business contacts in each of the 12 districts that have regional Fed banks and is thus seen as a real-life set off to the supplementary academic speeches and analyses that flow from the central bank.
<br /><br />The reserved to reasonable pace description of growth was unchanged from the preceding rundown issued at the end of February.
<br /><br />The 120,000 jobs created in March was heard a bit more upbeat about the job market after having the last week’s Eldridge Financial Blog government report. It was said that Employment was firm but there is still a difficulty in looking for qualified employees most specifically for the high skilled positions. This information will be used by the Fed policymakers in order for them to assess the economy when they reach April 23-24 regard as whether to change interest-rate policy.
<br /><br />Atlanta Fed Bank President Dennis Lockhart, a voting member of the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee, said on Wednesday he would be “somewhat reticent to consider another round of quantitative easing” at this time

<br />May 1 (Bloomberg) -- Delta Air Lines Inc. is bringing some jet-fuel production in house, breaking with U.S. carriers' reliance on outside providers, by acquiring a refinery that Phillips 66 had targeted for shutdown.
<br /><br />The world's second-biggest airline will pay $180 million for the complex in suburban Philadelphia, according to a statement yesterday. Pennsylvania's state government is putting up $30 million in assistance to defray the expense.
<br /><br />An airline-owned refinery is an experiment in the U.S. industry, said Ray Neidl, an airline analyst at Maxim Group LLC in New York. Atlanta-based Delta estimated the accord will save $300 million on its annual fuel bill, which was $11.8 billion last year, or about $32 million a day.
<br /><br />&amp;quot;Nothing ventured, nothing gained,&amp;quot; said Neidl, who has a buy rating on Delta shares. &amp;quot;Delta likes to try new things and I'm sure they studied this for months and ran the calculations. Nobody has done something quite like this before.&amp;quot;
<br /><br />Delta is buying the refinery in Trainer, Pennsylvania, through a subsidiary called Monroe Energy LLC, a nod to the airline's original headquarters in Monroe, Louisiana. Trainer will add to earnings, boost margins and allow the airline to recoup its upfront investment in the first year, Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson said in the statement.
<br /><br />Delta fell 1.5 percent to $10.80 late yesterday in extended trading. Phillips 66 begins trading today after the pipeline- and-refining company's spinoff from Houston-based ConocoPhillips. The new company also will be based in Houston.

<br /><br />Retail developers CentrO and global leisure giant Merlin Entertainments (Merlin), Europe and Germany’s biggest visitor attraction operator, announced today further details of a €15 million investment plan which will significantly expand Merlin’s business in one of Germany’s leading Ruhr tourist centres – Oberhausen.
<br /><br />Merlin is developing two new high quality attractions in Germany’s biggest shopping mall - CentrO Oberhausen - complementing the company’s existing SEA LIFE aquarium which has been one of the most popular attractions in the area since 2004. Both scheduled to open in Spring 2013 - Ocean Adventure Park will replace the old Centr0 Amusement Park, and is an exciting extension to SEA LIFE taking the marine experience to the next stage; while a new LEGOLAND® Discovery Centre (LDC) will offer an exciting new experience for families with young children.
<br /><br />Merlin took over the management of the amusement park in March last year, and the first phase of development is already well under way. The new Ocean Adventure Park will open with one of the most enchanting and challenging family experiences the company has developed to date, and a first for Merlin - Antarctic Adventure Expedition Extreme – an amazing combination of ride, aquarium and animal encounters which show every element of Antarctica via a series of ‘test zones’, and ending with a Penguin Encounter which will have every member of the family spellbound. &quot;See some of the region’s most beautiful penguins, on the ice and under water – laugh at their antics, marvel at their sophisticated community and just have fun…… and this is just the beginning&quot;. In line with Merlin’s strategy of continuous investment for all its attractions, other exciting new features will be added to the Park in the future. 
<br /><br />Merlin’s third attraction in Oberhausen will be the company’s newest attraction concept, the unique LEGOLAND® Discovery Centre. Offering a fun, highly interactive and educational two to three-hour indoor experience specifically designed for families with children 3-10 years old. Based on the ever popular LEGO brick, LEGOLAND Discovery Centres provide a range of play areas including a 4D cinema; a brick pool, master classes from the LEGO Master Model Builder; exciting LEGO rides; special party rooms for birthdays and other celebrations.
<br /><br />Also included will be the popular MINILAND exhibit, found in every LEGOLAND Park and attraction, which is designed to reflect the iconic buildings and skyline of each individual attraction’s location featuring buildings nominated by the local community.
<br /><br />The LEGOLAND Discovery Centre in Oberhausen will be Merlin’s eighth LDC worldwide and second in Germany, and will replace the one currently operating in Duisburg. The move to Oberhausen offers many significant benefits both commercially with central management, great efficiency and buying power; but most importantly for visitors - who will have an opportunity to take advantage of joint ticket offers and other special activities to encourage them to visit all 3 exciting attractions in Oberhausen.
