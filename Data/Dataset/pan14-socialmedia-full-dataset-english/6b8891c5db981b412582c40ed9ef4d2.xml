<br />The heart now, so dead
<br />My demon attacks
<br />As you walk away...
<br />So many lies been spoken
<br />So many things forgotten
<br />But you never cared
<br />As I felt false happiness...
<br /><br />Is this reality or a twisted nightmare?
<br />I cannot comprehend
<br />Your hollow words mean nothing
<br />To the closed ears I now possess...
<br />The scars you inflicted
<br />Bleed ebony forever
<br />My soul slowly fades away
<br />Decrepit my ultimate state...
<br /><br />You never lived, you never were
<br />You're nothing but a twisted myth
<br />You never lived, you never were
<br />You wont be my sunsetter forever...
<br /><br />The flashbacks you create
<br />Burn behind the eyes
<br />The searing pain, everlasting
<br />Sad realisation, nothing left...
<br />You wont prey on this fallen star
<br />You're past the point of no return
<br />The spiked gates will stay locked
<br />Loneliness my ultimate fate...
<br /><br />You never lived, you never were
<br />You're nothing but a twisted myth
<br />You never lived, you never were
<br />You wont be my sunsetter forever...
<br /><br />Now I'm back to the begging
<br />To my familliar prison
<br />You will be forgotten
<br />Just as you forgotten me

<br /><br />I lay lifeless and numb in my Abyss...
<br />The place I hoped never to return to...
<br />My cell door locked
<br />My chains re-attatched
<br />I fell away, I wont return
<br /><br />I'm left to die, die alone
<br />The inevitable end to this fucked up war...
<br />There's nothing left of me but skin and bone
<br />Just watch me fade, the fucken joke...
<br />The claims of being loved and needed
<br />Prove to be nothing more than hollow lies...
<br />They are now just whispers to closed ears..
<br /><br />They say they'd be sad if they lost me
<br />But I'm already lost forever...
<br />So watch the death of a fallen star
<br />As I die slowly and painfully....

<br />When the air is filled with all sorts of gloom
<br />The evil ones come out to play
<br />Through out this night
<br />Until the day...''-----------------
<br /><br />In the cold dark night...
<br />The harvest moon sits high...
<br />The wind howls like hell hounds...
<br />Throughout the catacombs...
<br />Cold as death the horrors stir... 
<br />To take you all to the land of no return...
<br /><br />Sleep tight, sleep well
<br />When you wake you'll be in hell...
<br />Sleep tight, sleep well
<br />When you wake you'll be in hell...
<br /><br />The shadows of all emerge...
<br />From where the light won't stray...
<br />Take a knife to your heart... 
<br />That'd be a better way...
<br />They'll rip you from existance....
<br />They'll rip you limb by limb
<br /><br />Your prayers to the sand man are in vain...
<br />You'll all reach your fate anyway...
<br />So don't resist, just go to sleep...
<br />And let all the horrors reape...
<br />It'll hurt for a while, then all will be gone...
<br /><br />Sleep tight, sleep well
<br />When you wake you'll be in hell...
<br />Sleep tight, sleep well
<br />When you wake you'll be in hell...
<br /><br />The clock strikes twelve...
<br />Its midnight now...
<br />Time for the ultimate dark  
<br />To make its place...
<br />The blood red moon...
<br />Lights up the sky...
<br />To match your blood...
<br />Scattered around...
<br />Ten heretics complete the rite...
<br />With the blood of a pure heart...
<br />Now you're all fucked...
<br />On this deathly night...
<br /><br />Sleep tight, sleep well
<br />When you wake you'll be in hell...
<br />Sleep tight, sleep well
<br />When you wake you'll be in hell...
<br /><br />The night's nearly done...
<br />Now for the big finale...
<br />The clouds have formed...
<br />As black as our souls...
<br />All the horrors have done their bidding...
<br />10,000 souls, ours for the taking...
<br />They gather in the ghastly mausoleum...
<br />The dead ground cracks open...
<br />And you'll be trapped forever...
<br /><br />Sleep tight, sleep well
<br />When you wake you'll be in hell...
<br />Sleep tight, sleep well
<br />When you wake you'll be in hell...
<br /><br />Eleven harpies set a festive mood...
<br />With tunes of wonderment...
<br />Under the light of the blood red fire moonlight...
<br />The dark ones parade down the empty street...
<br />In triumph of the town's defeat...
<br />Your souls are damned in the fifth level of hell...
<br />Lets hear you writhe, give some yells...
<br />As darcopolipse demons rip your insides out...
<br />Just to watch the pain on your tormented faces...
<br />Welcome to hell you damned little fucks...
<br />Now my dear miscreants, lets have some fun!!!!!!!
<br /><br />Sleep tight, sleep well
<br />When you wake you'll be in hell...
<br />Sleep tight, sleep well
<br />When you wake you'll be in hell...

<br />&quot;Dear diary... Today I saw dead people. And at recess a leprechaun told me everyone wanted to kill me... but I wont let that happen... I'LL KILL THEM ALL INSTEAD!!!&quot; (Disturbed Little Boy)
<br /><br />_____________________
<br />_________________________
<br />_______________
<br /><br />I wonder if everybody knows...
<br />of the diaries of the Disturbed Little Boy's
<br />Full of torment, hatred and despair...
<br />delusion, insanity always there...
<br />Voices control his every thought...
<br />violence and murder in the end...
<br />coz in his mind he's not all there...
<br /><br />The diary is all that he lives for...
<br />Paranoir everywhere...
<br />keeping track of everything...
<br />He's obsessive and excessive...
<br /><br />&quot;Dear diary... everybody is dead... 
<br />I did what the leprechaun told me to do... 
<br />Now all my friends are dead... 
<br />NO MOTHERFUCKER IS GONNA GET ME IF I GET THEM FIRST!!&quot;
<br />(disturbed little boy)
<br /><br />No horroh movie can compare...
<br />to all the visions in his head...
<br />Inside he knows he's insane...
<br />but not according to his brain...
<br />Losing sense of the truth...
<br />He's not the one inside the booth...
<br /><br />&quot;Dear diary... I really think its unfair
<br />that everyone has someone else to care...
<br />Yet I sit here all alone...
<br />Nobody is ever home...
<br />Nothing at all but skin and bone...
<br />Atleast I have the voices in my head...
<br />I'LL MAKE SURE EVERYBODIES DEAD!!!&quot;
<br />(disturbed little boy) 
<br /><br />Nearly everybody else is dead...
<br />coz no-one ever really cared...
<br />For this little boys tainted mind...
<br />Made them see the end...
<br /><br />&quot;Dear diary... I did a bad thing today...
<br />I nearly disobeyed what the voices said...
<br />But thankfully I'm not dead...
<br />Now I'm truly all alone...
<br />No-one will ever again come home...
<br />Don't worry... I did what the voices said...
<br />I'm the only one alive... 
<br />No-one left with the heart of stone...
<br />What next? Voices what next?
<br />Voices? Are you there?
<br />VOICES!!! DON&quot;T LEAVE!!!
<br />DON&quot;T LEAVE ME ALL ALONE!!!!
<br />I HATE LONELYNESS!!!&quot;
<br />(disturbed little boy)
<br /><br />All the voices have now gone...
<br />and now he's truly all alone...
<br />No-one heard the last thing he said...
<br />All we know that he's now... dead!

<br />(intro/Verse#1)
<br />Cut me up and tear me apart
<br />Make my blood spill and splatter the earth
<br />You may as well
<br />You already made the pain reality
<br />You may think you're flawless
<br />But you degraded yourself
<br />And became the whole world's WHORE!
<br /><br />(chorus)
<br />Cut me up, Tear me apart
<br />Cut me up, Tear me apart
<br />Cut up, Torn apart
<br />Cut up, Torn apart
<br /><br />(Verse#2)
<br />My chains will break
<br />You suffocate
<br />I will resurrect
<br />You will just fall...
<br />You think you're perfection
<br />You were never perfection
<br />Stop fucken lying to yourself!
<br /><br />(Chorus)
<br /><br />(Verse#3)
<br />You're mechanical (heartless)
<br />You're degraded (no self respect)
<br />You're dead to me (you never were)
<br />Just rot away (to your abyss)
<br />You crawl (I stand strong)
<br />Your loss, your pain (I break away!!)
<br />My hate will stay (You fade away!!) 
<br /><br />(Outro)
<br />GET AWAY
<br />STAY AWAY
<br />KEEP AWAY

<br />I sit in a padded cell
<br />Every move being watched
<br />through the looking glass
<br />Observed like an experiment
<br />Feared like the apocolypse
<br />Feared by the stereotypical
<br />I'm the freak
<br /><br />The freak is individual...
<br />Society turned their backs on him
<br />He's pointed and stared at
<br />like a joke...
<br />He's the freak
<br /><br />In the small world
<br />I hide my face in the shadows...
<br />In the large crowd...
<br />I stand alone
<br />I'm the freak
<br /><br />The freak is misunderstood
<br />regarded as a nobody
<br />Threatened in groups
<br />Feared by the alone
<br />he's the freak
<br /><br />No one will see the real me
<br />only the stereotype I resemble
<br />Everyone too shallow to see past their noses
<br />too shallow to realise inside I'm no different to them...
<br />But they'll never see that...
<br />To them I'll always be known as 
<br />The Freak

<br />Her empty eyes seer a place of no return…
<br />A hollow shell…
<br />Is the only safe guard she has…
<br />The thin glass hides all…
<br />Her tears barely fill the minute cup…
<br />She is a puzzle with a missing piece…

<br />He dares to taste the wine…
<br />He throws no stones…

<br /><br />When her eyes met mine, her soul’s flame relit…

<br />He is the stone on the side lines… that’s all he will be…

<br /><br />I tried to kill myself today
<br />Not from depression, just a game
<br />I guess if you do these things
<br />It means you're fucken insane...
<br />I stand infront of moving trains
<br />Just to feel my heartbeat race
<br />I hang off cliffs without restraints
<br />Even I wonder if I have a brain...
<br /><br />Is mental malfunction the thing to blame??
<br />or an acid trip that didn't go away??
<br />Either way its all the same
<br />I have very fucked up games...
<br /><br />I play russian roulette with a mini gun
<br />With three bullets instead of one
<br />I crash cars into light poles and brickwalls
<br />Or anything else in my way...
<br />I played chicken with a bus the other day
<br />To see who was the first to veer away...
<br />Who the fuck is anyone to say
<br />I could occupy my time in better ways?
<br /><br />Was I dropped on my head too many times to say?
<br />or too many magic mushrooms eaten away
<br />There's only one way to explain
<br />I'm far from sanity to feel ashamed...
<br /><br />Dodging knives and cyanide darts
<br />anything really deadly and fast
<br />Sticking forks in power sockets
<br />Riding trolleys down busy roads...
<br />anything reckless, I've done it all
<br />Fuck doing everyday things
<br />Especially if you're mental like me
<br />Doing what I do sets me free....
<br /><br />Is mental malfunction the thing to blame??
<br />or an acid trip that didn't go away??
<br />Either way its all the same
<br />I have very fucked up games...
<br /><br />A shot of metho to start the day
<br />Before I engage in my destructive ways
<br />Pulling pins from hand grenades
<br />Then throwing them and running away...
<br />Jumping into bullpens wearing red
<br />Then running in circles being chased...
<br />I think back through all the days
<br />And wonder how my life has stayed...
<br /><br />Was I dropped on my head too many times to say?
<br />or too many magic mushrooms eaten away
