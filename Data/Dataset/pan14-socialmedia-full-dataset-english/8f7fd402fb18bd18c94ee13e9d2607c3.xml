Tiger Woods did not go back to defend title twice, after winning the Asian Classic in 1997 and the Johnnie Walker Classic in 2000, he did not go back. All the two matches were held in Thailand. Tiger Woods received 300 million in appearance fees for participating burthe Australian Masters, half of which was burdened by the Victorian Government. &quot;I think he will not come back.&quot; Ian Baker-Finch said, &quot;But if he comes back to defend the title, that`s great.&quot;
<br /><br />There is probably a more important question: if he does not come back, what will happen to Australian Golf Clud? Australia is a talent pool for golf. There are more numbers of the tour of American players from Australia than any other countries. But professional golf in Australia was stopped in this ten years. Support fee and people`s enthusiasm were all in a low degree. Since Gleit-Norman was not the first one in the world, the grand occasions in Kingston Heath last week haven`t been seen for many years. &quot;We have gotten a huge boost.&quot; David Rollo who is responsible for the match operation in IMG Australia division said, &quot;If our results do not reach 80% of last week, we will lose a great opportunity.&quot;
<br /><br />The appeal of Tiger Woods is something worth our caution. Exactly, he always draws a large number of people wherever he is. The number of audience drawn by him made a historical record even when he took part in the HSBC champion competition in china. So far, Tiger Woods has got the champions in 13 countries, in fact, he lifted the trophy in each continent which he left his footprints. Even so, Melbourne is also one of the largest cities in the world.
<br /><br />People here have already seen too many champions of cricket, football, tennis, bike racing as well as swimming. But &quot;tiger&quot; Woods' charm is not the same as the other sports stars.
