<br /><br />she is my match.
<br /> she is a definite catch.
<br /> telling me we should hang.
<br /> oh yeah, such a fine thang.
<br /> been so long to feel.
<br /> anything for anyone still.
<br /> can't believe i can go back to me.
<br /> where i loved to be.
<br /> in the moment where.
<br /> i can do whatever without a care.
<br /> she makes the world seem okay.
<br /> that i can go back in the day.
<br /> i am happy with no fear.
<br /> back to the exact year.
<br /> before i lost the one.
<br /> when happiness was done.
<br /> i still believe in a certain good.
<br /> where it belongs where it should.
<br /> come out and consume.
<br /> my heart and resume.
<br /> back to the love i had.
<br /> where i never felt sad.
<br /> just to have a smile.
<br /> that is everlasting quite a while.
<br /> no more pain.
<br /> to contain.
<br /> i can finally be free.
<br /> from the hate that dwells in me.
<br /> the chain that's tight.
<br /> will now end tonight.
<br /> i want us not to fail.
<br /> cuz its been 2 yrs of hell.
<br /> for me to recover.
<br /> from the left marooned cover.

<br />your wondering what? taking mine back
<br />its a survivor after your attack
<br />its my heart she took with her
<br />need it now too old, dont whither
<br />it was new to you, never used
<br />taking it for pain, never abused
<br />its a power you never had 
<br />choosing between good never bad
<br />its my trip to gain my power
<br />i need it back just one hour
<br />it will be my last dying will
<br />these words you can never steal
<br />deep within its inside my heart
<br />you never saw this, cant take apart
<br />feeling bad? you should, your horrible
<br />i even once felt that your adorable
<br />nope, not no more, your two sided
<br />evil is that what you finally decided
<br />explains alot your the worst
<br />it came out your final burst
<br />i see the fire in your eyes 
<br />it shows all your deepest lies
<br />especially the one where you say
<br />'im a nice guy' that night, your last day
<br />but now im not so loving towards you
<br />im left marooned with nothing to do
<br />how does it make you feel?
<br />whatev. whats your deal?

<br />its a pain with no end
<br />laying here with no friend
<br />give up thats what i feel. run away
<br />its twisting in my mind everyday
<br />this is something i can not avoid
<br />all these drinks fill the void
<br />your my only treasure i only found 
<br />i kept digging under ground

<br />today I want to talk about letting people take control of your decisions. currently I am in a jam and I found myself making decisions to avoid someone who hangs around my true friends. I've been avoiding situations that contain that person, is that wrong? for some reason I feel like it is. even though I didn't do anything wrong. I guess that's what happens when you trust someone you used to care about a lot.

<br />I found out that I have more social networks than actual friends. I find that outrageous, crazy and true. lol. I can't believe I trust complete strangers to call themselves my friend on the Internet. I feel creepy also cuz I'm 22 and I rely on the Internet to make me social able. I have no excuse not to have friends in real life cuz I'm in school and there are plenty of ppl who are around to hang out with. I have just been in this college for way too long so I can say that these are ppl I already know and I already know that I don't like them.

<br />it's dusk right now I'm starting to wind down and I feel a little tired. but that is alright. I have to talk to a lady tomorrow and I dont want to. we talk about feelings and stuff and what types of things that bother me. now I'm looking at my flash drive from last year I believe, it's full of my art stuff that I drew for class. I can say that I actually used to suck at art. haha everyone keeps telling me I'm good which is very nice almost too nice.
