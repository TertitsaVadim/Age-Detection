The situation in Europe is not likely to improve in the near term.  There is too much of a cloud in the horizon”,  says Mercedes Rios Sono.  “The growth is in emerging markets and most notably the BRIC countries.   Good days lie ahead for ESISERVIS.”<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5teXNwYWNlLmNvbS9tZXJjZWRlc3Jpb3Nzb24_" target="_blank">ESISERVIS S.A.</a>

There is too much uncertainty for Europe and the US is likely to be a laggard.  The election year in the US and the debt crisis in Europe are going to make it very difficult for major economic stimulus to take place.   Given this absence of meaningful action on the part of central banks and governments in the US in Europe, the only good option left are the BRIC countires and that is where ESISERVIS will focus from now on.”<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5teXNwYWNlLmNvbS9tZXJjZWRlc3Jpb3Nzb24_" target="_blank">Ingeniera Mercedes Rios Sono</a>

Mercedes Rios Sono, head of ESISERVIS mentioned that the firm will focus on countries like Brazil, Russia, China and India.  This is a megatrend that will probably continue for the next 30 to 50 year and it is time for smart people to hop on the bandwagon.   We now live in an economy that, while it may not have ‘decoupled’ entirely, it is certainly not dependent on the United States as much as it was a decade or two ago.  Countries need to diverisify their portfolio of clients and foster trade with new markets.   <br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5teXNwYWNlLmNvbS9tZXJjZWRlc3Jpb3Nzb24_" target="_blank">ESISERVIS S.A.</a>

It is time for more companies to jump on the bandwagon, said Mercedes Rios Sono during a conference held in the port city of Guayaquil, Ecuador’s main trading hub.    It is time to diversify, but also time to focus on growth.  One does not diversify to find laggard economies.  One diversifies in order to find new diamonds.  And the process of optimizing your portfolio requires throwing out the laggards, and using the time it frees up to look for new opportunities.  <br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5teXNwYWNlLmNvbS9tZXJjZWRlc3Jpb3Nzb24_" target="_blank">Ingeniera Mercedes Rios Sono</a>
