<br />it's my math exam i'm worried about, my math teacher was horrible and almost everyone never gets his lessons(all except the really smart, and teachers pet people). at least i know that if i get 0 on the exam my mark will be 58%, which is passing. i wouldn't last a second in my house without my parents murdering me though. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/sad.gif" alt=":)" /> . there so hypocritical...they always tell me to do my best and then when i get an 80% their all like why didn't u do better. and my sister is an A+ student so they always judge me on that matter... when i was younger we gave ourselves self evaluations, i gave myself high marks and my parents would get mad, but i would say i thought you wanted me to be as good as my sister. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/angry.gif" alt=":)" /> and my parents always over look my good marks and go straight to the bad ones and asking me why the hell i got those marks. they always say there proud of me but ya right thats a bunch of bullshit!!! <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/dry.gif" alt=":)" />(sorry about the ranting i'm just really mad <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/angry.gif" alt=":)" /> and...sad... <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cry.gif" alt=":)" /> )

<br />Through trees, and bushes, rocks, and sand.
<br />Always running,
<br />Nights cold kiss apon my cheeks, 
<br />Autumn’s cool breath leaves my lips with quickness,
<br />Though I never tire;
<br />Never stop; never quit.
<br />The nights beautiful eyes sparkle down on me, 
<br />Watching, though never judging.
<br />I look at the moon’s fullness,
<br />It’s always full when I run,
<br />Always enchanting my eyes with its constant beauty,
<br />Telling me stories though never saying a word.
<br />The path ahead becomes rough and uneasy,
<br />I stumble many times falling,
<br />Getting back up and falling again,
<br />I fall one more time and my body stops,
<br />The run had taken strength and I look to the night sky,
<br />The night sky, in which starry eyes twinkle, I is dark blue,
<br />But begins to fade and the sky becomes black,
<br />Fear and anguish rushes through me,
<br />Everything begins to fade, the trees and bushes, rocks and sand,
<br />I remember the ruff ground that I ran over.
<br />It reminded me of ocean waves,
<br />It reminded me why I was running, and where I was running.
<br />Slowly I begin to get up
<br />The starry sky, and landscape reappear and I run once more,
<br />The jagged rocks turn to lush sand,
<br />And soon I’m running against the waves of the ocean,
<br />I see myself doing so, yet I’m watching myself disappear into the gleaming horizon 
<br />Disappear into the sunrays, the bright rays,
<br />Blinding me, reaching out to me, warming me...
<br /><br />I open my eyes and find myself in a room.
<br />The sun blazing through the window by the bed I lay on,
<br />The rays glimmer off the white washed walls and medical equipment
<br />A woman standing over me looks at me with delight,
<br />Her grey hair in a bun, and her blue eyes sparkle with excitement
<br /> She sits on the bed and tells me  “your in a hospital, congratulations, you survived!”

<br />I stared at the horrible sight 
<br />There I stood, and raging before me was what I feared the most.
<br />I trembled violently, closing my eyes
<br />Wishing for, with my luck, that he, my fear, would go away. 
<br />I dared not open my eyes, to see that sight…
<br />Then I began trembling again, but not of fear, of a cold, freezing touch.
<br />I moved away from the touch but it followed me 
<br />I tried again, eyes still closed, the touch automatically came back.
<br />A shiver washed over me; as he blew his cold breath down my back
<br />And I panicked; I could almost feel his joy eradiating off him.
<br />I could feel the freezing slowly taking over my body.
<br />There was no escape, no rescue; the battle was mine to fight alone.
<br />My breath became short gasps and the shivering seemed never ending
<br />My body could no longer move.
<br />I felt no hope, only gut-wrenching fear
<br />My mind was the only working thing left and as I thought I remembered a saying, “The only way to not fear is to face what you fear the most.”
<br />But how could I face him
<br />Me of all people, all my life I’ve been afraid and had not the courage to face anything 
<br />Had I not seen him already? But not in detail.
<br />I was so afraid that I hadn’t gotten a good look at him.
<br />I gathered enough courage to try to open my eyes but they had frozen shut
<br />Just as I began to panic again, I felt a sudden warmth of life. 
<br />At first I had thought I’d be fighting this battle alone but help arrived.
<br />The warmth managed to unfreeze my eyes
<br />I opened one at a time, what I saw was only darkness
<br />My fear was anguished and the warmth grew.
<br />And as it grew so did the light.
<br />At that moment of sudden courage, a courage I’d never felt before, I saw him, really saw him.
<br />The thing I’ve been afraid to open my eyes to see. 
<br />He was so close to me, I hadn’t realized his breath, but for some reason now I did. 
<br />I was invited to the rancid smell of death.
<br />I freaked, his touch, his face, everything about him I feared
<br />Closing my eyes tight I began to shiver once more, but the cold didn’t return warm life had gotten the cold death away from me. 
<br />Life prodded me to open my eyes without a word.
<br />I obeyed his silent order and was rewarded with a warm smile from life.
<br />Death being impatient attacked life, but life was ready.
<br />I watched in awe as the battle wore on.
<br />It was an epic battle between the warm sword blade of life and the freezing sword of death.
<br />I knew why life had me open my eyes, he knew he’d need my help…
<br />It struck me that yet again I’d have to face that gut-wrenching fear.
<br />Could I face it? Could I help life, my savior, from death?
<br />As I contemplated death managed to pin life.
<br />“No,” I screamed as death lifted his weapon for the final blow.
<br />Death looked up, and I gave a shudder.
<br />That face, I knew it but whom? No, no, no! 
<br />It was my archenemy Nat!
<br />Anger gave me power to speak again, “you wanted me so come and get me!” I exclaimed, with more courage in my voice then I felt.
<br />Why? Why did I do that?
<br />Fear, like the courage, I’d never felt until those agonizingly slow moments when death…Nat came to stand over me.
<br />His yellow eyes pierced into me, and his dirty blond hair blew in a breeze that only seemed to be around him.
<br />Life was saved that’s all that mattered.
<br />Now life could help others from a fate I was soon to encounter.
<br />As long as life was okay dying seem normal even though I've only lived 15 years.
<br />Looking around Nat I could see life’s face as he had managed to get up and stalk towards us.
<br />Life had sharp red eyes and light brown hair…I saw my boyfriend Dakota’s face!
<br />No wonder I cared so deeply for life!
<br />The time Nat took to savor his victory Dakota reached us.
<br />Dakota’s blade sliced easily into Nat, 
<br />gasping Nat clutched his heart and disappeared.
<br />Though I knew that a time would come when I’d see death, but not as Nat… 
<br />Dakota and I hugged, he stroked my dark brown hair and he looked lovingly into my bright teal eyes.
<br />He began to disappear and was soon gone. 
<br />The dim light of my inner world faded to a blinding white.
<br />            * * * * * * * * * * *
<br />I looked up… I was lying down in a bed and I saw my parents by each of my sides. “Oh, my Emma.” My mother said gently hugging me. “What happened?” I managed to ask. “ You were skating when Nat came along and started a fight with you. You’d been knocked unconscious and almost froze when Dakota found you… Nat wanting your obvious death came and attacked Dakota.” My mother continued with a sudden proudness in her eyes, “ you awoke to find Nat pinning Dakota. You attacked and both you and Nat rolled onto the thin ice. It broke, but Dakota saved you... he didn’t…” my mother trailed off. Dakota hobbled into the hospital room doorway and finished the story, “ but I didn’t have enough energy to save Nat.” For a long moment we stared at each other, happy. my eyes closed and my inner world came into my view.
<br />                * * * * * * * * * * 
<br />I sat on the edge of a cliff over looking an ocean. 
<br />I looked up and Dakota sat beside me, the sun setting light shimmered off the water in a beautiful array of colors. 
<br />And there we sat holding hands…
