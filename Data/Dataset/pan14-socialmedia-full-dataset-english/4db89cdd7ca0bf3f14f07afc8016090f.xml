Using prescription medication to lose weight is definitely possible, but it is not as simple as popping a pill and the pounds will simply shed. Natural solutions for weight loss have the benefit of not giving you side effects that could be detrimental to your health; prescription meds more than likely will. Weight reduction is just like  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sunless-tanning-products.info"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.sunless-tanning-products.info</a> , the much more you take action on it, the greater it can be.<br /><br />Over-the-counter medication, or with the prescription, Xenical or Orlistat are very useful in helping people lower the amount of weight that they way. Alli is another drug that you can get over the counter and by prescription as well; this particular drug is a fat absorption inhibitor. After you take this pill, your body will not as easily absorb fat. This pill comes with a whole host of side effects that you should be aware of in your quest to remove body fat. Due to its ability to block other nutrients as well, other than fat, multivitamins are recommended by all those using this product. Often, those that take Xenical for several weeks or months can look forward to possible side effects that they may not like.<br /><br />Some people have found success when using Phendimetrazine, or Bontril, an appetite suppressant that actually works. To lose weight effectively, this pharmaceutical can help you eat less every day, especially if it is taken an hour or so before every meal that you consume. Using appetite suppressants like Bontril can definitely help you shed bodyweight, and should always be used with the proper diet and exercise program. The worst thing about these particular weight loss products is that they can become habit-forming. There are always side effects from these products. Furthermore, research suggests that most people who lose weight using Bontril end up gaining it back when they stop taking the drug.<br /><br />To lose weight, and also minimize the side effects and risks involved with taking prescription drugs, there are a few things to consider. First and foremost, always listen to your doctor when it comes to dosage and any precautions regarding the medication. Alcohol should never be used when swallowing your weight loss pills; combining these substances together could be life-threatening. Tell your doctor if you have a side effect while taking the prescribed medications so as to prevent any other possible maladies. Side effects are usually an indicator that your body is not happy and medication. You should also never take a drug longer than your doctor recommends. Your pharmacist can also be helpful in answering any questions about your medication. Regardless of your question, try to find someone who is knowledgeable and can give you an answer.<br /><br />Though usually not a problem, prescription drugs for weight loss can lead to problems down the road. Your physician will probably only recommend this type of weight loss product if your health is at risk. Prescription meds are definitely helpful for losing weight, but also make healthy choices in regard to your diet and staying on an exercise program.<br /><br />Additional Links:<br /> <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.blogster.com%2Fleroytderevino%2Fthe-positive-and-negative-aspects-of-ingesting-prescription-drugs-for-weight-loss"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.blogster.com/leroytderevino/the-positive-and-negative-aspects-of-ingesting-prescription-drugs-for-weight-loss</a>    <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thoughts.com%2Fleroytderevino%2Flosing-weight-with-prescription-drugs-is-this-a-safe-option-to-try"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.thoughts.com/leroytderevino/losing-weight-with-prescription-drugs-is-this-a-safe-option-to-try</a>

There are tons of great items online or in local stores - and you can get them used to save money. This doesn't mean you have to buy junk, as there are plenty of objects in perfectly good condition that other people have discarded for a variety of reasons. You can find these on eBay, at flea markets and garage sales or thrift shops. Another great idea is to check for any big auctions in your city. If you're serious about decorating on a dime don't forget to check out your local Dollar Tree.<br /><br />Use window treatments as a means of decorating your room but also of regulating the light coming into the room.

If you want to make your own there are plenty of specialty stores from which to pick out the perfect fabric or you can buy ready made curtains and blinds online or in local home improvement, home decorating, and department stores.

It doesn't even really matter if your room has carpet right now. Changing the carpet or adding a rug is a big way to make a difference in any room. Does the carpet you have now look good with the rest of the room? There are some rooms where full carpeting is part of the &quot;atmosphere&quot; of the room. It makes them warm and inviting. However, there are times when a small area rug or an Oriental rug can really make a statement in the room. There may be several options available. Just remember that when it comes to carpet it's better to pay for good quality from the very beginning.<br /><br />There's no one right way to decorate a home, and you have to consider the kind of style you prefer. Sometimes several different elements can be attractive by themselves but don't go very well together, so you always have to consider this before buying something new. Also keep in mind that no matter how you decorate the room it needs to be appropriate for how you want to use that room.<br /><br />Additional Links:<br />   <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thoughts.com%2Fleroytderevino%2Fhome-decorating-suggestions-any-home-can-benefit-from"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.thoughts.com/leroytderevino/home-decorating-suggestions-any-home-can-benefit-from</a>

This type of fishing can be done most of the year and there are many locations that will provide ample opportunity to catch one. Largemouth bass are a satisfying fish to engage, as they're on the large side, and they don't give in without a fight. Sportsmen typically release the fish after catching it, however some people do eat the large mouth bass once they're caught. Whether you need to get far better at bass fishing or any other  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sunless-tanning-products.info"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.sunless-tanning-products.info</a>  related thing, you must concentrate on top quality results.<br /><br />Any angler which experience knows that fish behavior is unpredictable and that it varies depending on the weather conditions, time of day or time of year. That's why you should pay careful attention to the forecast before you go fishing. Not everyone enjoys being out in the rain when fishing, but it can really pay off since the rain will bring the baitfish that the bass feed on close to the surface. When the smaller fish feed on the surface insects it attracts the bass who feed on the baitfish. Days that are very sunny, on the other hand, will tend to keep the bass in their secluded hideaways and harder to find. Bass seem to start to instinctively feed when a cold front is coming in, so you can take advantage of that and maybe catch a lot of bass.<br /><br />The rod and reel of course are the most basic pieces of equipment you'll need for fishing. If bass fishing is a new sport you are trying, don't invest a lot of money in the beginning on the most expensive equipment out there. The best rod for you to use is a 6 foot medium action rod. A good choice for a rod is one that is made of graphite because it is durable and light. When it comes to your reel, your best choice is an open faced spinning reel, which will be easiest for you to manage. The reel should be able to hold a lot of fishing line, at least 150 feet. Making sure you choose the right fishing line is also important, a good choice is monofilament line with low visibility.<br /><br />Large mouth bass, for the most part, are not caught for eating, although some people still have them for dinner every day. Basically, very few people eat large mouth bass. Usually, people do not like the very potent taste of large mouth bass. What it comes down to is knowing how to prepare it and when done properly it actually tastes just fine. Of course, when it comes to fishing these days, you have to make sure that it's safe to eat any fish that you catch. It is a good idea to find out if the particular body of water that you are fishing in is chemical free and does not have dangerous toxins.<br /><br />This article has touched on a few specific issues in regard to bass fishing, but there is much more to learn. When you do bass fishing your very first time, you may enjoy it even if you do not hook a single fish. It just takes a little bit of time, and the more that you learn, the more proficient you will become at bass fishing.<br /><br />Additional Links:<br /> <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thoughts.com%2Fleroytderevino%2Flearn-about-bass-fishing"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.thoughts.com/leroytderevino/learn-about-bass-fishing</a>

Exercising by running is something that you can do without a special weight room or going to a class at the local gym. You're also burning up lots of calories and improving your stamina and level of fitness. In the following paragraphs, we will describe why running is one of the best ways to lose weight. Regardless of whether it really is about losing weight or some thing else associated with  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sunless-tanning-products.info"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.sunless-tanning-products.info</a> , your aim should be clear.<br /><br />If you want to get the most out of your running program, you shouldn't run at the same pace during every session. You should mix things up and make it more interesting and challenging for your body. This is what you should do providing you've been at it long enough to build up endurance, but when you first begin, do what you can do. Three different types of runs should be alternated, those focused on long distance, those focused on speed, and also those that are easy. You need to build up stamina along with speed, but you need to do them at different times, instead of together. The easy runs will give your body a break so you don't overdo it.<br /><br />Many people that run will have a sports watch with them so that they can track their progress as they do their exercises. The speed that you run at, and the distance that you cover, are very easy to monitor overtime using a sports watch or something similar. Having running and weight loss goals is a very useful way to make sure that you are losing weight and improving how far and fast you run. Setting reasonable goals, not expecting the impossible, are the keys to gradually improving over time and not getting injured in the process. For instance, if you set a goal of running 1 mile, you can make this goal achievable by doing a little bit of improvement each day.<br /><br />There are other exercises you should be doing, other than running, even though it is an exercise that is effective for weight loss. Recent research has shown that doing resistance training on a regular basis will help you lose weight faster, especially if you're also doing something aerobic like running. When you belong to a health club, you can do either lifting weights or resistance machines, and the result will be weight loss. When you take these two kinds of exercise and combine them you will get better results. The best program is probably to do them both on the same day, and if that is the case, you will need to do the resistance machines to begin with, before you end with your running program. When people know that doing both get faster results, they will want to do both.<br /><br />What you have read so far should get you started if you want to lose weight by running. Running is an enjoyable activity that has been around for a long time, and unless you are prevented from running by a disability or medical problem, there is no reason for you not to benefit from it. When you take up running, it can relieve your stress, and cause you to relax, while at the same time it is getting you into shape and helping you lose weight.<br /><br />Additional Links:

HTC has a good reputation for making quality mobile devices, and this model is quite popular, especially in Australia. The focus of this review will be on both the positive and negative aspects of this smart phone by HTC.<br /><br />HTC incorporated Microsoft technology in the form of Windows 7 OS into this phone, however, it is a little bit different than all the others. Local weather reports are accessible through the HTC hub which is different when compared to other navigation menus. This can be very useful, as you can get the weather report simply by glancing at your phone. Also included with this package is a note-taker, photo editor, and stock quote tool. There are many additional features and benefits, courtesy of HTC, that are different than those provided on Windows 7 smartphones.<br /><br />One of the best features on the HTC 7 Mozart Smart Phone is that it can take quality videos and pictures. Many of us like to upload videos to our favorite video site such as YouTube; this is me tremendously easier since you have a 720p HD video on this particular smartphone. E-mail your pics and vids to friends and family after you have taken them using this smartphone technology. Many phones have 16 Gbytes of memory, whereas the HTC 7 Mozart has about 8 gig which makes it kind of limited. There's also no way to expand this, as the phone lacks a microSD card slot. This won't be a problem for most people, but if you're someone who takes a large number of photos or videos, it's something to consider when comparing phones. The HTC Mozart is really a smart telephone just like  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sunless-tanning-products.info"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.sunless-tanning-products.info</a>  where you get what you pay for.<br /><br />Bing Maps, and WP7, are accessible when using the HTC 7 Mozart, which is extremely helpful if you're trying to locate a specific destination. This gives your smart phone the same capabilities as your desktop or laptop computer when you use the Bing browser. Only it's a lot easier to carry around the slim HTC 7 Mozart. If you use Bing Maps, you will notice that you have the capability to locate a certain type of destination and not just directions from here to there. Instead of just finding the directions to a known location, you can use Bing Maps to find hotels, gas stations, or restaurants in your area.<br /><br />Not everyone has the same needs when it comes to a smart phone, but the HTC 7 Mozart is one that will satisfy many people. Depending on where you live and whether you like the idea of using a phone with a Windows OS, this phone may be right for you. There are many reasons to choose an HTC 7 Mozart, but ultimately it comes down to how you feel about the look of the phone and its features.<br /><br />Additional Links:

Despite the recent problems that have afflicted Japan in recent months, it remains one of the most interesting countries in the world. You can fly into Tokyo, which is one of the most populated and busy cities in the world. Still, close by are tiny villages with slow paces, ancient monasteries and beautiful mountains that can make you forget you live in the modern world. Japan, most likely moreso than any other nation, blends this contrast every single place that you go. When you want to plan a trip to Japan, checking out one of the great fares or travel packages that will afford you the opportunity to really see this country.<br /><br />Some airlines, including All Nippon Airways have realized that the difference in service between Economy and Business would be useful so they started adding Premium Economy. This is helpful for people who are on a limited budget, but who want extra room and comfort not available in regular Economy. Premium Economy isn't available on every single ANA flights, but it is available if you are flying between Tokyo and LA, San Francisco, Chicago, Washington DC, Munich and Paris. This choice gives you a better chance of stretching out while not making you pay the higher costs that are associated with First or Business class.

In addition to earning frequent flier miles by flying with the airline, you can also earn them through things like staying at partner hotels like InterContinental, Holiday Inn, the ANA Crowne Plaza and a bunch of others. You can also earn miles by shopping done with companies who are partners of ANA. This airline is a member of the Star Alliance and that means that you can the miles you earn through it on any other airline in the Alliance (and there are a lot of them). This means that you can earn miles no matter where you want to fly and use them to fly anywhere you want to go.<br /><br />These are just some things that will hopefully inspire you to find out more about All Nippon Airways. If you've ever thought about visiting Japan, you need to take a look at the ANA website to find out if any specials might be currently offered. All Nippon Airways has a great reputation for offering fantastic, convenient and comfortable service to Japan and other good destinations.<br /><br />Additional Links:

If so, you might love Apple's new iPhone 3GS Smart Phone. In regard to smartphones, this particular model a few years ago was the best in its league. New releases like the iPhone 4 have made this particular smartphone not as &quot;in demand&quot;. What is great about the release of the new iPhone is that it gives people a chance to try out the iPhone 3GS Smart Phone at a much lower cost.  No matter whether it is about biying the iPhone 3Gs wise phone or something else related to  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sunless-tanning-products.info"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.sunless-tanning-products.info</a>  - you ought to concentrate your efforts on what's proper.<br /><br />If you are a reader, the iPhone 3GS smart phone offers you a fantastic way to read new books on your phone. The iBooks app is available cost free through the Apple App Store and when you buy it you gain instant access to more than two hundred thousand books. Lots of these books are cost fee but each of the books you pay for is still cheaper than buying the book in hardcover or paperback. The Kindle app is also available and gives you access to the Amazon Kindle titles. That means that when you own an iPhone 3GS you won't have to purchase an e-reader (Kindle or otherwise), because your phone serves that purpose. The much smaller screen is a drawback, of course, so if you really enjoy reading e-books, you might still want to buy a Kindle or maybe even an iPad to serve this purpose.<br /><br />The cost of smart phones has been one obstacle for many people. Spending several hundred dollars on a phone is a large decision to make; you need to know having a phone is worth all that money. Right now, however, you can get an iPhone 3GS smart phone for $49, which is considerably less than what you'd normally pay for any kind of smart phone. The catch is that you have to sign a two year contract with AT&amp;amp;T. Yet if you want to get an iPhone at a bargain price, this may be a good option for you. Basically, if you want to have a mobile phone, more than likely you're going to have to sign-up for a contract and in this case, it's not a bad deal.<br /><br />Some people have the notion that they can buy an iPhone 3GS at a low price and then download a more advanced OS such as iOS 4 or even iOS 5. It is possible to download any of the future Apple operating systems to your iPhone, however they will not work in the same way that they will in later iPhone versions. Downloading iPhone 4 or iPhone 5 operating systems to your iPhone 3 will not enhance your phone because they are made completely differently. While the iPhone 3GS has some multitasking abilities, for example, it doesn't compare to iPhone 4 in this area, and even downloading the later OS won't make much difference here. To conclude, do not buy an iPhone 3GS if your sole purpose is to get it cheap with the thought of upgrading it later.<br /><br />Apple typically produces some of the best products in the world, and that is exactly what you get with the features included on the iPhone 3GS smartphone. You might want to choose the iPhone 4 if you're not happy with products that are a couple years old. The iPhone 3GS is a great phone at a great price - you should probably check out this wonderful smartphone while the prices last.<br /><br />Additional Articles:<br />   <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fleroytderevino.livejournal.com%2F2751.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://leroytderevino.livejournal.com/2751.html</a>  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.democratandchronicle.com%2Fapps%2Fpbcs.dll%2Fsection%3Fcategory%3DPluckPersona%26amp%3BU%3D27cb60d953b94a8f941716d4319a581e%26amp%3BplckPersonaPage%3DBlogViewPost%26amp%3BplckUserId%3D27cb60d953b94a8f941716d4319a581e%26amp%3BplckPostId%3DBlog%253a27cb60d953b94a8f941716d4319a581ePost%253a5ce736f7-a404-41a3-baf6-c2dc61b8016f%26amp%3BplckBlogItemsPerPage%3D5"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.democratandchronicle.com/apps/pbcs.dll/section?category=PluckPersona&amp;U=27cb60d953b94a8f941716d4319a581e&amp;plckPersonaPage=BlogViewPost&amp;plckUserId=27cb60d953b94a8f941716d4319a581e&amp;plckPostId=Blog%3a27cb60d953b94a8f941716d4319a581ePost%3a5ce736f7-a404-41a3-baf6-c2dc61b8016f&amp;plckBlogItemsPerPage=5</a>

If you like to snack on sugary foods, then that is a favorite target for the chopping block. Whether that is incorrect or not all depends on quite a few factors. At this point in the game, you can accomplish your dieting goals while still enjoying what you like to eat. The world is full of food that is very good tasting, and you can eat what you like and minimize calories. You can achieve that with the right knowledge, and it all starts here, today. No matter whether it is about lowering calories or anything related to  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sunless-tanning-products.info"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.sunless-tanning-products.info</a> , be sure you are taking consistent action.<br /><br />People usually choose things like smoothies instead of real food when they are dieting. Part of the allure is they are fast to make and can be made low calorie. You can put fruits and juices in them that seem healthy, and they are, but the calorie count can really sneak up on you. We suggest you mix it up with smoothies that are definitely low in calories or something like oatmeal. You can eliminate hundreds of calories right there from your diet with your morning meal.<br /><br />Use a smaller sized plate when you serve up your food. Believe it or not, this really will help you cut calories. It only makes sense that when you use a big plate it will look a bit empty if it is not filled up and you may do just that. Space is the issue, smaller means lesser food. This will aid in the reduction of the foods you typically eat, but with a lesser amount. Simply exchanging a twelve inch plate for a ten inch one will reduce the amount you consume by twenty five percent. This, in turn, can help you save upwards of five hundred calories per meal.<br /><br />People do not normally think about their sleeping habits when they are thinking about losing weight. Well, for one thing, your body is still burning calories while you sleep. Have you not noticed that everything just seems to go better after a solid night of high quality rest? It takes more energy to deal with things when you are not rested, and that could lead to eating too much. Snack foods are popular because they are fast and taste good, and when you are over-tired you will eat more bad junk foods.<br /><br />It is really pretty easy to start burning more calories, and we have given you a couple of very simple strategies to do that. Try to uplift your self and be more positive about what you can accomplish because you really can do more if you put your mind to it. If you have not exercised in a long time, though, make an appointment with your doctor and get a check-up, first.<br /><br />Additional Articles:<br />.

However, beginning in the 20th century, you could get your gelato fix from the cart of a street vendor.

The ice cream in America is generally cream-based whereas gelato is made using milk. As a rule of thumb, gelato will usually have less calories than ice cream. If you don't want to use milk, or have a lactose intolerance, you can prepare gelato using soy products or even yogurt. Normally, this would also lower the calories per serving. If you search around, you can also find sugar-free gelato or, if you are making your own, you can use a sugar substitute in place of the sugar.<br /><br />The media is paying more attention to cooking healthier foods and this is drawing people's attention to the benefits of including Italian ice creams into their diet.

Imagine that. Keep things simple and you will have better luck with the time you are investing in your healthy wellbeing. You can become quite frustrated when you are bombarded with all of the suggestions made by all of the different sources out there; all telling you what you need to do in ways other than what you are doing. You can become a much healthier person just by following a few simple steps. We will suggest a couple of ways to improve your health.<br /><br />Vitamin D is important to take. Without vitamin D your health will suffer. You should wear sunscreen when you are out in the direct sunlight, but the best way to get vitamin D is from the sun, so go outside sometime during the day. Instead, take a Vitamin D supplement. Most multi vitamins will give you around 400 IU of Vitamin D. That is great way for you to make sure that you get enough vitamin D each day. Vitamin D is one vitamin that can keep you from dying an early death, according to the Archives of Internal Medicine, and that by as much as seven percent. <br /><br />When you clean your home use wipes rather than sprays. When you want to clean your home using a spray cleaner, you can pick from a rather large selection.<br /><br />Spray cleaners usually contain chemicals that can harm, not only your skin and eyes, but also your lungs, if you breathe in the chemicals. People with asthma especially will do well to avoid spray cleaners. Whenever you need to clean anything, it would be better for you to soak a sponge, and use it for wiping things down, rather than using a spray, even made out of natural ingredients.<br /><br />Sleep for enough hours. Adults on average call for somewhere in the range of 7 hours of sleep at nighttime. Though some people do fine with 6, others necessitate 8, therefore 7 is a great target. Your brain calms down and processes the day's events and your muscles fix themselves while you sleep and this is why your body needs sleep. Receiving plenty of sleep guards you from emotional and physical troubles. Additionally, not only does the body mend itself, but it takes your snoozing as an opportunity to labor through the strain you sense during the day. There are a lot of modest applications you can add to your lifestyle that will increase your health and wellbeing. The fact is that trying too hard to be healthy can actually work against you. Getting upset and taking on too much at one time could result in an ineffective weight loss program and staying healthy. Basic alterations to our every day routine can be a good way to enhance our lives and live a healthier lifestyle.<br /><br />You will find, like we all have, that acquiring new knowledge involves dedication and responsibilities, and that applies to  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sunless-tanning-products.info"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.sunless-tanning-products.info</a> , as well. There has really never been a lack of content, or information, and the web has only just made it more readily available plus encouraging people to produce more. What we all see very clearly are competing points of view, opinions and even conflicting research results. When you read about particular strategies for your online business, keep those points in mind as we are certain you will encounter this phenomena. After awhile you will become very adept at separating truth from fiction.<br /><br />Additional Articles:<br /> <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fleroytderevino.livejournal.com%2F3256.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://leroytderevino.livejournal.com/3256.html</a>

Our decision to research and explore this began one day just like yours did.<br /><br />What you will find here is well-researched information that you can trust and build upon and go forward with. There are so many positive benefits to keeping the level of curiosity high, and we think you know that all too well. Of course you know there are challenges along the way, and that is true of anything you do or learn about.<br /><br />The reason you should read this article is simple and profound because it is knowledge that you have been searching for all along.<br /><br />If you want to find a Captain Jack Sparrow costume you aren't the only one; this is one of the most popular costumes out there. You can go about finding this costume in a number of ways, depending on whether you want to buy, rent or make a costume. In this article, we'll be discussing a few key points to keep in mind when shopping for a Captain Jack Sparrow costume.<br /><br />Since Captain Jack Sparrow wore many different getups in the movies, there isn't just one costume to choose. If you look at the different Pirates of the Caribbean movies you will see that Johnny Depp changes his outfit many times. While you'll want to have a good pair of boots, a hat and sword, the rest of the costume is fairly changeable. As long as you're able to get the pirate-like look down and include the convincing details (beard, dreadlocks) you can pull off quite a good Captain Jack Sparrow. If you're going to be purchasing a ready made costume, the work will have been done for you. If, however, you are putting the costume together on your own with things you've bought or found, you should watch one of the movies (if not more) to get at least a small idea of how Captain Jack Sparrow looks. <br /><br />It doesn't matter which kind of Captain Jack Sparrow costume you choose for yourself, you should also wear makeup to add extra enhancements to your appearance. Because you have probably watched at least one of the Pirates of the Caribbean movies, you already know that Johnny Depp wears lots of makeup, especially eye makeup.<br /><br />You can also help yourself look more like a pirate by adding a scar or two to your face. You can find really good makeup for this sort of thing either at your local costume shop or on the Internet. It's better to have someone else do the drawing for you--unless, of course, you have lots of experience with makeup--using photos they've found online or from the movies for inspiration. If you really want your Captain Jack Sparrow costume to feel authentic, makeup is a good way to achieve that.<br /><br />If you are dressing up with a group of other people, it's a good idea to coordinate your efforts. Only one person should be Captain Jack Sparrow but the other people can play supporting characters. There are plenty of great choices for women who want to dress as pirates as well, especially if they model themselves on the Elizabeth Swann character--who was brought to life by Keira Knightley in the Pirates of the Caribbean movies. There are plenty of different Elizabeth Swann costumes out there and no matter which you choose, you'll make a great couple with Captain Jack Sparrow. Another great role for men is Davy Jones, the villain with tentacles attached to his face. When you want another popular costume selection that relates to pirates, Davy Jones is a good choice. <br /><br />Captain Jack Sparrow costumes are really likely to be around for quite a long time because this is a character who has managed to really capture peoples' imagination. As you have read, you can choose between buying, renting or making costumes of your own. When you have the right makeup, accessories and some imagination, you should be able to turn yourself into a fantastic modern day Captain Jack Sparrow.<br /><br />Additional Resources:<br /> <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.quechup.com%2Fblog%2Fentry%2Fview%2Fid%2F319135"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.quechup.com/blog/entry/view/id/319135</a>  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fthurmanjkgardn.posterous.com%2Fcaptain-jack-sparrow-costume-getting-one-that"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://thurmanjkgardn.posterous.com/captain-jack-sparrow-costume-getting-one-that</a>  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fleroytderevino.livejournal.com%2F3522.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://leroytderevino.livejournal.com/3522.html</a>
