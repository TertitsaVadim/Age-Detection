<br /><br />They long to be with people they love but refuse to admit openly. Some are afraid to show even the slightest sign of affection because of fear. Fear that their feeling may not be recognized or, even worse, returned.. 
<br /><br />But one thing about human beings that puzzles me the most is their object of affection, even if it kills them slowly within..
<br /><br />-Sigmund Freud

<br /><br />Sometimes destiny isn't always good, it becomes playful..
<br /><br />When you meet someone you learned to love, you relate your crying over love stories, hand you the remote, pass on booze night just to listen to your ranting, don't flare up when you give car directions, says I'm sorry and tells you he needs you.
<br /><br />Now if you think you've found your man -- Rejoice! And never let him go.
<br /><br />MEN ARE SELDOM MADE!

<br /><br />Meet all of them with a peaceful heart, but with a warrior's spirit.
<br /><br />You may fail many times, but in falling you will learn. And in learning, you will find your way.
<br /><br />Remember, there are no mistakes in life- only lessons. And lessons will keep on repeating themselves until &quot;LEARNED&quot;

Don't ever settle for mediocrity. For being just an option, for being the one who's just fun to be with, for being the one who's always there desperately waiting, for mere concern or pity or for someone who likes you just because he/she knows he's/she's got the power to break you. Don't settle because deep down, you know who you are. And you know without a doubt that you deserve better if not the best.. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/biggrin.gif" alt=":)" />

That promises can be broken just as quick as they're made.. That sometimes goodbyes are really forever.. And always remember to use &quot;I love you&quot; with extreme caution.. Coz if you used it in a wrong way, someone will end up getting hurt.. Remember that it shouldn't be an everyday word.. It also shouldn't be said just because you're expected to say it.. Make sure you know how and when to use it.. Coz once you're in love.. It shouldn't be that easy to fall out of love.. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/ohmy.gif" alt=":)" />

<br />     We deny that we're tired.. 
<br />     We deny that we're scared.. 
<br />     We deny how badly we want to succeed.. 
<br />     We deny that we're hurting.. 
<br />     And we deny that we're in denial.. 
<br />     We only see what we want to see.. 
<br />     And we believe what we want to believe.. 
<br />     We lie to ourselves so much that after a while the lie seems to be the truth.. 
<br />     We deny so much tha we can't recognize the truth right in front of our faces.. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cool.gif" alt=":)" />

<br /><br />Sometimes love means asking for less when you begin to expect too much...
<br /><br />Sometimes love means moving on even if there is still a reason to stay...
<br /><br />Sometimes we just have to be thankful that we have loved someone...
<br /><br />Even if that person didn't love us back, for it is always better to have loved and failed than not to have experienced it at all...

<br /><br />At the end of the day, what makes a man ask for your number or want to ask you out, is not because you look like America's next top model, but because you are a woman with opinion..
<br /><br />Fashion sense helps, but brains will always be more deadly than a pair of stilletos..

<br /><br />That sometimes the heart does get tired of longing, of hoping.
<br /><br />That sometimes you just have to accept the fact that some things can never be and that you should be contented with things as they are.
<br /><br />Leaving is a choice.
<br /><br />Staying is a choice.
<br /><br />But you can never really ask someone to stay or leave.
<br /><br />It's a choice thay have to make for themselves and sometimes no matter how much you beg someone to stay or how hard you try to make someone leave, you really have no control over what they will choose..

<br /><br />1&gt; Regular naps prevent old age, especially if you take them while driving.
<br /><br />2&gt; Having one child makes you a parent; having two makes you a referee.
<br /><br />3&gt; Marriage is a relationship wherein one person is always right and the other person is the husband.
<br /><br />4&gt; They said we should all pay our taxes with a smile. I tried but they wanted cash.

<br /><br />Sometimes all we can do is stay away, and it does help a bit, but just for a while..

<br />We were given good but we keep on seeking for the best
<br />Which sometimes leads us to missing the simple yet satisfying part of this journey..

<br /><br />We set requirements,
<br /><br />we target the ideal..
<br /><br />So where do we end up?!
<br /><br />We end up hoping that the ones we have left behind still have space for us,

<br /><br />Why?
<br /><br />Cause love is more than words can say.
<br />Once you've fallen, you can't help but fall over and over again.
<br />So even if goodbyes have been said, there's something in the heart that says,
<br /><br />&quot;please stay.&quot;
<br /><br />Why?
<br /><br />Cause it's love.
<br />And the reason is unknown.
<br />Despite the pain and the heartaches, love will always retain,

<br />It's sweetness.
<br />It's mystery.
