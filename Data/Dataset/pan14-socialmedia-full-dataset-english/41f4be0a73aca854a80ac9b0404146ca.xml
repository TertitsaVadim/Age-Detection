I'm talking about Jose Bautista Jersey one thing that matters drastically to over your main character. It's bigger than her, him, or it. It takes hold and drives your story to the end.<br /><br />This important point is greater than a private love spat, and even a trip to the hospital. It takes over a life, a family members, a city, the community, or a whole nation. In well-liked women's novels, that factor Jose Bautista Jersey is not the community, city, or nation; it's your character's individual desire. Did she get the man? The career?
