<br />view when the veil was ever slowly pulled of 
<br />her face.  She came to live, staring out with the most beautiful brown eyes you can imagine, looking at you.  She has hair so beautifully waved and cascaded down her smooth graceful back.  She perched herself on the rock with her feet dangling down in the sand touching the ocean.  She held her right hand on her lap while she let her left hand rested on the side leaning, balancing herself while she smile the mysterious smile of hidden secrets watching you staring at her.  She wore a mayflower on her right ear, and she ever leaned forward a little to make sure she got your attention,and she has on a lovelova, and a top of exotic flowers of the valleys, and behind her you can see the clouds with bright sky shining down on her.  The breeze is blowing her hair while she smiled and waiting for her love to sweep her off her feet and home he takes her. 
<br />She will always be perch on the right shoulder being with her love forever and ever.
<br />Maybe, just maybe she will receive an ink name in the future.

This place is home to a lot of people like me and my people.  Then one day, as I was looking in the image glass, I thought to myself, where are the cultures, the traditions that ties everyone to this place?  Where is this place anymore...it is like printing on moneys, we cash them out, we use them like its going out of style.  Like the ten dollars, that printed &quot; We are the People&quot;...these are some of the things we take for granted. We forget where we are going because there isn't anyone to take us there.  
<br />     Do we actually need association members to lead?  Or do we really need each other to walk together a we came out of the Liberation Day...
<br />We uses symbols like the flying Eagle on Twenty dollars...but is that telling us that we don't give up so easily or just an image to remind us that cash is beautiful...What does it mean these days?
<br />When we come together and believe that we can be GForce...then we can be the &quot; We are the People&quot;...
<br />Who are you?

<br />To perfectly acquire the skill, one has to have a new combination of the mind and soul adjustments. Through persistent effort he/she stumbles upon the &quot; happy combination <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/biggrin.gif" alt=":)" /> &quot; of requring the mentality and can then proceed to success.
<br />The &quot; happy combination <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/biggrin.gif" alt=":)" /> &quot; is one that will keep him/her afloat and is the effect he/she was seeking in trying out different &quot; Structural Method&quot; of aquiring intellectual progresses. 
<br />Structural Association has but only Three detail steps that can exemplify these main conditions.
<br /><br />One:  A previous comman of the elements entering into the combination.
<br /><br />Two:  A sense of the effect to be produce.
<br /><br />Three:  A Voluntary process of trial and error continue until the desire effect is actually produce.

I entered and there was two people playing pool, one was a man of medium height, blond hair, wearing glasses, and about six feet one.  He's from Minnesota and he was playing pool with this girl wearing a black halter top.  She has black hair, heavy set and about five feet or shorter than that.  The guy stood up and was saying something to her while she was sitting in the chair, and all of a sudden he just yanked her arm pulling her to go dancing to a country music playing that night.  She didn't look to happy because she didn't know how to dance the steps. But the Manager saw it and he blew the whistle on him for being a cad.  The nights went on awhile until one day we saw them standing outside wondering what happened to the establishment...then it accurred to them that it got closed down because someone blew the whistle on them.  It became known that Whistlers are the Starters of Montana....Could it be them? <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/w00t.gif" alt=":)" />

They are expected to be deferential rather than ambitious, and preference maybe given to women who are young and sexually attractive.  Often, part of the job* is to look and be feminine* in dress and manner. The professions include the arts, law, medicine, teaching and management.  They often require more training and educatoin than other kinds of work, although critics claim that the structure of the prefession is often designed more to preserve class provileges lengthy training that only some people can afford, than enhance the quality of the work performed.  Most of the professions set their own standards for qualifications and performance and generally pay more than blue and pink collar work.
<br />This work issue is not only based on the fact that jobs are scarced, but based on the fact that most of the people out there, middle class, and lower class people are not getting the education and job they wanted.  So who's fault is that?  Is it the us the community because we are not coming up with constructive ideas to formulate something good out it...or is the government's fault because they don't have experience people to construct something some great idea and present it for whats it worth?  I believe this two things go together and if a women in society can lead because they can construct and implement some kind of plans for Contingent Workers and people in general who are willing to be held accountable to the societies managements...the  it should all come down to having the benefits and security associated with full-time employment. And workers who are willing to build on a FOUNDATION that a society can stand on firm and proven effective.  Who is that woman to be? <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/biggrin.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" /> YOU!!!

I just came from school, which the Walk that my friend Cyril and I had taken to make it to school and back to our place did take eight miles and almost two hours.  He usually walked one have miles and I would do the rest all alone in the heat of about 9o out. I got to that place and was waiting for my other friend to finished work and we walked the rest of the walk home to where she lived across from my own place.  She was still busy getting the last minute things out when I realized just how thirsty I was, and I didn't feel like I wanted to drink any kind of soda.  I started to think of the kind of drink I could drink to quenched my thirst.  And the funny thing about this whole episode of thinking about Vitamine Water, was I just finished having an argumentive conversation with my sister accusing me of drinking too much...and yet she didn't finish the whole sentence....and I jumped in and said, &quot; Well, if I don't drink I will be dehydrated&quot;.  So I sat next to those trash and thinking of a drink and the argument we had, then for some reason, felt like a cold breeze with hold hands touching me, and I felt it going over my body down to my very toes, and all the way into my hair...and that was when I started to think that I wanted to drink a drink called &quot; Vitamine Water&quot;. I went right then and emailed my cousin and told him that very news, it was like I couldn't wait for it to last another minute.  It was so special yet so unreal the feeling I had to have it.  I never forgot the name until to this day...and today I am drinking my Vitamine Water with lots of flavor.
<br />I feel good and I will never forget that feeling again for I felt it again so recently and this time I rushed and told my sister.  It was so great a feeling, a rich feeling as if you are cruising on a Yacht through the horizon.  It was just right.  And it was just right!

And living anywhere in the world and not Alabama, can make you understand that white minority of the world has spend centuries making you believe that white skin makes people superior,even though the only thing it shows is the affected by ultraviolet rays and wrinkles. Men and women are the same as they are alike.
<br />To listen to a woman descbribe the surprised arrival of monthly cycle makes anyone cringed with embarrassment. So to listen to a woman addressing an all male audience,&quot; you should be proud to have a mentruating woman on your side.&quot;  So what happen if suddenly, magically, men could menstruate, and women could not? Obvisouly men menstruation would become an enviable, boast-worthy,masculine event. They would boast of how long and how much. And it would be the beginning of manhood.  Gifts, religious, ceremonies, family dinners,and stag parties would mark the day.
<br />To prevent monthly work loss among the powerful, Congress would fund a National Institute of Dysmenorrhea.  Sanitary supplies would be federally funded and free.  Of course, some men would still pay for the prestige of such commercial brands as Paul Newman Tampons, Muhammad Ali's Rope-a-Dope pads, John Wayne Maxi Pads, and George Bush overnight Silheoutte protected pads. The fundamentalists would cite menstruation as proof that only men could serve God and country in combat.  &quot; You have to give blood to take blood&quot;. occupy high politcal office.  &quot; Can women be properly fierce without a monthly cycle governed by the planet Mars?, be priests ministers, God Himself &quot; He gave his blood for our sins&quot; or rabbis &quot; Without a monthly purge of impurities, women are unclean&quot;. male liberal or radicals would insist that women are equal just different and that any woman could join their ranks if only she were willing to recognize the primacy of menstruation rights &quot; everything else is single issue&quot; or self-inflict a major wound everymonth &quot; you must give blood for the revolution&quot;.
<br />Street guys would invent slang &quot; He's a three pad man&quot; and &quot; gives fives &quot; on the corner with some exchange like man you lookin good. Yeah man on the rag it comes. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/w00t.gif" alt=":)" />

I came from the University, and since it was day off from work as well, I figured I'd call my roommate and find out what she had in mind for the evening. The reason was she was the nighter owl, she party continously throught out the weeks. And I always wonder what it would be like to hold it up like she did.  She was always laughing while I would be doing my studies, one day I thought I would just give it a try. So that Friday came along, and I agreed to go along with her. Little did I know how she goes to the bar. I first thought that she knew someone there. As we entered, I wanted to play pool, she didn't want to because she rather sit at the bar to talk to the guys.I went  along with her, she picked the guy she wanted him to buy drinks for her. I brought my own money. I like Miller Light beer so I ordered one for myself. The guy and she got alone fine that night and then I saw them go dancing. There were two other guys  next to me, we chatted and talked about music that was playing. When the music finished, they came and instead of her sitting next to me, he sat next to me. He can hear us talking about Mileage for flying and all the events that was happening. He went to the bathroom and when he came back, he's sitting in his own chair again. The roommate didn't like that he kept paying attention to our conversation. So instead of actualy talking to her, he was asking who I was. It came out that I was Kimberly that night. I didn't know how it happened, but I found out later that I was christening Kimberly that night. I didn't think it was a big deal to aquired a name. Boy was I wrong!!! It turned out that when she turned around to let me know that he was asking for my name, I merely told my roommate that it is okay to give my name. She didn't think it was okay, and I became Kimberly that night. The night went fine until it came to closing time. She couldn't walked home and I couldn't carry her or helped her. He came alone to help me get her home. At least that was what I thought it was until we got to the place. Make it short, we dated that night and to this day. That has been eight months now. But the funny thing about it, was how he found out my real name and How I found out that I had been christening Kimberly without my knowledge. It was the next morning when my other roommate came calling my real name and I responded to it. He turned around and said, &quot;what is your last name&quot;? I gave my last name, but already he was mad and very disappointed. I didn't understand what had happened, and later on few months later, was when I figured it out. So watch out for roommates when you go out. They can be vultures or they can be real good friends. I just want to share this first timer stuff, I think it is so cute and hilarious.

As I was sitting on the Rock looking out the bay, I see the light of a Nightengale, coming toward the bay as if it needs loving care and a place to spend the hard working day off. He lay down with his head on my lap, and whispering soft words into my ears, words of comfort and words of promises. I held his head and sing the song of love and and looking into the eyes of the brightest blue, yet I am only guessing for it was in the night. His wings were spread out as if he's ready to take off again, and I begged for him to stay. The moment those words came out, I knew then that was my ANGEL LOVE. He took me into the night of warm and promises that it always be that way forever. He soared the bay with me in his arms while his wings were engulfing me to keep me from the evils at night. He was the rock I can lean on, he was the wings I can be safe in, he was the Angel Love who didn't say much yet he knew everything. Soaring the sky of many stars, and exploring the myth of Night Wonders, and Stars of Wishes. Hope yours is as good as mine is...

A silence either of Health prevention, or a career gain out of deception, or simply because to silence a thought that has been nagging you for so long. Often afterwards when everyone left and you sit alone dwelling on everything that had happened, you wonder if you had added on to the silence or you actually managed to really covered up well. 
<br />I attended one party that turned out so perfectly done and people came with flowers, food and huge smiles to greeted and mingled. The party was thrown to celebrated an ill person, a person who can really write anything, he sold so many books from small poems to novels. But he had the illness, yet the society knew him before he was diagnosed, and he became the hermit after few years of being successful. It was not fair how nature took his life for he enjoyed every single moment of his success. Everyone gathered and mingled as if nothing had happened, or if tomorrow things will be the same as yesterday and the day before. Then in the end, everyone left and the hermit goes back to his corner and wished that he had never attened the party. The people left and he's forgotten until they are sent another card to call for another gathering. Then if goes on and on until one day he's gone from this life...would they still celebrate like they were before? We often ask how its expected to be done...Parties to cover the silence, or Silence to cover the parties done before? <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/sad.gif" alt=":)" />

Each smile has a future that's built in, made certain by a confidence in the &quot; better or worse&quot; &quot; richer or poorer&quot;, &quot; in sickness and in health&quot;, or not. How tender is the early touch,how daring thier belief that it will last.  And when it does, only later do the children learn how precious the gift of loyalty their parents gave.  Or if it goes the other way,how deep the wounds and their hostility.  And if they had the chance to redo how many would decide to just give love and not attempt to carry each and every day, to win each and every self created skirmish.  Is it possible to disengage, to decide that the burden of hate, even momentary, is too great?  Is it possible to believe that little losses given willingly can creat a hearty thruth that is expressed as confidence and trust and love, and that this can be achieved only when two agree to play.  Lovers understand that loving is not the same as winning, but more about creating.

Built into the human spirit, whether by spirit or serotonin, are moments of lightness, of defiance, and ability to recover from illness, of strengths, released through sparkling eyes, lips curved upward, a sound distinct from reason or heavy thoughts. A few in every culture have the skill to reach the hidden space in others where lives escape. They defy our pessimism and block it from pressing in, encroaching on our goodness. Who release gains entry to another's hidden space like any checmical reaction., Fast, spontaneous, creating new believers. Why not Santa Claus after all? If he would protect us. Why not laughter?
