Here the paper is separated into different categories according to type and grade; these categories include office waste, old magazine papers, newsprint, cardboard and corrugated cardboard.<br /><br />For the manufacture of high-quality paper that is not obviously recycled it is essential to use good-quality sorted office waste that can be used to produce high quality white pulp.<br /><br />Julian Long, national key account manager for paper manufacturer Arjowiggins Graphics explains: &quot;We are a large consumer of waste for recycling and for top- quality paper that has the same characteristics as virgin fibre, we need good-quality sorted waste. We can’t take newspaper or cardboard. The low-grade waste is used to produce materials where the appearance is not such a critical factor, such as corrugated cardboard and newspaper print.&quot;<br /><br />The sorted waste is then taken to a paper mill, where the paper is pulped and the ink is removed. After the paper has been de-inked, it can be bleached and made into new paper. Some virgin fibres may be added to the pulp for the manufacture of high-quality recycled paper, but low-grade products such as corrugated cardboard and newsprint can be made from 100% recycled fibres.<br /><br />Wood fibres in paper can typically be recycled five to six times before they become too weak and degraded for further use in papermaking.<br /><br />Long is keen to dispel the myths that surround paper recycling, which some sceptics claim is more damaging than making paper from virgin pulp.<br /><br />&quot;Manufacturing recycled paper produces between 20%-45% less CO2 than from virgin fibres,&quot; he explains. &quot;It also avoids landfill, which stores up waste for future generations to deal with. The other alternative would be to incinerate waste paper, but this releases CO2 into the air immediately.&quot;<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2JnbS5tZS9yLzIxMTE1NTY_" target="_blank">While the industry continues its long road to recovery, only the most optimistic would claim that UK print is back to full health.</a>

It is an important agenda to a lot of people and I believe it has helped us to attract customers, even when we are not necessarily the cheapest supplier.&quot;<br /><br />Money matters<br />But the benefits don’t stop at winning new business. Financial returns can also be more immediate thanks to the money you can generate from recycling. In the current economic climate, the financial benefits of recycling should not be overlooked.<br /><br />The Guardian Print Centre, which prints The Guardian and The Observer newspapers, is making around £2,000 per month profit from recycling its waste, which includes aluminium plates, waste chemicals, batteries, fluorescent tubes and IT waste.<br /><br />It works with waste management company J&amp;G Environmental, which offsets the cost of taking away chemicals against the value of the aluminium plates and sends the company a cheque every month for the balance.<br /><br />Engineering manager Danny Couchman explains: &quot;We’ve been working with J&amp;G Environmental since 2005. They take away all of our waste and if there is anything that they don’t deal with they will put us in touch with a company that does handle it.&quot;<br /><br />Arda Metal Packaging, which has three metal and three glass plants in the UK, has also discovered the financial benefit of recycling and has reduced the amount of waste it sends to landfill by 26 tonnes per month, which, as landfill tax is currently set at £56 per tonne, represents a huge saving.   <br /><br />The company, which recycles aluminium, plates, solvents, lacquers, oil drums, ink tins and gearboxes, has also cut its skip hire down from four 40-yard open skips per week to one 35-yard compacted skip per month.<br /><br />Arda Metal Packaging works manager Steve Niblett, says: &quot;The value of the aluminium plates almost writes off the cost of our waste disposal. We are now recycling or reusing around 85% of our waste – that’s 85% out of landfill.&quot;<br /><br />O’Connor says that the Tangent Group makes a profit of around £1,000 a month from its recycling, which has reached a heady 98% of waste.<br /><br />&quot;We’ve just renegotiated the rate we receive for our paper waste from £15 to £50 per tonne,&quot; he explains. &quot;We make more money out of paper as we don’t generate a huge amount of aluminium waste.&quot; <br /><br />Like Arda Metal Packaging, the Tangent Group has found that cutting down on landfill can also help to cut costs.<br /><br />&quot;We have significantly reduced the amount we were spending on skips and landfill taxes,&quot; O’Connor adds. <br /><br />So, at a time when many businesses are struggling in a difficult economic climate, how many can afford to throw away what could be valuable waste? With many printers doing their best to cut costs, boost profits and win new business, examining what’s in the skip could be just the ticket.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2JnbS5tZS9yLzIxMTc0MzU_" target="_blank">Banner picks up Carphone Warehouse contract off HH Global</a>

However, the Colour Bridge supplements for coated and uncoated papers will not be available until June.<br />Source: Print Week UK<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2FsYmVydG9idXNjaDMxNi5uZXdzdmluZS5jb20vX25ld3MvMjAxMi8wNS8zMS8xMTk4NjYzNi1hLWNyZWF0aXZlLWFwcHJvYWNoLXRvLWlubGluZS1tYW51ZmFjdHVyaW5nLWhhcy1naXZlbi10aGlzLW1haWxpbmctaG91c2UtYW4tZWRnZQ__" target="_blank">A creative approach to inline manufacturing has given this mailing house an edge</a>

Elsewhere, there are new CTP launches from the likes of Kodak, Agfa and Basyprint; plate launches from companies including Esko, Fujifilm and Presstek; and a wide range of software upgrades and new launches. Of the latter, Chilli Publish is attracting a lot of attention with its ‘InDesign in the cloud’ product, while Heidelberg’s Prinect Business Manager and the PantoneLive platform are both generating column inches.<br /><br />In presses, as we have discussed, it appears B2 digital is set to grab the headlines. However, there is much more to talk about. For example, there’s the return of Benny Landa; a real surge into packaging solutions; and the various practical (that word again) link-ups between litho and digital manufacturers. Partnerships particularly catching the eye are those of Timsons and Kodak, KBA and RR Donnelley and Konica Minolta and Komori. Over in wide-format, the continued evolution of latex solutions and a renewed focus on the pres-press and post-press elements of print are making headlines.<br /><br />Into post-press, and here it really is about the hand following the eye: post-press manufacturers striving to create machines that match what the press manufacturers are producing. This means more automation, more inline options, and an ability to cope with digital’s increasing speed.  Innovations on show include the Digimaster series from Morgana, new cutting equipment from Zünd and Kongsberg, a new feeder from Horizon and a new UV-spot laminator from Autobond.<br /><br />As Mataré says, though, alongside all these technological advances are a raft of environment and business ideas, alongside conferences and talks taking place all over the Messe halls. The Drupa Cube in particular is looking to be a must-attend.<br /><br />But what about those currently undecided about whether Drupa will be a worth an attendance altogether?<br /><br />&quot;For their business, for their technology and for their future – Drupa is a must,&quot; says Mataré. &quot;Also, this is a once-every-four-years occurrence. Miss it this time around and you have to wait four years until you get the chance again.&quot;<br /><br />The point behind those reasons is really that you now get out of the industry what you are willing to put in. Keeping abreast of what is happening, what is available and what direction the future holds when it comes to print is essential for the success of any print business, big or small. And to be able to get all that for the price of an air fare and a day ticket seems reasonable.<br /><br />Source: Print Week UK<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3BhdHJpa2tlbm5lZDI0Lm5ld3N2aW5lLmNvbS9fbmV3cy8yMDEyLzA2LzAxLzEyMDAxODA2LXdhbnQtdG8tbGVhcm4tbW9yZS1hYm91dC1lbWFpbC1tYXJrZXRpbmctcmVhZC1vbg__" target="_blank">Solid Email Marketing Advice For The New Business Owner</a>

She says the reasons for this are based not necessarily on ignorance, but more on time pressures. <br /><br />&quot;In this market, customers, particularly the smaller ones, don’t have a lot of time to build up a detailed knowledge of the environment, so they are reliant on certain certificates,&quot; explains Branch. &quot;For the customer, it needs to be simple.&quot;<br /><br />It is not surprising, then, that those credentials that can be expressed in the form of an official stamp of independent approval, rather than uncorroborated claims, are frequently cited as most desirable by print buyers. Not that the official stamps narrow the eco field of appraisal too far – there is still a wide comparison of accreditations, certificates and stamps to be made. <br /><br />At least unofficially, among the well known-names of FSC, PEFC, EMAS and countless others, print buyers do tend to place a higher regard on ISO 14001, an internationally recognised system monitoring the environmental targets companies set themselves and how they achieve and improve upon them. <br /><br />This certification is seen as a must-have for many print buyers, Parker says, and it is certainly no secret that the UK’s biggest print buyers need this in place before the sales process even begins.  <br /><br />The number of printers pursuing and gaining the accreditation suggests that they have recognised the power the ISO holds in print buyers’ eyes. But Chris Head, health, safety and environmental manager at Howitt, says the badge is more than attractive clothing to entice a buyer. Rather it has tangible benefits to the company as well, being a valuable tool to ensure that businesses achieve a high environmental performance. <br /><br />&quot;We look at it more from a point of view of what ISO 14001 can do for us,&quot; he says. &quot;If you have good benchmarking and good objectives and targets it can actually deliver quite a good saving for the company. <br /><br />For instance, waste on this particular site in 2005 was more than 500 tonnes to landfill; last year it was less than 25 tonnes. So the management of those parts of the business is extremely important and can produce a saving.&quot;<br /><br />Head does concede, however, that, for smaller businesses, the costs of achieving ISO 14001 recognition could be prohibitive. Expenditures to be taken into account are the twice-yearly audits, costing around a £1,000 each, and of course the salaries of workers like Head who ensure the systems are implemented. For print buyers to give precedence to an ISO seems an unfair bias, then, against smaller operations. <br /><br />That said, there are cheaper ways of implementing the ISO 14001 than the most widely respected UKAS accredited scheme. These include self-accreditation, and certification from a range of different bodies including Lloyds, BSI and AJA, all of whom might appeal to a company’s individual needs. But this might not get them very far with buyers who see a UKAS verified ISO 14001 as a must.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2xlYWZsZXRwcmludGluZzgxLndldHBhaW50LmNvbS9wYWdlL0Jhbm5lcitwaWNrcyt1cCtDYXJwaG9uZStXYXJlaG91c2UrY29udHJhY3Qrb2ZmK0hIK0dsb2JhbA__" target="_blank">Banner picks up Carphone Warehouse contract off HH Global</a>

Our success is down to a lot of hard work and not resting on your laurels. We looked at other companies and thought about how we could do it better.<br /><br />&quot;We are supplying a quick and low-cost service with credentials.

The top three TV listings titles – TV Choice, What’s On TV and Radio Times – still sell almost 3.5m copies combined every week.<br /><br />Business-to-business publishing has been particularly challenged, with a host of titles abandoning print altogether and moving to online-only editions. Recent speculation that Emap is poised to sell off its trade magazines wing could mean a significant chunk of print spend coming under a new owner, too.<br /><br />What the ABC figures don’t calculate, of course, is the pagination of the magazines being published. In a tough advertising climate, publishers dropping sections across hundreds of magazines has had an enormous knock-on effect for magazine printers’ production boards. All this in a print supply market already blighted by overcapacity, despite consolidation and closures in recent years.<br /><br />Overall, there are notable success stories, including the venerable Private Eye posting record circulation figures fresh from celebrating its 50th anniversary.<br /><br />Another of the positives to emerge from these tough times in magazine publishing is that it has also driven innovation.<br /><br />Recent examples include IPC Media’s new spin-off biannual fashion title Marie Claire Runway, printed sheetfed in an unusual oversized format to give the title stronger presence on newsstands as well as providing plenty of space to show off luxurious fashion imagery. IPC also produced a piece of proactive, fast-turnaround publishing after the sudden death of singer Whitney Houston, and had a special one-off tribute issue of Now magazine on sale within days.<br /><br />And some brands that started off as online-only products have become so successful that they have spawned magazines of their own, such as Egmont’s children’s mag Bin Weevils.<br /><br />As part of our magazines special, PrintWeek spoke to two very different publishers to get their views on current and future print requirements.<br /><br />What about prices?<br />Prices are going up and we must look at our costs. If paper and print suppliers want to increase prices, fine. But if they do, we must negate that increase by reducing pagination, or copies, or switching from perfect-bound to stitched, or by changing paper grade.<br /><br />Do you think some titles will switch from print to online products?<br />Yes. We’ve got at least a couple of titles that could go digital.<br /><br />How can print be more attractive?<br />We must improve binding to speed up time to reader and we have got to be innovative about using things like personalisation.<br /><br />The biggest thing is to realise that the magazine is not the kingpin anymore. We used to have a magazine, a conference, an awards and all sorts of other brand extensions, all with the magazine at the centre. Now they can all be independent of the magazine.

We think it’s an industry defining event and it’s really going to shape how creativity comes to life for years to come.&quot;<br /><br />Members will be able to choose from an annual contract costing £38.11 (ex VAT) a month or a monthly membership costing £57.17, while users of CS3 or later will be eligible for an introductory offer of £22.23 a month.<br /><br />&quot;Unlike desktop software it’s going to be expanding constantly,&quot; added McCashey. &quot;It will grow as we add new products, new services, new features and we overcome new workflow challenges that our customers face.<br /><br />&quot; They’re always going to have the most up to date technology and they get updates and new products the instant they’re made available from Adobe and they’re all included in this low monthly price – we won’t be coming back and asking for upgrade fee because provided the customer’s a member they will have access as soon as the product becomes available.&quot;<br /><br />The subscription will give users access to all 14 Creative Suite applications to download and install, as well as Adobe's new HTML5 design and development products Muse and Edge preview.<br /><br />Creative Cloud will also includes access to Adobe's tablet applications, such as Photoshop Touch and Adobe Ideas, and will enable members to sync, share and store files across their desktop and mobile devices.<br /><br />&quot;Our creative customers not only want to create content and deliver content to an iPad or Android device - they want to create on it as well,&quot; said McCashey. &quot;Our touch apps allow them to create anywhere and then sync with their desktop computer using Creative Cloud.&quot;<br /><br />McCashey added that a &quot;roadmap&quot; of future additions to Creative Cloud was already in place, with new software launches penned in as well as all future point releases of Creative Suite.<br /><br />&quot;Once it’s launched we’re going to continue to add value in terms of new products, like Lightroom, Digital Publishing Suite single, and the full release of Edge, as well as features like Creative Cloud Team, which is aimed at workgroups,&quot; he said.<br /><br />&quot;Members will get access to all of that long before they’re added into the boxed products. We’re going to be offering continuous value in a way that would be impossible to do with traditional software delivery methods.<br /><br />&quot;At the moment customers would have to wait up to two years between major releases and there is functionality that we would like to introduce to customers sooner than that and Creative Cloud will make that possible.&quot;<br /><br />Source: Print Week UK<br /><br />[url=]A creative approach to inline manufacturing has given this mailing house an edge[/url]

So says a recent Mail Media Centre report, which found that in 2010 an average of 91% of direct mail was opened, that 48% of customers felt information received by direct mail was easy to understand compared with 20% by email, and that the percentage of mail where customers took action increased from just 4% in 2004 to 5% in 2010.<br /><br />Outdoor advertising is delivering similarly impressive results, with a Kinetic Worldwide survey finding that 75% of store owners say posters outside their shops are the main influence on what sells, and Outdoor Media Centre reporting that, although outdoor digital accounts for 14% of their revenue, six out of seven pounds are still being spent on printed posters.<br /><br />Still need convincing? Then take a look at PrintWeek’s pick of some of the most successful printed campaigns of late...<br /><br />The campaign<br />Out-of-home (OOH) marketing has long been a key aspect of H&amp;M’s promotional strategy. Working with Clear Channel to deliver wide-format posters, H&amp;M’s outdoor presence is increasing year-on-year with OOH now by far the principal medium for any campaign, accounting for 62% of the brand’s entire media investment (up from 16% in 2006).<br /><br />The reason behind this emphasis is that H&amp;M has discovered that it is not just a certain sector of the population buying its clothes. Many women now buy H&amp;M clothes and accessorise with more expensive items, so a form of marketing that broadcasts to the public as a whole, and not just young girls, has proved a worthwhile strategy.<br /><br />Why print?<br />Print will be the medium of choice for the majority of OOH campaigns for a long time, says Darren Mckay, Clear Channel international sales director, UK, because technological developments in HD presses mean that the quality is always improving. This is particularly advantageous where fashion OOH is concerned, Mckay reveals, with high definition print complementing H&amp;M’s simple and striking images. <br /><br />&quot;I think there’s something quite sexy about the poster and I think that’s why fashion has bought into it over many years,&quot; he says. &quot;There are more large digital canvases coming out, but the quality of them isn’t as good as you get on the smaller format. There’s a also a cost issue with digital screens.&quot;<br /><br />Print is important throughout H&amp;M’s marketing strategy, he adds. The brand appears in the right magazines, attracting people in the first place, and the posters act as reminders to people as they are out and about shopping.<br /><br />The result<br />Through consistent growth in outdoor advertising, H&amp;M now runs a live campaign for 22 weeks of every year (versus six in 2006). The result of H&amp;M having visibility on almost every high street in the UK is a brand awareness of 98%, a 700% shift in 16-30s agreeing that H&amp;M would be their first choice, and a 15% increase in global sales in 2010.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL21vcmdhbmRlbGVvbjI2LnBvc3Rlcm91cy5jb20vZXhwZXJ0cy13cml0aW5nLXRoZS1ib29rLW9uLXByb2R1Y3Rpb24tdGhyZWU_" target="_blank">Experts writing the book on production: three publishing figures</a>

However, the Colour Bridge supplements for coated and uncoated papers will not be available until June.<br />Source: Print Week UK<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2FsYmVydG9idXNjaDMxNi5wb3N0ZXJvdXMuY29tL2EtY3JlYXRpdmUtYXBwcm9hY2gtdG8taW5saW5lLW1hbnVmYWN0dXJpbmctaA__" target="_blank">A creative approach to inline manufacturing has given this mailing house an edge</a>

Everyone wants something different from the paper merchants, and for every Anthony Thirlby, there is a Richard Owers, director at UK commercial printer Pureprint.<br /><br />&quot;For the vast majority of our work, having a choice of papers at our disposal is incredibly important,&quot; he explains. &quot;We use a wide range in both digital and litho. In creative print, the choice of substrate is a key factor.&quot;<br /><br />For Owers, the current level of choice is important for the way his business works. And while the merchants accept the choice is wide, paper manufacturer Arjowiggins corporate affairs manager Shannan Hodgson says that with the mix of technologies and processes these days, having a breadth of choice is essential.<br /><br />&quot;It’s important to offer variety in papers to allow companies the widest possible range to choose from,&quot; she explains. &quot;With so many different shades, thicknesses and types, end-users are – with the help of a printer – able to pick exactly the right paper for their specific print job.&quot;<br /><br />For the merchants, the solution to any confusion the printers or end-clients may have with the choice of paper is not restriction, but improving the information channels. Hodgson says Arjowiggins uses extensive marketing to ensure printers are properly informed, while PaperCo head of marketing Charles Eaton adds that his company has worked hard at simplifying the buying process.<br /><br />The latter is much needed, argue printers, as the current supply chain doesn’t help itself in terms of clarity with the way certain products are branded – and this is contributing to there being too many products on the market. Often, you could have three different papers, branded and priced differently, that you know have come from the same mill and were produced in exactly the same way: they are essentially the same product.<br /><br />Antalis McNaughton marketing director James Jarvis, though, counters that, while this issue was once a problem, the market has become more consolidated over the past five years and so it happens less frequently. Robert Horne customer marketing manager Paul Cassidy adds that, firstly, this quirk of supply is not as widespread as people may think, and secondly that where it does occur, some printers actually see it as a benefit. If, for example, a printer’s usual supplier has no stock of a particular grade, he can go to another merchant and maintain continuity of supply – albeit under a different name.<br /><br />At the end of the day, the flexibility of print to give thousands of different feels and textures and products is at the heart of what makes it great. However, the substrate confusion that seems to be currently occurring in some print areas threatens to undermine that flexibility. To overcome that, some product consolidation is needed from the merchants, but also information channels need to be clearer and the information given more process focused. In combination, this should mean printers can still have their choice of substrates, but without the complexities and confusion.<br /><br />Source: Print Week UK<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL21vcmdhbmRlbGVvbjI2LnBvc3Rlcm91cy5jb20vY291bGQtcG9zdGFsLWRlcmVndWxhdGlvbi1icmluZy1hYm91dC1hLXR3by10" target="_blank">Could postal deregulation bring about a two-tier service?</a>

Carbon certifications are a newer area and represent more of a stand-out performance and, over the past two years, we’ve seen big companies starting to ask their suppliers for much more information about carbon.&quot;<br /><br />Another less-used way of standing out is EMAS (Eco-Manage-ment and Audit Scheme). This accreditation requires organisations regularly to produce a public environmental statement and so is seen by its advocates as the gold standard of transparency. <br /><br />Knowledge of EMAS and the Carbon Trust Standard is not as widespread as the ISO 14001s of this world, however, so despite some arguing the former to be more rigorous, their kerb appeal for print buyers is perhaps less than the latter. That said, Richard Owers, company director at Pureprint, the company with the longest-held EMAS certification in the UK, says that official accreditations like EMAS certainly have a role to play in helping printers to secure business. <br /><br />&quot;EMAS is important to us because it is indicative of the whole culture at Pureprint,&quot; he says. &quot;When a customer comes to visit, there’s a whole ethos going on which I think is what gives us the edge if a print buyer is comparing us with another company.&quot;<br /><br />It’s this process of inviting the buyers into the company and really explaining the eco performance of the business that many see as the way forward through the blinding accreditation maelstrom. If the buyers are pre-occupied unfairly with a couple of the easy-to-understand labels, then it is the job of the printer to educate them otherwise, to explain why their in-house scheme is better than an ISO, or why the Carbon Trust Standard means they are performing better than someone with a PEFC paper logo. <br /><br />&quot;Within this industry, there are professionals who deal in the environment such as myself and it’s our job to clarify things for people so they do ensure that they’re making an informed choice,&quot; says Head. <br /><br />The trouble is that an &quot;informed choice&quot; is a malleable concept and so benchmarking accreditations in a hierarchical list is nigh on impossible – priorities will shift with the type of work and the context of that work. This makes the current penchant for prioritising ISO 14001, FSC and PEFC all the more frustrating for printers, of course, but, as buyers are pushed for time and under pressure to hit targets, the trend is understandable. <br /><br />It’s up to printers to educate those buyers if they feel other environmental stories need to be told.   <br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3BhdHJpa2tlbm5lZDI0LnBvc3Rlcm91cy5jb20va29uaWNhLXBsb3RzLWFuLWlua2pldC1yZXZvbHV0aW9u" target="_blank">Konica plots an inkjet revolution</a>

The gold stamp was then embossed to create a &quot;seal of approval&quot; effect using a Sanwa machine. Finally, a Trumex screen printer applied the spot UV varnish.<br /><br />The original design saw solid black foil set in certain areas but Celloglas set up the SBL flatbed in its Reading plant to apply a lighter texture, creating grainy numerals with differing texture, which would become a feature of the final cover.<br /><br />Computer Arts designer Becca Allen said: &quot;We weren’t aware that we could have texture but Celloglas suggested it for the black foil pattern and we liked it. It was more raised against the white background, which had been a risk.&quot;<br /><br />Celloglas has been able to give more input to the design of the products through working directly with the art team, offering finishes the client had not considered.<br /><br />Computer Arts editor Rob Carney said: &quot;The Celloglas team was very helpful in helping us determine what we could do. The gold 'seal' idea came out of our original meeting with Celloglas. I'm particularly pleased with the black textured foil.<br /><br />&quot;I'm really pleased with the final cover – particularly the gold foil and embossing and we've had some great feedback from readers.&quot;<br /><br />Celloglas sales director Steve Middleton added: &quot;It was fantastic to work so closely with Computer Arts magazine on this cover, their creative ideas for finishes were really flowing<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3BhdHJpa2tlbm5lZDI0LnBvc3Rlcm91cy5jb20va29uaWNhLXBsb3RzLWFuLWlua2pldC1yZXZvbHV0aW9u" target="_blank">Konica plots an inkjet revolution</a>

However, disorientating though it may be, a wide choice of paper is, some say, essential to print’s very being, central to its success as a communications medium, and so rather than a need to restrict choice, the key going forward is more to manage that choice better.<br /><br />The problem with that is print’s diversity. Everyone wants something different from the paper merchants, and for every Anthony Thirlby, there is a Richard Owers, director at UK commercial printer Pureprint.<br /><br />&quot;For the vast majority of our work, having a choice of papers at our disposal is incredibly important,&quot; he explains. &quot;We use a wide range in both digital and litho. In creative print, the choice of substrate is a key factor.&quot;<br /><br />For Owers, the current level of choice is important for the way his business works. And while the merchants accept the choice is wide, paper manufacturer Arjowiggins corporate affairs manager Shannan Hodgson says that with the mix of technologies and processes these days, having a breadth of choice is essential.<br /><br />&quot;It’s important to offer variety in papers to allow companies the widest possible range to choose from,&quot; she explains. &quot;With so many different shades, thicknesses and types, end-users are – with the help of a printer – able to pick exactly the right paper for their specific print job.&quot;<br /><br />For the merchants, the solution to any confusion the printers or end-clients may have with the choice of paper is not restriction, but improving the information channels. Hodgson says Arjowiggins uses extensive marketing to ensure printers are properly informed, while PaperCo head of marketing Charles Eaton adds that his company has worked hard at simplifying the buying process.<br /><br />The latter is much needed, argue printers, as the current supply chain doesn’t help itself in terms of clarity with the way certain products are branded – and this is contributing to there being too many products on the market. Often, you could have three different papers, branded and priced differently, that you know have come from the same mill and were produced in exactly the same way: they are essentially the same product.<br /><br />Antalis McNaughton marketing director James Jarvis, though, counters that, while this issue was once a problem, the market has become more consolidated over the past five years and so it happens less frequently. Robert Horne customer marketing manager Paul Cassidy adds that, firstly, this quirk of supply is not as widespread as people may think, and secondly that where it does occur, some printers actually see it as a benefit. In combination, this should mean printers can still have their choice of substrates, but without the complexities and confusion.<br /><br />Source: Print Week UK<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWdlbnRlLmNvbS95b3VyX3BhZ2UvYmxvZy92aWV3X3Bvc3RpbmcuaHRtbD9waWQ9Mjc2MTU1NCZhbXA7cHJvZmlsZV9pZD03Mjg2NzY1JmFtcDtwcm9maWxlX25hbWU9bW9yZ2FuZGVsZW9uMjYmYW1wO3VzZXJfaWQ9NzI4Njc2NSZhbXA7dXNlcm5hbWU9bW9yZ2FuZGVsZW9uMjY_" target="_blank">Could postal deregulation bring about a two-tier service?</a>

Tangent, a print and marketing group comprised of a number of firms, including the Ravensworth digital print facility and online operator The Digital Print Partnership, has discovered that holding FSC accreditation is very much a pitch winner.<br /><br />Tangent group procurement manager Bernard O’Connor explains that new business is one of the major benefits of this recycling effort.<br /><br />&quot;While our original goal was to reduce the quantity of waste that we were sending to landfill, we have started to promote our recycling initiatives to customers,&quot; says O’Connor. &quot;One of our biggest clients gave us even more business after they saw that we were FSC accredited.&quot;<br /><br />Tangent has also recently received a certificate from the World Land Trust showing that the company uses carbon-balanced paper, which has saved 62 tonnes of carbon dioxide since March. O’Connor says this is something that will give the company ammunition when competing for work, as clients can see that the company is going the extra mile – in a world where price is beaten down as far as possible, green credentials such as this can be a real point of difference and a chance for the client to boost its own eco credentials.<br /><br />To this end, O’Connor explains, it is crucial that printers also ensure their own suppliers are up to scratch environmentally.<br />&quot;When I appraise potential suppliers, their environmental characteristics are evaluated and form part of the selection process,&quot; he adds.<br /><br />Julian Long, national key account manager at paper manufacturer Arjowiggins Graphic also believes a green approach to business can only become more important in the struggle to secure new business.<br /><br />&quot;People are really getting back behind environmental issues and I believe that they will be looking for print suppliers who can prove that they are reducing their impact on the environment,&quot; he says.<br /><br />&quot;We’ll see more printers adopt more sustainable technologies, such as using waterless printing or opting for vegetable rather than oil-based inks; measures like these will be part of a bigger package of becoming greener.&quot;<br /><br />Arjowiggins Graphic has set up an environmental calculator to show clients the difference using recycled paper can make in terms of the amount of water, energy and wood used, as well as the amount of CO2 produced.<br /><br />What next?<br />But going green doesn’t stop with a couple of environmental accreditations and some recycled stock. If you’re really concerned to be seen as a sustainable operator, there are plenty of other things you can do. <br /><br />So, at a time when many businesses are struggling in a difficult economic climate, how many can afford to throw away what could be valuable waste? With many printers doing their best to cut costs, boost profits and win new business, examining what’s in the skip could be just the ticket.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWdlbnRlLmNvbS95b3VyX3BhZ2UvYmxvZy92aWV3X3Bvc3RpbmcuaHRtbD9waWQ9Mjc2NjAzMCZhbXA7cHJvZmlsZV9pZD03Mjg3MTI3JmFtcDtwcm9maWxlX25hbWU9cGF0cmlra2VubmVkMjQmYW1wO3VzZXJfaWQ9NzI4NzEyNyZhbXA7dXNlcm5hbWU9cGF0cmlra2VubmVkMjQ_" target="_blank">Banner picks up Carphone Warehouse contract off HH Global</a>

She says the reasons for this are based not necessarily on ignorance, but more on time pressures. <br /><br />&quot;In this market, customers, particularly the smaller ones, don’t have a lot of time to build up a detailed knowledge of the environment, so they are reliant on certain certificates,&quot; explains Branch. &quot;For the customer, it needs to be simple.&quot;<br /><br />It is not surprising, then, that those credentials that can be expressed in the form of an official stamp of independent approval, rather than uncorroborated claims, are frequently cited as most desirable by print buyers. Not that the official stamps narrow the eco field of appraisal too far – there is still a wide comparison of accreditations, certificates and stamps to be made. <br /><br />At least unofficially, among the well known-names of FSC, PEFC, EMAS and countless others, print buyers do tend to place a higher regard on ISO 14001, an internationally recognised system monitoring the environmental targets companies set themselves and how they achieve and improve upon them. <br /><br />This certification is seen as a must-have for many print buyers, Parker says, and it is certainly no secret that the UK’s biggest print buyers need this in place before the sales process even begins.  <br /><br />The number of printers pursuing and gaining the accreditation suggests that they have recognised the power the ISO holds in print buyers’ eyes. But Chris Head, health, safety and environmental manager at Howitt, says the badge is more than attractive clothing to entice a buyer. Rather it has tangible benefits to the company as well, being a valuable tool to ensure that businesses achieve a high environmental performance. <br /><br />&quot;We look at it more from a point of view of what ISO 14001 can do for us,&quot; he says. &quot;If you have good benchmarking and good objectives and targets it can actually deliver quite a good saving for the company. <br /><br />For instance, waste on this particular site in 2005 was more than 500 tonnes to landfill; last year it was less than 25 tonnes. So the management of those parts of the business is extremely important and can produce a saving.&quot;<br /><br />Head does concede, however, that, for smaller businesses, the costs of achieving ISO 14001 recognition could be prohibitive. Expenditures to be taken into account are the twice-yearly audits, costing around a £1,000 each, and of course the salaries of workers like Head who ensure the systems are implemented. For print buyers to give precedence to an ISO seems an unfair bias, then, against smaller operations. <br /><br />That said, there are cheaper ways of implementing the ISO 14001 than the most widely respected UKAS accredited scheme. These include self-accreditation, and certification from a range of different bodies including Lloyds, BSI and AJA, all of whom might appeal to a company’s individual needs. Printers can also enter into a BSA 555 or Acorn Project scheme, designed to help them on their way to an ISO 14001. But this might not get them very far with buyers who see a UKAS verified ISO 14001 as a must.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWdlbnRlLmNvbS95b3VyX3BhZ2UvYmxvZy92aWV3X3Bvc3RpbmcuaHRtbD9waWQ9Mjc2NjAzMCZhbXA7cHJvZmlsZV9pZD03Mjg3MTI3JmFtcDtwcm9maWxlX25hbWU9cGF0cmlra2VubmVkMjQmYW1wO3VzZXJfaWQ9NzI4NzEyNyZhbXA7dXNlcm5hbWU9cGF0cmlra2VubmVkMjQ_" target="_blank">Banner picks up Carphone Warehouse contract off HH Global</a>
