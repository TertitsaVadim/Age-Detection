<br /><br />1. There are at least two people in this world that you would die for.
<br />2. At least 15 people in this world love you in some way.
<br />3. The only reason anyone would ever hate you is because they want to be just like you.
<br />4. A smile from you can bring happiness to anyone, even if they don't like you.
<br />5. Every night, SOMEONE thinks about you before they go to sleep.
<br />6. You mean the world to someone.
<br />7. You are special and unique.
<br />8. Someone that you don't even know exists loves you.
<br />9. When you make the biggest mistake ever, something good comes from it.
<br />10. When you think the world has turned its back on you take another look.
<br />11. Always remember the compliments you received. Forget about the rude remarks.
<br /><br />So..........If you are a loving friend, send this to everyone, including the one that sent it to you. If you get it back, then they really do love you.
<br /><br />And always remember....when life hands you Lemons, ask for tequila and salt, and call me over!
<br /><br />Good friends are like stars.......You don't always see them, but you know they are always there.
<br /><br />'Whenever God Closes One Door He Always Opens Another, Even Though Sometimes It's Hell in the Hallway'
<br /><br />I would rather have one rose and a kind word from a friend while I'm here than a whole truck load when I'm gone.
<br /><br />RETURN TO SENDER
<br />Forward to all your friends, including me. ! And don't tell me you're
<br />too busy for this. Don't you know the phrase 'stop and smell the flowers'? See how many 'bouquets' you end up with!

<br />He told me he doesnt love me as much as i want him to love me. Should i realy care abt that ?? i mean its better than being in a relationship and not being loved at all. He also said he doesnt see us getting married / have kids. He doesnt know what he want!! 
<br />what should i do?? i love him too much to leave him his ma 4 and i cant stand another heart break. last one ws so bad i considered killing myself. I know i know its not worth taking your life but when it hurts  u just dnt think about those things.
<br /><br />He loves me but ya i know i dnt really want to hear &quot;leave him honey there are plenty in the sea!!&quot; speech but how do u let go of something u learnt to love with all your heart?
<br /><br />Help ay advice will be appreciated.
<br />love nikita and ty for taking time in reading this

I have started looking for new jobs i really want to go to australia. about my boyfriend well i have also decided i am going to think positive and try to work it out. He will either learn to love me or we will just be together.
<br />Work wise i am being trained in another dept. so thats a good thing. I am happy at the moment. I noticed if i start thinking about relationships and babys it just makes me unhappy and causes problems. If a guy is not ready his not ready you can never rush babys either way.
<br /><br />i would like to thank every one who gave me advice i really appreciate it.from now on i will do my best to think positive and move forward.
<br /><br />Have a lovely day /weekend.

<br />well i am good ty just busy with wow and stuff. Wwelll...... i got my blankey hehe  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/w00t.gif" alt=":)" /> and my heater at home 
<br />just need my computer and wow and i am all warm and fussy. Being stressed out alot lately and its nothing to do with bf 
<br />its my friends. 
<br /><br />ok hea is the story
<br />This guy used to stalk me so ya .. it ws a good thing thou. we did end up just seeing each for a bit. but than we couldnt stand each other we gt very argumentive. After a while i moved so i lost connect with him for 5 years 
<br />now after five years his back and his with a girl. who has a baby girl. 
<br />ok hea it gets interesting .. he asked me to be his friend and blah blah... well i tried to be his friend but its impossible. he said his changed but id nt think so.
<br />He called me at 11pm 2 nites ago.. saying he ws having domestics when he asked to help him 
<br />his gf's father ws causing shit abt him and his daughter being together .. and the gf is aggresive. He told me while he ws talking to me that he ws in the car cold so i told him to go get something warm. and he went mental at me.. thats the best advice u can give me. 
<br />i mean .. he ws complain abt being in the cold andin the car. than i told him to go a nd have a talk try to explain it to her .. he went nuts again ...
<br />now to me thats ws it .. i mean if u want advice u either take it or leave it ..but u dnt sit there and insult me ..and call me idiot or that i am not being a friend.. ffs i picked up my phone when i ws asleep .. what else do u want  me to do .. drive for 8hours just to get to u ..
<br /><br />now tell me what should i have done. this what i did i told him again... to go talk to her or stay in the car and freeze but he has to sort it out. other wise there is another option to leave her if he cant deal / handle it.and hung up
<br /><br />should i have told him that every thing will be alright or what ..its so frustrating i have my own shit and prob
