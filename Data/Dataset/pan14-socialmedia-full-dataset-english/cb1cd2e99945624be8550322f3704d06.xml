<br />An earlier discussion had led to an argument and neither of them wanted to concede their position. As they passed a barnyard of mules, jack asses, and pigs, the husband asked sarcastically
<br />&quot;Relatives of yours?&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;Yep,&quot; the wife replied
<br /><br />&quot;in-laws.&quot;

<br />If Laurie, Linda, Elizabeth and Barbara go out for lunch, they will call each other Laurie, Linda, Elizabeth and Barbara. If Mark, Chris, Eric and Tom go out, they will affectionately refer to each other as Fat Boy, Godzilla, Peanut-Head and Scrappy.
<br /><br />EATING OUT
<br />When the bill arrives, Mark, Chris, Eric and Tom will each throw in a £20, even though it's only for £32.50. None of them will have anything smaller and none will actually admit they want change back. When the women get their bill, out come the pocket calculators. 
<br /><br />MONEY
<br />A man will pay £2 for a £1 item he needs. A woman will pay £1 for a £2 item that she doesn't need, but it's on sale.
<br /><br />BATHROOMS
<br />A man has five items in his bathroom: a toothbrush, shaving cream, razor, a bar of soap, and a towel from the Holiday Inn. The average number of items in the typical woman's bathroom is 337. A man would not be able to identify most of these items
<br /><br />ARGUMENTS
<br />A woman has the last word in any argument. Anything a man says after that is the beginning of a new argument.
<br /><br />CATS
<br />Women love cats. Men say they love cats, but when women aren't looking, men kick cats. 
<br /><br />FUTURE
<br />A woman worries about the future until she gets a husband. A man never worries about the future until he gets a wife.
<br /><br />SUCCESS
<br />A successful man is one who makes more money than his wife can spend. A successful woman is one who can find such a man.
<br /><br />MARRIAGE 
<br />A woman marries a man expecting he will change, but he doesn't. A man marries a woman expecting that she won't change ,and she does.
<br /><br />DRESSING UP
<br />A woman will dress up to go shopping, water the plants, empty the rubbish bin, answer the phone, read a book, and get the mail. A man will dress up for weddings and funerals.
<br /><br />NATURAL
<br />Men wake up as good-looking as they went to bed. Women somehow deteriorate during the night.
<br /><br />OFFSPRING
<br />Ah, children. A woman knows all about her children. She knows about dentist appointments and romances, best friends, favorite foods, secret fears and hopes and dreams. A man is vaguely aware of some short people living in the house
<br /><br />THOUGHT FOR THE DAY
<br />Any married man should forget his mistakes.   There's no use in two people remembering the same thing.

He wanted to plant his potatoes, but it was very hard work and he had no modern equipment. His only son who used to help him was in prison for murder. The old man wrote a letter to his son and described his predicament.
<br /><br />Dear Son
<br />I am feeling pretty bad because it looks like I won't be able to plant my potatoes this year,i wont be able to dig the field up. I am getting too old to be doing this by myself. If you were here all my troubles would be over.
<br />                                                                                                                                                                              Love 
<br />                                                                                             Dad
<br /><br />A few days later he received a letter from his son.
<br /><br />Dear Dad
<br /> For Heavens sake don't dig up the field. That is where I buried all the bodies
<br /><br />Love
<br />                                                                                            your son
<br /><br />At 4 am the next morning Garda Síochána forensic teams and other local police showed up and dug up the entire field without finding any bodies.
<br />They apologized to the old man and left
<br />That same day the old man received another letter from his son.
<br /><br />Dear Dad
<br />You can go ahead and plant your potatoes now.

<br />Your reward is you can hang out with anyone in Heaven.
<br />Arthur thinks for a minute and says I want to hang out with God.
<br />St Peter takes Arthur to meet God. 
<br />God recognizes Arthur and says &quot;ok so you are  the man who invented the motorcycle&quot;.
<br />Arthur says yep thats me.
<br />God says whats the big deal in inventing something that is pretty unstable, makes noise and pollution and can't run without a road?
<br />Arthur is apparently embarrassed but finally says, &quot;Excuse me but aren't you the inventor of the woman?
<br />yes says God 
<br />Well says Arthur professional to professional you have some major design flaws in your invention.
<br />1.     Too much inconsistency in the front end protrusions
<br />2.     It chatters constantly at high speeds.
<br />3.     Most of the rear ends are too soft and wobble too much.
<br />4.     The intake is placed way too close to the exhaust.
<br />5.     And maintenance costs are enormous
<br /><br />Hmmmmmmmm you have some good points there replies God but hold on.
<br />God goes to His celestial super computer types in a few words and waits for the results. The computer prints out a slip of paper and God reads it,then turns to Artur and says
<br /><br />Well it may be true that my invention is flawed but according to these numbers more men are riding my invention that yours!!!

<br /><br />He was his reply
<br /><br />It started when I got married and I guess I never should of done it, I got hitched to a widow with a grown daughter who then became my step-daughter.
<br /><br />My daddy came to visit and  fell in love with my lovely step-daughter, then maried her. and so now my step-daughter was now my step-mother
<br /><br />Soon my wife had a son who was of course my daddy's brother-in-law since he is the half brother of my step-daughter who is now of course my daddy's wife.
<br />So as I told you when my step-daughter married my daddy she was my step-mother. Now since my new son is brother to my step-mother he also became my uncle.
<br /><br />As you know my wife is my step-grandmother, she is my step-mothers mother. (Don't forget my step-mother is my step-daughter) Remember to I am my wifes grandson. 
<br />But hold on just a few minutes more. You see since I am married to  my step-grandmother I am not only my wifes grandson and her hubby  but I am also my own grandfather
<br /><br />Now you can understand how I got put in this place.
