Even if you find yourself out of the coverage area of your mobile network and you dial 112, the mobile will search any existing networks to establish the emergency number for you. Interestingly, this number can be dialed even if the keypad is locked.
<br />2. Lock Your Keys in the Car? - If your car has a remote lock/unlock device (and you have a second one, say at home - aside from the one on your keychain that's locked inside the car) you can call someone at home on their cell phone from your cell phone, hold your phone about a foot from your car door, and have the person at home press the unlock button on the device, holding it near the mobile phone on their end. Your car will unlock. Distance is no object. You could be hundreds of miles away, and if you can reach someone who has the other remote for your car, you can unlock the doors.
<br />3. Secret Battery Power - Imagine your cell battery is very low, you are expecting an important call, and you don't have a charger. Nokia phones come with a reserve battery. To activate it, press the keys *3370#. Your cell will restart with this reserve, and show a 50% increase in battery. This reserve will get charged when you charge your cell next time.
<br />4. Disabling a Stolen Phone - To check your mobile phone's serial number, key in the following digits on your phone: * # 0 6 #. A 15-digit serial code will appear on the screen. Write it down and keep it somewhere safe. If your phone gets stolen, you can phone your service provider and give them this code. They will then be able to block your handset so even if the thief changes the SIM card, your phone will be totally useless.

<br /><br />Then he saw an envelope propped up prominently on the centre of the pillow. It was addressed &quot;Dad&quot;. With the worst premonition, he opened the envelope and read the letter with trembling hands:-
<br /><br />Dear Dad,
<br /><br />It is with great regret and sorrow that I'm writing you, but I'm leaving home. I had to elope with my new boyfriend Randy because I wanted to avoid a scene with Mom and you.
<br /><br />I've been finding real passion with Randy and he is so nice to me. I know when you meet him you'll like him too - even with all his piercing, tattoos, and motorcycle clothes. But it's not only the passion Dad, I'm pregnant and Randy said that he wants me to have the kid and that we can be very happy together.
<br /><br />Even though Randy is much older than me (anyway, 42 isn't so old these days is it? ), and has no money, really these things shouldn't stand in the way of our relationship, don't you agree?
<br /><br />Randy has a great CD collection; he already owns a trailer in the woods and has a stack of firewood for the whole winter. It's true he has other girlfriends as well but I know he'll be faithful to me in his own way. He wants to have many more children with me and that's now one of my dreams too.
<br /><br />Randy taught me that marijuana doesn't really hurt anyone and he'll be growing it for us and we'll trade it with our friends for all the cocaine and ecstasy we want. In the meantime, we'll pray that science will find a cure for AIDS so Randy can get better; he sure deserves it!!
<br /><br />Don't worry Dad, I'm 15 years old now and I know how to take care of myself. Someday I'm sure we'll be back to visit so you can get to know your grandchildren.
<br /><br />Your loving daughter,
<br />Rosie.
<br /><br />At the bottom of the page were the letters &quot; PTO&quot;.
<br /><br />Hands still trembling, her father turned the sheet, and read:
<br /><br />PS:
<br /><br />Dad, none of the above is true. I'm over at the neighbour's house. I just wanted to remind you that there are worse things in life than my report card that's in my desk centre drawer. Please sign it and call when it is safe for me to come home.
<br /><br />I love you!
<br /><br />Your loving daughter,
<br />Rosie

<br /><br />A farmer had the misfortune Of owing a large sum of money to a village moneylender.
<br /><br />The Moneylender , who was old and ugly, fancied the farmer's beautiful Daughter. So he proposed a bargain.
<br /><br />He said he would forgo the farmer's debt if he could marry his Daughter. Both the farmer and his daughter were horrified by the Proposal.
<br /><br />So the cunning money-lender suggested that they let Providence decide the matter.
<br /><br />He told them that he would put a black Pebble and a white pebble into an empty money bag. Then the girl would Have to pick one pebble from the bag.
<br /><br />1) If she picked the black pebble, she would become his wife and her father's debt would be forgiven.
<br /><br />2) If she picked the white pebble she need not marry him and her father's debt would still be forgiven.
<br /><br />3) But if she refused to pick a pebble, her father would be thrown into Jail.
<br /><br />They were standing on a pebble strewn path in the farmer's field. As They talked, the moneylender bent over to pick up two pebbles. As he Picked them up, the sharp-eyed girl noticed that he had picked up two Black pebbles and put  them into the bag.
<br /><br />He then asked the girl to pick A pebble from the bag.
<br /><br />Now, imagine that you were standing in the field. What would you have Done if you were the girl? If you had to advise her, what would you Have told her?
<br /><br />Careful analysis would produce three possibilities:
<br /><br />1. The girl should refuse to take a pebble.
<br /><br />2. The girl should show that there were two black pebbles in the bag And expose the money-lender as a cheat.
<br /><br />3. The girl should pick a black pebble and sacrifice herself in order To save her father from his debt and imprisonment.
<br /><br />Take a moment to ponder over the story. The above story is used with The hope that it will make us appreciate the difference between lateral And logical thinking.
<br /><br />The girl's dilemma cannot be solved with Traditional logical thinking. Think of the consequences if she chooses
<br /><br />The above logical answers.
<br /><br />What would you recommend to the Girl to do?
<br /><br />Well, here is what she did ....
<br /><br />The girl put her hand into the moneybag and drew out a pebble. Without Looking at it, she fumbled and let it fall onto the pebble-strewn path Where it immediately became lost among all the other pebbles.
<br /><br />&quot;Oh, how clumsy of me,&quot; she said. &quot;But never mind, if you look into the Bag for the one that is left, you will be able to tell which pebble I Picked.&quot;
<br /><br />Since the remaining pebble is black, it must be assumed that she had Picked the white one. And since the money-lender dared not admit his Dishonesty, the girl changed what seemed an impossible situation into An extremely advantageous one.
<br /><br />MORAL OF THE STORY:
<br /><br />Most complex problems do have a solution. It is only that we don't Attempt to think.

<br /><br />He looked through the doorway with his ears lifted high and his tail wagging as fast as it could. To his great surprise, he found himself staring at 1000 other happy little dogs with their tails wagging just as fast as his. He smiled a great smile, and was answered with 1000 great smiles just as warm and friendly. As he left the House, he thought to himself, &quot; This is a wonderful place. I will come back and visit it often.&quot;

<br /><br />Very Simple but awesome!
<br /><br />A man went to a barbershop to have his hair cut and his beard trimmed.
<br />As the barber began to work, they began to have a good conversation.
<br />They talked about so many things and various subjects.
<br /><br />When they eventually touched on the subject of God, the barber said: &quot;I
<br />don't believe that God exists.&quot; &quot;Why do you say that?&quot; asked the
<br />customer. &quot;Well, you just have to go out in the street to realize that
<br />God doesn't exist. Tell me, if God exists, would there be so many sick
<br />people? Would there be abandoned children? If God existed, there would
<br />be neither suffering nor pain. I can't imagine a loving a God who would
<br />allow all of these things.&quot;
<br /><br />The customer thought for a moment, but didn't respond because he didn't
<br />want to start an argument.
<br /><br />The barber finished his job and the customer left the shop. Just after
<br />he left the barbershop, he saw a man in the street with long, stringy,
<br />dirty hair and an untrimmed beard. He looked dirty and unkempt.
<br /><br />The customer turned back and entered the barber shop again and he said
<br />to the barber: &quot;You know! what? Barbers do not exist.&quot; &quot;How can you say
<br />that?&quot; asked the surprised barber. &quot;I am here, and I am a barber. And I
<br />just worked on you!&quot; &quot;No!&quot; the customer exclaimed. &quot;Barbers don't exist
<br />because if they did, there would be no people with dirty long hair and
<br />untrimmed beards, like that man outside.&quot; &quot;Ah, but barbers DO exist! &quot;
<br />answered the barber. &quot;What happens, is, people do not come to me. &quot;
<br /><br />&quot;Exactly!&quot;- affirmed the customer. &quot;That's the point! God, too, DOES
<br />Exist! What happens, is, people don't go to Him and do not look for Him.
<br />That's why there's so much pain and suffering in the world.&quot;

<br />Very important - NEVERLIGHT CANDLE in A/C ROOM.
<br /><br />Prevention is Better than cure.. Please read this and pass on...
<br /><br />NEVER LIGHT CANDLE in A.C. ROOM.
<br /><br />A friend in our group passed away last week due to carbon-monoxidepoisoning. It happenedwhen she lighted an aroma theraputic candle for the night in a room withair-conditioner ON.
<br /><br />Due to lack of oxygen in the room, the burning of the candle cannot fullyoxidize &amp; thus forms dangerous carbon monoxide.
<br /><br />Carbon monoxide will prevent oxygen exchange in the lungs, resulting inthe person dozing offto a state of unconsciousness &amp; eventually deathin less than an hour, depending on the room size.
<br /><br />This email is to make you aware of such danger when lighting aroma theraputiccandles in any unventilated rooms.
<br /><br />Please forward this e-mail to all your loved ones and friends

<br /><br />She puts on her robe and goes downstairs to look for him. She finds him sitting at the kitchen table with a cup of coffee in front him. He appears deep in thought, just staring at the wall. She watches as he wipes a tear from his eye and takes a sip of coffee.
<br /><br />&quot;What's the matter, dear?&quot; she whispers as she steps into the room. &quot;Why are you down here at this time of night?&quot;
<br /><br />The husband looks up, &quot;Do you remember 20 years ago when we were dating, and
<br />you were only 17?&quot; he asks solemnly.
<br /><br />The wife is touched thinking her husband is so caring and sensitive. &quot;Yes, I do,&quot; she replies.
<br /><br />The husband pauses. The words are not coming easily. &quot;Do you remember when
<br />you father caught us in the back seat of my car?&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;Yes, I remember,&quot; says the wife, lowering herself into a chair beside him.
<br /><br />The husband continues...&quot;Do you remember when he shoved a shotgun in my face and said, &quot;Either you marry my daughter, or I will send you to jail for 20 years&quot;.
<br />&quot;I remember that too&quot;, she replies softly.
<br /><br />He wipes another tear from his cheek and says... &quot;I would have gotten out today!&quot;

<br />Girls are special ones
<br />created by God......
<br />If you praise her,
<br />she thinks you are lying.
<br />If you dont, you are good for
<br />nothing..If she talks,she wants you
<br />to listen. If you listen,she wants
<br />you to talk.If you kiss her, you are not
<br />a gentleman. If you dont,you are not
<br />a man. If you agree to all her likes,
<br />you are a wimp.If you dont,you are
<br />not understanding........So simple
<br />yet so complex, so wierd, yet so beautiful..
<br />Thats a girl.........
