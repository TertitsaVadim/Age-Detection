<br />anywho...
<br /><br />I feel like for the 1st time ever the love that i feel for a girl is true...
<br />not the false love where after the 1st day of going out you say to them &quot;i love you&quot;...
<br />ive been hanging out with her for close to a month, but we went out for a month at the start of the year aswell and had a harsh breakup (lots of swearing involved very MA15+ lol)...
<br />but she thinks we shouldnt go out because even tho she feels the same way she doesnt want the breakup part of the relationship...
<br />but now i think, if we sleep with someone else other then each other it would feel like cheating anyway, if we kissed another it would feel like kissing the end of our time together...
<br />It feels like we are going out anyway so i see no point in not going out...
<br />If only she knew how i felt really...
<br />How badly i want to be with her...
<br />Even if we do nothin sexual during our time together i wouldnt mind...
<br />just her touch, her smell, her beauty...
<br />it makes me so happy...
<br />Im writing this on pan.netbecause i dont want her to feel bad about not going out with me...
<br /><br />XoXo James
<br /><br />P.S. Nicole is my life

		<document id="cce35c8097a7d2aaef0464b7eec2ee0" url=""><![CDATA[My thoughts atm... Emos and Bi-Sexuals<br/><br/>My 1st little thingo i would like to write about is emos and why they arnt really what people think and to seperate the 2 types of emo...
<br /><br />Ok well emos where do i begin... i kno... THE ATTENTION SEEKERS!!! This is the worst type of emo in my oppinion... They always dress like a goth or a typical &quot;emo&quot; exept they act 10 times worse... they ALWAYS complain about EVERYTHING and cut just so people go &quot;ohh u shouldnt do that blah blah blah&quot; They act like they have no friends and they always try to act depressed... i personally hope all of the attention seeking emos go die in a hole somewhere...
<br /><br />Then you have the classic &quot;emo&quot;... i personally dont mind them (probally because im a lil bit like one) they are usually quite happy, have enough friends, wear what they like and dont care what people think, yes they are a little depressed sometimes but they also get angry fast and frusterated fast... JUST LIKE UR TYPICAL TEENAGER!! But yes they do cut/burn sometimes but in my next blog i will explain why some people cut...
<br /><br />The next subject on my mind is a smaller one but still its been bugging me... Why do people see something wrong with Bi-Sexuals... Yes we like same gender and opposite... SO WHAT!!! Who gives a shit we are still humans, we are still nice, we still have feelings... i can proudly say yes i have done sexual stuff with a guy and YES i enjoyed it...

<br /><br />The reason they do this is because most people get a buzz from it causing a slight euphoria which causes the pain to become non-existant giving them a &quot;release&quot; as most people will call it... Most people will start self-harm during a hard time during their life or to gain attention... Of course the euphoric state usually does not come about when someone isnt actually depressed or angry theirfore just leaving the attention seeker in pain...

		<document id="f9fea4fce47dde84d43d25d684a39718" url=""><![CDATA[James's Daily Blog (as i will call if from now on) - Music<br/><br/>Hey guys just a small blog today... Ive had my mind on music alot today so i think i will classify what i belive to be the steryotypical music types that certain groups of people will listen to...
<br /><br />&quot;Emos&quot;: Emos are generally belived to listen to depressing music all the time with lyrics such as &quot;oh i hate my life kill me now fuck the world!&quot;... This is not always true (although it is in some cases)... The &quot;emo&quot; culture is one i belong to and im proud of it... Most of the people in my group listen to a varity of music ranging from a soft melody from seethers softer songs all the way up to death metal such as raining blood by slayer... ALTHOUGH we pretty much despise R'n'B and black music (not trying to be racist sorry if i offend anyone)... but some &quot;emos&quot; do like it so yeah...
<br /><br />&quot;Freshys&quot;: Pretty much the complete opposite to &quot;emos&quot; they love there R'n'B and they love there black music... i really have nothing against their music i just dont really have the taste for it... they on the other hand seem to hate everything about our music and us... but thats the way life rolls...
<br /><br />&quot;METALHEADS!!&quot;: The most hardcore listeners of all the groups they love their metal... But only if its heavy...
<br /><br />Well thats pretty much the end because im too lazy to write more and i need to go call nicole <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />XoXo Love James

<br /><br />Nicole we went out once and it ended in anger and us not talking for a long time... But then a metal gig brought us back onto speaking terms and it felt like my heart had recived a jolt of electricity... my blood was pumping faster, my heart beating faster, my head was becoming clearer and best of all i felt happyer then i had in a long long time... I stopped many things when u asked me to go to that gig... I stopped doing drugs... I started acting like an actual human being and not some asshole... i stopped treating people like object that were in my way and more like people... 
<br /><br />Then we started to hang out more and more over the next couple of weeks... and we had a very interesting week together (lol nicole knows what i mean)... but then after another week or 2 i figured out that when i wasnt with her, i was thinking about her, when i was with her i was thinking of ways to suprise her and make her happyer... i was begining to fall in love... 
<br /><br />Now i dont use the word love at all really... but nicole is my 1 exeption... if i could choose one person in the world stay with for the rest of my life it would be her (even as corny as it sounds lol)...
<br /><br />I guess what im really trying to say with all of this is...
<br /><br />i love you nicole... and you make me want to become a better person and no matter what anyone says or thinks... you are THE MOST BEAUTIFUL girl in the world and i would give up anything just to keep yours and my love the same forever
<br /><br />XoXo Love James
<br /><br />P.S. i only cryed a little bit while writing this

Had a bad day...<br/><br/>Well as we all know i have started writing daily blogs as best i can (i may skip a day and shiz but anywho) in this blog its less of a subject and more of an update on whats goin on in my life...
<br /><br />Well today was good it started off normal just me and nicole meeting at the bus stop to go to school and she was cold so i let her wear my hoodie <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" /> and yeah all happy and stuff and went off to classes... but then after school she told me that she wanted to get a chocolate for this guy who hasnt spoken to her and hates her for a REALLY stupid reason (long story and its her life and i dont really wana tell her storys to people because its personal)... But she was to afraid to so we spoke to this guy chris who works with this guy (ryan) and chris told us one of nicoles friends had smashed ryan over the back of the head with a plank of wood the day before... so now nicole is afraid that ryan will blame it on her so she had this big emotional breakdown and wouldnt let me hug her to try cheer her up or anything and i was getting so cut... i kinda felt like i wanted to cry with her but i decided not to so i held back the tears so she didnt know i was hurt (because she hates knowing that shes making people feel bad) because i love her to much to let her know if it hurts... but yea that was pretty much my day because after that she went home and so did i and i havent spoken to her since <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/sad.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />May as well add my little subject...
<br /><br />To add onto one of my older blogs about emos... NOT ALL EMOS CUT!!! alot of people cut for different reasons and not only emos cut ok??? all cleared up?? good <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" />

<br />Translucent flesh and feeble bones
<br />The kind of temple where the whores and villains try to tempt the holistic tones
<br />Running rampant with free thought to free form, in the free in the clear
<br />And the matters at hand are shelled out like lint at a laundrymat to sift and focus
<br />On the bigger...better...now...
<br /><br />We all have a little sin that needs venting
<br />Virtues for the rending and laws and systems and stems that riff from the branches of office
<br />Do you know what your post entails? 
<br />Do you serve a purpose? or purposely serve? 
<br /><br />Wind down inside adivistic galore
<br />The value of a summer spent and a winter earned
<br /><br />For the rest of us there is always sunday
<br />The day of the week that reeks of rest but all we do is catch our breaths
<br />So we can wade naked into the bloody pool
<br />And place our hand on the big black book
<br />To watch the knives zig zag between our aching fingers
<br /><br />A vacation is a countdown
<br />T-minus your life and counting
<br />Time to drag your tongue across the sugarcube and hope you get a taste
<br /><br />What the fuck is all this for? 
<br />What the hells going on? 
<br />Shut up!
<br /><br />I could go on and on, but lets move on...shall we? 
<br /><br />Say, youre me and Im you and they all watch the things we do
<br />And like a smack of spite they threw me down the stairs
<br />Havent felt like this in years
<br />The great magnet of malicious magnanimous refuse
<br />Let me go and plundge me into the dead spot again
<br /><br />Thats where you go when theres no one else around
<br />Its just you, and there was never anyone to begin with, now was there? 
<br /><br />Sanctimonious pretentious dastardly bastards with there thumb on the pulse and a finger on the trigger
<br /><br />Classified my ass, thats a fucking secret and you know it
<br />Government is another way to say...better...than...you...
<br /><br />Its like ice but no pick, a murder charge that wont stick
<br />Its like a whole other world where you can smell the food but you cant touch the silverware...what luck
<br />Fascism you can vote for...isnt that sweet
<br /><br />And were all gonna die some day, cause thats the american way
<br />And Ive drunk to much and said to little
<br />When your gaffer taped in the middle, say a prayer, say a phrase, get yourself together and...
<br /><br />See whats happening
<br /><br />Shut up
<br />Fuck you, fuck you
<br /><br />Im sorry I could go on and on
<br />But its time to move on...so...
<br /><br />Remember..
<br />Youre a wreck
<br />An accident, forget the freak youre just nature
<br />Keep the gun oiled and the temple clean, shit snort and blaspheme
<br />Let the heads cool and the engine run
<br />Because in then end everything we do...
<br />Is just everything weve done&quot;
<br /><br />This is by stone sour... i take no credit for it... i just love it and i live my life by it

<br /><br />What is beauty? 	
<br /><br />It is a word that has been used for thousands of years to describe things from someones personality to the way that someone looks. The dictionary describes it as “a quality of a person, object, place, or idea that provides a perceptual experience of pleasure, affirmation, meaning, or goodness.” In fact the origin of beauty can be traced as far back into the days of early Greek philosophers such as Pythagoras who saw a connection between beauty and maths. Understanding beauty is also key element to understanding something known as aesthetics which is a concept created by a man called Robert Schumann who thought there were 2 types of beauty, natural and poetic. Schumann said that in things like music or art both poetic and natural art came out but that the natural art was more for sensual delight. Beauty can also be beautiful yet hugely dangerous or bad, take a glacier for example, it is one of the things many people want to see up close or even climb but even though it looks stable and beautiful every year many people die from either ice breaking off and crushing them or they just fall to their death. Also a dry rugged desert, people may find beauty in it but it can be extremely dangerous.
<br /><br />“Natural” beauty… some people think there is no such thing as natural beauty anymore, they think that the real natural beauty has been completely destroyed by ads on TV and models in magazines showing us a beauty that has been created by makeup artists and photo editing… some may think natural beauty is a label given to people to sell clothing, make-up, jewellery and other accessories to women and sometimes men. Why do they think like this you might wonder, it is because around the world there are people feeling horrible about the way they look because people define beauty as the perfect women (or in some cases man) when its really all fake. People with a flat stomach, flawless face, long silky hair, long legs, round bum and big boobs are usually just something created by digital editing and a fair bit of makeup. 
<br /><br />Human Beauty is another concept people will mention from time to time… human beauty basically means inner beauty, which is things like personality, intelligence, grace and elegance. Human beauty also includes outer beauty which is things like youth, health, symmetry, average-ness, and complexion. However, although youth and health may be included in beauty in some cases they do not apply, many people will say Mother Teresa was a beautiful person because she was beautiful on the inside.
<br />There are effects on society however for it can cause resent and envy for people who cannot pull off the stunt of looking beautiful while others can, and when others realise that they cannot match up to how these other people look they go to extreme measures such as, plastic surgery, eating disorders and liposuction… all of these things can dramatically harm a persons body and in some extreme cases end up in death. 	
<br /><br />There have also been studies on this subject to see how beauty affects in the workplace and in the real world. It has been found good looking students get better grades, attractive patients in a hospital will receive more personalised care from docters and nurses and people who look good generally earn more then someone with lesser looks.	
<br /><br />Here is a quote from an American newspaper about suicide due to people feeling bad about the way they look “Suicide among teens in the past 10 years has gone up from every one in twenty people committing suicide to every one in eight due to the images on our TV screens. Yes that’s right from the very images we see on TV… every day we see super models wearing tight revealing clothing, make-up so thick u don’t kno what they really look like and bodies so thin that they look anorexic… yet the media seem to think this is ok when really it is giving people a false vision on reality.”
<br /><br />These days it seems that beauty is all based on outer beauty… which is really sad because beauty should be all about the good things on the inside of people not what you can see on the outside. Beauty these days has been corrupted almost completely by the media to give us a false sense of what can really be accomplished and what is fake, there is no reason for people to be feeling bad about something that can and never will be accomplished without computers and lighting.
<br /><br />My final message is... no matter who you are or where you are from... you will have your own unique beauty... I dont find girls/guys who dress slutty/fresh very attractive and will refuse to even try to talk to them... where as girls/guys who dress &quot;Emo&quot; or &quot;Indie&quot; or just their own unique casual style are usually nicer and easyer to get along with... So please all you girls and guys out there who are just trying to fit in with a crowd... dont do it... if someone cant accept you for who you are then dont bother with them... its all about whats on the inside that counts...
<br /><br />Writen by James McManus for my year 10 English class... i added that final message for pan.netonly... copy this to your page if you want...

<br />and taken way to much to heart...
<br /><br />They used to be some of the most romantic words said in this world... back in the medieval days...
<br /><br />These days they are used for everything wether its... Telling someone that your friends with them... Tricking girls or even guys into letting you into their pants... Or just telling someone how you feel about them...
<br /><br />I personally hate those 3 words... and have only really said it when im high... or really actually do love someone...
<br /><br />I believe love should be shown in more then just words... it should be shown to your partner 24/7 through body language, gifts, the way u touch them (not just sexually people), the way u look at them, etc
<br /><br />I love you are 3 words i believe people should choke on and think about them before they say them
<br /><br />that is all

<br /><br />About 5 weeks ago i met a girl called Sami at a party... We had a good time and eventually did some stuff and blah blah blah good night <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" />... about a week later (3rd of july at 1 o'clock) i asked her out because my feelings for her had quickly become really great... we did so much stuff together... we went for breakfast a few times, went to the movies, i shouted her dinner at a really nice resteraunt, and we went to partys together... at about 2 weeks of going out we shared a bond that i have never felt with anyone in my life... and i kno even now that it was love... not that highschool love... actual love the kind that is hard to find... i didnt even really care whether we had sex or not... i just enjoyed her company and her love...
<br /><br />But on saturday (26th of july at about 3 in the morning)... she broke up with me... telling me that she thought she loved me to much for how long we had been going out... telling me it was more lust then love... that she wanted to concentrate on school rather then have a boyfriend... i was so cut... even now im still crying about it... she wont look me in the eye anymore... and she doesnt want to spend time with me anymore... i love her so much... and she doesnt feel the same way back... ive been so lonely since she broke up with me <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/sad.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />but still i will say whether she likes be back or not...
<br /><br />I Love You Samantha Somarriva and i always will :'(
