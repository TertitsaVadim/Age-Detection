<br /><br />How to save a life - The Fray
<br /><br />Step one you say we need to talk
<br />He walks you say sit down it's just a talk
<br />He smiles politely back at you
<br />You stare politely right on through
<br />Some sort of window to your right
<br />As he goes left and you stay right
<br />Between the lines of fear and blame
<br />You begin to wonder why you came
<br /><br />Where did I go wrong, I lost a friend
<br />Somewhere along in the bitterness
<br />And I would have stayed up with you all night
<br />Had I known how to save a life
<br /><br />Let him know that you know best
<br />Cause after all you do know best
<br />Try to slip past his defense
<br />Without granting innocence
<br />Lay down a list of what is wrong
<br />The things you've told him all along
<br />And pray to God he hears you
<br />And pray to God he hears you
<br /><br />Where did I go wrong, I lost a friend

<br />Somewhere along in the bitterness
<br />And I would have stayed up with you all night
<br />Had I known how to save a life
<br /><br />As he begins to raise his voice
<br />You lower yours and grant him one last choice
<br />Drive until you lose the road
<br />Or break with the ones you've followed
<br />He will do one of two things
<br />He will admit to everything
<br />Or he'll say he's just not the same
<br />And you'll begin to wonder why you came
<br /><br />Where did I go wrong, I lost a friend
<br />Somewhere along in the bitterness
<br />And I would have stayed up with you all night
<br />Had I known how to save a life
<br /><br />Where did I go wrong, I lost a friend
<br />Somewhere along in the bitterness
<br />And I would have stayed up with you all night
<br />Had I known how to save a life
<br />How to save a life
<br />How to save a life
<br /><br />Where did I go wrong, I lost a friend
<br />Somewhere along in the bitterness
<br />And I would have stayed up with you all night
<br />Had I known how to save a life
<br /><br />Where did I go wrong, I lost a friend
<br />Somewhere along in the bitterness
<br />And I would have stayed up with you all night
<br />Had I known how to save a life
<br />How to save a life

<br /><br />I have a friend coming over on tuesday who I am suppose to be impressing with my culinary delights she has been over about twice so far and each time I have tried to cook something more mouthwateringly brilliant. Just want you opinions on what sounds more delicious or perhaps add ingrediant suggestions I want to keep it with salmon;
<br /><br />Salmon with a fresh coriander pesto and breadcrumb crust &lt;---- this is open to suggestion and I may change it haven't thought about it thoroughly but it will be crust type topping for sure.
<br />Accompanied by crushed new potatoes and baked asparagus with a touch of fresh hollondaise sauce or maybe a dill sauce and skip the pesto on the salmon indecisive atm
<br /><br />Salmon baked in a bag with lime, ginger, chilli and coriander &lt;-- baking in a bag is like steaming but infusing the steam with flavours
<br />Cous Cous with slow roasted piquanto peppers (sweet with a bit of chilli like heat), red onion and an extra ingrediant perhaps pinenuts for texture mixed through the cous cous.
<br />Asparagus chargrilled in the gridle pan may accompany it as I think it needs something vege related extra but open to suggestion.
<br /><br />Pudding is a chilled souffle thinking along the lines of lemon and white chocolate 
<br /><br />Last week it was chargrilled chicken that had been stuffed/rolled with cream cheese, garlic, thyme and shallots then sliced to make it appear the chicken is C shaped with the filling in the centre and fettuccine with shiitake mushrooms so I want to get away from italian food.
