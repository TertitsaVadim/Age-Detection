Seriously, some of the girls on here, it is absolutely impossible to show them a shred of respect.  Even the mothers on here, I mean, come on, you're a mother now, surely going through that would give you an ounce of self respect for yourself &amp; would make you expect some from others as well.  
<br /><br />You make it hard for us girls who are ladies.  And let's face it, you gotta act like a lady to be treated like a lady.  And if u post up pics of you in ur underwear, well, ur just asking for sleazy attention.  I think you gotta be pretty desperate to not only accept that kind of attention, but actually seek it out.  Naturally, everyone likes to be complimented.  But I prefer a comment like 'you have a beautiful smile' rather than 'nice boobs'.
<br /><br />So girls, put ya clothes back on &amp; stop promoting the idea that all us females are bimbos &amp; whores.

Just for the Australian government to acknowledge the wrong that was done to our people is a massive step in my eyes. And I think what's great too though is that it's not going to end just here with words. A huge step forward for Australia I believe.
<br /><br />On a more negative note, what about that stinkin opposition leader. He wasn't friggen sorry for anything, he couldn't give a damn about Aboriginal people or the issues surrounding us. He tiptoed around the cold hard truth, whereas I really admired Kevin Rudd for not dong that at all.....he was straight up with it all, as ugly as it is. And that Brendan Nelson fulla talkin about the children who have been sexually abused like it's all blackfullas doing it. Made me angry ay. 
<br /><br />But yeah, gotta finish off positive. Sorry has finally been said after countless years of our people struggling for recognition, &amp; I think it's great day. Let's hope that Kevin lives up to the rest of his promises, but I feel optimistic considering that start that he's made already. 
<br /><br />Peace out ppl, Niesha

Was supposed to gig last night, but I came down with a cold monday, so I was pretty cut that I had to cancel last night.  However, if anyone out there in Brissie has nothing exciting to do on a Tuesday night, come down to Kaliber! <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/biggrin.gif" alt=":)" />  (shameless plug I know).  Anywayz, Kaliber is in the Brunswick St Mall, right next door to Ric's, and Jimmy &amp; I shall be there every tues night from about 8-ish........so yah, would love to see some of you pan.netpeeps there!  
<br /><br />Hmm, what else is new?  Can't think of anything atm.  I'm feeling pretty miserable at from this damn cold, have my lil box of tissues beside me in the library here, so I'm looking fwd to going home to bed.  Actually, I think I might just go &amp; do that now.  So peace out pplz, hope you guys are all going well, &amp; one day I'll have the net back &amp; be able to come back on here again!
