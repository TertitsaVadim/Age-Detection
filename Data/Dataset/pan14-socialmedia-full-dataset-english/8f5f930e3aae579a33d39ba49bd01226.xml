A well-stocked freezer can save you a trip to the store when you're pressed for time, which could mean the difference between making dinner and ordering in. It also lets you save meals that you prepare in big batches ahead of time, take advantage of discounts at the grocery store, and keep food that might otherwise go to waste. 
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/laugh.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />Freezing is also an easy way to preserve local, in-season, fruits, and veggies that you buy at farmers markets or grow in your garden. If you want to eat delicious tomatoes in the dead of winter, for example, but are intimidated by canning, freezing is worth considering. 
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/doh.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />But just how long will that casserole or whole chicken last in the freezer? According to the Food Safety and Inspection Service, food stored in a freezer set at 0 degrees Fahrenheit will stay safe indefinitely. But that doesn't mean the taste and texture will remain the same. 
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/blink.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />Here is a guide to how long you can freeze foods before you sacrifice quality. Keep in mind that quality does deteriorate the longer food sits in your freezer, so aim to defrost sooner rather than later. 
<br /><br />Bacon: 1 to 2 months
<br />Breads: 2 to 3 months 
<br />Casseroles: 2 to 3 months
<br />Cooked beef and pork: 2 to 3 months
<br />Cooked poultry: 4 months
<br />Cookie dough: 3 months
<br />Fruit: 8 to 12 months
<br />Frozen dinners: 3 to 4 months
<br />Hot dogs: 1 to 2 months
<br />Lunch meats: 1 to 2 months
<br />Sausage: 1 to 2 months
<br />Soups and stews: 2 to 3 months
<br />Uncooked chicken (parts): 9 months
<br />Uncooked chicken (whole): 1 year
<br />Uncooked steaks, chops, or roasts: 4 to 12 months
<br />Uncooked ground meat: 3 to 4 months 
<br />Vegetables: 8 to 12 months
<br /><br />Basic tips for freezing food: 
<br />Freeze foods as close to purchase (or harvest if you have a garden) as possible. The fresher food is when you freeze it, the better the quality when you defrost it. 
<br />While most foods can be frozen, there are some foods you should keep out of the freezer. Don't freeze canned foods or eggs in shells (which can crack and allow bacteria to enter). Technically you can freeze mayonnaise, cream sauce, and lettuce, but the quality takes a big hit. Here's a list of foods that don't freeze well with details on their condition after thawing. 
<br />Cool cooked foods down before freezing so they freeze faster, which helps preserve quality.
<br />Packaging matters and varies depending on what you're freezing. If you choose glass over plastic containers, wrap, or bags, you'll need to make sure it's tempered so it doesn't break. 
<br />You can freeze meat in its original packaging, but if you want to store it for long periods of time, add an additional layer of packaging, such as plastic wrap or bags. 
<br />It's always a good idea to label items so you know what they are and how long they've been in the freezer. 
<br />Resist the temptation to defrost foods on your countertop. The three safest ways to thaw foods are in your fridge, in cold water, and in the microwave. 
<br /><br />How to freeze fresh produce: 
<br />The key to freezing fresh fruit is to spread out the cleaned, dried, and prepared (cut up) pieces of fruit on cookie sheets. Once the individual pieces of fruit are frozen, you can combine and put in freezer bags. Some people prefer to pack fruits in sugar or sugar syrup to help preserve texture and flavor. The National Center for Home Food Preservation has tips on how to freeze specific fruits such as strawberries, tomatoes, peaches, and many more. 
<br />Vegetables usually need to be blanched (boiled or steamed for a short time) before freezing to maintain flavor, color, and texture. Blanching times vary depending on the vegetable. The National Center for Home Food Preservation has a chart with blanching times for everything from corn to collard greens and simple instructions for how to freeze a large variety of vegetables.

<br />by Kaboodle.com, on Wed Sep 22, 2010 9:47am PDT 229 Comments Post a Comment Read More from This Author » Report Abuse ShareretweetEmailPrint Although we’re inclined to scour the Web in search of the best diets and meal plans, the truth is, some of the tools to weight-loss success are already on your spice rack! Here are five ingredients that not only add flavor to your favorite dishes but can help in your battle against the bulge.
<br /><br />1. Cinnamon
<br />A 2003 study published in Diabetes Care showed that as little as one teaspoon of cinnamon per day can boost the body’s weight-loss ability by reducing blood sugar and promoting healthier processing of carbohydrates. It also lowers LDL cholesterol (bad cholesterol) by seven to 27% and total cholesterol by 12 to 26%. Plus, cinnamon has been shown to prevent the metabolic syndrome commonly seen in pre-diabetics. But before you go on piling the spice by spoonful, note that cinnamon contains a chemical called coumarin, which can lead to liver damage if consumed in very large amounts.

<br /><br />2. Cayenne
<br />The main ingredient in spicy cayenne—capsaicin, which is also found in other hot peppers—has long been studied for its fat-burning abilities and thermogenic properties (the stimulating of the central nervous system to produce heat in the body, leading to an increase in calorie burning). In fact, Nicholas Perricone, M.D., cites several of these studies in his wildly popular The Perricone Weight-Loss Diet and concludes that capsaicin acts as an appetite suppressant. Many think that cayenne pepper promotes weight loss because it’s simply difficult to overindulge in spicy food. However, later studies performed by the Journal of Obesity also found that the spice increases fat oxidation, “ramps up energy expenditure, and stimulates activity by the sympathetic nervous system”—all which help the body to shed excess weight. Not a fan of fiery cuisine? Not to worry! Research has found that cayenne’s ability to reduce appetite is equally effective whether ingested as food or in capsule form.

<br /><br />3. Black Pepper
<br />Among the dozens of health benefits of this common household ingredient is its ability to improve digestion and promote the absorption of nutrients in tissues all over the body. Plus, its main component—piperine (which gives pepper its pungent taste)—boosts fat metabolism by as much as 8% for several hours after ingesting it. If you want your pepper to pack the most punch, use freshly ground pepper, which has the most concentrated amounts of piperine.

<br /><br />4. Mustard Seed
<br />Like the other hot ingredients on this list, spicy mustard helps boost metabolism and allows you to burn fat more quickly, thanks in part to its thermogenic properties. Scientists at England’s Oxford Polytechnic Institute recently found that eating just one teaspoon of hot mustard can “boost metabolism 20 to 25% for several hours after eating, resulting in an additional burn of about 45 calories if a 700-calorie meal is consumed.”

<br /><br />5. Ginger
<br />Long used for its medicinal properties, ginger is also an effective diuretic (a substance that increases the elimination of urine). It improves gastric mobility (i.e. it pushes food and waste through the digestive system) and hinders the absorption of cholesterol. Although according to the Mayo Clinic, more study is needed, preliminary evidence suggests that this versatile spice helps to increase metabolism.

And one of the simplest and most straightforward ways to do this is by keeping your linens spic-and-span.
<br /><br />Though how often you wash your sheets is clearly a personal decision, there are scientific arguments for washing your bedding weekly to benefit your health. According to ehow.com and examiner.com, laundering sheets weekly (in hot, 130-or-more degree water) gets rid of the dead skin cells (fodder for bacteria) and allergy-inducing dust mites that accumulate after a few nights’ sleep. If you or someone in your family is prone to sweating—or if you’ve got Fido cozying up with your in bed—consider washing every couple days to rinse out dirt and pet dander. Don’t ignore your mattress pad either—it’s a good idea to wash it bi-weekly or at least monthly.
<br /><br />Pillows are another consideration. To ensure you’re not resting your head on a big pile of germs—you should be washing your pillows at least every six months. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions when washing them, though generally you should be able to clean them in your home washing machine, and with down ones in particular, it’s a good idea to throw in a couple clean tennis balls while drying which helps keep feathers fluffy. Investing in zippered pillow protectors is also key: they act as a barrier between your pillow and its case (the latter of which should be washed at least weekly) to keep the former nice and sanitary.
<br /><br />Comforters and blankets need proper maintenance as well. Your comforter should we washed monthly (and your duvet weekly). Read the care instructions on the label, since chances are you’re going to need a front loading commercial size washer to accomplish this. Make sure it’s dried properly to avoid mold and fungus from growing. Blankets should also be washed or dry cleaned monthly.
<br /><br />Towels, as we previously discussed, also need TLC—with washcloths and hand towels, in particular (since they’re actually used to wipe off the dirt and oils off your skin), there’s a real risk of spreading staph infections and pinkeye. It's also a good idea because bathrooms are warm, humid breeding grounds for bacteria to begin with. Washing bath towels weekly, and smaller, more frequently used towels even more often that that, is the best way to tackle the germ problem.

Where did all your money go? We all have our black holes, those money pits that seem to magically make our cash disappear. Here are six bad habits that will make you broke, and how to break them:

<br /><br />• Top 6 Mindless Money Wasters 
<br /><br />• 8 Steps to Teach Your Partner Household Finances 
<br /><br />• 6 Generic Products That Are Just as Good 
<br /><br />1. Window Shopping
<br />It can be fun to browse the aisles and see what's out there. We all have our weak spots, like home goods, electronics or clothes -- even if you don't like to go to the mall. You don't even have to leave the house to window shop anymore; those catalogs, the internet and commercials advertising the latest sale can be just as tempting.
<br /><br />Window shopping is a bad financial habit that takes some discipline to break. Staying away from stores and not requesting catalogs or email updates from your favorite stores is a good place to start. Before buying that latest item you pine for, ask yourself two questions: Do I need it and can I pay cash for it? If your answer is no, walk away.

<br /><br />2. Carrying Lots of Cash 
<br />You know that paying with plastic is bad, but carrying lots of cash can be just as bad a habit. Cash can give you the feeling of having extra -- fun money that's just sitting there.
<br /><br />Only carry enough cash for what you need, and leave the rest at home. Avoiding plastic is great, but budgeting is just as important when choosing to pay cash. If you like the green, try budgeting your cash with envelopes: one for groceries, one for entertainment, etc.
<br /><br />3. Saving Your Info With Vendors 
<br />Those online shopping sites are so considerate to save your address and credit card information -- some even have one-click ordering buttons, so you can buy something in just a second. It's very easy, but also very dangerous. Not only does this easy shopping make you broke if you're prone to impulse shopping, it also eliminates the feeling of spending money, since all you do is click.
<br /><br />Don't allow vendors to store your credit card information. Avoid signing up for emails and catalogs if those tempt you to shop when you really shouldn't. It can be great to know about a sale, but if you didn't need anything, it's just another temptation.

<br /><br />4. Clipping Unneeded Coupons 
<br />We all feel the pinch in this tougher economy, especially when buying groceries. Clipping coupons is downright trendy today -- but is it really such a good habit? Sure, getting 50 cents off that package of cookies or that brand-name detergent is a discount, but you may be surprised to find that your grocery bill isn't really going down despite all your coupon clipping. The truth is that buying generic brands that are just as tasty is often cheaper; coupons can make us buy things even we didn't plan for.
<br /><br />Start with a grocery list for the week, and then look at your clipped coupons. If you can use one, great, but try supermarket brands too for the best bottom line.
<br /><br />5. Shopping With Your Emotions 
<br />It was a rough week, or a good one, or you want to reward yourself for losing a few pounds, so you go shopping. You earned that new dress, that new gadget, that big pie -- it was on sale, too. Letting your mood dictate your buying decisions is the quickest way to go broke.
<br /><br />Sober up before shopping. Do you need these items, and can you afford them? Be honest with yourself. Reward yourself by doing something that doesn't cost, like taking a nice bath, or spending time with your loved ones.
<br /><br />6. Not Planning Ahead 
<br />It's Tuesday, you're tired, and have no idea what you'll make for dinner. A great night for takeout, right? Using data from the BLS, it's estimated that the average family of four spends over $4,000 on eating out -- a very expensive habit that will make you broke in a hurry.
<br /><br />[How to Get Free Travel Upgrades]
<br /><br />When you make your grocery list, make a menu for the week at the same time, so you always have ingredients for a meal. If your week is hectic, try cooking on Sunday and freezing meals for the week. Plan for lunches the same way; not only will you save money, you'll eat healthier by avoiding fatty restaurant food.
<br /><br />The Bottom Line
<br />It takes some discipline to break these bad habits. With some planning, discipline and avoiding tempting situations, you can break these habits -- and maybe even find you'll have a little extra cash at the end of the month.

Before you invest in a new $1,500 mattress or spend a couple of nights wired with electrodes in a sleep lab, see if you can trace your sleep troubles to one of these widely believed myths. Then try our tips for better sleep every night. 
<br /><br />1. Many people are &amp;quot;short sleepers&amp;quot;
<br />Fact: If you genuinely require less than 6 hours of sleep a night, you're a rarity. A just-discovered genetic mutation does enable some people to function okay on 20 to 25% less sleep than average, but—here's the catch—researchers estimate that fewer than 1% of people have the trait. 
<br /><br />Energy fix: Two likely signs you're among the lucky short-sleeping crowd: You wake up regularly without an alarm clock, and at the same time every day—weekdays, weekends, vacations—says Emory University sleep expert David Schulman, MD. &amp;quot;But most of us need 7 to 8 hours of sleep to stay healthy.&amp;quot; 
<br /><br />8 New secrets for all-day energy. 
<br /><br />2. Napping only makes you more tired
<br />Fact: Some people swear that quick naps make them sleepier, but a snooze that's less than 20 minutes should perk most of us up. 
<br /><br />&amp;quot;Just 10 to 20 minutes is all you need to get the benefits of napping, such as alertness, improved performance, and better mood,&amp;quot; says Kimberly A. Cote, PhD, a sleep researcher at Brock University in Ontario. Here's why: During sleep, your brain produces different kinds of waves, which correspond to how deeply you sleep. After about 20 minutes, the sleeping brain may move into what's called slow-wave sleep, which is the deepest phase of sleep. If you nap too long, you may feel groggy and disoriented upon awakening instead of refreshed because long naps are more likely to contain deep slow-wave sleep. 
<br /><br />When you nap also matters. &amp;quot;A power nap should be early in the day so it doesn't interfere with your ability to fall asleep at bedtime,&amp;quot; says David Neubauer, MD, associate director of the Johns Hopkins Sleep Disorders Center. Most people's inner body clocks trigger drowsiness somewhere between 1 and 4 PM. 
<br /><br />Energy fix: To make naps a daily ritual, doze off faster by using something you associate with sleep (a favorite pillow or lavender eye mask). Also, nap in a comfortable chair or couch instead of your bed to avoid the temptation to doze for too long, so you don't wake up with a sleep hangover. 
<br /><br />3. Exercise too close to bed keeps you up
<br />Fact: That's not true for everyone. In fact, research shows that even vigorous exercise right before bedtime doesn't cause trouble sleeping for many people (and in some cases it may help). 
<br /><br />This is good news if your busy schedule gives you a short window of time after work to squeeze in some activity. Even people who have trouble sleeping can probably exercise about an hour before bed without problems. &amp;quot;But we don't have hard data, so people really have to do their own testing,&amp;quot; says Michael Perlis, PhD, director of the University of Pennsylvania Behavioral Sleep Medicine Program. 
<br /><br />Energy fix: Experiment. If you exercise at night and suspect that your workout may be keeping you up, reschedule it for earlier in the day for several days to see whether you sleep better. Keeping a sleep diary for those days—noting when you exercise and how well you sleep—can help. If you find you do sleep better when you exercise earlier, make the switch permanent. 
<br /><br />10 Tips for better sleep. 
<br /><br />4. It's normal to nod off during a meeting
<br />Fact: It's normal to feel slightly less energetic in the afternoon because of your body's natural circadian rhythms. 
<br /><br />But you shouldn't feel like your head's about to droop while your group VP is giving a 4 PM presentation or when your preschooler is explaining why Superman is better than Batman. If your eyelids feel heavy, you're too tired, says William C. Dement, MD, PhD, the Stanford University scientist known as the father of sleep medicine. 
<br /><br />In fact, if you feel tired during the day, you may be running a significant &amp;quot;sleep debt&amp;quot;—the total hours of sleep you've lost, one sleep-deprived night after another. If you need 8 hours of sleep and get only 7, after a week you've lost the equivalent of almost one night's sleep. That's your sleep debt. After losing only the equivalent of one night's sleep over the course of a week, your body will respond as if you'd pulled an all-nighter: You may experience waves of extreme fatigue; itchy, burning eyes; mood swings; inability to focus; and even hunger as your body tries to find a way (&amp;quot;Aha! Chocolate-covered pretzels!&amp;quot<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/wink.gif" alt=":)" /> to grasp on to energy. Sleep debt is linked with chronic, serious health issues like high blood pressure and diabetes. 
<br /><br />Energy fix: If your sleep is interrupted once in a while, one good night's sleep will help you feel refreshed. Chronic problems—stress, a snoring spouse, the snuggling pet—will require specific solutions (a visit to the doctor, a bed in the hallway for Spike). But if you're cheating yourself of sleep time &amp;quot;to get things done,&amp;quot; or if you just don't realize how much sleep you need, you have to adjust your bedtime and hit the hay earlier (try this tip to get more sleep). 
<br /><br />5. Go to sleep earlier if you have insomnia
<br />Fact: Step away from the bed. 
<br /><br />If you suffer from true insomnia, this could make your tossing and turning much worse, says Cote. Blame it on something called the sleep homeostat. A hardwired system controlled by brain chemicals, it's not unlike your appetite. The longer you go between meals and the more active you are, the hungrier you become. Likewise, your homeostat builds up a hunger for sleep based on how long you've been awake and how active you've been. The more sleep hungry you are, the faster you nod off and the more soundly you doze. But just as you're not eager for a big meal at night if you pig out all day or snack too close to dinner, you're not going to feel tired if you go to bed earlier or nap. When you have insomnia, experts recommend that you let your sleep homeostat adjust itself naturally, without trying to compensate with different bedtimes and catnaps. 
<br /><br />Energy fix: Go to bed an hour later than usual (to make yourself more tired). If you feel anxious about falling asleep, get up and leave the bedroom. Try reading or some other low-key activity. Two other tips that can help bring on natural sleep: Dunk in a warm bath before bed. It temporarily spikes your body temperature, but lying down afterward makes it drop because your muscles relax and produce less heat. Sleep tends to follow a steep decline in body temperature. Also, exercise during the day. Research shows that a 30- to 45-minute bout helps insomniacs enjoy better and somewhat longer sleep. 
<br /><br />Tired all the time? It could signal a more serious health problem. 
<br /><br />6. Skipping a little sleep isn't that horrible
<br />Fact: Missing even 90 minutes of sleep for just 1 night can reduce your daytime alertness by as much as 32%. 
<br /><br />That's enough to impair your memory, your thinking ability, and your safety on the job and on the road. One Australian study found that volunteers who stayed awake just 6 hours past their normal bedtime for a single day performed as poorly on tests gauging attentiveness and reaction time as those who were legally drunk. The National Sleep Foundation's 2009 poll showed that as many as 1.9 million drivers have had a car crash or a near miss due to drowsiness in the past year. 
<br /><br />What's worse, sleep deprivation also impairs your ability to recognize that you're not running on all cylinders. In other words, you really shouldn't be operating heavy machinery (or much else), but you don't realize it. &amp;quot;The ability to judge how well you're doing is probably one of the first things to go when you don't get enough sleep,&amp;quot; says Cote. &amp;quot;That's why you need to take preventive measures.&amp;quot; 
<br /><br />Energy fix: If you miss several hours of sleep one night, consider calling in sick the next day or ask if you can work from home. (That way, you won't have to drive.) If you find yourself nodding off at your desk, take a brisk walk up and down the stairs or hall. Exercise helps you snap to, in part because the accompanying rise in body temperature appears to boost alertness for a time. If possible, set aside part of your lunch hour for a nap. Remember to set an alarm, or ask a buddy to wake you. 
<br /><br />7. Just catch up on sleep on the weekend
<br />Fact: Unless you have insomnia, it's theoretically possible to make up for some lost sleep by dozing longer on the weekend. But it's not realistic. 
<br /><br />With kids' birthday parties, sports practices, and all those inevitable weekend errands, chances are you won't really be able to make up for the sleep you missed, says Dement. You'll end up finishing the week in the red, with an ever-bigger sleep debt. 
<br /><br />Energy fix: Don't regularly skimp on weekday sleep with the expectation you'll bounce back over the weekend. If you do happen to rack up an occasional sleep debt during the workweek, try to sleep later on the weekend or take a nap so you can pay at least part of it down, Dement says. Invest in a white-noise machine to help snooze through the din of lawn mowers and your kids' afternoon games in the yard. 
<br /><br />5 Signals you're sleep deprived. 
<br /><br />8. It doesn't matter when you go to sleep
<br />Fact: Night owls are nearly 3 times more likely to experience symptoms of depression than early birds, one study found—even when they got the same total amount of sleep. 
<br /><br />Experts aren't sure exactly why, but there may be an optimal time within the 24-hour clock to fall asleep and wake up, says Lisa Shives, MD, sleep expert and founder of North Shore Sleep Medicine. &amp;quot;This and other research shows that going to bed late can be bad for your mood and your overall health.&amp;quot; 
<br /><br />Energy fix: If you want to shift back your bedtime, start gradually: head to bed 15 to 30 minutes earlier every few days, and make sure the lights in your home are dim for about 2 hours before that time, says Shives. Then set your alarm to wake up 7 to 8 hours later. 
<br /><br />9. You have to be in bad shape to take sleeping pills
<br />Fact: Actually, sleeping pills are most helpful if you take them before insomnia becomes chronic, says Carl E. Hunt, MD, director of the National Institutes of Health National Center on Sleep Disorders Research. They can help correct your off-kilter sleep homeostat. 
<br /><br />Today's popular pills like Ambien and Sonata, unlike older versions, help you drift off to sleep within minutes and stay asleep, thus breaking the cycle of sleeplessness and anxiety that can turn a few nights of insomnia into chronic sleeplessness. They also wear off faster than older meds, so you're not semi-comatose in the morning. Like all medicines, sleeping pills can cause side effects (dizziness, headache, agitation), and they're not meant for long-term use. 
<br /><br />Energy fix: Ask your doctor about the pros and cons of sleeping meds for you. If you'd prefer a drug-free alternative, consider cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT); long-term, it can be more effective than pills at combating insomnia. CBT trains insomniacs to avoid bad habits and counterproductive worries about lost sleep. Usually the therapy runs from four to eight sessions, but some patients find relief with as few as two. The downside of CBT: It can cost hundreds per session and, unlike pills, may not be covered by insurance.

You probably know exactly what these funny-sounding phrases mean but are clueless about where on earth they came from. That's why we went to historian Albert Jack, author of Black Sheep and Lame Ducks: The Origins of Even More Phrases We Use Every Day to find out the history behind some of the most commonly used sayings. 
<br />&amp;quot;Bare-faced lie&amp;quot;
<br /><br />If someone has ever told you a bare-faced lie, you know they didn't make any effort to show guilt or remorse. According to Jack, the phrase refers to the idea that a clean-shaven face could not conceal any lies, unlike a bearded mug, which could hide all manner of deceit. But over time, explains Jack, &amp;quot;the phrase came to describe a person who didn't care whether or not he was lying and had no real intention of concealing his deception.&amp;quot; Photo: Thinkstock
<br /><br />Have you told one of these common marriage lies?
<br /><br />&amp;quot;More than you can shake a stick at&amp;quot;
<br /><br />Farmers with more sheep than they could control with their wooden staffs are believed to have inspired this phrase, which means you have more of something than you need. But according to Jack, there's a second possible origin. &amp;quot;After George Washington was once seen waving a ceremonial wooden sword over the British troops he had recently defeated, other American generals began to use the expression to justify themselves when they had not been quite as successful as the great man himself was in battle. 'We had more men to fight than you could wave a stick at' was apparently a common excuse for failure on the battlefield.&amp;quot; Photo: Thinkstock 
<br />&amp;quot;Run amok&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;run amuck&amp;quot;
<br /><br />A raucous partygoer can be described as going wild or running amok, an expression that derives from &amp;quot;the Malaysian word amoq, which, when literally translated, describes the behavior of tribesmen who, under the influence of opium, became wild, rampaging mobs that attacked anybody in their path,&amp;quot; writes Jack. He reports that the phrase became popular in England during the 17th century, when travelers would try to impress people with their knowledge of foreign cultures. Photo: iStockphoto
<br /><br />&amp;quot;Blood is thicker than water&amp;quot;
<br /><br />Anyone with a tight family bond will tell you blood is thicker than water. But they may be surprised to learn that the saying has little to do with familial ties. Jack explains that in ancient Middle Eastern culture, &amp;quot;blood rituals symbolized bonds that were far greater than those of the family.&amp;quot; That explains &amp;quot;blood brothers&amp;quot;—warriors who symbolically shared the blood they shed in battle together—having a stronger bond than biological brothers. Furthermore, Jack says there is an expression from 3,000 years ago that says: &amp;quot;The blood of the covenant is far stronger than the water of the womb.&amp;quot; Jack suggests that the true meaning of this phrase became muddled by English nobility who wanted to stress the importance of bloodlines. Photo: Thinkstock
<br /><br />&amp;quot;Butter someone up&amp;quot;
<br /><br />It's easy to assume that the idea behind this phrase—which means to lay flattery on thick—has to do with how smoothly butter spreads onto bread. Not quite. Jack reveals an ancient Indian custom of &amp;quot;throwing butterballs of ghee (clarified butter commonly used in Indian cooking) at the statues of the gods&amp;quot; to seek favor. Additionally, the Tibetan tradition of creating butter sculptures for the New Year &amp;quot;can be traced to the Tang Dynasty and the belief that such offerings would bring peace and happiness for the full lunar year.&amp;quot; Photo: Shutterstock
<br /><br />&amp;quot;Cat got your tongue?&amp;quot;
<br /><br />According to Jack, there are two possible sources of this phrase, which refers to when a normally chatty person is at a loss for words, often for suspicious reasons. The first refers to when victims of the cat-o'-nine-tails––a whip the English Navy used for flogging––were left speechless from the pain inflicted upon them. The second, which is equally morbid, traces back to medieval times, when punishment &amp;quot;for liars and blasphemers [was to] have their tongues cut out and then fed to the cats.&amp;quot; Ancient Egyptian cats were considered to be gods (and would eat just about anything), so giving them the tongue of a liar was &amp;quot;seen as a human offering to the gods.&amp;quot; Photo: Shutterstock
<br /><br />&amp;quot;Have a yen for&amp;quot;
<br /><br />When you really want something, it can be said you have a &amp;quot;yen&amp;quot; for it. But the phrase doesn't actually refer to Japanese currency—it refers to Chinese opium, which was available in Britain and America in the late 1800s. &amp;quot;The phrase comes from the Chinese word yan, which can be translated to craving,&amp;quot; Jack writes. Photo: iStockphoto
<br /><br />&amp;quot;The writing is on the wall&amp;quot;
<br /><br />The roots of this phrase, which means that something negative is inevitable, trace back to the Bible, explains Jack. In the Book of Daniel, God punishes King Belshazzar for boasting and foreshadows his demise by having the words for “Numbered, Numbered, Weighed, Divided” (which all refer to how he was to be taken down) literally written on the wall. Photo: Thinkstock
<br /><br />&amp;quot;Turn a blind eye&amp;quot;
<br /><br />The 1801 Battle of Copenhagen is at the root of this saying, which means to pretend you don't know what's happening, Jack explains. During the battle, Admiral Sir Hyde Parker, commander of the British fleet, attempted to stop Horatio Nelson from launching an attack on the enemy. &amp;quot;When Nelson's officers pointed out the order, he famously raised a telescope to his blind eye and replied: 'Order, what order? I see no ships.'&amp;quot; Photo: iStockphoto
<br /><br />&amp;quot;Pass the buck&amp;quot;
<br /><br />Don't want to take responsibility for something yourself? Just pass the buck, or hand off the duties to someone else. The phrase originated in the American Wild West during poker games, according to Jack. &amp;quot;The most common knife available was known as a buckhorn knife. As all cowboys and ranchers carried them around, one of them would be placed in front of whoever was due to deal the next hand, and in games where the stakes were running too high for a player, he could opt out of his turn at dealing by passing the buckhorn knife on to the next player. But even if he did choose to play, he still avoided the responsibility of setting the bets next time around by passing the buck along.&amp;quot; Photo: Thinkstock
<br /><br />&amp;quot;Give the cold shoulder&amp;quot;
<br /><br />Giving someone the cold shoulder is a rude way of telling the person he or she isn’t welcome, but the origins of this phrase are actually quite polite, explains Jack. After feasts in medieval England, the host would signal to his guests it was time to leave by giving them a slice of cold meat from the shoulder of beef, mutton or pork. &amp;quot;It was regarded as a civilized and polite gesture.&amp;quot; Photo: Shutterstock
<br /><br />&amp;quot;Go cold turkey&amp;quot;
<br /><br />If you want to quit anything, from alcohol or cigarettes to chocolate or soda, without weaning yourself off it, you can say you're &amp;quot;going cold turkey.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;The original idea was that a person withdrawing from using drugs would find his or her skin turning hard to the touch and translucent to look at, with goose pimples all over—like the skin of a plucked turkey,&amp;quot; writes Jack. It's also been suggested that the phrase is a comparison between eating a no-prep meal of cold turkey and stopping heavy drug use without preparation. Photo: Shutterstock
<br /><br />&amp;quot;Eat humble pie&amp;quot;
<br /><br />Oddly enough, making an apology and suffering humiliation along with it, as the saying connotes, has little to do with &amp;quot;eating humble pie.&amp;quot; Jack explains that the phrase dates back to the Middle Ages, when, during a post-hunt feast, the lord of the manor would eat the finest cuts of meat. But those of lower standing would be served the entrails and innards, known as &amp;quot;umbles,&amp;quot; baked into a pie. &amp;quot;It was common practice for people to be humiliated by finding themselves seated at the wrong end of the table and served 'umble pie.'&amp;quot; Photo: Thinkstock
<br /><br />&amp;quot;Blow hot and cold&amp;quot;
<br /><br />Have a friend who constantly changes their opinions? You might say he’s &amp;quot;blowing hot and cold.&amp;quot; Jack informs us that the expression comes from a story in classical mythology in which a traveler is given food and shelter by a kind woodland god. &amp;quot;According to the legend, the woodland god gave the traveler a room for the night and some hot soup. The man blew on his fingers to warm them and then, with the same breath, blew on the soup to cool it. Irritated at the man's apparent indecision, the woodland god packed him off outside and sent him back on his travels.&amp;quot; Photo: Getty Images

<br /><br />Warner Bros. has scuttled plans to release the new &quot;Harry Potter&quot; in 3D.
<br /><br />In a statement released Friday, the studio said that when &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 1&quot; arrives in theaters on Nov. 19, it will be in 2D, playing both conventional theaters and IMAX, but that &quot;we will not have a completed 3D version of the film within our release date window.&quot;
<br /><br />The statement continued: &quot;Despite everyone's best efforts, we were unable to convert the film in its entirety and meet the highest standards of quality. We do not want to disappoint fans who have long-anticipated the conclusion of this extraordinary journey.&quot;
<br /><br />Director David Yates adds: &quot;This decision, which we completely support, underscores the fact that Warner Bros. has always put quality first.&quot;
<br /><br />Recent 2D-to-3D conversion have been controversial, with many fans and critics complaining about the look of the studio's &quot;Clash of the Titans,&quot; which underwent a similar conversion and was released earlier this year.
<br /><br />&quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 2&quot; is still scheduled to be released in 2D and 3D on July 15th, 2011.

<br /><br />Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint
<br /> Mike Marsland/Wireimage.com While fans of the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series headed to the Web on Thursday to catch the London red carpet premiere of the latest movie, others wondered why the actors wore matching red poppy boutonnieres. 
<br /><br />Stars Daniel Radcliffe, 21, Emma Watson, 20, and Rupert Grint, 22, who play Harry Potter and his best friends, Hermione and Ron, all donned the red blooms. They were joined by attendees Tom Felton and Ralph Fiennes and none other than J.K. Rowling herself -- and not just because they looked dapper. The flowers have a special meaning in Britain. 
<br /><br />While fans of the movie may think of the debut as &quot;Harry Potter&quot; Day, it was actually Remembrance Day, or Poppy Day in the U.K. 
<br /><br />Emma Watson 'emotional' over being a millionaire &gt;&gt; 
<br /><br />Remembrance Day was first marked by King George V back in 1919, as a way to honor those who died fighting in World War I. A poem, &quot;In Flanders Fields,&quot; where the flowers bloomed on the battlefields of Flanders, gave life to the symbol of the red flower. The red color of the bud was a telling memento for spilled blood. 
<br /><br />Similar to Memorial Day in the U.S., it's a time to honor those who have lost their lives in war. And wearing the red flower is still a tradition. 
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/tongue.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />Searches on &quot;remembrance day&quot; were up 200% in one day. &quot;Remembrance day poppy&quot;, &quot;remembrance day poppy clip art&quot; and &quot;remembrance day poems&quot; also saw large gains. 
<br /><br />That's why the stars of &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows&quot; wore their red flowers, even while on the red carpet.

<br /><br />With post-gym starvation, afternoon slumps and evening noshing in front of the TV, it’s super-easy to think that you need more food—even if you just ate. To help keep your caloric intake within a healthy range, we spoke with experts as well as looked into the latest research to find out how you can stay full longer. Below, eight surprising ways to stave off hunger and, ultimately, unwanted inches. 
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/innocent.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />1. Eat fatty foods. It sounds strange, but zapping all the fat from your diet will actually make you fatter.Your body needs unsaturated (a.k.a. “good”) fats to function properly and stay energized as well as absorb certain vitamins. Need some incentive? A recent study by researchers at the University of California, Irvine, showed that the unsaturated fat found in avocados and olive oil is converted into a compound that curbs your hunger. Just be careful not to overdo it. Make sure that only 30 percent of your daily calories come from fat, says Rania Batayneh, MPH, a nutritionist with The Sports Club/LA - San Francisco. If you’re operating on a 1,500-calorie diet, your meals should contain a maximum of 10 percent saturated fat, Batayneh says.
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/flowers.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />2. Chew gum. Even though you don’t technically consume gum, you can still feel fuller from it. A study found that if you chew gum for 60 minutes in the morning, you’ll consume 67 fewer calories at lunch. “There is some evidence that chewing gum can help with feelings of satiety and reduced appetite,” says Elaine Rush, PhD, professor at Auckland University of Technology. “The possible mechanism is not clear, but is [thought to be] associated with the chewing action as well as the taste, smell and flow of saliva.” To keep your choppers in good health, make sure the gum is sugarless; the sugar in gum wreaks havoc on your teeth. Plus, sugarless gum improves the flow of saliva, which further suppresses your appetite, Dr. Rush adds. Photo: Shutterstock
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/music.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />3. Snack on almonds. These all-natural treats contain fiber and unsaturated fat, which combine to create a superpower that makes you feel full. Not only that, a recent study found that you can shrink your waist by a whopping 14 percent if you eat a handful of almonds daily for just half a year. However, almonds are high in calories, so stick to no more than 3 ounces daily for the best weight-loss results. Photo: Thinkstock
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cool.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />4. Return carbohydrates to your diet. We know carbs and starches were practically banned a few years ago, but now they’re back and we’re learning that they’re way better for you than previously thought. Just like there are good and bad fats, not all carbohydrates are created equal. Opt for complex carbs, found in fruits, vegetables and whole grains, which take longer to digest and therefore help keep you feeling full. Potatoes also take a long time to break down due to a type of starch that resists digestive enzymes. Batayneh says, “Potatoes can actually work in your favor,” and often recommends that her clients eat half of a large potato every day with lunch. For even more nutritional value, go for a sweet potato, which is high in fiber and vitamins A and C. Photo: Shutterstock
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/biggrin.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />5. Chow down on grapefruit. A study found that people who ate half of a grapefruit with breakfast, lunch and dinner lost nearly 4 pounds in just three months. That’s because grapefruit lowers your insulin, which regulates your fat metabolism, suppressing your appetite and burning calories faster. Unfortunately, the same can’t be said for citrus juices, which typically contain a lot of sugar. If you want to have the grapefruit in juice form, squeeze it yourself and don’t add any sweetener. Photo: Stockbyte
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/book.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />6. Hit the gym. Going to the gym doesn’t just help you burn calories; a study in the American Journal of Physiology found that doing an hour of cardio will reduce your appetite for up to two hours after you’re done. The cardio reduces your levels of ghrelin (a hormone which increases your appetite) and increases levels of the hormone which suppresses your appetite. However, doing the same cardio day after day can eventually cause any positive effects it has on your metabolism to plateau. Be sure to mix it up at least twice a month with a variety of exercises, like biking, rowing, running and the elliptical machine. Photo: Jupiterimages
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/biggrin.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />7. Try aromatherapy. It may sound new-agey, but a study found that people who smelled peppermint every two hours ate 2,700 fewer calories weekly, which caused them to lose a pound every week. The smell works on your brain, tricking you into thinking you’ve eaten and are therefore fuller than you actually are. Sniffing the peppermint more frequently works even better, so light a candle and you’ll be golden. Photo: Photo: Thinkstock
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />8. Grab some blueberries. Blueberries affect the genes in charge of fat-burning and storage, so eating them not only makes you feel full, but also helps get rid of extra belly fat, says Mitchell Seymour, PhD, research scientist. In Dr. Seymour’s study, the participants ate a cup of blueberries every day for three months, and lost 3 percent of their body fat. If fresh blueberries are out of season, eat frozen ones to get the same benefits.

And you know what? It was heavenly. I visited Isabelle Bellis in New York City, whose studio looks like a small, cozy apartment. She took me through a few relaxation exercises, massaged my face with products for over an hour, and even put on gloves to massage the inside of my mouth! (Totally bizarre, but oddly soothing.)
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/laugh.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />But beyond the blissful experience, there is of course always the question of whether facials are really worth the money. I mean, my skin did look amazing afterward, but was it triple-digit good? And is all that poking and prodding even healthy? Here's what some of the top dermatologists have to say about every step of the average facial—what to indulge in, and what to skip:
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/blushing2.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />STEAMING. “If pores are clogged, steaming lets you clean out dirt without excessive pressure, which can cause inflammation,” says Amy B. Lewis, a New York City dermatologist. It works on all skin types, but the facialist should do it only on clean skin. Bottom line: Do it.
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/ohmy.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />EXTRACTIONS. “Attacking a pimple on your own causes redness and swelling, because your fingers carry bacteria,” explains Doris Day, a New York City dermatologist. “A comedone extractor—which is more precise than gloved fingers—can clear a pimple or a blackhead with less trauma.” If your skin is sensitive, the extractor may cause mild redness or irritation. Bottom line: Proceed with caution.
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/sad.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />MASKS. Soothing and exfoliating masks tend to have the best results, but doctors are less laudatory of collagen masks: “Topical collagen cannot penetrate the skin,” says Leslie Baumann, a Miami Beach dermatologist. As for antioxidant masks, “the ingredients begin to work on the surface to neutralize environmental damage, so there may be some benefit,” says Day. Bottom line: Don't waste your money on the collagen variety. 
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/thumbsup.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />FACIAL MASSAGE. “There's no science to indicate any real gains beyond the way a face massage makes you feel,” says Day. Avoid this step if your skin tends to break out. Bottom line: It's fine if you're into it, but don't expect massage to really do anything.
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/fool.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />MICROCURRENT/ELECTRICITY. These treatments send a painless low-level current to the skin, causing muscle contractions. “The evidence is anecdotal, but this appears to produce subtle, temporary toning,” says Day. Bottom line: “Get it done before a party, but don't rely on it for long-term results,” Days says.
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/fart.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />OXYGEN. Pressurized oxygen is said to drive wrinkle-fighting serums deeper into skin. But, says Baumann, the treatment can “increase free radicals, which lead to aging.” Bottom line: Skip it.
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/elvis.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />PEELS. Experts agree that any peel with glycolic, salicylic, malic, lactic, or citric acid will exfoliate skin's top layer more effectively than will a grainy scrub. There is also evidence that a high-concentration AHA peel (20 to 30 percent) can increase collagen production. “This is where you should spend your money,” Baumann says.

<br /><br />. &quot;My windows always streak after washing&quot;
<br />Use a window-washing squeegee with a smooth, soft rubber edge. Washing windows is a tiresome chore, but it’s even worse when your labors leave streaks on the windows. Here’s how the pros avoid streaking when they wipe off their windows:Use a window-washing squeegee with a smooth, soft rubber edge. (Or use crumpled-up black-and-white newspaper—avoid the color sections.) Dry a 1-inch (2.5 centimeter) strip at the top or side of each window and always start your squeegee there—starting on dry glass is one key to avoiding streaks. Don’t wash windows in direct sunlight, because quickly dried glass is more susceptible to streaking. Evenings or cloudy day sare the times for window washing.   
<br /><br />2. &quot;My blinds are dust magnets!&quot;
<br />Use an antistatic spray. To keep dust from piling up quickly, use an antistatic spray, such as Static Guard, on the window blinds right after you clean them.
<br /><br />3. &quot;There’s mildew on my window frames&quot;
<br />Wash with a bleach-detergent solution. Black or gray mildew spots on wooden frames can be cleaned for good with a solution of 2 ounces (60 milliliters) of household bleach and 1 ounce (30 milliliters)of laundry detergent in a quart of water. Wearing rubber gloves to protect your hands, sponge the solution on the spots, let it sit for ten minutes, and then rinse thoroughly with clean water.
<br /><br />4. &quot;My outside windowsills get dirty so quickly&quot;
<br />Apply a coat of floor wax. Because your exterior windows are exposed to the elements, they are subject to collecting a lot of dirt. But there is a simple way to keep your sills clean: Wipe on a coat of clear floor wax to protect them.

<br /><br />5. &quot;My shades are filthy&quot;
<br />Dust or wash the shades. Dust shades regularly with a soft cloth, a duster such as the Swiffer, or the dusting brush on your vacuum. (Be sure to dust both sides of the shades.) If they’re stained or spotted, it’s time for a real cleaning. Though you can wash them in place (with a drop cloth over the floor and furniture), it’s best to remove the shades. Place one shade at a time across a worktable covered with a plastic sheet or shower curtain. Wash vinyl shades using a sponge and a solution of 1?4 cup white vinegar in 1 quart (1 liter) of warm water. Washing them in the bathtub is even easier. Run some warm water in the tub, add a squirt of dishwashing liquid, and wipe each side with a large sponge. To rise, dunk them in clean water or hold them under the shower. Then wipe with a clean, soft cloth.Many fabric shades can also be washed, but take a close look at the care instructions before washing them. It’s best not to leave them in the water for more than a minute or so.
<br /><br />6. &quot;My windows get dirty too fast&quot;
<br />Change your heating and cooling system's filter. If the interior glass surface of your windows gets dirty unusually fast, you may need to change the filters on your furnace or air conditioner. Modern airtight homes trap more dust, pollen, dander, and other particles inside than ever before. Furnace and air-conditioner filters help trap that dirt and also extend the life of your appliances. Filters should be changed every month or two or anytime you can’t see light through the filter when you hold it up to a light.

<br /><br />7. &quot;Secondhand smoke is killing my windows&quot;
<br />Wash it with ammonia solution. To remove nicotine film or other grime from windows, you need ammonia. Mix 1 cup of lemon scented ammonia in 21?2 gallons (9.5 liters) of water and use this solution to clean the windows. The ammonia will cut through the grime, and the lemon scent will leave your house habitable.
<br /><br />8. &quot;My screens are filthy&quot;
<br />Remove and wash. The best way to clean window screens is to remove them from the window and wash them outside. Using abroad, soft-bristled brush, scrub both sides of the screens with warm to hot water and lemon-scented dishwashing detergent. Pick up the screen by its edges, hold it at an angle so most of the screen surface is facing the ground, and rap one edge lightly against a firm surface. This will shake loose any dirt. Rinse with a hose and air-dry thoroughly before reinstalling.

<br />In a sketch on &quot;Saturday Night Live,” Dennis Miller once said, “In view of all the deadly computer viruses that have been spreading lately, Weekend Update would like to remind you: When you link up to another computer, you're linking up to every computer that that computer has ever linked up to.” 
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/ninja.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />SNL humor aside, computer security -- and the spread of viruses -- are serious issues plaguing users. In April 2008, for example, the BBC reported that the number of computer viruses had escalated to more than 1 million. If there are a billion people active on the Internet worldwide, imagine the rate at which malicious malware could be developed and spread.
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/evileyes.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />Computer Safety
<br />According to a September Agence-France Presse report, hackers create around 57,000 scam websites every week in an effort to gain users’ sensitive information. As a result of dangers online, most users are aware that they need to protect their computers with security suites like McAfee and Norton, which provide anti-virus, anti-spyware protection and more.
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/scanner.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />One necessary protection is anti-virus software, which can detect whether your computer has been infiltrated with malicious infections. US-CERT (the U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness Team) defines it as a program that “scans files or your computer's memory for certain patterns that may indicate an infection. The patterns it looks for are based on the signatures, or definitions, of known viruses.” Most users are savvy enough to know that this is a ‘must’ for computer security -- but the important thing is to continually update your anti-virus program so it is looking for the latest threats.
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/yinyang.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />A firewall is also a must to ward off Internet attacks. Our resident tech expert “Sam,” who wishes to remain anonymous because of his job, once described a firewall as a doorman who stands outside your home (computer). It prevents unwanted users from just walking in to your home, and (with Windows 7 and Vista) checks that strangers that snuck into your home are allowed to leave. Basically, firewalls add an important layer of protection and prevent malicious access to your computer.
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/afro.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /> Another security measure you can take is to turn your computer off when you're not using it. Although a few techies, such as USA Today’s Kim Komando, recommend that you leave your computer on so that the operating system’s updates can continuously ward off new virus threats, most tech experts advise that it’s much safer to leave your computer turned off. 
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/fancy.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />Extra layer of protection
<br />Even taking these extra precautions doesn't always guarantee that you won't be at risk. One scenario is when you bank or shop online, and your sensitive information is vulnerable to potential access by hackers and identity thieves. Cybercriminals can sneak sophisticated software onto your computer to spy on your desktop activity. A program like SafeCentral, however, can help provide a secure online environment for you to bank or shop online, decreasing the worry that your personal and financial information would be compromised.
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/arrr.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />SafeCentral helps provide the necessary protection by blocking malicious malware and Trojans that may have somehow infiltrated your anti-virus program.

<br />To reduce your risk of cancer, look no further than your fridge. &amp;quot;All the studies on cancer and nutrition point to eating plant-based foods for their phytonutrients and other special compounds,&amp;quot; says Richard Béliveau, PhD, chair in the prevention and treatment of cancer at the University of Québec at Montreal and author of Foods to Fight Cancer.
<br /><br />Aim for five to nine daily servings of all kinds of fruits and vegetables—especially these six superstars.
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/biggrin.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />Broccoli
<br />All cruciferous veggies (think cauliflower, cabbage, kale) contain cancer-fighting properties, but broccoli is the only one with a sizable amount of sulforaphane, a particularly potent compound that boosts the body's protective enzymes and flushes out cancer-causing chemicals, says Jed Fahey, ScD. A recent University of Michigan study on mice found that sulforaphane also targets cancer stem cells—those that aid in tumor growth.
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/tongue.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />Helps fight: breast, liver, lung, prostate, skin, stomach, and bladder cancers
<br /><br />Your Rx: The more broccoli, the better, research suggests—so add it wherever you can, from salads to omelets to the top of your pizza.
<br /><br />Health.com: 13 easy pizza recipes
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/afro.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />Berries
<br />All berries are packed with cancer-fighting phytonutrients. But black raspberries, in particular, contain very high concentrations of phytochemicals called anthocyanins, which slow down the growth of premalignant cells and keep new blood vessels from forming (and potentially feeding a cancerous tumor), according to Gary D. Stoner, PhD, a professor of internal medicine at The Ohio State University College of Medicine.
<br /><br />Helps fight: colon, esophageal, oral, and skin cancers
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/fool.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />Your Rx: Stoner uses a concentrated berry powder in his studies but says a half-cup serving of berries a day may help your health, too.
<br /><br />Health.com: Go wild for berries!
<br /><br />Tomatoes
<br />This juicy fruit is the best dietary source of lycopene, a carotenoid that gives tomatoes their red hue, Béliveau says. And that's good news, because lycopene was found to stop endometrial cancer cell growth in a study in Nutrition and Cancer. Endometrial cancer causes nearly 8,000 deaths a year.
<br /><br />Helps fight: endometrial, lung, prostate, and stomach cancers
<br /><br />Your Rx: The biggest benefits come from cooked tomatoes (think pasta sauce!), since the heating process increases the amount of lycopene your body is able to absorb.
<br /><br />Health.com: 10 tasty tomato recipes
<br /><br />Walnuts
<br />Their phytosterols (cholesterol-like molecules found in plants) have been shown to block estrogen receptors in breast cancer cells, possibly slowing the cells' growth, says Elaine Hardman, PhD, associate professor at Marshall University School of Medicine in Huntington, West Virginia.
<br /><br />Helps fight: breast and prostate cancers
<br /><br />Your Rx: Munching on an ounce of walnuts a day may yield the best benefits, Hardman's research found.
<br /><br />Health.com: 8 super nuts
<br /><br />Garlic
<br />Phytochemicals in garlic have been found to halt the formation of nitrosamines, carcinogens formed in the stomach (and in the intestines, in certain conditions) when you consume nitrates, a common food preservative, Béliveau says. In fact, the Iowa Women's Health Study found that women with the highest amounts of garlic in their diets had a 50 percent lower risk of certain colon cancers than women who ate the least.
<br /><br />Helps fight: breast, colon, esophageal, and stomach cancers
<br /><br />Your Rx: Chop a clove of fresh, crushed garlic (crushing helps release beneficial enzymes), and sprinkle it into that lycopene-rich tomato sauce while it simmers.
<br /><br />Health.com: Surprising health benefits of garlic
<br /><br />Beans
<br />A study out of Michigan State University found that black and navy beans significantly reduced colon cancer incidence in rats, in part because a diet rich in the legumes increased levels of the fatty acid butyrate, which in high concentrations has protective effects against cancer growth. Another study, in the journal Crop Science, found dried beans particularly effective in preventing breast cancer in rats.
<br /><br />Helps fight: breast and colon cancers
<br /><br />Your Rx: Add a serving—a half-cup—of legumes a few times a week (either from a can or dry beans that've been soaked and cooked) to your usual rotation of greens or other veggies.

<br /><br />There are many unknown factors when it comes to retirement, especially if your proposed retirement date is a decade or more away. Though we can't predict the future, we can dispel some myths that make retirement planning seem more daunting than it really is. Here are ten retirement myths to look out for.
<br /><br />More from USNews.com: 
<br /><br />• Why the Retirement Age Is Increasing 
<br /><br />• 7 Costs to Eliminate Before You Retire
<br /><br />• 10 Tips for an Enjoyable Overseas Retirement 
<br /><br />1. You don't make enough money to save for retirement. This common excuse for not investing is true for some people, but it's a myth for many of the people who use it. The truth is that many people simply live beyond their means. If you want to save money for retirement, you need to make it a priority by including it in your budget and paying yourself first through payroll deductions or other automatic payments.
<br /><br />2. You need a large income to become wealthy. False. You need to consistently spend less than you earn and invest the difference to become wealthy. Even someone with a modest income can become a millionaire when they save diligently and invest wisely over a long period of time.
<br /><br />3. You will earn 11 percent in the stock market every year. The statement, &quot;Past performances do not guarantee future returns,&quot; is featured prominently on just about any investment prospectus. The stock market as a whole returned approximately 11 percent per year over the last 100 years or so, but those returns are not guaranteed. Just take a look at the market over the last two decades. Solid returns can be had, but it's a good idea to temper earnings expectations.
<br /><br />4. Your money is safer out of the market. The market took a beating over the last two years, and hasn't gained much over the last decade or two. But how much would you have made if you left your investments in an online savings account? Very little. A balanced portfolio is the best way for most people to diversify their investments and gives them the best opportunity for growing their wealth.
<br /><br />5. You can do better by investing on your own. Very few people, including professional money managers, are able to consistently beat the market by investing in individual stocks or other investments. Most investors are better off investing in index funds or mutual funds as part of an overall balanced portfolio.
<br /><br />6. You need to be debt free before you can invest for retirement. This would be true in an ideal world, but most of us live in the real world. Focus on eliminating your high interest debt first, such as credit cards or personal loans. Then invest at least enough to get a company match on your 401(k), while continuing to work on repaying your remaining debt. Increase your investment contributions when you eliminate your remaining debts.
<br /><br />7. A 401(k) is the best place to invest for retirement. Many 401(k) plans have higher fees and fewer investment options than you can find by opening an IRA. That isn't to say 401(k) plans are bad. They offer great tax advantages and an easy way to invest for retirement. It is usually best to invest enough to receive any matching contributions from your employer, then work on maxing out your IRA contributions. If you have additional funds to invest for retirement after you max out your IRA, then work on maxing out your 401(k) contributions.
<br /><br />8. Social Security benefits will be enough to retire on. Probably not. Social Security was never designed to support someone for the duration of their retirement. The program was designed to supplement a retiree's pension or other retirement savings. Social Security benefits should still be around when you retire, but don't count on them being enough to cover all of your retirement expenses. Here are some tips on how to maximize Social Security benefits.
<br /><br />9. You have to retire at age ___. I'll let you fill in the blank. 55? 65? 72? Now I'll ask you, Why do you need to retire at a certain age? This myth exists because many retirees had to wait until a certain age to receive benefits from Social Security or a pension plan. The truth is that unless you work in an industry that has age limits, you should retire when you feel ready and can afford to do so.
<br /><br />10. You won't ever be able to afford to retire. Retirement isn't a dream and it isn't a destination. It's a journey that most people can achieve through hard work and dedication. If you are a long way off, start planning now. If you are close to retirement but don't think it is achievable, then rethink your definition of retirement. Perhaps you can work a few more years before retiring or work part-time in retirement.

<br /><br />While most career advice focuses on how to succeed, we can all learn valuable lessons by dissecting career failure as well. Workplace experts offer insights into some of the top ways workers undermine their own careers and jeopardize their career development. 
<br />1. Not Taking Your Education Seriously
<br />If you party too much in college and end up with a run-of-the-mill 2.5 GPA, you'll be passed over for the best entry-level jobs, says New York City-based executive recruiter and coach Brian Drum, of Drum Associates. Not finishing your master's degree is another way to hurt your career-development goals, adds Anne Angerman, a career coach with Denver-based Career Matters.
<br /><br />2. Not Having a Plan
<br />In the current poor job market, you may have defaulted into a career you aren't crazy about. That's OK, as long as you develop career plans to get where you want to be. &quot;Think of every job you take as a stepping-stone to your next job,&quot; Drum advises.
<br /><br />3. Lying
<br />You'll lose professional credibility in a hurry if you lie, from exaggerating on your resume to getting caught fibbing on Facebook. &quot;If someone calls in sick to work and then that evening posts a photo on Facebook of their extra day vacationing in Cabo San Lucas, that's a big problem,&quot; says corporate etiquette specialist Diane Gottsman of the Protocol School of Texas in San Antonio.
<br /><br />4. Sullying Your Reputation on Facebook or Twitter
<br />Social media can harm your reputation in other ways, too. Personal posts and tweets from work--when you're supposed to be doing your job--can tag you as a slacker. And the content of your posts or tweets can come back to haunt you as well--you never know who might stumble upon those bachelor-party photos. &quot;You need to assume that every boss and potential employer knows how to use Facebook, Twitter, and MySpace, and post from the standpoint that everyone is watching--even if in reality they're not,&quot; Gottsman says. 
<br /><br />5. Not Respecting Professional Boundaries
<br />Sharing TMI about your personal life with colleagues is unprofessional. &quot;Your coworkers don't want to hear about your fights with your husband,&quot; Angerman says. On the other hand, if you're ultraprivate and work with a chatty group, join the conversations occasionally so coworkers don't resent you. 
<br /><br />6. Gossiping, Slandering, and Excessively Criticizing
<br />If you publicly bash fellow employees, the boss, the board of directors, or even your competitors, you'll be perceived as negative at best and a troublemaker at worst. The ramifications can be broad and long-term, Gottsman says. &quot;Industries are tight,&quot; she says. &quot;You don't want to be the one who started that rumor about the head of your industry.&quot; As far as bad-mouthing competitors--what if your company merges with a competitor, or you want to work for one someday? 
<br /><br />7. Carrying on an Inappropriate Relationship with Your Boss|
<br />Never a good idea, but an especially bad one if your boss is married. &quot;When you get involved in a drama or in something unethical that can be brought out in the open, you're asking for trouble,&quot; Gottsman says.
<br /><br />8. Not Controlling Your Alcohol Intake or Libido
<br />Getting drunk at the office party or on a business trip damages your credibility. Ditto a romantic, ahem, &quot;indiscretion&quot; that your colleagues know about.
<br /><br />9. Job-Hopping Just for the Money
<br />Job-hopping--in moderation--may not automatically disqualify you from a position. &quot;But it gets to the point--like if you have seven or eight jobs by the time you're 35--that employers are not going to want to invest in you,&quot; Drum says. Also, if you have leadership aspirations, keep in mind that the top dogs of many large corporations have been with those organizations for long periods, he says. Additionally, many companies have &quot;last in, first out&quot; layoff policies, which could leave you out of a job if you never stick around long enough to build tenure anywhere.
<br /><br />10. Losing Touch with References
<br />You'll kick yourself later if you leave a job without collecting personal contact information from colleagues who can serve as professional references for you in the future. &quot;If you were forced to leave a job and you can't ask your boss for a reference, hopefully you've built up some rapport with a colleague and can ask them,&quot; Angerman says.
<br /><br />11. Leaving a Job on Bad Terms
<br />Don't become a lame duck when you've got one foot out the door, Drum says. &quot;The employer only remembers about the last five minutes you were there,&quot; he says. Give proper notice and don't leave a mess behind. And by all means, do not make a huge dramatic production of it when you quit, complete with cursing, slandering, and throwing things, Gottsman advises. &quot;It's very difficult to get another job when you've left destruction in your wake,&quot; she says.

<br />Learn how you hold the key to launching your own career comeback.
<br />By Chris Kyle
<br /><br />Did 2010 hit you hard professionally? Take heart...you may actually be in good company.
<br /><br />Author J.K. Rowling wrote the first Harry Potter novel as a struggling single mom. Even the great Michael Jordan was cut from his high school basketball team as a sophomore. 
<br /><br />What's the lesson here? Everyone can make a comeback. 
<br /><br />[Start training for your career comeback. Find the right school now.]
<br /><br />If your current employment situation isn't ideal, the timing may be right to turn things around.
<br /><br />&amp;quot;I've listed more jobs in the last 30 days than I have in the last two years,&amp;quot; says Coy Renick, a corporate recruiter in Roanoke, Virginia. &amp;quot;Companies have confidence that it's time to start doing some hiring now that there is a better balance of power in Washington, D.C.&amp;quot;
<br /><br />Check out these three career fields that can position you for your career comeback.
<br /><br />Comeback Career #1 - Business
<br />Bob Kelleher, an HR expert for Monster.com, expects businesses to staff up again in 2011. &amp;quot;I am very optimistic that companies will start hiring so they can increase revenue and supplies,&amp;quot; says Kelleher.
<br /><br />Comeback Keys: Looking at the bigger picture, Colorado State University's Martin Shields is optimistic because the gross domestic product - the value of all goods and services produced nationwide - has improved for four straight quarters. 
<br /><br />If you've been applying for jobs in the business world without much success in 2010, don't despair. 
<br /><br />&amp;quot;Stay positive and talk enthusiastically about the skills you do have,&amp;quot; says Renick, adding that a temporary or contract position is a great way to get your foot in the door.
<br /><br />Training: With companies looking to hire again, make sure your resume is up to date. Taking classes and earning a business certificate or degree is a great way to stay current. Getting an MBA will help for senior-level positions. Freelance consulting gigs are another great way to fill gaps on your resume.

<br /><br />Comeback Career #2 - Health Care
<br />With regards to job growth, the health care industry is the biggest and fastest growing sector of the economy, according to the U.S. Department of Labor.
<br /><br />Comeback Keys: The American Society for Clinical Pathology says there is a &amp;quot;serious shortage&amp;quot; of laboratory personnel in the United States, making qualified job applicants well-positioned for success in 2011. What's more, jobs like medical assistant, nurse, and phlebotomist are impossible to outsource. 
<br /><br />Upward mobility is another plus for the health care profession.
<br /><br />&amp;quot;A good number of my phlebotomists have worked full time for us and have taken advantage of tuition reimbursement,&amp;quot; Newton Memorial Hospital's Ruth Pollison told the Philadelphia Inquirer. &amp;quot;They've gone on to become nurses, lab technologists or radiologic technologists.&amp;quot;
<br /><br />Training: Quick training programs, whether it's a certificate or associate's degree, can qualify you for many medical positions. If you start now, you might be ready to start work in 2011! [Search for Nursing and Medical training programs now]

<br /><br />Comeback Career #3 - Legal
<br />According to staffing firm Robert Half International, the legal industry is expected to see the strongest hiring activity in the fourth quarter of 2010, setting up a rosy outlook for occupations like court reporters and paralegals well into 2011.
<br /><br />Comeback Keys: Paralegals, long an indispensable part of a legal team, will see &amp;quot;much faster than average&amp;quot; job growth through 2018, according to the Department of Labor. Since paralegals perform many of the same tasks as lawyers, yet don't earn as lofty salaries, job security is another real strength.
<br /><br />Training: Becoming a paralegal or court reporter can be a quick career transition for many professionals, particularly if you already have a bachelor's. Certificate programs can last just six months. [Find Paralegal schools near you]

<br />You've been losing every fight
<br />Your hope is feeling broken
<br />You're feet are rough, they're scraped and bruised
<br />But still have strength to take you through,
<br />Into,
<br />The dawn
<br />(Chorus)
<br />Just close your eyes
<br />And push right through
<br />I know it's tough right now
<br />This was meant for you
<br />When the clouds are gone
<br />Not a shadow in sight
<br />You'll be drenched in the sun

<br /><br />At the beach, the waves will crash
<br />Tuck and grab and pull you back
<br />The sun may, be covered in gray
<br />The sand will itch, itself may burn
<br />Hurricane will take it's turn
<br />Until,
<br />The dawn
<br /><br />(Chorus)
<br />Just close your eyes
<br />And push right through
<br />I know it's tough right now
<br />This was meant for you
<br />When the clouds are gone
<br />Not a storm insight
<br />You'll be drenched in the sun
<br />With open eyes
<br /><br />(X2)So close your eyes, shut them tight
<br />Let it be, and it will fade away (fade away)
<br />Push on though the strength in you
<br />Let it be, and wish it all away (all away)
<br /><br />With open eyes,
<br />Open wide,
<br />It's all good now, watch it fade away,
<br />Day by day
<br /><br />Just close your eyes
<br />And push right through
<br />I know it's tough right now
<br />This was meant for you
<br />When the clouds are gone
<br />Not a storm insight
<br />You'll be drenched in the sun
<br />With open eyes.
