<br /><br />His friend takes my hand; looks me in the eyes 
<br />Daddys creeping up my nightie; cold hands 
<br />I try to pull his hand away; 
<br />their grip is strong! 
<br />They look at one another; nod; something planned 
<br /><br />I feel my palms sweat; Daddys under my knickers 
<br />&quot;Daddy im going to bed! Night&quot; Pulling again 
<br />But there grip is to strong for weak me 
<br />I look at both; and ask, who are these men? 
<br /><br />His fingers going up me; pulling away 
<br />His friend leans forward; a kiss? Why? 
<br />His toungue moving mine; my eyes squint 
<br />Lean back and away; &quot;Why are you doing this?&quot; 
<br />No answer, i feel the pain inside me; him 
<br />Chucks the quilt on the floor; me to

<br />&quot;O Daddy please, i love you&quot; 
<br /><br />His friend; pulling at my nightie 
<br />And my Dad pulling my pants down 
<br />His friend pinning my hands to the floor 
<br />As my Dad lies himself on the ground 
<br /><br />I squirm; as Daddy friend pulls me up 
<br />And places me ontop of Daddy; thrusts within 
<br />I cry; i bite; i scratch; i slap; i fail

<br />I can feel the blood seep down my leg 
<br />&quot;Daddy your hurting me please&quot; 
<br />I plead to him and his friend; not even a beg 
<br /><br />Daddys laughing; why does he laugh? 
<br />His friend shoves himself in my mouth and moans 
<br />Tieing my hands together; moving in and out 
<br />&quot;Ride me Jessy&quot; He laughs and groans 
<br /><br />They smile at one another; laugh to 
<br />They roll me over and spread me wide well 
<br />My daddy sits on my face; himself in again 
<br />While his friend talks and pushes himself inside 
<br /><br />I can hardly breathe; i gag for air 
<br />I cough and splutter; cry and weep 
<br />I beg and plead; but its no use 
<br />Theyve already made me hurt and bleed 
<br /><br />I stare into his eyes; that look upon me 
<br />This is not my Dad; where is he? 
<br />If he was still here; would he care 
<br />Would he actually even; see? 
<br /><br />Finally they get of and lie me on the sofa 
<br />My cheeks blouchy from tears and pain 
<br />They play with them selfs; all over me 
<br />Rub it in; making me feel the shame 
<br /><br />&quot;Why Daddy? Please tell me why?&quot; 
<br />Dad looks at his friend; and waves him away 
<br />&quot;Jessy i love you&quot; he smiles and kisses my cheek 
<br />&quot;Is that all you have in your heart to say?&quot; 
<br /><br />He puts my nightie on me 
<br />he walks me to my bedroom door 
<br />Ever since that night; His friend 
<br />And himself every Friday come back for more 
<br /><br />&quot;Night sweet Girl; You are my life&quot; 
<br />Closing the door, tears still down my face 
<br />Still the smell of him and his friend 
<br />Fade into me like disgrace 
<br /><br />I watch the Moon go down; the sun come up 
<br />&quot;Jessy its school&quot; Knocking at my door 
<br />I cant help but cry; weep in pain 
<br />Because im so scared he wanted more 
<br /><br />But one night daddy took it too far 
<br />Daddy and his friend came back for one last shot 
<br />They were worried they would get caught 
<br />So he and his friend took me to a cemetary lot 
<br /><br />I was blindfolded and my hands were tied back 
<br />&quot;Daddy please!! Not tonight!&quot; 
<br />Daddy and his friend both had their last fun 
<br />After that i tried to put up a fight 
<br /><br />I begged daddy &quot;Please no more!&quot; 
<br />All he could say &quot;Shut up, you stupid Bitch!&quot; 
<br />Daddy unblindfolded me at last 
<br />He said I love you so much 
<br /><br />He went back into the car and pulled out a bat 
<br />&quot;Daddy I swear I wont say a thing!!!!&quot;

<br />Before Sidekicks &amp; iPods . . .
<br />Before Panic at the Disco . . .
<br />Before PlayStation2 or X-BOX . . .
