<br />By Sara Webb
<br /><br />JAKARTA, July 17 (Reuters) - Bomb blasts ripped through the JW Marriott and Ritz-Carlton hotels in Jakarta's business district on Friday, killing nine people and wounding dozens in attacks that could dent investor confidence in Indonesia.
<br /><br />A car bomb also blew up along a toll road in North Jakarta, police said without giving further details. Indonesia's Metro TV said two people had been killed. An unexploded bomb was also later found at the Marriott, police said.
<br /><br />The apparently coordinated bombings are the first in several years and follow a period in which the government had made progress in tackling security threats from militant Islamic groups, bringing a sense of political stability to Southeast Asia's biggest economy. [ID:nSP522493] [ID:nJAK540820]
<br /><br />Some analysts have already cast suspicion on remnants of the Jemaah Islamiah group, blamed for previous attacks including a car bombing outside the Marriott in 2003 as well as bombings on the resort island of Bali the previous year that killed 202 people.
<br /><br />Here are some questions and answers on security in Indonesia: IS THIS UNEXPECTED?
<br /><br />Yes. Indonesia had made enormous progress in containing the threat from militant group JI which security officials and analysts said was behind several fatal bomb attacks on Western targets including hotels and bars in Jakarta and the resort island of Bali.
<br /><br />The Indonesian authorities, with help and training from their Australian and U.S. counterparts, have increased security and surveillance in recent years.
<br /><br />Indonesia's security forces have detained hundreds of militants and killed several during shoot-outs, carrying out numerous sweeps, even in recent weeks. [ID:nJAK52197]
<br /><br />HOW COULD THESE NEW ATTACKS HAPPEN, HAS SECURITY BEEN RELAXED?
<br /><br />There are no outward signs security measures have been relaxed in Jakarta. The security presence was stepped up around the time of the presidential elections on July 8, which passed peacefully.
<br /><br />All the major hotels in Jakarta have security checks outside to reduce the risk of car bombs, although checks in many are not particularly thorough, with a security guard just poking his head in the window to look at who is inside the car.
<br /><br />Although the Marriott and Ritz were known for exceptionally tight security barriers and checks, including for those entering the hotel on foot, from the damage at the scene of the blasts it appears the bombs exploded inside the hotels, and were either brought in by suicide bombers or planted inside and set off by timers.
<br /><br />IS JEMAAH ISLAMIAH BEHIND THIS?
<br /><br />Several analysts are already saying these attacks have some of the hallmarks of JI, which in the past has chosen high-profile targets such as Western hotels and bars frequented by foreigners.
<br /><br />JI has used car bombs in the past, but barricades and layout changes as well as other measures at the best-protected luxury and Western hotels in Jakarta and Bali have made it harder for that kind of attack.

<br /><br />Several analysts are already saying these attacks have some of the hallmarks of JI, which in the past has chosen high-profile targets such as Western hotels and bars frequented by foreigners.
<br /><br />JI has used car bombs in the past, but barricades and layout changes as well as other measures at the best-protected luxury and Western hotels in Jakarta and Bali have made it harder for that kind of attack.
<br /><br />DOES THIS MEAN JI HAS RECOVERED AND IS A THREAT AGAIN?
<br /><br />If it is indeed JI, this suggests they still have bomb-making capability and operatives, despite having lost many of their trained and skilled members.
<br /><br />IF IT ISN'T JI, WHO ELSE COULD IT BE?
<br /><br />In 1998, when former autocratic President Suharto was desperately trying to retain power, some elements within the military were accused of stirring up social unrest and riots in an attempt to cause widespread panic and destabilise Indonesia.
<br /><br />There have been other instances in Indonesia's history when military elements were suspected of being behind unrest in order to have an excuse to clamp down on civilians.
<br /><br />The country has also sporadically seen violence including bombings attributed to various separatist groups, political organisations, and criminal gangs. WHAT LONG-TERM IMPACT COULD THIS HAVE ON INDONESIA?
<br /><br />It's certainly a blow for Indonesia's security forces and the country's risk profile, particularly coming so close on the heels of peaceful elections in the world's third-largest democracy.
<br /><br />Indonesia had begun to stand out among its Southeast Asian peers as a stable democracy that was making real progress in tackling corruption in order to attract foreign investment.
<br /><br />These attacks could make some investors think twice before committing to any new, long-term, strategic investments in areas such as natural resources or infrastructure.
<br /><br />That said, however, the market reaction has been relatively muted.

<br />Illustrated London News, 22 December 1849.
<br />(source: Views of the Famine)
<br />The Great Famine would rage over Ireland for four years, but its impact is still noticeable. The most obvious outcome of these years appears when the census of 1841 is compared with the census of 1851.
<br /><br />According to the 1841 census 8,175,124 people lived in Ireland. This figure is flattering because it only includes people living in some sort of human worthy structure. A mud cabin without windows, the lowest class of housing included, was home for 45% of the population. People living in so-called scalps, a hole in the earth covered with twigs and turf, and scalpeens, almost similar to a scalp but with a loftier roof and slightly larger dimensions, were not counted, neither were the homeless. It is estimated that approximately one million people were not included in the census, consequently the actual population of Ireland in 1841 was probably just over the nine million.
<br /><br />The census of 1851 counted 6,522,285 people. Judging by the official figures the population of Ireland had decreased with 20% in just one decade. Because it is likely that the group which was not included in the census was more vulnerable for both starvation as diseases this 20% is the absolute minimum. The accurate figure is guesswork but estimations are between the 25% and 30%.

<br /><br />voteWoodworking is a fascinating hobby. Who doesn't love the look of wood products? But it 
<br /><br />can be a daunting task when you first get started. Here are some tips to kick-start your 
<br /><br />woodworking hobby.
<br />Start small. While we all love hand-finished oak paneling, it's best to start with a simple 
<br /><br />project, like a napkin holder or door stop. This will give you a chance to learn about 
<br /><br />working with wood. Go online to search for easy woodworking projects. They will tell you all 
<br /><br />you need to know.
<br /><br />Really good projects will not only talk you through the projects step-by-step, they will also 
<br /><br />teach you terminology and techniques as you go. Just be sure you read and understand all 
<br /><br />instructions carefully and have all the materials on hand before you start. Also be sure you 
<br /><br />know how to use the equipment. Read the instructions and even mime them out before you start 
<br /><br />work. If something doesn't make sense to you, ask for help. 
<br /><br />Once you get started, you will be pleased at how easy woodworking plans are to follow. For 
<br /><br />the most part, you simply insert this tab into that slot. You may have to do some sanding in 
<br /><br />between to make sure the pieces fit but most projects are readily understandable.
<br /><br />As you complete your first projects, you will get excited and ready for more advanced work. 
<br /><br />Why not take a class at your local community college or at a home improvement store to learn 
<br /><br />how to enhance your skills. Think about what kind of woodworking project you would like to 
<br /><br />do. While you may not have the time, money or skills to do the project of your dreams right 
<br /><br />now, over time you can save your money and learn the skills so you can do it eventually. 
<br /><br />Woodworking is great in that you can learn by doing. Practice really does make perfect.
<br /><br />As you learn more techniques, you will be able to add your own style to projects. You will be 
<br /><br />able to combine multiple plans to incorporate the look of several of them. For example, use 
<br /><br />the scrollwork on one pattern to enhance the basic shape of another pattern. The result will 
<br /><br />be a one-of-a-kind piece that anyone would be proud to own.
<br /><br />As with any craft, the more you advance, the more people will value your work. You may enjoy 
<br /><br />woodworking so much, you will be able to sell your creations online or at local craft shows. 
<br /><br />It is very gratifying as people stop to admire your work. You may make eventually make enough 
<br /><br />money to pay for all those tools you bought. But don't let that be your goal. Get into 
<br /><br />woodworking to enjoy this age-old hobby. The money will come later.

Clinical education comprises nearly one-

<br /><br />graduates and FT practitioners. The purpose of this study was to describe PT students' and clinical instructors' perspectives of educational factors that may 
<br /><br />promote students' deep-learning approaches during CE experiences. 
<br />Subjects. Participants of this study were 10 PT students who had completed an intermediate, 5-week, full-time CE experience and 9 clinical instructors (CIs) 
<br /><br />identified as learner-centered in their teaching orientations. 
<br />Methods. Data &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.christian-louboutin-shoes.cc%2FChristian_Louboutin_Sandals.html%26quot%3B%26gt%3BChristian"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.christian-louboutin-shoes.cc/Christian_Louboutin_Sandals.html&quot;&gt;Christian</a> Louboutin Sandals&lt;/a&gt;  were collected through 
<br /><br />individual, semistructured interviews in which participants were asked to define and describe factors that promoted student learning during CE experiences. 
<br /><br />Constant comparative qualitative methods were used to analyze and interpret interview data using concept maps for both the students and CIs. 
<br />Results. Three major themes emerged. First, challenging patient interactions promoted student learning. Patients, especially complex patients, provided 
<br /><br />students a rich context to apply their academic knowledge and skills. Second, the CI and clinical learning environment facilitated deep-learning approaches 
<br /><br />by providing a supportive, varied environment in which students felt safe to ask and respond to questions, make mistakes, and encounter additional learning 
<br /><br />opportunities. Last, students were able to construct individual frameworks of patient care in a deep manner when they were actively engaged in doing and 
<br /><br />reflecting, making links &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.christian-louboutin-shoes.cc%26quot%3B%26gt%3Bchristian"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.christian-louboutin-shoes.cc&quot;&gt;christian</a> louboutin&lt;/a&gt; between past and current learning experiences, seeing the 
<br /><br />whole picture, and self-assessing and directing their learning toward areas needing development. Students and CIs reported that heavy workloads, the fast 
<br /><br />work pace, and limited time for reflection interfered with deep-learning approaches. 
<br />Discussion and Conclusion. PT students and educators can use the study findings to promote deep learning during students' professional education to better 
<br /><br />prepare graduates for the challenges of today's health care environment.

<br /><br />tomatoes, yellow squash and onions are my 3 favorites.  Alas the garden is a complete washout, quite literally due to the rain we have had for the last 50 
<br /><br />years in a row <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/4210//smilies/sad.gif" alt=":)" />  These 3 little gems make for a wonderful, colorful and flavorful sauté.  You can serve the sauté in a variety of ways.  I love to &lt;a 
<br /><br />href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.christian-louboutin-shoes.cc%26quot%3B%26gt%3Bchristian"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.christian-louboutin-shoes.cc&quot;&gt;christian</a> louboutin&lt;/a&gt;

Add 
<br /><br />chicken strips to the sauté and you have a light yet filling meal. For your little one who can handle lumps, bumps and texture, grab a potato masher and 
<br /><br />smoosh the veggies up a bit prior to serving.  This is great for spoon practice and if you don’t mind the mess, it’s a wonderful finger food meal too!
<br /><br />2 yellow squash
<br />1 small sweet onion

Slice and dice the squash and tomatoes to suit your &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.christian-louboutin-shoes.cc%2FChristian_Louboutin_Sandals.html%26quot%3B%26gt%3BChristian"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.christian-louboutin-shoes.cc/Christian_Louboutin_Sandals.html&quot;&gt;Christian</a> 
<br /><br />Louboutin Sandals&lt;/a&gt;  preference.  I prefer to make chunky dices as opposed to round slices for a more “meaty” feel.  Chop the onions in bite sized dices 
<br /><br />or in fine smaller dices for your little one.
<br /><br />Heat the EVOO &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.christian-louboutin-shoes.cc%2FChristian_Louboutin_Sandals.html%26quot%3B%26gt%3BChristian"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.christian-louboutin-shoes.cc/Christian_Louboutin_Sandals.html&quot;&gt;Christian</a> Louboutin Sandals&lt;/a&gt;  and minced garlic in a 
<br /><br />frying pan.  When the garlic starts to sizzle, toss in the onion and &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.jimmy-choo-shoes.com%26quot%3B%26gt%3Bjimmy"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.jimmy-choo-shoes.com&quot;&gt;jimmy</a> choo shoes&lt;/a&gt; sauté until soft and 
<br /><br />translucent.  Next add the squash, tomatoes and the spices.  Sauté until the texture you prefer has been achieved.  I take half of the mix out of the pan 
<br /><br />when everything is al dente and proceed to sauté the life out of the remaining portion.  My kiddos prefer soft, squishy and lifeless  
<br /><br />Once everything is cooked, serve over brown rice, quinoa or buckwheat.  If you will be adding chicken, add thinly sliced and diced pieces of chicken breast 
<br /><br />meat at the same time you add the onions.  When chicken is no longer pink, add the rest of the ingredients.

<br /><br />1. Invite Comments - I notice that when I specifically invite comments that people leave them in higher numbers than when I don’t. To some degree this 
<br /><br />confuses me as most of my readers know that they &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.christian-louboutin-shoes.cc%26quot%3B%26gt%3Bchristian"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.christian-louboutin-shoes.cc&quot;&gt;christian</a> louboutin shoes&lt;/a&gt; can leave comments on any 
<br /><br />post - but I guess inviting a comment triggers a response &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.christian-louboutin-shoes.cc%2FChristian_Louboutin_Evening.html%26quot%3B%26gt%3BChristian"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.christian-louboutin-shoes.cc/Christian_Louboutin_Evening.html&quot;&gt;Christian</a> 
<br /><br />Louboutin Evening&lt;/a&gt;  to some extent. Also keep in mind that new readers that are unfamiliar with blogging don’t always know about comments or how to use 
<br /><br />them - invitations to participate in well laid out and easy to use comments systems are good for helping them participate. 
<br /><br />2. Ask &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.christian-louboutin-shoes.cc%26quot%3B%26gt%3Bchristian"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.christian-louboutin-shoes.cc&quot;&gt;christian</a> louboutin&lt;/a&gt;
<br /> Questions - Including specific questions in posts definitely helps get higher numbers of comments. I find that when I include questions in my headings that 
<br /><br />it is a particularly effective way of getting a response from readers as you set a question in their mind from the first moments of your post. 
<br /><br />3. Be Open &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.christian-louboutin-shoes.cc%2Fchristian_louboutin_pumps.html%26quot%3B%26gt%3Bchristian"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.christian-louboutin-shoes.cc/christian_louboutin_pumps.html&quot;&gt;christian</a> louboutin pumps&lt;/a&gt;  Ended - If you say everything 
<br /><br />there is to say on a topic you’re less likely to get others adding their opinions because you’ll have covered what they might have added. While you don’t 
<br /><br />want to purposely leave too many things unsaid there is an art to writing open ended posts that leaves room for your readers to be experts also. 
<br /><br />4. Interact with comments left - If you’re not willing to use your own comments section why would your readers? If someone leaves a comment interact with 
<br /><br />them. This gets harder as your blog grows &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.christian-louboutin-shoes.cc%2FChristian_Louboutin_Sandals.html%26quot%3B%26gt%3BChristian"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.christian-louboutin-shoes.cc/Christian_Louboutin_Sandals.html&quot;&gt;Christian</a> Louboutin Sandals&lt;/a&gt; 
<br /><br />but it’s particularly important in the early days of your blog as it shows your readers that their comments are valued, it creates a culture of 
<br /><br />interactivity and gives the impression &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.jimmy-choo-shoes.com%26quot%3B%26gt%3Bjimmy"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.jimmy-choo-shoes.com&quot;&gt;jimmy</a> choo&lt;/a&gt; to other readers that your comments section is an active 
<br /><br />place that you as the blogger value. As the activity in your comments section grows you may find you need to be slightly less active in it as readers will 
<br /><br />start to take over on answering questions and creating community - however don’t completely ignore your comment threads. 
<br /><br />6. Be humble - I find that readers respond very well to posts that show your own weaknesses, failings and the gaps in your own knowledge rather than those 
<br /><br />posts where you come across as knowing everything  &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.jimmy-choo-shoes.com%2FJimmy_Choo_Sandals.html%26quot%3B%26gt%3BJimmy"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.jimmy-choo-shoes.com/Jimmy_Choo_Sandals.html&quot;&gt;Jimmy</a> Choo Sandals&lt;/a&gt;there is to know 
<br /><br />on a topic. People are attracted to humility and are more likely to respond to it than a post written in a tone of someone who might harshly respond to their 
<br /><br />comments. 
<br /><br />7. Be gracious - Related to humility is grace. There are times where you as the blogger will get something wrong in your posts. It might be spelling or 
<br /><br />grammar, it could be the crux of your argument or some other aspect of your blogging. When a someone leaves a comment that shows your failing it’s very easy 
<br /><br />to respond harshly in a defensive manner. We’ve all seen the flaming that can ensue. While it’s not easy - a graceful approach to comments where you admit 
<br /><br />where you are wrong and others is right can bring out the lurkers and make them feel a little safer in leaving comments. 
<br /><br />8. Be controversial? - I put a question mark after this one because it doesn’t always work (and I personally  &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.christian-louboutin-"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.christian-louboutin-</a>
<br /><br />shoes.cc/Christian_Louboutin_Wedges.html&quot;&gt;Christian Louboutin Wedges&lt;/a&gt; avoid it as much as I can these days) - but there’s nothing like controversy to get 
<br /><br />people commenting on your blog. Of course with controversy comes other consequences - one of which is the risk of putting off less vocal members of your 
<br /><br />readership. 
<br /><br />9. ‘Reward’ Comments - There are many ways of acknowledging and ‘rewarding’ good comments that range &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.jimmy-choo-shoes.com%26quot%3B%26gt%3Bjimmy"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.jimmy-choo-shoes.com&quot;&gt;jimmy</a> choo 
<br /><br />shoes&lt;/a&gt; from simply including a ‘good comment’ remark through to highlighting them in other posts that you write. Drawing attention to your readers who 
<br /><br />use comments well affirms them but also draws attention of other readers to good use of your comments section. 
<br /><br />10. Make it Easy to Comment - I leave a lot of comments on a lot of blogs each week - but there is one situation where I rarely leave a comment - even if the 
<br /><br />post deserves it - blogs that require me to login before making a comment. Maybe I’m lazy (actually there’s no maybe about it) or &lt;a 
<br /><br />href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.jimmy-choo-shoes.com%26quot%3B%26gt%3Bjimmy"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.jimmy-choo-shoes.com&quot;&gt;jimmy</a> choo sale&lt;/a&gt;
<br /> maybe there’s something inside me that worries about giving out my personal details - but when I see a comments section that requires registration I almost 
<br /><br />always (95% or more of the time) leave the blog without leaving the comment that I want to make. While I totally understand the temptation to require 
<br /><br />registration for comments (combatting spam in most cases) something inside me resists participating in such comments sections. Registration is a hurdle you 
<br /><br />put in front of your readers that some will be willing to leap but that others will balk at (the same is often said about other comments section requirements 
<br /><br />that go beyond the basics). Keep your comments section as simple and as easy to use as possible.
