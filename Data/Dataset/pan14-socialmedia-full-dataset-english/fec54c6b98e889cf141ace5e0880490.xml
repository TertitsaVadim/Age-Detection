<br />Come to sleep and dreams in time. 
<br />Where singles take A simple lead. 
<br />Feet will follow until they bleed. 
<br />Black and broken grey turns white. 
<br />Shattered mirror! 
<br />No picture bright!
<br />All a mix Of this dark night. 
<br />Like this dream thats filled with 
<br />fright. 
<br /><br />Captivation 
<br />I Feel her charm. 
<br />Pulls and grips with deadly harm. 
<br />Magic love not of another. 
<br />hates cold with greed and angered brothers. 
<br />All theses teeth that are digging in. The deeper they go the deeper the sin.
<br />Then a break I hear the call 
<br />Of morning wake the fear it falls.
<br /><br />Open my eyes to see the light. 
<br />I find my fears out of sight. 
<br />What was this for me to feel? 
<br />Just a nightmare and nothing real.

<br />clearly you can see are home aint built out of stone
<br />and we dont need the trouble problams or dispare
<br />of you taking one of us away it really aint fair
<br />truth be told thats really just life 
<br />we argue everyday just to avoid a fight 
<br />we make are paths and pave are roads
<br />we go to the end find it closed
<br />there no way back and you want to escape
<br />forget your life forget today 
<br />heads hung low lost all hope
<br />reach for the bottle as a way to cope
<br />reach for the weed as a way to float
<br />and reach for the gun as a way of hope 
<br />problamatic 
<br />life is traggic 
<br />thats why most people say weve had it
<br />thats easy come easy go 
<br />but easys hard for most to hold 
<br />till they ask whats left 
<br />why are we still living
<br />the answer to that 
<br />is one thats still missen

<br />But everyone know you’re the man to be sedative 
<br />With pills popping out your pocket and powder up your noise
<br />Hindered bucks down just to feel some flows
<br /><br />So how do you like this? 
<br />How do you know? 
<br />What happens next when your body doesn’t know? 
<br />What happen when you run all out them pill?
<br />U breaks some rules to get the cash refilled 
<br />Now back to the deal even though he won’t supply ya 
<br />Cause all days has been sitting there just trying to get higher
<br />But you already conspired a plan to deprive him
<br />Of everything thing he has including his life son
<br /> Boom bust smash bang 
<br />Security comes running with their glock on aim 
<br />So you start running with your legs on spring
<br />Bullets whizzing past you there looking for your brain 
<br /><br />This is how the thug life goes 
<br />It’s dealing in crime or dealing in a hole
<br />That’s living it large or living in a prison 
<br />Then riding in a hurse not going to the big man
<br />Do you hear what saying?  
<br /><br />Royal thief’s no we don’t quit
<br />Royal thief’s ya we Hit quit
<br />Royal thief’s we don’t quit
<br />Ya we don’t quit 
<br />We wont quit
<br />(This how we Rollin bitch)
<br /><br />Walking around with my glock on my hip 
<br />When Mr. police says I gotta quit
<br />Then reaches for his berretta so I empty my clip
<br />He should of known that we don’t quit
<br />Keep walking and I hear the siren 
<br />Homie whips around the corner stops and says dive in 
<br />By the look of things this whips aint his 
<br />Cops on his tail time to loose these pigs
<br />So I move to the back where threes a AK 
<br />Thinking to my self now time to play 
<br />Pull the trigger put an end to their day 
<br />They scream quit I saying no way

<br />i lost hope for humanity at 10 years old felt the sting of a world so evil and cold 
<br />but something grew with in 
<br />anger for hope hope that i will win and the battle started young 
<br />my weapon was my tung many battles lost with many battles won 
<br />lost along my way all my paths turned to grey as i started to go astray and blackness covered day 
<br />abuse was my only way body started with pain pain turned to gain gain turned to insanity insanity was a fan of me so was my tragedy....
<br />everyday i looked in a mirror wondering who was really standing there was it me or the demand of my life did i really quit and loose that fight 
<br />something struck deep 
<br />felt hope crying out to me
<br />say break away take control back today don't go astray take the right way
<br />evil being doing evil deeds 
<br />looking for evil souls to feed
<br />so take the evil thoughts 
<br />take evil minds 
<br />take evil pasts 
<br />and take evil rhymes
<br />break these evil bounds
<br />to this demands grounds
<br />look to a new way
<br />a new life a new day 
<br />everything's a new way
<br />so i say 
<br /><br />call me back to the clouds take me away from broken ground give me what i need to never fall down cause im just trying to turn my life around 
<br /><br />gotta keep going only just begun this way may be a long road but it was a long road down better not to go back 
<br />cause the deeper i go down the more it will be hard to be found and hear a single sound so slow down climb to the top listen for the angels and the heart beat of what i forgot 
<br />i listen closely hopefully noisy busy owning and condoning not knowing where im going but condoning what iv done gotta be harder with the hate that breaks and subdues whats this fate with out a price of her knife lost love lost life's lost pain lost hope lost sanity cant cope but keep going with out knowing cause that's called growing

<br />that you envision and picture a future suited to them 
<br />captivated by the charm that it enlightens you 
<br />yet the very thought of getting close frightens you 
<br />yes I’m talking about a girl
<br />see i met her some time ago but when i saw her 
<br />my heart beat increase some more
<br />it was then i new exactly what i had to do
<br />it was at that moment my future changed i saw my own life in a very different way
<br />but this frightened me
<br />i had a different lifestyle and different beliefs 
<br />i was afraid of change, the same face everyday and i new this wasn’t my way 
<br />i was loan wolf, a heart breaker, the devils tragedy maker, evils translator
<br />so my mind said no, stick to the same road
<br />but my heart told me no there only one road to go 
<br /><br />so i let time take its way, and let the butterfly’s fly on, if i said no i new that i was wrong, cause ive been lonely for way to long, so my heart started screaming move on move on 
<br /><br />yes i may be sounding a little cheesy, but if you seen this girl you would say the same thing,
<br />believe me, gorgeous eyes with a breath taking smile, a beautiful body that could drive any man wild
<br />a personality that brings happiness to me, that I’m still wondering if I’m just in a dream, 
<br />there’s no question about the way she’s moves cause if she started to dance the hole place would start to the groove
<br />i still can never believe my eyes, cause to my surprise she walked right in my life, mother natures creation  
<br />of beauty and grace so much so it redeemed my faith 
<br />happy to this day that i didn’t do what was wrong happy to this day my heart said move on move on 
<br /><br />so i let time take its way, and let the butterfly’s fly on, if i said no I new that i was wrong, cause iv been lonely for way to long, thanks to my hear for screaming move on move on

<br />cause if you need someone 
<br />it wouldent be me
<br />your hearts starting to fall apart
<br />weve past the middle 
<br />your emotions get the take down
<br /><br />YOU SAY TIME WILL heal all wounds 
<br />BELIVE IN FAITH  what els can u do
<br />LEAVE THEASE FEELINGS at the end of this road
<br />TWO HALF HEARTS tride to make one hole
<br /><br />half cut eyes drug induced smiles
<br />take what you can then drain the bottle
<br />do what you can to make the memmery subside
<br />get so high till you cant belive your eyes

<br />if you don’t like me you are not worth remembering
<br />overtake the undertaker
<br />undertake the overtake
<br />beliefs where right no mercy in life
<br />for me this is easy 
<br />it means sympathy is leaving 
<br />fakes are believing
<br />hopes not succeeding
<br />ya coke is white 
<br />weeds still green 
<br />everybody knows at least one of these things
<br />kids are the future 
<br />kid where us
<br />we where the future
<br />we just fucked up
<br />so entertain gladly 
<br />please don’t get mad at me
<br />sorry that what you believed is saddening
