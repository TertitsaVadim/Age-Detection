<br /><br />Part of the effort is to make new friends. I took a leap of faith and placed my real face on the Internet. Oddly enough, it was received very well! Did not see that one coming.
<br /><br />I met a (seemingly) good guy but why do they assume that you want to be bludgeoned over the head and dragged by the hair to their cave? I don't understand, maybe the ugly duckling should reach for the far out people who will not have a hope in hell of meeting me. I will have a fit if I actually have to meet one of them. The worst is that some of them are NICE guys I WOULD actually like to meet. 
<br /><br />Missing my mom, but if she was around, maybe the evolution would not have been necessary. She was my comfort zone and I have lost my confidant, what now? I have to now act as if I have answers, and I don't....

<br /><br />I dreamt I had to look after a little toddler boy. His name was Jandre. I was at a shopping centre where my nephew and niece were modelling. 
<br /><br />The toddler, however, had his own plans and took off. This is frightening, given that he coulod not talk yet and that he went missing. I ran arounf and looked and looked - no toddler. Jeandre was gone. I ran into the movie houses, where they set up the modelling show, no baby!
<br /><br />My brother was more taken with his modelling children and did not want to help. I never found the child and woke up empty and in a cold sweat.
<br /><br />I had a hysterectomy and I don't regret that, however - given the dream, maybe I feel a bit hollow?

<br /><br />It is rather hysterical because they run through the house like little warthogs with tail in the air. This distresses Mommy cat terribly. Poor Blacky, like all mothers I suppose, just wants her babies safe out of the evil dogs way. And our little miniature Doberman is the devil's personal son and he will use the babies like toothpicks. Hence, if he comes near the back door or, God forbid the kittens, fur flies and a helluva wailing takes place (the dog).
<br /><br />My Dad was sitting reading his newspaper and kitty decided to follow the trouser leg, onto the back of the chair onto the shoulder and very helpfully started picking Grandpa's fleas. Grandpa was not amused, needless to say. Fortunately I had the camera of the cellphone close by and stole the picture.
<br /><br />The kid loves her XBox and her cousin for playing with her. The only problem is that the six-year-old niece feels like the proverbial fifth wheel...

<br /><br />My boss, the director walked up the stairs with me and with a smile on the face said that you and your family probably would not have a very pleasant Christmas, the first one after your mother passing away...Look, as a rule I HATE Christmas, because I hit the worst Christmas morbs. To then be confronted by this woman rubbing my nose in it, did not help.
<br /><br />Today, their fiftieth, would have been a celebration, now a non-event. I am certainly not going to talk about it to my father!
<br /><br />My godmother, an eccentric woman, would have celebrated her birthday today. I hope her daughter is surrounded by loving friends who will distract her the whole day. My aunt build a strong and independent daughter and although she lives in Cape Town, her cousin is mighty proud of her. I hope that she will also have the opportunity to have a little baby of her own one day.
<br /><br />We were talking about Christmas in general and dad, my brother and I all admitted to having no Christmas spirit. Look, we are Christians to the core, but we lost our taste for celebration when the old lady passed on. Things will never be the same and I pray to God that we can act and smile and convince the three children that we are in fact having a happy Christmas.

<br /><br />I am a harbor to many people, but what do you do with the spark of restlessness that becomes an inferno?
<br /><br />I don't want to tell everybody thing will be all right when I am just as scared as they are. I want to bungi jump and draw up a bucket list and actually DO something about it, because life is short. What do you leave behind? Frightfully little.
<br /><br />It is hard to trust and be truthful. We all wear masks. So many masks, who am I?
<br /><br />Why should one compromise? be happy with second best? Why NOT go for the brass ring? Why be the spectator? I want the checkered flag because my car won. No more sitting in the stands.
<br /><br />The ad people say: MAKE THINGS HAPPEN....

<br /><br />I always joke and say I race the rain home. Around lunch time the clouds start to come together, that is if I don't burn into biltong waiting for the kid's teacher to release her from prison.
<br /><br />It was exceptionally hot and the rain started falling and I had to feed my dogs. They cannot understand this woman does not want to get wet. It is hustle with our food or else!
<br /><br />After the rain, I rediscovered the amazing peace there is in just sitting quietly watching the water coming down. 
<br /><br />When the worst of the rain was over I called the kid and gave her a very strange order. Go run in the rain and come back. That little girl was so amazed by the magic of rain that she did not want to return into the house!
<br /><br />I remembered childhood and the walks after school after a thundershower and the simple joy of walking bare-feet in the clean rainwater next to the road.
<br /><br />Nowadays one cannot give your child that joy anymore but golly, they should feel what it feels like to feel warm raindrops on your skin!
<br /><br />It is pure magic!

<br /><br />During last week, our 9-year old somehow managed to extract her second last milktooth. She's an odd fish, I am grateful she's never asked me to try to do stuff like that. The other icky stuff babies do, she's done. She puked all over me and I changed a year worth of teething nappies. Not for the faint of heart.... Blood, is however not my thing.
<br /><br />The little tooth was deposited in the shoe and princess Daisy was off to bed. As background to those of non South African origin, in my culture we talk of &quot;die tandemuis&quot;, not the English toothfairy. The problem is just that we have two cats and, knowing me,  I told her we better close the doors and windows else the cats might get hold of the mouse.....She promised dire bodily harm to any cat coming near her room that evening.
<br /><br />Sunday morning the toothrat (I am too big to be a mouse) sneaked in to exchange the tooth for money. The only problem is the curtains were drawn and it was pitch black in her room. There is a bookshelf in her room and as I bent to look for the shoe I connected the bridge of my nose with the bookshelf. Tears were running over my face, but I pulled it off without schreeching.
<br /><br />Madam was pleased ut told me that die tandemuis is big and dressed in white. My defence? Denial and I assured that the cat did not kill die tandemuis.Fortunately she did not notice the extra bump on my nose...The things we do for love....

<br /><br />Many times I have said to all and sundry that relationships are built on respect. You can get hold of and have your way with the sexiest woman on the planet, but what if her physical appearance is all you share? You may also think all women go for Mills and Boone and bodice rippers, uh uh sunshine. Not this girl. It is like Colombo, B-O-R-I-N-G!
<br /><br />Time is precious and the little bit of time I do have, I sure as heck won't spend as a voyeur!
<br /><br />I admit that a few years ago, they started publishing bodice rippers in Afrikaans. I duly got hold of one and almost wet myself laughing. Be a woman's friend, find out what she's interested in, it may be similar to your own! A late neighbor (a female) was into restoring vintage cars and did not mind getting her hands dirty. Some women, remember the beauty queen Brigitte Bardot, is/was an animal activist. Her beauty might be gone now, but the passion for animals burns on.
<br /><br />If your lady nags like a kid, ask her what she wants for goodness sake! That is what we would do for your children!
<br /><br />We have opinions on actuality affairs, though you might hog the remote or the newspaper, eventually we get the news, even if it is on the radio in the kitchen...
<br /><br />Don't label things men's work and woman's work, that will come back to bite you, I assure you.
<br /><br />If you cannot cook, learn. We all have to eat. You might be pleasantly surprised. Can you operate the washing machine? Iron for survival? Share your knowledge. If you have a lady, teach her to change a plug, and a globe. If you think she is strong enough, her spare wheel! My father had me livid when I learnt to drive, he refused to teach me until I could change a wheel. Tell me thats not sensible?
<br /><br />For the record, some women like SCARY BOOKS! Stephen King, Dean R Koontz would not be that rich if the female population supported them so well.
<br /><br />Food for though....

<br /><br />Jogging is time consuming and it hurts and makes the joints pain extra. Knees and ankles were not built to run, walk to and from the car and step of the clutch and brake....ROFL.
<br /><br />A very funny partnership formed. The tiniest member of the canine family decided it is his dire duty to jog along. The hyperactive nine-year old lasted a half a block and asked her father if he is crazy. The dog on the other hand stayed with Jan. He has a route through Josie taking him past the gas factory, past the SABC and up one of the steepest hills in Johannesburg. Yes, the dog lasted.
<br /><br />We have three other large dogs in dire need of exercise but this dog, hardly the size of a large rat lasted all the way home. I am baffled. Please note he was not on a leach, Jan only lifted him out the street when it looked as if he might get run over, 100% his own choice!! No cruelty to animals, dog insane all by himself....

		<document id="aed6ba27c90cdf33117323936f158014" url=""><![CDATA[Like father like daughter<br/><br/>Our poor 9-year-old is learning tables and she hates maths, in fact the developmental psychologists said she has dyscalculi. This is like dyslexia for numbers. I think there are many of us out there who will grudgingly remember the time YOU had to go through what the child is suffering through. 
<br /><br />Many of us have dyscalculi pertaining to money, that is called the economic question, immeasurable wants and very limited means. That is when we adults hit the plastic and land in a world of hurt. 
<br /><br />In reality she switches her numbers around and I have heard of a person who did a doctoral thesis with the same problem. My mother passed away last year and Oupa landed with the responsibility of helping the child with the homework. Somehow, I think he might have been a remedial teacher in a past life or God gave him special abilities, he is reaching the mind of the slightly hyperactive kid who does not do numbers well.
<br /><br />Oupa does not play, he threatens if he has to and might even give a smack with the ruler. The kid then sits on attention and if she thinks she stuffed up, she ducks, exactly like my brother did many moons ago when mother was still with us.
<br /><br />I remember mother saying to Jan to come and sit next to her and him flat refusing, as she pulled his sideburns. 
<br /><br />I was a more boring kid and did my work, whatever they needed from me. My brother used to slip away to play in the park near the school and could not understand WHY they were upset with him! Those were the days...
<br /><br />Be honest, what &quot;stick&quot; did your parents use to get you to do homework?
<br /><br />Funnier even, the mos draconic teacher you ever had...Mine was Mr Jordaan who taught me Accounting. He did his job so well that I landed up teaching the subject!
<br /><br />I don't like the methods the kid's current teacher uses. I firmly believe that when you scream and curse, even though under provocation, it should be the exception, not the norm. In the lower grades kids still believe their teacher walks on water and is revered. I don't know what that is like, nobody ever admired me as a teacher. High school teachers are scorned and sniped at and when you start out you need a mentor, which I never had.
<br /><br />When I jokingly said I will wring her neck if she illtreats the kid, she almost had a nervous breakdown. Maybe she knows me too well...

That being said, I went to the bank to do the usual. In many respects I am an old fasioned girl and prefer to draw actual money and pay my accounts and get receipts for them.
<br /><br />As I wandered through Killarney Mall, I saw the clothes and a ghost of an old lady walked with me. Shopping will never be the same again. I see her bright eyes and excitement as she scratched among the latest fashion. Mostly I thought, : &quot;Mother where the heck will you wear that to?&quot; but kept quiet. The excitement of the hunt for the perfect outfit kept her going.
<br /><br />She also loved buying little dresses for her granddaughter, which she considered her daughter. Our time was too short. 
<br /><br />Her last ideal was to move closer to my brother and she even had the house picked out. Dad and I weren't too into moving, I did not want to drive further and dad has his things set up the way he likes it. She was one very persuasive lady and she even started to sway the opinion in her favour.
<br /><br />Dad wanted, when she passed away, to have her closeby so he buried her ashes right by our front door under an enormous red rosebush.
<br /><br />The other day the estate agent dropped by and asked Dad if he will still sell. I then assured Dad, only if you take Mom along!

<br /><br />Admittedly it was an exercise in futility. One wears certain &quot;caps&quot; for a lack of a better word and, especially at work, I am of the opinion that if you drop dead it would be a bit of a nuisance to management, but one's chair would hardly be cold before you get replaced.
<br /><br />At home, one is the &quot;go to&quot; person to do things for other people. There again, I am of the opinion that one is often doing your loved ones a disservice to not render them the opportunity to try and solve their own problems and clean up their own messes. Even the kid is coming up with more and more signs that she is starting to use her common sense....and they say it is the least common senses of all!
<br /><br />It does not help to wallow in things that might have been. Things I should have done and gone for, but did not because it is not the descend thing to do. I SHOULD have moved heaven and earth to have the little boy I would have doted on, but now it is too late. I can now only dote over the nephew and 2 nieces, my own child will never be.
<br /><br />And yes, I am depressed and should stop wondering whether he would have been blond with blue eyes like his grandpa. 
<br /><br />Maybe the madcow is setting in. ROFL.

<br /><br />We were watching RAW and there was a scene (obviously staged) where a baddie &quot;Kane&quot; got hold of one of the Divas, who happens to be girlfriend to Zac Rhyder. He was pummeled by Kane the past few weeks, supposedly to get John Cena to &quot;embrace hate&quot;. Cena consistently is as American and wholesome as apple pie and would rather die before doing that.
<br /><br />To Cut a long story short, Kane got hold of Eve and was going to abduct her in an ambulance. Cena appeared in the nick of time and saved the damsel in distress. This is where the giggle started. Eve thanked Cena properly to my nieces horror! &quot;No! Sis! Shes not his girlfriend! I'm going to wash my eyes! I was howling with laughter.
<br /><br />Later on I convinced her that I will be only too glad if Randy Orton takes me as a girlfriend! ROFL. Totally convinced....In the mean time I convinced her her mother has the hots for John Morrisson....&quot;You have to talk to my mother&quot; (Me innocently) &quot;Why?&quot; JOHN MORRISSON IS ALL MINE!!!!! Well, by then I was hosing myself. The child is a treat.
<br /><br />I tell her every morning in the car if her teacher smacks her I will come and give her &quot;sweet chin music&quot;. One kid totally horrified. That is a karate kick Sean Michaels used to do.....

<br /><br />It is a gorgeous day outside and yet I feel edgy and irritable. Maybe I am coming down with early winter morbs. I am tired and have been for a while. Not even a browse through the funnies can cheer me up. I shudder to think how I am going to cope around THE ANNIVERSARY of mom's death.
<br /><br />The cops were around earlier for the Cosatu march. Good for them, The only problem is they are not doing it for the right reasons and they are exploiting the people.It makes me think of the early nineties before this government took over and we would hear the distant thunder of a bomb in the city. Now you worry when you see the cops because you cannot trust them.
<br /><br />At least I get to see my nephew and niece. Two of the most beautiful children one can hope for. I hope they appreciate them enough. They are bright and spunky, but sadly they grow up too soon. Slightly sad, but sort of excited to see what they will do as grownups.
<br /><br />My little blonde bombshell will break many a man's heart. Hope she finds the confidence she needs.

<br /><br />One storms through life and never take a moment to see where you were.
<br /><br />It was odd, as life in high school was. I never quite fitted in, but aligned myself with the Outsider club. There were a few of us, either bright, unpopular or just plain odd to fit in. Those were the songs of innocence. What I found refreshing and liberating was that one of the so-called popular girls was there and I felt no residual animosity. So I truly closed the door. It was, in fact, pleasant to see them.
<br /><br />I took the little one and showed her &quot;my school&quot; although it has been out of business for ages. We walked passed the class where my brother played  cat burglar and cut open his knee, all for a smoke break...I also went back to where I slaved over Afrikaans poetry and prose. 
<br /><br />From now on I will forge on along with the family and make new memories. One should not be afraid of the past, nut let it where it is, in the past and life here, now and today. Yesterday is but water under the bridge.

		<document id="bec01c67cecd477dac5fea18560f6b5" url=""><![CDATA[Status quo<br/><br/>I am one of those adults whom have developed a comfort zone. I am not great with people. In the old standard five, our Mathematics teacher expected us to gather round his table and ask him when we did not understand what he was doing. Needless to say, I did not to my detriment.
<br /><br />I feel safer on my own and I have agoraphobia, that is I REALLY dislike crowds. I get cold sweats and heart palpitations. I will therefore be very light on a husband's credit card, because I can't stand big shopping centers. That being said, at work I also prefer being given projects to manage on my own, hate meetings and being around telephones and bosses. I worked in a call center at a stage and wanted to commit suicide when Monday drew near and I had to answer incessant phone calls from idiots wanting to know WHY THE HELL their plane is delayed!
<br /><br />The past few years I worked very happy as a translator and proofreader and ran the odd project for the boss. In a way I am grateful that I am where I am, because I can &quot;hide&quot; in my little cocoon when life started pressing down on me.
<br /><br />At home my mother was my buffer, if we received guests I got the heck away from there and very often hid in my room.Sadly, my mother passed away last year and now I am the woman of the house. They all look to me for food entertainment, clothing, and to play hostess when we receive visitors. It was somewhat of a shock when I discovered that I cannot go hide, I have to smile till my face hurts, all while I wanted to open my dogs.....(Wry laugh)
<br /><br />I now have to learn new work from a lady, whom I am sure is a honey when she's at home, but I am not sure whether she is supposed to babysit me to ensure that they squeeze every dime's value out of me or whether the lady is genuinely supposed to teach me her job. I am afraid it is the former. I STILL dislike to gather around Sir's table so that he could explain Maths to me. I hate Maths to the day...I don't have a problem with working, the dear lady is like those toddlers who would sit with ALL their toys in their little arms. God help anyone who tries to play with one of their toys.
<br /><br />Well friends, I'm damned if I do and I damned to hell if I don't. I am not a happy camper today. Doubly thank God its Friday.

<br /><br />The tendency in South Africa is, among the workers to stream to Durban on Christmas day, trains and trains full. Thousands descend on Durban beach and guess how many kids get separated from their parents? Scary. Dispose of the kid on the beach, it chills me.
<br /><br />A while ago a little toddler was running in the middle of the streer, I kid you not, complete with bib and nappy. I immediately picked up the kid and put him in the car. Now I had a problem, baby cannot talk and tell you WHERE he came from. Almost had me a baby there....LOL
<br /><br />Fortunately Chubb security had a guard in the viscinity and the baby apparently belonged to a matric learner who a) should not have a baby and <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cool.gif" alt=":)" /> looked after it now that she had! If she tried &quot;losing&quot; the responsibility, not under my car thank you!
<br /><br />Yesterday a little three-year old wandered into a park and then into the street. Unaccompanied. A kind lady fortunately picked the kid up, but the little one could not point out her house and does not talk much yet. HUGE PROBLEM! I was there about five and she was driving round the streets looking for a house...Wonder if the kid got home, even worse whether the parents noticed she was missing at all...
<br /><br />Children and pets are responsibility, please look after yours!
<br /><br />One could place here teen suicide.
<br /><br />Are you talking to your children or do you slump down in front of the television. I am sorry, no solutions here, I look after my niece, like a diamond. Shes not even mine and I love her. Yours are, can you say the same?

It is interesting to give a baby doll to a toddler and she will almost instinctively cuddle it.
<br /><br />Well, I am no different. I dreamt of having a child of my own. The only problem is now that biology has turned against me and in order to continue, I might have to sacrifice my womb. In all honesty, I would much rather have ROOT CANAL on all my teeth than to do that, but the fibroids are making my life too miserable to continue.
<br /><br />Should I chicken out, menopause might set in and I might be my ratty self, or the pain might drive me to the doctor in any way.
<br /><br />I truly don't know what to do. The idea of spending all that time at home will drive me crazy - I prefer my normal routine.
<br /><br />Dad and everybody I spoke to all think do it and get it over, but I have a huge aversion to hospitals, blood, pain (especially my own) and I prefer to play ostrich and forget about it altogether. Am I stupid? Naw, just scared and wish the retched appointment is over!

<br /><br />I am in hospital for THE OP every woman dreads. In my case I saw it coming like a car crash I could not really do anything about. I have been suffering of endometriosis. The doctor told me about ten years ago to have that baby, or risk never having one. Then came Janie. She is big and strong and every inch family. She has her little quirks, but that never deterred me. 
<br /><br />Now, the situation is such that there won't be a baby Charlotte. Maybe God  sent her to me because He knew?
<br /><br />I shall be strong so that I can go home to her. 
<br /><br />I hate being dependent on my family and to be caught like a rat in a mousetrap. Why can't I press the undo button or WAKE UP!
<br /><br />At work, we always joke that when you start acting erratic, like I have been, that the MAD COW has been acting up. Well, tomorrow the mad cow causes me to meet a psychiatrist (for nutty cows) and hopefully somebody who can sort out the hormones. The engine has seized up. Time to take it away?

I STILL have my womb but the doctor discovered a secret stash of gallstones. My silly body somehow cannot digest bile and decided that it is good building material and made six huge gallstones. One gallbladder op later and here I am....
<br /><br />I still feel like death warmed up, but I am working towards getting better. My sister in law decided that I should do the feminine thing and shop. This was done and I look like a very trendy lady, albeit a bit anemic, but for that purpose make-up was invented! No protests tolerated and the warpaint is on. Look better, feel better they say?
<br /><br />The gaping pit is still very nearby. The thought of escaping stays and is tied to my leg like a cement block. Life hurts, it really does. 
<br /><br />I went to church yesterday and saw my mom's  name on the wall of remembrance. So little remains of a life. A small box of ashes and a little brass plate with her name. 
<br /><br />Sunrise, sunset and life goes on.

<br /><br />I feel sick and slightly light-headed. Every time I get up from my chair I pray that my clothes are not soiled and that I won't leave a blood trail to the toilet. When will it stop? The doctor called it a curse from God. I can do much better.

<br /><br />It makes me so depressed that I want to go to bed and never get up again.
<br /><br />At this point, should I be able to get hold of a gynae who would operate I would go for it, despite the other problems I have had. I am tired and cannot take it anymore.

I would wear short skirts and frilly undergarments to &quot;hide&quot; the cleavage for the office. After work I would wear a blach or emerald green dress that would hug my figure.
<br /><br />I would smile and laugh a lot. Perfect people have everything. They are never alone and hurting. They have plenty strong arms to hang onto. They are never wallflowers and always are the centre of attention. Perfect people have the perfect life. Some would have the perfect husband and burn like a motherly flame to his credit and that of her children.
<br /><br />The perfect single career girl still get a lot of attention. If she is free she can exercise, the rest of the time she does the party scene on the arm of Mr Right Now, no need to commit to one guy. Perfect people are movers and shakers. They are never tied down.
<br /><br />The perfect woman would never kills her own spiders and puts on her own plugs, carries her own groceries and feels the pain of being alone, the odd one out, the one that never got picked, the one the married people feel sorry for and invite. It sucks!
<br /><br />She does not know what it feels like to be fat, obese, disgusting and vile. How on earth can anybody feel something for a person who sweats like a pig when you exercise. Someone whose weight have to be ESTIMATED, whose dietician palms you off on an anorexic fourteen-year-old who cannot even tell you how many carlories are in a slimmers diet?
<br /><br />I try and try, but it is not working. Bloodweek is drawing near and it is like a vice grip around my heart. I don't want to do this anymore and the lot at the gynaes agree with doctor Tilley. It's a curse from God. (Suffer you fat cow.) What's the use???

<br /><br />Today is your anniversary. You visited me again last night in a dream. We were clothes shopping - as we were so many times.
<br /><br />Jan was around too, but somehow closer than you were. You were babysitting. Once again, not clear whose child it was, maybe the one I never could have. Jan and I were scouring the clothes and boy were there many.
<br /><br />I don't get excited anymore, but on this trip I did. I really wanted a sexy dress and actually found a few. I got so excited I fitted them on and felt beautiful. The one number, a little frilly skirt, was too small and the sales lady went looking for it.
<br /><br />I got so excited I went looking for you and found you. You did not really like the clothes, but I did. I knew it was going to rock!
<br /><br />Ma, you were happiest in the shops and I really hope you don't have to babysit  my little unborn son.
<br /><br />Happy anniversary
<br /><br />Your still earthbound daughter

<br /><br />This morning I had a full blown anxiety attack. I don't enjoy them at all. I am bright enough to understand what happened and went to work and gym. The sister said the bloodpressure was very high, This was probably because of the anxiety attack. I bargained on the healing power of endorphines and pushed myself as hard as I could through the program.
<br /><br />It might be hormonal, I don't know. What I do know is that it takes almost super human effort to get going. Self loathing drives you to work out till you want to vomit. All for a few minutes of open-headedness. 
<br /><br />I wish it was less complicated. I wish I had the energy to sort myself out. I will do one better, I will return to Weigh Less. Maybe if I lose weight I will be able to lift myself up. Be whole again.
