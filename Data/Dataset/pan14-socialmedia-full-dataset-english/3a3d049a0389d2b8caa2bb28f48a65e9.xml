<br /><br />environments unique to the series. Music for the symphony was recorded with the critically acclaimed FILMharmonic 
<br /><br />Orchestra Prague in the Czech Republic. Monster Hunter Tri depicts a living, breathing ecosystem where humans and 
<br /><br />monsters co-exist. Players hunt fantastic beasts from a huge arsenal of weapons and armor to achieve glory and help 
<br /><br />the residents of their newly adopted village survive. One of the most strikingly beautiful titles ever developed for 
<br /><br />Wii, the hunting season allows unparalleled multiplayer gameplay both online and offline and companion adventures in 
<br /><br />arena mode.
<br /><br />Monster Hunter Tri sees the introduction of an expansive story mode as the role of a hunter is tasked by the Village 
<br /><br />Chief to investigate the constant earthquakes that threaten the everyday life of Moga village. A bustling and 
<br /><br />vibrant town, Moga is home to the hunter and includes a Blacksmith for forging weapons and armor, a shop where items 
<br /><br />can be purchased and an expanded farm with Felynes acting as laborers and tending the crops. Complementing the new 
<br /><br />creatures and quests that Monster Hunter Tri introduces to the series, hunters also have the benefit of new weapons 
<br /><br />and armor sets including an all new weapon class, the Switch Axe, giant bowgun and a Torch that not only illuminates 
<br /><br />the darkest caves but will fend off certain creatures as they embark on the most epic Monster Hunter adventure to 
<br /><br />date. For more information on the game please visit

<br /><br />Because the Irish star has signed a deal to distribute her music exclusively in Tesco stores.
<br /><br />At the same time the retail giant has revealed it will open the first ever &quot;drive-thru&quot; supermarket where customers 
<br /><br />order online and then simply travel to the store and pick up at an arranged time.
<br /><br />After trialling a video game trade-in service, it launched the scheme nationwide this week.
<br /><br />And earlier this month, Tesco launched the UK's cheapest mobile SIM-only deal.
<br /><br />All this from a company which has already branched out into electronics, clothing, credit cards, insurance, housing 
<br /><br />and even making movies.
<br /><br />So after the news this week is there any area of business that Tesco will notven ture into? Maybe this explains why 
<br /><br />its profit this year was a massive £3.5billion.
<br /><br />Already one pound in every seven spent by British consumers goes to Tesco at one of its 2,492 stores. Almost 400 of 
<br /><br />these are open round the clock. Its market share of 30.7% is double nearest rivals Asda's at 16.9%, Sainsbury's 
<br /><br />16.1% and Morrisons 11.6%.
<br /><br />And it can boast that it's the country's biggest private employer with 250,000 workers. That's not even taking into 
<br /><br />account the other 2,329 Tesco stores overseas.
<br /><br />It is a far cry from the humble beginnings, when street trader Jack Cohen first started the company in 1919, selling 
<br /><br />groceries from a stall in the East End of London.
<br /><br />In 1924 he developed a successful line in tea, which was supplied by a TE Stockwell. The canny entrepreneur joined 
<br /><br />the first three letters of his supplier's name to the first two of his and the word Tesco was born.
<br /><br />The first store opened in 1929 in Burnt Oak, Edgware, North London, with the philosophy of reduced profit margins, 
<br /><br />to keep prices low, but maximising turnover. The formula, still in force today, was a hit and by 1939 Cohen had 100 
<br /><br />stores.
<br /><br />The company steadily expanded, introducing the first self service store in 1951 and its first supermarket in 1956.
<br /><br />But it was the arrival of Sir Terry Leahy which turned the company into a retail juggernaut racking up sales of 
<br /><br />£60billion.
<br /><br />He arrived at the chain, based in an industrial estate in Cheshunt, 14 years ago as chief executive and quickly 
<br /><br />realised it would be hard to increase the market share of 30%. Instead, he looked to other markets to branch into.
<br /><br />He turned out-of-town superstores into mini department stores selling everything from clothes to electronic 
<br /><br />equipment. He bought clothing like Levi jeans on the &quot;grey market&quot; from the Far East and sold them at far lower 
<br /><br />prices than clothing stores.
<br /><br />As the range of Tesco products increased, the firm was accused of destroying the high street as customers flocked to 
<br /><br />his out of town stores. He then set out a new chain of shops, colon i s i n g communities through the Tesco Express 
<br /><br />stores and through a partnership with Esso petrol stations.
<br /><br />It introduced the first loyalty card, the Clubcard, which was an instant hit with customers.

<br /><br />over for the weekend broadcast of the leaders.
<br /><br />Next week is the Deutsche Bank Championship at the TPC Boston. Stricker won last year and remember: it's played over 
<br /><br />the Labor Day holiday in the U.S. so it starts Friday and ends Monday.
<br /><br />EUROPEAN TOUR
<br /><br />JOHNNIE WALKER CHAMPIONSHIP AT GLENEAGLES, The Gleneagles Hotel, Perthshire, Scotland - While the PGA Tour begins a 
<br /><br />new chapter with the playoffs, the European Tour will end a chapter Sunday at The Gleneagles Hotel.
<br /><br />This is the final tournament for European players to earn one of the automatic nine spots on the Ryder Cup team. 
<br /><br />Colin Montgomerie's squad will be finalized on Sunday with the announcement of his three captain's picks.
<br /><br />Lee Westwood, PGA Champion Martin Kaymer, U.S. Open winner Graeme McDowell and Rory McIlroy will make the team from 
<br /><br />the World Points list.
<br /><br />Ian Poulter and Ross Fisher seem like safe bets as two of the five from the European Points list. Francesco 
<br /><br />Molinari, last week's Czech Open winner Peter Hanson and Miguel Angel Jimenez are in the precarious spots 7-9.
<br /><br />Molinari and Hanson are in the field at Gleneagles, but Jimenez is not. He's attending his nephew's wedding, so he 
<br /><br />may be in trouble for one of those automatic spots.
<br /><br />Paul Casey and Padraig Harrington are next in line, but are teeing it up at the PGA Tour's Barclays instead. They 
<br /><br />will have to rely on Montgomerie selecting them with a pick.
<br /><br />Simon Dyson, Alvaro Quiros and Ross McGowan have chances to break into the top nine. Dyson and Quiros need to win 
<br /><br />the title this week to make the team, while McGowan has to do no worse than second.
<br /><br />Casey and Harrington will definitely be on Monty's short list for picks come the completion of play on Sunday. Luke 
<br /><br />Donald and Justin Rose will be among those for Monty to choose from, as will Edoardo Molinari, the brother of 
<br /><br />Francesco, and Champions Tour star Bernhard Langer.

<br /><br />KNOXVILLE NEWS SENTINEL OPEN, Fox Den Country Club, Farragut, Tennessee - The Nationwide Tour heads to Tennessee 
<br /><br />this week for the oldest event on the schedule, the Knoxville News Sentinel Open.
<br /><br />Last year, Kevin Johnson birdied the second playoff hole to defeat Bradley Iles and win for the sixth time on tour. 
<br /><br />Iles fired a nine-under 63 to force the extra session, but was denied his first tour title.
<br /><br />This event started in 1990 and was won that year by Jeff Maggert.
<br /><br />There is no television this week. The tour moves to Pennsylvania next week for a new event, the Mylan Classic.
<br /><br />CANADIAN TOUR
<br /><br />CANADIAN TOUR CHAMPIONSHIP, St. Catharines Golf and Country Club, St. Catharines, Ontario, Canada - For the second 
<br /><br />year in a row, St. Catharines will host the season-ending Tour Championship.
<br /><br />The top players from the 2010 season gather with the money title on the line. The top-two finishers on the Order of 
<br /><br />Merit after play on Sunday will be exempted into the second stage of the PGA Tour National Qualifying School.
<br /><br />James Love won last year's Tour Championship when he parred the first playoff hole to defeat Lucas Lee.
<br /><br />USGA
<br /><br />U.S. AMATEUR, Chambers Bay Golf Club, University Place, Washington, and The Home Course, Dupont, Washington - The 
<br /><br />110th U.S. Amateur Championship began Monday at Chambers Bay Golf Club and The Home Course.
<br /><br />Both venues will be used for the two days of stroke play while Chambers Bay will host the match-play rounds. At 
<br /><br />7,742 yards, Chambers Bay will be the longest course in USGA history. Torrey Pines Golf Club, which was the site of 
<br /><br />the 2008 U.S. Open, was previously the longest at 7.643 yards.
<br /><br />Last year, Byeong-Hun An became the youngest U.S. Amateur champion in history when he defeated Ben Martin, 7 &amp; 5. At 
<br /><br />17 years, 11 months and 13 days, An surpassed 2008 winner Danny Lee as the youngest champion.
<br /><br />An is back to defend his title and if successful, he would be the first to do so since Tiger Woods' three-peat from 
<br /><br />1994-96.
<br /><br />After two days of stroke play to find the low 64 players, the first round of match play begins on Wednesday. The 
<br /><br />second and third rounds are scheduled for Thursday. The quarterfinals will be Friday, the semifinals on Saturday and 
<br /><br />the 36-hole final is on tap for Sunday.
<br /><br />Golf Channel will broadcast some action on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. NBC takes over on the weekend.
<br /><br />The next USGA event is mid-Septemeber and it's the USGA Men's State Team event.

<br /><br />But automatic car washes haven’t been introduced there yet, Kinnear said, citing that as one example of services that are taken for granted in the U.S. but make China “the place to go” for people interested in entrepreneurial success.
<br /><br />Still, cars, trucks and buses share the roads with bicycles and carts carrying goods, said Lehman, recalling the frequent sight of people on major city streets pulling heavily loaded handcarts through traffic.
<br /><br />Personal income isn’t generally that high, but it has grown considerably, he said. “People are much more comfortable than they were 10 or 20 years ago,” added Harder.
<br /><br />The government is focused on providing growth and social stability, and citizens appear to accept constraints on their personal freedom in return, observed Lehman, also chair of Bluffton’s economics, business administration and accounting department. “It’s an economy in which the government takes a significant role in creating development and opportunity,” he said, noting that China has become a global economic power despite moving into the “modern world” only since the 1980s.
<br /><br />“There’s this huge level of energy that’s just stunning,” he continued, also pointing to a boom in new housing and office complexes in the nation of about 1.4 billion people. At a planning museum in Chongqing—the largest municipality in the world—the visitors saw a model train-like map that envisioned new high rises throughout a transformed city.
<br /><br />The delegation also visited the 2008 Summer Olympics site in Beijing. The venues were off limits during the MBA trip two years ago because of pre-Olympic security but are now a tourist attraction. Among the sights was a man walking a high wire across the top of the “Bird’s Nest” stadium—attempting to set a Guinness world record—while children played on the track. “The Olympic site is amazing in terms of its scale,” but its future use is still uncertain, Lehman said.
<br /><br />Northwest Ohio-related stops on the tour were at a Sauder affiliate and Tokai Rubber Co. Ltd., whose network includes Bluffton’s DTR Industries Inc. The travelers also went to the Beijing office of the Cincinnati-based law firm of Taft, Stettinius &amp; Hollister, one of whose attorneys offered an economic prediction to Ginger O’Malley, a Bluffton graduate in the group.
<br /><br />As the cost of labor is rising in China, he told her, companies are moving their operations to Vietnam and Cambodia but not finding the needed labor force, O’Malley said. As a result, he forecast the return of factories to the United States, and to the Midwest in particular, saying “we should be ready for this,” added the Ottawa resident and community volunteer.
<br /><br />She also said the visitors’ Chinese hosts made them feel welcome. “We were almost treated like trade ambassadors,” said O’Malley, who earned a master’s degree in organizational management from Bluffton in 2002 and was traveling with her husband Michael, an attorney and Putnam County Court judge.
<br /><br />Hoping to return again in two years, Harder and Lehman have encouraged members of the delegation to speak to alumni groups and community organizations about the trip. Harder called it “an excellent experience,” due in part to the access afforded by Byler’s career and connections in China. It’s an opportunity for those who are curious about the country to “get more than you can get just by reading,” she said.

That's how many land-tour itineraries the cruise line has developed for 2011-2012. The itineraries are combinable with an Azamara cruise for cruisetour packages and offer more authentic cultural experiences for the up-market traveler. Each adventure ranges from two to six nights and are in such cities as Rome, Athens and Istanbul. All land-tour itineraries are escorted by a tour director or a local host, and feature accommodations in five-star hotels.
<br /><br />These itineraries are very much geared for upscale travelers, says Larry Pimentel, president and CEO of Azamara Club Cruises. “The introduction of these new offerings will enable up-market travelers to enjoy an even more immersive adventure with Azamara. Guests have more opportunities to experience the cultures of exotic destinations by extending their Azamara voyage with a land-tour itinerary.&quot;In summer 2011, guests of Azamara Journey and Azamara Quest  can choose a two-night Athens or three-night Rome cruisetour package. The Rome cruisetour includes a visit to the Pope’s summer residence and Oastia Antica at the mouth of the Tiber  River. 
<br /><br />In the 2011-12 Austral summer, Azamara Journey guests can choose a three-night Buenos Aires &amp; Iguazu Falls land-tour vacation extension. The cruisetour also takes guests for an overnight to the breathtaking Iguazu Falls on the border of Argentina and Brazil.
<br /><br />In the Far East, guests can rediscover the inland metropolises of India, including Delhi, Agra for the Taj Mahal, and Jaipur during a five-night itinerary. Additionally, a five- or six-night cruisetour itinerary unveils the cultural heritage of China in Beijing, Xian and Hong Kong.

<br /><br />As a leading online travel service provider of hotel accommodations, airline tickets, packaged tours and corporate travel management in China, Ctrip integrated the high-tech and conventional aspects of the travel industry and achieved great success from its call center and Web-based business model. After outgrowing its Shanghai call center, Ctrip added a new call center in Nantong, configured to fit more than 12,000 call seats. Upon its completion, Ctrip will move its main operations from Shanghai to Nantong, at which point the call center will become the world's largest in the travel industry.
<br /><br />Ctrip's Nantong call center also will enable the company to not only accommodate clients' phone calls in time but, more importantly, it will help facilitate and optimize after-sales services for its customers and ultimately enhance their loyalty to Ctrip. However, the company understood that building and maintaining a flexible, stable and highly reliable call center required an efficient network infrastructure, which also will be leveraged to provide network services for an upgraded back-up network in Shanghai.
<br /><br />Force10 Switches Deliver Host of Features to Support Ctrip's Expansion
<br /><br />As Ctrip continues to grow its travel business, the company is confident that the C-Series and S-Series solutions will provide the greater performance, port density and investment protection that the network will require. The non-blocking, switch fabric capacity of the C-Series reaches up to 1.536 Tbps and up to 952 Mpps L2/L3 packet forwarding capacity with just five microsecond switching latency under full load for 64-byte frames. To ensure continued high performance in the core, but maintain a smaller, eco-friendly footprint and investment protection, the C-Series resilient switches provide up to 384 line-rate Gigabit Ethernet (GbE) ports and 64 line-rate 10 GbE ports.
<br /><br />With its high density, the stackable S-Series brings scalability to the edge network of Ctrip's Nantong call center and an outstanding performance-cost ratio that is expected to also help eliminate any potential bandwidth bottlenecks.
<br /><br />Ctrip selected Force10 C-Series and S-Series switches in part due to the underlying modular Force10 operating system (FTOS) software, which promotes network agility and resiliency while delivering network services that contribute to lower power consumption. For example, Force10 PowerSmart technology is able to automatically sense the power demand from equipment connected to it and configure the power supply accordingly through the application of LLDP, which is based on multiple standards and has been deployed extensively. Since this automatic power configuration technology makes it possible for enterprises to only use the necessary amount of power, total power consumption can be reduced significantly.
<br /><br />Dedicated to the Construction of a Green Call Center System
<br /><br />With Chinese enterprises paying more attention to energy conservation and environmental protection, power management has become a major priority for data centers. Going forward, Ctrip required a network that can cut down on unnecessary power consumption in order for the company to have a green and energy-saving data center.

<br /><br />MEMPHIS, TN (WMC-TV) - A father still wore a LeBonheur Children's Hospital visitor's bracelet when he spoke with Action News 5 outside his family's apartment in the Cordova Creek complex.?
<br /><br />?&quot;I just got here,&quot; he said.  &quot;I've been at the hospital since it happened.
<br /><br />Action News 5 agreed not to use the name of the father, who said his 14-year-old stepson and two friends, ages 11 and 13, are the boys charged with raping his 23-month-old daughter Monday night.?
<br /><br />?&quot;We don't know anything, so talk to the investigators,&quot; the father said.?
<br /><br />?Memphis Police detailed the disturbing crime in a media release.  They say they first responded to a home invasion call, where officers were advised by the children that a male suspect forced is way into the home.  But sex crimes investigators determined the story was fabricated by the boys to cover up a sexual assault in which the 23-month-old child was raped.?
<br /><br />?The boys were hauled to juvenile court while the toddler was taken in critical condition to LeBonheur.
<br /><br />??The victim's father would not tell Action News 5 for how long the little girl had been alone with the boys, but the crime left neighbor Cindy Yahola concerned about the safety of her eight year-old.
<br /><br />??&quot;We were told the other day by a neighbor that there was a 14-year-old that offered him drugs here,&quot; said Yahola.  &quot;I'm not happy.&quot;
<br /><br />??The toddler's father seemed confident she would be okay before he walked away from our interview.
<br /><br />??&quot;She's a strong girl...hard as nails, so she's doing good,&quot; he said.
<br /><br />??The victim's father said his step-son had his first hearing Tuesday morning.  The boy's mother said the other boys lived at another apartment complex in Cordova.

If you have someone that doesn't want to learn anything, then they don't want a better life.
<br /><br />The purpose of revolution is change. The world has no need for another lackluster, unmotivated person. Someone has to learn to become better than who they are. Nat Turner did it for freedom. I do it for the freedom to be better than you are. But at the end of the day, I make music, so I love to entertain the masses.
<br /><br />Ww: In rap years, you're pretty young, at 22. How often do you have the &quot;pay your dues&quot; conversation?
<br /><br />TJ: I'm actually still 21. I'll be 22 on September 4th, and in rap years, I am very young. Some of the guys that I look up to and seek advice from have had the paying dues talk with me many times. Honestly, I'd say about once every two weeks or so. It's all a learning process, and I'm learning that I'm doing okay, but I've still got a long way to go.
<br /><br />There are folks that have been making music for years that are very talented and are still grinding for a break. Paying dues is part of how you build your rep, as well. So I'm in no rush to get anywhere too soon, but I am working hard every day to get where I'm going -- wherever that may be.Ww: Your lyrical terrain is rugged with punch lines and humorous double entendres like &quot;The Biggest Loser.&quot; How do you come up with these themes?
<br /><br />TJ: Different songs come from different places with me. Sometimes the beat tells me what to say, and sometimes my emotions just take over. For example, &quot;The Biggest Loser&quot; was born strictly from Dealz Makes Beats production. If he never made the beat, I would have never made that song.
<br /><br />Then there is a song like &quot;Mr. Mistro.&quot; That was the emotion of being pissed off. Someone told me I wasn't a musician. My reply: You're right. I'm Mr. Mistro. I use my ideas, taste for word and my love for speech and presentation, do the work, and then I go to town.
<br /><br />Ww: On the production end, you have some heavy names and collaborations, from Big J Beats of 1984 to Dealz Makes Beats to Xperiment. What criteria do you use when choosing which beats to rap over?

<br /><br />He is planning to drop a new street album called Shady Loyalty 1st before his first official release for Shady.
<br /><br />“I finished the Shady street LP and it’s just called Shady Loyalty First.  I love the project it’s 12 tracks of undeniable fire,” Ca$his told AllHipHop.com.  “Young Buk from Psycho Drama, Mitchy Slick, and production from Rikanatti, Frank Dukes, Young De of Homeland Security. Everyone needs to check for the single. Its like a real Shady Records anthem for 2010 through 2011.”
<br /><br />A number of rappers are still on Shady Records after several artists including Stat Quo and Bobby Creekwater were let go, with their masters.
<br /><br />While Ca$his is back again working hard on his music, he struggled for a few years going through personal issues.
<br /><br />Of his favorite records, a song about his daughter Miana, whose mom passed away is his favorite.
<br /><br />“So far one of my favorite records is Miana about my first daughter, her mom died and I went to jail and its like a Ms. Jenkins, but updated and looking back at life and problems that people go through. Its timeless and that separates it from anything.  You can never go wrong doing a song being honest about your child,” Ca$his said.
<br /><br />Staying focused has been the goal for the rapper, who has been releasing new music or videos every week for the past 8 weeks.
<br /><br />“Yea man this is going on 8 weeks of nice stuff for everyone this week,&quot; Ca$his said. &quot;My mindset in this music is to just go in and show that I am improving.  People may have forgot about me and my whole squad.  Like I said, I took a little break to get cleaned up and to get focused. “
<br /><br />Ca$his was first showcased in mainstream rap when he was featured on a mixtape by Eminem which later turned into the album, Eminem Presents the Re-Up.

<br /><br />Ryan L. Castiglione is charged with two counts of armed robbery with threat of force and one count of failure to comply with an officer's attempt to take him into custody. He is being held at the Milwaukee County Jail.
<br /><br />Castiglione is accused of robbing The Equitable Bank branch at 7400 W. Oklahoma Ave. in West Allis on Aug. 30 and robbing the Chase branch at 7606 W. Morgan Ave. in Milwaukee the next day, according to a criminal complaint.
<br /><br />According to the complaint:
<br /><br />Castiglione passed a demand note to tellers at both banks and received a total of more than $4,800, the complaint says. Castiglione wrote in one of the notes that he was armed with a gun and would kill the teller if she didn't give him money.
<br /><br />Within 30 minutes of the robbery at the Chase branch, Milwaukee police officers tracked Castiglione to his home in the 2300 block of S. 54th St., the complaint says. Castiglione refused to leave the house when officers arrived, prompting a standoff.
<br /><br />Castiglione was arrested about six hours later by tactical officers who entered the house. Police found an air gun tucked in Castiglione's waistband, the complaint says.
<br /><br />Officers also found notes in the house in which Castiglione had written that he was planning on being fatally shot by police, according to the complaint.
<br /><br />Castiglione must undergo a court-ordered examination to determine if he is competent to proceed in the case, according to court records.

Then, in an even more impressive accomplishment, he survived his postmatch press conference without any sexual innuendo.Mr. Djokovic, the lanky, 23-year-old Serb, has long had the reputation of being one of the bigger wiseacres on the tennis tour. Asked last week whether he would ever try to imitate Roger Federer's backwards, between-the-legs trick shot, he said he would not. &quot;I have something else between my legs,&quot; he said. &quot;Don't worry, I'm not going to show it to you.&quot; He also compared the feeling of winning his five-set, first-round match with sleeping with his girlfriend.
<br /><br />His spot-on impressions of fellow pros Maria Sharapova, Mr. Federer, Andy Roddick and Rafael Nadal became a hit when they were posted on YouTube. Perhaps he gets it from his father, who has been wearing a T-shirt with a huge image of his son to the matches.
<br /><br />Mr. Djokovic next will face the athletic Gael Monfils in a battle of immensely talented but eccentric Europeans who both have figured out how to slide around on the hard courts at the Billie Jean National Tennis Center. As long as Mr. Djokovic remains in the draw, consider it a victory for the tournament's entertainment value.

<br /><br />Cramped into the eWerk theatre in the Mullheim district of Cologne, a massive crowd of games journalists eagerly waited to see what Sony would show off at this year's GamesCom. Here are some of the highlights of their press conference. * A LittleBigPlanet 2 trailer highlighted some of the ways players will be able to not only create their own levels in the upcoming sequel, but design their own fully-fledged games. This includes utilizing connectible stages, so player-designed games can go beyond the &quot;Go from A to B&quot; formula of the previous title.
<br /><br />* The company announced new bundles for their PS3 system, including Move packages. You can read more about that here.* Each person attending the conference was given (err, rented) a pair of 3D glasses for one presentation, which highlighted many of the upcoming and currently supported 3D games Sony has to offer. By far the most impressive was Motorstorm: Apocalypse, due to the speed and visceral nature of the racing series. Especially awesome was the amount of destruction going on in each track; like Split/Second, the world is literally coming apart at the seams while players race through it--very cool.
<br /><br />* Greg Goodrich of EA once again took the stage to show off more Medal of Honor, only this time he called upon the skills of Mike Shinoda of Linkin Park, who wrote a song for the game. The stage the pair showed off was called Gunfighters, and took place inside a helicopter equipped with enough firepower to take out a small middle eastern village, which is exactly what Shinoda did. Many enemies equipped with RPGs didn't make the mission a cakewalk, but they eventually made it through. It seems the devs have put a bit more polish on the game since the last time we saw it, as the framerate was much less choppy this time around.
<br /><br />* In what was easily the shortest gameplay segment of the press conference, the crowd was shown an extremely brief Killzone 3 MP segment, though aside from watching players score points by getting kills, it was hard to take away much from the video, other than making us want to get our hands on the game even more.
<br /><br />* Insomniac Games' Ted Price took the stage to reveal what one of the newer branches of the studio was been up to, which turned out to be Ratchet &amp; Clank: All 4 One. The four-player co-op game relies on teamwork between players just as New Super Mario Bros. Wii did, though the teamwork aspect becomes more complex in the three-dimensional arena. A boss fight towards the end of the demo showed how teamwork is integral in All 4 One, as players needed to launch their buddies into the air to activate switches which would cause huge structures to collapse onto the towering boss creature.

<br /><br />Speakeasy, because it is a nerd at heart, is most interested in Age of Empires Online,” which is an extension of the historical strategy game “Age of Empires.” The premise of the game is for players to build their own civilizations and interact with other players and friends around the world. The first village that can be grown into an empire revolves around the bustling Greek culture (We realize saying that we like “Age of Empires Online” because of its (initial) Greek setting is akin to saying we like “Red Dead Redemption” because of the American West backdrop, but that’s how we feel.) Developed by Robot Entertainment, the game features a slew of both old and new features, which include cooperative multi-player quests, original storylines and of course, an ever-growing city that continues to prosper (or fail) even when the player is offline.
<br /><br />Though the Age of Empires Online site doesn’t seem to be up and about yet, you can sign up for the beta version of the game.

He used a box-cutter as a weapon, wore a cut shirt sleeve as a mask, generally wore a hat and carried a black backpack for the loot.
<br /><br />Reaux worked at a GameStop store in Hammond in 2007 and 2008 before he was fired for improperly using employee discounts and store deals, and thereby in essence stealing from the store, according to testimony. Those accusations that led to his termination, which GameStop never pursued criminally, were unrelated to the crimes for which he was arrested.
<br /><br />During the trial, Assistant District Attorney Bruce Dearing also brought up five other GameStop robberies that Reaux is accused of committing in Jefferson and Livingston parishes. Authorities said Jefferson and Livingston are still weighing whether to pursue their cases against him.
<br /><br />Armed robbery is punishable by a minimum of 10 years and a maximum of 99 years behind bars.
<br /><br />Reaux confessed after his April 30, 2009, arrest, the box cutter was found in his possession, and St. Tammany sheriff's deputies found some of the stolen merchandise in his car. During the trial, he testified that he was coerced into his confession after being told he'd only get probation if he admitted to the crimes.

That’s exactly what Joey Logano and the No. 20 GameStop Toyota team did Saturday afternoon. The team fought an extremely tight, then an extremely loose car all afternoon long, eventually bringing home a sixth-place finish.
<br /><br />Logano started the race in the ninth position, one spot ahead of Joe Gibbs Racing teammate Kyle Busch. Logano stayed in the back half of the top-10 for the first part of the event, complaining of a tight condition that had plagued the team all weekend long. After the first round of green flag pit stops, the team “threw the book at it” and made a number of changes, freeing the car up considerably.
<br /><br />Logano stayed in the back half of the top-10 until a caution brought the cars down pit road on lap 64. The No. 20 GameStop crew busted off a great stop and gained Logano three positions in the pits, sending him out fourth. When the green flag dropped, Logano instantly made a few moves and found himself in position to battle for the lead. However, with the new Nationwide Series cars creating a considerable “draft” and the No. 20 now facing a loose condition, Logano fell back to seventh place.
<br /><br />The team elected to stay out under a late-race debris caution and restarted the race in fifth while several others in front and behind Logano pitted. Logano was able to hold his own with the older tires and when the checkered flag flew, Logano found himself crossing the line in sixth.
<br /><br />Joey Logano Thoughts:
<br />“It was a frustrating day with the No. 20 GameStop Toyota for sure. We really couldn’t get the handle on the car all weekend long. We were really loose on Thursday, then went the other way and got the car so tight both Friday and today that I could hardly drive it. The guys were making changes and making changes and nothing was really helping it. Finally, we made a change on our first stop in the race and that loosened the car up, maybe just a little too much. We could never really find the handle on it and it showed. We just struggled with this new car, plain and simple.
<br /><br />“I guess it’s a good thing when you can be frustrated with a sixth-place finish. We are a good team and we expect to win or compete for the win every single time out. This weekend, we just didn’t have it. We were a third- or fourth-place car all afternoon long. We really didn’t think tires would do all that much for you, but that is where we got beat at the end. If we would have come in and taken tires, I think we could have finished third.
<br /><br />“We’ve got some work to do with the new Nationwide Series car. It was a learning experience. But our guys are some of the best out there and they will work their butts off and get it better before the next race. So, we’ll just load her up and move on to next week.”

<br /><br />At Monday's board meeting, Bartley gave school directors a report on her China trip with a delegation of more than 350 American educators. Accompanying her on the journey, which lasted from June 21-29, were school board Director Anne Dahl and Barbara Heckard, the district's assistant superintendent for assessment and accountability.
<br /><br />The trip was the sixth &quot;Chinese Bridge&quot; tour sponsored by the Confucius Institute Headquarters in partnership with the College Board, the company that produces the SATs and other educational testing. The entire trip, except for an application fee and travel costs, was paid for by the Confucius Institute, which is a nonprofit agency under the direction of the Hanban, or Office of Chinese Language Council International.
<br /><br />The mission of the Confucius Institute is to promote the learning of China's culture and language in other countries &quot;contributing to the development of multiculturalism and the building of a harmonious world,&quot; according to its website, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fenglish.hanban.org"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://english.hanban.org</a>. And that goal was apparent on the entire trip, Bartley said.
<br /><br />&quot;There was a tremendous openness from the people everywhere that we went, from the education side, to work with us and link with us where they could,&quot; she said. &quot;There was a feeling that they wanted to partner where they could. ... There was a real strong sense that the goal of this was harmony and better global understanding and cultural awareness.&quot;
<br /><br />The Americans arrived in China after a 14-hour flight, Bartley said. After an opening ceremony, they were divided into groups of about 60, and each was assigned to visit a region of China. The region Bartley visited was Tianjin, a coastal city of about 10 million people in northeastern China.
<br /><br />&quot;The city of Tianjin was phenomenal,&quot; she said. &quot;There were new buildings being built that were very modern and very beautiful. I had never seen anything quite like it.&quot;
<br /><br />While in Tianjin, the group visited elementary and secondary schools. Although the schools were public schools, Bartley said, they were elite in the fact that only top students were eligible to attend, and their parents paid tuition. English is taught beginning in the elementary school, so they were able to speak with the high school students, she said.

<br /><br />return of Marko Perovic from suspension. New England was sorely missing his spark and invention in attack on Friday 
<br /><br />and will be hoping that he can be counted on to unlock a stingy Rapids defense that has conceded 24 goals in 23 
<br /><br />matches.
<br /><br />Colorado Rapids: Omar Cummings is the player on form for the Rapids lately. With nine goals in  sixteen games this 
<br /><br />season, Cummings is the man to watch when Colorado takes on New England at home on Saturday night. Pablo Mastroeni 
<br /><br />has been playing well in midfield as of late and has provided much of the great service for Cummings and Casey up 
<br /><br />top.  
<br /><br />Off Target
<br /><br />New England: There's plenty to consider off target, but a disturbing trend over the last few weeks has been the 
<br /><br />deteriorating play of Darrius Barnes. Generally, it's his partner Emmanuel Osei who has the scary moments and Barnes 
<br /><br />is around to clean up the mess and hold the line. Lately, however, Barnes' alarming lack of positioning sense has 
<br /><br />led to him playing opponents onside in far too many situations, which has cost the Revolution goals and valuable 
<br /><br />points. One of the goals in the Chivas game was such a mistake, as Justin Braun made a quick run to peel off the 
<br /><br />shoulders of the defensive line, and rather than holding position and stranding Braun offside, Barnes followed him 
<br /><br />and allowed Gordon's pass to find Braun in a dangerous spot, where he chipped Reis and scored. This cannot continue 
<br /><br />if the Revs want to return to winning ways.
<br /><br />Colorado: After two consecutive shutouts, the Colorado defense gave up three goals against New York in last week's 
<br /><br />loss. Once again the Rapids did not start well and gave up an early goal from which they never recovered. The back 
<br /><br />line did not have a convincing game and were picked apart by the technical ability of the Red Bulls strikers. They 
<br /><br />need to tighten up at the back, play more physical defense and not allow players to get in behind them or Matt 
<br /><br />Pickens could be picking a few more goals out his net on Saturday night.

		<document id="20aba3fa36f699ad733882eb61448554" url=""><![CDATA[an accomplishment<br/><br/>With J Hutcherson -- It's hard to describe the Red Bulls as streaking. They're certainly not in the category of say 
<br /><br />FC Dallas, unbeaten since May 20th. That's 14 games, including six wins in a row at Pizza Hut Park. There's where 
<br /><br />New York travels tonight (9pm - regional only) with the idea that getting anything out of a game with Dallas is an 
<br /><br />accomplishment. Well, for most teams.
<br /><br />Though it's easy enough to look at New York's recent results and see opportunities wasted, they haven't lost back-
<br /><br />to-back games since that four-game losing streak that started in Week 7. They're still working to overcome that 
<br /><br />stretch, currently 5th in the playoff table. At this stage of the season, the only indicator that really matters.
<br /><br />Dallas might also be looking back and wondering why their undefeated streak hasn't translated into more points. They 
<br /><br />lead New York by one in the playoff race with a game in hand, and their two losses this season are two less than any 
<br /><br />other team. New York was the other team that beat them, wining 2-1 on April 17th at Red Bull Arena. As with all 
<br /><br />things Red Bulls in 2010, that was pre-Theirry Henry and Rafael Marquez.
<br /><br />Scouting New York means games after July 31st. Scouting Dallas means figuring out if this is a team that settles for 
<br /><br />draws (they lead MLS in that category with 11, three more than anybody else) rather than risk a loss. Two out of 
<br /><br />Dallas's last three games ended 0-0, canceling out against Columbus and San Jose while beating Toronto 1-0 in 
<br /><br />between. In mid-August, they had back-to-back 3-1 wins - the only games this season where Dallas has scored more 
<br /><br />than two goals - but they came against Philadelphia and DC United.

<br /><br />dating for decades and ready to tie the knot no matter who you have to swear your life away to? Or are you one of 
<br /><br />the women out there really only in it for the wedding? Gross.
<br /><br />New research out of The University of Michigan School of Public Health says to increase the odds of getting hitched, 
<br /><br />start by taking a look at the gender dynamics of your area. When men outnumber women, females marry younger and the 
<br /><br />age gap between spouses grows, the study, published in the journal Evolutionary Psychology, says.
<br /><br />Why? Not shockingly, the paper exposes a “truth” about men, women, and relationships: Men are more concerned with 
<br /><br />the number of sexual relationships they might have whereas women are more concerned with commitment. But when there 
<br /><br />aren’t enough women to go around, men tend to treat ladies as a scarce commodity, and their oat-sowing behavior is 
<br /><br />shut down by a need to snatch one up and call her his own.
<br /><br />In other words, it’s simply supply and demand. Daniel Kruger, the paper’s author put it this way: “When women are 
<br /><br />in the minority,they have greater bargaining power” to get the kind of commitment they want.
<br /><br />Odds are good in Alaska, where there are 107 men to every 100 woman, that women might wield the kind of “bargaining 
<br /><br />power” (read: sex) to get married where and when and exactly how she chooses. Other high-ranking states are 
<br /><br />Colorado, Idaho, Nevada , Utah and Wyoming. (I know this story now, I saw Anne Heche in ABC’s Men In Trees. Rugged 
<br /><br />men in towns with lady shortages DO tend to be more romantic and eager to marry. At least on TV.) Is it the 
<br /><br />industries of the Western states–ranching, logging, farming–that make them so manly?States to steer clear of (or 
<br /><br />get out while you’re still young and desperate to tie the knot) are largely south of the Mason Dixon line. 
<br /><br />Surprising, considering the old Southern Belle phenomenon. Earlier in American history women were so scarce in the 
<br /><br />American south that they were treated as precious as–well, as a fine tobacco leaf, and placed on a pedestal that, 
<br /><br />while lovely, greatly restricted their freedom.
<br /><br />These days, Census numbers show that in Alabama, there are only 93 fellas to each little lady. As a result, the 
<br /><br />fellas are running wild, sowing their oats and are loathe to settle down with any young belle. With odds like that, 
<br /><br />the men are free to be concerned with what Kruger calls their primary concern: strictly sexual relationships. they 
<br /><br />know that, in the end, there will be women around when and if he decides to hang his hat.
<br /><br />Sounds a lot like the New York dating scene… which incidentally has only 90 men to every 100 women.
<br /><br />In closing, I give, as a point of reference for single ladies looking to get the deed done (whatever the reason), 
<br /><br />ten cities in America where your chances are looking particularly bleak. If you’re thinking of moving, think again. 
<br /><br />If you’re already living there, maybe increasing the reach on your Match.com location matches isn’t a bad idea.

<br /><br />repeated references to R.C. 2929.191. The State urges that, because Haskins failed to include a transcript of the 
<br /><br />sentencing hearing, this Court should presume that a de novo sentencing hearing occurred and affirm. Upon review of 
<br /><br />the November 25, 2009 nunc pro tunc journal entry, this Court cannot accept the State's position.
<br /><br />{¶9} It is well established that &quot;a trial court only speaks through [its] journal entry[.]&quot; State v. Overstreet, 9th 
<br /><br />Dist. No. 21367, 2003-Ohio-4530, at ¶8. Here, the court's November 25, 2009 nunc pro tunc journal entry: (1) 
<br /><br />specifically cites R.C. 2929.191; (2) indicates that the court held a hearing, pursuant to that statute, &quot;to correct 
<br /><br />the judgment of conviction&quot;; (3) orders that the correction &quot;be filed NUNC PRO TUNC,&quot; the specific mechanism for 
<br /><br />correction under R.C. 2929.191(C); and (4) indicates that Haskins appeared by way of videoconference link, the 
<br /><br />specific method for appearance mentioned in R.C. 2929.191(C). Moreover, the nunc pro tunc journal entry lacks 
<br /><br />several critical items that only appeared in Haskins' original sentencing entry. These items include a statement 
<br /><br />that Haskins was afforded his Crim.R. 11 rights, a statement that the court considered the principles and purposes 
<br /><br />of sentencing and factors set forth in R.C. 2929.11 and 2929.12 when fashioning Haskins' sentence, and a dismissal 
<br /><br />of Haskins' attempted murder charge.[ 1 ] The plain language of the November 25, 2009 nunc pro tunc journal entry 
<br /><br />simply does not support the State's assertion that Haskins received a de novo hearing.
<br /><br />{¶10} This Court is not without sympathy for the State's position, as the trial court applied R.C. 2929.191 without 
<br /><br />the benefit of Singleton. The plain language of R.C. 2929.191 permitted the retroactive application of the statute, 
<br /><br />and the trial court simply applied the statute as written. Only upon Singleton's issuance did it become clear that, 
<br /><br />despite its plain language to the contrary, R.C. 2929.191 only applies prospectively. See Singleton at ¶26. Because 
<br /><br />R.C. 2929.191 did not apply to Haskins and the court did not afford him a de novo sentencing hearing, this Court has 
<br /><br />no choice but to conclude that his nunc pro tunc journal entry is void. See Singleton at paragraph one of the 
<br /><br />syllabus; Yeager at ¶13. Further, because Haskins has already completed his prison term, this Court cannot remand 
<br /><br />this matter for a de novo resentencing. State v. Bezak, 114 Ohio St.3d 94, 2007-Ohio-3250, at ¶18. Haskins is 
<br /><br />correct in his assertion that this Court must vacate his nunc pro tunc journal entry and that he cannot be ordered 
<br /><br />to comply with post-release control.
