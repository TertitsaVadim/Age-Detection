The dramatic critics of &quot;The New York Times&quot; even argued that &quot;Gossip Girl&quot; represented the new generation of women after that of &quot;Sex and City&quot;, showing its far-reaching influnce. With every episode broadcasting, there were full of questions, for example, what clothes Serena( the name of the female leading role in the play) worn in the play under discussion, and more and more online shops began to make use of the clothes in the play to promote their commodities.Wardrobe Essentials for Love&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Serena's dress with golden sequins was asked most frequently. It was designed by Tory Burch with the price of $750, which has been sold out. Another female leading role Blair's boots - Max Studio, of course, also has been sold out. The scarf--J.press Chuck wearing appeared frequently in the play has led to a tide of rushing to buy. Besides, Blair's heart-shaped necklace -Tiffany, and the sexy, sweat pajamas--Victoria's Secret have become popular goods.Iâ€™ll Have What Katy Perry Having:  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5naGRzYWxlLmNvbS5hdQ__" target="_blank">GHD Hair Straighteners</a>  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Different from the brightly colored noble academism, &quot;Gossip Girl&quot; as a whole creates and leads the decadent academism, which extends and deepens the Preppy fashion raised by designer Marc Jacbos. Styles of clothes are derived from the traditional life styles of English and American high society: outing, picnic, horse riding, lawn tennis, golf, yacht out to sea and noble schools which are set in suburbs. It represents real rich life,leisure and good taste and shows the simple ,clean and elegant dress style ,but with a little decadence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A group of growing children are dispensing the past but troubled by the future, so decadence exactly meets their needs. They pursue high-quaility life, and are eager to freedom but keep the traditional appreciation of the beauty. Therefore, scarves, pearl necklaces, headbands and other accessories become indispensable in the girl's modeling, while boys often match a conservative suit with a Polo shirt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The popularity of the TV shows also makes a gong of people famous who are off stage.And the most striking one of them is Eric Daman. Being a fashion assistant of Patricia Field in the Sex and The City and taking home the Emmy, he finnaly gained a big break because of Gossip Girl. He also cooperate with Old Navy to teach him how to match  prince and princess from uptown eastern on the official line of play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fashion designer Abigail Lorick who is younger also becomes popular. She used to be a model who actually even failed to find enough money to attend the New York Fashion Week prior to &quot;Gossip Girl&quot;. Lucky, as good friend of Eric, she provided her first series clothes to crew, so, audiences saw a specialty episode’s plot, which is taking photos for fashion magazines. Then Abigail is famous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The actors also caught on fame. With no exception, they all got favored by the media. A crowd of young actors born after 1985 occupied the covers of the most famous fashion magzines with their young faces and bodies.i Of course, when we get down to think about it, fashion is a synonym to terrible temptaion. It is not guilty of being superficial, but guilty of being able to mislead the value of its pursuers. We have to say that fashion circle has never just sold clothes but that kind of fetishism and  vanity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;American literary critic Carol Plau Liebau thinks, some women is indeed easy to go wrong because of this TV drama--makes “sexy is more important than character or wisdom” charm and normalize seriously.&lt;/p&gt;

How to Buy  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5naGR1ay5jbw__" target="_blank">ghd straighteners uk</a>   There are a lot of comments on the market, many of which take the proportion promotion and pickup in sales as another saying of the promotion of the competitiveness .

One Should Know the Reasons of the Popularity of  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5naGRzYWxlLmNvbS5hdQ__" target="_blank">GHD Straighteners</a>  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year is a special period, the European counties and the United States are affected greatly by the financial crisis, our country is also affected, but it does not give us too much influence. At this point, the economic benefits between the enterprises, represting the impact of economic crisis and the strength between countries. Along with the western countries get recovery from the financial crisis, China’s Top-500 Enterprises still can not compete with the strong companies of developed countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is known to all that the power based on efficiency is the real power, but how does efficiency come into being? The efficiency which is built up with the most great resources and forces of the country can only be an &quot;isolated&quot; incident. Many of our top 500 enterprises are built on such a basis at the cost of many small and medium-sized enterprises. The top five hundred enterprises built up in this way, due to lack of broad support from small and medium enterprises, are vulnerable to &quot;sharp stop&quot; strange phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The author of The Post-American World had compared Zhen He’s Voyage to The Western Seas to Columbus’ discovery of the new world. Comparing to the then Europe’s voyage, Zhen He obviously had larger and more ships of better quality, in today’s terms, great and strong. Nevertheless, since the then China could manufacture perfect ships to conduct massive maritime explorations, why couldn’t they make matches? Why China had such a less benefit than Columbus’s expedition in such a strong maritime adventure, moreover, why had it stopped suddenly?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To the first question, the author’s answer is that Zhen He’s fleet was the same as the Forbidden City which was constructed by a similar national command system. Since the year 1406, there were more than one million laborers working on it, in addition another more than one million soldiers were supervising. A society’s whole energy and resources were put a limited numbers of works. Then the success of these constructions is only some “isolated” success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for the second question, the author's answer is: the task of Europeans sailing was smaller and more efficient; And often it is the cooperation between private and public, new products and new discoveries can be found in each sailing. While China’s navigations were decided by the interests and power of the emperor, and the official will pay for the money, regardless of cost; They do not value economic profits, and then the reaction line between companies, exploration, science and study did not exist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All in all, technological innovation with Zheng He is based on the country’s centralized resources. Meaning that these technologies surpassed the then development level of economy and society to a extent that was difficult for the society to take advantage. Thus it can be seen that if China’s businesses keep on taking big as strong, and strong made by the whole nation as by themselves, they can never be self-independent and self-reliance.&lt;/p&gt;

We generally consider the salary level for the same job, the male enjoy more than the femal. However, the impact of gender-role to pay can be much more than that simple. The latest phychology study shows that the male who has traditional concept own the higest level of salary. While in other gender, it is the women who support the idea of equality between men and women receives more payment than the traditional ones; however, the gap is not as obvious as that of the men.Youth Day Gift Ideas for Female&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published &quot;Applied Psychology&quot; magazine in the United States, Dr. Timothy Judge and other researchers from the University of Florida analyzed sample surveys-four interviews from 12,686 participants including men and women from 1979 to 2003. The researchers asked respondents of what is the view on gender roles in family workplace. They needed to answer questions, like &quot;what do you think of the status of women in family&quot;, &quot;will women's stepping out of family lead to more juvenile delinquency&quot;, &quot;should women stay in home if the men are very successful&quot; and so on. At the same time, these respondents also reported on their income status, religion, educational level, marital status and work experience.Suitable Tricks to Resume  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5naGR1ay5jbw__" target="_blank">ghd uk</a>  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having controlled a series of related factors, the researchers found that salary of those men who hold the view of traditional gender roles is 8,500 USD higher than those who don't hold such views. Women in Kraków all Like to Wear  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5naGR1ay5jbw__" target="_blank">ghd straighteners uk</a>   As for this phenomenon, the researchers believe that today even in the promotion of gender equality environment, people who have traditional concepts also will try to maintain a balance between work and family. For women, the results were on the contrary, the average pay to female holding traditional gender role attitudes was 1,500 US dollars less than those without the traditional values. In other words, it can be expected that married couples who hold traditional gender role attitudes, their payment are more 7 times than couples with a gender equality attitude. And if one holds traditional attitudes of a man and a woman holding a gender equality, when combined, will create the highest family income.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The result also shows that the change in the ideas concerning gender roles will result in a change in salary, the more traditional a woman is, the greater loss will be in terms of payment, while the ideas of equality between the two genders will narrow the difference in payment between them. The research also found that respondents whose parents work outside show less the view of traditional gender roles, while those married and religious people will be prone to have traditional ideas. As for young people, they have less traditional gender roles concept, but the older they become, the more traditional concepts they have. Many people have realized the inequality of earning between men and women is more than an economic phenomenon. There is an important psychological mechanism at the back of it. The government try to make salary equality between men and women as their public policy goals, but the traditional gender roles ideas existed in people's mind will affect the long-term goal.&lt;/p&gt;

Statistics show that United Arab Emirates has many debts fallen due this year. The crisis of Dubai may be only a tip of the iceburg.Why the Most Expensive  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5naGR1ay5jbw__" target="_blank">ghd straighteners uk</a>   in This Season are So Ugly?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still Facing Debts Pinch Next Few Years.Why the Most Expensive  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5naGR1ay5jbw__" target="_blank">ghd uk</a>   for Now are So Strange?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Merrill Lynch estimates of Bank of America, the total debt of the United Arab Emirates is 184 billion U.S. dollars at the end of 2009, while there will still be a large number of debts will be due in the region by 2013. Merrill Lynch says in a newly-released report that as the official statistics wasn't fully released, there is lack of information transparency in the debt storm. A higher risk premium will be demanded from these uncertainties. And it may impact the prospect of the financial recovery in Gulf that Dubai World declared the plan of restucturing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is shown in the report that, given that the debt risk exposure in Dubai region isn't entirely appear, the debt payment is still quite problematic. In the 184 billion US dollars' debt of UAE, Dubai claims 88 billion US dollars of it while Abu Dhabi shares amount of 90 billion US dollars. Bank of America Merrill Lynch says apart from the debt of 88 billion dollars this year, Dubai will still have debt due of 50 billion dollars in the future three years. Which includ about $120 billion in 2010, while $19 billion s and $180 billion respectively in year of 2011 and 2012. It is estimated by the analysts that the total debt of Dubai is 26.5 billion of which 80 percent of money should be paid back in the next three years. While the turnover costs of the debt may be higher than the valuations, because these figures only include the amount of principal repayment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UAE central bank shows a positive attitude.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To appease the market-panic by the debts crisis, UAE Central Bank in Abu Dhabi announced on Sunday that it is setting extra liquidity facilities, backing banks sectors. Central bank announced in the statement that it has send the notice to each bank to which can received additional liquidity tool on special arrangements of current account. However, the rate is 50 points higher than 3-month inter-bank rate of call in UAE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Concerning the statement of central bank, John Sfakianakis, a economist in United Arab Emirates, said the move is to regain the confidence of investor and avoid the extended panic caused by crisis. But he also said that the statement made no mention of Dubai, at the same time the central bank did not disclose the specifics of this arrangement the size or value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for the suspicion and guessing from the outside, the officials from Dubai and Abu Dhabi on Monday denied that there exists crack between the two local governments. They further said that the discussion over finance support to Dubai was carried out among Dubai, the central bank and federal authorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At present, the outside world and investors are concerned about how Abu Dhabi would solve the problem. Because Abu Dhabi is both the financial provider of the UAE central bank and also a key factor to protect the financial health of Dubai.&lt;/p&gt;

It also refers to popular and mature information carriers existed, such as SMS messaging service. Another common explanation of SNS: Social Network Site, ie the &quot;social Web&quot; or &quot;social net.&quot;The Fittest  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5naGRzYWxlLmNvbS5hdQ__" target="_blank">GHD Straighteners UK</a>   Are Issued, Go to Have a Look!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When ordinary people can have computing and communications resources which may compare to the web server by installing the SNS software, what will those Internet companies investing in a large number of servers do? What are their advantages? Will there be more new Internet companies, whose front end and background might not be present Google, EBAY or Sina model? Even the 3 million strong server clusters of which the operator like Shanda games is proud is the core competitiveness? When the machine in a cartoon's home can play his work through the SNS video device, does he need to go to manage a website? Probably a housewife does not know Html programming, doed not know the word site, but she can only use the SNS cookbook publishing program and a PC in the kitchen to help millions of people master her craft, and her stances on the stove is quite clear. What are you thinking at that time? In today's Internet now, we as the clients are like a dummy, do some slavery things only through the server, look at other people's sites, play other people's games, send emails, in addition to these, we have no freedom.The Enticement You Can not Sit Loose -  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5naGRzYWxlLmNvbS5hdQ__" target="_blank">GHD Hair Straighteners</a>  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now is the time to start a revolution! Central task of the revolution: how to let more than 10 million computers play their own roles, let users create and control their own information, without the company's servers manipulating us. Individual power is weak, the birth of the Internet makes syntaxis of individuals' and strange forces in a short time possible, while SNS makes the possibility become a reality. The ultimate significance of SNS is to integrate the scattered individuals in the Internet orderly and organicly, just like the silk thread strung pearls. The key is to make the pearls find the pearls and the fish balls find the fish balls. If an SNS always let the fishball fall into the pearl base, or vice versa, it is definitely a disaster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To let the same type of individuals associate perfectly is the core application of SNS. Now almost all of the SNS take the webgame as the core applications for getting users together, which is obviously a departure from the basic value of SNS. SNS takes human relations as a basis. The user inevitably have the behaviour characteristics of participation, communication and sharing. This kind of behaviour spends a lot of time. Therefore, the core applications of SNS should invovle two basic characteristics of simple operation and high frequency property of participation. Internet application which now can meet the two characteristics is only the microblog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Living the life from the days into the scripts is the inevitable result of the information age and the rapid urbanization, which is also the reason why microblog is highly regarded. Significance of microblog for the individual is not confiding but listening. Individuals will be more concerned about the content published by the objects followed, and associate by responses. This series of acts like release, attention, following, recovery, re-release form a virtuous communication cycle. Each man and followed object form a small circle, a number of which link together to form a SNS Network. Microblog makes SNS more valuable. Microblog can not be said to be the only core application of SNS, but the success of microblog definitely can promote the success of SNS, which is of course only the success on applications. From the time used, the mobile terminal has more potential than a computer to become the main platform of SNS. The successful commercial application must tie the other twin brother SMS. Microblog and text message are born to make a pair. Break down the boundaries between the two means not only to create a new network application, but to create a new business model. The key is how to merge the interests of the enterprise, microblog and the user into a harmonious business system.&lt;/p&gt;

Rich Women Cast a Glance at  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5naGR1ay5jbw__" target="_blank">ghd straighteners uk</a>   When I read this tragedy Othello &quot;when the heart is calm, do not know to look like a heroic man like Othello. Why would let iago. Such a small while playing in hand? Iago being respected by people around him, we are really amazed by such a real mean person's disguising skills which are wise and mature. This tragic told a story about Othello a More fall in love with Desdemona, daughter of patriarch in Venice and finally their love was acknowledge by the patriarch and they went to Cyprus Island to fight for peace for their country. Their motherland won by the arrangement of the God, but their own fates could not get the satisfactory endings. Though Othello is brave, he is credulous and lost his love, his bright future and his life due to the provocation by Iago.Hottest, Newest, Latest:  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5naGRzYWxlLmNvbS5hdQ__" target="_blank">GHD Hair Straighteners</a>  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Othello is the hero, but to this hero he does not have the advantages of self-confidence and observation that he should own. He is too credulous in others. He is truly a warrior, a wise and resourceful commander in fighting, However, he lacks communication with others and understanding of others. His gallant character is only suitable for the barracks, wars, but not for exchanges and communications with others. He lacked the patience to understand and think about the others. This also illustrated that he lacked trust for himself and his most close people, and he was too narrow-minded. The sense could not resist the urge and vanity.How to Conquer the Bruise of your  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5naGR1ay5jbw__" target="_blank">ghd uk</a>  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Desdemona’s death proved her chastity. She died for her reputation and innocence, but could this really explain her faithfulness for love and her husband? Someone said that her death is women’s resistance, but does this resistance useful? She made her father dead for the love in her mind, and she has fought for the love deep down in her heart. But at last, she dies. And I believe that she is disappointed when she is dying. She is discouraged and depressed. She does not ever think that the man she has already given all her faithful love and loyalty distrusts her. He has finally chosen to preserve his rights and honor. In front of love, a number of men and women admire for her, and a number of men and women are remorse for her life, how many men and women lose themselves for her? Some people say, &quot;Love is irrational thing&quot;, some people help others because of love, some people hurt others because of love and some people ruin themselves because of love, but does love really have so much magic? Can it lead people not know what to do? I think the death of Desdemona is too unworthy. It is not necessary to die in order to safeguard a woman's virginity. Death also will provoke other people's sarcastic comments and can only bury her virginity and the truth. Then why do we not resist?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since ancient times it is eternally immutable that man is superior to woman. Woman is really inferior to man? I donnot think so. We women should be superior to man in the spiritual field but give men their dignity in order to pour oil on troulbed waters. Men and women should have the basic trust if they are together. The life and the love between husband and wife need management, and if problems occurred, it is not unilateral responsibility. Any one of us is trying to shirk all responsibilities do not want to attract not trouble himself, may have occurred to some than to shirk its responsibility to carry down is more easily! Actually the biggest weakness of the tragedy is overcredulity which is also the biggest one of us who live in modern times. Even we know that groundless rumour is fake but we can not help believing it. Take today’s entertainment field for example, it is even more obvious. In such a contentious field, fans are depressed, even angry, because their idols have been attacked by an injustice. This is an obvious behavior of gullibility? “Gossip is a fearful thing” is true. There are too many people ruined by rumors. A sentence can build a world while ruin a world too. Why we should pay too much attention to other people’s words. Only if we live as we wished with a clear conscience, we do not have to care too much of other people.&lt;/p&gt;
