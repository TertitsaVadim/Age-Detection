This is not a new one as the abilities of mind and its complex processes have always been an area of interest for the scientist. The modern day Noetic science is a complete discipline which is based on the study of consciousness and importance of subjective experiences. The term Noetic was first used by Greek philosophers and it means ‘mental’ and ‘perception with mind’. This has been known as a field of study related to metaphysical philosophy that is involved in investigating mind and intellect. The historical evidence shows a complete study of this topic on philosophical grounds and includes two major doctrines, the agent/patient intellect by Aristotle and divine intellect by Plotinus. These classical philosophies provide a clear understanding of something over and above the physical and material world and explain the existence and use of mind with all its subjective powers. <br /><br />However today, things have changed and this is no more a topic of philosophy. Throughout the history, this term, Noetics has been used to explain topics like consciousness, spirituality and mind power. A major modern day study, known as theory of Noetics, was proposed by Richard L. According to him, the mind and consciousness can be described in quantitative terms by making use of formulae applicable to quantum things for example light.  <br /><br />Noetic science, as proposed by the institute of Noetic sciences, is another theory that provides evidence and explanation of Noetics. This theory combines the subjective and objective understanding to interpret the happenings in physical world. It also studies the impact of intuition and other subjective outcomes like beliefs, thoughts and intentions on the physical world happenings. <br />Noetics has taken the shape of a formal scientific study that intends to explain the role of consciousness in nature. Various experiments have been designed to find evidence for this theory.

It is highly based on deep subjective experiences that go far beyond the scope of conventional science. <br /><br />Everyone will have a different opinion on the topic, ‘what is spirituality’? This is because of the diverse beliefs and attitudes of people. The most reliable definition of spirituality is that it is an ongoing search for and attempt to develop and strengthen relationship with God and understand the purposefulness of our being and the existence of universe. This leads one to a never ending journey of self exploration that cannot be estimated through any other means. The ultimate outcome of this phenomenon is the understanding of one’s role and purpose of life which is the biggest question for all disciplines of study including science, philosophy and arts. <br /><br />As one starts moving on this journey that starts with a simple question, what is spirituality? ; He faces more and more quest for knowledge. What if you get a chance to watch a movie on the very same topic? This is obviously a good option as movies do attract and develop understanding of apparently bizarre topics.

Since it covers a unique topic of energy healing, it is getting a mixed kind of response from viewers. <br /><br />The topic covered in the movie is not a pure science fiction. It is actually based on the complex set of factors that are supposed to determine the health. The modern day research on quantum physics is a major inspiration and tool that is sued for this purpose. The movie advances with interviews from experts of the field. The interviews are coupled with illustrated dramatized videos that show how some people had recovered from chronic illnesses. The movie includes the story of a five year old who was suffering from cerebral palsy.

However, this modern day study of complicated experiences is known as ‘Noetic science’ and this term was first used by Edgar Mitchell, an astronaut on Apollo 14 who was the sixth man that walked on the moon. He, upon his trip back to earth, had experienced a sense of connectedness in the universe. He claimed to have a feeling that universe is not just an incidental creation. This led him to believe that reality of life is not as simple as it is explained by the conventional scientific studies. He believed that the actual study of reality is possible only if consciousness is studied deeply. Subjective and objective approaches of understanding act as equals and eventually lead to a better understanding of some miraculous creation. Most recently, this term has been used by the famous author Dan Brown is his publication, The Lost Symbol. <br /><br />The whole study of Noetic science revolves around one statement that is, ‘consciousness matters’. Consciousness here refers to awareness that is how a person makes use of his subjective experiences to understand and analyze the beliefs, emotions, attitudes and intention. They tend to explain why, how and when is it possible. It does not challenge the importance of everyday life that is based on objective observation and analysis of happenings. The only problem is that it does not give any importance to subjective understanding hat includes intuition, gut feeling, etc. what Noetic science does is that it combines the objective and subjective ways of study to explain some complicated happenings that have not been resolved by the objective science. It leads one to understand his or her being and the purpose of existence. What, how and when are the questions that come later in this endless journey of creation and destruction. <br /><br />The Living Matrix: An Extra Ordinary Effort to Promote Health Education<br />The living conditions of today require a greater emphasis on health. Everyone today seems busy trying to get information about health and ways to maintain health in the best manner. But if you try to do so, it seems so time consuming and boring to get information on this topic as internet is loaded with information that is not reliable and not organized so as to attract a common person.

Some facts<br />One among the most interesting and widely discussed question of all times is, ‘what is spirituality?’ it is a topic that is considered and discussed in almost every religion but also finds a considerable importance in science as well. Spirituality has been considered a part and aspect of the religious practices. The broader concept of spirituality developed after the popularity of atheism and has made it a large scale phenomenon that is not limited to the religious practices.<br /><br />It is usually known as the immaterial and ultimate reality and an inner way through which one can discover the reasons and purpose of his living. There are certain practices like prayers, meditation and contemplation that lead one to built an inner life and get the experience of uniting to the bigger reality. In simple words, spirituality and religion work in harmony and lead one on his path to find God. Although spirituality has a lot to do with religion, there is a phenomenon known as secular spirituality that focuses on humanistic beliefs and practices like love, harmony, patience, tolerance and other like this. It must be mentioned here that spirituality is not likely to be related to any one religion. It is a kind of inner awareness that leads one to discover the ultimate reality of this universe and living. <br /><br />Another aspect of the question, what is spirituality is the spiritual path. Spirituality is actually a journey of a person towards a better understanding and achievement of the goals like awareness, perfection, wisdom and connection with the God. The things required to keep moving on this path are prayers, meditation and sometimes spiritual transmission from a preceptor. <br /><br />Science also seems to consider this question, what is spirituality and has a relationship with it and the religion that is complicated. The discoveries of science are in connection with religious and spirituals truths about nature and it does prove the religious claims. <br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2xpZmV4cGVydC5jb20_" target="_blank">click this</a>, <a href="/" target="_blank">Full Article</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5saWZleHBlcnQuY29t" target="_blank">my link</a>

The human body is built according to the informational programs. These programs are present on the higher planes of matter existence. This includes the bodhi, mental, Astral, atman planes of stable matter. The process within the bodies of higher planes and disturbances in the informational program results in the physique sickness or problems within the life of an individual. The regularity of these planes is higher than the human body. <br /><br />Greater planes from the physique are also referred to as the Aura or human power shell. Nevertheless, most of the individuals do not know that there are numerous other shells exist, also. You will find intellectual, emotional, programming shells within the human body. The information on these shells is accessed by the brain, and the physical physique or shell is formed using the info derived from the human brain. All one requirements would be to discover and know how to use its brain at its complete possible.<br /><br />You will find different brain zones within the human brain, and certain body function is responsible and dependant on the function of every brain zone. This is a reality that all of us are blessed using the human brain, however the majority of us is not conscious that how you can make use of it. <br /><br />There are various types of instruments are utilized for the diagnosis of infosomatics. These instruments help in identifying the original reasons of the sickness or somatic disorders. There are methods that assist in recovering damaged informational programs of the human body, and takes the human body in to the greater planes of processing. <br /><br />Every day the interest in the study field of the Noetic Sciences is growing quickly. The Noetics is created by the work from the Institute of Noetic Sciences also known as IONS. The main goal of this institute is to offer assist so individuals can do the research phenomena and may reach their possible, as we.

After watching the above recommended movie you will be conscious of the Aura or energy shell. It is noteworthy to understand that there are different other shells that exist on the higher planes. Every shell is getting its personal objective. The physical shell from the human physique protects against the dangerous influences from the power shell and the material plane. Flat parallel cosmic rays are directed towards the crown from the head via the emotional shell of an individual. The emotional shells have a tendency to improve as an individual becomes bigger. This shell may be big as much as five kilometers, and this really is the reason that numerous occasions people are talking about a person prior to he appears there. This really is all due to the emotional shell of that particular individual. The positive emotion plays an important role in growing the emotional shell of an individual.

Everyone today seems busy trying to get information about health and ways to maintain health in the best manner. But if you try to do so, it seems so time consuming and boring to get information on this topic as internet is loaded with information that is not reliable and not organized so as to attract a common person. What if you get a chance to watch a movie on the very same topic? This is obviously a good option as movies do attract and develop understanding of apparently bizarre topics. The living matrix is one such movie that has gained significant attraction after its release. Since it covers a unique topic of energy healing, it is getting a mixed kind of response from viewers. <br /><br />The topic covered in the movie is not a pure science fiction. It is actually based on the complex set of factors that are supposed to determine the health. The modern day research on quantum physics is a major inspiration and tool that is sued for this purpose. The movie intends to give information on the importance of energy healing and medication that is totally a new thing in the field of medicine. The living matrix shows some examples of common people who made use of this re-connective healing. <br /><br />The living matrix is more of a documentary that has challenged the traditional practices of medicine and biological beliefs. This movie tries to explain the complicated biology of humans that is far more complex than what we study in today’s era. The research shown in the movie revolves around the topic of bioenergetics and medicine. It does not cover genetics but makes use of the human physiology and bio chemistry. The movie advances with interviews from experts of the field. The interviews are coupled with illustrated dramatized videos that show how some people had recovered from chronic illnesses. The movie includes the story of a five year old who was suffering from cerebral palsy. The other cases include a doctor with brain tumor and housewife with fatigue syndrome. <br /><br />The living matrix is not just a movie. It opens doors fro discussion and research on this vast topic of ‘new biology’. However, this is the first of its kind as two important books have been written on the related topics that facilitate understanding of this movie in a better way. ‘The field’ and ‘the biology of belief’ are the two that discuss new science and tend to unveil the mysteries in genetics. <br /><br />It is not necessary that every film is based on some kind of physical happening. This movie ‘the living matrix’ opens new opportunities in the field of health and biology that will certainly lead to some major improvement in the future. Nature has got so many surprises in it that it seems our research about it will never come to an end.

It considers all subjective experiences to arise from physical matter and consciousness is considered a by product resulting from the processes of brain and body. The claim a complicated relationship between the physical and non physical happenings and tend to make use of the scientific techniques to analyze and understand the subjective experiences. The possible impacts of consciousness on the physical happenings are also studied. <br /><br />This is a growing field of study that is trying to resolve complicated mysteries of the human thinking and the role of consciousness in material world. <br /><br />Noetics in the modern era<br />The understanding of subjective experiences and their impact on the physical happenings is one of the hot scientific researches today. This is not a new one as the abilities of mind and its complex processes have always been an area of interest for the scientist. The modern day Noetic science is a complete discipline which is based on the study of consciousness and importance of subjective experiences. A major modern day study, known as theory of Noetics, was proposed by Richard L. Amoroso, director Noetic advanced studies institute. He proposed that there is another causal principle of purposefulness that has nothing to do with the ordinary matter but is one among the major cosmological principles of consciousness. The major part of this theory is that it considers mind and thoughts as tangible things. According to him, the mind and consciousness can be described in quantitative terms by making use of formulae applicable to quantum things for example light.  <br /><br />Noetic science, as proposed by the institute of Noetic sciences, is another theory that provides evidence and explanation of Noetics. This theory combines the subjective and objective understanding to interpret the happenings in physical world. It must be mentioned here that spirituality is not likely to be related to any one religion. It is a kind of inner awareness that leads one to discover the ultimate reality of this universe and living. <br /><br />Another aspect of the question, what is spirituality is the spiritual path. Spirituality is actually a journey of a person towards a better understanding and achievement of the goals like awareness, perfection, wisdom and connection with the God. The things required to keep moving on this path are prayers, meditation and sometimes spiritual transmission from a preceptor. <br /><br />Science also seems to consider this question, what is spirituality and has a relationship with it and the religion that is complicated. The discoveries of science are in connection with religious and spirituals truths about nature and it does prove the religious claims. But it is a fact that exploring the mysteries of spirituality with the help of science is not possible. It is highly based on deep subjective experiences that go far beyond the scope of conventional science. <br /><br />Everyone will have a different opinion on the topic, ‘what is spirituality’? This is because of the diverse beliefs and attitudes of people. <br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5saWZleHBlcnQuY29tL3NwZWNpYWwvbm9ldGljX3NjaWVuY2UuaHRtbA__" target="_blank">learn about noetics</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2xpZmV4cGVydC5jb20_" target="_blank">noetic science experiments</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5saWZleHBlcnQuY29tLw__" target="_blank">noetic - lifeexpert.com</a>

However, this modern day study of complicated experiences is known as ‘Noetic science’ and this term was first used by Edgar Mitchell, an astronaut on Apollo 14 who was the sixth man that walked on the moon. He, upon his trip back to earth, had experienced a sense of connectedness in the universe. He claimed to have a feeling that universe is not just an incidental creation. This led him to believe that reality of life is not as simple as it is explained by the conventional scientific studies. He believed that the actual study of reality is possible only if consciousness is studied deeply. Subjective and objective approaches of understanding act as equals and eventually lead to a better understanding of some miraculous creation. Most recently, this term has been used by the famous author Dan Brown is his publication, The Lost Symbol. <br /><br />The whole study of Noetic science revolves around one statement that is, ‘consciousness matters’. Consciousness here refers to awareness that is how a person makes use of his subjective experiences to understand and analyze the beliefs, emotions, attitudes and intention. They tend to explain why, how and when is it possible. The living matrix is one such movie that has gained significant attraction after its release.

This is not a new one as the abilities of mind and its complex processes have always been an area of interest for the scientist. The modern day Noetic science is a complete discipline which is based on the study of consciousness and importance of subjective experiences. The term Noetic was first used by Greek philosophers and it means ‘mental’ and ‘perception with mind’. This has been known as a field of study related to metaphysical philosophy that is involved in investigating mind and intellect. The historical evidence shows a complete study of this topic on philosophical grounds and includes two major doctrines, the agent/patient intellect by Aristotle and divine intellect by Plotinus. These classical philosophies provide a clear understanding of something over and above the physical and material world and explain the existence and use of mind with all its subjective powers. <br /><br />However today, things have changed and this is no more a topic of philosophy. Throughout the history, this term, Noetics has been used to explain topics like consciousness, spirituality and mind power. A major modern day study, known as theory of Noetics, was proposed by Richard L. Amoroso, director Noetic advanced studies institute. He proposed that there is another causal principle of purposefulness that has nothing to do with the ordinary matter but is one among the major cosmological principles of consciousness. The major part of this theory is that it considers mind and thoughts as tangible things. According to him, the mind and consciousness can be described in quantitative terms by making use of formulae applicable to quantum things for example light.  <br /><br />Noetic science, as proposed by the institute of Noetic sciences, is another theory that provides evidence and explanation of Noetics. This theory combines the subjective and objective understanding to interpret the happenings in physical world. The living matrix is one such movie that has gained significant attraction after its release. Since it covers a unique topic of energy healing, it is getting a mixed kind of response from viewers. <br /><br />The topic covered in the movie is not a pure science fiction. It is actually based on the complex set of factors that are supposed to determine the health. It does not cover genetics but makes use of the human physiology and bio chemistry. The movie advances with interviews from experts of the field. The interviews are coupled with illustrated dramatized videos that show how some people had recovered from chronic illnesses. The movie includes the story of a five year old who was suffering from cerebral palsy. The other cases include a doctor with brain tumor and housewife with fatigue syndrome. <br /><br />The living matrix is not just a movie. It opens doors fro discussion and research on this vast topic of ‘new biology’. However, this is the first of its kind as two important books have been written on the related topics that facilitate understanding of this movie in a better way. <br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2xpZmV4cGVydC5jb20_" target="_blank">watch what the bleep do we know review</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5saWZleHBlcnQuY29tL3NwZWNpYWwvbm9ldGljX3NjaWVuY2UuaHRtbA__" target="_blank">noetic science experiments</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5saWZleHBlcnQuY29tL2FydGljbGVzLw__" target="_blank">noetics articles</a>
