<br />But linger by some frozen lake
<br />This most romantic time of year.
<br />I sometimes give my head a shake
<br />And ask if there is some mistake.
<br />It's lonely out here 'mid the sweep
<br />Of bitter wind and icy flake.
<br />My love for you is dark and deep,
<br />But it's a promise I will keep
<br />As from afar I watch and weep,
<br />As from afar I watch and weep
<br /><br />LOVE ME XXXX

<br />Sometimes in life, you find a special friend; 
<br />Someone who changes your life 
<br />just by being part of it. 
<br />Someone who makes you laugh 
<br />until you can't stop; 
<br />Someone who makes you believe 
<br />that there really is good in the world. 
<br />Someone who convinces you 
<br />that there really is an unlocked door 
<br />just waiting for you to open it. 
<br /><br />Always try to help a friend in need 
<br /><br />Believe in yourself 
<br /><br />Be brave...but it's ok to be afraid sometimes 
<br /><br />Study hard 
<br /><br />Give lots of kisses 
<br /><br />Laugh often 
<br /><br />Don't be overly concerned with your weight, it's
<br />just a number 
<br /><br />Always try to see the glass half full 
<br /><br />Meet new people, even if they look different to
<br />you 
<br /><br />Remain calm, even when it seems hopeless 
<br /><br />Take lots of naps.. 
<br /><br />Be weird whenever you have the chance 
<br /><br />Love your friends, no matter who they are 
<br /><br />Don't waste food 
<br /><br />RELAX 
<br /><br />Take an occasional risk 
<br /><br />Try to have a little fun each day.
<br />...it's important 
<br /><br />Work together as a team 
<br /><br />Share a joke with friends 
<br /><br />Fall in love with someone.. 
<br /><br />...and say &quot;I love you&quot; often 
<br /><br />Express yourself creatively 
<br /><br />Be conscious of your appearance 
<br /><br />Always be up for surprises 
<br /><br />Love someone with all of your heart 
<br /><br />Share with friends 
<br /><br />Watch your step 
<br /><br />It will get better 
<br /><br />There is always someone who loves you more than
<br />you know 
<br /><br />Exercise to keep fit 
<br /><br />Live up to your name 
<br /><br />Seize the Moment 
<br /><br />Hold on to good friends; they are few and far
<br />between 
<br /><br />Indulge in the things you truly love 
<br /><br />Cherish every Sunday 
<br /><br />At the end of the day... PRAY 
<br /><br />....... and close your eyes
<br /><br />And smile at least once a day!

<br />on the same night.
<br /><br />2. Don't worry about what people think, they don't do it very often.
<br /><br />3. Going to church doesn't make you a Christian anymore than standing in
<br />a garage makes you a car.
<br /><br />4. Artificial intelligence is no match for natural stupidity.
<br /><br />5. If you must choose between two evils, pick the one you've never tried
<br />before.
<br /><br />6. My idea of housework is to sweep the room with a glance.
<br /><br />7. Not one shred of evidence supports the notion that life is serious.
<br /><br />8. A person, who is nice to you, but rude to the waiter, is not a nice
<br />person. (This is very important. Pay attention! It never fails.)
<br /><br />9. For every action, there is an equal and opposite government program.
<br /><br />10. If you look like your passport picture, you probably need the trip.
<br /><br />11. Bills travel through the mail at twice the speed of checks.
<br /><br />12. A conscience is what hurts when all of your other parts feel so good.
<br /><br />13. Eat well, stay fit, die anyway.
<br /><br />14. Men are from earth. Women are from earth. Deal with it.
<br /><br />15. No man has ever been shot while doing the dishes.
<br /><br />16. A balanced diet is a cookie in each hand.
<br /><br />17. Middle age is when broadness of the mind and narrowness of the waist
<br />change places.
<br /><br />18. Opportunities always look bigger going than coming.
<br /><br />19. Junk is something you've kept for years and throw away three weeks
<br />before you need it.
<br /><br />20. There is always one more imbecile than you counted on.
<br /><br />21. Experience is a wonderful thing. It enables you to recognize a
<br />mistake when you make it again.
<br /><br />22. By the time you can make ends meet, they move the ends.
<br /><br />23. Thou shalt not weigh more than thy refrigerator.
<br /><br />24. Someone who thinks logically provides a nice contrast to the real
<br />world.
<br /><br />25. It ain't the jeans that make your butt look fat.
<br /><br />26. If you had to identify, in 1 word, the reason why the human race has
<br />not achieved, &amp; never will achieve, its full potential, that word would
<br />be &quot;meetings.&quot;
<br /><br />27. There is a very fine line between &quot;hobby&quot; and &quot;mental illness.&quot;
<br /><br />28. People who want to share their religious views with you almost never
<br />want you to share yours with them.
<br /><br />29. You should not confuse your career with your life.
<br /><br />30. Nobody cares if you can't dance well. Just get up and dance.
<br /><br />31. Never lick a steak knife.
<br /><br />32. The most destructive force in the universe is gossip.
<br /><br />33. You will never find anybody who can give you a clear and compelling
<br />reason why we observe daylight savings time.
<br /><br />34. You should never say anything to a woman that even remotely suggests
<br />that you think she's pregnant unless you can see an actual baby emerging
<br />from her at that moment.
<br /><br />35. There comes a time when you should stop expecting other people to
<br />make a big deal about your birthday. That time is age eleven.
<br /><br />36. The one thing that unites all human beings, regardless of age,
<br />gender, religion, economic status or ethnic background, is that, deep
<br />down inside, we ALL believe that we are above average drivers.
<br /><br />37. Your friends love you anyway.
<br /><br />38. Thought for the day: Never be afraid to try something new. Remember
<br />that a lone amateur built the Ark. A large group of professionals built
<br />the Titanic.
<br /><br />39. Never assume malice, when stupidity would explain it.
<br /><br />40. Never assume stupidity, it might be a misunderstanding.

<br />all numbered '1' ON PURPOSE!
<br /><br />1. Learn to work the toilet seat. You're a big girl. If it's up, put it down. We need it up, you need it down. You don't hear us complaining about you leaving it down.
<br /><br />1. Shopping is NOT a sport. And no, we are never going to think of it that way.
<br /><br />1. Crying is blackmail.
<br /><br />1. Ask for what you want. Let us be clear on this one: Subtle hints do not work! Strong hints do not work! Obvious hints do not work! Just say it!
<br /><br />1. Yes, and No are perfectly acceptable answers to almost every question.
<br /><br />1. Come to us with a problem only if you want help solving it. That's what we do. Sympathy is what your girlfriends are for.
<br /><br />1. A headache that lasts for 17 months is a problem. See a doctor.
<br /><br />1. Anything we said 6 months ago is inadmissible in an argument. In fact, all comments become null and void after 7 days.
<br /><br />1. If you won't dress like the Victoria's Secret girls, don't expect us to act like soap opera guys.
<br /><br />1. If you think you're fat, you probably are. Don't ask us.
<br /><br />1. If something we said can be interpreted two ways, and one of the ways makes you sad or angry, we meant the other one.
<br /><br />1. You can either ask us to do something or tell us how you want it done. Not both. If you already know best how to do it, just do it yourself.
<br /><br />1. Whenever possible, please say whatever you have to say during commercials.
<br /><br />1. Christopher Columbus did not need directions and neither do we.
<br /><br />1. ALL men see in only 16 colors, like Windows default settings. Peach, for example, is a fruit, not a color. Pumpkin is also a fruit. We have
<br />no idea what mauve is.
<br /><br />1. If it itches, it will be scratched. We do that.
<br /><br />1. If we ask what is wrong and you say &quot;nothing,&quot; we will act like nothing's wrong. We know you are lying, but it is just not worth
<br />the hassle.
<br /><br />1. If you ask a question you don't want an answer to, expect an answer you don't want to hear.
<br /><br />1. When we have to go somewhere, absolutely anything you wear is fine. Really.
<br /><br />1. Don't ask us what we're thinking about unless you are prepared to discuss such topics as baseball, the shotgun formation, or monster
<br />trucks.
<br /><br />1. You have enough clothes.
<br /><br />1. You have too many shoes.
<br /><br />1. I am in shape. Round is a shape.
<br /><br />1. Thank you for reading this; Yes, I know, I have to sleep on the couch tonight, but did you know men really don't mind that, it's like
<br />camping.

<br />just wants him to call.
<br /><br />To every girl who lies
<br />awake at night thinking about him.
<br /><br />To every girl that
<br />just wants to cuddle.
<br /><br />To every girl that
<br />just wants to sleep with him without doing anything.

<br />she cares and gets nothing back.
<br /><br />To every girl that thought
<br />'maybe this one could be the one'.
<br /><br />To every girl that laughs at stupid stuff

<br /><br />To every girl who wants
<br />words backed up with actions.
<br /><br />To every girl that fell for all the lies
<br />only to find themselves alone in the end.
<br /><br />To every girl that gave her heart away
<br />to have it shoved back in her face.
<br /><br />TO EVERY GIRL THAT DOES NOT WANT TO BE LED ON WHEN HE LIKES YOU AND ANOTHER GIRL AND YOU JUST WISHES HE WOULD TELL YOU IF HE REALLY LIKES YOU AND NOT THE OTHER GIRL!!
<br /><br />To every girl that has faith that 'tomorrow will be a better day.'
<br /><br />And it will be. Trust me.
