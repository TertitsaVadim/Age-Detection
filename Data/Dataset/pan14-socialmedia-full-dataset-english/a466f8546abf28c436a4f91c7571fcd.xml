<br /><br />Smoking is a killer, and most people know that by now. But rather than look at the horrible effects of smoking, it might help to look at the positive effects of quitting. Many smokers resign themselves to poor health and a likely early death, but if you quit now, you can add many years to your life and the benefits start almost immediately.

<br />Smokers get pretty sick of hearing how bad smoking tobacco is for their health. At some point, it doesn't even seem to make an impression. It's like the message is so continuously sent that it becomes white noise. Of course smoking is very bad for you, and one of the major problems is the tar created when tobacco is burned. Many people find that their health improves when they switch to electronic cigarettes. But there haven't been sufficient studies to show that it truly is healthy to use ecigarettes. However, there are some obvious benefits of switching that aren't even related to health.

<br /><br />The Utah State Senate has passed an indoor smoking ban that will expand current law to e-cigarettes as well as hookah bars. The Indoor Clear Air Act, the Utah law prohibiting indoor smoking, specifically bans the ignition of tobacco. This left room for hookah bars, which heat tobacco to high temperatures then pass the smoke through water, to continue to operate indoors. Naturally, since e-cigarettes do not contain tobacco electronic cigarettes were also excluded from the law. But in March of this year, House Bill 245 (HB245) was passed to specifically include both hookahs and electric cigarettes.

Quit Smoking!<br/><br/><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.realelectroniccigarettes.com%2FWant-to-Save-Money-Quit-Smoking_b_15.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.realelectroniccigarettes.com/Want-to-Save-Money-Quit-Smoking_b_15.html</a>
<br /><br />Yes, smoking is bad for your health. Yes, smoking is bad for the health of those around you. But have you ever thought about how much it costs to keep smoking? For a medium to heavy smoker, the monthly cost of keeping up the habit is probably in the hundreds of dollars range. Even if you spent $100 a month, that is an extra $1200 per year that you could use for way more fun things. For that amount of money, you could go on a small vacation.

<br /><br />It turns out that the physical addiction to nicotine isn't the toughest addiction to beat. Most smokers find that they miss smoking even if they quit twenty or thirty years ago. When you give yourself a cigarette break, you are allowing yourself to go outside, take a break, and give yourself some time. That little ritual is so addictive that smokers who have been smoking for many years find that they cannot quit, even with nicotine patches or nicotine gum. But it looks like with electronic cigarettes, smokers may have found a way to trick themselves.

<br /><br />A customer called the other day wanting to know which window treatment colors we would recommend for a peaceful vibe in her Hawaii vacation condo. She wanted to make her small condo seem spacious and relaxing. Whether you are fortunate enough to live in Hawaii all the time, or you have a vacation property there, creating a relaxing island retreat is the goal. Designers know that color is often the key to a restful room, and natural color palettes are a designer favorite.

<br /><br />Vertical window blinds and horizontal window blinds are effective at reducing summer heat. On hot summer days, close window coverings on the east, west, and south-facing windows to keep out the sun's rays. You can keep the blinds on the north side open if desired because they do not get direct sun in summer, assuming you're in the northern hemisphere. Further, window treatments with a light-colored backing help reflect the sun's heat back outside.

<br /><br />It used to be that being eco-friendly meant emptying your pocketbook. But as companies have wised up, they are finding that affordable window blinds bring them more customers, meaning prices are lower than ever, and the styles are endless. However, be choosy and try to get the very best that you can afford, as quality parts and materials last longer, which means they break less and won't get thrown in the trash, and they'll be worth your investment.

<br /><br />While there is plenty of room for more research into the effects of electronic cigarette vapor, we can already see how it compares to smoking tobacco smoke. Now that cigarette smoke has been studied extensively and links between smoking and deadly diseases have been established, we can analyze what it is about smoking that does damage.

<br /><br />Smoking cigarettes is one of the most dangerous things that you can do. Smoking is so incredibly addictive that smokers essentially brain wash themselves into thinking they are different from the statistics. But some smokers still think they should be able to smoke indoors and in public places without restrictions. Why? Because the government shouldn't have control over what a person does with their own body.

<br /><br />As a designer, I get asked this question a lot. &quot;What's the difference between blinds and shades? Aren't they the same thing?&quot; Many people use the words blinds and shades interchangeably and regionally, some people use just one word or the other. For example, our Midwest and Michigan customers seem to prefer the word blind. But, in fact, window blinds and shades are not the same thing. Blinds are &quot;hard&quot; window coverings with slats or vanes that can tilt to control the amount of light you let into a room and also allow a certain degree of view to the outside, even when lowered. Wood blinds and faux wood blinds fall into this category.
