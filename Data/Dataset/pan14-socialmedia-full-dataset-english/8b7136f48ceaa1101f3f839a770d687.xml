<br /><br />Strong management teams are the foundation of Bradley Associates’ investment strategy.
<br /><br />When we invest, we look for management partners who have a proven track record in building a company, and a clear vision for taking that company to the next level.
<br /><br />Over the past 20 years, our investment partnerships have taken many forms:
<br /><br />We’ve partnered with families to help them sell all or part of their business, to solve succession problems, or to raise money for expansion.
<br />We’ve helped entrepreneurial management teams buy out corporate divisions and set them up as independent companies.
<br />We’ve provided growth capital to help businesses acquire complementary products and services, or to scale their operation domestically or internationally.
<br />We’ve taken public companies private, and allowed management to build long-term company value, without having to answer to the quarterly demands of Wall Street.
<br />We’ve recapitalized companies, helping them rebuild and reposition themselves for greater success going forward.
<br />Every Investment is Different
<br /><br />The role Bradley Associates plays varies accordingly. Helping a family through the emotional process of selling a long-cherished business can be a far more delicate process than a corporate buyout. Transforming a subsidiary into a standalone firm might require substantial involvement on our part. In other investments, our involvement might be minimal. Sometimes we are the controlling party.
<br /><br />Our approach is flexible, guided always by the needs and goals of our management partners.

<br />WASHINGTON – The current strong gains in hiring makes the Federal Reserve policymakers worried that it could buzz if the economic growth of the US doesn’t go up.
<br /><br />According to the Fed’s minutes on Tuesday, members were first stated their concerns before they make a plan to keep interest rates at record lows until at least late year 2014. However, some of the members want to take further procedures to improve the economy current status if a condition gets worse or inflation remains reclaimed.
<br /><br />After the meeting, Fed presented the somewhat current view of the economy mainly because of the three consecutive months of hiring in two years. It was concluded that there have been similar raptures of hiring in the previous two years which ended up fading.
<br /><br />On the speech echoed by the Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke last week in the economists gathering, the decline of the economy recovery was the main concern of Fed as it did last year.
<br /><br />Americans aren’t receiving meaningful pay augmentation. Gas prices are high. Additionally, Europe’s debt crisis could reflect on the U.S economy. Provided that the inflation will remain on its current position, analysts think that the Fed will likely give interest rates down in order for them to give the economy an additional support. Most of the economists don’t think that Fed officials will alter their interest-rate policy at their following meeting on April 24-25 and will only relieve credits if the economy gradually moves from its current status.
<br /><br />The economy outlook is going up. Employers added an average of 245,000 jobs a month from December through February. On the other side, the rate of unemployed dropped nearly to 8.3%. The government will report Friday on the job market in March. Most of the economists supposed that the report will give a better month of job creation with a net gain of 210,000 jobs. They also expect that the unemployment rate will remain at 8.3%.

<br />February 15, 2012 – LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA – (Kazor.com) – Britain is once again suffering a recession and unemployment risks coming close into three million this year as forecasted by the leading economic forecaster. The UK’s economic recovery is ‘paralyzed’ by Europe’s debt crisis, the Ernst &amp; Young Item club will warn, as it cut its GDP growth forecast from 1.5 per cent to 0.2 per cent. According to Eldridge Financial Blog, the dire prediction comes after nine European countries including France, have had their credit ratings downgraded on Friday, dropping world stock markets into turmoil.
<br />Economists had hoped that exports and business investment would strengthen the economy this year, with public and consumerspending still in the doldrums. Nevertheless, Europe accounts for more than 40 percent of British trade and business confidence has been roughly hit by insecurity about the future of the Continent and the single currency. On Eldridge Financial Blog in the Sunday Telegraph quoted Professor Peter Spencer, chief economist at the Item Club, as saying: ‘Figures for the last quarter of 2011 and the first quarter of this year are likely to show that we are back in recession, and we are going to have to wait until summer before there are signs of improvement. Although he said the double dip was unlikely to be prolonged, he warned that unemployment was nevertheless likely to hit three million by early next year. Figures set for release on Wednesday are expected to show the jobless figures continued to rise in the three months up until the end of November. Professor Spencer admitted that the Item Club’s predictions were based on positive assumptions about European policymakers’ ability to keep the euro zone from falling apart. The longer the uncertainty continues, the more debilitating the impact will be on the UK’s economic prospects, he added. The European Commission vice-president for economic affairs, Olli Rehn, yesterday attacked the decision by Standard &amp; Poor’s to cut down the credit ratings of so many European countries.
<br />The downgrades were ‘inconsistent’, claiming that the euro zone was taking ‘decisive action’ over the economic crisis.

<br />JEDDAH: A prestigious forum is being held in Jeddah today to help women in the Kingdom to improve their understanding of real estate investments, focusing particularly on the British market.
<br /><br />It will take place at Dar Al-Hekma College, a private, non-profit institution of higher education for women.
<br /><br />&quot;This is the first of its kind event in Saudi Arabia. This is an educational initiative to equip Saudi women with a tool to invest in real estate in the UK,&quot; said Azeemeh Zaheer, vice president of London-based Gatehouse Bank and a key presenter at the special forum.
<br /><br />Gatehouse, a Shariah-compliant bank, is holding the event in partnership with CBRE.
<br /><br />&quot;Saudi women getting more and more involved in wealth management. This is a big change compared to five to 10 years ago,&quot; Azeemeh told Arab News yesterday.
<br /><br />She said: &quot;Women control 22 percent of the $7 trillion assets under management in the Middle East. This makes them an extremely influential investor group.&quot;
<br /><br />Azeemeh added: &quot;These women are an inspiring segment of the business and investor landscape. At the forum, we hope to give them a solid understanding of what real estate investment can do for them - to generate and preserve their wealth for the benefit of their family and their own well being. Helping boost their long-term wealth preservation, while observing their specific needs for security and safety in financial products that appeal to their risk appetite.&quot;
<br /><br />She said: &quot;As a Shariah-compliant bank, Gatehouse has gained extensive working experience in the GCC and over time we have developed a deep network of relationships with an increasing number of professional women clients.&quot;
<br /><br />Azeemeh said Muna AbuSulayman, a leading Saudi figure and Arab media personality in the Middle East, is a keynote speaker at the forum.
<br /><br />Leadership ME was conducted in collaboration with CBRE, a Fortune 500 and S&amp;P 500 company that is the world's largest commercial real estate services firm.
<br /><br />Karen Queen, executive director of capital markets at CBRE, another presenter at the forum, said: &quot;We are pleased to be partnering with Gatehouse and Dar Al-Hekma at this inspiring forum for women in Jeddah to discuss real estate fundamentals.&quot;
<br /><br />She said: &quot;London and the UK remain an attractive location for real estate investment, and characteristically more than a large percent of potential investors believe that the UK was the best place to spend their money. We acknowledge that women will continue to play an influential role as part of this landscape, and our aim is to empower them with more insights and information to help them access opportunities for wealth creation and preservation.&quot;
<br /><br />Queen said the Middle East investors have invested 4.2 billion euros in the UK property market in 2011.
<br /><br />&quot;The half of the total investment in the UK property market came from non-European buyers,&quot; she pointed out.
<br /><br />&quot;The major investment came from North America and a large sum came from the Middle East. The major non-European buyers into the UK property market include North America (over 13 billion euros), Asia (5 billion euros), and Australia (0.9 billion euros),&quot; Queen added.
<br /><br />Azeemeh said Gatehouse Bank provides Shariah-compliant financing for real estate transactions.
<br /><br />She said Gatehouse Bank were actively realizing business in the Saudi, most recently, working with a CMA regulated Shariah-compliant financial services company based in Saudi Arabia, Sidra Capital to launch a 100 million-pound real estate fund called &quot;SURF&quot;.
<br /><br />On the UK real estate market, Queen said: &quot;Women are looking for safe havens and the UK is ultimate safe place for commercial real estate. The market is transparent and the tax system is flexible.&quot;
<br /><br />Dar Al-Hekma College will be hosting this forum for business students, alumni, and professional working women. The forum will help attendees gain knowledge on ways of improving their understanding of real estate investment fundamentals, and specifically learning how to invest in dynamic markets of London and the UK.

<br /><br />Manufacturing numbers from the US, China and Germany expected the renewing optimism for the global economic outlook and encouraging investors to take on risk. Early in the afternoon trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.16 percent, the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 Index gained 1.24 percent and the Nasdaq Composite Index climbed 1.32 percent. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index wrecked the session with a 2 percent increase. The euro also gained, strengthening 0.8 percent to US$1.3194 and 0.7 percent to 100.52 yen. An index of the US manufacturing sector rose in January to its maximum level since June, while China’s factory sector unexpectedly stretched out. In Europe, Germany posted its first increase in <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fmicronassociates.org%2Fnews%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://micronassociates.org/news/</a> manufacturing output in four months while a UK manufacturing gauge climbed to an eight-month high. John Manley, chief quity strategist at Wells Fargo Funds Management in New York told Reuters told that “Manufacturing numbers are what the market is jumping on”. Some strategists are updating their bearish forecasts to mirror a better-than-expected start to 2012. Just two weeks after saying that investors should “remain cautious,” Larry Hatheway, the chief economist at UBS, raised his recommendations on global shares and high-yield bonds in a January 23 note to customers entitled, “Wrong, but not too late,” Bloomberg News reported. Royal Bank of Scotland Group, and Benoit Anne, the global head of emerging-markets strategy at Societe Generale said their estimates for developing nations were proven wrong. Financial shares were among the leading <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fmicronassociates.org%2Fnews%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://micronassociates.org/news/</a> gainers including Morgan Stanley which rose nearly 7 percent amid talk that Facebook will choose the firm to take the lead on its planned initial public offering. More details are expected later today. The latest round of US earnings included solid numbers for Whirlpool as its upbeat outlook for the full year lifted its stock more than 15 percent. It wasn’t all good news, however. Shares of Amazon tanked, dropping more than 9 percent a day after the online retailer warned of a possible first-quarter loss. And the latest data on the jobs front in the US fell short of expectations, as the private sector added 170,000 jobs in January, according to the ADP National Employment Report. Economists’ had called for a gain of 185,000 jobs, according to Reuters. Investors will eye the US government labour market report due on Friday for further clues. It’s expected to show the economy created 150,000 jobs, and a gain in private payrolls of 170,000, according to Reuters data.”The overall economy lacks oomph and is having trouble creating jobs. Manufacturing is one of the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fmicronassociates.org%2Fnews%2Ffew"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://micronassociates.org/news/few</a> bright spots in an otherwise disappointing story,” Cary Leahey, managing director at Decision Economics, told Reuters.
