<br />Girl: &quot;Can we do what?&quot;
<br />Guy: &quot;You know, can I be your first, finally?&quot;
<br />Girl: &quot;Um.....no.&quot;
<br />Guy: &quot;Why?&quot;
<br />Girl: &quot;Because, 1. you have a girlfriend, who happens to be my friend.......&quot;
<br />Guy: &quot;So, if you don't tell, I won' tell.&quot;
<br />Girl: &quot;Besides that, I'm waiting for someone special. Someone that I want to be with for the rest of my life to be my first.&quot;
<br />Guy: &quot;I'm not special to you?&quot;
<br />Girl: &quot;You're my friend. That's all.&quot;
<br />Guy looks forward and keeps driving. 5 minutes pass....... Guy starts to run his hand up the girl's thigh.
<br />Girl: moves his hand, &quot;Don't touch me!&quot;
<br />Guy: tries to kiss her.
<br />Girl: screams, &quot;Would you stop.&quot;
<br />Guy: continues trying.
<br />Girl: moves to the back seat
<br />Guy: parks on an abandoned street and gets in the backseat with the girl
<br />Starts to kiss her..
<br />Girl: pushes him off and scoots over, &quot;Please, don't do this.&quot;
<br />Guy: &quot;Don't do what, I know you want it, I can see it in your eyes.&quot;
<br />Moves over to her and starts to unbutton her pants.
<br />Girl: pushes him harder and says, &quot;No, don't.&quot;
<br />Guy: getting aggravated, punches her and tells her to stop &quot;playing hard to get&quot;.
<br />Girl: crying, continues to fight.
<br />Guy: punches her harder, pulls her pants off, and holds her down.
<br />Girl: screams as he penetrates her, &quot;NO, please don't do this to me!&quot;
<br />Guy: puts his hand over her mouth.
<br />An hour passes.........
<br />Guy: pulls back and wipes himself off.
<br />Girl: sits on the corner of the seat, sobbing.
<br />Guy: looks at her and says, &quot;You better not tell anybody about this. If you're really my friend, you won't tell anybody. You know I love you.&quot; He reaches out his hand to touch her cheek.
<br />Girl: pulls back, &quot;Just take me home, now.&quot;
<br />Guy: says, &quot;Alright.&quot; Gets in the front seat and drives her home.
<br />2 months later.........
<br />Girl: &quot;Doctor, what's wrong with me. I haven't had my time of the month in 2 months.&quot;
<br />Doctor: looks at her, &quot;You haven't been having your &quot;time&quot; for a reason.&quot;
<br />Girl: looks at him and says, &quot;Why?&quot; dreading the answer that she was sure to receive.
<br />Doctor: &quot;You are pregnant.&quot;
<br />Girl: faints.
<br /><br />The story gets out that she is pregnant, and people start looking to the guy. He claims that it isn't his because she was sleeping with every guy in the school(which was a lie). He goes to her and tells her, &quot;I'm telling you, if you lie to people and say that I raped you, I'll kill you.&quot;
<br /><br />The Girl is completely devastated. First, he took her virginity and got her pregnant....then he lied about it. So completely depressed......the girl commits suicide by drug overdose.......
<br />Girls, if this story touched you, repost it as &quot;That's Fucked up&quot;
<br />Guys, if this story touched you, repost it as &quot;I'll kill any fucker who does this&quot; if you care

<br />u.....you're
<br />heartless...for sure
<br /><br />One night a guy &amp; a girl were driving
<br />home from the movies. The boy sensed
<br />there was something wrong because of
<br />the painful silence they shared
<br />between them that night. The girl then
<br />asked the boy to pull over because she
<br />wanted to talk. She told him that her
<br />feelings had changed &amp; that it was
<br />time to move on. A silent tear slid
<br />down his cheek as he slowly reached
<br />into his pocket &amp; passed her a folded
<br />note. At that moment, a drunk driver
<br />was speeding down that very same
<br />street. He swerved right into the
<br />drivers seat, killing the boy.
<br />Miraculously, the girl survived.
<br />Remembering the note, she pulled it
<br />out &amp; read it.
<br />&quot;Without your love, I would die.&quot;
<br /><br />1st: If u post this on a bulletin in 5
<br />minutes someone special will message
<br />or call you.
<br /><br />2nd: REPOST IF YOU CARE ABOUT SOMEONE
<br />SO MUCH THAT YOU CANT LIVE WITHOUT

<br /><br />I am the girl kicked out of her home because I confided in my mother that I am a lesbian.
<br /><br />I am the prostitute working the streets because nobody will hire a transsexual woman.
<br /><br />I am the sister who holds her gay brother tight through the painful, tear-filled nights.
<br /><br />We are the parents who buried our daughter long before her time.
<br /><br />I am the man who died alone in the hospital because they would not let my partner of twenty-seven years into the room.
<br /><br />I am the foster child who wakes up with nightmares of being taken away from the two fathers who are the only loving family I have ever had. I wish they could adopt me.
<br /><br />I am one of the lucky ones, I guess. I survived the attack that left me in a coma for three weeks, and in another year I will probably be able to walk again.
<br /><br />I am not one of the lucky ones. I killed myself just weeks before graduating high school. It was simply too much to bear.
<br /><br />We are the couple who had the realtor hang up on us when she found out we wanted to rent a one-bedroom for two men.
<br /><br />I am the person who never knows which bathroom I should use if I want to avoid getting the management called on me.
<br /><br />I am the mother who is not allowed to even visit the children I bore, nursed, and raised. The court says I am an unfit mother because I now live with another woman.
<br /><br />I am the domestic-violence survivor who found the support system grow suddenly cold and distant when they found out my abusive partner is also a woman.
<br /><br />I am the domestic-violence survivor who has no support system to turn to because I am male.
<br /><br />I am the father who has never hugged his son because I grew up afraid to show affection to other men.
<br /><br />I am the home-economics teacher who always wanted to teach gym until someone told me that only lesbians do that.
<br /><br />I am the man who died when the paramedics stopped treating me as soon as they realized I was transsexual.
<br /><br />I am the person who feels guilty because I think I could be a much better person if I didnâ€™t have to always deal with society hating me.
<br /><br />I am the man who stopped attending church, not because I don't believe, but because they closed their doors to my kind.
<br /><br />I am the person who has to hide what this world needs most: love.
<br /><br />If you believe that homophobia is wrong, copy and re post this into your blog.
