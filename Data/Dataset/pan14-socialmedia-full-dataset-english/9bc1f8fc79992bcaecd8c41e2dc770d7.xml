The car, not surprisingly, is going to be a relation from that day on! In the event the feeling of joy is quite like bringing the baby home, the pain involved in selecting the right car is no less than the delivery pain! The market is chock-a-bloc which has a billion models with a trillion functions. To add to the confusion, the dealers beckon you invitingly with mouth-watering offers. They will try to help entice you with discounts with insurance, low interest rates and adjustable EMIs (Equated Monthly installments or simply installments for the uninitiated).<br /><br />&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Ft1.gstatic.com%2Fimages%3Fq%3Dtbn%3AANd9GcTslNiK2OKBgCAnwYglBxlPhSYkCkQ5XlirTVJg68FVcHyhKCVWSA"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://t1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTslNiK2OKBgCAnwYglBxlPhSYkCkQ5XlirTVJg68FVcHyhKCVWSA</a>]&lt;/center&gt;<br /><br />If you want to avoid the pitfalls involved in buying a car and getting trapped and dealing with something you did not want in the beginning, there are a few preparatory steps you might want to take. First of all, have a seat and note down your needs. Is it your first car or your second car? If it is a second car, probably you need lesser features and it's going to be more for your daily use of shopping and marketing. You also need to be very sure of your allowance. Once in the market to buy a car, it is very simple to get carried away with the offers available. Once you are sure of what you want and how much you are able to afford, the clutter is removed and your search is narrowed down to a few models. It is then easier that you take a test drive and settle for the one that suits you best.<br /><br />Car financing is another aspect that is to be taken into account. There are plenty of deals available on various terms and conditions. You may like to go in for a loan as it means deferred payment of present drinking, which is definitely lighter over the pocket, although in the long run you may end up paying more with interest.The choice, ultimately, is yours.<br /><br />Click here To know more about &lt;b&gt;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5maW5kdGhlYmVzdGNhcnByaWNlLmNvbS8_" target="_blank">buy a car</a>&lt;/b&gt;.
