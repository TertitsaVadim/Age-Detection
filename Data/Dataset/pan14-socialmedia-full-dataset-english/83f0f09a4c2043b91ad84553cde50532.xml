A young couple had gotten married on Halloween. Around midnight, they were riding in a horse drawn carriage across the bridge at the same time a car was. The bridge was only one lane, so by the time they saw each other it was too late. Story has it that they crashed and the hubcap of the car flew off, decapitating the bride. The police never found her head or the body of the groom. Its been said that if you sit on the bridge on Halloween night around midnight, you can see the headless bride standing on some rocks in the river. However they don't know if she is looking for her head or her lost love

<br /><br />All of my answers were accurate. We'll see tomorrow if the wish comes true. I'll let you know. Take 3 minutes and try this...it will freak you out! The person who sent it to me said her wish came true stright after they tryed it. BUT NO CHEATING! This game has a funny/spooky/true outcome.
<br /><br />Don't read ahead...just do it in order! It takes about three minutes...it's worth a try 
<br /><br />First..get a pen and paper. When you actually choose names, make sure it's people you actually know and go with your first instinct.
<br /><br />Scroll down one line at a time...and don't read ahead or you'll ruin it!
<br /><br />1. First, write the numbers 1 through 11 in a column.
<br /><br />2. Then, beside numbers 1 and 2, write down any two numbers you want.
<br /><br />3. Beside the 3 and 7, write down the names of members of the opposite sex.
<br /><br />NO LOOKING AHEAD...OR IT WON&quot;T TURN OUT RIGHT!
<br /><br />4. Write anyone's name (like friends or family....) in the 4th, 5th,
<br /><br />and 6th spots.
<br /><br />5. Write down four song titles in 8,9,10, and 11.
<br /><br />GO WITH YOUR INSTINCT PEOPLE!!!!
<br /><br />6. Finally, make a wish.
<br /><br />And now the key for the game.....
<br /><br />1. You must tell (the number in space 2) people about this game.
<br /><br />2. The person in space 3 is the one that you love.
<br /><br />3. The person in 7 is one you like but can't work out.
<br /><br />4. You care most about the person you put in 4
<br /><br />5. The person you name in number 5 is the one who knows you very well.
<br /><br />6. The person you name in 6 is your lucky star.
<br /><br />7. The song in 8 is the song that matches with the person in number 3.
<br /><br />8. The title in 9 is the song for the person in 7.
<br /><br />9. The tenth space is the song that tells you most about YOUR mind.
<br /><br />10. and 11 is the song telling you how you feel about life
<br /><br />NOW...put this on ur syt within the hour you read this...IF you do..your wish will come true. If you don't it will become the opposite!!
