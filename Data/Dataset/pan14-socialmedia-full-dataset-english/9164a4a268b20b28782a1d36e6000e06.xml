<br /><br />Has it been awhile since you considered AC replacement?  In the hot Jacksonville climate we live in, it’s always important to make sure your AC is in perfect condition in order to maintain a comfortable and cool environment.  Since many air conditioners run day and night for hours upon hours, it makes sense that they need to be replaced every once in awhile.  AllWeather Contractors can have your AC running as good as new in no time with the air conditioning replacement system you need. What are some indicators that it’s time for AC replacement?  One sign might be if your equipment starts to make strange noises that it hasn’t made before.  It may be that something is simply stuck in the machine, or that it needs to be lubricated.  However, in some cases, unusual noises often indicate that the unit is no longer working properly and may need to be replaced.  An additional sign that you might need to consider replacing your AC equipment is if there seems to be an abnormal amount of d

<br /><br />Air conditioners and heat pumps control the temperature in your Jacksonville home or office, but fan coils are often overlooked even though they are essential parts of AC units and heating systems that allow residents to live and work comfortably.  The coils are often used instead of furnaces and evaporator coils to convert refrigerant from a gas to a liquid (or the other way around.)  Subsequently, the fan blows air over the coils, which creates a heating or cooling effect on the surrounding area.<br /><br />Each type of fan coil corresponds to a specific type of refrigerant. Puron refrigerant has become the most popular kind of refrigerant because it has been approved by the United States Environmental Protection Agency as environmentally friendly.  Unlike many refrigerants, Puron will not harm the ozone layer.  R—22 is another common type of refrigerant, but it is not as environmentally sound as Puron. Additionally, there are different speed options for the fan part of the fan coil..

<br /><br />In Jacksonville, making sure that your home or office is properly heated or cooled throughout the year can be an expensive process, so HVAC financing is a great option for limiting the demands of these necessary services on your budget.  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reports that over half of an average United States household’s energy bill consists of the costs that are associated with heating and cooling the house.  As a result, most HVAC companies are teaming up with prominent lenders in order to ease the monetary impact on their customers.  This allows people to heat and cool their homes or offices without the financial burden that can so often prevent necessary HVAC decisions from being made. HVAC financing refers to the full payment for heating or air conditioning services or products being made over an extended period of time.  Customers pay a certain amount of money per month over the course of a year or several years until the entire cost of the service or produc

<br /><br />Considering we spend an average of 90% of our time inside, indoor air quality is an important concern to be aware of. Everyday, pollutants are released into the air through standard indoor materials and activities. Even with the doors and windows tightly shut, there is no way to prevent contaminated outside air from entering your home. Thankfully, there are many products available to purify the air you breathe on a daily basis. AllWeather Contractors can provide you with services and products that improve indoor air quality in Jacksonville, Florida, giving you a reason to breathe a little easier. When looking for ways to improve the indoor air quality of your home, you have a lot of easy and reliable options. One of these options is the installation of an air cleaner, such as an air purification or filtering system. Air purifiers and air filters quickly remove pollutants such as pollen and dust from the air you breathe. Today, technology has even made air purifiers capable...

<br /><br />Many people worry about the unpredictable nature of heating system problems, resulting in needed heating repairs and the cost that goes along with having to repair a faulty heater.  Luckily, for residents of Jacksonville, heating repair is not as much of an issue overall as it can be in other parts of the country, where temperatures stay cold for much longer periods of time during the winter months.  But, even in Jacksonville, heating repairs are on the minds of many, since problems with heating systems can result in costly repairs.<br /><br />Most heating repairs are needed during extended cold snaps when heating systems are working overtime to keep a home or business warm and comfortable.  This can result in higher costs because emergency heating repair service is needed, which may be billed at a premium price because service is needed immediately (and service may be requested during nights, weekends or holidays).  Heating system emergencies can also result in homeowners being left without hea

<br /><br />Buying a new heat pump, gas furnace or packaged heating system is not on most homeowners’ lists of “favorite things to do”.  But, sometimes it becomes necessary to buy a new heater because the home’s existing heating equipment is completely inoperable and not worth fixing.  Other times, it just makes sense to look into a new heater purchase because the existing heat pump or furnace is nearing the end of its operable life and is not running efficiently.  No matter what the reason for having to replace a heating system, however, the fact is that there are benefits to having a new heating system installed that will offset some of the purchase costs. When in the market for a new heating system, it is important to consider a few key factors so that the system you purchase is the best option to meet your needs, keeping your home comfortable and your energy costs in check.  Below is a list of factors to consider before buying a new heater or furnace.

<br /><br />Heating and cooling systems generally account for about one third to one half of energy costs within a home.  When homeowners neglect proper heater maintenance of their systems, home energy costs can increase, since systems do not run as efficiently over time without proper maintenance.  Neglecting heating systems can also diminish the lifespan of the equipment, making it more likely that the equipment will have to be replaced earlier than expected or will need to undergo heating repairs.  Therefore, sticking to a regular heating system maintenance schedule is a cost-effective solution for homeowners.<br /><br />Studies have shown that energy bills can be reduced by as much as 30-35% when proper maintenance is performed on heating systems.  This is because, according to Energy Star (a division of the EPA responsible for energy efficiency), dirt and neglect can cause heating systems to run less efficiently and can even lead to system failure.

<br /><br />If you’ve lived in Northeast Florida for long, you know how miserable the summers can be without air conditioning. Jacksonville-area residents know that come summertime, the heat and humidity can drag down even the most avid outdoorsman. So keeping the AC running well is a top priority.<br /><br />Not surprisingly, the first air conditioner was invented and installed in Apalachicola, a near-straight, due-west shot across the state from Northeast Florida on the Gulf Coast, which has a very similar climate. During the 1830s, Dr. John Gorrie, a physician, scientist inventor and humanitarian for whom a Jacksonville junior high school is named, was studying tropical diseases. The going theory at the time was that many were airborne diseases and could be treated in part by cooling the air around a patient. To this end, he cooled sickrooms using ice in a basin suspended from the ceiling. Because it’s heavier than warm air, the cool air flowed down across the patient and exited through an opening ne

<br /><br />Did you know that the air inside your home can be as much as five times dirtier than the air outdoors?  In fact, indoor air quality is a top concern of the EPA, potentially causing health issues for children and adults alike, or at the very least, making the air that we breathe less than the ideal quality that it could, and should, be.  Jacksonville indoor air quality levels can especially be affected by heat and humidity due to the local climate.<br /><br />The good news, however, is that there are steps you can take to improve the quality of the air in your home.  Some of these steps involve staying up to date on HVAC preventative maintenance and repairs so that your equipment is running at optimal levels.<br /><br />If indoor air quality is a concern for your home or family, there are enhancements that you can add to your current HVAC system or standalone systems that can improve the quality of the air in your home.

<br /><br />Duct free systems, also called ductless systems, are an efficient and affordable way to heat or cool your current space. They are a great solution for homes or businesses that do not already have ductwork installed within the home to support a central air conditioning system, since they do not require the use of existing ductwork or the installation of new ductwork to solve cooling distribution needs. Carrier ductless air conditioners are a very efficient cooling option, and are rated as high as 23 SEER.<br /><br />These creative systems combine an outdoor condensing unit and an indoor fan coil for a convenient and clutter-free alternative to traditional heating and cooling units. The indoor and outdoor components are connected by simple wires and tubing and take up minimal space without blocking windows. Unlike conventional systems that operate in homes with ductwork, these systems offer a relief from the distracting sound by being virtually noise-free.

<br /><br />Have you been wondering if you need an air purifier in your Jacksonville home? Do you wake up every morning in a coughing spree? A major reason for this is due to all the contaminants in the air that enter your lungs and cause bodily reactions. The dust, pollen, and mold that cause coughing or discomfort are very difficult to remove from the air without cleaning every corner of a house. If you are living a busy lifestyle or are looking for a better way to clean the air, purchasing an air purifier can ease your allergy or asthma problems. Even if you do not have allergies or asthma, consuming volatile organic compounds (VOCs) can be risky to your health. The effects of these VOCs may not be immediate, but over a long period time, these particles can pose problems to your breathing and well-being.

<br /><br />To live in a comfortable environment in your Florida home, a central air conditioner is a necessity. Central air conditioning facilitates the spread of cool air through an entire house from a single location. The air is dispersed through a series of vents in a variety of rooms. For new homeowners, making an informed investment for your home depends on gathering the right information about the various air conditioner products, and connecting it to your wants and needs.<br /><br />The first factor to consider when purchasing a central air conditioner is size. The various sizes are important because if the unit is too small it will not effectively cool your house from the Jacksonville heat. On the contrary, if an air conditioner is too big, then the system will not be efficient due to the continual turning on and turning off of the unit. The ideal size is a compromise between performance and cost-effectiveness.

<br /><br />Thermostats can sometimes be tricky to operate, so we would like to take this opportunity to help our Jacksonville customers get a grasp on what theyre all about, what kinds are available and how they can be effectively used.  While there are certainly a variety of thermostats on the market, the basics of most small units are essentially the same.  Here are a few pointers about thermostats and how to use them most effectively.A thermostats main job is to control the heating/air conditioning system in order to maintain a particular temperature in a given space and make occupants more comfortable.  Outside of its basic function of maintaining a specified temperature, however, thermostats can also help to control the heating and cooling operation of an entire heated/cooled space, such as a whole house or an entire office building.  Interestingly enough, this one piece of equipment can be a key player in controlling energy usage and cost of operation of your HVAC unit.

<br /><br />Every air conditioning unit requires regular maintenance if it is to function efficiently. If a unit is not properly maintained, serious breakdowns can occur. These breakdowns can be very costly, so it is advisable to contract with Jacksonville AC maintenance technicians or companies to service your unit every now and again, before you find yourself with an inoperable air conditioner on a sweltering day. During a AC maintenance appointment, the unit will be checked for any problems. In case there are broken components or ones not working properly, they will either be repaired or replaced.  Maintenance also serves to maintain or increase the efficiency of an AC unit. It is advisable to buy air conditioners from reputable and reliable companies, be they small or big.
