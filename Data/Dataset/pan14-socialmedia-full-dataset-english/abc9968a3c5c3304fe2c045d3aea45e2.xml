This is the equipment that cleans grease, oil, and swarf off of small parts. This way the parts can be packaged and sold, like screws, for example, or they can be used in another manufacturing process. When you are looking for the right degreasing equipment for your company, you need to consider a number of factors. <br /><br />1.	How Much Needs to Be Washed?<br /><br />One of the things that you need to consider is how much material will you need washed. If you only need to clean a small amount of parts per week, then you can purchase a smaller, less expensive machine. However, if you need to process a high volume of parts every day, then you will need to invest in a larger, more expensive machine. You do not want to buy a machine that is too small or too big because this will lead to problems down the road. <br /><br />2.	What Are You Washing?<br /><br />The parts that you will need washed will also have an impact on the type of degreasing equipment you will need. If you need to wash large parts, you will need a machine that can accommodate the work holding equipment that you will need. Do your parts require a solvent or an aqueous solution? <br /><br />3.	Are There Any Special Requirements?<br /><br />Do your parts have any special requirements? For example, with some medical and aerospace parts, no metal to metal contact is allowed. If that is the case, you will need specific work holding equipment for your degreasing equipment. <br /><br />4.	How Much Space Do You Have?<br /><br />Size is another thing to consider when looking for degreasing equipment, especially if you are limited on space. Some degreasing equipment has a smaller footprint than others. <br /><br />5.	What’s Your Budget?<br /><br />Your budget is one of the last things that you should consider as you do not want to spend too much money. However, if you have found degreasing equipment that is within your budget, and you still have some funds leftover, you should consider some accessories for your equipment. For example, some degreasing equipment can be equipped with a solvent recovery system so that your equipment handles solvent more efficiently. <br /><br />Kumi Solutions and Degreasing Equipment<br /><br />If you are looking for the best supplier of degreasing equipment in the UK, you do not have to look any further than Kumi Solutions. This UK supplier is based in Nuneaton, and they are the UK’s sole supplier of Pero degreasing equipment. Pero is a German company that has long been regarded as one of the leaders in parts cleaning manufacturing. <br /><br />The staff at Kumi can help you find the best degreasing equipment and accessories for your specific needs. They regularly hold free cleaning trials at their facility in Nuneaton, and they invite people to bring their own parts to be cleaned. This lets you see how their machines will work with your parts.

This is the equipment that cleans grease, oil, and swarf off of small parts. This way the parts can be packaged and sold, like screws, for example, or they can be used in another manufacturing process. When you are looking for the right degreasing equipment for your company, you need to consider a number of factors. <br /><br />1.	How Much Needs to Be Washed?<br /><br />One of the things that you need to consider is how much material will you need washed. If you only need to clean a small amount of parts per week, then you can purchase a smaller, less expensive machine. However, if you need to process a high volume of parts every day, then you will need to invest in a larger, more expensive machine. You do not want to buy a machine that is too small or too big because this will lead to problems down the road. <br /><br />2.	What Are You Washing?<br /><br />The parts that you will need washed will also have an impact on the type of degreasing equipment you will need. If you need to wash large parts, you will need a machine that can accommodate the work holding equipment that you will need. Do your parts require a solvent or an aqueous solution? <br /><br />3.	Are There Any Special Requirements?<br /><br />Do your parts have any special requirements? For example, with some medical and aerospace parts, no metal to metal contact is allowed. If that is the case, you will need specific work holding equipment for your degreasing equipment. <br /><br />4.	How Much Space Do You Have?<br /><br />Size is another thing to consider when looking for degreasing equipment, especially if you are limited on space. Some degreasing equipment has a smaller footprint than others. <br /><br />5.	What’s Your Budget?<br /><br />Your budget is one of the last things that you should consider as you do not want to spend too much money. However, if you have found degreasing equipment that is within your budget, and you still have some funds leftover, you should consider some accessories for your equipment. For example, some degreasing equipment can be equipped with a solvent recovery system so that your equipment handles solvent more efficiently. <br /><br />Kumi Solutions and Degreasing Equipment<br /><br />If you are looking for the best supplier of degreasing equipment in the UK, you do not have to look any further than Kumi Solutions. This UK supplier is based in Nuneaton, and they are the UK’s sole supplier of Pero degreasing equipment.

This is the equipment that cleans grease, oil, and swarf off of small parts. This way the parts can be packaged and sold, like screws, for example, or they can be used in another manufacturing process. When you are looking for the right degreasing equipment for your company, you need to consider a number of factors. <br /><br />1.	How Much Needs to Be Washed?<br /><br />One of the things that you need to consider is how much material will you need washed. If you only need to clean a small amount of parts per week, then you can purchase a smaller, less expensive machine. However, if you need to process a high volume of parts every day, then you will need to invest in a larger, more expensive machine. You do not want to buy a machine that is too small or too big because this will lead to problems down the road. <br /><br />2.
