Elliptical trainers offer a non-impact cardiovascular  workout that can vary from light to high intensity based on the speed of the  exercise and the resistance preference set by the user. &lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p align=&quot;justify]  Elliptical trainers exercise your upper and  lower body, including legs, back, shoulders, chest, biceps, and triceps. Most  elliptical trainers allow you to reverse the motion, thereby exercising even  more muscles. You are able to burn more calories in less time because you  exercise more muscle groups. Because of the efficiency of the dual action  workout, there seems to be a lower perceived level of exertion. In other words,  you are working harder and burning more calories at a lower but not noticing  the exertion as much. They reinforce the lower parts of your body with a good  cardio workout, and because their little impact, smaller than walking, can be  executed by those who have problems with their knees too. One great advantage  is that elliptical trainer offers a full aerobic workout, creating the illusion  that we have worked less than we work on a regular workout.&lt;/p&gt;<br /><br />&lt;p align=&quot;justify]  A properly designed elliptical trainer  mimics your body's natural stride - the way your foot moves elliptically when  walking, running, or jogging. You stand upright striding in a forward or  reverse motion. Because of this, impact is basically eliminated and there is  much less overall stress on your knees, hips and back, joints and back. Many  elliptical trainers offer moveable upper body arm bars. By working both legs  and arms, your heart rate elevates more quickly which encourages your body to  burn calories faster and more efficiently. By offering upper body arms, an  elliptical trainer workout also helps you tone your arms, shoulders and back.  It gives you an overall body workout that burns extra calories and gives you an  extra efficient workout. &lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p align=&quot;justify]  These machines are now the most popular  piece of <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy53b3JsZGZpdG5lc3MuY29tLmF1" target="_blank">equipment in the gym</a>, having taken over from the treadmill. <strong>Elliptical  machines</strong> work many, muscle groups and as the stress on the joints is minimal,  there is little risk of overusing a certain muscle group. If desired because of  its low impact, smooth motion, users are able to endure longer workouts, thus  increasing the number of calories burned per workout. Elliptical machines  therefore allow you to burn a similar number of calories as jogging, but  without the risk of injury to the knees and ankles. &lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p align=&quot;justify]  Elliptical trainers are gaining popularity  fast as the best cardio workout machines. Elliptical trainers have some  advantage over treadmills in the sense that they give you an upper body workout  as well. Elliptical trainers give you a more thorough workout as there is an  involvement of upper body movement as well. Studies suggest that exercising  numerous muscle groups increases fat burning efficiency. With elliptical  trainer, you can add versatility to your workouts as the foot pedals can be  worked in a forward or reverse direction. When you change the direction of the  pedals, you’ll target your lower body in different ways.&lt;/p&gt;
