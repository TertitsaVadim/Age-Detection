This day was very luck for me because this day I did not have homework so my mother took me to a restaurateur to eat beef but it was too early for us to finish the dinner. I needed to go people’s performance at seven thirty but I finish the dinner at six o’clock. It was a very bad thing so I let my mother use her car to go to some places she wanted to go. We went around the performance two times but we still had free time so I let my mother go home and stayed at the out of the performance by myself with some other people I did not know. This time the weather was raining but we had to wait the ticket lookers to open the door. I used twenty minutes to wait but I thought the time was very fast for me. The concert was too old and too bored for me. The concert was a group work. Most performances had to have a lot of people to perform together. The performances used a lot of Chinese musical instruments. For example: erhu fiddles and pipa. I did not like the concert very much because the rhythm very too slow.  A lot of young people went out of the concert very quickly. It just was a ticket bought by my mother but it was not very well.

The title is Wu Wei Shan Cultural Figures sculpture Gallery of Nanjing Museum. 10-D and 10-B’s students went to this place with Ms Hadley and Ms Bartell. We were very happy about kind of things.
<br />It shows us different famous people in the history in sculpture. Most of the artworks were made by one artist. The artworks mixed traditional and contemporary.
<br />I want to talk about one artwork. The title of the artwork is “sleeping child”. The artist is Wu Wei Shan. This artwork was finished on a visit to a friends’ house. This time he did not use anything, he only used the mud to pinch for a little time. He did it because he wanted to pinch when the child had been unwell and crying most of a day but had now fallen asleep its mouth open because it had difficulty breathing through the nose.
<br />The artwork is very strange artwork because if I walked to different directions to see the sleeping child, I would find different feelings. Foe example: In one way, I feel the child is very happy. In anther way, I feel the child is sleeping, so I think though this artwork was made without care. This artwork also is a very great artwork.
<br />Sometimes, I can remember my cousin when I saw it because when my cousin was very young, I also saw him when he was sleeping. The artist made this artist just for fun, so I know not everything I should try my best. I also can do something just for fun.
<br />I like the artwork because I can find different feelings if I see the sleeping child in different directions and when my cousin was very young he was also the sleeping child. They are not only for look like. They also like each other on sprit. I also can have a lot of different feelings when my cousin was sleeping. I think other people might appreciate the artwork because the artist did it without care but he won an award about this artwork.
<br />The Wu Wei Shan Cultural Figures sculpture Gallery of Nanjing Museum is a small museum but it was very huge for me because I stay in there for a very long time but I also could not finish looking all the sculptures in the museum. The museum had a lot kind of sculptures and pictures. Some of them were the Chinese styles some of them were the western styles some of them even mixed the Chinese and western styles so sometimes, it was very difficult for me to enjoy all the sculptures and pictures. Some of sculptures and pictures were very easy for me to know some of the meaning of them but I always do not know some other meanings. 
<br />I think this time to go to exhibition was a very great change for me because I know a lot of new things I never know it before.

Actually, I did not have anything to do for my work experience. I just need to help other worker if they wanted me to help. Otherwise, I just need to stand after a table. When some tourists wanted me to help, I was willing to help them very much because I was too bored and had nothing to do. I just need to stand from eight o’clock to seventeen o’clock. I did not know the meaning of standing with nothing but now I know I just stand in there. Other people also had other works to do but I was still too tried. It was meaning that work was very difficult. If I have some new works, I will try my best to do it and never give it up. Work experience is vey important for everyone but not all of us can know Work experience is vey important because they do not the meaning of work experience and why they do the work experience I think I know what it is but may it is not true. I do not care. I just do what I think it is right. May be it is wrong but I will never say I want to change the decide of myself.

I like this club because this club is very useful for me but not any other people else. Other students do not care about the Chinese class so sometimes they even do not go to classroom and go to places where they have the club activities and just tell Chinese teachers they have club activities. Sometimes students just tell Chinese teachers they have club activities but they go home in fact.
<br />Table tennis club is different. This club only has club activities in the noontime so I always can go to the places for us to play table tennis. Table tennis is very easy for me to play so I like to join into the club. I go to play table tennis club each Thursday in the noontime. Every time the time is too short for me. I think it only is about ten minutes but the time is about half an hour. Though I am always tired after I play table tennis but I feel happy because I do not like do a lot of exercise. Table tennis is a kind of good exercise so I think it is more difficult for me to become fatter and fatter.
<br />I learn the base skills about how to play table tennis though I already know some of skills, I also do not know some of skills. People do not need to have any skills about table tennis because the skills are very easy to study but if people want to be good at table tennis, they have to practice a lot about table tennis.

This place nears xingjiekou very much. It is opposite the golden eagle. The Harris’s home stays at the second and the third floor. The third floor is a floor for people to play but it is no meaning for us to eat. We ate eat at the second floor. I thought this place should have a lot of people wanted to come to eat but this place only had two groups of people when we came to the second floor. I found that other people all talked to each other or read books. We sat in a place beside other people. After we went to this place, we had to wait for a very long time but we could watch the cartoon about Tom and Jerry. When I was very young, I always watched but now I never watch. I do not have free time. This time, I had free time. I suddenly, found that Tom and Jerry were very funny. We ate this kind of food for about three hours. I thought that the time could pass very fast. Fast that I did not know it. We went home in the very different ways because I needed to use the left way to go home but they needed to use the right way to go home. They went home by a bus. I went home by the subway. it is very funny.

This day was raining when we went to Jiuhua Mountain but I had an umbrella so the raining did not affect me a lot. The students of my classroom divided into several parts. One part of students went to a place to prevent the raining. One part of students went with teacher. One part of students like me went around the Jiuhua Mountain and wanted to find some strange things but I did not find any special things and only drew the pictures of different kinds of plants which was the purpose for us to go to the Jiuhua Mountain.
<br />At first, I went by myself in the bottom of Jiuhua Mountain but I found that nobody else stayed in the bottom of Jiuhua Mountain so I started to want to go to the top of the Jiuhua Mountain. After few minutes, I found a group of students went with teacher and the teacher talked about the function each type of plants so I went with them and took a picture with them. When I went to the top of the Jiuhua Mountain, I found that the top of the Jiuhua Mountain was too lower for me. I could even see the Purple Mountain which was much higher than the Jiuhua Mountain so I started to feel sad about this travelling and thought I should not go there.

I thought it just was a very old temple. We did not have to buy tickets but we had to pay about twenty-five yuan. The temple showed if you were students you did not have to pay the tickets so I thought I did not have to pay the tickets but the tickets seller said you had to pay the money to go into the temple I supposed it was unfair very much so I started to argue with the tickets seller. The tickets seller was very strange. She said you had to pay the money or not went into the temple. I suddenly did not know what I could say. I had to pay the money for my mother and me. It was a Sunday so we had enough time. My mother parked her car in a hospital because if you paid five yuan, you could park your car forever if you wanted. We walked to the Jiming Temple for a very long time but it was very cheap for us to park the car in a hospital. I did not like to go to temples but my mother said you had to go to the Jiming Temple. I had no way to stay at home by myself. I did not know any different in the temple. It was a very boring thing for me.

<br />One hundred thousand of people sound a lot but it actually only has a few people in the percent of the total Chinese. For sure, I had no feeling about Japanese people when I saw them but I did not know why I do not like Japan at all last year. 
<br />As you know there were millions of people killed by the Communist Party itself but why do not have any students and adults do not like the Communist Party? The Communist Party always tells us we should love the country and most of students need to join the Communist Party to show they love China but the country not means the Communist Party. 
<br />When I know that I know I am brainwashed by the Communist Party. I do not want to hate Japan but I still always do not like Japan. I know it is the habit of me and the brainwash of eighteen years are difficult to change.
<br />Genghis khan killed a lot more than one hundred thousand of people but we think he is a hero. Why? The Communist Party do not brainwash us the things about the Genghis khan. We should know it is impossible to have no people to die in the war. It is a very normal event.
<br />For sure, Japanese army liked to kill all the people but why they started it? Because of the Communist Party! When the nationalist party fought with Japanese army, the Communist Party always killed some important people in Japanese army so we can image how angry the Japanese army was. They started to kill all the people when they stayed in a place so the Nanjing Massacre happened so I can see the Nanjing Massacre Museum.

I want to use PE lessons’ time to become the physical activity. It is the easiest way for people to know that I have enough physical activities’ time. When I had PE lessons, I played football with my classmates and my PE teacher taught us some skills about football. The teacher also let us knows the name of each part of body. The end of this term my teacher let us play a new game called hockey. After this activity I know more skills about football and hockey and remember the name of each part of body. After this process I insight if I want to do something very well I have to use a lot of time to prepare it. When I played football, hockey and remember the name of each part of body, I can do it very well and know it very easy and quickly. The activities match to my personal fitness goals because the PE teacher let us do this kind of activities. When I played games, I liked to become a person who defends because I can defend very easily. 
<br />My physical activity is very easy for me because I was an ESL student last year so I had PE lessons, ESL lessons, Art lessons, Chinese Math and Chinese Mandarin. The PE lessons this year were the physical activity for me but I also did some other physical activities I did not know why I wanted to do some other physical activities if I had some free time. I always walked around my school after I had a lunch in school or in the liuchangqing. Sometimes, if I got up early, I would run around the playground one time very slowly. Sometimes, I also went to a place to play basketball with old classmates or run by myself at weekend. This place is a place for people to exercise. I had to use ten minutes to run to this place and ran around a playground in this place one time so every time my T-shirt was wet a lot. I also had a shower after I did this kind of physical activities. I felt very comfortable every time. My PE lessons always play badminton in a university this term but some students did not like to play badminton so they play basketball. Some other students also did not like to play badminton but they also did not like to play basketball. They wanted to do something they liked to do. For example: reading books cheating with some other people
