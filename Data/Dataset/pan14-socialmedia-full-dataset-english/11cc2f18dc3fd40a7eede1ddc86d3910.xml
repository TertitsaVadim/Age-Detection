And it's killing me inside. I think that you don't understand. How I... would give you all I have and all I am. Till the end of time. You got me defenseless, intoxicated senseless. You cut me so deeply, I must confess. Baby I can't breath, when my arms around you. Baby it kills me cause now that I found you. Your love is like a weapon. I can't live without you.You're so beautiful, it's tearing me apart. You murder my heart..
<br />    I need to catch my breathe with you sometimes. Cause I... get dizzy when your body's touching mine....you're killing me inside. The way you move is much too sexy baby....so I... surrender to your hands, your lips, your taste. And I'm telling you tonight. I climb up the past that I could never escape. You hurt me and changed from the start. I'm just a witness to the scene of my heart. And the way you've been slaying my heart.

<br />Why do I feel so anxious?
<br />I've never felt this way before
<br />You must be special
<br />I do not fear love
<br />Even if separation will come soon
<br />However I do not want this love
<br />Because I will keep on yearning for more
<br />Like water freely flowing in the stream
<br />I will entrust my heart to you
<br />As each day passes
<br />I'll find something that needs to be thrown away one at a time
<br />If I have you by my side
<br />If I think about you
<br />If I love you
<br />You seem like a person that won't stay long
<br />If I let you go
<br />If I leave you
<br />You seem like a person that will love me more
<br />Anxious love
<br />Even so, I like this love
<br />I love on my own, I let go on my own
<br />This true love
<br />I've waited so earnestly for you, but
<br />we are ill-matched
<br />An unfortunate love
<br />If I have you by my side
<br />Therefore, I will hold onto this love

<br />A beautiful melody when the night’s so long. ’Cause there is no guarantee that this life is easy
<br />When my world is falling apart. When there’s no light to break up the dark
<br />That’s when  I look at you
<br />When the waves are flooding the shore and I can’t find my way home anymore.
<br />That’s when I look at you
<br /><br />When I look at you, I see forgiveness, I see the truth.
<br />You love me for who I am like the stars hold the moon. Right there where they belong and I know I’m not alone. You appear just like a dream to me, just like kaleidoscope colors that prove to me.
<br />All I need, every breath that I breathe. Don’t ya know, you’re beautiful.
<br />You appear just like a dream to me
