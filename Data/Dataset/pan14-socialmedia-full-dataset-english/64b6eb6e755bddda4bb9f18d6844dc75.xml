This tradition is unique to Spain with a lot of pain and suffering that the performer is subjected to in order to transform it into perfection.Unique traditionThe locals call Flamenco ‘Sevilliana’ as it was purportedly originated from Seville. This dance and song performance stands excellently as an exquisite Spanish art through its expression in song (cante), dance (baile) and guitar playing (guitarra).Spanish gypsies have claimed to be the originators of the Spanish flamenco with an active participation throughout the decades. This is how a Spanish tradition is normally survived; the Andalusian dances and songs are passed down from generation to generation including the Flamenco.Over time, Flamenco Schools were established in Jerez and Cadiz Triana until its popularity peaked between 1869 and 1910.Forms and fameThe Flamenco started off with mere vocals and accompanied rhythmical clapping of the hands called the ‘toque de palmas.’ Reputable musicians and composers added on guitar music accompaniment later. Today, there is some jazz, salsa and bosa nova flavor to the traditional Flamenco.The Flamenco tradition was quite perfected at its peak as a definitive art form which was highly sought in cafes cantantes or music cafes all over Andalucia.There is a more serious form of Flamenco which expresses deep feelings known as the ‘cante jondo’. There is more guitar accompaniment through a unique Flamenco guitar.Vocals or singing came into the Flamenco between 1910 and 1955; hence, the birth of the ‘opera flamenca’ came on. Fandangos as well as cantes music also arose as accompaniment to the vocal flamencos.Various flamenco artisans would frown at such modifications and additions which are not considered true flamenco; these are viewed as drastic and untraditional modifications to the art of flamenco.As skilled Flamenco performers emerged from 1955, the flamenco presentations moved away from cafes cantantes to great theatres and concert halls performances. Flamenco guitarists became more outstanding in their Flamenco performance as they performed as an individual artist performing on their own merit and not merely as an accompaniment.If you are looking for a luxurious villa for holidays Click Here and Get more information on location maison vacances espagne avec piscineHere you can read my articles :-- http://goarticles.com/article/Flamenco-Culture-in-Spain/6961189/.

This town is located at the eastern side of the majestic Pyrenees Mountains. From one angle, this mountain range looms majestically above Andorra la Vella to give it a most picturesque view.
<br /><br />Andorra is an ideal holiday destination for those who desire a diverse yet Spanish culture. With its strategic location near to France, it is not surprising to have many French visitors throughout the year. 
<br /><br />Background
<br /><br />Andorra is the capital in Andorra Principality with 45% Spaniards, 33% Andorreans, 11% Portuguese and 7% French. This cosmopolitan community offers a diverse culture that is so rich and attractive.
<br /><br />Catalan is the main communication language spoken at Andorra with Castilian, French and Portuguese frequently heard. Andorra la Vella means Old Andorra which refers to its ancient origins.
<br /><br />The town was one of the region’s early settlements with numerous stoned streets and homes; it was called Barri Antic due to the simple homes of its early settlers. Andorra flourished easily and quickly over time to be the cosmopolitan darling of Spain with quite a bit of modernism although its ancient quarter is retained to add on to the charm of the town. This section allows visitors to get a feel of the medieval times of Andorra with all its mysticism and beauty.
<br /><br />Architectural Delights
<br /><br />There are plenty of great architectural delights in Andorra la Vella. Near the ancient quarter lies the Sant Esteve church with antique structures that are incomparable in Andorra or its surrounding region. This 11th century church was built by the Romans; hence, the Romanesque architecture is very obvious. Several intriguing paintings hang inside this ancient church which sports fascinating designs on its interior. Both the interior designs and the paintings prove to be more than a casual visit or stopover at this church. 
<br /><br />These are ancient art pieces that are unique and well painted which would amaze many tourists today.
<br /><br />Another impressive architecture at Andorra is Casa de la Vall. This ancient castle is majestic in its architectural structure which served as Andorra’s parliament house in the 16th century. It is called the House of Valley which was built in the 1580s as a prominent family’s residence. The Andorran government soon converted it as a parliament house. 
<br /><br />The architectural design of this castle is very unique for its exterior as well as interior. The building is also very rich in history which all visitors should enjoy.

		<document id="9d963bce97feb110727b8bb4a4e6ae87" url=""><![CDATA[The Amazing Alhambra at Grenada<br/><br/>One of the greatest treasures in Grenada is the ancient but magnificent Alhambra. It is one of the most exquisite Moorish architecture that can be seen today. Its lofty hill position makes it stand out all thea more as one of the intriguing sights in Grenada. It would take tourists several hours to explore the Alhambra where the intrinsic designs and textures can be feasted.
<br /><br />Historical value
<br /><br />Grenada’s Alhambra is renowned as the best ancient Moorish architecture in Europe that has been well preserved for today’s viewing. This ancient fortress is magnificent in its structure that is second to none in the region. The Arabic term Alhambra means ‘the Red Castle’. Moorish poets have likened the Alhambra to a pearl among emeralds.
<br /><br />The strategic location of Alhambra enforces its value as a strong fortress of defense. The river flows at the north with the majestic and invincible Sierra Nevada. This fort was built by Sawar ben Hamdun in the 9th century who converted the smaller Alcazaba fort into the formidable Alhambra fortress.
<br /><br />The Alhambra was a very revered fortress serving as a royal residence with exquisite Arabesque furnishings and architecture.
<br /><br />However, the Christians Re-conquest took over the city in 1492 with Renaissance style changes on the architecture of the Alhambra. It soon became the winter palace of King Charles V with little Moorish architecture left in place.
<br /><br />In 1812, the French destroyed two of Alhambra’s towers; Napoleon nearly demolished the Alhambra but his plan was thwarted by a discontented soldier. However, a natural calamity did extensive damage on the Alhambra in 1821. Jose Contreras led a team to repair and restore the grandeur of the Alhambra in 1828.
<br /><br />Structural beauty
<br /><br />There are many beautifully designed sections in the Alhambra. One of them is the Lions Patio. It is a courtyard in a rectangular shape with 124 marble columns. Every arch of the gallery showcases exquisite Arabesques artwork. Twelve white marble lion statues stand majestically around a fountain at the center of the courtyard which is known as the Fountain of the Lions.
<br /><br />The biggest room inside the Alhambra is the Ambassadors Hall which is a reception area. In the past, it was used to welcome visitors during the Moorish kings’ rule. There are intricate designs on the walls and ceilings in the Alhambra depicting the heavens in gold, blue and white designs.
<br /><br />The two Sisters Hall contains 2 large slabs of smooth marbles with a fountain inside and a honeycombed dome ceiling that bespoke beautiful Moorish architecture.

		<document id="e346872c553302101694f2af3a93858d" url=""><![CDATA[Religious Significance at Santiago de Compostela<br/><br/>There are many towns and cities in Spain which are considered as ‘religious’ areas. These Spanish towns and cities such as Santiago de Compostela are just like Rome and Jerusalem. Santiago de Copostela or Santiago is considered as one of Spain’s most holy cities where hundreds of thousands of Catholic pilgrims come by for their annual absolution pilgrimage.
<br /><br />Historical significance
<br /><br />Santiago is the city where the famous Saint James apostle was renowned for his missionary work after Jesus was crucified. Santiago means James in Spanish; he was one of the apostles of Jesus who was beheaded in Jerusalem; however, his remains were taken to be buried in Galicia by the other disciples. 
<br /><br />In the year 813, Santiago’s bones were exhumed and authenticated by a Christian hermit before they were placed in the Cathedral that was built by King Alphonso II.
<br /><br />Pilgrimage route
<br /><br />There is more than one route to experience the pilgrimage of St. James. The famous Pilgrimage Way can be via the French route entering Spain through the majestic Pyrenees Mountains. Alternatively, there is the Northern route via Spain’s Basque country or the Silver route which is the southern route via Andalusia. There is also the Portuguese route via Oporto and Tui which is a Galician city. Finally, there is the English route or the Maritime route via A Coruna or Ferrol from the north of Europe.  
<br /><br />Whichever pilgrimage route is taken, there would surely be a lot of walking. Pilgrims are expected to walk a good portion of the pilgrimage route as a show of sincerity in their faith. The Saint James pilgrimage route is an Appalachian Trail to display one’s absolution. A pilgrim is required to complete at least the final 100 km by foot; a bicycle or horse can be used to complete the final 200 km. A small boat can be used to complete 40 nautical miles before walking to the designated Pontecesures port.
<br /><br />The pilgrimage is complete at Santiago where a religious ritual is required before entering the cathedral.
<br /><br />Religious observations
<br /><br />Once the pilgrims enter the cathedral from their completed walk, pilgrims qualify to touch any marble pillar available or bump one’s head on any revered sculptured figures as an act of repentance and reverence. 
<br /><br />The pilgrims are to face the image of St. James which is on the altar before embracing it from its back. Pilgrims then move on down to the apostle’s crypt to sight the silver box containing the apostle’s remains. With the completion of these routines, the pilgrims can collect the La Campostela Latin certificate from the Pilgrimage office.
