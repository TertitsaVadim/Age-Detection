You can now be comfortable after installing a  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy52aXNpb250dXguaW4_" target="_blank"><strong><em>Vehicle Tracking Access Control System</em></strong></a>, knowing that your vehicles will always be under your supervision. The heart of this <strong><em>Vehicle Tracking Access Control System</em></strong> is the constellation of 24 GPS satellites that constantly orbit the Earth. This constellation was launched in the 1980's by the U.S. Department of Defense. Designed and deployed initially for military use, the system was opened up to civilian use shortly after its inception. These satellites operate 24/7/365 at no direct cost to the end-user.

<br /><br />The <strong><em>INTERNET</em></strong> is the final component of the <strong><em>GPS Vehicle Tracking Access Control System</em></strong>. It provides the conduit into and out of the network servers that store all of the location and event data transmitted by the device. The data transmitted by the Vehicle Tracking Access Control Device goes through the cellular network, into the Internet, where it ends up stored in a database on a web server. The web server stores this information until queried by the end-user from a mapping web site. Almost magically, this all happens in less than a second.
