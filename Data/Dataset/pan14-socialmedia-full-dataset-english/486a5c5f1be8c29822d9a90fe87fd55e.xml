<br />Study: 7% of Men Drive Themselves to Hospital During a Heart Attack
<br />By Miranda Hitti 
<br />WebMD Medical NewsReviewed by Louise Chang, MDFeb. 7, 2006 -- During a heart attack, 7% of men drive themselves to the hospital instead of calling for an ambulance.
<br /><br />So says a study of 227 women and 613 men in Dublin, Ireland, who had had a heart attack and made it to the coronary care unit.
<br /><br />Women were much less likely to drive during a heart attack. But they were also far slower than men to seek medical care, even with intense heart attack symptoms.
<br /><br />Driving during a heart attack is extremely dangerous, and so is delaying emergency care. About half of heart attack patients die before reaching the hospital, and swift treatment is a must, the researchers write.
<br /><br />Their bottom line: Call for an ambulance at the first sign of a heart attack. Don't delay, and don't drive yourself to the hospital.
<br /><br />The researchers included Sharon O'Donnell, PhD, RNT, RGN, of the School of Nursing and Midwifery at Dublin's Trinity College. The study appears in the Journal of Advanced Nursing.
<br /><br />What Were They Thinking?
<br />The patients were interviewed by nursing staff at the hospitals' coronary care units. Only patients with confirmed heart attacks who were admitted to coronary care units were included.
<br /><br />Why did some people drive during their heart attack? Their reasons, noted in the study, include:
<br /><br />&quot;I'd feel really embarrassed to go in an ambulance.&quot; 
<br />&quot;I thought it would be needed for more urgent cases.&quot; 
<br />&quot;It was the quickest way in.&quot; 
<br />Others reported feeling well enough to drive and planned to pull over if need be. But many admitted &quot;a feeling of 'collapse' when arriving at the hospital,&quot; the researchers write.
<br /><br />&quot;Driving a car whilst having a [heart attack] is obviously extremely dangerous both for patients and the general public,&quot; write O'Donnell and colleagues. &quot;However, waiting for a family member or friend to drive to hospital may result in unnecessary delays.&quot;
<br /><br />Their solution: Call for an ambulance ASAP at the first sign of a possible heart attack.
<br /><br />Women Slower to Seek Care
<br />Fewer women drove during a heart attack. But women were much slower than men to get to the hospital by any means.
<br /><br />Women waited an average of 14 hours after the first symptom of a heart attack to go to an emergency room, compared with nearly three hours for men.
<br /><br />With intense heart attack symptoms, women still took three hours to go to the hospital, compared to less than two hours for men.
<br /><br />During those delays, some women tried to feel better by lying down, taking a bath, or taking antacids. Others said they didn't realize what was happening.
<br /><br />&quot;I never even expected it was my heart,&quot; one woman stated.
<br /><br />&quot;I just thought it was bad indigestion and would eventually go away,&quot; another said.
<br /><br />Hazy on Heart Attack Symptoms
<br />Both men and women didn't recognize some of their own heart attack symptoms.
<br /><br />Both sexes reported &quot;a common misconception that 'a heart attack would be much more dramatic' or 'I'd clutch my chest and fall to the ground,'&quot; the researchers write. A recent U.S. survey echoed those misunderstandingsmisunderstandings.
<br /><br />To review, heart attack symptoms can include:
<br /><br />Chest discomfort 
<br />Feeling lightheaded 
<br />Pain or soreness in the arm, neck, or back that lasts several minutes 
<br />Feeling sick to your stomach 
<br />Feeling short of breath 
<br />Feeling sweaty 
<br />Feeling fatigued 
<br />All of those symptoms can signal a heart attack, but they don't always mean a heart attack is happening. That's why getting emergency medical care -- immediately -- is a must. A heart attack is no time for guesswork, hesitation, or do-it-yourself diagnoses.

<br /><br />Facts on Heart Disease in Men
<br />In 2002, 340,933 men died from heart disease, the leading cause of death for men in the United States.1
<br /><br />The age-adjusted death rate for heart disease in men was 297 per 100,000 population in 2002.1
<br /><br />About 8.9% of all white men, 7.4% of black men, and 5.6% of Mexican American men live with coronary heart disease.2
<br /><br />The average age of a first heart attack for men is 66 years.2
<br /><br />Almost half of men who have a heart attack under age 65 die within 8 years.4
<br /><br />Results from the Framingham Heart Study suggest that men have a 49% lifetime risk of developing coronary heart disease after the age of 40.4
<br /><br />Between 70% and 89% of sudden cardiac events occur in men.4
<br /><br />Major risk factors for heart disease include high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, tobacco use, diabetes, physical inactivity, and poor nutrition.5
<br /><br />In a large study of blood pressure treatment and control, an average reduction of 12 to 13 mm Hg in systolic blood pressure over 4 years of follow-up was associated with a 21% reduction in coronary heart disease, 37% reduction in stroke, and 13% reduction in all-cause mortality rates.6
<br /><br />Studies suggest that a 10% decrease in total cholesterol levels may reduce the development of coronary heart disease by as much as 30%.3 
<br />For this fact sheet, the term &quot;heart disease&quot; refers to the broadest category of &quot;disease of the heart&quot; as defined by the International Classification of Diseases and used by CDC's National Center for Health Statistics. This category includes acute rheumatic fever, chronic rheumatic heart disease, hypertensive heart disease, coronary heart disease, pulmonary heart disease, congestive heart failure, and any other heart condition or disease.
<br /><br />CDC Activities to Reduce the Burden of Heart Disease Among Men
<br />CDC's Heart Disease and Stroke Prevention Program
<br />CDC currently funds health departments in 32 states and the District of Columbia to develop, implement, and evaluate programs that promote heart-healthy and stroke-free communities; prevent and control heart disease, stroke, and their risk factors; and eliminate disparities among populations. These programs emphasize the use of education, policies, environmental strategies, and systems changes to address heart disease and stroke in various settings and to ensure quality of care.

<br /><br />Maps of Heart Disease and Stroke Mortality Among Women and Men
<br />The interactive maps present heart disease and stroke mortality rates, county-by-county, for the state, racial/ethnic group, and gender of your choice. These maps provide valuable information for health professionals and concerned citizens at the local, state, and national levels to identify the communities of women and men with the greatest burden of heart disease and to design heart disease prevention programs and policies tailored to the needs of those communities. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2FDHDSP%2Flibrary%2Fmaps%2Findex.htm"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.cdc.gov/DHDSP/library/maps/index.htm</a>.
<br /><br />A Public Health Action Plan to Prevent Heart Disease and Stroke
<br />A Public Health Action Plan to Prevent Heart Disease and Stroke is a groundbreaking collaboration that will help to guide the nation’s heart disease and stroke prevention efforts over the next decades. The Action Plan was developed by public and private partners who are committed to preventing disease rather than treating its consequences and to transforming public health agencies and their partners into effective agents of change. A national forum of experts, representing some 50 national and international organizations, serves as the vehicle for implementing the Action Plan. The three lead partners are the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association, the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, and CDC, which provides core support for convening the national forum and implementing the Action Plan.

<br /><br />Women and Heart Attack
<br />If you're a woman, you may not believe you're as vulnerable to a heart attack as men–but you are. Women account for nearly half of all heart attack deaths. Heart disease is the number one killer of both women and men.
<br /><br />There are differences in how women and men respond to a heart attack. Women are less likely than men to believe they're having a heart attack and more likely to delay in seeking emergency treatment.
<br /><br />Further, women tend to be about 10 years older than men when they have a heart attack. They are more likely to have other conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, and congestive heart failure–making it all the more vital that they get proper treatment fast.
<br /><br />Women should learn the heart attack warning signs. These are:
<br /><br />Pain or discomfort in the center of the chest.
<br /><br />Pain or discomfort in other areas of the upper body, including the arms, back, neck, jaw, or stomach.
<br /><br />Other symptoms, such as a shortness of breath, breaking out in a cold sweat, nausea, or light-headedness.
<br /><br />As with men, women's most common heart attack symptom is chest pain or discomfort. But women are somewhat more likely than men to experience some of the other common symptoms, particularly shortness of breath, nausea/vomiting, and back or jaw pain.
<br /><br />If you feel heart attack symptoms, do not delay. Remember, minutes matter! Do not wait for more than a few minutes–5 minutes at most–to call 9-1-1. Your family will benefit most if you seek fast treatment.

<br />Mistaken Beliefs About Heart Attack Symptoms Can Delay Critical Care
<br />By Miranda Hitti 
<br />WebMD Medical NewsFeb. 18, 2005 -- Both men and women can experience &quot;atypical&quot; heart attack symptoms, as well as classic signs of a heart attack.
<br /><br />People need to know that so they seek emergency help immediately for those symptoms. But some patients may have mistaken beliefs about heart attack differences in men and women, say Jill Quinn and Kathleen King of the University of Rochester's nursing school in New York.
<br /><br />Quinn, PhD, RN, CS-ANP, is an assistant professor specializing in cardiovascular nursing. King, PhD, RN, FAAN, is a professor with a focus on women and heart disease.
<br /><br />&quot;Expectations that only women experience atypical symptoms can lead to confusion for both men and women, resulting in delay [of seeking treatment],&quot; they told the Second International Conference on Women, Heart Disease, and Stroke, which is underway in Orlando, Fla.
<br /><br />Heart Attacks in Men vs. Women
<br />Everyone needs to take care of his or hear heart. Heart disease is a leading killer for both sexes. A heart attack is its most visible sign, says the American Heart Association (AHA). Last year, the AHA predicted that 700,000 people in America would have their first heart attack in 2004. Another 500,000 heart attack survivors were expected to have another heart attack last year.
<br /><br />Women aren't the only ones who can have &quot;atypical&quot; heart attack symptoms. Men can, too, say Quinn and King.
<br /><br />Likewise, classic heart attack symptoms don't only affect men. Women can experience the same well-known warning signs, such as:
<br /><br />A crushing, squeezing, or burning pain, pressure, or fullness in the center of the chest. The pain may radiate to the neck, one or both arms, the shoulders, or the jaw. The chest discomfort lasts more than a few minutes or can go away and return. 
<br />Shortness of breath, dizziness, nausea, chills, sweating, or weak pulse 
<br />Cold and clammy skin, gray pallor, or a severe appearance of illness 
<br />Fainting (rare) 
<br /><br />Not all of these symptoms occur during a heart attack, but because every second counts, if you experience them call 911 immediately, says the American Heart Association. 
<br /><br />Quinn and King studied 41 women and 59 men who had suffered heart attacks. The study centered on heart attack symptoms and any delays in seeking medical care.
<br /><br />Most participants were white. The women were about 70 years old, compared with the men's average age of 60. More men were current or former smokers -- 81%, compared with 56% of the women. No gender differences existed for a history of angina (chest pain), coronary artery disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, previous heart attacks, or cholesterol.

<br /><br />I am talkeing about Bible Questions &amp; Answers this would help you.
<br />With anything that you are looking for you can look it up here.
<br />About the bible ok I want you to know that jesus died for you even.
<br />The ones who drank smock take druges kill people.
<br />Jesus did it all sin was covered by him if know one is there god is.
<br /><br />Question: Do you think Jews and Jehovah's Witnesses will go to heaven, why or why not?
<br />Answer: It's not what I think that matters, it's what the Bible says...
<br />Let it be known to you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified, whom God raised from the dead, by Him this man stands here before you whole. This is the 'stone which was rejected by you builders, which has become the chief cornerstone.' Nor is there salvation in any other, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved.&quot; (Acts 4:10-12, NKJ)
<br />So will some Jews go to heaven? Yes, but only those who have put their faith in Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior. (These Jewish believers are sometimes known today as Messianic Jews). There needs to be a separation between Jews (who are so by birth) and those whose faith is Judaism. Judaism does not believe that the Messiah (Christ) has come and they are still are waiting for a Savior. For this reason they have rejected Jesus Christ and cannot be saved (i.e. go to heaven). This Jew (Paul), who wrote the following, is one that has gone to heaven.
<br />I say then, has God cast away His people (the Jews)? Certainly not! For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin. God has not cast away His people whom He foreknew. Or do you not know what the Scripture says of Elijah, how he pleads with God against Israel, saying, &quot;Lord, they have killed Your prophets and torn down Your altars, and I alone am left, and they seek my life&quot;? But what does the divine response say to him? &quot;I have reserved for Myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to Baal.&quot; Even so then, at this present time there is a remnant according to the election of grace. (Romans 11:1-5, NKJ)
<br />Salvation is found only through placing your faith and trust in Jesus Christ alone -- not by works -- nor can it ever be found by following after a Jesus other than the one revealed in Scriptures. The Jesus of Scriptures is fully God, fully man, sinless, eternally part of the one true God -- who is forever Father, Son and Holy Spirit. His sacrifice on the cross was the perfect and complete payment for the sins of mankind.
<br />For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, not of works, lest anyone should boast. (Ephesians 2:8-9, NKJ)
<br />Not with the blood of goats and calves, but with His own blood He (Jesus) entered the Most Holy Place once for all, having obtained eternal redemption. (Hebrews 9:12, NKJ)
<br />Those who follow after another Jesus (and there is no other Jesus) cannot be saved. Jehovah's Witnesses follow a Jesus who was merely a man (not God) and practice a religion whose emphasis is works towards salvation. When anyone says that you have to work toward your salvation, they are saying that what Jesus did on the cross was not enough. Ultimately you are told to trust in Jesus and yourself (the works you need to do). Other cults, like the Mormons, also teach a &quot;gospel&quot; that is based on works plus faith and even the Mormons worship another Jesus, one who is a separate God from God the Father (one of many Gods or so they would say). Each of these cults have found it necessary to add other books to the Bible, or alter passages of the Bible, to make it say what they want. Coming to God requires a right knowledge of who He is (see Hebrews 11:6) -- and only the Bible alone can provide this (see 2 Timothy 3:16-17).
<br />Jesus answered and said to them, &quot;Are you not therefore mistaken, because you do not know the Scriptures nor the power of God? (Mark 12:24, NKJ)
<br />But I fear, lest somehow, as the serpent deceived Eve by his craftiness, so your minds may be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ. For if he who comes preaches another Jesus whom we have not preached, or if you receive a different spirit which you have not received, or a different gospel which you have not accepted-- you may well put up with it! (2 Corinthians 11:3-4, NKJ)
<br />Can Jehovah's Witnesses and Mormons go to Heaven? Not without repenting of their sin and placing their faith and trust in Jesus Christ. And then they will not longer be Jehovah's Witnesses or Mormons -- but Christians.
<br />Jesus answered, &quot;I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. (John 14:6, NIV)

<br /><br />I have just found out that a companty hid hides astounding discovery of a natural cancer killer.
<br />You see millions of people could have been save but a company desides to hid.
<br />Something that would help man kind but just like the goverment lies and they keep.
<br />Things hidden that is bad and I hope people well start looking in to this here it is the letter
<br /><br />OUTRAGE!!
<br />Billion-dollar drug company hides astounding discovery of a natural cancer killer.
<br />10,000 times stronger than chemo--
<br />but without the side effects! 
<br />Plus read on to learn about:
<br />A BREAKTHROUGH FOR CANCER! This miraculous herb could revolutionize cancer treatment forever!
<br /><br />MIRACLE CURES THAT COULD KILL YOU! The dangers of alternative medicine nobody will tell you--until now!
<br /><br />FORGET CHOLESTEROL! Powerful new antioxidant works better than drugs and is 60 times more effective than vitamin E! 
<br /><br />ELIMINATE ARTHRITIS PAIN! Regenerate cartilage...reduce swelling and inflammation...even for rheumatoid arthritis! 
<br /><br />PLUS MUCH MORE! 
<br />For seven years a major U.S. pharmaceutical company knew of an astounding cancer killer--but decided to tell nobody about it...ever!!
<br /><br />My Dear Friend,
<br />There isn't a scarier moment in anyone's life than when a biopsy comes back positive. It's cancer...It's the beginning of a battle in which no holds are barred. Anyone with any sense will do almost anything at all to try and destroy the killer disease...
<br />Imagine one pharmaceutical company had the answer...had it, as it was, for SEVEN FULL YEARS...yet, not only didn't tell anyone about it--but decided not to tell anyone about it ever!? 
<br />Why? Because the substance they researched is completely natural so they couldn't take out a patent on it. 
<br />For seven long years they tried to artificially mimic the compound's effect in the lab but couldn't. Mother Nature is the only thing that worked. They had no way to make money on the stuff--so they shelved all of their research.
<br />Can you imagine how many Americans may have died in vain during that time?
<br />Read on to learn the full story of the astounding tree from the Amazon Rainforest they kept from you--but that's just the beginning.
<br />Within the next 10 years almost 50% of all Americans will discover, to their horror, that the &quot;tight feeling&quot; is, indeed, a heart attack...
<br /><br />And almost one out of every three of them will die...
<br /><br />...completely needlessly!
<br /><br />Needlessly , because, right now, as you read these words, brilliant medical researchers are successfully treating cancer...heart disease...high-blood pressure...diabetes...osteoporosis...prostate problems...back pain...chronic fatigue...allergies...asthma and arthritis--without resorting to dangerous drugs or surgery. 
<br />Yet, while these therapies are available today--almost none of them will get to the people who need them so desperately for at least 10 years!
<br />Can you, or someone you love dearly, afford to wait?
<br /><br />You need these breakthroughs now because you or someone you love may be in pain now...or taking toxic drugs...or facing surgery. 
<br />You may actually be in danger of losing your life. You need to know about all your options. And, unfortunately, your doctor doesn't have all the answers. Chances are he doesn't know about these cures himself! Hard to believe?
<br />Over 10 years ago, a brilliant group of researchers set out to evaluate the cancer-blocking properties of the common mineral selenium. They found it reduced lung cancer risk by a whopping 46%, colon cancer risk by 58%, and prostate cancer by 62%!! Their findings were published in the Journal of The American Medical Association...finally! 
<br />Through no fault of his own, it could take your doctor an additional 10 long years to hear about a natural cancer treatment that's revolutionary and could help make cancer more manageable. But is there a reason why you should wait that long to know? Absolutely not! I'll tell you all about it--keep reading... 
<br />It will take most Americans another 10 years to be told the vitamin E they've been taking is NOT aiding them in their fight against heart disease. Chances are, even your doctor doesn't know that a safe, more effective, form of vitamin E is just a single miracle-pill away! You, however, won't have to wait that long. You'll find details if you keep reading.
<br />And, similarly, your doctor knows there's little that can be done against the ravages of aging. He may know that human growth hormone (HGH) can turn back your biological clock by as much as 20 years. But he also knows that HGH treatment is not only very expensive, but is also dangerous and fraught with severe side effects.
<br />What your doctor probably doesn't know, and isn't likely to learn about for another 10 years, is that RIGHT NOW there's an HGH treatment available that DOES NOT involve the administration of any hormone. This treatment is as effective as HGH hormone therapy, but is completely safe and costs about as much as a cup of coffee a day! 
<br />Imagine regaining lost muscle mass and tone...more hair...flexibility... sharper vision...thicker, smoother, and more supple skin...it's available today and I'll tell you all about it.
<br />But, believe it or not, not knowing
<br />about these cures isn't the worst of it!
<br />Some of the latest breakthroughs your doctor DOES know about and use are actually worse than the health problems he's trying to solve! 
<br />Do you--or anyone you know--suffer from arthritis? Millions of Americans do. In some cases, the illness turns their lives into a living hell of disability and pain. 
<br />If you're one of those people, just walk into any doctor's office and I'll bet you'll walk out with an NSAID (Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug).
<br />You're probably nodding your head and saying: &quot;been there...done that&quot;...and I bet you're still in pain! Do you know why? Because NSAIDs are ultimately ineffective in beating arthritis! 
<br />Yes, they mask the pain for a little while--but they don't ever get to the root of the problem. What temporary relief you do find can come at a great cost. For starters, they can damage your liver and kidneys and induce gastrointestinal bleeding. Plus, they can actually make your arthritis worse by damaging your cartilage!
<br />And all that suffering is needless!
<br /><br />I'll tell you about an amazing compound that goes well beyond reducing arthritis pain. It can actually repair and rebuild damaged joints, and, in effect, help to reverse arthritis-- without side effects! 
<br />So the question returns, more emphatic than ever: 
<br />If these cures are so wonderful, what keeps them away from the American people? Why is it happening?
<br />Alas, your health is BIG business!
<br />The main reason why natural, cutting-edge cures are doomed to remain the privilege of the very lucky few is because the mainstream medical establishment and the big drug manufacturers make sure of that. 
<br />No, it's not a conspiracy. It's just that hundreds of billions of dollars are at stake. Like it or not, your health happens to be a huge business and the &quot;big boys&quot; of the establishment play hard ball, and they play for keeps. 
<br />Think about it for a moment: The most powerful drug makers in the world have invested hundreds of millions to create a number of anti- cholesterol drugs. These drugs are only partially effective and are laden with serious side effects. 
<br />So, you tell me: Why would those drug makers let anyone tell you that you can lower your cholesterol--without any side effects--by eating about 4 cents worth of...simple onion a day?
<br />You have the right to know about all these breakthroughs today and make your own decisions. After all, it's your life!
<br />And this is why Health Sciences Institute, or HSI, was created.
<br />Some of the most brilliant medical minds
<br />on earth got together, because you have
<br />the right to know NOW!
<br /><br />The obstacles that stand in the way of pioneering natural medical research scientists are immense. Dedicated researchers who wish to bring you breakthrough, life-saving, natural cures find their ways all but completely blocked.
<br />...they face the scorn of the establishment and interest groups
<br />...they face the financial pressure of drug makers (who, by the way, monitor almost all pharmacies and know almost to a &quot;t&quot; exactly how many prescriptions each doctor writes for their products. They actually call &quot;underperforming&quot; doctors to task!) 
<br />...they're made to face suffocating, endless red tape
<br />...they're blocked at every step by out-of-control regulators
<br />Traditionally, most of them just gave up...until now. 
<br />Now, for the first time ever, instead of throwing their hands up in frustration, a world-wide group of brilliant doctors and scientists did the unthinkable. They got together.
<br />Pioneers of revolutionary medicine--from aging and allergies to cancer and heart disease--realized that with a combined voice they could get their discoveries to light--and bring them to you. 
<br />This is why they joined Health Sciences Institute--a unique members-only organization that's dedicated to doing one thing: breaking the barriers big-money medicine has placed before revolutionary natural cures--and bringing breakthrough information on those cures to you RIGHT NOW!! No more waiting.
<br />As a result, the Health Sciences Institute has become one of the world's most important and revolutionary sources for cutting-edge medical information. Unlike anything before it, HSI doesn't represent the opinion of a single, self-appointed &quot;guru,&quot; but contains the unmatched combined wisdom of the world's most formidable medical minds. 
<br />And, as you'll find ahead, Health Sciences Institute doesn't just tell you about a new therapy--it also tells you where to get it, recommended dosages, what results you may reasonably expect, and how quickly. 
<br /><br />HSI does all this through a monthly publication called the Health Sciences Institute Members Alert. 
<br />Almost overnight, the clear and easy-to-read HSI Members Alert , has become a legend in the alternative medical industry as the quintessential source for cutting-edge medical discoveries. Many physicians all over the world use the HSI Members Alert to bring their own patients medical solutions and treatments available nowhere else. 
<br />The reason I'm writing you this letter today is to invite you to become a member of the Health Sciences Institute--to become one of the privileged few who can learn ways to eradicate pain and illness from their lives today, while the rest of America, unfortunately, has to wait.
<br />To help you make up your mind, we've gathered some of the recent natural healing breakthroughs discovered by Health Sciences Institute doctors and researchers in this report. The therapies detailed here are taken from the pages of the HSI Members Alert and are only a small sampling of the life-saving breakthroughs that can be yours. 
<br /><br />Should you choose to become a member, the complete story of these exciting therapies is waiting for you in your FREE Urgent Health Alert Library . But I'll tell you more about it later. 
<br />So, go ahead and read. When you've finished and are ready to make your decision, just ask yourself a simple question:
<br />Can you and your loved ones afford NOT to know about any of this?
<br /><br />Sincerely yours,
<br />Jenny Thompson
<br />Director, Health Sciences Institute
<br />Chapter 1
<br />How many people died in vain while this billion-dollar 
<br />drug maker concealed the secret of the miraculous Graviola tree?
<br /><br />If there ever was a single example that makes it dramatically clear why the existence of Health Sciences Institute is so vital to Americans like you, it's the incredible story behind the Graviola tree. 
<br />The truth is stunningly simple: Deep within the Amazon Rainforest grows a tree that could literally revolutionize what you, your doctor, and the rest of the world thinks about cancer treatment and chances of survival. The future has never looked more promising.
<br />Research shows that with extracts from this miraculous tree it now may be possible to...
<br />Attack cancer safely and effectively with an all-natural therapy that does not cause extreme nausea, weight loss and hair loss
<br /><br />Protect your immune system and avoid deadly infections
<br /><br />Feel stronger and healthier throughout the course of the treatment
<br /><br />Boost your energy and improve your outlook on life 
<br />The source of this information is just as stunning: It comes from one of America's largest drug manufacturers, the fruit of over 20 laboratory tests conducted since the 1970's! What those tests revealed was nothing short of mind numbing... Extracts from the tree were shown to:
<br />Effectively target and kill malignant cells in 12 types of cancer, including colon, breast, prostate, lung and pancreatic cancer.
<br /><br />The tree compounds proved to be up to 10,000 times stronger in slowing the growth of cancer cells than Adriamycin, a commonly used chemotherapeutic drug!
<br /><br />What's more, unlike chemotherapy, the compound extracted from the Graviola tree selectively hunts down and kills only cancer cells. It does not harm healthy cells! 
<br />The amazing anti-cancer properties of the Graviola tree have been extensively researched--so why haven't you heard anything about it? If Graviola extract is as half as promising as it appears to be--why doesn't every single oncologist at every major hospital insist on using it on all his or her patients? 
<br />The spine-chilling answer illustrates just how easily our health--and for many, our very lives(!)--are controlled by money and power. 
<br />Graviola--the plant that worked too well
<br /><br />One of America's biggest billion-dollar drug makers began a search for a cancer cure and their research centered on Graviola, a legendary healing tree from the Amazon Rainforest.
<br />Various parts of the Graviola tree--including the bark, leaves, roots, fruit and fruit-seeds--have been used for centuries by medicine men and native Indians in South America to treat heart disease, asthma, liver problems and arthritis. Going on very little documented scientific evidence, the company poured money and resources into testing the tree's anti-cancerous properties--and were shocked by the results. Graviola proved itself to be a cancer-killing dynamo.
<br />But that's where the Graviola story nearly ended.
<br />The company had one huge problem with the Graviola tree--it's completely natural, and so, under federal law, not patentable. There's no way to make serious profits from it. 
<br /><br />It turns out the drug company invested nearly seven years trying to synthesize two of the Graviola tree's most powerful anti-cancer ingredients. If they could isolate and produce man-made clones of what makes the Graviola so potent, they'd be able to patent it and make their money back. Alas, they hit a brick wall. The original simply could not be replicated. There was no way the company could protect its profits--or even make back the millions it poured into research.
<br />As the dream of huge profits evaporated, their testing on Graviola came to a screeching halt. Even worse, the company shelved the entire project and chose not to publish the findings of its research! 
<br />Luckily, however, there was one scientist from the Graviola research team whose conscience wouldn't let him see such atrocity committed. Risking his career, he contacted a company that's dedicated to harvesting medical plants from the Amazon Rainforest and blew the whistle. 
<br />Miracle unleashed
<br /><br />When researchers at the Health Sciences Institute were alerted to the news of Graviola, they began tracking the research done on the cancer-killing tree. Evidence of the astounding effectiveness of Graviola--and its shocking cover-up--came in fast and furious...
<br />...The National Cancer Institute performed the first scientific research in 1976. The results showed that Graviola's &quot;leaves and stems were found effective in attacking and destroying malignant cells.&quot; Inexplicably, the results were published in an internal report and never released to the public...
<br />...Since 1976, Graviola has proven to be an immensely potent cancer killer in 20 independent laboratory tests, yet no double-blind clinical trials--the typical benchmark mainstream doctors and journals use to judge a treatment's value--were ever initiated...
<br />...A study published in the Journal of Natural Products, following a recent study conducted at Catholic University of South Korea stated that one chemical in Graviola was found to selectively kill colon cancer cells at &quot;10,000 times the potency of (the commonly used chemotherapy drug) Adriamycin...&quot;
<br /><br />...The most significant part of the Catholic University of South Korea report is that Graviola was shown to selectively target the cancer cells, leaving healthy cells untouched. Unlike chemotherapy, which indiscriminately targets all actively reproducing cells (such as stomach and hair cells), causing the often devastating side effects of nausea and hair loss in cancer patients. 
<br />...A study at Purdue University recently found that leaves from the Graviola tree killed cancer cells among six human cell lines and were especially effective against prostate, pancreatic and lung cancers...
<br />Seven years of silence broken--it's finally here!
<br /><br />A limited supply of Graviola extract, grown and harvested by indigenous people in Brazil, is finally available in America. The full Graviola story--including where you can get it and how to use it--is included in Beyond Chemotherapy: New Cancer Killers, Safe as Mother's Milk, a Health Sciences Institute FREE special bonus report on natural substances that will effectively revolutionize the fight against cancer.

<br />There's absolutely no reason
<br />in the world you should suffer
<br />from arthritis! None!
<br />This new remedy may be just a small addition in a long line of major recent discoveries, but the relief it offers arthritics is nothing short of revolutionary. In fact, we have never seen anything even remotely like it before...
<br />Until now. Our research has uncovered a completely safe and natural food extract that may be the most powerful anti-inflammatory compound ever discovered. 
<br />&quot;I appreciate your newsletter. I love reading honest, informational issues on health. You are helping everyone become a more knowledged individual in this muddled world&quot;
<br />-- Leslie M.
<br />The new discoveries, glucosamine and chondroitin, may be hard to pronounce, but they spell amazing relief and hope because they've opened the door to what was once unthinkable: possible reversal of arthritis! 
<br />These compounds, however, fail to provide arthritis sufferers with a few important benefits needed badly: pain relief and reduction of inflammation. 
<br />These are bigger problems than you might think. You see, the NSAID painkillers arthritis sufferers habitually take (such as ibuprofen) do more harm than just wreak havoc on the stomach and kidneys. They can actually make arthritis worse. 
<br />The second shortcoming of glucosamine and chondroitin is that they leave a major hole in coverage when applied to rheumatoid arthritis. They don't prevent inflammatory compounds from invading and destroying the joints.
<br />Fortunately, there's been a surprising discovery...
<br />Both types of arthritis pain vanish!
<br />&quot;Miracle food&quot; shrinks swollen joints!
<br />A leading researcher from Australia had spent his life studying the world's strongest arthritis drugs, and this new discovery surprised even him when just a small dose shrank inflamed joints by 93 to 97 percent! This could make drugs appear almost obsolete...
<br />Next he benchmarked it against a standard rheumatoid arthritis drug, indomethicin. The new discovery easily trounced this dangerous drug with none of the harsh side effects.
<br />&quot;I am also very grateful to have found HSI!! I find that I want alternative solutions to health problems. Conventional medicine has its place. With all of their technology, they can diagnose illnesses with great accuracy, but as far as curing any type of serious condition such as heart disease and cancer, their treatments are not effective, and at best, may or may not extend a person's life for only a short time.&quot; 
<br />-- Mary R.
<br />According to another researcher from Australia, we're looking at &quot;a very major breakthrough.&quot; That's because this new miracle shuts down a &quot;pain highway&quot; in your body--preventing the chain reaction that stokes the fires of all kinds of inflammation-- including both rheumatoid and osteoarthritis.
<br />Researchers call this &quot;the 5-lipoxygenase pathway.&quot; It's practically the Rosetta Stone of pain and inflammation that drug companies have spent billions trying, but no one's been able to crack it. The only drugs that have shown any hope proved too poisonous to take. So what is this miraculous medicine? Well, it's not a medicine...but a gourmet delicacy.
<br />On the beautiful coastline of New Zealand lives the green-lipped mussel. The native Maori who live there believe that eating the green-lipped mussel leads to a long and healthy life. And they are right; Coastal Maori hardly ever get any kind of arthritis even as they age, living well into their 70s, 80s, and 90s,arthritis-free.
<br />But now you can share in this miracle without resigning yourself to a diet of green-lipped mussels. Because scientists have now homed in on the molecule in this mussel that does the magic. It's totally natural and is it powerful. Even a minute amount blows the doors off ibuprofen and aspirin, and it's 200 times stronger than the next-best natural remedy.
<br />Maybe you've heard that fish oil can relieve arthritis inflammation? It does a good job, but when they tested the very highest potency fish oil supplement against this &quot;mussel molecule&quot;...the mussel extract worked 200 times better. 
<br />The result is a product that brings incredible pain relief--and with it, freedom to move again--without harmful side- effects. No other arthritis treatment can do that.
<br />Health Sciences Institute was among the first to learn about this new product. And, HSI was able to obtain an unprecedented commitment by the manufacturer to reserve a block of the first available shipment exclusively for HSI members--so they all had first dibs!

<br />What manufacturers of
<br />cholesterol-lowering drugs
<br />desperately don't want you to know!
<br />The following facts regarding anti- cholesterol drugs were reported at the annual meeting of the American Heart Association: 
<br />1. For most people, these drugs don't work! An alarming study of 5,600 patients using cholesterol-lowering drugs revealed that a full 62% did not reach their target levels at all.
<br />2. The side effects are horrendous. These include liver toxicity, muscle cramps, nausea, heartburn and hair loss. Quite a price to pay for something that might not even work.
<br />&quot;Thank you for standing up and speaking forth the truth. I appreciate you and all those who are associated with you in faithfully laboring for the freedom of our rights to know what is going on in the medical fields! Our prayers are with you all. Keep up the good work!.&quot;
<br />--Robert L.
<br />3. Anti-cholesterol drugs diminish your mental capacity! Doctors who studied adults using cholesterol-lowering drugs found that the medications are &quot;making their patients stupid&quot;--literally! After just six months of use, the study group showed a marked decline in their mental sharpness as well as their attention span.
<br />There is a very good reason why you've most likely heard nothing about this. The manufacturers of those drugs use their financial clout to make sure you never will. But that's not the worst of it.
<br />Despite these disturbing findings, the drug makers are now promoting these drugs for patients with normal cholesterol levels, too! 
<br />Luckily, as a member of Health Sciences Institute you'll never be a mere pawn in the hands of the drug- makers lobby. Readers of the HSI Members Alert already know they have a much better choice. They already know there is something that can lower LDL (bad) cholesterol levels better than any drug...without side effects.
<br />60 times more effective than vitamin E!
<br />It's a new vitamin, called tocotrienol. I'm sure you've heard that vitamin E can lower your risk of heart disease. What you heard is true--with a &quot;but&quot;...
<br />Not all vitamin E supplements are created equal. In fact, the form of vitamin E sold most widely in stores (alpha-tocopherol) is about the least effective of them all!
<br />So, you may be buying vitamin E regularly...taking the pills religiously...and you might as well be taking sugar pills for all the good it does you. Tocotrienol, however, is different. Very different.
<br />You may already know what antioxidants do. As part of the process of keeping your body alive, the red blood cells deliver oxygen to all your body's cells. The oxygen is &quot;packed&quot; inside the red blood cells bound chemically to their iron molecules. During the process, some unattached oxidative particles are released into the bloodstream. These are called &quot;free radicals.&quot; These particles attack the walls of your arteries and nick and chafe them. Cholesterol molecules now have a foothold to grab onto. The cholesterol build-up is called plaque and the result is heart disease. Antioxidants, such as vitamin E, neutralize the free radicals. 
<br />Tocotrienol is sixty times more potent an antioxidant as the most potent vitamin E you could possibly find. But it does even more than that.
<br />It helps reduce the &quot;clumping&quot; in your blood. It reduces the &quot;stickiness&quot; of the platelets, that leads to the hardening of the arteries, blood clots and strokes...and without any harmful side effects!
<br />Just how &quot;for real&quot; is this new vitamin E? Doctors who read the Health Sciences Institute Members Alert are using tocotrienols on themselves to help prevent heart attacks!
<br />Dr. Randall Wilkinson reports, &quot;I started taking two capsules a day. Thirty days later my LDL cholesterol dropped 23%...I was astonished!&quot;
<br />This new super vitamin E is out now and the Health Sciences Institute has arranged for members to have direct access. You'll find the full details in your FREE Urgent Health Alert Library report New Breakthroughs Against Heart Disease and Stroke.
<br />Tocotrienol is a perfect example of why it's so important you read the Health Sciences Institute Members Alert every month:
<br />The drug companies will never admit the truth about the shortcomings of their products. And, if you think there's little they can do to prevent people from knowing, think again. When they talk, Washington and the advertising-starved media listen.
<br />...And an alternative to aspirin therapy, too!!
<br /><br />Millions take an aspirin a day as a blood-thinning regimen. For many, however, this benefit is hard to stomach. Aspirin is known to cause stomach irritation. 
<br />On top of all the above benefits, tocotrienol will do the same job as aspirin does--but without any stomach irritation! Talk about panacea!
<br />And your doctor, more times than not, is far too busy seeing as many patients as he can to really keep on top of things. Regretfully, far too many doctors succumb to the intense pressure--from peers and from the drug companies--to tow the line and not make waves. You have to be very brave to stand up to the medical establishment.
<br />Now, you can be sure you're receiving information that's cutting edge...reliable AND has your best intentions at heart--by joining the prestigious ranks of the Health Sciences Institute membership.

<br />Slash 20 years off your age!
<br />You mean increase muscle mass?...Bolster endurance?...
<br />Supercharge sexual response?...Melt off body fat?... 
<br />Restore hair growth?...Slash LDL cholesterol?...
<br />Bolster immune system?...Improve skin texture and regain elasticity? 
<br />Remarkable...unthinkable...but a resounding &quot;Yes!!&quot; 
<br />As mind boggling as it may sound, getting older is natural--but aging is not! 
<br />Practically every cell in your body regenerates every seven years or so. All the mechanisms that made you grow are still in place. We think aging is normal. But, as more and more longevity research confirms, aging is actually a correctable malfunction!
<br />You've surely read many articles about new supplements that help retard the aging process, but the general media is actually way, way behind the news. Retarding the process is one thing. But the latest discoveries already show how you can actually reverse your biological age and become physically younger--with complete safety--today! 
<br />The great teasing fountain of youth
<br />You've probably seen hundreds of books and articles about such fashionable &quot;youth&quot; hormones as DHEA and melatonin, but the truth is that these popular supplements are but minor players in the emerging field of longevity medicine. 
<br />While useful and effective, these hormones pale to insignificance when compared to the &quot;great tease&quot; of the longevity study field: Human Growth Hormone (HGH). The story has more twists and turns than a great detective novel, but the result is well worth the wait.
<br />First, there was the promise--or the tease, if you will...
<br />Human Growth Hormone (HGH), also known as somatotropin, is produced in the pituitary gland on orders from the hypothalamus gland. 
<br />HGH holds the key to the aging process. It stimulates the growth and maintenance of bone tissue and muscle mass. It also facilitates the repair of damaged DNA within the cell as well as proper cell division. Low levels of HGH contribute to faster aging while high levels of HGH slow the aging process and even reverse it. 
<br />Dr. Daniel Rudman, a noted longevity researcher, stunned the world by reporting the results of his experiments with Human Growth Hormone in The New England Journal of Medicine. He injected HGH into a study group of 12 elderly men and managed to reverse their biological age &quot;by 10 to 20 years.&quot; 
<br />Dr. Rudman administered HGH to his group three times a week for six months. During that period, Dr. Rudman has recorded a reduction of their body fat by an average of 14 percent, while lean muscle mass increased by almost 9 percent. Their skin grew measurably thicker and more youthful looking and they reported more energy and an increased sex drive.
<br />Then came the disappointment
<br />During the seventh month of injections several subjects developed debilitating carpal tunnel syndrome. Others developed severe arthritis, high blood pressure, congestive heart disease, and diabetic-like conditions. 
<br />&quot;I love your attitude, I love your spirit, and I totally appreciate the work you do in helping to keep us all informed.&quot; 
<br />-- Sheryl W.
<br />Although the side effects diminished when the drug was discontinued--so did the benefits. An even greater fear was that unleashing a stimulated cell growth would also disarm the body's mechanism that prevents uncontrolled cell division, unleashing tumors and cancer. HGH seemed like a dead end because of the side effects, so Dr. Rudman stopped the study. But, by that time, there was no stuffing the genie back into the bottle. 
<br />Dr. Rudman's research unleashed worldwide HGH research. Studies conducted at every corner of the globe proved beyond doubt both sides of Dr. Rudman's findings. HGH is for real. It really works--and it's really dangerous. 
<br />But, for some, the promise of a &quot;youth injection&quot; is too alluring. Even today, there are physicians in America who &quot;specialize&quot; in HGH anti-aging medicine. They will provide it to those who can afford it, for around $1,000 a month. 
<br />For most people, however, it seemed as if HGH was just another wistful &quot;fountain of youth&quot; pipe dream...but NOT anymore! The HGH story actually has a happy ending. A brilliant way has been found to employ the amazing rejuvenating power of HGH without any of the dangers. 
<br />Here's the full story.
<br />Somatopause: The stunning discovery 
<br />For a very long time the medical world assumed that the production of growth hormone in the body naturally decreased over the years. And the only way to get the hormone level up again was the risky and extremely expensive injection of HGH. 
<br />But now, a groundbreaking presentation by Dr. James Jamison and Dr. L. E. Dorman before the American College for the Advancement of Medicine in 1997 shattered that myth. And it opened the road to real, affordable--and safe--age reversal to everyone who wishes it.
<br />What Dr. Jamison and Dr. Dorman found was that the production of HGH in the body does not decline over the years. The body continues to produce abundant quantities of HGH well into one's 90s (unless one suffers from a pituitary gland disorder). What declines is the body's efficiency in releasing the HGH it produces. 
<br />What doctors Jamison and Dorman discovered was that lower levels of HGH over the years are not &quot;normal&quot; but, rather, a malfunction! This malfunction is called somatopause. It's a condition under which the body gradually loses its ability to rejuvenate itself the way it should. 
<br />Getting old is NOT normal!
<br />This groundbreaking research concluded that if a way was found to allow the body to release its own HGH, aging would halt automatically. There is no need to inject HGH into the body at all. 
<br />Similarly, it was proven that, while foreign Human Growth Hormone was potentially dangerous, the body's own natural HGH was completely safe. So, if there was a way to unleash the body's own natural HGH, there will be no side effects or risks involved. And that way was found.
<br />Finally: The end of aging
<br />Dr. Jamison and Dr. Dorman have concentrated their efforts on natural substances called secretagogues. These substances reverse the decline in the body's ability to release its own HGH. They have identified several natural compounds that, working together, enhance the body's production, release and utilization of HGH.
<br />The result of their research was a compound that includes specific amino acids, proteins, and botanical extracts. This compound stimulates receptors in the pituitary and hypothalamus glands and help release the body's own sequestered stores of growth hormone.
<br />The results were stunning. A study that included 36 people has shown that the new compound exceeds the benefits of HGH injections...without side effects OR the $1,000 a month price tag!
<br />Researchers measured the HGH levels in the group participants' blood and their numbers where overwhelming. HGH levels in the blood rose a whopping 30% naturally over a period of 12 weeks. But the study participants themselves required no academic data to tell them this amazing compound was working. 
<br />After as little as four weeks all the study participants reported improved energy, endurance and body composition. After eight weeks the participants reported new hair growth, restoration of hair color and improved skin texture. And there were no reported side effects whatsoever!

<br />&quot;I'm 70 years old and feel as I did at least back in my 30's.&quot;
<br />&quot;After about a month of taking the treatment, without making any other changes in my lifestyle; I noticed my body was responding so much better. My allergies, eyes, nostrils, breathing, energy levels and thinking ability all improved. Every day I had that top-of-the-world healthy feeling. I'm 70 years old and feel as I did at least back in my 30's. My movements and abilities to perform have returned to youthful levels.&quot; 
<br /><br />L. B. NV 
<br />&quot;Goodbye high blood pressure!&quot; 
<br />&quot;Before taking the treatment I had been on blood pressure medication for years. After taking it for only 2-3 weeks, I was able to stop taking my blood pressure medication. My blood pressure is now normal.&quot; 
<br /><br />L. G. Banning, CA
<br />&quot;So long arthritis pain!&quot;
<br />&quot;I am 81 years old, and before I started taking the the treatment I was experiencing arthritis pain and low energy. I have tried many other products that claim to do the same thing but none of them ever worked. After one month of taking the treatment, I noticed a decrease in my arthritic pain and have a lot more energy. I actually want to get out and work instead of just lay around the house.&quot;

<br />Quit griping about your church;

<br />*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*
<br />If a church wants a better pastor, it only needs to pray for the one it has.
<br />*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*
<br />God Himself doesn't propose to judge a man until he is dead. So why should you?

<br />God grades on the cross, not the curve.
<br />*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+* 
<br />God loves everyone, but probably prefers 'fruits of the spirit' over 'religious nuts!'
<br />*+*+*+* +*+* +*+*+*+* 
<br />God promises a safe landing, not a calm passage.
<br />*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*
<br />He who angers you, controls you!

<br /><br />I have something to shear with all of you out there ok.
<br />You no when some one dos something bad to you.
<br />And it all waysaids what gos around comes around.
<br />Well this is a story and it dos not matter good or bad,
<br />If  you do something good then something good is going to come around to you
<br />If you do something bad then something bad is going to come around to you so
<br />Remmber that ok all ways do good ok here is the storry jerry
<br /><br />WHAT GOES AROUND COMES AROUND
<br /><br />One day a man saw an old lady, stranded on the side of the road, but even in the dim light of day, he could see she needed help. So he pulled up in front of her Mercedes and got out. His old Pontiac was still sputtering when he approached her. 
<br /><br />Even with the smile on his face, she was worried. No one had stopped to help for the last hour or so. Was he going to hurt her? He didn't look safe; he looked poor and hungry.
<br /><br />He could see that she was frightened, standing out there in the cold. He knew how she felt. It was that chill which only fear can put in you.
<br /><br />He said, 'I'm here to help you, ma'am. Why don't you wait in the car where it's warm? By the way, my name is Bryan Anderson.'
<br /><br />Well, all she had was a flat tire, but for an old lady, that was bad enough. Bryan crawled under the car looking for a place to put the jack, skinning his knuckles a time or two. Soon he was able to change the tire. But he had to get dirty and his hands hurt.
<br />&lt; BR&gt;As he was tightening up the lug nuts, she rolled down the window and began to talk to him. She told him that she was from St. Louis and was only just passing through. She couldn't thank him enough for coming to her aid.
<br /><br />Bryan just smiled as he closed her trunk. The lady asked how much she owed him. Any amount would have been all right with her. She already imagined all the awful things that could have happened had he not stopped. Bryan never thought twice about being paid. This was not a job to him. This was helping someone in need, and God knows there were plenty, who had given him a hand in the past. He had lived his whole life that way, and it never occurred to him to act any other way.
<br /><br />He told her that if she really wanted to pa y him back, the next time she saw someone who needed help, she could give that person the assistance they needed, and Bryan added, 'And think of me.'
<br /><br />He waited until she started her car and drove off. It had been a cold and depressing day, but he felt good as he headed for home, disappearing into the twilight.
<br /><br />A few miles down the road the lady saw a small cafe. She went in to grab a bite to eat, and take the chill off before she made the last leg of her trip home. It was a dingy looking restaurant. Outside were two old gas pumps. The whole scene was unfamiliar to her. The waitress came over and brought a clean towel to wipe her wet hair. She had a sweet smile, one that even being on her feet for the whole day couldn't erase. The lady noticed the waitress was nearly eight months pregnant, but she never let the strain and aches change her attitude. The old lady wondered how someone who had so little could be so giving to a stranger. Then she remembered Bryan .
<br /><br />After the lady finished her meal, she paid with a hundred dollar bill. The waitress quickly went to get change for her hundred dollar bill, but the old lady had slipped right out the door. She was gone by the time the waitress came back. The waitress wondered where the lady could be. Then she noticed something written on the napkin.
<br /><br />There were tears in her eyes when she read what the lady wrote: 'You don't owe me anything. I have been there too. Somebody once helped me out, the way I'm helping you. If you really want to pay me back, here is what you do: Do not let this chain of love end with you.'
<br /><br />Under the napkin were four more $100 bills.
<br /><br />Well, there were tables to clear, sugar bowls to fill, and people to serve, but the waitress made it through another day. That night when she got home from work and climbed into bed, she was thinking about the
<br />money and what the l ady had written. How could the lady have known how much she and her husband needed it? With the baby due next month, it was going to be hard....
<br /><br />She knew how worried her husband was, and as he lay sleeping next to her, she gave him a soft kiss and whispered soft and low, 'Everything's going to be all right. I love you, Bryan Anderson.'
<br /><br />There is an old saying 'What goes around comes around.' Today I sent you this story, and I'm asking you to pass it on. Let this light shine.
<br /><br />Don't delete it, don't return it. Simply, pass this on to a friend
<br /><br />Good friends are like stars....You don't always see them, but you know they are always there. 
<br /><br />~GOD BLESS!~

<br /><br />2 Corinthians 12:1-5
<br /><br />We are all interested in where our departed loved ones went at death. Did they go directly to heaven-- or to hell-- to purgatory? Are they conscious? And if so, are they aware of what we are doing here on earth; do that know about our sorrow, how we miss them? Well, that's our study today. We are glad you have joined us.
<br /><br />My friend, we are truly grateful to you for inviting us into your home to study the Bible In Search of the Lord's Way to become and to be a Christian. We are presented here by the courtesy and generosity of members of churches of Christ in the viewing area of this station. Thanks for inviting us in. Today's program is titled, Where Are the Dead?
<br /><br />Many of you have written us for information concerning the whereabouts of your recently departed loved ones. Well, to answer each of these letters adequately is beyond our ability to do so. There is more than what we can put in a single letter. So, because we are all interested in things having to do with a future life, I decided to do it in this program. We would all like to know all we can about where people go immediately after death. And we would like to know, if possible, whether the dead are in a state of consciousness, and if so, are they aware of what we do here. It isn't mere curiosity every time. We will never be able to answer all the questions about death and dying, but that's probably a blessing. I am sure God loves us enough that if He felt we should know more about these things, He would have told us more in the Scriptures. So, we will content ourselves with what He has revealed. Now after Ken Helterbrand leads us in a spiritual song, we'll be back to see what He has said in his word.

<br /><br />Our reading today is from the apostle Paul’s second letter to the church at Corinth; and it is in chapter 12. We will read the first five verses. “It is therefore not profitable for me to boast. I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord: I know a man in Christ who fourteen years ago—whether in the body I do not know, or whether out of the body I do not know, God knows—such a one was caught up to the third heaven. And I know such a man—whether in the body or out of the body I do not know, God knows—how he was caught up into Paradise and heard inexpressible words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter. Of such a one I will boast; yet of myself I will not boast, except in my infirmities.” Now let us go to God in prayer. Holy Father, we are so thankful to You that You understand the sorrow that we bear on the death of a loved one, in the separation from us here in this world. And we know that You understand, too, that we are interested in where our departed saints have gone. And we pray You will bless our study today so that we can be comforted; and we can be encouraged; and we can be made stronger in the faith because of the lesson today. This is our prayer in the name of Jesus, Amen!
<br /><br />Physicians and psychologists and sociologists and even others have made some in-depth studies of the subject of death and dying. Well, they have even compiled some very interesting information about the &quot;near death&quot; experiences of their patients; information that the have obtained from people who reportedly experienced something like the man of whom we read in 2 Corinthians chapter 12, a moment ago.
<br /><br />Some might think that we would do well to quote some of those people here, or maybe even have a panel of physicians and psychologists who have treated these patients who could comment &quot;authoritatively&quot; about such matters. Well, they might tell us where people were, and what they saw, and what they heard during their experiences and all that. But on second thought, would that add authenticity to our study any at all? If you are interested in that any of you can go to your local library, wherever you live, and check out those books and see for yourself what they said. We are concerned about what we can learn from God's holy word, the Bible.
<br /><br />During our Lord's incarnation, He raised several people from the dead-- people we know were dead. One was Jairus' daughter as recorded in Matthew, the ninth chapter. Another was the widow's son in the village of Nain recorded in Luke, chapter seven. But the best known was Lazarus, many of the details of which are given us in John, the eleventh chapter. We don't know how long the others had been dead. The widow's son's body, we know was being carried in a casket, to what seems to have been its burial when Jesus restored him to life. But Lazarus had been dead four days and his body had begun to deteriorate. Now we read that in verses 17 and 39. Well, our Lord commanded him, &quot;Lazarus, come forth,&quot; and the dead man came forth from the grave. He walked and talked with his family and with friends.
<br /><br />Now, don't you suppose some of those friends who had comforted his sisters while Lazarus was dead, and the multitudes who came to see him after he was raised, were curious about where he was and what he knew during those four days? And, don't you suppose they asked him some questions? Oh, I am sure they did. But, there's no such conversation recorded in the Scriptures about all that.
<br /><br />And don't you know after the crowds had gone, and Mary and Martha could talk with their brother in the quietness and in the privacy of their own home, that they would ask him some questions. &quot;Lazarus, where were you those four days? What did you see and what did you hear? Did you know how we grieved over your death? Did you know about the funeral service we had for you? Did you know that Jesus came and wept with us?&quot; Well, of course they had many questions. But inspiration says nothing about it. It isn’t revealed to us.
<br /><br />I have a good idea from what we learn from 2 Corinthians, chapter twelve, that when Lazarus returned to his body, those things faded from his memory, and he couldn't have related them if he had wanted to do so. Paul said of himself, &quot;whether in the body, I do not know, or whether out of the body I do not know. God knows...how he was caught up into Paradise and heard inexpressible words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter.&quot; Now if Paul was forbidden to report what he saw and heard, surely the widow's son was, too; and Jairus' daughter, and Lazarus, and even those who may have had similar experiences in our own generation. In fact, if one of them should tell us about what he saw and heard in such an experience, we would question his or maybe even her integrity because of what the Scripture revealed to us in this passage.
<br /><br />So, what does the Bible say? Well, man is of dual nature. He is physical. His body is of the earth; it’s earthy. His spirit is of God, spiritual. Paul declares: &quot;While our outward man (the body) perishes, yet the inward man (the spirit) is renewed day by day.&quot; That is 2 Corinthians chapter 4, verse 16. From Ecclesiastes chapter 12, verse 7, we learn at death the body returns to the earth from which God formed it in the beginning and the spirit returns to God who gave it (Zechariah chapter 12, verse1). Well, the Holy Spirit clearly divides the human being into flesh and spirit, and declares the flesh came from one source and the spirit another when He says, &quot;We have had human fathers who corrected us, and we paid them respect. Shall we not much more readily be in subjection to the Father of spirits and live?&quot; That is Hebrews chapter 12, verse 9.
<br /><br />Now we know what Jesus meant when He said to the penitent thief on the cross, &quot;Assuredly, I say to you, today you will be with Me in Paradise&quot; (Luke 23, verse 43). Though they both would do that day, would die that day I should say, the spirit of each one of them would continue on in Paradise. And later Jesus cried with a loud voice and said, &quot;Father, into Your hands I commit My spirit. Having said this, He breathed His last.&quot; His body became lifeless, and he was taken by friends, the body was, and buried. In the seventh chapter of Acts we have the story of the stoning of Stephen. As he died, he cried, &quot;Lord, Jesus, receive my spirit&quot; (verse 59). So people don't cease to exist at death. The body goes to the grave and to ashes, and the spirit lives on somewhere.
<br /><br />Does the spirit go immediately to its eternal destiny, to Heaven or to Hell? Perhaps you have heard preachers at the funeral of a loved one say something to the effect maybe like this, &quot;Oh, your dear mother is right now in Heaven singing in the angels' choir.&quot; Well, I'm sorry, but that is a mistake. In the first place, it isn't within him to say where mother is. Funerals are not for the purpose of determining the destiny of the departed spirit, or where the deceased will spend eternity. And too, the spirit of the saved person does not go directly into Heaven, if by &quot;heaven&quot; we mean the eternal dwelling place of God. The Spirit, the real &quot;we&quot; goes, rather to another place to await the judgment, and then to the eternal abode, after judgment.
<br /><br />There are several reasons for my saying that. First, the Bible teaches that there is to be a general judgment when all men will be judged. That subject is worthy of a complete program; and we will just say here that if people were judged at death and went immediately and directly to Heaven or to Hell, there would be no purpose for the judgment. Jesus spoke of this judgment day as being universal in all its scope. He said &quot;All nations&quot; will be there (Matthew 25:31- 32). He also said, &quot;The men of Nineveh will rise in the judgment with this generation&quot; (Matthew 12:41), and in the next verse, &quot;The Queen of the South will rise up in the judgment with this generation.&quot; The men of Nineveh lived 500 years, something like that, before Christ's day on the earth, and the Queen of the South lived a thousand years before. Yet Jesus said they would be in the same judgment with people of His generation-- and ours.
<br /><br />And when Peter preached on the day of Pentecost, he said, &quot;David has not yet ascended into Heaven&quot; (Acts 2:32). David, too, had been dead a thousand years, but the Holy Spirit by the mouth of Peter said he had not yet ascended into Heaven. And, the Bible says &quot;The Lord knows how to deliver the godly out of temptations and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished&quot; (2 Peter 2 and 9). So where are the Ninevites, the Queen of the South, David, the unjust and all the others who have died and gone from among us? Well, they are somewhere awaiting the same judgment in which you and I will appear. Well, where is that?
<br /><br />Are they in Purgatory? The Bible has nothing to say about purgatory. Neither the word nor the doctrine is found in the Scriptures, so we will not spend a lot of time here, but we will examine it as a legitimate part of this study. Since it is not a biblical doctrine, we turn to other literature to learn what we know about it. From the Encyclopedia of Religion and Religions by Pike, and the Encyclopedia Britannica, we learn the idea was first conceived by Thomas Aquinas, thirteenth century theologian-philosopher. It became a part of the Catholic doctrine at the Council of Trent (1545 to 1563). Simply and briefly stated, purgatory is thought to be a state of suffering after death in which the souls of those who die in &quot;venial sin,&quot; and those who still owe some debt of temporal punishment for &quot;mortal sin,&quot; are rendered fit to enter into Heaven. But, since the Bible says nothing about it and since the Bible holds no hope of another chance after death for salvation before the judgment, well, we may be certain our departed loved ones are not there.
<br /><br />Well, are they in Hades? We often use the word &quot;Hades&quot; and &quot;Hell&quot; interchangeably, but they are not the same. &quot;Hades&quot; is the unseen world, the world of departed spirits. The word also means &quot;all-receiving,&quot; as it receives every spirit that departs this life in this world, both the good and the bad. Even Jesus went to Hades for those three days and nights his body was in the tomb (Acts 2 and verse 27- 31). Unfortunately the old King James Version translates the word as &quot;Hell&quot; in those verses, but the New King James, the American Standard and other versions translate it &quot;Hades.&quot; So every person who dies goes to Hades. All of our friends and loved ones who have died have gone to Hades.
<br /><br />But Jesus promised the thief on the cross, &quot;Today shalt thou be with me in &quot;Paradise.&quot; Right? Then Paradise is that part of, or shall we say a state in Hades to which the righteous go. But Paradise is not &quot;Heaven,&quot; if we mean by &quot;heaven&quot; the dwelling place of God, the eternal abode of the righteous. No, it isn’t. Jesus spent those three days and nights in Paradise, in Hades. But after He was raised from the dead He told Mary, &quot;Touch me not, for I have not yet ascended to the Father. (John 20:17). &quot;Paradise&quot; means &quot;a pleasure garden.&quot; Yes, it is sometimes used with reference to Heaven, but that doesn't mean it always means Heaven. Heaven is also called a &quot;city,&quot; but that doesn't mean every city mentioned in the Bible is Heaven. The departed saved people are in Paradise, Hades awaiting the judgment, after which they will enter into Heaven for all eternity.
<br /><br />We mentioned a moment ago that God &quot;...knows how to deliver the godly out of temptations and to reserve the unjust under punishment for the day of judgment, and especially those who walk according to the flesh in the lust of uncleanness and despise authority&quot; (2 Peter 3:9 and 10). Well, where are the unjust reserved? Well, they are in &quot;Hades&quot; too, because Hades is the place of &quot;all receiving,&quot; receiving all, but they are in the place or &quot;state&quot; called Tartarus in Hades. In 2 Peter chapter 2, verse 4, Peter declared &quot;For God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to Tartarus, and delivered them into the chains of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment.&quot; Again, it's unfortunate that the King James translates Tartarus as &quot;Hell” in that verse. Other versions correct that. Tartarus is in Hades, on the other side of &quot;a fixed gulf&quot; from Paradise as we read in Luke chapter 16, verses 19 to 31. From 2 Peter 2 and 4, we can know that is where all of the wicked, the unforgiven people have gone to await the judgment. It is not &quot;Hell.&quot; It is not the eternal abode of the unforgiven wicked dead. It is a prison where they are held until judgment day. And of course, there is torment in Hades, if for no other reason, just knowing as the rich man did, that he was unsaved. After the judgment, they will enter into &quot;Hell&quot; itself, where they will suffer eternally. Let’s pray. Thank you, Father, for this information that we have in Your word about where our departed loved ones have gone. Help us to apply our lives so that we can be prepared to go and to be with Thee. In Jesus’ name we pray. Amen!
<br /><br />So my friend, our departed loved ones are in Hades. If they were saved by an obedient faith in Jesus Christ, they are in Paradise, Hades; awaiting the judgment to go on into Heaven to live forever with the Lord. If they died without Christ, they are in Tartarus, Hades; awaiting the Day of Judgment, and there's a great gulf fixed so that they can't cross over into Paradise and eventually into Heaven. And, all the dead are fully conscious. The righteous are enjoying the pleasure garden of Paradise, and the unrighteous are imprisoned and are tormented in Tartarus, Hades. None of them know what we are doing here on the earth (Ecclesiastes 9:4 and 5). And if they did, it's very likely they would be like the rich man of whom Jesus spoke in Luke 16. They would urgently want someone to send a message to be saved at once and without delay.
<br /><br />My friend, God has made every provision He can to prevent man from a life of punishment in the other world. However, in His righteous character, God must punish the wicked and disobedient as well as reward the righteous and the obedient. A person's eternal destiny is irrevocably determined by the time he dies. The Bible doesn't offer any other chance beyond the grave. It says nothing of the works of supererogation. In his story of the rich man and Lazarus in Luke 16, Jesus makes it clear that there is no crossing the great gulf to go from Paradise to Tartarus or from Tartarus to Paradise. So, it is important that we give attention to the important things while we may. If you are not a Christian, oh, I pray that you'll obey Christ today in repentance and baptism-- that you will do it at once.

<br /><br />TITLE: WHERE ARE THE DEAD? 
<br /><br />Subtitle: When Someone Dies, What Happens To Their Soul? 
<br /><br />Surely those who devote serious thought to the subject will eventually arrive at the conclusion that there has to be more to man than meets the eye. Experience shows that there is a totally unique abstract being associated with each individual and it manifests itself through the ability to think and reason. Thus, the &quot;real you&quot; is that immaterial person--that personality--which  utilizes electrical impulses within your brain and is a distinct entity from the body itself. And because this fact is recognized, medical science generally defines life as a state of possessing brain activity. 
<br /><br />That mysterious force we call &quot;life&quot; is something man cannot duplicate. Every living thing--every blade of grass, every insect, every animal--possesses it and we can only observe its duration and take note of its inevitable departure. But where did it originate and where does it go? It is apparent that life begets life in a seemingly unending cycle and it ends abruptly in what we call &quot;death.&quot; But is this brief existence all there is to it? The Bible informs us that there is far more involved than is obtainable by scientific observation. 
<br /><br />In the Book of Genesis, we find the following statement about man's origin: 
<br /><br />&quot;And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul&quot; Genesis 2:7 (KJV). 
<br /><br />Then in the Book of Psalms, King David had this to say about God's role in his own creation: 
<br /><br />&quot; I will praise thee; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made: marvellous are thy works; and that my soul knoweth right well [15] My substance was not hid from thee, when I was made in secret, and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth.&quot; Psalm 139:14-15 (KJV). 
<br /><br />So human life as we know it began with God's creation of Adam--in which the life force itself was given and has passed on to us by virtue of an unbroken string of procreation. Plants and animals were also given life, but not endowed with the human faculties of self-awareness and reasoning. (While it is true that some animals have displayed a  rudimentary ability to reason, it is nowhere near that of a very young child.) This ability to think and communicate sets humans apart and establishes each of us as a distinct personality. Then theology goes further by defining man as a dual being, consisting of body and soul/spirit--material and immaterial. The distinction between soul and spirit (terms which are often used interchangeably) is that &quot;soul&quot; can refer to both the material and immaterial aspects, while &quot;spirit&quot; is strictly immaterial--not including the body. 
<br /><br />Our thoughts, motives, and actions make up who we really are. And it is to these the Bible refers as being our &quot;heart&quot;--our innermost being, our &quot;soul&quot;--the immaterial essence of self that will exist forever in the sight of the God Who created us. So when He removes the life force at &quot;death&quot;, the body ceases to function and returns to the dust from which it was created, but according to the Word of God our imperishable soul/spirit lives on! Where it will spend eternity is the point of our discussion. 
<br /><br />As is the usual case with Scripture, we must try to piece together all it has to say on any given subject before arriving at a conclusion. In the Old Testament the departed dead were said to have gone to sheowl--or &quot;Sheol,&quot;--the Hebrew term for the grave, or place of the dead. The New Testament Greek equivalent is haides, or &quot;Hades&quot;. (In most instances, the King James Version translates both terms as &quot;hell.&quot<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/wink.gif" alt=":)" /> But the definitive teaching concerning the destiny of those who reject Christ as Lord and Savior is found in the Lord's own Words of Luke chapter sixteen: 
<br /><br />[19] &quot;There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day: [20] And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, which was laid at his gate, full of sores, [21] And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores. [22] And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom: the rich man also died, and was buried; [23] And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom. [24] And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame. [25] But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented. [26] And beside all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed: so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot; neither can they pass to us, that would come from thence. [27] Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest send him to my father's house: [28] For I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torment. [29] Abraham saith unto him, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them. [30] And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one went unto them from the dead, they will repent. [31] And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead&quot; Luke 16:19-31 (KJV, emphasis mine) 
<br /><br />In verse 23 we see that the rich man went to &quot;hell&quot; (Hades)--the place of the dead. And the context of the verse places Lazarus at the very least in the same vicinity, because they could see each other. However, their immediate circumstances were completely different. The unnamed rich man is in &quot;torments&quot; (plural) and &quot;in this flame&quot; (vs.24), while Lazarus is said to have been &quot;in the bosom of Abraham&quot; and comforted (vs.25). Between these two obviously different places was a &quot;great gulf&quot; or chasm, which prohibited anyone from moving from one to the other. And due to this teaching, various theologians have theorized that during the Old Testament era (prior to Christ's atoning sacrifice on the cross), this place of the dead was comprised of two &quot;compartments&quot;--a place of torment and Paradise, the home of the redeemed. Remember that the Lord told the thief on the cross, &quot;to day shalt thou be with Me in paradise&quot; (Luke 23:43). Then when the Lord was resurrected, He  &quot;led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men&quot; (Eph.4:8), leading many to believe He emptied Paradise of elect believers by taking them to Heaven--the abode of God. But in any case, it should be clear from what the Lord had to say that all who die will go to one of two separate places--&quot;heaven or hell&quot; as the terms have come to be known. 
<br /><br />However, to refer to the redeemed as being &quot;dead&quot; is not proper terminology according to what the Lord had to say to the Saddicees in the following passage: 
<br /><br />[18] &quot;Then come unto him the Sadducees, which say there is no resurrection; and they asked him, saying, [19] Master, Moses wrote unto us, If a man's brother die, and leave his wife behind him, and leave no children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother. [20] Now there were seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and dying left no seed. [21] And the second took her, and died, neither left he any seed: and the third likewise. [22] And the seven had her, and left no seed: last of all the woman died also. [23] In the resurrection therefore, when they shall rise, whose wife shall she be of them? for the seven had her to wife. [24] And Jesus answering said unto them, Do ye not therefore err, because ye know not the scriptures, neither the power of God? [25] For when they shall rise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage; but are as the angels which are in heaven. [26] And as touching the dead, that they rise: have ye not read in the book of Moses, how in the bush God spake unto him, saying, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? [27] He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living: ye therefore do greatly err&quot; Mark 12:18-27 (KJV, emphasis mine). 
<br /><br />The Sadducees denied any possibility of a literal resurrection of the dead and were trying to entrap the Lord by using a silly 
<br />&quot;what if&quot; situation involving what was termed &quot;levirate marriage&quot;--under Mosaic Law the requirement that an unmarried brother was obligated to marry his brother's widow in order to perpetuate the family line. So after 7 brothers were married to the same woman, they wanted to know whose wife she would be at the resurrection. The Lord ruined their day by pointing out that the resurrection changes everything! Saints in glorified bodies will not retain the human distinctions and relationships (male, female, married, single, etc.) of their former lives. But the phrase I have underlined above immediately arrests our attention because of  its tremendous implications! The Lord refuted the Sadducees' belief about there being no resurrection of the dead by quoting Exodus 3:6 and informing that when God spoke to Moses from the burning bush, He said &quot;I am&quot; the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob--not &quot;I was&quot; their God!!!! In other words, their souls/spirits were still very much in existence and living in God's presence. We also see this demonstrated in Matthew 17:3 when Moses and Elijah appeared on the mount of transfiguration with the Lord and carried on a conversation with Him while Peter, James, and John looked on in amazement. Their mortal bodies had long since been in the grave, but they had the ability to materialize in bodily form. 
<br /><br />In the Book of Second Corinthians, the Apostle Paul makes several comments which give us additional insight into the transistion between this life and the next: 
<br /><br />&quot;[1] For we know that if the tent which is our earthly home is destroyed (dissolved), we have from God a building, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. [2] Here indeed, in this (present abode, body) we sigh and groan inwardly, because we yearn to be clothed over--to put on our celestial body like a garment, to be fitted out--with our heavenly dwelling; [3] So that by putting it on we may not be found naked--without a body. [4] For while we are still in this tent, we groan under the burden and sigh deeply--weighed down, depressed, oppressed; not that we want to put off the body (the clothing of the spirit), but rather that we would be further clothed, so that what is mortal (our dying body) may be swallowed up by life [after the resurrection]. [5] Now He Who has fashioned us (preparing and making us fit) for this very thing is God, Who also has given us the (Holy) Spirit as a guarantee [of the fulfillment of His promise]. [6] So then, we are always full of good and hopeful and confident courage; we know that while we are at home in the body we are abroad from the home with the Lord [that is promised us]. [7] For we walk by faith [that is, we regulate our lives and conduct ourselves by our conviction or belief respecting man's relationship to God and divine things, with trust and holy fervor; thus we walk] not by sight or appearance. [8] [Yes] we have confident and hopeful courage, and are well-pleased rather to be away from home out of the body and be at home with the Lord&quot; 2 Corinthians 5:1-8, (Parallel Bible KJV/Amplified Bible commentary, emphasis mine). 
<br /><br />Referring to our body as a &quot;tent,&quot; or temporary dwelling, Paul makes it clear that believers have a &quot;building, a house not made with hands&quot; waiting for us in the heavens. But while we are still in our mortal bodies, we have the Holy Spirit within us as God's guarantee, or &quot;earnest&quot; (2 Cor.1:22 and 5:5) that His promise of an eternal body will be fulfilled. Then in verse 8 Paul expresses his desire to be &quot;away from home out of the body&quot; and to be &quot;at home with the Lord.&quot; He was an old man at that time, extremely weary from his duties as an apostle, and wistfully expressing the desire to leave his tent--his mortal body--behind so that he could finally stand before the Lord in his &quot;celestial body&quot; (vs 2). But it appears from other comments Paul makes in the Book of First Corinthians (Chapter 15) that the glorified, or celestial, body will not be a complete reality for believers until the  &quot;the last trump&quot; (vs.52)--the Rapture of the Church. Therefore, many theologians believe the soul/spirits of departed believers exist with God in some sort of intermediate state until the rapture reunites them with resurrected, glorified bodies. 
<br /><br />But it should be clear that &quot;death&quot; for the believer is merely an instantaneous change of address as we move from one realm of reality to another of infinitely greater importance and duration. Under normal circumstances (the Rapture being the exception) the body is left behind just like an empty house after the occupants have moved. But praise the Lord, one day soon He is coming for His Church and all who have left their houses behind will receive them again--but as completely new and perfect versions! Believers who are alive at that time will just change locations and receive a glorified body in the process. 
<br /><br />So the comments of the Lord concerning the rich man and Lazarus, coupled with the teaching of the Apostle Paul, leads us to believe that death is merely the separation of the body from the soul/spirit. An instantaneous transition occurs in which our immortal essence passes from this present reality of being a prisoner of time into the realm of eternity--each to his own fate as determined by the infinite mind of God Himself. This truth we find expressed in the following: 
<br /><br />&quot;But after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God; [6] Who will render to every man according to his deeds: [7] To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honour and immortality, eternal life: [8] But unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath, [9] Tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that doeth evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile&quot; Romans 2:5-9 (KJV, emphasis mine). 
<br /><br />For which destination are you now headed? 
<br /><br />If you have been born again and received Jesus Christ as your personal Savior, but have been very lukewarm in your spiritual walk with Him, you need to immediately ask Him for forgiveness and for renewal. He will instantly forgive you, and fill your heart with the joy of the Holy Spirit. Then, you need to begin a daily walk of prayer and personal Bible Study. 
<br /><br />If you have never placed your trust in Jesus Christ as your Savior, but have come to sense His reality and the approaching End of the Age, and want to receive His FREE Gift of Eternal Life, you can do so now, in the privacy of your home. Once you truly believe in Him as Lord and Savior, you are spiritually Born Again, and are as assured of Heaven as if you were already there. Then, you can rest assured that the Kingdom of Antichrist will not touch you spiritually. If you would like to become Born Again, turn to our Salvation Page now. 
<br /><br />We hope you have been blessed by this ministry, which seeks to educate and warn people, so that they can see the coming New World Order—Kingdom of Antichrist—in their daily news.

<br /><br />“And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments. . .” Luke 16:23 
<br /><br />What you're about to read is hard to believe. . .
<br /><br />We're going to examine the place the Bible calls hell. We'll present documented evidence for a place called hell. Don't take what you're going to read lightly. If what you read is true — YOU COULD BE IN SERIOUS DANGER! 
<br /><br />Several years ago a book was published, entitled Beyond Death's Door by Dr. Maurice Rawlings. Dr. Rawlings, a specialist in Internal Medicine and Cardiovascular Disease, resuscitated many people who had been clinically dead. Dr. Rawlings, a devout atheist, &quot;considered all religion &quot;hocus-pocus&quot; and death nothing more than a painless extinction&quot;. But something happened in 1977 that brought a dramatic change in the life of Dr. Rawlings! He was resuscitating a man, terrified and screaming — descending down into the flames of hell: 
<br />&quot;Each time he regained heartbeat and respiration, the patient screamed, &quot;I am in hell!&quot; He was terrified and pleaded with me to help him. I was scared to death. . . Then I noticed a genuinely alarmed look on his face. He had a terrified look worse than the expression seen in death! This patient had a grotesque grimace expressing sheer horror! His pupils were dilated, and he was perspiring and trembling — he looked as if his hair was &quot;on end.&quot;
<br />Then still another strange thing happened. He said,&quot;Don't you understand? I am in hell. . . Don't let me go back to hell!&quot; . . .the man was serious, and it finally occurred to me that he was indeed in trouble. He was in a panic like I had never seen before.&quot;
<br />(Maurice Rawlings, Beyond Death's Door,(Thomas Nelson Inc., 1979) p. 3).
<br />Dr. Rawlings said, no one, who could have heard his screams and saw the look of terror on his face could doubt for a single minute that he was actually in a place called hell!
<br /><br />The Bible continually warns of a place called hell. There are over 162 references in the New Testament alone which warns of hell. And over 70 of these references were uttered by the Lord Jesus Christ! 
<br /><br />In Luke 16, Jesus Christ gives a frightening picture of hell: 
<br />22 . . . the rich man also died, and was buried; 
<br />23 And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom. 
<br />24 And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame. 
<br />25 But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented.
<br />26 And beside all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed: so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot; neither can they pass to us, that would come from thence. 
<br />27 Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest send him to my father’s house:
<br />28 For I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torment. (Luke 16:22-28)
<br />HELL IS A PLACE OF FIRE 
<br /><br />The man in Luke 16:24 cries: &quot;. . .I am tormented in this FLAME.&quot; 
<br /><br />In Matthew 13:42, Jesus says: &quot;And shall cast them into a FURNACE OF FIRE: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.&quot;
<br /><br />In Matthew 25:41, Jesus says: &quot;Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting FIRE,. . .&quot;
<br /><br />Revelation 20:15 says, &quot; And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the LAKE OF FIRE.&quot;
<br /><br />THE BIBLE GIVES THE LOCATION OF HELL 
<br /><br />When Jesus Christ died on the cross, He descended into hell. In Acts 2, Peter is speaking, verse 31, &quot; . . . seeing this before spake of the resurrection of Christ, that his soul was not left in HELL&quot; 
<br /><br />When Jesus Christ died His soul went into hell. 
<br /><br />And in Matthew 12:40, Jesus Christ says: 
<br />&quot;For as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's belly: so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the HEART OF THE EARTH. &quot;
<br />The Bible is clear — Hell is inside the earth!
<br /><br />Ephesians 4:9, says of Jesus: &quot;Now that he ascended, what is it but that he also descended first into the LOWER PARTS OF THE EARTH.&quot;
<br /><br />On page 85 of Beyond Death’s Door, Dr. Rawlings writes patients who described hell said, &quot;. . . this place seems to be UNDERGROUND or WITHIN THE EARTH in some way.&quot; 
<br /> Scientist and Bible teacher, Henry Morris also agrees the Bible plainly teaches that hell is in this earth: 
<br />&quot;So far as we can tell from Scripture, the present hell, is somewhere in the heart of the earth itself. It is also called 'the pit' (Isa. 14:9, 15: Ezek. 32:18-21) and 'the abyss' (Rev. 9:2). . .
<br />The writers certainly themselves believed hell to be real and geographically 'beneath' the earth's surface. . .
<br />To say this is not scientific is to assume science knows much more about the earth's interior than is actually the case. The great 'pit' [hell] would only need to be about 100 miles or less in diameter to contain, with much room to spare, all the forty billion or so people who have ever lived, assuming their 'spiritual' bodies are the same size as their physical bodies.&quot;
<br />(Henry M. Morris, The Bible Has the Answer, p. 220)
<br />The Birmingham News, April 10, 1987 had an article entitled &quot;Earth's Center Hotter Than Sun's Surface, Scientists Say&quot;. The article stated that scientists have recently discovered, &quot;THE EARTH'S INNER CORE HAS A TEMPERATURE OF OVER 12,000 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT!&quot; 
<br /><br />Have you seen pictures of a volcano erupting, spewing a lake of fire from inside the earth — consuming everything within miles just from the heat? When Mount St. Helens erupted in May 18, 1980, it was described by reporters, &quot;when HELL surfaced upon the earth.&quot; The book, Volcanoes, Earth's Awakening (p.91) describes an erupting volcano as &quot;descent into HELL&quot;. 
<br /><br />Thousands of years ago, the Bible described a place called hell in the heart of the earth that matches exactly what science is discovering. 
<br /><br />YES! THERE IS A PLACE CALLED HELL! 
<br /><br />In Numbers 16, the Bible gives the account of people falling into hell alive! 
<br />&quot;And THE EARTH OPENED HER MOUTH, and swallowed them up, and their houses, and all the men that appertained unto Korah, and all their goods. They, and all that appertained to them, went down alive INTO THE PIT, and the EARTH CLOSED UPON THEM:&quot; Numbers 16:32-33
<br />Caspar Peucer, a famous fourteenth century astronomer and physician, who also researched and documented the volcanoe eruptions at Heklafell wrote some very frightening information in his research findings. Peucer, claims (as others) that &quot;fearful howlings, weeping and gnashing of teeth&quot; could be heard &quot;for many miles. . .&quot; as these volcanoes erupted: 
<br />&quot;Out of the bottomless abyss of Heklafell, or rather out of Hell itself, rise melancholy cries and loud wailings, so that these can be heard for many miles around. . . there may be heard in the mountain fearful howlings, weeping and gnashing of teeth.&quot;
<br /><br />(Haraldur Sigurdsson, Melting the Earth, The History of Ideas on Volcanic Eruptions, p. 73)And Caspar Peucer is not alone. There are others who believe they have heard &quot;cries and screaming&quot; coming from volcanoes. Most have tried to ignore the obvious. Some simply explain the &quot;sounds of hell&quot; to some rational meaning. But they are there. . . 
<br />&quot;The fearsome noises that issued from some of their volcanoes were certainly thought to be the screams of tormented souls in the fires of hell below&quot;.
<br />(Haraldur Sigurdsson, Melting the Earth, The History of Ideas on Volcanic Eruptions, p. 73) 
<br />Inside this earth, this very moment, there are millions of lost, tormented souls — burning, weeping, wailing — without any hope whatsoever!
<br /><br />In Mark 9:46, Jesus Christ says about hell: &quot;Where THEIR WORM dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.&quot;
<br /><br />Jesus said explicitly — THEIR worm — not a worm, or the worm — but THEIR worm. The Bible teaches that Christians will one day have a body like the Lord Jesus Christ. Could it be, as some Bible students teach — that men and women in hell take on the form of their father, Satan (John 8:44)? In Revelation 12:3, Satan is described as a red dragon. Could Jesus Christ be referring to the body lost men and women will have for eternity?
<br /><br />The earth’s crust on land is normally 50 miles thick. You’d have to go down 50 miles before the edge of the fire. But in parts of the ocean floor, the earth’s crust is less than a mile thick.
<br /><br />Scientists recently discovered cracks on the ocean floor where fire was leaking out. Do you know what they found around these fire-breathing vents in the crust? Eight-foot long worms, found no other place in the world! The book, The Deep Sea, by Joseph Wallace (p.39), reads, &quot;Perhaps the strangest of ocean creatures recently discovered are Riftia, the giant tube WORMS. Measuring up to 8 feet in length, the worms are ONLY FOUND NEAR DEEP SEA VENTS.&quot;
<br /><br />And Jesus Christ said, &quot;Where THEIR WORM dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.&quot;
<br /><br />Have you read Isaiah 66 where the Lord Jesus Christ is quoting Mark 9:46? 
<br />Look at the context and time period of Isaiah 66:22-24: 
<br />Isaiah 66:22-24:
<br />22 For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before me, saith the LORD, so shall your seed and your name remain.
<br />23 And it shall come to pass, that from one new moon to another, and from one sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before me, saith the LORD.
<br />24 And they shall go forth, and look upon the carcases of the men that have transgressed against me: for their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched; and they shall be an abhorring unto all flesh.
<br /><br />The &quot;new heavens and new earth&quot; of Isaiah 66:22 matches Revelation 21:1. This occurs AFTER the Great White Throne Judgement of Revelation 20:10-15! The references to &quot;carcases&quot;; &quot;their worm&quot;; &quot;their fire&quot; (vs 24) — is AFTER the Great White Throne Judgement of the LOST people! The reference to &quot;. . the men that have transgressed. . .&quot; are the LOST people AFTER the Great White Throne Judgement. 
<br />And at this point — they have received their NEW BODY! Notice what Isaiah says, the saved people shall &quot;LOOK upon the CARCASES of the men that have transgressed. . .&quot; It's worth mentioning that a &quot;carcase&quot; is not always a &quot;DEAD body&quot;. For instance, two times the Bible specifically uses the term &quot;dead carcase&quot; (Deut. 14:8 and Ezek 6:5). If a carcase is ALWAYS a &quot;dead&quot; body, then why say &quot;dead&quot; carcase? And there's NOTHING in the context of Isaiah to imply these &quot;men that transgressed&quot; are &quot;dead&quot;. 
<br />In fact, Isaiah clearly says, &quot;their worm shall NOT DIE&quot;. Even in our language, we refer to a living body as a &quot;carcase&quot;. For example, &quot;Get your carcase [body] in here&quot;. Why is that important? Because when the saved people in Isaiah 66:24 are &quot;looking upon the carcases of the men that have transgressed&quot; — And do you know what they are SEEING? &quot;Their worm&quot;! The &quot;carcase&quot; they are seeing is &quot;their WORM that shall not die&quot;. The end of Isaiah 66:24 is a frightening endorsement of this interpretation. What the saved people are viewing Isaiah says is , &quot;. . . an abhorring unto all flesh&quot;. And my friend, that is not JUST a normal flesh body they are looking at! It is something that will send chills screaming through your soul at the horror. And it will happen! 
<br />And it will happen TO YOU if you die without the Lord Jesus Christ! 
<br />Even though the world tries to extinguish the cries and reality of hell — the truth of hell echoes throughout our world. We desperately pretend to cover our ears and igonore the &quot;screams, the weeping, the wailing, the gnashing of teeth&quot; but it is there. . . And we know it. We refuse to accept such a place exist. But it is there. And we know it. Nothing we can do, nothing we can say, can erase the horror of hell from our minds. 
<br />It is there. And we know it. 
<br />National Geographic magazine truthfully titled their story on Volcanoes &quot;Going To Hell&quot;. When PBS did a series on The Savage Earth, one episode was titled &quot;Hell's Crust: Our Everchanging Planet&quot;. Everything we know. Everything we observe. Echoes the truth of a place called hell. 
<br /><br />It is there. And we know it. 
<br />Revelation 14:10 says, &quot; . . . and he shall be tormented with fire and BRIMSTONE . . .&quot; And Job 18 describes the &quot; . . . PLACE of him that knoweth not God&quot; (vs 21), in verse 15 as, &quot; . . . BRIMSTONE shall be scattered upon his habitation.&quot; Do you know what brimstone is? It's sulfur. And do you know where sulfur or brimstone is found? INSIDE THIS EARTH! According to the book Volcanoes by Pierre Kohler (p. 43), when Mt. St Helens erupted in 1980 — 150,000 tons of sulfurous gas was ejected! Job is the oldest book in the Bible, written over 3,000 years ago, and yet Job knew what science wouldn't know for years — inside this earth is BRIMSTONE! 
<br />Nature magazine recently discovered (July 2002) what the Bible knew over 3,000 years ago. Inside this earth is &quot;fire and brimstone&quot;: 
<br />&quot;Volcanoes may be more like hell than anyone realized. Eruptions disgorge streams of molten sulphur, the brimstone of evangelical preachers, which burns up before it can be preserved for posterity, new research in the journal Geology shows&quot;.

<br /><br />The cover of Discover magazine, August 2002, asks the question — &quot;What's Really at the Center of the Earth?&quot;. 
<br />I know what's REALLY in &quot;the center of this earth&quot;. Jesus Christ told us. Over and over. There is a lake of fire — with millions of people burning, weeping, screaming, wailing, gnashing of teeth&quot;.

<br />The following article appeared in the well respected Finland newspaper, Ammenusastia
<br /><br />&quot;As a communist I don’t believe in heaven or the Bible but as a scientist I now believe in hell,&quot; said Dr. Azzacove. &quot;Needless to say we were shocked to make such a discovery. But we know what we saw and we know what we heard. And we are absolutely convinced that we drilled through the gates of hell!&quot;
<br /><br />Dr. Azzacove continued, &quot;. . .the drill suddenly began to rotate wildly, indicating that we had reached a large empty pocket or cavern. Temperature sensors showed a dramatic increase in heat to 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;We lowered a microphone, designed to detect the sounds of plate movements down the shaft. But instead of plate movements we heard a human voice screaming in pain! At first we thought the sound was coming from our own equipment.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;But when we made adjustments our worst suspicions were confirmed. The screams weren’t those of a single human, they were the screams of millions of humans!&quot;

<br /><br />HELL IS A PLACE OF TORMENT 
<br />Jesus says of the man in Luke 16: 
<br />23 &quot;And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in TORMENTS. . . &quot;
<br />24 &quot;. . . for I am TORMENTED in this FLAME.&quot;
<br />28 &quot;. . .PLACE OF TORMENT.&quot;
<br />It is humanly impossible to comprehend the Bible description of hell. Nothing on earth can compare with it. No nightmare could produce a terror to match that of hell. No horror movie could describe it’s fright. No crime scene with all it’s blood and gore could begin to match it’s horror. 
<br /><br />It will be beyond anything humanly imaginable! 
<br />The Bible warns in Psalm 9:17, you will not only be in hell — you will BE TURNED INTO HELL! You will literally BE HELL! 
<br />The wicked shall be turned into hell, and all the nations that forget God.
<br />Psalm 9:17
<br />YOU will see HELL. . .
<br />YOU will smell HELL. . .
<br />YOU will breathe HELL. . .
<br />YOU will hear HELL. . .
<br />YOU will feel HELL. . .
<br />YOU WILL BE HELL. . . 
<br /><br />The Bible describes it as weeping (Matt 8:12), wailing (Matt 13:42), gnashing of teeth (Matt 13:50), darkness (Matt 25:30), flames (Luke 16:24), burning (Isa 33:14), torments (Luke 16:23), everlasting punishment! Jesus Christ says in Matthew 25:41, &quot;Depart from me, ye cursed, into EVERLASTING FIRE, prepared for the devil and his angels.&quot;
<br /><br />In Matthew 13:42, Jesus says: &quot;And shall cast them into a FURNACE OF FIRE: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.&quot;
<br /><br />HELL IS FOREVER! 
<br /><br />All who enter hell — abandon all hope! 
<br /><br />The horror of hell — for even one second is unbearable — but FOREVER!
<br /><br />Jesus says in Matthew 25:41: &quot;. . . Depart from me, ye cursed, into EVERLASTING fire, . . .&quot; 
<br /><br />Rev. 14:11: &quot;The smoke of their TORMENT ascendeth up for EVER AND EVER: and they have NO REST DAY NOR NIGHT.&quot; 
<br />Just look how the Bible warns of the eternity and permance of hell! 
<br />everlasting fire — Matthew18:8, 25:41
<br />everlasting punishment — Matthew 25:46
<br />everlasting chains — Jude 1:6
<br />eternal damnation — Mark 3:29
<br />eternal judgment — Hebrews 6:2
<br />eternal fire — Jude 1:7
<br />unquenchable fire — Matthew 3:12
<br />the fire that never shall be quenched — Mark 9:43, 44, 45, 46, 48
<br />fire unquenchable — Luke 3:17
<br />mist of darkness is reserved for ever — 2 Peter 2:17
<br />the blackness of darkness for ever — Jude 1:13
<br />My friend, I have searched my Bible, from cover to cover. . . I have studied every occurrence of hell in my Bible — and I can not find one verse, not one word of HOPE for someone in hell! NOT ONE WORD! The rich man in hell in Luke 16 never even asks to get out — He knew there was no way out! 
<br />OH MY FRIEND – HELL IS FOREVER AND EVER!
<br />What could possibly be worth eternity in hell? No wonder Jesus Christ warned so much about hell! No wonder Jesus said in Mark 8:36, &quot;For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and LOSE HIS OWN SOUL?&quot;
<br /><br />Jesus Christ took hell very serious. . . 
<br /><br />Jesus Christ says in Mark 9:43-47, 
<br /><br />43 And if thy hand offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter into life maimed, than having two hands to go into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched:
<br />45 And if thy foot offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter halt into life, than having two feet to be cast into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched:
<br />47 And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out: it is better for thee to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye, than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire:
<br /><br />Jesus Christ took hell so serious — He could say without the slightest hesitation — to remove your eye, cut off your hand or foot, if that would keep you out of hell!
<br /><br />If hell is not real — Jesus Christ was the most deceived man that ever lived!
<br /><br />I’ll challenge anyone to read the words of Jesus Christ and tell me they are the words of a deceived man! 
<br /><br />Jesus Christ knew exactly what He was talking about!
<br /><br />How did Jesus describe hell? 
<br />Jesus Christ spoke more on hell than any other subject.
<br />Just look at how Jesus described hell:

<br /><br />it is appointed unto man once to die . . . 
<br />and one day — YOU will die . . . 
<br /><br />And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments . . . 
<br /><br />As you leave your body — you realize something is happening. You hear a sound. . . getting louder and louder. . . screaming . . .weeping. . . wailing. Terror and fear beyond anything you could imagine overtakes you. &quot;This can’t be happening!&quot; you scream. Your nostrils are filling with the awful stench of burning souls. Your face ignites from the heat. Flames are now blazing from your eyes, nostrils, ears, mouth — every opening in your body, flames are roaring out. Your body is sizzling and crackling from the flames. 
<br /><br />Your body is now madly thrashing and convulsing from the horrible pain. &quot;Why don’t I die?&quot;, you scream. You begin weeping and gnashing your teeth with the millions. &quot;When will this pain stop?&quot; But you know it will never stop. . .
<br /><br />The darkness is so terrifying, it begins engulfing you. You feel something moving in the darkness. . . something horrible is happening. &quot;No! No! This can’t be happening&quot; you scream — as your worm is emerging. 
<br /><br />You begin cursing the day you were born. You scream — &quot;Oh God, why didn’t you warn me?&quot;— but you remember the preacher pleading with you to receive Jesus Christ. You remember reading that gospel tract. You cry — &quot;God don’t you care?&quot; — but you remember John 3:16 &quot;For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son,. . .&quot; &quot;God is a God of love — He won't allow this&quot;, you cry — but you remember John 3:36, &quot;. . . he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.&quot;
<br /><br />And you soon realize, that Jesus Christ was right!
<br />There is a place called hell. 
<br /><br />AND YOU ARE THERE — FOREVER! 
<br /><br />But God is a God of LOVE. . . Why would a GOD OF LOVE send me to hell? Yes, God is a GOD OF LOVE — but God is also a HOLY GOD. A HOLY GOD demands payment for sin. Otherwise God would NOT and could NOT be HOLY.
<br /><br />Because God is holy — sin MUST be condemned. Joshua 24:19 says, &quot;. . he is an HOLY GOD;. . . he will NOT forgive your transgressions nor your sins.&quot;
<br /><br />BUT FRIEND I HAVE GOOD NEWS! 
<br /><br />God does NOT want you in hell 
<br /><br />Hell was not made for man. Matthew 25:41 says, hell was, &quot;. . . prepared for the devil and his angels:&quot;
<br /><br />Because God is a GOD OF LOVE, and He LOVED YOU so much, He sent His Son, Jesus Christ, to this earth to die a cruel death on a cross to pay the price a HOLY GOD demands for your sins.
<br /><br />Romans 5:8 says, &quot;But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.&quot;
<br /><br />God does not send someone to hell. You choose hell when you reject Jesus Christ. When you refuse God's love gift of eternal life in Jesus Christ. . .
<br /><br />YOU CHOOSE HELL! 
<br /><br />Millionaire Ted Turner, said in an interview, &quot;I’m looking forward to dying and being cast into Hell. That's where I belong.&quot; You say — he’s a fool! But friend, when you say &quot;No&quot;; to Jesus Christ and His payment for your sin — you are saying the same thing! You’re telling God — I don’t need Jesus Christ — I’ll pay for my sins in hell!
<br /><br />If you reject God’s gift of eternal life through Jesus Christ 
<br /><br />ONE DAY YOU WILL BE IN HELL! 
<br /><br />Dr. Rawlings has watched as thousands of people depart into eternity. Most people think they'll somehow &quot;sneak&quot; into heaven, but Dr. Rawlings claims most people descend into the flames of hell!
<br />Jesus Christ gave a solemn warning in Matthew 7:21-23
<br />&quot;Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven. . . MANY will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works?And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.&quot; 
<br />If it was for a few days, a few months, a few years or even a million years, but to be tormented — FOREVER! You will despair of ever having any deliverance! You will beg for death itself to come and take you away! You will curse the day you were born! Revelation 14:11 says, &quot;The smoke of their TORMENT ascendeth up for EVER AND EVER: and they have NO REST DAY NOR NIGHT.&quot;
<br /><br />What could possibly be worth eternity in hell? 
<br /><br />No wonder Jesus Christ said in Mark 8:36: 
<br />&quot;For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?&quot;Mark 8:36: 
<br />God has something far better than words can describe for those who love Him. I Corinthians 2:9 says: 
<br />&quot;. . . Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love Him.&quot;I Corinthians 2:9
<br />Friend, there is a place called hell! And, if you continually refuse God's gift of eternal life through Jesus Christ — just as sure as you live and breathe — ONE DAY YOU WILL WAKE UP IN HELL! 
<br /><br />Don't wait until you die to find out the truth about Hell! Tomorrow may be too late! Proverbs 27:1 says, &quot;Boast not thyself of tomorrow: for thou KNOWEST NOT what a day may bring forth.&quot;
<br /><br />Three people die every second, 180 every minute, since you started reading this — 2000 more people have gone into eternity! An automobile accident. . . A heart attack. . , A stroke. . .One thing is CERTAIN — you will DIE — today. . . tomorrow . . . a week. . . a month . . . a year. . . 5 years. . . 10 years. . . 20 years. . . 50 years — ONE THING IS CERTAIN —&quot; . . .it is appointed unto man once TO DIE . . .&quot;
<br /><br />DON'T BE CAUGHT DEAD WITHOUT JESUS! 
<br /><br />You may have made some terrible mistakes in your life. There may be some things in your life you would give anything to be able to change. But friend, I assure you — if you die without Jesus Christ — it'll be the worst mistake you could possibly make!
<br /><br />Has there ever come a time and a place in your life, when you received Jesus Christ as your personal Savior?
<br /><br />If not, you are on the way to hell! 
<br /><br />Don't let anyone convince you that when you die it will be all over! The Bible says in Hebrews 9:27: 
<br />&quot;And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this THE JUDGMENT.&quot; Hebrews 9:27
<br />Revelation 20:15 says: 
<br />&quot;And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the LAKE OF FIRE.&quot; Revelation 20:15
<br />If you've never received Jesus Christ as your Savior, bow your head this minute and ask the Lord Jesus Christ to save you.Don't put it off another second!
<br /><br />NOTHING'S WORTH TAKING THE CHANCE! 
<br /><br />It's simple to be saved ... 
<br /><br />Realize you are a sinner.
<br /><br />&quot;As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:&quot; Romans 3:10
<br /><br />&quot;... for there is no difference. For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;&quot; Romans 3:23
<br /><br />Realize you CAN NOT save yourself. 
<br />&quot;But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags; ...&quot; Isaiah 64:6
<br /><br />&quot;Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, ...&quot; Titus 3:5
<br /><br />Realize that Jesus Christ died on the cross to pay for your sins. 
<br />&quot;Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, ...&quot; 1 Peter 2:24
<br /><br />&quot;... Unto him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood,&quot; Revelation 1:5
<br /><br />Simply by faith receive Jesus Christ as your personal Savior. 
<br />&quot;But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name:&quot; John 1:12
<br /><br />&quot; ...Sirs, what must I do to be saved? And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house.&quot;&quot; Acts 16:30,31
<br /><br />&quot;For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.&quot; John 3:16
<br /><br />WOULD YOU LIKE TO BE SAVED? 
<br /><br />Pray this prayer, and mean it with all your heart.
<br /><br />Lord Jesus, I know that I am a sinner, and unless you save me I am lost forever. I thank you for dying for me at Calvary. I come to you now, Lord the best way I know how, and ask you to save me. I now receive you as my Savior. In Jesus Christ Name, Amen.
<br /><br />&quot;How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation;&quot; 
<br />Hebrews 2:3

<br /><br />This is a wonderful painting by Jon McNaughton. The painting represents McNaughton's response to liberalism's criticism of &quot;One Nation Under God.&quot;
<br /><br />You can move the mouse over any person and the right side of the screen gives a description of that person.
<br /><br />Notice Jesus Christ in the center with all his garments are explained.
<br /> Notice Jesus Christ holding the U.S. Constitution.
<br /> Satan is also in the painting.
<br /> This is incredible ! ! !

<br /><br />Wesley's Notes
<br /><br />9:3 For ever - As long as the Mosaic dispensation lasts; whereas hitherto my worship has been successively in several places. Eyes - My watchful and gracious providence. Heart - My tender affection. Shall be there - Shall be towards this place and people.
<br /><br />Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary
<br /><br />9:1-9 God warned Solomon, now he had newly built and dedicated the temple, that he and his people might not be high-minded, but fear. After all the services we can perform, we stand upon the same terms with the Lord as before. Nothing can purchase for us liberty to sin, nor would the true believer desire such a licence. He would rather be chastened of the Lord, than be allowed to go on with ease and prosperity in sin.
<br /><br />What blessings await you when people hate you and exclude you and mock ... 46 “So why do you keep calling me 'Lord, Lord!' when you don't do what I say?
<br />Luke 6 (New Living Translation)
<br />Luke 6
<br />A Discussion about the Sabbath
<br /> 1 One Sabbath day as Jesus was walking through some grainfields, his disciples broke off heads of grain, rubbed off the husks in their hands, and ate the grain. 2 But some Pharisees said, “Why are you breaking the law by harvesting grain on the Sabbath?”
<br /> 3 Jesus replied, “Haven’t you read in the Scriptures what David did when he and his companions were hungry? 4 He went into the house of God and broke the law by eating the sacred loaves of bread that only the priests can eat. He also gave some to his companions.” 5 And Jesus added, “The Son of Man[a] is Lord, even over the Sabbath.”
<br /><br />Jesus Heals on the Sabbath
<br /> 6 On another Sabbath day, a man with a deformed right hand was in the synagogue while Jesus was teaching. 7 The teachers of religious law and the Pharisees watched Jesus closely. If he healed the man’s hand, they planned to accuse him of working on the Sabbath.
<br /> 8 But Jesus knew their thoughts. He said to the man with the deformed hand, “Come and stand in front of everyone.” So the man came forward. 9 Then Jesus said to his critics, “I have a question for you. Does the law permit good deeds on the Sabbath, or is it a day for doing evil? Is this a day to save life or to destroy it?”
<br /><br />10 He looked around at them one by one and then said to the man, “Hold out your hand.” So the man held out his hand, and it was restored! 11 At this, the enemies of Jesus were wild with rage and began to discuss what to do with him.
<br /><br />Jesus Chooses the Twelve Apostles
<br /> 12 One day soon afterward Jesus went up on a mountain to pray, and he prayed to God all night. 13 At daybreak he called together all of his disciples and chose twelve of them to be apostles. Here are their names:
<br /> 14 Simon (whom he named Peter),
<br />   Andrew (Peter’s brother),
<br />   James,
<br />   John,
<br />   Philip,
<br />   Bartholomew,
<br /> 15 Matthew,
<br />   Thomas,
<br />   James (son of Alphaeus),
<br />   Simon (who was called the zealot),
<br /> 16 Judas (son of James),
<br />   Judas Iscariot (who later betrayed him).
<br /><br />Crowds Follow Jesus
<br /> 17 When they came down from the mountain, the disciples stood with Jesus on a large, level area, surrounded by many of his followers and by the crowds. There were people from all over Judea and from Jerusalem and from as far north as the seacoasts of Tyre and Sidon. 18 They had come to hear him and to be healed of their diseases; and those troubled by evil[b] spirits were healed. 19 Everyone tried to touch him, because healing power went out from him, and he healed everyone.
<br />The Beatitudes
<br /> 20 Then Jesus turned to his disciples and said,
<br />   “God blesses you who are poor,
<br />      for the Kingdom of God is yours.
<br />   21 God blesses you who are hungry now,
<br />      for you will be satisfied.
<br />   God blesses you who weep now,
<br />      for in due time you will laugh.
<br /><br />22 What blessings await you when people hate you and exclude you and mock you and curse you as evil because you follow the Son of Man. 23 When that happens, be happy! Yes, leap for joy! For a great reward awaits you in heaven. And remember, their ancestors treated the ancient prophets that same way.
<br /><br />Sorrows Foretold
<br />   24 “What sorrow awaits you who are rich,
<br />      for you have your only happiness now.
<br />   25 What sorrow awaits you who are fat and prosperous now,
<br />      for a time of awful hunger awaits you.
<br />   What sorrow awaits you who laugh now,
<br />      for your laughing will turn to mourning and sorrow.
<br />   26 What sorrow awaits you who are praised by the crowds,
<br />      for their ancestors also praised false prophets.
<br />Love for Enemies
<br /> 27 “But to you who are willing to listen, I say, love your enemies! Do good to those who hate you. 28 Bless those who curse you. Pray for those who hurt you. 29 If someone slaps you on one cheek, offer the other cheek also. If someone demands your coat, offer your shirt also. 30 Give to anyone who asks; and when things are taken away from you, don’t try to get them back. 31 Do to others as you would like them to do to you.
<br /> 32 “If you love only those who love you, why should you get credit for that? Even sinners love those who love them! 33 And if you do good only to those who do good to you, why should you get credit? Even sinners do that much! 34 And if you lend money only to those who can repay you, why should you get credit? Even sinners will lend to other sinners for a full return.
<br /><br />35 “Love your enemies! Do good to them. Lend to them without expecting to be repaid. Then your reward from heaven will be very great, and you will truly be acting as children of the Most High, for he is kind to those who are unthankful and wicked. 36 You must be compassionate, just as your Father is compassionate.
<br /><br />Do Not Judge Others
<br /> 37 “Do not judge others, and you will not be judged. Do not condemn others, or it will all come back against you. Forgive others, and you will be forgiven. 38 Give, and you will receive. Your gift will return to you in full—pressed down, shaken together to make room for more, running over, and poured into your lap. The amount you give will determine the amount you get back.<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/coolbox.gif" alt=":)" />”
<br /> 39 Then Jesus gave the following illustration: “Can one blind person lead another? Won’t they both fall into a ditch? 40 Students[d] are not greater than their teacher. But the student who is fully trained will become like the teacher.
<br /><br />41 “And why worry about a speck in your friend’s eye[e] when you have a log in your own? 42 How can you think of saying, ‘Friend,[f] let me help you get rid of that speck in your eye,’ when you can’t see past the log in your own eye? Hypocrite! First get rid of the log in your own eye; then you will see well enough to deal with the speck in your friend’s eye.
<br /><br />The Tree and Its Fruit
<br /> 43 “A good tree can’t produce bad fruit, and a bad tree can’t produce good fruit. 44 A tree is identified by its fruit. Figs are never gathered from thornbushes, and grapes are not picked from bramble bushes. 45 A good person produces good things from the treasury of a good heart, and an evil person produces evil things from the treasury of an evil heart. What you say flows from what is in your heart.
<br />Building on a Solid Foundation
<br /> 46 “So why do you keep calling me ‘Lord, Lord!’ when you don’t do what I say? 47 I will show you what it’s like when someone comes to me, listens to my teaching, and then follows it. 48 It is like a person building a house who digs deep and lays the foundation on solid rock. When the floodwaters rise and break against that house, it stands firm because it is well built. 49 But anyone who hears and doesn’t obey is like a person who builds a house without a foundation. When the floods sweep down against that house, it will collapse into a heap of ruins.”

<br />  The Temptation of Jesus 
<br /><br />4 Then Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan River. He was led by the Spirit in the wilderness,*  2 where he was tempted by the devil for forty days. Jesus ate nothing all that time and became very hungry. 
<br /><br />3 Then the devil said to him, “If you are the Son of God, tell this stone to become a loaf of bread.” 
<br /><br />4 But Jesus told him, “No! The Scriptures say, ‘People do not live by bread alone.’* ” 
<br /><br />5 Then the devil took him up and revealed to him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.  6 “I will give you the glory of these kingdoms and authority over them,” the devil said, “because they are mine to give to anyone I please.  7 I will give it all to you if you will worship me.” 
<br /><br />8 Jesus replied, “The Scriptures say, 
<br /><br />‘You must worship the Lord your God 
<br /><br />and serve only him.’* ” 
<br /><br />9 Then the devil took him to Jerusalem, to the highest point of the Temple, and said, “If you are the Son of God, jump off!  10 For the Scriptures say, 
<br /><br />‘He will order his angels to protect and guard you. 
<br /><br />11  And they will hold you up with their hands 
<br /><br />so you won’t even hurt your foot on a stone.’* ” 
<br /><br />12 Jesus responded, “The Scriptures also say, ‘You must not test the Lord your God.’* ” 
<br /><br />13 When the devil had finished tempting Jesus, he left him until the next opportunity came. 
<br /><br />Jesus Rejected at Nazareth 
<br /><br />14 Then Jesus returned to Galilee, filled with the Holy Spirit’s power. Reports about him spread quickly through the whole region.  15 He taught regularly in their synagogues and was praised by everyone. 
<br /><br />16 When he came to the village of Nazareth, his boyhood home, he went as usual to the synagogue on the Sabbath and stood up to read the Scriptures.  17 The scroll of Isaiah the prophet was handed to him. He unrolled the scroll and found the place where this was written: 
<br /><br />18  “The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, 
<br /><br />for he has anointed me to bring Good News to the poor. 
<br /><br />He has sent me to proclaim that captives will be released, 
<br /><br />that the blind will see, 
<br /><br />that the oppressed will be set free, 
<br /><br />19  and that the time of the Lord’s favor has come.*” 
<br /><br />20 He rolled up the scroll, handed it back to the attendant, and sat down. All eyes in the synagogue looked at him intently.  21 Then he began to speak to them. “The Scripture you’ve just heard has been fulfilled this very day!” 
<br /><br />22 Everyone spoke well of him and was amazed by the gracious words that came from his lips. “How can this be?” they asked. “Isn’t this Joseph’s son?” 
<br /><br />23 Then he said, “You will undoubtedly quote me this proverb: ‘Physician, heal yourself’—meaning, ‘Do miracles here in your hometown like those you did in Capernaum.’  24 But I tell you the truth, no prophet is accepted in his own hometown. 
<br /><br />25 “Certainly there were many needy widows in Israel in Elijah’s time, when the heavens were closed for three and a half years, and a severe famine devastated the land.  26 Yet Elijah was not sent to any of them. He was sent instead to a foreigner—a widow of Zarephath in the land of Sidon.  27 And there were many lepers in Israel in the time of the prophet Elisha, but the only one healed was Naaman, a Syrian.” 
<br /><br />28 When they heard this, the people in the synagogue were furious.  29 Jumping up, they mobbed him and forced him to the edge of the hill on which the town was built. They intended to push him over the cliff,  30 but he passed right through the crowd and went on his way. 
<br /><br />Jesus Casts Out a Demon 
<br /><br />31 Then Jesus went to Capernaum, a town in Galilee, and taught there in the synagogue every Sabbath day.  32 There, too, the people were amazed at his teaching, for he spoke with authority. 
<br /><br />33 Once when he was in the synagogue, a man possessed by a demon—an evil* spirit—began shouting at Jesus,  34 “Go away! Why are you interfering with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are—the Holy One sent from God!” 
<br /><br />35 Jesus cut him short. “Be quiet! Come out of the man,” he ordered. At that, the demon threw the man to the floor as the crowd watched; then it came out of him without hurting him further. 
<br /><br />36 Amazed, the people exclaimed, “What authority and power this man’s words possess! Even evil spirits obey him, and they flee at his command!”  37 The news about Jesus spread through every village in the entire region. 
<br /><br />Jesus Heals Many People 
<br /><br />38 After leaving the synagogue that day, Jesus went to Simon’s home, where he found Simon’s mother-in-law very sick with a high fever. “Please heal her,” everyone begged.  39 Standing at her bedside, he rebuked the fever, and it left her. And she got up at once and prepared a meal for them. 
<br /><br />40 As the sun went down that evening, people throughout the village brought sick family members to Jesus. No matter what their diseases were, the touch of his hand healed every one.  41 Many were possessed by demons; and the demons came out at his command, shouting, “You are the Son of God!” But because they knew he was the Messiah, he rebuked them and refused to let them speak. 
<br /><br />Jesus Continues to Preach 
<br /><br />42 Early the next morning Jesus went out to an isolated place. The crowds searched everywhere for him, and when they finally found him, they begged him not to leave them.  43 But he replied, “I must preach the Good News of the Kingdom of God in other towns, too, because that is why I was sent.”  44 So he continued to travel around, preaching in synagogues throughout Judea.* 
<br /><br />The First Disciples 
<br /><br />5 One day as Jesus was preaching on the shore of the Sea of Galilee,* great crowds pressed in on him to listen to the word of God.  2 He noticed two empty boats at the water’s edge, for the fishermen had left them and were washing their nets.  3 Stepping into one of the boats, Jesus asked Simon,* its owner, to push it out into the water. So he sat in the boat and taught the crowds from there. 
<br /><br />4 When he had finished speaking, he said to Simon, “Now go out where it is deeper, and let down your nets to catch some fish.” 
<br /><br />5 “Master,” Simon replied, “we worked hard all last night and didn’t catch a thing. But if you say so, I’ll let the nets down again.”  6 And this time their nets were so full of fish they began to tear!  7 A shout for help brought their partners in the other boat, and soon both boats were filled with fish and on the verge of sinking. 
<br /><br />8 When Simon Peter realized what had happened, he fell to his knees before Jesus and said, “Oh, Lord, please leave me—I’m too much of a sinner to be around you.”  9 For he was awestruck by the number of fish they had caught, as were the others with him.  10 His partners, James and John, the sons of Zebedee, were also amazed. 
<br /><br />Jesus replied to Simon, “Don’t be afraid! From now on you’ll be fishing for people!”  11 And as soon as they landed, they left everything and followed Jesus. 
<br /><br />Jesus Heals a Man with Leprosy 
<br /><br />12 In one of the villages, Jesus met a man with an advanced case of leprosy. When the man saw Jesus, he bowed with his face to the ground, begging to be healed. “Lord,” he said, “if you are willing, you can heal me and make me clean.” 
<br /><br />13 Jesus reached out and touched him. “I am willing,” he said. “Be healed!” And instantly the leprosy disappeared.  14 Then Jesus instructed him not to tell anyone what had happened. He said, “Go to the priest and let him examine you. Take along the offering required in the law of Moses for those who have been healed of leprosy.* This will be a public testimony that you have been cleansed.” 
<br /><br />15 But despite Jesus’ instructions, the report of his power spread even faster, and vast crowds came to hear him preach and to be healed of their diseases.  16 But Jesus often withdrew to the wilderness for prayer. 
<br /><br />Jesus Heals a Paralyzed Man 
<br /><br />17 One day while Jesus was teaching, some Pharisees and teachers of religious law were sitting nearby. (It seemed that these men showed up from every village in all Galilee and Judea, as well as from Jerusalem.) And the Lord’s healing power was strongly with Jesus. 
<br /><br />18 Some men came carrying a paralyzed man on a sleeping mat. They tried to take him inside to Jesus,  19 but they couldn’t reach him because of the crowd. So they went up to the roof and took off some tiles. Then they lowered the sick man on his mat down into the crowd, right in front of Jesus.  20 Seeing their faith, Jesus said to the man, “Young man, your sins are forgiven.” 
<br /><br />21 But the Pharisees and teachers of religious law said to themselves, “Who does he think he is? That’s blasphemy! Only God can forgive sins!” 
<br /><br />22 Jesus knew what they were thinking, so he asked them, “Why do you question this in your hearts?  23 Is it easier to say ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or ‘Stand up and walk’?  24 So I will prove to you that the Son of Man* has the authority on earth to forgive sins.” Then Jesus turned to the paralyzed man and said, “Stand up, pick up your mat, and go home!” 
<br /><br />25 And immediately, as everyone watched, the man jumped up, picked up his mat, and went home praising God.  26 Everyone was gripped with great wonder and awe, and they praised God, exclaiming, “We have seen amazing things today!” 
<br /><br />Jesus Calls Levi (Matthew) 
<br /><br />27 Later, as Jesus left the town, he saw a tax collector named Levi sitting at his tax collector’s booth. “Follow me and be my disciple,” Jesus said to him.  28 So Levi got up, left everything, and followed him. 
<br /><br />29 Later, Levi held a banquet in his home with Jesus as the guest of honor. Many of Levi’s fellow tax collectors and other guests also ate with them.  30 But the Pharisees and their teachers of religious law complained bitterly to Jesus’ disciples, “Why do you eat and drink with such scum?*” 
<br /><br />31 Jesus answered them, “Healthy people don’t need a doctor—sick people do.  32 I have come to call not those who think they are righteous, but those who know they are sinners and need to repent.” 
<br /><br />A Discussion about Fasting 
<br /><br />33 One day some people said to Jesus, “John the Baptist’s disciples fast and pray regularly, and so do the disciples of the Pharisees. Why are your disciples always eating and drinking?” 
<br /><br />34 Jesus responded, “Do wedding guests fast while celebrating with the groom? Of course not.  35 But someday the groom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast.” 
<br /><br />36 Then Jesus gave them this illustration: “No one tears a piece of cloth from a new garment and uses it to patch an old garment. For then the new garment would be ruined, and the new patch wouldn’t even match the old garment. 
<br /><br />37 “And no one puts new wine into old wineskins. For the new wine would burst the wineskins, spilling the wine and ruining the skins.  38 New wine must be stored in new wineskins.  39 But no one who drinks the old wine seems to want the new wine. ‘The old is just fine,’ they say.” 
<br /><br />A Discussion about the Sabbath 
<br /><br />6 One Sabbath day as Jesus was walking through some grainfields, his disciples broke off heads of grain, rubbed off the husks in their hands, and ate the grain.  2 But some Pharisees said, “Why are you breaking the law by harvesting grain on the Sabbath?” 
<br /><br />3 Jesus replied, “Haven’t you read in the Scriptures what David did when he and his companions were hungry?  4 He went into the house of God and broke the law by eating the sacred loaves of bread that only the priests can eat. He also gave some to his companions.”  5 And Jesus added, “The Son of Man* is Lord, even over the Sabbath.” 
<br /><br />Jesus Heals on the Sabbath 
<br /><br />6 On another Sabbath day, a man with a deformed right hand was in the synagogue while Jesus was teaching.  7 The teachers of religious law and the Pharisees watched Jesus closely. If he healed the man’s hand, they planned to accuse him of working on the Sabbath. 
<br /><br />8 But Jesus knew their thoughts. He said to the man with the deformed hand, “Come and stand in front of everyone.” So the man came forward.  9 Then Jesus said to his critics, “I have a question for you. Does the law permit good deeds on the Sabbath, or is it a day for doing evil? Is this a day to save life or to destroy it?” 
<br /><br />10 He looked around at them one by one and then said to the man, “Hold out your hand.” So the man held out his hand, and it was restored!  11 At this, the enemies of Jesus were wild with rage and began to discuss what to do with him. 
<br /><br />Jesus Chooses the Twelve Apostles 
<br /><br />12 One day soon afterward Jesus went up on a mountain to pray, and he prayed to God all night.  13 At daybreak he called together all of his disciples and chose twelve of them to be apostles. Here are their names: 
<br /><br />14  Simon (whom he named Peter), 
<br /><br />Andrew (Peter’s brother), 
<br /><br />James, 
<br /><br />John, 
<br /><br />Philip, 
<br /><br />Bartholomew, 
<br /><br />15  Matthew, 
<br /><br />Thomas, 
<br /><br />James (son of Alphaeus), 
<br /><br />Simon (who was called the zealot), 
<br /><br />16  Judas (son of James), 
<br /><br />Judas Iscariot (who later betrayed him). 
<br /><br />Crowds Follow Jesus 
<br /><br />17 When they came down from the mountain, the disciples stood with Jesus on a large, level area, surrounded by many of his followers and by the crowds. There were people from all over Judea and from Jerusalem and from as far north as the seacoasts of Tyre and Sidon.  18 They had come to hear him and to be healed of their diseases; and those troubled by evil* spirits were healed.  19 Everyone tried to touch him, because healing power went out from him, and he healed everyone. 
<br /><br />Luke 6:22
<br /> The Beatitudes 
<br /><br />20 Then Jesus turned to his disciples and said, 
<br /><br />“God blesses you who are poor, 
<br /><br />for the Kingdom of God is yours. 
<br /><br /><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/38444345_362733_11799303.jpg" />
<br /><br />21  God blesses you who are hungry now, 
<br /><br />for you will be satisfied. 
<br /><br />God blesses you who weep now, 
<br /><br />for in due time you will laugh. 
<br /><br />22 What blessings await you when people hate you and exclude you and mock you and curse you as evil because you follow the Son of Man.  23 When that happens, be happy! Yes, leap for joy! For a great reward awaits you in heaven. And remember, their ancestors treated the ancient prophets that same way. 
<br /><br />Sorrows Foretold 
<br /><br />24  “What sorrow awaits you who are rich, 
<br /><br />for you have your only happiness now. 
<br /><br />25  What sorrow awaits you who are fat and prosperous now, 
<br /><br />for a time of awful hunger awaits you. 
<br /><br />What sorrow awaits you who laugh now, 
<br /><br />for your laughing will turn to mourning and sorrow. 
<br /><br />26  What sorrow awaits you who are praised by the crowds, 
<br /><br />for their ancestors also praised false prophets.

<br />Harmful Effects Of Smoking
<br />Side Effects of Smoking Cigarettes
<br />Every year hundreds of thousands of people around the world die from diseases caused by smoking - Smoking KILLS.
<br /><br />One in two lifetime smokers will die from their habit. Half of these deaths will occur in middle age.
<br /><br />Tobacco smoke also contributes to a number of cancers.
<br /><br />The mixture of nicotine and carbon monoxide in each cigarette you smoke temporarily increases your heart rate and blood pressure, straining your heart and blood vessels. 
<br /><br />This can cause heart attacks and stroke. It slows your blood flow, cutting off oxygen to your feet and hands. Some smokers end up having their limbs 
<br />amputated.
<br /><br />Tar coats your lungs like soot in a chimney and causes cancer. A 20-a-day smoker breathes in up to a full cup (210 g) of tar in a year.
<br /><br />Changing to low-tar cigarettes does not help because smokers usually take deeper puffs and hold the smoke in for longer, dragging the tar deeper into their lungs.
<br /><br />Carbon monoxide robs your muscles, brain and body tissue of oxygen, making your whole body and especially your heart work harder. Over time, your airways swell up and let less air into your lungs.
<br /><br />Smoking causes disease and is a slow way to die. The strain of smoking effects on the body often causes years of suffering. Emphysema is an illness that slowly rots your lungs. People with emphysema often get bronchitis again and again, and suffer lung and heart failure.
<br /><br />Lung cancer from smoking is caused by the tar in tobacco smoke. Men who smoke are ten times more likely to die from lung cancer than non-smokers.
<br /><br />Heart disease and strokes are also more common among smokers than non-smokers. 
<br /><br />Smoking causes fat deposits to narrow and block blood vessels which leads to heart attack. 
<br /><br />Smoking causes around one in five deaths from heart disease. 
<br /><br />In younger people, three out of four deaths from heart disease are due to smoking.
<br /><br />Cigarette smoking during pregnancy increases the risk of low birth weight, prematurity, spontaneous abortion, and perinatal mortality in humans, which has been referred to as the fetal tobacco syndrome.

<br /><br />I have something to shear with you it is a careing story about tow poor men at mc donolds
<br />You have to read this and know if you ever see a poor person in a store like wal-mart or a fast food
<br />Place then you know what I think you would do if you would saw them standing in line only asking for something to drink if your heart was right you would buy them something to eat as will here is the story
<br /><br />A Return is Requested....You'll see why.
<br /><br />Breakfast at McDonald's
<br /><br />This is a good story and is true, please read it all the way through until the end! (After the story, there are some very interesting facts!): 
<br /><br />I am a mother of three (ages 14, 12, 3) and have recently completed my college degree.. 
<br /><br />The last class I had to take was Sociology. 
<br /><br />The teacher was absolutely inspiring with the qualities that I wish every human being had been graced with. 
<br /><br />Her last project of the term was called, 'Smile.' 
<br /><br />The class was asked to go out and smile at three people and document their reactions. 
<br /><br />I am a very friendly person and always smile at everyone and say hello anyway.. So, I thought this would be a piece of cake, 
<br /><br />literally. 
<br /><br />Soon after we were assigned the project, my husband, youngest son, and I went out to McDonald's one crisp March morning. 
<br /><br />It was just our way of sharing special playtime with our son. 
<br /><br />We were standing in line, waiting to be served, when all of a sudden everyone around us began to back away, and then 
<br />even my husband did. 
<br /><br />I did not move an inch.... an overwhelming feeling of panic welled up inside of me as I turned to see why they had moved. 
<br /><br />As I turned around I smelled a horrible 'dirty body' smell, and there standing behind me were two poor homeless men. 
<br /><br />As I looked down at the short gentleman, close to me, he was 'smiling' 
<br /><br />His beautiful sky blue eyes were full of God's Light as he searched for acceptance.. 
<br /><br />He said, 'Good day' as he counted the few coins he had been clutching... 
<br /><br />The second man fumbled with his hands as he stood behind his friend. I realized the second man was mentally challenged and the blue-eyed gentleman was his salvation.. 
<br /><br />I held my tears as I stood there with them. 
<br /><br />The young lady at the counter asked him what they wanted. 
<br /><br />He said, 'Coffee is all Miss' because that was all they could afford. (If they wanted to sit in the restaurant and warm up, they had to buy something. He just wanted to be warm). 
<br /><br />Then I really felt it - the compulsion was so great I almost reached out and embraced the little man with the blue eyes. 
<br /><br />That is when I noticed all eyes in the 
<br /><br />restaurant were set on me, judging 
<br /><br />my every action. 
<br /><br />I smiled and asked the young lady behind the counter to give me two more breakfast meals on a separate tray. 
<br /><br />I then walked around the corner to the table that the men had chosen as a resting spot. I put the tray on the table and laid my hand on the blue-eyed gentleman's cold hand. 
<br /><br />He looked up at me, with tears in his eyes, and said, 'Thank you.' 
<br /><br />I leaned over, began to pat his hand and said, 'I did not do this for you. God is here working through me to give you hope.' 
<br /><br />I started to cry as I walked away to join my husband and son... When I sat down my husband smiled at me and said, 'That is why God gave you to me, Honey, to give me hope..' 
<br /><br />We held hands for a moment and at that time, we knew that only because of the Grace that we had been given were we able to give. 
<br /><br />We are not church goers, but we are believers. 
<br /><br />That day showed me the pure Light of God's sweet love. 
<br /><br />I returned to college, on the last evening of class, with this story in hand. 
<br /><br />I turned in 'my project' and the instructor read it. 
<br /><br />Then she looked up at me and said, 'Can I share this?' 
<br /><br />I slowly nodded as she got the attention of the class. 
<br /><br />She began to read and that is when I knew that we as human beings and being part of God share this need to heal people and to be healed. 
<br /><br />In my own way I had touched the people at McDonald's, my son,the instructor, and every soul that shared the classroom on the last night I spent as a college student. 
<br /><br />I graduated with one of the biggest lessons I would ever learn: 
<br /><br />UNCONDITIONAL ACCEPTANCE. 
<br /><br />Much love and compassion is sent to each and every person who may read this and learn how to 
<br /><br />LOVE PEOPLE AND USE THINGS - 
<br /><br />NOT LOVE THINGS AND USE PEOPLE.

<br /><br />WORRY
<br /><br />I. Representative Biblical references to &quot;worry&quot;
<br /><br />A. Old Testament

<br />         Isa. 35:4 - &quot;Say to those with anxious heart, 'Take courage, fear not.'&quot;
<br />    B. New Testament

<br />         Matt. 10:19,20 - &quot;do not be anxious about how or what you will speak...it is not you who              speaks, but the Spirit of your Father who speaks in you&quot;
<br />         Mk. 4:18,19 - &quot;the seed among thorns...are the ones who have heard the word, and the worries              of the world, and the deceitfulness of riches...enter in and choke the word, and it becomes              unfruitful&quot;
<br />         Mk. 13:11 - &quot;do not be anxious about what you will say...it is the Holy Spirit who speaks&quot;
<br />         Lk. 8:14 - &quot;seed among thorns...choked with worries and riches and pleasures of this life&quot;

<br />         I Cor. 7:32-34 - &quot;I want you to be free from concern. ...One who is married is concerned              about the things of the world, how he may please his wife...his interests are divided&quot;
<br />         II Cor. 11:28 - &quot;the daily pressure upon me of concern for all the churches&quot;

<br /><br />II. Attempting a definition of &quot;worry&quot;
<br /><br />A. English word &quot;worry&quot; from Old English wyrgan and Old High German wurgen, both
<br />          meaning &quot;to strangle, to choke&quot;
<br />    B. Greek word merimnao used in most NT references above
<br />         1. Etymologically derived from merizo = &quot;to divide;&quot; and nous = &quot;mind.&quot;
<br />              Thus means &quot;divided mind&quot; - cf. I Cor. 7:34
<br />         2. Linguistically at time NT written, did not necessarily have negative connotation (&quot;to be               anxious, worried&quot<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/wink.gif" alt=":)" />, but often had a neutral orientation (&quot;to be concerned, to care&quot<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/wink.gif" alt=":)" />.
<br />    C. Difficult to distinguish sometimes between modern usage of English words &quot;concern, worry,              anxiety&quot;
<br />         1. &quot;concern&quot; means to &quot;have an interest in, give attention to, be engaged by a situation, as a               matter of consideration or responsibility&quot;
<br />         2. &quot;worry&quot; is a disquieted uneasiness of mind, an anxious apprehension concerning an               impending or anticipated situation; fretting about a foreboding misfortune or failure.               (&quot;Worried&quot; and &quot;anxious&quot; are used as synonyms.)
<br />         3. &quot;anxiety&quot; has become a psychological designation of abnormal, overwhelming               apprehension; anguished uncertainty and self-doubt about one's ability to cope with the               situation, to the point of becoming distressed, distraught, panicky or tormented.
<br />    D. A working definition from a Christian perspective:
<br />         1. &quot;Concern&quot; becomes &quot;worry&quot; when we fail to relate the situation that confronts us to the               source of sufficiency in God.
<br />         2. To worry is to assume a responsibility that is not necessarily ours to assume; failing to               recognize that God is bigger than any problem we might have, and loves us enough to seek               our highest good in the midst of every situation.
<br />         3. Worry is a form of humanistic self-orientation that thinks, &quot;It's up to me to take care of this               situation,&quot; and is thus a form of practical atheism, acting as if there is no God to deal with               the situation, or that God doesn't know or care about the situation.
<br /><br />III. &quot;Worry&quot; and the age we live in
<br /><br />A. Ours has been called &quot;The Age of Anxiety&quot;
<br />         1. People's faces: taut, constricted, intense
<br />         2. Attitudes: disquieted, apprehensive, vexed
<br />         3. Relationships: distrust, alienation
<br />         4. Physical signs: ulcers, nervous breakdowns, heart diseases
<br />    B. What are people worried about?
<br />         1. daily provision - cf. Matt. 6:35+
<br />         2. employment
<br />         3. future - cf. Matt. 6:34
<br />         4. life and death
<br />         5. health
<br />         6. personal relationships
<br />         7. personal relationships - children, family, friends
<br />         8. pleasing people - cf. Lk. 10:41
<br />         9. finances, interest rates, stock-markets
<br />        10. witnessing - cf. Lk. 12:11
<br />    C. The advice of the world concerning &quot;worry&quot;
<br />         1. Don't worry; it's a waste of time; think positive!
<br />         2. Don't worry; don't believe the situation is real; it's an illusion
<br />         3. Don't worry; it may never happen
<br />         4. Don't worry; get control of yourself; you're in charge
<br />         5. Don't worry; buy enough insurance for every eventuality
<br />         6. Don't worry; be happy; laugh your troubles away
<br />         7. Don't worry; bite the bullet; you'll feel no pain
<br />         8. Don't worry; it might get better, but it'll probably get worse
<br />         9. Don't worry; get busy doing active things; it'll take your mind off
<br />        10. Don't worry; have another drink, hit, pill
<br />        11. Don't worry; go see your therapist
<br />        12. Don't worry; it's all going to be over soon
<br />        13. Don't worry; these circumstances are just the &quot;cross&quot; you have to bear
<br />        14. Don't worry; it's a sin; Stop it!
<br /><br />IV. Developing a Christian attitude toward &quot;worry&quot;
<br /><br />A. As defined above, &quot;worry&quot; is contrary to the attitudes and activity that God would have          Christians to be involved with.
<br />         1. Fails to take God into account in the situation
<br />         2. Self-oriented assumption of responsibility
<br />         3. &quot;Whatever is not from faith is sin&quot; - Rom. 14:23
<br />    B. Rather than having a &quot;divided mind&quot; concerning the situation, we are to look to God in the 
<br />          midst of the situation.
<br />         Ps. 37:1-7 - &quot;Fret not...trust in the Lord...&quot;
<br />         Ps. 42:11 - &quot;Why are you in despair...hope in God&quot;
<br />         Ps. 55:22 - &quot;Cast your burden upon the Lord, and He will sustain you&quot;
<br />         Matt. 6:32,33 - &quot;your heavenly Father knows that you need these things; seek first His               kingdom and His righteousness; and all these things shall be added to you.&quot;
<br />         I Peter 5:7 - &quot;cast all your anxiety on Him, because He cares for you&quot;
<br />    C. Looking to God in prayer should be our response
<br />         Lk. 21:36 - &quot;keep on the alert at all times, praying in order that you may have strength&quot;
<br />         Phil. 4:6 - &quot;Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication with               thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God.&quot;
<br />    D. Such prayer is done in faith - &quot;our receptivity of His activity&quot;
<br />         Ps. 62;8 - &quot;Trust in Him at all times, O people; pour out your heart before Him&quot;
<br />         James 5:15 - &quot;prayer offered in faith&quot;
<br />    E. The result will be &quot;peace&quot; in place of bothersome, disquieting &quot;worry&quot;
<br />         Numb. 6:26 - &quot;The Lord lift up His countenance, and give you peace&quot;
<br />         Ps. 94:19 - &quot;When my anxious thoughts multiply within me, Thy consolations delight my               soul&quot;
<br />         Jn. 14:27 - &quot;Peace I leave with you; My peace I give to you... Let not your heart be troubled,               nor let it be fearful&quot;
<br />         Phil. 4:7 - &quot;the peace of God, which surpasses all comprehension, shall guard your hearts and               your minds in Christ Jesus&quot;
<br />         Col. 3:15 - &quot;let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts&quot;
<br />    F. Christian's perspectives and responses to situations are different
<br />         1. Not seeking to escape, withdraw or remove all problems
<br />         2. Not indifferent, apathetic, unconcerned in situations
<br />         3. &quot;God causes all things to work together for good to those who love God, to those who are               called according to His purpose&quot; - Rom. 8:28

<br /><br />HATE 
<br /><br />Bible Promises in Song Listen 
<br /> Surely thou wilt slay the wicked, O God: depart from me therefore, ye bloody men. For they speak against thee wickedly, and thine enemies take thy name in vain. Do not I hate them, O LORD, that hate thee? and am not I grieved with those that rise up against thee? I hate them with perfect hatred: I count them mine enemies.
<br />(Psalm 139:19-22) 
<br /><br />He that hateth dissembleth with his lips, and layeth up deceit within him; When he speaketh fair, believe him not: for there are seven abominations in his heart. Whose hatred is covered by deceit, his wickedness shall be shewed before the whole congregation.
<br />(Proverbs 26:24-26) 
<br /><br />Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy. But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you; That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust. For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? do not even the publicans the same? And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more than others? do not even the publicans so?
<br />(Matthew 5:43-47)

<br /> Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer: and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him.

<br /><br />Inspirational Quotes from Famous Persons  
<br /> Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that. Hate multiplies hate, violence multiplies violence, and toughness multiplies toughness in a descending spiral of destruction....The chain reaction of evil -- hate begetting hate, wars producing more wars -- must be broken, or we shall be plunged into the dark abyss of annihilation. 
<br />--Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. (1929-1968)  
<br /> Hatred paralyzes life; love releases it. Hatred confuses life; love harmonizes it. Hatred darkens life; love illumines it 
<br />--Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. (1929-1968)  
<br /> Like an unchecked cancer, hate corrodes the personality and eats away its vital unity. Hate destroys a man's sense of values and his objectivity. It causes him to describe the beautiful as ugly and the ugly as beautiful, and to confuse the true with the false and the false with the true. Power at its best is love implementing the demands of justice. Justice at its best is love correcting everything that stands against love. 
<br />--Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. (1929-1968)  
<br /> The worst sin towards our fellow creatures is not to hate them, but to be indifferent to them; that's the essence of inhumanity. 
<br />--G.B. Shaw 
<br /> Hate is a cancer that spreads one cell at a time.

<br /><br />Divorce and Remarriage. Does God Permit It?
<br />by Pastor Jim Feeney, Ph.D. 01/16/2010 6:44 AM
<br /><br />Summary: Does God permit divorce? If so, does He then allow remarriage after divorce? How about in cases of marital infidelity? Or the case of a believing Christian divorced by an unbelieving spouse? Christian leaders and church pastors hold a variety of views concerning Christian divorce and remarriage. My intent in this bible study is to offer some Scriptural answers. In brief, what does the bible say about marriage, divorce, and remarriage?
<br /><br />Divorce and remarriage have been much-debated issues for literally thousands of years. This bible study cannot resolve every issue or cover every situation. My hope is to discover those clear and definite guidelines on this subject that are laid down in the Scriptures.
<br /><br />Any discussion on divorce and remarriage should begin with God’s initial pronouncements on marriage itself:
<br /><br />Genesis 2:18 The LORD God said, “It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make a helper suitable for him.”
<br /><br />Genesis 2:24, KJV Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.
<br /><br />Genesis 1:28a God blessed them and said to them, “Be fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue it.”
<br /><br />This biblical account records God’s intentions for marriage as He established it “in the beginning” (Genesis 1:1). Additional Scriptures reveal a fuller picture of God’s outlook on marriage, as well as on divorce and remarriage.
<br /><br />As a starting point, the following Scriptures give us a distinct revelation of God’s general, overall view of marriage, divorce, and remarriage:
<br /><br />Genesis 2:24, KJV Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.
<br /><br />Mark 10:6-9 But at the beginning of creation God ‘made them male and female.’ ‘For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh.’ So they are no longer two, but one. Therefore what God has joined together, let man not separate. (See also Matthew 19:4-6)
<br /><br />In these verses we see Jesus Christ quoting from Genesis. He emphasized that from the beginning God intended the husband and wife “not [to] separate” from one another. In other words, Jesus affirmed God’s prevailing desire for the indissolubility of marriage.
<br /><br />Jesus (and also the inspired apostle Paul) taught that marriage was intended to be permanent. Consider the following biblical declarations on the subject:
<br /><br />Mark 10:11-12 [Jesus] answered, “Anyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery against her. And if she divorces her husband and marries another man, she commits adultery.”
<br /><br />Luke 16:18 Jesus is quoted again, saying, “Anyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery, and the man who marries a divorced woman commits adultery.”
<br /><br />Romans 7:2-3 The apostle Paul taught that “...by law a married woman is bound to her husband as long as he is alive, but if her husband dies, she is released from the law of marriage. So then, if she marries another man while her husband is still alive, she is called an adulteress. But if her husband dies, she is released from that law and is not an adulteress, even though she marries another man.”
<br /><br />1 Corinthians 7:10-13, 27, 39 The apostle Paul’s teaching continues: “To the married I give this command (not I, but the Lord): A wife must not separate from her husband. But if she does, she must remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her husband. And a husband must not divorce his wife. To the rest I say this (I, not the Lord): If any brother has a wife who is not a believer and she is willing to live with him, he must not divorce her. And if a woman has a husband who is not a believer and he is willing to live with her, she must not divorce him ... [27] Are you married? Do not seek a divorce. Are you unmarried? Do not look for a wife ... [39] A woman is bound to her husband as long as he lives. But if her husband dies, she is free to marry anyone she wishes, but he must belong to the Lord.”
<br /><br />These portions of Scripture would seem to support those who categorically oppose divorce and remarriage. And, indeed, God’s best plan for every married couple is that they remain married, and happily so.
<br /><br />But in a number of very specific instances in both the New Testament and the Old, the Bible does give scriptural grounds for certain cases of divorce and remarriage. Honestly handling the Scriptures requires that we regard not just the general statements on the sanctity of marriage, but also the God-inspired exceptions to the general rule.
<br /><br />The Bible itself requires that two or three witnesses be provided in order to establish certain things as truth. This is seen in the Old Testament Law (Deuteronomy 17:6), as well as in the writings of the apostle Paul (2 Corinthians 13:1). So we are looking for at least two, if not more, places in the Bible where God gives exceptions to His prevailing rule against divorce and remarriage.
<br /><br />I will quote seven such passages in the discussion that follows, showing these two unique cases in which God permits divorce and remarriage for Christian believers:
<br /><br />1. If a Christian husband or wife discovers that his/her mate has been sexually unfaithful, the spouse who is innocent of the marital infidelity is permitted to divorce the offending spouse and to remarry.
<br /><br />2. If a Christian’s unbelieving spouse leaves the Christian (not vice versa!), then the Christian who has been divorced in this way is free to remarry. The former marriage has been dissolved.
<br /><br />Let’s look at specific Scriptural grounds for these statements, bearing in mind that, as mentioned before, numerous statements in the Bible confirm the prevailing sanctity of the marriage bond. God in His Word has given some very specific, concrete exceptions to the indissolubility of marriage, and Christians are allowed to exercise these exceptions. But nothing beyond these specific exceptions is permitted by God.
<br /><br />Let’s first examine the Old Testament divorce-and-remarriage Scriptures:
<br /><br />Deuteronomy 21:10-14 When you go to war against your enemies and the LORD your God delivers them into your hands and you take captives, if you notice among the captives a beautiful woman and are attracted to her, you may take her as your wife.... [13] After she has lived in your house and mourned her father and mother for a full month, then you may go to her and be her husband and she shall be your wife. If you are not pleased with her, let her go wherever she wishes. You must not sell her or treat her as a slave, since you have dishonored her.
<br /><br />This portion of the Mosaic Law permits an Israelite to divorce a wife he had taken from a captive nation simply because he was “not pleased with her” (vs. 14). This might seem like a rather loose permission. But note well that, for that biblical era, this was God’s Word! God cannot be shown in the Bible to be 100 percent against divorce in all circumstances. However, be assured: I am not remotely implying that God is permissive concerning divorce! To the contrary, Malachi 2:16 declares: “ ‘I hate divorce,’ says the LORD God of Israel.”
<br /><br />Let’s look at another of Moses’ writings in the Law:
<br /><br />Deuteronomy 24:1-4, KJV When a man hath taken a wife, and married her, and it come to pass that she find no favour in his eyes, because he hath found some uncleanness in her: then let him write her a bill of divorcement, and give it in her hand, and send her out of his house. And when she is departed out of his house, she may go and be another man’s wife. And if the latter husband hate her, and write her a bill of divorcement, and giveth it in her hand, and sendeth her out of his house; or if the latter husband die, which took her to be his wife; Her former husband, which sent her away, may not take her again to be his wife, after that she is defiled; for that is abomination before the LORD: and thou shalt not cause the land to sin, which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance.
<br /><br />Under the Law of Moses, if a man’s wife found “no favour in his eyes ... some uncleanness in her”, God permitted divorce, which in the Hebrew means “a cutting off.” It was not simple separation, but a complete severing and annulling of the marriage bond.
<br /><br />If a divorce and remarriage did occur under these Scriptural conditions of (1) some uncleanness being found in the wife and (2) a “bill of divorcement” having been given her by her husband, notice that the word of God labels this man as “her former husband.” Thus God seems to recognize his right to remarry, if the divorce leading up to the remarriage was for biblical reasons. Below is another Scripture portion showing divorce consistent with the Law.
<br /><br />Ezra 10:2-3 Then Shecaniah son of Jehiel, one of the descendants of Elam, said to Ezra, “We have been unfaithful to our God by marrying foreign women from the peoples around us. But in spite of this, there is still hope for Israel. Now let us make a covenant before our God to send away all these women and their children, in accordance with the counsel of my lord and of those who fear the commands of our God. Let it be done according to the Law.”
<br /><br />Israel’s men had taken Gentile wives and were under conviction to divorce them. The Scripture says that they were careful to “put away” (KJV) those wives “according to the law” of God.
<br /><br />Now let us look at some New Testament passages on this subject. The fact has now been established by Deuteronomy 24:1-4, and is yet to be proven further, that Scriptural divorce dissolves the marriage and permits remarriage after divorce. We will look at the New Testament divorce and remarriage Scriptures in their order of appearance.
<br /><br />Matthew 5:31-32 “It has been said, ‘Anyone who divorces his wife must give her a certificate of divorce.’ But I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except for marital unfaithfulness, causes her to become an adulteress, and anyone who marries the divorced woman commits adultery.”
<br /><br />The Greek word apoluo, translated as “divorce(s)(d)” three times in this passage, means to let loose from, let go free, according to W.E. Vine’s “An Expository Dictionary of New Testament Words.” This is in line with Deuteronomy 24:1-4 and it implies a dissolving of the bond of marriage. It is important to see that the main emphasis here is against divorce. But an exception is given.
<br /><br />The passage from Matthew above conveys this message: If you divorce your wife and she remarries, you have placed both her and her new mate into a position of adultery, for before God she is still your wife, unless you divorced her “for marital unfaithfulness.” The phrase “marital unfaithfulness” here is a translation of the Greek word “porneia,” which the Amplified New Testament translates as “sexual immorality, unfaithfulness.”
<br /><br />Jesus’ teaching on divorce for marital infidelity (and remarriage after divorce in such cases) is given at greater length in the following verses:
<br /><br />Matthew 19:3-9 Some Pharisees came to him to test him. They asked, “Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any and every reason?” “Haven’t you read,” he replied, “that at the beginning the Creator ‘made them male and female,’ and said, ‘For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh’? So they are no longer two, but one. Therefore what God has joined together, let man not separate.” “Why then,” they asked, “did Moses command that a man give his wife a certificate of divorce and send her away?” Jesus replied, “Moses permitted you to divorce your wives because your hearts were hard. But it was not this way from the beginning. I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except for marital unfaithfulness, and marries another woman commits adultery.”
<br /><br />Remember that Moses’ Law indicated that a biblical divorce (“putting away” in KJV) dissolved the marriage. Jesus quoted Moses and used the same Greek word for biblically divorcing, or putting away, the spouse. However, it is important to note carefully that Jesus strictly limited Moses’ permission to divorce to cases of marital infidelity. It was not a widespread permission by Jesus, but a very narrow one, focused on the essential need for faithfulness between the spouses in a marriage.
<br /><br />It is obvious from verse 3 of the passage above that at least some of the Pharisees interpreted Moses as permitting divorce (and remarriage), as they said, “for any and every reason” — a very libertine interpretation that Jesus immediately rejected. Jesus’ answer was quite specific: to divorce your wife — “for any and every reason” — is adultery. Period. And for another man to marry a women so divorced commits adultery with her.
<br /><br />Jesus did not recognize the validity of divorce and remarriage “for every cause” (KJV). He canceled the fairly broad permission to divorce that was given to Israel by Moses “because [their] hearts were hard” (vs. 8).
<br /><br />But Jesus did leave one exception — “except for marital unfaithfulness,” which again is the Greek word porneia. One whose spouse is unfaithful may divorce and remarry, for the unfaithfulness has destroyed the one-flesh marriage bond in the eyes of God.
<br /><br />This exception in Jesus’ final statement in this passage shows that divorce (and remarriage after divorce) by the innocent spouse are allowed under the circumstances of marital infidelity. Simply putting away one’s wife in no way can be construed as committing adultery. It is the putting away and remarrying that becomes adultery — unless the cause of the putting away was adultery already committed by the spouse being put away. In this latter case — that is, divorcing one’s spouse for that person’s adultery — the one-flesh relationship has been tragically violated, and the marriage bond is dissolved in this specific instance of biblical divorce. The innocent one is permitted (although certainly not obligated) to enter into another marriage.
<br /><br />In using the word porneia in the two passages quoted here from the book of Matthew, Jesus was speaking clearly in context about married people. The word in both passages can be understood correctly as “sexual unfaithfulness of married people,” rather than the modern connotation of single persons’ sexual immorality that might be misunderstood from the King James’s use of the word “fornication” here. The root word is still porneia, which speaks of a broad range of sexual immorality — single, married, or even incestuous.
<br /><br />The word porneia is used in two other New Testament phrases referring specifically to the unfaithfulness of married persons: (1) in 1 Corinthians 5:1 porneia is said to have been committed with another man’s “wife”; and (2) 1 Corinthians 10:8 refers to 23,000 Israelites committing “fornication” (KJV). It would be absurd to assume that all of them were unmarried.
<br /><br />Now, before leaving the discussion of Christian divorce and remarriage because of porneia, a word of caution is in order. The one who has secured (or is in the process of securing) a divorce for his or her spouse’s infidelity should exercise much restraint and deliberation before entering into another marriage. Here are three important reasons for this carefulness:
<br /><br />1. This person, although innocent of the actual adultery committed by his/her spouse, may have, through other nonbiblical conduct or characteristics, contributed at least indirectly to the breakdown of the marriage. Such a divorced person should seek counsel from a qualified pastor or church elder to effect biblical change in his or her own life before even considering undertaking another marriage.
<br /><br />2. There is a prevailing biblical exhortation to “forgive one another,” as in Ephesians 4:32 and Colossians 3:13. It is entirely biblical for the offended party to seek God diligently for the grace to forgive the adulterous spouse.
<br /><br />3. Ideally, the optimum solution is reconciliation and restoration of the marriage. In a remarkable passage in Jeremiah 3:8-20, God said that “Israel [had] committed adultery [and God] had put her away, and given her a bill of divorce.” Yet God cried out to Israel to repent and turn back to Him, and declared that He would receive her back. Through prayer and competent counsel, it is possible for at least some marriages shattered by adultery to be brought to a place of repentance, forgiveness, and restoration.
<br /><br />Even by following all three of the above recommendations, the offended spouse may not necessarily see reconciliation occur. For example, the adulterous spouse may have already married someone else. But the innocent spouse, by taking the action above, keeps himself and his life in a biblical framework and may then conscientiously go about to reconstruct his life. And that rebuilding includes the possibility of entering into another marriage with God’s approval. Now let us move on to the second New Testament case for divorce and remarriage.
<br /><br />1 Corinthians 7:10-14 To the married I give this command (not I, but the Lord): A wife must not separate from her husband. But if she does, she must remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her husband. And a husband must not divorce his wife. To the rest I say this (I, not the Lord): If any brother has a wife who is not a believer and she is willing to live with him, he must not divorce her. And if a woman has a husband who is not a believer and he is willing to live with her, she must not divorce him. For the unbelieving husband has been sanctified through his wife, and the unbelieving wife has been sanctified through her believing husband. Otherwise your children would be unclean, but as it is, they are holy.
<br /><br />Here God states that a Christian should not depart from and divorce his or her mate. God does not allow a Christian to depart from a spouse for any reason other than sexual unfaithfulness, as we established earlier. And the word to those Christians who have already divorced without biblical cause (porneia) is to “remain unmarried or else be reconciled.” However, the inspired writer Paul declared:
<br /><br />1 Corinthians 7:15 But if the unbeliever leaves, let him do so. A believing man or woman is not bound in such circumstances; God has called us to live in peace.
<br /><br />This is called by some “the Pauline privilege.” Jesus earlier gave one exception to the prevailing indissolubility of marriage. That exception was for infidelity. Here the apostle Paul gives a second exception — if a saved man or woman has an unsaved spouse who leaves the Christian. The Greek word here for “leaves” is chorizo, the same word Jesus used for “put asunder” when speaking of divorce in Matthew 19:6.
<br /><br />What Paul is declaring is this: A Christian brother or sister is “not under bondage” (KJV) when the unbeliever divorces the believer.
<br /><br />The Greek word for “not under bondage” in this passage, according to both “Strong’s Exhaustive Concordance” and “The New Englishman’s Greek Concordance,” is from a word that is translated as “bound” in Romans 7:2 (“The woman which hath an husband is bound by the law”) and in 1 Corinthians 7:27 (“bound unto a wife”). It is critically important to see that the seemingly permanent-for-life marriage bond of these latter scriptures is broken — “not under bondage” — when the unbelieving spouse divorces the believer.
<br /><br />The same principles that we have seen in Moses’ Law and in Jesus’ teaching in Matthew 19:3-9 apply — that is, a divorce obtained under biblical conditions dissolves the marriage, and subsequent remarriage is permissible.
<br /><br />Let me repeat the two Scriptural grounds for divorce and remarriage:
<br /><br />1. Marital infidelity (sexual unfaithfulness) by the spouse. The innocent party may divorce and remarry.
<br /><br />2. A Christian’s unbelieving mate departs from the Christian. The divorced Christian is free to remarry.
<br /><br />In addition, it is my strong personal conviction that any and every divorce from one’s unsaved past is forgiven at the time of salvation. 
<br /><br />The Bible says, “If any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new” (2 Corinthians 5:17, KJV). At the time of salvation, all things become new, and such divorced and subsequently saved people are permitted by God to remarry with his blessing. But the new spouse should be a believer (“he must belong to the Lord” — 1 Corinthians 7:39, in a related context). I would perform such a marriage personally if neither partner had been unscripturally divorced since his/her salvation.
<br /><br />But every minister must determine where his own heart is on this last situation, and he must stand before God for his decision with an uncondemned heart. “Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind” (Romans 14:5, KJV), Paul wrote in a different matter.
<br /><br />It is vital, in treating this topic, not to take license with God’s exceptions and expand them into promiscuous, unscriptural divorces and remarriages. But when God mercifully has made provisions in this area, then we, as God’s children, must stand by God’s word in the face of ecclesiastical traditions which, without mercy, bind people to situations for which God has provided release.
<br /><br />Believe God’s word. Heed Jesus’ warning not to “teach for doctrines the commandments of man ... making the word of God of none effect through your tradition” (Mark 7:7,13). As we have seen, God in His bible lists certain scriptural divorce and remarriage situations. Let’s obey the word of God in this critical area of people’s lives and have the same compassion on God’s people that He Himself has demonstrated.
<br /><br />The Bible and Abortion: What Does God Say? 01/16/2010 7:03 AM
<br /><br />Christian Bible Study on God, Abortion and the Bible
<br />Compiled by Doug Britton, MFT
<br /><br />Did not he who made me in the womb make them? Did not the same one form us both within our mothers? (Job 31:15).
<br /><br />God, the Bible and abortion: Introduction
<br />In some situations, an unplanned pregnancy can be one of the hardest things facing a woman or man. If you are in such a situation and wonder if you should have an abortion, I pray that the following verses from the Bible—God's Word—will help you make your decision, regardless of your religion. If you have had an abortion in the past, may these Scriptures help you come to a godly resolution.
<br /><br />God creates life.
<br />What does Christianity say about abortion? The Bible does not use the word &quot;abortion.&quot; But the Bible lets us know that every life is precious to God. He is the one who gave us life.
<br /><br />Jesus Christ, God's son, is pro-life. Read these Scriptures: 
<br />The LORD God formed the man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living being (Genesis 2:7).
<br /><br />You gave me life and showed me kindness, and in your providence watched over my spirit (Job 10:12).
<br /><br />Know that the LORD is God. It is he who made us, and we are his; we are his people, the sheep of his pasture (Psalm 100:3).
<br /><br />Life is a gift of God. 
<br />• It should be cherished.
<br /><br />• It should be nourished.
<br /><br />• It should be protected. 
<br />God treats a fetus (baby) in the womb as a living person.
<br />Some people say, &quot;The Bible does not say anything about abortion.&quot; Let's look at that statement.
<br /><br />Although the Bible does not use the terms &quot;abortion&quot; or &quot;pro-life,&quot; does that mean God doesn't care about abortion? Not at all. There are countless wrong things that are not mentioned by name in the Bible. But rather than list everything that would be against God's will, the Bible gives us guidelines and principles that we can apply to the issues that come up in our lives.
<br /><br />As the following Scriptures show, Christians (or members of other religions) do not need to wonder what God thinks about unborn children or whether he considers a fetus a child.
<br /><br />Did not he who made me in the womb make them? Did not the same one form us both within our mothers? (Job 31:15).
<br /><br />Yet you brought me out of the womb; you made me trust in you even at my mother's breast. From birth I was cast upon you; from my mother's womb you have been my God (Psalm 22:9-10).
<br /><br />For you created my inmost being; you knit me together in my mother's womb. I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made; your works are wonderful, I know that full well. My frame was not hidden from you when I was made in the secret place. When I was woven together in the depths of the earth, your eyes saw my unformed body. All the days ordained for me were written in your book before one of them came to be (Psalm 139:13-16).
<br /><br />This is what the LORD says—he who made you, who formed you in the womb, and who will help you...(Isaiah 44:2).
<br /><br />Listen to me, O house of Jacob, all you who remain of the house of Israel, you whom I have upheld since you were conceived, and have carried since your birth. Even to your old age and gray hairs I am he, I am he who will sustain you. I have made you and I will carry you; I will sustain you and I will rescue you (Isaiah 46:3-4).
<br /><br />And now the LORD says—he who formed me in the womb to be his servant to bring Jacob back to him and gather Israel to himself, for I am honored in the eyes of the LORD and my God has been my strength (Isaiah 49:5).
<br /><br />The word of the LORD came to me, saying, &quot;Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, before you were born I set you apart; I appointed you as a prophet to the nations&quot; (Jeremiah 1:4-5).
<br /><br />When Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting, the baby leaped in her womb, and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit. In a loud voice she exclaimed: &quot;Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the child you will bear! As soon as the sound of your greeting reached my ears, the baby in my womb leaped for joy&quot; (Luke 1:41-42, 44).
<br /><br />God says murder is sin. (Abortion kills the fetus.)
<br />The Bible does not specifically use the word &quot;abortion,&quot; but it's clear about &quot;murder.&quot;
<br /><br />You shall not murder (Exodus 20:13). 
<br />God calls us to protect the defenseless, including children.
<br />One of the key themes throughout the Bible and historical Christianity is that we should be concerned about the welfare of the poor, weak, and helpless. Many Scriptures make this very clear. In addition to the following verses, read what James wrote in the New Testament about religion that is pure and faultless (James 1:27). Although James was not writing about abortion, the principle is clear: We should be concerned about those who are unable to care for themselves.
<br /><br />Defend the cause of the weak and fatherless; maintain the rights of the poor and oppressed. Rescue the weak and needy; deliver them from the hand of the wicked (Psalm 82:3-4).
<br /><br />Rescue those being led away to death; hold back those staggering toward slaughter. If you say, &quot;But we knew nothing about this,&quot; does not he who weighs the heart perceive it? Does not he who guards your life know it? Will he not repay each person according to what he has done? (Proverbs 24:11-12).
<br /><br />The Bible says God forgives those who had an abortion when they ask.
<br />Everyone has sinned in many ways. Scriptures throughout the Bible reassure us of God's love for us and let us know that when we confess our sins, he forgives us and purifies us. Christianity is more than a religion, it is an opportunity to know God intimately. Learn more about Christianity here..
<br /><br />Have mercy on me, O God, according to your unfailing love; according to your great compassion blot out my transgressions. Wash away all my iniquity and cleanse me from my sin (Psalm 51:1-2).
<br /><br />Hide your face from my sins and blot out all my iniquity. Create in me a pure heart, O God, and renew a steadfast spirit within me (Psalm 51:9-10).
<br /><br />If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness. If we claim we have not sinned, we make him out to be a liar and his word has no place in our lives. My dear children, I write this to you so that you will not sin. But if anybody does sin, we have one who speaks to the Father in our defense—Jesus Christ, the Righteous One (1 John 1:9-2:1).
<br /><br />Ask God to reveal his love for you. (Click here for info on God's love for you.)
<br />Sometimes we think of God as being a big meanie in the sky, yet just the opposite is true. God's love for us—and God's love for you—is amazing. Even his commands, which sometime seem like a bummer, are for our good. Take a minute to read this Bible study on God's love for us. There's nothing more strengthening than to bask in God's love.

<br /><br />The Bible Regards Abortion as Murder 01/16/2010 7:11 AM
<br /><br />What the Bible says are the responsibilities of civil authorities in upholding justice is a point being missed by some people in the pro-life movement in particular and by the public in general. The Bible commands the civil authorities to administer justice &quot;upon him that doeth evil&quot; (Rom.13:4). 
<br />If Christians do not report very clearly about what the Bible says is sin, then the people will never know how to repent. &quot;For by the law is the knowledge of sin&quot; (Rom.3:20). 
<br /><br />The Bible has always regarded abortion - killing the child in the womb as murder, a crime punishable by the death penalty. The grounds for this judgment are &quot;Thou shalt not kill&quot; (Ex.20:13); Child Sacrifice, &quot;he shall surely be put to death&quot; (Leviticus 20:1-5); and Exodus 21:22-23, where an example of abortion is found:
<br /><br />&quot;If men strive, and hurt a women with child, so that her fruit depart from her, and yet no mischief follow: he shall be surely punished, according as the woman's husband will lay upon him; and he shall pay as the judges determine. And if any mischief follow, then thou shalt give life for life&quot; (Ex.21:22-23). 
<br />In Exodus 21: 22-23, the Bible sets forth a minimal case with larger implications for justice to be served by the civil authorities: 
<br />(1.) &quot;If men strive... .&quot; 
<br />The plural &quot;men&quot; is employed for the purpose of speaking indefinitely, because there might possibly be more than one person involved in causing injury. 
<br /><br />(2.) &quot;So that her fruit depart from her, and yet no mischief follow... .&quot; 
<br />An example of a premature birth. Even if no injury results to either mother or child, the man who causes the &quot;premature birth&quot; is liable to be fined and, in fact, must be fined. The Bible strongly protects the pregnant mother and her child, so that every pregnant mother has a strong hedge of legal protection around her. 
<br /><br />(3.) &quot;And if mischief follow, then thou shalt give life for life... .&quot;
<br />An example of accidental abortion. If the penalty for an &quot;accidental abortion&quot; is so severe, it's obvious that a deliberately induced abortion is strongly forbidden. It is not necessary to have a separate ban on any form of deliberate abortion since the maximum penalty is served by this statute. If man through his own reckless actions, unintentionally hurts a pregnant mother and causes her to abort a child, he must suffer the death penalty. How much more so for any person who intentionally induces an abortion? 
<br /><br />(4.) &quot;if any mischief follow... give life for life.&quot; 
<br />The Bible strongly protects human life from the moment of conception. With the phrase &quot;if any mischief follow,&quot; the child has equal protection under the law from the moment of conception &quot;life for life.&quot; 
<br /><br />God does not make exceptions that tolerate injury to any pregnant mother, or any child in the womb. In fact CURSES &quot;come upon&quot; and &quot;overtake&quot; nations that refuse to administer justice (Deut. 28:15). 
<br /><br />If God does not tolerate exceptions to the administration of justice concerning murder by abortion, then neither shoulhttp

<br /><br />3.  Drink lots of carbonated beverages, beer, wine or liquor as often as possible.
<br /><br />4.  Eat candy bars and other sweets, including pies and cakes, several times each day.
<br /><br />5.  At each meal, be sure to fill your plate with about three times more food than other people do, and then make certain you eat it all.
<br /><br />6.  Always go back for seconds, and then be sure to eat two or three desserts.
<br /><br />7.  Always eat the skin and fat from meats, and make sure to eat lots of cheese, white bread, rolls, potatoes and gravey, and everything else that is fattening.
<br /><br />8.   Avoid exercise as much as possible, and be sure to fill your body with snacks as you sit around watching tv all day and night.
<br /><br />9.  Never take vitamins, because they could help prevent pre-mature aging.
<br /><br />10.  Stay up all night and then sleep most of the day.
<br /><br />11. Always look for the worse in every situation.
<br /><br />12.  Try to find fault with as many people as possible.
<br /><br />13.  Go around with a &quot;chip on your shoulder&quot; and try to find people who will knock it off.
<br /><br />14.  Never smile, and be sure to frown often.
<br /><br />15.  Associate with people who are negative and pessimistic so you can learn to be just like them.
<br /><br />16.  Avoid watching positive and uplifting programs on television, especially musicals and the educational channel.
<br /><br />If you can do these things, you will be well on your way to becoming older faster.
<br /><br />IMPORTANT  NOTE:
<br /><br />Because many people have made the above rules a part of their life-style, they are now filled with depression, bitterness, hatred, and self-imposed diseases that never should have happened to them.  The Bible states that  &quot;As A Man Thinketh, So Is He.&quot;
<br /><br />Look over this list and see if any of them apply to your life-style.  If you find any, I strongly suggest you make an honest attempt to correct them as quickly as possible.

<br />I want to shear this with you about a poor little boy who was selling news papers in the cold read this
<br /><br />-                        John 3:16
<br /><br />[A Wonderful Story]
<br /><br />? 
<br /><br />A little boy was selling newspapers on the corner,
<br />                                               the people were in and out of the cold. 
<br /><br />The little boy was so cold that he wasn't trying 
<br />to sell many papers. 
<br /><br />He walked up to a policeman and said,
<br />&quot;Mister, you wouldn't happen to know where a poor boy
<br />could find a warm place to sleep tonight would you? 
<br /><br />You see, I sleep in a box up around the corner there and  
<br />down the alley and it's awful cold in there for tonight.  
<br />Sure would be nice to have a warm place to stay.&quot; 
<br /><br />The policeman looked down at the little boy and said, &quot;You
<br />go down the street to that big white house and you knock
<br />on the door. When they come out the door you just say
<br />John 3:16, and they will let you in.&quot; 
<br /><br />So he did. He walked up the steps and knocked on the  
<br />door, and a lady answered. He looked up and said,
<br />&quot;John 3:16..&quot; The lady said, &quot;Come on in, Son.&quot; 
<br /><br />She took him in and she sat him down in a split! bottom
<br />rocker in front of a great big old fireplace, and she went  
<br />off. The boy sat there for a while and thought to himself:
<br />John 3:16 .   I don't understand   it, but it sure makes a
<br />cold boy warm. 
<br /><br />Later she came back and asked him &quot;Are you hungry ? &quot;
<br />He said, &quot;Well, just a little.. I haven't eaten in a couple of
<br />days, and I guess I could stand a little bit of food,&quot; 
<br /><br />The lady took him in the kitchen and sat him down to a table  
<br />full of wonderful food. He ate and ate until he couldn't eat
<br />any more. Then he thought to himself:
<br />John 3:16. Boy, I sure don't understand it but it sure
<br />makes a hungry boy full. 
<br /><br />She took him upstairs to a bathroom to a huge bathtub  
<br />filled with warm water, and he sat there and soaked for a
<br />while. As he soaked, he thought to himself: John 3:16  
<br />I sure don't understand it, but it sure makes a dirty boy
<br />clean. You know, I've not had a bath, a real bath, in my  
<br />whole life. The only bath I ever had was when I stood in
<br />front of that big old fire hydrant as they flushed it out.
<br /><br />The lady came in and got him... She took him to a room,
<br />tucked him into a big old feather bed, pulled the covers  
<br />up around his neck, kissed him goodnight and turned out
<br />the lights... As he lay in the darkness and looked out the
<br />window at the snow coming down on that cold night,
<br />he thought to himself: John 3:16...I don't understand it but  
<br />it sure makes a tired boy rested. 
<br /><br />The next morning the lady came back up and took him
<br />down again to that same big table full of food. After he
<br />ate, she took him back to that same big old split bottom  
<br />rocker in front of the fireplace and picked up
<br />a big old Bible.

<br /><br />Smoking Cigarettes Will Kill You 
<br /><br />Change in cigarettes more dangerous to lungs?
<br /><br />Higher levels of chemical linked to certain type of lung cancer, study finds
<br /><br />WASHINGTON - It may be riskier on the lungs to smoke cigarettes today than it was a few decades ago — at least in the U.S., says new research that blames changes in cigarette design for fueling a certain type of lung cancer.
<br /><br />Up to half of the nation's lung cancer cases may be due to those changes, Dr. David Burns of the University of California, San Diego, told a recent meeting of tobacco researchers.
<br /><br />It's not the first time that scientists have concluded the 1960s movement for lower-tar cigarettes brought some unexpected consequences. But this study, while preliminary, is among the most in-depth looks. And intriguingly it found the increase in a kind of lung tumor called adenocarcinoma was higher in the U.S. than in Australia even though both countries switched to so-called milder cigarettes at the same time.
<br /><br />&quot;The most likely explanation for it is a change in the cigarette,&quot; Burns said in an interview — and he cited a difference: Cigarettes sold in Australia contain lower levels of nitrosamines, a known carcinogen, than those sold in the U.S.
<br /><br />That's circumstantial evidence that requires more research, he acknowledged.
<br /><br />But anti-smoking advocates are citing the study as Congress considers whether the Food and Drug Administration should regulate tobacco, legislation that would give the agency power to decide such things as whether to set caps on certain chemicals in tobacco smoke.
<br /><br />Smokers once tended to get lung cancer in larger air tubes, particularly a type named &quot;squamous cell carcinoma.&quot; Then doctors noticed a jump in adenocarcinoma, which grows in small air sacs far deeper in the lung. Initial studies blamed introduction of filtered, lower-tar cigarettes. When smokers switched, they began inhaling more deeply to get their nicotine jolt, pushing cancer-causing smoke deeper than before.
<br /><br />Burns' study, presented at a meeting of the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco, took a closer look. He compared smoking behaviors of different age groups over four decades — how much they smoked, when they started, when they quit — and how cancer-risk changed.
<br />The risk of squamous cell carcinoma stayed about the same over those years, Burns found. But adenocarcinoma rose. It makes up 65 percent to 70 percent of newly occurring U.S. lung cancer cases, but no more than 40 percent of Australia's lung cancer, he said.
<br /><br />While the nation's total lung cancer cases have inched down as the number of smokers has dropped in recent years, the study suggests an individual smoker's risk of getting cancer is higher.
<br /><br />It's well known that cigarettes differ from country to country, because of different tobacco crops grown locally and smokers' varying tastes. Nitrosamines are a byproduct of tobacco processing and levels vary for several reasons, including differences in curing practices.
<br /><br />Australian cigarettes contain about 20 percent of the nitrosamine content of U.S. cigarettes, making the chemical a prime suspect, concluded Burns, who has been scientific editor of several surgeon general reports on tobacco.
<br /><br />That doesn't rule out a role for deeper inhaling, cautioned Dr. Michael Thun of the American Cancer Society: &quot;There's several strong suspects in the lineup. They may have acted in combination.&quot;
<br /><br />Philip Morris USA spokesman David Sutton called the study speculative and hard to evaluate until it's published in a medical journal, something Burns plans to do.
<br /><br />Still, Philip Morris, which supports FDA tobacco regulation, began taking steps with its growers in 2000 that have yielded &quot;significantly lower&quot; nitrosamine levels in recent years' supplies, Sutton said.
<br /><br />Be careful in assuming lower-nitrosamine cigarettes are less lethal, said Dr. Neal Benowitz of the University of California, San Francisco, a well-known tobacco expert. Lung cancer is only one of tobacco's many risks — it causes heart disease and other killer diseases, too.
<br /><br />&quot;If you reduce someone's (lung cancer) risk by 10 percent, that's not really meaningful for an individual,&quot; he said. &quot;The goal still is to get them to stop.&quot;
<br /><br />cigarettes will kill you-no butts about it 
<br /><br />1. List all the specific personal reasons for why you want to stop smoking, including the gains of quitting, and then set a concrete day for quitting.  
<br /><br />2. Speak with your provider about products and programs and that are designed to help you quit. 
<br /><br />3. Get rid of all cigarettes, lighters, ash trays and matches (other than safety matches) right before your quit date.
<br /><br />4. Avoid places that you smoke in, people that you smoke with and places that you buy cigarettes.
<br /><br />5. Sit in non-smoking sections or go to smoking prohibited cafeterias and restaurants. Spend time in public buildings, museums, stores, theatres, hospitals, etc, where you can't smoke.
<br /><br />6. Get away from the table immediately after you eat and do something incompatible with smoking (e.g. walk, do dishes, wash hands, garden, hobbies, etc).
<br /><br />7. Keep handy a range of low calorie and non-edible smoking substitutes to use when you have an urge to smoke. Ice water, toothpicks, sugar-free candies and mints, worry beads, hand-held computer games work well. Have them available on your person, at home, work and car.

<br /><br />Have You Ever Wondered What's In a Cigarette? 01/17/2010 3:51 PM
<br /><br />Cigarette smoke contains over 4,000 chemicals, including 43 known cancer-causing (carcinogenic) compounds and 400 other toxins. These include nicotine, tar, and carbon monoxide, as well as formaldehyde, ammonia, hydrogen cyanide, arsenic, and DDT. 
<br />Nicotine is highly addictive. Smoke containing nicotine is inhaled into the lungs, and the nicotine reaches your brain in just six seconds. 
<br /><br />Nicotine in small doses acts as a stimulant to the brain. In large doses, it's a depressant, inhibiting the flow of signals between nerve cells. In even larger doses, it's a lethal poison, affecting the heart, blood vessels, and hormones. Nicotine in the bloodstream acts to make the smoker feel calm. 
<br /><br />As a cigarette is smoked, the amount of tar inhaled into the lungs increases, and the last puff contains more than twice as much tar as the first puff. Carbon monoxide makes it harder for red blood cells to carry oxygen throughout the body. Tar is a mixture of substances that together form a sticky mass in the lungs. 
<br /><br />Most of the chemicals inhaled in cigarette smoke stay in the lungs. The more you inhale, the better it feels—and the greater the damage to your lungs.

<br /><br />Cigarette Maker Now Lists Ingredients
<br />For the first time, an American tobacco company has begun listing long-secret ingredients contained in its cigarettes directly on the label. Yesterday, Liggett Group Inc. introduced cartons that the company plans to begin using that list the ingredients in its L&amp;M cigarettes, including molasses, phenylacetic acid and the oil of the East Indian mint called patchouli. The move comes as the state of Massachusetts is trying to compel disclosure of all ingredients by all cigarette makers, an effort that other major tobacco companies are fighting. 
<br />Liggett, which broke with the industry by signing the first settlements ever with states and private attorneys suing it, supports the Massachusetts effort as well. &quot;Liggett believes that its adult consumers have a right to full disclosure,&quot; Liggett head Bennett S. LeBow said in a statement. Along with blended tobacco and water, the 26-item L&amp;M list includes high fructose corn syrup, sugar, natural and artificial licorice flavor, menthol, artificial milk chocolate and natural chocolate flavor, valerian root extract, molasses and vanilla extracts, and cedarwood oil. Less familiar additives include glycerol, propylene glycol, isovaleric acid, hexanoic acid and 3-methylpentanoic acid. 
<br /><br />Some 600 ingredients are used in American cigarettes, but a Liggett spokesman said the L&amp;M statement was a &quot;quite exhaustive list&quot; of every ingredient used in that brand. 
<br /><br />Ingredients in tobacco products have never been proved harmful -- especially when compared with the many toxins found in tobacco smoke itself. But activists have long pushed for disclosure of the ingredients, in part because consumers tend to be more wary of risks imposed upon them by others than of the risks they knowingly choose. 
<br /><br />The companies have provided lists of ingredients to the federal Department of Health and Human Services for more than a decade, but government officials are legally not allowed to release the information. The industry also presented a composite list of 599 additives to congressional investigators in 1994, but that was never officially made public. 
<br /><br />David Remes, an attorney who represents the four other tobacco companies challenging the state of Massachusetts, said the case comes down to the industry's right to protect its trade secrets.

<br /><br />Cigarette flavors have gone through many changes since cigarettes were first made. Initially, cigarettes were unfiltered, allowing the full &quot;flavor&quot; of the tar to come through. As the public became concerned about the health effects of smoking, filters were added. While this helped alleviate the public's fears, the result was a cigarette that tasted too bitter. 
<br /><br />Filters Don't Work
<br />Filters do not remove enough tar to make cigarettes less dangerous. They are just a marketing ploy to trick you into thinking you are smoking a safer cigarette. 
<br /><br />The solution to the bitter-tasting cigarette was easy -- have some chemists add taste-improving chemicals to the tobacco. Unfortunately, some of these chemicals also cause cancer. 
<br /><br />But not all of the chemicals in your cigarettes are there for taste enhancement. For example, a chemical very similar to rocket fuel helps keep the tip of the cigarette burning at an extremely hot temperature. This allows the nicotine in tobacco to turn into a vapor so your lungs can absorb it more easily. 
<br /><br />Toilet Bowl Cleaner?
<br />Most people prefer to use ammonia for things such as cleaning windows and toilet bowls. You may be surprised to learn that the tobacco industry has found some additional uses for this household product. By adding ammonia to your cigarettes, nicotine in its vapor form can be absorbed through your lungs more quickly. This, in turn, means your brain can get a higher dose of nicotine with each puff. 
<br /><br />The complete list of chemicals added to your cigarettes is too long to list here. Here are some examples that will surprise you: 
<br /><br />Fungicides and pesticides -- Cause many types of cancers and birth defects. 
<br />Cadmium -- Linked to lung and prostate cancer. 
<br />Benzene -- Linked to leukemia. 
<br />Formaldehyde -- Linked to lung cancer. 
<br />Nickel -- Causes increased susceptibility to lung infections. 
<br />If you are angry that so many things have been added to the cigarettes you enjoy so much, you should be. Many of these chemicals were added to make you better able to tolerate toxic amounts of cigarette smoke. They were added without regard to your health and with the intent to keep you addicted. As the tobacco industry saying goes, &quot;An addicted customer is a customer for life, no matter how short that life is.&quot; 
<br /><br />Make sure that you have the last laugh. Regardless of the countless chemicals in your cigarettes, quitting is always your option. 
<br /><br />Perhaps this list of ingredients that are found in cigarettes is enough to make you want to quit smoking for good!
<br /><br />There are more than 4,000 ingredients in a cigarette other than tobacco. Common additives include yeast, wine, caffeine, beeswax and chocolate. Here are some other ingredients: 
<br /><br />Ammonia: Household cleaner
<br />Angelica root extract: Known to cause cancer in animals
<br />Arsenic: Used in rat poisons
<br />Benzene: Used in making dyes, synthetic rubber
<br />Butane: Gas; used in lighter fluid
<br />Carbon monoxide: Poisonous gas
<br />Cadmium: Used in batteries
<br />Cyanide: Deadly poison
<br />DDT: A banned insecticide
<br />Ethyl Furoate: Causes liver damage in animals
<br />Lead: Poisonous in high doses
<br />Formaldehiyde: Used to preserve dead specimens
<br />Methoprene: Insecticide
<br />Megastigmatrienone: Chemical naturally found in grapefruit juice
<br />Maltitol: Sweetener for diabetics
<br />Napthalene: Ingredient in mothballs
<br />Methyl isocyanate: Its accidental release killed 2000 people in Bhopal, India in 1984
<br />Polonium: Cancer-causing radioactive element
<br /><br />What's in a Cigarette? 
<br />by K. H. Ginzel, M.D.
<br /><br />For those who still don't know — let me emphatically state that cigarette smoking is a true addiction! To grasp this well-documented fact, one really doesn't have to study all the supporting scientific evidence. One simply needs to consider that no other drug is self-administered with the persistence, regularity and frequency of a cigarette. At an average rate of ten puffs per cigarette, a one to three pack-a-day smoker inhales 70,000 to 200,000 individual doses of mainstream smoke during a single year. Ever since its large scale industrial production early in this century, the popularity of the modern cigarette has been spreading like wildfire. Here is the first, and perhaps the most significant answer to the title question: Addiction is in a cigarette. 
<br /><br />Probing into what makes a cigarette so irresistible, we find that much of the recent research corroborates earlier claims: It is for the nicotine in tobacco that the smoker smokes, the chewer chews, and the dipper dips. Hence, nicotine is in a cigarette. 
<br /><br />In contrast to other drugs, nicotine delivery from tobacco carries an ominous burden of chemical poisons and cancer-producing substances that boggle the mind. Many toxic agents are in a cigarette. However, additional toxicants are manufactured during the smoking process by the chemical reactions occurring in the glowing tip of the cigarette. The number is staggering: more than 4,000 hazardous compounds are present in the smoke that smokers draw into their lungs and which escapes into the environment between puffs. 
<br /><br />The burning of tobacco generates more than 150 billion tar particles per cubic inch, constituting the visible portion of cigarette smoke. According to chemists at R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, cigarette smoke is 10,000 times more concentrated than the automobile pollution at rush hour on a freeway. The lungs of smokers, puffing a daily ration of 20 to 60 low to high tar cigarettes, collect an annual deposit of one-quarter to one and one-half pounds of the gooey black material, amounting to a total of 15 to 90 million pounds of carcinogen-packed tar for the aggregate of current American smokers. Hence, tar is in a cigarette. 
<br /><br />But visible smoke contributes only 5-8% to the total output of a cigarette. The remaining bulk that cannot be seen makes up the so-called vapor or gas phase of cigarette &quot;smoke.&quot; It contains, besides nitrogen and oxygen, a bewildering assortment of toxic gases, such as carbon monoxide, formaldehyde, acrolein, hydrogen cyanide, and nitrogen oxides, to name just a few. Smokers efficiently extract almost 90% of the particulate as well as gaseous constituents (about 50% in the case of carbon monoxide) from the mainstream smoke of the 600 billion cigarettes consumed annually in the U.S. In addition, 2.25 million metric tons of sidestream smoke chemicals pollute the enclosed air spaces of homes, offices, conference rooms, bars, restaurants, and automobiles in this country. Hence, pollution is in a cigarette. 
<br /><br />The witch's brew of poisons invades the organs and tissues of smokers and nonsmokers, adults and children, born as well as unborn, and causes cancer, emphysema, heart disease, fetal growth retardation and other problems during pregnancy. The harm inflicted by all other addictions combined pales in comparison. Smoking-related illness, for example, claims in a few days as many victims as cocaine does in a whole year. Hence, disease is in a cigarette. 
<br /><br />The irony is that many of the poisons found in cigarette smoke are subject to strict regulation by federal laws which, on the other hand, specifically exempt tobacco products. &quot;Acceptable Daily Intake,&quot; ADI, is the amount of a chemical an individual can be exposed to for an extended period without apparent detriment to health.
<br /><br />In addition, there is the chemical burden from sidestream smoke, afflicting smokers and non-smokers alike. Based on the reported concentrations in enclosed, cigarette smoke-polluted areas, the estimated intakes of nicotine, acrolein, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide and formaldehyde peak at 200, 130, 75, 7, and 3 times the ADI, respectively. The high exposure to acrolein is especially unsettling. This compound is not only a potent respiratory irritant, but qualifies, according to current studies, as a carcinogen. 
<br /><br />Regulatory policy aims at restricting exposure to carcinogens to a level where the lifetime risk of cancer would not exceed 1 in 100,000 to 1,000,000. Due to a limited database, approximate upper lifetime risk values could be calculated for only 7 representative cigarette smoke carcinogens. The risk values were extraordinarily high, ranging from 1 in 6,000 to 1 in 16. Because of the awesome amount of carcinogens found in cigarette smoke and the fact that carcinogens combine their individual actions in an additive or even multiplicative fashion, it is not surprising that the actual risk for lung cancer is as high as one in ten. Hence, cancer is in a cigarette. 
<br /><br />Among the worst offenders are the nitrosamines. Strictly regulated by federal agencies, their concentrations in beer, bacon, and baby bottle nipples must not exceed 5 to 10 parts per billion. A typical person ingests about one microgram a day, while the smokers' intake tops this by 17 times for each pack of cigarette smoked. In 1976, a rocket fuel manufacturer in the Baltimore area was emitting dimethylnitrosamine into the surrounding air, exposing the local inhabitants to an estimated 14 micrograms of the carcinogen per day. The plant was promptly shut down. However eagerly the government tries to protect us from outdoor pollution and the carcinogenic risk of consumer products, it blatantly suspends control if the offending chemical is in, or comes from, a cigarette. Hence, hypocrisy is in a cigarette. 
<br /><br />But there is still more in a cigarette than addiction, poison, pollution, disease, and hypocrisy. A half century of aggressive promotion and sophisticated advertising that featured alluring role models from theater, film and sport, has invested the cigarette with an enticing imagery.
<br /><br />Imagery which captivates and seduces a growing youngster. The youngster, indispensable for being recruited into the future army of smokers, does not start to smoke cigarettes for the nicotine, but for the false promises they hold. Hence, deceit is in a cigarette. In summary, no drug ever ingested by humans can rival the long-term debilitating effects of tobacco; the carnage perpetuated by its purveyors; the merciless irreversibility of destiny once the victim contracts lung cancer or emphysema; the militant denial on the part of those who, with the support of stockholders and the sanction of governments, legally push their lethal merchandise across borders and continents killing every year two and one-half to three million people worldwide. All things added together: death is in a cigarette.

<br /><br />Cigarette Ingredients Chemicals in Tobacco Smoke
<br /><br />There are over 4,000 chemicals in tobacco smoke and at least 69 of those chemicals are known to cause cancer.
<br /><br />The list of 599 additives approved by the US Government for use in the manufacture of cigarettes is something every smoker should see. Submitted by the five major American cigarette companies to the Dept. of Health and Human Services in April of 1994, this list of ingredients had long been kept a secret.
<br /><br />Tobacco companies reporting this information were:
<br />   American Tobacco Company
<br />   Brown and Williamson
<br />   Liggett Group, Inc.
<br />   Philip Morris Inc.
<br />   R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company
<br /><br />While these ingredients are approved as additives for foods, they were not tested by burning them, and it is the burning of many of these substances which changes their properties, often for the worse. Over 4000 chemical compounds are created by burning a cigarette – 69 of those chemicals are known to cause cancer. Carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, hydrogen cyanides and ammonia are all present in cigarette smoke. Forty-three known carcinogens are in mainstream smoke, sidestream smoke or both. It's chilling to think about not only how smokers poison themselves, but what others are exposed to by breathing in the secondhand smoke. The next time you're missing your old buddy, the cigarette, take a good long look at this list and see them for what they are: a delivery system for toxic chemical and carcinogens.

<br /><br />The 10th World Conference on Tobacco or Health opened yesterday in Peking with grim warnings about the cost of the smoking epidemic.
<br /><br />Patterns of smoking seen in the West after the Second World War, when 80 per cent of British and American men smoked, are being repeated in developing countries such as China, with the inevitable consequence of a surge in smoking-related deaths in decades to come.
<br /><br />The death-toll is set to shift from the developed to the developing world over the next 30 years. This will include a sharp rise in tobacco-related fatalities in China, where 320 million smokers puff their way through one in three of all cigarettes smoked world-wide.
<br /><br />Richard Peto, Professor of Medical Statistics at Oxford University and an authority on smoking, told the 1,800 delegates that he estimated that this year 3.5 million people worldwide will die of smoking, of whom 2 million are in the developed countries.
<br /><br />By about 2025 the annual global death-toll will reach 10 million, of whom 7 million will be in the developing countries. World-wide over the next 20 years there will be about 100 million deaths from smoking unless adult smokers stop.
<br /><br />China, where three-quarters of middle-aged men smoke, will see one of the biggest increases. &quot;I know Deng Xiaoping survived to the age of 90, but he was an exception,&quot; said Mr Peto, referring to the chain-smoking Chinese patriarch, who died in February aged 92. But just as Deng eventually gave up, so should others. Those who stop before the age of 35 have a survival rate almost identical to lifelong non-smokers, and those who stop at a later age still show big benefits.
<br /><br />Mr Peto said figures indicated that 700,000 Chinese people are dying of tobacco-related diseases a year, compared with 500,000 in the US and 500,000 in the European Union. &quot;China already has more tobacco deaths than any other country,&quot; said Mr Peto.
<br /><br />Next century the annual toll in China will rise to 3 million; a third of all Chinese males under the age of 30 will be killed by tobacco.
<br /><br />China has seen an big increase in cigarette consumption over the past 20 years and is viewed by tobacco companies as the world's most enticing market. The director-general of the World Health Organisation, Hiroshi Nakajima, yesterday welcomed recent lawsuits against cigarette-makers in the US and the admission by the Ligget Group that tobacco was addictive.
<br /><br />Last week Geoffrey Bible, chairman of Philip Morris, conceded that some American deaths might have been caused &quot;in part&quot; by smoking. But Mr Nakajima warned: &quot;We must demand that the large multinational tobacco companies that experience controls in their home countries are not free to expand into markets in other countries.&quot;
<br /><br />China's domestic tobacco industry is run by the government as a state monopoly, producing 1,700,000,000,000 cigarettes a year. Tobacco taxes are the biggest single contributor to central-government coffers in China. This may explain the often lax implementation of China's anti-smoking regulations. More than 70 cities have banned smoking in public places and from 1 May smoking was supposed to stop on all public transport, but in reality these rules are routinely disregarded. Yesterday's overall message was bleak. Half of long-term smokers will be killed by smoking diseases. It is &quot;like flipping a coin&quot;, said Mr Peto. Half of those who die will do so before the age of 70, losing 20 to 25 years of their normal life expectancy.

<br /><br />Smoking Rates Among African Americans
<br /><br />In 2008, about 5.6 million, or 21.3 percent of non-Hispanic black adults smoked cigarettes compared to 22 percent of non-Hispanic whites. African Americans accounted for approximately 12 percent of the 46 million adults who were current smokers in the United States during 2008.3 
<br />In 2008, 25.5 percent of non-Hispanic black men smoked compared to 23.6 percent of non-Hispanic white men.4 On average, white men tend to consume more cigarettes (about 30–40 percent more) than African American men.5 Despite their lower exposure, however, African American men are 37 percent more likely than white men to develop lung cancer.6 Black women tend to smoke less than white women but the two groups have similar lung cancer rates.7 
<br />Among African Americans, as with other U.S. populations, the prevalence of smoking declines as education level increases. In 2008, smoking rates were over 3.4 times higher among African American males over age 25 who had less than a high school education (34.5%) compared to those with a college education (10.1%). Smoking rates are also much higher in African American females over age 25 years old who have less than a high school education (23.2%) compared to those with a college education (9.5%).8 
<br />Between 1997 and 2007, the smoking rate declined 49 percent among African American high school students from 22.7 to 11.6 percent.9 These students were significantly less likely than non-Hispanic white and Hispanic students to report current smoking in 2007. They also have the highest percentage of trying to quit in the past 12 months (58.4%).10 
<br />In 2006, 5.5 percent of African American middle school students smoked cigarettes.  This rate was slightly lower than that for non-Hispanic white (6.5%) and Hispanic (6.8%) middle school students.11
<br />Other Facts About Smoking Among African Americans
<br />Use of menthol cigarettes is disproportionately high among African Americans. Sixty seven percent of African Americans smokers aged 12 years or older reported smoking a mentholated brand of cigarette compared to less than 16 percent of their White and Hispanic counterparts.12 
<br />As smoking declines among the white non-Hispanic population, tobacco companies have targeted both African Americans and Hispanics with intensive merchandising, which includes billboards, advertising in media oriented to these communities, and sponsorship of civic groups and athletic, cultural, and entertainment events.13 
<br />African American communities have been bombarded with cigarette advertising. Since the signing of the Master Settlement Agreement (MSA) in 1998 through 2005, the average youth in the United States is annually exposed to 559 tobacco ads, every adult female 617 advertisements, and every African American adult 892 ads.  Money spent on magazine advertising of mentholated cigarettes, popular with African Americans, increased from 13 percent of total ad expenditures in 1998 to 49 percent in 2005.14 
<br />The former Brown and Williamson Tobacco Company (now part of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company) ran a campaign for Kool cigarettes aimed at black youths in 2006 that featured hip-hop DJ competitions, themed cigarette packs, and was billed as a &quot;celebration&quot; of hip-hop music and culture.15,16

<br /><br />Second Hand Smoke
<br /><br />The 2006 Surgeon General's Report on secondhand smoke concluded that there is no risk-free level of exposure to secondhand smoke.1 Short term exposure to secondhand smoke can potentially increase the risk of heart attacks; a 2009 report by the Institute of Medicine confirmed that secondhand smoke is a cause of heart attack and concluded that relatively brief exposure to secondhand smoke could trigger a heart attack.2
<br /><br />Since 1992, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) classified secondhand smoke as a &quot;Group A&quot; carcinogen, which means there is no safe level of exposure. Secondhand smoke is a mixture of the smoke produced by the burning end of a cigarette, pipe or cigar and the smoke exhaled from the lungs of smokers. Secondhand smoke contains a complex mixture of over 200 poisons, including more than 43 chemicals that are know cancer-causing agents. Below are listed a few of the lethal combination of chemicals:
<br /><br />Chemical Commonly Found In 
<br />Acetone
<br /> Nail Polish
<br /><br />Acetylene
<br /> Fuel For Torches
<br /><br />Ammonia
<br /> Window Cleaner
<br /><br />Arsenic

<br /><br />Secondhand Smoke Is Deadly.
<br />Secondhand smoke causes an estimated 800 deaths a year in Oregon.3 
<br />According to Oregon physician death certificate reports, tobacco contributed to 6,921 deaths in Oregon in 2005 (22 percent of all deaths).4 
<br />Nationwide, secondhand smoke causes approximately 53,000 deaths per year due to lung cancer, heart disease and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).5 
<br />Approximately 60 percent of people in the United States have physical evidence of secondhand smoke exposure.6 
<br />Research into previously secret tobacco industry documents reveals that research conducted by cigarette company Philip Morris in the 1980s showed that secondhand smoke was highly toxic, yet the company suppressed these findings for two decades. 7 
<br />Secondhand Smoke Increases Risk of Heart Disease and Lung Cancer.
<br />As few as 30 minutes of secondhand smoke exposure can impair coronary circulation in a non-smoker.8 
<br />One study found that secondhand smoke increases the risk of heart disease among non-smokers by as much as 60 percent.9 
<br />Breathing secondhand smoke can have immediate adverse effects on your blood and blood vessels, potentially increasing the resik of a heart attack.10 
<br />Breathing secondhand smoke interferes with the normal functioning of the heart, blood, and vascular systems in ways that increase the risk of heart attack. 
<br />For some of these negative effects the immediate impact of even short exposures to secondhand smoke appears to be almost as large as that observed in active smokers. 
<br />Even a short time in a smoky room can cause your blood platelets to become stickier. 
<br />Even brief secondhand smoke exposure can damage the lining of the blood vessels. 
<br />Constant exposure to secondhand smoke - in the workplace or home - nearly doubles the risk of having a heart attack, according to a landmark study of more than 32,000 women.11 
<br />Studies suggest that non-smokers who are exposed to secondhand smoke are 20 to 30 percent more likely to develop lung cancer.12 
<br />Women married to a smoker have a 91 percent greater risk of heart disease.11 
<br />Secondhand Smoke Exposure Harms Children. 
<br />Smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke among pregnant women can cause spontaneous abortions, ectopic pregnancies, still births, low-birth weight babies, and other pregnancy and delivery complications that require neonatal intensive care.13 
<br />If parents smoke around their children, the children can inhale the equivalent of 102 packs of cigarettes by age five.14 
<br />It is estimated that in Oregon, approximately 167,000 children are exposed to secondhand smoke at home.15 
<br />Nationwide, children exposed to secondhand smoke experience a total of seven million more days of missed school every year.16 
<br />Secondhand Smoke Relates To Many Illnesses In Children.
<br />Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS): The rate of SIDS is higher in babies exposed to secondhand smoke. SIDS is the second leading cause of infant deaths in Oregon.17 
<br /><br />Asthma: Children who grow up with smokers in the family are more likely to have asthma by the age of six than children living in non-smoking households.18 
<br /><br />Respiratory disease: The rate of bronchitis, pneumonia, colds and other respiratory infections is four times higher in children exposed to secondhand smoke than those living in smoke-free environments.17 
<br /><br />Secondhand smoke is responsible for between 150,000 and 300,000 lower respiratory tract infections in children under 18 months of age across the United States each year.19 
<br /><br />It is estimated that, in the United States each year, secondhand smoke exposure results in the hospitalization of 7,500 infants and 15,000 children due to lower respiratory tract infections and cuases 430 SIDS deaths in the U.S. annually.19 
<br /><br />Secondhand smoke exposure can cause the buildup of fluid in the middle ear, a condition that results in 790,000 physician office visits per year.20 
<br />Secondhand smoke can also aggravate symptoms in the 400,000 to 1,000,000 children in the U.S. with asthma, a serious, chronic lung disease. 
<br />In the United States, 21 million children (35 percent) live in homes where residents or visitors smoke in the home on a regular basis. 21 
<br />Approximately 50 to 75 percent of children in the U.S. have detectable levels of cotinine, a product of nicotine, in their blood.22 
<br />Secondhand Smoke Affects the Workplace.
<br />Nonsmokers exposed to secondhand smoke at work are at increased risk for adverse health effects. Levels of secondhand smoke in restaurants and bars were found to be 2 to 5 times higher than in personal residences of smokers and 2 to 6 times higher than in office workplaces.23 
<br />In a study it was found that wordplace productivity increased and absenteeism decreased among former smokers when compared with current smokers.24 
<br />The National Cancer Institute found that being employed in a workplace where smoking is prohibited is associated with a reduction in the number of cigarettes smoked per day and an increase in the success rate of smokers who are attempting to quit.25

<br /><br />The Truth About &quot;Light&quot; Cigarettes: Questions and Answers /01/22/2010 10:52 PM
<br /><br />Many smokers choose “low-tar,” “mild,” “light,” or “ultra-light” cigarettes because they think that these cigarettes may be less harmful to their health than “regular” or “full-flavor” cigarettes. Although smoke from light cigarettes may feel smoother and lighter on the throat and chest, light cigarettes are not healthier than regular cigarettes. The truth is that light cigarettes do not reduce the health risks of smoking. The only way to reduce a smoker’s risk, and the risk to others, is to stop smoking completely.
<br /><br />What about the lower tar and nicotine numbers on light and ultra-light cigarette packs and in ads for these products? 
<br />These numbers come from smoking machines, which “smoke” every brand of cigarettes exactly the same way. 
<br />These numbers do not really tell how much tar and nicotine a particular smoker may get because people do not smoke cigarettes the same way the machines do. And no two people smoke the same way. 
<br />How do light cigarettes trick the smoking machines? 
<br />Tobacco companies designed light cigarettes with tiny pinholes on the filters. These “filter vents” dilute cigarette smoke with air when light cigarettes are “puffed” on by smoking machines, causing the machines to measure artificially low tar and nicotine levels. 
<br />Many smokers do not know that their cigarette filters have vent holes. The filter vents are uncovered when cigarettes are smoked on smoking machines. However, filter vents are placed just millimeters from where smokers put their lips or fingers when smoking. As a result, many smokers block the vents—which actually turns the light cigarette into a regular cigarette. 
<br />Some cigarette makers increased the length of the paper wrap covering the outside of the cigarette filter, which decreases the number of puffs that occur during the machine test. Although tobacco under the wrap is still available to the smoker, this tobacco is not burned during the machine test. The result is that the machine measures less tar and nicotine levels than is available to the smoker. 
<br />Because smokers, unlike machines, crave nicotine, they may inhale more deeply; take larger, more rapid, or more frequent puffs; or smoke a few extra cigarettes each day to get enough nicotine to satisfy their craving. This is called “compensating,” and it means that smokers end up inhaling more tar, nicotine, and other harmful chemicals than the machine-based numbers suggest. 
<br />What is the scientific evidence about the health effects of light cigarettes? 
<br />The Federal Government’s National Cancer Institute (NCI) has concluded that light cigarettes provide no benefit to smokers’ health. 
<br />According to the NCI monograph Risks Associated with Smoking Cigarettes with Low Machine-Measured Yields of Tar and Nicotine, people who switch to light cigarettes from regular cigarettes are likely to inhale the same amount of hazardous chemicals, and they remain at high risk for developing smoking-related cancers and other diseases. 
<br />Researchers also found that the strategies used by the tobacco industry to advertise and promote light cigarettes are intended to reassure smokers, to discourage them from quitting, and to lead consumers to perceive filtered and light cigarettes as safer alternatives to regular cigarettes. 
<br />There is also no evidence that switching to light or ultra-light cigarettes actually helps smokers quit. 
<br />Have the tobacco companies conducted research on the amount of tar and nicotine people actually inhale while smoking light cigarettes? 
<br />The tobacco industry’s own documents show that companies are aware that smokers of light cigarettes compensate by taking bigger puffs. 
<br />Industry documents also show that the companies are aware of the difference between machine-measured yields of tar and nicotine and what the smoker actually inhales. 
<br />What is the bottom line for smokers who want to protect their health? 
<br />There is no such thing as a safe cigarette. The only proven way to reduce the risk of smoking-related disease is to quit smoking completely. 
<br />Smokers who quit live longer than those who continue to smoke. In addition, the earlier smokers quit, the greater the health benefit. Research has shown that people who quit before age 30 eliminate almost all of their risk of developing a tobacco-related disease. Even smokers who quit at age 50 reduce their risk of dying from a tobacco-related disease. 
<br />Quitting also decreases the risk of lung cancer, heart attacks, stroke, and chronic lung disease. 
<br />What resources are available on smoking cessation?

<br /><br />How are you doing ok? I have something to shear with you it is about jesus with out a picture.
<br />Some one wrote  wrote how he looked Insted of looking at a picture here it is.
<br /><br />THIS  IS  A  RARE,   COLLECTORS  ITEM
<br /><br />The Only Known Pen Picture of &quot;Jesus&quot; From Which All Artists Have Had To Work.
<br /><br />This description of Christ was written by Publius Lentullus, President of Judea, in the reign of Tibersius Caesar to that Monarch of Rome, and first appeared in the writings of Saint Anselm of Canterbury in the Eleventh Century.
<br /><br />There appeared in these our days a man of great virtue, named Jesus Christ, who is yet living among us, and of the Gentile is accepted for a prophet of truth, but His own disciples call Him the Son of God.  He raiseth the dead, and cureth all manner of diseases.  A man of stature somewhat tall and comely, with very reverend countenance, such as the beholders may love and fear.  His hair of a colour of a chestnut full ripe, plain to His ears, whence downward it is more orient and curling and wavering about His shoulders; in the midst of His head is a seam or partition in His hair, after the manner of the Nazarites.  His forehead plain and very delicate; His face without spot or wrinkle, beautified with a lovely red; His, nose and mouth so formed as nothing can be reprehended, His beard thickish; in colour like His hair, not very long, but forked; His look innocent and mature; His eyes grey, clear and quick.  In reproving He is terrible; in admonishing, courteous and fair spoken; pleasant in conversation, mixed with gravity.  It cannot be remembered that any have seen Him laugh, but many have seen Him weep.  In proportion of body excellent; His hands and arms most delicate to behold.  In speaking, very temperate, modest and wise.  A man for His singular beauty, surpassing the children of men.

<br />I have something I want to shear with all of you about THE OBESITY EPIDEMIC IN AMERICA.
<br />I want you to read this and I hope it will help some one out there ok read.
<br /><br />The Obesity Epidemic in America
<br /><br />By
<br /><br />Weeks Parker
<br /><br />DON'T EAT SAUSAGE BISCUITS
<br /><br />Several months ago I attended a lecture by a health expert who told her audience that sausage biscuits were very harmful to our physical health.  She advised anyone who likes sausage biscuits to eat only ONE  once a year on their birthday.   The consumption of sausage biscuits can cause obesity which often leads to diabetes, heart problems and other related illnesses. 
<br /><br />HOW MUCH SHOULD YOU WEIGH?
<br /><br />The Health Educator told us that we should never weigh much more than we did when we were 18 years old.  Although she was in her 50's, this lecturer was slim and trim and she told us that she still weighed about the same as she did when she was 18 years old.   I am 5 feet 10 inches tall and weigh about 140 pounds which is only a few pounds more than I weighed when I was in high school and college.  I have always eaten in MODERATION, and I firmly believe this is the secret to never becoming obese the way 80 percent of my friends have.   Some extremely foolish people LIVE TO EAT, but  I EAT TO LIVE.
<br /><br />OBESITY EPIDEMIC
<br /><br />During her lecture, the Health Educator verified what I had written about in one of my books.  She said that 80 percent of all adults in the United States are now overweight, and that many children are also obese.  She highly recommended that we avoid sweets, especially pies, cakes and candy bars.  She also suggested that when we eat meat, poultry or fish  it should be no larger than the size of a deck of cards.  All fat and skin should be removed from any meat before eating it. She recommended baking or broiling rather than frying  food.  Lots of fresh vegetables and fruits are highly recommended.  When you go to a restaurant with someone else, it is recommended that you place only one order for food and then share it with each other by asking the waitress for an extra empty plate.  Most restaurants serve you twice as much food as your body needs.  When you are dining at a buffet restaurant you should NEVER go back for seconds, and  you should drink water rather than carbonated beverages.
<br /><br />The Obesity Epidemic In America Is Getting Worse 02/11/2010 4:22 PM
<br /><br />March 5, 2002
<br /><br />The latest results of The Harris Poll® on smoking, seatbelt usage and obesity revealed that though Americans are remembering to strap in and not light up, when it comes to the buffet table they can't seem to back off.
<br /><br />Since 1983 Harris Interactive(SM) has surveyed the public to determine how many are overweight and underweight, as well as to track their seatbelt use and smoking behavior. This year The Harris Poll®, conducted between January 16 and 21 via telephone with a nationwide cross-section of 1,011 adults (18+), proved once again that the biggest obstacle Americans face when managing their health is managing their weight. More specifically, the poll found:
<br /><br />Among people over 25 (the population for which the Metropolitan Life tables were developed) 80% of the public are overweight, up from 58% in 1983, 64% in 1990 and 71% in 1995. 
<br />Fully 33% are now twenty percent overweight, a reasonable measure of obesity, compared to 15% in 1983, 16% in 1990, and 22% in 1995. In other words, obesity has more than doubled from less than one-sixth of the population eighteen years ago to one-third today. 
<br />While the proportion of adults who smoke cigarettes is down to 23% in this survey, this is a decline of only seven points (from 30%) since 1983, and of three points (from 26%) since 1990. Indeed, all the modest changes in the smoking rate, as Harris Interactive has measured it over the last few years, are within the possible sampling error for this survey. So if there has been any reduction in the smoking rate over the last decade, it has been extremely modest. 
<br />81% of all adults say that they now wear seatbelts when in the front seat of a car. This is a huge increase over the 19% who said this in 1983, the 65% in 1990 and the 73% in 1995. This is perhaps the biggest single success story on public health over the last twenty years. One reason for this huge change was the laws passed in the 1980s by states to mandate seat belt use. It's a powerful example of how legislation, even when weakly enforced as it is in most states, can change both attitudes and behavior very dramatically. Another reason is that - unlike smoking cessation or weight control - seat belt use requires no self-discipline, no sacrifice of gratification and no need to overcome addiction. There is gain without pain. 
<br />Success and failure in attempts to lose weight. Obesity continues to increase even though many people are trying to lose weight and a surprisingly large number claim to have been successful. 
<br />This survey found that:
<br /><br />Most people (60%) say they would like to lose weight, including 72% of those who are overweight (as well as some of those who are not). 
<br />A similar proportion of all adults (58%) say they have made a serious effort to lose weight, including 65% of those who are overweight now (and substantial numbers who are not overweight). 
<br />More than half (57%) of those who say they successfully lost weight say they have managed to stay at more or less the same weight. This represents 28% of all adults. So what? The health impact of obesity 
<br />A recent issue of Issue Focus published by Grantmakers in Health reports that: &amp;quot;According to U.S. Surgeon General David Satcher, overweight and obesity may soon cause as much preventable disease and death as cigarette smoking. The conditions are already responsible for as many as 300,000 premature deaths each year and cost the nation $117 billion in 2000 alone. 
<br />Excess Pounds, Extra Problems
<br />Obesity is associated with an increased risk for:
<br /><br />Type 2 diabetes 
<br />Hypertension 
<br />High blood cholesterol 
<br />Heart disease 
<br />Stroke 
<br />Cancer 
<br />Gallbladder diseases 
<br />Asthma 
<br />Osteoarthritis 
<br />Depression 
<br />Complications in pregnancy 
<br />Sleep apnea 
<br />While individual body weight has a complex set of causes, most researchers attribute the recent increase in obesity among both adults and children to two simple facts: We are eating more and exercising less. In the 1990s, Americans consumed more food and several hundred more calories per day than they did in the 1970s. Why? Fewer meals were eaten at home, average portion sizes grew, and the availability of convenience foods - foods that are high in fat and sugar - exploded.&amp;quot;
<br /><br />Dr. Louis Aronne, clinical associate professor of Medicine at Weill Medical College at Cornell University in New York City and one of the nation's leading obesity experts, believes that if Americans were to focus on lowering their Body Mass Index just a few points the associated health benefits would be enormous. Body mass index, or BMI, is determined by a measurement based on height and weight. It is the most frequent tool doctors use to determine a person's degree of obesity and how it correlates with other health risks.
<br /><br />We're not talking about unrealistic goals, says Dr. Aronne. If Americans were to make the effort to manage their weight using a variety of options, including better nutrition, more exercise, approved medications or even surgical approaches, we would be rewarded with significantly better health.

<br /><br />Methodology Harris Poll® was conducted by telephone within the United States between January 16-21, 2002 among a nationwide cross section of 1,011 adults. Figures for age, sex, race, education, number of adults and number of voice/telephone lines in the household were weighted where necessary to align them with their actual proportions in the population. In theory, with a probability sample of this size, one can say with 95 percent certainty that the results have a statistical precision of plus or minus 3 percentage points of what they would be if the entire adult population had been polled with complete accuracy.
