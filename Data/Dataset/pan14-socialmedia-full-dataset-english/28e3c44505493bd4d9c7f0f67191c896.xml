<br />GIRLS READ THIS lol
<br /><br />We don't care if you talk to other guys.
<br /><br />We don't care if you're friends with other guys.
<br /><br />But when you're sitting next to us, and some random guy walks into the room and you jump up and tackle him, without even introducing us, yeah, it pisses us off.
<br /><br />It doesn't help if you sit there and talk to him for ten minutes without even acknowledging the fact that we're still there.
<br /><br />We don't care if a guy calls &gt;OR TEXTS&lt; you, but at 2 in the morning we do get a little concerned.
<br /><br />Nothing is that important at 2 a.m. that it can't wait
<br />till the morning.
<br /><br />Also, when we tell you you're pretty/ beautiful/ gorgeous/
<br />cute/ stunning, we freaking mean it.
<br /><br />Don't tell us we're wrong.
<br /><br />We'll stop trying to convince you.
<br /><br />The sexiest thing about a girl is confidence.
<br />Yeah, you can quote me.
<br /><br />Don't be mad when we hold the door open. Take Advantage of the mood im in.
<br /><br />let us pay for you!
<br /><br />dont &quot;feel bad&quot;
<br /><br />We enjoy doing it.
<br /><br />It's expected.
<br /><br />Smile and say &quot;thank you.&quot;
<br /><br />Kiss us when no one's watching.
<br /><br />If you kiss us when you know somebody's looking, we'll be more impressed.
<br /><br />You don't have to get dressed up for us.
<br /><br />If we're going out with you in the first place, you don't have to feel the need to
<br />wear the shortest skirt you have or put on every kind of makeup you own.
<br /><br />We like you for who you are and not what you are.
<br /><br />honestly, i think a girl looks more beautiful when she's just in her pj's. or my tshirt and boxers, not all dolled up
<br /><br />Don't take everything we say seriously.
<br /><br />Sarcasm is a beautiful thing. See the beauty in it.
<br /><br />Don't get angry easily.
<br /><br />Stop using magazines/media as your bible.
<br /><br />Don't talk about how hott Chris Brown, Brad Pitt, or Jesse McCartney is in front of us.
<br /><br />It's boring, and we don't care. You have girlfriends for that.
<br /><br />Also, a very important note. WE DON'T WANT TO HEAR ALL ABOUT YOUR EXs
<br /><br />On the first couple of dates, ok, but if we're having a moment DON'T put another guy in my head. WTF
<br /><br />Whatever happened to the word &quot;handsome&quot;/&quot;beautiful&quot;
<br /><br />I'd be utterly stunned by a girl who greeted me
<br />with &quot;Hey handsome!&quot; instead of &quot;Hey baby/ stud/ cutie/ sexy&quot; or whatever else you can think of.
<br /><br />on the other hand im not sayin i woulndnt like it ether ; )
<br /><br />Girls, I cannot stress this enough: if you aren't being treated right by a guy, dont wait for him to change. ditch his sorry ass, disgrace to the male population and find someone who will treat you with utter respect
<br /><br />Someone who will honor your morals.
<br /><br />Someone who will make you smile when you're at your lowest.
<br /><br />Someone who will care for you even when you make mistakes.
<br /><br />Someone who will love you, no matter how bad you make them feel.
<br /><br />Someone who will stop what they're doing just to look you in the eyes....and say &quot;i love you&quot; ..and actually mean it.
<br /><br />Give the nice guys a chance
<br /><br />Every Guy who isn't a jerk will agree with this, so repost this.
<br /><br />*Holdin Hands
<br />Girls :If you want to hold his hand, gently bump into it a couple of
<br />times.
<br />Guys : Grab it if it happens more than once.
<br /><br />*Cuddling
<br />Girls : When you want to cuddle with him, tell him you're cold
<br />Guys : Automatically move closer to her.
<br /><br />*Movies
<br />Girls : During a movie, if he puts his arm around you, tilt your head on his shoulder
<br />Guys : Lift her chin up and kiss her.
<br /><br />*Loving each other
<br />Guys : When she tells you she loves you, look deep into her eyes, give her a peck on the lips, and tell her you love her
<br />too... And mean it.
<br /><br />*Laying below the stars
<br />Girls : When you're both laying under the stars, put your head on his chest and close your eyes as you listen to his steady heart beat
<br />Guys : Whisper in her ear and link your hands with hers.

<br />(oh yeah..you're not &quot;popular&quot; if you've slept with more than 5 guys..you're a HOE)
<br /><br />--&quot;Hey, are you busy?&quot; or &quot;Are you doing something?&quot; ~ two phrases guys open with to stop from stammering on the phone.
<br /><br />--Guys may be flirting around all day but before they go to sleep, they always think about the girl they truly care about.
<br /><br />--Before they call, guys try to plan out a little about what they're gonna say so there aren't awkward pauses, but once he's on the phone he forgets it all and makes it up as he goes.
<br /><br />--Guys go crazy over a girl's smile.
<br /><br />--Guys will do anything just to get you to notice him.
<br /><br />--Guys hate it when you talk about your ex-boyfriend or ex love-interest. Unless they're goin for the let-her-complain-to-you-and-then-have-her-realize-- - - - - ho
<br />w-wonderful-and-nice-you-a
<br />re
<br />method.
<br /><br />--A guy who likes you wants to be the only guy you talk to.
<br /><br />--Boyfriends need to be reassured often that they're still loved.
<br /><br />--Don't talk about your guy friends to your boyfriend.
<br /><br />--Guys get jealous easily.
<br /><br />--Guys are more emotional than they'd like people to think.
<br /><br />--Giving a guy a hanging message like &quot;You know what?!..uh...nevermind..&quot; would make him jump to a conclusion that is far from what you are thinking. And he'll assume he did something wrong and he'll obsess about it trying to figure it out.
<br /><br />--Guys are good flatterers when courting but they usually stammer when they talk to a girl they really like.
<br /><br />--Guys hate asking parents for money to buy girls presents. So they come up with ideas like saving their lunch money for a week. But it never works because guys are always hungry so they end up asking the parents for money anyway.
<br /><br />--Girls are guys' weaknesses.
<br /><br />--Guys are very open about themselves.
<br /><br />--It's good to test a guy first before you trust him. But don't let him wait too long.
<br /><br />--Your best friend, whom your boyfriend seeks help from about his problems with you may end up being admired by your boyfriend.
<br /><br />--If a guy tells you about his problems, he just needs someone to listen to him. You don't need to give advice.
<br /><br />--A usual act that proves that the guy likes you is when he teases you.
<br /><br />--Guys love you more than you love them if they are serious in your relationships.
<br /><br />--Guys will brag about anything.
<br /><br />--Guys use words like hot or cute to describe girls. We rarely use beautiful. If a guy uses that, he likes you a whole hell of a lot.
<br /><br />--Guys think WAY too much. One small thing a girl does, even if she doesn't notice it can make the guy think about it for hours, trying to figure out what it meant.
<br /><br />--Guys seek for advice from girls not other guys. Because most guys think alike, so if one guy's confused, then we're all confused.
<br /><br />--Any guy could write out a rulebook or advice book for flirting, but no guy can write out a book about relationships.
<br /><br />--Try to be as straightforward as possible.
<br /><br />--A guy has to experience rejection, because if he's too-good-never-been-busted, never been in love and hurt, he won't be mature and grown up.
<br /><br />--If the guy does something stupid in front of the girl, he will think about it for the next couple days or until the next time he spends time with the girl.
<br /><br />--No matter how much guys talk about asses and boobs, personality is key.
<br /><br />--Guys learn from experience not from the romance books that girls read and take as their basis of experience.
<br /><br />--Guys worry about the thin line between being compassionate and being whipped.
<br /><br />--If a guy looks unusually calm and laid back, he's probably faking it and is spazzing inside.
<br /><br />--When a guy says he is going crazy about the girl, he really is. Guys rarely say that.
<br /><br />--When a guy asks you to leave him alone, he's just actually saying, &quot;Please come and listen to me.&quot;
<br /><br />--Guys don't really have final decisions.
<br /><br />--If a guy starts to talk seriously, listen to him. It doesn't happen that often, so when it does, you know something's up.
<br /><br />--If your best guy friend seems to avoid you or is never around when you're with your boyfriend, he's probably jealous and likes you.
<br /><br />--When a guy tells you that you are beautiful, don't say you aren't. It makes them want to stop telling you because they don't want you to disagree with them.
<br /><br />--When a guy looks at you for longer than a second, he's definitely thinking something.
<br /><br />--Guys like femininity not feebleness.
<br /><br />--Guys don't like girls who punch harder than they do.
<br /><br />--A guy has more problems than you can see with your naked eyes.
<br /><br />--Don't be a snob. Guys can be intimidated and give up easily.
<br /><br />--Everything in moderation. Put on makeup, wear perfume. Just not too much.
<br /><br />--Guys talk about girls more than girls talk about guys.
<br /><br />--Guys hate rejection, but they hate being led on even more.
<br /><br />--If you are going to reject a guy, just do it. Don't say they are like a brother or just good friends, it just hurts even more. Tell them that you aren't interested in a relationship and they will respect you.
<br /><br />--Guys really think that girls are strange and have unpredictable decisions and are MAD confusing but somehow are drawn even more to them.
<br /><br />--A guy would give his left nut to be able to read a girl's mind for a day.
<br /><br />--No guy can handle all his problems on his own. He's just too stubborn to admit it.
<br /><br />--Not all guys are assholes. Just because ONE is a jackass doesnt mean he represents ALL of us.
<br /><br />--We don't like girls who are too skinny.
<br /><br />--We love it when girls talk about there boobs.
<br /><br />--Always make sure you know what kind of stuff your getting into before making out with a guy ...like wheather it's a one time deal or not ....
<br /><br />--Believe it or not shy guys are the most easiest to talk to..it may not seem right but trust me they will start opening up like books after you just ask them questions about their lives and unoticable tell them about yours...
<br /><br />--When a guy hits your butt it means that he wants you sexually
<br /><br />--Even if they refuse it all guys are ticklish on the ribs..
<br /><br />--Guys love neck rubs and if he lets you keep doing it ..it means that he really likes you or his neck really hurts...
<br /><br />--Guys will test the waters to see how far they can get with you. Even if he doesn't intend to it will happen. Know how far it is you want to let him go and he will respect that...after you let him know a couple times.
<br /><br />--When a guy sacrifices his sleep and health just to be with you, he really likes you and wants to be with you as much as possible.
<br /><br />---Girls, if u don't repost this within 1 hr then you will lose the guy of your life
<br /><br />---Guys if you don't repost this in one hr then you will lose the girl of your life.

<br />My life got flipped, turned upside down,
<br />And I’d like to take a minute, just sit right there,
<br />I’ll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel Air. 
<br /><br />In West Philadelphia, born and raised
<br />On the playground is where I spent most of my days.
<br />Chillin’ out, maxin’, relaxin all cool,
<br />And all shootin’ some b-ball outside of the school. 
<br /><br />When a couple of guys who were up to no good,
<br />Started makin’ trouble in my neighborhood.
<br />I got in one little fight and my mom got scared,
<br />And said You’re movin’ with your auntie and uncle in Bel Air. 
<br /><br />I begged and pleaded with her the other day
<br />But she packed my suitcase and sent me on my way
<br />She gave me a kiss and she gave me my ticket
<br />I put my walkman on and said I might as well kick it 
<br /><br />First class, yo this is bad,
<br />Drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass
<br />Is this what the people of Bel-Air livin' like,
<br />Hmm this might be alright! 
<br /><br />But wait I hear the prissy, bushwa and all that
<br />Is this the kind of place that they just send this cool cat?
<br />I don't think so.  I'll see when I get there.
<br />I hope they're prepared for the Prince of Bel-Air!
<br /><br />The plane landed and when I came out
<br />There was a dude,looked like a cop,
<br />standin there with my name out
<br />I ain't tryin to get arrested yet I just got here
<br />I sprang with the quickness and like lightening disappeared 
<br /><br />Well, I whistled for a cab, and when it came near,
<br />The license plate said fresh and it had dice in the mirror.
<br />If anything I could say that this cat was rare,
<br />But I thought Nah forget it, &quot;Yo home to Bel Air.&quot; 
<br /><br />I pulled up to the house about seven or eight,
<br />and I yelled to the cabby &quot;Yo homes, smell ya later.&quot;
<br />Looked at my kingdom, I was finally there,
<br />To fill my throne as the Prince of Bel Air.
