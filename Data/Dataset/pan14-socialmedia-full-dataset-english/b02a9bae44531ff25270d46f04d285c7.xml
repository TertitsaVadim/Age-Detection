<br /><br />Looking to capitalize on the great market prices and own a piece Minnesota Real Estate, but can’t figure out where to begin with your new home search?  Want to figure out how to locate the best agent for your needs?
<br /><br />There are some very important first steps that need to be taken before you locate the perfect agent for your new Minnesota home. It is always good to start your new home search on your online and surfing the Internet can help you get an idea of what real estate is available. Try using these quick search terms to help you get started in the right direction:
<br />Minnesota Real Estate for Sale
<br />Minnesota Homes for Sale
<br />Minnesota Bank-Owned Homes
<br /><br />…you get the idea…
<br /><br />Such research can also refine your sense of how much house you can afford, potentially expand your horizons regarding livable neighborhoods, and wise you up to what all the advertising hype really means -- or disguises.  Somewhere out there is a seller who wants to sell a home as badly as you want to buy one. This means you can count on homes being advertised in at least a few places. Here are the best ways to get up-to-date information:
<br /><br />View online listings. The vast majority of home buyers now use the Web as part of their search. Many websites draw from a central database known as the multiple listing service (MLS). Each site's presentation and ease of use is different, so you'll want to check around for the ones that suit your needs the best. 
<br /><br />If you're looking for a newly built home, check out <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.americanhomeguides.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.americanhomeguides.com</a>. If you're focused on a particular neighborhood, find out whether that neighborhood has a community newspaper with real estate listings, or search the Internet for Real Estate in that particular Zip code. Many newspapers also post their classified sections online. When you see a home that interests you, either make an appointment with your Minnesota real estate agent to see it, or check whether an open house has been scheduled. Always remember, an agent is here to help you locate your perfect home!

<br /><br />Trying to find ways to make your Minnesota Real Estate property more energy efficient?  Here are some great tips and ideas to help you reduce energy costs throughout each room in your new home! By starting out with some basic things you can do as a Minnesota homeowner, you can save money any season of the year. 
<br /><br />The kitchen is a great place to start, specifically the refrigerator.  Always make sure the door closes!  Making sure the magnetic door seals tightly will add up in the end.  Also making sure the on/off switch works properly by checking it once a month. This will get rid of some of the guess work of operation.  Another helpful tip with the refrigerator that people don't realize, is to vacuum the refrigerator condenser coil frequently.  The condenser coil should be cleaned once per year, or if you have a pet with long hair, it is probably a good idea to clean it every 6 months. This can be found either running from the back to front of your appliance or on the bottom. Another tip to help keep your kitchen more energy efficient is to only run full loads in your dishwasher.  This will not only save energy, but save on your water bill…a double bonus!
<br /><br />In your laundry and bathroom areas, the first basic tip is to make sure the hot-water heater thermostat is set no higher than 150 degrees Fahrenheit.  Insulate all hot water pipes and seal all leaking taps.  When doing laundry, never overload the dryer.  This will only make it work twice as hard using twice as much energy and will take even longer for the clothes to dry.  And never forget to clean out the dryer lint filter after each load (also a fire prevention tip)!
<br /><br />Tips for your living area including bedrooms are also very simple.  Make sure that you have ceiling insulation properly installed throughout the house.  This is something that can be researched during your home inspection.  Whether at home or not, keep curtains closed to prevent heat loss in winter and overheating in summer, and always close off unheated areas.  Clean your heating filter regularly to make sure you get the most of your money in the winter months!  There have been several reports about the use of high-efficiency fluorescent lighting in all areas where appropriate.  They may be more expensive up front, but can save up to 80 percent in costs in the long run.
<br /><br />Following these tips will help make your new Minnesota Real Estate property more energy efficient no matter what the season!  Let me know if you have any questions regarding saving money through energy efficiency or about Minnesota Real Estate.

<br /><br />Planning on finally moving out of apartment living and into your first home?  Now is the perfect opportunity to take advantage of both low home prices and historically low interest rates! Here are some great tips and advice to make that transition as smooth as possible!
<br /><br />The first piece of advice I can offer is to make lists-lists of everything.  You will find having notebooks full of lists and information to refer to will make the whole process that much easier.  Write everything down, starting with all the furniture you will be taking with you into your new Minnesota home.  I find it very helpful to make sure any cleaning, painting, or repairing of any furniture is done before you load it into the moving truck and place it in your home.  If you have anything that needs a slight repair or perhaps a dresser you would like to give a new coat of paint to, take care of it before you move.  I also suggest cleaning any mattresses and rugs you will be taking.  A vacuum with carpet cleaner attachments always comes in handy to get this job done!  Also, make sure all laundry gets done before the move.  Nothing like walking into your new clean laundry room for the first time without any clothes to wash!
<br /><br />Move all of the big items first, then any smaller decorative items that you may have.  It is a great idea to organize and move room by room so you keep everything together.  After placing the larger furniture items, you may want to make some changes.  What may have looked good in a room at an apartment may look differently in your house.  This is your chance to decorate all over again, so take advantage of it!
<br /><br />If you don't want to pay any money to buy boxes, certain stores will give them out before they get recycled, such as grocery stores and big box retailers. Another great idea is to buy large plastic tubs or bins that you can reuse for storage in your first home!  Use laundry baskets to move clothes, that way when everything gets put away that you packed into them, they are ready for their place in their new home!
<br /><br />Something that always gets overlooked in your move is writing down a list of all the places you'll need to change your address. Make sure you change it at the post office at least twice.  Doing it more then once will give you backup confidence that it will be taken care of, as the forwarding service does expire!
<br /><br />Moving into your home as a first time home buyer is one of the most exciting things you can do!  Make sure that you enjoy the process even through all of the stress that can happen during a move.  Talk to your agent about any advice, or tips they may have to help you get settled as smoothly as possible!
<br /><br />As always, please don’t hesitate to contact me if you have any questions!

<br /><br />How many of you out there are thinking now is the perfect time to buy your very first home?  Well, you are probably right, but there are a lot of other first time homebuyers out there thinking the same thing.  Here are some tips so you don't get discouraged while you are out in the great State of Minnesota hunting for your next dream house!
<br /><br />Before you start attending all of the open houses, have some idea of what you can afford and how much of a down payment you can come up with. It is always a good idea to get pre-approved with a lending institution, so you will be ready to take advantage of a great at a moment’s notice!
<br />There many types of first time home buyer grants in Minnesota, so it definitely is worth looking into to see if you qualify. One type is Government Grants for first time home buyers. They have no seller conditions or contribution requirements. The only requirement to satisfy government assistance housing guidelines is that your family income must meet the stipulated minimum, which varies according to the number of your dependents and the median income for the area in which you intend to purchase.  Now remember, the higher the income the greater number of dependents will be needed to qualify.  The good thing about the median income is that is varies by area so there may be several different programs available - especially in the greater metropolitan areas of Minnesota!  These are government down payment programs based on a yearly budget, which means if they are not used, they will lose the funding the following year, so they want to give you money!
<br /><br />Although the number one qualifying factor for this type of loan is income, here are a few other qualifying areas to know about before you get started:
<br /><br />-You must meet the median income requirements established in your local area.
<br />-Must be a first time home buyer.  This is the only way to be approved for this government grant as a first time home buyer!
<br /><br />Some other good advice I can offer while you are out there looking for your first home in the great State of Minnesota is to not to let the game of bidding wars discourage you!  There are a lot of homes out there in foreclosure right now, which makes this a great time for not only all of you first time home buyers in Minnesota, but those of you that may be interested in acquiring a second property.  You and your Realtor may find the perfect house and get your bid in immediately, but there may be others bidding for the same property. Stay out there and keep looking even if you don’t close on the first home you make an offer for. Working with the right Realtor will help keep you informed about exactly what is going on in the Minnesota home buyers market and feel confident that your new home is right around the corner!
<br /><br />Wishing you the best of luck in the search for your next home!

<br /><br />There has never been a better time to buy a home in Minnesota, and great deals can be had on HUD owned homes. 
<br /><br />But first, what exactly is a Minnesota HUD Home?
<br />A Minnesota HUD home is a 1 to 4 unit residential property located in the state of Minnesota that has been acquired by the United States Government’s Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) as a result of a foreclosure action on an FHA-insured mortgage. HUD becomes the property owner and offers it for sale in Minnesota to recover the loss on the foreclosure claim.
<br /><br />Who can buy a HUD Home in Minnesota?
<br />YOU CAN!  If you have the cash or can qualify for a loan (subject to certain restrictions) you may buy a HUD Home in Minnesota. HUD Homes are first offered to people who are buying the home as their primary residence (owner occupants). Following this priority period for owner occupants, unsold properties are then made available to all buyers, including investors.
<br /><br />How are Minnesota HUD Homes sold?
<br />All properties available for purchase by the Minnesota public are offered for sale at Internet listing sites maintained by management companies under contract to HUD. Any Minnesota real estate broker registered with HUD may submit an offer and contract to purchase on your behalf. HUD pays the real estate broker's commission, if included in the contract.
<br /><br />Are there any special programs offered to buyers of Minnesota HUD Homes?
<br />Properties in designated areas of Minnesota are available at a reduced sales price to law enforcement officers, teachers, firefighters, emergency medical technicians, nonprofits and local governments. Please contact my office for additional details.
<br /><br />Should I get a home inspection for my new HUD Home in Minnesota?
<br />We encourage you to get an inspection after your offer is accepted. All HUD Homes are sold AS-IS, without warranty. HUD will not make repairs nor pay to correct any problems.  Remember, it is always better to be safe than sorry when it comes to buying your next home.
<br /><br />What if I need to finance my new HUD Home?
<br />Although HUD does not offer financing directly, some of our homes qualify for FHA-insured loans. I encourage all Minnesota Home Buyers to shop around for a lender to find the best loan terms, or use the services of a qualified Mortgage Broker.
