I will do more on audio soon but sending the audio to my receiver (Onkyo 905) sounded great just as I expected. It also sounded good the few minutes I had the 95FD doing it. I am not going to say which is better because I do not want to open that can of worms again. So do not ask here. PM me.<br /><br />I am using the new Sony VPL- VW60 &quot;Black Pearl&quot; (which is the 3rd pic) for all of my comparison so far. It handles 1080p/23.98 like a champ. I can also send it straight into my crystalio II and then tweak the image before sending it to the VW60 in 1080p/23.98. The Pioneer 95FD gets along with all of my other components which I do not take for granted these days.<br /><br />And yes I am making reference to the XA2 and A35 which are stubborn when it comes to sending 1080p/24 to some displays. In direct comparison to the 94HD the 95FD is obviously a more flexible unit with a little quicker load times. Being able to pass HBR audio directly to the receiver for decoding is a really cool feature. Especially if you purchased one of the newer ones that can decode it. The picture Q is very close. I keep going back and forth. Going straight to my pj it does look like the 95FD is just a little more sharper but their brilliant colors are nearly identical. I will say the home media gallery looks more refined on the 95FD. I have never really got into that feature before but now I am intrigued so I may just jump in!<br /><br />Bottom line is if you have the 94HD and do not care about the bitstream audio feature then there is absolutely no reason to dump it for the 95FD. However, if you do not and are interested in getting the best Blu ray unit in terms of features and pic/sound Q then look no further than the 95FD! I hate to keep picking the new Pioneer units as my favorite Blu ray unit but honestly the other companies are still two steps behind. The 95FD is the starter in my set up. More to come (SD DVD versus the A35 and XA2 and even 1400) as well as a few more thoughts on audio...BTW, Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer (BR) is looking and sounding awesome on this unit! Pick up a copy!<br /><br />Well, I am pleasantly surprised to post that the 95FD has excellent upconversion. Much better than the 94HD and HD1. I even put it through the HQV Blu ray benchmark tests and it handled them very good. Especially my favorite stadium torture test! And as tradition lately it even made my adult videos look great! Customers have reported that they are using the bulbs as outdoor floodlights.<br /><br />Depending on your specific lighting needs, there are a growing number of good warm white LED light bulbs coming on the market, so we encourage you to take a look at the full range of LED light bulbs available, paying close attention to product details and customer reviews.<br /><br />If you require a lot of  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.easternlighting.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.easternlighting.com</a>  you may visit us at  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.easternlighting.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.easternlighting.com</a>

There isn't a different lighting resolution in the marketplace that delivers the consistency the  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.easternlighting.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.easternlighting.com</a>  give, and obtaining that consistency is crucial in retail as you might want to know that you simply will not be dealing with flickering or unintentional dimming when a higher profile shopper walks via the door.<br /><br />These LED lighting remedies can also be extremely eco-friendly. They utilize a low level of power usage in spite of their large output and substantial intensity mild. Considering they are so power effective LED tube lighting also mainly utilize their electricity for light production and won't produce unpleasant heat.<br /><br />So why will be the LuxBrilliant MXII LED lighting resolution superior towards the MX or Pro series? Both the MX and Pro sequence give plenty of of the same benefits- they are energy effective, they produce high quality constant mild, and they are environmentally friendly. While all 3 of these are tremendous selections and infinitely superior to the normal choices, the LuxBrilliant versions wins out because it gives all the above better than its competitors. In addition, it delivers a stronger, clearer and even more constant mild (and is also available in a number of several colours), it can be much more energy effective and generates the lowest achievable warmth outlet, and they're tremendously versatile (aluminum extrustion profile could be produced to distinct size needs), able to meet most display case and merchandise preparations. MXII model is among the brightest (about 650-680 lumens for white mild for each foot), one of the most potent (about 13W for each foot) of its class.<br /><br />You won't go incorrect picking any LED display situation lighting answer more than fluorescents or filament primarily based bulbs, however the LuxBrilliant MXII display situation lighting solution blows them all out from the drinking water.<br /><br />Proper shop lighting can draw in additional shoppers to any establishment, support sell extra product, and reinforce a store's image. A great many designers argue that essentially the most imperative ingredient of the store's design might be its lighting. Regrettably, lighting is commonly by far the most neglected component of store design.<br /><br />When picking out the lighting for just about any shop or show cases, here are a few tips to bear in mind.<br /><br />Ceiling Peak: The peak of the store's ceiling is one of the most significant components that goes right into a strategy for lighting a jewelry store in this kind of a way the merchandise appears spectacular. Since the supply of light moves farther away through the merchandise the power and intensity in the gentle diminishes. Shops with greater ceilings (above 9') experience some difficulties with lighting. Shops with ceiling that are taller both must use more lights that are spaced nearer together to illuminate a showcase or convey the light supply nearer by dropping down a monitor or employing a pendant.<br /><br />Colour: The colour of light is measure in Kelvin (temperature). The greater the temperature (Kelvin) reading the cooler the color of light and also the decrease the temperature the hotter the color. For instance a light that is 3000K could be a warmer color as well as a mild which is 4000K could be a cooler gentle. Since the temperature of gentle will get as well higher (over 4200K) the colour from the gentle starts to tackle a blue good quality. Lights that are inside the 5500K to 6500K will look &quot;blue&quot; to the eye.<br />To find out alot more about led showcase lighting check my site at <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.easternlighting.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.easternlighting.com</a>

If merchandise is moved from case to case or showcases are moved track lighting provides the store owner with the most options.<br /><br />Recessed: This provides the sleekest look. The limitations are that the store owner will be limited in their ability to add or decrease light as well as limitations with moving merchandise and showcases around inside of the store. Once a recessed light is installed the cost to add or take away lighting becomes a large expense as electricians are required to remove/move lighting as well as the issues involved with repairing the holes in the ceiling where the recessed fixture was installed.<br /><br />Pendants: Pendants are a great way to bring a light source closer to the showcases where the ceilings are high and the store owners do not want to spend the money required to add additional lights to compensate for high ceilings.<br /><br />Inside of Showcase Lighting: Having lighting inside of a showcase can really add sparkle and glitter to your jewelry. The best lighting for inside a case is LED. Be careful though when choosing the LED to make sure that the color of the light is not blue (5500K = color range). While most retail owners understand the many benefits of LED lights when it comes to illuminating their jewelry, most have a difficult time deciding between utilizing SMD or 1W High Power LED. Let's take a look at which of these will provide you and your store with an optimal lighting condition.<br /><br />For those who don't know, we're going to take a quick minute to explain the importance of making sure you have the absolute best lighting for your jewelry. Every piece of retail merchandise benefits from the right lighting, which is why every different retail store utilizes its own individual lighting scheme. Some do better with dark spaces that are sparsely lit, others do better with soft mood lighting, while some (like big box stores) prefer to use an almost industrial-grade lighting solution. Jewelry stores need to utilize lighting solutions that will bring out every facet, every cut, and all the brilliance out of their gems and jewels. Anyone who has held a piece of jewelry up to the light and rotated it until it hit the right angle and just exploded with life understands intrinsically the importance of great lighting for jewelry.<br /><br />LED lights provide the right brightness and the versatility needed to really make your jewelry display case pop. Of course aesthetics aren't the only concern to take into consideration when choosing your light solution, and LED lights provide a wide variety of benefits to make them an even better option. Lower costs of SMDs make LED display case lighting more affordable than High Power LED tube.<br /><br />When you begin to move beyond simple background information and facts, you begin to realize that there's additional to  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.easternlighting.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.easternlighting.com</a>  you could have initially believed.

Not only does this make it easier to fit them into aquariums of different sizes, but it ensures that you do not endanger fish that need to be kept within a very strict temperature range. Many fish can be highly sensitive to lights that put out significant heat, but LEDs are designed to create exceptionally minimal temperature change, making LED aquarium lights even more ideal for exotic and sensitive sea creatures.<br /><br />A beautiful aquarium is a decorative feature that is unlike any other. Fish are wonderful pets, and many exotic fish are simply a true wonder to behold. Whether you have common or exotic fish and whether you have a saltwater or freshwater tank, you will find that the right lighting can change the entire look and feel of your aquarium. If you want a tank that draws the eye of everyone who walks into your home or business and that creates a calming, pleasant atmosphere, LED aquarium lights are certainly the right choice for you.<br /><br />The bottom line is that your aquarium requires a great deal of time, hard work, and effort on its own. Your aquarium lighting shouldn't also require tons of maintenance and added expenses. LED lights are exceptionally low maintenance, and they are quite eco-friendly as well. With LEDs, operating costs are quite minimal, helping you to save money and even conserve fossil fuels; all while making your aquarium a more stylish place for your fish to live. If creating the perfect room in your home or business hinges on finding the right layout and style for your fish tank, it is certainly time that you start to consider the benefits that LED aquarium lights have to offer in terms of design, style, and aesthetic appeal.<br /><br />Proper illumination in your jewelry store display case is an important tool to increase your sales potential. The great way to display jewelry effectively is to watch the colors of the spectrum radiating through it. The long life LED showcase lights not only save electric bill compared to the conventional tubes, but also have jewelry come to life with spectacular brilliance. In addition to that advantage, the LED display case lighting usually operates at a low temperature that produces very little heat that does not age jewelry, it has the intensity to create the greatest visual appeal with refraction and sparkle.<br /><br />Jewelry does not give out light, it reflects light. Spectrum produced by the reflective qualities of LED light is a revolutionary discovery in the industry. ECL is one of the companies specialized in designing and manufacturing professional high quality and affordable LED presentation lighting which can last up to 40,000 hours. The color temperature ranges would be: Cool White color of 7,000-8,000K, Pure White color at 5,500K, or Warm White at 3,500K. The length of the tube light can be custom-made by the customer's specific needs.<br /><br />ECL customized display case aluminum extrusion were created with effective, patented thermal heat sink design system, with 12v dc power-driven in 2007. Lower costs of SMDs make LED display case lighting more affordable than High Power LED tube.<br /><br />Once you begin to move beyond fundamental background information, you begin to understand that there's a lot more to  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.easternlighting.com%2Fled-showcase-lighting%2Fflb-led-tubes"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.easternlighting.com/led-showcase-lighting/flb-led-tubes</a>  you may have 1st believed.

The following report includes some fascinating information about led par 38--info you can use, not just the old stuff they used to tell you. <br /><br />Quality lighting is important in every facet of our lives. Whatever type of fish enclosure you have, you likely understand that its appeal can be greatly enhanced or diminished depending on the quality of the lighting that you use. If the options at your local aquarium store just aren't giving you what you need, it is time to consider LED aquarium lights. Versatile, eco-friendly, and highly attractive, these lights are showing up in aquariums around the world.<br /><br />LED lighting strips can be used for aquariums of all types and sizes. They are completely waterproof, and they can provide a stunning visual effect. But they do not give out same quality of light as LEDs in terms of refraction, intensity, and color naturalism. Small jewelers are not the only businesses that benefit from ECL showcase lights. Increasing numbers of high-end retail stores and specialty chain shops are investing in LED tube lights to illuminate items of interest in their business establishments.<br /><br />LED lighting features the world's latest, most state of the art evolution in lighting technology, and may replace many forms of lighting one day with confidence. Although they are more expensive than fluorescent, halogen, xenon and other types of lights, LEDs' cool operating temperature produces luminosity level equal or close to conventional types of lights, and simultaneously keeping electric consumption at a minimized level. Their exceptionally long lifespan delivers long-run profitable returns on initial investment by minimizing maintaining costs, and the versatility of color spectrum they give can add special effects to the valued items on the showcase shelf.<br /><br />Proper store lighting can attract more customers to any establishment, help sell more product, and strengthen a store's image. Many designers argue that the most important element of a store's design may be its lighting. Unfortunately, lighting is often the most neglected component of store design.<br /><br />When choosing the lighting for any store or display cases, here are a few ideas to keep in mind.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;Ceiling Height&lt;/b&gt;: The height of a store's ceiling is one of the most important factors that goes into a plan for lighting a jewelry store in such a way that the merchandise looks spectacular. As the source of light moves farther away from the merchandise the power and intensity of the light diminishes. Stores with higher ceilings (over 9') face some challenges with lighting.

The following report includes some fascinating information about led showcase lighting--info you can use, not just the old stuff they used to tell you. <br /><br />Let's pretend for a second that you are standing by the curb when you witness this breezy, stylish ride pull up in front. You take a glance at the center of the trunk to get a closer look at the make and model name. You're having trouble seeing it though, despite the fact it is not completely dark out yet. Before the driver turns the lights off and shuts down the engine, it quickly dawns on you: the tail lights are positively consuming.<br /><br />Once a feature of European and upscale domestic models, LED and Euro tail lights (or taillights) have fast become a modifying staple for many different types of drivers. While these upgrades aren't exactly &quot;new&quot;, they have, however, picked up considerable steam as of late. Some point to the speedy nature in which they can be installed, as more and more car owners have grown tired of long-term customizing projects. Others talk about the vividly contrasted luminance that upgraded tail lights often display, especially in comparison with original factory designs. But as with anything else custom-related, it all comes down to personal choice. And if one thing has risen out of all this, it is that custom tail lights are a relentlessly compelling aftermarket addition that benefits vehicles in more ways than one.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;Why Custom Tail Lights?&lt;/b&gt;<br /><br />The easy answer is &quot;why not?&quot; Of course, all drivers need to be armed with as much background information as possible, so it is best to look at custom tail lights with a bit more depth. Since the birth of the contemporary automobile, creative-thinking drivers have been finding ways to outdo the factory's presentation of rear lighting. They'd visit salvage yards to mix and match pieces, weld together home-made bezels, or even use the casings from bicycle reflectors to construct their own fixtures. Though times have evolved, the spirit remains. You give a driver who loves their ride enough time, and they'll find something to improve upon. Tail lights are almost inevitably at the top of that list.<br /><br />Taillights are oft noticed identifiers. You are always in contact with them; you just might not recognize such unless a vehicle in front of you at a red light is sporting a brazen pair of LED taillights that are glimmering directly towards your retinas. But taillights are frequently intertwined with your ride, whether you realize it or not. It is for that very reason why so many choose a set that better represents their own interpretation of what automotive artistic value is all about.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;LED Tail Lights - Tech Style, Tech Quality&lt;/b&gt;<br /><br />Even in 2008, Light Emitting Diode technology is still considered advanced, and that's not by mistake. This does not come as a surprise after all - when the desired impact in the minds of customers is best created with LED lights, why should these individuals go in for any other kind of lighting?<br /><br />Once you start to move beyond fundamental background data, you begin to notice that there is even more to <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5lYXN0ZXJubGlnaHRpbmcuY29tL2xlZC1zaG93Y2FzZS1saWdodGluZy9mbGItbGVkLXR1YmVz" target="_blank">led showcase lighting</a> you may have initially thought.

MR16 bulbs operating at mains have GU10 fittings, and are rather called GU10 spotlights.<br /><br />To be able to understand and value the useful features of the LED replacements, we must look at the halogen MR16 lights in short. The halogen MR16 bulb has a reflecting surface: the internal part of the bulb is made of pressed glass or aluminium in cheaper versions. The glass surface is constantly under pressure, which makes it easy to explode. The reflecting surface controls both the direction and the spread of the light, intensifying the light of the bulb. The bulb is available with various beam angles of light from narrow degrees of 10 to 60, however, the most frequently used spotlight is around 45 - 60 degrees. The colour temperature of the halogen MR16 is very warm, yellowish light, and is easily altered with dimming.<br /><br />The main disadvantages of the halogen MR16 light is that they have a low conversion rate of power, turning most of it to heat instead of light. Therefore, they have a high power consumption along with very much heat emitted, dangerous not only to touch but also to be placed near textiles or wood during operation. Halogen bulbs are sources of fire hazard in any home, and should be fitted and operated with care. The halogen MR16 bulb emits a considerable amount of ultraviolet light dangerous to human health, and is also sensitive to shakes and shock. Both these problems are partially solved with a glass cover that filters most of the ultraviolet light and functions as an explosion shield.<br /><br />LED MR16 spotlights, on the other hand, do not suffer from the majority of the above disadvantages. Although, LED lights do not have the reflective inner surface, they are called MR spots because they are replacements of the original reflectors. Beam angle, which is similarly varied with LED lights too, is usually controlled within the optics of the diode. Colour temperature is much more varied compared to halogen lights. Cooler white colour temperatures can be closer to natural light, and do not colour the room yellowish. At the same time, coloured versions of MR16 lights are available in LEDs.<br /><br />LED lights in general have the advantages of cool running, eco-friendly design, long lifespan (usually around 30 000 - 50 000 hours), and high power LEDs can operate even 24/7. LEDs are not sensitive to shakes or shocks, and operate at low temperature too. The most obvious advantage of LEDs is their extremely low consumption of power. Since LEDs convert 90% of power to light, they emit substantially less heat, and mean no or very little fire hazard in homes. LED lights are also available with GU5.3 for low voltage and GU10 for mains fittings.<br /><br />For LEDs operating at low voltage, the operating power supply has a major significance. Likewise, you can create a highly dramatic look by bouncing LED light onto materials such as enamel, steel and granite all of which tend to be commonly found in kitchens.<br /><br />Now might be a good time to write down the main points covered above.

Don't let that happen: keep reading.<br /><br />1st of September 2010 marked the last day of 75W incandescent light bulbs within the European Union. This is the second phase-out rule in a series of energy saving regulations made by the EU in 2008, within which they intend to get rid of all conventional incandescent light bulbs (invented by Edison) and inefficient halogen lights until 2016. This series of phase-outs, phrased and criticised at the same time by many, eventually open a market to a widening range of energy saving lights. Since the ruling basically sets a minimum standard for energy efficiency and functionality, there will be plenty of halogens remaining on the market - class A and B are not planned to be banned within this regulation.<br /><br />The entire range of regulations is under the heading of Eco-Design Directive, aiming to save at least 10-15% of household electricity accumulating on a national level, as well as reducing carbon-dioxide emission.<br /><br />Here is the list of regulations and their deadlines in the EU:<br /><br />1 September 2009<br />&lt;br&gt;100W or above incandescent light bulbs<br />&lt;br&gt;Non-clear (frosted / pearl) lamps must be minimum A-class<br />&lt;br&gt;1 September 2010<br />&lt;br&gt;75W clear incandescent lamps<br />&lt;br&gt;1 September 2011<br />&lt;br&gt;60W clear incandescent lamps<br />&lt;br&gt;1 September 2012<br />&lt;br&gt;All remaining clear incandescent lamps (40W and 25W)<br />&lt;br&gt;1 September 2016<br />&lt;br&gt;Phase out of C-class retrofit halogen lamps<br /><br />The price issue<br />&lt;br&gt;Among the many, there are two major arguments against the regulation. The first one is evidently about the price of the new energy-solving solutions. Simply put, there is a huge price difference between traditional incandescent and energy-saving lights; though, this affects you radically only if you wish to replace all your lights at once. Although all energy-saving lights require a certain amount of investment, depending on the light you choose they relatively quickly pay it back to you by the money saved on your lighting bill. Opponents of the regulation usually argue that even the cheapest energy-saving light costs four times as much as an incandescent, but usually even more. Like mentioned before, the energy saved with these lights return the investments quickly, but on the long run - especially with LED lights, the energy saving bulbs return the investment with the length of their lifespan too. Even the lowest quality LED light has the lifespan of 30 000 hours, while an incandescent has only 1000 at its best.<br /><br />The health issue<br />&lt;br&gt;The other, less evident, but also serious issue is the health problems caused by CFL lights to those sensitive to its flickering output. Fluorescent forms of energy-saving lighting are often criticized for causing migraines, eye problems and skin rashes, but they are also harmful for those suffering from epilepsy or autism. If you need it to dim then you could try buying 1 as a sample to test, or you can contact the specific manufacturer who are usually very helpful.<br /><br />Take time to consider the points presented above.

Don't let that happen: keep reading.<br /><br />1st of September 2010 marked the last day of 75W incandescent light bulbs within the European Union. For starters they save tons of energy and are very friendly towards the environment. They also have been known to last through the toughest weather and also get much more life from regular batteries. The life of these units is very long in comparison to other bulbs. An mr16 is just the right size to work anywhere in the home.<br /><br />A home can save so very much energy when LED bulbs are utilized. A lot of people have mentioned how much higher the up-front cost can sometimes be when upgrading. While the cost is higher up-front, these bulbs will save large amounts of power by the time their life is through. This makes them a better investment. Using these lights are lot easier on any budget.<br /><br />The LED is smartly designed to be the utmost rugged and durable. The older bulbs come equipped with a filament that is fitted into a special tube. This explains the ease at which they burn out. Through by passing this filament design these types of products tend to last a very long time. Not to mention the fact that this type of bulb technology can withstand harsh weather or temperatures. This is why LED lights are so great outdoors.<br /><br />People should not over look the eco-friendly style of use that these lights are based on. They are a lot better for the earth than the other lights. This is due to the lack of mercury as an active ingredient. Mercury was commonly found in other house hold bulbs and is very bad on the environment. It often leaks free and wreaks havoc on the planet.<br /><br />LED lighting has a special way of extending the lives of many batteries. No wonder they are capable of saving so much money for people. If a battery operated unit is making use of these types of bulbs in favor of incandescent ones the batteries will live ten times as long. While the newer battery operated unit may cost somewhat more it will save a very large investment on batteries.<br /><br />The extremely long life cycle of these units should never be over looked. They last fifty times longer than the older style incandescent lamps. In some occasions this number reaches over one hundred times. They also last over ten times longer than the popular fluorescent bulbs. These are facts that are hard to ignore when considering LED lights.<br /><br />So many people are finding a lot of very good reasons to make the jump to LED MR16 bulbs in favor of their old choice. If you need it to dim then you could try buying 1 as a sample to test, or you can contact the specific manufacturer who are usually very helpful.<br /><br />Take time to consider the points presented above.

LEDinsider suggests that it can be used to replace any household 100-120 watt incandescent/halogen bulb, although due to the size of the bulb, you can only use in locations where a PAR38 bulb with a 4-3/4&quot; diameter will properly fit. Customers have reported that they are using the bulbs as outdoor floodlights.<br /><br />Depending on your specific lighting needs, there are a growing number of good warm white LED light bulbs coming on the market, so we encourage you to take a look at the full range of LED light bulbs available, paying close attention to product details and customer reviews.<br /><br />LED lighting is often overlooked in 'green building' literature while more expensive and less satisfactory environmental solutions are pursued. The purpose of this article is to discuss some of the benefits of LED lighting, and to argue that LED lighting should be considered an essential element of any 'green' building, house, or construction project. This pretty much summarizes most of the benefits, and there are not any environmental risks posed by LEDs. I would simply note that while other green technologies may have some difficult drawbacks to overcome that the advantages of LED lighting are fairly strait forward and clear cut.<br /><br />If there was an apparent drawback, at least from the consumer perspective, it would be the expense. An LED PAR38 12 Watt light can cost 10 times as much an incandescent light. In fact, however, the expense of LEDs is not a drawback at all. Once, energy and replacement costs are figured in the LED lights actually save money. Simply consider the cost of 24 extra replacements of the incandescent light. Then factor the extra energy use and its really not even close. We did not include that in the summer LEDs put less load on the air conditioning. Its clear the LED light ultimately saves money, but many are reluctant to purchase due to the longer term of the payback.<br /><br />So if your convinced, and you want to 'go LED' what are some of the best products? In fact there is a broad spectrum of lighting possibilities. Everything from PAR lights to recessed ceiling lights are available all at costs that payback before too long. You should also consider the source of your LEDs. The best LEDs (in this authors opinion) are produced by CREE and SSC. CREE is a US company and SSC is in Korea. The LED fixtures may be made by any manufacturer but try to verify the source of the LEDs.<br /><br />Finally, the real benefit of LEDs is that they are cool. Yes, they are not as hot as incandescent lights, but I mean they are cool. When you see the lights and what they do it is impressive. This type of bulb is ideally suitable for indoors.<br /><br />Here is a list of natural spectrum light products that are recommended by customers on usage: Verilux full spectrum heritage floor lamps, Verilux natural fullspectrum deluxe floor lamps, Happylite Mini Sunshine supplement light system, Happy light 6000 sunshine supplement light system, portable lite book elite, Verilux global cooling PAR 38 outdoor floor 23W full spectrum compact fluorescent, 15 watt full spectrum compact fluorescent, Verilux global cooling 26watt full spectrum compact fluorescent and Verilux full spectrum incandescent floor light bulb.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5lYXN0ZXJubGlnaHRpbmcuY29t" target="_blank">led par38</a>

		<document id="4b5396b78feb4824b96cbded3e972148" url=""><![CDATA[Warm White LED Light Bulbs - Which Are the Most effective?<br/><br/>Technically, the concept of color temperature is based on the relationship among the temperature and radiation emitted by a theoretical standardized material (a so-referred to as black body radiator) that has been cooled down to a state in which all molecular motion has ceased. So, just put, the color temperature is a measurement that is utilised to define the color of a light emitted by the bulb. We normally believe of the color temperature in terms of the whiteness or warmness of a light source: &quot;Warm White&quot; = 3000 Kelvin &quot;Neutral White&quot; = 3500 Kelvin &quot;Cool White&quot; = 4100 Kelvin and &quot;Daylight White&quot; = 5000 or much more Kelvin.<br /><br />LED light bulbs are obtainable with a wide range of color temperatures, but the warm white LED light bulbs that create a light comparable to a conventional incandescent light employed in common residence lighting are far more pricey for the reason that a lot more or brighter LEDs are required in the bulb. Due to the fact cool white is the natural color of LED light, it is brighter, whereas chips that emit a warm white light call for a phosphorous &quot;filter&quot; to &quot;warm&quot; the color temperature, thus minimizing the chip's brightness. So, a warm white LED bulb is an LED light bulb with a color temperature about 3000K that will create a warm light comparable to that we commonly anticipate from an ordinary household incandescent bulb.<br /><br />There are a growing quantity of LED light bulbs on the marketplace these days that are marketed as warm white bulbs. Which ones are the most effective? Below we discuss a couple of the finest we have come across for replacing typical household light bulbs.<br /><br />C. Crane describes its warm white GeoBulb as the 1st 60 watt direct replacement bulb that uses much less than 8 watts. 1 of the items we like about the GeoBulb is that it is the identical size as a conventional incandescent bulb as a result, it is appropriate for direct replacement in any indoor open fixture. In addition, it is one of the couple of bulbs that we have come across where the manufacturer has published independent lumen test data, so you can have some confidence that it will actually produce as significantly light as the manufacturer claims - one thing that, sadly, can't be said for a lot of the bulbs out there. This is a well-made item that has received typically favorable ratings from prospects. The GeoBulb is a great, eco-friendly substitute for a common A-line (or A-sort or A-shape - this is the shape of an ordinary household incandescent) light bulb. Like an ordinary household light bulb, it also has a regular (typically known as medium) E26 base.<br /><br />Lots of folks at this time are seeking for warm white PAR38 LED bulbs that are dimmable. This kind of bulb is ideally appropriate for indoors.<br /><br />Here is a list of natural spectrum light merchandise that are advised by prospects on usage: Verilux full spectrum heritage floor lamps, Verilux natural fullspectrum deluxe floor lamps, Happylite Mini Sunshine supplement light method, Pleased light 6000 sunshine supplement light program, portable lite book elite, Verilux international cooling PAR 38 outdoor floor 23W full spectrum compact fluorescent, 15 watt full spectrum compact fluorescent, Verilux international cooling 26watt full spectrum compact fluorescent and Verilux full spectrum incandescent floor light bulb.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5lYXN0ZXJubGlnaHRpbmcuY29tL2xlZC1zaG93Y2FzZS1saWdodGluZy9mbHg_" target="_blank">led par38</a>

With the constant development in LED products, they are available in brighter versions too, with a decent light output.<br /><br />Another sport related use of LED products is the illumination of sport facilities, from the smallest fitness rooms to the illumination of huge arenas. Illuminating small rooms are not much different than household applications, but many of us would be surprised to see the immense light emitted by LED reflectors in sport arenas. These panels are not the only applications within the arena though, there are various forms of LED lightings are present - including the LED scoreboards.<br /><br />For newly built stadiums LED floodlight are becoming the norm, due to their low consumption of energy, minimum maintenance and sustainability. These characteristics are all crucial in stadiums, which do not only intend to spend little money on lighting and their replacement but also need to be as green as possible and as attractive as possible to draw in viewers. New solutions in the world of sport arenas all enter the race of winning the title of the &quot;most eco-friendly stadium&quot;, and that already excludes other forms of lighting. LED light bulbs are also the greenest lighting solution available on the market. One good example for their extended use is the recently built Green Point Stadium in Cape Town built for the 2010 World Cup. The arena, illuminated with the latest and highest quality LEDs by Osram is built for showing off with its lighting, using various forms of LEDs, like strips, reflectors, spotlights, panels, etc. The architectural piece shows its most charming face during the night, when internal illuminations make the walls transparent and also bright up.<br /><br />LED downlights may be a bit on the expensive side, but if you just take a look at all the benefits that you'll get by just using them instead of the usual halogen bulbs, you'll find that they more than make up for the price.<br /><br />LED lights have become more popular these days because they are now able to replace almost all the lighting implements in your home. In fact, modern LED bulbs are found out to be even more energy efficient than CFL's (compact fluorescent lamps), meaning that the savings that you will get will be amazing.<br /><br />When you compare the amount of electricity that a normal halogen bulb will use in its entire lifetime to the amount consumed by an equivalent LED bulb in the same amount of time, the electricity used by the LED light is less than 10 per cent that was used to light the halogen bulb. So when you replace all of the halogens in your home with LED bulbs you'll significantly lower the total amount of electricity that your whole house uses every month. These savings alone will allow you to earn back the initial investment in the LED lights in just a couple of months.<br /><br />The average lifetime of a regular halogen bulb is at best around 2,000 hours, or 11 months of use. And last but not least LED bulbs use less electricity reducing CO2 levels exhausted into the atmosphere and their long life lessens landfill so they are in fact distinctly environmentally friendly.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5lYXN0ZXJubGlnaHRpbmcuY29t" target="_blank">Led Par 38</a>

GU basics have two pins that are inserted into the corresponding socket : but GU10 pins are larger than GU5. 3, so as not to inadvertently mix them up. An E-base is a well-known threaded base which are used on incandescent bulbs for many years. You may get an E27, MR16 light bulb too - simply to confuse matters much more. Your grandfather looked rather tired after more or less everything, however , he later said it absolutely was helpful to your pet. I hope feel free to use it too. <br />.<br />For most families, probably the most significant single factor alongside low energy LED lighting as a substitute for the soon-to-be-phased-out regular incandescent light bulb is the expense differential. There is not any doubt that a particular LED equivalent lamp (for example of this a 6w LED spotlight to be a direct replacement for any 35w GU10 halogen lamp) is much more expensive than either the first or a CFL solution. <br /><br />One can find however three important points to remember about the better price for poor energy LEDs when compared to incandescent and electrical power saving CFL lamps. <br /><br />Earliest, the price difference reflects that the use of LED for standard purpose domestic lighting holds quite novel, though increasing output levels and customer take-up will drive the price down dramatically after both come fully on stream in the coming months. <br /><br />Following, and partially based on the observation above, is that the money necessary LEDs drops by the factor of twenty over the course of each decade. This characteristic is actually reliably predicted by simply Haitz's Law (much like Moore's Law meant for computer chips and for similar reasons, principally because LEDs usually are, just like computer chips, pure electronic devices). Haitz also reports that LED performance (degree of light per watt of electricity) increases tenfold above the same decade. <br /><br />Third and perhaps most intriguing is the point that as far as the money necessary domestic lighting is worried, the price of bulbs is almost altogether irrelevant. It is definitely extraordinary yet easily provable undeniable fact that even if regular lamps were totally free and LED your lights cost, let's say something outrageous enjoy $80 each, it would still be vastly cheaper to purchase BROUGHT ABOUT low energy lamps. <br /><br />The biology behind this is uncomplicated: the cost regarding electrical lighting is the price tag on the energy we. e. electricity. It matters not one jot what that light bulbs value; it's what it costs to own them that definitely counts. Also, since LEDs last for tens of thousands of hours (in practice, decades of utilize) you just need to pay the final cost once, unlike regular light sources which last solely upto two thousand hours or simply over one 365 days. <br /><br />The other biggest gripe concerning low energy BROUGHT ABOUT lighting is gentle levels and level of quality, or in technical parlance luminosity and light color. <br /><br />That concern about luminosity stalks largely from historical notions of LED lighting applications like LED Christmas your lights and pocket torches which might be clearly not able of providing anything all-around useable domestic lighting. <br />.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5lYXN0ZXJubGlnaHRpbmcuY29t" target="_blank">Jewerly Store Lighting</a>

		<document id="7f99ed30b541d14b5be30685cf12158d" url=""><![CDATA[Which GU10 LED To Replace Halogen Bulbs?<br/><br/>Heat means wasted energy, especially if its being generated when you're trying to illuminate an area. On boats, wasted energy means more use of the engines or gen-set for charging. In severe cases people find themselves either adding solar panels(in the event the boat didn't already have any), increasing the quantity of solar panels, or adding a wind generator. All of this is expensive. Another problem with the heat build-up is that it can be a potential fire hazard. While I was on a mid-size power boat recently, it was pointed out to me, that there were scorch marks on the tops of the cabinet doors. While those doors were open, they tended to rest right beneath the halogen spotlight with only a couple fractions of an inch between the top of the door and the spotlight. Not good when you find a wooden door charred black. Made me wonder how much longer it would have been before he had a fire. Our solution was to swap the halogens for LED replacements of a suitable size for the housings.<br /><br />Another downfall is the limited life. Halogens really don't last very long. Maybe 4,000 hours if you're lucky. Part of this is the halogen bulb's sensitivity to voltage fluctuations. Compare this to an LED that has a typical life of &lt;em&gt;at least&lt;/em&gt; 50,000 hours. That means less screwing around with bulbs changes. Now also consider that MR16 spreader bulb in something like a Lewmar spreader light. Climbing up to that is at best a pain in the, well you know.<br /><br />Speaking of bulb changes, that's the last issue. Bulb changes with G4 halogens particularly typically involve installation with latex gloves on or something similar to keep you from touching the new bulb directly. The oils in your skin cause hot spots on the glass and lead to premature bulb failure. So, DO NOT touch the bulb with your bare hands. If you do, wipe the bulb clean with an alcohol soaked paper towel.<br /><br />With all this in mind, it becomes obvious that the halogen bulb is far from ideal on a boat. Now don't go fretting about needing to change your light fixtures. That's expensive, unnecessary, and generally a hassle. The simple solution? Just change the bulbs out with LED replacements. Simple, inexpensive(in the long term as 50,000 hours worth of halogens could run you $36 pretty easily), and much more efficient(meaning more time on the hook). All that, and you get to keep your existing fixtures. Sounds like a plan to me!<br /><br />As before, I wish all boaters a safe and happy cruise!<br /><br />With low voltage lighting becoming more and more popular these days, many seek to replace their old-fashioned light bulbs with the fantastic, new and powerful LED bulbs coming on the market today. For instance, it is very common to want to retire GU10 halogen bulbs and put in a few GU10 LED bulbs instead. Naturally, people have some questions regarding how to do this right, so in this article I will try to address the most pressing ones.<br /><br />First of all, a common question is &quot;what type of GU10 LED should I get?&quot;. If you need it to dim then you could try buying 1 as a sample to test, or you can contact the specific manufacturer who are usually very helpful.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5lYXN0ZXJubGlnaHRpbmcuY29t" target="_blank">Led Track Lighting</a>

The incandescent technology was actually invented by Thomas Edison in 1879. High efficiency halogens will generally save approximately 30% in electricity costs and have the additional advantage that they are generally dimmable. Furthermore, halogen units employ miniature technology which means they can be built small and with gratifying aesthetics.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt; CFL Bulbs &lt;/b&gt;<br /><br />Compact Fluorescent Lamp- CFL energy saving light bulbs which use a miniaturised type of the fluorescent tube technology are especially efficient saving in excess of 75% in electricity costs. Modern CFL units shouldn't suffer from the dullness and flickering difficulties that were intrinsic in the first CFL's that hit the market. The big drawback of the CFL is the looks but modern spirals have enhanced the looks and the globes can look most desirable.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;LED Bulbs&lt;/b&gt;<br /><br />LED are the favoured type of energy saving light bulbs. The LED gives a monstrous efficiency saving of around 90% when contrasted to orthodox light bulbs. Also LED's have an especially long life and their particularly low energy consumption means that CO2 emissions are minimised making the LED the ideal green choice. The final facet is the visual impression because LED's have a high technology look which it is important to accommodate as part of the interior lighting scheme.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;Conclusions&lt;/b&gt;<br /><br />Your final choice will undoubtedly be a balance of performance, efficiency, aesthetics, commercials and the level of importance attributed to the environment for your specific application. Also with the technology moving so fast, particularly in the LED area then you need to keep abreast of the market. For example the LED bulbs which have only been on the market for a few years and were traditionally quite dim are now being manufactured in high power units so that a 3W candle bulb which is equivalent to a 25W conventional unit can now be acquired at a good price. So take some time to review your needs against these points and get illuminated in an environmental manner.<br /><br />How Does LED Accent Lighting Works?<br /><br />This kind of light produces an illumination form which imitates the qualities of the conventional xenon or incandescent lamp sources. For these reasons, LEDs are considered as directional lights. Thus, they focus softer light in just one direction as well as minimizing radiant, excessive glare. The popularity of the decorative lighting has rapidly increased from car and motorcycle lighting down to living room and bedroom mood lighting. Moreover, it also fulfills the niche requirements of the lighting cabinets, displays and beneath cabinet lights that are found in dens, kitchen, fine baths, bedrooms, living rooms as well as commercial interiors. Most people usually invest thousands of cash within its finest display shelving, eclectic furniture, bookshelves and cabinetry realizing that fine pieces of the interior lingers in shadow.<br /><br />For over 40 years, this is the reason why area of expertise is very important to any interior design pertaining to the evolutionary home design since it is expected to have lower voltage lighting which is suited to cabinets and fine furniture.<br /><br />Most homes nowadays are built like building compared to the houses built in the past decades. In the next few years the streets will be literally glowing with innovative fashion designs.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5lYXN0ZXJubGlnaHRpbmcuY29t" target="_blank">Led Par 38</a>

More precisely they are LED lights placed on either an adjustable track or a fixed track. The tracks are available in different designs such as arcs, circle, semi circular, waves, and etc in black, bronze, gold, silver finish and even transparent. Furthermore the lights themselves have shades available in ivory, bronze, amber, Olympia antique, nickel and etc, hence meeting your different aesthetic needs. Not necessary these lights can only be used for limited spaces but in stead have brought with them new dimensions of aristocracy and delicacy.<br /><br />Places like for example home book or video libraries, they can be placed in front of the shelves and racks aiding not into the light provision but also similar matching of contemporary styling.<br /><br />Some people often opt to keep expensive birds in the cages, with golden touch, to make the bird more prominent and noticeable, contemporary styled light can be fixed closer to the cage thus each matching its profile.<br />&lt;br&gt;Facilitating more to the aristocracy and contemporary styling, some people with special hobbies and interests opt to collect old weapons such as muskets, weapons of the famous battles as antiques, old musical instruments, old clocks, and etc, the lights of these styles, such as in an arc style fixed frame LED light with bronze shade, can aid to the value and profoundness of the collection.<br /><br />Light, of whatever style it is, its shade, its own style has its own silent language which must be reached on the right spot to give a complete look, which is completing of the spirit.<br /><br />The places of their usage are unlimited, as they entirely depend upon the choice of the user. These are found in many designs but the basic types are as follows:<br /><br />&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Plate track mounting.&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;Fixed track&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;Adjustable track&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;Semicircular, waves, arch, flexible arc.&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;Straight fixed and adjustable.&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;Fiber plastic shades with variable color variety&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;Solid shade&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;<br /><br />The total variety available in the market is unlimited; so much so customized design options are also available. Even the known designs are in the count of more than thousands; therefore it is not easy to configure which design is more known. The simple point of our discussion is, that they although very simple in design, extremely cheap in use, but has addressed the choice of millions, especially those with the difficult one, know as contemporary choice.<br /><br />Here are the benefits of using commercial grade products such as an AVR LED track light system:<br /><br />&amp;bull; Low energy usage - Upto 80% energy saving compared to traditional track lights. This can be as little as 4.8W for a 50W halogen replacement to just 28.8W for a CDM70 replacement.<br /><br />&amp;bull; Intensely Powerful - Using Cree MCE LED's has enabled us to deliver outstanding intensity whilst being ultra efficient.<br /><br />&amp;bull; Defining - Proven LEDs like Cree MCE's offer beautiful defining effect that brings objects to life. There is also a variety of source colour temperatures available. These include warm (3K), soft (3.5K), neutral (4k) &amp; cool (5K).

Due to the young age of the technology it is developing rapidly, but replacement bulbs for many traditional forms of light are already available. LED lighting does not only offer new technology, but also new forms of lighting are available, like the strip lights or single LEDs for signal lighting. Top brands in LED lighting, like CREE or Philips already announced true replacements of 60W incandescent lights, with a power consumption of only 10-12W and an extremely long lifespan. Also, there is an even wider range of LED lights, if you are prepared to put up with a narrower beam angle you can get replacement light bulbs with somewhat less light (or more directional light) for a fraction of the price. These LED lights - even the higher performance ones will save you 60% of your lighting bill, but this rate might go up to 90% as well.<br /><br />Another field of saving energy is the previously mentioned use of appliances. There is an extremely wide range of energy-saving appliances, now even the simplest hot-water kettle has an energy-saving version (by simply boiling only the amount of water you need, not the full kettle). These appliances are classified into energy classes, and the best ones are currently the A+++. These applications will definitely save on your energy - meanwhile devices using water will save you water as well. If you are still struggling with your old washing machine, it is high time for a change, and you will be surprised to see the difference in your energy bill too.<br /><br />Needless to mention you can save energy by reducing the operating hours of these gadgets, as well as by switching off your lights as often as you can. Though the number of switches mattered with compact lights, and switching them on and off actually was not economical (and required a lot of patience while waiting for it to fully brighten up), this problem no longer exists with these LED lights turning on instantly with full brightness.<br /><br />If you follow these two simple rules whenever you spend on a new device or light bulb, you will quickly saving energy and see a huge drop in your electricity bill. You do not necessarily have to think in huge changes, every light bulb changed will add up eventually, and every application bought will save you some more. Just do it one step at a time.<br /><br />Nanotechnology is basically the manipulation of a matter or several matters on a molecular scale. The theory of the technology has been announced since the 1960's, but major researches and developments started during the 1980's. Its introduction to LED production is bringing quality achievements both in lighting solutions and for displays.<br /><br />LEDs are the most energy-efficient lighting solution on the market, since LEDs convert the majority of energy into light. Still, about 20% of the light emitted by the diode is lost due the high refractive index of LEDs (a certain percentage of the light is reflected back inside the diode and is not emitted eventually). Biological lighting or organic lighting are both key perspectives in eco-friendly illumination, which makes research for lower cost and better performing LEDs crucial.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5lYXN0ZXJubGlnaHRpbmcuY29t" target="_blank">diamond lighting</a>

Why can't the standard lights be used for this purpose? Let us look at the answers to both these questions.<br /><br />First, you need to be equally cautious while driving during both day and night hours. If you do not have sufficient light during the day hours, you can easily band due to solar reflections. Thus, an LED light can help you in this relation. On the other hand, the standard mercury lights cannot be used for this purpose because the light intensity is very low. In addition to that, they seem very dim in front of the normal color light. Thus, LED lights have a key advantage in such situations.<br /><br />What other benefits do these lights offer during the day hours? When you are driving on a rainy day or doing night hours, you need light for a greater distance and for clear visibility. In other words, you need a clear view far ahead on the road. This is when LED lights prove to be very helpful. This is because they have a better range than mercury bulbs and you can easily see the cars coming from the opposite direction.<br /><br />&lt;object width=&quot;480&quot; height=&quot;360]&lt;param name=&quot;movie&quot; value=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fv%2FQXpwgQGo5f8%3Fversion%3D3%26amp%3Bamp%3Bhl%3Den_US"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/v/QXpwgQGo5f8?version=3&amp;amp;hl=en_US</a>]&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;allowFullScreen&quot; value=&quot;true]&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;allowscriptaccess&quot; value=&quot;always]&lt;/param&gt;&lt;embed src=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fv%2FQXpwgQGo5f8%3Fversion%3D3%26amp%3Bamp%3Bhl%3Den_US%26quot"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/v/QXpwgQGo5f8?version=3&amp;amp;hl=en_US&quot</a>; type=&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; allowscriptaccess=&quot;always&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true]&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;<br /><br />In most cases, the life span of these lights is more than the conventional mercury ones. They consume less power from the automobile battery. Note, however, that, if you plan to use track lighting to illuminate art on a wall, you will need to install the tracks by that wall right at the beginning.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;Damaging Art:&lt;/b&gt; UV radiation will gradually damage artwork. Normally, this is not a problem, but in a gallery, where art may be hung for literally centuries, it becomes a serious concern. Unfortunately, halogen lights, the traditional form of gallery lighting, produced UV radiation.<br /><br />However, LED lighting produces no UV radiation at all. Until five years ago, LED lighting was unsuited to galleries, but recently, white LED lights were developed. As a result, LED lights provide the best gallery track lighting on the market today. They are directed and do not damage artwork.<br /><br />In conclusion, then, track lighting should be directed, flexible and safe for artwork. LED track lighting provides all of these.<br /><br />Kitchen track lighting can be used to brighten up areas of your kitchen that would otherwise be in shadow. This also gives your kitchen a fashionable look. If you are considering this type of lighting, you will find that it has more advantages than disadvantages.<br /><br />Track lighting serves several purposes. First, it focuses light on areas where you would otherwise be working in your own shadow. These are areas that may be under the shadow of the kitchen cabinets. You might need light to wash up and clean vegetables at the sink, for example. You will need illumination to cook. You will need to see well enough for you and your family to eat. You or your kids may even do work at the kitchen table. The lights can be focused on those areas to help. This is called task lighting.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;<br /><br />Kitchen Track Lighting May Need Several Layers of Light&lt;/b&gt;<br /><br />One complaint against track lighting is that it does not cover the entire kitchen. You probably need several layers of light, especially if you have a larger kitchen. Always refer to the manufacturers instructions for specifics on the track lighting kit you purchase.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5lYXN0ZXJubGlnaHRpbmcuY29t" target="_blank">Led Track Lighting</a>

Wattage: Fortunately that most LED PAR bulbs will consume a lesser amount of power than that incandescent or halogen bulb that you're replacing. In some cases the action savings can depend on 80% or far more! However, we had been conditioned through the long using incandescent and halogen lamps to associate the brightness (gentle output) with a particular wattage, but on earth of LED lamps that doesn't tell the main story.
