Nobody cares about the fans." This nba shoes is a typical lament heard on sports radio no matter the sport or who is involved in the dispute.When push comes to shove, there's a feeling that management is in the business for basketball shoes itself, the players are out to see how much money they can make and there are no concerns for the paying customer.Statements to the contrary are just designed to keep the paying customers in place and prevent them from defecting for another sport or another off-work avocation.The basketball shoes for men NHL lockout began Sept. 15, and it seems that NHL commissioner Gary Bettman has no doubt that the sport's fans will come back whenever NHL hockey returns in earnest.Bettman expressed his confidence that hockey fans would return to the league's arenas no matter how long a work stoppage lasts. "We recovered well last time because we have the world's greatest fans," he said, per The News & Observer.In addition to pandering, Bettman can look back at how his sport disappeared from the sports landscape for a nba shoes full year when the 2004-05 season was lost to a work stoppage.No other major North American sports league had ever canceled a full season prior to that event, and no sports league has followed in the NHL's footsteps.Yet when the league returned in full for the 2005-06 season, fans returned to the sport.Revenues for the NHL were soon higher than they had ever been, and arenas were full of passionate, screaming and intensely loyal fans.Are hockey fans blindly loyal to the sport they love? Are they more passionate than the fanbases of the NFL, MLB and NBA, or are they merely addicted to NHL hockey?If the latter is the case, Bettman is the street dealer who is withholding the product from his desperate customers.While the fans' lament of "nobody caring about them" sounds naive and cliched, it may have more meaning with NHL fans than those of any other sport.Owners are locking out players. They wouldn't endeavor such a practice unless it was bringing them some benefit.The players will soon be hurting because they will be losing regular-season salary. However, a percentage of players have decent alternatives to the NHL. Many players find work overseas in leagues like the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL) and other European leagues that are willing to employ players on a temporary basis until the NHL lockout is over.Players may not make the same kind of salaries they do in the NHL, but they will get paid for playing hockey. That's not so bad.NHL fans have no suitable alternative. Minor league hockey is not a decent substitute, and ESPN's decision to offer KHL hockey is laughable.Fans have no loyalty to the KHL, and there will be little interest outside of mere curiosity when it comes to seeing well-known players in strange uniforms.Hockey fans are incredibly dedicated and passionate. But is there any tangible evidence to suggest they are more loyal than NFL, NBA and MLB fans? No.A 2010 survey by marketing metric firm Brand Keys Inc. reported that NHL fans were behind the other sports in terms of loyalty. The Business of Sports published the Brand Keys survey that said NFL and MLB fans were the most loyal, followed by NBA and then NHL fans.The perception that hockey fans are the most loyal may not be true at all.Bettman and the NHL owners may be miscalculating as they lock the players out of NHL arenas.If they are wrong in their belief that hockey fans will return, they will pay a very big price.

As we took a step back and looked at the landscape as a whole, one thing became remarkably clear: Sophistication in offensive systems is at the highest we've ever seen.Offenses are operating with complexities that older, formerly unstoppable systems, never dreamed would come to fruition on the collegiate landscape.These uniquities are more than just mere wrinkles in the offensive scheme. Rather, they are amalgamations of offensive theory designed to pull together the best of various schemes and render defenses paralyzed by the threats. And as we sit right now, defenses are still struggling to play catch-up for a myriad of reasons.In the annals of football history, we've seen dominant offensive systems. The wishbone was a monster for Oklahoma. Steve Spurrier's Fun 'n' Gun style of play truly took the SEC by storm. The Delaware and Bay City variants of Wing-T football are still employed by teams to gain a schematic advantage and capitalize on deception.There have been dominant offenses throughout the history of college football. Some rooted in power, others rooted in deception, while still others make their hay by spreading you out and taxing your players' ability to respond to matchups.The difference between now and then is the dynamism that teams bring to the table. The sharing between coaches is more advanced, both directly and lebron james shoes indirectly. The film work done to assess weaknesses and strengths of defenses is more thorough. The caliber of athlete is higher than ever. AND coaches are more willing to "just try it" on the offensive side of the ball.Sure, coaches have their primary offensive systems. However, unlike those running the Wishbone or the Air Raid of old, the modern coach is incredibly willing to evolve. Guys like Rich Rodriguez, Dana Holgorsen and even Jim McElwaine are willing to adopt principles from foreign systems in order to maximize what they can get out of their own athletes.One need only look as far as Alabama's 2009 SEC championship win over Florida to see the Tide take on simple spread passing principles in order to catch Florida off-guard and build an early lead.Note that this passing attack was made possible-much like Alabama's approach to the 2011 BCS title game-by self-scouting. Modern film work is light years ahead of where it was just a decade ago. Self-scouting, identifying your own tendencies and then doing the opposite to exploit a team's preparation makes for gaping holes and massive opportunities.The dynamism goes beyond merely adopting wrinkles from other offenses. We're also seeing plays that are more complex than in years past. Teams going to the line with a run-and-pass or a weak- and strong-side play call is nothing new. Quarterbacks get to the line, assess the defense, make a color call to signify which play they're using, and then proceed from there.Now, we're seeing teams take that next step in packaged plays. Teams cheap nba shoes like Florida State, Clemson and West Virginia are combining the option with the packaged play as a means of stretching a defense to their limits. Here's a breakdown of what I mean:Clemson starts out with no deep back, only a shallow tight end, flex-type player.We see Andre Ellington, their running back, start in motion. It could be a jet sweep, which Clemson has hurt teams with plenty in the last few seasons.Ellington ends up in the backfield for the zone-read with Tajh Boyd. The quarterback can give it or keep it depending upon his read.Boyd keeps the ball here as the Florida State defensive end (95) crashes down toward Ellington.Except wait, as the safety (20) and linebacker (7) recognize Boyd's keeping it, they come hard for Boyd.And Boyd throws it to Sammy Watkins, waiting behind the line with two blockers out in front.Which turns into a 20-yard gain for the Tigers.That play itself is a very acute example of why defenses are having a hard time playing catch-up. No run threats turns into a zone-read look, becomes a quarterback running and then again transforms into a quick screen to one of college football's most dangerous wideouts. Defending all of those things is not easy, and yet defenses are called upon to do just that on a play-in and play-out basis.Do you think the offenses of today are more complex than ever before?Do you think the offenses of today are more complex than ever before?No, the wishbone and wing-t were just as complex7.2%No, the run-n-shoot and fun-n-gun schemes were just like today's offenses8.6%Yes, today's offenses combine more pieces that make things very difficult84.1%Total votes: 1,214On a more macro level, defenses are battling schemes that require them to be better basketball shoes than ever while battling a talent drain on that side of the football. So many "would-be" defensive players are going to the other side of the ball and getting their shine on in the high-powered offensive systems. "Would-be" linebackers and defensive ends are playing tight end, flex and H-back. "Would-be" defensive backs are playing running back, receiver and even quarterback for teams that ply them from other schools with the allure of being a point producer.While some coaches are able to field first-rate defenses with elite talent, there are others who are clearly operating with guys who are a notch or two below their offensive counterparts on their own team. Certainly, that was the case in the Baylor-WVU game that Joe Fan sat in awe of as an "awesome offensive showing" this past Saturday.Simply put, when you're asking less talented players to do more than ever, that's a recipe for disaster. Defense is truly a collective, and while some teams have good parts, if you're only working with an elite DB or an elite LB for example, then your overall unit cannot truly compete. It is a lot more difficult to hide your flaws on the defensive side of the ball, because regardless of how you scheme, one player cannot play the entire 53.3. You can't scheme him to make every tackle or cover every receiver or make all the plays.Especially not the way an offense can isolate their stud wide receiver or running back, or let their quarterback eat up a defense.There is hope though, as defenses slowly figure out the newer schemes. The beauty of the new atmosphere of coaching-the sharing and the wealth of knowledge-is that it happens on defense too. There are more eyeballs on these systems than ever before, and great defensive minds are all working on solutions to the fast-break offensive philosophy.As we can see here, scoring is most certainly up through the start of the 2010s as a decade. However, as defenses catch up, expect the numbers to fall closer in line with years past. Each distinct offensive style-wishbone, I-form option, Fun 'n' Gun and Oklahoma's blending of new basketball shoes the Air Raid and pro style-saw both highs and lows depending upon both talent and defensive preparation.

The mind reels at the possible questions that might elicit that response. What player can most guarantee that people will be calling for my head by the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uYmFzaG9lc2J1c2luZXNzLmNvbS8_" target="_blank">cheap basketball shoes</a> end of the year? What player can do the most to make people overcome their doubts about Tim Tebow's ability to play quarterback? Which guy played the worst today? It feels ridiculous to listen to a grown man stand by a quarterback who had about as bad a day as humanly possible, but that doesn't mean Ryan's doing the wrong thing. And we don't mean from the standpoint of pumping your players full of confidence in even the darkest moments of the season, either. If you're going to bench Sanchez, you're doing much more than simply saying that you think a different quarterback gives you a better chance to beat the Texans. You're pulling the plug on the entire Sanchez-as-franchise quarterback era because this is his fourth year, and you've got to find someone else to fill that role if you no longer think Sanchez is that guy. Given that fact, there's no particular reason for the Jets to rush Sanchez out of the job because they know that they will have to start the process of moving on the moment they make that call. With the Texans and Patriots coming up in the next three weeks and Darrelle Revis (and, likely, Santonio Holmes) done for the season, there's a pretty good chance that the meaningful portion of the Jets' season will come to an end before the first half is over and that leaves you plenty of time to start figuring out next steps. Tebow isn't the answer either. If the Jets thought that Tebow was a real option to move forward with as quarterback, he would have, at the very least, competed with Sanchez for the job during training camp and the preseason. Or just played a series or two in garbage time against the 49ers. The Jets didn't do that and that sends about the clearest possible signal that there's no groundswell of support for Tebow to be anything other than a guy who can do a few different things to help the team without being its starting quarterback. Basically, the main arguments for Tebow are that he can't be any worse than Sanchez and that he rode a team with a good running game and defense to the playoffs last season. The first isn't a reason to do anything and the second isn't remotely true of this Jets team. None of this should be taken as a grand defense of Sanchez. He's shown absolutely zero improvement over the last two seasons and games like Sunday's are cropping up far too often for a player who should be growing more comfortable in the position as he spends more time playing it for the Jets. His ball security is shockingly bad and his ability to make plays under pressure actually seems to be regressing, two things that aren't likely to start getting better all of a sudden. There are plenty of other problems with the Jets offense, but the truth is that Sanchez has never looked to be much more than a guy who can guide you to wins when the best players on the team are elsewhere and that's a losing formula with this roster. In short, if Sanchez was going to become a better quarterback it would have happened already. There's no longer any question that the future must include a new quarterback for the Jets, but the present should include the current one until the point comes that the Jets have nothing left to gain from sticking with the status quo. At 2-2, they aren't there quite yet. Come the end of October, the answer will likely be different. Josh Alper is also a writer for Pro Football Talk . You can follow him on Twitter .

<br /><br />Jeff Berry of CAA will represent Peavy, who will be one of the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uYmFzaG9lc2J1c2luZXNzLmNvbS8_" target="_blank">basketball shoes</a> most sought-after free agent pitchers this winter.
<br /><br />Peavy’s hiring of Berry can’t hurt the Sox. Since assistant general manager Rick Hahn, the Sox’s chief negotiator who is expected to take over the GM duties soon, joined the Sox in 2001, he and Berry have agreed to terms on more than $170 million in contracts <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uYmFiYXNrZXRiYWxsc2hvZXNib3guY29tLw__" target="_blank">new basketball shoes</a> for Mark Buehrle, John Danks and Mark Teahen.
<br /><br />“Jake loves his teammates and the organization,” Berry said Friday. “Having said that, he’s excited to experience the free agent process for the first time in his career.
<br /><br />“He’s open to everything.”
<br /><br />In the past 12 months, Berry has negotiated more than $250 million in deals for pitchers Matt Cain, Buehrle and Danks. Cain signed a six-year, $127.5 million <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uYmFzaG9lc3BhcnR5LmNvbS8_" target="_blank">cheap nba shoes</a> contract with San Francisco before the 2012 season that made him the highest-paid right handed pitcher.
<br /><br />Peavy and the Los Angeles Angels’ Zack Greinke are expected to be among the most attractive free agent pitchers this winter.
<br /><br />“Jake is 31, a three-time All-Star, a Cy Young winner, one of the best competitors in the game and pitching as well as ever,” Berry said.
<br /><br />Peavy rebounded from a detached latissimus dorsi muscle near his right shoulder in July of 2010 to lead the Sox with 219 innings, 32 starts, 194 strikeouts and four complete games <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5teWJhc2tldGJhbGxzaG9lc2Zvcm1lbi5jb20v" target="_blank">lebron james shoes</a> in 2012 while staying injury-free the entire season.
<br /><br />His complete games were a career high, and his innings, starts and strikeouts were his most since his 2007 season with the Padres when he won the National League Cy Young Award.
<br /><br />In the past years, Peavy had been represented by Barry Axelrod, who is leaving the agent profession to join the Arizona Diamondbacks.

<br />Parker, a 6-foot-8 forward, was the 2012 Gatorade Boys <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uYmFiYXNrZXRiYWxsc2hvZXNib3guY29tLw__" target="_blank">basketball shoes</a> Basketball Player of the Year as a junior after leading Simeon High-Chicago to an Illinois state title while averaging 19.5 points and 8.9 rebounds per game.
<br />&quot;He's going to take all those five visits and then decide,&quot; said his father, Sonny, who played six seasons with the Warriors after starring at Chicago's Farragut Career Academy and Texas A&amp;M.
<br />Sonny Parker wasn't sure of the exact dates but did say Jabari will visit Duke at the end of the month and Florida in the first week of November. The letter-of-intent signing period begins Nov. 14.

<br />Lauren Battung scored 1:33 into the first overtime, lifting No. 15 Cal (10-3, 3-1 Pac-12) to a 3-2 women's soccer win over host Colorado (6-4-3, 0-3-1). The Bears trailed 2-0 before Ifeoma Onumonu scored twice.
<br />Nina Watkins scored in the 35th minute to give No. 2 Stanford (10-1-1, 4-0 Pac-12) a 1-0 victory over host Utah (7-3-2, 2-2). The Cardinal capitalized on a Utes mistake for its goal. Rachel Quon sent a long free kick into the penalty area, and Utah attempted an offsides trap. The timing was off, and Stanford had five players <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5teWJhc2tldGJhbGxzaG9lc2Zvcm1lbi5jb20v" target="_blank">basketball shoes for men</a> alone behind the Utes defense. Watkins collected the ball and slotted it past goalkeeper Lindsey Luke.
<br />Freshman goalkeeper Andi Tostanoski had 11 saves, helping No. 21 Santa Clara (7-2-4, 0-0-1 WCC) to a 0-0 draw against No. 6 BYU (11-1-1, 0-0-1) in Provo, Utah.

The visiting Ducks jumped out to a 6-1 lead in the fifth set, but the Cardinal went on a 14-4 run for the win.
<br />Shannon Hawari had nine kills and six blocks, and Cal (9-7, 3-3 Pac-12) cruised to a 25-14, 25-19, 25-18 win over visiting Oregon State (12-5, 2-3).
<br />Cal's Zsofi Susanyi, seeded No. 2, lost to Georgia's Maho Kowase 6-3, 6-1 in the second round of the ITA Women's All-American Championships in Pacific Palisades. Teammate Anett Schutting also lost, 6-4, 6-3 <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uYmFzaG9lc2J1c2luZXNzLmNvbS8_" target="_blank">nba shoes</a> to Kansas State's Petra Niedermayerova.

<br />Francona, who guided the Boston <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uYmFzaG9lc2J1c2luZXNzLmNvbS8_" target="_blank">nba shoes</a> Red Sox to two World Series titles, has been hired as manager of the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5teWJhc2tldGJhbGxzaG9lc2Zvcm1lbi5jb20v" target="_blank">basketball shoes for men</a> Cleveland Indians, a team that collapsed in the second half this season after a promising first four months. The sides continued working Saturday night on the length of Francona's contract.
<br />The 53-year-old will be formally introduced as Cleveland's 42nd manager during a Monday news conference at Progressive Field.
<br />&quot;I'm really excited,&quot; Francona said on the air as an ESPN analyst, his job for the past season. &quot;People who don't know me may have thought I was looking for something different.&quot;
<br />The Indians chose Francona over Sandy Alomar Jr., the club's interim manager for the final six games after Manny Acta was fired Sept. 27. Francona and Alomar, who spent the past three seasons as a coach in Cleveland, were the only candidates to interview for the Indians' opening.
<br />Alomar has been offered a spot on Francona's staff, most likely as bench coach.
<br />Francona worked in Cleveland's front office as an adviser in 2001. He also spent a portion of the 1988 season on Cleveland's major league roster, and his father, Tito, played with the Indians from 1959-64.
<br />&quot;It's a good story, almost a family feeling,&quot; Francona said after his interview Friday. &quot;I don't think you can take a job because of that, but it still means a lot to me.&quot;
<br />The Indians were within 3?1/2 games of first place July 27 but went 5-24 in August -- the worst month in the franchise's 112-year history.
<br />Nationals vs. Cardinals: Adam Wainwright was a spectator last fall, cheering on the St. Louis Cardinals from the bench as they rose from wild card to World Series champions.
<br />It's a lot more fun being part of the action.
<br />&quot;This game I get to play is very special to me, and missing that time last year, I really learned how much I love the game,&quot; Wainwright said.
<br />Fans in Washington, D.C., anticipating the first baseball postseason appearance for the nation's capital since 1933, have to feel that way, too.
<br />Wainwright, a 14-game winner in his first year back from elbow reconstruction surgery, successfully fought against restricting his innings and starts Sunday in the N.L. division series opener. The Nationals, who led the league with 97 wins, will go with 21-game winner Gio Gonzalez after sitting down Stephen Strasburg in early September with 159?1/3 innings pitched.
<br />&quot;There's so many things that factor into this that you take it with a smile,&quot; Gonzalez said. &quot;It's the first time ever experiencing this, to represent such a great organization, such a great rotation, great lineup. It's unbelievable.&quot;
<br />Yankees vs. Orioles: Sixteen years after the Yankees ousted the Orioles from the playoffs and advanced to the World Series, the teams resume their rivalry Sunday night in Game 1 of the A.L. Division Series. It will be Baltimore's first home postseason game since 1997.
<br />The Orioles spent much of the season chasing New York in the A.L. East, and now they have an opportunity to get the better of the Yankees in a far more significant scenario. After New York swept a three-game set in Baltimore in April, the Orioles rebounded to forge a split of the 18-game season series.
<br />&quot;We've played those guys a lot this year. We know what they've got, they know what

That was 1999, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uYmFiYXNrZXRiYWxsc2hvZXNib3guY29tLw__" target="_blank">new basketball shoes</a> when the US overcame that sized deficit in The Miracle at Brookline. They will be favored in the singles. You'd want to be where the Yanks are. But it felt like the UScould have ended it Saturday. And you wonder if they won't come to regret it tomorrow. The Americans were brilliant in the morning, and it may be more than <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5teWJhc2tldGJhbGxzaG9lc2Zvcm1lbi5jb20v" target="_blank">lebron james shoes</a> a coincidence that Steve Stricker and Tiger Woods were sitting it out. Keegan Bradley and Phil Mickelson continued their simply out-of-body level of play, setting a record for largest margin of victory over Lee Westwood and Luke Donald at 7&amp;6. If it were a boxing match the ref would have stopped it. Jason Dufner and Zach Johnson continued their streamlined play, rolling to a 2&amp;1 win over Nicolas Colsaerts and Sergio Garcia. It was quite a reversal for Colsaerts <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uYmFzaG9lc2J1c2luZXNzLmNvbS8_" target="_blank">basketball shoes</a> Saturday from Friday, when he singlehnadedly kept Tiger Woods at bay. Saturday, he couldn't buy a putt. If they kept such things, he would have set a record for putts that lipped out. Jim Furyk and Brendt Snedeker were able to sneak to a victory in the foursomes over the pair that had beat them yesterday, the Northern Irish duo of Rory McIlroy and Graeme McDowell. This time, they didn't make a mistake on 18. The fact that Europe is even in with a shout Sunday is down to Ian Poulter.He got them their one point in the morning Saturday, and he hauled back Dufner and Johnson over the last four holes in the afternoon with huge putts. He turned a 2-down deficit into a <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uYmFzaG9lc3BhcnR5LmNvbS8_" target="_blank">cheap nba shoes</a> 1up win, and he did it with birdies on the last four holes. He's been Europe's star by a mile. If the US does cough this up, some will be wondering if that critical point that would have had a foot on the Europeans throat was the decision to bring in Steve Stricker and sit both Mickelson and Bradley. While captain Davis Love has stated that the plan all along was to make sure no one played all five sessions to conserve energy, the thought of an audible must have crossed his mind. The publicity will go to Tiger, but he was magnificent on the back nine in the afternoon four-ball after sitting out the morning. He gave the US birdies on 15-17 to haul them back. But he got no help from Stricker at any point. It sets up what should be a straightforward day for the US Sunday. They need 4.5 points out of the 12 on offer. But it could have been even easier. Let's hope they won't regret it.

The Tigers, meanwhile, have been far from perfect in their last two games - closer-than-expected wins against Auburn and lower-division Towson.
<br />How the Gators (4-0, 3-0 <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5teWJhc2tldGJhbGxzaG9lc2Zvcm1lbi5jb20v" target="_blank">kobe bryant shoes</a> Southeastern Conference) and Tigers (5-0, 1-0) respond probably will determine who remains undefeated and who is left scrambling in its division race.
<br />&quot;A lot of people still doubt us and don’t really believe in this Florida team,&quot; Gators fullback Hunter Joyer said. &quot;So I think we need to <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uYmFzaG9lc3BhcnR5LmNvbS8_" target="_blank">nba players shoes</a> make a statement this weekend.&quot;
<br />Although Florida already has three conference wins, including two on the road, there are still plenty of questions surrounding coach Will Muschamp’s team.
<br />Will sophomore quarterback Jeff Driskel continue to improve? Can Florida’s offensive line hold up against an elite defensive front? Can the Gators consistently stop <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uYmFiYXNrZXRiYWxsc2hvZXNib3guY29tLw__" target="_blank">basketball shoes sale</a> the run?
<br />LSU manhandled Florida on both lines of scrimmage the last two years, gaining 161 yards on the ground in a 33-29 win in 2010 and then gouging the Gators for 238 yards rushing last season.
<br />&quot;We got beat really bad. Really bad,&quot; Florida defensive tackle Omar Hunter said. &quot;It was a sick feeling.&quot;
<br />And one Muschamp doesn’t <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uYmFzaG9lc2J1c2luZXNzLmNvbS8_" target="_blank">cheap basketball shoes</a> want the Gators to forget.

Ultimately, it was a battle between the Steelers and themselves. The Eagles yet again were in their now-typical offensive form-quarterback Michael Vickfound himself susceptible to pressure and had trouble with ball security, while Pittsburgh's defense spent much of the game carrying the team until injuries made things more difficult. Full Steelers-Eagles highlights. Safety Troy Polamalu, who returned after missing the last two games with a calf injury, re-injured the calf in the first quarter and was replaced by Ryan Mundy, whose impact-yet again-was mostly negative. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uYmFzaG9lc2J1c2luZXNzLmNvbS8_" target="_blank">nba shoes</a> Linebacker LaMarr Woodley also left the game with a hamstring injury, something that bothered him last season. In the first half, most notably, the Steelers defense was impressive. Linebacker Lawrence Timmons was that unit's leader, with nine tackles (two for a loss) and two quarterback hits on the day. James Harrison, who made his regular-season debut after undergoing knee surgery during the summer, had a respectable pair of tackles and two hits on Vick. All told, the Steelers forced four fumbles on the day, with three of them recovered by Pittsburgh-two turnovers by Vick and one by DeSean Jackson. Vick was also sacked three times. Michael Vick's second fumble. On offense, Pittsburgh mostly struggled. Quarterback Ben Roethlisberger wasn't under duress-he wasn't sacked at all-but good coverage by the Eagles' secondary <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5teWJhc2tldGJhbGxzaG9lc2Zvcm1lbi5jb20v" target="_blank">basketball shoes for men</a> combined with poor accuracy resulted in him going 21-of-37 for 207 yards and no scores. Steelers receiver Mike Wallace was held to just two catches on eight targets for 17 yards; the receptions were confined to the first half. Emmanuel Sanders had seven targets and three catches for 22 yards, Antonio Brown was thrown to 10 times, with seven receptions and 86 yards and the ever-reliable Heath Miller caught four of the five passes tossed his way for a total of 41 yards. On offense, Pittsburgh's star of the game was running back Rashard Mendenhall, who saw his first action since tearing his ACL in Week 17 of last season. Mendenhall had 81 yards and a touchdown on 14 carries as well as two catches for 20 yards. Mendenhall's 13-yard touchdown run. For the first time this season, a Steelers running back notched a legitimately good yards-per-carry average. At 5.8, he nearly doubled the efforts of <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uYmFzaG9lc3BhcnR5LmNvbS8_" target="_blank">nba shoes</a> Isaac Redman and Jonathan Dwyer in the previous three games. Mendenhall looked decisive and fast, showing no sign of the injury that felled him in January. He was able to make something out of nothing-practically his career calling card-and made the Steelers' terrible run-blocking offensive line finally look like less of a liability. He even outshined his Eagles counterpart, LeSean McCoy. Pittsburgh, knowing full well that its defense hasn't been as strong as it's typically been against the rush, stepped up and held McCoy to only 53 yards on 16 carries; Vick, too, was contained, breaking off just five runs for 16 yards. Stylistically, it wasn't the best showing for the Steelers, particularly on offense. Miscues resulted in Roethlisberger failing to hit his receivers, and there were few, if any, deep shots taken down the field despite finally having a successful run game and a reason to utilize more play-action passing. Suisham's last-second field goal led to the Steelers' win this week, not late-game heroics from Roethlisberger. Justin K. Aller/Getty Images As such, the game came down not to Roethlisberger's arm and playmaking abilities, but the leg of kicker Shaun Suisham, who hit the game-winning field goal in the final seconds to lift the Steelers to a 16-14 win and a 2-2 record on the year. While the concern <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uYmFiYXNrZXRiYWxsc2hvZXNib3guY29tLw__" target="_blank">basketball shoes</a> about the Steelers' ability to run the ball has begun to wane after seeing Mendenhall's performance this week, it now rises again about their defense, with Woodley's and Polamalu's injuries taking center stage in a short week. The Steelers take on the Tennessee Titans on Thursday night and may easily be without the two important starters for that game and beyond. If it's not one thing for Pittsburgh, it's another: The run game gets back on track, but the defense deals with more injuries; the defense still manages to step up, but Roethlisberger cannot capitalize. On and on it seems to go this season. At the very least, the Steelers managed to hold on for a home win in Week 5 before having to very quickly prepare to leave town and face the one-win Titans. With the bye week behind them, there's only the next game ahead. Follow @FBALL_Andrea

RB Ryan Williams needs surgery on his shoulder and is out for the season, Whiz said. - Darren Urban (@Cardschatter) October 8, 2012 With Beanie Wells out on IR at least until Week 12 (h/t Rotoworld.com) and Williams gone for the season, Smith is one of three running backs the Cardinals currently have <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uYmFzaG9lc2J1c2luZXNzLmNvbS8_" target="_blank">basketball shoes</a> on their active roster. At this time, though, Smith is the team's lowest-ranked running back on the depth chart (h/t OurLads.com). Let's take a look at what Smith brings to the table. Profile Smith is a little-known, undrafted running back out of Kentucky who has not made much noise at either the college level or as a pro. In his four years at Kentucky, Smith only rushed for 957 yards with eight touchdowns and caught 30 passes for 322 yards and two touchdowns. ESPN.com's Insider scouting report on Smith reads: He shows adequate initial quickness and <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5teWJhc2tldGJhbGxzaG9lc2Zvcm1lbi5jb20v" target="_blank">lebron james shoes</a> agility with average burst when hitting the hole, and good vision once he gets past the first level. He is a patient runner that lets the hole develop, but lacks the explosive burst to cause defenders to take bad angles once he gets through the hole. He tends to run a bit upright and does not break a lot of tackles or gain a lot of yards after initial contact. Since entering the NFL as an undrafted rookie in 2010, Smith has rushed for 102 yards on 30 carries (3.4 yards per carry) and one touchdown. Fantasy Outlook LaRod Stevens-Howling is the team's No. 1 running back now. Christian Petersen/Getty Images Smith currently resides on the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uYmFiYXNrZXRiYWxsc2hvZXNib3guY29tLw__" target="_blank">new basketball shoes</a> outside looking in on the Cardinals depth chart. He currently is listed behind LaRod Stevens-Howling and William Powell, and given his lack of experience as a pro, it's not likely that he's going to suddenly emerge atop the depth chart any time soon. That said, if Stevens-Howling and Powell can't get anything done on the ground, head coach Ken Whisenhunt may have no other choice but to give the untested journeyman a crack at getting the team's anemic running game going. Through five games, the Cardinals are near the bottom of the rankings in terms of rushing the football, averaging a mere 63.4 yards per game. Only the Oakland Raiders have been worse this season. Perhaps Week 6 will improve their shoddy rushing totals, as the Cardinals host the Buffalo Bills-the same team that allowed 311 rushing yards to the San Francisco 49ers. After that, it doesn't look good for Smith or any other Cardinals running back, with contests against the Minnesota Vikings in <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uYmFzaG9lc3BhcnR5LmNvbS8_" target="_blank">cheap nba shoes</a> Week 7 (No. 6 in NFL in yards per game) and the 49ers in Week 8 (No. 7 in NFL in yards per game). Analysis Don't expect Smith to become a fantasy hero any time soon. The Cardinals offensive line is a mess, and it would be tough for Barry Sanders in his prime to put up respectable numbers behind this group. Smith is still the low man on the totem pole for the Cards, too. If he's pressed into duty, it's not necessarily a good thing for the team. Stay away from any inkling of an idea to claim Smith off waivers. He isn't the answer to your fantasy problems. Follow me on Twitter @JesseReed78

Ronaldo hurt his left shoulder <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uYmFiYXNrZXRiYWxsc2hvZXNib3guY29tLw__" target="_blank">basketball shoes sale</a> attempting an overhead kick in the second half of Sunday's 2-2 La Liga draw at Barcelona and although he appeared in some discomfort he played on until the end of match. &quot;The Real Madrid forward was examined by club medical staff at his home this morning and <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uYmFzaG9lc3BhcnR5LmNvbS8_" target="_blank">nba players shoes</a> a serious injury was ruled out so further tests at a hospital are not necessary,&quot; Real said in a statement on their website (<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.realmadrid.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.realmadrid.com</a>). &quot;Real Madrid have already informed the Portuguese football federation of Cristiano Ronaldo's situation and he can join up with his national team in Obidos,&quot; the statement added. Ronaldo would remain under observation but should be available <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5teWJhc2tldGJhbGxzaG9lc2Zvcm1lbi5jb20v" target="_blank">kobe bryant shoes</a> for Portugal's World Cup 2014 Group F qualifiers away to Russia on Friday and at home to Northern Ireland four days later, Real said. Ronaldo turned in another imperious display against Barca, netting twice to become the first player to score in six consecutive 'Clasicos' against Real's arch rivals. Barca's World Player of the Year Lionel Messi also netted a double as the pair continued their personal goal-scoring duel in a thrilling clash at the Nou Camp. &quot;I have only admiration for him,&quot; Real director Emilio Butragueno said of Ronaldo in a post-match interview <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uYmFzaG9lc2J1c2luZXNzLmNvbS8_" target="_blank">cheap basketball shoes</a> with Spanish TV. &quot;He is a born winner and he wanted to finish the game despite being in pain,&quot; the former Real and Spain striker added. &quot;Few players bring so much to a team as he is doing.&quot; Ronaldo, the world's most expensive player, appears to have put behind him a period early in the season where he refused to celebrate his goals and admitted to feeling &quot;sad&quot; without specifying why. Unsourced reports in local media suggested he wanted more money and he was linked with a move away from the Spanish capital to clubs including big-spending Paris St Germain.

Greg Little was supposed to be the top guy, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uYmFiYXNrZXRiYWxsc2hvZXNib3guY29tLw__" target="_blank">basketball shoes</a> but he lost all his stick-um and can't catch a pass, so there's opening for a legitimate downfield threat in the Browns' offense. Gordon had a strong showing against the New York Giants in Week 5, including <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uYmFzaG9lc3BhcnR5LmNvbS8_" target="_blank">nba shoes</a> a 62-yard touchdown reception. Let's break down his fantasy outlook and projections moving forward: Fantasy Outlook Brandon Weeden needs a &quot;go-to guy&quot;. Little does not want the job, Mohamed Massaquoi and Josh Cribbs aren't capable of assuming the role and no else on the depth chart has the skill of Gordon. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5teWJhc2tldGJhbGxzaG9lc2Zvcm1lbi5jb20v" target="_blank">basketball shoes for men</a> Who Will Finish The Season With More Receiving Yards? Who Will Finish The Season With More Receiving Yards? Josh Gordon77.2% Greg Little11.3% Mohamed Massaquoi11.5% Total votes: 364 As Weeden gets more comfortable in the pocket and improves his deep-ball accuracy, Gordon's fantasy output could get consistently better.Expecting two touchdowns every week out of any Browns player is asking far too much, but the former Baylor Bear could easily be looked to for 6-9 catches and 70 yards per game. He is a big, strong and physical <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uYmFzaG9lc2J1c2luZXNzLmNvbS8_" target="_blank">nba shoes</a> wideout at 6'3&quot; 225 pounds, and has the type of speed required to be a legitimate vertical threat.Gordon is still somewhat raw, but he is going to demand playing time, especially in a Cleveland offense lacking quality talent. Gordon is not worthy of being a WR1 or WR2 just yet, but as a WR3 or FLEX he is an intriguing proposition.Definitely pick him up and see what happens next week against the Cincinnati Bengals. Projections Cleveland is not going to become a prolific passing offense at any point this season. Trent Richardson is going to carry the bulk of the offensive burden and hopefully Weeden can make enough plays to keep the Browns in ball games. Gordon can help with that. Weeden is going to continue to try getting him the ball, and with the failures of Little, his numbers will be solid the rest of the way.Gordon is an emerging talent on an offense that needs his skill set. Touchdowns will be hard to consistently produce, but catches and yards may be headed his way in bunches. Projected Season Totals: 60 REC, 725 YDS, 7 TDS

They had been winning close games all year long, and because of their ability to do that, they snuck into the playoffs and grabbed home-field advantage for the ALDS. But now, they are down 0-2 and on the brink of elimination. Detroit shocked Oakland <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uYmFiYXNrZXRiYWxsc2hvZXNib3guY29tLw__" target="_blank">new basketball shoes</a> with a 5-4 win on Sunday, as a walk-off sacrifice fly from utility player Don Kelly sent Comerica Park into a frenzy and the A’s into a state of frustration. The situation isn’t good for Oakland, which now needs to win three consecutive home games. Yes, they did it at home against the Rangers to finish the season. However, they have to <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uYmFzaG9lc2J1c2luZXNzLmNvbS8_" target="_blank">basketball shoes</a> face Cy Young favorite Justin Verlander in Game 5, strikeout king Max Scherzer in Game 4 and Anibal Sanchez in Game 3. Sanchez is inconsistent, but he can be dominant. You can look at it from that perspective and have a pessimistic view about Oakland’s chances to bounce back and win the series. Or, you can look at it from their point of view. Jarrod Parker will pitch again, Tommy Milone could pitch from the bullpen in a potential Game 5, Brett Anderson will <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5teWJhc2tldGJhbGxzaG9lc2Zvcm1lbi5jb20v" target="_blank">lebron james shoes</a> be back, and A.J Griffin will make a start. Griffin struggled in his last outing, and he had problems in two previous outings as well. However, Oakland has picked him up, and he’s had time to dwell on his mistakes from the regular season finale. Anderson bounced back from an injury by pitching very well, and A’s fans have to feel confident about him. Anderson went 4-2 with a 2.57 ERA in a brief span in the majors, before another injury slowed him down. Now, he has a chance to best the erratic Sanchez, eject any chances of a sweep for the Tigers and start another miracle at the Coliseum. Sanchez is 9-13 with an ERA near 4.00, while Anderson has enjoyed much more success. Are The A's Doomed? Are The A's Doomed? Yes0% No0% Total votes: 0 Griffin will need to deliver, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uYmFzaG9lc3BhcnR5LmNvbS8_" target="_blank">cheap nba shoes</a> too. He is facing Max Scherzer, who strikes out batters with ease and has dissected top-notch offenses often. But he’s had injury problems of his own, and Oakland has a good offense. Parker starts Game 5, and he is pitching well despite lacking his best stuff. Verlander’s pitch count ballooned quickly against Oakland in Game 1, as the A’s were patient at the plate and able to find some success against Verlander. They only scored one run, but they missed chances to score many more. Oakland hasn’t been getting breaks in this series. Coco Crisp, known for slick fielding and lack of errors, made a costly error on a tough play that cost the A’s two runs. Ryan Cook, Sean Doolittle and Grant Balfour all collapsed, costing the A’s Game 2. Brandon Moss and Josh Donaldson just missed home runs in Game 1, costing Oakland a chance at winning that game. In the playoffs, everything resets. The ball bounced Detroit’s way in Game 1, and the same thing happened in the second game. You can’t say that the A’s are due for some lucky breaks and leave it at that, expecting luck to propel them to the ALCS. But you can still believe in the A’s, and you should. The odds are stacked against them, but they know how it feels to be pushed to the brink. Their offense isn’t performing horribly, and they still have a great bullpen. Even though the results aren’t there, the A’s haven’t been a bad team in the playoffs. Bob Melvin’s approach and Oakland’s demeanor will be key. They don’t focus on winning three games. They take each game at a time, and they never give up. Oakland’s offense is capable of rallying, and their bullpen is capable of holding leads. And now that they know how it feels to be down 2-0 in the playoffs, you can expect them to rebound. They may not win the series, but they will make it interesting.

(AP) - The Atlanta Falcons are in uncharted territory. Then again, this is starting to feel downright routine. Since Mike Smith took over as head coach in 2008, the Falcons are tied for the second-most wins in the regular season, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uYmFzaG9lc3BhcnR5LmNvbS8_" target="_blank">nba players shoes</a> their 48-21 record surpassed only by the New England Patriots (51-18). With Atlanta (5-0) off to the best start in franchise history, Smith is just one victory away from tying Dan Reeves as the winningest coach in team history. Atlanta Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan congratulates wide receiver Julio Jones on his touchdown during the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5teWJhc2tldGJhbGxzaG9lc2Zvcm1lbi5jb20v" target="_blank">kobe bryant shoes</a> second half of an NFL football game in Landover, Md., Sunday, Oct. 7, 2012. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh) Multimedia Photoview all photos Article Gallery: Falcons 5-0 for 1st time, but winning now routine The Falcons host the Oakland Raiders (1-3) on Sunday. &quot;We want to sustain this not just from game to game, but season to season,&quot; Smith said Monday. &quot;We want to be a relevant football team in the months of December and January. That's what we <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uYmFzaG9lc2J1c2luZXNzLmNvbS8_" target="_blank">cheap basketball shoes</a> really want to do as an organization.&quot; When it comes to constructing the roster, the credit goes largely to general manager Thomas Dimitroff, who also came aboard in 2008. He is already recognized as one of the league's top personnel gurus, having relied mainly on the draft to rebuild the Falcons but supplementing his picks with some timely free-agent signings and trades. Once they take the field, the Falcons take on the personality of their coach. Smith is steady as can be during the week, instilling a sense of calm and purpose in his team, but he can turn fiery on Sundays. The team seems to feed off his energy. &quot;During the week, we try to be even-keeled,&quot; Smith said. &quot;You've got to go through your preparations as a coaching staff and as a team. Then, you go play with <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uYmFiYXNrZXRiYWxsc2hvZXNib3guY29tLw__" target="_blank">basketball shoes sale</a> emotion on game days. The guys do a really good job of that.&quot; After cruising through their first three wins, the Falcons have showed plenty of resiliency the past two weeks with second-half comebacks. They beat Carolina on a last-second field goal and knocked off Washington 24-17 behind another big game from quarterback Matt Ryan, who is looking more and more like the early favorite in the MVP race. Smith traditionally lets his players take Monday off when they win, but he estimated that at least 80 percent of the team turned up at the training complex after beating the Redskins. &quot;They're visiting with their coaches and wanting to talk about certain things, more about the things they did poorly than the things they did good,&quot; Smith said. &quot;When you have guys doing that, it takes care of itself. We have great leaders in the locker room who make sure we focus on the task at hand. Right now, it's just a start. Yes, we may be 5-0 for the first time in franchise history. But it's just a start, guys, just a start.&quot; Ryan is the league's second-rated passer, behind San Francisco's Alex Smith, and no one has been more important to their team through the first five weeks. The Falcons quarterback is completing more than 68 percent of his attempts, accounting for 1,507 yards with 13 touchdowns and only three interceptions. &quot;Matt has really matured and stepped up his game,&quot; Smith said. &quot;He has a very good idea of how guys are trying to defend us. If there's something we haven't seen, he goes over and looks at the pictures and - boom -he's got it. The next time he sees that, he knows where to go with the football. He knows how to get us into the right play. He's playing with a lot of confidence and distributing the ball to multiple players.&quot; Washington's defense was determined not to get beat on deep throws to the Falcons' dynamic receiving duo of Roddy White and Julio Jones. So Ryan kept going to ageless tight end Tony Gonzalez, who caught 13 passes for 123 yards and a touchdown. Not bad for a 36-year-old who will likely be retiring at the end of the season. &quot;Every time we threw the ball deep over the middle to (White and Jones), there were two or three guys around them,&quot; Gonzalez said. &quot;That means I'm getting man-to-man coverage underneath. I've told you guys since I got here that ... if I get man coverage, I should be able to get open most of the time.&quot; Ryan completed 34 of 52 passes for 345 yards and a pair of touchdowns, shaking off a brilliant play by Washington linebacker Ryan Kerrigan, who picked off a little screen pass early in the second quarter and returned it 28 yards for a touchdown. Maybe it helps that Ryan was not around for this franchise's largely forgettable history. Before 2008, Atlanta had never even put together consecutive winning records, truly one of the most remarkable runs of ineptitude in any sport. Since arriving the same year as Dimitroff and Smith, Ryan has been part of four straight winning seasons. The only thing marring these new-look Falcons is playoff success. They are 0-3 in the postseason under the current regime. It's a little too soon to be thinking playoffs, even though the Falcons might clinch the NFC South by Thanksgiving at the rate they're going. &quot;It is a great start for us, it really is,&quot; Ryan said. &quot;At this point, you can't really worry about what is going on in the history of our organization, but we have put ourselves right where we need to be five games into it.&quot; ___ Follow Paul Newberry on Twitter at <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.twitter.com%2Fpnewberry1963"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.twitter.com/pnewberry1963</a>

<br />Season: 43-34
<br />Sunday's games
<br />Cowboys (2-2) at Ravens (4-1), noon
<br />Line: Ravens by 3.5. Over/under: 44.5.
<br />Ravens have won 13 in a row at home and should break out of last week's offensive doldrums, especially <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5teWJhc2tldGJhbGxzaG9lc2Zvcm1lbi5jb20v" target="_blank">basketball shoes for men</a> with how often Cowboys turn over ball.
<br />Pick: Ravens 20, Cowboys 17.
<br />Rams (3-2) at Dolphins (2-3), noon
<br />Line: Dolphins by 4. Over/under: 38.
<br />Tough one for Rams, especially with no Danny Amendola and the way Dolphins stop <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uYmFiYXNrZXRiYWxsc2hvZXNib3guY29tLw__" target="_blank">basketball shoes</a> run. If Miami can limit turnovers, it will hold on to win.

<br />Line: Eagles by 3.5. Over/under: 47.5.

<br />Pick: Eagles 28, Lions 20.
<br />Raiders (1-3) at Falcons (5-0), noon
<br />Line: Falcons by 10.5. Over/under: 48.5.
<br />Two statistics jump out: Raiders have converted 28 percent of third downs, and they're allowing league-worst 53 percent. That won't <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uYmFzaG9lc3BhcnR5LmNvbS8_" target="_blank">nba shoes</a> work vs. Falcons.

The first sentence of the AP release? It's another umpiring call that went the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uYmFiYXNrZXRiYWxsc2hvZXNib3guY29tLw__" target="_blank">new basketball shoes</a> St. Louis Cardinals [sic] way this postseason. Ah, there's the rub. Implying that umpires, referees, judges and other sports officials are conspiring for or against certain teams is nothing new as fans often blame a team's misfortune on an impartial third party. As Ipreviously wrote, scapegoating is nothing new with multiple field experts concluding that passing the buck and blaming others is a psychological defense mechanism meant to shield oneself from acknowledgement <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uYmFzaG9lc3BhcnR5LmNvbS8_" target="_blank">cheap nba shoes</a> of an unacceptable truth. During Game 3 of the Giants-Reds NLDS, Twitter's Evil Umpire (DarkSide_Umpire) pointed out this simple fact of scapegoating in practice, locating one Cincinnati and one San Francisco fan with completely identical-yet opposite-views of home plate umpire Gerry Davis' performance: I'd like the two of you to meet. aaronc0116 This umpire must be from San Francisco! keani_yafreak This umpire is a m'fing Reds fan... - Evil Umpire (DarkSide_Umpire) October 9, 2012 Yes, people enjoy a good controversy-especially those resembling the classic &quot;us against the world&quot; motif. HP Umpire Angel Hernandez declares Yankees baserunner <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5teWJhc2tldGJhbGxzaG9lc2Zvcm1lbi5jb20v" target="_blank">lebron james shoes</a> Ichiro Suzuki &quot;safe&quot; during Game 2 of the 2012 Yankees-Orioles ALDS Rob Carr/Getty Images Even ESPN's highly-cited 20-percent missed statistic is misleading. Upon further inspectionof the data, the entertainment giant determined that only 1.3 calls per game were deemed close enough to merit instant replay review, 20 percent of which amounts to just 0.26 missed calls per nine innings-or a minimum of 55 calls per game (27 outs + 27 outs + 1 run-producing play)-or, multiplied by approximately four to allow for whole-unit analysis, one missed call for every 220 chances. In terms of accuracy, ESPN's data suggests an umpiring crew will correctly officiate 99.55 percent of all non-ball/strike calls. So with the objective data in hand, why point out one missed banger of a call during Wednesday afternoon's 8-0 Cardinals victory and conveniently neglect to mention the umpires' propensity to get most calls right? Though St. Louis was well on its way to a lopsided win at the time <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uYmFzaG9lc2J1c2luZXNzLmNvbS8_" target="_blank">basketball shoes</a> of the call, Joyce's miscue was a perfect storm of controversy, sensationalism and-most importantly-viewer interest. National League Umpire Supervisor Ed Vargo once said, &quot;[Umpires] are expected to be perfect the day [they] start, and then improve.&quot; Society as a whole simply likes watching people-especially &quot;perfect&quot; ones-fail. In 2010, Joyce missed a key ninth-inning call at first base during Tigers pitcher Armando Gallaraga's perfect game attempt. During 2012's National League Wild Card game, left field umpire Sam Holbrook made a contested infield fly call during an Atlanta Braves rally. Though the call was correct, fans' subsequent reactionto the call against their home team provided ample bandwagon material with which to blast MLB for a widely misunderstood rule. And, yes, the Wild Card infield fly rule call benefited the St. Louis Cardinals. Jim Joyce and Armando Galarraga present an award at the 2010 ESPY Awards. Kevin Winter/Getty Images As if to confirm this shameless pursuit of sensationalism, the AP story additionally mentioned both the NL Wild Card infield fly call and Joyce's 2010 imperfect game call, a pattern echoed across the grid Wednesday afternoon-from ESPNto USA Today and Yahoo!-all spurring a series of user comments defaming Joyce, umpires and Major League Baseball. Unfortunately yet predictably,an August 2012 piece regarding Joyce'sadministration of CPRto a Diamondbacks employee suffering cardiac arrest, saving the woman's life, was not mentioned by any of the above outlets on Wednesday-nor, more relevantly, was the fact that Joyce correctly officiated no less than four subsequent close calls that came his way during Game 3. After all, sensationalist sleaze fails-and more importantly, ratings and readership fall-when one begins complimenting the target of attack.

So why has a soccer star like Davids, who won 74 international caps for the Netherlands between 1994 and 2005, decided to become <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uYmFzaG9lc2J1c2luZXNzLmNvbS8_" target="_blank">cheap basketball shoes</a> joint head coach of Barnet, who are currently rock bottom of the lowest tier of professional in England. &quot;I'm happy to explore my possibilities and share my knowledge and experience with Barnet Football Club,&quot; the 39-year-old told the London club's official website. &quot;I am very excited about the challenge ahead.&quot; Mourinho on managing star players Mourinho's press conference antics Mourinho on the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uYmFiYXNrZXRiYWxsc2hvZXNib3guY29tLw__" target="_blank">basketball shoes sale</a> enigma of Balotelli Blog: Does international soccer need a shake up? After a playing career which spanned two decades and saw Davids strut his stuff at the San Siro and the Nou Camp, the one-time midfield dynamo will now be pacing the touchline of Barnet's 6,000-capacity Underhill Stadium in north London. In addition to his coaching responsibilities, Davids also hopes to make a playing return for &quot;The Bees&quot; as soon as possible. Barnet would be <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uYmFzaG9lc3BhcnR5LmNvbS8_" target="_blank">nba players shoes</a> the third English team Davids -- who was nicknamed &quot;The Pitbull&quot; in recognition of his fiesty playing style -- has turned out for following two years with Tottenham Hotspur between 2005 and 2007 and a brief spell with second-tier Crystal Palace in 2010. A spell in English football's lower reaches is in stark contrast to previous stages of Davids' career, following stints with Ajax, AC Milan, Barcelona and Juventus. Read: Vieira questions England players &quot;lack of love&quot; for national team &quot;I am delighted to welcome Edgar to our club,&quot; said Mark Robson, the current Barnet head coach who will now job share with Davids. &quot;His experience as a <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5teWJhc2tldGJhbGxzaG9lc2Zvcm1lbi5jb20v" target="_blank">kobe bryant shoes</a> player throughout his illustrious career will be a massive benefit to all our players and I look forward to forming a strong partnership with him&quot;. Davids is also known for the goggles he sports while playing, a necessity due to him suffering from the eye disease glaucoma. Barnet has spent the majority of its history at the lower end of English football, winning the Conference -- the division immediately below England's top four professional leagues -- on two occasions.

<br /><br />But Weaver lasted only one inning, allowing <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uYmFiYXNrZXRiYWxsc2hvZXNib3guY29tLw__" target="_blank">basketball shoes</a> two runs and two hits in a 12-0 loss to the Seattle Mariners at Safeco Field, departing because of &quot;general fatigue.&quot; Weaver took the loss and closed with a 20-5 record <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uYmFzaG9lc2J1c2luZXNzLmNvbS8_" target="_blank">nba shoes</a> and 2.81 earned-run average.
<br /><br />&quot;You know what? My body just kind of shut down,&quot; Weaver said. &quot;I felt it in the bullpen. My shoulder wasn't feeling up to par. I wanted to give it a go, but I didn't want to push it and have something bad happen and go into the off-season worried. The best thing to <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5teWJhc2tldGJhbGxzaG9lc2Zvcm1lbi5jb20v" target="_blank">basketball shoes for men</a> do was shut it down.&quot;
<br /><br />Weaver has the third-lowest ERA in the league behind Tampa Bay's David Price (2.56) and Detroit's Justin Verlander (2.64), his primary Cy Young competition.
<br /><br />He has a league-low 1.02 WHIP (walks plus hits per innings pitched), .215 batting average against and .266 on-base percentage against. He had 142 strikeouts and 45 walks in 188 2/3 innings. Price (20-5) could have an edge based on his strikeouts (205) and innings pitched (211).
<br /><br />&quot;In my mind, Weaver is the Cy Young winner,&quot; Scioscia said. &quot;If you break down what he's done for our team … he carried us for six weeks. We're not in playoff contention if it wasn't for what Jered did.&quot;
<br /><br />Parting gifts?
<br /><br />Right fielder Torii Hunter closed with a .313 average, 16 homers and 92 runs batted in. At 37, he's the oldest player since Baltimore's Bob Boyd (.318) in 1957 to hit .300 for the first time in his career.
<br /><br />&quot;It's something I've always wanted to do,&quot; Hunter said. &quot;It's very gratifying.&quot;
<br /><br />But will it be his last act as an Angel? Hunter's five-year, $90-million contract has expired. He wants to return, and the Angels want him back, but there are no guarantees, which is probably why several teammates asked Hunter to sign jerseys Wednesday.
<br /><br />&quot;Guess they must know something I don't,&quot; Hunter joked. &quot;Reality is setting in - I'm a free agent. I thought I'd retire here, but I know the business side of it, and if it doesn't work out, I had a lot of fun here. I appreciate the fans, the organization.
<br /><br />&quot;Hopefully, we can get something done, but if not, I understand. They've got a lot of things they've got to clean up before they even think about offering me a deal. If I have to, I'll go elsewhere.&quot;
<br /><br />Short hops
<br /><br />Center fielder Peter Bourjos said he will not undergo surgery on his right hip as he once anticipated this off-season. He is also considering playing winter ball in the Dominican Republic. … Reliever Jason Isringhausen, 40, on whether he will retire: &quot;I'll get ready for spring training like usual. If no one calls, fine.&quot; … Second baseman Howie Kendrick grounded into his 26th double play Wednesday, second-most in the major leagues.

Of course, most Angelenos would take that opportunity in a heartbeat. They'd ask the Lakers star for his autograph. They'd pepper him with questions about the purple and gold. They'd want to pose for pictures.
<br />But this invitation goes beyond that. For the second consecutive year, Bryant is hosting the United Way of Greater Los Angeles' HomeWalk, which is set to take place Nov. 17, beginning at Exposition Park and heading into downtown Los Angeles.
<br />According to the organization, HomeWalk has attracted 28,000 walkers, raised $2.2 million to fight homelessness and funded groups that moved 12,000 people into permanent housing. This year, the foundation launched by Bryant and his wife, Vanessa, will match all walker donations of $100 or more.
<br />&quot;There's a lot of things that we must do in order to eradicate [homelessness] and <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5teWJhc2tldGJhbGxzaG9lc2Zvcm1lbi5jb20v" target="_blank">lebron james shoes</a> take care of the root of the problem,&quot; Bryant said at a recent Lakers practice. &quot;A lot of [the homeless] struggle with addictions and mental health and things of that nature. It's much more than putting a roof on somebody's head. There's a lot that needs to be done and a lot of understanding that needs to go into it. We try to do whatever we can to try to raise awareness for the cause.&quot;
<br /><br />For the last year, Bryant has done just that.
<br />He and his wife launched their self-named foundation in the summer of 2011 and began sponsoring My Friend's Place, a nonprofit resource center on Hollywood Boulevard that offers free emergency services to homeless youth. Within the last year, the facility served 1,741 homeless people by providing shelter, food, clothing, showers, transportation and other services.
<br />Bryant's foundation also provided a grant to <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uYmFzaG9lc2J1c2luZXNzLmNvbS8_" target="_blank">basketball shoes</a> Step On Second, a mental health organization that provides permanent supportive housing for about 1,800 homeless people. The funds are to help the group build eight additional housing units.
<br />Bryant said that this past summer he visited the L.A. Mission and spent the night at skid row, which the Lakers' star considered &quot;the place where dreams just come to die.&quot;
<br />&quot;I learned a lot,&quot; he said. &quot;You go to L.A. Mission and there's a lot of people in there who have had that moment where they hit rock bottom and say it's time for me to make a change for myself because this is where I am and I don't like where I'm at. But you have to get there first. Once you get out of L.A. Mission and go to skid row, they haven't hit that point yet. So it's very difficult to assess what are you <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uYmFzaG9lc3BhcnR5LmNvbS8_" target="_blank">cheap nba shoes</a> going to do for them because they have to help themselves first when they're struggling with those issues.&quot;
<br />With the United Way estimating that Los Angeles County has 51,000 people living without homes, Bryant's work is hardly finished. But he hopes events such as HomeWalk will increase discussion about the issue and build more support for his foundation's cause.
<br />&quot;I would like people first and foremost to be aware of the issue,&quot; Bryant said. &quot;That was step one for me. Become more aware of the issue, learn more about it and how people got in that situation. It varies. Some are there because of discrimination, death in the family and no one took care of them. Others made bad decisions, all of a sudden here they are and need help getting out of that situation.&quot;

She could be another athlete, or a writer, an activist, or even your mom. Leave your suggestions, stories and memories in the comments section below and we'll feature the best on CNN. (CNN) -- The number of women competing in the Paralympic Games has doubled in the last two decades, according to figures released by the International Paralympic Committee. While at the 1992 Barcelona Games only 700 female athletes were involved in events, London will see a record-breaking 1,513 female paralympians take the stage across 18 sports. Tine Teilman, Chairperson of the IPC Women in Sport Committee which helps to raise the profile and involvement of women in Paralympic Sport, said: &quot;It is very encouraging that the number of female participants in the Paralympic Games has doubled during the last 20 years. &quot;I am sure we will see many sportswomen through inspiring and exiting performances become strong role models for others.&quot; CNN has put together a list of eight inspirational women competing in the London 2012 Paralympics. Tatyana McFadden TatyanaMcFadden Country: United States Event: Athletics McFadden, 23, an eight-time world champion and Paralympics multi-medal winner, She was born with spina bifida, which left her paralyzed from the waist down. She spent the first six years of her life in a St Petersburg orphanage -- <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uYmFzaG9lc2J1c2luZXNzLmNvbS8_" target="_blank">cheap basketball shoes</a> where she walked her hands because she didn't have a wheelchair -- before being adopted a visiting American. At 15, she qualified for the Athens games in wheelchair racing as the youngest member of the track and field team. It was her first international competition and she shocked everyone by winning a silver and a bronze. Four years later in Beijing, she picked up three silvers and a bronze. McFadden races in category T54 events, which are among those for athletes who race or throw from a seated position. Paralympic athletics classifications group competitors into classes that allow them to compete against those with similar impairments. Won my FIRST gold medal ever at the games!! have no words to describe this feeling. Thanks for all the wonderful support!!!!!! - Tatyana McFadden (TatyanaMcFadden) Sep 3, 2012 This time she'll be competing in five T54 racing events: 100m, 400m, 800m, 1,500m and the women's marathon. Finally after three Paralympics Games attempts, McFadden won her first gold on day five in London in the 400m T54 race. Sarah Storey MrsSarahStorey Country: Great Britain Event: Cycling The 33-year-old Briton, who was born without fingers on her left hand after her arm was caught in her umbilical cord in the womb, has already picked up two gold medals in track cycling at these games.

She swam at the Paralympics in Atlanta, Sydney and Athens adding 10 more medals to her tally. She <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5teWJhc2tldGJhbGxzaG9lc2Zvcm1lbi5jb20v" target="_blank">kobe bryant shoes</a> switched to cycling in time for the Beijing games, following a serious ear infection in Athens.

Esther Vergeer EstherVergeer Country: Netherlands Event: Wheelchair Tennis There is little doubt about who the hot seed is in women's wheelchair tennis. World number one, Esther Vergeer, 31, has dominated the sport for the last three games. Not to mention her remarkable streak of 465 unbeaten singles matches, which spans almost a decade. Vergeer developed paraplegia when she was eight years old, following spinal surgery. During rehabilitation, she learned to play wheelchair tennis. In 2000, two years after she made her international debut, Vergeer won a place on the Dutch paralympic team for the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uYmFiYXNrZXRiYWxsc2hvZXNib3guY29tLw__" target="_blank">basketball shoes sale</a> Sydney games and went on to win two gold medals. She repeated her impressive accomplishment at Athens in 2004 and in Beijing in 2008, she won gold in the singles event and silver in the doubles. Last year she told Athlete magazine: &quot;If you don't try, it will never happen.&quot; A motto she appears to have taken to heart. On saturday I will be playing 5th match after 11 o'clock.

<br />Gibbons' 38-yarder with 5 seconds remaining in Michigan's 12-10 victory over Michigan State on Saturday returned the Paul Bunyan Trophy to Ann Arbor after a four-year absence. It was one of three kicks Gibbons made Saturday.
<br />Gibbons was aided by a gusting wind that blew the ball inside the right upright <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5teWJhc2tldGJhbGxzaG9lc2Zvcm1lbi5jb20v" target="_blank">basketball shoes for men</a> -- &quot;He was playing the wind,&quot; said holder Drew Dileo -- but hindered by a time-out by Michigan State coach Mark Dantonio as Gibbons lined up for the try -- or so Dantonio thought. Gibbons later would call attempts to ice him &quot;pointless.&quot;
<br />&quot;It really doesn't affect me,&quot; he said.
<br />Unlike Dantonio, Michigan coach Brady Hoke took a more hands-off approach to the final scoring play, a tactic that proved more fruitful. According to Hoke, the best thing you can do as a coach when your kicker is entering a high-pressure situation <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uYmFiYXNrZXRiYWxsc2hvZXNib3guY29tLw__" target="_blank">basketball shoes</a> is have confidence in him.
<br />&quot;I'm not a kicking coach,&quot; Hoke said. &quot;It's like golf. I'm probably a pretty good golfer -- if I were to do it. Those guys know what they need to do and how they need to do it. ... I was just going to watch (Gibbons) do his thing. There's no magic to it.&quot;
<br />Plus, Dileo mentioned how whenever Gibbons lines up for a crucial kick in a practice situation, Hoke is there to mimic an end-of-game strategy like Dantonio's and blow the whistle to make him think about it.
<br />The kick wasn't Gibbons' most important as a <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uYmFzaG9lc2J1c2luZXNzLmNvbS8_" target="_blank">nba shoes</a> Wolverine. His 37-yard game-winner against Virginia Tech last year brought more than a rivalry trophy to Ann Arbor -- it brought back a BCS bowl championship in the Sugar Bowl.
<br />On that attempt, Gibbons famously confessed after the game that he had &quot;brunette girls&quot; on the mind when he was getting ready to kick.
<br />But against the Spartans, the redshirt junior had something a little more sentimental on his mind -- his senior class.
<br />&quot;There are no flashbacks&quot; to the Sugar Bowl, Gibbons said. &quot;You just go out there and try to win the game for the seniors and bring Paul back. I was thinking about the seniors ... and winning a Big Ten championship for them.&quot;
<br />Michigan fans have Gibbons' leg and Hoke's faith in it <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uYmFzaG9lc3BhcnR5LmNvbS8_" target="_blank">nba shoes</a> to thank for the Paul Bunyan Trophy's return to Ann Arbor, as well as the fact that the goal of a Big Ten championship is very much alive.

Brees, meanwhile, continued the stellar play the Saints (2-4) are counting on getting from him to turn their season around following <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5teWJhc2tldGJhbGxzaG9lc2Zvcm1lbi5jb20v" target="_blank">kobe bryant shoes</a> an 0-4 start. Brees extended his NFL record for consecutive games with at least one TD pass to 49, while leading long scoring drives on four straight possessions to turn a 14-point deficit into a 28-21 halftime lead. Vilma was very business-like, answering questions while getting dressed in the New Orleans locker room. He said he wasn’t sure how many snaps he played, but that he felt fine and believed he was in good enough condition to play an entire game. The veteran linebacker said he had always believed he’d get an opportunity to play this season. “Most people didn’t, but it was a long, drawn-out process, and for good or bad, it ended up this way and I was <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uYmFiYXNrZXRiYWxsc2hvZXNib3guY29tLw__" target="_blank">basketball shoes sale</a> able to be back on the field with my teammates. That was a great feeling,” Vilma said. “I talked to the team last night. I don’t really want to get into it,” Vilma added. “I think my talk, hopefully it worked since we won today.” The Saints (2-4) barely had the ball in the third quarter, but took advantage of Tampa Bay’s inability to get into the end zone when Brees put together a 12-play, 95-yard march that Pierre Thomas finished with a 5-yard TD run that made it 35-21 with just over 13 minutes remaining in the game. Brees threw TD passes of 17 yards to Marques Colston, 9 yards to Darren Sproles, 48 yards to Joseph Morgan and 20 <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uYmFzaG9lc3BhcnR5LmNvbS8_" target="_blank">nba players shoes</a> yards to David Thomas to overcome the New Orleans defense yielding 513 yards. He has thrown for three or more touchdowns in five of six games this season. “We want to get on a streak here. You’ve got to win more than one before you’re on a streak,” Brees said. “So now we’ve got two, and we want to keep that going.” Josh Freeman threw for a career-high 420 yards and three touchdowns for the Bucs (2-4), who scored on their first three possessions of the game to build a 21-7 lead. Dallas Clark’s 3-yard scoring reception trimmed Tampa Bay’s deficit to 35-28 with four minutes left, and Freeman completed two passes to Vincent Jackson to help the Bucs get into position to possibly <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uYmFzaG9lc2J1c2luZXNzLmNvbS8_" target="_blank">cheap basketball shoes</a> force overtime.
