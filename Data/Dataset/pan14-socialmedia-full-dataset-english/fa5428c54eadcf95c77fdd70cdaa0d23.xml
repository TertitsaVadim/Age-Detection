You've worked eight hours a day six days a week, and sometimes 7 days a week. Why not give yourself a break? You deserve a wonderful, relaxing and pleasant vacation. This summer spend quality time with your family and have a blast! It is a great way of bonding with your loved ones and to make up for the time you spent away from home on business trips and conventions.<br /><br />I have listed here few top spots in Asia where you can spend your summer to de-stress, meet new people, learn different culture, have fun and unleash the kid within you. I found that this page explained this incredibly on this <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Faskbusinesses.com%2F400%2Fdebate-ethics-business-countries-totalitatian-goverments%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://askbusinesses.com/400/debate-ethics-business-countries-totalitatian-goverments/</a>  webpage.<br /><br />1.	Singapore - The Lion City is one of the cleanest and greenest city in Asia. It is a developed country but unpolluted. If you enjoy being at peace with nature then this is definitely your haven. Singapore is not only known for its virgin forests and wildlife animals but also for their shopping centers and street market which are most visited by many shopaholics. One resort island that is known worldwide is the Sentosa where there are many rides that could take your breath away and an underwater world with over 2500 species of sea creatures waiting for people to visit them.<br /><br />2.	India - who would not want to see the Taj Mahal? Aside from that beautiful Taj Mahal India has so much more to offer for everybody. If you enjoy spending time on the beach then India is the best place for you to go; they have beautiful blue water, white sand beaches lined with palm trees. If you want to have time to seek 'yourself' and reflect on your life then spending a couple of days in India's beautiful mountains with nothing but nature around you.<br /><br />3.	Hong Kong - Want to de-stress by shopping? Some people, mostly women, shop to relieve stress from work, family and finances and there is no other place like Hong Kong when it comes to shopping. For those who find joy and fulfillment in shopping Hong Kong is a dreamland that could bring bliss.<br /><br />There is no better time to take a break from your usual cycle in life but NOW!

On the popular American show &quot;Friends&quot; one of the characters (Ross) tries to impress a cute girl by attempting to play rugby. Sadly, Ross knew almost nothing about rugby and he ends up getting injured. The cute girl then has to tend to Ross while he is in the hospital.<br /><br />The history of rugby is usually a bit muddled, with different historians plus rugby clubs believing different versions belonging to the origination of rugby. Many historians believe that rugby and soccer came and developed down different paths all along. Others assume that rugby came from football. To them, William Webb Ellis started out rugby when he was a student at Rugby University in 1823. During a game of soccer, it is believed that he grabbed the ball and ran with it. Although this was against the rules at the moment, other players saw the appeal also and it became more common while in games. This tale is not really substantiated, but it is widely held to be true. In fact, the rugby world cup is called the &quot;William Webb Ellis Trophy.&quot;<br /><br />Not everyone was thrilled with this addition to football, and official it was voted against at the Freemason's Tavern, in London. This caused a division in teams who were for running with the ball and those that weren't. Two separate sports evolved with this meeting. I found that this weblog demonstrated this well on this <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fdebtask.com%2F2174%2Frevised-america-debt-fact-printing-press-money%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://debtask.com/2174/revised-america-debt-fact-printing-press-money/</a> blog post.<br /><br />It wasn't until 1845 that rugby got its first number of rules. Three rugby clubs cooperated and created a set of rules that they would follow. Not all clubs chose to abide by these new regulations and rugby remained somewhat informal until 1870. The formality came with the Rugby Basketball Union which cleaned up the game a tad and cut out a few of the overly aggressive moves. A year later, the Rugby Football Union created the 59 Laws belonging to the Game. In 1871, Scottish rugby players stunted the English rugby players to somewhat of a match (with Scotland gradually winning). By 1880 other nations had established rules for rugby clubs.<br /><br />Rugby became a paying sport while in the 1890s. Though rugby players were not supposed to be paid, according to the rules belonging to the Rugby Football Union, one club was paying players who missed work to experience &quot;broken time&quot; wages. The particular club was suspended, including a meeting ensued which took twenty-two clubs to secede the Rugby Football Union. These people formed the Northern Partnership, which would eventually turn into the Rugby League. This new union adjusted the rules and quantity of players to draw more spectators, further separating the Rugby Football Union through the Rugby League.<br /><br />Rugby was first played in the US in 1874. The game was Harvard against McGill University. It remained well-liked in the united states until 1924, when it had been cut from the Olympics. Recently, it has started to turn popular once again (though it's popularity never really waned while in the European countries).

They simply do not understand what they are watching. It is not like football as the action is on-going and it is a rough sport, certainly not for the weak. Many believe this is why the French are not so good at it? Although let's not pick on the French, as the Americans do not play rugby either. Yet, it is sort of an American Type of sport in a way, as we like to play rough. I found that this webmaster described this really well on this <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Faskexercise.com%2F2589%2Fgood-exercise-equipment-buy-burn-lot-calories-small%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://askexercise.com/2589/good-exercise-equipment-buy-burn-lot-calories-small/</a> web site.<br /><br />The truth is whether or not Americans understand the sport of rugby is rather irrelevant because Rugby is not played in America anyway. I believe Americans should play rugby, because unlike Football there are no time outs to catch your breath and believe me when I tell you that; Rugby is Not a Sport for the Weak!<br /><br />In the United States our Professional Football Players dress up in lots of pads and get paid huge amounts of money plus lots of endorsements and they expend massive brawn for a few seconds and the play ends. Although people call them superior athletes few of them could run a marathon. Rugby players on the other hand are severely under padded and under paid by our standards and they are in top shapes as they truly are top athletes. Consider all this in 2006.

Court sports such as basketball, racquetball and tennis present unique problems for athletes, whether they're professionals or weekend warriors. But preparation and common sense go a long way toward prevention.<br /><br />Hard surfaces and sports calling for fast, lateral movements are two characteristics of indoor sports that can contribute to injuries. One of the most frequently encountered court injuries is the common ankle sprain, due to the lateral aspect of those sports and, especially in basketball, the potential for stepping on a competitor's foot.<br /><br />Other court injuries are more too much shock-related stress, such as stress fractures in the foot or tibia. Stress fractures can be hard to detect and many times people with stress fractures will continue to play and delay the correct diagnosis. I found that this person showed this amazingly on this <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fmicrowavesreviews.net%2F355%2Fwater-exposed-infrared-radiation-wavelength-2-6%25c3%259710%25e2%2588%25924-assume-radiation-absorbed%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://microwavesreviews.net/355/water-exposed-infrared-radiation-wavelength-2-6%c3%9710%e2%88%924-assume-radiation-absorbed/</a> post.<br /><br />The most frequent site for a stress fracture is the metatarsal bone, and in these fractures there can be a lot of swelling in the forefoot. But stress fractures can occur in any of the 26 bones of the foot without severe symptoms. Some are more common than others, but all of them can happen in court sports. In the stronger, more dense area of the mid-foot, stress fractures can take a long time to diagnose, and if not properly diagnosed, can lead to devastating consequences. Whether competing in court sports on an organized level or in everyday use, the foot should not hurt. If pain persists, consult a foot and ankle surgeon.<br /><br />Another common injury site is the heel. Persistent heel pain can be a plantar fascia injury or a heel spur. The plantar fascia is a thin, very strong tissue band that supports the arch of the foot, stretching from the heel to the ball of the foot. As the arch falls, the band of tissue is under increasing tension and the weakest link is where the tissue attaches to the bottom of the heel. Over time and with repeated shocks, micro-events can occur and cause the fascia to tear from the heel, resulting in bone spurs.<br /><br />Ninety-nine percent of the time, conservative care is effective in relieving painful heels. For the few who don't respond, surgery may be considered. Foot and ankle surgeons frequently see injuries to the Achilles tendon and other tendons about the ankle that often could be prevented. Achilles and calf stretching can go a long way toward prevention. A ruptured Achilles tendon requires surgery and is very common in older athletes who aren't flexible and don't warm-up.<br /><br />For a gentle stretching of the lower extremities and the Achilles tendon, lean against a table or wall, placing one foot behind the other. Point the toes slightly inward and roll the ankle toward the outside. Gently lean forward and feel the stretch high up into the calf muscle. Always roll the weight to the outside border of the foot and never stretch to the point of producing pain.<br /><br />Additional tips include:<br /><br />1. Buy new, quality athletic shoes and replace them frequently (at least every 6 months).<br />2. Have the proper footgear for the sport; running shoes are not what you shold be wearing for sports such as basketball due to their lack of lateral support.<br />3. Seek appropriate arch support; flat and high arches often call for custom-made orthotics in shoes.<br />4. Avoid too much, too hard, and too soon syndrome; start slowly to transition between activities or the stress will take you out of the game quickly.<br />5. In children, be aware of the potential for injuries of the growth plate in the heel. Persistent heel pain is more than simple overuse; kids should stop participation immediately and a diagnosis should be sought. Boys and girls often go from soccer season right into basketball and the collective shock from running and the pull of the Achilles can cause growth plate damage.<br /><br />Start your winter sports season off without a bang! Follow these tips and try to avoid the common pitfalls associated with indoor sports.

Many of these folks are enjoying this weather from the comfort of their own homes, peering out their windows. Perhaps they are cuddled up sitting by the fire enjoying a good book or a favorite movie. Then there are the people who are outside in this inclement weather, whether it be by choice or necessity, and who need to have the best gear to keep them warm and dry. Muck arctic sport boots would qualify as a very high quality, durable, warm and waterproof choice when you are faced with these circumstances. I found that this website explained this amazingly on this  post.<br /><br />When choosing to be outside in the cold, wet weather, to enjoy ice fishing, hunting, snowmobiling and other adventurous outdoor activities, you need warm, dry feet. And, if you are required to work in the outdoors during the cold, wet winter months, you also need the best footwear. Nothing kills a great day of fun or a productive day of work faster than cold, wet feet. These cold weather arctic sport boots provide terrific protection against the elements.<br /><br />The muck boots arctic boots are well insulated, and rated to keep you plenty warm in temperatures that are well below zero. They are incredibly comfortable, with a form fitting footbed that will adjust perfectly to your own foot and give you the support you need to be on your feet for the long haul. The snug upper fits closely to your calf, sealing warmth in and cold out. And, deep snow is no threat, since these boots are high enough to keep the snow out, even when you are trudging through the drifts.<br /><br />These arctic boots are a practical alternative to other work boots. They adapt well to various weather conditions, work well for either work or play situations, and hold up for years. Mud washes off the full rubber exterior, so they never look like the sloppy work boots hanging around in the corner of your garage. Many of these Arctic Sport wearers find they can actually even wear these boots in public without feeling out of style. They are lightweight enough to walk a distance in, too, without blistering or chafing.

For example, many tennis players come into my gym, which is also a tennis club, and do a few sets of bench press and leave. What they do not realize is that the bench press works the body in a motion that is not used in tennis. How many times have you seen a tennis player push something forward with both hands? Never! I found that this web page explained this smartly on this <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Felectricguitarsreviews.com%2Fguitar-assembly%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://electricguitarsreviews.com/guitar-assembly/</a> weblog.<br /><br />A tennis player, however, might consider doing pec flys because there are many times in tennis where you must extend your hand across your body. A tennis player might also consider doing extensive work on the shoulder joint as everything in tennis involves the shoulder.<br /><br />A football lineman, on the other hand, would probably benefit greatly from an extensive bench press routine. Since a lineman has to constantly push against other linemen, the bench press movement closely mimics something that he will have to do on the field. A pec fly, on the other hand, may be useful to a lineman but not nearly as much as a bench press would be.<br /><br />The bottom line: if you play sports be careful to chose exercises that match what it is you do in that sport to maximize your gains in the gym and your chance at winning. The sportsman who spends the most time doing movements that are similar to what he does on the field has the best chance at winning the game, which is what sports is all about!

		<document id="5311e88c5a5bc4e38874a671bca6553a" url=""><![CDATA[Grip Strength Training Method<br/><br/>Hi my name is Dr. Terry Zachary. I want to talk today about grip strength training methods and making them complete. Grip strength training has actually become a very controversial subject as its popularity begins to increase. It is a large issue in sports, music and ergonomics and has even become a sport of its own now. Grip competitions are fascinating and very exciting. Grip strength competitors are ripping phone books and bending bolts among many other activities. It is something to look into for its entertainment value. Strongman feats date back to the origin of human time. I became interested in hand grip related strength feats after reading the book, &quot;The Mighty Atom.&quot; Strongman feats take amazing determination and dedication. It is good to see the sport showing some momentum.<br /><br />When approaching grip strength training whether for sports, music, or the ergonomic workplace, I see many errors in method. To bring these errors into perspective, it is necessary to know about the four basic muscle groups involved in grip. These are 1) the hand closing muscles, 2) the hand opening muscles, 3) the wrist flexing muscles, and 4) the wrist extending muscles. Rarely do grip strength and hand exercise programs consider all four of these muscle groups, even at elite levels.<br /><br />Most everybody that trains grip strength to any degree utilizes the training of the first group, the hand closing muscles. These are generally considered to be the finger and thumb flexor muscles and adductor muscles. The question then becomes are these muscles trained in proper planes? It is most popular in the current exercise culture to use spring-loaded or coiled resistance devices to train finger flexion. Another method is to use grip handles plus weight, as in kettle balls or bars, etc. These hand exercises (as isolated exercises) can be harmful in the long term, as the hand muscles are trained to work in unnatural or shortened planes, creating static shortened muscles. It is vital to add a device that trains the hand in three dimensional planes that are natural to the fingers.<br /><br />The next most common exercise that people are aware of for grip strength training is wrist flexion. This is quite easy to train in can be done with a weighted can or a dumbbell or even using a wooden dowel and rope with a weight. Many people even incorporate the third most common exercise related to grip which is wrist extension. It is commonly been studied that the grip is strongest when the wrist is in mild extension. For this reason it is obvious that wrist extensor muscles play a part in stabilizing the grip. Wrist extension can be trained using a dumbbell as well as within the wooden dowel with a rope and a weight exercise. I found that this page demonstrated this incredibly on this <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fmortgageask.com%2F1993%2Fchurches-republican-clergy-members-seek-support-president-obamas-faith-based-program%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://mortgageask.com/1993/churches-republican-clergy-members-seek-support-president-obamas-faith-based-program/</a> website.<br /><br />To be clear the &quot;wooden doll with a rope and a weight&quot; is a hand, wrist and forearm exercise and is as simple as it sounds. Find a wooden dowel, tie approximate 3 feet of rope to it, attach a weight and you have an exercise device! Now simply roll the dowel so that the weight is pulled up to the dowel. Then, opposingly, rotate the dowel such that the weight moves back down towards the ground. This exercise isolates the wrist flexor muscles and the wrist extensor muscles well.<br /><br />The exercise that is vital to grip strength and key to the health and balance of the hand, wrist and forearm and that is omitted commonly in grip strength training methods is the fourth group: &quot;the hand opening muscles.&quot; These are mostly made up of finger and thumb extensor muscles, but also abductor muscles. These hand opening muscles are designed to be used when called upon for two functions: the first is obviously to open the hand (when necessary), and the second is to contract in a stabilizing and complementary mode to support the action of the finger flexor muscles. Thus the finger extensor muscles are hugely important in maximizing grip strength in hand wrist and elbow stability.<br /><br />Finger and thumb extensor muscles can easily be trained. Find a hand strengthener that is designed so that the hand muscles can easily be trained in one continuous exercise (open &amp; close), thus creating a convenient exercise for anyone who trains the hand muscles involved in grip and grip strength. The result is strength, balance and healthy blood flow to all of the tissues of the hand, wrist, forearm and elbow. The result is long, strong and balanced tendons and muscles - and a stable hand, wrist &amp; elbow.<br /><br />Traditionally, extensor muscles were trained using elastic bands, but therapists found it very difficult to isolate each finger extensor muscle making the exercise virtually useless. Therapists also found that the fingers could not move through full extension and abduction without the elastic band slipping. Find a modern exercise device that allows each finger to easily move through full natural ranges of motion with resistance.

Remember, you need to vary your workouts to match the intensity of your other training. Cross-training is difficult but vital to your success. The main issue with sport-specific strength and fitness training at any level, but particularly when first starting to train, is overtraining. Overtraining can derail the whole effort. You can run into problems with connective tissue, illness, excess weight loss, and malaise...all related back to overtraining, simply doing too much, too soon, and not in the right balance.<br /><br />That being said, your goal must amazing, it must excite you...the hurdles are immense but not insurmountable, you simply must have a plan. I found that this person described this smartly on this <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Faskingtax.com%2F271%2Famericans-communists-high-tax-rates%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://askingtax.com/271/americans-communists-high-tax-rates/</a> blog post.<br /><br />The first part of any sport-specific strength and fitness program is the evaluation. You must have an honest, heart-to-heart with yourself and with your team to access where you are now and where you want to end up, relative to fitness. You also need to establish incremental goals along the way, as well as the ultimate goal. In other words, you need to know where you are and where you are going...where you want to end up! That being said, you must do it the proper manner, progressing in just the right way, and timing it all just so...so you peak at just the right moment.<br /><br />You are about to embark upon the journey of a lifetime and the program, the timing, and the overall coaching is crucial. One component ignored or mishandled will result in a less-that-desired effect. As in business and in life, planning and timing are everything. You are basically embarking upon a launch, a product launch, and you are the product...or will be!<br /><br />So, here's what you do:<br /><br />1) Physical assessment. Know exactly where you stand on a variety of tests, all sport-specific. Test and measure everything, just as in business!<br /><br />2) Have an honest discussion with your trainers after the testing to assess weakness and strengths.<br /><br />3) Develop a plan of attack, and here is the most important aspect, trust your coaches with your <br />development...completely! Even Michael Jordan has a coach. You must turn yourself over to your coach and if he says &quot;S*#t bagels in the parking lot!&quot; You say, &quot;How many and how big!&quot; He'll tell you for how long...until he says stop!<br /><br />4) Get started!<br /><br />5) Assess often but not too often, as that may be counter-productive. Some gains will come fast and others will need constant attention and prodding for you to get ultimate results.<br /><br />Now, how do you work out?<br /><br />Based on the tests, the assessment, the discussion, and keeping the ultimate goal in mind, the training should be varied and should follow an adaptable and forward-thinking plan.<br /><br />1) You need to vary eccentric and concentric (negative-based and positive-based) activities. The negative will allow you to get to muscle fibers and to a degree impossible with a concentric only or a concentric-based routine. But you must vary the attack, one day concentric, two days later eccentric. And so on! Too much of one or the other will lead to minimal gains, no gains or, worse possible scenario...you will go backwards and lose strength and muscle, finally getting sick.<br /><br />Balance in sport-specific training is everything!<br /><br />2) You must have a cross-training, anaerobic/aerobic fitness approach...always pushing the boundaries of what is anaerobic and what is aerobic. As your fitness level increases and improves you will find what was once anaerobic is not aerobic...then you push again!<br /><br />Always push the boundaries!<br /><br />3) The balance between circuit training and conventional weight training is crucial. You need to push the aerobic/anaerobic envelope by increasing the intensity of the circuit, while balancing weights and machines.<br /><br />Once again, the proper balance is everything!<br /><br />Penn State, many years ago (late 70s and early 80s) had an awesome football program, in large measure because of Papa Joe Paterno...but also because of their strength and fitness program. However, as with human beings everywhere, they were looking for 'something better!&quot; Enter Nautilus! Penn State changed over their entire system to accommodate this new fitness machine, all the rage at the time. They almost completely eliminated the free-weight, power aspect of their training in favor of Arthur Jones's new claims that a 30 minute workout was all anyone needed...that...<br /><br />&quot;To do more was like tenderizing hamburger!&quot;<br /><br />Well, Penn State and Papa Joe bit and changed their program. In one year their program tanked! Joe Paterno is no dumby, and he certainly didn't have to be hit over the head to know he'd been wrong, the next year the reintegrated the weights and two years late they were national champions!<br /><br />Enough said!<br /><br />The balance was everything, that and working out in a sport-specific manner.<br /><br />You see, it is not just &quot;muscle-heads&quot; in the gym pumping up for a Friday night date, what I used to call the PPP or pre-party pump. You can't train like a bodybuilder preparing for a bodybuilding contest or powerlifter preparing for a powerlifting competition.<br /><br />The workouts I use for my clients, the ones Penn State uses, and used back them, are sport-specific...in this case football-specific in nature.<br /><br />The right ratio of machine to free weight workout is essential. Significantly, it is also very important which machines are used and which free weight exercises are applied to your sport-specific strength and fitness program.<br /><br />I tell my students, particularly the football athletes I train, because they all thought you just &quot;had&quot; to bench, just like you may believe a certain nutritional supplement is the best, that the first time they put a bench on the 50-yard line I would let them bench. Of course, I used the same analogy for every athlete, in every sport I trained.<br /><br />The message is the same, sport-specific exercises, integrating the proper motions and/or movements is of greater significance than how much one can bench.<br /><br />Interestingly, we have all been taught that you exercise in a certain way, and that certain exercises should be integrated into any workout program. That sort of thinking is, quite simply, wrong!<br /><br />Additionally, machines in and of themselves are just as bad. Again, there must be a balance between machines and free weights in any exercise program.<br /><br />Now, make sure that at least one day a week your exercise program, at least the sport-specific weight training portion is a negative or eccentric workout. The eccentric or negative workout should be a high intensity, heavy, free weight workout.<br /><br />Additionally, one workout should be what I refer to as a &quot;coning&quot; workout, meaning that you work from the heavy to light and finally to complete failure.<br /><br />A third workout, and each one of these workouts should be a same body part workout, should be a &quot;pyramid&quot; workout, and should go from light to heavy.<br /><br />The same body part or combination of body parts are worked 3 times a week.<br /><br />As in:<br /><br />Monday morning: Upper body &quot;coning to failure&quot; (chest, shoulders, triceps, abs, calves, forearms)<br />Monday late afternoon: Upper body &quot;coning to failure&quot; (back and biceps, abs, calves, forearms)<br /><br />Tuesday morning: Legs &quot;coning to failure&quot; (Quads, glutes, abductors and adductors, calves, abs, forearms)<br />Tuesday late afternoon: Legs &quot;coning to failure&quot; (Hamstrings*, calves, abs, forearms)<br /><br />Wednesday morning: Monday morning body parts &quot;pyramiding to failure&quot;<br />Wednesday late afternoon: Monday late afternoon body parts &quot;pyramiding to failure&quot;<br /><br />Thursday morning: Tuesday morning body parts &quot;pyramiding to failure&quot;<br />Thursday later afternoon: Tuesday late afternoon body parts &quot;pyramiding to failure&quot;<br /><br />Friday morning: Monday morning body parts &quot;negative&quot;<br />Friday late afternoon: Monday late afternoon body parts &quot;negative&quot;<br /><br />Saturday morning: Total leg blowout! &quot;negative&quot;<br /><br />Sunday: The Day of Rest from all things!<br /><br />*Hamstrings, leg biceps or biceps femoris, are the muscles at the back of the leg. Significantly, as you may already be aware, it is one of the most neglected muscles in the body. The proper strength ratio, quadraceps to hamstrings, can make a huge difference in your success as an athlete and also may play a big role in whether or not you have a hamstring injury at some point in your training. The hamstrings are also a key component in power and quickness...and well as in explosiveness (related to power) and speed!<br /><br />Every workout, you need to do abdominal work, lower back exercises, obliques, calves, and forearms (alternating exercises and intensity)<br /><br />Every morning your need to be doing very specific neck exercises, most being exercises your trainer can with you with a towel and their hands! Nothing is ever needed beyond that, at least in the early stages, as your neck just isn't that strong...but needs to be!<br /><br />As Woody Hayes once told me, &quot;As the neck goes, so goes the body! Work the neck constantly!&quot;<br /><br />There are a number of exercises I use with my clients that would help but the key is to use the right balance! Additionally, dumbbells OVER barbells, and machines in concert with free weights is key. The free weights offer real world, synergistic benefits machines alone cannot. Dumbbells and single-side exercises are more effective than barbell exercises for sport-specific training...and for competitive results.<br /><br />I have trained athletes at every level, I know this program works, I hope you will incorporate my ideas if you are in need of an edge, they will help you achieve your goals. If not, I still wish you every good thing, and a place on the team to boot!

I found that this blogger explained this smartly on this  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fasktechgeeks.com%2F3174%2Fremember-childrens-book%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://asktechgeeks.com/3174/remember-childrens-book/</a>   web page.<br /><br />1.) Make sure to read and reread everything they send that was included with the game, this will give you a good idea on how and what the game will be like. The game developers want your feedback on how well the game held up against the instructions they've sent you. they will also give you a deadline, and a standard format for submitting evaluations.<br /><br />2.) Remember that you're not playing for fun... It involves more than just playing a game normally, have your own method of playing that's most effective for you to test out every single aspect of the game, if the game features more then one character play them all, be on the lookout constantly for anything that doesn't seem normal or out of place, remember that you are a tester not a player.<br /><br />3.) Through out your testing cycle Take notes of everything that doesn't work or you think it doesn't work. DO NOT BE TOO VAGUE, I cannot stress this enough. These notes are what you will be basing your report on. Be as concrete as you can when you are describing bugs, and glitches, if you make to many errors like not explaining yourself in detail, the company will just let you go, deciding that you are just not good enough to be a tester.<br /><br />4.) If you happen to come across a bug, try to recreate it, find out why it happen, though some bugs will be random, most will take a specific actions or scenario that will trigger it. Include everything, location, level, character, what items you were using, every piece of information will be valuable and will help the programmers recreate the error, so don't leave out a single detail. Also be on the lookout for small errors like misspelling, music/sound errors, discoloration etc.<br /><br />5.) If you have some time before your deadline, you should try to start your entire game again, you might not have enough time to beat games that take 30+ hours but going over the first half wouldn't hurt, you might find something you missed on your earlier play trough's, once you are near your deadline, write your final report, don't forget to included every single piece of information included in your notes, start from the major errors and work your way down, you want it to look organized and professional, but organizing your report can vary from game to game.<br /><br />This is everything you need to know to be a successful game tester. It does take a bit of work but if you love to play video games then this wont be to much of a bother, if you want to learn about where to find a Game tester job just click the link at the bottom of the article.

Most of which, doesn't come natural for most people. Those that do find MLM prosperity have very diligently worked, trained, and practiced the techniques and strategies that promise results in this industry. Follow these MLM tips if you truly want victory in your business.<br /><br />MLM Tip #1 - Find Great Leadership<br /><br />It is imperative that you find leaders that can and will show you the right steps to take in this industry. Locate somebody who has achieved the same results you desire in business. Dissect what they did to get what they have. Then, follow their success formula. There are far too many great leaders who are willing to help you. You can't guess your way to success. It won't work. I found that this site demonstrated this nicely on this  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fkitchenknivesreviews.net%2F1150%2Fiam-22-year-college-student-dor-fare-priced-descent-knife-set-looked-line%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://kitchenknivesreviews.net/1150/iam-22-year-college-student-dor-fare-priced-descent-knife-set-looked-line/</a>   webpage.<br /><br />MLM Tip #2 - MLM Business is Real Business<br /><br />Take your MLM seriously. You may not have spent a million dollars on your business, but if you put in the time, it can pay you millions. This is why network marketing is such an amazing opportunity. Take advantage of it!<br /><br />Vital Tip #3 - Massive Success is Not Duplicable <br /><br />This one may be the most important of MLM tips. It's true. Duplication on a massive scale is a myth in the network marketing industry. Do what you must do to build your business as fast and large as possible. Take whatever action is required of you to produce your own results whether or not it can be easily duplicated. Throughout this process leaders will reveal themselves. You will know you have a leader when somebody in your network produces results. This may be with or without your aid.<br /><br />Vital Tip #4 - Leads, Leads, More Leads<br /><br />Need I say more? Ok, I'll elaborate. Many people will never understand getting paid on the efforts of others, the concept of leverage, or even the idea of building a large organization is beyond their grasp. You must find ways to generate tons of leads for your MLM. Leads are simply the heartbeat of your business. And I don't mean just your friends and family. I'm talking tons of laser targeted leads begging to join your business. Shhh... There ARE ways to do this... on a huge scale... It's a secret.<br /><br />MLM Tip #5 - Attraction Marketing Lead Generation System (the secret is out!)<br /><br />Learn ways to integrate attraction marketing so you and your team can get into profits as quickly as possible. A good system will give you a multitude of ways to create income regardless if a prospect or lead joins you in your business. With an attraction marketing system your team will enter a profit situation much faster and will be generating leads to build their business. This is how amazing MLM results are created.

Maybe you blew it - big time. You said or did something that was completely not cool that your girlfriend finally threw up her hands and left. Now you're crying in your beer, or sitting around in your boxers, or sending her inappropriate emails/texts/messages, while your circle of friends looks on shaking their heads, because you are basically a big mess, and truth be told, you want her back. So, ask yourself the question - how do I win my ex girlfriend back? There is no perfect strategy, since everyone is different. There are, however, a few things you can do to help yourself out if messed up with your lady love. I found that this blog showed this nicely on this  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fdrumkitsreviews.com%2Fquestions-chords-electric-guitar-good-web-page-beginners%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://drumkitsreviews.com/questions-chords-electric-guitar-good-web-page-beginners/</a>  article.<br /><br />Win My Ex Girlfriend Back Tip#1: Stop falling apart. Now that you have a lot more free time than you used to, spend it doing things that make you look and/or feel better. Go running, take a martial arts class, learn another language, or join a volunteer program. Find something you can put your energy into that gives you a sense of pride. Being able to interact with your ex the next time you see her with your head held high, will go a long to reminding her why she was attracted to you in the first place.<br /><br />Win My Ex Girlfriend Back Tip#2: Remember the good things and don't dwell on the bad. This is very difficult when you are in the middle of a breakup, but if you can pull it off, your ex will definitely reassess. Angry, resentful, bitter people are not attractive. If you can be genuinely grateful for the good things you still have going on in your life, and remain positive about the happy things around you, your ex will see you as someone who could potentially bring positive energy back into their lives, instead of anger and negativity.<br /><br />Win My Ex Girlfriend Back Tip#3: Chill out. Don't run after her with your hat in your hands and your head down. The truth is that you both probably need the space. Allow the space to occur. &quot;Absence makes the heart grow fonder&quot; isn't just a lot of hot air. Sometimes taking a breather is important as it helps you examine what's working and what isn't about the relationship. So, take a deep breath and leave your ex alone.<br /><br />Win My Ex Girlfriend Back Tip#4: Get on with your life. Don't get stuck in the &quot;I had it and I lost it&quot; vortex. Go out and meet people, see theater, go to concerts, or join a club. Don't turn into a hermit because she left. You were okay before you met her. You'll be okay after her. If she runs into you on the street and you are actually doing all right, she'll have to ask herself why she left such a great guy.

We struggle and fight to reach an age where we no longer have to be burdened by the enormous weight of financial obligation. It is a disheartening way to live. I found that this blogger showed this well on this  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fhomegymplanet.com%2Fquestions-answers-sears-catalog-model%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://homegymplanet.com/questions-answers-sears-catalog-model/</a>  post.<br /><br />Sometimes it feels the only way to break free from the cruel chains of fate is to take a chance. With one ticket, one golden lottery ticket, you can go from down on your luck to winning it all. You can finally live the life you intended, your choices no longer limited by the size of your bank account. Dine on the best food. Travel to the most exotic locations. Play. Live.<br /><br />But winning the lottery is pure luck, right? Wrong. Of course there is always some luck involved but there are things you can do to improve your odds dramatically. Here are 5 tips to get you started.<br /><br />1) Don't play 7 ball games if you want to win frequently. Play games with a lower number of balls. Play 5 ball games, then 6 ball games if you have no other choice. Your odds of winning increase with the lower ball games.<br /><br />2) Don't play the lottery games with the highest amount of numbers. The lower the amount of numbers in your game, the better your odds. If you have a choice between two games containing, for example, 35 numbers or 60 - go for the lower number!<br /><br />3) Do not play lottery games that use computer generated numbers. Make sure they are real balls - ping pong balls are most common - in a washer barrel machine.<br /><br />4) Don't rely on the lottery shop's quick pick numbers. Using your own numbers and a good lottery system will eliminate the least effective number combinations and improve your chances of winning.<br /><br />5) Play more tickets and focus your lottery strategy. Concentrate on one lottery game and buy as many tickets as you can. The more tickets you buy, the greater your odds of winning.

There are lots of options to consider when planning your vacation and they may seem overwhelming. A good starting point might be to think about how you are planning to arrive in this tropical paradise. Since Hawaii is, after all, an island there are only two ways to get there: by sea or by air. When calculating time from California, your choice is between five hours in the air or five days by sea. Now, I know there's a big difference in time, but a Hawaii cruise might be just the excitement and relaxation you're looking for. I found that this web page explained this well on this  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Faskdatingexperts.com%2F2886%2Fgood-dating-tips%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://askdatingexperts.com/2886/good-dating-tips/</a>  page.<br /><br />Depending on your preference of travel, a Hawaii cruise might sound much more appealing to you than traveling by plane. It is inevitable that every time you step onto an airplane, even if you did pay top dollar for first class, you find yourself in an overcrowded area, in close quarters with several hundred people, many who are possibly ill.<br /><br />You probably do everything you can, short of jump off the plane, to pass the grueling five hours. Then once you're off the plane you spend another hour or more enduring airport security and looking for your luggage before you even begin the trip to your hotel. Wow, doesn't sound like a great way to start a relaxing vacation. And just think, you get to do it all over again at the end of your trip, too.<br /><br />Now, visualize yourself heading to your departure point and arriving right at your hotel. No long security lines, no crowded planes. When you travel by ship on a Hawaii cruise it's just like checking into your hotel and relaxing while you head to your destination. You can put your luggage in your room and head straight to the pool deck, enjoy a cocktail, and spend the first five hours of your vacation basking in the tropical sun rather than dodging someone else's germs.<br /><br />When it comes down to it there's really no comparison. I know I would much rather spend my vacation to Hawaii relaxing on a cruise ship than wasting it in an airport. You will return home relaxed and calm from a week of pampering and luxury instead of stressed to the max from a long flight. The choice is yours, spend you days and nights in a luxurious room, enjoying delicious meals on a cruise ship of your preference, and you will truly enjoy your getaway to the paradise of the Hawaiian islands.

A lot of persons believe that stress is for adults only, but this is a misconception. Stress will not choose persons, as all groups of ages are vulnerable to stress. The only thing that can effectively prevent stress is to avoid stressful situations, and embrace positive views in life. One of the ways to enhance optimism is to do the things you want to do. It is not right to deprive yourself from the things that could make you happy. When you are fond of playing games, it is nice to give yourself opportunities to play even just for while. I found that this person described this smartly on this [url=]Corey Pilarski[/url]  webpage.<br /><br />Gaming will not require you to spend whole day playing. It is always your preference on how you will spend your time in playing. The important thing is that, you can give what your mind wants so that you will not be burned-out easily. Playing is a fun recreational activity that is suitable for all age groups. Kids, adults, and oldies can play all the games that they want as long as their bodies are still capable of accepting the intense emotions brought by these games. Although gaming is not that strenuous, but it targets the psychological aspect of an individual, thus it can really bring different kinds of emotions. Prior to playing it is necessary to prepare yourself not just physically, but more on emotional matters. Although winning could not always happen in playing, but still the essence of losing can help you become more motivated to play instead of giving up. With constant practice, you will definitely win and finish the game.<br /><br />The feelings of winning a game are indeed stress relievers. When you are busy thinking a lot of things, it is much better to pause for a while and have a break, so that you will be able to prevent mind burn out. Your busy mind will be shifted into a positive state when you won a game. Enjoying a game is possible when you like what you are playing and you have perseverance that you will finish the game no matter how hard it is. When you are always busy with more important things, you will not need to take for granted those important matters that you should do just to practice playing. You can always play when you have spare time periods. This activity could not interrupt your daily activities, as long as you know how to put limits on yourself. Self-discipline is the best solution that will help you limit your crave in playing games.

When that strike comes -- game on! To have the best advantage over wily trout and salmon, I like my fly fishing tackle to be high in quality and superbly reliable. I do have to confess, though, that I'm a bit of a tackle collector, with more rods and reels than I'd care to admit owning. So, when it's time to pack up for a fishing excursion, it's important to choose the right fishing gear from my collection. One reel I reach for quite often is the Loop Evotec G4. Read on to find out why.<br /><br /><strong>Key Features of the Loop Evotec G4 Fly Reel</strong><br /><br />I was glad to learn that the Evotec reel series has undergone some major design changes that make the reels superior performers. This is a strong and powerful reel that doesn't sacrifice smoothness in any way. Fitted with the Power Matrix drag system, the G4 is equal to even the largest, hard-fighting opponent. The designers of this reel have really gotten it right. I especially like the G4's winding handle, which is an ergonomically designed, low friction component that prevents tangles when casting or retrieving. I also noticed that the counterweight has an o-ring to which you can fix the tippet when the rod isn't in use. I found that this blogger explained this smartly on this <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2Jpa2VyZXZpZXdzaGFjay5jb20vNDQwL21vdW50YWluLWJpa2VzLWJ1eS8_" target="_blank">Iva Schroder</a>  webpage.<br /><br /><strong>More About the Evotec G4 Reel</strong><br /><br />Although the appearance of a piece of fly fishing tackle is less important than its performance and quality, I do have to admit that the black colour of the Evotec G4 is quite striking. Combine that with the sleek aluminium housing and spool, and you've got a great looking reel. In addition, the housing and spool are machined from a single piece of aircraft-quality aluminium, so I'm certain the G4 will stand up well to hard use. The reel's critical steel components are machined from surgical-quality stainless steel, so I'm sure the G4 is quite salt tolerant and waterproof where it needs to be. The casing and braking system are made from high quality materials, which allows the G4 to function superbly in a wide range of conditions.<br /><br /><strong>Final Thoughts on the Loop Evotec G4</strong><br /><br />It's the little things that make a big difference in this superior piece of fishing tackle. For example, all the screws are secured with Loc-Tite, a product that locks and seals nuts and screws, preventing them from loosening and corroding -- a small but important feature. The Power Matrix drag system and the easy-to-grip progressive brake knob make this reel a joy to fish with. It's fast and simple to change spools, and the G4 can be configured for right- or left-handed retrieve. Finally, I do appreciate the G4's precision counterbalance.<br /><br />The Loop Evotec G4 reel is a superior piece of fly fishing tackle. I'm pleased to recommend it and happy to rate it at 4.5 out of a possible 5 stars.

Whenever electricity and water are somehow combined, there is a huge opportunity for disaster. This entire series of set up tips covers a wide range of important topics. Ultimately, this may be the most important of them all!<br /><br />Water always will try to find the lowest place it can access. For the aquarist, water is contained in an aquarium. There is inevitably some opportunity for water to spill or otherwise find its way outside the aquarium. Splashes can also occur when the tank is being filled after regular water maintenance or in a wide variety of other possible scenarios. It should be taken for granted that water will, occasionally, find its way outside the container. When it does, it is not uncommon for it to drip into areas where electrical connections must be made.<br /><br />Even when water is not somehow spilled or splashed, one of the easiest ways water can find a path to move down to the floor is by trickling on any hoses that enter the aquarium. Filters often use hoses to transport water to and from the aquarium. Always make sure that the hoses are positioned in such a way that they do not allow any water to move down the outside of the hose. Position outputs for filters away from the hoses that supply them as much as possible. Prevent strong currents from forcing water between the aquarium glass pane and the top frame. Splashing inside the fish tank is a great way for water to find a way to escape from the container.<br /><br />Besides the water intake, exhaust hoses and pipes used to transport water between filter and aquarium. The other area that can cause serious problems are the wires that enter the aquarium to power various electrical items. These aquarium accessories require power within aquarium itself. They are required for the health and welfare of your fish. These can be filters of various sorts as well as submersible heaters, etc.<br /><br />Each electrical apparatus must be connected by a power cord between the electrical socket and unit housed within the fish tank. The necessity of having wires in the aquarium and exiting from the top can be very dangerous. Water can be splashed onto these wires and then easily travel down them directly into the socket - if there are no preventative measures taken. I found that this person described this amazingly on this <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3Jvd2luZ21hY2hpbmVzcmV2aWV3LmNvbS9xYS1leHRlcm5hbC1oYXJkLWRyaXZlcy1tYWNib29rLw__" target="_blank">Andres Howie</a> article.<br /><br />Water in a socket is a strong fire hazard.<br /><br />The solution to this danger is not very difficult to remedy. The hazard is well known to many certification agencies. They are often very careful to require that reference to a drip loop, often with a visual graphic, and its importance is stressed in every manual that accompanies any aquarium electrical appliance for sale.<br /><br />Any electrical accessory sold for an aquarium in most countries requires that it be tested for specific criteria. These ensure the unit will perform as it has been specified and that the appliance is not a fire hazard or electrical dare while operating. All regulations regarding it must be fulfilled to be granted certification. One of the more important aspects of this certification is the requirement that precautionary text be included in the instructions. If there is even the remotest chance that the wire will come into contact with water, the safety instructions require the use of a drip loop as part of the operating and installation instructions.<br /><br />A drip loop is a very simple thing to implement. It requires no tools or added equipment, or even any modifications to the unit during installation. The configuration must simply ensure that a part of the wire is located well below the electrical socket. After that, it then must rise back up to the socket before it is plugged in. This will force the water to drop off the wire, or at worst, remain on the wire at this lower point. Water is unable to defy gravity to trickle up into the electrical socket. The errant water cannot follow the wire right into the socket.<br /><br />When you are doing any maintenance, always ensure that water cannot drip directly into the electrical socket. Arrange all the hoses and wires so that they always have a loop below the socket that delivers the power to your aquarium. You need the power to operate the electrical appliances in and around the aquarium. However, you certainly want to do everything you can to prevent any possibly of water and power somehow mixing.

But a color scheme can be interpreted in many different ways - imagine these two very different weddings using yellow, white and green...<br /><br /><strong>Citrus psychedelic</strong><br /><br />The bright lemon yellow and lime green of citrus fruits provide the color inspiration and theme for this wedding. Lemons and limes pop up all over the place, starting with the white invitations printed with a design of the cut fruit creating a free-wheeling pop art abstract graphic of circles and triangles. Arriving at the ceremony venue, guests are greeted by two miniature lemon trees heavy with fruit, that mark the beginning of the aisle. The service booklets are delicately scented with a lemon fragrance and white, yellow and bright green streamers gently wave at the sides of the seating area. The bride's party arrives and there is no mistaking the bridesmaids, as they appear in bright printed dresses of yellow and green teamed with lime shoes. To contrast against the busy pattern of their short dresses, their bouquets are white. The bride appears all in white, except for the bright yellow shoes that peek out from under her dress. Her bouquet is a riot of yellow, green and white. I found that this site showed this simply on this <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2Jlc3R3aXJlbGVzc3N1cnJvdW5kc291bmRzeXN0ZW0uY29tLzg1OC9idXktNy0xLXN1cnJvdW5kLXNvdW5kLXN5c3RlbS8_" target="_blank">Hayden Lanphier</a>  web page.<br /><br />At the reception the citrus theme continues. Guests are refreshed with lime cocktails while waiting to be seated, and find that the wedding reception centrepieces include slices of lemon and lime floating in the vases. Name cards at each place are slipped inside a cut made in a lemon or lime, and favour bags alternate in lime green and bright yellow. A lemon garnish appears on the entree and a slice of sugared lime is popped into the dessert. Finally, full of good food and fine wine, the guests take to the dance floor, kicking aside the fluorescent green and gold balloons that fill the floor.<br /><br /><strong>Sugar and spice</strong><br /><br />The afternoon sun warms the cream walls of the country church, turning them a soft shade of butter yellow. Tall vases of traditional flowers - roses, gladioli, dahlias and carnations - stand at either side of the altar, which holds another arrangement in white and yellow. At the end of each pew a sweet posy hangs, attached with a white ribbon. The guests refer to their invitations - printed with a yellow lace border and tucked into envelopes lined in a fresh spring green - as the bridal party arrives.<br /><br />The bride is all in white - a simple gown with broderie anglaise detailing. The bridesmaid's dresses match but in soft yellow worn with pale yellow shoes. They carry posies of yellow and white roses with green accents.<br /><br />After the ceremony the guests are directed to a garden party. A couple of white tents with yellow bunting provide shade, and lemonade is handed out. A generous afternoon tea complete with cucumber sandwiches and miniature tarts is served, the guests sit at tables under umbrellas and dine off yellow plates with white polka-dots, teamed with yellow and white striped napkins. The wedding cake is a sumptuous tiered affair iced in white and decorated with yellow blossoms and green foliage. On leaving the guests are presented with individual cookies shaped like wedding cakes and ornately decorated with butter yellow and white frosting.

The white portion of the eyes is called the sclera and it is known to form the outer coat of the eyeball. The surface of the sclera is composed of tiny vessels which can become congested with blood. This may be due to an insufficient supply of oxygen.<br /><br />What are the causes red eyes?<br /><br />Red eyes is caused by a lot of reason. These may include fatigue, eyestrain, dust, bright sunshine, pollen allergies, cigarette smoke, staying up late at night, overwork and other irritants. A special cause is drinking of alcoholic beverages. Bloodshot eyes on the other hand mean capillary fragility throughout the body. Lack of certain amino acids and vitamins, as well as high blood pressure may also cause red eyes and bloodshot eyes.<br /><br />Individuals aged 40 and above are most likely to be prone in experiencing these problems but only to a certain extent. But if the condition persists, increased its severity of if it occurs in younger people, you may want to give it a closer attention. I found that this blogger showed this simply on this <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3Byb21lYWxyZXBsYWNlbWVudHNoYWtlcy5jb20vMTM2L2duYy1zdXBwbGVtZW50LXNoYWtlcy1tdXNsY2UtZ2Fpbi8_" target="_blank">Chase Edwin</a> web site.<br /><br />Natural Solutions for Red Eyes<br /><br />&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Be sure to get sufficient rest and sleep at night. You ma also want to pause and rest for a little more during the day.&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;It is also critical that you improve your diet. Take sufficient amount of Vitamin A, Vitamin B2 and B6 and the 3 amino acids which include phynylalanine, lysine and histidine. Eating vegetables, fruits, nuts and beans will ensure you that you are getting the needed amino acids and vitamins.&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;Do not use the over the counter drops in the pharmacies. These drops claim to cure red eyes. They contain agents that constrict blood vessels. This may make your whites whiter for a while but the problem is not actually addressed. If you place drops to your precious eyes, it will gradually wear off for a couple of hours and the redness will generally appear redder than before.&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;Lay a wed and cool washcloth over your closed eyes. The coldness of the water would help constrict your blood vessels the natural way. Also, the moisture helps your eyes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

He was also interested in architecture, art-sculpture, mathematics, engineering and music; he was in fact a many-sided genius. I found that this web page explained this intelligently on this <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2luc3VyYW5jZWFza2luZy5jb20vMzAxNy9saWJlcmFscy1oZWFsdGgtaW5zdXJhbmNlLWNvbXBhbmllcy1wYXktaGVhbHRoLWNhcmUtbWFraW5nLXByb2ZpdC8_" target="_blank">Lovella Shear</a> weblog.<br /><br />Considered one of the greatest painters of all time and definitely the most talented person ever to have lived; in this article we will be mainly focus on two of his greatest masterpieces: &quot;The Last Supper&quot; and the &quot;Mona Lisa&quot;.<br /><br />&lt;u&gt;<strong>The Last Supper</strong>&lt;/u&gt;: Between 1496 and 1498 Leonardo painted this masterpiece, however it was originally executed in tempera on a badly prepared stucco ground and began to deteriorate a few years after its completion; it was restored on several occasions but it was not until 1908 that Professor Cavenaghi has, in opinion of experts, preserved it from further injury.<br /><br />The Painting represents the last meal that Jesus had with the Apostles before he was betrayed, captured and killed. Leonardo successfully captured the betray effect in the painting and the gestures of the disciples reveal their temperaments, passions and shock by the realisation that there is a traitor in the group.<br /><br /><strong>&lt;u&gt;The Mona Lisa&lt;/u&gt;</strong>: Once back in Florence, Leonardo started working on the Portrait of &lt;em&gt;Mona Lisa&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;La&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Joconde &lt;/em&gt;by which the portrait is officially known in the Louvre Museum. It is assumed that he started working on the portrait in 1501 and it was finally completed in 1504; even when the completion of the most famous painting in the world took around four years, Leonardo did not paint it for Francesco and Lisa del Giocondo (They commissioned the painting); he painted it for the posterity; the enigmatic Mona Lisa looks like if she is alive and observing us from any angle you look at the painting.<br /><br />An extract of Vasari's eulogy of this portrait clearly reflects the admiration of this work: &quot;...The nose, with its beautiful and delicately roseate nostrils, might be easily believed to be alive; the mouth, admirable in its outline, the rose-tints of their colour with those of the face, in the utmost perfection, and the carnation of the cheek does not appear to be painted, but truly flesh and blood...&quot;<br /><br />A peck of pigment near the left elbow was damaged in 1956 when a young Bolivian named Ugo Unganza Villegas threw a rock at it.<br /><br />On the 22 May 1519, Leonardo da Vinci died, leaving us with an astonishing legacy of art and invention; he will leave forever as the &lt;em&gt;Universal genius &lt;/em&gt;of all time.

However, none of them were able to qualify for the second round. Enormously popular in Bhutan, archery is an Olympic sport since the 1900s.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;Athletics&lt;/b&gt;<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;Did you know- &lt;/b&gt;On March 14, 1968, in Phnom Penh, Cambodia's capital, sprinter Meas Kheng set a new Cambodian record of 12.0 seconds in the women's 100m. I think that this person described this smartly on this <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RoYWlsYW5kbXVheWNhbXAuY29tLw__" target="_blank">weight training</a> weblog.Between 1968 and 1972, Miss Kheng was one of the most respected athletes -male or female-- in the Asian nation, which boasted one of the worst Olympic systems in the world, probably worse than Afghanistan.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;Basketball&lt;/b&gt;<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;Did you know-&lt;/b&gt; Kuala Lumpur, the capital city of Malaysia, hosted the Women's Basketball World Championship in the early 1990s.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;Field Hockey&lt;/b&gt;<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;Did you know- &lt;/b&gt;At the 1982 Asian Games in New Delhi (India), in spite of the skepticism of sportswriters, the host country's team - traditionally the powerhouse in men's hockey-- won the Women's Asian Hockey Tournament. In fact, they was not favorites to win the continental title. Why? A year ago, the women's field hockey squad of India failed to compete for the World Cup. Field hockey is one of the most popular sports in India, the world's biggest democracy.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;Football&lt;/b&gt;<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;Did you know- &lt;/b&gt;The People's Republic of China hosted the Women's Football World Tournament in the early 1990s.

At the 1988 Olympiad in Seoul (South Korea), the local team provided the biggest upset of the Games when it defeated Norway 23-20 and won the Women's Handball Tournament.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;Shooting&lt;/b&gt;<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;Did you know- &lt;/b&gt;Azerbaijan's athlete Zemfira Meftakhetdinova placed first in skeet shooting in the Summer Olympics in Sydney (Australia) in 2000; the first national athlete to claim gold at the prestigious event.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;Softball&lt;/b&gt;<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;Did you know- &lt;/b&gt;The People's Republic of China came in second place in women's softball at the Atlanta Olympics in the mid-1990s.Subsequently,the team from Japan took the silver medal in the 27th Olympic Games, behind the United States (gold).

As a camp coordinator, you have to plan events, activities and entertainment for the participants.  There are many themes you can come up with, but to get the most participation out of a theme you have to make them sound fun and attractive.  Remember that camp is about fun and enjoyment.  As a camp participant you want your stay at camp to be enjoyable and something that will create memories of a lifetime.<br /><br />When coming up with ideas for activities you need to know all about the facilities and their accommodations.  Do you have a gym, baseball and football field, or a place to implement these types of games?  Do you have hiking trails, lakes, rivers, boats, canoes, swimming, snorkeling or diving?  You should have all this information available to you as to be able to fulfill a complete and full schedule for your participants.<br /><br />Now that you have the information on what capabilities your facility has you can start making your plans.  I think that this page showed this well on the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy50aGFpbGFuZG11YXljYW1wLmNvbS9yZXN0YXVyYW50" target="_blank">Thailand Muay Camp gym</a> web post.First you have to make the decisions on what type of activities or events you are going to do.  Play games, cooking, nature hikes and exploration, mystery excursions, and so on.  After you have come up with everything you are planning on doing, you then need to name your events.  To name your events, you really need to be creative.  You want to make the sound fun and exciting.  But at the same time you do not want to over glorify the names as to lead to disappointment to the participants.  You need to pick a name that will make the participants excited to participate without giving false expectations on what the program is all about.<br /><br />Say if you are going to have an outdoor cooking activity, you need to come up with a unique name for it.  Let's say something like, Cooking In The Wild.  Now that you have your theme, how are you going to implement it?  Would you make burgers on the grill?  What would you call them to give it some excitement, Survivor Burgers, after the television show Survivor?   It takes a lot of time, planning and creativity to make any event a success.<br /><br />I have listed some ideas below that could be a theme for an event along with a suggested description of what that event might entail.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;Wonders of Nature&lt;/b&gt;<br /><br />For this event you might want to venture into insects, rodents, land formations, mosses, trees or birds.  This type of event of has many options to choose from.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;All Stars&lt;/b&gt;<br /><br />For this event you would set up sporting games.  Be if football, basketball, soccer, water balloons, Frisbee events and what ever other activities in the sporting them you can come up with.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;Survivor&lt;/b&gt;<br /><br />This is an event that could be set up on the television series &quot;Survivor&quot;.  You can set up treasure hunts, obstacle courses or play a creative game on survival.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;Splash&lt;/b&gt;<br /><br />This event name could be for your water adventures.  You could play water volley ball, canoeing, swimming competitions, diving competitions or snorkeling.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;A Day In The Knight&lt;/b&gt;<br /><br />This event could be geared to learning about knighthood.  You could get out the turkey legs and maybe play some knight games.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;American Idol&lt;/b&gt;<br /><br />This event since it is so popular on television would be a great event for the participants.  They could all have a singing competition and let the participants be the judges.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;The Red Light Special&lt;/b&gt;<br /><br />This event could involve the Police and Fire Departments.  They are usually more than will to volunteer their time for events with children.  If there are K-9's they could give a demonstration.  If there is a rescue diving team they could also give a demonstration.  I would try to be more original on this event as most schools already have the police and firemen come to visit them on fire and protection issues.  If they have access to the survive alive house, see if it would be possible for them to bring is also.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;Around The World&lt;/b&gt;<br /><br />This event could involve learning other countries customs.  Another great idea for this would be to have the participants make some ethnic foods and sample foods from different countries.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;Pick Your Star&lt;/b&gt;<br /><br />This event could involve some astrology and learn the constellations.  Each participant could also pick a star that is their own, giving them a certificate of ownership.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;The Sweet Tooth&lt;/b&gt;<br /><br />This event could involve children's favorite foods.  They might make cakes, cookies or candies.<br /><br />So as you can see, there is a lot of time and effort that goes into the implementation of setting up Summer Camp themes.  But with due diligence you will get the job accomplished and the participants will have a great time and something they will remember for a life time.
