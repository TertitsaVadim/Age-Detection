<br /><br />If I could but make the sun still,
<br />Even ten years before the birth of Joshua,
<br />There would be no darkness tonight,
<br />And would be by your side lightening up the night.
<br />The tides of loneliness beat my might,
<br />No place for time's flight!
<br /><br />Can someone tell with wisdom
<br />The prince of her kingdom?
<br />Dare not point accusing finger at me!
<br />Ha, I am worthy not of this adorable foresight!

<br />Search your heart, 
<br />Give an ear to the still little voice;
<br />And you'll find that the things I counsel you of
<br />Are what make man a living being.
<br /><br />Search my life,
<br />Check my ways,
<br />Give an eye to the path I trend;
<br />And you'll find that the things I chasten you of
<br />Aren't of the council of my strengths.
<br /><br />It's the realm into which I strive also to dive,
<br />And make the future a haven.
<br />Maybe I'm worse than you could picture,
<br />But more zealous than chancy
<br />To build a nature with chancel.
<br /><br />What do I?
<br />I open you up to the realm of knowledge and good judgement and give a  momentum.
<br />Bottom line?
<br />I flow not in my ideas, but give to you what the spirit gave to prepare you for autumn.
<br /><br />Wisdom isn't a guarantee for perfection,
<br />Nor would good-judgement quarantines against pitfalls.
<br />Give not ears but mind to counsels,
<br />And take not your offering far from chancel.
<br />Let your eyes see beyond the dancing lips of your counsellor;
<br />For he's only but an oracle of the gods.
<br />And also a mud of fluctuating and imperfect mental canvas like a dude.
<br />So, listen, look, and learn.

<br />Once an offer of a brotherly love, affection and responsibility,
<br />But what can love, void of romance,
<br />For a belle of absolute glamour bore if not a clamour for a desire?
<br />So a heart without a heat of love.
<br /><br />To another in a time smile,
<br />A hand of loft, romance, appreciation and satisfaction.
<br />Intimidation, mistaken desires
<br />And remorse could not be unexpected when love but not loved.
<br />Alas, the heart of the matter is a nurture of the heart!
<br />So a heart without a heat of love.
<br /><br />But at last buttered a part of his empire, love, affection,
<br />Intimacy, romance and appreciation.
<br />Yea, where's the place of pride when love's concerned,
<br />Is the love of a woman  not better built with attires than desire?
<br />How can a prince rule the kingdom of a beautiful monarch
<br />On the claims of dos and don'ts?
<br />For he must perspire.
<br />So a heart without a heat of love.
<br /><br />Things better acquired with love now cry for rents:
<br />Bumps of the lips, hills of the chest
<br />And the thicket of the valley.
<br />The only thing no one ever can utter or offer enough is love;
<br />But love is unfair to the fearless.
<br />So a heart without a heat of love. romance and appreciation.

<br />to taste.'
<br />How fulfilled man could've been,
<br />and not in haste;
<br />But for him the tongue choose
<br />death
<br />And a brief breath, pieced with
<br />paste.
<br />Give no 'Eve's answer,'
<br />Let your yes yes, and no no.
<br /><br />Greediness!
<br />And why would they fight over
<br />one when many unplucked?
<br />But to put Him to the test!
<br />Or aren't there more to go a
<br />dozen to each mate?
<br />For we could see better than
<br />swimming in this jest,
<br />And die earlier than eighteen.
<br />There'd be no cancer,
<br />menopause, or pain in the chest.
<br /><br />Hmm! If men were God
<br />What wrath would befall
<br />humanity.
<br />But now we're youths even at a
<br />hundred;
<br />And endowmed with power for
<br />creativity.
<br />Mercy 'hath begotten us again
<br />into lively hope'!
<br />But 'whomsoever much is given,
<br />of him shall be much required.'

<br />our fences have stripped us
<br />naked.
<br />Those with swollen chest that
<br />often defend us are no more;
<br />The children of 'Agbete' that
<br />daren't look us in the face have
<br />come out as men.
<br />Who'd wear the battle shoes of
<br />our fathers
<br />And take the horse by the bridle?
<br />Who'd continue the good fight
<br />when Mandela pass through a
<br />riddle?
<br />The rod, with which 'Menosa'
<br />chastened us, is lying idle.
<br />Heroes are not born in our days!
<br /><br />Who's he that's to go to the
<br />great beyond?
<br />When you get there, pray our
<br />heroes past to be patient with
<br />us.
<br />Tell them that their footprint is
<br />washing away;
<br />Their handwriting fading so
<br />quickly;
<br />That no youngman wants to pay
<br />the price for anything.
<br />Don't forget to tell the great
<br />mothers
<br />That the household of mothers is
<br />now the household of murders;
<br />No easy passage for the heroes
<br />unborn.
<br />Heroes are not born in our days!
<br /><br />And should you be given a green
<br />pass, ensure you pay homage to
<br />the black inventors.
<br />Tell them that the path they
<br />paved for invention is long lost;
<br />No one with the cold feet to
<br />trend it.
<br />Even the self-governance, for
<br />which they ran out their blood,
<br />Now an instrument for self-
<br />fulfilments.
<br />The sons of 'Semawo' that
<br />couldn't climb even to the middle
<br />of the tall 'ugwo' tree, while
<br />others at the top,
<br />Now walk the streets with
<br />sceptres.
<br />No prophet to tell what
<br />tomorrow would bear;
<br />Cause heroes are not born in our
<br />days!

<br />I'd rather work my muscle on a work site
<br />And make mouth of our love on a website,
<br />Than raise my hand on you even when right.
<br /><br />Though our friends think it's love at first sight,
<br />Still I can never wish you wear my ex-'s tight.
<br /><br />So many men want to be in my shoes but the reason I can hardly guess right,
<br />And should attempt I should say it's your good height.
<br /><br />My love, with a most amorous  caress and showers of kiss on your tit,
<br />I bid you goodnight.
<br /><br />Sleep my Queen, sleep tight!
<br />But on the mountains I should engage Heaven all-night,
<br />Praying the creator to give us longer days than nights. And I'll neither sleep nor slumber until on your glittering skin shines daylight.

<br />steps,
<br />In a chat engage I the bamboo
<br />bed;
<br />Praying heavens to send a deep
<br />sleep,
<br />As in dreams arouse with a
<br />bottle of snore to sip.
<br />Just as flashes of light,
<br />The streets I walk set ablaze in
<br />beauty;
<br />And the path in gold paved as
<br />careless as the wind.
<br />The greens of the field with a
<br />million maidens to dress;
<br />A heap of lads to oil the
<br />maidenhairs.
<br />As my heart swims in a pool of
<br />allure
<br />And pounds in a leap,
<br />The journey back I flip.
<br />As the day blink to open an eye,
<br />The sun wouldn't let me be;
<br />Plying on the window for a peep.
<br /><br />How boring tonight it will be,
<br />Not with a sight of the pride of
<br />my woman;
<br />Of a glimpse of her beauty these
<br />dreams are born.
<br />Oh that Joshua would still my
<br />sun,
<br />Till behold I my 'ugiegbe!'
<br />In trembling I jump the fences,
<br />For fear of trouble lay not my
<br />head,
<br />And feeble, as the moon caresses
<br />the sky.
<br />The pride of africa's made me
<br />nostalgic.
<br /><br />The black ornament, her
<br />immunity.
<br />Tens of thousands of angels
<br />Travel the rays of the sun her
<br />skin to nourish,
<br />And roll her up in vitality;
<br />For, against corruption, she must
<br />bathe in divinity.
<br />Upon her oily skin, the treasures
<br />of gold and silver.
<br />And the glittering colouration,
<br />her pride;
<br />She's loamy -the perfect fertile
<br />womb!
<br />Hair like a flock of goat grazing
<br />by the riverside;
<br />Samson's latter strength -
<br />Having better victory when he
<br />died than while he lived.
<br />The green greenish green
<br />habitations -
<br />Forests, hills and mountains, at
<br />peace with the heavens.
<br />For the pride of my woman
<br />protocols waived,
<br />And nature allies with the
<br />highlands.
<br />Earthquake and volcano are
<br />myths;
<br />Tornado's better in fictions.
<br />The surplus supply of gifts as
<br />constant as the sun,
<br />The waters of her pot of life
<br />makes even.
<br />Her culture as vast as eternity;
<br />For this is a treasure beyond
<br />enmity.
<br />Her smooth lips as cool as
<br />cucumber;
<br />And the strength in her muscle
<br />will rain manna.
<br />The pride of my woman,
<br />The strength of a kingdom and
<br />empire!
<br /><br />The tears I cry as her
<br />daughters're given to mutations.
<br />Eyes fixed beyond her mud walls;
<br />Looking more at them,
<br />And becoming mere like them.
<br />All they dream's artistic
<br />colourations,
<br />In a bail out of realistic
<br />admirations.
<br />Now cry they of skin
<br />deteriorations,
<br />As cancer's a parcel of adoption.
<br />A little here, a little there:
<br />A half of treasure's given to
<br />mascara,
<br />Parading the streets like 'okhara;'
<br />In their enchantment our young
<br />men end in massacre,
<br />Tossing their dignity like cascara.
<br />In a thrill for the container we
<br />bind marriages,
<br />And as the content unfolds we
<br />enrol for contests.
<br /><br />Fair beauty's good a commodity.
<br />Fair's clayey - the perfect barren
<br />womb!
<br />It's a meal to an eye
<br />And quenches not the thirst of a
<br />heart.
<br />Porridge is sweet to taste,
<br />But birthright's a priceless jewel;
<br />For the stomach never can blab
<br />what is eaten.
<br />Wipe your eyes oh queen of my
<br />kingdom!
<br />Albeit with honour and pride you
<br />build a castle,
<br />For mourn have I your
<br />daughters,
<br />And was broken to behold
<br />outcasts.
<br />Consent not!
<br />For never can be upheld by half-
<br />castes
<br />The pride of my woman.

<br />our fathers,
<br />Children born with no father to
<br />cut a navel.
<br />The morning cries, from floating
<br />dead toll, made our early
<br />morning carnival,
<br />As we danced to the melodious
<br />rattling of guns like 'ikoga;'
<br />And the lost of loved ones, the
<br />moon-light tales.
<br />The wailing as deep as black
<br />nights;
<br />As for our strong men,
<br />Step-out is inevitable while for
<br />freedom clamour.
<br />The feminine regime's begun
<br />with an armour;
<br />For no lads to tell the maidens a
<br />sermon,
<br />And our homes bread by widows
<br />at thirty.
<br />With half an eye we perch the
<br />bed in murmur;
<br />Keep ears transmitting like
<br />belisha beacon,
<br />And on high lift the gates of the
<br />nose,
<br />As we yearn to drink not of
<br />halitosis.
<br />On our minds the battle lines will
<br />die and smoulder;
<br />For in our roofs are wars fought
<br />and not surrendered.
<br />These mud houses built on

<br />Made of perfection,
<br />Man in perception cultured.
<br />The eyes and mind none
<br />could nurture;
<br />In uncertainty and errors
<br />life's ventured.
<br />No man's born blank or
<br />filled to the brim!
<br />No! Not one born by
<br />insemination,
<br />Bred behind Eden with the
<br />knowledge of good and evil
<br />for extenuation.
<br />In tongue, the power to
<br />make or mar.
<br />With the arms lies the
<br />strength to strangle,
<br />And give life a torture.
<br />Son, in this is your friend!
<br />Let him in your radar for
<br />unction,
<br />Till be ripe for rapture:
<br />Thou art man in care!
<br /><br />O man, art thou with
<br />desire?
<br />Will power, in the head of a
<br />fool, poisons like viper.
<br />But with wisdom a million
<br />stones to toss.
<br />All my days I've desired to
<br />be like him:
<br />The measure of dust that
<br />invented aeroplane;
<br />The one head who's the
<br />father of faith;
<br />Before every eyes, a man,
<br />translated through heaven's
<br />gate;
<br />On chariots of fire strolled
<br />the streets of gold,
<br />And in its mansions dwells
<br />day and night.
<br />Even within this habitation:
<br />The strong admiration to
<br />grow into whom I wasn't,
<br />Burning desire to become
<br />whom I couldn't, never'd
<br />die.
<br />On this road there're people
<br />to lean for paces.
<br />Learning's sure to come but
<br />in phases;
<br />And in mentors is the catch
<br />to light our faces.
<br />Amongst men is given all
<br />life would offer.
<br />The knowledge you seek is
<br />baked in another.
<br />Son, of this friend let not go,
<br />As you gaze in expectations,
<br />Till be right for
<br />manifestations:
<br />He's thy man in care!
<br /><br />O neck why art thou stiffen?
<br />A hundred turns can't
<br />chasten this lad!
<br />For he would look in their
<br />hands for what's not there.
<br />What he seeks is right,
<br />Where he peeps is nought.
<br />A look within lights the path
<br />to nudity;
<br />Nuisance's bore in threads
<br />of heredity.
<br />Their fingers are buried in
<br />manicure;
<br />Feet sold to pedicure.
<br />To the beats of life they
<br />dance as amateurs;
<br />For their flat bums are
<br />stocked in furnitures.
<br />'Age-tie' hasn't enough
<br />luminosity,
<br />But iron sharpens iron.
<br />Dare look not away!
<br />Son, this is a fellowship of
<br />the ring!
<br />Let her see through your
<br />eyes the glory to reveal,
<br />As she's impacted with the
<br />gift of integrity and zeal,
<br />Till be light to be celebrity:
<br />For thy man in care!
