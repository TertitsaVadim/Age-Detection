Laura wanted me to go out bishops lydeard with her. after about an hour she convinced me to go. i couldnt believe i was going to go out and drink with my head poundin. got out there and went to the Bird (a pu<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cool.gif" alt=":)" />. sat down and got some drinks in. After about 30mins Hannah rang up it was only 7:15 pm and she wanted to meet up. so we went back to Taunton picked her up and came back down the pub. it was someones birthday so everyone was in the pub. but hannah had to be in at about 10pm. so we didnt plan on staying all night like we normally do. Tony and Gibbo came and sat next to us. then Ripper came alone. we was pissed by 9pm. besides Laura because she is pregnant and she is driving (even tho that has never stopped her). Lin walked in pissed as a fart and we blagged her in ringing Hannahs parents to say we are out for a meal and wont be back until 12 ish. toke her outside and it was going well but Lin had only met Hannah once before and forgot her name. she called her Lin so her parents said no. we was stuck no one wanted us to go but Hannah had to be in. she couldnt just stay out cos if she did she would be moved back to Cornwall. in the end Hannah got a lift back with Gibbo's dad so we could stay. i sat there and got completly drunk. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/biggrin.gif" alt=":)" /> i started t cheer up and toby was so drunk he was falling asleep. 
<br />i had this guy come up to me, he was well weird. Laura told me a bit about him. his mum is well known at the pub but i had never seen her or him before. apparently they both can proper sing. and before i knew it they was up there singing. i couldnt believe it they could become famouse. the only problem is he aint really my type. i like the big stong lads and now n again i like the chunky but strong. this lad was just fat. he had a huge beer belly and just horrid. he started off asking me out i said no. so he moved on to asking me to go out on the town with him sometime i still said no. he said we could go somewhere like weston i still said no. then he said he would take me to torquay and take me shopping. after a think i still said no. then Toby btted in sain i was with him. i was so happy that Toby had said that cos after that this guy left me alone. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" /> . only thing is Laura likes Toby and Toby was tring to get it on with me. laura realy didnt like it so i tried to push him off. he toke me outside and asked what was wrong so i told him n he left me alone but he toke my number and texted me all night. at about 4ish we left the pub and went home. laura didnt say anything she just spoke about how we should go see James soon. so i just agreed. she droped me off at my house i got in went into the lil front room and saw some lad at my window. he scared me shittless. i opened the window to see connor stood there frezing i let him in but ended up kicking him out. he just talked about why i wasnt home. he was getting on my tits lol

The Weekend ..x..<br/><br/>the past weekend was mint. i left jamie at home and went out wiv my mates. i met this guy called simon. he was 17 and fit as fuck. i ended up spending the night with him <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/tongue.gif" alt=":)" /> it wasnt a great weekend just because that night. it was also a great weekend because i got to meet wiv all my lovley people get drunk and meet new people <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cool.gif" alt=":)" /> thankyou all by the way. we started off on saturday. at about 4pm we started to drink. it was a great afternoon. we sat up in Danny's room drinking and watching tv. ended up with chris getting done for drink driving lol. after danny's we moved on to connor's for a bit more to drink and a lil bit of a party. i cant believe kyle won our drinking game. im ment to be the best <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/angry.gif" alt=":)" /> i deserved to win lol. na it was all mint. after connors we moved on to trisha's for a lil smoke. but ended up moving back to Danny's where we stayed. That night i ended up in the bottom bunk with shane's smelly feet in my face, hannah snoring and ian moving closer in his sleep. but i wouldnt have changed it for the world. everything that night was wicked.
<br />on sunday i didnt drink as i had to go to BTC (Breaking The Cycle). but we had a good time. we sat up all night talking and laughing.
<br />but this lad simon. oh my god he was good. he was such a sweety aswell. he said he wanted to keep intouch. he toke my number and pfoned me later that night. he was great. i really liked him. its just a shame jamie is such a bastard. im not with jamie but he acts like we are. when we was together we would always argue. its was like us talking. instead of being calm and just listening and talking we would be down eachothers necks. so we split up but stayed friends. we have been on and off for a long time. but not that long ago i decided that it was over for good. i didnt want to go back that way. i just wanted friends n that was it. and he just cant take it. its asif he is obsessed. he just dont fuck off lol <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/blink.gif" alt=":)" />

A mate of mine from lyderard has split up with his girlfriend. i know it doesnt sound bad. but i really thought these to were made for eachother. everyone agreed with me. her name is Amy, her and Toby had been together for ages. to make things worse i found out she had fucked off with Tobys cousin. but it still isnt the end of the story. tobys cousin has got my mate Laura pregnant. so it all goes round in a circal. I feel so sorry for Toby. When i arrived at the pub i saw him sat there just drinking one pint after another. His mum told me that latley he has been feeling really down.  i just wanted to hug him.
<br />Laura on the other hand is pregnant with this son of a bitches baby. toby and his cousin arent talking right now. but Laura is loving it, (i hope that doesnt make her sound evil) she doesnt hate him for what he has done to toby. she hates Amy. no one knows where they stand. its like treding on broken glass when your around them.
<br />Laura is on about beating the shit out of Amy. pregnant or not. i hope it all stops soon.

Last night i went out with Laura, Hannah and Robin to go see Toby. the only thing was is that his cousin Dean wasnt there. that was really weird. Dean was always in that pub. almost everyday. Laura jumped in the car and we went to every pub looking for him n that slag Amy. An hour later and we still hadnt found them <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/wacko.gif" alt=":)" /> where the fuck would they be? Robin wanted to go to the visor. so we went and there was Dean and Amy sat up in the window looking all cosy. nonone else was in the pub. all we did was walk in and Amy looked as if she was shitting herself.
<br />Laura needed the money Dean borrowed off her back. He had got her to buy him a Kevin Bloody Wilson ticket. but then decided he wasnt going. All Laura did was turn around and ask him for a lil bit of money and amy started shitting her self. telling Dean to hurry up and take her home. what a pussy!!
<br /><br />And now its Tuesday. me and Hannah have been in town from about 10ish till about half an hour ago. now its 7:34. We didnt even buy anything besides like 7 cans... ( of coke lol  )... and now its soooo boring. we just got in and my mum has gone mad at us. not so much to Hannah. but she is saying that we have stolen Â£50 off her. i swear she needs to go in a mental home. oh well. im back off to Petes.

The Bird. got there and the place was almost empty. Sat down after getting a round of drinks. Next thing i knew all the lads walked in. I didnt mind but it was the lads i was promised who wouldnt be there. i have nothing against them but we go back years. i met them when i was about 12 years old. we all used to go out on the piss and end up going back to Paddys house. only we used to wake him up at about 4am. the party never ends with us. 
<br />i looked round trying to miss them. only they caught my eye and cam to sit with us. next to me i had Froggy sat staring. i closed my eyes begging he wouldnt remember me. then i was saved by the music. Toby got up to have a sing along. and he dragged the lads with him. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/w00t.gif" alt=":)" /> i was free. but not for long. 
<br />Every one was sat there talking about the old days. and we were all getting along fine. as we stayed tipsy there got pissed. at about 11ish everyone besides Hannah Laura and me was wankered. it was so funny just watching them fall all over the place. then this big lad walked over with his pint. he put it down and walked over to the microfone. he started to sing and fuck me he was good. he could win X Factor if he wanted. he was a kinda biggish lad with a grade one all over. not really my type but good anoth. while me and hannah was singing alone while sipping at the double vodka and cokes hannah had only one thing on her mind. 
<br />Earlyer that day she had read her stars and it said she would meet true love on friday night. so all night she was popping her head everywhere looking for the love of her life. then this lad (the good singer) came over to me.he tried chatting me up but i really wasnt intrested. but how do u tell a guy no with out being horrid. 
<br />at first he was sayin he wants to take me out on the town one night. then he wants to go watch a movie. then he wanted to take me to cornwall and take me shopping. in the end i ran away. i know it was really mean. and if ur reading this im sorry. lol. anyways that was my night. and we all came back with nothing. allthough i didnt have to by one drink. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/biggrin.gif" alt=":)" /> well chuffed lol

Ended up walking up to Asda with her and her oldest son. the little shit used me as a climbing frame but he is cute and sweet so i forgive him <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" />  on the way back i couldnt believe it. i just saw this thing come riding towards me. he went past and i saw it was Dave. A really good mate of mine. i was confuzzled tho as i thought he had gone into the army for 3 years. turns out he left because it was shit.
<br />he came with me up to tasha's and sat on the wall. we was talking about all of the good times and what is going on in our lifes now. but we had to split as i had to go pick up tasha's other kids from skool. after hours of playing i went home and blagged a propper nice top off my mum. it cost a bomb but who cares its nice lol <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/w00t.gif" alt=":)" /> then had my bestest mate hannah come pick me up. we went back to her grandads. i couldnt believe what i was hearing. our mate Stacey is pregnant <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/ohmy.gif" alt=":)" /> and Hannah has fallen out with her. all of this shit is going on. Stacey has been slagging everyone off and i duno what to do about it. Stacey is in the wrong but her hormones are all over the place. well thats her excuse. she cant keep this up for long. latley she has become the biggest bitch ever. she always seemed the sweet one of us all. now she is like the devils child. What would you do if it was ur best mate and another good mate of yours?

		<document id="f3176fa2be5fad31dac1b9c5e829b154" url=""><![CDATA[..x.. Thursday Night ..x..<br/><br/>Just got in and got changed. i got completly fucking drenched. and it wasnt even raining. Cheers for the flowers Connor. they was great babes <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/flowers.gif" alt=":)" />. but anyways. i got wet. and not in that way <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/laugh.gif" alt=":)" /> we went for a stomp round town and ended up down Shanes.sat in the garage and everyone kinda fucked off at about 11 ish. they all went cos they had work and skool. then Ian decided to have a water fight. well we had a lil smoke before and i was feeling it. so i didnt knwo about this water fight untill Ian ran up behind me and stuffed dis bucket of water over my fucking head. can you believe it. that so should not be alowed. to make it worse i had a white top on and we sadly have pics of the whole thing. ended up running up the road after him with his mate Nathan behind me with a water gun and chucking all this grass at me. i had to walk hme but my baby Connor walked with me. bless is lil heart. i got in n i looked fucked. Connor is crashed out on my bed. thank fuck he didnt take up the whole bed as i love my bed. he also gave me flowers.
<br />Connor is so sweet its un real. have known him for about a year now and he just tells me he loves me all the time. he will do anything for me. he keeps asking me to get with him. i dont know why i say no but i keep saying it. he deserves more. i know people just say that but i really meanit. plus they is the problem with Jamie. 
<br />Connor if your reading this. i love u hunni you are a great mate and a legand in my eyes. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/kiss.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/love.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/wub.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/w00t.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/tongue.gif" alt=":)" /> lol
<br />so what should i do? should i carry on saying no and wait till all this shit is sorted with jamie? or should i get with Connor?
<br />the only problem is, if i get with Connor now i dont know if it will go well cos of Jamie. i know it sounds weird and it should be like that but it is. if anyone wants Jamie you can ave him. Come by my house n pick him up. you need to be blonde, blind n death. so u cant see him n what he does. blonde so u dnt get what he says.n death so when he slags u off u dont hear. u also need no sense of smell cos trust me his feet stink. and u cant feel pain lol....
