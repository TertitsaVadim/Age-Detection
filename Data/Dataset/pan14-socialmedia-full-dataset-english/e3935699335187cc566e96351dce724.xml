Important Criminal Defense Tips<br/><br/>It'll probably come of little to no surprise to you that things you hear from others in passing - or the &quot;common advice&quot; about what to do when facing criminal charges - is not always true because the reality is that most legal advice does not apply to everybody in every situation, but is presented as such. For example, &quot;it is never a good idea under any circumstances to blow into a breathalyzer if you've been pulled over for drinking and driving.&quot; Have you heard that one before? Unfortunately this advice can get people into a lot of trouble when, in some situations, they should blow into the breathalyzer because they were not actually over the legal limit. This is why it is important to know how much you have been drinking: in most states it is not illegal to drive after you have been drinking alcohol; it's only illegal to drink and drive if you drink too much alcohol. If you know for a fact that you have been drinking too much then it is advantageous for you to not blow, because a competent defense attorney can help you prove otherwise in court. However, if you've only had one or two drinks and then blow into a breathalyzer, you will be able to take care of the situation then and there - in other words you won't be arrested, you'll be told to get home safely, and that will be the end of it.<br /><br />Another tip for staying safe is to - in all situations - never talk with a police officer when they are accusing you of committing a crime. Remember that phrase &quot;You have the right to remain silent?&quot; That is not a suggestion! It is not a right you should take lightly, because to put it simply: &quot;what you say can and will be used against you&quot; by that police officer in a court of law. That police officer is not required to take what you said and use it in such a way that it helps your case. You also run the risk of what you say being misconstrued at which point you'll have no recourse in court - it's your word versus the police officer's. I found that this blogger showed this simply on this  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fpromealreplacementshakes.com%2F2267%2Fcalorie-dog-snacks-food%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://promealreplacementshakes.com/2267/calorie-dog-snacks-food/</a>  web site.<br /><br />Unfortunately many people think that they can talk their way out of an arrest, but that unfortunately is a pipe dream and not reality. You may feel compelled to tell your side of the story because your innocence. Unfortunately it doesn't matter whether or not you're innocent at the time that they arrest you - your time to prove your innocence will be in a court of law in front of a judge and jury. Untel you get to that point it is absolutely critical to the safety of yourself, your freedoms and your way of life you do not under any circumstances discuss the charges being brought against you with anyone except your attorney. People often wonder why attorneys can be so expensive... The expense often comes from the mess that they have to clean up when their client talks to the police before going to trial. If you follow this one simple step will save yourself a lot of heartache trouble and money. So, in conclusion don't talk to police officers without your defense attorney, and you make your life a lot easier.<br /><br />Finally, should you ever find yourself in the unfortunate situation of needing the help of a defense attorney, it is very important that you don't rely on a public defender if at all possible, but seek the help of a skilled, private criminal defense lawyer. While most public defenders mean well, you will almost always get better results from a private attorney. It may seem like an expensive proposition to hire a defense attorney instead of using a free one, but when you're talking about the possibility of losing your freedom, your way of life, and your good name, you will quickly find that the price of retaining good, competent legal help is easily justified and worth it.<br /><br />In summary, most people don't think about how they'll handle a situation where they are being accused of a crime by the police. They do not think about needing a defense attorney and what they would do in that circumstance. However, it's important to think about these things, and even more important to have a plan in place should you ever face charges. The simple fact is that innocent people do get pulled over, they do get arrested, and if they don't have good legal representation and follow some of these basic guidelines above, then they will face jail time. Don't let this happen to you. It doesn't take much time to research a good criminal defense attorney in your area and have his card or information handy.

He published this novel in 1996 as a serial novel, and the first edition actually came out in six small, paperbacks, which were later made into one novel. King is most well known for his horror novels, so as this summary of the novel &quot;The Green Mile&quot; shows, this book, set in the 1930s, is a departure from some of his other works.<br /><br />Plot<br /><br />The summary of the novel &quot;The Green Mile&quot; includes the plot and setting. The story takes place in 1932 on the E Block (Death Row) in Cold Mountain Penitentiary in Georgia. It is narrated by the main character, Paul, who is the captain of the prison guards who preside over E Block. &quot;The Green Mile&quot; of the title is the corridor between the cells of the cell block that leads to the execution room. The corridor is covered in green linoleum, hence, the &quot;last&quot; or green mile the inmates take to their death.<br /><br />The story follows John Coffey, a large, black inmate convicted of raping and murdering two young white girls, and the other two inmates on death row, along with the guards who watch over them. Coffey is special, as Paul discovers, and he has magical healing abilities that become apparent. He befriends a small white mouse, who he names Mr. Jingles, and heals the mouse when the brutal guard Percy Wetmore tried to kill it. He also heals Paul's kidney infection, and later, Paul spirits him out of the prison to heal the warden's wife's brain tumor. Coffey &quot;transfers&quot; this brain disease to Wetmore, the sadistic guard who the inmates and staff dislike. Wetmore never recovers and spends the rest of his life in a mental institution.<br /><br />Eventually, Paul discovers that Coffey is exceptional in many areas. It turns out he did not murder the two girls, another inmate (William Wharton) did. Coffey does not want to be pardoned, and dies in the electric chair because he cannot bear the cruelties of real life. After his death, Paul discovers that each of the people Coffey has healed live extraordinarily long lives. Paul is 108 at the end of the book, and Mr. Jingles is 64. They have no idea how long they will live, and the novel ends.<br /><br />Characters<br /><br />A summary of the novel &quot;The Green Mile&quot; includes the characters in the novel. I found that this weblog demonstrated this simply on this  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fasktechgeeks.com%2F1931%2Fwhats-kill-flies%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://asktechgeeks.com/1931/whats-kill-flies/</a>   webpage.<br /><br />Paul Edgecombe - Paul is the main character of the novel. A prison guard, by the end of the story he is an old man narrating this part of his life to a friend who is writing his memoir.<br /><br />John Coffey - A nearly 7-foot-tall black man, a convicted murderer awaiting his death sentence on death row in the prison. He befriends a white mouse and heals people of their diseases.<br /><br />Percy Wetmore - A sadistic prison guard who everyone dislikes. He torments the prisoners, tries to kill Mr. Jingles, the mouse, and deliberately botches an execution where the inmate suffers terribly. He keeps his job because he is related to the governor.<br /><br />Eduard Delacroix - A Cajun man convicted of arson, he is essentially a coward. He is the man who dies a horrible death at the hands of Wetmore.<br /><br />William Wharton - Another convict, it turns out he is the one who actually committed the murder attributed to John Coffey. He is wild and frightening, and attempts to disrupt the prison as much as he can before he dies.<br /><br />Mr. Jingles - The white mouse that lives to be 64 and is befriended by John Coffey.

It was the first year I had sponsored the award, and since I had no role in the judging, I was curious to see what book would win. And I was not disappointed by the results. I was excited to hear a historical novel about pirates was the winner because I figured it would be a good read, but I had no idea what a talented writer Dianne Greenlay would be or what a great story she would spin. I was thrilled, after reading &quot;Quintspinner&quot; that it had won, and the award is well-deserved.<br /><br />&quot;Quintspinner&quot; is the story of Tess Willoughby, who lives in 1717 London. Tess, while walking through the marketplace of London, meets an old crone who reveals that Tess is a &quot;quintspinner,&quot; someone who can control five magic rings. The crone says it's proven by the birthmark Tess has. When the crone is soon after murdered, Tess is left with many questions about her past and the destiny that lies before her, as well as the bejeweled ring the crone has left to her. I found that this page described this intelligently on this  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fdslrcamerareviewer.com%2Fcamera-insurance%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://dslrcamerareviewer.com/camera-insurance/</a>   web page.<br /><br />Tess soon after finds herself on a journey to the West Indies with her adoptive parents. Worse, her adoptive father arranges for her betrothal to the man she witnessed murder the crone. But Tess also finds herself falling in love with a young sailor who was pressed into service on the ship along with his father. All these characters are in for the adventure of their lives, as is soon revealed when the ship is attacked by a pirate ship. Without going into the plot further, a great deal of action, high seas adventures, some magic, and a couple twists of fate make &quot;Quintspinner&quot; a novel never to be forgotten and even to be read and enjoyed again and again. Early on, Tess knows there are five spinner rings, but at the end of the novel, she only has three-a sure sign that a sequel is coming, and I can't wait to read it.<br /><br />To me, &quot;Quintspinner&quot; is the quintessential pirate adventure novel. It reminded me of &quot;Treasure Island,&quot; but it was much more fast-paced and interesting than that somewhat boring book, and it reminded me of &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot; for its action and magic, but without the quirky and somewhat stupid characterizations of those films. Like a good adventure movie-and this book would make an excellent film-we move from scene to scene, fluctuating between two storylines that soon come together. The settings in London, on the high seas, and in the West Indies create great visual scenes as a backdrop for a tale of love, adventure, secrets, and magic. I hope the epic Disney film version is not far off.<br /><br />What I most appreciated about &quot;Quintspinner&quot; was the powerful, effective writing. The book is Dianne Greenlay's first published novel, but I suspect she has been working at her craft for quite some time. She knows how to write crisp, tight dialogue, effective scenes, and short chapters that keep the plot moving, keep the action going, and keep the reader interested. More than a writer, she is a true novelist for how she masterfully handles all the elements that make good fiction.<br /><br />If you love a great adventure novel, put &quot;Quintspinner&quot; at the top of your list. You won't be disappointed.

This lake is supposed to be the home of more fish species than that of any other body of freshwater on Earth, which isn't too surprising once you hear the fact that Lake Malawi is also the eighth largest lake in the world. Nestled in the Great Rift Valley system of East Africa, it is also Africa's third largest lake.<br /><br />People have depended for over a thousand years for food from the bountiful wildlife that resides in Lake Malawi, home of over a thousand species of cichlids, and provider of tasty fish such as kampango, a catfish. Many species of fish have evolved from the waters of Lake Malawi, most notably cichlids, and various other animals. Naturally, at least a few extremely exotic species of fish have evolved from these waters, such as the rare Mbuna fish, highly sought after by avid aquarists due to its brilliant coloring. As a result, the lake is not only a huge source of food, but also the source of work for thousands of Malawian fishermen, net and canoe manufacturers, and fish traders. Unfortunately, overfishing and water pollution threatens the potential future of the wildlife here. I found that this webmaster showed this intelligently on this  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fbassguitarsreviewed.com%2Fanswers-guitar-hero-xbox-series-1-2-3-4-5-world-tour-play-songs%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://bassguitarsreviewed.com/answers-guitar-hero-xbox-series-1-2-3-4-5-world-tour-play-songs/</a>  weblog.<br /><br />Lake Malawi is an attractive tourist location, with most of its tourists visiting during the dry season, which lasts from April to November. The wet season, on the other hand, lasts from December to March. Because the wet season is preceded by a very hot and humid period between November and December, the dry season is the most ideal season for visiting Lake Malawi.<br /><br />The Malawian government has taken great strides in ensuring that the lake does not become too commercialized or overcrowded, and they have done a good job so far. The northern portion of the lake is largely untouched by tourists, and therefore lies in a pristine, unspoiled condition. The beaches are almost never crowded. One of the main forms of human activity you will see at Lake Malawi will probably be that of the fish traders, who vend thousands upon thousands of silver-colored fish that are dried, smoked, and sold in huts.<br /><br />Most of the permanent settlements, hotels, and campsites, however, can only be found on the southern portion of the lake. There, one can snorkel, dive, sail, and do pretty much any sort of fun recreational activity that can be done on any major beach. The lake itself possesses a beautifully warm temperature of 74 to 85 degrees Fahrenheit year-round. Before anyone actually visits Lake Malawi, they should know that malaria is a concern here, so tourists should try their best to minimize mosquito bites by using insect repellents, and trying to sleep in mosquito net-treated edifices. Never let your guard down against the mosquitoes.<br /><br />In conclusion, Lake Malawi has experienced a ton of historical legacies, ranging from being the host of a naval battle between the British and the Germans, to being the evolutionary site of an eclectic range of over 450 species of freshwater tropic fish. Its sheer size alone is enough to suggest that it still holds its fair share of untold mysteries that have yet to be discovered.

And would you be surprised an additional 125 to 500 million second hand balls are sold also within a year? Unless you work in selling golf merchandise I am betting not. When the question comes around about the worth of recycled balls many professional and experts like to discount the balls. There is an old theory that balls get affected by water and using those lake balls will hamper your game. I found that this individual showed this smartly on this  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Ftreadmillevolution.com%2Fquestions-answers-sport-tougher-bigger-body-grow-muscles%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://treadmillevolution.com/questions-answers-sport-tougher-bigger-body-grow-muscles/</a>  page.<br /><br />If you look at any golf shop on a golf course you will find them selling used balls. These balls are usually water balls rescued from the water traps on their course. For these courses it makes sense to keep their waters clean and bring in additional revenue. For you does it make sense to use these balls?<br /><br />First you need to answer this question, what level of golfer are you? For those that are learning the game and have no clue on spinning a ball or a fade then of course purchasing recycled balls is a smart idea. The cost difference between new golf balls and lake balls will save the new player a tremendous amount of money in the long term. It also makes it a lot easier for a new player to swing and hit the ball in the water and try again. With new balls nobody wants to keep splashing down. With used ball prices it's more feasible for most to take a second crack at a shot.<br /><br />When your game starts improving then you can start debating on how you should spend your money on golf equipment. I would still look for used balls that look to still have quality with them. There was a study by GolfBallTest.org that states that the recycled balls they tested that were marked as highest quality or near new had no difference in performance of the ball. For those that hate to sacrifice on quality this is should help ease your mind.<br /><br />When it comes down to choose which type of ball is best option for any golfer is to test and go from there. Some golfers will never feel a difference hitting different balls. For others they might get to a level where using new balls will be beneficial to their game. Until you get there just stick with the recycled your wallet will be happier.

Maybe you blew it - big time. You said or did something that was completely not cool that your girlfriend finally threw up her hands and left. Now you're crying in your beer, or sitting around in your boxers, or sending her inappropriate emails/texts/messages, while your circle of friends looks on shaking their heads, because you are basically a big mess, and truth be told, you want her back. So, ask yourself the question - how do I win my ex girlfriend back? There is no perfect strategy, since everyone is different. There are, however, a few things you can do to help yourself out if messed up with your lady love. I found that this webpage explained this intelligently on this  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fpleaseaskit.com%2F8612%2Faint-funny-kind-advice-girls-give-guys%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://pleaseaskit.com/8612/aint-funny-kind-advice-girls-give-guys/</a>  weblog.<br /><br />Win My Ex Girlfriend Back Tip#1: Stop falling apart. Now that you have a lot more free time than you used to, spend it doing things that make you look and/or feel better. Go running, take a martial arts class, learn another language, or join a volunteer program. Find something you can put your energy into that gives you a sense of pride. Being able to interact with your ex the next time you see her with your head held high, will go a long to reminding her why she was attracted to you in the first place.<br /><br />Win My Ex Girlfriend Back Tip#2: Remember the good things and don't dwell on the bad. This is very difficult when you are in the middle of a breakup, but if you can pull it off, your ex will definitely reassess. Angry, resentful, bitter people are not attractive. If you can be genuinely grateful for the good things you still have going on in your life, and remain positive about the happy things around you, your ex will see you as someone who could potentially bring positive energy back into their lives, instead of anger and negativity.<br /><br />Win My Ex Girlfriend Back Tip#3: Chill out. Don't run after her with your hat in your hands and your head down. The truth is that you both probably need the space. Allow the space to occur. &quot;Absence makes the heart grow fonder&quot; isn't just a lot of hot air. Sometimes taking a breather is important as it helps you examine what's working and what isn't about the relationship. So, take a deep breath and leave your ex alone.<br /><br />Win My Ex Girlfriend Back Tip#4: Get on with your life. Don't get stuck in the &quot;I had it and I lost it&quot; vortex. Go out and meet people, see theater, go to concerts, or join a club. Don't turn into a hermit because she left. You were okay before you met her. You'll be okay after her. If she runs into you on the street and you are actually doing all right, she'll have to ask herself why she left such a great guy.

The name &quot;slinky loops&quot; comes from the shape that is created when the tubing is tied into concentric coils. The purpose of this procedure is to make the long lengths of pipe more manageable during installation and to be able to construct a consistent heat exchanger in a given amount of space. Not all horizontal closed loop systems are constructed in the slinky method, some just lay out the pipe in a down and back layout.<br /><br />A slinky is most easily constructed by using a jig made out of plywood with edges to contain the tubing. Measured marks can be drawn onto the jig to give you a reference point for sizing the overlap (pitch) of the slinky as you build it. It will take three people to most effectively build a slink. One will do the tying, one will feed the coils to the one doing the tying, and one will pull the slinky along out the back of the jig as it is built. It will take three people approx. 20 min to tie an 800' slinky once they are up and rolling.<br /><br />The first step is to determine how long of a slinky you need to build based on the loop field design. A chart that shows the lengths of slinky coils based on tube length, pitch of coils, and diameter of coils can be found here. A length of tubing will be pulled off the roll that is the needed length to be the return from the very end of the coil back to where the manifold will be; this portion will be straight. Once this is pulled off the coil you can begin tying the tubing into loops.<br /><br />The first loop will be tied into whatever diameter you made the jig (36&quot; is good). The second loop will be laid over the first loop by whatever pitch is needed to make your total length work. For example if you have a 36&quot; coil with a 18&quot; pitch you would lay each coil approximately half over the one in front of it. It your length called for 36&quot; loops with 36&quot; pitch you would not overlap them at all but simply place each loop end to end as you tie the coil. Plastic zip ties are the preferred product for tying the loops. I found that this webmaster showed this smartly on this <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3Byb21lYWxyZXBsYWNlbWVudHNoYWtlcy5jb20vMTc3OS93aGV5LXByb3RlaW4tYm9keS1idWlsZGluZy8_" target="_blank">Cyril Caruth</a> web site.<br /><br />When you get near the end be sure to leave enough left untied to make it back to the manifold location. The first part of the coil that was left uncoiled can now be tied along the coil as it makes it's way back to the &quot;front&quot; of the coil. Both ends should now be close to equal distance from the loops and both at the front of the coil where you will build the manifold. Tape the ends of the pipe to keep dirt out if they don't already have caps.<br /><br />The final step is rolling the slinky into a donut roll which will actually resemble more of a giant birds nest but will in fact be fairly manageable and transportable. Simply start at the &quot;end&quot; (not the &quot;front&quot; where the lines are) and roll the thing up. Try to keep it as in line as possible when rolling it up.<br /><br />The slinky is now ready for transport. It will take two people to carry it due to both weight and shape. It can be transported in a truck of trailer to the job site if you built it elsewhere. Once onsite carry it to the trench or pit where it will spend its life and unroll it. If it is going in a trench I would suggest unrolling it besides the trench at the top and then with several people throw it into the trench. Be sure that the coil lays flat in the bottom of the trench but be careful if entering trenches that could collapse. The safer way would be to use a long pole to situate the slinky as needed.<br /><br />When bedding the loop field be sure the fill material is sufficient to provide good contact with the pipe without leaving air gaps and be sure that big rocks are not dropped on the pipe. In rocky soil screening the soil and bedding the pipe in two feet of fines is recommended. After proper bedding the tubing the rest of the back filling can be done and the area compacted.

The Loop is a 600km circuit that starts and finishes in Chiang Mai taking you through the Mae Hong Son province via Mae Sariang, Mae Hong Son town and Pai. Its the best route to take to cover the province and recommended for nature lovers, trekkers, motorcyclists, off-road adventures and in those wanting to delve deeper into Northern Thailand to experience a traditional and authentic area.<br /><br />The legs for the loop and driving distances are as follows:<br /><br />Chiang Mai - Pai 128km <br />&lt;br&gt;Pai - Mae Hong Son 109km <br />&lt;br&gt;Mae Hong Son -Mae Sariang 164km <br />&lt;br&gt;Mae Sai - Chiang Mai 190km<br /><br />The route above assumes doing the loop in an anti-clockwise direction, but it can also be done the opposite way stopping at Mae Sariang first. Overnight stops are recommended at each of the major towns (Mae Sariang, Mae Hong Son, Pai) and from here you can take a 1 day or more excursion before continuing back on the loop. There are numerous tour operators in each of the towns offering a variety of sights and activities such as visits to hilltribe villages, white water rafting, elephant riding, waterfalls and trekking. Being more remote and less touristic the area is known to have more authentic treks than the ones offered in Chiang Mai and so is popular amongst real trekking enthusiasts. I found that this webmaster showed this simply on this <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3NvZmFzcmV2aWV3cy5jb20vbm9ydG9uLWZ1cm5pdHVyZS1mcm9nLWNvdWNoLWNvbW1lcmNpYWwtY2xpcC8_" target="_blank">Gaynell Jerrell</a>  web page.<br /><br />The loop needs a minimum of 4 days to cover but you could easily spend a week taking your time to explore villages and remote areas off the main route. On the last part of the loop from Mae Sariang to Chiang Mai you can even take the slightly scenic route via Doi Inthanon Mountain and National Park, the highest point in Thailand.<br /><br />The loop can be done by bus with several buses departing daily from each of the towns. Otherwise hiring a car or motorbike are other options, which would also be needed to explore the outlying areas unless you sign up for a tour.<br /><br />If driving yourself make sure you feel comfortable driving mountainous roads with steep uphill and down hairpin turns.

Contained in this article is some basic information, which has been collected from experts and owners alike, about Yellow Bellied Sliders. With these tips and advice added to your own knowledge, you should be able to decide if the <br />&lt;br&gt;Yellow Turtle is the right kind of pet for you to purchase. If you are presently an owner, this information will provide you with useful counsel on how to make your pets healthier and thrive.<br /><br />As its name suggests, the bottom part of the shell (known as the plastron) of a yellow belly turtle is predominantly yellow, highlighted with green specks along the edges.<br /><br />It is interesting to note that this species has the capacity to interbreed with other species, such as Red Eared Sliders. Mating can take place in spring, fall, and summer. The female Yellow Bellied Sliders are normally larger than the males.<br /><br />As hatchlings, this type of turtle requires an aquarium filled with up to 10 gallons of water. The Yellow Turtle will, however, need more space as it grows older. You should also make sure that their housing is large enough to allot an area in which the turtles can wander around, bask, and dry off completely after they have finished swimming. Even though direct sunlight is always the best choice for their lighting needs, you can improvise if necessary by placing a UV-B heat lamp in their tank in order to maintain an average temperature of 89-95 degrees Fahrenheit. I found that this individual described this simply on this <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2Jpa2VyZXZpZXdzaGFjay5jb20vMjQzMy93cm9uZy0xMjVjYy1tb3RvcmJpa2Uv" target="_blank">Nan Modisette</a> blog post.<br /><br />As your turtles grow, it is also advisable to provide a nesting place for the females. Make sure to construct a place that will be safe for the female to lay her eggs on, and for the eggs to hatch.<br /><br />Yellow Belly Turtles, like others in their family, naturally produce a lot of waste. You should, therefore, invest in the best filter you can afford, which should keep the water clean and clear for the longest time possible. Another point to consider: Small and colorful pebbles, sold in pet shops, may produce a pleasing aesthetic effect to your pet's housing, but they will only make the cleaning of your turtle's house more tedious and difficult. Perhaps it will be best, then, to steer clear of these decorations.<br /><br />Like the majority of turtles, the Yellow Turtle is omnivorous. This large array of food options makes feeding your pets simple and easy. Plants such as elodea can be left in the water where you keep your turtles.<br /><br />You can also provide your yellow belly turtles with escarole, romaine lettuce, collard greens, freshly killed fish, and small insects. As turtles have become more and more popular in the pet trade, commercially-prepared reptile food and vitamins are now manufactured and available in the market. These can also help in keeping your turtles healthy.<br /><br />As time progresses, your pet will eventually associate your approach to his feeding time. Whenever you move towards him, if you notice the turtle swimming back and forth expecting food, bear in mind that there must be a limit to the amount of food you should offer your pet daily. Do not overfeed him, because obesity is a common problem in pet turtles.<br /><br />Turtles are said to require more time and effort from their owners than other pets, but this should not discourage you from keeping them. Yellow Belly Turtles are excellent additions to your household: Your care and love ensure that they will be with you for years to come!

In fact, martial arts are often considered spiritual disciplines as much as they are physical ones. In Taekwondo, for instance, morality and spirituality are just as important as physicality, considering Taekwondo focuses on truth and justice rather than on power and might. When it comes to determining the appropriate level of moral and mental development required for advancement, different schools and different masters set their own unique standards.<br /><br />Taekwondo Master Al Quiceno, who runs the Panthers Martial Arts school in Suffer, New York, says that every school is a little different, as they depend on the master's requirements. In Quiceno's case, students have to prove their responsibility by taking care of a raw egg for a week. They have to create a scrapbook that demonstrates their understanding of the history of Taekwondo, as well as other assorted techniques. But the trials don't end there. In order to get a black belt, Quiceno's students have to take him on at chess, as well as display their peak physical condition with a three-mile run and 1000 repetitions with a skipping rope, on top of their typical sparring sessions.<br /><br />Far from being unusual, Quinceno's standards seem to be the norm, as students at Westchester Martial Arts Academy in Eastchester, New York, have to undergo similar trials before they reach the coveted black belt. Chuck Giangreco, an instructor at Westchester Martial Arts Academy, requires his students to pass an oral exam, as well as run martial arts classes so that they can prove their communication and leadership skills. I think that this blog showed this nicely on this <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RoYWlsYW5kbXVheWNhbXAuY29tL2Fyb3VuZC10aGUtZ3lt" target="_blank">muay thai gym thailand</a> post.In addition to the standard martial arts routines, he also requires students to pass running, push-up and pull-up tests. According to Giangreco, achieving a black belt is akin to a form of higher education, which justifies all the extra work and additional requirements.<br /><br />JoJo Guarin, a Jiu-Jitsu instructor at Gracie Barra Academy in White Plains, New York, says that mental toughness plays a big role in obtaining a black belt, but that there are other factors that are equally important. At Gracie Barra, for instance, attitude is essential to advancement. Guarin says that students who display a general bad attitude to life will not be awarded a black belt as it will reflect poorly on their instructors. So, while students may be at the peak of their physical powers, and perform equally well in a variety of cognitive tests, unless they display a positive attitude to life, they will be denied the ultimate prize in martial arts.<br /><br />Bruce Lee, who is probably the most famous martial arts practitioner that the world has ever known, did not subscribe to the notion of belts, but that is not a philosophy that sits well with many modern day instructors. Giangreco feels that the belt system is extremely useful, as it keeps people striving to achieve more and constantly improve. This opinion is endorsed by Cynthia Estevez, a 17 year-old Taekwondo practitioner from Panthers Martial Arts. Estevez says, &quot;Just being a black belt is a big deal ... It's a cool thing because it's not something a lot of people have, so it's special.&quot;<br /><br />Recommended site:<br /><br />[<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.lohud.com%2Fapps%2Fpbcs.dll%2Farticle%3FAID%3D2008806170354"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.lohud.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=2008806170354</a>]

A workout should be tailored based on a persons age, individual differences,prior exercise routines and overall fitness levels.It is always advisable to do a few stretching exercises before actually beginning the work out as it makes the muscles warm and flexible. This way one can avoid strains and muscle pulls.<br /><br />An ideal warm up should last at least 15 minutes and can include slow jogging in one place, jumping jacks to activate the cardio and lung systems followed by some slow stretching that help relax the muscles and get the joints in form. Warm ups that are too short can lead to severe stretched or torn cartilage that may take awhile to heal.<br /><br />Do not get intimidated by quack trainers or friends who influence you into getting up and vigorously exercising just days after you have recovered from an injury,surgery or weakened condition. Although physical therapy sometimes involve exercises that might be a little discomforting, it is harmful to over exercise just a short period after recovering.<br /><br />Although each of us wants to achieve our fitness goals it shouldn't come at a heavy price. By overdoing work outs and trying to prove we are 'mentally tough 'we are in fact doing more harm to our bodies than good by maximizing health and attaining a strong and fully toned body.<br /><br />Before beginning a new routine,always make sure you are aware of the correct techniques.Incorrect technique is one of the most common causes of injury after short warm ups and over exercising. Do not be embarrassed to ask how a particular equipment works as everyone learns sometime or the other about it so there is nothing to feel awkward about.<br /><br />Always be aware and conscious of your surroundings while exercising. It is very easy to lose balance on a treadmill, trip on a pavement while jogging or crash into an approaching car or bicycle if one is not aware.Pay close attention to surfaces so that you don't trip and have good reflexes.<br /><br />Exercise however much you can without overdoing it because injuries caused by over working ones muscles may sometimes deter a person from exercising again.The key is to start with the levels you can handle and gradually increase your ability to do more.Your health and body will thus be benefited greatly.

Anything in life can be accomplished if we truly want to succeed at it. If we want to start a business, we jump in with passion and drive and give it all we got. Why then do we let our own personal well being fall to the wayside? We all need that extra motivation to propel us to do things. Sometimes things we don't like to do. I believe that with the right attitude and a change of perspective, we can set out to do any task with passion. Let's look at ways you can create a healthier mindset to help you propel your health and fitness goals.<br /><br />Create a strong enough &quot;why&quot; to exercise.<br />&lt;br&gt;Any thing that we do in life, we do for a reason or a desired final outcome. It is so important to have a strong desire or reason why you should workout and lead a healthy lifestyle. Grab a small notebook or sheet of paper and start listing all the benefits you will derive if you stuck to a healthy lifestyle and exercise regime. For example, look great in my new black dress, have more energy in the evenings and lower my cholesterol level. When your motivation starts to waver, pull out your list and rev yourself up to take the necessary actions.<br /><br />Get support from others<br />&lt;br&gt;Enlist the help of supportive friends. &quot;Supportive&quot; being the key word. Many friends and family can subconsciously undermine our efforts for positive change as it can highlight weaknesses in their own life and make them feel like you are leaving them behind. Be specific when you ask for help. Ask them to help you by not offering you treats or &quot;junk&quot; foods unnecessarily. Ask them to call you each day to check you did your workouts. In some cases you may need the help of a trainer to really give you a motivational boost.<br /><br />Use the power of awareness<br />&lt;br&gt;This is a lot easier said than done. Most of us try in vain to be in the moment, but our present conditioning and circumstances make us multitask even whilst eating and working out. Instead of striving for perfection, aim to workout and eat meals in silence and with no distractions some of the time. Allow yourself to think and just be in the moment. I personally believe that this web page demonstrated this intelligently on the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RoYWlsYW5kbXVheWNhbXAuY29tLw__" target="_blank">jiu jitsu gi</a> post. Focus on the sensations of working your body or the taste and flavors of food whilst eating.<br /><br />Commitment for Success<br />&lt;br&gt;Sometimes things happen in our life that give us a fright and we make a commitment to make changes. For some, a potential illness makes us readdress our priorities and for others an insult or criticism can help push us into making changes. Most of us though fall into a rut and get pleasure out of being complacent about our health and fitness. We need to draw a line in the sand and commit to sticking at a plan of action to increase our wellbeing. When you are committed, something like the weather or the time of day doesn't stop you from following through. Tackle any challenges and then next time round you will have less resistance.<br /><br />Analyze for success<br />&lt;br&gt;Sometimes it pays to stop and analyze your behaviors and actions. Ask yourself why you may have stuck to a workout plan in the past. Was it because you had someone to be accountable to? Was it because you got really sick and decided not to let yourself go that far again? Whatever the reasons, aim to recreate that situation or condition and see if that helps you succeed again at your plan.<br /><br />Enjoy your treats<br />&lt;br&gt;Deprivation will always lead to a binge. When we deprive ourselves of our favorite foods, we set up an unrealistic situation. Instead choose a day of the week you can have this treat. Think about portion sizes and enjoy the treat while you have it. Eat in pure awareness and satisfy the urge for another week. Life should be enjoyed, so long periods of deprivation no matter the object, is always the wrong way to go about it!<br /><br />Reward yourself.<br />&lt;br&gt;This is a must. Slot out on a calendar a 90 day period and incrementally put in rewards such as going to the movies, getting a message or just relaxing. Set the conditions for being able to redeem these rewards, such as you must have completed at least 4 workouts per week for 4 weeks to get the reward at the 4 week mark.<br /><br />Just these handfuls of tips can be enough for you to start to make a true lifestyle out of eating well and consistently exercising. Remember if you aren't enjoying your workout, change it. If you don't like certain foods, change your menu plan. Aim to enjoy the process, think about why you are doing it and seek the support of those around you so you can create the very achievable, wellbeing feeling.
