<br />Until one day... her life crashed.
<br /><br />Mom: Wake up honey. Chris is downstairs waiting for you.
<br /><br />Sarah: Oh my gosh. I woke up too late! I still need a shower and everything!
<br /><br />Right when she said that Chris walked into her room smiling from ear to ear.
<br /><br />Chris: No baby. You're beautiful just like that- now come on, I'm starving.
<br /><br />Sarah: Okay.
<br /><br />Sarah got out of bed, put on some clothes, took his hand, and walked out the door to his car and got in.
<br /><br />Sarah: Where are we going? Remember that I have to be home by 1. I have cheerleading practice and you have football.
<br /><br />Chris: I know..
<br /><br />Then Sarah noticed that Chris was really pale-looking.
<br /><br />Sarah: Chris are you feeling okay? You look like you're sick..
<br /><br />Chris: Yeah; it's just my allergies.
<br /><br />Sarah: Are you sure? Did you go to the doctor yet?
<br /><br />Chris: Yeah.. I went yesterday. They just said to take some allergy pills and that I'll be okay.
<br /><br />Sarah turned to look away from Chris.
<br />She knew there was something wrong.
<br />She has allergies and she doesn't look like that.
<br />Then he reached out and held her hand.
<br /><br />Sarah: Chris your hands are so cold. I dont think you're okay tell me what's really wrong.. do we need to go back to the house?
<br /><br />Chris: I promise you baby; everything is okay.. they told me to go back tomorrow but I'm not going because there's nothing wrong with me.
<br /><br />Sarah: Chris you need to go! If they told you to then there is something wrong!
<br /><br />Chris let go of her hand and turned back to the road and didn't talk to her the rest of the way.
<br />Sarah just looked at him.
<br />They finally pullled up to the resturaunt and ate breakfast.
<br /><br />Chris: Did you bring your cheerleading stuff or do we have to go back to your house to get it?
<br /><br />Sarah: I have it.. do you really think you should go to football practice like that ?
<br /><br />Chris: Yes Sarah. I'm fine.
<br /><br />Sarah: If you say so..
<br /><br />Chris: Sarah, baby, would I lie to you?
<br /><br />Sarah: No...
<br /><br />They got back in the car and went to the field.
<br />They got out and started practice.
<br />Sarah was practicing a new cheer, but then out of no where she heard a boy yell,
<br /><br />&quot;HE'S NOT MOVING SOMEONE CALL 911! HELP COACH!&quot;
<br /><br />Right when she heard that she turned around and saw Chris on the ground just laying there, not moving.
<br />She ran to him but her dad pushed her back.
<br /><br />Dad: No honey. You shouldn't be right here.
<br /><br />Sarah started to cry.
<br /><br />Sarah: Daddy. What happened? Is he okay?
<br /><br />Dad: Honey. Please just go back with your coach.
<br /><br />Sarah walked back and sat on the bench with her head in her hands while an ambulance came and took him away.
<br />She got in the car with her dad and they went to the hospital.
<br />When they got there his mom was already there and talking to the doctor.
<br />They walked over and listened...
<br /><br />Doctor: You may want to sit down for this.
<br /><br />Chris's Mom: Is he okay?
<br /><br />Doctor: Ma'am.. your son has lukiemia. We can put him on treatments, but he might not make it because the cancer has already spread too much.
<br /><br />Sarah was shocked and began to cry on her dads shoulder.
<br /><br />Chris's Mom: Treatments?
<br /><br />Doctor: Well the treatments would cause hair loss... but it will help slow the cancer down.
<br /><br />Chris's Mom: But he's certain to die?
<br /><br />Doctor: Yes.. but we have had this surgery to clear out the clogs.. but it's possible that he will not make it.
<br /><br />Chris's Mom: I will have to talk to him about this. Can we see him now?
<br /><br />Doctor: Yes. One at a time though.
<br /><br />Chris's mom looked over at Sarah and hugged her tight she knew that Sarah loved him with all her heart.
<br /><br />Chris's Mom: You go first sweetheart.
<br /><br />Sarah: Are you sure?
<br /><br />Chris's Mom: Yes honey.
<br /><br />Sarah walked slowly to his room and turned the knob.
<br />She just stood there, looking at him lying there weak.
<br />He was so pale and he had tubes surrounding him.
<br />It was painful for her to look at him.
<br />Chris looked at her and weakly smiled at her.
<br />She went over and kneeled down beside him.
<br /><br />Chris: Did they already tell you?
<br /><br />Sarah: Yes...
<br /><br />Chris: I'm sorry Sarah. I didn't want you to find out like this.
<br /><br />Sarah: It's okay; I understand Chris.
<br /><br />Chris: Baby I love you so much.
<br /><br />Chris reached up and slowly ran his fingers through her hair.
<br /><br />Sarah: I love you too Chris. With all my heart.. and I will be here for you 'till the end.
<br /><br />Chris: Im going to be okay Sarah.
<br /><br />The nurse walked in with Chris's mom.
<br /><br />Nurse: Its her turn now.
<br /><br />Chris looked at Sarah.
<br /><br />Chris: Bye baby.
<br /><br />Sarah: Bye.
<br /><br />Sarah kneeled down and softly kissed his cold lips.
<br /><br />Months went by and Chris lost his hair, but they were still deeply in love and Sarah was by him everyday.
<br />Chris was getting worse to where he couldn't even play football, and the championship game was coming up.
<br /><br />Chris was sitting on Sarah's porch with her and her dad.
<br /><br />Chris: Coach.. I wanna play tomorrow.
<br /><br />Dad: Chris I know you do.. but I can't let you do that.. you'll get hurt.
<br /><br />Chris: No, coach. Please. This might be the last time on the field for me. I want to be able to play one more time.
<br /><br />Dad looked at Chris and then at Sarah.
<br />Sarah nodded her head.
<br /><br />Dad: You're a strong boy, Chris, and very brave. I think we can do this.
<br /><br />Chris: Thank you so much coach.
<br /><br />Sarahs dad nodded his head.
<br /><br />Dad: So what are you two doing tonight?
<br /><br />Chris: I wanna show Sarah something if that's okay.
<br /><br />Dad: Of course; you two be careful.
<br /><br />Chris took Sarah's hand and lead her to his car.
<br />It was completely dark outside when they pulled up to the football field.
<br /><br />Sarah: What are we doing here?
<br /><br />Chris: Follow me.
<br /><br />Chris grabbed a blanket and laid it down onto the field.
<br />They both laid there looking at the stars.
<br /><br />Sarah: This is so beautiful.
<br /><br />Chris: I do this often. I wanted to show you the place I love.
<br /><br />Sarah: Do you remember the flowers you gave me on our very first date?
<br /><br />Chris: Sure I do; I gave you lillies; your favorite.
<br /><br />Sarah: Yeah... I'll never forget that day.
<br /><br />Chris: I want you to always remember something Sarah.
<br /><br />Sarah: What is it?
<br /><br />Chris: I will always be with you.. and I will always love you.. you're my one and only..
<br /><br />Sarah started tearing.
<br /><br />Sarah: I love you so much, Chris.
<br /><br />Chris: And I also want you to be happy.. I want you to marry someone, have kids, make a family, just live a happy life for me.
<br /><br />Sarah: No. I will never marry anyone.. im marrying you Chris
<br /><br />Chris: Just don't forget what I told you.
<br /><br />Chris leaned in and kissed her.
<br />She pushed him off and jumped up
<br /><br />Sarah: You still think you can catch me?
<br /><br />Chris: Oh yeah. I'm stronger than I look.
<br /><br />Sarah: Then come get me.
<br /><br />Chris stood up and chaised her around the football feild until he finally caught her.
<br />He laid on top of her and put her hands behind her back and held her there so she couldn't move.
<br />Then it started to rain and they were getting soaked but they didn't care.
<br /><br />Chris looked deep into her eyes.
<br /><br />Chris: Who's the weak one now huh?
<br /><br />Sarah: Me (she giggled)
<br /><br />Chris: Remember what you told me that night when we were at dinner?
<br /><br />Sarah: No.. what?
<br /><br />Chris: You have always wanted to kiss in the rain with the one you love.
<br /><br />Sarah: Yeah?
<br /><br />Chris: Well your wish is my comand.
<br /><br />Chris leaned down and kissed her deeply.
<br />He pulled away.
<br /><br />Chris: You're so beautiful.
<br /><br />Sarah: You're such a good kisser. (she laughed.. so did he)
<br /><br />Chris: I better get you home.
<br /><br />They got into the car and went home.
<br />It was hard for them to sleep that night but they did.
<br />It was finally the big day and they were all at the football field.
<br />Chris had on all his football gear, and Sarah was ready to cheer him on.
<br />The game began.
<br />The crowd was going wild for Chris while Sarah was cheering her heart out for him.
<br />The score was 36 to 36.
<br />All they had to do was make one more point and they would win.
<br />Chris had the ball and ran with all he had to the touchdown line and threw the ball down.
<br />He had made a touch down!
<br />Everyone was cheering.
<br />They had won the game!
<br />But for Chris.. he may have lost his life.
<br />He fell to the ground trying to catch his breath.
<br />Sarah ran to him and kneeled down over him.
<br />He looked up at her gasping for breath.
<br />Everyone was heading to field.
<br />Her dad stood infront of them.
<br /><br />Dad: Back away.. give them a moment please.. that's my daughter's love.
<br /><br />Chris gently raised his hand and whiped her tears away.
<br /><br />Sarah: Don't die Chris.. I need you.. I love you..
<br /><br />Chris: I told you this was my dream to win the championship.. to be in the big game.. to die on this feild.. I made history.
<br /><br />Sarah leaned down and kissed him, knowing this was the last she would ever kiss him, the last time she would ever talk to him.
<br />She had so much to say but had no time to say it.
<br /><br />Chris: I love you baby. Tell Mom I love her too.. and tell coach thank you.
<br /><br />Sarah: I love you Chris. I love you so much.
<br /><br />Chris: I'll wait for you.....
<br /><br />Chris's hand dropped and he let go.
<br />He died that night on the football feild.
<br />Sarah cried for 2 months straight.
<br />Sarah was lying on her bed when her dad walked in.
<br /><br />Dad: Honey, it's been 2 months. Please get up. He would want you to have fun and be happy.
<br /><br />Sarah: I know..
<br /><br />Dad: Guess what.
<br /><br />Sarah: What?
<br /><br />Dad: They are building a new stadium. Isn't that great honey? Come on, I want you to come with me before they tear the old one down.
<br /><br />Sarah got up and went with her dad to the field.
<br />They climbed to the top of the bleachers and looked down.
<br /><br />Sarah: It's like it was just yesterday. He was out therethrowingthefootball,makingthattouchdown.
<br /><br />Her dad wrapped his arms around her and she began to cry.
<br /><br />Dad: I know baby.. I know.
<br /><br />Then Sarah noticed something on the feild.
<br /><br />Sarah: Whats that daddy? Look. (Sarah pointed to the field)
<br /><br />Dad: Look like some flowers are blooming.
<br /><br />Sarah: Oh my gosh, daddy! Stop them! Don't let them tear this down! Please! Chris planted me something!!!
<br /><br />Her dad ran down there and stopped them.
<br />Weeks later the flowers had bloomed.
<br />Her and her dad went to look at them.
<br />They were lillies that left a message saying, &quot;I Love You&quot;.
<br />If you have any heart at all and love someone this much repost this.
<br />(OR if you cried)

<br />Boy: What??
<br />Girl: I really like you. And I ... I think I'm falling in love with you.
<br />Boy: Ok ...
<br />Girl: What do you mean &quot;ok”??
<br />Boy: I don't like you like that...
<br />Girl: Why not??
<br />Boy: I can't tell you ... maybe another time ...
<br />From then on, the girl kept asking the boy &quot;Why not?&quot; whenever she saw him, 
<br />and
<br />he kept answering the same answer of &quot;I'll tell you later.&quot; Finally the 
<br />girl got fed up.
<br />Girl: I'm tired of this! Tell me why you don't like me!
<br />Boy: Do you really wanna know why?
<br />Girl: Yes!
<br />Boy: It's because you're uglier than fuck! What's the point of going out 
<br />with someone when they're not pretty?!
<br />Girl: But... I...
<br />Boy: Just shut up and leave me alone!
<br />The boy leaves and the girl is sitting there alone, crying her heart out. 
<br />Then her cell phone rings.
<br />Girl: Hello?
<br />Mom: Sweetheart? I want you to go home, ok? I'll be home from work in a few 
<br />hours.
<br />Girl: Alright Mom.
<br />Mom: I love you.
<br />Girl: I love you too, Mom.
<br />Mom: Bye Bye.
<br />Girl: Bye
<br />The girl heads home and once she got there, she went in the bathroom and 
<br />looked at herself in the mirror.
<br />Girl: I'm not pretty enough...
<br />She set to work, knowing fully well what she was going to do. 2 hours 
<br />later, her Mom came home and heard the bath water running. She went 
<br />Upstairs to find the hallway flooded, so she knocked on the door.
<br />Mom: Honey? Are you alright?
<br />She opened the door and was shocked at the sight. The bath was overflowing 
<br />onto the floor, and the water was tinted red. She walked over to see what 
<br />was inside
<br />and screamed. There, her little girl was lying with cuts all over her face 
<br />and wrists. Her Mom backed away and was going to run to call the police 
<br />when something caught her eye. On the mirror were these words written in 
<br />blood:
<br />&quot;Am I pretty enough now?&quot;
<br />No one deserves to be told that by someone they love. If you find it messed 
<br />Up then forward this to everyone you know.
<br />A person's appearance doesn't count. What counts is their heart inside of 
<br />them and their personality. No one wants to be told they're not good 
<br />enough...

<br />You told me not to drink, Mom so I had a sprite instead.
<br />I felt proud of myself, the way you said I would,
<br />that I didn't drink and drive, though some friends said I should. 
<br />I made a healthy choice, and your advice to me was right
<br />as the party finally ended, and the kids drove out of sight.
<br />I got into my car, sure to get home in one piece,
<br />I never knew what was coming, Mum something I expected least. 
<br />Now I'm lying on the pavement, and I hear the policeman say,
<br />The kid that caused this wreck was drunk, Mum,
<br />His voice seems far away. 
<br />My own blood's all around me, as I try hard not to cry.
<br />I can hear the paramedic say, this girl is going to die.
<br />I'm sure the guy had no idea, while he was flying high,
<br />because he chose to drink and drive, now I would have to die.
<br />So why do people do it, Mum knowing that it ruins lives?
<br />And now the pain is cutting me, like a hundred stabbing knives. 
<br />Tell sister not to be afraid, Mum tell daddy to be brave,
<br />and when I go to heaven, put &quot;Daddy's Girl&quot; on my grave.
<br />Someone should have taught him, that its wrong to drink and drive.
<br />Maybe if his parents had, I'd still be alive. 
<br />My breath is getting shorter, Mum I'm getting
<br />really scared.
<br />These are my final moments, and I'm so unprepared.
<br />I wish that you could hold me Mum, as I lie here and die.
<br />I wish that I could say I love you, Mum
<br />So I love you and good-bye.

<br />I get off the bus, I walk to the door
<br />Just hoping you won’t be fighting once more,
<br />I don’t know why I wish, there’s no point in trying,
<br />But I guess its because someday you might relies that it hurts me when you fight and its not just about you and dad.
<br />Every night I go to my room and I cry, I pray, I pray that one day we can all be a happy family like we used to be.
<br />You start fighting again and I run to my room,
<br />I open my draw and get out a blade,
<br />I put it on my wrist and I stop and think,
<br />This isn’t going to solve anything it will just make it worse.
<br />I put the blade back in the draw and instead I write down all my problems and wish once more.
<br />by me...
