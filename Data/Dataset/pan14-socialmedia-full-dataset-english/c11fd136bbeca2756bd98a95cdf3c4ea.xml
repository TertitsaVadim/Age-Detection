Serving this unfortunately large and growing segment of the population are law firms that are sometimes called “bankruptcy mills,” which work at lower fees with scores of clients simultaneously. But like pouring salt in a wound, their lower fees and production line approach to bankruptcy filings often lead to shoddy work that often qualifies as legal malpractice.
<br /><br />Sadly, many clients of these bankruptcy mills file for bankruptcy in an attempt to save their homes from foreclosure. But attorney negligence – failing to meet filing deadlines, for example – more than constitutes a breach of fiduciary duty on the part of the lawyer. It can mean a family becomes both bankrupt <em>and</em> homeless.
<br /><br /><strong>When to contact a legal malpractice attorney</strong>
<br /><br />For the individual or family who has fallen prey to such lawyer negligence, there may be a way to recoup damages that resulted from the errors of your bankruptcy attorney. As in healthcare when a physician makes an error, you can also sue an attorney for their mistakes.
<br /><br />“Legal malpractice” occurs when lawyers fail to meet an accepted standard of care. This means that they should practice law at a basic level expected of all attorneys. The errors committed by bankruptcy mills often fail to meet these minimum standards. If you hire a <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5kYXZpZGRyZXhsZXJsYXcuY29tL2xlZ2FsLW1hbHByYWN0aWNlLWF0dG9ybmV5LWxvcy1hbmdlbGVzLmh0bWw_" target="_blank">legal malpractice attorney</a>, he or she will ask to also see the following:
<br /><br />•<strong>Specific details of what was done incorrectly.</strong> Simply losing in court does not constitute legal malpractice – losing due to a lawyer’s mistakes does.
<br />•<strong>A direct connection between the attorney’s error and the damages suffered.</strong>
<br />•<strong>The monetary value of damages you suffered as a result of attorney error.</strong> In the case of a home foreclosure, that could include your equity in the home and perhaps attorneys’ fees.
<br /><br />Your legal malpractice attorney will determine if the case is worth pursuing. With these key points of information, your attorney will determine if the at-fault firm has the wherewithal (insurance or assets) to cover damages, should your malpractice case prevail. Most firms work on a contingency basis, meaning their fees are earned only when the client wins a settlement.

How so? Layers of state and federal laws cover situations where injury, death and property damage occur as a result of the boating mishap. Add to that the uncertain nature of water traffic, particularly how human recall, often erroneous, can often be the only means for reconstructing how a boat accident occurred. 
<br /><br />Legal intervention by a <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5kYXZpZGRyZXhsZXJsYXcuY29tLw__" target="_blank">personal injury attorney</a> (also called a “boat accident attorney) into the situation is essential for achieving your best outcomes. A boat accident attorney can make strategic decisions early in the aftermath that can have a profound impact on the outcome.
<br /><br />To start, proper documentation of a boating accident is essential. When a passenger is lost overboard and never recovered, or the boat itself capsizes and sinks, multiple questions regarding cause go unanswered. This is why California law requires a written report when a boating accident involves the following:
<br /><br />• Injuries beyond first aid (e.g., a trip to the emergency room)
<br />• When a passenger dies or disappears
<br />• When property damage/loss is greater than $500
<br /><br />Timing of the report, submitted to the Department of Boating and Waterways, is critical as well:
<br /><br />• Property damage reports ($500+ in damages) must be made within 10 days 
<br />• Disappearances of passengers must be made within 48 hours
<br />• Death of one or more individuals must be made within 24 hours
<br /><br />Failure to make these reports could incur fines up to $1000 or imprisonment up to six months. Of course, an accident report is admissible for proceedings in criminal and civil cases in court. Part of the challenge with boat accidents is to capture and preserve physical evidence; that is why early involvement of expert legal counsel can bolster your chances for a successful legal outcome.
<br /><br /><strong>Who is responsible in boat accidents?</strong>
<br /><br />The maintenance and operation of a boat or personal watercraft (e.g., Kawasaki Jet Ski, Sea-Doo, Yamaha WaveRunners, etc.) are the responsibility of owners and operators. Unfortunately, more than a third of boating accident fatalities in the California are tied to alcohol consumption. Any form of recklessness or negligence on the part of either owner or operator that is found to be the cause of injury or damage provides grounds for legal action.
<br /><br />A manufacturer can also be held responsible for boating accidents when the boat, personal watercraft, life jackets, fire extinguishers or other equipment fails.
<br /><br />As the majority of boating accidents are preventable, it is important to pursue damages in these cases to the fullest extent by hiring an experienced personal injury attorney who knows and understands the law that governs boating accidents.

If you believe your attorney has committed malpractice, speak to a <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5kYXZpZGRyZXhsZXJsYXcuY29tL2xlZ2FsLW1hbHByYWN0aWNlLWF0dG9ybmV5LWxvcy1hbmdlbGVzLmh0bWw_" target="_blank">legal malpractice attorney</a> before agreeing to a settlement.
<br /><br />Quite often, a client will follow the advice of a lawyer to the letter. But lawyers sometimes make mistakes, acting out of negligence or conflicting self-interest. In such cases as with divorce or personal injury, that can lead to unsatisfactory results that can cost a client hundreds of thousands of dollars.  When that happens, it could be deemed legal malpractice.
<br /><br />Attorney negligence can happen in many such cases for a variety of reasons:
<br /><br />• <strong>Impatience</strong>. When a <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5kYXZpZGRyZXhsZXJsYXcuY29tLw__" target="_blank">personal injury attorney</a> is paid on a contingency basis, as it happens in personal injury cases, he or she may not wish to prolong the lawsuit and might bias his advice toward settling. This can also be attractive to the plaintiff from a timing standpoint. But if that settlement leaves a physically injured party with an inadequate amount of money for long-term healthcare, it would have been prudent for the attorney to have advised the client of that risk.  To not have advised the client may have been a breach of the attorney’s fiduciary duty.
<br />• <strong>Fatigue</strong>. It is legal malpractice if an attorney simply decides he or she is tired of the case, or the client or the process, such that they press for an inadequate settlement. This might happen before enough is known about the defendant’s available assets, as it happens in some divorce cases. And it is a tool of insurance companies and their clients to wear down a plaintiff with delays, then offer insubstantial settlements.
<br />• <strong>Error</strong>. It is possible the attorney or an expert witness hired by the attorney could make a mathematical mistake, such as undervaluing shared marital assets in a divorce settlement, or the projected future cost of living in a debilitating personal injury or medical malpractice case.
<br /><br />If you believe that any of these factors are present – particularly if your lawyer is putting pressure on you to settle while you feel that the settlement being offered is insubstantial – do not agree to a settlement and do not sign any settlement documents.
<br /><br /><strong>When to contact a legal malpractice attorney</strong>
<br /><br />A poor settlement decision is almost always irreversible. If you believe that your lawyer is putting undue pressure on you to settle a case prematurely, you have very right to refuse to sign settlement documents. The law states that a client may not sue for legal malpractice after agreeing to a settlement. If you sign a settlement document, it can preclude you from suing later for legal malpractice.
<br /><br />If you believe that your attorney is forcing you to settle a case against your interests, consult with a legal malpractice attorney – before you agree to the settlement in question.
<br /><br />Asking a second attorney to independently examine the case and offered settlement is similar to getting a second medical opinion. It’s ethical, it’s fair – and it helps you achieve your best possible outcome.

		<document id="f7d3ae6c95f265cbdd6c1b2591fe6ac2" url=""><![CDATA[Understanding Age Discrimination<br/><br/>In our youth-oriented culture, personal injury attorney who specializes in age discrimination may be your best ally at staying employed, receiving fair compensation, achieving an appropriate severance package or successful settlement in a lawsuit if you feel like you have been fired from your job solely because of your age.
<br /><br />This is because the law is on your side, even when an employer may not be. If your company is making less-than-subtle efforts to “push you out” – for example, creating a paper trail that suggests poor performance, with often-groundless or very subjective evaluations – you may need to hire a <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5kYXZpZGRyZXhsZXJsYXcuY29tLw__" target="_blank">personal injury attorney</a> to counter those charges and put you in a position of greater strength and control.
<br /><br />Such attorneys are well versed in the nuance and process of employment age discrimination. It is commonplace for companies to demote, terminate, transfer or suspend an employee simply because he or she is older (and often more expensive in healthcare and pension plan benefits). Consider the following to see if your case qualifies for age discrimination litigation:
<br /><br />• When younger co-workers or supervisors use language that highlight your age in a negative context (“grampa,” “our antique,” or suggesting technical deficiencies as a function of “your generation,” etc.).
<br />• When baseless or subjective negative performance reviews are written because the employer is attempting to build a case for termination.
<br />• When inferences are made that you are not keeping up with changes in technology or company methods.
<br />• When the company has a track record of terminating individuals who are older than 40.
<br />• When you are replaced by a younger employee.
<br /><br />If several of these situations describe your situation, it may be time to contact a personal injury attorney.
<br /><br /><strong>What is Employment Age Discrimination?</strong>
<br /><br />According to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, age discrimination claims increased 28 percent in 2008, a rate almost double those of race, gender and other discrimination claims. Particularly in a down economy, layoffs affect older workers more – at an age where finding a new job is much harder. Perceptions that older workers are less productive than younger ones are disproved by productivity studies. However, the erosion in recent years of corporate policies that favored tenure means that lower level supervisors now have discretion on how they hire, fire and manage employees. According to Peter Cappelli, the director of the Center for Human Resources at the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania, “With that discretion, prejudice that may have always been there can be made manifest.” 
<br /><br />The federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) prohibits employment bias against people over 40 years of age on several points:
<br /><br />• Discrimination should not occur in any part of the employment cycle: recruitment, application, interviews, hiring, compensation (wages and benefits), assignments, discipline, promotion and termination.
<br />• Age limitations can be cited only if it is a bona fide, necessary occupational qualification.
<br />• A reduction in force (downsizing, mass layoffs) should not show a pattern and disproportionate targeting of older workers.
<br />• Early retirements should not be forced.
<br />• Discrimination against an employee who files or testifies against the company in an age discrimination claim should not occur.
<br />• The employee can waive ADEA rights with a severance agreement, however no employee facing termination should be forced to accept a severance package without ample time to review it or counsel from an attorney.
<br /><br />Proving an employee discrimination case boils down to showing that intentional action was taken against an employee purely on the basis of age. Gathering evidence to support that case – and sharing it with your personal injury attorney in an expeditious manner – is essential.

Known legally as “sex discrimination”, it is defined as treatment of a person that would not have occurred except for that person’s gender. Largely known for helping equalize pay in the workplace for women, men can also be targets of sex discrimination. 
<br /><br />California’s Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA) prohibits gender discrimination in the workplace, by private or public employers, employment agencies, labor unions, state licensing boards and both local and state governments. The law also prohibits retaliation by an employer or coworker in response to a gender discrimination claim.
<br /><br />Nobody should face this kind of discrimination or harassment. A <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5kYXZpZGRyZXhsZXJsYXcuY29tLw__" target="_blank">personal injury attorney</a> who specializes in discrimination cases can help protect your rights.
<br /><br /><strong>What is gender discrimination?</strong>
<br /><br />Discrimination on the basis of gender can take many forms:
<br /><br />• Workplaces: Hiring, firing, promotion, job classification, benefits and pay may be unequally applied to men or women.
<br /><br />• Harassment: When a person in a supervisory or peer position makes unwanted sexual advances at work, or when such behaviors by other employees, vendors or customers are tolerated.
<br /><br />• Public access: When a person is denied access to a public accommodation, such as when a male victim of domestic abuse is excluded from a publicly funded family shelter that is established for abused women.
<br /><br />If gender discrimination is affecting your ability to work or your access to public accommodations or housing, you should contact a personal injury attorney right away. They can file complaints with the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and California’s Department of Fair Employment and Housing, which are prerequisite to bringing a lawsuit against an employer.

<br /><br />If a medical professional, such as a physician or nurse or EMT harms or exacerbates the medical condition of a victim, they can be sued by a <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5kYXZpZGRyZXhsZXJsYXcuY29tL21lZGljYWwtbWFscHJhY3RpY2UtYXR0b3JuZXktbG9zLWFuZ2VsZXMuaHRtbA__" target="_blank">medical malpractice attorney</a> in behalf of the victim and held liable for any injuries caused as well as pain and suffering.
<br /><br />These so called “Good Samaritan Laws” are named for a biblical story in which a traveler from the area of Samaria renders aid to a stranger who he has found robbed, beaten, and left to die on the road.
<br /><br />In the State of California, the original Good Samaritan law was created in 1980.  At this time, Health and Safety Code 1799.102 was enacted.  It stated that, “no person who in good faith and not for compensation, renders emergency care at the scene of an emergency shall be liable for any civil damages resulting from any act or omission. The scene of an emergency shall not include emergency departments and other places where medical care is usually offered.”
<br /><br />In 2004 a case came to light which was pivotal in amending California’s Good Samaritan Law, and forever changed the way Good Samaritan Laws were viewed in general.  The case was named Van Horne vs Torti and involved two former friends who were involved in an auto accident.  Torti pulled Van Horne from a crashed vehicle and was subsequently sued when Van Hone suffered paraplegia from allegedly being yanked out of the car by Torti in a harsh manner.  Torti attempted to use the Good Samaritan Statute as her defense, but both an appellate and Supreme Court ruled in favor of the plaintiff and held Torti responsible for Van Horns injuries.  Their decision was based upon the fact that they did not consider Van Horn being pulled from the car to be emergency medical care.
<br /><br />The State Legislature was immediately concerned that this historic decision would cause individuals to fear helping others in need and less than one week after this decision, Assembly Bill 83 was added to the existing Health and Safety Code.  The bill made two important changes:
<br /><br />• Added immunity from civil liability for the provider of medical and non-medical aid during an emergency
<br />• Made an exception to that immunity for any act of gross negligence or willful or wanton misconduct in the course of providing said care, with gross negligence being defined as &quot;an exercise of so slight a degree of care as to justify the belief there was indifference to the interest and welfare of others.&quot; And willful or wanton misconduct defined as &quot;conduct by a person who may have no intent to cause harm, but who intentionally performs an act so unreasonable and dangerous that he or she knows or should know it is highly probable that harm will result.&quot;
<br /><br />If you have questions about how California's Good Samaritan law may apply to your situation, contact a personal injury attorney – known also as a “medical malpractice attorney” – who has experience handling medical malpractice cases.

This is no less true where it comes to same-sex sexual harassment in the workplace. While most matters of how California’s Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA) and federal statutes work are clear, new scenarios and cases are making their way through the judicial system that may establish different rules in coming years.
<br /><br />But it should be clear that all forms of sexual abuse – such as a quid pro quo (“this for that,” the implication of employment favors in exchange for sex), as well as inappropriate actions, words or gestures – are illegal and grounds for litigation. Whether male-on-female, female-on-male or between persons of the same gender, those actions can disrupt careers and workplaces and need to be dealt with appropriately.
<br /><br />There has been an increase in reported cases of same-sex litigation, where sexual harassment attorneys – <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5kYXZpZGRyZXhsZXJsYXcuY29tLw__" target="_blank">personal injury attorneys</a> who specialize in handling sex harassment cases – argue for lost compensation, mental anguish and even punitive damages on behalf of their clients.
<br /><br />The 2011 case of Kelley vs. The Conco Companies (California Fifth District Court of Appeals), however, suggests a legal nuance that may be challenged in the future. In this case, the appeals court ruled a male employee could not claim sexual harassment, regardless of the fact that unwelcome, hostile and sexually graphic comments were made toward him by a male supervisor. The court ruled there was no evidence these comments were made out of “genuine sexual interest” as neither party was known to be homosexual. This suggests that in future cases the sexual orientation of individuals will need to be established, which may be problematic.
<br /><br /><strong>When a sexual harassment attorney needs to establish a solid case</strong>
<br /><br />Still, there are clear instances where male-on-male or female-on-female sex harassment occurs. These include incidents where a supervisor will ask an employee out on a date, then retaliate against that individual if such offers are rebuffed.
<br /><br />Such cases inherently involve “person A said, person B said” situations. A written record of conversations, actions and complaints will strengthen the plaintiff’s lawsuit. For individuals who find themselves in such circumstances, a <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5kYXZpZGRyZXhsZXJsYXcuY29tL3NleHVhbC1oYXJhc3NtZW50LWF0dG9ybmV5LWxvcy1hbmdlbGVzLmh0bWw_" target="_blank">sexual harassment attorney</a> can be vitally important for achieving a favorable outcome.

<br /><br />While these errors are often referred to as “prescription malpractice”, they fall under the laws of medical malpractice, with lawsuits being brought against the perpetrators by personal injury attorneys who specialize in handling prescription malpractice cases.  These personal injury attorneys are referred to many different ways including “medical malpractice attorneys” or even “<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5kYXZpZGRyZXhsZXJsYXcuY29tL3ByZXNjcmlwdGlvbi1tYWxwcmFjdGljZS1hdHRvcm5leS1sb3MtYW5nZWxlcy5odG1s" target="_blank">prescription malpractice attorneys</a>”.
<br /><br />Just some of the injuries resulting from prescription malpractice can include: severe allergic reactions, a worsening course of illness, organ impairment or failure, emotional and mental impairment, and sudden death.  Sadly, many of these tragic outcomes are avoidable when strict written polices and protocols are in place, and staff consistently adheres to those standards.
<br /><br />Healthcare professionals can prevent medication errors and prescription malpractice by following what is known as the “Five Rights” each and every time medication is administered to a patient.  With the five rights, the healthcare professional must check to see if the following five things are right.  Is it…
<br /><br /><strong>The right medication?</strong>
<br /><br />Many medications have very similar sounding and similarly spelled names.  In addition, the print on very small vials of medication may be difficult to read.
<br /><br /><strong>The right patient?</strong>
<br /><br />The patient should be asked to identify their name and date of birth.  The patient’s wristband should be checked as well.
<br /><br /><strong>The right dose?</strong>
<br /><br />An incorrect dosage of certain drugs which is increased by even the smallest amount can be deadly.
<br /><br /><strong>The right time?</strong>
<br /><br />Some medications must be given at exact intervals to be successful in treating an illness. Medications given off schedule could affect the results of diagnostic tests, leading to misdiagnosis and mistreatment.
<br /><br /><strong>The right route?</strong>
<br /><br />The staff member must be sure to give the medication in the proper manner so that it is delivered into the body in the most efficacious way for that particular patient, and their individual health history and illness.
<br /><br />Ideally, all five of these rights should be checked twice by the first staff member, and a third time by another qualified staff member in addition to the person actually administering the medication.
<br /><br />If you have suffered as a victim of a prescription medication error caused by a healthcare provider’s negligence or recklessness, you have the legal right to contact a <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5kYXZpZGRyZXhsZXJsYXcuY29tL21lZGljYWwtbWFscHJhY3RpY2UtYXR0b3JuZXktbG9zLWFuZ2VsZXMuaHRtbA__" target="_blank">medical malpractice attorney</a> in order to file a prescription malpractice claim.

It is believed that insurance companies pay larger settlements to attorneys who they know are capable of successfully winning a case at trial. A <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5kYXZpZGRyZXhsZXJsYXcuY29tLw__" target="_blank">personal injury attorney</a> who lacks experience is often intimidated by insurance company attorneys and may often try to settle for an amount that is less than the case is worth in order to get the case settled.
<br /><br />While achieving a quick settlement is always a desired goal, it is often not in the best interest of the client. It is often necessary to go to trial in order to secure the best results. Remember, having an experienced trial attorney with a proven record of success in your corner means that you can expect the best possible results in and out of the courtroom.
<br /><br />While too many other personal injury attorneys pretend to provide full legal services for their personal injury clients, they are often ill equipped to go to trial if necessary. A fast-talking lawyer, who boasts of past successes, or assures a big dollar win when enticing prospective clients to sign retainer agreements may actually lack the ability or resources to take a case to trial when the insurance company’s offer is unreasonably low and unfair.
<br /><br />A personal injury attorney who lacks trial experience and does not have a proven track record of success in trial will likely try to settle cases with for a lower amount to avoid trial at all costs. The insurance companies and the defense attorneys, who vigorously oppose personal injury claims, know who these lawyers settle cheap are and only authorize minimal settlement offers to those less qualified lawyers and the clients they represent.

<br /><br />Those seeking medical care or advice implicitly trust that their personal information will be kept safe from disclosure to unauthorized parties.  Every patient has a right to feel safe in that trust, and can suffer in several ways if the confidentiality is broken.
<br /><br />Protection of patient confidentiality involves more than one might initially imagine.  For example:
<br /><br />• All contents of the patient’s record should be considered confidential and therefore “protected”.  This includes information the patient has provided (such as health history forms), the providers’ examination notes, telephone messages, notes or letters written to the doctor, labs, prescriptions, and diagnostic tests.
<br />• Doctor-patient confidentiality still applies even if the patient permanently stops going to that particular office or facility, or is no longer considered an active patient.
<br />• Sensitive patient information should be kept safe from persons both within and outside the facility or office.
<br /><br />There are some exceptions to the rule of confidentiality whereby the patient’s permission is not required for release of their records.  In general, the following situations would not give cause to a medical malpractice lawsuit for breach of confidentiality:
<br /><br />• Data regarding certain communicable diseases, bacteria, or viruses must be reported to State Health Officers such as the Center for Communicable Diseases or The World Health Organization
<br />• Cases of child abuse, spousal abuse, or elder abuse
<br />• In order to authorize payment for claims, insurance companies always need at least a diagnosis.  Supporting data such as diagnostic tests, lab results and more may need to be supplied as well
<br />• A <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5kYXZpZGRyZXhsZXJsYXcuY29tL21lZGljYWwtbWFscHJhY3RpY2UtYXR0b3JuZXktbG9zLWFuZ2VsZXMuaHRtbA__" target="_blank">medical malpractice attorney</a> will issue a subpoena for records to the medical professional who is being charged with malpractice.
<br /><br />It is the health-care provider’s duty to create and maintain a trustworthy relationship with the patient.  When that trust is broken, they can and should be held accountable for the serious negative consequences experienced by a patient.  If you have suffered due to the inappropriate disclosure of your medical information, a medical malpractice attorney can advise you of your legal rights and options you may wish to take.

		<document id="cd67d7f6b030b3eddb9077d39ef04a7" url=""><![CDATA[Sexual Orientation, Discrimination and the Law<br/><br/>A personal injury attorney can play a key role in the bringing of claims against an employer who actively or passively discriminates against an employee who is perceived to be gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender (gender identity). The law prohibits this type of discrimination, even though it happens with frequency. Often it is not the official policy of the company, but rather the actions of middle managers and peers that aren’t prevented and reprimanded by the employer.
<br /><br />California law also protects individuals against discrimination in housing, based on perceived sexual identity and gender identity.
<br /><br />To successfully pursue any type of discrimination based on sexual orientation, a gathering of pertinent facts is necessary. All communication and incidents should be recorded and saved along with any other evidence that proves the discrimination. Your own communication with the offending parties is key as well. By engaging a <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5kYXZpZGRyZXhsZXJsYXcuY29tLw__" target="_blank">personal injury attorney</a> who specializes in sexual orientation discrimination cases, you are more likely to have a successful case.
<br /><br /><strong>What is sexual orientation discrimination?</strong>
<br /><br />The California Unruh Civil Rights Act amendment to the Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA) prohibits discrimination in “all business establishments of every kind whatsoever.” Discrimination is defined by the state as being treated differently or harassed because of real or perceived sexual orientation. In other words, it’s possible a heterosexual would receive this same level of discrimination if he or she is perceived to be gay or because of gender identity (transgender).
<br /><br />This type of discrimination in employment can take several forms:
<br /><br />• Assault 
<br />• Battery (involving physical contact)
<br />• Defamation
<br />• Harassment
<br />• Infliction of emotional distress (intentional or negligent)
<br />• Interference with an employment contract 
<br />• Invasion of privacy
<br />• Unequal treatment in recruitment, hiring, job assignments, promotion, compensation and termination
<br />• Wrongful termination
<br /><br />In housing, discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation may include
<br /><br />• Different terms, conditions, or privileges
<br />• Falsely denying availability of a property
<br />• Lenders refusing to provide credit on equal terms
<br /><br />Because the law clearly ensures employment and housing rights to all individuals regardless of their sexual orientation, infractions are grounds for a civil suit. Contact a personal injury attorney as soon as possible to discuss your case.

Cars speed down the freeway over the speed limit.  Trucks weave between cars from lane to lane.  More and more, passengers on buses find themselves completely at the mercy of the bus driver’s driving skills to negotiate this maze of traffic. And sometimes, the bus driver fails his passengers, involving them in a bus accident.
<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5kYXZpZGRyZXhsZXJsYXcuY29tLw__" target="_blank">Personal injury attorneys</a> who specialize in handing these types of vehicle accidents (referred to also as “vehicle accident attorneys”) are only too aware how potentially tragic bus accidents can be, not only because of the size of the vehicle, but because bus passengers are rarely seat-belted into their seats. In a rollover bus accident, passengers can be thrown against one another and the result can be devastating. Every year, 1450 people are killed in bus accidents and many, many more suffer significant injuries.
<br /><br />Statistics say that some 360 million people ride buses every year and travel 28 billion miles per year. That’s a big responsibility for those behind the wheels of these vehicles. Like trains, airlines, subways, or any other type of public transportation, bus companies are held to the highest standard of safety when it comes to operating their buses; higher than you would be, for instance, driving a neighbor’s child to school. This assumes that people put their lives in the hands of a bus company and have every right to expect that as a company responsible for transporting the public, everything has been done to protect their safety and their lives. Unfortunately, this isn’t always the case. Drivers make careless mistakes, or fall asleep at the wheel, brakes fail, or tires blow.  Driver error is, by far, the most common cause for a great majority of bus accidents on American roads.
<br /><br />What kinds of buses are involvedt in these accident statistics? Public buses account for a large portion of riders, but the school buses that drive our children account for another huge percentage of ridership. Naturally, we assume when we put our children on the school bus in the morning that all care has been taken to protect them. We assume that the driver’s history has been thoroughly checked.  But time and again, drivers with spotty or downright awful driving records end up driving our children to school. Shockingly, every year, 11 school age children are killed in bus accidents and 12,000 are injured.  With no seatbelts on school buses, small children risk grave injury in accidents of this kind.
<br /><br />Janice Freemont put her daughter, Sarah, on a school bus in Los Angeles one February morning and kissed her goodbye.  If she had known what the driver had done the night before, she never would have let her child near that bus.  Thirty minutes later, that school bus plowed into a car in an intersection and overturned. Sarah was seriously injured and others were killed.  Investigators found that the bus driver had illegal levels of alcohol still in her system at the time of the accident.  Janice hired a <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5kYXZpZGRyZXhsZXJsYXcuY29tL3ZlaGljbGUtYWNjaWRlbnQtYXR0b3JuZXktbG9zLWFuZ2VsZXMuaHRtbA__" target="_blank">vehicle accident attorney</a> and sued the bus company for negligence in hiring a woman with a history of drinking they claimed to have missed.  Sarah Freemont’s attorney won a large settlement against the bus company, covering Sarah’s many medical expenses and compensating her for emotional trauma.
<br /><br />We often hear of terrible rollover accidents involving private tour buses and fifteen-passenger vans, often hired by church groups. These bus and van lines seem particularly vulnerable to driver error involving drivers falling asleep at the wheel and vans tumbling down embankments.  The high centers of gravity on these vehicles are particularly dangerous in accidents. Rollovers are frighteningly common in bus accidents. The injuries as a result of such terrifying accidents can be numerous and long lasting. An experienced personal injury attorney can sort out your rights if you have been injured in an accident like this and get you fair compensation for your pain and suffering.
<br /><br />A vehicle accident involving a bus in California during October of 2008 killed ten people who were ejected or crushed when a bus careened off the road and flipped several times. The driver was found to be not properly permitted as a tour coach bus driver, had previously lost his license for two years for speeding violations and had battled drug and alcohol problems for years.  As hard as it is to believe that a company could hire a driver with this sort of record, this situation stresses the importance of doing your homework before you get aboard a private bus of any sort. Check the safety record of that bus company before putting your life in the hands of one of its drivers.
<br /><br />Shuttle buses at airports and hotels are also the culprits of serious accidents.  Part of the problem here is the size and shape of shuttle buses. They are awkwardly built things with large blind spots and a high center of gravity. They also tend not to have any sort of seat belt for safety. Not only are passengers flying around in a shuttle during an accident, but heavy luggage is as well. Though there is little you can do to protect yourself from accidents like these, there is something you can do should you find yourself injured by one. Contact an experienced vehicle accident attorney who can recover for you the damages to which you are entitled.

It all begins on the playground when you’re five. Some bully tells a lie about you, and suddenly the whole neighborhood stops playing with you.  That is an oversimplification of what has come to be known as “defamation of character” in the legal arena, but it certainly represents the helplessness that victims of defamation feel when something untrue has been said about them, which has a direct, negative impact upon their lives.
<br /><br />Defamation of character, or simply “defamation” is a considered a character injury.  It can be difficult to prove because it doesn’t necessarily result in a physical injury that can be photographed or otherwise physically documented. Defamation affects the reputation of the victim in a damaging way, or the livelihood of the victim in direct response to having his or her reputation denigrated. Moreover, the successful case for defamation of character is predicated on the assertion that the victim, is in fact, not guilty of the libel (a written form of defamation) or slander (a verbal form of defamation) that he has been accused of.
<br /><br />A complaint of defamation of character is covered under personal injury law and is filed in court by a <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5kYXZpZGRyZXhsZXJsYXcuY29tLw__" target="_blank">personal injury attorney</a>.
<br /><br />For instance, if a man named Bill keeps twenty apartment buildings in clear slum-like conditions and a tenant named Joseph writes to the local newspaper and calls Bill a “slum lord”, then that does not constitute defamation. That is the truth. So Bill, the slumlord, cannot win a defamation of character lawsuit against Joseph for saying something that is essentially indisputably true.   Bill is a slumlord because of the manner in which he conducts his business, and Joseph simply pointed it out. Even if ‘outing’ Bill in the newspaper directly affects his otherwise good reputation, he has no defamation case against Joseph. So it’s not defamation, if the accusation is known to be true, even though Joseph’s intent was to ‘out’ Bill as a slumlord to ruin his otherwise good reputation.
<br /><br />In a recent case in Los Angeles, however, the opposite is also true.  Lyle McGrazer, 69, had a bone to pick with Olivia Warenthal, owner of a successful neighborhood restaurant. Warenthal enjoyed the good will of the entire neighborhood and her café was thought of as a community gathering spot where people had been going for years.  In spite of that, McGrazer loudly accused Warenthal’s head cook of having hepatitis and infecting the patrons.  This essentially cleared her restaurant that night and for many weeks afterward as fear spread about what McGrazer had said. The truth was, the head cook did not have hepatitis and there was no basis for this slanderous lie.  It damaged her business for months until the malicious lie could be cleared up. Olivia Warenthal located a personal injury attorney and sued Lyle McGrazer for defamation and was able to prove character injury because Lyle had made the story up with no basis in truth and his lie had directly resulted in a demonstrable financial injury to her business and undermined her reputation.
<br /><br />Like Warenthal’s case, defamation cases rarely make it to the courtroom. Mostly, attorneys will settle these cases before the defamation case goes to trial.  Settlements are reached with parties or insurance companies. Rarely is a case of defamation of character heard before a judge or jury, though high profile cases sometimes are. We’ve all heard about the cases of character injury brought by celebrities against magazines that routinely straddle the edge between truth and fiction.  A well known actor with Cancer had to sue a well-known gossip magazine when they repeatedly reported he was ‘near death,’ or ‘on his deathbed’ when, all the while, he was working and fighting the disease.  In this case, the actor won his defamation case against the paper, because they were, in fact, damaging his potential to earn a living by claiming he was near death. The actor had to prove also, that the statements were made with “actual malice”, which meant that the newspaper knew their claims to be patently false.
<br /><br />If you have been the victim of defamation and are considering bringing a lawsuit against someone for defamation of your character, hire an experienced personal injury attorney who specializes in defamation cases.  An experienced attorney can help you sort through the facts to see if you have a case.

For most pet owners, this scenario will never happen. However the frequency of such dog bite attacks is on the rise. Dog bites represent some of the most brutal types of personal injury that innocent victims can suffer, causing deep, jagged wounds, scarring, blindness and even death. When the unthinkable happens, hiring an experienced <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5kYXZpZGRyZXhsZXJsYXcuY29tL2RvZy1iaXRlLWF0dG9ybmV5LWxvcy1hbmdlbGVzLmh0bWw_" target="_blank">dog bite attorney</a> becomes a necessity.  The sad fact is, almost all dog bites are preventable.
<br /><br />Unfortunately, when dog bites occur, it is often through no fault of the victim.  Ken Carlson was walking in his Los Angeles neighborhood one late October afternoon when a pair of Rottweilers, who’d gotten loose from their back yard, attacked him in the street. He was helpless to stop them. Only the help of nearby neighbors saved his life. But Ken was left with the aftermath of the attack: the scars, the emotional anguish and a newfound terror of dogs.  Personal injury attorneys who specialize in dog bites argue that these kinds of symptoms are similar to post-traumatic stress, for the suffering that follows such traumatic incidents is much more than physical.
<br /><br />Unbelievably, 2% of all Americans will suffer dog bites this year. So just what is causing this aggression in dogs?  For one thing, more aggressive breeds of dogs such as Rottweiler, Pit Bull, German Shepherd, Chow and Akita are common.  Many people buy these breeds for their aggressiveness as protection. But that aggression goes both ways. Go to any animal shelter. The cages are full of dogs given up by owners who had, for years, left them chained to trees – a sure fire way to turn a dog mean. In fact, dogs made aggressive by the inhumane technique of chaining perpetrated 26% - 28% of all dog bites. The truth is, dog owners are almost completely responsible for determining whether or not a dog will ever attack.  A dog that is well treated, supervised, exercised regularly and loved is rarely responsible for the dog bite attacks.
<br /><br />Dog bites: What are the risk factors?
<br /><br />• Some breeds are naturally more aggressive than others. Chows and Akitas, Pit Bulls and Rottweilers all fall into this category. While the deciding factor with all of these breeds is often solely a function of how they are raised and treated, dog bite attorneys in Los Angeles agree that these breeds are of particular concern. 
<br />• Male dogs are much more likely to bite than female dogs.
<br />• Puppy mill dogs – are genetically predisposed to aggression, due to in breeding and the inhumane conditions under which they are raised.
<br />• Chaining dogs – This technique is actually outlawed in many states.  It’s cruel and punishing. Dog bite lawyers pursuing litigation in such cases find that dogs that are chained are also generally neglected and in poor health. Both of these factors contribute to attacks and aggression.
<br />• Poor socialization – dogs that are never socialized are more likely to attack as a pure defense mechanism.
<br />• The pack mentality – dogs in two’s, three’s or even four’s without supervision tend to be much more dangerous that single dogs. Packs of two or more roaming loose on the streets can be a deadly menace.
<br />• Sick or injured dogs – Clearly this is a factor for any animal, wild or domestic. Animal control is the best way to deal with a sick or injured, loose dog. But owners must take responsibility for the health of their dogs with regular visits to the vet.
<br /><br />Children are often the smallest victims of dog bites, which are now responsible for more emergency room visits for children under ten than from any other activities.  Most often, a frightening 61% of the time, these attacks happen at home or at the home of a friend, where the dogs are trusted.  But small children can appear to be prey to vicious dogs. While owners may claim provocation occurred, a good personal injury lawyer knows that in most cases, children innocently approach dogs, but aggressive dogs can perceive that as a threat.
<br /><br /><strong>My neighbor’s dog bit my child. I can’t sue my friend, can I?</strong>
<br /><br />First thing to do is contact a dog bite attorney.  A dog bite attorney can help you sort out the emotional and physical issues and steer you toward the financial help you may need to treat the aftermath of a dog attack.  Many dog bites are completely covered under the dog owner’s homeowner’s insurance policy.  Even if you can’t afford medical treatment, an experienced attorney can get you assistance on your medical bills, pending litigation, and help you to understand the ins and outs of the law.

With the baby boom generation aging and the general population living longer, the elderly have become a large and vulnerable population. All too often we hear stories of neglect in nursing homes, abandoned elderly dying in their homes, or worse, on the street, and stories of physical abuse by a family member. The elderly are notoriously vulnerable to financial ruin by scam-running acquaintances.  
<br /><br />Elder abuse is an actionable offense. If an elder that you care about is abused in any way by a certified or professional caregiver, seek out a <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5kYXZpZGRyZXhsZXJsYXcuY29tL21lZGljYWwtbWFscHJhY3RpY2UtYXR0b3JuZXktbG9zLWFuZ2VsZXMuaHRtbA__" target="_blank">medical malpractice attorney</a> to assist you in navigating the road to prosecution and justice.  This type of abuse falls under the area of practice of personal injury law, even though criminal charges could be filed and arrests made.
<br /><br />If you’ve ever cared for an elderly relative, it’s easy to see why they are so vulnerable. Dementia can often make an older person incapable of self-defense, or even incapable of recognizing abuse. Fear of authority and retribution can keep nursing home residents from reporting abuse. Lonely elderly people tend to put their trust in caregivers even as they are being victimized. Experts believe that 4%-6% of the elder population, a whopping 2.1 million, is suffering some kind of abuse. 
<br /><br />Surprisingly, most elder abuse happens at home, not in institutions like nursing homes.  Here, it becomes a complex issue of familial relations and a growing frailty of the elder.  What an elder might once have tolerated for a lifetime, now poses an imminent danger to him or her.  
<br /><br />Elder abuse generally falls under three headings: 
<br /><br />• Emotional abuse
<br />• Physical abuse (including sexual abuse and neglect)
<br />• Financial abuse
<br /><br />Emotional abuse of an elder is, perhaps, the most insidious. It leaves no physical marks but can be just as devastating.  Emotional abuse by care providers, frustrated by an elderly patient’s inability to fend for himself, can sometimes result in verbal abuse that cows an older person with fear. Because they are completely dependent on a caregiver, the elderly patient will typically not fight back, but will simply accept the abuse. Emotional abuse can have devastating health effects on the elderly just as it might on a small child. That’s why experts advise to first protect elders from unscrupulous abusers by interceding on their behalf. Then, report abuse to the proper authorities. Then contact a personal injury attorney to learn more about how to proceed.
<br /><br />Physical abuse of the elderly tends to be more visible. Physical abuse can range from slapping, shoving and hitting to shocking cases of restraint, using chains or ropes.  Neglect also falls under this heading.  Neglect happens when a caregiver fails to provide for the senior’s basic needs, such as water, food, medical assistance, shelter, personal hygiene, and/ or keeping the senior comfortable with air conditioning or heating. Excessively medicating seniors or allowing them to remain in bed on one position can cause life-threatening bedsores.  
<br />What are some of the danger signs that an elderly person may be experiencing physical abuse?
<br /><br />• sudden, unexplained weight loss,
<br />• the senior’s personal hygiene has obviously gotten worse,
<br />• indications of dehydration, bedsores, and/or malnutrition are present, 
<br />• a care giver isolates elder who is unable to freely spend time with others or is afraid of care giver,
<br />• bruises around wrists or arms,
<br />• refusal to visit an emergency room for repeated injuries.
<br /><br />If you see any of these signs in a loved one, take steps immediately to protect that senior. Investigate the problems and report abuse to authorities. An experienced medical malpractice attorney can assist you in navigating the legal ramifications of this kind of abuse.
<br /><br />Financial abuse is the third component to elder abuse.  For example, in Los Angeles, a young stockbroker befriended a newly widowed elderly woman who had no children.  He talked her into making him the trustee of her estate. Over the next few years, he encouraged her to transfer nearly all of her assets to him, leaving her virtually penniless.  Her nephew in another state suspected something illegal was going on and contacted a <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5kYXZpZGRyZXhsZXJsYXcuY29tLw__" target="_blank">personal injury attorney</a> and the police. After a forensic accounting of her estate, they discovered the fraud and recovered the millions the stockbroker stole and brought charges against the man.
<br /><br />These sorts of scenarios go on all the time. Why? Because the elderly are vulnerable, easy targets. They are unsure who to trust or what advice to take.  Young, friendly professional-seeming scam artists can easily seduce an elderly victim into turning over his or her entire life savings, then vanish, leaving the senior destitute.
<br /><br />So what will really happen if you merely contact authorities? Even when the state prosecutes caregivers or nursing homes, the fines imposed and the settlements reached are small. And the tragedy is, nothing changes.  Bad nursing homes have little to fear from these state-imposed fines. They make huge profits.  The state will also not help you recover the money you or the elder lost to scam artists. The only way to stop this kind of elder abuse is to contact an experienced medical malpractice attorney who knows your rights and will fight for them.  This is the only way to affect real change, to collect damages suffered and to make sure this never happens to another hapless senior.

Every year, thousands are seriously injured or killed in construction accidents on construction sites.  And while many precautions have been put into place to protect workers, construction accidents continue to be the number one cause of job-related deaths in America.
<br /><br />An astounding 1 out of every 10 workers will get injured this year.  This is when you need to consult with an experienced <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5kYXZpZGRyZXhsZXJsYXcuY29tL2NvbnN0cnVjdGlvbi1hY2NpZGVudC1hdHRvcm5leS1sb3MtYW5nZWxlcy5odG1s" target="_blank">construction accident attorney</a>.  Hastily constructed scaffolding, improperly braced cranes and falls from high places contribute greatly to this high accident rate.  Economic pressure to get buildings up faster and faster is only making matters worse. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) estimates that there will be 1000 work-related deaths nationwide this year in the construction industry. In fact, this trend is so alarming that after ten workers died in seventeen months in Las Vegas construction accidents, Congress is reviewing not only whether OSHA’s policies are adequate, but if those policies are being followed.
<br /><br />Construction accident attorneys (personal injury attorneys who focus their practice on construction accidents) are seeing more and more devastating cases emerge from on-site accidents. Burns, amputations, spinal injuries, asphyxiation due to faulty ventilation, falls, blindness and head injuries are only a few of the catastrophic accidents that can put victims out of work, sometimes permanently.  Others face a lifetime regimen of medication and/or weeks or months of rehabilitation. During that time, their families are often without income.
<br /><br />It is the responsibility of the construction site’s General Contractor and his subcontractors to assure the safety of their workers, maintaining a workplace as free of potential hazards as possible and to supervise on-site work situations.  This, unfortunately, isn’t always the case.  Negligent General Contractors or contractors who’ve abdicated supervision to negligent sub-contractors often cause construction accidents.  Ben Howland, a drywall hanger in Los Angeles, was walking across his job site when a bobcat carrying an unbalanced load of drywall broke, and dropped the load on him.  He was left paralyzed, unemployable and devastated.  His <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5kYXZpZGRyZXhsZXJsYXcuY29tLw__" target="_blank">personal injury attorney</a> proved that negligent supervision by the subcontractor and a badly maintained forklift was to blame for the accident. Ben collected $2.5 million.
<br /><br />Third party negligence plays a growing part in on-site construction accidents.  Even with the best supervision, faulty third-party equipment, such as damaged scaffolding, heavy equipment not adequately maintained, or faulty power tools may cause an unforeseen accident. Negligent, third parties may also, according to law, assume partial responsibility. An expert construction accident attorney can untangle the liability of third party negligence for you if you have suffered such an accident. 	
<br /><br />Not only construction workers fall under this shadow of injury. Visitors to a job site or innocent passers-by who suffer injury or death fall under this same rule of law.  A perfect example of this happened recently in New York City when a crane toppled off the roof of a building under construction and nearly demolished a building across the street, killing several people and injuring others. These victims had nothing whatsoever to do with the construction site, but were victims of the negligence of the general contractor, product safety issues and other third party negligence still to be decided in court. 
<br /><br />Worker’s Compensation may cover a certain percentage of the expenses incurred by a construction accident, but alone will be woefully insufficient to cover all the costs of a long-term or catastrophic injury such as paralysis, blindness, traumatic brain injury or death. Those types of injuries will often put the victim or the victim’s family into serious financial trouble if not compensated fairly. In such cases, third party negligence will often play a part in the settlement an expert construction attorney can achieve for their client, even if suing the General Contractor is not possible. It is very important to contact an attorney as soon as possible so that evidence of third party negligence can be preserved and investigated. 
<br /><br />In California, the joint and several liability rules apply to every person who bears responsibility for a worker’s injury and a good construction accident attorney is skilled at applying this rule of law to the entire injury, including lost wages, medical bills and pain and suffering. 
<br /><br />Several years ago, California passed a law to make it easier for workers who have been injured to collect their Worker’s Compensation without the hassle of going to court to collect it. But at the same time, big corporations use high paid lawyers to keep you, the victim, from receiving all the Worker’s Comp benefits you’re entitled to. Why? It is because their bottom line does not take the reality of your bottom line into consideration. It is their job to help the insurance companies save money.
<br /><br />What recourse can a worker take when he or she has been injured on the job? First, find an experienced personal injury attorney.  Such lawyers are familiar with California’s Workers Compensation law and can help the client navigate that difficult arena.  If you or someone you love has been injured, you have enough to worry about right now without figuring out how to navigate the legal system. Let the experts help you.

Why? Because at its core, premises liability is all about figuring out who is to blame for an accident. By definition, the term “premises liability” is the body of law that fixes responsibility for injuries suffered by a third party victim on the person who is in possession of a premises or piece of land. In other words, the person who occupies the land and has intent to control it also has the responsibility to make sure it is safe and free of obvious hazards.
<br /><br />Some of the most common accidents under the premises liability heading are so called “slip and fall” accidents. These kinds of accidents often happen when we least expect them. We’re walking through a grocery store and slip on a wet floor, or trip over a loose stone in a restaurant’s walkway and break a bone.  Injuries like this seem so avoidable, if only the grocery store had put a sign out indicating “Caution: Wet Floor!” or if the restaurant had fixed that stone two months earlier when they’d noticed it the first time.  But here’s where premises liability gets tricky. If, for instance, there was a sign saying “Caution: Wet Floor” and you slip and fall because you’re not paying attention, then you may not be able to prove liability on the store’s part for your fall.  That’s where a good <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5kYXZpZGRyZXhsZXJsYXcuY29tL3ByZW1pc2VzLWxpYWJpbGl0eS1hdHRvcm5leS1sb3MtYW5nZWxlcy5odG1s" target="_blank">premises liability attorney</a> can help you sort out the issue of negligence and liability. The bottom line is, no two slip and fall cases are the same. There is no set way to determine blame. Only an experienced attorney can tell you if you have a case.
<br /><br />It is worth mentioning here that if you should decide to seek out legal advice, you will want to seek out the services of a personal injury attorney.  Liability cases fall under their area of practice.  When seeking testimonials from friends, or even doing a Google search, you will find these attorneys refer to themselves as a “premises liability attorney” or even a “<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5zbGlwYW5kZmFsbGxhd3llcmxvc2FuZ2VsZXMuY29tLw__" target="_blank">slip and fall lawyer</a>”.
<br /><br />If you should bring a lawsuit against a property owner, the court will weigh how long such a situation existed and whether or not the property owner was careless or unreasonable in allowing a condition such as this to exist. Or whether he warned you that the problem existed and you ignored him. Conversely, the court will also determine if the victim is a ‘reasonable person’ as well.  If, for instance, the victim was trespassing on the property owner’s land or if he was doing something he clearly shouldn’t have been doing (like drinking five beers and climbing to the top of the nearest oak tree) then the court will take into consideration the victim’s own actions when determining premises liability.
<br /><br />An interesting case took place recently when a married pharmacist lured a woman to his home who’d come to him to fill a prescription. He did not tell her he was married or that his wife would soon be home. Instead, he took her into his bedroom and seduced her. The wife, naturally, came home and discovered them, then proceeded to attack the woman, injuring her.  The injured woman contacted premises liability attorney and sued the pharmacist. Now, that may seem odd, but the attorney argued that the pharmacist was liable because he lured her there under false pretenses. He invited her to his home. It was his duty to make sure she was safe there. The pharmacist was well aware of his wife’s propensity for violence.  Not only was the victim getting anti-anxiety and pain medication from him, (making her vulnerable) but she was completely unaware he was married. She had made decisions based on false information that, as a reasonable person, she would not have made otherwise. The court agreed and found for the victim. 
<br /><br />Children are a protected class when it comes to premises liability. When a child is injured on someone else’s property, a special group of laws apply. Something called “Attractive Nuisance” is often involved in children’s cases. Often, these cases turn tragic. Recently, a child in Southern California died after climbing through a broken fence to play in a sand tunnel. That broken fence and sand lot had long been the source of worry for many parents in the neighborhood. They complained to the property owner, but nothing was done to repair that fence. The child was killed when the sand tunnel he was playing in collapsed on him. The broken fence and dangerous sand lot posed an ‘attractive nuisance’, or something that might pose interest for a child. It was a preventable tragedy.  Likewise, property owners have the responsibility to protect other attractive nuisances, such as an un-strapped refrigerator outdoors, an unlocked storage unit, un-fenced swimming pool, or power equipment. Construction sites must also strictly enforce their safety codes. 
<br /><br />Workplace injuries also fall under premises liability law. While employers are held strictly liable for most injuries incurred on-the-job by Worker’s Compensation law, the amount of damages collectable by the injured party is limited. An expert premises liability attorney can determine whether other issues, such as product liability might be involved in such an accident at work.  There is a time limit on these types of cases so it’s important to contact an attorney who specializes in this kind of case as soon as possible after you have an accident.

<br /><br />Early in his life, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5kYXZpZGRyZXhsZXJsYXcuY29tLw__" target="_blank">personal injury attorney</a> David had the experience of growing up in the San Fernando Valley’s first kosher delicatessen, <em>Drexler’s Deli</em>, working behind the counter. David was exposed to the lively banter and dialogue which naturally emanates when hungry customers come to a delicatessen to eat home-cooked Jewish delicacies, discussing current events and politics, seeking answers to their personal problems, posing existential and philosophical questions and perhaps seeking a marriage <em>“match”</em> for a loved one.  It was the daily deli drama stage where stories and jokes were told, where life’s daily story unfolds and where counseling and therapy are dispensed with every delicious homemade meal.
<br /><br />The next stage in David Drexler’s development in performing arts was at Grant High School, in North Hollywood, where David participated in Boy’s Glee Choir, (he was a Choir Section Leader) and Madrigals.  In eleventh grade, David starred in the High School performance of Gilbert and Sullivan’s operetta “The <em>Pirates of Penzance</em>,” as Frederick, which was so popular that after four performances at the high school, the show went on tour to other schools.
<br /><br />At U.C.L.A., David was again drawn to the performing arts, becoming a member of the U.C.L.A. choir and performing leading roles in dance productions, choreographed by world renown Margalit Oved, a Yemenite-Israeli dancer/producer. David performed as a folk dancer in Danny Dassa’s Folkdance troupe, appearing at various venues including the Music Center. David led Israeli folk dancing at Hillel House and the UCLA Campus.
<br /><br />These performance skills and natural stage presence enable David to fluidly communicate and persuasively present a client’s case to a jury at trial. Successful trial presentation requires a wealth of knowledge, expertise and a showmanship skill set, necessary elements to win a jury trial. Trials are live; there are no taped rehearsals, out-takes or second chances.  To tell the client’s story to a jury requires poise, personality and people skills. David has the outstanding performance skills needed when its <em>“showtime”</em>.
<br /><br />When the storyline unexpectedly changes, during the prosecution of a personal injury case, improvisation and resourcefulness may very well save the day. A successful personal injury attorney must be able to change course, mid-stream, seamlessly and with the appearance and feel of confidence. David’s acting, singing, dancing and stage performance skills make him adept at improvisation when necessary. When a change of course must be navigated due to circumstances beyond the control of the litigants or lawyers, you need an experienced lawyer at the helm to make quick decisions and swift executions.
<br /><br />Personal injury attorney and trial lawyer David Drexler is that man.

From the lead paint discovered poisoning our children’s toys, to the massive judgments personal injury attorneys are winning against “big tobacco” companies for causing thousands to die of lung disease, the issue of product liability is a growing concern in this world driven marketplace.
<br /><br />Each year, thousands are injured or die from faulty products manufactured both here and abroad, or from the long-term effects of products known to cause serious health issues.  When death or injury occur, it is necessary to hire an attorney who specializes in product liability cases.  Product liability is one of several areas of practice covered by personal injury law.  Interestingly, however, product liability issues are so prevalent that a personal injury attorney who has been able to dedicate his entire practice to it may simply call himself a <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5kYXZpZGRyZXhsZXJsYXcuY29tL3Byb2R1Y3QtbGlhYmlsaXR5LWF0dG9ybmV5LWxvcy1hbmdlbGVzLmh0bWw_" target="_blank">product liability attorney</a>.
<br /><br />Drug companies, who now advertise to the masses with mega-million dollar marketing campaigns, attach long lists of potential side effects and potential health risks to their products. Sometimes, the lists are longer than the ad copy itself. Why? They are warning you. Warning because despite the potential good their product can do, they know bad things could happen to you. They are covering their legal bases and trying to protect themselves from lawsuits.
<br /><br />Product liability claims are generally based on one of these three issues: negligence, breach of warranty or strict liability.  The term “product liability” refers to the liability of manufacturers, and any or all parties associated with that chain of manufacture for damages caused by the product they produce. This definition is broad in scope, but the actual liability of manufacturers can scroll down to the minutest detail of a product that causes it to be dangerous. Product liability cases are generally based on three concepts:
<br /><br />• a defect in design,
<br />• a defect in the manufacturing process,
<br />• the failure to warn of potential for danger.
<br /><br />These concepts assume that the manufacturer has carefully considered the potential and foreseeable dangers inherent in his product’s design. So most claims of product liability are not based on negligence, but on a concept called ‘strict liability.’ Strict liability theory asserts that a manufacturer can be held responsible whether or not he/she acted negligently, because it presupposes that the well-off manufacturer is in a better position to assume the costs of liability than the victim and the manufacturer builds the cost of such liability into the price of his product. 
<br /><br />California was the first state to assert this theory in 1963 when it stopped requiring victims to prove negligence and allowed for compensation for product liability through strict liability. Strict liability theory is rarely applied to anything but manufacturing defects.  It rarely includes poor designs or failure to warn.  An experienced <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5kYXZpZGRyZXhsZXJsYXcuY29tLw__" target="_blank">personal injury attorney</a> can untangle these issues for you if you feel you’ve been the victim of product liability.
<br /><br />As an example, in Virginia, a man was using an industrial nozzle and hose to wash down some machinery. The defective nozzle exploded in his face, inflicting catastrophic facial, eye and traumatic brain injuries. The manufacturer in China was found to be negligent and strictly liable in its manufacturing of the nozzle. One wall of the nozzle was doubly thick and the other side only a few hair-widths wide. Examination of other similar nozzles found many more examples of the same defect. The product liability attorney recovered $4 million for his injured client.
<br /><br />“Breech of Warranty” claims in product liability can cover a broad range of problems.  If, for instance, in advertising or marketing a product, the manufacturer makes claims that are not only untrue, that pose a danger to the user, they can be held in breech of warranty. Let’s say the manufacturer of a chain saw claims that it’s great for cutting turkeys.  That also implies it might be useful for cutting other, non-tree limb objects.  The company has given instruction on what is a reasonable expectation of the product.  But when Sam Dolt uses the chain saw to carve his Thanksgiving turkey to impress his friends, the turkey not only flies off the table injuring his guests, the chain saw jumps off the metal carving plate and hits Sam in the shoulder injuring him, too, who is at fault? Was it Sam, for carving a turkey with a chain saw? Or the chain saw manufacturer for suggesting it was a good idea? Sam’s personal injury attorney argued that under breech of warranty theory, the manufacturer is liable because he expressly stated in his marketing campaign that this was one of the product’s possible uses. Sam, who does not need to prove negligence, would likely win this case.
<br /><br />Oftentimes claims of “Failure to Warn” are based on negligence. First, manufacturers owe a duty to the consumer to warn of potential problems. If they shirk that duty, then they are negligent. Secondly, if there is an injury and the breech of duty caused that injury, they are negligent. This is why you see little warning labels stuck to electric hair dryers that warn against using near water.  The manufacturer can rightly assume that you will be using this dryer in the bathroom (where water is plentiful) and it is their duty to warn you of that potential and foreseeable danger. If they breeched that duty, that would constitute negligence on their part.
<br /><br />If you believe you have been injured because of product liability, contact a product liability attorney.  It is important to take this crucial step as soon as possible. There is a time limit on filing product liability claims.

<br /><br />The daily challenges and demands of a busy law practice means lots of pressure and stress.
<br /><br />To cope with – and to cushion the impact from – major daily stressors, bicycle accident attorney David Drexler actively pursues his two favorite outside-of-work interests: cycling and yoga.  An avid road cyclist and yoga practitioner, David knows these personal interests help him cope with the harrowing daily pressures of litigation, court imposed demands and legal deadlines which are tacked onto the huge responsibility of operating a high performing law practice.
<br /><br />As an avid cyclist, David enjoys bike riding whenever the opportunity arises and, as one of Southern California’s top <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5kYXZpZGRyZXhsZXJsYXcuY29tL2JpY3ljbGUtYWNjaWRlbnQtYXR0b3JuZXktbG9zLWFuZ2VsZXMuaHRtbA__" target="_blank">bicycle accident attorneys</a> is a repository of knowledge regarding bikers’ safety issues, road hazards and accident reconstruction. Like Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaragoza, who crashed while cycling in July of 2010, David has gone down on his bicycle and can empathize with the pain and recovery needs of injury victims.
<br /><br />Introduced to mountain biking by a fellow yoga practitioner, David became a Sunday riding regular with a team of mountain bikers, founded over 20 years ago with matching blue and orange biking uniforms.  All it took was the gift of an old aluminum Specialized road bike frame from fellow rider to jump start David into becoming a dedicated “roadie,” riding Saturdays through the local hills and canyons with a local biking group and on most Sundays with yet another cycling team.
<br /><br />With almost forty years of success as one of Los Angeles’ premiere personal injury attorneys, David Drexler has earned the recognition of his peers and accolades from his clients based on his long string of successes in the courtroom, many of them involving bicycle accidents and injured bicyclists.
<br /><br />Using experience gained from many years of cycling, David has effectively represented a wide variety of riders, from recreational biking enthusiasts to competitive road racers and has spoken often to bicyclists about the need to ride safely and responsibly.  He is extremely knowledgeable about bicyclists’ rights and is a staunch advocate for safety and legislation that will enhance the cycling culture in Southern California.
