<br /><br />The analysts of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco say there is a more-than-50% probability of a recession and it will remain high during the first half of 2012.
<br /><br />Despite multiple reforms in Italy and Greece, the eurozone crisis is far from being over. It still may infect the US.
<br /><br />In the meantime, the US Dollar index keeps implementing the bullish scenario offered on Nov 15th 2011. According to the Department of Masterforex-V Trading System , it is forming a long-term upswing – wave A/B. The mid-term upswing - wave A(C ) or shortened C – is completed. If there is an upward FZR at 78.61, it will initiate wave C(C ). In this case the price will encounter resistance at 79.98 (the MF pivot) and 80.43 (the local high). The rally will be over once there is wave A, which breaks below the MF pivot 76.93 and the MF sloping channel.

European Central Bank currently has a real possibility to disburse loans to the countries of Eurozone, including its largest members. Such resources can become available in case of support by International Monetary Fund, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wcm9maS1mb3JleC51cw__" target="_blank">&quot;Market Leader&quot;</a> mag said.
<br /><br />A step in this direction can be a way to evade the law, as ECB is forbidden to directly disburse loans to problem countries. Such variant was considered by representatives of currency block and fund.
<br /><br />Majority of European politicians are inclined to think that support from European Central Bank will help them to win time in order to hold urgent reforms inside their countries. They suppose that resources of financial regulator can stop the budget debt crisis and prevent it from spreading to other European Union countries, such as Italy and France. However, according to economists, only ECB can guarantee stability at financial markets. Moreover, analytics cast doubt on the decision to increase lending capacity of European Financial Stability Facility to 1 trn.
<br /><br />Thus, the norms of EU can be evaded, as ECB will be a lender of last resort. Consequently, it will print Euro in the amount needed, which will certainly influence the rate of European currency.
<br /><br />According to the experts of Masterforex-V Trading System , Euro rate is traded within the flat zone of wave ?(?)/? of D1 wave level, bordering on 1.3811 and 1.3421. The bottom line of 1.3421 and the corresponding FZR are to be passed for the upward wave c(?) to continue. In this case strong support is provided by 1.3405/1.3393 range, as well as 1.3303/13275. Wave b(?) will reverse if NK MF 1.3811/1.4246 is left behind. If upswing continues and pivot MF 1.3810 is passed, the mid-term trend will change. As soon as FZR increases and passes pivot MF 1.4243, long-term trend targeting at 1.4376 will be worth considering.

This week the market was calm, and there were no major events to the end of it, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wcm9maS1mb3JleC51cw__" target="_blank">&quot;Market Leader&quot;</a> mag said.
<br /><br />In general, off-market situation was favourable. The atmosphere concerning the debts of such problem countries as Spain in Italy has become more or less stable, and the general financial situation in Europe has considerably improved. However, purchases have not gone up much, which has resulted into flat and minor decline.
<br /><br />The absence of clear positive trend has undermined the spirit of exchange market participants. American session has not decided on trend of prices. S&amp;P500 remains between resistance 1225 and support 1210, marking the bottom line of the week.

<br /><br />As there have been no clear movements during the week, financial sector has shown the growth of only 0.5% on its best day, whereas the weekly decline has amounted to over 5%.
<br /><br />Technological sector, the market’s largest sector, has shown the decline of 0.7% at the end of the week, and its weekly decline has amounted to about 4%.

<br /><br />In the short run, [the crisis] cannot be fixed by the ECB or by new governments in Greece, Italy or Spain : it’s about markets needing credible signals on the shape of fiscal and political union long before final treaty changes can take place. We suspect this spells the death of “muddle-through” as market pressures effectively force France and Germany to strike a momentous deal on fiscal union much sooner than currently seems possible, or than either would like. Then and only then do we think the ECB will agree to provide the bridge finance needed to prevent systemic collapse.”<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wcm9maS1mb3JleC51cw__" target="_blank">&quot;Market Leader&quot;</a> magazine said.
<br /><br />In the meantime EURUSD keeps moving in a wide range. According to the Department of FMA-Sar, Masterforex-V Academy, offer the following scenarios:
<br />If there is a rally breaking above 1.3544, the currency pair will get a chance to reach 1.3564 and 1.3609. If there is a downtrend with a break and consolidation below 1.3474, the price may well reach 1.3419.

<br /><br />As for the British Pound, the analysts of Deutsche Bank expect that in the first part of 2012 the British Pound will be weaker against the US Dollar. The preliminary estimations suggest that during the first part of 2012 GBP/USD will go down to $1.5300 and during the 2nd quarter it will reach $1.5100. In late 2012 the currency pair is expected to recover up to $1.5700.
<br /><br />According to the analytic team of Commerzbank, the closest targets are $1.5463 and $1.5271. However, the strongest support is $1.5050.
<br /><br />Meanwhile, according to the Department of Masterforex-V Trading System , GBPUSD keeps hitting the targets given in yesterday’s outlook.The currency pair keeps developing the Hound of the Baskervilles patter by Elder/MF, elongating the downswing. The closest targets are 1.5484/74, 1.5449/43, 1.5405, 1.5391/79. The downtrend will be over if the price break above the defensive MF pivot (1.5690 ) and sloping channel (as shown below):

Yesterday a three-sided meeting of French President Nikolas Sarkozy, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, and Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti was held in Strasbourg. As a result of negotiations, it has been agreed to bring in suggestions on altering the fundamental agreements of EU during the December summit of European Union, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wcm9maS1mb3JleC51cw__" target="_blank">&quot;Market Leader&quot;</a> mag said.
<br /> Among other steps, there is going to be introduced the system of automatic punishment for breakers of the Stability and Growth Pact. Nikolas Sarkozy admitted that suggestions will be formed during next several days: “We have moved forward a lot in this matter”. As a part of negotiations, Mario Monti has assured his Eurozone partners that Italy will have a balanced budget already in 2013, as previously planned. And his partners believed.
<br /><br />Particular attention is to be paid to another demonstration of negative attitude of Angela Merkel to issuing common European bonds. She supposes that there has not set the right conditions for issuing European bonds. Before this happens, “the existing structural weaknesses of the currency union are to be solved step by step; in the first rate, this concerns the absence of political union”.
<br /><br />EURUSD currency pair is likely to continue wave “?” of h1 level at FOREX market as soon as the correctional wave level rises within it. In this case, 1.3201 and 1.3152 will serve as major targets.
<br /> According to the System of Early Prediction Sub-department under the Department of Masterforex-V Trading System , another variant of movement, which is still likely to happen, involves forming a hidden down wave “?” of m15 level, which will be correctional to wave “A” of this timeframe, which was formed on Thursday. This scenario will be realized at the bounce of the ML (Main Line) from RS line (Resistance/Support) of AO Zotik indicator at h1 timeframe.

Nov 29th-Dec 2nd 2011<br/><br/>Last week the British Pound failed to avoid the impact of the eurozone crisis. This week the UK is to release 2 major indicators - Manufacturing PMI and Construction PMI. The Bank of England reports a sharp slowdown in the UK economic recovery amid poor GDP forecast for Q4 2011, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wcm9maS1mb3JleC51cw__" target="_blank">&quot;Market Leader&quot;</a> mag said.
<br /><br />The US Dollar keeps benefiting from the difficulties in Europe as it is currently seen as a safe haven asset. Non-Farm Payrolls are the economic report of the week, which is always attended by high volatility.
<br />GBPUSD started last week with a decline from 1.5794, the week’s high, and finished the trading week near the week’s low at 1.5422. Therefore, GBPUSD declined by 372 points. The option barrier 1.5721 was easily overcome. However, t he first test of the next barrier (1.5635) failed. The 2nd test was a success.
<br /><br />Let’s look at this week’s economic calendar
<br /><br />Nov 29th (GMT) 
<br /> 06:00 GBP Nationwide HPI
<br /> 15:00 USD CB Consumer Confidence
<br /><br />Nov 30th (GMT) 
<br /> 13:15 USD ADP Non-Farm Employment Change
<br /> 15:00 USD Pending Home Sales
<br /><br />Dec 1st (GMT) 
<br /> 1st-7th GBP Halifax HPI m/m
<br /> 09:30 GBP Manufacturing PMI
<br /> 13:30 USD Unemployment Claims
<br /> 15:00 USD ISM Manufacturing PMI
<br /><br />Dec 2nd (GMT) 
<br /> 09:30 GBP Construction PMI
<br /> 13:30 USD Non-Farm Employment Change
<br /> 13:30 USD Unemployment Rate
<br /><br />The UK:
<br /><br />Nationwide HPI: Last week the prices gained 0.4%, this time they are expected to lose 0.1%.
<br />Halifax HPI m/m: The exact time of the release is unknown. Last month the index grew by 1.2%.
<br />Manufacturing PMI: In October it fell below 50 down to 47.4. It suggests a cutback in production. In November the index is expected to decline down to 47.2. Only a recovery above 50.0 will help the British Pound.  The release is attended by high volatility.
<br />Construction PMI: The UK’s construction sector showed reassuring stats in October. The index grew up to 53.9. In November it is expected to see a slight decline. But it will most likely stay above the crucial level 50.0. The release is also attended by high volatility.
<br /><br />The US:
<br /><br />CB Consumer Confidence: Last month the index declined, thus suggesting pessimism over the current financial situation in the USA.
<br />ADP Non-Farm Employment Change: The indicator is expected to grow further up to 131.
<br /><br />Pending Home Sales: The amount of US homes under construction unexpectedly declined by 4.6% in September despite low mortgage rates. It is probably connected with high unemployment and reduced bank loans.
<br />Unemployment Claims: They are expected to decline down to 390K.
<br />ISM Manufacturing PMI: As long as the indicator is still above the 50.0 level, we can conclude that the US economy is still recovering.
<br />Non-Farm Employment Change: The index keeps reassuring investors. Last month it increased by 80K new jobs. The US labor market seems to be recovering, which is a positive sign for the country’s economy. This time the index is expected to see a 119K increase.
<br />Unemployment Rate:
<br />The US rate of unemployment declined down to the 6-month low (9.0%), which indicates a recovery in the US labor market as investors are getting less concerned about the possibility of a double-dip recession. However, the pace of recovery needs some acceleration in order to see cardinal changes.
<br /><br />The closest levels of resistance are 1.5635 and 1.5721, the closest levels of support are 1.5474 and 1.5388.

<br /><br />The data on the EU and US labor markets and Chicago PMI were the key market drivers.
<br /><br />Today’s news background is not going to be as rich in major stats. Nevertheless, special attention should be paid to the eurozone’s PMI and the US rate of unemployment.

Great Britain may become one of the world’s big debtors, yielding only to the US among those countries that have (or used to have) the AAA rating, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wcm9maS1mb3JleC51cw__" target="_blank">&quot;Market Leader&quot;</a> mag said.
<br /><br />The rating agency made such a conclusion after George Osborne’s recent speech, during which he forecast a considerable slowdown in the UK economic growth. The preliminary forecast was 1.7%, later it was revised and reduced to 0.9%. The forecast for 2012 was also revised and changed from 2.5% to 0.7%. Such a scenario will probably lead to new borrowings, thus increasing the country's sovereign debt.  
<br />The UK authorities are willing to keep pursuing their austerity policies, which is what Fitch would want.
<br /><br />In the meantime, GBPUSD keeps rallying. It has already completed wave A(C )/C inside the long-term upswing A/B. A break above the local high 1.5779 will start forming wave C(C ), with the closest targets located at 1.5795/98, 1.5839,1.5872/87, 1.5937. According to the Department of Masterforex-V Trading System , the downtrend will be resumed as soon as the price breaks below the MF pivot 1.5580 and the MF sloping channel (as shown below):

In his interview, one of major architects of European currency Frenchman Jacques Delors claimed that from the very beginning Euro had many drawbacks, but the mere idea of common currency is very positive, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wcm9maS1mb3JleC51cw__" target="_blank">&quot;Market Leader&quot;</a> mag said.
<br /><br />86-year old Delors, the President of the European Commission in 1985-1995, paid attention to the fact that European Union monetary policy had not stipulated a common coordination center. As a result, some EU members have fallen into debt.
<br /><br />According to Delors, the crisis, resulting from the debt of some countries, does not mean that the idea of common currency was bad. On the contrary, the idea is hard to bring into life.
<br /><br />Delors supposes modern European politicians have a delayed reaction to Euro crisis. The crisis has currently reached such high level that even Germans can lose their past dignity. The union of German monetary policy and the policy of European Union was very unsuccessful. 
<br /><br />What will happen to Euro rate in the nearest future? According to the DFWA Department of Masterforex-V Academy, the third wave of dollar weakening has been expected during the previous working week. The first stage of the motion has already finished; the second stage has started, as the week finished with a correction after the publication of unemployment rate. A minor upward motion is expected at the beginning of the current week; it will become correctional to the decline during the second half of the previous week. However, at the end of the week Euro can again drop in relation to dollar.

<br /><br />This is not thefirst time raters threaten eurozone members with rating cuts. S&amp;P explains its decision by economic and political instability in Europe.
<br /><br />In the meantime, EURUSD is recovering against the major downtrend. It has already formed wave A H8. The experts of Department of Masterforex-V Trading System see the following 2 alternative scenarios:
<br /><br />If there is a rally, with a FZR at 1.3548, EURUSD will initiate a “short” upswing – sub-wave a(C )H8, with the closest resistance at 1.3588. A downward scenario suggests coming out of the MF sloping channel 1.3211/1.3259 and breaking the MF pivot (as shown below). In this case, the closest support will be found around 1.3291/1.3281.

Financial markets were negative about the previous steps. Stocks declined while bond yields grew. Angela Merkel and Nicolas Sarkozy met earlier this week to work out a joint plan of coming out of the crisis, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wcm9maS1mb3JleC51cw__" target="_blank">&quot;Market Leader&quot;</a> mag said .
<br /><br />According to the French President the EU must fine those eurozone countries, the budget deficit of which exceeds 3%. Moreover, he is against using the ECB’s funds to buy risky European bonds.
<br /><br />During the EU summit other EU leaders will consider Sarkozy-Merkel’s plan aimed at tougher financial discipline. Some EU leaders say that only financial flexibility and external help can calm down all those protests and make the sick economies recover. However, these are not the arguments to persuade Germany and France.
<br /><br />According to the Department of Market Volume Analysis, Masterforex-V Academy, the EURUSD futures contract is in downtrend. Consider sales during upward retracements:
<br />The level of support is 1.3259 – today’s volume cluster
<br />The level of support is 1.3335 – yesterday’s volume cluster

<br /><br />Forex news, pound rate. London is not going to cede its economic independence for Brussels; however, it will continue taking part in discussing the numerous issues of the European Union, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wcm9maS1mb3JleC51cw__" target="_blank">&quot;Market Leader&quot;</a> mag said.
<br /><br />British MFA explains that such position is taken in order to protect the country’s financial sector from additional regulation. According to British opposition, refusal from budget integration will to some extent weaken the impact of the country on European Union policy.
<br /><br />Let us mention that, as a result of the first day of the Summit, a new financial agreement has been developed. It is to be signed by the heads of 23 states – EU members. However, this innovation has not been recognized by Lisbon Treaty, which is fundamental, due to the abovementioned position of the United Kingdom.
<br /><br />The rate of pound has started the bearish trend, highlighted in the overview dated 09/12/11; it has stopped at pivot MF 1.5525. According to the experts of the Department of ?asterforex-V Trading System, sub-wave ?(?) will start within mid-term bearish wave ?/? if the minimum of 1.5534 is passed. Resistance keeps being represented by pivot MF 1.5525 and Fibonacci points 1.5512/06, 1.5488, and 1.5468/64. The bearish movement will be over if sloping channel MF and pivot MF 1.5697 are passed.

Most economic indicators keep failing to have a major impact on volatility.  The eurozone crisis is definitely the focus, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wcm9maS1mb3JleC51cw__" target="_blank">&quot;Market Leader</a> mag said.
<br /><br />The latest EU summit failed to have a positive impact on the markets. On the contrary, the market started declining as EU leaders showed no unity in speech and actions. Yesterday Angela Merkel added fuel to the fire by denying the possibility of expanding the EFSF. Herman Van Rompuy decided to postpone the issue till March 2012, thus facing tough criticism and initiating a bond sell-off. Investors think that other measures won’t save the EU from recession.
<br /><br />Today’s news background is fairly rich in major stats, including the eurozone’s consumer prices, manufacturing and services PMI as well as the USA’s jobless claims and PPI.
<br /><br />The mentioned economic indicators usually have a considerable impact on the level of implied volatility. Amid the poor results of the latest EU summit, these indicators may well become market drivers .
<br /><br />The major levels of support and resistance are the option barriers 1.5388 and 1.5554 correspondingly.

<br /><br />This is not the first set of amendments to the budget, which has been adopted by the state government. Previous three sets were mostly targeted at the recovery of stricken areas. The remaining means were supposed to ease the influence of yen rate on Japanese economy.

<br /><br />When considering yesterday’s stats, it is necessary to mention an 0.6% increase in the UK’s GDP in Q3 2011, a decline in the US jobless claims down to 364K and a 0.2% increase in the US consumer sentiment
<br /><br />It is also necessary to mention the escalating recession in the US housing market: the HPI has shown negative dynamics, the lowest value since May 2011.
<br /><br />Today’s economic stats are relatively scanty. Nevertheless, it is worth paying attention to the USA’s durable core goods as well as consumer income and spending.
<br /><br />A considerable gap between the actual data and the forecast is probable for any of the indicators. If so, the implied volatility will surge. Those who want to trade those factors, can purchase strategies in the morning and close the trades right after the news releases.

<br /><br />Dec 30th (GMT)
<br /> 07:00 GBP Nationwide HPI
<br /><br />CB Consumer Confidence. This is a major indicator for the USA. It is expected to increase up to 58.5 points, which will suggest a stronger US dollar. If the report comes out much worse or better than expected, the level of volatility will surge.
<br />Unemployment Claims. It is expected to increase a little, which will speak against USD.
<br />Pending Home Sales. This index is said to grow only 1.4%, which is much lower than last month’s 10.4%.
<br />Nationwide HPI. This indicator released by the British construction company Nationwide is expected to gain 0.3%, which is close to last month’s value.
<br />The option levels of resistance are 1.5635 and 1.5721, the option levels of support is 1.5474.
