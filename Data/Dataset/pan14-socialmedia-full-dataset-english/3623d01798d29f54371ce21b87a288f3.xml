What made this re-release this type of huge success, even after 17 years because it first hit the big screen?<br /><br />I'll admit it now; the Lion King is one of my favourite Disney animated movies of all time. I would imagine many people have the same way. Disney had stepped up the objective with this particular production using cutting edge technology at that time to produce some jaw-dropping scenes. We all recall the wildebeest stampede don't we? But it wasn't only the visuals that sealed the offer for this blockbuster; it was also the musical score. Lion King employed the talents of Elton John, the first pop star to compose a musical score for a <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5mdW5ueXRveXNnaWZ0LmNvbS9jaGVhcC10b3ktd2hvbGVzYWxlcnMtUGx1c2gtaGF0LUQtMTYxMi5odG1sLw__" target="_blank"><strong>cheap toy wholesalers</strong></a>  film.<br /><br />There were also some exceptional voice actors joining the cast. James Earl Jones provided the authoritative tone of Mufasa and Jeremy Irons gave a clear, crisp tongued dialogue to Scar. These talents gave some depth to the characters making you actually feel like they'd come to life. Combined with the art and direction, Lion King had been a masterpiece, however it doesn't end there.<br /><br />The Lion King was the very first Disney film to show a main characters death also it pulled about the heartstrings of everyone. Hence the storyline was something no one else might have foreseen, veering away momentarily in the happy fairy-tale of most other Disney films. Of course Bambi had done something similar, however it was a passing moment compared to seeing the anguish on poor Simba's face as he realised his father wouldn't be waking up.<br /><br />Audiences would now be captivated in seeing this story through, hoping Simba would realise his potential and face the evil Scar once and for all and, of course, Disney didn't disappoint.<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5mdW5ueXRveXNnaWZ0LmNvbS8_" target="_blank"><strong>Stationery manufacturers</strong></a>  <br /><br />Now the blockbuster has returned in 3D allowing another generation to enjoy this fantastic tale. Judging in the success from the re-release in the US, it is no doubt likely to create a storm over here. In the end, Disney films are retro classics which can be enjoyed through the whole family for years to come.<br /><br />That's not all though! Following a success from the Lion King in 3D, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5mdW5ueXRveXNnaWZ0LmNvbS9kaXNuZXktdG95cy13aG9sZXNhbGUtUGx1c2gtc2xpcHBlcnMtRS0xNzU4Lmh0bWwv" target="_blank"><strong>disney toys wholesale</strong></a>   are intending to re-release other classic in 3D within the next two years, including Beauty and the Beast, The Little Mermaid, Finding Nemo and Monsters. Inc. It's good to determine that we may have the opportunity to watch these great films about the giant screen once more.
