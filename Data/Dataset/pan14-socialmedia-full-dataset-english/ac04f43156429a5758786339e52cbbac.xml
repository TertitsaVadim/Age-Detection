<br />the right one, so that when we finally meet the right person, we
<br />will know how to be grateful for that gift. Maybe when the door of
<br />happiness closes, another opens, but often times we look so
<br />long at the closed door, that we don't see the one which has
<br />been opened for us. Maybe the best kind of friend is the kind
<br />you can sit on a porch and swing with, never say a word, and
<br />then walk away feeling like it was the best conversation you've
<br />ever had. Maybe it is true that we don't know what we have got
<br />until we lose it, but it is also true that we don't know what we
<br />have been missing until it arrives. Giving someone all your love is
<br />never an assurance that they will love you back. Don't expect
<br />love in return; just wait for it to grow in their heart. But if it does
<br />not, be content it grew in yours. It takes only a minute to get a
<br />crush on someone, an hour to like someone, and a day to love
<br />someone, but it takes a lifetime to forget someone. Don't go for
<br />looks; they can deceive. Don't go for wealth; even that fades
<br />away. Go for some one who makes you smile, because it takes
<br />only a smile to make a dark day seem bright. Find the one that
<br />makes your heart smile. There are moments in life when you
<br />miss someone so much that you just want to pick them from
<br />your dreams and hug them for real. Dream what you want to
<br />dream; go where you want to go; be what you want to be,
<br />because you have only one life and one chance to do all the
<br />things you want to do. May you have enough happiness to make
<br />you sweet, enough trials to make you strong, enough sorrow to
<br />keep you human, enough hope to make you happy. Always put
<br />yourself in others' shoes. if you feel that it hurts you, it probably
<br />hurts the other person, too. The happiest of people don't
<br />necessarily have the best of everything; they just make the most
<br />of everything that comes along their way. Happiness lies for
<br />those who cry, those who hurt, those who have searched, and
<br />those who have tried; for only they can appreciate the
<br />importance of people who have touched their lives. Love begins
<br />with a smile, grows with a kiss and ends with a tear. The
<br />brightest future will always be based on a forgotten past. You
<br />can't go on well in life until you let go of your past failures and
<br />heartaches. When you were born, you were crying and everyone
<br />around you was smiling. Live your life so that when you die, you
<br />are the one who is smiling and everyone around you is crying.

<br /><br />Girl:Hey babe, I'll be right back. I need to take this call.
<br /><br />Boy: Yeah okay. Sure.
<br /><br />She walks into the next room.
<br /><br />Girl: Hey! What's up?
<br /><br />Guy [on her cellphone]: Nothing, hey hun, do you think we could go do something later tonight? What are the chances my boss let me get out early.
<br /><br />Girl: Yeah, sounds great!
<br /><br />Guy [on her cellphone]: Okay. I'm right by your house, I'll come to get you now.
<br /><br />Girl: That's not such a good idea...
<br /><br />Guy [on her cellphone]: Why not?
<br /><br />Girl: I'm busy right now... sorry.
<br /><br />Guy [on her cellphone]: With what? It's our anniversary! You didn't make any other plans did you...?
<br /><br />In her head she yells, SHIT! Throws clothes back on quickly.
<br />Girl: No No... I was just eating... with the family.
<br /><br />Guy [on her cellphone]: But I thought you said your family was away this weekend, up at your resort?
<br /><br />The guy walks into her house, turns the corner into the hallway. Goes downstairs, and finds his bestfriend on her couch, half un-dressed, trying to pull his pants back on and his girlfriend pulling her shirt over her head.
<br /><br />Guy: What the hell is going on?!
<br /><br />Girl: I can explain! Please listen to me!
<br /><br />Guy: Benny? How could you do this to me! Rachel! I thought you loved me! And yet, your sleeping with MY BEST FRIEND!!!!
<br /><br />Girl: John...!
<br /><br />John with tears in his eyes, he rushes out of room, and slams the door.
<br /><br />Benny climbs out of the window, starts his car, and drives off down the street.
<br /><br />Girl runs after her boyfriend. Yelling...
<br /><br />Girl: NOOOO! Please!! Come back John!! Pleeeeeasssse????!! She falls down and cries.
<br /><br />John turns around, looks straight at his girlfriend in tears.
<br /><br />John: Why? Rachel, why? I loved you! Oh my God, I'm in love with a whore. Does this mean I have to pay you now?!
<br />Here take this as the cash. He drops a ring box on her lap.
<br /><br />She opens the ring box. Her jaw drops... Before her eyes is a diamond wedding ring.
<br /><br />Girl: You were going to propose?
<br /><br />Guy: Yeah... how dumb was I? And as he slowly walked back to his car, his headlights faded... And she was in despair.
<br /><br />Later that night, the girl got a phone call from the police saying he just jumped off the bridge and killed himself.

		<document id="ed849efc115345aedbc2b161107092f3" url=""><![CDATA[Hmmmm.<br/><br/>A teenage girl about 17 had gone to visit some friends one evening and
<br />time passed quickly as each shared their various experiences of the
<br />past year. She ended up staying longer than planned, and had to walk
<br />home alone. She wasn't afraid because it was a small town and she lived
<br />only a few blocks away. As she walked along under the tall elm trees,
<br />Diane asked God to keep her safe from harm and danger. When she
<br />reached the alley, which was a short cut to her house, she decided to
<br />take it. However, halfway down the alley she noticed a man standing at
<br />the end as though he were waiting for her. She became uneasy and
<br />began to pray, asking for God's protection. Instantly a comforting feeling
<br />of quietness and security wrapped round her, she felt as though
<br />someone was walking with her. When she reached the end of the alley,
<br />she walked right past the man and arrived home safely. The following
<br />day, she read in the newspaper that a young girl had been raped in the
<br />same alley just twenty minutes after she had been there. Feeling
<br />overwhelmed by this tragedy and the fact that it could have been her,
<br />she began to weep. Thanking the Lord for her safety and to help this
<br />young woman, she decided to go to the police station. She felt she could
<br />recognize the man, so she told them her story. The police asked her if
<br />she would be willing to look at a lineup to see if she could identify him.
<br />She agreed and immediately pointed out the man she had seen in the
<br />alley the night before. When the man was told he had been identified, he
<br />immediately broke down and confessed. The officer thanked Diane for
<br />her bravery and asked if there was anything they could do for her. She
<br />asked if they would ask the man one question. Diane was curious as to
<br />why he had not attacked her. When the policeman asked him, he
<br />answered, &quot;Because she wasn't alone. She had two tall men walking on
<br />either side of her.&quot; Amazingly, whether you believe or not, you're never
<br />alone. Did you know that 98% of teenagers will not stand up for God?
