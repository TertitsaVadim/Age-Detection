<br />and hears strange noises coming
<br />from the bedroom. He rushes
<br />upstairs to find his wife naked on
<br />the bed, sweating and panting.
<br />&quot;What's up?&quot; he says. &quot;I'm having
<br />a heart attack,&quot; cries the woman.
<br />He rushes downstairs to grab the
<br />phone for ambulance, but just as
<br />he's dialing, his 4-year-old son
<br />comes up and says, &quot;Daddy!
<br />Daddy! Uncle Fred is hiding in
<br />your closet and h...e's got no
<br />clothes on!&quot;
<br />The man slams the phone down
<br />and storms upstairs into the
<br />bedroom, past his screaming
<br />wife, and rips open the wardrobe
<br />door. Sure enough, there is his
<br />brother, totally naked, covering on
<br />the closet floor.
<br />&quot;You b*stard,&quot; the man says,&quot; my
<br />wife is having a heart attack and
<br />you're running around naked
<br />scaring the kids!&quot;

<br />should be done by mature people
<br />who understand the reasons
<br />behind.
<br />2. When f***ing, take enough
<br />fluids.
<br />3. When f***ing, you must be fit
<br />spiritually and physically.
<br />4. F***ing should be done in bed
<br />because it takes a lot of energy.
<br />5. F***ing is healthy.
<br />So you see, fasting is good!

<br />of England. He asked her, 'Your
<br />Majesty, how do you run such an
<br />efficient government? Are there...
<br />any tips you can give to me? I
<br />... want to help Nigeria'
<br />'Well,' said the Queen, 'the most
<br />important thing is to surround
<br />yourself with intelligent people.'
<br />Jonathan frowned, and then
<br />asked, 'But how do I know the
<br />people around me are really
<br />intelligent?'
<br />The Queen took a sip off her cup
<br />of tea. 'Oh, that's easy; you just
<br />ask them to answer an intelligent
<br />riddle.' The Queen pushed a
<br />button on her intercom. 'Please ...
<br />send Tony Blair in here, would
<br />you?'
<br />Tony Blair walked into the room
<br />and said, 'Yes, Your Majesty?' The
<br />Queen smiled and said, 'Answer
<br />me this please. Tony, your mother
<br />and father have a child. It is not
<br />your brother and it is not your
<br />sister. Who is it?'
<br />Without pausing for a moment,
<br />Tony Blair answered, 'That would
<br />be me.'
<br />'Yes! Very good,' said the Queen.
<br />Jonathan went back home to ask
<br />N. Sambo, his vice presidential
<br />choice the same question.
<br />'Sambo, answer this for me. Your
<br />mother and your father have a
<br />child. It's not your brother and it's
<br />not your sister. Who is it?' 'I'm
<br />not sure', said Sambo. 'Let me
<br />get back to you on that one...' He
<br />went to his Advisors and asked
<br />every one, but none could give
<br />him an answer.
<br />Finally, one night, he ran into Dora
<br />Akunyili:. Sambo asked, ?Dora,
<br />can you answer this for me? Your
<br />mother and father have a child
<br />and it's not your brother or your
<br />sister. Who is it?'
<br />Dora answered sharply, 'That's
<br />easy, it's me!'
<br />Sambo smiled, and said, 'Thanks!'
<br />Then, he went back to speak with
<br />Jonathan. 'Sir, I did some research
<br />and I have the answer to that
<br />riddle. It's 'Dora Akunyili'!
<br />Jonathan got up angrily,frowning
<br />he said to Sambo. No wonder
<br />Nigeria isn't moving forward, I
<br />don't have intelligent people
<br />around me. You Dummy! The
<br />answer is Tony Blair!!!....

<br />City,over how a 300 level female student of the
<br />College of Social Sciences of the Igbinedion
<br />University,Okada,narrowly escaped death after a
<br />steamy sex session with her super rich Sugar daddy,who is an Alhaji. The female student who hails from Asaba,the Delta
<br />State Capital was a regular bed mate of the super rich
<br />Alhaji,who constantly and regularly takes care of her
<br />needs and spoilt her silly with money and other
<br />material things. It was learnt that on the fateful day,the Alhaji,who is
<br />said to shuttle between Abuja,Lagos and Benin called
<br />her up to book an hotel around her
<br />campus,pretending that he wanted her to be closer
<br />to school. She did as the Alhaji instructed and subsequently
<br />packed her bag ready for the weekend for the arrival
<br />of the Alhaji. At the hotel, the fun started as usual and everything
<br />was going on well. It was learnt that usually,the Alhaji use condom any
<br />time he wants to sleep with her,but on this day,he
<br />insisted that they should be comfortable in each
<br />other’s company since they are no more strangers to
<br />each other. She refused initially,but when she realized the Alhaji
<br />was getting angry,she remembered that she had a
<br />female condom in her bag,so she went to the toilet
<br />and inserted the female condom after which she
<br />agreed to have sex with him.Immediately after the
<br />show Alhaji’s phone beeped. His mood changed and he got dressed and started
<br />hurrying to leave her saying that he got an urgent
<br />call to be in Abuja. She went into the toilet to remove the condom and
<br />was shocked to find tiny black ants attempting to
<br />crawl out. The territory sight made the lady scream aloud from
<br />the hotel room when she had lodged with the Alhaji
<br />thereby attracting the attention of the hotel workers
<br />and management,who subsequently killed the
<br />crawling black ants.
<br />LADIES BE CAREFUL CUS A MOMENT OF PLEASURE CAN CUT YOUR LIFE SHORT!
