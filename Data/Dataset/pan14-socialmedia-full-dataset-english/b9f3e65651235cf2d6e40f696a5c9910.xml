We are getting a double dose of what is termed dangerous town to live in. 
<br /><br />Economically borno state can't be said to be an economic power house because the only vibrant thing going on in the state is agricultural sectors mostly dominated by the poor and middle class poor. For this reason the state of borno contributes to the GDP of the nation. But borno has a very sound economy for the people living in maiduguri, we boast of a good fish business courtesy of the lake chad, but I am saying that the indigenous people are not productive but in the actual sense but by counting our blessings God has blessed the state naturally but though at this point we are blessed with natural resources that are never tapped or maximised. Even tourism can be said to be 1 of what borno state has to off. Sorry for that crash course in borno state economy but it is better I put it like that.
<br /><br />For these reasons maiduguri doesn't seem to have much visitors in the past year, the escalation of the crisis has had a phobia like situation for visitors, if they ever need to come then they will not over stay their visits due to the security situation, a lot off hotels have been run down because of low patronage the best you can get is this they come and leave as soon as they come with people having exceptionally leaving time of 4-6 hours in the state and back to their homes in a single day by taking an air plane. 
<br /><br />Business men are shutting down their shops, and some are also trying to dispose off their old stock with the anticipation or taking their leave as soon as they sell off their wares, I can tell you of many closed businesses that has been closed especially pharmacies, book shops, retail stores and, others have been closed down till further notice the would say but right inside our hearts we know that they are gone for good, one more negative indices to the economy of the state.

I am the very last person to comment about parenting because I have a long way to go and a lot to learn but at least you would not find fault when you want to see things or express your comments on parenting. 
<br />I would like to be gin with the dynamics before the structure of parenting and no other way can you do that except by studying my parents
<br /><br />Ok I grew up in a family of 7 and to sincere I got the lucky spot that is the 7 and I must tell you it is a good thing since you will be able to get off any error you make because no one will tell me; &quot;are you setting a good example for your juniors&quot; that has never happened it is like you are above the family constitution and to be honest you get a lot of pampering but in fact in time I came to know that it was almost the same thing like being a teddy bear toy, they play with you for therapy for them and me I do the jokes they laughed I mean it was what I would call one big family. 
<br /><br />What I liked the most that it was not a circus but there was order, and we all had our roles to play respecting our elders going on errands and behaving well when visitors came around. There was some memories I hold dear timeless family moments like watching soap opera's, like &quot;checkmate&quot; mexican soaps I mean the eighties was a good time to be born in, I had a big head this gave me the advantage of remembering things I should have forgotten. But from my earliest memories I know my daddy once spanked my but when I was 5 years old for rebellion, I got a gift of 50kobo note new crispy note and then when I asked for it later he gave me a tattered 50note right before him I tore the not before him, now that was the last straw that broke the camels back.
<br /><br />&quot;Don't spear the rod&quot;
<br /><br />The family protects it's own, any secrets about any family will be guarded by all because you will be directly or indirectly affect you so some secrets stays in the family. No matter what happens there should be patriotism we protect each other in a fanatical way and this is the best I think.
<br /><br />&quot;The family protects his own&quot; 
<br /><br />Every member in the family is a team player he has a role no matter how small it becomes highly significant in a family. The reason for team play is because we all have weaknesses and strengths, so from time to time there is a point in time where by we protect each others weaknesses and augment or amplify the strength. I must say &quot;unrivalled&quot; support.
<br /><br />&quot;For two to work together there must be an agreement&quot; 
<br /><br />This is the point I call bonding, or consolidation where by a member of the family is given or gets an emotional connection with ourselves, let me put it like this, we cry more over the loss of a loved one than an outersider to be continued by usman malgwi

The significance is becoming thin and the new age religions are taking over, eastern religions, yoga and meditation has now replaced.    
<br /><br />The cautious thing is that it is getting into the church, the society influences the church more than the church affecting the society, we are seeing a lot of unspiritual and unedifying activities and jamborees I am not criticising the fact that the church uses loud speakers or now go evangelism in a bus instead of donkeys and mules but what I am saying is this, christianity is being modernised to fit into the time we are living in now. A lot of doctrines are simply new age doctrines, where by the very core of christianity that is entrenched in conservatism is being or turning into a secular body. 
<br /><br />The church has a significant role to play in these periods we are in they are the light the element of change and every good revolution should start inside the church. The church today can't actually resist in the western world I mean to say america and UK, the church is sorry to say not seen as that institution that holds the highest moral values. Meaning to say that the church is just another organisation and not an element of change and even if they would involve the church then it will be because of tradition or culture like the church of england and the royal family.

The rich are the masters because they had what the poor people needed and for that reason poor people were taken advantaged of. Having money can take someone from the bottom to the very top of the food chain excuse my description. 
<br /><br />&quot;The man with the gold rules&quot;
<br /><br />Any where a rich man goes to he is highly welcomed no one see him with any defects or negativity, he has high acceptance with no strain of thought as into how he got the money, once it is money it can be purified or cleaned. Like a quote I once read that says &quot;even if you are very ugly, money covers that and you will be as handsome as a prince&quot;, so funny but true!
<br /><br />The poor man looks at the rich man like a divine being in other words someone who can do magic or a miracle but in the true sense as someone who has all the solutions to their problems and for that main fact the poor will worship the rich. But if you look at it more cautiously you will learn to understand that the rich doesn't know how the poor man live because he is too busy enjoying his wealth. A rich man that is having migraine or a dislocation would be flown abroad for medical treatment, the poor man is at the mercy of the herbs and wild flowers to treat his malaria.
<br /><br />The poor man sleeps and forgets his worries he has little or few enemies, he survives on very little, when the food is not enough he tops it with water and then he bulges and out he goes under the sun doing the most cumbersome tasks. If you want a title in your village just bribe the elders if you want a crowned with a doctorate degree donate money to a university as a philanthropist. To be continued by usman malgwi

<br /><br />Their greatest strength is non visibility in other words they are like ghosts you can't see them but they can see you, when they hit a target they vanish and even the world's best detectives are oblivious to its methods. But when you study alqeda they seem to have the potent method of fighting their enemie by a strike and run tactics, the soldiers may complain but in the actual sense there is &quot;no rules to the game let us see who wins&quot;
<br /><br />The civilians also contribute to the hysteria because every loud sound and shivers go through their spine, it makes people have cold feet, now according to maslow's theory of human that man considers his security after his physiologic needs and demands that both a met before climbing the upper scale. It is a fact that majority of the people are subscribing to that. So should we adopt the principle of sleeping with one eye open or for a call to evacuate. We are all weighing all the options that are available to us.

<br /><br />&quot;Blood is thicker than water&quot;
<br /><br />We see the effects in the broader society I mean to say the rouges of the community and the outlaw's excuse my use of such strong language but they happen to fall into the category of those who did not have a strong father figure or mother figure or the parents did not live up to the expectation or the challenge of bringing up their children. Children from broken homes tend to exhibit anti social behaviours. 
<br /><br />A lot of times children born in orphanages and foster homes tend to have or experienced sexual abuse in one form or the other, most times it is the females that are affected the most. Just reading the daily newspapers you would definitely see such a story where by &quot;uncle&quot; or &quot;aunty&quot; did this to me. It actually is a gory thing to hear that some well respected individuals tend to do such evil acts to very innocent children. They grow up psychologically scarred and emotionally imbalanced that fitting into society or into certain relationships could be very hard for them.  To be continued

The poor man is so poor that he preoccupied himself with how poor he is he never sees himself a rich man he sees himself as cursed by the gods if he or she is a traditionalist, ohh! To have misfortune is like their bed mate, he goes into his room sits down and look at the grandeur of his poverty and even dreams of how he is the poorest individual in the world, and to be very honest with you one thing I know is this that the poor depend so much on luck that they sometimes have a philosophy that what is their own will come to you! No comments! 
<br /><br />The poor man has fewer people he could call friends and of the multitude of his relations who sometimes think they don't have any regard for the poor, or don't like being related to poor relatives. The days of the poor is mashed it lack and peril and they suffer the stigma of being poor. Then one out of the poor children(mostly a male) he would stand up for his family and say he has had too much of this caste like systems and packs his clothes and all he owns and heads for the new city. In the city it is claimed that it is a place to be if an individual wants to be rich. To be continued by usman malgwi

Though this name has been substitute as &quot;developing&quot; nations and would also like to look at things in another light. So here is the perspective here for how long are african countries catch up with the already developing countries, just look to asia and look at how in time past we were all regarded as 3rd world countries but today such countries are global power houses. 
<br /><br />How can an oil producing nation paradoxically be one of the poorest nations in the world lost for words if I am dreaming then I want to wake up but like we all see it like a dream, we have the most valueable resource that drives and lubricate the worlds economy due to over dependence of revenue we get from oil. Our dependence on oil is a great security risk because we have developed or utilising just one sector only and as such this can have a negative impact on the economy is crude prices drop. 
<br /><br />We are a third world country because we have failed to tap into other sectors of the economy, and under development simply means when the common wealth of a nation is not utilised to the maximum for provision of social amenities that will benefit the poor or lower class. This country doesn't have any excuse for it has sufficient amount of any resource both capital and human to stand on the world stage as a force to reckon with. 
<br /><br />When you talk about under development we are viewing or looking at the under utilisation of the natural resources so it means let a land flow with milk and honey but if the resource is not shared equally then the country or that region remains poor. And this has been the bain of this country of africa in general, what type natural resource don't we have in nigeria or in africa but it is bad or under utilised.

I just think people who worry are always expecting the worst possible outcome. 
<br />Some people over indulge in worrying that they feel that they have to be worried it is a noble thing or maybe seen even as a spiritual thing. 
<br /><br />Sometimes worry seems to be the habit they see it as an intrinsic nature and therefore they don't want to do anything about it because they grew up like that and there is every likelihood they learnt it while growing up. But there is another side to worry that we tend to do a lot and it is this we can't just break the habit! It is a habit but most people don't get the drift, worry makes us vulnerable to very little issues. It gets to a point we become so obsessed with it and then like a thread mill we are back on it again. It is not easy to cure worry because our emotions simply can't resist worrying. 
<br /><br />I mean worrying tends to sap your mental and emotional energy to a point when it will virtually run you down and stay unproductive, the feelings makes cede to depression as a last resort and then we can have a pity party for ourselves and then we will be the only individual there. Look at it like this think of your most happiest moments maybe your first car, family moments, or social things you relish and spend sometime on it think and saying to yourself life is good I am so blessed.

Our feelings are one of the thing that affects the how we live. When we desire something we are preoccupied and this gives room for it to be seen as the most dominant thought because our we emotions have a great holding on us. 
<br /><br />Now how could I explain what desire is, hummm! Like thirst we all have been thirsty due to some peculiar reasons but the truth is you never think of anything if not water, your most dominant issue is water. Or should I take the instance of someone who is thirsty the first thing on his mind is getting water to drink, so if there is anything that is of importance to such a person is to satisfy his desire for water. Once a man is consumed by desire he just can't be stopped take a cue from &quot;think &amp; grow rich&quot; explains how a man burning with desire just launches out on a limb and throwing away the normal pattern of success.
<br /><br />Or maybe taking the example of a man drowning in a river he gulps water and like we all know no one drinks more water than a drowning man, what is in his thinking is air! If you could ask him to make a wish the first thing he will say he wants is air he wants to breath air. This is no doubt so. I will just hint on fear a little because I have written on it but to put it in a summarised view. Fear is your enemy when you get infected by fear it manipulates you in every single way I mean to say that you develop a preconditioned response to it.

An example is the great wall of china that is visible from the international space station, it is monumental considering the scope of the wall, anyway gives a light on how civilisations lived. Nothing has impacted the world we live in today like the internet, space and time crushed and has turned the world into the over used phrased &quot;the world is a global village&quot;. This fact can't be over emphasised 
<br /><br />In our world of today we have a lot of things we can call out as the wonders of the modern world not in the actual sense they are but using the criterion as a monument it is easy to decipher and I must say it is the internet! <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" /> yes did I caught you napping I hope not well the truth is this the internet has changed the way we are living our lives today and when you talk of the limitations there are but few. 
<br /><br />Like we all know they say today's luxuries end up becoming tomorrows necessity, this also applies to the internet it was elitist but today the internet has gotten to the very bottom or basics of our life. Name it everything is going high tech or internet especially banking, education, communication and many other thing we can imagine. Let us use this great internet power to in the words of archimedes and use it as a lever to move the world. By usman malgwi

Well the thing is this your self is a very plastic or flexible concept, we tend to be in a constant state of evolution, everything tends to be constantly changing irrespective to who we are it is simple every experience seems to be constantly changing around us. 
<br /><br />Your self is one of the factors or internal factors under their disposition like a quote goes like this you are the master of your fate and destiny you can't achieve any thing great without changing into what you want to be. To empower your self you have to and need to redefine yourself, yes! From scratch, from the very minimal detail to the most obvious you have to redefine everything about you. Let me put it like this people tend to have this very wrong notions about themselves which affects them to create the type of personality that can attract the type of success you want. 
<br /><br />Let me give an illustration 
<br /><br />I find no other ways to say this but you have to be yourself best friend, love yourself more, some people think they are unlovable or worth something but such thoughts are simply baseless, don't think of yourself like that you are too unique I don't know how to tell you how unique you are but I will be taken as a man who flatters of which I don't just know this you are the last copy of yourself. And to tell you the fact there is nothing so far fetched about life the way you see yourself is all that counts, you could be a cat with the mind of a lion, and someone could be a lion with a heart like that of a cat so ladies and gentlemen it is up to you to see yourself flying as it is supposed or simply live like a duck which you are not make a pick

The scene was at a point when they all faced with the threat of death, I mean it was like they were about to die from a natural disaster and there and then they panicked and became hysterical but there was a possibility of chance that some factors outside their control could turn their fate into that of hope. 
<br /><br />One man suggested that let us think of what we will do after this encounter and it sounds kind of crazy to be in a mess and then ignoring it and looking up at the stars, this is just absurd I am putting this down on paper but I am must say I think personally it is difficult for me to actually do so. 
<br />We face many challenges in this life but one thing you must note is this, have hope, just have hope and the truth is this hope can actually alter the situation I know that hope is difficult to find when the harsh realities of life stares you in the eye ball.  
<br /><br />Have hope in every situation, even though it may look as if you are going to lose it all use the eye of faith and visualise your self doing good in the future don't be trapped in the prison of the present don't allow the present to weigh down on you and cause you to be depressed, feeling sad or sorry for yourself is unproductive and counter productive so please be proactive get out of your bed with a lot of energy say I am going to have a great brand new day and I am one less day to my dreams.

Now some books in finance would make us understand that the way of building wealth. Any financial book look at the asset column in order to come up with the exact worth in any organisation. Your assets are what holds any business or company, your assets is the last defence against any financial tsunami that may occur in the future so it is a good thing that we understand the role of assets 
<br /><br />The opposite of assets is liabilities and this can be used to predict your worth, so mind you your wealth is in most cases are seen as not soluble. Now an asset as we all know should generate income and increase in value. So we will start looking into our lives and see whether what we have been looking as assets are actually liabilities. For example when we put into focus let's say a brand new car may seem like an asset but actually its value drops by 30% when it leaves the show room! Yes! Its value drops! 
<br /><br />Human Assets(intangible)
<br /><br />But what I want to talk about here is this if you don't know then know it now that there are certain individuals that are or could be seen as assets, the reason is this you end up benefiting by relating with other people it will be a win-win situation. Assets generate value such that it encomprises a lot of things.
<br /><br />Failing to see human being as assets has been the bane of africa's under development in recent times, our human assets or resources are poorly tapped and the motivation or positive reinforcement are generally very poor.  Africa has made a gross mistake of not developing its human resources and this is seen in the annual budget allocations which the government make do you think it is geared towards developing the human resource of a country.

J.P. Morgan was accused of trying to monopolize the railway system but let me put things like this &quot;what did you do when others were trying to get rich&quot;.
<br /><br />Wealth is a good thing and it is important so far earthly issues are concerned, but there is a moral concern about few rich many poor, i mean why would 2% of any population controls 98% of the wealth, can we say that there is a level of unfairness at one point or the other. To say the fact is this that not all fingers are equal and the rich and the poor will abound and will surely be a sign of a very normal society. They both have their problems no one is free of all 
<br /><br />But most people have a problem that seems to be ingrained by misconceptions about being rich that wealthy people are bad or engage in one form or dirty thing to have become rich. To be rich comes with a great responsibility along side with it because if you look at what it means to be rich you would observe that there is a duty ascribed to the rich. A man should know that his riches should not be a source of shame, he must ensure that he touches the lives of the poor and weak around him. To be continued by usman malgwi

Women or our mummies tend to be stronger than men to some areas, I must say a very busy man was to swap for a week to take up the function of his wife &quot;at stay at home mother&quot;, after 2 days he actually conceded and said to his wife how do you do these things, make breakfast, dress the children for school, do daily laundries, arrange the children's room, clean the house, take care of baby mary the new born, sweep, scrub and do the toilets clean up. On top of that go shopping   
<br /><br />&quot;the hands that rocks the cradle and then the hands that rocks the cradle rules the world&quot;
<br /><br />No one can actually do justice to write about his or her mother explicitly and not say that mothers value of importance can't be over emphasised, we were incubated in their wombs, shared their food with us and when we finally come out another phase begins. Somehow mummies experience a kind of multi tasking nature way before it was called multi tasking, you did the laundry, cooked and bathed me with an unfailing love. Can we ever repay what our mothers do to us, it is priceless and eternal that we owe a lot of our success to their influence.  By usman malgwi

The dream of any individual is to secure a safe and stable source of income and one way of achieving that is by creating more channels of income.  
<br /><br />&quot;A wise man creates more opportunity than he finds&quot;
<br /><br />It is very important that you create multiple streams of income for yourself is an over song truth but how do you go about doing that I mean I am saying this to people who are too dependent on their salaries or wages, to depend on one source only is unwise. I mean even commons sense will drive a man to seek other available sources of income, this common sense is borrowed from the principle of investment that encourages diversification of investment. 
<br /><br />But for you to do this there is a challenge that you have to face one true fact how much are you capable of setting aside as savings. The truth is this if you don't diversify your income then you are at treat of falling into abject poverty of eating hand to mouth. We see that everyday, but soe people will complain and say that the money is so small or meagre but does it mean that nothing can be saved I endeavour you to look at your life style or habits of spending, i agree that things are hard financially but we can still do somethings at least since it pertains to our financial future.

But we all had views as we were growing up but somehow the view from time to time can be debunked proved right or wrong by the very harsh realities of life. Let me give you an instance as a kid our mouth use to run over with I want to be a pilot, a engineer, an architect, a sailor I mean it cuts across every prestigious professional field but as we grow up life gives us some very hard knocks and we have to adjust our ambitions. 
<br /><br />&quot;When it seems the goal is not going to be achieved don't adjust the goal adjust your pace&quot; 
<br /><br />But somehow are we grew up we had to adjust to life realities not that our aspirations was not achieveable but there was an extra cost hinged on a lot of factors outside our control, and this may elicit a series off reactions that may be, giving up your dreams, re assessing your dreams,  replacing it, become complacent or simply altering yourself to the situation positively or negatively. Your view of any situation is the most important point here not the situation it self, so the next step is to align your dreams to your abilities, you can not succeed in a dream of yours without the talent needed you will become volatile. We all have different aptitudes and all we have to do is align our dreams to our talents simple. By usman malgwi

I am the very last person to comment about parenting because I have a long way to go and a lot to learn but at least you would not find fault when you want to see things or express your comments on parenting. 
<br />I would like to be gin with the dynamics before the structure of parenting and no other way can you do that except by studying my parents
<br /><br />Ok I grew up in a family of 7 and to sincere I got the lucky spot that is the 7 and I must tell you it is a good thing since you will be able to get off any error you make because no one will tell me; &quot;are you setting a good example for your juniors&quot; that has never happened it is like you are above the family constitution and to be honest you get a lot of pampering but in fact in time I came to know that it was almost the same thing like being a teddy bear toy, they play with you for therapy for them and me I do the jokes they laughed I mean it was what I would call one big family. 
<br /><br />What I liked the most that it was not a circus but there was order, and we all had our roles to play respecting our elders going on errands and behaving well when visitors came around. There was some memories I hold dear timeless family moments like watching soap opera's, like &quot;checkmate&quot; mexican soaps I mean the eighties was a good time to be born in, I had a big head this gave me the advantage of remembering things I should have forgotten. But from my earliest memories I know my daddy once spanked my but when I was 5 years old for rebellion, I got a gift of 50kobo note new crispy note and then when I asked for it later he gave me a tattered 50note right before him I tore the not before him, now that was the last straw that broke the camels back.
<br /><br />&quot;Don't spear the rod&quot;
<br /><br />The family protects it's own, any secrets about any family will be guarded by all because you will be directly or indirectly affect you so some secrets stays in the family. No matter what happens there should be patriotism we protect each other in a fanatical way and this is the best I think.
<br /><br />&quot;The family protects his own&quot; 
<br /><br />Every member in the family is a team player he has a role no matter how small it becomes highly significant in a family. The reason for team play is because we all have weaknesses and strengths, so from time to time there is a point in time where by we protect each others weaknesses and augment or amplify the strength. I must say &quot;unrivalled&quot; support.
<br /><br />&quot;For two to work together there must be an agreement&quot; 
<br /><br />This is the point I call bonding, or consolidation where by a member of the family is given or gets an emotional connection with ourselves, let me put it like this, we cry more over the loss of a loved one than an outersider to be continued by usman malgwi

I had an interesting conversation with a business man who gave me a unique insight about the ominous cloud hanging around this great country. 
<br /><br />He said that a community have a say on something, it is not the leaders that says everything but when a community say that they don't want something that is the day it ends because nothing happens without the community's consent, and it can't stop unless the community acts it is that simple. When a community is faced by a general problem and then they rise up and say no to something that is the day it ends take it or leave it, this is a fact. There is no communal effort on the part of the members of any society! How can something happen of such a large scale and duration without 3 to 9 people living in the society and they don't know it is impossible and preposterous to even presume
<br /><br />We are taking this things lightly, I mean the fact that we are not trying to put this problem behind us, of preventing anything that may be a stumbling block towards our general or common good. For example when you look at the case of the aba women's riot that is a point in time when there was a unified communal action until we nigerians join hands to fight all that is misfortune that befell us we have to stand up and make it happen, even notfor us but for the future of nigeria and nigerians. No american, british or russian that will come and do this for us we are the one to effect that change. People just talk me I talk and I act I will begin the change from myself, from my home from my family and from my state if you believe that you know nigeria is blessed, make a decision today.

Winner is a noun and winning is an adjective, if you want to be a winner take your hands out of your pocket and do things that you will exceed other people's expectation. Without losing you would never know the joy of winning.
<br /><br />&quot;We are more than conquereous through him that loved us&quot;- bible
<br /><br />Now a winner is not someone who has never failed but it is someone who refused to stay on the floor just because he failed. He is that person who can say taking another chance won't hurt that much, you may encounter failure but you have not failed, winning is not just about success or accomplishments only but also of the journey, as long as you are in the right path the rate you are moving at doesn't really matter much. 
<br /><br />&quot;Celebrate small victories&quot;
<br /><br />You are a winner as long as you don't concede to defeat or failure in anyway but I think winners and people who fail tend to look at failing differently, in fact sometimes failing tends to motivate winners when they fail they try and try again until they win. I mean this over used example doesn't have a substitute for me about Mr edison, he counts his failures as ways not to make a light bulb. Some see goofing 3 times to whatever times as a sign of incompetence but it is not so, it is just that you are learning things the other way round. To win is not a one sided approach there are some points that are beyond your control not that they would prevent you but will only cost you more time to do it.
<br /><br />&quot;Winning is not everything, but wanting to win is. - Vince Lombardi

I remembered during the time of president Gowon, then oil was struck that changed the fortune of this country to be among one of the big players in crude oil production. This made the country flood with petrodollars and investments and nigeria was rich beyond its expectations. 
<br /><br />If nigeria is termed rich even though extreme poverty is at about 70% in a country of 140,000000 million people with a negligible amount of middle class this will makes such an assumption correct. I have seen a situation where by a girl used 20naira to shop for lunch at the local vegetable dispensers, people 20naira is like 50cents or less, but we are still surviving but for how long. The coffers of the nation happens to be one presidents account where by he withdraw at his whims and crapices.  
<br /><br />When are we going to enjoy free education, free health care and stable power or energy even though it is a surmountable problems and why do we have to pay more to buy petroleum products that we are blessed with, when will we see honesty,  and integrity in this nation from our leadership. Where is the patriotism inside of us, let us demand much from ourselves let this be a new dawn for every nigerian for a day of glory and honour amongst other nations. To be continued by usman malgwi
