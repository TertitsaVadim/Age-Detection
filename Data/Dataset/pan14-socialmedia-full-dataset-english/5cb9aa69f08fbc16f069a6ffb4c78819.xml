While the term pop art was coined in Britain, somewhere in the 1950s, artists from America took to the cause with a lot of enthusiasm. As a result, this movement ushered in a global change in the way people perceived art across many parts of the world. The main factors governing it were,<br /><br />Reaction to Abstract Expressionism<br />When the culture of abstract art began, many artists felt that it did not relate to the recent. The <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.personal-art.me.uk"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.personal-art.me.uk</a> movement, thus began, as a direct reaction to the culture of abstract expressionism. Where abstract art was more surreal and spontaneous in nature, pop art was more planned and relevant to current times.<br /><br />Reaction to traditional art<br />Another distinguishing feature of this movement was that it challenged almost every element of the high-brow art society of those times. It defined that for art to be acceptable across classes, it had to communicate with people and their issues. Elements like street art connected to people and artists like Lichtenstein and Warhol spearheaded the pop art movement with their own unique styles. Also it challenged the premises that art had to be original and could not be reproduced.<br /><br />Reach to a wider audience<br />To make this more accessible to people, artists turned to techniques that could help them reproduce elements or complete pictures quickly and effectively. Stenciling was one element that helped them achieve this. Over time, many other commercial ways of production were devised, ensuring that unlimited copies of art could easily be made. Objects of mass culture like advertisements, popular brands and comic books were soon integrated with art, making them more acceptable to people.<br /><br />The effect of consumerism<br />The movement began after the end of the World War II. People had more money to spend, and thus began an era of consumerism. Objects of mass culture like advertisements, brand awareness and comic books soon became popular. And all this translated itself into the art form, making it more acceptable and also more affordable. People took to it as birds taking to air. <br /><br />Many artists, low threshold levels<br />For any movement to be successful, the participants in it should be high, while the threshold levels of acceptance, should be low. This movement was blessed with these two elements. The time, place, people and price were right. Many pop art artists participated in the movement, many people liked the art form and with it being affordably priced, it soon became popular. This holds true even today, and the art continues to enjoy a good audience who are ready for new styles that keep emerging with time. New styles evolve faster in popart, giving the audience something fresh and novel all the time. And the Internet ensures easy transmission of these art styles.<br /><br />Today, you can order art online, right from the comfort of your chair. There are sites offering reproductions or personalized variations just for you. While buying online, remember to exercise prudence. Check the quality of the artwork, the reputation of the seller and compare prices and quality, before picking up one for yourself.
