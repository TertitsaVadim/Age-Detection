<br />Joe Rizza Acura is the neighborhood’s most trusted car dealership as the recipient of the highest award for Acura that a dealership can receive, Dealership of Distinction, as well as of the Council of Excellence award and the Acura Client Excellence award.
<br /><br />Joe Rizza Acura, Chicagoland Acura dealer, is proud to announce that it has been awarded Acura’s most prestigious honor, having been named a Dealership of Distinction for 2011. Acura established the Dealership of Distinction award in 1991 to recognize Acura dealerships that exemplify the core values of the brand. Each year, the objectives are modified to continually challenge dealerships to excel in all areas of operation. A major component of the program focuses on the client experience and is measured via client satisfaction surveys.
<br /><br />Earning Dealership of Distinction status is a yearlong process and each and every member of the Joe Rizza Acura team committed to providing the best in Acura Sales and Service that they could for each and every customer they interacted with. Those at Joe Rizza Acura are honored to receive this award and thank their loyal customers for helping to achieve such prestigious recognition for Joe Rizza Acura’s hard work.
<br /><br />The Council of Excellence has been awarded to Joe Rizza Acura seven years in a row for 2011. This award takes into account categories that measure a dealership’s willingness to understand and suit a customer’s needs and financial situation. This is an award given to only 15% of all U.S. dealerships. There is no better place to go for a new car than a dealership honored with such prestigious awards, especially with awards geared toward customer satisfaction.
<br /><br />For the past four years, Joe Rizza Acura has also been recognized as one of the top 173 Acura dealers to receive the customer satisfaction driven ACE (Acura Client Excellence) parts and service professionals’ award.
<br /><br />“Acura came out with special financing and low interest - $2500 rebate and 1.9%. That was the clincher. I asked for verification on cost and interest, which were confirmed by the manager, Pat. I got a very nice deal! It was a pleasant experience overall, from the staff being helpful and friendly and no pressure to buy. If you’re looking for a new car, I recommend stopping by here. I am very happy with my purchase and service received,” says Don M, satisfied customer.

<br />Dormont Borough released the employment contract Tuesday for former borough manager Gino Rizza, and council President Bill McCartney offered an explanation for the terms of Rizza’s settlement agreement, which was released earlier this month. The employment contract is attached here as a PDF file. McCartney said that although there’s no record of the employment contract being discussed during a council meeting, council did approve the manager’s salary at a public meeting in 2009. Section III B of the employment contract states: Commencing January 1, 2010, and each successive January 1 in which this agreement is in force, any increase in salary will be based on the approved budget. In the 2010 and 2011 budgets, McCartney said, $75,000 was budgeted for the borough manager. However, Rizza was paid less than that amount, as shown by the 2011 adopted budget, available on the borough website's homepage. “When the decision was made to move forward with him leaving, five of the council members, the mayor and the solicitor read the contract to mean that he needed that pay,” MacCartney said. The employment contract was signed by Rizza, former solicitor Deron Gabriel, and then council President John Maggio. Borough secretary Vickie McGurk was a witness to the signatures, but not to the creation of the contract.

<br /><br />Reporting from Washington-
<br />A top senator, angry that Facebook Inc. failed to quit millions of preteens from making use of its social networking internet site, accused co-founder Mark Zuckerberg of lacking “social values” and becoming far more concerned with creating the firm than with children’s privacy.
<br />“It really is my common feeling that folks who are 20, 21, 22 years old actually don’t have any social values at this point,” Senate Commerce Committee Chairman John D. Rockefeller IV (D-W.Va.) told one more top Facebook executive at a hearing Thursday.
<br />“I feel he was focused on how the organization model would function,” Rockefeller stated about Zuckerberg, who was a 19-year-old Harvard student when he designed Facebook in 2004. “He wanted to make it bigger and faster and greater than anybody else ever had.”
<br />The company’s policy calls for users to be at least 13, a move developed to steer clear of federal regulations for sites employed by young children. But a current Consumer Reports survey identified that about 7.5 million active Facebook users were younger than 13.
<br />Rockefeller’s comments came as a Facebook executive for the initial time came below congressional quizzing in a current round of hearings about concerns that technologies businesses are not protecting individual privacy. Executives from Apple Inc. and Google Inc., which sent witnesses to a hearing last week, also appeared at Thursday’s hearing before a Commerce subcommittee.
<br />Rockefeller, a crucial player on technology concerns, and other lawmakers are thinking about new regulations to defend on-line privacy, particularly for children. The problem has gained momentum with the current revelation that an obscure file on iPhones and iPads could shop thousands of detailed records of a user’s whereabouts.
<br />Rockefeller mentioned he was lately told by Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg that the firm has only 100 people monitoring the posts and other activities of about 600 million users.
<br />“My reaction to that is that is just definitely indefensible,” Rockefeller told Facebook Chief Technology Officer Bret Taylor, saying he was worried about kids getting targeted by sexual predators and on-line bullies. “I want you to defend your business here since I do not know how you can.”
<br />Taylor stated Facebook shuts down the accounts of people found to be lying about their age to stay away from the company’s restriction.
<br />“We do not allow people to misrepresent their age,” Taylor said.
<br />But he admitted Facebook depended on other users to report such violations to enforce the policy.
<br />The under-age dilemma at Facebook showed that massive technology organizations have not made privacy a top priority, stated Amy Guggenheim Shenkan, president of Common Sense Media, a nonprofit kids and family advocacy group.
<br />Such hugely effective innovators should be in a position to generate approaches to better shield children’s privacy, Shenkan said. She then took a swipe at Facebook for hiring a high-powered public-relations firm to push news organizations to write unfavorable stories about privacy concerns at Google.
<br />“Instead of spending funds to – employ PR firms to try and take down the other organization, let’s take that money and devote it on figuring out technological techniques that will shield our youngsters,” she told the subcommittee. “It cannot be 100 individuals sitting in a Facebook office trying to monitor 600 million conversations.”

<br />As financial advisors and investment consultants, we believe in the following fundamental principals with regard to designing an investment portfolio and making specific recommendations. The purpose of a client's investment portfolio is to fund current and/or future financial objectives. The design of the portfolio must take into account the client's financial objectives, tolerance for risk, needs for current income or liquidity, and special considerations such as income and estate taxes. The appropriate allocation of investment assets for your goals and risk tolerance is the most important component in developing an investment portfolio. We believe that having a diversified, well-balanced portfolio, following long-term buy-and-hold strategies, and having patience, increases the likelihood that one will achieve their long-term financial objectives.
<br />Diversification, dollar cost averaging, comprehensive portfolio reviews and analysis are beneficial methods of managing assets. Dollar-cost averaging has some advantages in a declining market--or, more precisely, in a market whose general direction may be downward but still has ups and downs. An investor who bought the Dow in 1929 and held it until 1939 would have seen a -46% return; but an investor dollar-cost averaging would have been able to take advantage, for example, of all the months in 1932-1934 in which the Dow closed at less than 100. In these months, that investor would have gotten a lot more for his money. This effect adds up to a nominal return of 5% during the period for the dollar-cost average method, which compared favorably to bond interest rates over the same period.
<br />We believe that low cost mutual funds that consistently perform above average against their peers are wise choices. We also recognize the importance of culling a portfolio from time to time. How do you create this personal financial plan? What makes Brightbridge different is our commitment to working jointly with clients to produce a comprehensive, custom financial plan, enabling them to make wiser financial choices. First we focus on your goals, objectives, priorities and values.
<br />For instance, the reduction of current and future income taxes may be an immediate goal, funding a quality education for your children and/or grandchildren may be an intermediate goal, and enjoying a secure financial future in your retirement years is likely to be one of your most important long-term goals. Another goal in life for some people is creating wealth and/or leaving a legacy for your chosen beneficiaries or charities. You may already be on the road to meeting these objectives and simply need a new strategy, professional insight, or to fine-tune your plan. You may just be starting out, or you may be somewhere in between.
<br />Next, we collect detailed personal financial information and make a thorough analysis of this information: current financial situation, employee benefits, children's educational funding, retirement situation, pension and retirement plans, living estate, insurance and investment portfolios to produce a written financial plan with specific recommendations to achieve your goals. Then, we share the results with the client, who determines if the recommendations are sensible and reasonable. Once comfortable and satisfied with the final recommendations, clients take action or direct us to take the steps necessary to attain their objectives. Finally, to achieve the intended results, you must implement and monitor your plan. Your financial plan is a living document, reviewed periodically for progress and adjusted appropriately. Whatever your unique situation may be, everyone needs a periodic assessment of where they are on the road to meeting their financial goals. As a Fee-Based certified financial planner, we work with people based on their preferences and needs. Some may want a second opinion or help on a specific situation. Others would like more comprehensive, coordinated financial advice.

<br /><br />Bark &amp; Co has developed a formidable reputation in the area of serious crime. Over the past few years, criminal work has expanded and diversified, whilst remaining at the top end in terms of quality and complexity. Current cases range from complex murder and drug crimes to the sale of false identity documents involving anti-terrorism forces in UK and around the world.
<br /><br />Bark &amp; Co have forged a particular niche in ‘cold cases’ relating to what we believe had become an over reliance by prosecutors on evidence from unreliable ‘supergrasses’.  Similarly, we have been at the forefront in defending a high-profile case testing the application of new rules on hearsay evidence. As an example of the extremely sensitive and diverse nature of our criminal work, Bark &amp; Co were brought in to act in criminal cases involving occupying forces in Iraq.
<br /><br />Amongst other recent high profile matters we are involved with several murder cases, in one of which we made a successful application to have the principal ‘supergrass’s evidence excluded. We also raised pertinent questions about police conduct during the investigation in relation to this evidence.
<br /><br />We have just received instructions in one of the biggest drug smuggling multi-jurisdictional cases stretching from Columbia via the Caribbean to Europe. This involved high grade cocaine worth hundreds of millions of pounds on the streets of London and money laundering.
<br /><br />Our successes at Bark &amp; Co are characterised by our detailed research and analysis which enable us to challenge customary practice and regulations and find the best possible outcome for our clients.

<br /><br />Insider trading is a form of ‘market abuse’ and includes the misuse of information whilst trading investments in the UK markets. The Financial Services Authority (FSA) has wide ranging powers to take action against anyone suspected of market abuse or whose conduct falls below acceptable standards.
<br /><br />In many cases, the nature of trading investments in the markets attracts FSA interest where no intention exists to misuse information or manipulate the market. But, after years of adverse publicity for not tackling market abuse head on, the FSA is becoming much tougher.
<br /><br />Our team at Bark &amp;amp; Co are very well acquainted with the regulatory regime designed to ensure compliance and to maintain high standards of market conduct. Amongst a number of defence cases involving our team, one has been described as ‘the biggest insider dealing case ever launched by the UK FSA’, a case which has ‘sent shockwaves through the country’s financial industry’. In another highly complex case, our clients are being investigated by HM Revenue and Customs to establish whether a significant shareholding had been manipulated for tax purposes. In a third, we are representing one of a number of individuals in an insider ring who allegedly had knowledge of impending company takeovers and acted to benefit substantially from confidential information.
<br /><br />As one of the most prominent fraud firms in the City of London, Bark &amp;amp; Co are well placed to provide the best advice to clients who find themselves the subject of FSA investigations into money laundering.
