And the fundamentals are still in place for another decade of gold and silver.Governments around the world are buried in debt. There aren’t many ways out of the debt either.They can cut spending. That’s politically unpopular. So it’s not likely going to happen soon either. But if it did, the cuts would not be deep enough.They can hike taxes to pay down all of the debt. That’s not politically feasible solution either in most cases.  And tax increases rarely produce enough revenue and many times have made matters worse by sparking larger economic declines.
