Central <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL29uZWhvdXJhaXJjb25kaXRpb25pbmdkdXJoYW0uY29tLw__" target="_blank"><strong>heating and cooling systems</strong></a> are more prone to failure as they stand the extreme weather conditions. This is the reason, an expert technician is always needed in order to repair, maintain, diagnose, as well as correct the severe problems throughout the system.
<br /><br />Experienced plumbers and HVAC technicians offer comprehensive services for:
<br /><br />1. Compressors
<br />   2. Evaporator Coils
<br /><br />Compressors
<br /><br />In AC units, the compressor is the prime component and serves big functions. Its main function is to squeeze the refrigerant that comes to the compressor as a cool and low-pressure gas. The compressor in turn envelops the molecules of the fluid close together. The process of squeezing of molecules together enhances its underlying energy as well as temperature and the working fluid leaves the compressor as a hot and high-pressure gas.
<br /><br /><span class="textAlign textAlignCenter"><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/178383882_16639934_46301157.jpg" /></span>
