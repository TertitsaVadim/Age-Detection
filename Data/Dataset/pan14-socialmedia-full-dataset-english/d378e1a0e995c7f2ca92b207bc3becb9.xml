<br />&quot;Try not to lose you.&quot;
<br />Two vibrant hearts could change.
<br />Nothing tears the pain more than deception, 
<br />unmasked fear.
<br />&quot;I'll be here waiting&quot; tested and secure.
<br /><br />Nothing hurts my world,
<br />just affects the ones around me.
<br />When sin's deep in my blood,
<br />you'll be the one to fall.
<br /><br />&quot;I wish I could be the one,
<br />the one who won't care at all.
<br />But being the one on the stand,
<br />I know the way to go, no one's guiding me.
<br />When time soaked with blood turns its back,
<br />I know it's hard to fall.
<br />Confided in me was your heart.
<br />I know it's hurting you, but it's killing me.&quot;
<br /><br />Nothing will last in this life
<br />our time is spent constructing,
<br />now you're perfecting a world... meant to sin.
<br />Constrict your hands around me,
<br />squeeze till I cannot breathe,
<br />this air tastes dead inside me,
<br />contribute to our plague.
<br />Break all your promises,
<br />tear down this steadfast wall,
<br />restraints are useless here,
<br />tasting salvation's near.
<br /><br />AH
<br /><br />Nothing hurts my world,
<br />just affects the ones around me

<br />you'll be the one to fall.

<br /><br />Can't you see that I'm sick of this?
<br />Chances are you're oblivious to how I feel
<br />Sitting on your throne, and I'm sure that I'm not alone,
<br />Not alone, not alone.
<br /><br />Tell me please,
<br />Who the fuck did you want me to be?
<br />Was it something that I couldn't see?
<br />Never knew this would be so political.
<br />And please, I'm still wearing this miserable skin
<br />And it's starting to tear from within
<br />But it's obvious that doesn't bother you, so please
<br /><br />I didn't think that you'd sell me out
<br />Now I know what you're all about.
<br />You might feel in control of things.
<br />But you're not holding all the strings.
<br />All the strings, all the strings.
<br /><br />Tell me please,
<br />Who the fuck did you want me to be?
<br />Was it something that I couldn't see?
<br />Never knew this would be so political.
<br />And please, I'm still wearing this miserable skin
<br />And it's starting to tear from within
<br />But it's obvious that doesn't matter to you,
<br />So please
<br /><br />I've swallowed all your answers
<br />I've swallowed all my pride
<br />You've used up all your chances
<br />Can't keep this all inside
<br /><br />Tell me please,
<br />Who the fuck did you want me to be?
<br />Was it something that I couldn't see?
<br />Never knew this would be so political.
<br />And please, I'm still wearing this miserable skin
<br />And it's starting to tear from within
<br />But it's obvious that doesn't bother you
<br /><br />So please don't keep telling me that it's ok
<br />I don't buy all the shit that you say
<br />And quite honestly I'm fucking sick of it
<br />so please if I cut off this nose from my face
<br />Then I wouldn't feel so out of place
<br />But it still wouldn't be quite enough for you,
<br />so please.

<br /><br />in a forrest pitch-dark
<br />glowed the tiniest spark
<br />it burst into flame
<br />like me
<br />like me
<br /><br />my name isobel 
<br />married to myself
<br />my love isobel
<br />living by herself
<br /><br />in a heart full of dust
<br />lives a creature called lust
<br />it surprises and scares
<br />like me
<br />like me
<br /><br />my name isobel 
<br />married to myself
<br />my love isobel
<br />living by herself
<br /><br />when she does it she means to
<br />moth delivers her message
<br />unexplaind on your collar
<br />crawling in silence
<br />a simple excuse
<br /><br />nana na nana
<br />nana na nana
<br /><br />in a tower of steel
<br />nature forges a deal
<br />to raise wonderful hell
<br />like me
<br />like me
<br /><br />my name isobel 
<br />married to myself
<br />my love isobel
<br />living by herself
<br /><br />when she does it she means to
<br />moth delivers her message
<br />unexplaind on your collar
<br />crawling in silence
<br />a simple excuse
<br /><br />nana na nana
<br />nana na nana
<br />nana na nana
<br />nana na nana

<br /><br />Metaphor for a missing moment
<br />Pull me into your perfect circle
<br /><br />One womb
<br />One shape
<br />One resolve
<br /><br />Liberate this will
<br />To release us all
<br /><br />Gotta cut away, clear away
<br />Snip away and sever this
<br />Umbilical residue that's
<br />Keeping me from killing you
<br /><br />And from pulling you down with me in here
<br />I can almost hear you scream
<br /><br />Give me
<br />One more medicated peaceful moment
<br />One more medicated peaceful moment
<br /><br />And I don't wanna feel this overwhelming
<br />Hostility
<br />Because I don't wanna feel this overwhelming
<br />Hostility
<br /><br />Gotta cut away Clear away
<br />Snip away and sever this
<br />Umbilical residue
<br />Gotta cut away Clear away
<br />Snip away and sever this
<br />Umbilical residue that's
<br />Keeping me from killing you
<br />Keeping me from killing you
