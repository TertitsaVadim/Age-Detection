<br /><br />When I see that last leaf...I think of you.
<br />....don't drift away.... will you???
<br /><br />Falling Leaves
<br /><br />I was thinking of old friends today
<br /><br />and how many of them have slipped away.
<br /><br />Moved, got married, or stopped calling so much,
<br /><br />Found new friends, got busy, and just lost touch.
<br /><br />It reminded me of falling leaves .
<br /><br />Every autumn the leaves fall from the trees.
<br /><br />Some stay longer than others, but eventually -
<br /><br />Each leaf must fall, I'm told,
<br /><br />leaving the tree alone to face the cold.
<br /><br />Why is it that in the time of utmost need
<br /><br />the leaves would seek to leave the tree?
<br /><br />And when we need our friends around
<br /><br />we look and they cannot be found?
<br /><br />Of course these friendships come and go
<br /><br />and in the spring new leaves will grow.
<br /><br />But I prefer autumn friends of old
<br /><br />with crackling laughter and colors bold.
<br /><br />And then I thought of you.
<br /><br />That one stubborn leaf that won't let go.
<br /><br />That clings despite the winds that blow.
<br /><br />Fighting ice, and snow, and winter's stings
<br /><br />Hanging on right through till spring.
<br /><br />So I guess that's what you are to me -
<br /><br />The very last leaf to leave the tree.
<br /><br />I know it seems silly, but it's true.
<br /><br />When I see that last leaf...I think of you.
<br />....don't drift away.... will you???

<br /><strong>
<br />I wish you'd see
<br /><br />just how much you mean to me.
<br /><br />Because even when we fight
<br /><br />I know things will turn out all right.
<br /><br />When I need you, you're there in a hurry,
<br /><br />when I'm down, I never have to worry.
<br /><br />I'm sure some things I say or do are wrong,
<br /><br />but our friendship will remain strong.
<br /><br />I'm there for you, and you're there for me.
<br /><br />We're exactly what friends should be.
<br /><br />During my sometimes hectic and busy day,
<br /><br />I either forget or can't find the words to say.
<br /><br />Just how very much you mean to me,
<br /><br />and how sad life without you would be.
<br /><br />So just so you know without a doubt,
<br /><br />I love you and you are all I care about.

<br /><br />Indian Economy has covered a long ground since it was liberalized in 1991. Today, India has the fourth largest economy in terms of purchasing power parity (PPP) behind only the USA, China, and Japan. It is slated to overtake Japan and become the third major economic power in the next ten years. India is also one of the few markets in the world which offers high prospects for growth and earning potential in practically all areas of business. Indian economic growth has been among the fastest in the world in the recent years.
<br /><br />India was a highly protected, semi-socialist autarkic economy till 1991. There were numerous structural and bureaucratic impediments in setting up a new business and foreign investment was not welcomed. The opening up of the Indian economy in 1991, unleashed the latent entrepreneurial talent of the Indian and in less than two decades India has established itself as the next economic superpower of the world.
<br /><br />Indian Economy grew at an annual average growth of 7.6 per cent during the Tenth Plan and has set a target of 9 per cent for the Eleventh Five Year Plan. One of the landmark structural changes achieved by Indian economy is that today services sector contributes more than 50% of India's GDP, which is a general characteristic of any developed economy. For the financial year 2006-07, the share of services, industry, and agriculture in India's GDP was 55.1 per cent, 26.4 per cent, and 18.5 per cent respectively.
<br /><br />One of the notable features of economic growth in India is the sharp rise in the rate of investment in the economy. Investment, in general being a forward looking variable, reflects a high degree of business optimism. The sharp increase in investment rate has sustained the industrial performance and reinforces the outlook for growth.
<br /><br />The rapid economic growth of the last few years has put heavy stress on India's infrastructural facilities. The shortage on infrastructure front such as power shortfall, port traffic capacity mismatch, poor road conditions, and low telephone penetration threaten to derail Indian success story. Apart from addressing the above problems some other steps such as labour reforms and administrative reforms need to be taken urgently if we have to sustain higher levels of economic growth. The government also needs to ensure that the economic growth is equitable as lopsided economic growth may result in social unrest and may undo all the good work achieved as a result of economic reforms.

<br />Endangered 
<br />     Never very abundant, the whooping crane suffered in the late 1800s from indiscriminate shooting, habitat disturbance, and the draining of the large, isolated marshes that it frequented. In 1941 there were only 21 wild birds and two captives remaining. Today there are 300 whooping cranes in the world. The species is still on the endangered list and is carefully monitored. 
<br />     Total legal protection, public interest, protected breeding grounds in Canada and wintering grounds in the United States, along with artificial incubation, foster parenting by sandhill cranes and the establishment of an additional breeding flock in Idaho, have all helped in rescuing the whooping crane from extinction.

<br /><br />Published on 8/25/2007
<br /><br />From the Quagga --half zebra, half horse-- to the Irish Deer --the largest deer that ever lived--, an impressive list with pictures of amazing animals we will never see.
<br /><br />Tyrannosaurus Rex (extinct 65 million years ago) [Wiki]
<br />Tyrannosaurus rex was one of the largest land carnivores of all time, measuring up to 43.3 feet long, and 16.6 ft tall, with an estimated mass that goes up to 7 tons. Like other tyrannosaurids, Tyrannosaurus was a bipedal carnivore with a massive skull balanced by a long, heavy tail. Relative to the large and powerful hindlimbs, Tyrannosaurus forelimbs were small and they retained only two digits.
<br /><br />Fossils of T. rex have been found in North American rock formations dating to the last three million years of the Cretaceous Period at the end of the Maastrichtian stage, approximately 68.5 to 65.5 million years ago; it was among the last dinosaurs to exist prior to the Cretaceous-Tertiary extinction event. More than 30 specimens of T. rex have been identified, some of which are nearly complete skeletons. Some researchers have discovered soft tissue as well. The abundance of fossil material has allowed significant research into many aspects of its biology, including life history and biomechanics.
<br /><br />Quagga: half zebra, half horse (extinct since 1883) [Wiki]
<br />One of Africa's most famous extinct animals, the quagga was a subspecies of the plains zebra, which was once found in great numbers in South Africa's Cape Province and the southern part of the Orange Free State. It was distinguished from other zebras by having the usual vivid marks on the front part of the body only. In the mid-section, the stripes faded and the dark, inter-stripe spaces became wider, and the hindquarters were a plain brown. The name comes from a Khoikhoi word for zebra and is onomatopoeic, being said to resemble the quagga's call.
<br /><br />The quagga was originally classified as an individual species, Equus quagga, in 1788. Over the next fifty years or so, many other zebras were described by naturalists and explorers. Because of the great variation in coat patterns (no two zebras are alike), taxonomists were left with a great number of described &quot;species&quot;, and no easy way to tell which of these were true species, which were subspecies, and which were simply natural variants. Long before this confusion was sorted out, the quagga had been hunted to extinction for meat, hides, and to preserve feed for domesticated stock. The last wild quagga was probably shot in the late 1870s, and the last specimen in captivity died on August 12, 1883 at the Artis Magistra zoo in Amsterdam.
<br /><br />Because of the great confusion between different zebra species, particularly among the general public, the quagga had become extinct before it was realized that it appeared to be a separate species. The quagga was the first extinct creature to have its DNA studied. Recent genetic research at the Smithsonian Institution has demonstrated that the quagga was in fact not a separate species at all, but diverged from the extremely variable plains zebra.
<br /><br />Thylacine: the Tasmanian Tiger (extinct since 1936) [Wiki]
<br />The Thylacine was the largest known carnivorous marsupial of modern times. Native to Australia and New Guinea, it is thought to have become extinct in the 20th century. It is commonly known as the Tasmanian Tiger (due to its striped back), and also known as the Tasmanian Wolf, and colloquially the Tassie (or Tazzy) Tiger or simply the Tiger. It was the last extant member of its genus, Thylacinus, although a number of related species have been found in the fossil record dating back to the early Miocene.
<br /><br />The Thylacine became extinct on the Australian mainland thousands of years before European settlement of the continent, but survived on the island of Tasmania along with a number of other endemic species such as the Tasmanian Devil. Intensive hunting encouraged by bounties is generally blamed for its extinction, but other contributory factors may have been disease, the introduction of dogs, and human encroachment into its habitat. Despite being officially classified as extinct, sightings are still reported.
<br /><br />Steller's Sea Cow: the defenseless beast (extinct since 1768) [Wiki]
<br />Formerly found near the Asiatic coast of the Bering Sea, it was discovered in in 1741 by the naturalist Georg Steller, who was traveling with the explorer Vitus Bering. The sea cow grew up to 7.9 meters (25.9 ft) long and weighed up to three tons, much larger than the manatee or dugong. It looked somewhat like a large seal, but had two stout forelimbs and a whale-like tail. According to Steller, &quot;The animal never comes out on shore, but always lives in the water. Its skin is black and thick, like the bark of an old oak..., its head in proportion to the body is small..., it has no teeth, but only two flat white bones—one above, the other below&quot;. It was completely tame, according to Steller. Fossils indicate that Steller's Sea Cow was formerly widespread along the North Pacific coast, reaching south to Japan and California. Given the rapidity with which its last population was eliminated, it is likely that the arrival of humans in the area was the cause of its extinction elsewhere as well. There are still sporadic reports of sea cow-like animals from the Bering area and Greenland, so it has been suggested that small populations of the animal may have survived to the present day. This remains so far unproven.
<br /><br />Irish Deer: the largest deer that ever lived (extinct about 7,700 years ago) [Wiki]
<br />The Irish Elk or Giant Deer, was the largest deer that ever lived. It lived in Eurasia, from Ireland to east of Lake Baikal, during the Late Pleistocene and early Holocene. The latest known remains of the species have been carbon dated to about 5,700 BC, or about 7,700 years ago. The Giant Deer is famous for its formidable size (about 2.1 meters or 7 feet tall at the shoulders), and in particular for having the largest antlers of any known cervid (a maximum of 3.65 meters/12 feet from tip to tip and weighing up to 90 pounds).
<br /><br />Discussion of the cause of their extinction has still focused on the antlers (rather than on their overall body size), which may be due more to their impact on the observer than any actual property. Some have suggested hunting by man was a contributing factor in the demise of the Irish Elk as it was with many prehistoric megafauna, even assuming that the large antler size restricted the movement of males through forested regions or that it was by some other means a &quot;maladaptation&quot;. But evidence for overhunting is equivocal, and as a continental species, it would have co-evolved with humans throughout its existence and presumably have adapted to their presence.
<br /><br />Caspian Tiger: the third largest (extinct since 1970) [Wiki]
<br />The Caspian tiger or Persian tiger was the westernmost subspecies of tiger, found in Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, Turkey, Mongolia, Kazakhstan, Caucasus, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan until it apparently became extinct in the 1970s. Of all the tigers known to the world, the Caspian tiger was the third largest.
<br /><br />The body of this subspecies was quite stocky and elongated with strong legs, big wide paws and unusually large claws. The ears were short and small, and gave the appearance of being without hair on the tips. Around the cheeks the Caspian tiger was generously furred and the rest of its fur was long and thick. The colouration resembled that of the Bengal tiger. Male Caspian tigers were very large and weighed 169-240 kg. Females were not as large, weighing 85-135 kg. There are still occasional claims of the Caspian tiger being sighted.
<br /><br />Aurochs: a very large type of cattle (extinct since 1627) [Wiki]
<br />One of Europe's most famous extinct animals, the aurochs or urus (Bos primigenius) were a very large type of cattle. Aurochs evolved in India some two million years ago, migrated into the Middle East and further into Asia, and reached Europe about 250,000 years ago.
<br /><br />By the 13th century A.D., the aurochs' range was restricted to Poland, Lithuania, Moldavia, Transylvania and East Prussia. The right to hunt large animals on any land was restricted to nobles and gradually to the royal household. As the population of aurochs declined, hunting ceased but the royal court still required gamekeepers to provide open fields for the aurochs to graze in. The gamekeepers were exempted from local taxes in exchange for their service and a decree made poaching an aurochs punishable by death. In 1564, the gamekeepers knew of only 38 animals, according to the royal survey. The last recorded live aurochs, a female, died in 1627 in the Jaktorów Forest, Poland. The skull was later taken by the Swedish Army and is now the property of Livrustkammaren in Stockholm.
<br /><br />In the 1920s two German zookeepers, the brothers Heinz and Lutz Heck, attempted to breed the aurochs back into existence (see breeding back) from the domestic cattle that were their descendants. Their plan was based on the conception that a species is not extinct as long as all its genes are still present in a living population. The result is the breed called Heck Cattle, 'Recreated Aurochs', or 'Heck Aurochs', which bears an incomplete resemblance to what is known about the physiology of the wild aurochs
<br /><br />Great Auk: largest of all auks (extinct since 1844) [Wiki]
<br />The Great Auk was the only species in the genus Pinguinus, flightless giant auks from the Atlantic, to survive until recent times, but is extinct today. It was also known as garefowl, or penguin.
<br /><br />Standing about 75 centimetres or 30-34 inches high and weighing around 5 kg, the flightless Great Auk was the largest of the auks. It had white and glossy black feathers. In the past, the Great Auk was found in great numbers on islands off eastern Canada, Greenland, Iceland, Norway, Ireland and Great Britain, but it was eventually hunted to extinction. Remains found in Floridan middens suggest that at least occasionally, birds ventured that far south in winter as recently as in the 14th century.
<br /><br />Cave Lion: one of the largest lions ever (extinct 2,000 years ago) [Wiki]
<br />The cave lion, also known as the European or Eurasian cave lion, is an extinct subspecies of lion known from fossils and a wide variety of prehistoric art. This subspecies was one of the largest lions. An adult male, which was found in 1985 near Siegsdorf (Germany), had a shoulder height of around 1.2 m and a length of 2.1 m without a tail, which is about the same size as a very big modern lion. This male was even exceeded by other specimens of this subspecies. Therefore this cat may have been around 5-10% bigger than modern lions. It apparently went extinct about 10,000 years ago, during the Würm glaciation, though there are some indications it may have existed as recently as 2,000 years ago, in the Balkans.
<br /><br />Dodo: the archetype of extinct species (extinct since late 17th century) [Wiki]
<br />The Dodo (Raphus cucullatus) was a flightless bird that lived on the island of Mauritius. Related to pigeons and doves, it stood about a meter tall (three feet), lived on fruit and nested on the ground. The dodo has been extinct since the mid-to-late 17th century. It is commonly used as the archetype of an extinct species because its extinction occurred during recorded human history, and was directly attributable to human activity. The adjective phrase &quot;as dead as a dodo&quot; means undoubtedly and unquestionably dead. The verb phrase &quot;to go the way of the dodo&quot; means to become extinct or obsolete, to fall out of common usage or practice, or to become a thing of the past.

Besides, it is believed that on this
<br />day, Shiva consumed the haalaahala poison that emerged among 14 forms when the Devas and Asuras churned the Milky Ocean to obtain amrit, the divine nectar, and saved the Universe from destruction. Another legend associates this day with the famous Shiv Thandav performed by the Lord when he was in great joy.
<br /><br />Maha Shivaratri vrata is observed on the 14th night of the dark half (Krishna Chaturdashi) of Maagha or Kumbha masa, corresponding to February-March. This is also the time when winter yields to warmer days.
<br /><br />The Shivaratri night is marked more by solemnity than revelry. Fasting and keeping vigil throughout night (Jaagarana) are two essential aspects of the vrata.
<br /><br />It is believed that the vrata, observed with strict spiritual discipline, secures immunity from ill-effects of sins committed and liberates one from the cycle of death and birth.
<br /><br />How it is observed: The 12 hours of the night, beginning 6 pm, are divided into four quarters, each known as a Jaama or Yaama. Abhisheka of the Linga is performed with water, milk, curd, honey, rose water among others amidst repeated chanting of Rudra, Chamaka and Purushasookta, mantras dear to Lord Shiva. Lotus, tulsi, Shiva's favourite bilva leaves and the seasonal mango flowers besides vibhooti (holy ash) are offered; food offerings are made and aarti is performed. All the four Vedas—Rig, Yajur, Saama and Atharva—and the Panchaakshara mantra (Na-Ma-Si-Va-Ya) are chanted throughout the night. The night is also marked by singing of bhajans in praise of Shiva.
<br /><br />At dawn the next day, the fast is broken (known as Paaranaa) by taking the divine offerings. The devout skip sleep during the day, for that is said to fetch full benefits of the vrata.
<br /><br />The hunter's story: There is an interesting legend associated with this vrata. A hunter chased by an animal in a forest had to go without food and water and took shelter atop a bilva tree one rainy night. He kept vigil throughout night and engaged himself plucking and dropping bilva leaves. But he did not realise that there was a Linga beneath the tree, and the leaves were also falling on this image amid the showers. It happened to be Shivaratri. The hunter, who unknowingly was fasting and offering bilva leaves to the Linga along with water (thanks to the rain), attained liberation.
<br /><br />Origin of Shiv Linga: There is another legend related to the origin of Shiv Linga. Once a contest arose between Vishnu and Brahma over their superiority. Shiva appeared as a huge column of fire to prove that there was yet one power superior to them. Brahma turned into a swan and flew up to discover the top of the flame. Vishnu as Varaha (boar) tore the earth to discover the base. But they failed and had to accept the greatness of Shiva. This flame (Jyoti) turned into a ‘Sthavara Linga', which is believed to be the celebrated Arunachala Hill at Tiruvannamalai in Tamil Nadu. Sri Arunachaleshwara (Shiva) temple at the foot of this hill is dedicated to Tejo or Jyoti Linga (the fire incarnation of God).

<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/angel.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />It’s really a wonder how people can still believe in evil creatures and monsters that cannot be proved to be true, and try to bring down the blind belief of slaying people for the evil rituals and so on. The Book of Shadows brings you the strange happenings of life and the events that can’t be explained. These happenings are unexplained scientifically. How do they happen and strange way that these things are explained? These are brought in light in this Book of Shadows opening the way for a new world to take our mind and life forever. Just a change in the minds is all that needs to believe in things that cannot be proven. Let’s discover the world of unexplained truth. 
<br /><br />In 1908, a mysterious event occurred in a remote area of Siberia that literally rocked the earth.  To this date, scientist continues to debate the cause of the incident.
<br />On June 30, 1908 at approximately 7:15AM, a huge explosion occurred in a remote, mosquito infested swamp near the Tunguska River.  A local reindeer herding tribe, called the Evenki, described seeing a bright, white light streak across the sky.  They claimed the object, with a tail over 800 kilometers long, made no noise as it passed over the forests northwest of Lake Baykai.  They heard 5 explosions, the second of which was the most powerful.  The Evenki people sealed off the area, believing it was 'enchanted', and feared the gods must be angry at them.
<br />Consequences
<br />The detonation sent seismic shock waves that were recorded all over the world.  At impact, a huge pillar of fire rose several thousand feet in the air.  The huge fire, visible for hundreds of miles away, instantly produced a hot current of air that scorched forests and burned towns in its wake.  Destruction was witnessed as far as 375 miles from the point of impact.  Between 3 and 5 shock waves followed, some heard as far as 800 miles away.  As dark clouds formed over the area, Russia experienced a strange rain of black debris and soil particles.  Dust particles were carried all over the world.
<br />Other parts of the world reported odd atmospheric phenomena for several days after the event.  Colorful sunsets and unusual sunrises captivated people Russia, Scandinavia, and Western Europe.  Light nights were produced in Eastern Siberia and all throughout Middle Asia.  There were reports that the nights remained so bright, you could easily read a newspaper or book with no external light source.  There were also magnetic storms, typical of those produced by nuclear explosions.  Here in the United States, scientists at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory and California's Mount Wilson Observatory reported a marked decrease in the air's transparency.
<br />Unfortunately, scientists in Russia were unable to immediately research the occurrence.  During a time of political strife, Russians felt other matters were more important that trekking through the swamps of Siberia in search of the culprit.  The first expedition to research event did not take place until 13 years later. 
<br />First Expedition
<br />In 1921, an expedition led by Leonid Kulik, a member of the Russian Meteorological Institute, bravely fought their way to the site.  Facing dangerous, uncharted swamps and 'walls of mosquitoes', the team was shocked at the devastation they discovered.  For hundreds of miles, trees were flattened around the center of the impact site.  At the impact site itself, trees were still standing but were completely stripped of leaves and branches.  The team, theorizing that a meteorite caused the devastation, searched endlessly for fragments - none were ever found.  Magnetic probes were incorporated into their search but not one trace of metal was ever found.
<br />Theories abound as to exactly what caused the huge explosion.  Leonid Kulik himself proposed that a huge meteorite crashed into the area.  A colleague of his theorized that since no debris could be found, the force must have been generated by a freak windstorm.  Others point to a black hole.  Some think anti-matter was involved.
<br />In 1946, A. Kasantsev, a Soviet science fiction writer, published a story in the Jan 1946 issue of Bokrug Sveta.  The story told of a nuclear powered alien spacecraft exploding in a fiery crash in the Tunguska area.  This triggered other research into the matter.  Felix Zigel and Aleksey Zolotov, Soviet scientists, found radioactivity at the site and furthered the theory of a crashed alien spacecraft even though subsequent radioactive surveys proved inconclusive.
<br />Modern Day Research
<br />Modern day researchers believe a meteor or comet was responsible but that it exploded in mid air rather than actually crashing into Earth.  They theorize that the diameter must have been around 200 yards.  If the object were a meteor, then the elusive debris was either looked over, vaporized upon impact, or possibly 'skipped' off the face of the Earth and shot back into space.  On the other hand, if the object were an icy comet then the debris simply melted.  If an alien spacecraft were responsible then perhaps the debris was recovered.
<br />Scientists still puzzle over some of the strange biological consequences of the event.  There has been an accelerated growth of biomass at the epicenter, a growth that continues to this day.  Biological mutations have been discovered too, not just at the point of contact, but all along the trajectory of the object over the Tunguska region.  Unusual abnormalities in the Evenki tribe have been recorded.  Genetic variations in certain species of ants and mutations in local plant life have yet to be explained.
<br />What we do know for sure is that in 1908, something struck the Earth with a force of 40 megatons of TNT, 2000 times the force of the atomic bomb that exploded over Hiroshima.  We are extremely fortunate that the event occurred in a remote area of Siberia.  Continued investigation of these phenomena is indeed important fore we can be assured that another event of this magnitude will occur in the future... 
<br />The Myth of Europe’s Green Feral Children 
<br />By James Donahue
<br />Among the weird and unexplained stories told among the natives throughout our world are the tales of the green children who have popped up in the rural areas of Europe.
<br />As the tales are told, green children stumbled out of the wilderness on two occasions, the first near a place called Woolpit in Suffolk, England, during the reign of King Stephen, sometime around the year 1173. Green children reportedly appeared again in 1887 near the town of Banjos, Spain.
<br />In both cases the children were confused, alone, and taken in by the local citizens. They were unable to speak the language of the locals, were dressed in strange clothing, and there skin had a green hue that astounded the people that found them.
<br />The Woolpit incident is strangely the most detailed. As the story is told local farmers found a boy and girl weeping in a field, were unable to understand their strange language, and brought them to the home of Sir Richard de Calne.
<br />The children had to be taught how to eat. Their first meal was beans after they were shown how to open the stalks. Later they were introduced to bread and other foods. The young boy soon became weak and died, but the girl survived.
<br />She was taught to speak English, given a Christian baptism and eventually her skin color changed to that of the locals. She even married and some say she bore at least one child. She was known as Agnes Barre.
<br />After learning English, Agnes told of how she and her brother came to Woolpit after getting lost in an underground place and stumbled out in a rural area in Suffolk. She said they were from a place called St. Martin’s Land where it was always twilight and everything was green. When they came out of the cavern she said they were “struck senseless” by the extreme light and the unusual temperature of the air.
<br />The 1887 story from Banjos, Spain, was almost identical. As in Suffolk, the children were found by field hands crying and huddled near a cave. They were a boy and girl who were searing strange clothing and speaking a strange language. And they had an odd green tint in their skin.
<br />As in the English story the children had to be taught how to eat, the boy soon died, but the girl lived on. Once learning the Spanish language, she told how she and her brother came from a place that had no sun, but was a land of perpetual twilight.
<br />The girl said she and her brother did not know how they got in the cave. She said they got caught up in a whirlwind and found themselves in the cavern. The girl died in 1892. This story did not explain why she died so young, or if the color of her skin ever changed from green.
<br />Because the stories are so similar, some suggest it is a myth that originated in England, and got retold by natives in Spain.
<br />There is a high probability noted among historians that most popular myths stem from real events that are retold so many times the details become clouded and altered into folklore. British folklore researcher Dr. Katharine Briggs suggested in her book, A Dictionary of Fairies, that the green children story contained themes prevalent in Faerie lore. These would include the color green, the twilight land and subterranean worlds.
<br />Other theories include the possibility that the Earth is hollow and the green children emerged from a hidden world from down under, they were immigrants from northern Scandinavia who strangely found their way to Suffolk, they were personifications of Nature which accounted for the green color of their skin, or that they were aliens accidentally transported to Earth from another planet or dimension.
<br />In a paper by historical researcher Paul Harris, published in Fortean Studies in 1998, the children may have been Flemish and came from the village of Fornham St. Martin, northwest of Woolpit. At that time, Harris notes that there had been a steady influx of Flemish merchants and weavers from Belgium, and after Henry II became king, these people suffered great persecution, many of them having been slaughtered.
<br />Harris theorizes that the children were orphans after their parents were killed, and that they survived by fleeing into Thetford Forest. If they stayed there for any length of time, without finding much food, they might have suffered from malnutrition. One effect of this is chlorosis, which is a gradual greening of the skin.
<br />Harris suggests the children may have wandered into one of the many underground mine passages in that area which ultimately lead to Woolpit. He perceives the scenario of the two children emerging from the cave in a bewildered state, with a starvation-induced greenish pallor, disoriented by the bright sunlight, dressed in unfamiliar Flemish clothes and speaking the Flemish dialect.
<br />And thus would have been born the legend of the green children.

<br /><br />This blog is for everyone. Love the person who deserves it. If you don't your life will be a total mess.
<br />Don't love anyone who says that your their world; they are definitely lying. Cause if the person really loves you he/ she need not tell that. And the best person who understands you without any words is the person who loves your heart not your physic. Its really really important that you love some one who loves you and really live for you. If you forget that and the chase your dreams then you'll be a SLAVE for the person later without having any meaning for your life and even loose your identity and yourself.
<br /><br />Better take decision clearly. Just because he/ she is someone is the person whom you like most and suffers or you want them more don't ever think about loving them until you know they really think your important. 
<br /><br />Its better to be far and close rather than near and disturbed. Don't loose your life. First know whether they match your character or not. If you love without that you will find them saying that your boring and even tell that they don't want to you talking. 
<br /><br />And more they will give importance to other people.
<br /><br />Its never late to realize and move away from such undeserving people.
