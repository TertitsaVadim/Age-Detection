<br />she stands in the wind on the hill top
<br />crying crimson to bring colour to her pale cheeks
<br />from the torn rose of her past
<br />The glistening blood moves across her face
<br />and it grips her radiant white lips
<br />bringing her the taste of the sea
<br />and drawing her down from the hills
<br />In pain she weeps for the one she lost
<br />years before her heart learned sorrow
<br />thought the death of her past lovers heart
<br />turning to hatred he cast loneliness upon her
<br />She is now damned sitting at the bottom
<br />thinking whether or not to end her life
<br />as her red run complexion is darkening
<br />and bringing her away to the evil
<br />She wants to leave this world now, I must save her
<br />because I love her and I can't stand it anymore
<br />seeing such a radiant purity destroy herself
<br />it makes me become angered, I must save her
<br />If I don't, she'll no longer be the one
<br />the one who is free of torture
<br />the one who has an impervious beauty
<br />the one who has my heart, I must save her

<br />Why do fools laugh at the importance of my goals?
<br />Why does water seem to run thicker than blood
<br />why does betrayal and lies seem to come in a great flood?
<br /><br />Why do you continuously taunt and mock me
<br />why do you continuously try to break me
<br />why do you constantly set my soul ablaze?
<br />Why do you constantly attack me with your sharp words instead of your peaceful grace?
<br /><br />Oh why, why, why do you judge me?
<br />Oh why, why, why don’t you love me?
<br />Oh why, why, why I see too many rainy days
<br />Oh why, why, why sorrow and pain always comes my way
<br /><br />why do tears run down my soul?
<br />Nobody will probably know
<br />why heart break and pain dwells over me
<br />but I just hope that one day my soul will be able to fly freely

<br />No one hears the cries behind the door
<br />No ones sees the mind behind this face
<br />No one fears the hate that has escaped
<br />No one sees...me...inside...my mind
<br /><br />I cannot be pretending that I'm not alive
<br />I cannot be pretending that I won't revive
<br />When it escapes I know you'll be there by my side
<br />Just to listen to me for this dead heart needs to confide
<br /><br />I just won't close my eyes
<br />I won't be alone
<br />When this dead heart bleeds
<br />I'll be carried home
<br /><br />I feel the knife
<br />My dead heart bleeds
<br />Rain from the sky
<br />I'll be home
<br />I feel the knife
<br />My dead heart bleeds
<br />Rain from the sky
<br />I'll be home 
<br /><br />I wont hide these scars
<br />I wont mend this heart
<br />I wont hide my veins
<br />Ill just watch it rain
<br />I wont hide my face
<br />I wont mend these scars
<br />I wont hide my shame
<br />I'll just watch it rain, down from my veins
<br /><br />No one sees, No ones feels, the rain in my eyes...blinds
<br /><br />I feel the knife
<br />My dead heart bleeds
<br />Rain from the sky
<br />I'll be home
<br />I feel the knife
<br />My dead heart bleeds
<br />Rain from the sky
<br />I'll be home
<br /><br />I'll watch it rain
<br />Down from my veins.

<br />like words of hate, left unspoken, 
<br />until the blade of conflict cuts, 
<br />the skin that spreads, as opened up.
<br /><br />The blood flows out like crimson streams,
<br />Surrounds and drowns the strongest screams,
<br />Until the river red runs dry,
<br />All else is left alone to die.
<br /><br />The wound, it slowly closes up, 
<br />and mends until it closes shut, 
<br />it hides the pain it felt before, 
<br />and waits for pain that's left in store.
<br /><br />Scars appear where wounds once healed, 
<br />and still reveal where holes were sealed, 
<br />Remind of times of massive loss, 
<br />when losing cancelled out the cost.
<br /><br />The only thing prolonging pain, 
<br />Are memories inside the brain, 
<br />that if erased, would put to rest, 
<br />Reminders of the pain that's left.

<br />a tear very special, 
<br />a tear with so much sadness, 
<br />that as been turn into this.
<br />As life comes to the end, 
<br />the feelings were just too deep; 
<br />I must put it to an end.
<br />Good-bye daddy, 
<br />please tell mommy 
<br />to be strong, 
<br />tell sister not to cry, 
<br />tell brother to look out for me, 
<br />and I promise when I'll go to heaven, 
<br />you wont soon be forgotten, 
<br />I will be waiting, 
<br />something I did all my life.
<br /><br />11:00 O’clock just rang, 
<br />as life comes to an end, 
<br />no one is here to say good-bye, 
<br />something I should be used to
<br />by the end...
<br />My whole life as been this way,
<br />and as the tear of blood crawl down my face,
<br />no fear as been spokeing,
<br />and never will it be,
<br />the pain you cost me as its consequences,
<br />and never can I walk earth again.
<br />So as my tear explain my pain,
<br />I leave my body,
<br />with nothing to gain,
<br />So from now on,
<br />So long, and good-night...
<br />This is a choice that I will never fight

<br />you'd know my body is dead,
<br />my mind has been taken over,
<br />that's why I am so scared,
<br />I can't control it,
<br />anger is making me blind,
<br />I've been left here on my own
<br />chained to a hate of some kind.
<br />If these walls could talk.
<br /><br />If these walls could talk,
<br />you'd know about my fears,
<br />about all those nights I screamed for help,
<br />about all my fallen tears.
<br />You'd know about the demons
<br />haunting me at night,
<br />you'd be able to help me
<br />keep my fire alight,
<br />if these walls could talk.
<br /><br />If these walls could talk
<br />they would say that it's all right,
<br />God sends His angels
<br />to look over me at night.
<br />They'd encourage me,
<br />say though I am alone
<br />it doesn't mean I‘m on my own.
<br />He watches me, from above
<br />and showers me with all His love,
<br />if only these walls could talk.

<br />as she lectured me,
<br />tears poured down my face
<br />I knew what this was
<br />I needed no lecturing
<br />I only came to her for help
<br />all I needed was moral support
<br />I looked into her face
<br />I knew what she was saying,
<br />(the same as everyone else)
<br />though I heard no words
<br />I only cried harder
<br />I understand everything
<br />I don't need people to tell me what's wrong

<br />she was the only person I had left to turn to

<br />And you learn, 
<br />You learn all too well, 
<br />So that later, when there's nobody to dish it out, 
<br />You can punch yourself in the gut 
<br />And take it some more. 
<br /><br />The best part is, 
<br />With training and practice, 
<br />You learn your own soft spots and weaknesses, 
<br />So that you become your own best tormentor. 
<br /><br />Double up over the pain and swallow. 
<br />It'll still be there tomorrow, 
<br />Waiting for you.
