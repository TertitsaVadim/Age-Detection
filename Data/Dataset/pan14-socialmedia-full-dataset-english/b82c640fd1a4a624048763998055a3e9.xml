<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />that I bought you roses
<br />to tell you that i like you
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />That I was raised with respect
<br />not to sleep with you when you were drunk
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />That my body's not ripped enough
<br />to &quot;satisfy&quot; your wants
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />that I open your car door,
<br />and pull out your chair like I was raised
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />That I'm not cute enough
<br />to be &quot;your guy&quot;
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />That I am actually nice;
<br />not a jerk
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />I don't have a huge bank account
<br />to buy you expensive things
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />I like to spend quality nights at home
<br />cuddling with you, instead of at a club
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />I would rather make love to you then just screw you
<br />like some random guy.
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />That I am always the one you need to talk to,
<br />but never good enough to date
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />That I always held your hair back when you threw up,and didn't get mad at you for puking in my car,
<br />but when we went out you went home with another guy
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />That I am there to pick you up at 4am when your new man hit you and dropped you off in the middle of nowhere,
<br />but not good enough to listen to me when I need a friend
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />If I start not being there because it hurts being used as a door mat, only to be thrown to the side when the new jerk comes around
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />If I don't answer my phone anymore when you call, to listen to you cry for hours, instead of getting a couple hours of sleep before work
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />that you can't realize.. I've been the one all along.
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />If you read this and know somebody like this
<br />but don't care
<br /><br />But most of all
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />For not being sorry anymore
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />That you can't accept me for who I am
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />I can never do anything right, and nothing that I do is good
<br />enough to make it in your world.
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />I caught your boyfriend with another girl and told you about it, I thought that was what friends were for...
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />That I told you I loved you and actually meant it.
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />That I talked to you for nine hours on Thanksgiving when your boyfriend was threatening you instead of spending time with my family.
<br /><br />I'm Sorry
<br />That I cared
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />that I listen to you at night talking about how you wish you could have done something different.
<br /><br />Ladies always complain and gripe to their friends that there is never any good guys out there, and they always end up with assholes who mistreat them. Well ladies next time you're complaining, maybe look up to see who you're complaining to, maybe that special someone is right there hanging on your every word as usual, screaming in his head &quot;Why won't you give me a chance?&quot;
<br />Because the person you are usually searching for is right by you.
<br /><br />If you're a guy and you agree with this letter, repost as &quot;I'm sorry &quot;
<br /><br />If You're one of the FEW girls with enough BALLS to repost, and you would never make your guy feel this way, repost as Subject &quot;Girls dont realize these things&quot;

<br /><br />A good relationship must be created, it doesnt just happen.
<br /><br />In it, the little things are the big things.
<br /><br />It is never being too old to hold hands.
<br /><br />It is remembering to say 'I love you' at least once a day.
<br /><br />It is never going to sleep angry.
<br /><br />It is standing together and facing the world.....Whether you like it or not.
<br /><br />It is forming a circle of love that gathers in everyone you care about.
<br /><br />It is speaking words of appreciation and demonstrating gratitude in thoughtful ways.
<br /><br />It is having the capacity to forgive and forget.
<br /><br />It is giving each other an atmosphere in which each can grow.
<br /><br />It is a common search for the good and the beautiful.
<br /><br />It is not only finding the right person.
<br /><br />It is being the right partner.
<br /><br />What do you think?

<br />This is just wrong.. 
<br /><br />you are one sick person if you dont repost this i feel for you if 
<br />this doesnt touch you because this is just wrong. read this. its disgusting 
<br /><br />Walking in my nighty; rubbing my eyes 
<br />My fathers sitting on the sofa with his friend 
<br />He pats the seat in the middle; i sit 
<br />Shivering so cold; a quilt he lends 
<br /><br />&quot;Jessy you love me don't you&quot; a smile; his 
<br />Their breathe spirts weep 
<br />&quot;Daddy you know i do; what is it?&quot; 
<br />He smiles at his friend; his hand creeps 
<br /><br />His friend takes my hand; looks me in the eyes 
<br />Daddys creeping up my nightie; cold hands 
<br />I try to pull his hand away; 
<br />their grip is strong! 
<br />They look at one another; nod; something planned 
<br /><br />I feel my palms sweat; Daddys under my knickers 
<br />&quot;Daddy im going to bed! Night&quot; Pulling again 
<br />But there grip is to strong for weak me 
<br />I look at both; and ask, who are these men? 
<br /><br />His fingers going up me; pulling away 
<br />His friend leans forward; a kiss? Why? 
<br />His toungue moving mine; my eyes squint 
<br />Lean back and away; &quot;Why are you doing this?&quot; 
<br />No answer, i feel the pain inside me; him 
<br />Chucks the quilt on the floor; me to 
<br />I try and scamper away, but im not fast 
<br />&quot;O Daddy please, i love you&quot; 
<br /><br />His friend; pulling at my nightie 
<br />And my Dad pulling my pants down 
<br />His friend pinning my hands to the floor 
<br />As my Dad lies himself on the ground 
<br /><br />I squirm; as Daddy friend pulls me up 
<br />And places me ontop of Daddy; thrusts within 
<br />I cry; i bite; i scratch; i slap; i fail 
<br />&quot;O Daddy please you win you win!&quot; 
<br /><br />I can feel my skin rip; my virginity breaking free 
<br />I can feel the blood seep down my leg 
<br />&quot;Daddy your hurting me please&quot; 
<br />I plead to him and his friend; not even a beg 
<br /><br />Daddys laughing; why does he laugh? 
<br />His friend shoves himself in my mouth and moans 
<br />Tieing my hands together; moving in and out 
<br />&quot;Ride me Jessy&quot; He laughs and groans 
<br /><br />They smile at one another; laugh to 
<br />They roll me over and spread me wide well 
<br />My daddy sits on my face; himself in again 
<br />While his friend talks and pushes himself inside 
<br /><br />I can hardly breathe; i gag for air 
<br />I cough and splutter; cry and weep 
<br />I beg and plead; but its no use 
<br />Theyve already made me hurt and bleed 
<br /><br />I stare into his eyes; that look upon me 
<br />This is not my Dad; where is he? 
<br />If he was still here; would he care 
<br />Would he actually even; see? 
<br /><br />Finally they get of and lie me on the sofa 
<br />My cheeks blouchy from tears and pain 
<br />They play with them selfs; all over me 
<br />Rub it in; making me feel the shame 
<br /><br />&quot;Why Daddy? Please tell me why?&quot; 
<br />Dad looks at his friend; and waves him away 
<br />&quot;Jessy i love you&quot; he smiles and kisses my cheek 
<br />&quot;Is that all you have in your heart to say?&quot; 
<br /><br />He puts my nightie on me 
<br />he walks me to my bedroom door 
<br />Ever since that night; His friend 
<br />And himself every Friday come back for more 
<br /><br />&quot;Night sweet Girl; You are my life&quot; 
<br />Closing the door, tears still down my face 
<br />Still the smell of him and his friend 
<br />Fade into me like disgrace 
<br /><br />I watch the Moon go down; the sun come up 
<br />&quot;Jessy its school&quot; Knocking at my door 
<br />I cant help but cry; weep in pain 
<br />Because im so scared he wanted more 
<br /><br />But one night daddy took it too far 
<br />Daddy and his friend came back for one last shot 
<br />They were worried they would get caught 
<br />So he and his friend took me to a cemetary lot 
<br /><br />I was blindfolded and my hands were tied back 
<br />&quot;Daddy please!! Not tonight!&quot; 
<br />Daddy and his friend both had their last fun 
<br />After that i tried to put up a fight 
<br /><br />I begged daddy &quot;Please no more!&quot; 
<br />All he could say &quot;Shut up, you stupid Bitch!&quot; 
<br />Daddy unblindfolded me at last 
<br />He said I love you so much 
<br /><br />He went back into the car and pulled out a bat 
<br />&quot;Daddy I swear I wont say a thing!!!!&quot; 
<br />I was dead 
<br />After only one swing..........................

Its just so monotonous! How are people going to know what you really look like if you look the same...ALL THE TIME! 
<br />Im not saying that I take good pictures or am execptionally pretty, but if you believe you are beautiful, why need so many identical pictures to show it?! 
<br /><br />Everyone is unique, everyone looks different, so there is no need to take so many of the same pictures to identfiy yourself, no one else is you...That's what makes you beautiful...Every Single Person On This Planet! 
<br /><br />If you disagree with this, or even agree with this, please drop a comment or something, I just want to know if what Im thinking isnt too irrational. 
<br />Thanks

<br /><br />Girl:Hey babe, I'll be right back. I need to take this call.
<br /><br />Boy: Yeah okay. Sure.
<br /><br />She walks into the next room.
<br /><br />Girl: Hey! What's up?
<br /><br />Guy [on her cellphone]: Nothing, hey hun, do you think we could go do something later tonight? What are the chances my boss let me get out early.
<br /><br />Girl: Yeah, sounds great!
<br /><br />Guy [on her cellphone]: Okay. I'm right by your house, I'll come to get you now.
<br /><br />Girl: That's not such a good idea...
<br /><br />Guy [on her cellphone]: Why not?
<br /><br />Girl: I'm busy right now... sorry.
<br /><br />Guy [on her cellphone]: With what? It's our anniversary! You didn't make any other plans did you...?
<br /><br />In her head she yells, SHIT! Throws clothes back on quickly.
<br />Girl: No No... I was just eating... with the family.
<br /><br />Guy [on her cellphone]: But I thought you said your family was away this weekend, up at your resort?
<br /><br />The guy walks into her house, turns the corner into the hallway. Goes downstairs, and finds his bestfriend on her couch, half un-dressed, trying to pull his pants back on and his girlfriend pulling her shirt over her head.
<br /><br />Guy: What the hell is going on?!
<br /><br />Girl: I can explain! Please listen to me!
<br /><br />Guy: Benny? How could you do this to me! Rachel! I thought you loved me! And yet, your sleeping with MY BEST FRIEND!!!!
<br /><br />Girl: John...!
<br /><br />John with tears in his eyes, he rushes out of room, and slams the door.
<br /><br />Benny climbs out of the window, starts his car, and drives off down the street.
<br /><br />Girl runs after her boyfriend. Yelling...
<br /><br />Girl: NOOOO! Please!! Come back John!! Pleeeeeasssse????!! She falls down and cries.
<br /><br />John turns around, looks straight at his girlfriend in tears.
<br /><br />John: Why? Rachel, why? I loved you! Oh my God, I'm in love with a whore. Does this mean I have to pay you now?!
<br />Here take this as the cash. He drops a ring box on her lap.
<br /><br />She opens the ring box. Her jaw drops... Before her eyes is a diamond wedding ring.
<br /><br />Girl: You were going to propose?
<br /><br />Guy: Yeah... how dumb was I? And as he slowly walked back to his car, his headlights faded... And she was in despair.
<br /><br />Later that night, the girl got a phone call from the police saying he just jumped off the bridge and killed himself.
<br /><br />If you love/like someone, and you want them in your life forever. Repost in 380 seconds as &quot;cheating hurts.&quot; Or your true love will walk away
