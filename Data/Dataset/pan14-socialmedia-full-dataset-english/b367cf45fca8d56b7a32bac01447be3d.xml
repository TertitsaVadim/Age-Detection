He used to earn hisbread by selling those programs in the Sunday market.One day, while he was working, his machine tumbled off the table and fell in the river. Encouraged by the Panchatantra story of his childhood (the woodcutter and the axe),he started praying to the River Goddess. The River Goddess wanted to test him and so appeared only after one month of rigorous prayers. The engineer told her that he had lost his computer in the river.As usual, the Goddess wanted to test his honesty. She showed him a match box and asked, "Is this your computer ?" Disappointed by the Goddess' lack of computer awareness, the engineer replied, "No."She next showed him a pocket-sized calculator and asked if that was his.Annoyed, the engineer said "No, not at all!!"Finally, she came up with his own Pentium machine and asked if it was his.The engineer, left with no option, sighed and said "Yes."The River Goddess was happy with his honesty. She was about to give him all three items, but before she could make the offer, the engineer asked her, "Don't you know that you're supposed to show me some better computers before bringing up my own ?"The River Goddess, angered at this, replied, "I know that, you stupid donkey! The first two things I showed you were the Trillennium and the Billennium, the latest computers from IBM !". So saying, she disappeared with the Pentium!!Moral: If you're not up-to-date with technology trends, it's better to keep your mouth shut and let people think you're a fool than to open your mouth and remove all doubt.DR.G.

But do you know that Sikhs are one of the hardest working prosperous and diversified communities in the world.My friend told me about the following incident which I wish to share with you. It has had a deep impact on my thinking.During last vacation, his few friends came to Delhi. They rented a taxi for local sight-seeing. The driver was an old Sardar and boys being boys, these pals began cracking Sardarji jokes, just to tease the old man.But to their surprise, the fellow remained unperturbed.At the end of the sight-seeing, they paid the cab hire-charges. The Sardar returned the change, but he gave each one of them one rupee extra and said,''Son, since morning you have been telling Sardarji jokes. I listened to them all and let me tell you, some of them were in bad taste. Still, I don't mind coz I know that you are young blood and are yet to see the world.. But I have one request. I am giving you one rupee each. Give it to the first Sardar beggar that you come across in this or any other city.'My friend continued,* ' That one rupee coin is still with me. I couldn't find a single Sardar begging anywhere.'MORAL:The secret behind their universal success, is their willingness to do any job with utmost dedication and pride. A Sardar will drive a truck or set up a roadside garage or a dhaba, put a fruit juice stall, take up small time carpentry, ... but he will never beg on the streets.DR.G.M.SINGH GENERAL MEDICAL SERVICE 3/5 WEST PATEL NAGAR NEW DELHI-110008 INDIA 01142488406;9891635088

<br /><br />One young academically excellent person went to apply for a managerial position in a big company.
<br /><br />He passed the first interview, the director did the last interview, made the last decision.
<br /><br />The director discovered from the CV that the youth's academic achievements were excellent all the way, from the secondary school until the postgraduate research, never had a year when he did not score.
<br /><br />The director asked,
<br />&quot;Did you obtain any scholarships in school?&quot;
<br />the youth answered &quot;none&quot;.
<br /><br />The director asked,
<br />&quot; Was it your father who paid for your school fees?&quot;
<br />The youth answered,
<br />&quot;My father passed away, when I was one year old, it was my mother, who paid for my school fees.
<br /><br />The director asked,
<br />&quot; Where did your mother work?&quot;
<br />The youth answered,
<br />&quot;My mother worked as clothes cleaner.
<br />The director requested the youth to show his hands.
<br />The youth showed a pair of hands that were smooth and perfect.
<br /><br />The director asked,
<br />&quot; Have you ever helped your mother wash the clothes before?&quot;
<br />The youth answered,
<br />&quot;Never, my mother always wanted me to study and read more books.
<br />Furthermore, my mother can wash clothes faster than me.
<br /><br />The director said,
<br />&quot;I have a request. When you go back today, go and clean your mother's hands, and then see me tomorrow morning.*
<br /><br />The youth felt that his chance of landing the job was high. When he went back, he happily requested his mother to let him clean her hands. His mother felt strange, happy but with mixed feelings, she showed her hands to the kid.
<br /><br />The youth cleaned his mother's hands slowly. His tear fell as he did that. It was the first time he noticed that his mother's hands were so wrinkled, and there were so many bruises in her hands. Some bruises were so painful that his mother shivered when they were cleaned with water.
<br /><br />This was the first time the youth realized that it was this pair of hands that washed the clothes everyday to enable him to pay the school fee. The bruises in the mother's hands were the price that the mother had to pay for his graduation, academic excellence and his future.
<br /><br />After finishing the cleaning of his mother's hands, the youth quietly washed all the remaining clothes for his mother.
<br /><br />That night, mother and son talked for a very long time.
<br /><br />Next morning, the youth went to the director's office.
<br /><br />The Director noticed the tears in the youth's eyes, asked:
<br />&quot;Can you tell me what have you done and learned yesterday in your house?&quot;
<br /><br />The youth answered,
<br />&quot;I cleaned my mother's hand, and also finished cleaning all the remaining clothes'
<br /><br />The Director asked,
<br />&quot;please tell me your feelings.&quot;
<br /><br />The youth said,
<br /><br />Number 1,
<br />I know now what appreciation means.. Without my mother, there would not the successful me today.
<br /><br />Number 2,
<br />by working together and helping my mother, only I now realize how difficult and tough it is to get something done.
<br /><br />Number 3,
<br />I have come to appreciate the importance and value of family relationship.
<br /><br />The director said,
<br />&quot; This is what I am looking for to be my manager. I want to recruit a person who can appreciate the help of others, a person who knows the sufferings of others to get things done, and a person who would not put money as his only goal in life. You are hired.
<br /><br />Later on, this young person worked very hard, and received the respect of his subordinates. Every employee worked diligently and as a team. The company's performance improved tremendously.
<br /><br />A child, who has been protected and habitually given whatever he wanted, would develop&quot;entitlement mentality&quot; and would always put himself first. He would be ignorant of his parent's efforts.
<br /><br />When he starts work, he assumes that every person must listen to him, and when he becomes a manager, he would never know the sufferings of his employees and would always blame others.
<br /><br />For this kind of people, who may be good academically, may be successful for a while, but eventually would not feel sense of achievement.
<br /><br />He will grumble and be full of hatred and fight for more. If we are this kind of protective parents, are we really showing love or are we destroying the kid instead?*
<br /><br />You can let your kid live in a big house, give him a Driver &amp; Car for going around, Eat a Good Meal, learn Piano, Watch a Big Screen TV. But when you are Cutting Grass, please let them experience it. After a Meal, let them Wash their Plates and Bowls together with their Brothers and Sisters. Tell them to Travel in Public Bus, It is not because you do not have Money for Car or to Hire a Maid, but it is because you want to Love them in a right way. You want them to understand, no matter how rich their parents are, one day their hair will Grow Grey, same as the Mother of that young person. The most important thing is your kid learns how to appreciate the effort and experience the difficulty and learns the ability to work with others to get things done.
<br /><br />You would have forwarded many mails to many and many of them would have back mailed you too...but try and forward this story to as many as possible... this may change some one's fate...

<br /><br />She soared so high and free,
<br />all pure and lovely as could be.
<br />She knew no worry, stress or pain.
<br />No one could imprison her by force or chain.
<br /><br />But as it must be, a conqueror came.
<br />So handsome and bold, and lit the flame,
<br />between these free spirited souls.
<br />Their love was beautiful and all aglow.
<br /><br />In time their passionate thirst was quenched
<br />and the flame of love was flickering low ...
<br />In the cold darkness of reality it began to show
<br />Their love had taken their freedom and turned them to foes.
<br /><br />When they could stand it no longer,
<br />they both returned to find their lost freedom
<br />and search for their identity they felt they had lost.
<br />But each day that passed their need for each other grew stronger.
<br /><br />Now they're no longer unencumbered and free...
<br />this is the price of love, you see.
<br />Whether together or apart
<br />the one you love has imprisoned your heart.

<br /><br />At a restaurant, a cockroach suddenly flew from somewhere and sat on a lady. She started screaming out of fear. With a panic stricken face and trembling voice, she started jumping, with both her hands desperately trying to get rid of the cockroach.
<br /><br />Her reaction was contagious, as everyone in her group also got panicky.
<br /><br />The lady finally managed to push the cockroach away but ...it landed on another lady in the group.
<br /><br />Now, it was the turn of the other lady in the group to continue the drama.
<br /><br />The waiter rushed forward to their rescue.
<br /><br />In the relay of throwing, the cockroach next fell upon the waiter.
<br /><br />The waiter stood firm, composed himself and observed the behavior of the cockroach on his shirt.
<br /><br />When he was confident enough, he grabbed it with his fingers and threw it out of the restaurant.
<br /><br />Sipping my coffee and watching the amusement, the antenna of my mind picked up a few thoughts and started wondering, was the cockroach responsible for their histrionic behavior?
<br /><br />If so, then why was the waiter not disturbed?
<br /><br />He handled it near to perfection, without any chaos.
<br /><br />It is not the cockroach, but the inability of the ladies to handle the disturbance caused by the cockroach that disturbed the ladies.
<br /><br />I realized that, it is not the shouting of my father or my boss or my wife that disturbs me, but it's my inability to handle the disturbances caused by their shouting that disturbs me.
<br /><br />It's not the traffic jams on the road that disturbs me, but my inability to handle the disturbance caused by the traffic jam that disturbs me.
<br /><br />More than the problem, it's my reaction to the problem that creates chaos in my life.
<br /><br />Lessons learnt from the story:
<br />I understood, I should not react in life.
<br />I should always respond.
<br />The women reacted, whereas the waiter responded.
<br /><br />Reactions are always instinctive whereas responses are always well thought of, just and right to save a situation from going out of hand, to avoid cracks in relationship, to avoid taking decisions in anger, anxiety, stress or hurry. 
<br /><br />Have a nice day!

<br /><br />The only one who is, will never make you cry.
<br /><br />If you love someone, put their name in a circle, instead of a heart.
<br /><br />Hearts can break, but circles go on forever.
<br /><br />Everyone hears what you say. Friends listen to what you say.
<br /><br />Best friends listen to what you don't .
<br /><br />If all my friends were to jump off a bridge, I wouldn't jump with them.
<br />I'd be at the bottom to catch them.
<br /><br />Don't frown, because you never know who's falling in love with your smile !
<br /><br />It takes a minute to have a crush on someone, an hour to like someone
<br />and a day to love someone---but it takes a lifetime to forget someone.
<br /><br />&quot;If you judge people, you have no time to love them.&quot;-

<br /><br />There have been many times
<br />that I'd lose grip and then fall,
<br />And, you were there beside me
<br />to help me rise above it all.
<br />There have been many times
<br />when I'd reach the end of end,
<br />And, you inspired me
<br />by giving hope to just start over again!
<br />YOU INSPIRED ME!
<br /><br />There have been times
<br />when I had lost all that I had gained,
<br />And, you brought me bright sunshine
<br />to send away the rains.
<br />There have been many times
<br />that I'd just quit, giving all up,
<br />And, you'd bring me a drink of renewal
<br />from friendship's cup!
<br />YOU WERE SUNSHINE!
<br /><br />Then, all the times that I had been slipping
<br />and sinking so fast,
<br />You encouraged me to reach out
<br />to grasp hope that would last.
<br />As, I was spinning in frantic circles of chaos,
<br />around and round,
<br /><br />You threw out the anchor
<br />that placed me back on solid ground!
<br />YOU RENEWED HOPE!
<br /><br />The bond of friendship that I have with you
<br />is one richly blessed,
<br />As, it is one that has survived,
<br />as it passed every friendship test.
<br />You and I've remained friends
<br /><br />in the good times, as well as bad,
<br />Your pledge of loyalty, as a friend
<br />is the truest I have ever had!
<br />OUR FRIENDSHIP IS BLESSED!
<br /><br />The commitment of &quot;togetherness&quot;
<br />we have had all these years,
<br />Will surely continue to build as we move
<br />onward past life's tears;
<br /><br />And, as we reach the point in our lives,
<br />called &quot;The Golden Age&quot;,
<br />I shall look back and extend a thank you
<br />for each and every day!
<br />OUR FRIENDSHIP WILL LAST!

<br /><br />Laying underneath the stars,
<br />On a warm silent night.
<br />Your arms are wrapped around me,
<br />And everything feels right.
<br />You kiss me sweet and softly,
<br />I feel your warm gentle touch,
<br />You help me feel protected
<br />Under the sweet night sky rush.
<br />My world before me is perfect.
<br />There's nowhere else I want to be,
<br />Except laying underneath the stars
<br />Hand in hand, you and me.
<br />Just when everything is perfect,
<br />And you seem so delicately sweet,
<br />A rush of wind comes past me
<br />As I'm swept beneath my feet.
<br />Nothing could be more right,
<br />There's nowhere else I want to be.
<br />Let's take a walk my only love,
<br />Hand in hand, you and me.

<br /><br />There's something in a simple hug
<br /><br />That always warms the heart,
<br /><br />It welcomes us back home
<br /><br />And makes it easier to part.
<br /><br />A hug is a way to share the joy
<br /><br />And sad times we go through,
<br /><br />Or just a way for friends to say
<br /><br />They like you 'cause you're you.
<br /><br />Hugs are meant for anyone
<br /><br />For whom we really care,
<br /><br />From your grandma to your neighbor,
<br /><br />Or a cuddly teddy bear.
<br /><br />A hug is an amazing thing
<br /><br />It's just the perfect way
<br /><br />To show the love we're feeling
<br /><br />But can't find the words to say.
<br /><br />It's funny how a little hug
<br /><br />Makes everyone feel good;
<br /><br />In every place and language,
<br /><br />It's always understood.
<br /><br />And hugs don't need new equipment,
<br /><br />Special batteries or parts -
<br /><br />Just open up your arms
<br /><br />And open up your hearts.

<br />There's twice the fun;
<br />When we share success,
<br />We've surpassed what we've done.
<br /><br />When we share problems,
<br />There's half the pain;
<br />When we share tears,
<br />A rainbow follows rain.
<br /><br />When we share dreams,
<br />They become more real;
<br />When we share secrets,
<br />It's our hearts we reveal.
<br /><br />If we share a smile,
<br />That's when our love shows;
<br />If we share a hug,
<br />That's when our love grows.
<br /><br />If we share with someone
<br />On whom we depend,
<br />That person is always
<br />Family or friend.
<br /><br />And what draws us closer
<br />And makes us all care,
<br />Is not what we have,
<br />But the things we share
