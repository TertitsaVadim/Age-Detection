<br /><br />Australian drug maker CSL Ltd. published results of a study that found 75 percent to 96 percent of vaccinated people should be protected with a single dose — the same degree of effectiveness as the regular winter flu shot. That's remarkable considering scientists thought it would take two doses.
<br /><br />U.S. data to be released Friday confirm those findings and show the&lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.air-max-shoes.com%2FNike_Revaderchi.html%26quot%3B%26gt%3BNike"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.air-max-shoes.com/Nike_Revaderchi.html&quot;&gt;Nike</a> Revaderchi&lt;/a&gt; protection starts rapidly, Dr. Anthony Fauci of the National Institutes of Health told The Associated Press.
<br /><br />&quot;This is quite good news,&quot; Fauci said.
<br /><br />The dose question has an important ramification: It means people will have to line up for influenza vaccinations twice this year instead of three times — once for the regular winter flu shot and a second time to be inoculated against swine flu, what doctors call the 2009 H1N1 strain.
<br /><br />Thursday's swine flu vaccine reports&lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.4uaj.com%2FNike_jordan_3.html%26quot%3B%26gt%3BNike"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.4uaj.com/Nike_jordan_3.html&quot;&gt;Nike</a> jordan 3&lt;/a&gt;  center on adults; studies in children aren't finished yet.
<br /><br />But scientists had feared that people of all ages would need two shots about a month apart because the new H1N1 strain is so genetically different from normally circulating flu strains that most of the population has little if any immunity.
<br /><br />Chinese manufacturers gave the first hint a week ago that one dose could be enough. But different manufacturers make different formulations of the&lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.enjoyjd.com%2FAir_jordan_III.html%26quot%3B%26gt%3BAir"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.enjoyjd.com/Air_jordan_III.html&quot;&gt;Air</a> jordan III&lt;/a&gt; vaccine, so more evidence was needed.
<br /><br />Thus the CSL study, rushed out by the New England Journal of Medicine late Thursday, is welcome news. In a study of 240 adults, half younger than 50 and half over, one shot prompted the same kind of immune response indicating protection that is seen with regular flu vaccine. And a standard 15-microgram dose — not the double dose that also was tested — was enough.
<br /><br />CSL, which is one U.S. vaccine supplier, found the same side effects in its study that people experience with regular flu vaccine, which is no surprise since this shot is merely a recipe change from the annual standby. About 45 percent of recipients had mild reactions such as a headache, sore arm or redness at the shot site.
<br /><br />On Friday, the NIH is set to release results of its own studies of hundreds of adults that confirm that one shot works, Fauci said. Plus, the U.S. work shows that people are protected eight to 10 days after that inoculation, he said.
<br /><br />One dose means tight supplies&lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.24-7jordan.com%2FJordan_3_shoes.html%26quot%3B%26gt%3BJordan"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.24-7jordan.com/Jordan_3_shoes.html&quot;&gt;Jordan</a> 3 shoes&lt;/a&gt; of H1N1 vaccine won't be stretched so thin after all. The U.S. has ordered 195 million doses, based on the hope that 15 micrograms was indeed the right dose. Had it taken twice that dosage, or two shots apiece, half as many people could have received the vaccine.
<br /><br />The winter flu vaccine is widely available now, and U.S. health authorities urged people to get it out of the way now before swine flu shots start arriving in mid-October.
<br /><br />Despite all the headlines about swine flu, which has become the main influenza strain circulating in the world, doctors do expect some garden-variety flu to hit this fall too — the kind that every year kills 36,000 Americans and hospitalizes 200,000.
<br /><br />&quot;Take some individual responsibility to stay healthy during the flu season,&quot; said Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, who scheduled her own seasonal shot for Friday. Waiting to get the first inoculation out of the way &quot;is not in anybody's best interest,&quot; added Dr. Nancy Nielsen, past president of the American Medical Association. She said busy doctors need to have completed regular vaccinations by the time they have to deal with H1N1 shots.

<br /><br />with &quot;Dirty Dancing&quot; and then broke them with &quot;Ghost,&quot; died Monday after a battle with pancreatic cancer. He was 57.
<br /><br />&quot;Patrick Swayze passed away peacefully today with family at his side after facing the challenges of his illness for the last 20 months,&quot; said a statement released Monday evening 
<br /><br />by his publicist, Annett Wolf. No other details were given.
<br /><br />Fans of the actor were saddened to learn in March 2008 that Swayze was suffering from a particularly deadly form of cancer.
<br /><br />He had kept <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.f1airjd.com%2Fnike_jordan_22.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.f1airjd.com/nike_jordan_22.html</a> nike jordan 22 working despite the diagnosis, putting together a memoir with his wife and shooting &quot;The 
<br /><br />Beast,&quot; an A&amp;E drama series for which he had already made the pilot. It drew a respectable 1.3 million viewers when the 13 episodes ran in 2009, but A&amp;E said it had reluctantly 
<br /><br />decided not to renew it for a second season.
<br /><br />Swayze said he opted not to use painkilling drugs while making &quot;The Beast&quot; because they would have taken the edge off his performance. He acknowledged that time might be running 
<br /><br />out given the grim nature of the disease.
<br /><br />When he first went public with the illness, some reports gave him
<br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.2uaj.com%2FAir_Jordan_6_ring.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.2uaj.com/Air_Jordan_6_ring.html</a> Air Jordan 6 ring only weeks to live, but his doctor 
<br /><br />said his situation was &quot;considerably more optimistic&quot; than that.
<br /><br />&quot;I'd say five years is pretty wishful thinking,&quot; Swayze told ABC's Barbara Walters in early 2009. &quot;Two years seems likely if you're going to believe statistics. I want to last 
<br /><br />until they find a cure, which means I'd better get a fire under it.&quot;
<br /><br />A three-time Golden Globe nominee, Swayze became a star with his performance as the misunderstood bad-boy Johnny Castle in &quot;Dirty Dancing.&quot; As the son of a choreographer who 
<br /><br />began his career in musical theater, he seemed a natural to play the role.
<br /><br />A coming-of-age <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.newaj.com%2FAir_Jordan_shoes_21.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.newaj.com/Air_Jordan_shoes_21.html</a> Air Jordan shoes 21romance starring Jennifer Grey as an idealistic young woman on vacation with her 
<br /><br />family and Swayze as the Catskills resort's sexy (and much older) dance instructor, the film made great use of both his grace on his feet and his muscular physique.
<br /><br />It became an international phenomenon in the summer of 1987, spawning albums, an Oscar-winning hit song in &quot;(I've Had) the Time of My Life,&quot; stage productions and a sequel, 
<br /><br />2004's &quot;Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights,&quot; in which he made a cameo.
<br /><br />Swayze performed and co-wrote a song on the soundtrack, the ballad &quot;She's Like the Wind,&quot; inspired by his wife, Lisa Niemi. The film also gave him the chance to utter the now-
<br /><br />classic line, &quot;Nobody puts Baby in a corner.&quot;
<br /><br />And it allowed him to poke fun at himself on a &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; episode, in which he played a wannabe Chippendales dancer alongside the corpulent — and frighteningly 
<br /><br />shirtless — Chris Farley.
<br /><br />A major crowdpleaser, the film drew only mixed reviews from <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nike-star-shoes.com%2FNike_Air_Force_25_Supreme.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.nike-star-shoes.com/Nike_Air_Force_25_Supreme.html</a> Nike Air Force 25 Supreme critics, though 
<br /><br />Vincent Canby wrote in The New York Times, &quot;Given the limitations of his role, that of a poor but handsome sex-object abused by the rich women at Kellerman's Mountain House, Mr. 
<br /><br />Swayze is also good. ... He's at his best — as is the movie — when he's dancing.&quot;
<br /><br />Swayze followed that up with the 1989 action flick &quot;Road House,&quot; in which he played a bouncer at a rowdy bar. But it was his performance in 1990's &quot;Ghost&quot; that showed his 
<br /><br />vulnerable, sensitive side. He starred as a murdered man trying to communicate with his fiancee (Demi Moore) — with great frustration and longing — through a psychic played by 
<br /><br />Whoopi Goldberg.
<br /><br />Swayze said at the time that he fought for the role of Sam Wheat (director Jerry Zucker wanted Kevin Kline) but once he went in for an audition and read six scenes, he got it.
<br /><br />Why did he want <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.f1airjd.com%2Fnike_jordan_23.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.f1airjd.com/nike_jordan_23.html</a> nike jordan 23  the part so badly? &quot;It made me cry four or five times,&quot; he said of Bruce Joel Rubin's 
<br /><br />Oscar-winning script in an AP interview.
<br /><br />&quot;Ghost&quot; provided yet another indelible musical moment: Swayze and Moore sensually molding pottery together to the strains of the Righteous Brothers' &quot;Unchained Melody.&quot; It also 
<br /><br />earned a best-picture nomination and a supporting-actress Oscar for Goldberg, who said she wouldn't have won if it weren't for Swayze.
<br /><br />&quot;When I won my Academy Award, the only person I really thanked was Patrick,&quot; Goldberg said in March 2008 on the ABC daytime talk show &quot;The View.&quot; 
<br /><br />Swayze himself earned three Golden Globe nominations, for &quot;Dirty Dancing,&quot; &quot;Ghost&quot; and 1995's &quot;To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar,&quot; which further allowed him to 
<br /><br />toy with his masculine image. The role called for him to play a drag queen on
<br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.2uaj.com%2FAir_Jordan_10.5.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.2uaj.com/Air_Jordan_10.5.html</a> Air Jordan 10.5 a cross-country road trip 
<br /><br />alongside Wesley Snipes and John Leguizamo. 
<br /><br />His heartthrob status almost kept him from being considered for the role of Vida Boheme. 
<br /><br />&quot;I couldn't get seen on it because everyone viewed me as terminally heterosexually masculine-macho,&quot; he told the AP then. But he transformed himself so completely that when his 
<br /><br />screen test was sent to Steven Spielberg, whose Amblin pictures produced &quot;To Wong Foo,&quot; Spielberg didn't recognize him. 
<br /><br />Among his earlier films, Swayze was part of the star-studded lineup of up-and-comers in Francis Ford Coppola's 1983 adaptation of S.E. Hinton's novel &quot;The Outsiders,&quot; alongside 
<br /><br />Rob Lowe, Tom <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.newaj.com%2FAir_Jordan_shoes_22.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.newaj.com/Air_Jordan_shoes_22.html</a> Air Jordan shoes 22 Cruise, Matt Dillon, Ralph Macchio, Emilio Estevez and Diane Lane. Swayze played 
<br /><br />Darrel &quot;Dary&quot; Curtis, the oldest of three wayward brothers — and essentially the father figure — in a poor family in small-town Oklahoma. 
<br /><br />Other '80s films included &quot;Red Dawn,&quot; &quot;Grandview U.S.A.&quot; (for which he also provided choreography) and &quot;Youngblood,&quot; once more with Lowe, as Canadian hockey teammates. 
<br /><br />In the '90s, he made such eclectic films as &quot;Point Break&quot; (1991), in which he played the leader of a band of bank-robbing surfers, and the family Western &quot;Tall Tale&quot; (1995), in 
<br /><br />which he starred as Pecos Bill. He appeared on the cover of People <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nike-star-shoes.com%2FDream_Team.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.nike-star-shoes.com/Dream_Team.html</a> Dream Team magazine as its &quot;Sexiest Man Alive&quot; in 
<br /><br />1991, but his career tapered off toward the end of the 1990s, when he also had stay in rehab for alcohol abuse. In 2001, he appeared in the cult favorite &quot;Donnie Darko,&quot; and in 
<br /><br />2003 he returned to the New York stage with &quot;Chicago&quot;; 2006 found him in the musical &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot; in London. 
<br /><br />Swayze was born in 1952 in Houston, the son of Jesse Swayze and choreographer Patsy Swayze, whose films include &quot;Urban Cowboy.&quot; 
<br /><br />He played football but also was drawn to dance and theater, performing with the Feld, Joffrey and Harkness Ballets and appearing on Broadway as Danny Zuko in &quot;Grease.&quot; But he 
<br /><br />turned to acting in 1978 after a series of injuries. 
<br /><br />Within a couple <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.f1airjd.com%2Fnike_jordan_melo_1.5.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.f1airjd.com/nike_jordan_melo_1.5.html</a> nike jordan melo 1.5 years of moving to Los Angeles, he made his debut in the roller-disco movie 
<br /><br />&quot;Skatetown, U.S.A.&quot; The eclectic cast included Scott Baio, Flip Wilson, Maureen McCormack and Billy Barty. 
<br /><br />Swayze had a couple of movies in the works when his diagnosis was announced, including the drama &quot;Powder Blue,&quot; starring Jessica Biel, Forest Whitaker and his younger brother, 
<br /><br />Don, which was scheduled for release this year. 
<br /><br />Off-screen, he was an avid conservationist who was moved by his <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.2uaj.com%2FAir_Jordan_2009.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.2uaj.com/Air_Jordan_2009.html</a> Air Jordan 2009 time in Africa to shine a light on &quot;man's 
<br /><br />greed and absolute unwillingness to operate according to Mother Nature's laws,&quot; he told the AP in 2004. 
<br /><br />Swayze was married since 1975 to Niemi, a fellow dancer who took lessons with his mother; they met when he was 19 and she was 15. A licensed pilot, Niemi would fly her husband 
<br /><br />from Los Angeles to Northern California for treatment at Stanford University Medical Center, People magazine reported in a cover story.

<br />The 25-year-old Portugal international spent six years at Old Trafford where he became a leading player for the Red Devils.
<br /><br />He won three Premier League titles with United, as well as the UEFA Champions League in 2008, before completing a big-money move to the Bernabeu last summer.
<br /><br />Ronaldo switched to Madrid for a world record ?80million transfer fee, and has carried his excellent form into the Spanish league, although he could not

<br /><br />He admits he does miss Manchester, but does not expect to return to the club at any time in the future.

<br /><br />For the last round of World Cup group games, four matches will be played each day, instead of three.  Two of the eight groups will be in action on each of four days (beginning Tuesday). And within each group, the games will be played simultaneously.  That is to help prevent any match-fixing among teams that might need a certain number of points or goals to go through to the second round.
<br /><br />And goal difference could be a deciding tiebreaker in both Groups A and B Tuesday because of how the teams are bunched after their first two matches.
<br />In Group A, Uruguay and Mexico lead with four points each and will play one another, while France and South Africa - both with one point - square off.  Uruguay has a plus-three goal difference and Mexico plus-two.  France has minus-two and South Africa minus-three.  If Uruguay and Mexico draw, they advance and France and South Africa are out.
<br /><br />For the hosts to make the second round, they would have to score a lopsided win over France and hope for a winner in the Uruguay-Mexico match by a low margin.  While Portugal scored seven unanswered goals against North Korea Monday, South Africa is not likely to find the net that many times against France , and midfielder Macbeth Sibaya knows it.
<br /><br />&quot;Maybe a miracle can happen this time now, but we're just hoping for the best, even though it seems like it's climbing Mount Everest.  But we're going to do whatever is possible,&quot;said Sibaya.
<br /><br />One needs only to recall last year's Confederations Cup in South Africa when a local newspaper printed that the U.S. Soccer team was out of the tournament and that its final game against Egypt was meaningless.  But that night the improbable happened.  The U.S. beat Egypt, 3-0, and Italy lost to Brazil, 3-0, shockingly sending the USA into the semifinals over Italy on total goals scored, as both finished the group phase with the same number of points and the same goal differential.
<br />South African midfielder Teko Modise says if they can't advance, they want to at least have a good showing.
<br /><br />&quot;For us, it's about honor, because we really want to do well against France .  It's one of those that games really, really people will remember, will remember us by,&quot; said Modise.
<br /><br />Teammate Tsepo Masilela, a defender, agreed.
<br /><br />&quot;It's about us.  You know we need to go out there and play a good game and win the game.  We just need to win it for our people, for the fans, you know, for South Africans,&quot; said Masilela&quot;
<br /><br />No host nation has failed to reach the second round of a World Cup.  The starting goalkeeper for South Africa is expected to be Moeneeb Josephs, because Khune Itumeleng was given a red card and sent off in the last game, meaning he has to miss this match.  Josephs said he is ready.
<br />&quot;They say France is not doing well, yes, but if you look at the team it's still quality, quality players on the team.  And it's something to look forward to.  It's been a dream [of mine] to play in a game like this, and here's the opportunity now,&quot; said Josephs.
<br /><br />The French team has been marred by controversy.  Striker Nicolas Anelka was sent home for publicly criticizing coach Raymond Domenech, and the squad boycotted its training session on Sunday in protest.
<br /><br />In Group B, Argentina tops the standings with two wins, for six points, and is the only one of the four teams with a positive goal difference with plus-four.  The Argentines need only a draw against Greece to advance and could advance even if they lose by a small margin.  Greece has three points.
<br /><br />South Korea also has three points, and like Greece, a minus-one goal difference.  The Koreans take on Nigeria which has lost both its matches with a minus-two goal difference.  The winner will most likely reach the second round, provided Argentina beats Greece, while the loser will almost certainly go home.

<br /><br />The Chinese academy of YuanXiao meng outspoken scholar said: &quot;now, part of  the urban planning system, city planning, city planning idea of the planned economy with serious colour, generally all production, light weight gains, light, light weight, environment, short term, heavy ground, light, meet the underground urban disaster will do.&quot;
<br /><br />Analytic personage thinks, heavy rains have become a test of city flood control ability, reflects the concept of urban policy-makers some quick and norm. How to prevent waterlogging product to the society, enterprise production caused heavy loss of life and brought the inconvenience, is not only accurate prediction, and emergency response plan, start to look more at ordinary times, the funds have water conservancy facilities have scientific configuration, all sorts of matching drainage facilities, whether should play a role. However, in real life, a considerable number of urban management will be more time, money and energy use in investment to GDP of such a program, water conservancy and ignore the &quot;performance&quot; buried in the ground. Because the city in water conservancy input are out-of-date, financial support, infrastructure, can cause lack of rare rainstorm attacked city face, can appear weak &quot;rain&quot;.
<br /><br />&quot;Because we are in economic conditions are not plenty of cases, the city developed very quickly, plus some officials are city managers, exactitude to focus on the ground, have a little money may give priority to water supply, sewage, transportation, power supply problems.&quot; ChengXiaoTao said. &quot;in addition, drainage system is not need everyday, year may be used to the flood, but will also not flood every year  to have rain, some people will hold fluky psychology.&quot;
<br /><br />Analysts say that it is in a norm and model of economic development, driven by the drainage works &quot;uncle became grandmother doesn't hurt, no matter.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;Why only after heavy rainfall, flood, some towns accumulation has long problem will get attention, but finally still is not properly solve the urban management involves? The problems existing between the various departments of urban infrastructure construction, municipal administration departments, and water, but want to go into the water system and the scope of management. The city and countryside expanded rapidly expanding derive some problems: this area out of the flood control standard solution to who? How should set?&quot; ChengXiaoTao said, in the process of rapid economic development, regional, between man and nature of the contradiction between water will become more and more complex. In this case, some problems in dispute over trifles, shuffle state to receive timely solve.
<br /><br />More analysts illuminate the drainage system, build the investment is very big, sometimes 1 km to spend millions of dollars of pipeline and millions of dollars money, some local governments should consider achievement and the cost of  building standards, drainage system does not have high design.
