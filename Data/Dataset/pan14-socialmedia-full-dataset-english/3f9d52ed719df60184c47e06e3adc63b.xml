<br />The Columbia Supercomputer, located at the NASA Ames Research Center.
<br /><br />A computer is a programmable machine that receives input, stores and manipulates data, and provides output in a useful format.
<br /><br />Although mechanical examples of computers have existed through much of recorded human history, the first electronic computers were developed in the mid-20th century (1940–1945). These were the size of a large room, consuming as much power as several hundred modern personal computers (PCs).[1] Modern computers based on integrated circuits are millions to billions of times more capable than the early machines, and occupy a fraction of the space.[2] Simple computers are small enough to fit into small pocket devices, and can be powered by a small battery. Personal computers in their various forms are icons of the Information Age and are what most people think of as &quot;computers&quot;. However, the embedded computers found in many devices from MP3 players to fighter aircraft and from toys to industrial robots are the most numerous.
<br /><br />The ability to store and execute lists of instructions called programs makes computers extremely versatile, distinguishing them from calculators. The Church–Turing thesis is a mathematical statement of this versatility: any computer with a certain minimum capability is, in principle, capable of performing the same tasks that any other computer can perform. Therefore computers ranging from a netbook to a supercomputer are all able to perform the same computational tasks, given enough time and storage capacity.<a href="http://es.pan.netcom/juansebastiancastanedatellez/photo/photoid=33864951" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.pan.net/es/p/oo/125046257_5981723_33864951.jpg" /></a><span class="textAlign textAlignCenter"></span>

The parishes of Yaguará, La Guagua (now Palermo), Butchers (today Thessaly), and from the Llano Grande (now should be Campoalegre) to the boundary with the town of La Gaitana. 
<br /><br />Although the document is not very clear in pointing out specific activities, in addition to those mentioned with a great precision on bullfighting, it is assumed that this was especially night revelry with &amp;quot;night of fire and lights&amp;quot; as stated in the minutes. 
<br /><br />Stresses also the record rescued by Villamil Cordovez mojigangas participation, which by theassumptions that are made today to the groups correspond to the new times of the party sampedrina and they should have the participation of all citizens, by rotation and groups of activities.

<br /><br />The world's biggest economy and by far in terms of spending and power the worlds strongest army, the most powerful democracy, and the media centre of the world, plus in many ways the centre of world diplomacy and foreign relations. This easily makes the USA the worlds most powerful country. 
<br /><br />2 Peoples Republic of China 
<br /><br />Massively importantly in terms of power is the number of people a land rules over, the Middle Kingdom has the largest population on Earth. Additionally like the other top 5 on this list, it is a UN Security council member. It also has established itself as of having nukes, a huge army, and is becoming even more of a international power, as of a resource hungry booming economy. Since the global recession affected Japan more, China has now got the world's 2nd largest GNP ( when canceling out misleading totals for currency values, China placed second in GNP even before the recession, but that PPP measure was not as key to world concerns as the measure made when using exchange rates). A momentous achievement for a fairly recent riser in GNP above France and Britain. Before it's economy became larger than that of Japan, it was still 3rd on this list as of other advantages (I made the change in February 2010, the list started in January 2007), but this new 2nd place will surely make nations even more desperate to appeal to China's wealth, and so power. Also this gives China technological advantages via investment ability. The lack of democracy, harms the legitimacy of it's leaders statements though, when speaking of the wider world. 
<br /><br />3 Russian Federation 
<br /><br />The second largest army, and a puppeteer of many Central Asian states. The largest European population, and largest world area, which gives it immense control over itself, and immense levels of independence. The size of Russia helps give it extra resources and abilities that make it such a big power. Russia like the USA has enough Nuclear Weapons to essentially destroy the Earth, while China, France and Britain just have enough to destroy Russia, or the USA. The nuclear option is vital to rankings here, but that is discounted somewhat by the way how they are such a last resort weapon, like how their usage could bring attacks, even devastating ones, from other nations. Russia's economy is a half to a quarter the size of China's at the moment, which means it is more important economically than it was in the mid 1990s, but it is unlikely it could become the world's second largest economy as it was for a while when leading the even larger USSR. 
<br /><br />4 France 
<br /><br />The fifth republic has UN security council membership, is a nuclear power and has alot of influence over Africa. It is also a G7 / G8 / G20 economy, is a leading democracy, and has a quite large army, one of worlds most powerful infact. Added to this EU membership gives it extra power, and helps make it's borders, and region peaceful and stable. France also seems more able to act on it's own accord than Britain. 
<br /><br />5 Britain 
<br /><br />UN security council status, nuclear weapons, G7 economy, a leading democratic state, and a media centre from music to acting, that has alot of influence over the world, especially the English speaking world, as of it's popularity. Membership of the EU adds to it's power. 
<br /><br />6 Japan 
<br /><br />The State of Japan has the third largest economy in the world, it's move from 3rd to 2nd, gave China the prestige I feel to be placed 2nd on the world power list. Japan is a big democracy with a large population, giving it big status, but is rammed in by China, and the USA, so is below France, and Britain, who each have stronger international alliances. 
<br /><br />7 Republic of India 
<br /><br />The most populous democracy, a growing economy, and nuke weapons, as the Second most populous country on Earth it has much moral sway, 
<br /><br />8 Federal Republic of Germany 
<br /><br />The World's fourth economy, and a top 3 in terms of power of EU members in the 27 European Union countries zone, but hampered in influence, as of World War two, and World War One, Which affected Germany's moral position in the world, and reduced German influence on many areas of the world, 
<br /><br />9 Republic of Pakistan 
<br />Second largest Muslim country, largest in the area where most Muslim lands are, has nuclear weapons, and a quite united nationality, in terms of identity, 
<br /><br />Beats Indonesia, as that land is to far away from other Muslim lands so carries less weight, but it mabye could rise if Pakistan fizzles a bit as of spending so much on it's prior millitary dictatorship their military powerbase. While Indonesia, grows as a more civil democratic land. Maybe Indonesia is below, as it was a even more brutal dictatorship to it's people, in the late 1960s too 1990s. While Pakistan was to other nationalities, such as Bangladeshis, during the 1970s, but to West Pakistan people was not as bad as Indonesia's brutal dictators were to it's people in the mid and late 1960s, If Pakistan had not been so bad to Bengalis then it would still have them, and stand no chance of falling behind Indonesia, as it rises. It's power tussles with India, make it keep a high arms budget, but could weaken it long term, as army spending long term is a inefficient use of economic resources. 
<br /><br />10 Republic of Brazil, 
<br />Largest Latin American country in population and area, Largest Portugueese speaking land, good relations globally,

<br /><br />March 8 
<br />International Women's Day: 
<br /> The International Women's Day has been celebrated for more than eight decades. Women and men working for the cause of women around the world commemorate the efforts it has made the achievement of equality, justice, peace and development. Beyond national boundaries and ethnic, linguistic, cultural, economic and political, women from five continents organize various events to celebrate this day and facing the realization that not only half of the bonds, but also of rights they are entitled. The International Women's Day was proposed in 1910 by the German Clara Zetkin, member of the International Union of Garment Workers, during the International Congress of Socialist Women in Copenhagen, Denmark. The date was chosen to honor the memory and witness of the struggle of a group of women who, with great fortitude, occupied in 1857 the textile factory where they worked in New York City to demand equal pay and a 10-hour day work. The owners' response to this complaint was causing the fire on the ground occupied, which killed all 129 obreras.La Organization of the United Nations as an important forum and multinational space favored the support of many other countries holding this day. Through its resolution 32/142, is called on all nations to proclaim, in accordance with their historical traditions and customs, one day each year as United Nations Day for Women's Rights and International Peace.
