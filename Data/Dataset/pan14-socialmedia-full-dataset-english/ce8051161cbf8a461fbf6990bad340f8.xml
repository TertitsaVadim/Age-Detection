To meet these requirements, Crane immediately tried its best to develop a &quot;new generation&quot; of crawler cranes by relying on its rich industrial experience.
<br /><br />The model of the new generation crawler crane is XGC. XG is the abbreviation for Crane; C is the English initial for crawler crane. The optimized design like equal wall thickness technique has been adopted in the main chord tube of XGC series crawler crane jib, dramatically increasing their hoisting capacity compared with that of the original products: the main jib operating conditions has been improved by 10%; the lifting capacities of fly jib and tower arm are both higher than that of their counterparts produced by other companies by 30%. The derrick is equipped with a lifting cylinder that can be used to install crawlers and rear counterweight from ground, while achieving fully self- assembly and self-disassembly. A new switching-over function between working mode and installation mode is added to shield all irrelevant actions from the installation in installation mode, providing a higher safety factor.
