<br /> DEAR FRIENDS,
<br />HELLO N GOOD DAY,
<br /><br />It's tough to escape peer pressure when your friends keep talking about the clothes, the music and the stars. Today, Television defines teen culture. With its barrage of alluring advertisements and captivating shows, it tells you what is cool and what is 'in' and 'out. Let Islam, not the media, decide your dress code, morals, and values.[this is v. imp]
<br /><br />1. Watch what is Halal. Stick to the most &quot;clean&quot; material you can find. TV should be used with discretion to watch educational and insightful programs or decent entertainment.
<br /><br />2. Remove the TV from your room. Having a TV set in your own room encourages you to watch it more. You are less likely to be tempted by Shaytan to watch something indecent when you have a parent, a sibling, or a friend watching with you. Remember, Shaytan loves attacking people who are 'bored', sitting idle, or in a company of bad people. Keep the TV in the main room, where it won't distract you.
<br /><br />3. Adopt and support Islamic media. Hundreds of educational or entertainment multi-media products crafted by Muslim artists, writers, producers, and singers hit the market every year. These cartoons, movies, and songs could be enjoyable for the entire family!
<br /><br />4. Limit viewing time. If you have to watch TV, limit yourself. Write down a number of hours per week and stick to your limit.
<br /><br />5. Keep the box off when you're doing other things. Whether you're eating dinner, doing your homework, or reading a magazine, you dont need the TV to be on at the same time--keeping it on simply encourages you to watch TV more and neglect other activities.
<br /><br />6. Have a TV free get-together with friends. Make the following rule: no one will watch TV or movies in the living room. If you want to go further, make it a rule that the topics of conversation cannot revolve around the latest twist in a soap opera or the most recent plot on a sci-fi show. Play basketball, go for a walk, do anything but watch TV.
<br /><br />its a way to healthy life n healthy thinking.
<br /><br />REMEMBER--if u r an adult--what u do-ur youngsters will follow ..
<br />please be a good example to all in your sorroundings..
<br /><br />its never too late...
<br />start practicing it now...
<br />take care,
<br />all the best,
<br />atiya

<br />GOOD DAY,
<br />THERE R SUM PEOPLE WHO  HAVE DOUBTS ABOUT THE CREATOR--THE GOD--
<br />THEY ASK IRRELAVENT QUESTIONS..
<br />ITS GUD 2 ASK QUESTIONS TO INCREASE UR KNOWLEDGE OR FULFILL THE IGNORANT GAP OF URS.
<br />UNFORTUNATELY PEOPLE ARGUE TO CONDEMN OTHERS-OTHERS RELIGION N TO PASS TIME.
<br />THEY R FOOLING THEMSELVES....NOT ANYBODY ELSE...
<br />CAUSE WE CANNOT FIND OR SEE THE TRESURES HIDDEN IN THE SEA..
<br />UNLESS WE DIVE IN...
<br /> SAME IS WID GODS CREATION--''HE KNOWS-WHAT WE DO NOT KNOW'' 
<br />THEREFORE KINDLY INCREASE UR KNOWLEDGE--
<br />THERE R SEVERAL WAYS N EASY METHODS FOR IT NOW--
<br />AS I HVE WRITTEN IN THIS MAIL OF MINE. 
<br />THANKZ.,
<br />ALL THE BEST, 
<br />ATIYA
<br />.
<br />To sit on the shore and trying to understand the vastness, gravity and secrets of the ocean, is quite difficult rather an enormous task, even if we do try it will remain incomplete. But again we can achieve something from it...THE DESIRE TO DESCEND INTO THE WATERS.
<br />Even still, sitting on the shore one can TODAY do alot of research on the ocean and its marvels lying underneaath by opening and reading earnestly (and understanding it by cross checking and reading various scholars and the AHADITH) the book of oceanography (Quran) and Alhamdolillaha TODAY get audio/visual help in our search of the depths of not just the ocean but any subjected presented to human inquisitiveness.
<br /><br />HOWEVER still it would remain a passive study and still many questions unanswered and one would ESCAPE the actual FEEL, REALISATION and SENSITIVITY on the subject till one doesnt dive into the ocean to understand the first lesson...SWIMMING IN THE OCEAN.
<br />For swimming in a pool, a pond, river or the sea is different, and the individual experience is self informative and many questions are answered automatically by practice similarly is the case in persuing Islam as the deen and following as much as possible (and continuing in our efforts to do better and more) as directed by Allah in the Quran and further showed by the Prophet (saw).
<br /><br />Just as the life guard warns us of dire or perhaps fatal consequences, if we do not follow directions or observe caution during high low tide or various conditions as presented, even though we havent experienced the ACTUAL ourselves, we either take the LIFE-GUARD's warning and save ourselves or just go ahead and fling ourselves into misery and commit ourselves to our own execution
<br /><br />The PROPHET (saw) our life guard, our guide didnt have to show us in actual with visions and practical proofs to instill in our hearts the cautions to take against Allah warnings in the Quran
<br /><br />lest we do injustice upon our own souls. Either we know by looking at the signs during times before us and around us that a little sacrifice will definately rescue us from alot of misery in this world and hereafter, the sacrifices (parhez) thus listed are INFACT EVIDENTLY BENEFICIAL SACRIFICES.
<br />.
<br />For all that is prescribed to us by our RABB (the sustainer) sustains us till end in this life and hereafter. His prescription comes with a Guide (Quran) and the Interpreter and reference manual Huzoor (saw), Ahadiths.
<br /><br />Going by each word of the DUROOD SHARIF, it is actually a prayer for ourselves and not just Huzoor (saw). We are the Ummah and so will be our children Insha'allah, we pray for our children and for Allah's will to be established on earth,where His most beautiful creation is MOST NA-FARMAAN, we appeal so in each salaat..and why not for our Prophet...if we use it to relieve us of pain and misery then its for us follower.....
<br /><br />If one wants to challenge the doctor without hearing his diagnosis and putting it to test of logic and results, is ok for there is no compulsion from Allah but a warning. How much one is better without Allah's rehmat one can judge from one's personal life and the happenings in reality...we just need that eye of conviction to realise the SIGNS the symptoms He is sending us.
<br /><br />with no SIDE EFFECTS at all. Allah reaches out to every soul, even the ones who are in Kuffaar and are indulging in malpractices THE ALMIGHTY, THE BENOVELANT is sustaining them and providing for them, and if it were not the will of ALLAH would they be in existence?
<br /><br />Yes the test, Azmaish gets tougher for the righteous, but by then the muomin doesnt object for he has realised the truth and Allah's benovelence in all of Allah's decisions EVEN IF THE LOGIC BEHIND IS NOT EVIDENT TO his limited human mind
<br /><br />Mine is a very humble contribution on the subject, ALLAH KNOWS THE BEST and definately He is more sad when His creation presses the button of self destruction time and again. May Allah Guide us and forgive us our tresspasses, ameen
<br /> REGARDS,
<br /> ATIYA.

<br />GOOD DAY,
<br />FOR THOSE WHO DO NOT KNOW WHAT IT IS???
<br />IT IS AN ''SURAH'' FROM THE HOLY QURAN--THIS IS THE MEANING OF' AL BAQRA.'
<br />WHEN U READ IT--
<br />U WILL UNDERSTAND ITS ABOUT WRONG DOINGS OF PEOPLE N GIVING THEM THE RIGHT MESSAGE..
<br />BUT ONLY THOSE PEOPLE WILL FOLLOW THE TRUE MESSAGE--WHO WANT TO--
<br />N TRY TO READ BETWEEN THE LINES..N THE LINES TOO....
<br />REST R IGNORANT, N WILL REMAIN SO..
<br />AS THEY WERE IN THE PAST N AS THEY R IN THE PRESENT....
<br />PLZ READ,
<br />THNKZ,
<br />ATIYA.
<br /><br />Al-Baqara
<br /><br />Your God is One God; there is no God save Him, the Beneficent, the Merciful. (163) Lo! In the creation of the heavens and the earth, and the difference of night and day, and the ships which run upon the sea with that which is of use to men, and the water which Allah sendeth down from the sky, thereby reviving the earth after its death, and dispersing all kinds of beasts therein, and (in) the ordinance of the winds, and the clouds obedient between heaven and earth: are signs (of Allah's Sovereignty) for people who have sense. (164) Yet of mankind are some who take unto themselves (objects of worship which they set as) rivals to Allah, loving them with a love like (that which is the due) of Allah (only) - Those who believe are stauncher in their love for Allah - Oh, that those who do evil had but known, (on the day) when they behold the doom, that power belongeth wholly to Allah, and that Allah is severe in punishment! (165) (On the day) when those who were followed disown those who followed (them), and they behold the doom, and all their aims collapse with them. (166) And those who were but followers will say: If a return were possible for us, we would disown them even as they have disowned us. Thus will Allah show them their own deeds as anguish for them, and they will not emerge from the Fire. (167)

<br /><br />So confusing, yet so desirable.....
<br /><br />401.2- BE THANKFUL
<br /><br />1.If you have a bad day at work, be thankful. 
<br /><br />Appreciate that you have a job. 
<br /><br />Some people don't.
<br /><br />2,When you pay your bills, be thankful. 
<br /><br />You can pay them.
<br /><br />3.If you see a gray hair, be thankful. 
<br /><br />Think of the cancer patient in chemotherapy who only wishes for any hair.
<br /><br />4.When you find yourself waiting in line or the recipient of poor service, be thankful. 
<br /><br />Think about the people who have no food to eat at all.
<br /><br />5.When you realize how much work it is to take care of a house, be thankful you have a house. 
<br /><br />Think about those who only wish they had a house to take care of.
<br /><br />6.When you feel like complaining because you have to walk a long distance from your car, be thankful. 
<br /><br />Think of what it would be like not to be able to walk!
<br /><br />7.If you get irritated by other people's anger, apathy, ignorance, bitterness, or insecurities, be thankful. 
<br /><br />Things could be worse. 
<br /><br />You could be one of them!
<br /><br />8.When you think everything in your world is terrible, and you want to give up, think of the people who have been told they only have a certain amount of time to live. 
<br /><br />They don't want to give up.
<br /><br />9.Live life to its fullest. 
<br /><br />Appreciate life. 
<br /><br />401.3- WOMEN
<br /><br />1.Time passes. 
<br /><br />Life happens. 
<br /><br />Distance separates. 
<br /><br />Children grow up. 
<br /><br />2Jobs come and go. 
<br /><br />Love waxes and wanes. 
<br /><br />Men don't do what they're supposed to do. 
<br /><br />3.Hearts break. 
<br /><br />Parents die. 
<br /><br />Colleagues forget favors. 
<br /><br />Careers end. 
<br /><br />4.BUT......... Sisters are there, no matter how much time and how many miles are between you. A girl friend is never farther away than needing her can reach. 
<br /><br />5.When you have to walk that lonesome valley and you have to walk it by yourself, the women in your life will be on the valley's rim, cheering you on, praying for you, pulling for you, intervening on your behalf, and waiting with open arms at the valley's end. 
<br /><br />6.Sometimes, they will even break the rules and walk beside you...Or come in and carry you out. Girlfriends, daughters, granddaughters, daughters-in-law, sisters, sisters-in-law, Mothers, Grandmothers, aunties, nieces, cousins, and extended family, all bless our life! 
<br /><br />7.The world wouldn't be the same without women, and neither would I. When we began this adventure called womanhood, we had no idea of the incredible joys or sorrows that lay ahead. Nor did we know how much we would need each other. Every day, we need each other still.

<br />HELLO,

<br />ITS BETTER NOT TO INDULGE IN THEM ATALL...

<br /><br />Two teenagers asked their father if they could go to the 
<br /><br />theater to watch a movie that all their friends had seen.
<br /><br />After reading some reviews about the movie on the Internet, he denied their request.
<br /><br />&quot;Ah dad, why not?&quot; they complained. &quot;It's rated PG-13, and we're both older than thirteen!&quot;
<br /><br />Dad replied: &quot;Because that movie contains nudity and portrays immorality as being normal and acceptable behavior.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;But dad, those are just very small parts of the movie! That's what our friends who've seen it have told us. The movie is two hours long and those scenes are just a few minutes of the total film!
<br />It's based on a true story and good triumphs over evil, and there are other redeeming themes like courage and self-sacrifice. Even the movie review websites say that!&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;My answer is 'no,' and that is my final answer. You will not go and watch that film. End of discussion.&quot;
<br /><br />The two teenagers walked dejectedly into the family room and slumped down on the couch. As they sulked, they were surprised to hear the sounds of their father preparing something in the kitchen. 
<br /><br />They soon recognized the wonderful aroma of brownies baking in the oven, and one of the teenagers said to the other, &quot;Dad must be feeling guilty, and now he's going to try to make it up to us with some fresh brownies.
<br />Maybe we can soften him with lots of praise when he brings them out to us and persuade him to let us go to that movie after all.&quot;
<br /><br />The teens were not disappointed. Soon their father appeared with a plate of warm brownies, which he offered to his kids. They each took one. 
<br /><br />Then their father said, &quot;before you eat, I want to tell you
<br />something: I love you both so much.&quot; 
<br /><br />The teenagers smiled at each other with knowing glances. Dad was softening. 
<br /><br />&quot;That is why I've made these brownies with the very best ingredients. I've made them from scratch. Most of the ingredients are even organic; the best organic
<br />flour, the best free-range eggs, the best organic sugar, premium vanilla and chocolate.&quot; 
<br /><br />The brownies looked mouth-watering, and the teens began to become a little impatient with their dad's long speech.
<br /><br />&quot;But I want to be perfectly honest with you. There is one ingredient I added that is not usually found in brownies. I got that ingredient from our own back yard. But you needn't worry, because I only added the tiniest bit of that ingredient to your brownies. The amount of the portion is practically insignificant. So go ahead, take a bite and let me know what you think?
<br /><br />&quot;Dad, would you mind telling us what that mystery ingredient is before we eat?&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;Why? The portion I added was so small, just a teaspoonful. You won't even taste it.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;Come on, dad; just tell us what that ingredient is?&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;Don't worry! It is organic, just like the other ingredients. &quot;
<br /><br />&quot;Dad!&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;Well, OK, if you insist. That secret ingredient is organic ... dog poop.&quot;
<br /><br />Both teens instantly dropped their brownies back on the plate and began inspecting their fingers with horror.
<br /><br />&quot;Dad! Why did you do that? You've tortured us by making us smell those brownies cooking for the last half hour, and now you tell us that you added dog poop! We can't eat these brownies!&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;Why not? The amount of dog poop is very small compared to the rest of the ingredients. It won't hurt you. It's been cooked right along with the other ingredients. . 
<br /><br />You won't even taste it. It has the same
<br />consistency as the brownies. Go ahead and eat!&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;No, Dad ... Never!&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;And that is the same reason I won't allow you to go watch that movie.
<br />You won't tolerate a little dog poop in your brownies, so why should you tolerate a little immorality in your movies? 
<br /><br />We pray that Allah (SWT) will not lead us unto temptation, so how can we in good conscience entertain ourselves with something that will imprint a sinful image in our minds that will lead us into temptation long after we first see it?&quot; 
<br /><br />Remember, we become de-sensitized a little bit at a time; it is the small and minimal sins that we forget the most. 
<br /><br />All power and might belongs to Allah, the most high, the great!
<br />The excellence of knowledge:
<br />And the words of Allah, &quot;Allah will raise in rank those of you who believe and those who have been given knowledge,&quot; (58:11)
<br /><br />The Prophet S.A.W. said:
<br />The best of you is he who learnt the Quran and taught it to others. (Bukhari)

<br />HOPE LIFE IS TREATING U GOOD.
<br />THANK GOD FOR HIS BLESSINGS.
<br />I CUM HERE WID A NEW ARTICLE '' TRAIN UR WILL POWER''
<br />ITS INDEED VERY IMPORTANT--IN ALL ASPECTS OF LIFE .
<br />WILL POWER IS UR VISA TO SUCCESS, TO  BUILD UR OWN CONFIDENCE..
<br />ALL THE BEST...
<br />TC,
<br />ATIYA.
<br /><br />Train Your Will Power
<br /><br />Many people fail to get ahead because they have no willpower to do what they know they should be doing. Nor can they help themselves to avoid the things which they know will ruin them. Many such people would like to give up smoking, to stop using drugs, or to avoid affairs outside of marriage. Many find that gambling or alcohol addiction is wrecking their lives. Yet these people have no willpower to set their life on the right course. They feel helpless, and they have to deal with a nagging conscience that pricks them with what they could have done, or should have done.
<br /><br />Yet there are some strong-willed people who seem to be able to do what they know is right and avoid what they know is wrong. Such people experience peace of mind knowing that they are doing the right thing. Their willpower is obviously working for them.
<br /><br />But how do they do it? What is the secret? The secret is that you can train your willpower.
<br /><br />Suppose you made a resolution to skip lunch for a month and actually stuck to your decision. You may save your lunch money, lose a few pounds, develop sympathy for the poor, and give your digestive system a much-needed rest. More importantly, you will strengthen your willpower.
<br /><br />The reason this works is that you teach yourself to avoid lunch even when you know you could have it if you decide. Your stomach may growl, but you won't listen. Thus you train yourself to ignore the calling of your lower physical self and reach for the higher goals of real human achievement. If you stick to your decision day after day for a month you can develop a regular habit of doing the right thing even when your desires are calling for something else.
<br /><br />Every year, for one month, able Muslims go through a similar fasting exercise. They observe the fast as a compulsory practice which God prescribed in His revealed messages, especially in His last revealed book. One of the many benefits they experience from fasting is its training aspect. The willpower they develop in the one month helps them to continue doing the right thing and avoiding the wrong throughout the year. They find the fast such an effective method of spiritual training and of achieving a closeness with their creator that many Muslims also keep some additional, optional, fasts on other days of the year. They eat an early breakfast before dawn and a late dinner after sunset. From dawn to sunset they would have no food or drink; they would also refrain from sexual activity. Whereas the baser selves regularly call for these things, Muslims train themselves with the help of God to fulfill their natural needs in the time and manner which God declared suitable for human dignity and well-being.
<br /><br />During the fast Muslims also train themselves to always avoid lying, cheating, backbiting, and all manner of false speech and immoral actions.

<br />WE ALL WANNA LIVE A BEAUTIFUL N MEANINGFUL LIFE..
<br />ITS GUD TO REVISE THE LIFE'S LESSONS TIME N AGAIN...
<br />HAPPY READING N BEST OF ALL IN LIFE 4 NOW N EVER..
<br />TC,
<br />REGARDS,
<br />ATIYA
<br /><br />ONE. Give people more than they expect and do it cheerfully. 
<br /><br />TWO. Marry a man/woman you love to talk to. As you get older, their conversational skills will be as important as any other. 
<br /><br />THREE. Don't believe all you hear, spend all you have or sleep all you want. 
<br /><br />FOUR. When you say, 'I love you,' mean it. 
<br /><br />FIVE. When you say, 'I'm sorry,' look the person in the eye. 
<br /><br />SIX. Be engaged at least six months before you get married. 
<br /><br />SEVEN. Believe in love at first sight. 
<br /><br />EIGHT. Never laugh at anyone's dreams. People who don't have dreams don't have much. 
<br /><br />NINE. Love deeply and passionately. You might get hurt but it's the only way to live life completely. 
<br /><br />TEN. In disagreements, fight fairly. No name calling. 
<br /><br />ELEVEN. Don't judge people by their relatives. 
<br /><br />TWELVE. Talk slowly but think quickly. 
<br /><br />THIRTEEN. When someone asks you a question you don't want to answer, smile and ask, 'Why do you want to know?' 
<br /><br />FOURTEEN. Remember that great love and great achievements involve great risk. 
<br /><br />FIFTEEN. Say 'bless you' when you hear someone sneeze. 
<br /><br />SIXTEEN. When you lose, don't lose the lesson. 
<br /><br />SEVENTEEN. Remember the three R's: Respect for self; Respect for others; and Responsibility for all your actions. 
<br /><br />EIGHTEEN. Don't let a little dispute injure a great friendship. 
<br /><br />NINETEEN. When you realize you've made a mistake, take immediate steps to correct it. 
<br /><br />TWENTY. Smile when picking up the phone. The caller will hear it in your voice. 
<br /><br />TWENTY- ONE. Spend some time alone. 
<br /><br />OUTLOOK ON LIFE;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
<br /><br />Anger is a condition in which the tongue works faster than the mind . 
<br /><br />You can't change the past, but you can ruin the present by worrying over the future 
<br /><br />Love...and you shall be loved.
<br /><br />God always gives His best to those who leave the choice with Him. 
<br /><br />All people smile in the same language. 
<br /><br />Everyone needs to be loved... especially when they do not deserve it. 
<br /><br />The real measure of a man's wealth is what he has invested in eternity. 
<br /><br />Laughter is God's sunshine. 
<br /><br />Everyone has beauty but not everyone sees it. 
<br /><br />It's important for parents to live the same things they teach. 
<br /><br />Thank God for what you have, TRUST GOD for what you need. 
<br /><br />If you fill your heart with regrets of yesterday and the worries of tomorrow, you have no today to be thankful for.
<br /><br />Man looks at outward appearance but the Lord looks within. 
<br /><br />The choice you make today will usually affect tomorrow. 
<br /><br />Take time to laugh, for it is the music of the soul. 
<br /><br />Patience is the ability to idle your motor when you feel like stripping your gears. 
<br /><br />Love is strengthened by working through conflicts together. 
<br /><br />Harsh words break no bones but they do break hearts. 
<br /><br />To get out of a difficulty, one usually must go through it. 
<br /><br />We take for granted the things that we should be giving thanks for. 
<br /><br />Love is the only thing that can be divided without being diminished. 
<br /><br />Happiness is enhanced by others but does not depend upon others. 
<br /><br />For every minute you are angry with someone, you lose 60 seconds of happiness that you can never get back. 
<br /><br />Do what you can, for who you can, with what you have, and where you are. 
<br /><br />HEY--PLEASE SMILE FOR ME,
<br />THNNKZ..
<br />BYEZ...

<br /><br />FRIENDSHIP------“Friendship is the greatest of worldly goods. Certainly to me it is the chief happiness of life. If I had to give a piece of advice to a young man about a place to live, I think I should say, 'Sacrifice almost everything to live where you can be near your friends.' I know I am very fortunate in that respect. ”
<br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br /><br />THE VALUES------The values we live by are worth more
<br />when we pass them on. 
<br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br /><br />GRATITUDE------  “To speak gratitude is courteous and pleasant, to enact gratitude is generous and noble, but to live gratitude is to touch Heaven.” 
<br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br /><br />CLASS-----“Class never runs scared. It is sure-footed and confident, and it can handle whatever comes along. Class has a sense of humor. It knows that a good laugh is the best lubricant for oiling the machinery of human relations. Class never makes excuses. It takes its lumps and learns from mistakes...Class is comfortable in its own skin. It never puts on airs. Class never tries to build itself up by tearing others down. If you have class, you've got it made. ” 
<br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br /><br />KNOWLEDGE-----“Let us tenderly and kindly cherish, therefore, the means of knowledge. Let us dare to read, think, speak, and write.” 
<br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br /><br />JOY N  MISERY----“I've learned from experience that the greater part of our happiness or misery depends on our dispositions and not on our circumstances.”
