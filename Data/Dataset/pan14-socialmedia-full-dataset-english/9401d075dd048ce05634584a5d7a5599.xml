Part of it i think may have to do with stress. and alot of it. Over the past year ive lost and won so much and all together it has changed me completely. I lost a great love and to make things worse found out she had cheated on me 4 times. Then the same thing happened 1 month later but this time it dug deeper. Also during these times i was dealin with the parents seperation tryin to get rid of failin school and on top of that tryin to mend broken hearts, THen some thing bad happened i was forced to leave home to get money to send my father because he could no longer support him self for a while. I was forced to raise my dad and myself. Also i left a home i had spend 15 years in. I left behind alot. Then the stresses of now adays where school is harder im tryin to get my band up on its feet a dream that has succeeded but then failed many many times. Then we get to the point of my so called best friends datin my exs...the ones that did wat they i already explained. Also in the past years i have lost many loved ones at least 10 all together which has also turned me cold. All im tryin to say is look at the power of stress, tho there is ways to cope each way i try only stresses me more. the onyl good thing that has come out of these past years of stress and pain is my new love Dakota Lynn Praski. She has helped me out with all i need and whenever i hear her voice i turn from that Cold Bastard ive become to that sweet little boy i miss being. 
<br />I love you honey.
<br />Thats my info for now!

What decides whats flirting and whats just plain talking? Cause im sure me and a thousand oother people would like to know. How many times has one went to talk to another member of the opposite sex and suddenly gotten the silent treatment from there girlfriend/boyfriend for supposedly flirting. to me people theres only talking and hitting on. theres no in between. i mean since when has talking suddenly meant that u want to get in the persons pants or want more than just talking? Flirting is a figament of the imagination for people that either want to cause problems or are very easily jealous and want a reason for it. I'll make an example. about 4 months ago me and my now recent ex were hanging out with her friends. This was the first time i met her friends and i wanted to make a good impression. So i joked around and talked to them n tried to make friends with them so that my ex would be happy. Unfortunately it just made her mad. she told me i was supposedly flirting with her best friend. I had no idea i was &quot;flirting&quot; and i asked her wat makes the definition of it. She simple did not know. So please if someone knows the definition of flirting. or agrees that its just a bunch of bullshit. please comment and tell me. Im tired of talking to someone and than suddenly i must like them..arent you? please comment me your opinions.

When we are reminded of these things we recover our emotions and things feel as shaky as they were than. Than we sometimes end up wondering...was it really worth it? I will tell you yes it is. Things always happen for a reason. Though we may not realize sometimes take it for granted things always go into a cycle if u let it go into that cycle. My example is this. I was with a sort of a controlling woman recently a month or so ago. She barely wanted me to go off in music and follow my dream b/c she didnt want me to leave. This although was a kind and sweet reason to want me to stay held me back. When she broke up with me i was able to follow this dream and now i am very happy with a woman that supports my music tastes an is a musican herself. Now some of u may not understand how this is relevent to Painful memories. Well its simply this. When you look back at painful memories you may wonder if its worth it but you may also wonder...what could i learn from it? If you really are conceited or self centered you will think of ways YOU can improve on that situation not the other person that may have hurt you. I shall use another relationship example. Say you get out of bad relationship. Dont spend your whole life tinking about how the other person fucked it up. think about wat you could have done to make it better. be honest with yourself and you eventually shape urself into a better person. But most of all be happy. i believe in one simple thing. You can be happy as long as you truly want to be happy. If you dont dwell on painful memories or mope you shall be happy. Pain is inevitable but misery well thats a choice. Dont worry about the past think of the times you can have in the future if u want to. I guess wat im tryin to say is. The pursuit to happiness if followin your own dream, going with ur gut instinct and learning through painful experiences and moving on instead of moping about them for the rest of your lives. Ive seen so many people un able to move on from bad things that have happened. and this is just some friendly advice to keep people in this painful world going. Be happy. You can be...if you really want to.

But hey iwas pissed off about it. Normality is ovverrated. Its stupid and most of all it is untrue. Wat truly is normal? and who gets to define that? How do we know thats normal? Normality isnt life. If it was everyone would be the same and boring would be all about the world. But ill use a common example of how normality can fail. Love: One older person may say to another : Hey u dunno wat love is bc ur to young to know it. But where does that make any sense ? y b/c they dont have the experience? since when has experienced ever accounted for being in love? or any other ting for that matter. And another thing i wanna get at as im talkin about age is when did age decide our maturity level? or our experience level? Ok true being older means uve had more time to adapt to different things. But ive seen 21 year olds act like babies and 12 year olds have to act like grown adults. Age is just numbers an i dont think people should feel superior just b/c they are older. Now back to normality. Nothing in this world is normal yet people say &quot; this isnt normal&quot; so many times it gets frustrating to see. OK maybe its not kinda like everything else similar to that but what if that one &quot;unnormal&quot; thing is actually normal an everything else is a deviation of it. i dunno. if someone can come up with the definition of normality i would LOVE TO HEAR IT! the only good partially explainable definition of normality is everything n everyone is different and thats the normality of life. Which in a way is right but it needs to have differences in order to have normality. Wow aint that creepy? Anyway the one i had made b4 was much more descriptive n better so bear with me. Comment your thoughts an tell me what YOU think normality is!

Like lake or an ocean beatiful an shimmering until filled with pollution. Like that u have to keep it strong defend aanything from blackening and polluting it and keep fighting for its cause. Or else it will end up tainted. I have been through many many relationships and learned so much, I learn if u dont fight for what you want you will lose it. If you dont treat things right they will die out if you ignore it for your own selfish desire you will find its not there when you need it. You have to keep love strong. Its a deep thing love, something that you cannot buy, sell, but strangley you can give it away or take it without charge. They say all the best things in life are free and Love is definatly one. But it still comes with a price. They price u gotta pay if that person ever decides theyre tired of loving you when you lose them. Or when the love becomes polluted and ugly. Pain is something you must face when interfaced with love, they is pain of loss, worry for the one u love, pain of missing and pain of loving so much you cant stand to have a moment without them. Right now i am in deep love with Melissa Reynolds my g/f and my love. She keeps me happy when im sad but im always theyre prepared to pay the price if need be. Even tho i hope that price never comes. She means alot to me and i feel always will. u need to be prepared in love. Its almost like buying a car. you gotta chekc it over make sure the relationship will last through the toughest roads and make sure the wheels your riding on wont fade out. These are my random thoughts on love.

I dont think so. I dont think any of us on this world really know what we have until about a week after we lose it. We think we'd be fine without it. Then a week passes.. maybe even a month or a year...and suddenly you have to strain yourself just to keep your mind from missing it. When asked if we know what we have we all say yes we do. We dont. Thats a lie. Cause when its gone is when we really know it. We think the day after we lose it...or them that were just fine. They its their loss. That we dont need them. Then it starts to seep in. The glass breaks under your feet and it all falls to pieces into the gravity of reality. Than to cope with this so many people take it into the wrong place. The Bar, Alleyways of drugs and depression, even the corner or streets where they wish to find someone that will love them. But that will only lead them down a dark path of pain an suffering. Than it grows deeper. Get deeper and seeps in more so you start to wallow even harder into those darker places until you can't feel any more pain because you have nothing left to lose. Than it gets to the final point of the wrong turn from loss. You want to go back. You want to start over an travel back down that dark path and recover from everything and climb up the walls of the well you so eagerly plunged yourself into. You have to work to recover. But if you do end up plunging into that well remember to never give up. Never surrender to your lesser demons and never take the easy route. But an even better way is to never give into your lesser demons in the first place.
<br />Never take a trip down that well.  Move on from it. Cry till you have no more tears, than write a poem, if you can't write poems or don't want to, than write an essay or speech or anything that will vent it out. Look to friends family. If you have none than look to me. I promise to give you advice. 
<br />Sorry if i have depressed you

Alot of people would disagree. Those who like it....simple. But is it really simple to try and over complicate love and simplify it? Not really. If you think about it love is the most powerful thing on this planet, it can move people or make them cry, it can stop wars, or start them, it can create lifes, it can create deaths, it can bring happniess, it can make sadness, it can make people stand on mountains and it can push them off the peak. So how can anyone simplifiy it? To make their lives easier. I suppose. But does that make it right? Its like ( and yes i hate myself for using this example) A math equation. you can do the formula and try to over complicate it but if you do the numbers wrong you will have the wrong answer. same thing with love. But its numbers are unpredictable so no one will ever get it right. You can trust, untrust, lie, cheat, do whatever you can and try to understand love but you wont. No one really gets to understanding it until they spend a lifetime with the one they are meant to be with. So after two years can someone really love someone witout actualy contact with them anymore? Yes. Because love is powerful, unpredictable and cannot be controlled by the mind. Only by the heart that rages.

I mean for example a girl leads a guy on telling them that they love them or something and a bunch of really nice sweet shit n gets the guy into it to the point where the guy is willing to give up his whole life to be with them, and than she decides she dont love him. Maybe he will phone her or text her n suddenly she will spazz out. How can someone do that to a person? After all the things the other person does for them no matter what i guess its human nature to take it all for granted. You can give your life, do everything you can for that person give money, love , sacrifice everything you have, but will that person really give a damn? In this day n age the way shit is going i dont think so. People are takin everything for granted and it sickens me. Even taking advantage of your parents seems to sicken me now. Ok ill admit your allowed to but i think it should only be acceptable up to a certain extent. I just think its gottan so ridiculous how the dependant people rely on the independant for all they need. And they dont even thank them for it. Bitches in this world keep growing and growing. i wish we could grow up...

Sure we have our anatomy and mind all covered. But we never fully understand even ourselves. How can we ever expect to know each other, to know what the human race really is until we figure out who we are as people? There are so many different types of people but alot dont even know themselves, they think what theyre doing it what they need to do but when they really look clear into themselves do they still think so? I really don't know what I am trying to get at, which is why these blogs are labeled &quot;Random Thoughts&quot; but I guess one point to make is how can we try to figure out where we came from and where we are going in such things as religion and technology when we dont even know ourselves? Thinking about resources and wars, how can we know ourselves if we know what is going on is horrible, but we dont do a damn thing to stop it. You cant possibly know yourself if you dont look deep down at right or wrong in your consience and make a decision based on what you truly feel is right for you. There are people that always try to prove themselves to other people, always try to help everyone else out, but are they really happy like that or just making a name for themselves? Or is that what they believe is the right path? Then there is people who believe in only serving themselves, because they believe people should look after themselves, but in their hearts is that really how they feel, or have they been stepped on one to many times and are just plain tired of the bullshit. I dont know what im trying to get to. But all i can say is that society has become either one way or another, we can never seem to find a happy medium. I believe that maybe if we could find that happy medium, we would be able to stop all the fighting, and maybe keep a supply of resources. There cant always be take for one group and always give for another. I believe if we can figure this out we can figure out people.

Why in the hell do they exist? so we can move up to something higher? something better? maybe so but what causes them? Its not fate. its not moving onto a higher love, its the people in them. See usually you have one person that gives theyre hearts n souls to the other preson doing whatever they possibly can to make them happy, than u get the asshole that their with that treats them like shit n cheats on them. Do they ever change? Not really. so im wondering. if theyre is something better. how is it better for the person that ends up with the asshole? Do they just end up with other assholes? even so they still wont be happy. Now i hate to get religous. but int he bible they try to teach us about true love and meant to be and marriage n committment and all that good stuff. And yet these days more than prolly half of the population dont end up with that bc of how many people are just plain assholes. What happened to couples being faithful? To being kind to another? Are our emotions really that enraged that we cant even keep our pants on? Or that we have to be completely ignorant to the ones that love us? I'll use an example. My ex. I recently got dumped by a girl. we were together quite a while. lastnite she talked to me. she told me she never loved me never cared about me and had been cheating on me the entire time, than she told me she was gonna go fuck her ex. All i had done, was apologize to her for not talking to her right away after the break up b/c it hurt to much. Now how can a person with a consience do that to antoher person. I dont believe how society has gotten so fucked up. n somehow through all this the nice guys always end up in last n the assholes get the prize. A person can give a person everything they have n do so much for them n yet the person theyre doing it for will be completely oblivious to it bc they love someone else. i just cant stand the world nemore.
<br />if we dont do something about it. theyre will be no love. only broken n frozen hearts that no longer rage with fire but only smoke from the coldness built up within.

<br />p.s  Age is a number it does NOT define your maturity level, how you feel, or how much you have learnt since you were born. anyone who has a problem with this logic. can shutup an write a blgo about it.

Sometimes we are forced to give up what we love, sometimes we have absolutely no choice. And sometimes we dont realize how much we love something until we have lost it... i lost so much lately.... a woman i love with all my soul an cannot be with... i lost her, n at first i had thought it was good for me, an although it turned out that it was, i now miss her more than ever an am afraid that i may never have her again...i miss her warm touch her soft cuddles, her soft lips and the way she said she loved me.... i miss her blue eyes and funny laughter... her cute voice that she would use to always cheer me up and it always made me smile... i miss the things we did together, i miss her love, i miss her beauty, and i miss her.  I gave up on us and now i deeply regret it, my heart aches for her, ive tried to move on but simply cannot. My lesson is to never give up on what you love, n cherish wat u have for as long as you have it, never take nething for granted bc once its gone thats it there is no more chances.... cherish love, cherish hope, cherish what you have... you never kno when it could be gone...

No one appreciates these small things, until all they have left is the memories. Every moment in life is precious, you never know what you can add into that moment to make it special, or how the moment could be torn apart to create an experience so you learn from it. No one realize just how fast life comes and how fast it can be taken away, anyone can die at any moment of any day, and more than often none of us will realize it. We as Humans have become cocky and confident in ourselves and dont realise that with every next breath we take it could end up being our last. So my advice to you all is to love and care for the person that means the most to you, be courteous to people and kind, care about your fellow man and help a person out that is in need, watch a sunset with a loved one or the moon rise, look back on old memories from when you were young and smile, everyday make at least one person feel special. Because all these memories that seem to trivial could end up to be the only things that a person has left someday. When you think of all the times that have gone and past and all the things we as humans need to begin to cherish it comes down to one thing... In a world of life and death...Nothing Is Trivial.

<br />Tell me What You Think.
<br />I am gonna use it for a studio so give me input.
<br /><br />A Soul Wanders alone,
<br />In a labrynth of lost minds,
<br />All he wants is home,
<br />Seems Impossible To Find,
<br /><br />He is Insanity's Martyr,
<br />With Nothing left to give,
<br />The innhibitions of his father,
<br />All he wants to do is live,
<br /><br />But Ive Lost Her Love,
<br />And Ive lost my mind,
<br />Lost my angel from above,
<br />Lost in this labrynth of time,
<br />She holds my heart,
<br />At the end of this maze,
<br />Directions tearing me apart,
<br />But I cannot find my way,
<br />In This Labrynth of Time
<br /><br />Around the corners of these walls,
<br />He's just trying to find himself,
<br />But his love will not call,
<br />He's bound by chains in hell,
<br /><br />He keeps listening for the cries,
<br />Of the wingless angel that has left,
<br />And his body is begging to die,
<br />But his tormented soul refuses to rest,
<br /><br />But Ive Lost Her Love,
<br />And Ive lost my mind,
<br />Lost my angel from above,
<br />Lost in this labrynth of time,
<br />She holds my heart,
<br />At the end of this maze,
<br />Directions tearing me apart,
<br />But I cannot find my way,
<br />In This Labrynth of Time
<br /><br />Ive Lost her Touch,
<br />Ive Lost Her Blue Eyes,
<br />My heart aches so much,
<br />My body cries out at night,
<br />If I could just find the end,
<br />And try my hardest to repent,
<br />All the horrible things Ive done to her,
<br />I pray once again she will be mine,
<br />Somehow ill escape this maze of time
<br /><br />And I will find her love,
<br />With a determined mind,
<br />She's still my angel from above,
<br />Ill burst from this labrynth of time,
<br />She'll always hold my heart,
<br />So when I finally find my way,
<br />Ill will retrieve my lost part,
<br />Ill show her love everyday,
<br />Outside Of These Walls,
<br />Outside of This mind,
<br />Into my heart her beauty Calls,
<br />I have escaped the Labrynth of time.

That is just how it is, everyone we know and everyone we've been associated with has complained or does complain on a constant basis. I'll admit even some of my blogs have been a bit whiney. But what I've come to realize in these past few years is that alot of people that complain will never do anything about it. Alot of people will complain about something happening to them or something that might but yet when they have the chance to do something about it they don't, its either their afraid to, or maybe they just wanted to complain to make themselves grab some sort of attention they aren't getting from somewhere else. I guess the point I'm trying to get across is, if your going to complain than do something about it. Or just do something about it. Nothing will ever change until YOU make it happen. Nothing just goes and fixes itself. Someone or something always has to the change the situation to make it better or sometimes even worse. While were on the topic of better or worse, is there really a better or a worse? A good or an evil? I don't believe so. I think there is only different. Caused by our self concious thoughts or what has been around us our entire lives. How we were raised. Everyone is different and believe in different morals. The only reason we think of good and evil are better or worse is because society has brought us to believe what morals should be. No I am not saying that gives you the right to steal or kill someone. But what im trying to get across is that everyone is different and what seems right to one is wrong to someone else. In this thought I've come to realize people are only different, and that its societies morals and laws that make us decide who's a good person and who isn't. In a relationship for an example a person can believe that one person was better than someone else but yet they were just different, because of how they were either brought up or how they think. If people thought more this way than there would be no judging and we might live in a world thats a better place. I will say again, this does not mean I agree with killing or anything like that, because honestly that is a horrible type of different. I'm just saying that people and everyone is different and that to them things are right and wrong that might not be to someone else and thats what makes us who we are and what makes us unique as people. Now back to complaining. People should never drag things on in a complaint. Yes it is ok to vent. I'm not saying its not. I'm merely stating that if you don't do anything about what you are complaining about nothign will ever change. Sometimes you can't do anything about it, because of certain circumstances, in cases like that it is very important to ask for help or just vent. Ask people for advice on what you can do. But always you should do try to do something about it. Never give up on hope for things because things can always change. Things can always get different and easier for you. As long as you want them to. Happiness is something that can be achieved if you want to. Always remember, pain is inevitable, misery is a choice, and that its only you that can ever change anything for you, but things can always change. Use the anger, the sadness, all the emotions you feel to rage the fire inside you to begin the change of things. Sometimes, thats all it takes. 
<br /><br />Adam.

<br /><br />In a world as cold as the one we live in, trust comes with the price of responsibilty, a responsibility not many have the mental capacity to fathom. People will go through the grooves and folds of western society just to find ways to get ahead of their fellow man. They will drop all responsibilities for their own sordid reasons. How can people say their is a god when all these dark and dreary things happen to the people who do not deserve it, and the best things come to those who are the most self-seeking get everything they have ever wanted. If there is a god it is obvious he does not care, and he sits on his golden throne watching us suffer. So can we really call him god? The one who loves us and cares about us and watches over us? If he really cared why would he let all the hate in the world commence causing us to kick a fellow man to the ground just to get a small step ahead. The world is built on trust. Trust to another man to run things and keep things going without failure, but trust is a dying art that has fallen through the cracks of society, and to replace is has been debauchery, degeneracy, hatred, betrayal, and many more of the darkest things known to man. With this the world has fallen apart. So... All I have left to say is.... 
<br /><br />FUCK THE WORLD

<br /><br />Verse 1
<br />Blackened Water is the purity of my blood,
<br />The way my soul falters,
<br />At the drop of these waterfall floods,
<br />A quarter moon is all the light I have left,
<br /><br />Pre-chorus 1
<br />Hate growing so corruptively,
<br />Losing it all to insanity,
<br />Power of darkness controlling these waves,
<br />As I begin to wonder, will I ever be saved?
<br /><br />Chorus
<br />And the sun, it falls to pieces,
<br />Smoking through my veins,
<br />This toxicity,
<br />Flowing in me,
<br />I have become so cold.
<br /><br />Verse 2
<br />Drowning in a pool of repentance,
<br />That I cannot escape,
<br />Falling through the cracks of oblivion,
<br />And the moonlight is slowly fading, 
<br /><br />Pre-chorus 2
<br />Pain clouding my empty mind,
<br />I’m falling from sight,
<br />Night pulling me pulling me deeper in,
<br />Will I ever clear from my own darkest sins?
<br /><br />Chorus
<br />And the sun, it falls to pieces,
<br />Smoking through my veins,
<br />This toxicity,
<br />Flowing in me,
<br />I have become so cold.
<br /><br />(guitar solo)
<br /><br />Chorus
<br />And the sun, it falls to pieces,
<br />Smoking through my veins,
<br />This toxicity,
<br />Flowing in me,
<br />I have become so cold.

<br /><br />Lost In this empty shell,
<br />Materialized by ashes,
<br />From the bridges I’ve burned,
<br />My Memories are all I have left,
<br />The random thoughts of agony,
<br />And all these past joys,
<br /><br />Nothing could be further from the truth,
<br />As a man who is a free,
<br />A world born in chains, 
<br />A population without a face,
<br /><br />We are so different, yet the same,
<br />Trapped in a world of robots,
<br />Under control by sadistic suits,
<br />Yet though we are so same, 
<br />All we do is fight,
<br />Puppets of our own play,
<br /><br />I have known what it feels to live,
<br />I have known what it feels to fall,
<br />Life is so cruel,
<br />Life is so beautiful,
<br /><br />The things experienced in life,
<br />Are the unforgettable uncertainties,
<br />The rush of a change,
<br />The move of a wave,
<br />The life changing sounds of a newborn.
<br /><br />Born into this world to become another puppet,
<br />Another step forward in the destruction of mankind,
<br />As the oak tree stands tall,
<br />The human race will not.
<br /><br />And unfathomable history,
<br />Rests in the hands of generations,
<br />Oceans may rise,
<br />Fires may become ice,
<br />Death may become life,
<br /><br />The story to remember here,
<br />Is the story of the Three Nevers,
<br />Never Regret,
<br />Never Falter,
<br />And Never Give Up,
<br /><br />Because in the end all you have ever wanted,
<br />Will be right in front of you,
<br />Its up to you to take it. 
<br />And through its taking,
<br />You will have birthed, 
<br />A new beginning.

<br /><br />Falling through this hole,
<br />Lost with nothing but remants of memories,
<br />They leave my heart black as coal,
<br />Remembering that things cannot be the same,
<br /><br />Mind Numbing pain, lost in pieces,
<br />Confused, distraught, I can't see shit,
<br />My sanity that's left ceases,
<br />So I just take another hit,
<br /><br />To ease my mind,
<br />To fall into sight,
<br />My dark thoughts I must fight,
<br />Your beauty clouds my head,
<br />I feel better off when I feel dead,
<br /><br />Smoke fills my lungs,
<br />And my soul falls into blackness,
<br />An inner battle unsung,
<br />Fighting under this sordid pretence,
<br /><br />Darkened soul never to return,
<br />This is a pit of never-ending suffocation,
<br />I fall under the bridges I've burned,
<br />I feel myself die in dilation,
<br /><br />To ease my mind,
<br />To fall into sight,
<br />My dark thoughts I must fight,
<br />Your beauty clouds my head,
<br />I feel better off when I feel dead,
<br /><br />(solo)
<br /><br />I BREAK!
<br />TO MY OWN DEMISE!
<br />MY LIFE!
<br />NOTHING LEFT I CAN DISGUISE!
<br />SO I PASS IT OVER!
<br /><br />To ease my mind,
<br />To fall into sight,
<br />My dark thoughts I must fight,
<br />Your beauty clouds my head,
<br />I feel better off when I feel dead,

Than when you wake up, you wish the dream would just continue. Because the reality your eyes open up to are much more bitter to bear than the imaginary wonderland your subconcious teases you with. Sordid thoughts can fall through the cracks and you can be left with everything you have ever wanted in a dream. To some the best dream could be getting back a loved one who meant the world to them. To others to have more money than anyone else in the world. A fucking psychotic example of the human values balance which teeters more over time. The more money, the more power, the more happiness. This is the way our human race has managed to raise the social bar to. A non-stop infinite chain of generations getting richer and richer, or poorer and poorer. The simple man it seems can never win in a world like this. But he keeps trying. The underdogs of the social pyramid are the hardest working and toughest people. They survive. They survive to make the wealthy and lazy peoples lives better. A cycle of slavery. No wonder we escape to our dreams to find the blessed things that we long so much for. It's the only place they cannot be taken away from you.
