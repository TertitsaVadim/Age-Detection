Chris Pummer, who wrote the write-up claims that, &quot;This industry for the celebrity struck could be the greatest separator of fools and their cash ever.&quot; For more information sure to visit <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3Nwb3J0c21lbW9yYWJpbGlhZGFpbHkuY29tL2FyZS1taWd1ZWwtY2FicmVyYS1hdXRvZ3JhcGhlZC1iYXNlYmFsbHMtd29ydGgtdGhlLWludmVzdG1lbnQv" target="_blank">commercial autographed baseballs</a>.<br /><br />He lists premium coffee to go and cigarettes as a couple of other &quot;greatest wastes of cash.&quot;<br /><br />I agree with Pummer that sports memorabilia is a waste of funds if you get the wrong player or if you buy one thing that is fake.<br /><br />But the bottom line is that the industry for autographed sports memorabilia and collectibles is large. Authentic autographs are difficult to get, high-priced, and there are limited amounts available.<br /><br />Take Pete Rose, who indicators each weekend in Las Vegas. There is such a demand for his autographed memorabilia that his jerseys, baseballs and other products regularly bring excellent cash -- no matter how significantly he indicators.<br /><br />When Pete becomes unable to sign -- or he dies, his current, authentic autographed memorabilia will double or triple in worth.<br /><br />Pummer mentions how a $700 Barry Bonds ball is worthless. I have to agree with him on that 1. Sports memorabilia shopping is all about choosing the right player (and Bonds is not the correct player). When a Willie Mays autographed baseball at the moment sells for around $250-$300, why would you devote $700 on a Bonds baseball?<br /><br />Mays is proven, he is the greatest residing baseball player on the planet -- do the math. Even when Bonds surpassed Willie's property run record, he did not grow to be a lot more collectible than Willie Mays. Bonds will by no means be far more collectible than Mays and his baseballs will in no way be worth more.<br /><br />Sports memorabilia collecting is equivalent to the stock market. The athlete is the stock. You have to make sure the athlete has good fundamentals, management, and you also have to investigate how the marketplace values them.<br /><br />Joe Montana, for instance, is a single of the all-time best selling autographs in the business. He is a verified athlete, no steroid scandals, and individuals really like him. He does sign frequently, but there is such a enormous demand for Joe Montana memorabilia, it does not matter.<br /><br />Sports memorabilia is not a waste of cash, it is an investment if you know what you are getting. Educate yourself on the market place -- for instance, purchasing on eBay if you do not know how to spot fake autographs is a undesirable thought. There are tons of sellers on eBay that nonetheless sell fake autographs even although a few forgers went to jail as a outcome of the FBI's Operation Bullpen over three years ago. For more information sure to visit <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3Nwb3J0c21lbW9yYWJpbGlhZGFpbHkuY29tL2FyZS1taWd1ZWwtY2FicmVyYS1hdXRvZ3JhcGhlZC1iYXNlYmFsbHMtd29ydGgtdGhlLWludmVzdG1lbnQv" target="_blank">commercial autographed baseballs</a>.<br /><br />If you educated oneself on authentic autographs, identified excellent players to invest in, and studied values of items based on what they are at present selling for, then you could see better returns than your stock market place portfolio -- effectively, maybe at least greater returns than the S&amp;P 500 and these horrible mutual funds!
