<br /><br />Beach Volleyball, Jogging &amp; Tug-of-War
<br /><br />For outdoor sporting enthusiasts, wanting to stay on the beach, indulge in a bit of activity that will get your heart-pumping and the adrenaline positively rushing.

<br /><br />Beach Sepak Takraw
<br /><br />Sepak takraw or otherwise known as kick volleyball is a cross between soccer and volleyball, a fast-growing and popular sport in Asia. Also called takraw for short, it is played on a badminton doubles-sized court. Similar games include bossaball, footbag net, footvolley, jianzi and sipa. For those of you just craving for a little bit more than the ordinary dose of challenge, try out this local sport on the sandy beach as you take in the fresh ocean scent of the Strait of Malacca.

<br /><br />Indoors or outdoors – board games do have the power to entertain! From the classic chess and checkers, snake and ladders for the children and to various other new engaging board games, enjoy a fun afternoon catching up with friends and family in an environment of friendly competition and thrills!
