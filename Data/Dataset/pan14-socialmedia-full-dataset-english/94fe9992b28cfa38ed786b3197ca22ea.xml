They are about 70-strong. As they surge around me, one young woman stops and, standing very close, begins to tell me about a childhood incident and how it has affected her view of life. The crowd leaves us behind. Should I turn and walk with her? She seems so intent.Another woman tells me about a lost love. Someone else, about how a book changed his life. The stories mostly concern private rites of passage and life-changing events and relationships. Things could get embarrassing, with all these confessions and revelations. These people act as if they know me. Suddenly we're plunged into a relationship. Then they're off again.These intimate, personal stories, lost words, unasked-for intimacies, heel-to-toe slow shuffles and wild runs up and down the ramp are all part of These Associations, which, their participants tell you, is a piece by Tino Sehgal, dated 2012. I have seen many of his works, from the gallery attendants who burst into song, singing "This is so contemporary, contemporary, contemporary" in the German Pavilion at the 2005 Venice Biennale, to This Variation, in the current Documenta in Kassel, which involves song, dance and mini-lectures to an audience who stumble about in a darkened room.- canvas printsThese Associations is no less complex, affecting and disconcerting. At one point the walk speeds up and I am running to keep up with the story I am being told. Then the crowd whirls like a hive of maddened bees. Now they all seem to be chasing an invisible rabbit. The light keeps changing along with the atmosphere and the performers' routines. At one point the performers loiter and sit, whisper and hiss and sing, coming together as a choir, their words soaring towards the roof. The words themselves – something about the technological age and nature, nature, nature, human nature – get lost in the echoing space.Within an hour, on the first day, visitors are already joining in. Children run with the pack of performers and snake through Sehgal's milling throng. Soon, I am sure, visitors will be mingling with performers and tell their own stories. We're all participants now. A bystander said: "This is Tino's opera." We're on stage too.I could barely drag myself away to write this, and I cannot wait to get back. These Associations is a great antidote to the ever more spectacular, large commissions the Unilever Project has produced. It is also a rejoinder to all the brouhaha and corporate fascism and jingoism of the Olympics.These Associations is one of the best Turbine Hall commissions. There are no objects: we are the subject. It is about communality and intimacy, the self as social being, the group and the individual, belonging and separation. We're in the middle of things. It is marvelous on asiaartshop.com.Bringing Van Gogh to life: Watchout powers large-scale projection as new show tours the worldLabel: canvas artFurther enhancing its reputation as a core multimedia technology for visitor attractions, Dataton’s WATCHOUT is being used as the image-control backbone for ‘Van Gogh Alive – The Experience’ – a travelling exhibition that redefines audiences’ appreciation of fine art.Conceived and executed by Australian-based Grande Exhibitions, Van Gogh Alive sees some of the painter’s most famous works displayed on huge projection screens as part of a uniquely engaging multimedia show. The artist’s paintings are inter-cut with full-motion video and photographs of some of the locations that inspired him between the years 1880 and 1890, and there are more than 3,000 images in all.The show is synchronised to a powerful classical score, and the whole automated production is triggered and controlled by WATCHOUT™. “Grande Exhibitions had used WATCHOUT before on other projects so it was the natural choice for Van Gogh Alive,” comments Dean Stevenson of Interactive Controls, Dataton’s partner for Australia and New Zealand.“When Van Gogh Alive made its debut we built and supplied a 30-output system to drive content to all of the projectors. As well as ensuring that all the media are in sync, WATCHOUT also allows Grande to automate the processing so that a group of projectors can go from showing individual images to a single one and then back again. This is essential for a show like Van Gogh Alive where the element of surprise is key – you never know what you’re going to be looking at next, or where it will be!”Rather than edge-blending images together, the design of Van Gogh Alive places screens a short distance apart from each other, with some screens at right angles and others in parallel. This encourages visitors to move around and between the screens during the show, exploring nooks and crannies, viewing favourite pictures from a new perspective, and immersing themselves in the vibrant colours of Van Gogh’s paintings.“The idea of immersing the audience in art is key to Van Gogh Alive,” Stevenson continues. “You see projected images everywhere – not just in front of you and behind you but also above you, on the ceiling, and even on the floor beneath your feet. So the show really uses WATCHOUT’s image-processing capabilities to the full.”More news about canvas prints on asiaartshop.com.Another key attribute of Van Gogh Alive is that the show can be scaled to suit each installation. Having had its world première at the ArtScience Museum, Marina Bay Sands in Singapore last year, the show is now playing at Antrepo 3 in Istanbul, Turkey, and at the Arizona Science Center in Phoenix, USA.“For the Phoenix installation - Interactive Controls built and supplied a new system that has 10 multi-output computers running the show, each with its own licence of WATCHOUT Version 5,” says Stevenson. “As Van Gogh Alive tours the world Grande will be able to tailor the system and use different configurations of WATCHOUT, depending on the exact configuration of screens at each host venue.”Fredrik Svahnberg, Marketing Director, Dataton, comments: “Gallery and museum owners are increasingly looking to mutlimedia shows as a way of engaging their visitors in new and exciting ways, and we are delighted to say that WATCHOUT is at the heart of many of them.“Van Gogh Alive is a perfect example – a wonderful union of fine art with modern science that allows every detail of the artist’s work to be viewed in ways which simply would not have been possible only a few years ago.“It is a privilege for Dataton to be associated with such a prestigious, inspiring and educational project, and we look forward to following Van Gogh Alive all over the world in the years to come!” Welcome to asia art shop to select what you like.Source: http://www.asiaartshop.com/Bringing-Van-Gogh-to-life-Watchout-powers-large-scale-projection-as-new-show-tours-the-world & http://www.asiaartshop.com/Tino-Sehgal-These-Associations-review

Permeated with the spirit of the will of the painter, the performance of the artist's rich spiritual world and the real feelings. This is what we call ink emotions. The classification of the use of the basic theory of Chinese painting brush roughly two hard and soft mill, a brush, although it is a small light body items, but its contribution to the history of painting and calligraphy in Chinese traditional culture is huge.1. A brush: we all understand that there are a variety authored method, but a brush writing practices of the most important artistic expression, vivid lines, light and heavy, a radius, length, right and wrong so that the intensity and pace, no not by brush and achieve the artistic effect 's. Through the rational use of the brush, let it play a role to achieve the desired effect. Addition to authored loose, fingers force, but also to explore the tiny action when the brush, should strive to master, since closing concealment and revelation, the positive side, the radius of the turn, the severity and speed of other basic essentials, which is considered a brush could . A brush there faujasite front, because the brush as a whole is composed by vellums front Ying tip around a brush to take into consideration is the equivalent of the front Ying, can’t cut brush walking side or both sides, while the loss of the brush Several other surface should brush octahedral front have to brushed it is skill.2. Min brush: the front talked brush head first to nothing Ying, today to talk about the brush also known as sub-brush, that both long mill brush or brush should be seen as a short mill 10 points brush when the brush is generally only 1-3 minutes with a document, such as the tip length of 5 cm, divided into 10 aliquots, 1 point brush is 0.5 cm, 1-3 stars document can only be called a sub-document, 2 points T, 3 sub brush. Because the main cents and vice cents Feng Ying are concentrated within 3 brush, simply brush can only use one-third of the total length of the best point, of course, does not deny the necessary over three brush to 5 brushes, and even more.3. Brush the size should be based on the size of the written word:Often say that the appropriate sums minuscule, small brush should not write characters this is correct. Students Miaohong word affixed with a capital letter, inch Kai, while the capital letter is about 7 square centimeters word, brush in about written about five centimeters long, about 1 centimeter diameter (coarse) brush is appropriate. Inch Kaizi is 3.3 cm2 word optional tip length of 4 cm and 0.7-0.9 cm in diameter between the size of the brush is appropriate, in short, the size of the document based on the size of the words may be, otherwise damage brush, writing effect Not so good.4. Brush options:The brush should be based on the body of the book, the font size and personal habits to choose.5. Calligraphy and painting with a brush: calligraphic painting a brush more stringent, all be able to write a good brush for painting class the this manual method brush with the drawing brush is generic. Some brush cannot be written with a brush, such as: the leaf ribs, according to the pattern, hook line, a brush, Kyu brush, red brush the specialized painting with some special brushes such as bald Qi-tip brush, especially hard bristles brush and, apart from the basic common. To the good works of the painter, brush quality equally demanding.The relationship between the brush and rice paper: size of brush in the friction intensity of rice paper, should pay attention to the paper quality to abuse rough paper, rugged paper, a special hardware newspapers, brushes injury will shorten the life of the brush. As the Yang Hao brush, pure Langhao brush, because it touch rich natural elasticity the best for Yaxian paper, etc. soft paper. Various facultative mill brush suitable writing paper mulberry paper, hemp paper, hard paper processing paper, etc.. In this way, the effect can extend the life of the brush.

<br /><br />People to feel more and more emphasis on the role of accessories in the bedroom, especially painting, it is nice to have the personality, which embodies the cultural taste and artistic accomplishments of the master. But you really would choose the art? Although it is a very personal thing, but the basic principle to follow from these principles, not only failed to improve the taste of the bedroom, would give the house to the original style lost. Asiaartshop.com believe the painting is not good or bad, only suitable or unsuitable. Suitable, even if a small painting but also as part of the home, to the overall consideration, which means that no matter the color, pattern or form must be unified and the overall style.
<br /><br />A. Determining painting style
<br />Painting style according to the style of decoration and the main furniture may be the best style of painting in the same environment, do not have a big conflict, otherwise you will feel cluttered and discomfort, such as Chinese painting and modern abstract painting in the same room door will be very nondescript.
<br /><br />B. Identification of painting the main color
<br />The painting's main role is to regulate room atmosphere, so it needs to contrast with the environment, from this perspective, it is mainly affected by the main color of the room and seasonal factors. View from the room tone, generally can be roughly divided into white, warm colors and cool colors, mainly white room decorative painting not much taboo, but warm colors and cool colors for the main body of the room you need to choose the opposite tone of the painting, If the room is warm tones of yellow, then painting the best choice of cool colors such as blue, green, and vice versa. Seasonal factors, the painting is the most convenient to adjust the temperature in the home decorations, suitable for winter warm summer suitable for cool spring suitable for green, yellow-orange in autumn, of course, the premise of this change is that the room is a white or nearly white light color.
<br /><br />C. Determine pattern painting style
<br />Pattern and style of the painting on behalf of the owner of the private perspective, regardless of the election is not important what is important is to try and space functions consistent, such as the living room is the best choice for the painting of the atmosphere, the pattern is the best aesthetic landscape, still life and figures, abstract modernist good, too personal and artistic works are not suitable for this space, because it is the place of highest exposure, or a conservative point as well; bedroom pure private space can be free to play, but to pay attention to Do not choose the style too strong painting.
<br /><br />D. Determine the size of the painting
<br />Painting size according to the size of the room characteristics and main furniture, such as the living room, the height of the painting in the 50 to 80 cm is appropriate length depends on the length of the wall or the main furniture may be the main furniture in general should not be less than 2/3, such as a sofa long 2 meters, The painting overall length should be about 1.4 meters; small kitchen, bathroom, etc., you can choose the height of about 30 cm decorative painting. If there is enough wall space and want to highlight the artistic effect the best choice for large format paintings, so the effect will be very prominent.
<br /><br />Chinese-style room is the best choice for Chinese painting and watercolors, gouache a gentle disposition painting, pattern best traditional impressionistic landscapes, flowers, birds, fish and insects, but it should be noted that If you choose watercolor, do not exceed 57 × 79 cm; European-style room is generally what kind of decorative painting, but to pay attention to the small indoor area, such as the construction area is 15 sq m, choose oil paintings, the best selection of classical pattern, still life, flowers, etc. can, abstract art is not suitable for this space, because the abstract exaggerated tension, it will make a small space appear oppressive, so it is more suitable on a larger living room.
