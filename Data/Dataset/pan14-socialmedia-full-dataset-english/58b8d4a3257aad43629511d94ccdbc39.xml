From making the experience for the patient much more efficient and effective, to saving the NHS money, and reducing the amount of administration, healthcare systems are revolutionising the way that the NHS runs and the way that patients receive treatment.<br /><br />Here are 7 ways in which IT is used in medical environments.<br /><br />1. Patients no longer have to wait several weeks for their <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL0RyU2ltb25XYWRlLmNvbQ__" target="_blank">locum gps</a> records to be moved when they move house and change doctors thanks to electronic patient records. Test results can now be viewed by patients at home by logging into secure websites. If a patient has medical treatment in a different town, then their medical records will be instantly updated, so that their GP knows what treatment they have had. This means that records are always up to date and accurate so that whoever is treating the patient knows about allergies and reactions.<br /><br />2. Patients can have their prescription sent directly to pharmacy of their choice electronically by their GP. This reduces the amount of paper used, and so is much better for the environment. Approximately 70% of prescriptions issued are repeat prescriptions, using IT means that patients won't need to visit their doctor to get a repeat prescription. This saves both time and money.<br /><br />3. Hospital Staff can view x-rays on computer, meaning that images such as ultrasounds and X-rays taken in different places can be stored digitally and seen immediately without having them having to be physically sent by mail or courier. This is much more efficient, as previously around 1 in 5 X-rays went missing.<br /><br />4. Patients can make hospital appointments at the time of their choice, and at the hospital most convenient to them. Cancellations can be made and appoints rescheduled online. This dramatically reduces the number of people who fail to attend their appointment, and means that appointments can be seen in real time.<br /><br />5. Dentists and GPs can see what treatment a patient has had in hospital, and what medication they are on, and so can prescribe the right medication, and perform the most appropriate treatment based on the patient's medical history.<br /><br />6. Dedicated healthcare systems are needed to ensure the smooth running of surgeries, pharmacies and hospitals. These computer systems need to be able to retain millions of records of patient data, be able to cope with the demands of modern hospitals and services and be easy to use. If healthcare systems are difficult to use and unreliable, then staff will be reluctant to use or trust them.<br /><br />7. With all patient data stored electronically, and easily shared between departments, security is of paramount importance. A patient will only have to provide their details once whilst being treated, as their records will be updated and available to all staff who need access to them. This means that different staff need different levels of access. A dentist wouldn't need to be able to see ultrasound results for example.<br /><br />Hopefully you won't need to see a doctor, or go to hospital, so you may never see the benefits of these improvements. However, if you do need the NHS, you can be sure that the service has improved, and processes have become more efficient, all thanks to better use of IT and healthcare systems.

Is Croatia protected for single gals? Really should I <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3JlbnQtYS1jYXItcmlqZWthLmNvbS9pem5ham1saml2YW5qZWF1dGEuaHRtbA__" target="_blank">rent a car rijeka cijene</a> or get manifeste transportation? My reply may well sound pretentious but I dare to say, it is not only risk-free but it really is almost certainly the safest region in Europe.<br /><br />To prove my assertion I've located official information that there are less than 10 homicides a yr in Croatia. I can guarantee you that Croatia is one particular of the exceptional areas on the earth the place you never have to view your again.<br /><br />Women will not encounter specific hazard in Croatia. Croatian males are normally very gallant and great-mannered. Females on their very own could sometimes be stressed and adopted in good coastal cities like Rijeka, Split, Zadar and other folks. Often neighborhood bars and cafes (called &quot;kafic&quot<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/wink.gif" alt=":)" /> might appear like private men's clubs and a ladies by yourself may well experience unpleasant with sudden silent and chilly stares. But I counsel to behave cool in these situations.<br /><br />Feminism has not reached satisfactory level in Croatia. There are only handful of gals in management place, specially in political life. Females are still dedicated to housework and youngsters treatment but little by small Croatian women are attaining the place which they merit.<br /><br />Girls in Croatia offers a higher priority on fantastic searching, hoping to buy the most stylish clothes they can pay for. Topless sunbathing is acceptable and the naturist design is obvious in just about every component of Croatia.<br /><br />If any church visits are prepared, preserve in brain that girls are expected to put on tops with sleeves and bottoms that fall beneath the knees. Churches and some museums article their gown codes and they will switch you away if you don't follow these policies.<br /><br />Below are some issues and phrases you really should under no circumstances use when checking out Croatia, or else you will locate oneself in problems. Do not call it Yugoslavia! Please don't do that! Recall all those wars over there about 10 a long time in the past? Keep in mind viewing Dubrovnik shelled on Tv? That wasn't a Hollywood movie. That was for true. Nicely, they won that war. Or relatively, the &quot;previous Yugoslavia&quot; army chosen up and still left Croatia to by itself. Croatia has been its personal region ever since. If you pay a visit to there, really don't ever get in touch with it Yugoslavia.<br /><br />My concept is: Occur to take a look at this little place and really feel protected to go in which you want. Even if mugging and thefts are not a dilemma and even you can securely wander in any city at night time, use your prevalent awareness, as always.

Locum tenens jobs fill positions that are vacated temporarily. Although this is a temporary position, the person must still follow all rules and regulations. They are also expected to manage or be managed the same as the person they are replacing.<br /><br />An employee may become a substitute in several ways. There are many agencies that serve to <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL0RyU2ltb25XYWRlLmNvbS93ZWxjb21l" target="_blank">locum gps</a> fill positions needed by companies. They could be a freelance who applies for positions that are advertised as short-term. They also may work as a substitute at several jobs as in the case of a teacher who may work several substitute teaching jobs at different schools.<br /><br />There are several instances a hiring company will look to fill a vacated position with a short term hire. In some cases an organization may be unsure of the long term finances they have to work with, such as some government funded agencies. Vacations, extended sick leave and unexpected emergencies may leave an open position to be filled. There are businesses who hire temps and will retain them as permanent only if they prove their worth.<br /><br />The same benefits paid to permanent employees are usually lacking here. A substitute teacher would not entitled to insurance policies that a staff teacher would. They would not be accruing pension or tenure. Sometimes these positions are on an as needed basis, with the temp not knowing exactly when they may be needed again. The pay scale is often less than a permanent employee of that organization.<br /><br />There are advantages as well. Since most locum tenens are professional positions they can be used on a resume. They are also a way for the employee to get comfortable in the line of work they are looking for. The concept works well for semi-retired persons who do not want to be tied down to a particular company or work full time again.<br /><br />Disadvantages also are present for the hiring body. Sometimes it is felt that locums perform less than high quality work. In the case of a lawyer for example, this may be due to them not having developed a good knowledge of past histories. Also due to the flexibility required by the position, a better temp may demand a higher salary, which may have to be paid due to the importance of filling the position.<br /><br />Advantages to the company hiring a locum tenen include filling a position when they are sure the permanent employee is returning. Less stress on existing staff occurs if they are not required to pick up the duties of an absent employee. In a situation where an agency is unsure of its future, this provides an alternative to guaranteeing high incomes to employees.<br /><br />Locum tenens are a growing commodity in most countries. The concept is becoming more and more popular and widespread. It enables a hospital, school, legal agency to keep functioning when they are short staffed or in temporary need of help.

In spite of this, though, Montenegro offers a rich history and an interesting culture. It has many beautiful attractions, as well, which include four spectacular Montenegro national parks and  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3JlbnQtYS1jYXItcmlqZWthLmNvbS9Fbi8_" target="_blank">rent a car rijeka</a>.<br /><br />The Durmitor National Park is the largest of all the Montenegro national parks, covering an area of roughly 39,000 hectares.<br /><br />Established in 1952, the park is the site of 18 glacial lakes, the biggest of which is the Crno Lake or Black Lake, as well as blue rivers, deep canyon valleys and impressive mountains. There are various necropolises, medieval monuments and old churches within the park, too.<br /><br />Because of this, the Durmitor National Park has been included in the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites - one of only two in Montenegro. It is the most popular national park in the country, as well, providing tourists with opportunities to go horseback riding, rafting, kayaking and hiking.<br /><br />The Skadar Lake National Park has a large area, too. In fact, the Skadar Lake (also known as Lake Scutari) can reach up to 530 square kilometres at times, depending on its water level, making it the biggest lake in the Balkan peninsula. Of all the Montenegro national parks, the Skadar Lake National Park is the one most known a birdwatcher's paradise since it is home to many swamp birds, including the rare Dalmatian pelican, which is also the symbol of the park.<br /><br />Aside from birdwatching, the park is also a great place for windsurfing and spelunking. It can provide a great gastronomic experience, too, since the towns of Virpazar and Rijeka Crnojevica, which are famous for their restaurants, and the vineyard of Crmnica can be found on the lakeshore.<br /><br />You can enjoy an unforgettable dining experience within the Lovcen National Park, too, particularly in Njegusi Village, which manufactures the best ham and cheese in the country. What sets this park apart from other Montenegro national parks, though, is the fact that it is the site of the Njegos Mausoleum, one of the most important cultural monuments in Montenegro and the masterpiece of Croatian sculptor Ivan Mestrovic.<br /><br />Finally, there is the Biogradska Gora National Park. Although the smallest, it is by no means the least of the Montenegro national parks. In fact, it is just as popular because of the developed tourist facilities around Biogradska Lake. It also contains a 1,600-hectare rainforest - one of only three remaining rainforests in all of Europe.<br /><br />Indeed, these Montenegro national parks are the gems of Montenegro, and are certainly great places for holidays. So whether you want to have an exciting adventure or just get away from all the hustle and bustle of work and city life, don't forget to consider Montenegro as one of the destinations for your next vacation.

Actually, it is highly recommended that you perform healthy exercise [url=<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2FRNYTalk.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://RNYTalk.com</a><br />]Gastric Bypass[/url] and eating habits for the long term rather than banking on this &quot;shortcut&quot; first. In addition, a <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL1JOWVRhbGsuY29t" target="_blank">gastrick bypass surgery</a> for weight loss can be very costly too.<br /><br />But if you have the budget and need, you can go for the following options.<br /><br /><strong>Stomach stapling</strong><br /><br />This surgery makes your stomach smaller. This is because when you eat a little, your stomach feels fuller. Therefore, you can prevent yourself from overeating. In this case, if you eat too much with a small stomach, you can fall sick.<br /><br /><strong>Lap-band</strong><br /><br />Lap-band surgeries are less drastic. A small and adjustable band is placed around the upper part of your stomach. This in turn creates a smaller pouch which limits the amount of food you can eat at one time. Therefore, it is almost the same as the previously described surgery, stomach stapling. But the problem with making the stomach smaller is that patients tend to cheat more often because the stomach is not really constricted in term of size. This brings us to another surgery option, the gastric bypass.<br /><br /><strong>Gastric bypass</strong><br /><br />In this surgery, doctor takes your stomach and creates a small pouch to restrict the amount of food that can be ingested. Then he or she attaches your small intestine directly to this small pouch. But the risks involved are greater too. For example, 10 to 20 percent patients who did this surgery have to have follow-up operations because of complications. Statistics have also shown that more than one third of the patients who did gastric bypass develop gallstones!

But pulling together a top-notch virtual team doesn't come without challenges.  There is the question of finding quality technology that everyone can work with, concerns about the accountability levels felt by each team member, and the difficulty of creating foundation expectations across the board.  But the biggest challenge is the lack of connectedness between team members.  Without creating the connections, a virtual team can't do what it needs to; function as a cohesive unit. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2Fuc3dlcnMueWFob28uY29tL3F1ZXN0aW9uL2luZGV4P3FpZD0yMDEyMDMyMjA3MDk0N0FBWlBxcUU_" target="_blank">Who is TEAM INA</a>?<br /><br />Most importantly, a virtual team won't bring true collaborative genius to your organization unless unshakable trust is established.   So the question remains:  How do you build trust in an environment where shaking hands, watching each others' expressions or body language cues and knowing one another's' backgrounds, methods and idiosyncrasies just isn't possible?<br /><br />It's all in the team-building.<br /><br />Knowing how to build a productive, integrated, low-turnover team is key to its success.  Follow these seven steps and your team will be on the way to connectedness and profitability:<br /><br />1. ATTRACT THE RIGHT TEAM MEMBERS:  Strong team builders realize that they are not only looking for a potential team member who has specialized skills and talents, but that they also need to assess the &quot;fit&quot; of  the prospective team member with the team as a whole.  Skills and quality level of work are important, but the real key to building an exceptional virtual team is to find team members who fit the culture of the team.  Many people will have the right skills - few will have the perfect &quot;fit&quot;.<br /><br />2. VALUE AN INNOVATIVE MINDSET:  When you encourage a pioneering approach within your team, you gain value beyond expectation.  Teams that are a composite of experts with diverse experience and perspectives have the innate capability to feed off of each others' innovative ideas and naturally refine and improve concepts into amazing solutions.  When a team member's ideas are valued, the willingness to believe in that team naturally rises accordingly.<br /><br />3. PROVIDE MEANINGFUL WORK:   Isolated team members have a need to experience work that challenges them and brings meaning to the tasks they are working on independently of outside influence.  When each contributing member of the team is engaged in work that motivates  and interests them, they perform better, have a clearer picture of the benefits and invest themselves more completely in that work.  It's win-win.<br /><br />4. OFFER VARIETY:   It's just boring to work on the same thing or with the same person, day in and day out.  It can be excruciating when you're working in an isolated environment. That's why making sure your team members have diverse partnerships, changing assignments and varying schedules is a solid way to keep your virtual team interested in their work and excited about upcoming possibilities.<br /><br />5. ALLOW INDEPENDENCE:  Every member of the team needs to know that their ideas and opinions will be respected.  When you allow individuals to be accountable for coming up with new concepts and innovative solutions that will benefit the team and the company, you're basically giving them a sense of control.  As an invested decision-maker, each team member is more likely to feel like a valued contributor who is accountable to the team and to the company.<br /><br />6. CREATE FOCUS AND ALIGNED VISION:  It's essential that all team members are committed to the same goals and vision - and that they have complimentary methods of achieving them.  Often virtual team members have their own distinctive goals and aren't plugged in to the values and needs of the organization building the team.  Since this can bring differing agendas into the mix, it's imperative that the goals and vision of the work - including the end result - are clearly stated from the outset and that the team is aligned to them.<br /><br />7. BE TRUSTWORTHY:  If you want to gain the trust of your virtual team, earn it.  These team members are likely SMEs with exceptional levels of creativity, innovation and knowledge.  Being able to trust that they are working in an environment where a strong work ethic is expected of all team members (including leaders) is imperative.  When a participative mindset trickles down from the top and all ideas are respected and valued, trust soars and productivity increases dramatically.<br /><br />The bottom line is that when you build a virtual team, you need to be sure that each member will be able to see the value placed on them, the value of each other member, and the value of the team as a whole.<br /><br />A virtual team is more than the sum of its members - it's a culture with a life of its own. When a company and its leaders view their virtual teams in this manner, it reinforces to each member the value being placed on them, and raises their accountability, productivity and satisfaction levels immeasurably.  With this approach to virtual team-building, the sky's the limit.

One way that I've found to do this in a business setting is with custom business cards. Custom business cards can range from the subtle to the exotic and everything in between. Here are just a few ways that you can make a striking impression with your very own custom business cards: <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jYXJkc21hZGVlYXN5LmNvbS8_" target="_blank">full range of business cards</a>,<br /><br />o    Shapes - any shape you can imagine is possible. Do you own a pizzeria? Consider pizza shaped business cards. You have a pet-based business? Make your business cards in the shape of dogs and cats. Keep in mind that custom shapes are often costly, but the impression can be well worth the expense.<br /><br />o    Sizes - custom business cards can be made to be any size. 2 x 3 is the standard business card size, but experiment with 3 x 3 or 2 x 2. Anything to set your card apart from the competition. Changing the size of your cards can be an inexpensive way to set your card apart.<br /><br />o    Colors - do not underestimate the power of full color custom business cards. While black print on a white card is standard, think about adding at least a color logo or even a full color picture in the background. The more color, the more expensive, so pick a format that suits your needs.<br /><br />o    Texture - custom business cards can be made of anything from metal to rice paper to plastic. Using a unique texture is a subtle way of setting your business card apart. An inexpensive way to add texture to your cards is to use different types of card stock. But if you need to make a dramatic impression, the expensive metal cards are sure to stand out.<br /><br />o    Opacity - one of the more stunning effects I've seen lately with custom business cards is the new see-through card. These cards are made of plastic ranging from the thickness of a credit card to thinner than paper. They come in varying degrees of opacity. Some of these cards are as clear as glass, making the logo and information on the card appear is if it is standing in midair. Other cards just look a little bit foggy, but are still see-through. While somewhat expensive, this can be a great way to stand out from the crowd.
