<br /><br />Then one day
<br /><br />things went terribly wrong.
<br /><br />The next few weeks
<br /><br />were like a very sad
<br /><br />song.
<br /><br />He made her jealous
<br /><br />on purpose he tried.
<br /><br />When the girl asked, &quot;Do you love her?&quot;
<br /><br />on purpose he lied.
<br /><br />He played with jealousy
<br /><br />like it was a game.
<br /><br />Little did he know
<br /><br />Things would never be the same.
<br /><br />His plan was working
<br /><br />but he had no clue.
<br /><br />How wrong things would go,
<br /><br />the damage he would do.
<br /><br />One night she broke down,
<br /><br />feeling very
<br /><br />alone.
<br /><br />Just her and the blade,
<br /><br />no one else home.
<br /><br />She dialed his number,
<br /><br />he answered, &quot;Hello&quot;
<br /><br />She told him she loved him
<br /><br />and hung up the phone.
<br /><br />He raced to her
<br /><br />house
<br /><br />just a minute too late.
<br /><br />Found her lying in blood
<br /><br />her heart
<br /><br />had no rate.
<br /><br />Beside her was a note,
<br /><br />in it her confession.
<br /><br />Her love for this boy,
<br /><br />her only obsession.
<br /><br />As he read the note,
<br /><br />he knelt down and cried.
<br /><br />Grabbed her knife,
<br /><br />that night they both died.
<br /><br />She was found in his arms,
<br /><br />both of them dead.
<br /><br />Under her
<br /><br />note
<br /><br />his handwriting said:
<br /><br />&quot;I loved her
<br /><br />so, she never knew.
<br /><br />All this time
<br /><br />She loved me
<br /><br />too.&quot;

<br /><br />love of

<br />(oh yeah..you're not &quot;popular&quot; if you've slept with more than 5 guys..you're a HOE)
<br /><br />?&quot;Hey, are you busy?&quot; or &quot;Are you doing something?&quot; ~ two phrases guys open with to stop from stammering on the phone.
<br /><br />?Guys may be flirting around all day but before they go to sleep, they always think about the girl they truly care about.
<br /><br />?Before they call, guys try to plan out a little about what they're gonna say so there aren't awkward pauses, but once he's on the phone he forgets it all and makes it up as he goes.
<br /><br />?Guys go crazy over a girl's smile.
<br /><br />?Guys will do anything just to get you to notice him.
<br /><br />?Guys hate it when you talk about your ex-boyfriend or ex love-interest. Unless they're goin for the let-her-complain-to-you-and-then-have-her-realize-- - - how-wonderful-and-nice-you-are
<br />method.
<br /><br />?A guy who likes you wants to be the only guy you talk to.
<br /><br />?Boyfriends need to be reassured often that they're still loved.
<br /><br />?Don't talk about your guy friends to your boyfriend.
<br /><br />?Guys get jealous easily.
<br /><br />?Guys are more emotional than they'd like people to think.
<br /><br />?Giving a guy a hanging message like &quot;You know what?!..uh...nevermind..&quot; would make him jump to a conclusion that is far from what you are thinking. And he'll assume he did something wrong and he'll obsess about it trying to figure it out.
<br /><br />?Guys are good flatterers when courting but they usually stammer when they talk to a girl they really like.
<br /><br />?Guys hate asking parents for money to buy girls presents. So they come up with ideas like saving their lunch money for a week. But it never works because guys are always hungry so they end up asking the parents for money anyway.
<br /><br />?Girls are guys' weaknesses.
<br /><br />?Guys are very open about themselves.
<br /><br />?It's good to test a guy first before you trust him. But don't let him wait too long.
<br /><br />?Your best friend, whom your boyfriend seeks help from about his problems with you may end up being admired by your boyfriend.
<br /><br />?If a guy tells you about his problems, he just needs someone to listen to him. You don't need to give advice.
<br /><br />?A usual act that proves that the guy likes you is when he teases you.
<br /><br />?Guys love you more than you love them if they are serious in your relationships.
<br /><br />?Guys will brag about anything.
<br /><br />?Guys use words like hot or cute to describe girls. We rarely use beautiful. If a guy uses that, he likes you a whole hell of a lot.
<br /><br />?Guys think WAY too much. One small thing a girl does, even if she doesn't notice it can make the guy think about it for hours, trying to figure out what it meant.
<br /><br />?Guys seek for advice from girls not other guys. Because most guys think alike, so if one guy's confused, then we're all confused.
<br /><br />?Any guy could write out a rulebook or advice book for flirting, but no guy can write out a book about relationships.
<br /><br />?Try to be as straightforward as possible.
<br /><br />?A guy has to experience rejection, because if he's too-good-never-been-bustednever been in love and hurt, he won't be mature and grown up.
<br /><br />?If the guy does something stupid in front of the girl, he will think about it for the next couple days or until the next time he spends time with the girl.
<br /><br />?Guys learn from experience not from the romance books that girls read and take as their basis of experience.
<br /><br />?Guys worry about the thin line between being compassionate and being whipped.
<br /><br />?If a guy looks unusually calm and laid back, he's probably faking it and is spazzing inside.
<br /><br />?When a guy says he is going crazy about the girl, he really is. Guys rarely say that.
<br /><br />?When a guy asks you to leave him alone, he's just actually saying, &quot;Please come and listen to me.&quot;
<br /><br />?Guys don't really have final decisions.
<br /><br />?If a guy starts to talk seriously, listen to him. It doesn't happen that often, so when it does, you know something's up.
<br /><br />?If your best guy friend seems to avoid you or is never around when you're with your boyfriend, he's probably jealous and likes you.
<br /><br />?When a guy looks at you for longer than a second, he's definitely thinking something.
<br /><br />?Guys like femininity not feebleness.
<br /><br />?Guys don't like girls who punch harder than they do.
<br /><br />?A guy has more problems than you can see with your naked eyes.
<br /><br />?Don't be a snob. Guys can be intimidated and give up easily.
<br /><br />?Everything in moderation. Put on makeup, wear perfume. Just not too much.
<br /><br />?Guys talk about girls more than girls talk about guys.
<br /><br />?Guys hate rejection, but they hate being led on even more.
<br /><br />?Guys really think that girls are strange and have unpredictable decisions and are MAD confusing but somehow are drawn even more to them.
<br /><br />?No guy can handle all his problems on his own. He's just too stubborn to admit it.
<br /><br />?Not all guys are assholes. Just because ONE is a jackass doesnt mean he represents ALL of us.
<br /><br />?We don't like girls who are too skinny.
<br /><br />?Always make sure you know what kind of stuff your getting into before making out with a guy ...like wheather it's a one time deal or not ....
<br /><br />?Believe it or not shy guys are the most easiest to talk to..it may not seem right but trust me they will start opening up like books after you just ask them questions about their lives and unoticable tell them about yours...
<br /><br />?Even if they refuse it all guys are ticklish on the ribs..
<br /><br />?Guys love neck rubs and if he lets you keep doing it ..it means that he really likes you or his neck really hurts...
<br /><br />?Guys will test the waters to see how far they can get with you. Even if he doesn't intend to it will happen. Know how far it is you want to let him go and he will respect that...after you let him know a couple times.
<br /><br />?When a guy sacrifices his sleep and health just to be with you, he really likes you and wants to be with you as much as possible.
<br /><br />?Girls if u don't repost this within 1 hr then you will lose the guy of your life
<br /><br />?Guys if you don't repost this in one hr then you will lose the girl of your life.

<br />As my Dad lies himself on the ground
<br /><br />I squirm; as Daddy friend pulls me up
<br />And places me ontop of Daddy; thrusts within
<br />I cry; i bite; i scratch; i slap; i fail
<br />&quot;O Daddy please you win you win!&quot;
<br /><br />I can feel my skin rip; my virginity breaking free
<br />I can feel the blood seep down my leg
<br />&quot;Daddy your hurting me please&quot;
<br />I plead to him and his friend; not even a beg
<br /><br />Daddys laughing; why does he laugh?
<br />His friend shoves himself in my mouth and moans
<br />Tieing my hands together; moving in and out
<br />&quot;Ride me Jessy&quot; He laughs and groans
<br /><br />They smile at one another; laugh to
<br />They roll me over and spread me wide well
<br />My daddy sits on my face; himself in again
<br />While his friend talks and pushes himself inside
<br /><br />I can hardly breathe; i gag for air
<br />I cough and splutter; cry and weep
<br />I beg and plead; but its no use
<br />Theyve already made me hurt and bleed
<br /><br />I stare into his eyes; that look upon me
<br />This is not my Dad; where is he?
<br />If he was still here; would he care
<br />Would he actually even; see?
<br /><br />Finally they get of and lie me on the sofa
<br />My cheeks blouchy from tears and pain
<br />They play with them selfs; all over me
<br />Rub it in; making me feel the shame
<br /><br />&quot;Why Daddy? Please tell me why?&quot;
<br />Dad looks at his friend; and waves him away
<br />&quot;Jessy i love you&quot; he smiles and kisses my cheek
<br />&quot;Is that all you have in your heart to say?&quot;
<br /><br />He puts my nightie on me
<br />he walks me to my bedroom door
<br />Ever since that night; His friend
<br />And himself every Friday come back for more
<br /><br />&quot;Night sweet Girl; You are my life&quot;
<br />Closing the door, tears still down my face
<br />Still the smell of him and his friend
<br />Fade into me like disgrace
<br /><br />I watch the Moon go down; the sun come up
<br />&quot;Jessy its school&quot; Knocking at my door
<br />I cant help but cry; weep in pain
<br />Because im so scared he wanted more
<br /><br />But one night daddy took it too far
<br />Daddy and his friend came back for one last shot
<br />They were worried they would get caught
<br />So he and his friend took me to a cemetary lot
<br /><br />I was blindfolded and my hands were tied back
<br />&quot;Daddy please!! Not tonight!&quot;
<br />Daddy and his friend both had their last fun
<br />After that i tried to put up a fight
<br /><br />I begged daddy &quot;Please no more!&quot;
<br />All he could say &quot;Shut up, you stupid Bitch!&quot;
<br />Daddy unblindfolded me at last
<br />He said I love you so much
<br /><br />He went back into the car and pulled out a bat
<br />&quot;Daddy I swear I wont say a thing!!!!&quot;
<br />I was dead
<br />After only one swing..........................
<br /><br />**... Please if you care for all the children and women (and men) who have been raped
<br />repost this bulletin with the Headline &quot;daddy please no&quot;
<br /><br />i dont know how anyone could do that to someone especially a child
