Since it does not tend to tangle or shed, all that I need to do is wash it every few days and put it up at night to protect it.  I can heat style it however I want and even use hair coloring if I want to change things up a bit.  I highly recommend the Parisian Glam Saga Remy weave to anyone that is looking for a great body weave.<br /><br />Have you ever wondered why it is not easy to simply pick out all of the people that you see who are wearing the same Saga Remy weave texture?  It is even difficult to find two people that look like they are wearing identical weaves when you are at a beauty supply convention full of people wearing weaves.  Considering that there are only six Saga Remy weave textures available, many of the weaves have to be identical when they are purchased.  The trick that all of those people use to discreetly wear identical weave textures is to personalize the one that they are wearing.  Here are some tips that you can use to personalize your Saga Remy weave so that you never experience that awkward moment of running into someone that is obviously wearing the same weave as you.<br /><br />One way that you can personalize your Saga Remy weave is to have your hair stylist trim it into a unique looking style that is very flattering to your facial shape and features.   This could be something as simple as cutting it to make bangs.  The bangs can vary from just cutting the weave hairs straight across the forehead to making thin wispy tendrils in different lengths to gently frame your face.  You can also have your hair stylist layer your entire Saga Remy weave to give it a totally different appearance with or without bangs.  Since every hair stylist has their own individual style it is not likely that there would be two people with identical weaves cut in exactly the same manner in the same vicinity.<br /><br />Another way that you can personalize your Saga Remy weave is to alter the color.  Since all of these weaves are made of human hair they easily accept hair coloring.  You can have your hair stylist dye your Saga Remy to make it a different shade than any of the ones that can be purchased.  In addition, you can just have your hair stylist add high lighting or streaks of a different color in order to make your weave more personal and unique looking.<br /><br />If you do not want to cut or color your Saga Remy weave, you can still give it a more personal look by adding accessories such as decorative clips that hold sections of it in a different manner than it naturally lays, such as pulling the sides together at the back of the head into a small pony tail while leaving the rest of the hair free flowing.<br /><br />You can personalize your Saga Remy weave a little with accessories or have it cut and colored in the same hair salon appointment.  It really depends on what feels right to you and what makes you look your best.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Ffeed.informer.com%2Fforums%2Fprofile.php%3Fid%3D69912"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://feed.informer.com/forums/profile.php?id=69912</a>

It seemed like I would barely get a week of wear out of them before they started looking bad and I would need to have them taken out and replaced.  I do not have any of these problems with the beautifully wavy Parisian Glam Saga Remy weaves when I wear them because the hair strands are very healthy, strong, and durable when the weaves are made.

This is something that I realized the hard way by wearing inferior weaves that became horribly tangled after less than a week of wear because the cuticles were damaged, unaligned or stripped off.<br /><br />When I had my first French Allure Saga Remy weave uninstalled, I was surprised that my hair stylist asked what I wanted to do with it.  I had always had to throw away the other brands of weaves when I got them uninstalled because the hair was looking shabby and unattractive.  My hair stylist said that my French Allure Saga Remy weave was still in great condition and she recommended that I clean it and reuse it at a later date in order to save myself the cost of buying a new one.<br /><br />If you love a full head of long hair with lots of curls everywhere, you should try the Natural French Saga Remy weave by Milky Way.  I think that it is a great weave and I doubt that I will ever switch to wearing any other curly weave.  It does not shed or tangle like some of the similar looking weaves that are made by other companies.  In addition, I can wear this hair for a long time without needing to replace it because it is so healthy and strong.<br /><br />The Natural French Saga Remy weave is a full mane of curly hair that some people might find to be a little much, but it is easily calmed down with a little styling mousse and edge-tamer gel on a tooth brush.  I did this the first time that I wore a Natural French Saga Remy weave because I was not used to having quite that much fluffy hair everywhere.  However, once I got used to the look and feel of all of those gorgeous curls, I just wear it as it is and it totally rocks.<br /><br />My natural hair is full of loose curls and it was very easy for me to blend my Natural French Saga Remy weave so that it was nearly impossible to tell it from the bangs and edges of my natural hair that I left out when I had my weave installed.  Even if your natural hair is not full loose curls like mine, you can still easily wear a Natural French Saga Remy weave.  My sisterâ€™s natural hair is rather straight and when she wears a Natural French Saga Remy weave, she simply braids her exposed natural hair to help with the blending and it works perfectly.<br /><br />Of course, just like with any type of hair, there were days when I wanted a sleeker looking head of hair, so I would just get out my flat iron and straighten out the curls of my Natural French Saga Remy weave.  I never had to worry about how I was going to get all of the beautiful curls back in my Natural French Saga Remy weave because I knew that washing and drying it would bring it back to the way it looked before I straightened it.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.oneview.com%2Fuser%2Fmelindadalto821"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.oneview.com/user/melindadalto821</a>

I read that the individual human hairs are hand picked to be sure that they meet all of the strict requirements to make these weaves.  Each strand of human hair has to be very healthy, youthful and strong.

Every one of the six different textures of Saga Remy weaves is made from the finest strands of virgin remy human hair and my Parisian Glam weave is no exception.  I know that I can get weeks of wear out of each Parisian Glam Saga Remy weave that I buy.  In fact, as long as I take great care of it while I have it sewn in, my hair stylist can usually carefully remove it and I can store it to have her reuse it again one or two more times.  I think that paying more for a Parisian Glam Saga Remy weave that is going to last much longer is actually a much better deal because I can keep the same weave week after week and do not need to make extra trips to the hair salon like I did with the cheaper weaves.<br /><br />Aside from the quality of my Parisian Glam Saga Remy weaves, I love how comfortable and natural the hair feels and moves while I am wearing it.  It has a lot of sheen to give it that healthy look that everyone wants their hair to have.  My Parisian Glam Saga Remy weave is very easy to maintain.  Since it does not tend to tangle or shed, all that I need to do is wash it every few days and put it up at night to protect it.  I can heat style it however I want and even use hair coloring if I want to change things up a bit.  I highly recommend the Parisian Glam Saga Remy weave to anyone that is looking for a great body weave.<br /><br />Have you ever wondered why it is not easy to simply pick out all of the people that you see who are wearing the same Saga Remy weave texture?  It is even difficult to find two people that look like they are wearing identical weaves when you are at a beauty supply convention full of people wearing weaves.  Considering that there are only six Saga Remy weave textures available, many of the weaves have to be identical when they are purchased.  The trick that all of those people use to discreetly wear identical weave textures is to personalize the one that they are wearing.  Here are some tips that you can use to personalize your Saga Remy weave so that you never experience that awkward moment of running into someone that is obviously wearing the same weave as you.<br /><br />One way that you can personalize your Saga Remy weave is to have your hair stylist trim it into a unique looking style that is very flattering to your facial shape and features.

It is even difficult to find two people that look like they are wearing identical weaves when you are at a beauty supply convention full of people wearing weaves.

The trick that all of those people use to discreetly wear identical weave textures is to personalize the one that they are wearing.  Here are some tips that you can use to personalize your Saga Remy weave so that you never experience that awkward moment of running into someone that is obviously wearing the same weave as you.<br /><br />One way that you can personalize your Saga Remy weave is to have your hair stylist trim it into a unique looking style that is very flattering to your facial shape and features.   This could be something as simple as cutting it to make bangs.  The bangs can vary from just cutting the weave hairs straight across the forehead to making thin wispy tendrils in different lengths to gently frame your face.  You can also have your hair stylist layer your entire Saga Remy weave to give it a totally different appearance with or without bangs.  Since every hair stylist has their own individual style it is not likely that there would be two people with identical weaves cut in exactly the same manner in the same vicinity.<br /><br />Another way that you can personalize your Saga Remy weave is to alter the color.  Since all of these weaves are made of human hair they easily accept hair coloring.  You can have your hair stylist dye your Saga Remy to make it a different shade than any of the ones that can be purchased.  In addition, you can just have your hair stylist add high lighting or streaks of a different color in order to make your weave more personal and unique looking.<br /><br />If you do not want to cut or color your Saga Remy weave, you can still give it a more personal look by adding accessories such as decorative clips that hold sections of it in a different manner than it naturally lays, such as pulling the sides together at the back of the head into a small pony tail while leaving the rest of the hair free flowing.<br /><br />You can personalize your Saga Remy weave a little with accessories or have it cut and colored in the same hair salon appointment.  It really depends on what feels right to you and what makes you look your best.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fmubi.com%2Fusers%2F2070282"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://mubi.com/users/2070282</a>
