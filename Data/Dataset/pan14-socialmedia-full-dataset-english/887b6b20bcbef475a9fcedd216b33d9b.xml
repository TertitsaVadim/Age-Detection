<br /><br />Antoni Gaudi was Spanish Catalan Architect who belonged to the Modernist style movement and was famous for his unique and highly individualistic designs. His works has a huge contribution in Spanish culture, one of the historical men the Spanish history.
<br /><br />Gaudí was a devout Catholic, to the point that in his later years, he abandoned secular work and devoted his life to Catholicism and his Sagrada Família. He designed it to have 18 towers, 12 for the 12 apostles, 4 for the 4 evangelists, one for Mary and one for Jesus.
<br /><br />Gaudí's first works were designed in the style of gothic architecture and traditional Catalan architectural modes, but he soon developed his own distinct sculptural style. French architect Eugene Viollet-le-Duc, who promoted an evolved form of gothic architecture, proved a major influence on Gaudí. But the student surpassed the master architect and contrived highly original designs – irregular and fantastically intricate. Some of his greatest works, most notably La Sagrada Família, have an almost hallucinatory power.
<br /><br />Even it is unfinished, the Sagrada Familia is one of the landmarks of the country and the tourist spot that every tourist who visit Barcelona  can’t afford to miss the work of the famous Architect. The project of Sagrada Familia is scheduled to be completed in 2026. 
<br /><br />The contribution of Gaudi in architectural designs are gain huge amount to the heart of every Spanish people. Most of the architectural designs of the city buildings are inspired in the works of Gaudi,  Educational structures, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5oY2Nob3RlbHMuZXM_" target="_blank">Hotel Playa Barcelona</a>  and other architectural works.

<br />People who don’t have all the time in the world to plan thoroughly their next ventured trip usually resort to travel site resources, but the question is “can trust this sites”? There is no best answer of this old question; others are accurate and reliable but the others can be a plain fraud and only aim to deceive you by naming all kinds of details in the location you want to visit. It is important to be careful 
<br /><br />Most travel sites can give you best prices for various destinations, provide you valuable suggestion on where to go and teach you the ideal place to shop, lead you to terrific hotels such as <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uaWNldG9ib29rLmNvbS8_" target="_blank">Hoteles en Bilbao</a> </strong> or any tourist services, and most of all guides you to where you can devour  the best food stuff that will surely satisfy you. Anyhow you can take advantage of these free travel guides. Be careful to those who have “business means business” mentality. Most of this is just exaggerating on their commercial purpose; that’s why we should be careful. 
<br /><br />Just be flexible in any ways. If you are smart traveler, be vigilant in the things around you. Be more curious in examining the site you want to inquire and check it reputation in the online community. I have personally known sites of <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uaWNldG9ib29rLmNvbS8_" target="_blank">Reservas Hoteles</a> </strong>, good reputations and has a great experience in travel services, specially in accommodation services. Flexibility and be smart is a tools to have good travel and time. Also, don’t be so mechanical in travel plan, it is not necessary to have plan in any details, make also a room for any chances and ordinary opportunities. Go with flow and you can realize what the meaning of true adventure is.
