Laser cutting machinery is used to cut piping and structural components as nicely as flat sheet materials.<br /><br />The machinery employs one of three types of lasers:<br /><br />C02 Laser<br /><br />This type is suited for engraving, dull and cutting of components (metal becoming the most widespread).<br /><br />The Nd Laser (Neodymium) and the Nd-YAG Laser (Neodymium Yttrium Aluminium Garnet)<br /><br />The style of these two lasers is in fact identical but the application procedure is distinct.
