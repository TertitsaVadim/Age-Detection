On that wider expanse like lash marks lie pristine white sandy beaches, embellished by lush green palm trees and illuminated by all year sunshine. Maldives comes to mind as images of sunny side of life. No wonder Maldives is a prime tourism destination for global clientele.
<br />Maldives tourism thrives on the exotic beach resorts, virgin and inhabited islands, opportunities for diving and water sports and hospitable people all aligned and sharpened with a single aim of customer satisfaction.
<br /><br />The Maldives is an island country situated in Indian Ocean to the south west of India. It is an archipelago of one thousand one hundred and ninety two islands grouped into twenty six coral atolls. Out of these islands of Maldives only two hundred are inhabited and some eighty plus is used for developing resorts. Rests are uninhabited. The islands - both inhabited and uninhabited are put to good use by <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5tYWxkaXZlc3RvdXJpc20ub3JnLmluL21hbGRpdmVzLXRvdXItb3BlcmF0b3JzLmh0bWw_" target="_blank">Maldives tour operators</a></strong>.
<br /><br />Excursions to inhabited islands are by far the best way to experience the life of an ordinary Maldivian. Some of the islands air a modern look with brightly painted house walls and harbor areas. At the same time there are also tranquil fishing villages with lots of tree shade, swings and traditional wooden holhuashi. In holhuashis, islanders relax after a day’s work exchanging news, telling stories, playing cards and listening to local radio.
<br /><br />Fishing is the part of mainstream life of Maldivians. Their pleasures and dejections are intertwined with the catch they have got. In Maldives you can get a chance to partake in the small happiness of Maldivians connected with fishing. You can go for a night reef fishing trip. Most of the resorts offer this. The boat leaves before sunset to find a good spot near a reef. The boat crew will tutor on how to use the lines, hooks and sinkers. Grey heads testify that one hour is enough to catch plenty. Then it is the turn to visit deserted islands to eat and celebrate. Virgin island is not difficult to find with only few hundred utilized out of more than thousand islands. While the fish gets prepared you can gradually experience and explore the untouched island. You can feel the softness of sand which is untouched by human foot for a long time. You can internalize the undisturbed sounds made by nature. You are alone under the radiance of stars without a single light on the ground. You will feel like floating among the stars. A day time trip to uninhabited island is also an unique experience. You are among the raw unspoilt vegetation surrounded by blinding beaches. Sun beam reflecting from waters makes for an eerie ambience. It is hard to imagine that you are the only person in this charming world.
<br /><br />Scuba diving is a favorite activity of tourists to Maldives. Maldives holds one of the richest diving coral reef areas. The warm seas of Maldives have high visibility throughout the year. One can see fishes passing fifty meters away. Add to that is the marvelous formation of three thousand coral reefs and free flowing tides of monsoon.
