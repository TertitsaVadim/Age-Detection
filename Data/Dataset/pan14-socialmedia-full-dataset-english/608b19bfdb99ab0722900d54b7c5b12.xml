<br /><br />A pulse oximeter is a kind of medical equipment that indirectly measures the oxygen saturation in a person's blood and changes in blood volume in the skin, producing a photoplethysmograph. Hey Tour guides! Keep Away from <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jcmVkaXQtY2hlbWljYWwuY29tL2lub3JnYW5pYy1jb21wb3VuZC9zb2RpdW0tc3VsZmF0ZS5odG1s" target="_blank">sodium sulfate manufacturer</a> ! Applied in the hospital or nursery house, it is often attached to a medical monitor so that the staff can see the patient's oxygenation at all times. 10 Reasons for You to Pick <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jcmVkaXQtY2hlbWljYWwuY29tL2lub3JnYW5pYy1jb21wb3VuZC9jYXVzdGljLXNvZGEtcHJpbGxzLmh0bWw_" target="_blank">caustic soda suppliers</a> Most monitors also display the heart rate. You May Slight These When Preserve <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5oZWFsdGhxdWVzdGlvbnM0dS5jb20v" target="_blank">health questions</a> Before it was invented, doctors measured oxygen saturation directly through a blood sample. Now, portable, battery-operated pulse oximeters are common home medical equipment that is also available for home blood-oxygen monitoring.
<br /><br />It is a kind of very useful and durable medical equipment. If you are a big fan of jogging or daily exercises, you might need one to monitor your oxygen saturation to achieve a better effect from the exercise. But how to use a portable pulse oximter? Here are some guidences about it.
<br /><br />Portable pulse oximeter is a device that clips onto your finger and reads your heart rate as well as the percent of oxygen in your blood. Because pulse oximetry so often occurs on the finger, these devices are also commonly called a finger oximeter. I am not going to talk about why and how this works and all the other scientific stuff. I am going to tell you the easiest and most practical things.
<br /><br />First, keep in mind that a pulse oximeter reading in the high 90s is considered normal, which means anywhere from 96% SpO2 through 99% SpO2. A reading of 90-95, as for 95% SpO2 or less could indicate hypoxia and should be investigated. A reading of lower than 90 indicates significant hypoxia, it means you should stop exercise immediately and ask for medical help.
<br /><br />Second, the pulse oximeter must be clipped, like a clothespin. This means your finger, toe, earlobe or across the bridge of your nose (for exercise, I think clip on the finger is enough).
<br /><br />Notice the scenarios that will result in the pulse oximeter providing either an inaccurate reading or no reading at all. Some common scenarios that result in an erroneous reading during exercises include:
<br /><br />Nail polish, if the pulse oximeter is clipped on a finger. 
<br /><br />Excessive movement by the person who wear the oximeter. 
<br /><br />Other possibilities caused by medical reasons include:&lt;/DIV&gt;
<br /><br />Hypothermia or a cold injury to the extremities 
<br />Anemia (not enough iron in the blood) 
<br />Carbon monoxide poisoning 
<br />Certain types of seizures 
<br /><br />Having a heart rate monitor on hand can be convenient and beneficial when exercising. You want to be sure that when you work out, you're keeping a healthy heart rate, which help you learn how to burn fat safely and quickly, and now that you know how to read a pulse oximeter, you can check to make sure that you and your family have normal heart and pulse rates while exercising or when at rest.
