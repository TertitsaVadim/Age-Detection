<br />It is said,’’ passion can never
<br />purchase what true love
<br />desires….
<br />True intimacy, self- giving and
<br />commitment.’’
<br />I’m SO in love and desire nothing
<br />more than to be your one and
<br />only.
<br />We have decided to follow our
<br />hearts to a higher level
<br />Of commitment, giving in to our
<br />true feelings.
<br />Knowing there’s no going back…..
<br />For our love is like a wild fire
<br />Burning through acres of lush
<br />forest.
<br />Are you prepared to fuel these
<br />flames even more?
<br />For as it grows it becomes
<br />harder and harder to contain
<br />From the watchful eyes of the
<br />outside world.
<br />We are playing in a very
<br />dangerous territory now.
<br />The walls surrounding my heart
<br />are falling down each day we
<br />spend together,
<br />Each conversation we have, each
<br />kiss we share, and every time we
<br />make love.
<br />But realise by taking this step
<br />closer and allowing our hearts the
<br />Commitment it so desires we are
<br />stepping into a fiery unknown
<br />Where we are both completely
<br />vulnerable to one another.
<br />Just thinking about it makes my
<br />blood race impulsively,
<br />Through my veins, causing a
<br />flushed trembling within.
<br />I want to be with you in every way
<br />we possible can
<br />MIND, BODY, HEART AND SOUL.
<br />Together we will just have to find
<br />a way to manage
<br />The explosive love we silently and
<br />secretly share.
<br />Because regardless, when a day
<br />goes by that I can’t
<br />Meet you in person, we are
<br />together in memories.
<br />When I cannot see you, my heart
<br />still feels you
<br />Near…. Longing for your warm
<br />embrace.
<br />Before we met life was viewed in
<br />black and white
<br />Now that we are together vivid
<br />colours surround our universe
<br />I never knew love like this existed
<br />other than in fairytales
<br />Now that I’ve tasted the sweet
<br />divine fruit of love
<br />How can I ever be expected to go
<br />back?
<br />To the bittersweet life of the
<br />past?
<br />No one can understand this
<br />forbidden love we share
<br />And so we are forced into
<br />confinement.
<br />But I’d rather be covertly
<br />sneaking around with you by my
<br />side, Than left to face the cold
<br />dark world alone.
<br />One problem….these feelings are
<br />reaching a maximum boiling point
<br />And we can never seem to leave
<br />well enough alone.
<br />We continue to push things
<br />further,
<br />Bringing us one step closer to
<br />ultimate exposure…
<br />Leaving all to see that you and I
<br />are one.
<br />Would they accept us if they
<br />knew that you were my dream
<br />lover and I your fantasy girl for
<br />so long Before we ever gave into
<br />these all-consuming feelings?
<br />We can’t help that life led us to
<br />each other in the way it did….
<br />Our souls could not resist for
<br />they searched for so long.
<br />This type of love comes but less
<br />than once in a life time,
<br />So how can we deny ourselves
<br />this chance for infinite
<br />fulfilment?
<br />All chips are on the table Baby,
<br />What’s meant to happen will….
<br />occur, all we can do is enjoy the
<br />ride together.
<br />Destination unknown, a secret
<br />rendezvous,
<br />Where the sparks of our love
<br />continue to blaze out of
<br />control….
<br />And our souls are at last reunited.
<br />I will always love you...
<br />Para siempre tu Ángel

<br />As I walked home one freezing
<br />day, I stumbled on a wallet
<br />someone had lost in the street. I
<br />picked it up and looked inside to
<br />find some identification so
<br />I could call the owner. But the
<br />wallet contained only three
<br />dollars and a
<br />crumpled letter that looked as if
<br />it had been in there for years.
<br />The envelope was worn and the
<br />only thing that was legible on it
<br />was the
<br />retu
<br />rn address. I started to open the
<br />letter, hoping to find some clue.
<br />Then
<br />I saw the dateline--1924. The
<br />letter had been written almost
<br />sixty years ago.
<br />It was written in a beautiful
<br />feminine handwriting on powder
<br />blue
<br />stationery with a little flower in
<br />the left-hand corner. It was a
<br />&quot;Dear John&quot;
<br />letter that told the recipient,
<br />whose name appeared to be
<br />Michael, that the
<br />writer could not see him any
<br />more because her mother
<br />forbade it. Even so, she
<br />wrote that she would always love
<br />him.
<br />It was signed, Hannah.
<br />It was a beautiful letter, but
<br />there was no way except for the
<br />name
<br />Michael, that the owner could be
<br />identified. Maybe if I called
<br />information,the operator could
<br />find a phone listing for the
<br />address on the envelope.
<br />&quot;Operator,&quot; I began, &quot;this is an
<br />unusual request. I'm trying to find
<br />the owner of a wallet that I found.
<br />Is there anyway you can tell me if
<br />there is a phone number for an
<br />address that was on an envelope
<br />in the wallet?&quot;
<br />She suggested I speak with her
<br />supervisor, who hesitated for a
<br />moment then said, &quot;Well, there is
<br />a phone listing at that address,
<br />but I can't give you the number.&quot;
<br />She said, as a courtesy, she
<br />would call that number, explain
<br />my story and would ask them if
<br />they wanted her to connect me. I
<br />waited a few minutes and then
<br />she was back on the line. &quot;I have a
<br />party who will speak with you.&quot;
<br />I asked the woman on the other
<br />end of the line if she knew anyone
<br />by the
<br />name of Hannah. She gasped, &quot;Oh!
<br />We bought this house from a
<br />family who had a daughter named
<br />Hannah. But that was 30 years
<br />ago!&quot;
<br />&quot;Would you know where that
<br />family could be located now?&quot; I
<br />asked.
<br />&quot;I remember that Hannah had to
<br />place her mother in a nursing
<br />home some
<br />years ago,&quot; the woman said.
<br />&quot;Maybe if you got in touch with
<br />them they might be able to track
<br />down the daughter.&quot;
<br />She gave me the name of the
<br />nursing home and I called the
<br />number. They told me the old lady
<br />had passed away some years ago
<br />but they did have a phone
<br />number for where they thought
<br />the daughter might be living.
<br />I thanked them and phoned. The
<br />woman who answered explained
<br />that Hannah herself was now
<br />living in a nursing home.
<br />This whole thing was stupid, I
<br />thought to myself. Why was I
<br />making such a
<br />big deal over finding the owner of
<br />a wallet that had only three
<br />dollars and a letter that was
<br />almost 60 years old?
<br />Nevertheless, I called the nursing
<br />home in which Hannah was
<br />supposed to be living and the man
<br />who answered the phone told me,
<br />&quot;Yes, Hannah is staying with us. &quot;
<br />Even though it was already 10
<br />p.m., I asked if I could come by to
<br />see her.
<br />&quot;Well,&quot; he said hesitatingly, &quot;if you
<br />want to take a chance, she might
<br />be in
<br />the day room watching
<br />television.&quot;
<br />I thanked him and drove over to
<br />the nursing home. The night
<br />nurse and a
<br />guard greeted me at the door.
<br />We went up to the third floor of
<br />the large
<br />building. In the day room, the
<br />nurse introduced me to Hannah.
<br />She was a sweet, silver-haired old
<br />timer with a warm smile and a
<br />twinkle in her eye.
<br />I told her about finding the wallet
<br />and showed her the letter. The
<br />secondshe saw the powder blue
<br />envelope with that little flower on
<br />the left, she tooka deep breath
<br />and said, &quot;Young man, this letter
<br />was the last contact I ever
<br />had with Michael.&quot;
<br />She looked away for a moment
<br />deep in thought and then said
<br />Softly, &quot;I loved him very much.
<br />But I was only 16 at the time and
<br />my mother felt I was too young.
<br />Oh, he was so handsome. He
<br />looked like Sean Connery, the
<br />actor.&quot;
<br />&quot;Yes,&quot; she continued. &quot;Michael
<br />Goldstein was a wonderful person.
<br />If youshould find him, tell him I
<br />think of him often. And,&quot; she
<br />hesitated for amoment, almost
<br />biting her lip, &quot;tell him I still love
<br />him. You know,&quot; she said smiling
<br />as tears began to well up in her
<br />eyes, &quot;I never did marry. I guess
<br />no one ever matched up to
<br />Michael...&quot;
<br />I thanked Hannah and said
<br />goodbye. I took the elevator to
<br />the first floor and as I stood by
<br />the door, the guard there asked,
<br />&quot;Was the old lady able to help
<br />you?&quot;
<br />I told him she had given me a lead.
<br />&quot;At least I have a last name. But I
<br />think I'll let it go for a while. I
<br />spent almost the whole day
<br />trying to find the owner of this
<br />wallet.&quot;
<br />I had taken out the wallet, which
<br />was a simple brown leather case
<br />with red lacing on the side. When
<br />the guard saw it, he said, &quot;Hey,
<br />wait a minute! That's Mr.
<br />Goldstein's wallet. I'd know it
<br />anywhere with that bright red
<br />lacing. He's always losing that
<br />wallet. I must have found it in the
<br />halls at least three times.&quot;
<br />&quot;Who's Mr. Goldstein?&quot; I asked as
<br />my hand began to shake.
<br />&quot;He's one of the old timers on the
<br />8th floor. That's Mike Goldstein's
<br />wallet for sure. He must have lost
<br />it on one of his walks.&quot;
<br />I thanked the guard and quickly
<br />ran back to the nurse's office. I
<br />told her what the guard had said.
<br />We went back to the elevator
<br />and got on. I prayed that Mr.
<br />Goldstein would be up.
<br />On the eighth floor, the floor
<br />nurse said, &quot;I think he's still in the
<br />day
<br />room. He likes to read at night.
<br />He's a darling old man.&quot;
<br />We went to the only room that
<br />had any lights on and there was a
<br />man reading a book. The nurse
<br />went over to him and asked if he
<br />had lost his wallet. Mr. Goldstein
<br />looked up with surprise, put his
<br />hand in his back pocket and said,
<br />&quot;Oh, it is missing!&quot;
<br />&quot;This kind gentleman found a
<br />wallet and we wondered if it could
<br />be yours?&quot;
<br />I handed Mr. Goldstein the wallet
<br />and the second he saw it, he
<br />smiled with
<br />relief and said, &quot;Yes, that's it! It
<br />must have dropped out of my
<br />pocket this
<br />afternoon. I want to give you a
<br />reward.&quot;
<br />&quot;No, thank you,&quot; I said. &quot;But I have
<br />to tell you something. I read the
<br />letter in the hope of finding out
<br />who owned the wallet.&quot;
<br />The smile on his face suddenly
<br />disappeared. &quot;You read that
<br />letter?&quot;
<br />&quot;Not only did I read it, I think I
<br />know where Hannah is.&quot;
<br />He suddenly grew pale. &quot;Hannah?
<br />You know where she is? How is
<br />she? Is she still as pretty as she
<br />was? Please, please tell me,&quot; he
<br />begged.
<br />&quot;She's fine...just as pretty as
<br />when you knew her.&quot; I said softly.
<br />The old man smiled with
<br />anticipation and asked, &quot;Could you
<br />tell me where she is? I want to
<br />call her tomorrow.&quot; He grabbed
<br />my hand and said, &quot;You know
<br />something, mister, I was so in
<br />love with that girl that when that
<br />letter came, my life literally
<br />ended. I never married. I guess
<br />I've always loved her. &quot;
<br />&quot;Mr. Goldstein,&quot; I said, &quot;Come with
<br />me.&quot;
<br />We took the elevator down to the
<br />third floor. The hallways were
<br />darkened and only one or two
<br />little night-lights lit our way to the
<br />day room where Hannah was
<br />sitting alone watching the
<br />television. The nurse walked over
<br />to her.
<br />&quot;Hannah,&quot; she said softly, pointing
<br />to Michael, who was waiting with
<br />me in the doorway. &quot;Do you know
<br />this man?&quot;
<br />She adjusted her glasses, looked
<br />for a moment, but didn't say a
<br />word.
<br />Michael said softly, almost in a
<br />whisper, &quot;Hannah, it's Michael. Do
<br />you remember me?&quot;
<br />She gasped, &quot;Michael! I don't
<br />believe it! Michael! It's you! My
<br />Michael!&quot;
<br />He walked slowly towards her and
<br />they embraced. The nurse and I
<br />left with
<br />tears streaming down our faces.
<br />&quot;See,&quot; I said. &quot;See how the Good
<br />Lord works! If it's meant to be, it
<br />will be.&quot;
<br />About three weeks later I got a
<br />call at my office from the
<br />nursing home.
<br />&quot;Can you break away on Sunday
<br />to attend a wedding? Michael and
<br />Hannah are going to tie the knot!&quot;
<br />It was a beautiful wedding with all
<br />the people at the nursing home
<br />dressed up to join in the
<br />celebration. Hannah wore a light
<br />beige dress and looked beautiful.
<br />Michael wore a dark blue suit and
<br />stood tall. They made me their
<br />best man.
<br />The hospital gave them their own
<br />room and if you ever wanted to
<br />see a 76-year-old bride and a 79-
<br />year-old groom acting like two
<br />teenagers, you had
<br />to see this couple.
<br />A perfect ending for a love affair
<br />that had lasted nearly 60 years

<br />A story is told about a solider who
<br />was finally coming home after
<br />having fought in Vietnam. He
<br />called his parents from San
<br />Francisco.&quot;Mum, Dad, I'm coming
<br />home, but I have a favour to ask.
<br />I have a friend I'd like to bring
<br />home with me.&quot;&quot;Sure,&quot; they
<br />replied, &quot;we'd love to meet
<br />him.&quot;&quot;There's something you
<br />should know,&quot; the son continued,
<br />&quot;He was hurt pretty badly in the
<br />fighting. He stepped on a land
<br />mine and lost an arm and a leg. He
<br />has nowhere else to go, and I
<br />want him to come live with
<br />us.&quot;&quot;I'm sorry to hear that, son.
<br />Maybe we can help him find
<br />somewhere to live.&quot;&quot;Son,&quot; said the
<br />father, &quot;you don't know what
<br />you're asking. Someone with such
<br />a handicap would be a terrible
<br />burden on us. We have our own
<br />lives to live, and we can't let
<br />something like this interfere with
<br />our lives. I think you should just
<br />come home and forget about this
<br />guy. He'll find a way to live on his
<br />own.&quot;At that point the son hung
<br />up the phone.The parents heard
<br />nothing more from him.A few
<br />days later, however, they
<br />received a call from the San
<br />Francisco Police. Their son had
<br />died after falling from a building,
<br />they were told. The Police believed
<br />it was suicide.The grief stricken
<br />parents flew to San Francisco
<br />and were taken to the city
<br />morgue to identify the body of
<br />their son. They recognised him,
<br />but to their horror they also
<br />discovered something they didn't
<br />know, their son had only one arm
<br />and one leg.The parents in this
<br />story are like many of us.We find
<br />it easy to love those who are
<br />good-looking or fun to be around,
<br />but we don't like people who
<br />inconvenience us or make us feel
<br />uncomfortable. We would rather
<br />stay away from people who
<br />aren't as healthy, beautiful, or as
<br />smart as we are.Thankfully,
<br />there is someone who won't
<br />treat us that way. Someone who
<br />loves us with unconditional love
<br />that welcomes us into the
<br />forever family, regardless of how
<br />messed up we are.Tonight,
<br />before you tuck yourself in for
<br />the night, say a little prayer that
<br />God will give you the strength you
<br />need to accept the people as
<br />they are, and to help us all to be
<br />more understanding of those
<br />who are different from us!Love Is
<br />Accepting People As They Come

<br />cometh, and now is, when the
<br />true worshippers shall worship
<br />the Father in spirit and in truth:
<br />for the Father seeketh such to
<br />worship him. God is a Spirit: and
<br />they that worship him must
<br />worship him in spirit and in truth.'
<br />Notice that the verse above says
<br />we MUST worship God in spirit and
<br />truth, so this is an important
<br />i...ssue. We can be confident that
<br />God reveals everything to us
<br />through His Word and it is the
<br />Word of God in the Bible where we
<br />need to find the answers. There
<br />is a lot of confusion in the
<br />Christian world as to how to
<br />worship God. You only need look at
<br />how many denominations there
<br />are who have their own unique
<br />way of serving and worshipping
<br />God. No matter what others
<br />believe, we must use the bible
<br />and the bible alone as the
<br />foundation of any beliefs.
<br />The purpose of our worship to
<br />God is to give glory and honour to
<br />Him, and our worship isn't
<br />confined to singing a few songs in
<br />a church building once a week, it
<br />goes far deeper than that. Why
<br />do we worship God? We worship
<br />Him because He loves us. We
<br />worship Him because He created
<br />us. We worship Him because he
<br />gave His Son to die for us. We
<br />worship Him because there is no
<br />other God. So how do we worship
<br />God in spirit? Well, think about the
<br />greatest commandment we are
<br />given ..... Mark 12:30 .....'And thou
<br />shalt love the Lord thy God with
<br />all thy heart, and with all thy soul,
<br />and with all thy mind, and with all
<br />thy strength: this is the first
<br />commandment.'.... This sums up
<br />how we should worship God in
<br />spirit. We are to give our all to
<br />Him and for Him. Spirit worship
<br />isn't going to church once a week,
<br />or saying one little prayer a day
<br />or reading out of a devotional
<br />once a day. To worship God in
<br />spirit is to love Him with all your
<br />heart, mind and strength. Do you
<br />realize what that means? It
<br />means you give everything to
<br />Him, your time, your money, your
<br />all, EVERYDAY.
<br />Do you spend more time watching
<br />tv, than you do with God each
<br />day? If so, then you are not
<br />worshipping Him in spirit. God has
<br />to be first in your life every day,
<br />not just once a week, but
<br />EVERYDAY. Christ gave His life for
<br />you. Are you giving your life for
<br />Him? You should be, if you are
<br />worshipping Him in spirit. Think
<br />about it, God is a spirit as it says
<br />in John 4, so He is not concerned
<br />with material things. He is not
<br />concerned with what type of
<br />building you worship in, or how
<br />good the worship band is, or how
<br />funny the preacher is. He is
<br />concerned with your heart .. 1
<br />Chronicles 28:9 ....'And thou,
<br />Solomon my son, know thou the
<br />God of thy father, and serve him
<br />with a perfect heart and with a
<br />willing mind: for the LORD
<br />searcheth all hearts, and
<br />understandeth all the
<br />imaginations of the thoughts: if
<br />thou seek him, he will be found of
<br />thee; but if thou forsake him, he
<br />will cast thee off for ever.' ....
<br />From this verse we can see why
<br />we need to worship God in spirit,
<br />because He knows what is on
<br />your heart (your mind). Therefore
<br />your heart must be right with
<br />God. Give Him your heart every
<br />day, love Him every day, put Him
<br />first in your life every day.
<br />To worship God in truth, means to
<br />worship Him according to His
<br />word ... John 17:17 ....'Sanctify
<br />them through thy truth: thy word
<br />is truth.' .. God's Word is the only
<br />word we can trust. Many
<br />churches are deciding for
<br />themselves how they should
<br />worship God, rather than
<br />consulting with the bible about
<br />how they should worship Him. This
<br />is a God whom seraphims and
<br />cherabims adore and bow down
<br />to.... Revelation 4:8-11 ....'And the
<br />four beasts had each of them six
<br />wings about him; and they were
<br />full of eyes within: and they rest
<br />not day and night, saying, Holy,
<br />holy, holy, LORD God Almighty,
<br />which was, and is, and is to come.
<br />And when those beasts give glory
<br />and honour and thanks to him
<br />that sat on the throne, who liveth
<br />for ever and ever, the four and
<br />twenty elders fall down before
<br />him that sat on the throne, and
<br />worship him that liveth for ever
<br />and ever, and cast their crowns
<br />before the throne, saying, thou
<br />art worthy, O Lord, to receive
<br />glory and honour and power: for
<br />thou hast created all things, and
<br />for thy pleasure they are and
<br />were created.' .. These heavenly
<br />beings worship God Day and night
<br />bowing down before Him, saying
<br />Holy, Holy, Holy. We should
<br />followed the example of these
<br />angels and elders by giving our
<br />hearts in humble adoration of our
<br />Creator.
<br />The bible says we should fear God
<br />and have reverence for Him in
<br />the assembly.. Psalms 89:7 ....'God
<br />is greatly to be feared in the
<br />assembly of the saints, and to be
<br />had in reverence of all them that
<br />are about him.' .... Hebrews
<br />12:28-29 ....'let us have grace,
<br />whereby we may serve God
<br />acceptably with reverence and
<br />godly fear: For our God is a
<br />consuming fire.' .... This is how we
<br />should approach God in church,
<br />with reverence and Godly fear,
<br />but too many people these days
<br />are concerned with pleasing
<br />others before pleasing God.
<br />These two last verses sum up
<br />nicely how to worship God in spirit
<br />and truth.... Psalm 34:1 ....'I will
<br />bless the LORD at all times: his
<br />praise shall continually be in my
<br />mouth.' ... 2 Timothy 2:15 .....'Study
<br />to shew thyself approved unto
<br />God, a workman that needeth not
<br />to be ashamed, rightly dividing
<br />the word of truth.'.... We MUST
<br />walk in the truth of God's Word in
<br />the Bible. He must be on our
<br />hearts and minds every hour of
<br />every day. This is how to worship
<br />God in spirit and all truth

<br />&quot;Why are you crying?&quot; &quot;Because I
<br />am a woman,&quot; she told him. &quot;I
<br />don't understand,&quot; he said. His
<br />Mom just hugged him and said,
<br />&quot;And you never will.&quot; ... Later the
<br />little boy asked his father, &quot;Why
<br />does mother seem to cry for no
<br />reason?&quot; &quot;All women cry for no
<br />reason,&quot; was all his dad could say.
<br />The little boy grew up and
<br />became a man, still wondering
<br />why women cry. Finally he put in a
<br />call to God. When God got on the
<br />phone, he asked, &quot;God, why do
<br />women cry so easily?&quot; God said,
<br />&quot;When I made the woman she had
<br />to be special. I made her
<br />shoulders strong enough to carry
<br />the weight of the world, yet
<br />gentle enough to give comfort. I
<br />gave her an inner strength to
<br />endure child birth and the
<br />rejection that many times comes
<br />from her children. I gave her a
<br />hardness that allows her to keep
<br />going when everyone else gives
<br />up, and take care of her family
<br />through sickness and fatigue
<br />without complaining. I gave her
<br />the sensitivity to love her
<br />children under any and all
<br />circumstances, even when her
<br />child has hurt her very badly. I
<br />gave her strength to carry her
<br />husband through his faults and
<br />fashioned her from his rib to
<br />protect his heart. I gave her
<br />wisdom to know that a good
<br />husband never hurts hiswife, but
<br />sometimes tests her strengths
<br />and her resolve to stand beside
<br />him unfalteringly. And finally, I
<br />gave her a tear to shed. This is
<br />hers exclusively to use whenever
<br />it is needed.&quot; &quot;You see my son,&quot;
<br />said God, &quot;the beauty of a woman
<br />is not in the clothes she wears,
<br />the figure that she carries, or
<br />the way she combs her hair. The
<br />beauty of a woman must be seen
<br />in her eyes, because that is the
<br />doorway to her heart - the place
<br />where love resides.&quot;

<br />operational from 23th March
<br />2013, watch out.
<br />President Obama Vs Revelation
<br />13:15-18US Senate has passed
<br />the 'Obama Health Care' bill into
<br />law &amp;amp; the implementation
<br />would commence on 23/03/
<br />2013.This bill would require all
<br />Americans to be implanted with a
<br />Radio Frequency Identification
<br />(RFID) chip in order to access
<br />medical care. The device will be
<br />implanted on the forehead or on
<br />the arm. This is to fulfill the
<br />prophesy in the Book of
<br />Revelation 13:15-18 concerning
<br />the MARK OF THE BEAST! Are you
<br />still in doubt concerning the
<br />ENDTIME? GET READY! The rapture
<br />is near! Be prepared so you are
<br />not caught unaware. Live a good
<br />life, pray more, preach the
<br />GOSPEL to others and save souls.
<br />Revelations 13 is being played out
<br />right before us. Many are still
<br />unaware. (1) Why is the chip being
<br />implanted exactly where the Bible
<br />says it would be. Why on the hand
<br />and forehead. Why not anywhere
<br />else? (2) Why is it being
<br />connected to your bank account?
<br />Remember the Bible says you
<br />won't be able to buy or sell
<br />without the mark. And guess
<br />what! The chip is connected to
<br />your financial details. What
<br />breaks my heart the most is
<br />that many people in the church
<br />will not make it if Jesus comes
<br />now? Many are unaware that the
<br />end is near.. Don't tell me that its
<br />a developed world process,
<br />technology or something fancy. If
<br />any area of your life is not in
<br />sync with God's word, its time to
<br />make a quick u-turn NOW... Hell is
<br />not a pretty place, the worst
<br />part is that it is for eternity...plea
<br />se rather than post and forward
<br />Boko haram's devilish
<br />accomplishments, join me and
<br />sound the alarm. Send to

<br />I saw you before you were born,
<br />and I destined you for a great
<br />purpose
<br />(Jeremiah 1:5). While your mom
<br />was pregnant with you, I personally
<br />designed you with incredible detail
<br />and precision (Psalm 139:13,14).
<br />From the get-go, I planned so
<br />many amazing things for you, you
<br />could
<br />never even count them if you tried
<br />(Psalm 40:5).
<br />But I knew in advance that you
<br />would go astray and forget me, so
<br />I
<br />asked My perfect Son Jesus to
<br />take your punishment Himself
<br />(Isaiah
<br />53:5). He was willing to be
<br />humiliated and murdered so that
<br />you could
<br />be eternally healed (Isaiah 53:5). He
<br />loved you so much that He came
<br />down to earth to show you what
<br />I'm really like (John 14:7).
<br />When you first believed in Me, I
<br />immediately accepted you into My
<br />own
<br />family (John 1:12). I forgave all your
<br />sins through My Son Jesus (1
<br />John 2:12). And now Jesus is in
<br />Heaven with Me, preparing a place
<br />for
<br />you (John 14:2). In fact, I am living
<br />inside of you because You
<br />believe in My Son (1 John 4:15).
<br />I am forever committed to you;
<br />there is no circumstance under
<br />which I
<br />will leave you or take my love away
<br />from you (Hebrews 13:5; Romans
<br />8:38). Even when you go through
<br />the hardest trials, I will be with you
<br />and carry you through them
<br />(Isaiah 43:2). In fact, I will cause
<br />EVERYTHING to work together for
<br />your good, because you have loved
<br />me
<br />back and I have a great purpose
<br />for you (Romans 8:28).
<br />Is there anything you need right
<br />now? Ask Me. I am your Good
<br />Father
<br />and I won't give you something bad
<br />in return (Matthew 7:11). Actually,
<br />I have My own Spirit readily
<br />available to you to help you in your
<br />weakest hour (Romans 8:26). I
<br />know you get tempted to lose
<br />faith, but
<br />even when you do, I will remain
<br />faithful to you (2 Timothy 2:13). I
<br />want you to ask Me for great
<br />things, because I want to answer
<br />you
<br />(John 16:23). Take a look up at the
<br />heavens; My love for you goes
<br />even
<br />higher than that (Psalm 108:4).
<br />Don't lose heart: I want you to
<br />know
<br />that I am coming back for you
<br />(Revelation 22:12).
<br />And just remember: I AM LOVE (1
<br />John 4:16). I am always patient,
<br />always kind. I'm never envious,
<br />proud or boastful. I'm not rude,
<br />and I
<br />only want the best for you. I don't
<br />get easily irritated with you or
<br />hold a grudge toward you. I am sad
<br />when you are hurt or wronged, but
<br />love when the truth prevails in
<br />your life. I will never stop being
<br />patient with you, never lose hope
<br />or give up on you. I WILL NEVER
<br />QUIT
<br />ON YOU (1 Corinthians 13:4-8).
<br />My love for you is everlasting
<br />(Jeremiah 31:3).
<br />Respond to God
<br />When someone tells another
<br />person they love them, they love
<br />to hear it
<br />back in return. Will you tell God how
<br />much you love and trust Him? He
<br />longs for a beautiful and
<br />committed relationship with you
<br />for the rest
<br />of your life, until you meet Him in
<br />Heaven.

<br />enough. The feeding of the 5,000
<br />men recorded in Matthew
<br />14:13-21, Luke 9:13-17 and John
<br />6:4-11 was probably the most
<br />popular miracles Jesus ever
<br />performed. It was a miracle which
<br />benefited many and eventually
<br />touched their lives.
<br />FEW ESSENTIAL POINTS TO NOTE
<br />FROM THE STORY
<br />THE CHALLENGE:
<br />1. Place: A deserted place.
<br />Location was a problem.
<br />2. Time: The hour is already late.
<br />3. Need: A hungry multitude
<br />(5,000) men to be filled.
<br />4. Resources: Five barley loaves,
<br />two fish.- The resources available
<br />to them was both limited in
<br />quantity and quality.
<br />THE OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO JESUS:
<br />1. DISCIPLES: Send them away;
<br />avoid the challenge
<br />2. JESUS: Give them something to
<br />eat. – commit to the solution.
<br />Don't despise little opportunities.
<br />They may become significant in
<br />the near future.
<br />HOW JESUS ORGANIZES THE
<br />PEOPLE:
<br />Luke 9:14-15
<br />• Jesus knew the full number of
<br />people present. It’s always very
<br />important to see the full extent
<br />of the problem. We must not
<br />under-estimate or overestimate
<br />the problem.
<br />• Jesus re-arranged the people:
<br />When we break down the
<br />problem, solving it becomes
<br />easier.
<br />• Jesus sat everyone down: Our
<br />challenges must not migrate or
<br />move us. It must be tackled at a
<br />time. Challenges need to be
<br />solved at locations where they
<br />occur.
<br />HOW JESUS APPLIED THE
<br />RESOURCES
<br />• He took the bread: - That is
<br />ownership. Whatever resources
<br />God deposits in our hands should
<br />always be appreciated. We must
<br />claim responsibility or ownership
<br />of it.
<br />• He blessed it: Celebration. We
<br />must always thank God even in
<br />the midst of our scarce
<br />resources.
<br />• He broke it. - He released it. Until
<br />we use our available resources,
<br />we cannot tell its value..
<br />• He gave it- Service. Constantly,
<br />we must pray over the little
<br />resources available to us.
<br />NOTE:
<br />• In the hands of the boy – it
<br />was limited
<br />• In the hands of Jesus – it was
<br />celebrated
<br />• In the hands of the Father – it
<br />was energized
<br />• In the hands of Jesus – it was
<br />released
<br />• In the hands of the disciples –
<br />it was multiplied
<br />• In the hands of the people – it
<br />satisfied
<br />WHATEVER RESOURCES WE HAVE IN
<br />OUR HANDS, GOD CAN MULTIPLY IT
<br />TO HIS GLORY. WE MUST NOT
<br />DESPISE LITTLE RESOURCES!!
<br />God bless you!!
