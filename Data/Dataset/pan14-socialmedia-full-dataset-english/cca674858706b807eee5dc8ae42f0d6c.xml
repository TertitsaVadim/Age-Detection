In New England style, I had a single created for her to go with the rest of the linen, with the baby's name on it also.  Hopefully the total set will be one thing that will remain in the family members for a lot of years to come.<br /><br />No discussion on bedding for cribs would be complete with out taking into consideration some essential standard safety problems.
