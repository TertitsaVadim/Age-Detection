She’s telling you everything.  She’s telling about the real story of her and her boyfriend and putting a confirmation or denial to all the rumors that you’ve heard over the last couple of years.  Some of these details shock you.  Some of these details are exactly what you thought they were, but you had no proof.  <br /><br />And then you get to his story, from her point of view.  Somewhere in there might be a recitation of details of how he started out as a prince charming in a 1982 Trans Am who evolved to being a comic book collector with aspirations towards getting his Volvo fixed.  And then there was the case of the wandering.  It could be emotional infidelity, like when he was starting to use her credit card to subscribe to pornographic websites, or even worse, cheating on your spouse type of websites.<br /><br />But then after having said all that, she utters those words that make your eyes do back flips.  She says <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fex-backtips.com%2Fblog%2Fgetting-your-ex-back-do-i-still-have-a-chance%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://ex-backtips.com/blog/getting-your-ex-back-do-i-still-have-a-chance/</a> and I am <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fex-backtips.com%2Fblog%2Fgetting-your-ex-back-do-i-still-have-a-chance%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://ex-backtips.com/blog/getting-your-ex-back-do-i-still-have-a-chance/</a> and I am going to take him back and then I’ll make him pay.  Or words to that effect.  Again, you’re best being a listener and don’t engage yourself to assisting with any nefarious plot.  You might be one on the other hand, devising this nefarious plot.  But if you want her to try to get back with her ex, those will have to be put on the side.  If she wants to try to get back, you’ve got to help her, or else help her see the wrongness of that decision. <br /><br />If they are of a new age bent, maybe they’ll be wanting to light candles and conjure up good spirits and peaceful vibes to re-seduce the guy (or girl as the case may be) and start out on a different level, reducing the infidelity to a minor irritant on a long journey. Whether or not you believe in voodoo, it can be an occasion for having her exist in a space that is not completely inhabited by his spirit.  <br /><br />Love potions and love spells will be one way in which the chi of the relationships gets readjusted.  Red colored paper, calligraphic printing, rose colored glass, it allows for two girls to draw in all of the mystical energy that creates positive vibes.  Or not, as the case may be.<br /><br />And that point is where the infidelity or the indiscretion is forgiven, and the partners can either move towards starting a new life or move back towards giving the relationship a new start.  It’s enviable when it works, and it’s a long shot, but it’s one worth taking.

Do you wander around your daily life aimlessly just thinking about your ex and how you can be <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fex-backtips.com%2Fblog%2Fgetting-your-ex-back-do-i-still-have-a-chance%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://ex-backtips.com/blog/getting-your-ex-back-do-i-still-have-a-chance/</a> and wondering if it’s ever going to be possible after the fights that have gone on between you.  Things were said on both sides that were not meant and it seems like you cannot find a way back to being with her.  Maybe things can be worked out if only you could get a chance to speak to each other on neutral turf.  Should you ask her out for coffee or will she just refuse you and honestly, could you take another rejection at this point when your heart is hurting so much?  You had it all when she was in your life but you didn’t even realize it and now you would do anything to get that feeling and her back again. “<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fex-backtips.com%2Fblog%2Fgetting-your-ex-back-do-i-still-have-a-chance%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://ex-backtips.com/blog/getting-your-ex-back-do-i-still-have-a-chance/</a>!” you say.  <br /><br />You think that you had everything that a man could want and you let it slip through your fingers.  Going out to a party or to a bar seems hollow because every girl reminds you of her. Maybe you listen to your song over and over again on the iPod but it doesn’t matter, every song that you hear ends up reminding you of her again.  She’s everywhere you look and…well, isn’t it time that you did something about it?<br /><br />You are quite obviously miserable without her so find a way to get her back.  Don’t wait for nature to take its course.  It might never happen or worse, she could meet someone else and then it would be truly over between you.  You have the advantage of knowing where to find her because you know her you will know where she likes to hang out.  In other words, you can find her. When you find her, ask her if you can talk. If she can’t talk now or seems upset make a date with her to have coffee the next morning.  You don’t need to mention ‘having a talk,’ just offer coffee.  This almost always works and gives her time to get her emotions in order so that she can handle the talk without emotion levels being so high. <br /><br />When you have figured out a way to talk to her, now pay attention guys this is important, LISTEN to what she has to say.  Tell her what you want to tell her only after you have really listened to her and her point of view.   Don’t talk over her or try to interrupt her.  Let her get out whatever she has to say and with any luck you can smooth your problems together over.

Well, you can cast a spell, and we’ll get back to that in a minute, but there are many other ways of <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fex-backtips.com%2Fblog%2Fgetting-your-ex-back-do-i-still-have-a-chance%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://ex-backtips.com/blog/getting-your-ex-back-do-i-still-have-a-chance/</a> , ex boyfriends, ex friends of any kind.  <br /><br />Okay, we’ll just sprinkle a bit of spell wisdom in between a few steps in the direction of casting, just for entertainment value.  First you’ve got to get a local cast-speller, but they go under the names of mediums, new age forecasters and shamans.  Ask around among your friends if they’ve had a good experience.  Shell out only as much money as you believe is necessary to bear legitimacy to the first session.  <br /><br />But you’ve got to be logical in between spell casting sessions with your local savant; you’ve got to think about what got you into this situation and what it all means for your future.  You’ve got to understand if you did something wrong, and how your ex partner has been communicating things that you should think about, even if it’s too late to repair the damage of words said or actions done.  <br /><br />One way of spell casting is to take the desired lover’s name, write it on paper, hold them in your right hand and visualize all the good feelings and ideas that would come out of a true relationship with that person.  Keep it up for a while, like a meditation.  <br />Another option is right there for you, provided by people who knew there would be a demand for it: internet spell casting.  Don’t spend any money on these, unless you’re of the opinion that wireless communications are a spiritual force through the world.  But this is one where you can have a bit of fun without having to interact with an actual other human being.  <br />You might want to go to a “professional” spell caster once to get someone who can advise you on the whole process as well, before you see what there is available at your own terminal.<br /><br />You’re in a painful way and this person might be the one who you can speak to; many of the best readers have abilities that might be seen in a very expensive psychiatrist, and here, you’re not getting sloshed over a five hour period while doling out your woes to a bartender who is hard of hearing anyway.  It’s time for you to contemplate the break up, and decide what measures you want to take to rekindle a lost love.

But, do you, really?  How desperate are you, and how much do you want to apply you imagination towards the ways in which you can work at <br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fex-backtips.com%2Fblog%2Fgetting-your-ex-back-do-i-still-have-a-chance%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://ex-backtips.com/blog/getting-your-ex-back-do-i-still-have-a-chance/</a>  or girlfriend?<br /><br />You can draw on a long tradition of love spells, by going through literature and seeing how it was done back in the days of Shakespeare, or you can go on line and find all sorts of enchantments that you can draw upon.  Be aware that officially, all of this is “entertainment” and not something that you should take seriously.  But inspiration is a close partner to improvisation and imagination, so once you’ve taken done the process with grain of salt, let it make you think about your normal world afterwards.  <br /><br />If you are trying to get a spell to work on someone you want back, there are specific techniques to follow according to tradition.  <br /><br />Check out your neighborhood for anyone who’s got experience in the art of casting spells or at least knows what to do if they’ve got a step by step guide.  Possibly someone who’s a lot into Buffy the Vampire Slayer or Charmed or other fictions that have tried to portray the process of casing spells in a reasonably realistic manner.  Leave behind anyone who is into really bad and negative vibes, like the witches you might have seen in the series True Blood.  Check in the yellow pages for “shamans”, “new age” or “mediums”.<br /><br />Don’t spend too much money on the process, but don’t be carnival-cheap and try to expect much out of a reading that’s for a couple of bucks.  But don’t start making long-term financial arrangements if you’re impressed by them on the first paying date.  You might ask for a guarantee, but what are they guaranteeing?  That they will be able to predict the future with accuracy?  If you’re ready to shell out hundreds of bucks, get that kind of guarantee in writing, though it will still make for an odd small-court appearance.  <br /><br />It’s all about imagination, and the ability of the reader to draw from your own insights about your life.  A bad reader will just manipulate the facts that you give to him or her and give you what they think you want to hear.  A good one will take the facts and spell out numerous possibilities for futures, and your instincts will help you pick out the most likely ones.  In addition that good reader will also make you think of possibilities that you had not considered.

You still can go out and spread nasty gossip about him in an extended outing among the local taverns, you can go blitzoid for a few days in an attempt to blot him out of your mind forever, and you can go the local firing range to take out your aggression on a target (but don’t ask to paste a picture of him on the target; red flag), just like he would.  But you know there are many other things to do in this time of limbo.  <br /><br />This truth will churn your guts over and over again, though: you’re not sure it’s over and you’re saying that I want my ex back.  You’re not sure if it is something you really want to do, but you don’t vomit when you utter the words in a slurry fashion after your fourth cocktail.  Hold the further olives, please, because there’s something that just isn’t right.  Here you are celebrating the passing of the relationship and putting away the fact that it was him dumping you, but you still are thinking about ways of <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fex-backtips.com%2Fblog%2Fgetting-your-ex-back-do-i-still-have-a-chance%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://ex-backtips.com/blog/getting-your-ex-back-do-i-still-have-a-chance/</a> ”, whatever his name is, because you’re now seeing double and you forgot it.  Looks like your attempts at blotting were successful, although probably temporary.   Wait until the morning to sort it out.  <br /><br />Or maybe now that you’re home in safety, you can’t get to sleep because of those four coffees you had at the diner after dancing all night. And then you’re telling yourself repeatedly what you want, alternating between “I don’t want my ex back” and “<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fex-backtips.com%2Fblog%2Fgetting-your-ex-back-do-i-still-have-a-chance%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://ex-backtips.com/blog/getting-your-ex-back-do-i-still-have-a-chance/</a> ”. So what do you do while you sit at your kitchen table at four in the morning, spooning in your personal stash of Rocky Road Ice Cream.  You look towards the future, and whether it’s worth the effort to renew the vows, the promises and the intentions that made your relationship look like a good idea at the time.   <br /><br />If you want to get back with him after he’s dumped you, though, it will be a more complicated road.  There are obviously reasons that have led to this, but since it’s a guy, he probably doesn’t know how to cohesively put them in the form of a string of sentences, let alone an understandable argument.  Still, you’ll want to be open to follow his logic at first, until you can find within that the truth of if he would like to be back with you or not.

You don’t have to have a psychology degree to figure out the important things between you and him, but you have to think like a guy a bit, because the fact is that male knowledge is kind of skewed.  <br /><br />If you’re a man who’s going through a breakup, and you too are wanting to see if there is a possibility that what has broken you apart can be repaired, this time of limbo is important.  No matter which one took the final step to say that the relationship is over, you have to look at that last event and afterwards reflect on signs that may have led up to it for a long time but were invisible.<br /><br />A woman might want to avoid crying and being annoying about it in public; this is a personal relationship and you should be careful with whom you’re going to share the details of the last few days, weeks, maybe even years.  But you want to talk about it, so just be prepared, if you’re interested in rekindling the love, to be objective.  Find friends that you had in common before you became a couple, and see how they interpret recent events in your relationship.  <br /><br />A man might want to punch holes into random walls (again, if you have to, keep it at home), and rage against the night through any means available, including a four day marathon of kill-kill-kill video games.  Moderation is suggested when using these forms of aversion therapy, and if he wants to look at the possibility of reunion, he will also have to hold his tongue in public.  History can wait, because it will always be a part of you.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fex-backtips.com%2Fblog%2Fgetting-your-ex-back-do-i-still-have-a-chance%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://ex-backtips.com/blog/getting-your-ex-back-do-i-still-have-a-chance/</a>  or ex boyfriend situations are complicated and don’t really have the symmetry that got the couple together in the first place.  One may love more, one may be irritated more, one may have grown in a different direction, but all of the possibilities have to be seen from two sides, and by each party, before both can make a move to either assessing once and for all if it is all over or if it’s worth rekindling with a new understanding reached that prevents the bad moves from reoccurring.<br /><br />Both parties will benefit from the idea that they could change their mind for valid reasons, but time is needed for one to collect thoughts that move in a positive way, whether you were the one that initiated the break up or not.  If there are things that have to be said, let them be said without bitterness; this is a basis on which many couples live through crisis, because they can learn from mistakes without having to assess blame.

Obviously, the most that you’ll notice as changing would be yourself.  Your tastes in music were kind of embarrassing, but at least your guilty pleasures made you part of the crowd back then and there is still a tune or two that you’ll be able to hum along to.  Your taste in clothes was exquisite if you were a girl, pathetic if you were a guy in the situation of looking at the photos that were taken with your permission when you had no shame a couple of decades ago.  But there was the that moment when your projecting in the past rebooted itself with an alternate outcome, a universe where you were still with that person you loved in high school and then you think about the possibilities of <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fex-backtips.com%2Fblog%2Fgetting-your-ex-back-do-i-still-have-a-chance%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://ex-backtips.com/blog/getting-your-ex-back-do-i-still-have-a-chance/</a>  or ex girlfriend.  <br /><br />But are you really saying that &quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fex-backtips.com%2Fblog%2Fgetting-your-ex-back-do-i-still-have-a-chance%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://ex-backtips.com/blog/getting-your-ex-back-do-i-still-have-a-chance/</a> &quot; after so many years?  It’s possible, you know, and many find a chance at true love in their late thirties and forties through events like this which help them restart the possibilities from a point of wisdom that comes from years of experience that you didn’t have back then.  In a way, reflecting on the new possibilities for the old flame, it’s no different than if you had just broken up; you still have to look at the reasons you were together back then, and what came between you.  But from this vantage point, you can now see that you are different, and so is that other person, and that those reasons might have evaporated, or be exactly the same, or somewhere in between.  <br /><br />If you broke up in a rage, chances are you aren’t carrying that chip around anymore, and why should you?  What is to be desired is that youthful passions and the foundations of life that you were starting to explore back then can still be there, and could be that they have matured.  You might have been a budding singer-songwriter but circumstances led to your becoming senior pilot for a small airline in the Australian outback.  She might have started studying pedagogy and wound up being executive assistant to the International Council of Widget Standards.  But you were attracted to her, and she was attracted to you.  <br /><br />It is also possible that the years have not healed a hurt that one or the other inflicted, and that great distance contributing to something of an open wound or a loose end to stay that way hindered a natural healing.  It’s a good time to ask what you did wrong, or what was hurtful.  It will be time for apologies and bygones, and once that is out of the way, you’ll be able to realistically reflect on if you want your ex back after all this time.  It might just be for a short time, for the remembering of a flame, after which you’ll return to your present life so far away.

If you’re like most guys, chances are that you still don’t know exactly why or how you were wrong, or to what extent it was different than other things you have been forgiven about in the past.  But you are wrong, you know at least that much.  There is much to do before you can take measures towards <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fex-backtips.com%2Fblog%2Fgetting-your-ex-back-do-i-still-have-a-chance%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://ex-backtips.com/blog/getting-your-ex-back-do-i-still-have-a-chance/</a> s, ex boyfriends, or even ex friends of all kind since close friendships don’t have to be heavy relationships in order to create a situation of heartbreak and feelings of betrayal, if not of actions, then of ideals that are violated.<br /><br />Just standing in front of the mirror and chanting like your favorite motivational speaker tells you to do, repeating over and over “<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fex-backtips.com%2Fblog%2Fgetting-your-ex-back-do-i-still-have-a-chance%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://ex-backtips.com/blog/getting-your-ex-back-do-i-still-have-a-chance/</a> ” and acting like the Little Engine That Could might get you in some kind of movement but you have to do some thinking.  If the breakup is recent, though, you may want to do some drinking before some thinking; one heartache at the time.  Don’t use it to feel more bitterness that you are entitled to within the realm of good taste, if possible.  If you want another chance, now is not the time to proclaim to everyone at the local tavern the reasons why you were the victim in this situation.  It is the time to concentrate on the football or baseball playoffs when you’re with the others, and for now, keep the relationship as much as possible between you and your ex, so that you’re not shattering trust and intimacy by going outside for feedback.  But you still have a right to your opinion of the events that lead to the break up, and people will be willing to listen to your story.  Twice.  Maybe three times, but you’re pushing it at that point.  <br /><br />Advice will come to you from all directions, and some of them will be wanting money for the consultation.  You will be given your ex’s version of events if you are willing to listen.  You can find friends that you have in common, and you don’t have to reveal the extent to which you will go to get your ex back.  It can be a time to learn about her and reevaluate some of the events that your friends know about.  You must keep the conversation positive, because if you convey anger and bitterness, it will surely be passed on to her through one branch of gossip or another.  <br /><br />Finally, after you’ve been able to make an honest assessment of your relationship, you’re ready for the next step.  It may be that you’ve been a jerk after all of the evidence that you know about and that has been related to you, and that seeking steps to overcome keeping a jerk status or worse might be a way to work towards rekindling the union you once had.  But you have to accept that it may be too late and it’s time to dip back into the personals for the next step in your life.

It might outrage her, but it signifies more than anything else that you’ve moved on and if you want to say to her that “I want my ex back”, she most likely won’t take you seriously.  So get that technique out of the way as a form of possible process of reconciliation.  <br /><br />Now that we’ve gotten that out of the way, let’s look at the situation of a guy who has broken up with his girl, and this applies to married men who are now in a serious danger of moving towards the step to divorce.  There are ways in which you can use common sense, imbue it with a sense of the calm, and rationally look at what has happened, first in order to really understand if the passion that was once there can be rekindled, and second to figure out the ways that your ex will find acceptable.  It’s about finding the right compromises to permit you to move forward, and that may mean eating some humble pie.<br /><br />It isn’t enough just to say &quot;I’m sorry&quot; or &quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fex-backtips.com%2Fblog%2Fgetting-your-ex-back-do-i-still-have-a-chance%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://ex-backtips.com/blog/getting-your-ex-back-do-i-still-have-a-chance/</a> &quot; in a thousand different ways; you just look like a stalker if you’re trying to impress someone with obsessive repetition and here is a place where you really need to pay heed to the law of diminished expectations.  The hundredth “I love you” will hardly be heard at all, if they all point to the same fact that you’re actually saying “and I don’t know what I did wrong.”    <br /><br />Obviously the first thing to remember is to not appear like a stalker.  That means that if you’ve got something you want to say to her – and don’t make it a bitter note about some unresolved issue – you do it once and wait for her response.  If there is no response after a certain time, that will be your response and you’ve either got to wait even longer or see if she wants to move on.  But don’t also play the martyr.  When you have a breakup, there will be certain expectations that you might want to party the feeling out of your system, but just remember to keep it cool.  There are still personal things between you that the public doesn’t need to hear about, even if it isn’t something that might damage the reputation of the other.  Privacy and respect for that privacy is a strong element of a good relationship.

Did you make the mistake of thinking that you could change him from what was forever condemned to be his true self?  Have you been true to yourself in the process of breaking up with him or are you thinking already of <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fex-backtips.com%2Fblog%2Fgetting-your-ex-back-do-i-still-have-a-chance%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://ex-backtips.com/blog/getting-your-ex-back-do-i-still-have-a-chance/</a> s from the past just to get back at him, or worse, just to think that this is a way of saying in a not too effective way, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fex-backtips.com%2Fblog%2Fgetting-your-ex-back-do-i-still-have-a-chance%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://ex-backtips.com/blog/getting-your-ex-back-do-i-still-have-a-chance/</a> . <br /><br />Let’s just say here and now that going to former exes has not been proven to get your ex back out of some kind of mixture of jealousy and empathy.  And if he knows that you’ve already moved on, if you do get back with him, it might not be on terms that you can find acceptable.  So before you take the next step, think of the other steps that you need to take to make sure that you want to make this a clear and free break, if you want to break up at all.  <br /><br />Doubt will not be your friend, but for a while it might be a useful companion, especially if you are not the type of person who easily looks at the mistakes that they have made in the past.  This is a time for reflection, and if you feel it’s time to move on, then you’ve got to psychologically set yourself up in a space where it’s okay.  You’ll need to get rid of the bitterness, but you can also do with this with a night on the town with the girls to get rid of the gnawing pieces of gossip that have been floating around, and even to try and get a picture of the whole situation from a third party, possibly even a friend to the both of you who can give an objective opinion.   <br /><br />As a modern woman, the time has long since passed since women had to get special permission to walk out of a relationship, and even longer since they needed to plead to be loved.  This is a mode of thought that should be left to the past.  But you have to think of methods that would work to first melt the ice, and then to allow yourselves some room and some strategies to work things out.  He, being a guy, most likely will be confused if it has been building up for a long time in you and he had no clue that you have had any discomfort in the relationship.
