This is a container company that provides a variety of steel containers to their customers throughout the UK. They have shipping containers, storage containers, and portable cabins. They offer these items for hire or for sale, and they will even purchase used containers and cabins. <br /><br />Willbox recently rebranded from Williams Cabins &amp; Containers, and they have experience in the storage industry especially. Now, they have expanded what they can offer. This company is part of a larger one, which is called Williams Shipping Holdings, Ltd., and it was founded over 100 years ago. <br /><br />When you are looking for the right steel containers for your business, Willbox offers a very simply process that allows you to find exactly what you need. <br /><br />Step One: Pick Your Size<br /><br />You can start this process by calling Willbox and arranging the details over the phone, or they have an online Willbox Selector tool that allows you to pick out your container. The first thing that you want to determine is the size of container you need. You can find steel containers that are as small as six feet in length or as long as forty feet in length. Eight feet, ten feet, and twenty feet are also common sizes. <br /><br />All of Willbox’s steel containers are built to the ISO standard, and they are plated so that they can be used with heavy loads. <br /><br />Step Two: Customise Your Container<br /><br />Once you have determined the size of container you need, you can customise your container. For example, you can choose to receive containers in nearly every colour of the rainbow. So, if you want your containers to match your brand’s colours, you can. Also, you can add a number of accessories such as twist locks, personnel doors, ramps, insulation, electrics, partitions, and more. This customisation process allows you to create the kind of container you need quickly and easily. <br /><br />Step Three: Pick Your Terms <br /><br />During this process, you will also want to decide on your terms. For example, you can choose to hire or to buy the containers. Also, you can choose from new or used containers. If you contact Willbox directly, you can learn more about their rates and terms and conditions. <br /><br />Step Four: Arrange a Delivery Date<br /><br />Once you have worked out all of the details concerning your steel containers all that is left is to arrange a delivery date. Willbox has an in house delivery team, and they can transport your containers throughout the UK, and they will work with you to arrange a delivery time that is convenient for you. All you need to ensure is that you have suitable access for their crane truck. Mainly this means that you need to have an area where the truck can easily turn around and set the container down. <br /><br />When it comes to steel containers, you should contact Willbox because they can offer the type of container that you need and deliver it to your doorstep. <br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy50ZXN0ZWQuY29tL3Byb2ZpbGUvbmFzc2ltaGVybmFuMTEvYmxvZ3MvMjA1MTgwLw__" target="_blank">Steel Containers from Willbox</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5zdXBlcm5vdmEuY29tL0tydWVnb3BlckJ5dnJkZWVhbmEvYmxvZy8zNjYyNzM_" target="_blank">Steel Containers from Willbox</a>
