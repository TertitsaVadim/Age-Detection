<br /><br />Make sure you get there first.
<br /><br />The apple of your eye.
<br /><br />The rotten core inside.
<br /><br />We are the prisoners.
<br /><br />Things couldn't get much worse.
<br /><br />I've had it up to here, you know your end is near.
<br /><br />[Chorus]
<br /><br />You had to have it all,
<br /><br />well have you had enough?
<br /><br />You greedy little bastard,
<br /><br />you'll get what you deserve.
<br /><br />When all is said and done,
<br /><br />I will be the one to leave you in the misery and hate what you've become.
<br /><br />Intoxicated eyes, the love and myth, that life.
<br />You should have learned by now, 
<br />I'll burn this whole world down. 
<br />I need some piece of mind, no fear of what's behind. 
<br />You think you've won this fight, you've
<br /><br />only lost your mind.
<br /><br />[Chorus]
<br /><br />You had to have it all,
<br /><br />well have you had enough?
<br /><br />You greedy little bastard,
<br /><br />you'll get what you deserve.
<br /><br />When all is said and done,
<br /><br />I will be the one to leave you in the misery and hate what you've become.
<br /><br />Hold me down.
<br /><br />[Chorus]
<br /><br />You had to have it all,
<br /><br />well have you had enough?
<br /><br />You greedy little bastard,
<br /><br />you'll get what you deserve.
<br /><br />When all is said and done,
<br /><br />I will be the one to leave you in the misery and hate what you've become.
<br /><br />Heaven help you.

		<document id="c83e743cccd636ebc1b3253dc65ada57" url=""><![CDATA[I don't know why but :<br/><br/>I'm not entirely sure why I am gonna put this here but my friend just sent it to me so um I thought I would share it cause...I'm in a really pensive mood and only furthered it... just cause..its something simple :
<br /><br />ONE. Give people more than they expect and do it cheerfully.
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt;TWO. Marry a man/woman you love to talk to. As you get older, their 
<br />&gt;conversational skills will be as important as any other.
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt;THREE. Don't believe all you hear, spend all you have or sleep all you 
<br />&gt;want.
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt; FOUR. When you say, 'I love you,' mean it.
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt;FIVE. When you say, 'I'm sorry,' look the person in the eye.
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt; SIX. Be engaged at least six months before you get married.
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt;SEVEN. Believe in love at first sight.
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt;EIGHT. Never laugh at anyone's dream. People who don't have dreams don't 
<br />&gt;have much.
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt;NINE. Love deeply and passionately. You might get hurt but it's the only 
<br />&gt;way to live life completely.
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt;TEN. In disagreements, fight fairly. No name calling.
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt;ELEVEN. Don't judge people by their relatives.
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt;TWELVE. Talk slowly but think quickly.
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt;THIRTEEN. When someone asks you a question you don't want to answer, smile 
<br />&gt;and ask, 'Why do you want to know?'
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt;FOURTEEN. Remember that great love and great achievements involve great 
<br />&gt;risk...
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt;FIFTEEN. Say 'bless you' when you hear someone sneeze.
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt;SIXTEEN. When you lose, don't lose the lesson
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt;SEVENTEEN. Remember the three R's: Respect for self; Respect for others; 
<br />&gt;and responsibility for all your actions.
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt;EIGHTEEN. Don't let a little dispute injure a great friendship.
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt;NINETEEN. When you realize you've made a mistake, take immediate steps to 
<br />&gt;correct it.
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt;TWENTY. Smile when picking up the phone. The caller will hear it in your 
<br />&gt;voice.
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt;TWENTY-ONE. Spend some time alone.
<br /><br />Some of them are lame but...others kind of made me smile....Have a nice day,homies &lt;3

<br />I'm sorry
<br />that i bought you roses
<br />to tell you that i like you
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />That I was raised with respect
<br />not to sleep with you when you were drunk
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />That my body's not ripped enough
<br />to &quot;satisfy&quot; your wants
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />that I open your car door,
<br />and pull out your chair like I was raised
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />That I'm not cute enough
<br />to be &quot;your guy&quot;
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />That I am actually nice;
<br />not an asshole&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />I don't have a huge bank account
<br />to buy you expensive things
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />I like to spend quality nights at home
<br />cuddling with you, instead of at a club
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />I would rather make love to you then just f**k you
<br />like some random guy.
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />That I am always the one you need to talk to,
<br />but never good enough to date
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />That I always held your hair back when you threw up,and didn't get mad at you for puking in my car,
<br />but when we went out you went home with another guy
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />That I am there to pick you up at 4am when your new man hit you and dropped you off in the middle of nowhere,
<br />but not good enough to listen to me when I need a friend
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />If I start not being there, and being used as a door mat, only to be thrown to the side when the new asshole comes around
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />If I don't answer my phone anymore when you call, to listen to you cry for hours, instead of getting a couple hours of sleep before work
<br /><br />I'm sorry that you can't realize.. I've been the one all along.
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />If you read this and know somebody like this
<br />but don't care But most of all
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />For not being sorry anymore
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />That you can't accept me for who I am
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />I can never do anything right, and nothing that I do is good
<br />enough to make it in your world.
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />I caught your bf with another girl and told you about it, I thought that was what friends were for...
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />That I told you I loved you and actually meant it.
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />That I talked to you for nine hours on Thanksgiving when your bf was threatening you instead of spending time with my family.
<br /><br />I'm Sorry
<br />That i cared
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />that I listen to you at night talk about how you wish you could have done something different.
<br /><br />Ladies always bitch and bitch to their friends that there is never any good guys out there, and they always end up with assholes who mistreat them. Well ladies next time you're bitching, maybe look up to see who you're bitching to, maybe that special someone is right there hanging on your every word as usual, screaming in his head &quot;Why won't you give me a chance?&quot;
<br />Because the person you are usually searching for is right by you
<br /><br />If you're a guy and you agree with this letter, repost as &quot;I'm sorry &quot;
<br /><br />If You're one of the few girls with enough courage to repost, and you would never make your guy feel this way, repost as &quot;To all the girls who look past the nice guys&quot;***

<br /><br />Racism is wrong and can often times destroy people's self confidence. It's a horrible and cruel way to treat people. To prove that we are all alike, try this simple experiment: Hold your hand up to a light of some kind. You'll see a shadow cast nearby. Now, have someone of a different race hold their hand up too. You'll see, essentially, the same image. Five fingers and a palm. Skin color doesn't matter when you get right down to it. If you are against racism, copy this message and my symbol for equality to your profile.

<br />I'm not gonna react
<br />I'm not doing shit for you

<br />I'm not living a lie
<br />While you swim in denial
<br />'Cause you're already dead and gone
<br />You'll leave me out on the curb
<br />Just like everyone else before you
<br /><br />[Chorus]
<br />Welcome to my world
<br />Where everyone I ever need
<br />Always ends up leaving me alone
<br />Another lesson burned
<br />And I'm drowning in the ashes
<br />Kicking
<br />Screaming
<br />Welcome to my world
<br /><br />I don't care what you think
<br />I'm not seeing a shrink
<br />I'm not doing this again
<br />I'm not another
<br />Student or a mother
<br />To take your shit out on
<br />So let's see what you got
<br />And let's see what you're not
<br />And whatever else you pretend
<br />You've defended my intentions
<br />Long enough
<br /><br />[Chorus]
<br /><br />So here I am again
<br />In the middle of the end
<br />And the choice I wish I'd made
<br />I always make too late
