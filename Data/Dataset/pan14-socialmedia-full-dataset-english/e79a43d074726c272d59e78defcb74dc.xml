Where we are now we see nothing but a perfect life for yourself, but you watch the news or something and you realise what the world is actually coming to. One strike of danger in your family or your friends, your world falls apart. 
<br />We have the perfect people - the pretty, good looking, model like girls, they know their pretty and everything, but their life isnt perfect, they may have something to hide.
<br />The not so perfect people - May not be pretty or good looking or model like, but their not perfect.
<br />How can people use the word perfect? Perfect doesnt excist. Nothing is Perfect.
<br /><br />Dont you hate it when you have been in a relationship for a while and it falls apart because someone else comes into their life and ruins yours?
<br />Well i think the reason for that is to stop the biggest mistake or heartbreak. It may hurt when that happens but if you think, if it didnt happen it could have turned out even worse. 
<br /><br />When you like someone... You cant tell them because your scared of what they will say or how they react. 
<br />I like someone, but i wont tell them because im not right for him. Hes miles better then me and could get someone else better then me. People tell me to tell him but i cant because i get scared. Iv only just started talking to him aswell, but straight away hes a a great guy. I ask him questions which i ask every guy. Hes the only one whos answered them with the answers i was looking for. He could be what i need at this moment, but i wont get that chance because theres no way he would ever like me.
<br /><br />Im a retard for writing this but just wanted my thoughts out. 
<br />If you read this thanks for your time. And i might continue this.. If people like it lol. It would be the life and mind of a 15 year old lol.
<br /><br />Thanks

<br />I really want to tell him but i dont want to sound like a right prat!
<br />Have only just started talking to him and hes a great guy.
<br />In my past i havent had the best of boyfriends.
<br />But him he makes me smile so much my cheeks hurt and makes me laugh so much that i get to the point of crying of laugher. Have never been this happy for ages. =[ 
<br />Im scared to tell him because im not his sort.
<br />Im not really that pretty or anything. Hes like amazing great personality and hes proper good looking... which is a bonus.
<br />I dont think he likes me like that anyway becuase he might like someone else wayyyy better then me.
<br /><br />Any ideas??
<br /><br />Thanks for your time!

<br />Just wondering like..
<br />Have you ever been scared to have a new relationship because of your past?
<br /><br />For Example...
<br />Your ex boyfriend.. you was with him more then half a year. Leaves you for another girl. Regrets everything he did with you.. and regrets having you in his life. After everything you been through he calls you a scum. 
<br />He made you go against your bestest friend, by saying something like she tried it on wit me or something.
<br />He made you go against your family.. Starting arguements with them causing trouble.. always making you want him back.
<br />Made you want no other person because you thought he was the one.
<br />He changed you into something.. That none of your friends knew could have happened. 
<br />Over half a year a complete waste. 
<br />You've changed.. Its hard to go back. 
<br /><br />Are you scared it might happen again?
<br />Are you worried you will be hurt twice as much?
<br />Are you prepared for a new relationship?
<br /><br />Yes im scared
<br />Yes im worried
<br />And yes im prepared.
<br />Maybe this time it will be different. You got to take the risk. That maybe this time could be the best time. But it wont ever be the worst time because you already experienced it.
<br /><br />Thanks for reading =]
<br />Thanks for your time
<br />Thanks if you leave comments =]

<br />BUT
<br />There's just been this major crash!
<br />=[ My ex.. From like last year.. Have been close friends since the break up, well he wants 2 go bk out with me. But im not sure because i really like this other guy. 
<br />With my ex i could trust him with anything.. But with this other guy i could get a new experience... 
<br />=[
<br />Am mega confused.. And like ye just really confused i dont know what to do with the whole situation.
<br /><br />Anywhoooo
<br />Today.. Been an ok day. Got mega pissed off at some people but i had the right to. Also have people bitchin bout me as i have found out.. 
<br /><br />Time to Think..
<br />Have you ever looked at the world.. and thought what would it be like if the grass was blue and the sky was green?
<br />We'd think that would look wrong, but if it was like that originally we would think that if the grass was green and the sky was blue that would be wrong.
<br />Have you ever thought how people managed to get internet, digital boxes, mobile phones and alsorts.
<br />Have you ever thought how we can see colour... and how things have their own colour.. 
<br /><br />Maybe you could ask yourself the true meaning of love.
<br />Why we haveour friends
<br />Why we end up alone sometimes
<br />Why maybe we could all be the same but we really aren't 
<br />OR
<br />Why we was born this way.. How did the world truely begin.
<br /><br />Yes i think weirdly. 
<br /><br />ANYYYYWHOOO
<br />Thanks for your time and comments =]

<br />Well.. Hmmm
<br />Everything kind of going wrong =]
<br />Nothing new there.
<br />I decided i really hate Applied Business =]
<br />I want to change it or drop it =]
<br />Doubt i can though =[
<br />Im slacking in it.. Im really behind on the coursework.. Like i have a whole piece of coursework to do.  
<br />The lesson is sooooo boring its unblieveable... Had 4 of us today sleeping in it.
<br /><br />Got annoyed today. 
<br />Cant trust many people now..
<br />They are bitching bout me or something.
<br />All im doing is being honest and being who i am but i have to change to be liked... Why do i have to change who i am? When the saying is.. You were born to stand out. =]
<br /><br />Hmm Weird Thoughts...
<br />We are all ment to stand out.. But why do we go with the fashion.. Why do we do what others do? Why cant we like do what we want to do? Well you can you just got to be brave enough to stand up to them.. But no one ever is.. Why is that?
<br />Hey what the hell why not stand out.. Ye you may get dodgey looks from people but least you know you stand out.. 
<br />Why do we get the nice guys... who turn out to be right pricks?
<br />Why do most people depend on looks? When you could be missing someone so great?
<br />Wouldnt it be funny if you like someone but the person you love is right infront of you and you never notice because you didnt think of them that way. Can you picture someone being there for you your whole life and you was nothing but friends but end up falling in love?
<br />Love.. Strong word with many meanings.
<br />You love something or someone.
<br />Love.. What a strange word.
<br />Ever wanted that fairy tale story of love?
<br />The Romeo and Juliet kind?
<br />Yup i have.
<br />Two people destined for eachother to change the future.. of two rival families. Their lifes taken to prove the point of how far it really has gone.
<br />=[
<br />Need someone I can trust, who will be there for me, who will love me for me, wont be ashamed.
<br />Bit to much to ask for nowadays.
<br /><br />WOOOT!!! MCR CONCERT 2MOZ AND IM GOING WITH MY BESTEST FRIEND!!! WOOOT!!! WHOS GOING? lol
<br /><br />Thanks for your time and comments =]

<br />All around me someone has got another.. But im sitting here all alone.
<br />What does other people have that i dont. 
<br />Aren't i good enough?
<br />Why do i have to try and change to get someone?
<br />Cant i just be who i am?
<br />Be loved for who i am?
<br />Whys it so hard just to find that someone you can trust and love and hold and will always be there for you when you need them?
<br />Whys it so hard for people to look under the skin?
<br />Whys it hard for them to remove the ugliness or the prettiness and see who they really are behind all the make-up the clothes.. and look into there heart?
<br />Is i really that hard for someone to notice that?
<br /><br />Why cant i find someone who can undersand? Why do i get told the same thing over and over again.. That i should wait. But i have been waiting and im sick of everyone getting someone and i sit alone. 
<br /><br />My friends are ditching me for their boyfriends.
<br />Im basically alone.

<br />When you really care for them?
<br />You miss them every second their not online
<br />You cant stop thinking about them 
<br />You want to tell them how you feel but you cant
<br />Or
<br />You do tell them but they never say how they feel
<br />You just want them to hold you but you know they wont
<br />You just want to be with them but you know they dont want to be with you.
