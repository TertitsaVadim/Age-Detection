The biggest fear in a relationship can often be the fear of rejection or the fear of a bad experience. Quite often you'll find people, maybe even yourself, who are so afraid of these things that they are not willing to experience the joy of a true relationship. This is quite understandable, especially if you've had a previous bad experience. The real problem comes when it's time for you to start enjoying something, and you're still held back by your fear. What do you do and how can you overcome this?
<br /><br />A good starting point is remembering this motto, &quot;Nothing in life worth having, or keeping, is going to be effortless or painless.&quot; If you're going to be involved with someone, this can also include a friendship, you need to make a commitment to them that you're willing to give it your all. Although, the relationship could end in heartbreak, it is far better to know you gave and loved with everything, than to know deep down you held back your emotions.
<br /><br />If you find that opening yourself to love and/or relationships is difficult for you (or possibly a friend), try one of the following ideas and tips.
<br /><br />Don't Think, Just Do
<br />Obviously, this doesn't mean to lose your better judgment... just the opposite. If you're the type of person that over-evaluates everything... stop. Allow yourself to &quot;go with the flow&quot; instead of worrying about what the outcome will be. Remember, there is valuable information in the saying, &quot;Whatever will be, will be.&quot;
<br /><br />Allow Experiences
<br />How many times have you declined to do something, or not pursued something (or someone) because you were worried about an unpleasant experience? Take the risk next time and allow yourself to experience things. You may find the risk was worth it!
<br /><br />Be Open And Honest
<br />Many times you'll find someone who is worried about something, but has never even spoken with the other partner about it. It's very difficult to maintain a relationship if you don't let your partner know how you feel about something or any concerns you may have. Sharing your thoughts will not only help alleviate your fears, but it will also begin the start of a solid relationship.
<br /><br />Do Unto Others
<br />If you're insecure about something, there's a high chance that it could quite possibly be caused by something similar you've done in the past. Keep pesky, guilty feelings at bay by following the golden rule, &quot;Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.&quot; Not only will you feel better about yourself, you'll also find it easier to be open when you've got nothing to hide!
<br /><br />Remember, there is a certain amount of risk in everything you do. Allowing yourself the freedom to experience love, with all its uncertainties, is more valuable than any investment or money in the world.

<br />How you live your life determines what kind of love you experience...
<br /><br />If you don't try how will you know?
<br /><br />Remember how precious your loved one is. You never know if today is the last day you'll see them. Don't do something you'd regret if you never got a chance to see them again to make amends.
<br /><br />Being romantic means something different to everyone. To me it means being high spirited, completely carefree in love and willing to take the risk of truly loving someone with all your heart. Meaning: don't let embarrassment or shyness get in the way of showing your affection!
<br /><br />Hope is the motto for a romantic. Even if things don't work out perfectly today, who says it won't when the time is right? Don't give up without a worthy fight!
<br /><br />Love the one you're with. Why compromise what could possibly be a great relationship by not focusing on who you're with now. If you're not happy with it, leave. Otherwise, give your partner 100%. You'll find your attention will not go unreturned!
<br /><br />&quot;Within our dreams and aspirations we find our opportunities.&quot; -Sue Atchley Ebaugh
<br /><br />What is the ideal relationship to you? Write it down as specifically as you can. Decide to make your relationship as close to this model as possible. Whenever you feel the relationship falling, pull out that paper and remind yourself what you need to do to get it to your ideal state.
<br /><br />Remember, you are your own best counsel. Practice doing what you know is best for you today. By second guessing yourself, you're making yourself your own worst enemy.
<br /><br />Be the best you can be. If you don't think you're good at something, practice until you are! If this involves the subject of romance, learn as much as you can about being romantic and then DO those things! There is no excuse for not knowing OR doing!
<br /><br />Ponder the words of Torquato Tasso, &quot;Any time not spent in love is wasted.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;People tend to question when you start something and worry about the ending; they forget that its the middle that counts the most.&quot; -Words of Wisdom submitted by Lovingyou.com visitor JJ
<br /><br />Know who you are. Take the time to write down who you are and what you like. Don't write down what you'd like to be or who you think other people want you to be... only who you actually are. I think that in today's world a lot of people forget to just be themselves and be okay with it. So, today be okay with who you are!
<br /><br />Enjoy life! For one day, smile wherever you go. Pick flowers on the roadside. Instead of arguing, kiss and make up. Do something spontaneous. What's the point of working so hard if you don't take at least a few minutes to really enjoy it?
<br /><br />Sometimes... a heart can not afford to be... just friends!
<br /><br />Be there for your love, emotionally and physically (if possible). The comfort and bond you feel with someone you know is just there for you, can not be matched. So, leave a note or take a few moments out of your day to let your sweetheart or other loved one know that you are there for them.
<br /><br />&quot;Love is like evergreens; they go through the roughest times but never fade.&quot; -Words of Wisdom submitted by Lovingyou.com visitor Loriann
<br /><br />Love isn't a one way street. It is something that needs to be maintained. If you find yourself falling out of love it's not because it doesn't exist between you anymore. It is because it isn't being created anymore. Make the time to follow the definition of romance. Make your partner feel loved!
<br /><br />&quot;How long does youth last? So long as we are loved.&quot; -from the The Golden Book of Countess Diana
<br /><br />Sometimes we forget how valuable our significant other is. We get caught up in our day to day lives and our relationships end up suffering. Make some time to let your partner know how much you appreciate them being in your life. Even if it's just a quick note!
<br /><br />&quot;To handle yourself, use your head; to handle others, use your heart.&quot; Remember, before you react to any situation think with your heart first. Really try to understand the motivation behind the other person's behavior. More often than not, there is some other situation you are unaware of that has prompted an attack. Try this tip and watch how upsets in your daily life decrease!
<br /><br />&quot;Love cannot grow without passion.&quot; -Greek Proverb
<br /><br />&quot;It takes two to make a marriage a success and only one a failure.&quot; -Herbert Louis Samuel

When you cross the line and become too critical, it can end up killing your relationship. Realizing that you are overly critical can be a difficult thing as well. I mean, if you spend all that time watching the mistakes of your partner, how can you have time to look at yours? To find out if you are a &quot;Critical Alert&quot; take our short quiz! Afterwards you'll be given tips on how to improve your &quot;critical&quot; rating!
<br /><br />1. Your partner leaves the towel on the floor for the fifth day in a row. You...
<br /><br />Pick up the towel and leave a note asking them to put it away next time.
<br /><br />Put a towel holder (or a basket) nearby, and put the towel on it for your partner.
<br /><br />Confront your partner and ask them why they keep leaving the towel on the floor everyday for you to pick up.
<br /><br />2. While driving, your partner nearly backs into another car. You...
<br /><br />Don't say anything, and chalk it up to your partner being tired or distracted.
<br /><br />Tell your partner to watch where they are going, you don't want to die anytime soon.
<br /><br />Ask if they are tired, and would like you to drive instead.
<br /><br />3. Your partner makes you breakfast, but slightly burns the toast and brings you a drink you cannot stand. You...
<br /><br />Ask them why they can't remember what you like, and refuse to eat the food.
<br /><br />Eat the breakfast, including the toast, and inquire if there is any of your favorite drink left because you'd like a glass of that as well.
<br /><br />Eat everything, but the toast and leave the drink alone.
<br /><br />4. Your partner washed your car for you, and put a small dent in the back of the car. You...
<br /><br />Get really upset and ask them how they could possibly manage to dent the car while washing it? This is your car you know!
<br /><br />Let your partner know you are upset, but tell them it's okay it was just an accident.
<br /><br />Tell them it's okay, and thank them for washing your car. Then ask them if they would mind helping you find a way to get it fixed..

I had a party at my house and I invited some friends over and they had brought their girlfriends with. The girls told my girlfriend that they were in my room, but nothing happened. She's finding out everything. All she wants out of me is to get my life back on track because we have a baby on the way. How do I do this?
<br />--Want To Be Different
<br /><br />Want To Be Different,
<br />It looks like you have some serious soul searching to do. It seems from what you have said and your girlfriend's response, that this is not the first mistake you have made. Making a mistake is something you can overcome. However, continuing bad habits that develop into patterns aren't as easy to fix. The first thing you need to handle is the upset with your girlfriend. Let her know you understand the mistake and that she needs to trust you about what really happened. 
<br /><br />Then you need to make a decision about what kind of father you want to be. She's not ever going to trust you the way you want if you can't follow up your words with action. It isn't enough to want to be different. You have to actually make the changes and be different. Saying sorry doesn't change the person you are. It just shows that you feel remorse about what you've done.
<br /><br />Think about the type of life you want your child to grow up with. What kind of relationship do you want with them? Your actions now will set the stage for how things continue. If you really want to make a change, you won't really need to ask how.
<br /><br />With Love,

<br />The love of my life - who is now, my husband - suffered a lot before I showed him that I loved him too. Two weeks after we started dating, he asked me to be his girlfriend in the most beautiful way possible! He came to my house - it was Halloween and I was going to paint his face - and when he came in, he gave me a beautiful bouquet, asked where my bedroom was, and told me to wait in the living room. I waited, and when he called me, he told me to close my eyes, and once inside, he closed the door. When I opened my eyes, the room was all in darkness, except the word &quot;AMO-TE&quot; (I love you) written on the floor with candles! Then he asked me the old fashioned way if I wanted to be his girlfriend and, of course, I couldn't resist and said YES! It was best that I could ever dream!

<br />In dating, what matters most is the communication; if you are a good listener you will surely enjoy your date with your partner.
<br />--submitted by Henry S.
<br /><br />First Date Romance 
<br />The plan was to pick up this incredibly gorgeous, intelligent woman at her apartment for a lunch date. So, before I left to go pick her up at her apartment, I bought a bouquet of flowers to put in the truck seat (passenger) so when I opened the door for her to get in my truck, she would see them. To my surprise, plans changed and we just met at a restaurant for lunch. Well, I wasn't stuck yet!!! NO WAY!! Right after we ordered drinks in the restaurant, I told her I had to go to the bathroom...and actually that’s all I had planned on doing. While I was in the bathroom, there was a gentleman in there that was an employee for the restaurant. I politely asked him if he worked here and he said yes. I said...something to the effect, &quot;Would you mind doing me a really big favor?&quot; He said sure what is it. I told him about my date and the flowers that were still in my truck and I asked him if one of the servers could bring them to the table for her in about 10 minutes. He said, &quot;Sure, that wouldn't be a problem.&quot; So, I snuck out to the parking lot, gave the gentleman the flowers from my truck, and snuck back in. About 10 minutes later, a server showed up to the table with the flowers in a glass full of water and told my date, &quot;These flowers are for you, from him.&quot; My date just stared at them in awe and I couldn't help but just stare at her the whole time! It was great!! She was absolutely stunned and flattered.

<br /><br />First date helpers 
<br />Here's a little idea to set the mood on a first date. Before going to the girls house buy a single red rose, and keep it on the passenger seat. When you pick her up, leave the rose there and on your way out, open the door for her. (If she is a little clumsy say something like &quot;there's some stuff on the seat&quot;, so she doesn't get a thorn in the rear) This is almost guaranteed to get you a hug if not a kiss, right when the date starts, setting the mood. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/mellow.gif" alt=":)" />

<br /><br />Giving Your Number 
<br />Well this my sound weird but I met the most wonderful guy this way. My bestfriend &amp; I went to the mall &amp; on our way out there were these really cute guys (they called us over to talk to them so I told her to take the car instead of walking so they thought that we dissed them) I happened to see the car they got out of so we went over to the car and I left a little note and my phone #, he ended up calling and said that was the coolest way he ever got a phone number, and I know he will always remember me (we talk for hours it's great).

<br /><br />It Doesn't Take Much To Be A Romantic! 
<br />I met this girl online and one day we finally met after chatting for 3 weeks. Luckily she only lived 2 hours away. Well one thing we did while we were together was go to the beach. A week later I bought a small bottle and filled it with sand from the beach and mailed it to her so she could remember the night forever!

<br /><br />Mail Call 
<br />For Valentine's Day, or any day for that matter, send your sweetie a package in the mail or through UPS. Who doesn't enjoy getting a package in the mail; that alone will make their day! Filling the box will be half the fun for you! You can fill it with a variety of different things such as: a love letter, C.D. compiled of your songs, a homemade picture frame, collage of pictures, a book you wrote and illustrated ... etc. Be creative, the ideas are endless! Or, you can fill the box with items for the day ahead. For example: a gift certificate for a restaurant, a new shirt to wear on the date, movie tickets, perfume, candles, lingerie/boxers, wine, glasses, etc.

<br /><br />Make His Head Spin 
<br />Some five years ago, on about our fourth date, my wife, instead of just giving me a sweet kiss and nicely stepping out of the car when I drove her home, grabbed me by the tie I was wearing after work, pulled me hard and kissed me hard for three seconds. Then she let go, dashed out of the car and into her house. It's been some years since that happened and my head is still spinning!!

<br /><br />Movie Magic 
<br />While watching a movie, sometimes a kissing scene comes up. When the kissing scene comes, ask him anything about the movie but don't let him finish his answer, cut him off with a kiss. Any kiss will do! My boyfriend actually loved it!

<br />is deep and natural.
<br />The most effective way
<br />to be loved is to love others. 
<br />If you give warmth,
<br />you'll attract warmth.
<br /><br />Whether with family relationships,
<br />business partners or friends,
<br />the human need to be loved
<br />is deep and natural. 
<br />We need it like oxygen.
<br /><br />Of course, that love has to be earned.
<br />King Solomon said:
<br />&quot;As water reflects a face,
<br />so does a person's heart.&quot; 
<br />In other words, if you project coldness,
<br />you will attract coldness;
<br />if you give out warmth, 
<br />you will attract warmth.
<br /><br />Some people say
<br />&quot;I can only give to someone I love.&quot;
<br />This is incorrect. The Hebrew word for &quot;give,&quot;
<br />hav, is the same root as ahava,
<br />meaning &quot;love.&quot;
<br />The idea is that giving is...
<br />what leads to love. 
<br />When I give to you,
<br />I have invested a part of myself.
<br />You then become more precious
<br />to me and I love you.
<br /><br />To be loved by others,
<br />you must become virtuous in their eyes.
<br />Do for them what you'd want 
<br />them to do for you. 
<br />This will identify you
<br />as a source of pleasure -- 
<br />and everyone loves those
<br />who bring them pleasure!
<br /><br />When people love you, 
<br />they want to help you become
<br />wise and wealthy. 
<br />They'll invite you to social functions, 
<br />and patronize your business.
<br />They'll give you good advice
<br />-- and eagerly accept yours. 
<br />You will succeed in all areas of life.

<br />Its never easy to describe a woman,
<br />We are as deep as a sea,
<br />We are as vast as blue sky,
<br />When pushed back,we revolted back,
<br />We sound like the roaring of a cloud,
<br />When loved,,we are astonishing beautiful,
<br />Like the petals of a flower,we open up our mind and heart,
<br />Compassion in our forte,
<br />In our womb is the future f a nation,
<br />We are indeed the ruling queen of human hearts.

<br />In a dark room,
<br />The pure flame gets trapped
<br />Seeking its way upward
<br />I choose the life beyond,
<br />Where there will be no filthy water,
<br />Where there will be no close boundaries
<br />In a divine and pure life,
<br />Where i can pluck the lotus moving aside
<br />Shrubs and other water plants,
<br />Where i can open the window
<br />And let the flame go,
<br />In ever open air,
<br />Where my mind will not be boarded by shackles,
<br />But by garland of flowers
<br />And a violin of purity playing
<br />The music seems sweeter there.
