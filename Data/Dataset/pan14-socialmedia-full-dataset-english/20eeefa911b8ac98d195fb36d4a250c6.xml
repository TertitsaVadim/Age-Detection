<br /><br />why the sun lightens our hair, but darkens our skin?
<br /><br />why you don’t ever see the headline “Psychic Wins Lottery”?
<br /><br />why “abbreviated” is such a long word?
<br /><br />why doctors call what they do “practice”?
<br /><br />why you have to click on “Start” to stop Windows 98?
<br /><br />why lemon juice is made with artificial flavor, while dishwashing
<br />liquid is made with real lemons?
<br /><br />why the man who invests all your money is called a broker?
<br /><br />why there isn’t mouse-flavored cat food?
<br /><br />who tastes dog food when it has a “new &amp; improved” flavor?
<br /><br />why they sterilize the needle for lethal injections?
<br /><br />why they don’t make the whole plane out of the material used for the indestructible black box?
<br /><br />why sheep don’t shrink when it rains?
<br /><br />why they are called apartments when they are all stuck together?
<br /><br />if con is the opposite of pro, is Congress the opposite of progress?
<br /><br />why they call the airport “the terminal” if flying is so safe?
<br /><br />In case you need further proof that the human race is doomed because of stupidity, here are some actual label instructions on consumer goods.
<br /><br />On a Sears hairdryer: Do not use while sleeping. (darn, and that’s the only time I have to work on my hair).
<br /><br />On a bag of Fritos: You could be a winner! No purchase necessary.
<br />Details inside. (the shoplifter special)
<br /><br />On a bar of Dial soap: “Directions: Use like regular soap.” (and that would be how???…)
<br /><br />On some Swanson frozen dinners: “Serving suggestion: Defrost.” (but, it’s “just” a suggestion).
<br /><br />On Tesco’s Tiramisu dessert (printed on bottom): “Do not turn upside down.” (well…duh, a bit late, huh)!
<br /><br />On Marks &amp; Spencer Bread Pudding: “Product will be hot after heating.” (…and you thought????..)
<br /><br />On packaging for a Rowenta iron: “Do not iron clothes on body.” (but wouldn’t this save me more time)
<br /><br />On Boot’s Children Cough Medicine:”Do not drive a car or operate machinery after taking this medication.” (We could do a lot to reduce the rate of construction accidents if we could just get those 5-year-olds with head-colds off those forklifts.)
<br /><br />On Nytol Sleep Aid: “Warning: May cause drowsiness.” (and…I’m taking this because???…..)
<br /><br />On a Japanese food processor: “Not to be used for the other use.” (now, somebody out there, help me on this. I’m a bit curious.)
<br /><br />On Sunsbury’s peanuts: “Warning: contains nuts.” (talk about a news flash!)
<br /><br />On an American Airlines packet of nuts: “Instructions: Open packet, eat nuts.” (Step 3: maybe, uh…fly Delta)
<br /><br />I don’t blame the company. I blame the parents for this one: On a child’s superman costume: “Wearing of this garment does not enable you to fly.”
<br /><br />On a Swedish chainsaw: “Do not attempt to stop chain with your hands or genitals.” (..was there a lot of this happening somewhere
<br /><br />Now that you’ve smiled at least once, it’s your turn to spread the stupidity and send this to someone you want to bring a smile to (maybe even a chuckle)…in other words send it to everyone. We all need to smile every once in a while.
