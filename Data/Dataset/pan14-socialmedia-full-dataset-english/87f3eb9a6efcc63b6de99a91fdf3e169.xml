We are hearing more and more about the benefits of exercising, and especially the effects of a workout on managing stress and maintaining good mental health. <br />One of the most common diseases of modern times is depression.  The unstable economy and job insecurity have increased the stress level of many people, which might be the reason for the alarming trend. According to a new government study in the U.S., almost one in 25 adolescents aged 12 to 17 are taking antidepressants. For adults, the number is even higher – one in 10. <br />The Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported on the findings after surveying around 12,000 adolescents and adults during the three-year period between 2005 and 2008. The study also found that more than 60 per cent of Americans taking antidepressants have been doing so for two years or longer, and 14 per cent have been on such medication for over 10 years. These results don’t come as a surprise considering the fact that studies in the past have shown that even after a continuous course of medication, depression recovery rates are usually below 50 per cent.<br />With depression on the rise and medication not proving the most effective solution in the long run, some doctors suggest that the answer to alleviating depression symptoms might just be your <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wYXlhc3VneW0uY29t" target="_blank">gym membership</a>. <br />Dr. Madhukar Trivedi, a professor at the University of Texas, surveyed some of his severely depressed patients and noticed that many of them felt better after going for a walk. Therefore, Dr. Trivedi and his colleagues decided to add a fitness regimen to the medication prescription of these people. The study included 126 people with depression, all of them fitness novices. They had failed to achieve remission even after being on medication for at least two months. <br /><br />The patients were divided into two groups – one was asked to practice gentle aerobic exercises while the second group was asked to do more energetic workouts – brisk walking or faster-paced cycling. After two months of exercising and taking their medication, over 29 per cent of all participants had achieved remission. Those, who performed more energetic exercises, saw better improvements in their mental health. <br /><br />Dr. Trivedi’s study is yet another evidence of the benefits of fitness on patients’ mood and overall mental health. And while not many people can afford a gym membership, there certainly are alternatives, such as the new pay-as-you-go online service. Simply go to payasUgym.com, pick a gym convenient for you and purchase a one-time pass. Now you can effectively beat those autumn blues without the need to get locked into a costly gym membership contract.

Yet, the natural shyness that overcomes even the best of us at the thought of sweating in front of strangers should not discourage you from getting the healthy exercise you need while enjoying all the benefits of a gym membership.<br />When you start thinking about going to the gym, you most probably picture a room full of fitness fanatics with perfect bodies dressed in the latest gym fashion, whatever that might be. In reality, this is not exactly the case. Well, there are few of those too, but the majority of gym goers are usually neither as fit nor as experienced as your imagination may have pictured them. People usually go to the gym or start a gym membership to either lose weight or get fit, which means that their physical shape is far from perfect.  In any case, most of the people going to the gym tend to concentrate on their own physical performance and therefore will hardly notice you unless you jump the queue for the treadmill or something like that.<br />Which brings us to the other quite common reason for gym shyness – operating the equipment. Treadmills, elliptical trainers, rowing machines, multi-gyms, leverage systems… the list is endless and even the names sound complicated enough to make you waste your gym membership by doing sit-ups quietly in the corner.  Do not worry, despite the intimidating names it usually does not mean that you have to be a rocket scientist in order to operate the gym equipment. However, if you are not sure that you will figure it out by yourself, you can simply ask any of the trainers hanging around, they will be happy to assist you, or at least they should be as that is what they receive their paycheck for. <br />A good way to deal with your shyness at the gym is to go there with a friend who will help you mitigate the effect of the madding fitness crowd. If, however, a friend is not available, another solution would be to listen to some music while working out – a selection of your favourite songs is bound to have a soothing effect on your nervous system and will most probably discourage any annoying people who have decided to help you overcome your shyness by invading your personal space.<br />Feeling shy is no reason not to start a <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wYXlhc3VneW0uY29t" target="_blank">gym membership</a> or to stay away from the gym altogether. After all, the gym is by definition a place that people visit in order to improve themselves and therefore it is where it is easiest to see that nobody is perfect.

A workout can be stress relieving, but, sometimes it can be annoying. The truth is, there are plenty of distractions at the gym that can disturb your peace of mind and interfere with your workout – blaring music, breaking news on the big flat-screen TV, people chatting, dumbbells clanking, pushing-themselves-way-too-hard men grunting. Not to mention the inevitable distraction of people-watching and comparing your body and skills to others’. <br /><br />To help you workout with peace of mind, Fitness at Spa 51, one of the gyms central London has, offers fully equipped private Pods. It’s like exercising at your personal gym, away from unnecessary distractions. Now you can purchase a one-time pass for Spa 51 at payasUgym.com and give it a try.<br /><br />Concentration at the gym is vital for an optimal workout. But, let’s face it – not all gyms central London hosts can offer you the luxury of your own Pod. Therefore, if you are working out at a regular facility, you will have to employ some serious mental discipline. <br /><br />By focusing on what you are doing as opposed to watching TV, for example, you can enhance your workout. You will not only quiet your mind in a form of an active meditation, but your will also notice results in your waistline. On the contrary, multitasking while working out at one of the gyms central London has can tamper with your weight loss goals.<br /><br />A recent study by scientists at Emory University titled “Being of Two Minds: Switching Mindsets Exhausts Self-Regulatory Resources”explains that shifting your focus between assignments (and if you are at the gym – distractions) weakens your brainpower, which, in turn, lessens your self-control. The study findings published in the Journal of Organisational Behaviour and Human Decision Processes further claim that, when you stick to one task at a time, you can control yourself and therefore perform the task a lot better. <br /><br />In the case of working out, it is crucial that you are in charge of your movements.  When you concentrate, you actually remember to engage all muscle groups and you achieve better fitness results a lot faster. <br /><br />So what are some ways that can help you focus? Music is one way to keep your mind in check. Create a playlist, put your earphones and crank up the volume. This will keep unnecessary noise out while helping your get motivated. <br /><br />Focusing on your breathing is another way of keeping your concentration on the exercises. You will also supply your body with more oxygen, and you will gain maximum strength to perform each movement more effectively.  <br /><br />So next time you are at one of the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wYXlhc3VneW0uY29t" target="_blank">gyms central London</a> has to offer, try these techniques. They will help you keep your mind exactly where it needs to be  -- in line with your body.

Of course, there are tons of rules that you will learn if you become a regular at the gym, but it still advisable to get acquainted with some of the basic ones beforehand.<br /><br />Let us start with the most important one – maintaining personal hygiene. This one includes not only yourself, but also extends to your locker, the shower cabin and the gym equipment that you will inevitably sweat on. As for the last one, take Douglas Adams’ advice and always carry a towel that you can wipe the equipment with after you have finished your workout.<br /><br />Another thing that seems to be of utmost importance to the regulars at the gyms central London is full of is their peace and quiet. It could be because of the stress and traffic noise in London, but fitness enthusiasts tend to get really annoyed by cell phone ringing, conversations in a loud tone, and sometimes, even by personal music players, if the volume is too high. So, before jumping on the treadmill in close proximity to some other fellow gym member, perhaps you should tone down Steppenwolf’s “Born To Be Wild”, or whichever song you like listening to while working out.<br /><br />As for gym equipment itself, the main rule is to share it. If for instance, you are doing multiple sets on a machine, you can let others use it during your periods of rest. Well, in this case you always face the risk that someone not as polite and considerate as yourself will start using it and not letting you back in for subsequent sets, but, hopefully, the thought of moral superiority will mitigate the irritation of not being able to go back to your exercise. <br /><br />And the last survival rule, in the case that you are into weight-lifting, putting back the weights where you found them after you have finished is a must. Think for a moment how much you annoy your spouse when dropping your clothes wherever you please at home and keep in mind that it is nothing compared to the rage that will overcome the fitness enthusiasts who spend all their free time at the  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wYXlhc3VneW0uY29tL2d5bXMtaW4tbG9uZG9uL2NlbnRyYWwtbG9uZG9u" target="_blank">gyms central London</a> is packed with. <br /><br />Even though you generally might not care about what others think, there are rules that you should stick to when hitting the gyms. Central London is a place where life is often too intense and when people go at the gym, the rush of adrenaline from the exercise might cause them to overreact when someone does not follow gym etiquette. Therefore, try to be as considerate and polite as you can and pick up the rest of the unwritten rules as you go.

Therefore, we don’t see that many of them hitting the gyms in London.  If you are a parent, however, it is that much more important that you maintain a healthy lifestyle. Why? Because you are setting an example for your children. Therefore, parents should make it a family effort to keep active and healthy. <br /><br />In the summer, most families engage in outdoor activities, which makes it easier to keep kids moving. In the autumn and winder months, however, when the weather is cold and your outdoor options are limited, both parents and kids become inactive. You can check out different gyms in London and see if they offer classes or activities, which are suitable for you and your children. Then encourage your kids to participate by making exercising a family-bonding activity at the gym. <br /><br />With childhood obesity hitting alarming rates worldwide, scientists believe that the environment has a lot to do with children’s physical activity levels. Dr. John J. Reilly, a professor of pediatric energy metabolism at the University of Strathclyde in Scotland, claims that kids are only as fit and healthy as their living environment and to a lesser extent their biological predisposition. <br /><br />A study conducted last year at the University College London’s Department of Epidemiology and Public Health examined British twins, ages 9 to 12 years old. The study findings suggest that children’s fidgetiness and how much they enjoyed different activities was mostly hereditary. Their actual level of movement, however, was almost exclusively influenced by their living environment and the actions and attitudes of parents and teachers. “The shared environment was the dominant influence on children's day-to-day activity levels… and supports the value of interventions focused on home or school environments,” researchers wrote in their study. <br />Therefore, tackling obesity among children should start with healthy actions undertaken by the parents. If your kid sees you frequenting the gyms in London, he or she would be more likely to mimic that behaviour and adopt a much more active lifestyle. Implementing healthy eating habits, of course, are also important. As much as schools have the responsibility to provide wholesome meals to children, even more important is for parents to stress the benefits of eating more fruits and vegetables by choosing these food groups themselves. <br />So next time going to one of the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wYXlhc3VneW0uY29tL2d5bXMtaW4tbG9uZG9u" target="_blank">gyms in London</a> on a chilly October morning seems like an unappealing choice before the option of staying in bed for one extra hour, think about how your children are emulating your choices. That ought to be a good enough reason to get you out of bed and get moving.

And the fact that you might be fit due to a regular workout at the gym does not necessarily help you to become the graceful dancer you have always dreamt of being. If this is the case, why not step down from the treadmill for a while and take some salsa dance lessons instead? A lot of gyms in London nowadays offer a variety of dancing classes where you can easily pick up some moves and impress your acquaintances at the next social event you get invited to.<br />Salsa is among the most popular Latin dances, and as its basic movements are quite easy to master, it is likely to appeal even to those who do not consider themselves natural dancers. The origins of salsa may be traced back to 1930’s Cuba, where the dance combined influences from Spanish and African cultures.  Even though it is generally considered a partner dance, salsa also has recognised solo forms, which means that you can easily practise it in any of the gyms in London without worrying about bringing along a partner of the opposite sex.<br />There are a few basic steps of salsa and dance instructors usually say that once you learn them, you are half way there. And even though you might not be ready to enter a salsa competition right away, the basics will enable you to successfully follow the rhythm. And after learning the right steps with your feet, the benefits of salsa dancing will spread up to your hips to form what is known as the “Cuban hip motion”, quite a graceful movement which can later be applied to any music you have to dance to.<br />Another benefit from taking salsa lessons at the gym is listening to the music. Even if you are not a particular fan of Latino melodies, the catchy salsa rhythm and colourful sounds are bound to add some exotic flavour to your workout experience in any of the gyms in London you might be visiting. <br />After you learn some salsa moves in the comfortable environment of your gym, you will feel more confident when you have to demonstrate your dancing skills in public; besides, you might enjoy the change from the boring treadmill you are so fed up with. And, who knows, after learning the basics, you might decide to take your salsa practice out of the local gyms. In London there are also quite a few clubs for Latino dances where you can upgrade your salsa skills to the next level.  <br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wYXlhc3VneW0uY29tL2d5bXMtaW4tbG9uZG9u" target="_blank">gyms in london</a>

A seasoned marathon runner, Miller sparked quite the controversy among healthcare professionals, whose opinions clash over whether or not pregnant women should engage in running. <br /><br />So if you are expecting and you still like to hit the treadmill in one of the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wYXlhc3VneW0uY29tL2d5bXMtaW4tTG9uZG9u" target="_blank">gyms London</a> has to offer, or are wondering whether now is the best time to take on running as a way to keep fit until the little feet arrive, then read on. <br /><br />Of course, each woman’s pregnancy is different and no generalized recommendation can be made for all, so we strongly suggest you consult a doctor before heading to the any of the gyms. London has plenty of specialists, who would be glad to explain in detail what fitness routine you can engage in to maximise the health benefits for you and your child. <br /><br />In the case of Miller, she has said that she is an avid marathon runner. She has run a total of eight marathons, and three of them she finished while being with child (one when she was 17 weeks pregnant with her daughter June, and another when she was pregnant with June's older brother Cale<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cool.gif" alt=":)" />. <br /><br />Dr. Jacques Moritz, director of gynecology at New York’s St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital, claims what Miller did was not something every expectant mom should attempt, because it can put her child in danger. In an interview for ABC News, Moritz said: &quot;You have to be able to breathe.&quot; He further warns pregnant women, who want to exercise: &quot;If you're not getting oxygen, the baby is not getting oxygen.&quot; In the first trimester, he says, considering the symptoms such as throwing up and morning sickness, women should stay away from running, unless they are already regular runners. <br /><br />Moritz also cites the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, which advises a pregnant woman to do moderate exercise. According to him, if she is able to carry a conversation while working out, then she is fine. <br /><br />Staying active during a healthy normal pregnancy is important. It will help alleviate some symptoms like mood swings. It could also help you maintain your energy levels.  After all, what a better way of getting some endorphins in than going for a brisk walk or taking a prenatal yoga class at one of your favourite gyms. London has plenty of choices when it comes to staying fit and active, and pregnant women shouldn’t have a problem finding something that works out for them. <br /><br />The most important thing, Moritz says, is listening to your body and not trying to be an Olympian during pregnancy. So next time you head to one of the gyms London has, along with your enthusiasm, bring also your best judgment.

Therefore, it might be interesting to explore whether fitness enthusiasts may further fuel up their exercise performance by paying more attention to the colour of the outfit they wear in any of the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wYXlhc3VneW0uY29tL2d5bXMtaW4tbG9uZG9u" target="_blank">gyms London</a> has to offer, without, however, compromising too much with their personal tastes. <br />The basics of psychology of colours teach us that red symbolises energy and therefore we can safely assume that it will be a good choice for an exercise outfit colour.  It is often associated with movement and excitement and therefore, if you are at the gym with the goal to lose weight, running in a red outfit on the treadmill might get you there quicker. However, you should be aware that red usually attracts the eye, so if you do not feel like being the centre of attention in any of the gyms London is so full of, perhaps it might be a good idea to stay clear of red.<br />Blue, on the other hand, is often cited as the most common favourite colour, having a calming effect on the body. As it is also associated with steadfastness and dependability, it might be a good outfit solution for weight-lifters. Similar rules apply for green as well, which should be worn when one is after slow-paced activities, such as yoga.  <br />As for yellow, it is the colour of optimism since it is associated with sunlight. Therefore wearing a yellow outfit might increase the satisfaction you get out of your regular gym exercises regardless  of whether you actually become as fit as you have intended. In addition, it is a good choice for people who exercise simply to have fun or to look for some social interaction when visiting gyms. London is a vibrant city where any place, including the gym, might become a venue for making new acquaintances and gyms are no exception. One step down in the colour spectrum, orange is also a happy and energetic outfit choice which would not make you stand out in the crowd as much as yellow will.<br />Purple, despite its popularity among adolescent girls, is not a very good exercise colour option. It is generally associated with mental rather than with physical activity and therefore it might make you more thoughtful than necessary when working out.<br />Even though certain colours may boost your physical performance, you should still take your personal preferences into consideration when selecting an outfit for visiting gyms. London is a city often referred to as the fashion capital of Europe and even the world, however, this should not discourage you from wearing whichever colour makes you feel you can achieve the desired goal at the gym.

The challenge is even bigger when these parents have full-time jobs. Then, it becomes ever so important to rush home right after work and spend time with your children as much as you can.<br />It is possible, however, to both spend quality time with your kids and stay fit at the same time. Clissold Leisure Centre, for example, one of the many gyms north London has to offer, has a toddler pool where you and your young children can engage in a variety of activities. You don’t have to be a member of the facility to take advantage of their offer as you can get a one-time pass to Clissold or any of the other kid friendly <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wYXlhc3VneW0uY29tL2d5bXMtaW4tbG9uZG9uL25vcnRoLWxvbmRvbg__" target="_blank">gyms north London</a> has.  Simply go to pasyasUgym.com and purchase the voucher. For less than £8, you and your little ones can have a lot of fun while staying healthy together.  <br />A study conducted last year at the University College London’s Department of Epidemiology and Public Health found that children’s movement levels were strongly influenced by their immediate environment and the activity level their parents and teachers exhibit. Therefore, the role parents play in educating their children to form healthy habits is so important. Granted, it is often hard for young parents to hold a full-time job, perform all other parenting duties and at the same time be creative in designing different family activities, especially in the autumn and winter months when the options are limited to indoor sports. Besides, not all of the gyms north London hosts offer activities where families can enjoy together. <br />Therefore, toddler pools are a great way to engage your children and utilise for your own health benefits. But what can you do while you are accompanying your kid at the pool?<br />Cindy Posey, a blogger and a mom herself shares her experience by suggesting that parents can engage in aerobic as well as muscle-specific exercises. She advises running (backwards, high knee and butt kicks); bunny jumps, duck walk and role-playing different animals to get your heart pumping. For toning and strengthening the leg muscles, Posey finds underwater squats, lunges and vertical and horizontal scissors as quite effective. If you want to get rid of your bat wings, you can try tricep dips on the side of the pool. For biceps, besides lifting your toddler or doing curls using their weight, you can also do incline pushups. For the abs, you can try what she calls “bottom scoot” – moving across the pool by using your core muscles to shift your hips and bottom across. <br />Now get your little ones and head to Clissold Leisure Centre or another one of the kid-friendly gyms north London has and see that mummy weight come off in no time. After all, new parents shouldn’t see their children as an obstacle to staying fit, but as workout buddies that can add extra fun to any fitness routine.

It might be because you are new to the gym, or because this time you have specific needs (i.e. being pregnant) or a goal (losing weight, muscle growth, etc.), but sometimes you really can use a bit of professional advice. This is where your fitness instructor comes in and since there is a good chance that when going to some of the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wYXlhc3VneW0uY29tL2d5bXMtaW4tbG9uZG9uL25vcnRoLWxvbmRvbg__" target="_blank">gyms north London</a> is so full of these days, you most probably will have to pay extra in order to attend a specific class or to get a personal trainer, it might be good to stick to a few basic rules when selecting the person you are going to trust your fitness well-being with.<br />If you are attending a class (aerobics, yoga, etc.) it should be relatively easy for you to tell the good fitness instructor from the bad one. Among the things that you should pay attention to is the pace of the practice and namely, whether the instructor takes into account the needs both of the beginners and the more advanced enthusiasts. At first, you might be comfortable if your trainer takes it slow, but as you progress, you will need a challenge. Another important quality that defines a good class fitness instructor is whether he/she creates a friendly atmosphere; the last thing you need is competing with the others. And if you do not feel well at your class, you should simply switch it or try another one of the gyms north London can offer until you find the perfect class and the perfect instructor.<br />Selecting a good personal trainer at the local gym is a little bit trickier. There are a lot more things that you should look for, including education, CPR certification, and most of all, the right attitude and attention to your personal needs. Of course, there is no way to know all that in advance, however, when trying to spot a decent personal trainer in any of the gyms north London is packed with, it could be a good idea to go there beforehand and check out how the trainers interact with their respective clients. You will be able to tell a lot about their attitude and at least make a pretty good assumption whether the approach of a particular trainer will suit your personality.<br />If you are a regular gym-goer, fitness instructors are bound to become part of your exercise life sooner or later and it is important to come up with some sort of a strategy for selecting one when hitting the gyms. North London is an area with a lot of places for exercise and, hopefully, in one of them you will find the one instructor who will make an effective and pleasant experience out of your fitness routine.

If you have, but, are not that much of an outdoor person, or a trip to the Himalayas is not something you fancy or can afford at the moment, perhaps you might enjoy some indoor rock climbing at your local gym without even having to leave London. The popularity of indoor climbing has been constantly growing and nowadays some of the gyms north-west London area is full of have a climbing wall in their selection of gym equipment.<br /><br />One of the main reasons why rock climbing has gained so much popularity is that, unlike real outdoor climbing, it does not depend on weather conditions, which naturally makes it extremely appropriate for places with a rainy climate such as the British Isles. Indoor rock climbing provides the physical benefits of the real outdoor experience in a controlled environment, where the climber feels secure and can concentrate fully on his/her performance. However, if you have decided to try the climbing wall at your local gym, you are still going to need some equipment, such as ropes, harnesses, carabiners, etc. Yet, you can probably get all of those and more quite easily from a store close to some of the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wYXlhc3VneW0uY29tL2d5bXMtaW4tbG9uZG9uL25vcnRoLXdlc3QtbG9uZG9u" target="_blank">gyms north-west London</a> offers.<br /><br />Indoor climbing provides a really good gym workout, as climbers can work on different parts of their body, such as the lower back, forearms, shoulders and legs. Moreover, climbing seems like way more fun than the standard aerobic routine you are so used to getting at any of the gyms north-west London is so packed with these days and in addition, climbing will help you improve your flexibility and balance. <br /><br />However, a lot of gym goers tend to turn to rock climbing for reasons other than the purely physical benefits. As climbing presents the goal of reaching the top, it provides a certain sense of accomplishment and thus helps relieve the stress of horizontal London outdoor life. Moreover, climbing is not simply a workout routine or a recreational activity; as it also involves problem solving, planning the best route, etc, and therefore has a positive effect not only on the body, but on the mind as well.  <br /><br />It is not uncommon even among the most devoted fitness enthusiasts to get fed up with the traditional workout routines when hitting their favourite gyms. North-west London, however, is a place where gyms tend to expand their equipment in more alternative directions and if your local gym has a climbing wall it might be a good idea to give it a try. This way you can enjoy the fun of rock climbing without having to become the hero in a sequel to Danny Boyle’s “127 hours”.
