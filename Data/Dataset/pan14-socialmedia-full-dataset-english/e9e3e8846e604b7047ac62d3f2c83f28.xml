And yet wants to wear some classy jewelry. Then let me help you make one. <br /><br />Usually  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thoughts.com%2Fcalvinmelend1127%2Fwholesale-silver-jewelry"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.thoughts.com/calvinmelend1127/wholesale-silver-jewelry</a>  contains one of the most popular metals for wire artists and wire jewelry makers to work with. There are many reasons for this, it provides the maker with a combination of a cheap material that is acquiescent and has pleasing visual effects. Silver is an excellent background to beads and gemstones, helping to show off the rich color of the materials used. Many beautiful items of jewelry are made using little more than silver wire and beads.<br /><br />Enough of all the chit-chat and definitions. Here are the instructions in making one. First is that you must buy or make a wire wrapping jig. Pre-made jigs have removable pegs with a peg board, making you to produce a variety of wire shapes and sizes. Hand-made jigs can be constructed easily by hammering small nails into a portion of wood in whatever shape you desire. Second step is that you look for wire between 20 gauge and 24 gauge in thickness for the best flexibility. (If the gauge is high the thinner the wire.)  Third step is cut an extent of silver wire with your metal scissors; you can trim the excess if your wire is too long. Use the wire wrapping jig to bend your wire into attractive shapes. Twist and loop the silver wire around the jig pegs to create  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fquizilla.teennick.com%2Fstories%2F21945811%2Fwholesale-silver-jewelry"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://quizilla.teennick.com/stories/21945811/wholesale-silver-jewelry</a>  flower shapes and scrolls. Repeat this process to create several matching shapes for your piece, do whatever shape that pleases you. <br /><br />For the fourth step, link your made wire design components all together now. Grip a jump ring with the chain-nosed pliers somewhat to one side of the opening slowly, and then twist the ring wide or slightly open. Thread the ends of two of your wire components all the way through the jump ring, and twist it shut with the chain-nosed pliers. Do the process again until all of your wire shapes/designs are linked together in a flexible chain. The last step is attaching a clasp to one end of your linked chain of wire components with a jump ring. Then twist open the jump ring cautiously to avoid any deviations or stress onto the metal. Thread the open ring through the wire component and the small loop on the end of the clasp, and close it with your pliers. Attach a jump ring to the opposite end of the piece for fastening the clasp. And that’s it. Just add some more designs if you want. You can even add some beads or anything that what comes in to your mind, as long as it’s fashionable and comfy to wear and to show off. <br /><br />Oh and by the way, while making this silver wire jewelry always wear safety glasses whenever you cut wire to protect your eyes. So that’s it, instead of buying some expensive jewelry, why not make one and have fun.

The fact that in ancient times, silver is associated with the crescent moon, it has already cemented its reputation as one of the most beautiful and sought after “must-haves” in our possession. Though silver before now had eye-catching features, it is still very comfortable to have one due to that it has been present since the earliest eras and provided an indistinguishable backdrop in nearly all festivities and other social events.<br /><br />Usually, silver is partnered with other metals and are formed to alloys due to that pure silver which is 99.9% is too malleable to produce purposeful objects. Sterling silver, classified as the standard silver, is an alloy composed of 92.5% silver and with 7.5% copper. Some  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.avilasterling.com%2Fwholesale-silver-jewelry.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.avilasterling.com/wholesale-silver-jewelry.html</a>  are coated with 99.9% pure silver as to prevent corrosion since copper reacts to the oxygen in the air. It has been agreed upon that sterling silver originated in Europe and has been around as early as the 12th century in a location we call now modern Northern Germany and was mainly used for trade. Silver has been an expensive metal before the 15th century, but because of the huge find of silver deposits in the New World, it has depreciated drastically since then. <br /><br />Because of the lowered prices of silver, increased interest in its use has been developed especially in jewelry. An example is that due to the economic crisis and tough financial times, being engaged is very expensive, mainly that diamond rings are high-priced. However, because of the enhanced quality of making  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.avilasterling.com%2Fecommerce%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.avilasterling.com/ecommerce/</a> , couples can once more manage to pay for a good engagement or wedding ring.<br /><br />There are tips to follow if you want to own a genuine piece of silver jewelry. Nowadays, hallmarking is done for buyers to identify the; 1) the purity of the item, 2) the company or the silversmith who made the item, 3) and date and location of the manufacturer or trader. If the item is sterling silver, make sure that you identify its mark because every item is required to have one. If you don’t find any stamp, don’t judge immediately because it might be an antique and was made way before hallmarking was even established. Make sure that it is genuine by letting it be checked by an authentic antique silver dealer.<br /><br />As sterling silver ages, it naturally darkens and forms what they call “patina” which, in fact, very desirable for the owner due to that it shows the great workmanship in jewelry. It usually forms in the engraved parts of the jewelry which are darker while the exterior parts are glossy. Majority of the collectors favored patina that developed through wear and tear than that of latest glimmering silver ones.<br /><br />Cleaning vintage sterling silver jewelry is important because it maintains the gleaming shine of the item which displays its lustrous worth. Do not use strong solutions as it will diminish the patina that developed through wear, especially in the engraved portion. Only mildly rub the surface of the jewelry so that it maintains its polished sterling look.

It is the heating process that creates the tiny spaces by the movement of particles apart. The connection of metals is due to the flowing of silver alloy into these tiny spaces. Silver solder is used for silver and copper, though there are a wide variety of solders available, these tend to make great pieces of  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwallinside.com%2Fpost-241232.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://wallinside.com/post-241232.html</a> . In the process, there is actually a consideration depending on what silver is being soldered, but for the series of steps, these same methods are followed:<br /><br />First is the setting up of a safe soldering area. You will need to prepare an overhead lamp, a fire brick or heat resistance pad, and a large ceramic tile. You should make sure that the area is also well-ventilated. You then place the fire brick on top of the tile. Some more items like a jar of water, a pickle pot, solder and flux, a small paint brush, and a pair of copper tongs should be available nearby. After that, you need to make sure what you are soldering is well-fitted by careful filling.<br /><br />Next is to check for any grease and oil present in whatever is being soldered. Every piece that requires soldering is to be placed in a pickle for a few minutes. In preparation for the soldering proper, you arrange the pieces on the fire brick after taking them out of the pickle. Use a pair of pliers or tweezers in handling the silver metals. After that, you are now ready for the cutting and fine tuning of  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.blogabond.com%2FCommentView.aspx%3FCommentID%3D498260"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.blogabond.com/CommentView.aspx?CommentID=498260</a> . The solder also needs cleaning just like the other metals, though not through pickle, but by just minimal handling. Tiny pieces of solder are cut with very sharp scissors, and then set aside.<br />	For fluxing, it can be your personal choice, but there are actually two ways available. You can choose between the following:<br /><br />A.	One way is with the use of a type called Battern’s.  Its color is light yellow. Using a thin paint brush, the flux is applied to the area to be soldered, then the solder on the metal so they can be heated together.<br />B.	The second is with the use of a more paste-like borax-based flux. Still, a thin brush is applied. But the metal is heated first until it looks glassy, before the solder is applied. Then place it again in the metal.<br /><br />The solder should be positioned well that it bests join the metal between the areas. If placed appropriately, a solder can go a long way. And this needs practice. You can now start the torch if the solder is already in place. The temperature for soldering should be achieved at the same time so all the metals should be heated. Flame to draw the solder through the joint being connected until the solder run, and then quickly remove the flame. Pick up the metal with tweezers or pliers, then drop into a jar of water. You can repeat the steps if the pieces need more soldering. Just put in mind to use another kind of solder for the entire process.

After that, you need to make sure what you are soldering is well-fitted by careful filling.<br /><br />Next is to check for any grease and oil present in whatever is being soldered. Every piece that requires soldering is to be placed in a pickle for a few minutes. In preparation for the soldering proper, you arrange the pieces on the fire brick after taking them out of the pickle. Use a pair of pliers or tweezers in handling the silver metals. After that, you are now ready for the cutting and fine tuning of  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.quechup.com%2Fblog%2Fentry%2Fview%2Fid%2F218324"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.quechup.com/blog/entry/view/id/218324</a> . The solder also needs cleaning just like the other metals, though not through pickle, but by just minimal handling. Tiny pieces of solder are cut with very sharp scissors, and then set aside.<br />	For fluxing, it can be your personal choice, but there are actually two ways available. You can choose between the following:<br /><br />A.	One way is with the use of a type called Battern’s.  Its color is light yellow. Using a thin paint brush, the flux is applied to the area to be soldered, then the solder on the metal so they can be heated together.<br />B.	The second is with the use of a more paste-like borax-based flux. Still, a thin brush is applied. But the metal is heated first until it looks glassy, before the solder is applied. Then place it again in the metal.<br /><br />The solder should be positioned well that it bests join the metal between the areas. If placed appropriately, a solder can go a long way. And this needs practice. You can now start the torch if the solder is already in place. The temperature for soldering should be achieved at the same time so all the metals should be heated. Flame to draw the solder through the joint being connected until the solder run, and then quickly remove the flame.

And yet wants to wear some classy jewelry. Then let me help you make one. <br /><br />Usually  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fmyanimelist.net%2Fblog.php%3Feid%3D150795"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://myanimelist.net/blog.php?eid=150795</a>  contains one of the most popular metals for wire artists and wire jewelry makers to work with. There are many reasons for this, it provides the maker with a combination of a cheap material that is acquiescent and has pleasing visual effects. Silver is an excellent background to beads and gemstones, helping to show off the rich color of the materials used. Many beautiful items of jewelry are made using little more than silver wire and beads.<br /><br />Enough of all the chit-chat and definitions. Here are the instructions in making one. First is that you must buy or make a wire wrapping jig. Pre-made jigs have removable pegs with a peg board, making you to produce a variety of wire shapes and sizes. Hand-made jigs can be constructed easily by hammering small nails into a portion of wood in whatever shape you desire. Second step is that you look for wire between 20 gauge and 24 gauge in thickness for the best flexibility. (If the gauge is high the thinner the wire.)  Third step is cut an extent of silver wire with your metal scissors; you can trim the excess if your wire is too long. Use the wire wrapping jig to bend your wire into attractive shapes. Twist and loop the silver wire around the jig pegs to create  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mycatspace.com%2Fme%2Fterrellclark12%2Fblog%2F2011-09-22Sale-Hoo-Wholesale-Silver-Jewelry---How-To-Calculate-A-Reasonable-Cost-For-Each-And-Every-Jewelry-Merchandise"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.mycatspace.com/me/terrellclark12/blog/2011-09-22Sale-Hoo-Wholesale-Silver-Jewelry---How-To-Calculate-A-Reasonable-Cost-For-Each-And-Every-Jewelry-Merchandise</a>  flower shapes and scrolls. Repeat this process to create several matching shapes for your piece, do whatever shape that pleases you. <br /><br />For the fourth step, link your made wire design components all together now. Grip a jump ring with the chain-nosed pliers somewhat to one side of the opening slowly, and then twist the ring wide or slightly open. Thread the ends of two of your wire components all the way through the jump ring, and twist it shut with the chain-nosed pliers. Do the process again until all of your wire shapes/designs are linked together in a flexible chain. The last step is attaching a clasp to one end of your linked chain of wire components with a jump ring. Then twist open the jump ring cautiously to avoid any deviations or stress onto the metal. Thread the open ring through the wire component and the small loop on the end of the clasp, and close it with your pliers. Attach a jump ring to the opposite end of the piece for fastening the clasp. And that’s it. Just add some more designs if you want. You can even add some beads or anything that what comes in to your mind, as long as it’s fashionable and comfy to wear and to show off. <br /><br />Oh and by the way, while making this silver wire jewelry always wear safety glasses whenever you cut wire to protect your eyes. So that’s it, instead of buying some expensive jewelry, why not make one and have fun.
