But with the busy schedules of today, we have no time for styling our hair. But people with curly and unruly hair find it difficult to manage their hair and they cannot even try out different hair styles easily. With the introduction of different straightening methods such as chemical straightening and straightening with a flat iron, we have the option of styling our hair for any occasion. When chemical straightening methods cause huge hazards to the hair and takes lot of time, straightening with flat irons are better option. They help in accomplishing different hairstyles such as straightening, curling, crimping, creating waves etc with a single device without the need for spending hours at the hair salons.
<br /><br />The most preferred hairstyle that can be easily accomplished with the help of a flat iron is hair straightening  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy53ZWRkaW5nZHJlc3Nlc2JyYW5kLmNvbS9tYWdnaWUtc290dGVyby1jaGFybGl6ZS0yMDExLWNvbGxlY3Rpb24tcC0zOTQuaHRtbA__" target="_blank">Maggie Sottero Charlize</a>. Apart from adding elegance and beauty, straight hair gives you more control and enables you to try out different styles to suit any occasion. But choose the best styling rod that comes with the best technological integrations and safety features that does not ruin your hair after styling. For safe and regular styling, you can choose a ceramic iron. Ceramic models come in different plate and barrel sizes for trying out different hair styles. Other than straightening your hair, you can use a flat iron for curling with tight or loose curls.
<br /><br />Another best styling tool for acquiring different styles is by purchasing a combo with a hair iron and a dryer for straightening and drying the hair simultaneously. Before the introduction of flat irons, blow outs were the common method for straightening, but were not preferred largely due to the inefficiency to offer good results and due to the damage it caused to the hair. Thermal reconditioning is a permanent method that requires at least six months time for maximum result. Ion hair re-texturising is also used for straightening hair but is very much time consuming and only practiced by experts.

This would of course be the end of the world, or at least a huge embarrassment. The answer is vintage prom dresses. A vintage prom dress will be just as good as a designer gown with all the expense.
<br /><br />Some people may not even consider exactly what vintage means and may only think that vintage is the 80's. The real truth is that vintage clothing can go as far back as the 1920's with the flapper style and can include the hippie days and of course the 80's  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy53ZWRkaW5nZHJlc3Nlc2JyYW5kLmNvbS9tYWdnaWUtc290dGVyby1mcmVlc2lhLTIwMTEtY29sbGVjdGlvbi1wLTIxOS5odG1s" target="_blank">Maggie Sottero Freesia</a>. The expense can be less expensive or could even be very expensive according to the rarity of the dresses available during that year.

<br /><br />If all else fails, you can visit a seamstress, as long as you know what you want. She will not be able to read your mind. Take a photograph of the dress you desire and she may be able to create something as close to the look as possible. Just make sure this is what you want, as you will be paying a hefty price to have your dress created.

When they seem like they are going to go out of style, they just are picked up by a new subculture. Even with their popularity having faded many times, they are still very popular today among certain groups.
<br /><br />If you are interested in buying a new pair of baggy jeans, you should look online. At no brick and mortar store will you ever find a selection as big as the one online. You will also find them to be much cheaper, this is because they have cut out the middle man.
<br /><br />Baggy pants have been given a few different names throughout the world. They were originally known as baggy pants however  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy53ZWRkaW5nZHJlc3Nlc2JyYW5kLmNvbS9tYWdnaWUtc290dGVyby1oYWRsZXktMjAxMS1jb2xsZWN0aW9uLXAtMjYuaHRtbA__" target="_blank">Maggie Sottero Hadley</a>. This was during their original popularity during the 1990s.
<br /><br />This was primarily focused on the United States however. In the United Kingdoms for example they were called baggies. This name has faded however and today they are commonly just called wide leg jeans.
<br /><br />Arguably, the culture that really popularized the style was the alternative subculture which grew during the 1990s. This was probably due to the popularity of really tight pants during the eighties. Skateboarders, however, were really commonly seen wearing baggy pants in the nineties as well. This was due to overlap between the subcultures.
<br /><br />Today however, you will notice that the alternative and skateboarder communities often wear skinny jeans. It is the hip hop subculture which has currently picked up the baggy jeans flag. Many companies today were created specifically to sell to this demographic. JNCO is arguably the most popular of them.
<br /><br />The wide legs on baggy pants are the defining characteristic. Some people have compared baggy pants to bell bottoms. These were a style of pant that had flared bottoms, but were still tight above the knee. They were mainly popular in the seventies.
<br /><br />The hem on baggy pants is very big. The average length is usually around twenty inches, but is isn't uncommon to find them with a hem of up to twenty three inches. However, there is a trend by some companies to produce extreme wide leg jeans with a hem of over twenty six inches.

Fashion, too has not remained untouched with such scientific advancements. The introduction of inkjet transfers and online designers has paved a way for personalized designs for clothing. Self-designed t-shirts are quite popular these days but there are certain cardinal rules which needs to be followed while designing a t-shirt. The three basic design components namely, Contrast, Size and Balance have to be handled very carefully.
<br /><br />Contrast
<br />Contrast refers to the difference between the brightness and colors. It has to be so set, that the design or the text flourishes out clearly  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy53ZWRkaW5nZHJlc3Nlc2JyYW5kLmNvbS9tYWdnaWUtc290dGVyby1qZDEzODktMjAxMS1jb2xsZWN0aW9uLXAtNDIxLmh0bWw_" target="_blank">Maggie Sottero Jd1389</a>. Colors of same family or with more or less same brightness do not make a good choice for designs. For instance, a bright yellow would not work well on a white background just the way, a dark blue design would blur itself within a black t-shirt. The point to be considered with contrast is that colors should strike against each other in a way that the text or design is easily recognizable.
<br /><br />Size
<br />Size is indeed very important when it comes to apparel designs. The text or graphic has to be big enough to understand or read at a blink of eye. Since nobody has the time or inclination of going through a long text message on t-shirt, one should keep it short and sweet so as to put across the thought quickly and easily. Hence, the font size needs to be big enough to make the message readable from at least six to eight feet away.
<br /><br />Balance
<br />Balance actually refers to the allocation of the overall text and designs on a shirt. The layout has to be very well balanced in order to make the apparel look an attractive piece. Too much of imagery and text can spoil the entire look and feel of a potentially smart garment. Though there are exceptions of asymmetric or off balance designs but in a normal classic course it is expected to be balanced in terms of designs and pictures on a shirt or t-shirt.
<br /><br />A perfect mix of Contrast, Size and Balance can help you come out with a visually pleasing piece of trendy apparel.

<br /><br />With hundreds of businesses investing in shared Christmas parties, they want their staff to look their best and professional. Thus, it's vital that at the office Christmas party, you show the right image - classy but professional. This can be very hard to get without going for a full length ball gown that covers up everything!
<br /><br />Dressing to impress is a particular art. You need a good sense of what looks appropriate, but also flattering. You must wear the dress  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5rYXBwcmFicmlkYWwuY29tL3Byb25vdmlhcy1hY2FjaWEtd2VkZGluZy1kcmVzc2VzLXAtMjA2MS5odG1s" target="_blank">Pronovias Acacia</a>, not let it wear you! Remember too much cleavage and leg can be a big 'no no', especially if your business has invited any clients. Instead, keep it minimal and wear mid-length dresses or skirts, and tops that are not too revealing.
<br /><br />Check what kind of event it is, as you don't want to over or under dress. Under dressing can make you look lazy, whilst over dressing may be somewhat embarrassing. Swanky ball gowns or at the other end of the spectrum - jeans - may not be appropriate for all events.
<br /><br />Subsequently to this, you need to know what looks good on you. Generally most outfit guides tell those with a bit of a stomach to avoid tight material around the midriff, those with chunkier arms to avoid sleeveless outfits and hip-heavy people to avoid unflattering flat straight down outfits. As a general rule avoid horizontal stripes too as these will make you look wider than you truly are.
<br /><br />Height also plays a big part in what looks good on you. For instance, long dresses are often unflattering on petite girls as it detracts some of their height. If petite, opt for a shorter dress or skirt, or pin striped trousers to elongate your legs, plus heels to make you that little bit taller for the night. For taller girls out there, just make sure everything perfectly fits because it may not look right if trousers or skirts are a little shorter than they should be. It's vital that everything fits perfectly - so find a fit that isn't too small or large.
<br /><br />If you find an outfit that not only is appropriate but looks good, you're bound to turn heads at this years Christmas party. You never know - you might even find Mr. Right that night!

<br /><br />True enough, a wedding is the most difficult event to plan and prepare for. And it gets even more challenging if the budget is tight. But don't fret, we have come up with some tips to help you stay on track money-wise.
<br /><br />1. Limit your invites to the most important people in your life. Less guests less expenses.
<br /><br />2. The venue eats up a huge percentage of the budget so be wise and practical when selecting your venue. If possible, have both the ceremony and the reception in one place to minimize your cost.
<br /><br />3. Resist the urge to pick foods that are costly i.e. lobsters, steaks. You can still impress your guests with less expensive food.
<br /><br />4. Keep your invitation simple  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy53ZWRkaW5nZHJlc3Nlc2JyYW5kLmNvbQ__" target="_blank">Bridesmaid Dresses</a>. If you have the time or extra helping hands, you may even want to consider making the invitation yourself. You can get wedding invitation kits from wedding supply stores or even your local craft store.
<br /><br />5. When decorating the venue, keep the use of flowers to a minimum. They are costly. Use candles (they go a long way when it comes to giving life to a venue), tulles and ribbons as substitutes.
<br /><br />6. While it is nice to be entertained by a live band, recorded music will do just fine.
<br /><br />7. Forget about hiring an emcee. Ask a family member or a friend to emcee instead.
<br /><br />8. Ask yourself if you really want your wedding on a film. Will you spend some time after the wedding to watch it? Or will the video end up in your grandmother's chest in the attic?
<br /><br />9. Opt for a less extravagant cake. Get a 2-tiered cake instead of a 4- or 3-tiered cake. Another option is mini cakes arranged in a layered cake rack.
<br /><br />10. Limit the champagne to the toast. Instead of wine, serve less expensive drinks.
<br /><br />11. Forget about hiring a wedding planner. You can still get the job done with the help of family members and friends.
<br /><br />12. Instead of hiring a limousine, look for alternative means of transport i.e. a friend's Bentley, your fathers Mercedes.
<br /><br />13. Always haggle for a lower price with the vendors. Since they expect some negotiations to happen, they would most often give a quote that is higher than what they are willing to accept.

<br /><br />Winter weddings offer many enchanting and magical theme ideas. Taking your theme all the way from the invitations to the reception is a must, but have you thought about including it in your wedding attire? You're dress can reflect the theme by using specific fabrics and patterns, but don't forget your jewelry.
<br /><br />There are a number of jewelry stores across the country as well as websites that will go out of their way to help you find the perfect wedding jewelry to make your wedding attire just perfect. If you have chosen a specific winter wedding theme, let your jeweler know. He or she will be able to help you find jewelry such as snowflake earrings or pendants that can make your outfit complete.
<br /><br />Whether you are buying a complete set or simply adding a few pieces to those you already have, you'll want to have a general idea before hitting the stores  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy50aWZmYW55YnJpZGFscy5vcmcvcGx1cy1zaXplLXdlZGRpbmctZHJlc3Nlcy1lenAtMzUuaHRtbA__" target="_blank">Plus Size Wedding Dresses</a>. Gold, silver, diamonds and pearls are all beautiful options. However, you should choose one and then coordinate all of your jewelry pieces to match. Snowflake pieces made of pearls can be especially beautiful on a winter bride.
<br /><br />If you already have one or more pieces that you'd like to wear, ask your jeweler to help you find matching pieces to make it a complete set (at least as close as possible). Take your pieces into the jewelry store with you so you can better match the additional pieces.
<br /><br />The jewelry you choose can become treasured pieces of jewelry that remind you of your special day. That's perhaps the best thing about the jewelry you choose to wear on your wedding day. While you will be unlikely to wear your wedding dress again, the jewelry worn on your wedding day can be wonderful keepsakes that remind you of your special day every time you wear them. You may even choose to hand down these special mementos to children or grandchildren, as you grow older.
<br /><br />Your winter wedding theme should be incorporated into every aspect of your wedding, from the decorations and music to the favors and wedding party attire. But don't forget the little things that can be easily overlooked, the bride's jewelry. For the perfect jewelry pieces find a trusted jeweler who can help you find exactly what you are looking for.

<br /><br />Approximately 15 percent of couples getting married in 2006 will have a destination wedding. A destination wedding is a wedding ceremony or celebration typically outside of the wedding couples' state of residence.
<br /><br />The most popular destination wedding locations are Las Vegas, Hawaii, U.S. Virgin Islands, Jamaica and the Bahamas.
<br /><br />Many couples travel to areas within the united states that offer beautiful scenery for the purpose of ambiance or to a destination where they may have first met.

<br /><br />One of the biggest advantages of wedding cruises is that they easily give way towards honeymoons. When a couple sits down to plan a wedding at a Church, the planning for the honeymoon is almost always going to be separate from the planning for the wedding and the wedding reception. The reason for this is that the wedding will take place in the Church and it is quite possible that the reception might as well, but the honeymoon is going to be somewhere completely removed from the Church area. This means logically that it does not make much sense to plan them together.
<br /><br />This is not so for wedding cruises. The whole idea behind a wedding cruise is that it is designed not only to be more emotional and romantic  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wcm9td2VkZGluZ2RyZXNzZXNvbmxpbmUuY29tL2FsZnJlZC1hbmdlbG8td2VkZGluZy1kcmVzc2VzLXN0eWxlLTE4NDYtcC0xNDc5Lmh0bWw_" target="_blank">Alfred Angelo 1846</a>, but also to be more boisterous. This means that the wedding reception has already created the festive atmosphere that comes with departing on a honeymoon so the bride and groom are already in the appropriate mood to go out and celebrate their marriage through honeymooning. Additionally, it is also advantageous from a geographical perspective. When you consider something like a tropical island cruise where the ship actually lands at a number of different ports of call along the way, it makes it easier to have the wedding ceremony during the cruise and then easily branch off for the honeymoon when all is said and done.
<br /><br />In order to illustrate the ease, let us take an example. A typical Caribbean cruise on sale now lasts for two weeks and visits three different Caribbean islands during the actual tour (most of the cruise is at sea and the ship itself has a lot of amenities). This ship does have the facilities necessary to have a wedding cruise ceremony on the ship itself or alternatively there is the option of having it at one of the ports of call.
<br /><br />A very common wedding cruise structure that might happen on this ship would be to have the wedding two or three days into the voyage and then disembark for a week at the first port of call. While the cruise ship visits the other ports the couple has their honeymoon and they get back on the cruise ship when it re-visits their port of call on the way back to the starting point. The whole process is fluid and this makes it a lot easier to organize than most other wedding and honeymoon combinations.

<br /><br />People are looking for life-long relationships in the most peculiar places. There's the favourite haunt - the hotel. Here, the optimists imagine they're going to meet a partner who never drinks or swears, apparently having accidentally stumbled into the hotel while seeking directions to the nearest church.
<br /><br />Then there's the personal column in the newspaper where highly attractive, talented and desirable people who have tired of the attention and adulation they get from people who know them, are seeking to bring sunshine into the lives of the people who don't.
<br /><br />And, of course, the latest meeting place is the Internet. It seems that while unable to connect with the people who see them every day  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wcm9td2VkZGluZ2RyZXNzZXNvbmxpbmUuY29tL2FsZnJlZC1hbmdlbG8td2VkZGluZy1kcmVzc2VzLXN0eWxlLTIwODYtcC0xNTAwLmh0bWw_" target="_blank">Alfred Angelo 2086</a>, the internet enthusiasts are convinced they can connect with those they can't.
<br /><br />Mind you, it's a lot easier to impress when your revelation of character is by writing only. All those irritating habits like scratching intimate body parts, loudly honking while blowing your nose, counting out five dollars' worth of coins at the grocery check out, and fighting with the waiter over the doneness of your meal, are all yet to be discovered.
<br /><br />Marriage in this age of the Internet, is a far cry from its original establishment. Once upon a time everyone knew his or her place in the society and accepted it. The parlour maid married the butler and the farmer married his neighbour's daughter. The marriage not only united the two people, but embraced a family and a way of life which was as well-known to them as their own.
<br /><br />There was no going on the &quot;Oprah&quot; or &quot;Dr Dwyer&quot; show crying, &quot;I didn't know he was a drunk! Honest to God! Before we were married not a sip passed his lips. Then on our wedding day he took one drink, then another, then another, and six months later he's still sipping.&quot;
<br /><br />This sort of thing couldn't happen in the past. You could go back to your intended's great, great, great-grandfather. If there had been any proclivity to sipping, be it ever so slight, you'd know about it.
<br /><br />Did this make for a happier marriage?
<br /><br />Well, we all know whether we're happy or not has very little to do with out partner. Even in those days gone by, you could still covet your neighbour's wife or husband. You simply didn't have the excuse that you didn't know what you were getting when you married your own.

For example if a guest receives a ticket with 10 am time written on it, he should give a breakfast set as a gift. It is a fun party idea as some of the gifts may be quite quirky.
<br /><br />Retro Tea Party
<br /><br />Ask all of the guests to come dressed appropriately and have a retro tea party. Prepare some light snacks and have a lot of fun. Try to behave like a refined ladies - this will bring a lot of laugh and defiantly lots of funny pictures.
<br /><br />Room of the House Party
<br /><br />Similar to the 'Round The Clock Party but the guests are asked to bring gifts related to a room of the house. You can make a kitchen party, a bedroom party, a dining room party and so on. It is a great way for the couple to receive all the items they need for their home. It is a nice to have a list of desired gifts as well to avoid duplicate items and undesirable gifts.
<br /><br />Pampering Party
<br /><br />It is a girl's only bridal shower party idea. All of the gusts should bring pampering gifts for the future bride and even try some on her. A great way to reduce the wedding stress and to have some fun with some of your best girl friends, you can try different cosmetics together, different hair styles or make up. Some professionals can be asked to come to give the future bride heavenly massage or facials.
