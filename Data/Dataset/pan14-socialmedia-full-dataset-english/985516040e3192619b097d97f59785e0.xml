<br />Into your arms, you're wrapping me up so tight
<br /><br />You had me crawlin so bad
<br />Had me heels over head
<br />You got me easy, you got me easy
<br />Tangled up in my head
<br />Quit trying to hold and to help me
<br />Cuz we're already beautiful
<br /><br />So dont make me cry
<br />Cuz this love dont feel so right
<br />You cant push a river
<br />You cant make me fall
<br />But you can make me unreachable
<br /><br />I may be sweet, but im still on the vine
<br />You couldnt wait, no you had to take your bite
<br /><br />You had me crawlin so bad
<br />Had me heels over head
<br />You had me easy, you had me easy
<br />Too late to go back
<br />To realize what we had
<br />We were already beautiful
<br /><br />So dont make me cry
<br />Cuz this love dont feel so right
<br />You cant push a river
<br />You cant make me fall
<br />but you can make me unreachable
<br /><br />Sometimes love is addiction
<br />Sometimes it hurts like hell 
<br />And sometimes you just can't get enough
<br />You can't make me love you,
<br />Any more than i do
<br />But you can make me unreachable
<br /><br />Dont make me cry
<br />Cuz this love dont feel right
<br />You cant push a river
<br />You cant make me fall
<br />But you can make me
<br />So dont make me cry
<br />Cuz this love dont feel so right
<br />You cant push a river
<br />You cant make me fall
<br />But you can make me unreachable

<br />And are there locks on all doors?
<br />If you're looking for an open book
<br />Look no further, I am yours
<br /><br />We'll behave like animals
<br />Swing from tree to tree
<br />We can do anything 
<br />That turns you up and sets you free
<br /><br />You're an exception to the rule
<br />You're a bonafide rarity
<br />You're all I ever wanted
<br />Southern girl
<br />Could you want me?
<br /><br />So come outside and walk with me
<br />We'll try each other on to see if we fit
<br />And with our roots, become a tree
<br />To shade what we make, under it 
<br /><br />We'll behave like animals
<br />Swing from tree to tree
<br />We can do anything 
<br />That turns you up and sets you free
<br /><br />You're an exception to the rule
<br />You're a bonafide rarity
<br />You're all I ever wanted
<br />Southern girl
<br />Could you want me?

<br />And you flew with it on your back 
<br />A name in your recollection 
<br />Down among a million, say: 
<br />Difficult enough to feel a little bit 
<br />Disappointed, passed over. 
<br />When I've looked right through, 
<br />To see you naked and oblivious 
<br />and you don't see me 
<br /><br />Well I threw you the obvious, 
<br />Just to see if there's more behind the 
<br />Eyes of a fallen angel, 
<br />Eyes of a tragedy. 
<br /><br />Here I am expecting just a little bit 
<br />Too much from the wounded 
<br />But I see, 
<br />See through it all, 
<br />See through, 
<br />And see you. 
<br /><br />So I threw you the obvious 
<br />Do you see what occurs behind the 
<br />Eyes of a fallen angel 
<br />Eyes of a tragedy 
<br /><br />Well, oh well.. 
<br /><br />Apparently nothing. 
<br />Apparently nothing at all. 
<br /><br />You don't 
<br />You don't 
<br />You don't see me 
<br />You don't 
<br />You don't 
<br />You don't see me 
<br />You don't 
<br />You don't 
<br />You don't see me 
<br />You don't 
<br />You don't 
<br />You don't see me at all

<br />take me away from the norm
<br />I got to tell you something
<br />this phenomenon
<br />I had to put it in a song
<br />and it goes like
<br /><br />Whoa, amber is the color of your energy
<br />whoa, shades of gold displayed naturally
<br />you ought to know what brings me here
<br />you glide through my head blind to fear
<br />and I know why
<br />whoa, amber is the color of your energy
<br />whoa, shades of gold displayed naturally
<br /><br />Whoa, amber is the color of your energy
<br />whoa, shades of gold displayed naturally
<br /><br />You live too far away
<br />your voice rings like a bell anyway
<br />don't give up your independence
<br />unless it feels so right
<br />nothing good comes easily
<br />sometimes you gotta fight
<br /><br />Whoa, amber is the color of your energy
<br />whoa, shades of gold displayed naturally
<br />launched a thousand ships in my heart, so easy
<br />still it's fine from afar, and you know that
<br />whoa, brainstorm take me away from the norm
<br />whoa, I got to tell you something

<br />Brush right past me
<br />Sometimes you don't understand
<br />Why you can't reach
<br />I bite when I don't want to bend
<br />How silent I can be
<br />So she is silent too
<br />She's the one who saw my words
<br />Broken, Torn at the seams
<br />And broken words were all she heard
<br />Now she's walking away from me
<br />Some never meant
<br />And some meant well
<br />The difference between us is so
<br />Hard to tell
<br />I was so shaken but now
<br />All I see
<br />Is everything she meant to me

<br />Participants all in black and white
<br />You enter in fullblown technicolor
<br />Nothing is the same after tonight
<br /><br />If the world would fall apart
<br />In a fiction worthy wind
<br />I wouldn't change a thing
<br />Now that you're here
<br /><br />Yeah, love is a verb here in my room
<br />Here in my room, here in my room
<br /><br />You enter and close the door behind you
<br />Now show me the world as seen from the stars
<br />If only the lights would dim a little
<br />I'm weary of eyes upon my scars
<br /><br />Pink tractor beam into your incision
<br />Head spinning as free as dervishs' whirl
<br />I came here expecting next to nothing
<br />So thank you for being that kind of girl
<br />That kind of girl

<br />Far too many to count with the naked eye 
<br />They won’t see you

<br />Walk on by 
<br />You don’t know I’m alive 
<br />Maybe one day you’ll find 
<br />You should open your eyes 
<br />You don’t know me 
<br /><br />[Chorus]
<br />You’re the one who looked right through me 
<br />Now you’re saying that you knew me 
<br />When I was invisible 
<br />And you’re the one who walked right through me 
<br />Now you’re saying that you knew me 
<br />When I was invisible 
<br /><br />Little things adding up 
<br />Try so hard not to rush 
<br />Giving in, letting go of the world we know 
<br />They won’t see you 
<br /><br />Force it down 
<br />Lose the taste 
<br />They all think it’s a waste 
<br />We don’t need to believe every word they say, no 
<br />They don’t know me

<br />Tuesday, I am fading
<br />And by Wednesday, I can't sleep
<br />Then the phone rings, I hear you
<br />And the darkness is a clear view
<br />Cuz you've come to rescue me
<br /><br />Fall... With you, I fall so fast
<br />I can hardly catch my breath, I hope it lasts
<br /><br />[Chorus:]
<br />Ohhhhh
<br />It seems like I can finally rest my head on something real
<br />I like the way that feels
<br />Ohhhhh
<br />It's as if you know me better than I ever knew myself
<br />I love how you can tell
<br />All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me
<br />All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me
<br /><br />I am moody, messy
<br />I get restless, and it's senseless
<br />How you never seem to care
<br /><br />When I'm angry, you listen
<br />Make me happy it's your mission
<br />And you won't stop til I'm there
<br /><br />Fall... Sometimes I fall so fast
<br />When I hit that bottom
<br />Crash, you're all I have
<br /><br />[Chorus:]
<br />Ohhhhh
<br />It seems like I can finally rest my head on something real
<br />I like the way that feels

<br />I love how you can tell
<br />All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me
<br /><br />How do you know everything I'm about to say?
<br />Am I that obvious?
<br />And if it's written on my face...
<br />I hope it never goes away... yeah
<br /><br />On a Monday, I am waiting
<br />And by Tuesday, I am fading into your arms...
<br />So I can breathe

<br />When my parents went away
<br />I was stuck inside a broken life
<br />I couldn't wish away
<br />She was beautiful
<br />She had everything and more
<br />And my escape was hiding out and running for the door
<br /><br />Somebody listen please
<br />It used to be so hard being me
<br />Living in the shadow
<br />Of someone else's dream
<br />Trying to find a hand to hold but every touch felt cold to me
<br />Living in a nightmare
<br />A never-ending sleep
<br />But now that I am wide awake
<br />My chains are finally free
<br />Don't feel sorry for me
<br /><br />All the days collided
<br />One less perfect than the next
<br />I was stuck inside someone else's life and always second best
<br />Oh, I love you now 'cause now I realize
<br />That it's safe outside to come alive in my identity
<br /><br />So if you're listening
<br />There's so much more to me you haven't seen
<br />Living in the shadow
<br />Of someone else's dream
<br />Trying to find a hand to hold but every touch felt cold to me
<br />Living in a nightmare
<br />A never-ending sleep
<br />But now that I am wide awake
<br />Then I can finally see
<br />Don't feel sorry for me-
<br /><br />Mother, sister, father, sister, mother
<br />Everything's cool now
<br />Mother, sister, father, sister, mother
<br />Everything's cool now
<br />Oh, my life is good
<br />I've got more than anyone should
<br />Oh, my life is good
<br />And the past is in the past
<br /><br />I was living in the shadow
<br />Of someone else's dream
<br />Trying to find a hand to hold but every touch felt cold to me
<br />I'm living in a new day
<br />I'm living it for me
<br />And now that I am wide awake
<br />Then I can finally see
<br />So don't feel sorry for me
<br />Don't feel sorry, don't feel sorry for me
<br />Don't feel sorry, don't feel sorry for me
<br /><br />Living in, living in, living in the shadow
<br />Living in, living in, living in a new day
