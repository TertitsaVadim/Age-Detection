<br /><br />An accident attorney Orlando or in whichever State you are located will help you get fair claims handling for accidents such as slip and fall accidents, personal injuries, and auto accidents. There are ways to avoid accidents though. When you’re a driver for instance, knowing information and following speeding and traffic rules will help you to avoid accidents. Here is vital information you should be aware of to help you in avoiding accidents. If the unavoidable accident happens though, information about accident attorney Orlando are also included. Read on and learn the essentials to help avoid accidents.
<br /><br />Speeding and Other Traffic Laws
<br /><br />Stay safe and avoid getting traffic tickets by doing the following:
<br /><br />Obey speed limits.  Speed limits are posted to inform drivers of the maximum safe speed for a particular stretch of road. Obeying the posted speed limit keeps your vehicle under control for the type of road you are on, and it also keeps you moving with the flow of traffic. This helps avoid accidents. Complying with the speed limit also keeps you from getting costly speeding tickets, avoids rising insurance rates on your policy, and saves you the time and stress of court appearances.
<br /><br />Children crossing. When you see a school bus displaying a stop sign to its left, do not pass the bus. It is illegal to do so.  More importantly, children are getting off the bus and could dart out in front of the bus and in front of you.  Knowing that you must stop for a school bus that has its stop sign activated will help you avoid hurting innocent children crossing the street.
<br /><br />Honk less. Honking one’s horn should only be done during emergencies. Be especially careful when you are near a school, church or other area that is crowded with pedestrians because your horn can distract other motorists from their driving and could cause them to lose sight of a pedestrian or bicyclist.
<br /><br />Let emergency vehicles pass you. If you hear a siren from an ambulance, police car or fire truck, give them the right of way.  Either pull off to the side of the road or turn off the road completely to let them pass.
<br /><br />Completely stop when it is required. When there are stop signs, make sure you make a complete stop. Look on all directions for other vehicles and pedestrians before you cross.
<br /><br />Accident Attorney Orlando
<br /><br />If an accident happens and you need the help of an expert lawyer to help you get treated fairly, then you would be needing an accident attorney Orlando or an attorney in your area.

<br />The 2012 Florida legislative session resulted in several meaningful changes to the Florida No-Fault (PIP) law.  The changes generally make it more difficult for an injured person to qualify for the same PIP benefits that used to be available. Most of the changes take effect on January 1, 2013.  A summary of the significant changes is as follows:
<br /><br />1.         “Use it or Lose it” – 14 days
<br /><br />An accident victim has to obtain medical treatment within 14 days of the date of the accident or there is no PIP coverage for any medical benefits.  This means that if you think you might get better on your own and decide not to go to the doctor for a few weeks, you will not be entitled to any PIP coverage for medical bills. This is true even though you paid money for PIP insurance. This is a huge change in the PIP law since there was no time limit in the old PIP law.
<br /><br />In addition, your first visit to a doctor must be at a hospital or emergency transport, or by a medical doctor, osteopathic physician, chiropractor or dentist. Massage therapy and accupuncture are no longer covered by PIP.
<br /><br />2.         Medical Coverage is limited to $2,500.00 instead of $10,000.00 unless you have an “Emergency Medical Condition”
<br /><br />The old PIP law granted $10,000.00 in PIP coverage for medical bills. The new PIP law changes this by creating 2 different categories of injured people. One category of injured people is limited to $2,500.00 in medical coverage.  The other category is limited to $10,000.00 in medical coverage. The categories are as follows:
<br /><br />Category #1:
<br /><br />If a person has an “Emergency Medical Condition,” the injured person is entitled to $10,000.00 in PIP medical coverage.  An “Emergency Medical Condition” is defined as
<br /><br />A medical condition manifesting itself by acute symptoms of sufficient severity, which may include severe pain, such that the absence of immediate medical attention could reasonably be expected to result in any of the following:
<br /><br />A.  Serious jeopardy to patient health;
<br /><br />B.  Serious impairment to bodily functions;
<br /><br />C.  Serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part.
<br /><br />A chiropractic physician cannot make the determination that a person has an “Emergency Medical Condition.”
<br /><br />Category #2:
<br /><br />If a person does not have an “Emergency Medical Condition,” the injured person is only entitled to $2,500.00 in PIP medical coverage.
<br /><br />3.         Follow up care must be Consistent with the Initial Diagnosis
<br /><br />If an injured person is in Category #2 such that PIP coverage is limited to $2,500.00, any follow up care must be “consistent with the initial diagnosis” in order to be covered by PIP.  This means that if you are diagnosed with low back pain – and no other problems – during your initial office, any complaints of headaches, shoulder pain or something other than “low back pain” at a follow up visit will not be covered by PIP since it is not “consistent with the initial diagnosis.”
<br /><br />4.         PIP Death Benefit is $5,000.00
<br /><br />The new PIP law offers $5,000.00 in death benefits.
<br /><br />5.         Miscellaneous
<br /><br />The new PIP law changes the rules about insurance company investigations of PIP claims. In short, under the new law, insurance companies have been given more time to investigate any claim they reasonably believe may involve fraud. The insurance company can also require the injured person to submit to an examination under oath before any benefits are owed.
<br /><br />Another change to the PIP law involves regulation of the billing procedures of doctor’s offices. That is, the “fee schedule” sets forth more clearly the amount of money that a doctor can charge for a particular type of treatment. In addition, billing and communications can be made electronically if they are transmitted by secure electronic data transfer.
<br /><br />The new PIP law also regulates the amount that attorney’s can be awarded if they win a PIP case against an insurance company.  Contingency fee risk multipliers are not allowed.  Also, upon request, a Judge can be required to make written findings to support the amount of attorney’s fees that is awarded.
<br /><br />6.         Legal Thoughts
<br /><br />There is considerable debate in the legal community on whether some of the changes to the PIP law are constitutional. In particular, the old PIP law contained a limitation as it concerns an injured person’s “right to sue” an at-fault party for pain and suffering damages.  This limitation on the right to sue was generally thought to be constitutional given that $10,000.00 in PIP insurance benefits was broadly available regardless of who was at fault for the accident.
<br /><br />The new law is not nearly as broad. It contains a 14 day time restriction to qualify for benefits.  It also reduces the available benefits by 75% in that the benefits are reduced from $10,000.00 to $2,500.00 in many cases.  It may be unconstitutional to limit the “right to sue” when the PIP  benefit is only $2,500.00 in PIP coverage.  Many lawyers believe this amount of money is insufficient to supplant the right to sue, particularly when a single visit to the emergency room after an accident can easily absorb most or all of the $2,500.00.  The constitutionality of the new PIP law will be decided in the Florida Courts.  For now, the law has been signed by the governor and it most of its provisions will be in effect on January 1, 2013.

<br />Hiring a trustworthy, experienced, and talented personal injury attorney in times of difficulty is a challenging task especially if you live in Orlando.
<br /><br />Often you look for one when there are economic trials, after an accident, or when legal difficulties arise.
<br /><br />Feeling pressure and time constraint on top of the stress you have with your troubles, how can you find the right personal injury attorney?
<br /><br />Although, one must be able to take time to really choose the right representation. Having the right person or people to fight for your case will help you win. So choose wisely and look into these tips in choosing the right personal injury attorney.
<br />Personal Injury Attorney - Practice and Experience In Orlando
<br /><br />Look into lawyers who have expertise in personal injury cases. Just as you would look for a cardiologist when you have a medical heart problem, looking for an attorney who specializes in the kind of case you have will be beneficial.
<br /><br />You wouldn’t want an cardiologist who would be studying the procedures and delaying your case because of lack of expertise. In the same manner, look for lawyers who have experience aside from expertise.
<br /><br />Personal injury attorney’s who have been practicing longer often times are better than the newer lawyers. Experience aside from the knowledge makes them a better candidate for the job.
<br />Look for Local Personal Injury Attorneys In Orlando
<br /><br />If possible, look for an orlando personal injury attorney if you live in the area.
<br /><br />An Orlando personal injury attorney will be a lot easier to get in touch with someone local.
<br /><br />You can easily set up meetings, call without long distance charges, and visit their office if you have to. Aside from these, local personal injury attorneys would care more about their reputation as they are well established in their communities. Compared to an attorney you saw on TV, an Orlando personal injury attorney would be more accountable for you and your case.
<br />Comfort is Necessary When Hiring A Personal Injury Attorney
<br /><br />Find an attorney you are comfortable with. Someone you know is behind your back no matter what and one who will fight for your cause 100%. Especially when you are feeling stressed, trying to heal from a loss or an injured relative, or if you personally are still recovering from an accident, finding an attorney you can trust and talk to easily will be very helpful.
<br /><br />Make sure that your attorney is likable and that you get along.
<br />Your Personal Injury Attorney In Orlando Should Be Well Recommended
<br /><br />The people you know and you are close with will probably have your best interest at heart. Ask them for recommendations if they have any. Ask your family and really close friends for people they might be able to refer.
<br /><br />Meet with recommended attorneys and look if all other tips match the attorney. With a bit of research and a personal meeting, you’ll probably be able to gauge is the recommendation is a good fit for you and your case.
<br /><br />When choosing a personal injury attorney, take your time. Stays as level headed as you can despite the stresses and hardships you are experiencing. After all, choosing the right attorney will help you win your case or get you a settlement you can live with.

<br /><br />A person really has to wonder why senior citizens are required to pay for Florida No-Fault Insurance on their cars.  Every citizen in Florida that owns a car that is operable is required to have Florida No-Fault Insurance, also called Personal Injury Protection (PIP). You cannot get auto tags for your car unless you have Florida No-Fault.
<br /><br />Florida No-Fault is a limited form of insurance.  It pays 80% of medical bills and 60% of lost wages if you are injured in a car accident.  It does not pay for inconvenience, aggravation, or pain and suffering.
<br /><br />Senior citizens already have Medicare, so they don’t need No-Fault to pay their medical bills.  Senior citizens are usually retired from work, so they don’t need No-Fault to pay for lost wages. It should be obvious to everyone that senior citizens are being asked to pay for a type of insurance that they really do not need.
<br /><br />The same can be said for any citizen in Florida that has health insurance and a wage loss disability policy.  A person who has health insurance and a disability policy already has the same insurance that is provided by No-Fault.  Why pay for No-Fault?
<br /><br />It is true that No-Fault provides coverage for passengers in your car under certain circumstances. If these passengers do not have their own insurance coverage, No-Fault can be valuable insurance for these passengers.  Also, if you are at-fault for an accident, the property damage liability portion of a basic No-Fault policy will pay up to $10,000.00 for damage that you caused to someone else’s property.
<br /><br />But should senior citizens really be required to pay for No-Fault medical and wage loss insurance when they have no personal need for it?

<br />When another driver collides with your vehicle or causes an accident, that driver is responsible for the damages you sustain, whether it is property damage, personal injury, or consequential damages such as loss of work, medical expenses,etc.However, when the insurance company with their adjusters and lawyers get involved, it can be difficult to get what you are entitled. You will need to prove your case and be prepared to put on a jury trial, if the insurance company is being unreasonable. That is the only way to get fair treatment for you and your claim. But, the adjuster knows that you are not going to put on a jury trial, so it is tough to get a reasonable offer without the assistance of an aggressive and experienced personal injury attorney.So, if you have been injured in an car accident, call the Starkerlaw Office for a free consultation and case evaluation or visit us <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fstarkerlaw.com%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://starkerlaw.com/</a>

They are never planned for; therefore, people aren't normally mentally prepared for them, or what to do after they happen. Typically the days or weeks after an unfortunate accident are a mad scramble to seek medical help, letting one's employer know that they cannot work, finding someone to care for the pets and often times finding someone to care for their children.
<br /><br />When our vehicle has been destroyed in an auto accident, multiple phone calls will be made to insurance companies, and car rental companies. If the car has been totaled, someone will have to go to the wrecking yard to remove personal belongings from the vehicle and arrangements will have to be made to turn over the vehicle.
<br /><br />Other types of accidents not involving motor vehicles can also require extensive hospital stays. Arrangements will have to be made for someone else to care for the home, pets and the family. When the victim is seriously injured and unable to make such arrangements, someone else will have to handle things for them.
<br /><br />Needless to say, serious accidents can turn someone's life upside down for extended periods of time. Not only will the victim have to focus on receiving medical treatment, but they will have to figure out how they will manage their life from a hospital bed, or while convalescing at home. The last thing they should be doing is negotiating with insurance companies when they are both unqualified to estimate their claim, and when they are lacking the full physical and mental capacities to go up against large insurance companies.
<br /><br />After an accident, the insurance company has the advantage over an accident victim. Some victims are unable to speak for themselves due to their medical condition; they may need a spouse, family member or friend to help them. While others may be very concerned about how they are going to make ends meet, and in a rush to obtain a settlement, they may accept an offer far below what their claim is worth.
<br /><br />Accident victims should never represent themselves against an insurance company. Insurance companies are in the business of keeping their bottom line as low as possible, and their profit margin high. Even if you are trying to get money from your own insurance company, don't make the mistake of thinking that they are motivated to pay you more just because they are your carrier, or because you pay them payments every month.
<br /><br />Even though people pay premiums to their insurance company, it does not mean that their insurance company won't deny their claim, or offer them a low-ball settlement. It is a widely known fact that an insurance company is likely to offer an accident victim far less on their claim when they are acting alone, than if they had an attorney involved. A lawyer will have the resources necessary to hire vocational experts and economists that can establish your past and future losses. They can also hire independent medical experts, that will be able to have a better estimation of your ongoing medical care, any rehabilitation, or future surgeries that might be necessary.

When death or injury occur, it is necessary to hire a Product Liability Attorney. Drug companies, who now advertise to the masses with mega-million dollar advertising campaigns, attach long lists of potential side effects and potential health risks to their products. Sometimes, the lists are longer than the ad copy itself. Why? They are warning you. Warning because that despite the good their product can do, they know bad things could happen to you. They are covering their legal bases and trying to protect themselves from lawsuits.
<br /><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/185873159_11146060_50736227.jpg" /><span class="textAlign textAlignCenter"></span>
<br />Product Liability claims are generally based on one of these three issues: negligence, breach of warranty or strict liability. The term &quot;Product Liability&quot; refers to the liability of manufacturers, and any or all parties associated with that chain of manufacture for damages caused by the product they produce. This definition is broad in scope, but the actual liability of manufacturers can scroll down to the minutest detail of a product that causes it to be dangerous. Product liability cases are generally based on three concepts:
<br /><br />- a defect in design,
<br /><br />- a defect in the manufacturing process,
<br /><br />- the failure to warn of potential for danger.
<br /><br />These concepts assume that the manufacturer has carefully considered the potential and foreseeable dangers inherent in his product's design. So most claims of Product Liability are not based on negligence, but on a concept called 'strict liability'. Strict liability theory asserts that a manufacturer can be held responsible whether or not he/she acted negligently, because it presupposes that the well-off manufacturer is in a better position to assume the costs of liability than the victim and the manufacturer builds the cost of such liability into the price of his product. California was the first state to assert this theory in 1963 when it stopped requiring victims to prove negligence and allowed for compensation for Product Liability through strict liability. Strict liability theory is rarely applied to anything but manufacturing defect. It rarely includes bad designs or failure to warn. An expert Product Liability Attorney can untangle these issues for you if you feel you've been the victim of Product Liability.
<br /><br />For example, in Virginia a man was using an industrial nozzle and hose to wash down some machinery. The defective nozzle exploded in his face, inflicting catastrophic facial, eye and traumatic Brain Injuries. The manufacturer in China was found to be negligent and strictly liable in its manufacturing of the nozzle. One wall of the nozzle was doubly thick and the other side only a few hair-widths wide. Examination of other similar nozzles found many more examples of such a defect. The Product Liability Attorney recovered $4 million for his injured client.
<br /><br />&quot;Breech of Warranty&quot; claims in Product Liability can cover a broad range of problems. If, for instance, in advertising or marketing a product, the manufacturer makes claims that are not only untrue, they pose a danger to the user, they can be held in breech of warranty. Let's say the manufacturer of a chain saw claims that it's great for cutting turkeys. That also implies it might be useful for cutting other, non-tree limb objects. The company has given instruction on what is a reasonable expectation of the product. But when Sam Dolt uses the chain saw to carve his Thanksgiving turkey and impress his friends, the turkey not only flies off the table injuring his guests, the chain saw jumps off the metal carving plate and hits Sam in the shoulder injuring him, too, who is at fault? Sam, because he was an idiot for carving a turkey with a chain saw? Or the chain saw manufacturer for suggesting it was a good idea. Sam's Product Liability Attorney argued that under breech of warranty theory, the manufacturer is liable because he expressly stated in his marketing campaign that this was one of the product's possible uses. Sam, who does not need to prove negligence, would likely win this case.
<br /><br />Claims of &quot;Failure to Warn&quot; are often considered to be based on negligence. First, manufacturers owe a duty to the consumer to warn of potential problems. If they shirk that duty, then they are negligent. Secondly, if there is an injury and the breech of duty caused that injury, they are negligent. This is why you see little warning labels stuck to electric hair dryers that warn against using near water. The manufacturer can rightly assume that you will be using this dryer in the bathroom (where water is plentiful) and it is their duty to warn you of that potential and foreseeable danger. If they breeched that duty, that would constitute negligence on their part.
<br /><br />If you live in in the state of Florida and feel you have been injured because of product liability, contact an expert Product Liability Attorney in Orlando, Florida. It is important to take this crucial step as soon as possible. There is a time limit on filing Product Liability claims.

Any food that is contaminated in anyway such as with glass or metal particles, or with vermin feces or parts, or food that has been poisoned or improperly stored or prepared is dangerous to the health of anyone who would consume it, and is classified as not fit for human consumption. Sometimes it is not as obvious as to why or how the food has become tainted so a review by a trained professional may be required in order to assign liability.

<br />Failing to take certain precautions and uphold this duty could result in legal liability for those who suffer harm. This includes paying for medical expenses, a loss of income, pain and suffering, as well as any future medical bills associated with the illness, or permanent disabilities.
<br /><br />Victims of food poisoning do not have to prove that the person who served the food knew it was harmful, however if any employee knew of a potential problem and did not stop the food from being served, this information could prove quite helpful in a food poisoning lawsuit.
<br /><br />When to File a Legal Claim, and When Not To
<br /><br />Just because you got sick from eating food that came from a commercial establishment does not mean that you have grounds for a lawsuit, or that you should file a lawsuit. If for example, you have experienced a day or two of intestinal or stomach problems that left you a bit dehydrated, but no worse for wear, you do not really have a viable claim. Even if you still wanted to file such a claim, the benefit would not outweigh the costs, and most attorneys would not feel as though the potential damages recouped would be worthwhile.
<br /><br />For the most part, the majority of food poisoning cases resolve on their own, without medical intervention in a matter of a couple of days. These types of cases, if you must pursue them, could be filed in a small claims court, to seek minimal damages. That being said, if you have been severely poisoned, resulting in hospital bills, a loss of income for a month or more, permanent health problems such as muscle or nerve damage, or even a death has resulted, you have grounds for a much more serious legal claim.
<br /><br />Actions to Take if Food Poisoning is Suspected
<br /><br />If you suspect that you have been poisoned by eating food at a commercial outlet, the first thing you should do is seek medical attention. For the most part, symptoms that appear within a short period of time after eating the food are indicative of food poisoning. While it may be difficult because the restaurant will not save it for you, you should try to preserve some of the food if possible for use as evidence later. If it is found that the food poisoning is more serious in nature, the victim or his or her family or friends should contact a personal injury attorney who specializes in food poisoning as soon as possible. These professionals know how to secure evidence that will be needed at a later date, as well as obtain statements from witnesses and employees right away, before memories fade over time.
<br /><br />If you suspect food poisoning almost immediately after consuming the food, or even while still at the commercial outlet, you may want to talk to the employees yourself to find out if they knew about the issue, or have had other similar problems. You may be surprised by how much information you can obtain in this fashion. This type of information can help a great deal should you end up pursuing a legal claim. Not only that, anyone who was served the same food should write down exactly what they ate, as it will be important down the road and they may not remember later on. This helps to establish a strong case for the source of the contaminated food.
<br /><br />What to Do If You Experience Food Poisoning on Vacation
<br /><br />Should you fall ill while eating food on vacation, look for a personal injury attorney locally; do not wait until you are home. If you fall ill while on a cruise ship or at a resort, it is not likely that the staff or management will admit fault, and they will claim you are ill for another reason. That being said, if a large number of people on the same ship or at the same resort fall ill, then it is quite obvious the food is to blame. If the extent of the illness is not severe, a free trip, or free meals may be issued for compensation. There are no laws governing how much compensation should be given, however.
<br /><br />When to Hire an Attorney
<br /><br />If your case of food poisoning exceeds a small amount that would be handled in a small claims court, it is wise to contact a personal injury attorney who specializes in this area of the law. Since a restaurant's livelihood is based upon their reputation, do not expect an admission of guilt easily. This is where an attorney can come in quite handy. He or she is skilled in documentation and investigation into these types of claims and can easily obtain required information.
<br /><br />If you or someone you know has suffered because of food poisoning and you suspect negligence has occurred, it is best not to wait to contact a personal injury attorney. More than likely you may be entitled to receive damages for medical bills, pain and suffering, and even loss of income. Most personal injury attorneys work on a contingency basis, which means you have nothing to pay upfront, until the time your case is settled. You should not hesitate to take the proper steps to seek the justice you deserve. You are not only protecting yourself, but also the health of others.
<br /><br />If you or a friend or family member feel that you have been the victim of food poisoning, please contact Law Office of Jeffrey D. Starker, P.A. for a free consultation.

What is medical malpractice? It's a mistake, often called medical negligence, made by a doctor, nurse, or other medical professional that results in a patient's injury. Doctors and medical facilities maintain malpractice insurance policies to pay for these mistakes, and patients can file lawsuits against the doctor and medical facility or hospital to receive money for the injuries.
<br /><br />The most obvious type of medical malpractice is a mistake made during surgery. This famously happened to comedian and former Saturday Night Live star, Dana Carvey. He had a blocked artery to his heart, but the surgeon ended up operating on the wrong artery. This meant that Carvey had to undergo a second surgery. In this high profile medical malpractice case, Carvey was awarded $7.5 million.
<br /><br />Other surgical mistakes could lead to infection, paralysis, accidentally cutting a vital organ, or leaving a foreign object inside the patient's body. Surgical mistakes are only one type of medical malpractice, however. These cases can involve any number of mistakes, such as:
<br /><br />Misdiagnosis - A doctor may inaccurately determine that a patient has one condition or disease when it is later discovered that the patient had a different condition or disease. If the real disease goes untreated, it can lead to injury or death. A misdiagnosis may also lead the doctor to prescribe the wrong medications or unnecessary surgery, which can cause injury to the patient.
<br /><br />Delayed diagnosis - In this case, the physician fails to determine that the patient has a serious illness such as cancer or heart disease. Obviously, if the person isn't treated because the doctor failed to recognize the illness, it could lead to injury or death. A delay can also occur if someone is forced to wait in an emergency room for too long, for example.
<br /><br />Anesthesia Mistakes - Anesthesiologists are responsible for the medication that causes a patient to sleep during a medical procedure. Since people can be sensitive to these medications, it's the responsibility of the anesthesiologist to review a patient's medical history to try to ensure that the anesthesia medication won't cause problems. If it does, the anesthesiologist and medical facility may be sued for the patient's injuries.
<br /><br />Prescriptions - Before prescribing medications, a doctor needs to know all other medications that a patient may be taking because it can be dangerous to mix them. It can also be dangerous to take some medications if the patient has a specific disease. For example, a particular heart medication may be dangerous for someone with Parkinson's Disease.
<br /><br />Childbirth - If medical personnel make mistakes during childbirth, the result can be death or permanent disabilities, such as brain damage in the baby.
<br /><br />Of course, these are just a few of the more common forms of medical malpractice. Dental malpractice and all sorts of other possibilities exist in the medical field.
<br /><br />What to Do If You Have Been Injured by Medical Malpractice
<br /><br />If you believe that you or a loved one has been injured by medical malpractice, the first thing you need to do is consult a lawyer. These kinds of cases can be very complicated, so it's absolutely necessary to have an experienced attorney working on your behalf.
<br /><br />Why are these cases so complicated? It can often be difficult to prove that the medical professionals acted negligently. All medical records have to be carefully examined to determine if malpractice really did take place. Did the doctor not perform his or her duties up to the standards expected of the profession? This can be likened to a driver who runs a red light or doesn't stop for a stop light.
<br /><br />It is also important to note that each state has what is called a &quot;statute of limitations&quot; on medical malpractice claims. So, you need to act quickly if you believe malpractice has taken place because after a period of time, you will no longer be allowed to file a lawsuit.
<br /><br />Most lawyers who work on medical malpractice cases don't require you to pay them a fee up front. They work on what is called a &quot;contingency&quot; basis, which means that they take a percentage of the total settlement you receive when the case is finished. The lawyer takes a certain risk here, so it's to the lawyer's advantage to only take cases that are likely to lead to a settlement that will be higher than the costs of the lawsuit. This means, first and foremost, that there must be what is called &quot;causation.&quot;
<br /><br />Causation means that it must be provable that the injury occurred as a direct result of the medical professional's negligence. Most of the lawyers who handle medical malpractice cases have medical investigators to help them develop the evidence to prove that you or your loved one was indeed a victim of malpractice.
<br /><br />It's also to the lawyer's advantage to try to get you as much money as possible and to try to keep your case from going to court. This means that the lawyer will negotiate on your behalf with the lawyer for the malpractice insurance company, working to obtain a settlement for you. Experienced medical malpractice attorneys know what settlement amounts are reasonable to expect for different kinds of cases.
<br /><br />How long do medical malpractice lawsuits take to settle? This varies greatly and depends on a number of factors. The more complex the issues involved, of course, the longer it will probably take before a settlement will be reached.
<br /><br />The most important reason for filing a medical malpractice lawsuit is to receive the money you need for medical care related to the injury. If the injury is permanent, such as in the case of cerebral palsy or paralysis, the costs can be enormous and will last a lifetime. The injured person or the caretaker of the injured person may not be able to work for a period of time, so there may also be a loss of income - before the settlement and perhaps also in the future.
<br /><br />In addition, there may be money awarded for what is called &quot;pain and suffering&quot; and for &quot;loss of consortium,&quot; which refers to a loss of benefits by the injured person's husband or wife. Punitive damages are also sometimes awarded, which is punishment when the negligence is extreme. Monies in the settlement that are for non-economic damages, such as pain and suffering, punitive damages, and loss of consortium, are restricted in some U.S. states.
<br /><br />Another reason for filing a medical malpractice suit, however, is to make sure that the medical professional isn't negligent with other patients. This doesn't mean that the doctor will be forced to stop practicing medicine, however. In most cases, the malpractice is considered to be an honest mistake. The negligence must be extreme for a doctor to lose his or her medical license, and the health department is the agency that must make that decision.

		<document id="66877f6be194f3e15e07d40696c820c2" url=""><![CDATA[Florida Dog Bite Accidents! How To Handle?<br/><br/>People of the United States are famous for loving animals. Most of the homes in U.S. have domestic pets. Cats are the most favorite pets in the United States pushing dogs to the second position. According to the Pet Owners Survey conducted by the American Pet Products Manufacturers, there are 88.3 millions domestic cats and 74.8 million domestic dogs in U.S. People consider these furry friends as parts of their family.
<br /><br />With increasing popularity of pets, chances of personal injury due to animal attack are also rising. Animal attacks may lead to serious injuries and even death. It has been reported that children are attacked by domestic animals more often than adults.
<br /><br />Lots of animal attack cases and dog bite personal injury compensation claims are filed in the Florida court of law every year. Below is a list of reasons behind animal attack accident.Common reasons behind animal attack personal injury cases:
<br /><br />Irritating dogs or the animals
<br />    Letting children play with pets without proper precautions taken
<br />    Dogs escaping the boundaries
<br />    Unwanted entries inside private places
<br />    Improper pet care

<br /><br />What to do when it is victim's own fault?
<br /><br />As said before, victims can still file charges against the pet owner or the handler. If the pet handler fails to confine the dog within the boundaries and the dog attacks somebody in a public place, the victims can file charges against the pet handler even when it is victim's own fault. The pet handler or the pet owner is held responsible for the damages caused to the victim.
<br /><br />Hence, the reason of animal attack should be properly investigated before presenting it to the court. Victims should consult expert personal injury lawyers who are specialized in dog bite cases so that the case is judged in their favor.
<br /><br />It is better to consult a local lawyer because animal laws vary by states. If the event of animal attack happens in Florida, consult Florida personal injury lawyers. An efficient lawyer will prepare the plan of action appropriately and help the victims receive right compensation.
<br /><br />How Florida personal injury lawyers help to win dog bite cases?
<br /><br />Personal injury lawyers perform the following tasks in the right manner as required by law:
<br /><br />Collect evidences and other essential documents that help to understand how the attack happened
<br /> Collect medical report and statement from the physician who attended the victim first Obtain statements from witnesses who were present at the spot Instruct the animal attack victims on how to answer to the questions asked by defense counsel and judge in court
<br /><br />Who can be held responsible for animal attacks in Florida?
<br /><br />Pet owners
<br />    Pet handler
<br />    Owner of the premise
<br />    Landlords
<br />    Parents of the minors in case the owner is minor
<br /><br />The above mentioned entities can be held responsible for the accident. However, in Florida, the liability strictly goes to the pet owner. To identify the merits of the case, the victims should immediately consult Florida lawyers so that legal proceedings can be started soon.

Majority of car accidents are caused by carelessness and unruliness of drivers. Some may also occur due to intoxication or drug-influenced operation of cars. Poorly designed roads and inappropriate traffic signals combined with defective vehicles or tires may also cause accidents. In order to compensate for damages incurred, charging a lawsuit against the negligent driver may be required.

<br />Motorcycle accidents are often considered dangerous than figuring in a four-wheeled vehicle mishap. This is because the risk of the motorcycle rider sustaining serious physical injuries is greater than that of the driver in a car or truck. In fact, a great number of accidents involving cars and motorcycles or object collisions, resulted in the rider of motorcycles being treated for life-threatening injuries.
<br /><br />There are varied causes of these accidents. It could be that the rider himself, or the vehicle he collided with, is at fault. However, there is growing evidence that some motorcycles have factory defects that may have been the primary reason why its rider lost control. If you figured in this kind of accident, or have a loved one who did, then it would be proper to demand fair compensation for injuries you may have sustained.
<br /><br />While you certainly have the right to file a claim for damages against those whom you believe is liable, the complex law statutes that govern motorcycle accidents, and the complicated process of litigation, sometimes makes it difficult for victims to seek redress. More often than not, the victims themselves get the full blame for the accident. Aside from this, the period allowed in the filing of a lawsuit involving motorcycle accidents is so short that the victim may not have enough time to file it within the prescribed period. This is why it is necessary to hire the services of competent motorcycle accident lawyers to help you seek justice.
<br /><br />Motorcycle accident lawyers are experts in studying all the aspects leading to the mishap. It may be that another vehicle was at fault or the motorcycle itself had certain mechanical problems that have been present from the time it left the factory. In the first instance, the lawyer may contact the driver of the other vehicle and express your intention in seeking compensation. Negotiations may follow but if it will fail, then your lawyer can immediately file a case against the driver of the other vehicle.
<br /><br />If, however, the motorcycle you rode in is reputed to have factory defects, then your lawyer can seek compensation from the makers of the motorcycle themselves. There are several ways on how your motorcycle accident lawyers may proceed with your case. They may contact directly the motorcycle company officials and if the compensation offer is unacceptable, your lawyers may bring them to court.
<br /><br />Going up against a motorcycle manufacturer is not that easy and you need solid evidence to back up your claim. This is where the services of a motorcycle accident attorney is most valuable because he or she can gather evidence and secure witnesses' testimonies to firm up your lawsuit. They can also research on similar accidents that may have happened in the past involving the same motorcycle and seek out the victims or surviving relatives of such mishaps. They can include this information in your claim and may even decide to file for a class action suit against the motorcycle company.

		<document id="b12df498c537bdf4e3ab8ce3a01fdec4" url=""><![CDATA[Trucking Accidents And The Law<br/><br/>Each year, millions of people end up in collisions while on the road, whether driving down the highway or cruising through the scenic back roads. Fortunately, a majority of these collisions are not serious, and damage is measured largely in dollars and cents than in recovery time. However, for a small percentage of people, these accidents can be life-changing, and leave families in a state of complete shock and uncertainty. Getting your life back after a collision that leaves you or a loved one seriously injured, or causes the death of someone close to you, is a task that's far easier said than done.
<br /><br />Out of all the types of accidents that occur on America's roads each year, incidents involving large trucks have the highest potential for fatality or life-altering injury. Because most trucking accidents occur between a truck and one or more cars, rather than two trucks colliding on the road, the potential for damage is absolutely devastating. In the case that a truck is carrying hazardous materials, the extent of injury can reach far beyond the two or three vehicles with immediate involvement in the crash. Accidents involving large trucks can be thoroughly destructive, and leave people feeling helpless and hopeless in the face of injury.
<br /><br />Fortunately, you are not alone. You don't need to struggle through the pain and suffering associated with recovery and rehabilitation, while wondering who is going to take care of your family. Chances are, you're unable to work and insurance is debating whose responsibility it is to take care of your medical bills, or simply refusing to pay. In the middle of all the pain, loss, and chaos, there should be someone there to defend your rights and ensure you don't continually suffer for another person's mistake.
<br /><br />If you've been seriously injured and are unable to work due to a devastating collision that simply wasn't your fault, it's a good idea to contact an attorney. In many cases, these tragic accidents are often avoidable, and occur because a truck hasn't been properly maintained or serviced by the company. In some instances, truck drivers are forced to work long shifts and cover miles of distance on the road, pushing even the most experienced and aware drivers past the limits of what is safe. There are many reasons these types of tragedies occur, but none of them are justifiable excuses for walking away without paying the consequences. If you've been hurt, time is of the essence. Call a trusted personal injury attorney in your area, and get the helping hand you need to win your life back.
<br /><br />Have you been the victim of a truck accident? if so, then you have compensation to claim for any expenses you have after accident. The Law Office of Jeffrey D. Starker,P.A. will help you
<br />with your settlement and legal rights. Contact Us for a FREE Case Review - 407-644-3921 or visit us <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fstarkerlaw.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://starkerlaw.com</a>

		<document id="af01a10365af6e1da5644da119b3c449" url=""><![CDATA[A Look at Product Liability Law<br/><br/>Product liability cases will come in in several different sorts. For instance, due to negligence, you may see yourself or perhaps a person in your family seriously injured as the consequence of anything from malfunctioning toys and games right through to contaminated food to malfunctioning autos. Without regard to any root grounds for a specific products liability claim, you may be entitled to extensive compensation for those injuries that you have received and on many occasions, for any losses that you're going to encounter in the future among them lost salary, medical-related charges and the like.
<br /><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/185873159_16106347_50830318.jpg" /><span class="textAlign textAlignCenter"></span>
<br />Product liability cases are extremely difficult and have to have a superior amount of expertise. The difficulties of these forms of cases need many levels of defendants, expert witnesses requiring a considerable investment of time and additionally finances, an understanding of how to deal with the actual discovery technique in unknown states or countries, and knowing which legal courts have got jurisdiction on the subject.
<br /><br />For anybody who is hurt caused by a malfunctioning product, the liability for this kind of injuries is normally attributable either to manufacturer, the distributor, the wholesaler and / or the retailer of these kinds of product.
<br /><br />Defective Products Law is categorized under personal injury/tort law and is directly associated with litigation law. It identifies a claim against all parties along the cycle of manufacture (designers, manufacturers, distributors and retailers) of merchandise that contain defects that harm people resulting in personal injury or loss.
<br /><br />Product liability cases are specialised cases that need knowledge of product liability law and also expert witnesses who have precise expertise in the product concerned.
<br /><br />Liability claims may be filed by either the consumer of the product, or maybe by anyone to who this product had been loaned or given. Whilst there is absolutely no federal government product liability law, virtually all state governments currently have product liability laws.
<br /><br />Typically the claims usually related to Product Liability in the USA are negligence, strict liability, breach of warranty, and consumer protection claims. A model of liability called &quot;stream of commerce&quot; functions in most states, meaning if your firm participates in placing the merchandise into the &quot;stream of commerce,&quot; it could instantly be held liable for potential damages to the end user.
<br /><br />A key concern in any liability lawsuit is whether or not the product has a defect, that is definitely an imperfection which renders a product hazardous for its designated use. Design flaws exist each time a overall type of products might be improperly designed to the extent as to pose unreasonable danger to consumers.
<br /><br />In the concept of &quot;strict liability,&quot; a lawsuit might be registered without the need to establish negligence or even fault if an injury is the result of a harmful product. This approach makes it less difficult for any injured consumer to take legal action against either the product manufacturer or the shop where the product had been bought. Both state and also federal laws affect product liability cases, making it puzzling at times to know the absolute right place to file a lawsuit. This is especially valid should a manufacturer operates in various states.
<br /><br />You can consult a Florida Product Liability Lawyer in any circumstances and he will be able to guide you through the whole process of claiming and getting the money back. Click here to know more about a Product Liability Lawyer.

The age of lawsuits means that people are quick to sue for any wrongs they feel have been committed against them. While most doctors do everything they can to avoid being sued for malpractice, sometimes there is just nothing they can do. Even when they do everything right, something can still go wrong - and the doctor often takes the blame for these problems, whether they were responsible or not. Unfortunately, it is very simple for someone to bring a lawsuit against another person today, but on the bright side there is a complex process which rules out most frivolous suits.
<br /><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/185873159_14277364_50838274.jpg" /><span class="textAlign textAlignCenter"></span>
<br />The definition of medical malpractice is the deviation by a medical professional from the standards of the medical industry, thus causing injury or death to a patient. True medical malpractice is rare, but lawsuits for medical malpractice are not very rare. Successful malpractice suits must follow the definition of medical malpractice in that they prove that the doctor, through action or inaction, caused wrongful injury to a patient. Typically, this means that a practitioner grossly violated the standards set by the medical industry.
<br /><br />Because of the presence of medical malpractice lawsuits, medical professionals are required to maintain personal liability insurance to protect them and offset the costs of malpractice suits. However, in keeping with the definition of medical malpractice, the lawsuit must prove that the medical professional violated medical standards. This requires an expert to prove that there was a violation of standards. With medicine becoming more and more advanced, there are more things that can go wrong. This means that malpractice suits can take advantage of the legal aspects of medicine not being caught up with the practice.
<br /><br />As new medical practices continue to push the envelope, people will seek reasons to sue when things go wrong, but the definition of medical malpractice protects doctors from many lawsuits filed by people who are just looking to put the blame somewhere. Fortunately for doctors who are concerned about wrongful lawsuits, there has been a recent push to reform many of the torts which govern the medical industry. They are intended to eliminate lawsuits filed by people who, for whatever reason, feel they were wronged by their doctors.
<br /><br />There have been numerous high profile lawsuits against doctors who were said to have violated the definition of medical malpractice, but the fact is that these expensive lawsuits negatively impact the ability of the medical industry to offer quality care when they are brought about by people who are simply seeking money. With the new reforms that are being put into place, it is likely that frivolous lawsuits will begin to decline. As it is, they are on the rise and have been for quite some time. If something is not done to stop wrongful medical malpractice suits, the medical industry will continue to be inhibited in its ability to provide quality care at reasonable cost.
