<br />your view,your sight is torn..
<br />moonlight almost all thats spawned..
<br />like plagues or hoards..
<br />of eluminus particles..
<br />darkness consumes..a few stars sparkle..
<br />as this full sphere beams its refection..
<br />in teams it streams in my direction..
<br />feel fear,for it appears theres no protection..
<br />from what will transpire..in only moments..
<br />maybe these over advanced canines show as an omen..
<br />i feel an energy growin..serging through my veins..
<br />im changing.....
<br />my physical form is painfully rearranging..
<br />am i insane??..
<br />or is this literal and not illusion..
<br />some weird form of human and beast fusion..
<br />accept its my fate,to sease the confusion..
<br />once metamorphisized..no stoppen me abusen..
<br />losen all sense of sensible thinking..
<br />only thought to make lifes short..and there is drinking..
<br />blood,life force,what we pump through our arterys..
<br />while blackness runs through the heart of me..
<br />being moonlit when its full,opens an evil part of me ..
<br /><br />fighting hard to breath,as i transform,primevil senses heighten..
<br />see im no normal man,cursed when born,the prequal events of this lycan..
<br />part wolf part man..somethin out of this world,but not martian..
<br />i feel rage starting,to build up,i think its almost done..
<br />if u see this happening first and foremost run..
<br />as fast as u can..at least hide real well..
<br />if u are who i find..im make u see with your eyes a real hell..
<br />all the beasts senses' kick in and i smell..
<br />fear in the air..must be mortals near to me..
<br />they are downwind.....(sniffs)...
<br />i hear their young voices sounding..
<br />hatred and hunger to kill surrounding..my sanity..
<br />i never asked to be this danger  to humanity..
<br />satanically indulge in the murderous frenzy..
<br />praying for the day when  the silver bullet ends me..
<br />send me to heaven,cause my mortal side is friendly..
<br />i envy,the lifes of the multitude..just normality..
<br />meet and eat skip the shit the formailities..
<br />they always win no matter how many times i battle these..
<br />infections like a cancerous tumor..
<br />this story must be told to cancel the rumours..
<br /><br />now im on thw hunt,very distant from the man before..
<br />i have sharp teeth hair like beast my hands have claws..
<br />i howl at the sight of the moon at its fullest..
<br />pounce on prey'n'slay..while dodgen zippen bullets..
<br />blood lust..bodies thud and such..after blood is gushed..
<br />flash back as the throat of my one love is crushed..
<br />not by another but me in a fit of rage..i was blinded..
<br />if i could only stop time and then rewind it..
<br />my helpless soul i just have to find it hiden..
<br />why oh god why did this full moon have ot be risen..
<br />despisen the destiny in blessed to me ..
<br />this evil force infestin me..causing me to kill regardless..
<br />as every little portion of my will u harness..normally harmless..
<br />kill daughters.mothers,brothers and fathers..heartless..
<br />moon behind the clouds the fever passes..moments except....
<br />comsumed once more,when round light breaks..doom is spread..
<br />usually try to hide from the moon in my room instead..
<br />cause i lose it its true..and when i do..its moonlit death...

<br />the day when if u strayed with ya trade these squads'd buckle ya..
<br />sea faring men..on the hunt for riches..
<br />plunderin..boats and coasts..and rapen their bitches..
<br />only books and colours..usually paint these pictures..
<br />of battles on the ocean..and water boardering towns..
<br />the shots from muskets..drunkin laughter'n swords colliding the sounds..
<br />that come to mind.. apart from the cannon blasts..
<br />the painful screams of death from men of class..
<br />after surrendering all they held of wealth..
<br />no time to hide it all..they creapt in in the night in stealth..
<br />no help..as they were to far from the closest garrison..
<br />these scurvey dogs..make the muscle in the village look embarassing..
<br />toying with them before they apply the finishing blow..
<br />then on to the next tryin to stem the flow.. of this raid they partake in..
<br />robed and slayed by the forsaken..
<br />the captain..anticipatin the bounty..while he sits on the ship waitin..
<br />his mind taken to the days when..he was found in a basement..
<br />by the captain that made him the master and comander he is today blessed..
<br />and how..he had to climb the chain of command doin what the men are now..
<br />right then he's brought back..by the vocal voices of victory..
<br />blood soaked men'n boys joy in their adopted ploys..some sickening..
<br />proud of my sickly breed..shifty theives..that are sure to always get loot..
<br />to fail..punishment worse then gettin ya neck noosed..
<br />its plank walkin time..or a trip to davey jones's locker..
<br />u may just have to wait till the sharks find u and shock ya..
<br />that might be the inspiration for their sucsessfulness..
<br />with all the grusomness the rum helps us supress'n'forget..
<br />the more we drink the more we get..the less we regret..
<br />the atrosoties we've seen and been through at sea..
<br />more gore and horror then anything u would see on a screen..
<br />the trails and tribulations of the real bucuneers of the caribian..
<br />more sweat and tears'n'flesh and bone..
<br />more wrechard damn years..maybe the best are gone..
<br />in my chest the strong..beats of my heart intensify..
<br />clutch my breast as i think &quot;im not ment to die&quot;..
<br />at least not yet.. still have so much liquid land to explore..
<br />only got so much gold and jewels and plunder when theres more..
<br />to be gained..so please soul do not leave me..grim reaper refrain..
<br />at least let me be slay'n..in the heat of a unwinable blood thirsty attack..
<br />by a whole spanish massive fleet or armada..sent to stop us.for pay back..
<br />for all the things we have done to their kinfolk..
<br />leave me wounded fataly..but standin tall on my sinkin boat..
<br />let me at least keep true to what the saying said..
<br />just then a cannon ball flys past my head..the pain stops im not dead..
<br />the gods allowing me to die with the dignaty that i ask for instead..
<br />so i rise to my feet steel balls unsettling the waters..
<br />tell me men to load the cannons..as i retrieve my sword and muskt from my quaters..
<br />reapear and start barking orders..this is what we've lived for..the fight of our lives..
<br />men wealding their guns and sabres as they bite on their knives..
<br />the moon in the night is our light..breaks the darkness like the waves breakin white..
<br />in the distance see flaming blasts from vast amounts of vessels..
<br />all of a sudden one of the steel balls nessles..
<br />right into the side of us..
<br />before its to late lets pick a boat and collide with it..
<br />before all of the opossitions' collide with us..
<br />we ride the gusts.. of ocean breeze..towards a ship..
<br />we got glimpse of in the mist'n its thickness..
<br />once again my hearts rate quickens..
<br />as we reach the craft that we ended up picken..
<br />i roar &quot;board it boys lets see if we can take her&quot;..
<br />as cannon balls baraged our old ship and they sank her..
<br />the suns risen now..and we see other rebels of the sea have flanked the..
<br />fleet of gallions sent to crush the pirate king..
<br />the greatness of this captain inspiren these..
<br />others to come to aid a brother in arms..
<br />light takes over the sky once smothered in stars..
<br />a new day..a new war..a new struggle for survival..
<br />a new day to smuggle a war gallion from my rival..
<br />as we serge on..vergin on..triumph..
<br />and im up where the wheel is..right as i make my cutless rise up..
<br />pride in my kind touches me waters my eyes up..
<br />the earlier pain beneath my ribs resurfaces..
<br />we defeated the people that came for me for with a purpose..
<br />gettin nervous as this hurt is gettin deeper..
<br />blurin sight..thinkin will i get to meet the heavens gate keeper..
<br />or taken below to purgitory by the grim reaper..
<br />i collapse life fading..to die..after goin down in history..
<br />happy to leave with this for this is pure bliss to me..
<br />it was a gift to be who i was in this life..
<br />site losin the light..as my vision leaves me ..
<br />nothing compares to the life sea breeds..
<br />last thing i feel is ocean sprays on my cheek..
<br />last thing i hear is commotion as all my strays somberly speak..
<br />with my last breaths i call for them to return me to my sinkin boat..
<br />and on that note..i spill the last breath from my throat..
<br />i feel as my body falls on the half submerged deck..soaked..
<br />towards the astral plane my soul starts to rise after death and float..
<br />so even to this day if u listen..u might just hear the haunting echos..
<br />of a pirate and his ocean and his inability to let go.................

<br />when i was looking for wenches to rape and things to pillage..
<br />she was lurking down a dark alley..and through my mind she still is ..
<br />it was a misty eve..maybe this decieved my first impression..
<br />i was moving at haste, for i had stolen jewels in my posession..
<br />so dicretion was a must..but i just had to follow, down the lane..
<br />i could smell her sent.. but thats now swallowed by the rain..
<br />and its sprays as it hits rooftops and stone roads..
<br />to her i am unknown.. in her head she roams alone..
<br />but so i thought..u see i did not know who she really was yet..
<br />my mind was set..on finding that out,with or without aproval..
<br />confront her in the light after the nights shadows' removal..
<br />unbeknown her lure pulled.. me closer to her web of deciet..
<br />i walked at a distance in the dark till dawn. dead on my feet..
<br />thats when we reached her dwellin just as the sun rose..
<br />she entered in quiet a hurry as hot rays hit my face..
<br />i have never been here before.. never seen this place..
<br />is what i thought as i took in the surroundings..
<br />bells sounding in the distance far away..
<br />the churches rising to the start of the day..
<br />no bells here tho i relize as i proceed to what looks like a ruin..
<br />persuein the prize i had seen with my own eyes..
<br />i cant see her at this chosen time but she sees all im doing..
<br />miscontrueing my thoughts making me want to find her..
<br />i find her cloak , she thought she would help with a reminder..
<br />of her sweet alluring smell that had me captivated in the first place..
<br />worst case in my mind.. maybe its a robbery..an ambush..
<br />..all of a sudden i feel a hand push.. me to the damp dusty floor..
<br />hands cut and torn from the fall..i turn over and look up at my oposition..
<br />to react cause i wanna keep liven..it was her but..with wings sharp teeth and a tail..
<br />all the while huntin me.. while i think im on her tail 'n trail..
<br />she smiled at me and said she wasnt going to kill me, she liked me..
<br />she had been observing..yeah watching me nightly..&quot;but that wont stop me from biting&quot;
<br />she said as she jumped on me and plunged her fangs in my neck..
<br />gripping it tight almost faint,stealin my blood and my breath..
<br />just for the moment but i will get my rewards..
<br />to live for ever,like a god..control twist and read thoughts..
<br />of the mortal populus..most have weak minds..
<br />able to lead and reign upon those when i speak mine..
<br />i lay there still for a time..conscious but not breathin, heart not beatin..
<br />now empowered by the force that started to weaken..
<br />all of a sudden a rush of adrenalin flows internally..
<br />everyone must choose their life i chose enternally eternity...
<br />now a vampire.dracula. nosferatu..a lycan...
<br />here to strike in the night like lightnin..
<br />feed on what u bleed to help my live elovate and inbrighten..
<br />no use fighten the hunger..its relentless.. and enjoyable..
<br />the sweet young women are defenceless,senseless, by my use of deployable..
<br />mind tricks and thought induction..they become willing wanting..
<br />this villian is hunting..blood..on a rainy eve leave their body in mud..
<br />as i leave the scene..and return to my queen..the one who gave me this blessing..
<br />i feed her the preist..that live to forgive those who are confessing..
<br />now and evermore i will be the lord for and of the vampire goddess i live for..
<br />this is just part of the whole story if i had more lines..id give more...
<br /><br />to be coninued........

<br />christened to shine and glisten.. so listen to the gift from the lord..
<br />switchen the course..on this journey through life..
<br />judging and burning through cyph..thinkin this aint concerning u right???.
<br />but i could start spurtin a few lines..and turn a few guys..into beaten indeviduals..
<br />and any other guy near me on the mic or in cyph..melt from the heat'n be residual...
<br /><br />take over mindsets of vets..the true head ruler..
<br />myown mind deeper and darker.. then the gloom of a starless nebula..
<br />creep in this darkness..and consume humans fastest..some say im heartless..
<br />in the darkest arts blessed..kineticly formed darts sharpness hits hard on ya chest..
<br />then my twin side parts in half ..the half thats crafted your pass from the start..darts past on the left..
<br />in the corner of your eye on the right u see the other side glide as a blinding light..
<br />inspire your inner fears fire rise higher..rise so high its inside ya mind intwining minds' eye..
<br />with crys of confusion..tied and held in a bind by this intrusion of illusion..
<br />no solution or conclusion.. to sease this .. these are purpetual powers..
<br />even the so called nonsuseptable cower..its this interlectuals hour...
<br />to reign down and not shower..supernatural sorcery..asteral portals feed..
<br />from the celestrial..to devower..

<br />thoughts rushing deep within my brain..emotions i keep them  in contained..
<br />it was said in the past,that man would bring about his own demise..
<br />as he watched the depletion of the ozone before his eyes..
<br />mixing chemicals for weapons, hoping to gain the upper hand..
<br />when in the end, the only thing that truely suffers is the land..
<br />erotion,salidity,landlsides,and earthquakes..
<br />and explosion of stupidity,the land crys and the earth breaks..
<br />this worlds hurt takes, a different form,natural distasters..
<br />talk bout this planet dieing in the past,u'd actually hear laughter..
<br />these days its a changed face,of so many that wore a smile..
<br />sure humans thought this atrosity was far beyond us for a while..
<br />but as the years went on,the clues started to become more evident..
<br />blame started to be cast on kings,prime ministers and presidents..
<br />seemed it takes great global change for these things to get presidence
<br />..
<br />all this time i been biding my time,readying for this moment..
<br />crisis times throughout this round rock,the mostly unseen omens..
<br />the world is evolving,not dieing,is what they all need to know..
<br />and humans are survivors we can always continue if we grow..
<br />with this planet not on it and over it..
<br />this place drunk on power and money,with noone to sober it..
<br /><br />these are the thoughts  and memories running through my mind..
<br />as i smell and taste smoke in my lungs nose and my eyes..
<br />the aftermath,of mans hunger for great technology..
<br />try'd to turn it all around to late,mother nature not acceptin the apology..
<br />she fought back and punished us all for not reading the signs..
<br />while her once &quot;a breath fresh air&quot; your breathin inside,,
<br />while leavin a planet bleeding inside..
<br />this is the reason to why,it released its demon inside..
<br />some sort of backlash happening throughout the universe..
<br />some worlds were beyond us,u'd think the humans were worse..
<br />this turmoil,causing the whole of space to partake in a astronomical event..
<br />destruction of the universe as we know it..desomation and torment..
<br />here i stand,barely scared,as her hand,expands and releases the harsh grasp..
<br />ilook in the almost empty black sky,and shed a tear, as i stare at the last star..
<br /><br />i still stand for i am not of this place,just a spectator..
<br />the living gambling with lives,leave em suffer and collect the debts later..
<br />and let that favour also be owing,i died for u all once this time im not going..
<br />its evolution,and judgement time all wrapped up into something major..
<br />yes ok this IS the comming of the savior,gods son,dont think im comming to save ya..
<br />your life u did not savour..it was abused,
<br />its said to be a game,and im affraid u's fukas lose..
<br />cause now im &quot;dancin with the devil, while god watches from the clouds&quot;..
<br />deaths chances are trebled,now this prophet gets watched by a proud..
<br />father,while teaming up with the devil,working together..
<br />with a skeme perfectly clever,to start again for worse or for better..
<br />this time we will program these earthlings better,fix the glitches..
<br />change all the scriptures,and pictures, in their minds of the true history..
<br />must once again leave it a mystery,as we have done before so shift-ly..
<br />they didnt know we had done in,over and over,just havent got it right..
<br />yes its true we make mistakes even under the heavens godly light..
<br />&quot;climate change&quot; is just us speeding up the process..
<br />just the god blessed,speaking his mind to confess..
<br />the complex,means to lead this world to progress..
<br />compressed is how i feel with this weight on my shoulders..
<br />still a pain in my heart and a tear in my eye as this place smolders..

<br />Sitting in darkness and..the only light,
<br />is a lighter,that sparks in his hand..
<br />He's the driver,that parks in a dark van..
<br />In an alley,car park or dimly lit,side of the street..
<br />Lurking in shadows,at any time,every,night of the week..
<br />If told its your time to die,then u will find of who I speak..
<br />As it unfolds b4 eyes,they realize other ways,2 perspire from heat..
<br /><br />&quot;Stress'n'scream,then panic'n'collapse,
<br />grovel and cry,confess at my blessard feet&quot;..
<br />&quot;Guess'n'ME as satanic?&quot;,&quot;perhaps,
<br />&amp; gods'balance am I?&quot;,&quot;yes&quot;..&quot;That is my destiny&quot;..
<br />&quot;Rest my piece,on the head'n'chant a verse,so they can rest in peace&quot;..
<br />&quot;Then i speak,tell them&quot;.&quot;MaKe WoRtH wHiLe,Of ThE lAsT bReAtHs U bReAtH!!&quot;..
<br />&quot;Many start to pray,when these words of mine s'blunt message'is'received&quot;..
<br />&quot;In a very calm display,at the perfect time a thrust of heavenly feats&quot;.. 
<br /><br />An enlightened assassin,striking in a righteous like fashion..
<br />Resight a bibled passage'n,tighten the right index a fraction..
<br />Trigger finger always itchy,so deeply in need of a scracth'n..
<br />This grave digger always shifty,go's reaping,this being a passion..
<br />His whole purpose,his only reason to keep on board'n'living..
<br />Surface,like a summoned demon,to teach a different form of forgiving..
<br />Or for that matter,expell living hell when the punishments'served..
<br />Their thoughts scatter,the dwelling shell in the gun is disturbed..
<br /><br />Both extremes,either end broken dreams..It can land both ways..
<br />A man with no face,scan'n landscapes,understand theres no escape..
<br />If u are the chosen,make no mistake,his objective,its all crystal clear..
<br />Even if the fog dont lift'n'the mist wont clear the pistol,it still stears..
<br />Hollow points,that make some holy points,after a time,anointed in holy water..
<br />For the sole and whole point ment,devine oint-ment,to get your soul in order..
<br />Murdering for eternity,but never't'be, held responsible for these unearthly deeds..
<br />Just a servant u see,doing the boss's dirty deeds,these jobs are not concerning D..
<br /><br />For death,has his own vision in his head,
<br />incision with precision,but he escaped the sickle..
<br />Now instead,his ammunition is dipped lead,
<br />only 1 decision in this possition'n'its plated in nickle..
<br /><br />&quot;Another learns,they're sent to land imursed in heaven&quot;..
<br />&quot;Another burns,wear'n a pentagram'n'worshiping the devil&quot;..
<br />&quot;See i work on the level without&quot;.&quot;One solitary sin 4 them 2 begin'ta'speak'a&quot;..

<br /><br />deep inside my phsyce,these demons inside are fighting..
<br />with weeping eyes frightened,i scream and cry nightly..
<br />in my dreams so it seems,im biting,feeding on others..
<br />bleeding ones lovers,then retreating to darkness'covers..
<br />thought to be just nightmares,but think i was mistaken..
<br />fight the truth cause it might scare,and leave me forsaken..
<br />refusing to believe,the real truth within my dreams..
<br />not persueing any leads,leave it brewin within me ..
<br />stewing while living, a normal life in the day..
<br />normal wife and a babe,feel it inside as the light it fades..
<br /><br />the pain of the sunlight these days,feels like its blades..
<br />peircing my skin,with faden sun rays,the pain it escapes..
<br />my being,am i really living what my dreaming mind is seeing..
<br />i cant be,so artfully doing these gastly deeds,high im pleaing..
<br />to the gods to free me,from waking day break'n im screaming..
<br />shaken and breathing, deeply,a metalic taste it is weakening..
<br />got me thinkin things,i dont wish to even comprehend..
<br />the type of offencive,that even if u wish u cant defend..
<br />carnal and bloodthirsty,thats how they always play out..
<br />always thought as heresay when the neibours say i stray out..
<br />every evening and return just before the dawn of the sun..
<br />with clothes torn as i run,always just thought it was some..
<br />rumours,set to tear me and my family apart at the seems..
<br />make me no longer part of the team,scar'n the heart of me..
<br /><br />after weeks, of these same sort of silly speculations..
<br />and the fact that their was a local killing esculation..
<br />i started to wonder,if i dont even slumber at night..
<br />its the one thats inside, that comes to my life..
<br />and takes over,and makes me partake in his pleasure..
<br />his  leisure,day break is the only time i got his measure..
<br />why are these scenes i see,playing out like they are visions..
<br />when in truth at high moon,not noon i slay on these missions..
<br />another day another goes missing,population is dwindling..
<br />another night another mystery,a hot sensation like kindling..
<br />spreads through my veins again,time to mame again..
<br />then await the next day again,and recieve the blame again..
<br />from this community,to whom the evidence is crystal clear..
<br />finish this here , to bring back our towns bliss and cheer..
<br />no clues missing here, thats why they came to the conclusion..
<br />they would proove the facts,do away with the illusion..
<br />i had made without knowing,yet their hate is still growing..
<br />they contemplate to kill slowly,till my true face started showing..
<br />as shadows comsume the light,with their sight they see it happen..
<br />on all hallows this gloomy night,not the night to be scrapping..
<br />for this was the one night my powers are at the fullest..
<br />not even a silver bullet,can slow down what this werewolf is..
<br />about to release on these,soon to be casualties,the building rage..
<br />decease and sease,this mob,doom each with ease,its my will by this stage..
<br />for the transformation was complete,time for devistation as this beast..
<br />instead of maken an escape,its my fate  to break u and make u bleed..
<br />once again day break,these nightmares fade away,i rise crying as i wake..
<br />the sky is grey,like i took a razor blade,to the lieing guys that remain..
<br />my eyes again break,into a lil stream of tears...
<br />the scene im see'n,makes a reality of my fears..........................

<br />force of sword brandishing,hoards of manic beings..
<br />covered in dark armour,with sharp arms for harm'n the..
<br />armies march'n far,with archers armed,all charge'n hard..
<br />not knowing the real enemy,they race and roar towards..
<br />the truth showing eventually,when they face hell born forms..
<br />as they rise over hills,soldiers eyes glaze over and fill..
<br />with tears of fear or rage,knowing they will die or be killed..
<br />a fire it fills,inside,inspires there will,to survive by any means..
<br />fight and take the lives of many phenes,in a time of insanity..
<br /><br />foolish commanders start assuming an upper hand..
<br />they didnt realize,someone had sommoned the damned..
<br />would have been smarter to just run while they can..
<br />not wait for arrows to dart'n'blood to run on the land..
<br />free'd by striking swords,warhammers,axes and spears..
<br />even the mighty cores of warhardened,felt actual fear..
<br />their only action was clear,it was to battle til dead..
<br />time for exaction was near,amongst the scatter of red..
<br />all caused by these dark knights on their dark horses..
<br />master in their art swordsmen,that fight for dark forces..
<br />swords spark,if not for that and small fires,it'd all be dark..
<br />another violent swipe,another body and its limb fall apart..
<br />total disregard for these weaker creatures,the human race..
<br />as the moon it drapes,its dim light to consume this place..
<br /><br />one looks up to view the face of his enemy..
<br />to not see a face but a dark energy entity..
<br />how do they defeat something that doesnt bleed..
<br />on hate it eats,turns to dust if it doesnt feed..
<br />this fact this company just doesnt see,their blinded..
<br />they need to see the light,look right inside and find it..
<br />then the tide it,might shift'n'change in their favour..
<br />their only savior,is the mind,not the blade of a sabre..
<br /><br />in amist of all the,releasing of insides'n'gizzards..
<br />out of the mist formed,regally in rides the wizards..
<br />adorned with staffs,here to settle the score at last..
<br />transform to sword grass,every sword being grasped..
<br />turning every weapon darkness had,into something harmless..
<br />now these great warriors of evil, are suddenly armless..
<br />next the wizards turned the armours innards to flesh..
<br />inturn discard their armour,left with imminant death..
<br />as each satanic beast,takes its first deep organic breath..
<br />creaping panic sets..
<br />in right as they feel the cold steel of a sword in the chest..
<br /><br />needless to say,as soon as the plane,received the days sunny rays..
<br />defeat was the game,the moon has escaped,the beasts lay'bloody'n'slain..
<br /><br />belated pain..comes to the ones that remain..

<br />saved..by wizard magicians to discover the brain,

<br />only if u decide to invite'n'bring,
<br />the mind to the fight,u might just win&quot;..
<br /><br />these are the words one from the fight was writing in,
<br /><br />his half torched and torn journal,with an almost empty ink well..
<br />he thinks&quot;oh well&quot;for the journey,had almost ended'n'hes'well..
<br />thought he'd be slaughtered,in the heat of a conflict..
<br />but he sits covered in blood,barely a cut,and hes not sick..
<br />he was a strong believer of the pagan gods,and knew for certain..
<br />that the only reason they got through,his prays come true,they were workin..
<br />for the magic men,that did decend apon these demons..

<br /><br />~Based on a true story of C.Haizmann.A Bavarian artist from the 17th century~
<br /><br />Christoph Haizmann began,just a humble artist..
<br />it was his curiousity with witchcraft'which,
<br />was the one thing that would start'this..
<br />if god has not bestowed this,
<br />then the answer was,the prince of darkness..
<br />so in his own blood the pact was signed..
<br />4 in his mind,magics'attraction had climbed..
<br />this was enough for a while,but he yearned for more..
<br />and influence came easy,from a observant dark lord..
<br />so he re-signed another sale agreement..once again,
<br />to have more power with witchery,but all comes to'an'end..
<br />the statement,in the pact he wrote in crimson stated..
<br /><br />&quot;I sell myself to this here Satan,to be his own bodily son,
<br /> in the ninth year,belong to him in both body'n'soul&quot;..
<br /><br />after that it was fine for some time,he was free to..
<br />practice occult acts and study arkane arts of evil..
<br />then as the years passed,and d-day drew much closer..
