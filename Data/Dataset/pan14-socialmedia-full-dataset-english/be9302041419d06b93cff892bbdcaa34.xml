<br />some friends one
<br />evening
<br />and time passed quickly as each shared
<br />their
<br />various experiences of the past year.
<br /><br />She ended up staying longer than
<br />planned,
<br />and
<br />had to walk home alone. She wasn't
<br />afraid
<br />because it was a small town and she lived
<br />only
<br />a
<br />few blocks away.
<br /><br />As she walked along under the tall elm
<br />trees,
<br />Diane asked God to keep her safe from
<br />harm
<br />and
<br />danger.
<br /><br />When she reached the alley, which was a
<br />short
<br />cut to her house, she decided to take it.
<br /><br />However, halfway down the alley she
<br />noticed
<br />a
<br />man standing at the end as though he
<br />were
<br />waiting
<br />for her.
<br /><br />She became uneasy and began to pray,
<br />asking
<br />for
<br />God's protection.
<br /><br />Instantly a comforting feeling of quietness
<br />and
<br />security wrapped round her, she felt as
<br />though
<br />someone was walking with her.
<br /><br />When she reached the end of the alley,
<br />she
<br />walked right past the man and arrived
<br />home
<br />safely.
<br /><br />The following day, she read in the
<br />newspaper
<br />that
<br />a young girl had been raped in the same
<br />alley
<br />just
<br />twenty minutes after she had been there.
<br /><br />Feeling overwhelmed by this tragedy and
<br />the
<br />fact
<br />that it could have been her, she began to
<br />weep.
<br /><br />Thanking the Lord for her safety and to
<br />help
<br />this
<br />young woman, she decided to go to the
<br />police
<br />station.
<br /><br />She felt she could recognize the man, so
<br />she
<br />told
<br />them her story.
<br /><br />The police asked her if she would be
<br />willing to
<br />look
<br />at a lineup to see if she could identify
<br />him.
<br /><br />She agreed and immediately pointed out
<br />the
<br />man
<br />she had seen in the alley the night
<br />before.
<br /><br />When the man was told he had been
<br />identified,
<br />he
<br />immediately broke down and confessed.
<br /><br />The officer thanked Diane for her bravery
<br />and
<br />asked if there was anything they could do
<br />for
<br />her.
<br /><br />She asked if they would ask the man one
<br />question.
<br /><br />Diane was curious as to why he had not
<br />attacked
<br />her.
<br /><br />When the policeman asked him, he
<br />answered, &quot;Because she wasn't alone.
<br />She
<br />had
<br />two tall men walking on either side of
<br />her.&quot;
<br /><br />Amazingly, whether you believe or not,
<br />you're
<br />never alone. Did you know that 98% of
<br />teenagers
<br />will not stand up for God?
<br /><br />Repost this as Love vs. Sex if you truly
<br />believe
<br />in
<br />God..,
<br /><br />PS: God is always there in your heart and loves you no matter what.....and if you stand up 4 him he will stand up for you.
<br /><br />I bet 93% of you people that read this wont repost it
