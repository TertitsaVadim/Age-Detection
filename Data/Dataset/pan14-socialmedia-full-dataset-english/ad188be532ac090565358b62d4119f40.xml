He found programming software to be extremely interesting to him and itmotivated him to do more. Through that, it gave him the experience to set up Microsoft.</p><p>If you want to become a success like Bill Gates, don’t chase the dollar sign. Don’t go to opportunity afteropportunity trying to find which one makes you the top dollar. This will only cause you to lose focus on whatyou want for your own life and set you up for a big fall.<a href="http://www.cheapmbtshoesmbtsale.com/">MBT Shoes Sale</a> Money is everywhere and there are many ways you can make it; the more important thing is that you followyour passion. Money will find you naturally.</p><p>Giving back to the community is an important act because it is a reflection of your character. Are you agiver or a taker? Do you exist in this world to become a blessing to the community, or do you expect thecommunity you’re in to bless you?The attitude that you adopt in this will determine if you will become a person of success or a person ofsignificance. <a href="http://www.cheapmbtshoesmbtsale.com/">MBT UK</a> There are a lot of people who are successful, but few names are remember through time. Theones that we remember even till today are those that made a difference in the world that we lived in.</p><p>If you want to become a leader that people admire and respect, you must become a person of significance.People don’t follow you because you take from them; they follow you because you give to them.<a href="http://www.cheapmbtshoesmbtsale.com/">MBT Australia</a> Strive to live out a life that makes a difference in this world; give back more than what you’ve taken fromsociety. Your life then will be a true success.</p><p>“Read books on topics that don’t pertain strictly to your business or industry. It’s the best way to maintain abroad perspective.” Leaders need to open up broad channels of input; you need to assess what otherindustries are doing as they impact yours. Microsoft did not attain its level of success by forgetting abouttheir customers were doing. <a href="http://www.cheapmbtshoesmbtsale.com/">MBT USA</a> Their customers were small and medium businesses in healthcare,government, finance, and “mom and pop” shops, etc. All these other industries are intertwined with all therest of the world.<a href="http://www.cheapmbtshoesmbtsale.com/">MBT Outlet</a>“Stop at the end of each day to analyze how well you used it. If you wasted time on things you didn’t need todo, eliminate them tomorrow.” Just imagine how much more efficient and effective you will be!</p><p>A leader should have the vision and that too an impeccable one. He should be able to see what might lieahead in times to come. Bill Gates could “see” that the future of computers was in the software, not in thehardware. This made things easy for him as he now had well-defined targets to chase. According to Gates,most successful people have had a vision which has enabled them to make it out big in the world. <a href="http://www.cheapmbtshoesmbtsale.com/">Cheap MBT</a> A leadersans vision soon loses team and goes out of the race.</p><p><a href="http://www.cheapmbtshoesmbtsale.com/">http://www.cheapmbtshoesmbtsale.com/</a></p>;

President Theodore (Teddy) Roosevelt,for example, believed that you should always “Speak softly and carry a big stick”. Whilst this may not be themost positive fall-back position to have in life, it did serve him, and his nation, well when the tough timescame. A more positive example is, believe it or not, Justin Bieber.<a href="http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/">Shoes Mbt</a> In 2011 he released a film about hisconcert tour called ‘Never Say Never’, which reflects his view on life. Whilst you might argue that the youngMr Bieber is not the most intellectually challenging of individuals either on stage or off, you certainly can’targue that in his world he has had significant success and he attributes his own success to his mantra.</p><p>So what are the key components to these types of sayings? <a href="http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/">Mbt Sale</a> After twenty years of informal research in thisarea I have come up with the following four core characteristics:</p><p>When you are at your lowest ebb, you have to be able to apply it in a meaningful way. It might be that youneed to motivate yourself or a team that have their backs to the wall. It might be that you have to have adifficult conversation with a colleague or a loved one. <a href="http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/">MBT Shoes Sale</a> Regardless of the situation it will give you theresolution to get through it as best you can. At the opposite end of the scale you may be beingoverwhelmed by an exciting opportunity. At times like this your mantra has to be capable of keeping you onthe right track and making the most of the chance that has presented itself to you.</p><p>If the first characteristic is important, the second is critical. If your mantra is going to be used in toughsituations you need to be able to choose the appropriate response in each situation. A saying that locks youinto only ever taking one form of action or responding in one highly prescribed way will, at some criticalpoint, let you down.</p><p>Though it may sound like I’m stating the obvious, there may be several statements that could be applied byyou. Often the reason for one statement resonanting with you more than any other is because it touchessome deep-rooted emotion or feeling within you.<a href="http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/">MBT UK</a> It might be that a loved one or someone you have hugerespect for epitomises the statement. Or it might be that you feel that it keeps you on the right track. Theunderlying reason will always be that it makes you feel that you are a better person for sticking to it.</p><p>There have been many academic and medical studies that have shown that when someone is highlystressed they can forget the most basic facts and information. So whatever you choose as your mantra youneed to be able to bring it, and what it means to you, quickly and easily to mind. <a href="http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/">MBT Outlet</a> Building on the thirdcharacteristic, the stronger the bond that you have with it, the more quickly and easily it will come to mind.</p><p>As you can imagine, in my work as a professional speaker I draw upon this research. I am often asked aboutthe mantras that people have shared with me and the meaning behind them. After twenty years I have quitea few of them stored away in my head. For easy recall I reduce each saying to a simple ‘formula’. Each ofthese formulas is stacked in a ‘cardex’ in my memory. <a href="http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/">Discount MBT</a> I simply run through them visualising each in turn untilthe right one for the situation comes to the front.</p><p>I asked Erin Falconer, Editor in Chief of Pick The Brain if she had a life mantra. I wasn’t surprised when, likeother successful people, she told me she did have one. She told me that hers was “If not me, who, if notnow, when?”</p><p>I’m assuming that you read blogs like this because you want to improve and develop yourself. <a href="http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/">Cheap MBT</a> If you haven’tgot a statement or mantra that you can call upon in tough times to keep you on track and get to whateveryour version of success looks like, my advice would be figure out what yours is and start using it ASAP.</p><p><a href="http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/">http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/</a></p>;

There’s a big difference between giving up and startingover in the right direction. And there are three little words that can release you from your past regrets andguide you forward to a positive new beginning. <a href="http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/">MBT Shoes</a>&#160; Most things are only a part of your life because you keepthinking about them. Positive things happen in your life when you emotionally distance yourself from thenegative things. So stop holding on to what hurts, and make room for what feels right. Do not let what is outof your control interfere with all the things you can control. Read The Success Principles.</p><p>Life is simple.<a href="http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/">Shoes Mbt</a> Everything happens for you, not to you. Everythinghappens at exactly the right moment, neither too soon nor too late. For everything you lose, you gainsomething else; and for everything you gain, you lose something else. You don’t have to like it, but it’s justeasier if you do. So pay attention to your outlook on life. You can either regret or rejoice; it’s your choice.</p><p>Change is like breath – it isn’t part of the process, it is the process. <a href="http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/">Mbt Sale</a> In reality theonly thing we can count on is change. And the first step toward positive change is to change your outlook.Prepare for the positive. Prepare for the new. Allow the unknown to take you to fresh and unforeseen areasin yourself. Growth is impossible without change. If you cannot change your mind, you cannot changeanything in your life. Sometimes all you need to do is look at things from a different perspective.</p><p>When life’s struggles knock you into a pit so deep you can’t seeanything but darkness, don’t waste valuable energy trying to dig your way out. Because if you hastily dig inthe dark, you’re likely to head in the wrong direction and only dig the pit deeper. <a href="http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/">MBT Shoes Sale</a> Instead, use what energyyou have to reach out and pull something good in with you. For goodness is bright; its radiance will showyou which way is up, and illuminate the correct path that will take you there. Read Learned Optimism.</p><p>Strength isn’t about bearing a cross of grief or shame. <a href="http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/">MBT UK</a> Strength is about choosingyour path, living with the consequences, and learning from them. Sometimes you do your best and end upwith a mess. When this happens, don’t be discouraged. You tried. That’s really all you can ever do. Youhave not failed; you just learned what not to do. So rest, regroup, and begin again with what you now know.</p><p>Making a big life change or trying something new can be scary. But do you know what’seven scarier? Regret. <a href="http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/">MBT Outlet</a> So realize that most of your fears are much bigger in your mind than they are inreality; you’ll see this for yourself as soon as you face them. Don’t let them stop you. Live your life so thatyou never have to regret the chances you never took, the love you never let in, and the gifts you nevergave out. Read The Magic of Thinking Big.</p><p>Every person who is at the top of the mountain did not fall there from the sky. <a href="http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/">Discount MBT</a> Goodthings come to those who work for them. You gain confidence and grow stronger by every experience inwhich you truly push yourself to do something you didn’t think you could do. If you are standing in that placeof in-between, unable or unwilling to go backwards, but too afraid to move forward, remember that you can’tenjoy the view without being willing to climb.</p><p>Nothing is more beautiful and powerful than a smile that hasstruggled through the tears. Don’t regret your time, even the moments that were filled with hurt. Smilebecause you learned from it and gained the strength to rise above it. <a href="http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/">Cheap MBT</a> In the end, it’s not what you have beenthrough that defines who you are; it’s how you got through it that has made you the person you are today,and the person you are capable of being tomorrow.</p><p>Nothing is ever wrong. We learn from every step we take.Whatever you did today was a necessary step to get to tomorrow. So be proud of yourself. Maybe you arenot as good as you want to be, or as great as you one day will be; but thanks to all the lessons you’velearned along the way, you are so much better than you used to be.</p><p><a href="http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/">http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/</a></p>;

It’s 9:08AM.You’re already bored, and you wonder painfully how you are going to make it through the next eight hourswithout jabbing a pen in your eyes. Tick tock.</p><p>Your check your e-mail, then your Facebook account. <a href="http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/">MBT Shoes</a> You return a phone call and look at some paperworkon your desk. You steal another look at the time. 9:21. Tick tock.</p><p>You go to the kitchen and fill up your water bottle. Sipping slowly, you stop by the printer to see if you forgotto pick up anything the day before. You return to your desk and see the open word document on yourdesktop. <a href="http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/">Shoes Mbt</a> It’s your Q2 strategic plan, and you’re dreading finishing it. The clock now says 9:36. Only 7 hoursand 24 minutes until you can put on your jacket and high-tail out of there. Tick tock, tick tock.</p><p>Watching the clock is a terrible way to spend your life. <a href="http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/">Mbt Sale</a> We all do it to some extent – after all, not every work-related task makes us jump for joy (that’s why it’s called work, not fun). But putting yourself in a situationwhere you are waiting for every minute to pass is a surefire way to drive yourself crazy and/or give yourselfstress-induced hypertension.</p><p>A former colleague told me that AOL prevented clock-watching by forcing employees to stop wearingwatches and to hide the time display on their computers and devices. I don’t think this is the answer. Theresponsibility to stop clock-watching is yours alone, so here are some tips to banish this infuriating habitfrom your work day.</p><p>Remember why you took this job in the first place? What were you trying to accomplish with your career, andwhy were you excited to work for this particular organization? <a href="http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/">MBT Shoes Sale</a> Jot down your thoughts and consider how youcan fulfill some of these initial objectives within the context of the daily grind.</p><p>Roll your eyes if you will, but it works.&#160; If you smile and act like you’re enjoying what you’re doing, sometimesyour mind will forget about the reality and the day will pass more quickly.</p><p>For a few years, groupwork was all the rage at American business schools, and you can bet those guysweren’t bored in class. Pull together a task force to accomplish a critical business objective and schedule aninteractive brainstorming series that will take you away from your desk a few times a week.</p><p>Tell yourself that you can watch the clock or surf the net as much as you want, as long as you write a 500word brief or make 5 sales calls before you do. By giving yourself a tight deadline to accomplish a task, youinsist on a longer period of concentration. <a href="http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/">MBT Outlet</a> You can take this up a notch by scheduling several in-depth tasksfor the same day since nothing beats clock-watching like being incredibly busy.</p><p>We’ve talked before about how everyone has a time during the day when energy naturally flags. When thisperiod comes around for you, arrange to do something away from your desk to prevent bleary-eyed clockstaring. <a href="http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/">Discount MBT</a> Hit the gym, have a catch-up lunch in the cafeteria, or run an errand.</p><p>Now let’s be real here. Even while employing these strategies, you will still look at the clock from time to time.However, if you do everything you can to stay engaged, you might forget it’s even there.<a href="http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/">Cheap MBT</a></p><p><a href="http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/">http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/</a></p>;

Too many days are wasted comparing ourselves to others and wishingto be something we aren’t. Everybody has their own strengths and weaknesses, and it is only when youaccept everything you are, and aren’t, that you will truly find happiness and success. Read The Road LessTraveled.</p><p>Sometimes the way you think about a person isn’t theway they are. On the outside, maybe they laugh, and maybe they cry; but you would be surprised ateverything they keep deep inside. So pay close attention, and love the people you care about for who theyare, and not for who you want them to be. In the long run, this is how you will get the best of them.Open your mind before you open your mouth.<a href="http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/">Shoes Mbt</a> Don’t mix bad words with a bad mood. Just be calm and deal with your emotions. You’ll have manyopportunities to change your mood, but you’ll have an extremely tough time recovering the words you havespoken.</p><p>Wait, what did you just say to yourself? Were theythe inspiring, comforting words you would speak to a friend? Or were they the belittling remarks you mightshout to an enemy if you had no heart. <a href="http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/">Mbt Sale</a> Or the negative assessments about life you would utter if you had nofaith? All day long we speak silently to ourselves, and a part of us believes every word. So stay mindful, andask yourself, “If I had a friend who always spoke to me in the same way that I am speaking to myself rightnow, how long would I allow that person to be my friend?”</p><p>I hate to break it to you, but you can’t control everything inyour life no matter how many safeguards you put into place. But thankfully, you don’t have to controleverything to find peace and happiness. It lives with you always, deep within. <a href="http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/">MBT Shoes Sale</a> More than getting into thenuances of control itself, you should be more interested in encouraging yourself to commit to giving it up, onpurpose. See what happens when you loosen your grip, throw your hands into the air, and allow life to justhappen and flow as it does, without constant micromanagement. Read The Power of Now.</p><p>Positive minds live positive lives. There is always,always something to be thankful for and something to smile about. The happiest people are not those whoget everything they want; <a href="http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/">MBT UK</a> they are those who, while in pursuit of worthy goals, notice and appreciate thebeauty and sweetness of everyday moments.</p><p>What comes easy won’t always last, and what will last won’t alwayscome easy. So do the right things, not the easy things. Whatever comes your way, whatever battle is raginginside you, you always have a choice. In the end, it’s the choices you make that make you who you are. <a href="http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/">MBT Outlet</a> Andno matter what, you can always choose to do the right thing.</p><p>You can be stunned, awakened, and changed by what happens toyou, but choose to grow from it, and refuse to be reduced by it. Repeat after me: “I am determined to live ahappy life no matter my challenges. I will turn all my tales of fury into tales of glory. I will turn all of my tales ofwoe into tales of WOW!”</p><p>The most common way people give up their power is by thinkingthey don’t have any. In a world filled with doubt, you must dare to dream. In a world filled with anger, youmust dare to forgive. In a world filled with hate, you must dare to love. <a href="http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/">Discount MBT</a> In a world filled with distrust, you mustdare to believe. And once you do, you will find that power you once thought you lacked.</p><p>Life is too short to live with regrets. So love thethings that make you smile, let go of the things that make you cry, and believe that everything happens for areason. Follow the path that your heart longs to take; it’s your time to shine. If you get a chance, take it. If itchanges your life, let it. You are far from what you once were, but not yet who you are going to be. ReadThe Last Lecture.</p><p>Some people frantically seek a predetermineddefinition of success as though their entire self-worth depends on whether or not they make it to the top.<a href="http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/">Cheap MBT Shoes</a> Their goals and routines are wound tight around stringent routines that they repeat every single day withoutstopping to breathe. And while discipline is important, think about how much better off they’d be if theyunwound their vision just a little – like kite string – and ran with it like an optimistic youth, breathing andworking, just for the joy of seeing if they can make it touch the clouds.</p><p><a href="http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/">http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/</a></p>;

Upcycling is the processof putting together something new by using oldmaterials you might otherwise throw away. Doing thisnot only reuses an old item, but reduces both whatgoes into the landfill and what you might otherwisepurchase.</p><p>This is one of my favorites. It works by taking old glass bottles and turning them into a raised display for realor silk flowers. You could really put anything in there that you would like to show off as long as it fits into astandard-size jar. <a href="http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/">Shoes Mbt</a> If you wanted to do a larger one, you could try a wine bottle. However, keep in mind thatthe larger the bottle is, the harder it might be to balance it properly. Also, you could paint the paper cover ifyou wanted to, though I like the way the text print looks.</p><p>I see those bulky wooden frames at thrift stores all the time, and I think they look awful. Presumably, so doeseveryone else based on how often the things are tossed to secondhand stores, still with the original storepicture underneath.<a href="http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/">Mbt Sale</a> But this upcycle idea makes them much more attractive. Plus, it is a good way to get ridof all those empty gift and business cards you have probably seen add up since the end of the holidays.You just cut them up into small squares (or other shapes), and you paste them to the outside of the frame inwhatever pattern you like. The multitude of colors, pictures, and icons make it a great piece.</p><p>Wine drinkers tend to be regular partakers of the beverage. That isn’t surprising, given the health benefitsalong with the acquired taste of the different styles. If you are a heavy drinker, you might be wondering whatto do with what is left over once the drinks are gone. We already showed something you could do with thebottles, and there is another suggestion below. <a href="http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/">MBT Shoes Sale</a> But, what about the corks? If you like, you can gather themtogether and create this cool bulletin board. Don’t drink much wine? No worries, you can help a local bar orrestaurant upcycle by asking them to keep the used corks for you for one night. Many will oblige.</p><p>Many of us are old enough to remember what it was like to buy a new record and put it on the player, feelingthat excitement as we lowered the needle and the scratching sound of it finding the groove began justbefore the music itself. <a href="http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/">MBT UK</a> Others might not know the experience firsthand, but at least have a few records instorage that used to belong to someone else, or maybe you just saw a few at a secondhand store or fleamarker. Either way, you can use a thick cord to bind them into a trendy-looking box to keep anything in.</p><p>This is a great one. You take a few pages from a magazine and roll them up nice and tight. You can use asimple paste to bind the shape and then attach them to the outside of any mirror. <a href="http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/">MBT Shoes Sale UK</a> It makes a cool effectsimilar to a sun or star. You can also create other shapes and patterns using the same technique.</p><p>Great for a child’s room and possible to adapt into other animals or patterns, this cute little box is very easyto make. Plastic bottles are easy to come by in different sizes, so they work well for jewelry, hair ties and anumber of other items. You can even create some for your desk or craft room, if you have one. A friend ofmine made one for her desk at work in the shape of a monkey, and she gets comments on it all the time.Some coworkers even requested she make some for them.</p><p>This lamp is really cool. Because it uses simple transparency paper, you can make any image you like.Literally, the sky is the limit. <a href="http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/">MBT Shoes UK</a> If it seems a little complicated, you can actually find nice little kits that give youeverything you need to make lamps out of anything.

This bloggershows you exactly how to do it, all the way back to buying one off of eBay to adapt. You can keep real fishinside or make a fake one. You would be surprised by how simple the whole process actually is. You canalso do it with old television sets, which is pretty cool, especially since TVs are becoming some of the mostcommonly thrown out electronics to pollute landfills.</p><p>You don’t have to be a craft genius to upcycle creatively.<a href="http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/">Cheap MBT Shoes</a> Each one of the above ideas is perfect for thebeginner or even the hopeless.

In fact, many of us will go to great lengths to avoid the feeling of beingalone in an undistracted environment. <a href="http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/">Shoes Mbt</a> So we succumb to hanging-out with just about anybody to avoid thefeeling of solitude. For being alone means dealing with our true feelings: fear, anxiety, happiness, anger,joy, resentment, disappointment, anticipation, sadness, excitement, despair, and so on and so forth.</p><p>And it doesn’t really matter if our feelings are positive or negative – they are overwhelming and exhausting,and so we prefer to numb ourselves to them. The bottom line is that every one of us is an addict, and whatwe are addicted to is avoiding ourselves. Acknowledging this addiction is the first step to healing it. <a href="http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/">Mbt Sale</a> So begintoday by just noticing with curiosity, and without judgment, all of the ways in which you avoid being in yourown skin, right here, right now, in this present moment we call life.</p><p>If you feel anxious because you constantly feel like you’re missing out onsomething happening somewhere else, you’re not alone. We all feel this way sometimes. But let me assureyou, you could run around trying to do everything, and travel around the world, and always stay connected,and work and party all night long without sleep, but you could never do it all. You will always be missingsomething. <a href="http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/">MBT Shoes Sale</a> So let it go, and realize you have everything right now. The best in life isn’t somewhere else; it’sright where you are, at this moment. Celebrate the perhaps not altogether insignificant fact that you arealive right now. This moment, and who you are, is absolutely perfect. Take a deep breath, smile, and noticehow lovely it is. Read The Power of Now.</p><p>Not to spoil the ending for you, but everything is going to be OK – you justneed to learn a lesson or two first. <a href="http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/">MBT Shoes Sale UK</a> Don’t run from the realities of the present moment. The pain and defeatcontained within is necessary to your long-term growth. Remember, there is a difference betweenencountering defeats and being defeated. Nothing ever goes away until it teaches you what you need toknow, so you can move on to the next step.</p><p>Some of us spend the vast majority of our lives recountingpast memories, and letting them steer the course of the present. Don’t waste your time trying to live inanother time and place. Let the past, go. You must accept the end of something in order to begin to buildsomething new. <a href="http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/">MBT Shoes UK</a> So close some old doors today. Not because of pride, inability or egotism, but simplybecause you’ve entered each one of them in the past and realize that they lead to nowhere.</p><p>If we continue to repeat a story in our head, we eventually believethat story and embrace it – whether it empowers us or not. So the question is: Does your story empoweryou? <a href="http://canadagoosejacketsaleoutlet.com/">Canada Goose Jackets</a> Don’t place your mistakes on your mind, their weight may crush your current potential. Instead, placethem under your feet and use them as a platform to view the horizon. Remember, all things are difficultbefore they are easy. What matters the most is what you start doing now. Read Awaken the Giant Within.</p><p>What often screws us up the most in life isthe picture in our head of how it’s supposed to be. <a href="http://canadagoosejacketsaleoutlet.com/">Canada Goose</a> Although every good thing has an end, in life everyending is just a new beginning. Life goes on – not always the way we had envisioned it would be, but alwaysthe way it’s supposed to be. Remember, we usually can’t choose the music life plays for us, but we canchoose how we dance to it. Read The Last Lecture.</p><p>Don’t be too hard on yourself. There are plenty of peoplewilling to do that for you. Do your best and surrender the rest. Tell yourself, “I am doing the best I can withwhat I have in this moment. And that is all I can expect of anyone, including me.” <a href="http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/">Cheap MBT Shoes</a> Love yourself and be proudof everything that you do, even your mistakes. Because even mistakes mean you’re trying.</p><p><a href="http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/">http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/</a></p>;

Read The Mastery of Love.</p><p>You will never get ahead of anyone as long as you try toget even with them. Sometimes we don’t forgive people because they deserve it. We forgive them becausethey need it, because we need it, and because we cannot move forward without it. To forgive is torediscover the inner peace and purpose that at first you thought someone took away when they betrayedyou.So if you want it, reflect it.

I have often spokenwith people who are feeling much like this caller was.</p><p>The gentleman's adult son had died in an accident,and when I innocently asked how old his son was, hebristled and told me the question offended him. Hesaid it didn't matter how old the person was whodied; the question created barriers and suggesteddifferent degrees of grieving. I apologized and explained that I hadn't meant it that way. <a href="http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/">Shoes Mbt</a> My intention had been to open the door toconversation, to invite him to speak freely about his son if he wanted to, without any pressure to do so if hewere uncomfortable.</p><p>When we are newly bereaved, and sometimes even a long time into our grief, we often find ourselvesthrashing about emotionally. In frenetic efforts to escape some of our pain, we may react blindly, wildly,irrationally. We sometimes say and do things that may be embarrassing to us later. <a href="http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/">Mbt Sale</a> But we need make noapologies, ever, for our emotional reactions to suffering that is so unimaginable.</p><p>We, the bereaved, are desperately trying to tell those who would comfort us what we need and how to helpus. The trouble is that often we haven't figured out what we need, and we don't know what will help us.<a href="http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/">MBT Shoes Sale</a> Therefore, we may be giving them one message on Monday and a different message on Thursday.</p><p>We need to be careful to soften our responses to our potential caregivers. We need to realize thatcompassion is a two-way street. If we ever expect to educate the non-bereaved population, we need to do itgently and tactfully, always remembering our own ineptness before we became bereaved!</p><p>Perhaps the gentleman's response could have been along these lines: &quot;Thank you for asking about my son,I love to talk about him. Of course age is really irrelevant because death at any age is devastating...&quot; <a href="http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/">MBT Shoes Sale UK</a> Thenhe could have gone on to tell me about his son in any detail he wanted. We both would have felt good aboutthe conversation, and I would have been smarter the next time.</p><p>We say, &quot;Be there with us; let us talk; don't avoid us. We want to talk about our loved ones. We want you tomention their names.&quot; Then we say, &quot;You always say the wrong thing.&quot;</p><p>Well, often our comforters and caregivers do say the wrong things. But, bless their hearts; at least they'retrying to say something. At least the ones who are talking with us aren't ignoring us or avoiding us. Untilenlightenment about grief and mourning becomes more widespread, they will continue to need our help ineducation, understanding and compassion. <a href="http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/">MBT Shoes UK</a> It seems to me that what we need is a lot more non-threatening,non-judgmental dialogue and communication. Perhaps attempts from both sides toward more understandingand tolerance of the other side would go a long way toward breaking some barriers.</p><p>All of us are here on the planet for such a relatively short time, and we're all struggling with the same basics:a need to be loved, a need for approval, a need to not be lonely. I've been around for a good while now,and it seems to me that the best way to get what we need is to give it away first. It doesn't always work, ofcourse, but it works often enough to make trying it a good idea.</p><p>Good Grief Resources was conceived and founded by Andrea Gambillwhose 17-year-old daughter died in 1976. Almost thirty years of experience in leading grief support gropus,writing, editing, and founding a national grief-support magazine has provided valuable insights into theunique needs of the bereaved and their caregivers and wide access to many excellent resources. <a href="http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/">Cheap MBT Shoes</a> Theprimary goal of Good Grief Resources is to connect the bereaved and their caregivers with as manybereavement support resources as possible in one, efficient and easy-to-use website directory.</p><p><a href="http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/">http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/</a></p>;

Coming up with a new invention or idea is one way to achieve massive success, but it isn’t necessary.And it can be the most challenging roads to success there is. You see many people have found lots ofsuccess just by taking something that already existed and simply putting their own twist on it .<a href="http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/">Shoes Mbt</a> Think about Apple for instance.

And remember, a river cuts through rocks not because of its power at a givenmoment, but because of its persistence over time.</p><p>When you are too busy looking behind and around you, people are passing you.<a href="http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/">MBT Shoes Sale</a> If you never focus clearly on something, you will never be 100% efficient at anything. Multi-tasking mightseem to make you efficient at getting multiple tasks done at once, but it usually reduces your efficiency indealing with each individual task.</p><p>Don’t wake up at seventy-five years of age sighing over what you should havetried, but didn’t because you were afraid to fail. Just do it, and be willing to fail and learn along the way. Veryfew people get it right the first time. In fact, most people fail to get it right the first 5 times. If what you didtoday didn’t turn out as you hoped, tomorrow is a new opportunity to do it differently. <a href="http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/">MBT Shoes Sale UK</a> Interpret each failureas a lesson on the road to success.</p><p>Thoughts are like the steering wheel that moves our life in the rightdirection. Success comes from positive energy. You can choose to get caught up in the negativitysurrounding you, or you can decide to do something positive about your situation. You always have achoice. Remember, happiness is an element of success, and the happiest people don’t necessarily have thebest of everything, they use positive energy to make the best of what they have.</p><p>You must find the place inside yourself where anything is possible. It startswith a dream. Add confidence, and it becomes a belief. Add commitment, and it becomes a goal in sight.Add action, and it becomes a part of your life. <a href="http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/">MBT Shoes UK</a> Add determination and time, and your dream becomes areality.</p><p>Successful people constantly come up with newideas, new projects, and new and innovative ways of helping others. This means that your aims andobjectives just benefit you, but also help benefit others as well. Bottom line: Your long-term success isdirectly tied to how well you serve your community. Read Maximum Achievement.</p><p>It’s a constant process of growth. If you want to besuccessful, you must continue to hold yourself to a higher standard than anyone else, and strive to improve.Oftentimes a person or organization will be successful, but then drop off. A person may become lazy, and anorganization may succumb to weaknesses or competition. <a href="http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/">Cheap MBT Shoes</a> Sustained success means continually improvingeven if others may not see a need for it.

If you’re looking out into the world to find where your purpose resides, stop, andlook inside instead. Look at who you already are, the lifestyle you choose to live, and what makes you comealive. Then nurture these things and let them grow until your current life can no longer contain them.

Letting go involves cherishingthe memories, overcoming the obstacles, and moving on. To let go is to be thankful for the experiences thatmade you laugh, made you cry, and helped you learn and grow. It’s the acceptance of everything you have,everything you once had, and the possibilities that lie ahead. <a href="http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/">MBT Shoes Sale</a> It’s all about finding the strength to embracelife’s changes and continue taking positive steps forward.</p><p>Mistakes are almost always forgivable if you have the courage to admit them.You have to be courageous and wise enough to know that if what you are doing isn’t producing the desiredresults, you must take different actions.

That's probably because when they're not jumping out of airplanes, they can always get a small rushby sneaking out for a midday margarita or blowing off the treadmill to go to a rock concert.</p><p>Change your behavior: To tip the scales in their favor, excitement seekers don't need to order plain, sauce-less, steamed everything when they go out to eat, says Keri Gans, RD, a nutrition counselor and author ofThe Small Change Diet. <a href="http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/">Shoes Mbt</a> Instead, Gans suggests finding healthier ways to take risks—like ordering your dishpunishingly spicy or sharing the most exotic, unpronounceable item on the menu with friends. If you happento be one of those people who can sneak out of work for a mountain bike ride or a climb (Coloradoans,we're talking to you), go for it. You'll want to keep exercising as you get older, because the NIA study foundthat compared with other personality types, those with this excitement-seeking trait are vulnerable to greaterweight gain over time.</p><p>It's no surprise that impulsive people are impulsive eaters and thus more likely to be overweight, but it is abit of a shock to hear how those pounds can add up: The NIA study, which was published in the Journal ofPersonality and Social Psychology, <a href="http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/">Mbt Sale</a> found that those who scored in the top 10 percent on impulsivity inpersonality tests weighed an average 22 pounds more than those in the bottom 10 percent.<br />This won't come as a surprise to the frazzled among us: The NIA researchers agreed with other studyauthors that orderly neatniks tend to be leaner than other people—in their analysis, by about 10 pounds.These are usually the same folks who embrace the structure of diets and are obsessed with countingcalories. Then there are the disorganized masses. Gans has many overcommitted clients who tell herthey're so busy that they barely eat a thing all day—and they can't understand why they're gaining weight.She helps them recognize unhealthy patterns, like skipping lunch, drinking a beer in a post-meeting debriefand then snacking indiscriminately on whatever's in the fridge at home. <a href="http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/">MBT Shoes Sale</a> That's 150 calories for the beer, 350for some hummus and crackers, 250 for frozen yogurt, 150 for a cereal bar...and none of it adds up to realsatisfaction, Gans says.</p><p>Change your behavior: Gans says that the trick for these personality types is getting them to eat even whenthey think they don't have time. She recommends that they stock their homes and offices with portable,nutritious, filling snacks, so they always have something on hand to prevent them from getting too hungryand making bad choices. <a href="http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/">MBT Shoes Sale UK</a> Her tried-and-true favorites: 23 almonds or 49 pistachios in individual-serving-sizebags, six-packs of yogurt and low-fat string cheese.</p><p>We know that bringing joy to others can enlarge the spirit, but research seems to say it can also make ourhips bigger. The NIA study found a correlation between warmth and gregariousness and a higherBMI—especially in women. Another study published earlier this year in the Journal of Personality and SocialPsychology suggested that people with sweet dispositions showed a strong preference for sweet treats.<a href="http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/">MBT Shoes UK</a> Finally, a study from Case Western Reserve University found that when good-natured people pleasersfound themselves in social situations, they were likely to overindulge in foods they’d normally avoid if theybelieved it would make others feel more comfortable. All of this means that cheerful, sweet people pleasersmay face extra weight challenges.</p><p>Change your behavior: Good news, sweetheart: Gans says that you won't do any damage by eating anounce of chocolate a day (that's three chocolate kisses). Really adore sweets? Get creative by microwavingsemi-healthy S'mores (substitute half a banana for the marshmallow) or enjoy sundaes with frozen yogurt,fruit and nuts. Share the love by making an extra one for your cubicle-mate.<a href="http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/">Cheap MBT Shoes</a> If your healthy eating plans arederailed by a friend who had a bad day and wants to split a pint of ice cream, Gans suggests a different kindof deliciousness: Take her out for a pedicure instead.</p><p>Change your behavior: Gans says that the biggest challenge is to recognize when to eat meals and when tostop snacking. She usually sees people putting off eating for most of the day because they're not hungry atnormal meal times and then taking part in an all-night snack-a-thon. She recommends three regular meals,starting with breakfast every morning—even if your morning is 11 a.m. and you're not starving, have agranola bar, a cup of yogurt or a piece of fruit. Don't worry about eating dinner later than other people, shesays, because it's not when but how much you eat that determines weight gain. If you know you're going tobe up for a while after your last meal, double up on fiber (whole wheat pasta, barley, legumes), which willhelp you stay full.</p><p><a href="http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/">http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/</a></p>;

By making kids' books more available thanthe remote, you'll encourage them to turn a page rather than turn on the TV.</p><p>With emerging readers—little ones who aren't yet reading on their own—Kimber says it's especiallyimportant to be conscious of the emphasis you place on literacy. &quot;Young children are incredibly excited tolearn how to read because it moves them up that ladder to being a big kid, so I think that parents can usethat excitement along with strategy, actually, to make sure they're feeding off it, instead of squandering it,&quot;she says.</p><p>One great strategy is to surround your kids with reading material that interests them. For example, if yourkids have a fascination with dinosaurs, Kimber suggests letting them read, or at least pretend to read, theirfavorite prehistoric tales. <a href="http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/">Shoes Mbt</a> If they're interested in the story, they'll be more inclined to push themselves whenthey stumble upon the parts they don't already know by heart.</p><p>You can also take reading on the road with you. Kindergarten teacher Nancy Singer finds that the best timeto practice early reading skills is when you're in the car. After all, she says, you'll have a captive audience! &quot;Parents are so busy. It's so unusual now to have a mom that doesn't work; there just isn't a lot of extra timeanymore. But everyone's in the car,&quot; Nancy says.</p><p>Look for environmental print, words you see all around you on buildings and street signs. When you driveby a restaurant or store, call out the letters. When you roll up to a stop sign, say &quot;Stop! S-T-O-P spellsstop.&quot; <a href="http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/">Mbt Sale</a> Nancy says efforts like this help your kids make the connection between letters, sounds and reading.</p><p>Help your kids realize that reading pertains to more than just books. Encourage them to get their hands oneverything they can, including comics, game directions, cereal boxes and kid-friendly websites. &quot;Evenhaving them go online and search for things—it's still reading. It's still having them comprehend andsynthesize the information from what they've read,&quot; Nancy says.</p><p>Just as you'd curl up with your favorite magazine, there are publications geared toward kids, as well. Nancysays Time for Kids and Weekly Reader are great magazines to keep your children in tune with the outsideworld. And don't discount your local newspapers! <a href="http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/">MBT Shoes Sale</a> The Detroit Free Press, like many other print publications,has a supplement for kids called Yak's Corner—keep an eye out for your local paper's version.</p><p>Nancy says it's more difficult to interest boys in reading than girls. Boys, she says, aren't typically interestedin narratives, and most of the books available for younger kids are just that. This is no excuse to let yoursons off the hook. &quot;For a lot of boys, it might Sports Illustrated, but it doesn't matter what they read as longas they read,&quot; Nancy says.</p><p>Reading and writing go hand in hand at the early stages of literacy. In the past, according to Nancy,teachers have often been discouraged to allow students to write about bloody fantasies or violence of anykind, but in recent years, Nancy and other teachers have found that letting little boys write about topicsthey're interested in is more productive than asking them to journal about their favorite memory.</p><p>Teaching your kids to read is like teaching them to ride a bike, Kimber says. It begins with you by their side.Start by picking a text that's just a little too difficult for your kids to read on their own. <a href="http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/">MBT Shoes Sale UK</a> Cuddle up with themand read the book aloud in unison. &quot;I think of this as riding the bike with training wheels,&quot; Kimber says. &quot;Yourchild begins to feel what it's like to be a reader; they hear themselves reading the book, but they have thefull support of their parent with them, which is really affirming and helpful to them.&quot;</p><p>When your kids become comfortable with this, Kimber says to read a sentence aloud on your own and thenhave your child repeat that sentence, echoing your pronunciation. &quot;It's like you've taken the training wheelsoff, but you're still holding onto the seat: They have you if they need support. You're letting them know whatit sounds like to read, but then they're feeling it on their own while reading the words on the page,&quot; Kimbersays.</p><p>Thom says, from a parenting perspective, it's as crucial to show children the importance of reading as it is totell them. <a href="http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/">MBT Shoes UK</a> &quot;One way to show them is by making a book into a gift, which they already know is something ofgreat value,&quot; he says. &quot;We know kids having access to things to read is critically important to kids loving[reading]. Surround them.&quot;</p><p>Take a shoe box and wrap it up with colorful paper and ribbon; make it special, and keep it in under yourchild's bed. When she receives a book as a gift or bring one home from school, add it to the box and let herknow she doesn't have to share any of those specific books with her siblings or friends. &quot;Every year, parentstell me their kids are so possessive of their under the bed books. Even if I've just printed the stories off inblack-and-white, the kids think they're special.&quot;At night, before your children go to sleep, go under the bed and pick out a book to read. Stay in the habit,even if you only have 10 minutes, &quot;and hopefully,&quot; Nancy says, &quot;this will set up a lifelong pattern of readingbefore bed.&quot;</p><p>Help your kids sign up for a library card. <a href="http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/">Cheap MBT Shoes</a> Not only will they feel more grown up, but they'll feel a sense ofaccomplishment and possession over their reading abilities. If, early on, you can instill in your children thevalue of print, they'll carry it with them for years to come.</p><p><a href="http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/">http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/</a></p>;

You might noticethat these three words bring your stated goal into sharper focus. For instance, if your New Year's resolutionis to lose ten pounds—a noun-verb goal—but your adjectives are strong, confident, and healthy, you mightrealize that your actual aim is to get fit. <a href="http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/">MBT Shoes</a> You would see that the strategy you came up with to diet (i.e., eatingyour weight in hydroponic cabbage) might leave you thinner but also recumbent on a couch without theenergy to leave the house—which isn't what you really want. Thanks to adjectives, you can fine-tune yourstrategy: Swap a fad diet for a meeting with a nutritionist, and sign up for weight training classes at the gym.</p><p>Sometimes tweaking isn't enough. Your adjective goal might utterly contradict your stated goal. Time torethink that original target. For example, if you think you want to win an Academy Award, you may imagineyour Oscar acceptance speech, and feel &quot;valued, satisfied, and unstoppable.&quot; <a href="http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/">Shoes Mbt</a> If you think that only a nightat the Kodak Theatre will lead to those feelings, you might spend years obsessively pursuing moviestardom, ignoring everyone and everything except your ambition. Odds are you still wouldn't win an Oscar,but you'd probably get a rapacious ego that could inhale all manner of rewards without even noticing them.On the other hand, if you immediately begin focusing on aspects of your present life that make you feelvalued, satisfied, or unstoppable, you'll feel an instant lift. All sorts of things may happen. Sure, you mightwin an Oscar. But if you don't find yourself onstage, blurting out that the statue sure is heavy, you'll be leftwith...a pretty good life. You might even find that as you follow the things that make you feel appreciated,you've tripped into an entirely different career. <a href="http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/">Mbt Sale</a> So starting now, survey your life for anything (I meananything) that can be described with any of those three words. Putting all your attention on those aspects ofyour life will make you happier right now and help you create future situations that fulfill your true desires.</p><p>I realize that all this sounds a little woo-woo, but psychological research on happiness backs up my strategy.Over and over, researchers studying happiness have found that the situational elements peoplecrave—money, social status, possessions—don't reliably lead to an experience of well-being. <a href="http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/">MBT Shoes Sale</a> By contrast,learning to find joy in the present moment increases life satisfaction, improves health, and allows us to live longer, more fulfilling lives.</p><p>My clients form my own database of sorts, convincing me that good goal-setting magic is (to use the socialscience terms) robust and valid. <a href="http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/">MBT Shoes Sale UK</a> For example, when I asked Ilsa to go back in time and imagine what sheonce thought she'd get from a successful business, she described herself with the adjectives relaxed, joyful,and secure (ironically, the demands of her wildfire success made her feel tense, joyless, and insecure).When she scanned her life for activities and relationships that made her feel aligned with those adjectives,she found them everywhere: in gardening, reading novels, playing with her niece. &quot;Damn!&quot; she told me. &quot;I'dalready succeeded before I succeeded!&quot; Indeed.</p><p>In Sue's case, remembering how she'd expected motherhood to make her feel yielded the adjectives loved,rejuvenated, and emotionally replenished. She realized that her noun-verb goal (having a baby who'sbeautiful and also colicky) actually created the opposite of her adjective goal—she felt unappreciated,haggard, and drained. It turned out that her magical adjectives described the way she felt when connectingwith old friends.<a href="http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/">MBT Shoes UK</a> Both Ilsa and Sue managed to give more attention and time to the things that evoked thefeelings they really wanted. (That's the beauty of adjective-based goals: They can work even when you'realready suffering the consequences of unwise noun-verb spells.) Ilsa carved out time for reading andgardening; Sue put the baby in the bouncy seat and caught up with friends on Facebook.</p><p>These efforts helped Ilsa and Sue work and parent better, <a href="http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk">Cheap MBT</a> and handle the difficulties conjured by theiroriginal goals, all of which eased my fairy godmother guilt.</p><p>In other words, we lived happily ever after. So if you find yourself longing for some idealized goal, take amoment to go fishing for adjectives. Then use them to identify the aspects of your life that are alreadydrawing you toward your heart's desires. Focusing on these people and activities will lead you gently towardeven more fulfilling experiences. One day you may find yourself in a situation more interesting and delightfulthan anything you ever imagined. <a href="http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/">Cheap MBT Shoes</a> Listen closely and you'll hear my annoying little voice in your head,whispering, Bippity-boppity-boo.</p><p><a href="http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/">http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/</a></p>;

Weall desire success in one form or another. Perhaps you want to get a promotion, or run a successfulbusiness, or be respected for your art. <a href="http://www.cheapmbtshoesmbtsale.com/">MBT Shoes</a> But if we are going to put a good deal of our energy into achieving agoal, it’s worth taking the time to ask ourselves whether the goal is worth attaining. If we ask our selves whywe wish to achieve anything, the inevitable answer is that we believe it will make us happy. Now we must askourselves if this is true, and whether there might be a quicker route to happiness, and most importantly,whether the pursuit of this future happiness is jeopardizing our happiness today. The Greek philosopherAristotle proposed an experiment about happiness. He said that if you ask anyone why they are doing whatthey are doing their ultimate answer will be because it makes them happy. <a href="http://www.cheapmbtshoesmbtsale.com/">Shoes Mbt</a> A person starting up her ownbusiness might initially say she wants to make money and have more freedom. Ask her why and she’ll saybecause it will let her spend more quality time with her family, ask her again and she say that this qualitytime will bring her happiness.</p><p>We all pursue happiness most of the time every day. But we rarely stop and ask ourselves – are wepursuing it in the most efficient way? <a href="http://www.cheapmbtshoesmbtsale.com/">Mbt Sale</a> We’ll examine how efficient our business plan is, or our work schedule,or our golf drive, but we don’t stop to look at whether we are efficiently moving towards happiness. In orderto achieve the goal of happiness you should consider asking yourself whether your life map is leading youtowards happiness by the fastest route.</p><p>The title of this article is powerful. Understanding the idea could make your life easier. We all want success,and we all want happiness. So what happens when we unify these two powerful ideas? Two words, with onemeaning. Success and happiness are the same.</p><p>For me realizing this has been a very liberating process. The old me who was stressed, addicted to work,constantly traveling and never arriving, has been allowed to relax. I no longer pursue my goals with thesame fanaticism or fervor. <a href="http://www.cheapmbtshoesmbtsale.com/">MBT Shoes Sale</a> Is this a good thing? A lot of people are attached to fervor, believing that withgreat motivation comes great rewards. I disagree, because I recognize that the more I want something, themore I push it away. In fact, through letting go of our attachment to outcomes, we become more likely toachieve our goals, and moreover, we become more likely to be happy.</p><p>Don’t burn out your life living like a fanatic. Take a good look at your map, and ask yourself, if it leads you tohappiness. It shouldn’t take long to reach happiness because happiness is never far away. A few minutes ofmediation, spending an afternoon with your family, playing some sport with old friends – these are the thingsthat will bring you happiness today. <a href="http://www.cheapmbtshoesmbtsale.com/">Cheap MBT Shoes</a> It’s easy to be happy, as long as you are willing to let go of your intensedesires, and let things be. Find your patience, find your inner peace, and realize that happiness is righthere, right now, waiting patiently for you?</p>

See everyone as a chance to add value. Give like crazy, embracegenerosity and make others more successful.</p><p>Do your research. The more specific your help can be, the better. Thiscomes from learning all you can about the people you want to meet. Not to manipulate, but so you canactually do something meaningful for them. Read their blogs and books, take their courses, sign up for theirnewsletters, learn about their interests, family, passions and charity work. Anything is game. With today’sonline tools, there is no excuse not to learn about someone before trying to interact with them. Rapportbecome instantaneous.</p><p>Everyone has something in common. <a href="http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/">Shoes Mbt</a> See it as a fun challenge to find what it is.The faster you can find shared ideas, beliefs and interests, the quicker you can relate. Start with a commonschool, restaurant, home town or favorite TV show. Continue to go deeper.The easiest way to be interesting is to be interested. Find excitement in what you canlearn from others. Hear what they say. Listen and learn about what matters to them. Not so you can saysomething back as soon as possible, but so you can get a window into their world. People want to tell theirstory. Be the person excited to hear it.</p><p>You must be interesting. The best way to do this isby embracing your passions, working towards an idea or cause and having a set of beliefs you’re deeplyexcited about that you openly share with others. Passion is an entire module in How to Connect with Anyonefor just this reason. <a href="http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/">Mbt Sale</a> No one likes talking to lemmings. Live and connect with passion. This is the surest wayto be someone worth talking to, and everyone is capable of it.</p><p>Remember their names. Nothing feels better than hearingyour own name, especially from someone you just met. And “I’m not good with names,” does not fly. No oneis good with names unless they practice! <a href="http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/">MBT Shoes Sale</a> Write them down the second you hear them. Repeat it out loud.Associate a fun image or idea with the person. Do whatever it takes to remember. Sadly, this alone puts youon a whole new level.</p><p>Live a life worth hearing about – most importantly for you, but for thosearound you as well. Do things you don’t normally do. Just being in new surroundings will cause you tointeract with a new group of people without even trying. The more things you do and try, the more thingsyou’ll have to talk about and the more fun you’ll have!</p><p>I’m not saying you wear a pair of swim goggles on your forehead(although that would certainly get attention), but having something that’s visibly and uniquely you, can givepeople a fun thing to talk about. Like the guy Scott who wears a name tag every day. When people ask whyhe has his name written on his shirt, he replies “so people ask about it – it makes meeting people supereasy.”<a href="http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/">MBT Shoes Sale UK</a> Maybe for you it’s crazy dress shirts, a bow tie or a fun hat. I always tip with two-dollar bills – one ofthe easiest ways to make someone’s day. Instant smile.</p><p>Never miss an opportunity to thank people for even the smallestthings, and especially if they helped you with something important. We withhold gratitude far too often. I amconstantly sending short texts, emails, books, gifts and notes to people for things they’ve done for me,others or the world in general. Learn unique ways to show thanks. <a href="http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/">MBT Shoes UK</a> Everyone loves being appreciated.</p><p>When you walk into a room, see the new faces not as strangers but asfriends you have yet to meet. You see the world in a more similar way to others than you probably realize,especially if you’re at the same event or a part of the same communities. Approach accordingly.None of the above matters if you don’t actually care about the people around you.If you don’t care about the person being a part of your life, you likely won’t do any of this stuff. If we’re goingto connect in a powerful way, we must reframe the way we look at people.</p><p>Connections don’t happen in your house or office. Youmust get out there, say hello and reach out. This can start with emails and online connecting, but that’s onlythe very beginning. <a href="http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/">Cheap MBT Shoes</a> Nothing makes a more powerful impact than meeting in the flesh. Don’t hide behindtechnology. Get out of your office and from behind the computer, work from a coffee shop instead of yourliving room and be in the places where other passionate people hang out.</p><p><a href="http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/">http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/</a></p>;

After a short lifetime of nothing but breast milk andwater, here was something entirely new and wonderful—sweet, wet, pink, delicious! In one brief moment, myson's world grew bigger and so much more interesting.</p><p>The senses carry food to the soul. Delight the senses, nurture them, and the soul thrives. Bombard thesenses, overload them, and the soul starves and shrivels. Every day the world clamors for ourattention—through computers, television sets, headsets, radios, fax machines and telephones—and oursenses have to take it all in. We eat on the run, plow through our to-do lists, yet we miss what is delicate,pure and lyrical.</p><p>Look around the room you are in right now. What do you see that pleases your eyes and soothes yourspirit? <a href="http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/">Shoes Mbt</a> We navigate the world according to what we see: a red light at an intersection, dirty dishes in thesink, a friend in the checkout line. But the visual world affects not just our actions but also our feelings.When we are surrounded by forms and colors that feed our souls, we bask in contentment.</p><p>Create a little altar for your eyes: Arrange one small space so it is exactly to your liking. Begin with a vasefull of spring boughs on a tabletop and go from there. Set a favorite photograph beside it; add a pretty rockor feather, a bowl of plump cherries, a special note card from a friend.</p><p>Choose one window in your home to be your &quot;frame&quot; on the outside world. The view should have somethingin it that lifts your heart—a cherished tree, a patch of sky, a neighbor's potted geranium. Grow familiar withyour view in all its intimate detail and look out on it for a moment or two at a different time each day.<a href="http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/">Mbt Sale</a>Watching this living landscape as it changes yet remains constant through the seasons, you may find youare led to your own quiet center. Explaining her return to the same spot on the coast of Maine for the past20 years, columnist Ellen Goodman writes, &quot;There are two ways to live—wide or deep.&quot; Our sense of sightallows us to live deep, thanks to our profound powers of observation.</p><p>Assemble the ingredients for a simple, solitary meal. Choose fresh, unprocessed foods—perhaps a salad,cheese, bread and a piece of fruit. Think about the origins of each food—the long, marvelous journey fromseed, mill or farm to your table. <a href="http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/">MBT Shoes Sale</a> Sit down to your feast without any distractions and allow yourself to savorevery mouthful. As Zen master Thich Nhat Hanh observes, we can see and taste the whole universe in apiece of bread.</p><p>Ask people which sense they could sacrifice and most choose smell; as senses go, this one seems relativelydispensable. But without one's ability to smell, many of life's simple pleasures dwindle or disappear. We aresmelling all the time—it is part of breathing, eating, lovemaking; part of taking in the world and responding tothe great potpourri of life. <a href="http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/">MBT Shoes Sale UK</a> We often carry our most vivid memories in our noses. Haven't we all buried ourfaces in a lover's forgotten shirt, inhaled the sweet essence of a baby's scalp, been stopped short by thehaunting scent of lilacs? Such fragrances unlock the storehouse of the mind.</p><p>Think about how you would like your house to smell. If it's cluttered with too many competing artificialaromas, throw out or give away products that don't please your nose. Introduce smells that are pure andnatural, keeping the overall effect subtle. Instead of air freshener, try a scented candle. Put handfuls offresh herbs into a pitcher of water. <a href="http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/">MBT Shoes UK</a> Open windows for at least an hour every morning; air out rooms and fillthem with the clean scents of damp earth and freshly cut grass.</p><p>Let your nose lead the way on a sensory walk. Take a friend with you and see what good sniffers you are.Can you tell which neighbor is barbecuing chicken? Can you smell rain in the air before the first dropletsfall? How far away is that pizza parlor? Humans can detect more than 10,000 odors. How many can yousavor on your stroll?</p><p>Make a ritual of washing your face. Patti Pitcher, co-founder of the Isabella catalog of &quot;books and tools forawakening the spirit,&quot; discovered that the simple act of caring for her skin resulted in heightened sensoryawareness. <a href="http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk">Cheap MBT</a> &quot;The cleansing is an awakening experience for me every time,&quot; she says. &quot;The more sensitivethe tips of my fingers become, the more alive my face feels and the more connected I become.&quot;</p><p>Fill a basket with small objects that offer tactile pleasure—a smooth stone, a chip of beach glass, a shell, apinecone, a gnarled twig. When you've acquired a dozen or so items, hold the basket on your lap and closeyour eyes. Pick up each article, one by one, and explore it with your fingers, noting its texture, temperature,weight and shape. Living mindfully, we discover that a rich and fulfilling sensory diet is a matter of selection. Just as we canchoose foods to nourish our bodies, we can choose sensory experiences that refresh our souls. <a href="http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/">Cheap MBT Shoes</a> The spurtof grapefruit on the tongue, a cheek turned to the sun, Yo-Yo Ma playing Bach—such gifts to the sensesremind us that we are alive and receiving the grace of the world.</p><p><a href="http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/">http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/</a></p>;

In a war, no matter the outcome of a certain skirmish or battle, the winner is the party whoseattitudes, behaviors and preoccupations come to dominate the postwar landscape. <a href="http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/">MBT Shoes</a> By this measure, theoutcome of the gender wars, if wars they were, is clear: Women won.</p><p>Men's attitudes more and more resemble women's attitudes. In 1977, for example, 72 percent of menbelieved men should be the primary breadwinners and women should be the primary caretakers of homeand family. Today, only 42 percent of men hold those opinions, which happens to be almost exactly thesame as the percentage of women who feel that way (38 percent).</p><p>Men's behaviors are becoming more and more like women's. In 1977, men spent, on average, only six hoursa week doing housework, as compared to 21 hours for women.<a href="http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/">Shoes Mbt</a> Today, when it comes to the &quot;second shift,&quot;men look a lot like women—men now spend 13 hours a week on housework, while women spend 17.Similarly, 40 years ago, the average Don Draper spent only two hours a day caring for his nonteen kids,while the average Betty devoted almost twice that much time to her kids—3.8 hours per day. Today, Betty'skid time is exactly the same, while Don's has climbed to three hours per day. Gen Y dads have taken it up anotch. They now spend more than four hours a day on childcare.</p><p>&quot;To know a culture, look to its heroes,&quot; goes the saying, and here, too, we see change and new models ofleadership. Gone are the macho monarchs—Jack &quot;Neutron&quot; Welch, George &quot;The Decider&quot; Bush, Michael&quot;Micromanager&quot; Eisner and Carly &quot;The Fighter&quot; Fiorina . <a href="http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/">Mbt Sale</a> In their place,we now honor a new style of leader, no less visionary, but more pragmatic, more conciliatory, buildingconsensus as they quietly get things done—in the Oval Office, Barack Obama; at Hewlett Packard, MarkHurd; at Disney HQ, Bob Eiger; and at the Welch mansion, the softer, friendlier hybrid, JackandSuzy.</p><p>Even our entertainment heroes have lost their masculine muscle. Arnold, Bruce and Stallone are long gonefrom the screen, but even the flirty, flaky, funny adolescents—Tom, Brad, Jim, and Will—no longer charm usquite as much as they once did. Instead, our leading men are the likes of Zac Efron who, though he can still&quot;Michael Jordan&quot; it on the court, now has to sing and dance charmingly to earn our affection. Or thedangerous but effete and oh-so-delicate Robert Pattinson of Twilight fame. Or the gender-bending, pirate-styling and pretty Johnny Depp. <a href="http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/">MBT Shoes Sale</a> Even James Bond has found his feminine side—all he wants is a quantumof solace, crushed as he is at the thought that the one he loved, really truly loved, betrayed him.</p><p>The spoils are choices. Women have more choices than ever before in their work, home and lifestyles. Andyes, men are becoming more like women, and so men are starting to face the same multitude of choices thatwomen tackle.<br />Today, with many companies offering paternal leave, men now have the choice to stay at home after thebirth of their newborn—which, as any dad will tell you, is a wondrous gift. <a href="http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/">MBT Shoes Sale UK</a> But they also have the choice totake advantage of this leave and stay at home wondering whether this absence will hurt their careers.</p><p>Men have the choice to stay at home even longer and assume the chief caregiver role—this happens in 40percent of U.S. households, either through choice or circumstance (in 40 percent of U.S. households, thewoman is the primary wage earner).<a href="http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/">MBT Shoes UK</a> But they have to face the fact that, in making this choice, their skillsmight become obsolete and their wages, when they re-enter the workforce, will wind up reflecting their out-of-date proficiency. According to recent research, this kind of career interruption with its attendant decline inrelevant skills, rather than pure gender discrimination, accounts for almost all of the fabled 77 cents-on-the-dollar male/female wage gap.</p><p>The choice-filled world that women have bestowed on men is a tough world. Tough on women; even tougheron men. At least that's what the data reveal. In 1977, 41 percent of women reported feeling some level ofwork/life conflict, whereas only 35 percent of men did. <a href="http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk">Cheap MBT</a> Today, about the same percentage of women reportwork/life conflict, but 59 percent of men are now similarly torn.</p><p>Or maybe it's not tougher on men. It's just that men aren't used to it, and so they feel it more. And so theycomplain more, as all novices do.<br />The victors are leading men into a new world, a world devoid of narrow paths and clear finish lines, a worldof broad expanses of choice and role, a world where you, not society, can decide your definitions of successand fulfillment. <a href="http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/">Cheap MBT Shoes</a> In its abundance, it is a wonderful world. It is also a world where, as women have found, if youpossess a poor internal compass, you can wind up utterly lost.</p><p><a href="http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/">http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/</a></p>;

This was as a result of going to school while workingand raising a family. The pressures were intense at times, compounded by my drive to graduate with thehighest GPA possible. <a href="http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/">MBT Shoes</a> What I didn't realize through the entire experience was that, as a well-educatedprofessional in my field, none of my employers would ever ask me what grade I received for any of theclasses I took in college. This has proven to be an important fact to refer to when advising my own daughter.<a href="http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/">Shoes Mbt</a> At the first glimpse of a rise in her temperature over the demands and rigors of her college curriculum, Iremind her of this truism, and a relaxation effect begins to take hold.</p><p>Don't get me wrong, I am not a parent who says, &quot;Hey, don't worry about your grades, as long as you pass.&quot;Nor am I unaware of the importance of an impressive transcript should my daughter decide to apply tograduate school. As the CEO, Bank of Mom, holder of graduate degrees and a professional person, I dohave a vested interest in my daughter's achievement and academic success. However, <a href="http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/">Mbt Sale</a> I am a realisticparent and experienced adult who knows better than to ride my daughter about maintaining a 4.0 in collegeto the detriment of her own health and sanity.</p><p>At almost 20, my daughter is facing many developmental tasks as she advances into normal, healthyadulthood. What concerns me most as I watch her navigate through the high seas, rogue waves andoccasional Bermuda Triangle of classes in college is how she manages the successes and failures she willundoubtedly face. Will she attribute all her good grades to her own skill and acumen while blaming herfailures on her professors? <a href="http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/">MBT Shoes Sale</a> Does she always have an excuse for why she didn't do as well as she wanted to,or does she humbly acknowledge that she didn't work hard enough or spent too much time partying? I knowthat good grades are often an indication of organized living, a sense of responsibility and diligence. But Ialso know plenty of outstanding students who are shiftless cheaters and plagiarists who spent theirundergraduate educations mastering their manipulative skills.</p><p>Don't get overly involved with her assignments or in the middle of any disputes between her and herprofessors. <a href="http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/">MBT Shoes Sale UK</a> Success in college is her responsibility, and you need to let her accomplish this on her ownsteam.</p><p>When she tells you she received a good grade, ask her what she loved about the assignment or the class.Then, validate the new and exciting things she's learned and remind her of the relationship betweeninterest, effort and success.<br />If she expresses feeling overwhelmed or stressed by the demands of school, review the benefits ofadequate sleep, eating well, exercising moderately and effective time management. <a href="http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/">MBT Shoes UK</a> And, if she's involvedwith many extracurricular activities, help her prioritize while keeping in mind that she needs downtime fromstudying too.</p><p>If your daughter sounds like she's completely falling apart from pressures related to school, before you tellher to hop the first bus or plane home, remind her that nothing is more important than her health—mentaland physical. Talk her down without taking over for her. This is a great opportunity to help her developcoping strategies.</p><p>Look for the humor in what she's telling you and help her see it too. <a href="http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk">Cheap MBT</a> Adding some levity doesn't mean you'redismissing her distress; you're helping her see things from a different perspective.</p><p>College is a time to for expanded thinking, learning and setting goals in life. It's also the time when thefoundation for sturdy adulthood really takes hold. As a parent, remind your daughter of all of the above, andif she's struggling with her GPA for realistic reasons, remind her that her future employers won't ask abouther grades. And, there's always next semester or a different class that she can look toward to bump up herGPA if need be. <a href="http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/">Cheap MBT Shoes</a> Your concerns as her parent shouldn't be just about her grades; they should include herdevelopment into a well-rounded, happy adult who can take pride in knowing she did her best incollege—whatever her grades end up being.</p><p><a href="http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/">http://www.mbtshoessaleukoutlet.co.uk/</a></p>;
