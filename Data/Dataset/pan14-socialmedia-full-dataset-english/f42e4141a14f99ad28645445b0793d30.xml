<br />     as breasts of singing birds.
<br /><br />She shapes her speech all silver fine
<br />    because she love it so;
<br />&amp; her own eyes begin to shine   <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/flowers.gif" alt=":)" />

<br />we leave our work when she returns   <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/tongue.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />   &amp; run to hear her talk.
<br /><br />We had not dreamed these things were so
<br />    of sorrow &amp; of mirth.
<br />her speech is a thousand eyes    <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />    through which we see the earth.
<br /><br />God wove a web of loveliness,

<br />but made not anything at all    <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/thumbs_up.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />    so beautiful as words.
<br /><br />They shine around our simple earth
<br />    with golden shadowings,
<br />&amp; every common thing they touch    <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/angel.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />   is exquisite with wings.
<br /><br />There's nothing poor &amp; nothing small
<br />   but is made fair with them.
<br />They are the hands of living faith     <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/thumbsup.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />    that touch the garment's hem.
<br /><br />They are as bloom or air,
<br />   they shine any star,
<br />&amp; I am rich who learned from her
<br />   how beautiful they are.       <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/hug.gif" alt=":)" />

<br />Healthy, virile and strong,
<br />With smooth skin, a firm fleshy arse,
<br />And hair growing where it belongs.
<br />Somewhere between adolescence and a mid-life crisis,
<br />Young Men are out there looking for fun,
<br />Throughout the passage of time the boy still exists,
<br />In the Young Man, who's another woman's son.
<br /><br />Young Men are extremely sensitive,
<br />And resent being referred to as boys,   <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/doh.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />They consider themselves quite mature,
<br />Despite a continuing passion for toys,
<br />As yet uncorrupted by the realities of life,
<br />Hopefully Young Men will learn from their mistakes,
<br />And not become negative or disillusioned,
<br />To run without handicap in the Manhood Stakes.
<br /><br />Young Men don't make me feel maternal,
<br />They have far too much Testosterone for that.
<br />I sit poised to strike and observe them,
<br />Like mice being stalked by a cat.
<br />Oh yes, they'd make wonderful playmates,
<br />Packages of tireless energy to be undone,
<br />But guilt overwhelms me when I have thoughts of 
<br />With a woman of my own age's son.

<br />I had dinner with my sweetie
<br />At his home the other night
<br />I knew he’d make a special treat
<br />At least I hoped he might
<br /><br />He set out all the crockery fine
<br />With his best linen pressed
<br />Silver knives and forks and spoons
<br />I really was impressed
<br /><br />I said “What’s for dinner sweetie?”
<br />He flashed a cheeky smile
<br />And replied “I know you’ll love it
<br />It’ll be ready in just a while”
<br /><br />Well I got a little suspicious
<br />For I noticed that no smell
<br />Was coming from his kitchen
<br />And no food was there as well
<br /><br />Nothing cooking on the stove 
<br />So sign of chook nor fish
<br />And he knew spaghetti marinara
<br />Was my favourite dish
<br /><br />The stereo played slow love songs
<br />The candles were aglow
<br />He certainly was cooking something up
<br />But what? I did not know
<br /><br />As he led me away from the kitchen
<br />My hopes began to crumble
<br />When he took me to the main bedroom
<br />I heard my tummy rumble
<br /><br />He set me down upon the bed
<br />And then to my surprise
<br />He grabbed a blood red silken tie
<br />And wrapped it round my eyes
<br /><br />I started feeling worried
<br />This was not his normal behaviour
<br />What could be for dinner here
<br />And what could I find to savour?
<br /><br />I could hear him rustling round a bit
<br />What was taking him so long
<br />I’d known him over six months now
<br />But could I have judged him wrong?
<br /><br />Did he have a darker side?
<br />Was he into kinky stuff?
<br />Well everything here seemed OK
<br />I knew I just had to trust
<br /><br />Then I felt his hand so gentle
<br />As he slowly released my blindfold
<br />I opened my eyes and before me 
<br />Was such a sight to behold
<br /><br />He had totally turned his body
<br />From his crown to his toenail tip
<br />Into a savoury sensation
<br />And in his hand... a packet of chips
<br /><br />Well, I could not hold back the laughter
<br />I was rolling about in a fit
<br />Then he held out the packet and said,
<br />So solemn...”Would you like a dip?”
<br /><br />After removing the hair from the pate
<br />To my delight it tasted divine
<br />And he kept a supply of rice crackers
<br />Propped up ‘tween his toes in a line
<br /><br />Well I tried the cream cheese on his fingers
<br />His belly button olives were yum
<br />But I kept coming back for my favourite
<br />The guacamole smeared on his buns
<br /><br />He’d gone to a lot of trouble 
<br />To find all my favourite things
<br />I especially liked the arrangement
<br />Of the cheezles and burger rings
<br /><br />I shared all the treats with my sweetie
<br />Towards the end I was starting to slow
<br />He gave me a wink and suggested
<br />I finish off with a big cheerio
<br /><br />Needless to say...
<br />There were no further courses
<br />We sent out for pizza instead
<br />After sweetie had showered we ate it
<br />Propped up in our crumb filled bed
<br /><br />Now our relationship’s taken on new meaning
<br />As we share in our new found delight
<br />In fact I’ve invited my sweetie
<br />For dessert round at my place tonight!</strong>

<br />Like hot butter bleeding on stale bread.
<br />The warm insides of my cantaloupe thighs 
<br />cry out in extasy as you eat my cherry pie.
<br />Visions of cucumbers often enter my mind
<br />and sometimes hot dogs, the plump when you cook'em kind
<br />Whipped cream all covered with goo
<br />slurping green jello in the tub with you
<br />You are my world my little cupcake,
<br />I want to lick your cream filling until you ache.

<br />For years and years they told me,
<br />Be careful of your breasts.
<br />Don't ever squeeze or bruise them,
<br />And give them monthly tests.
<br /><br />So I heeded all their warnings,
<br />And protected them by law.
<br />Guarded them very carefully,
<br />And I always wore my bra.
<br /><br />After 30 years of astute care,
<br />My gyno, Dr. Pruitt,
<br />Said I should get a Mammogram,
<br />&quot;O.K.,&quot; I said, &quot;let's do it.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;Stand up here real close&quot; she said,
<br />(She got my boob in line),
<br />&quot;And tell me when it hurts,&quot; she said,
<br />&quot;Ah yes! Right there, that's fine.&quot;
<br /><br />She stepped upon a pedal.
<br />I could not believe my eyes!
<br />A plastic plate came slamming down,
<br />My hooter's in a vise!
<br /><br />My skin was stretched and mangled,
<br />From underneath my chin.
<br />My poor boob was being squashed,
<br />To Swedish Pancake thin.
<br /><br />Excruciating pain I felt,
<br />Within it's vise-like grip.
<br />A prisoner in this vicious thing,
<br />My poor defenseless tit!
<br /><br />&quot;Take a deep breath&quot; she said to me,
<br />Who does she think she's kidding?!?
<br />My chest is mashed in her machine
<br />And woozy I am getting.
<br /><br />&quot;There, that's good,&quot; I heard her say,
<br />(The room was slowly swaying.)
<br />&quot;Now, let's have a go at the other one.&quot;
<br />Have mercy, I was praying.
<br /><br />It squeezed me from both up and down,
<br />It squeezed me from both sides.
<br />I'll bet SHE'S never had this done,
<br />To HER tender little hide.
<br /><br />Next time that they make me do this,
<br />I will request a blindfold,
<br />I have no wish to see again,
<br />My knockers getting steamrolled.
<br /><br />If I had no problem when I came in,
<br />I surely have one now.
<br />If there had been a cyst in there,
<br />It would have gone &quot;ker-pow&quot;!
<br /><br />This machine was created by a man,
<br />Of this, I have no doubt.
<br />I'd like to stick his balls in there,
<br />And see how THEY come out.</strong>

<br />Do the Tantric Rhythm and turn me on
<br />That's what it's all about
<br /><br />Do the Tantric Rhythm, Do the Tantric Rhythm
<br />Do the Tantric Rhythm, That's what it's all about
<br /><br />Now don't you dare ejaculate, it's time to hold it in
<br />I know it's been six months now
<br />But to let go is a sin
<br />Do the Tao Lovers and turn me on
<br />That's what it's all about
<br /><br />Do the Tao Lovers, Do the Tao Lovers
<br />Do the Tao Lovers, That's what it's all about
<br /><br />You put it all in, you pull it all out
<br />In out in out
<br />Then scream and cry and shout
<br />Then fall asleep on top of me that doesn't turn me on
<br />He's got no clue what it's all about
<br /><br />Do the Aussie Quickie, Do the Aussie Quickie
<br />Do the Aussie Quickie, He's got no clue what it's all about
<br /><br />Do the Kama Sutra, do the Tantric Rhythm, Do the Tao Lovers
<br />That's what it's all about! </strong> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/laugh.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/w00t.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/w00t.gif" alt=":)" />

<br />I'm in love but not with you. 
<br />Why didn't you tell me from the start. 
<br />Instead of going around breaking my heart. 
<br />You told your friends how you made me cry. 
<br />Why I told your girlfriend how you full of lies. 
<br />Yeah you can go around saying how you played me. 
<br />But what goes around comes around boy you'll see. 
<br />Yes I got a new boyfriend and he's nothing like you. 
<br />And yes I'm in love but not with you.</em></strong>
