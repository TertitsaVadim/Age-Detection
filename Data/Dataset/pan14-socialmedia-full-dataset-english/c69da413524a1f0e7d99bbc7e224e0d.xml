We decided to take a minute to check out 4 of them: the anti gravity treadmill, underwater treadmill, treadmill desk, and the treadmill bed.
<br /><br />Anti-Gravity Treadmill
<br /><br />Hands down, the anti-gravity <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5rOXN1cmYuY29tL21haW4vdW5kZXJ3YXRlcl90cmVhZG1pbGxzX2Zvcl9kb2dzLmFzcA__" target="_blank">Underwater Treadmill</a> could be the most amusing factor you'll see in a treadmill concept, but in contrast to the other 3 we'll overview here, this one isn't a joke: lengthy distance runners are instruction with it and have created remarkable improvements in their times. It is also getting employed by skilled sports teams to shorten the recovery time of injured players.
<br /><br />It operates like this: The user puts on a pair of compression shorts which are created of thin neoprene material and resemble cycling shorts. The treadmill is inside a bubble containment unit. The user enters the chamber, the chest and head stay above or outside the best in the bubble. Air is pumped in and also the Alter-G anti-gravity treadmill uses this air pressure to give the user the feeling they weigh up to 20 percent lighter. You really feel lighter and may work out longer with no receiving tired. Your endurance improves and you'll be able to train 10-20% extra in miles every single week since the pressure and fatigue on your muscles and frame is significantly reduced.
<br /><br />Verdict: Thumbs up on this machine. For those who are instruction for the Olympics and your organization can pop for the $75,000 value tag, as Nike says, &quot;Just Do It.&quot;
<br /><br />Underwater Treadmill
<br /><br />And now for some thing completely different: an underwater treadmill. This contraption looks extra like anything Houdini would have dreamed up: it really is a see-through glass aquarium in which the user stands on a treadmill using a water level that covers the legs up to the knees, or as high as the waist. The user can manage the water depth, belt speed, and jet resistance to increase the workout.
<br /><br />Discuss wacky treadmill innovations! Water workout routines are terrific for rehabilitation because combining weightlessness whilst working flexing the joints of your physique is valuable. Men and women happen to be walking around the shallow finish of swimming pools to help combat circulatory troubles and diabetes for years. But in this case you can want to weigh the steep value tag, about $70,000, against the price of gaining a standard treadmill and hiring a contractor to develop a compact swimming pool inside your back yard.
<br /><br />Verdict: Will the underwater treadmill catch on? No, not even when you're super-rich. The cons are that a single could suffer a stroke and fall inside the tank and drown; or worse, have a kid drown in this point. Or the glass could crack and leak all that water over your basement's carpet or floor. It also has to refill and dump water like a huge bath tub for every single session so it's hardly environmentally friendly. However the number one purpose not to purchase an underwater treadmill: you do precisely the same treadmill simulation workouts inside the 3' end at a public pool. Thumbs down.
<br /><br />Treadmill Desk
<br /><br />The sitting treadmill desk is just what you image it to be: a treadmill belt attached to a chair as well as a table-top workstation. A second version may be the Walkstation which permits you to stand up and work on a laptop, or do whatever it can be you do, though you move your feet and &quot;walk&quot; the belt. Somehow, writing economic reports while working out just does not appear to be a good mix.
<br /><br />Generally, this can be the ultimate in treadmill innovations for the multi-taker who wants to devote $6,500 on an inferior treadmill ... then attached to an over-priced desk.
<br /><br />Verdict: How do you concentrate although writing an important paper? Or maintain from breathing heavy into the telephone during a sales pitch? We are able to see applying a treadmill desk for occasional use, say though watching on the net videos and reading news and blogs, but not for operating. With the Walkstation, there's no place to sit down, unless you put a chair on the belt in the desk, and how stupid does that appear? And for the sitting treadmill, your legs are going by means of some motions but your butt continues to be carrying the weight of one's physique. Walking is a load-bearing workout; sitting is sitting. All of us are attracted to the notion of combining work with play but these desk treadmill innovations are a joke. Thumbs way down.
<br /><br />Treadmill Bed
<br /><br />This contraption has exactly the same simple flaw as the treadmill desk; the legs and trunk muscles don't shoulder any weight through the &quot;working out.&quot; The treadmill bed was developed as for physical therapy for the morbidly obese or those with muscular atrophy.
<br /><br />This can be a bed that will be hydraulically inclined to enable the patient to reach a full standing position devoid of exertion or leaving the bed. The drawback is the fact that the whole contraption is L-shaped: the treadmill stands erect in the foot of the bed when not in use, plus the bed then supplies complete upright support when the treadmill is on the floor and also the bed is in the air.
<br /><br />Verdict: Does not the bedding tumble down on prime in the patient? Is not it uncomfortable to become strapped in? We can envision a great deal of troubles with this point, but considering that we don't work in rehab hospitals we can't comment on the concerns with patient assistance should there be a power outage, hydraulics failure, or medical emergency. As far as treadmill innovations go, this one is actually a cautious thumbs sideways if it shows it has a handy purpose for the segment of society needing specialized PT.
