Very loud outgoing random. now i am more chilled laidback and keep to my self. since i am not one to offend people. I honestly wish i was back how i use to be, i am so pushed around by one  of my friends now. basically takes the girl i was going to go out with right underme and all my friends are saying that i should drop him and not fear introducing my self to a new crowd since i tend to enjoy any activity, basically i dont get bored  if i am always on the move..

<br />Girl: &quot;Can we do what?&quot;
<br />Guy: &quot;You know, can I be your first, finally?&quot;
<br />Girl: &quot;Um.....no.&quot;
<br />Guy: &quot;Why?&quot;
<br />Girl: &quot;Because, 1. you have a girlfriend, who happens to be my friend.......&quot;
<br />Guy: &quot;So, if you don't tell, I won' tell.&quot;
<br />Girl: &quot;Besides that, I'm waiting for someone special. Someone that I want to be with for the rest of my life to be my first.&quot;
<br />Guy: &quot;I'm not special to you?&quot;
<br />Girl: &quot;You're my friend. That's all.&quot;
<br />Guy looks forward and keeps driving. 5 minutes pass....... Guy starts to run his hand up the girl's thigh.
<br />Girl: moves his hand, &quot;Don't touch me!&quot;
<br />Guy: tries to kiss her.
<br />Girl: screams, &quot;Would you stop.&quot;
<br />Guy: continues trying.
<br />Girl: moves to the back seat
<br />Guy: parks on an abandoned street and gets in the backseat with the girl
<br />Starts to kiss her..
<br />Girl: pushes him off and scoots over, &quot;Please, don't do this.&quot;
<br />Guy: &quot;Don't do what, I know you want it, I can see it in your eyes.&quot;
<br />Moves over to her and starts to unbutton her pants.
<br />Girl: pushes him harder and says, &quot;No, don't.&quot;
<br />Guy: getting aggravated, punches her and tells her to stop &quot;playing hard to get&quot;.
<br />Girl: crying, continues to fight.
<br />Guy: punches her harder, pulls her pants off, and holds her down.
<br />Girl: screams as he penetrates her, &quot;NO, please don't do this to me!&quot;
<br />Guy: puts his hand over her mouth.
<br />An hour passes.........
<br />Guy: pulls back and wipes himself off.
<br />Girl: sits on the corner of the seat, sobbing.
<br />Guy: looks at her and says, &quot;You better not tell anybody about this. If you're really my friend, you won't tell anybody. You know I love you.&quot; He reaches out his hand to touch her cheek.
<br />Girl: pulls back, &quot;Just take me home, now.&quot;
<br />Guy: says, &quot;Alright.&quot; Gets in the front seat and drives her home.
<br />2 months later.........
<br />Girl: &quot;Doctor, what's wrong with me. I haven't had my time of the month in 2 months.&quot;
<br />Doctor: looks at her, &quot;You haven't been having your &quot;time&quot; for a reason.&quot;
<br />Girl: looks at him and says, &quot;Why?&quot; dreading the answer that she was sure to receive.
<br />Doctor: &quot;You are pregnant.&quot;
<br />Girl: faints.
<br /><br />The story gets out that she is pregnant, and people start looking to the guy. He claims that it isn't his because she was sleeping with every guy in the school(which was a lie). He goes to her and tells her, &quot;I'm telling you, if you lie to people and say that I raped you, I'll kill you.&quot;
<br /><br />The Girl is completely devastated. First, he took her virginity and got her pregnant....then he lied about it. So completely depressed......the girl commits suicide by drug overdose.......
<br />Girls, if this story touched you, repost it as &quot;That's Fucked up&quot;
<br />Guys, if this story touched you, repost it as &quot;I'll kill any fucker who does this&quot; if you care.

<br />that i bought you roses
<br />to tell you that i like you
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />That I was raised with respect
<br />not to sleep with you when you were drunk
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />That my body's not ripped enough
<br />to &quot;satisfy&quot; your wants
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />that I open your car door,
<br />and pull out your chair like I was raised
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />That I'm not cute enough
<br />to be &quot;your guy&quot;
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />That I am actually nice;
<br />not an asshole&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />I don't have a huge bank account
<br />to buy you expensive things
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />I like to spend quality nights at home
<br />cuddling with you, instead of at a club
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />I would rather make love to you then just f**k you
<br />like some random guy.
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />That I am always the one you need to talk to,
<br />but never good enough to date
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />That I always held your hair back when you threw up,and didn't get mad at you for puking in my car,
<br />but when we went out you went home with another guy
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />That I am there to pick you up at 4am when your new man hit you and dropped you off in the middle of nowhere,
<br />but not good enough to listen to me when I need a friend
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />If I start not being there, and being used as a door mat, only to be thrown to the side when the new asshole comes around
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />If I don't answer my phone anymore when you call, to listen to you cry for hours, instead of getting a couple hours of sleep before work
<br /><br />I'm sorry that you can't realize.. I've been the one all along.
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />If you read this and know somebody like this
<br />but don't care But most of all
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />For not being sorry anymore
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />That you can't accept me for who I am
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />I can never do anything right, and nothing that I do is good
<br />enough to make it in your world.
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />I caught your bf with another girl and told you about it, I thought that was what friends were for...
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />That I told you I loved you and actually meant it.
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />That I talked to you for nine hours on Thanksgiving when your bf was threatening you instead of spending time with my family.
<br /><br />I'm Sorry
<br />That i cared
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />that I listen to you at night talk about how you wish you could have done something different.
<br /><br />Ladies always bitch and bitch to their friends that there is never any good guys out there, and they always end up with assholes who mistreat them. Well ladies next time you're bitching, maybe look up to see who you're bitching to, maybe that special someone is right there hanging on your every word as usual, screaming in his head &quot;Why won't you give me a chance?&quot;
<br />Because the person you are usually searching for is right by you
<br /><br />If you're a guy and you agree with this letter, repost as &quot;I'm sorry &quot;
<br /><br />If You're one of the few girls with enough courage to repost, and you would never make your guy feel this way, repost as &quot;To all the girls who look past the nice guys&quot;***
