<br />So entwined together that it is inconceivable that you should ever part!..
<br />Because this is what love is!........Love is not Breathlessness!....
<br />It's not an excitement!.......It's not a desire! to mate every second of the day!.....
<br />It is not lying awake at nights imagining that he is kissing every part of your body!...
<br /><br />Love itself!..is what is left over when being in Love.....*****Has Burned Out*****

<br />We sneaked into a secluded room,
<br />Where your mother agreed to a download,
<br />From my hard drive,
<br />As soon as i was ready to upload,
<br />We discovered that neither one of us,
<br />Had used a firewall,
<br />And since it was too late to hit the delete button,
<br />Nine months later a little pop-up appeared that said!
