They gain from your experience with the product. The product can be anything as what you use is going to be used by a lot of other people the world over. Even you can gain from people who buy and review products.
<br /><br />Advantages
<br />When you  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2J1eWFuZHJldmlld2l0LmNvbQ__" target="_blank">Buy And Review</a>  products, you help other customers in making an informed decision for buying the product in the future.
<br />Other users are also encouraged to post reviews for products they buy once they understand the benefits of reviewing. As a result, a database of reviews for the product is created, and a wide range of products are covered.
<br /><br />How to review the products
<br />Reviewing is not a difficult or uphill task. All you need to be a good reviewer is to have been a fair user of the product.
<br />There are a number of factors one should consider while writing the review. Some of them would be the product discount obtained, value of the product for that price, durability etc.
<br />For example, an induction stove. There would be a lot of features on the stove that be reviewed. Like the time, it takes to heat up, if it can automatically detect pans placed on top of it, if it works perfectly every time it is used, etc.
<br />You should also mention the number of times it has broken down and the service provided by the company. A lot depends on the after sales service provided by the company because equipments may break down and there is no preventing it, but if the company is committed to repairing the product for the customer; they’ll have trust on that company and buy the product.
<br />There may be major faults in the equipment too which cannot be fixed; in that case if the company does not completely replace the product, customers will tend not to buy them.
<br /><br />Basing your decision on the review
<br />It is never wise to base decision of buying a product just on a single review. An apple 4 bought in dead conditions may be one in a million cases. Read a number of reviews and compare the experiences of all customers to frame your decision. Some customers may mishandle the product due to which the product may break down and not mention it. If possible, one should talk with someone in real who is using the product and not just read the review. It is wise to take a review in person.
<br /><br />What products can be reviewed?
<br />Almost any product under the sun can be reviewed by the user. You can also review a hello kitty for girls to vibrating tong rings. You just need to be well informed about the product and have a good understanding of its features. The features can be its use, reliability or anything one deems important.

It is an achievement to our own self on expressing our feelings for any commodity in words.
<br />How it helps customers
<br />Suppose you need to buy an apple 4. The company will never mention any weak points of its product, knowing very well any such mention will only reduce their sales. But then who do you turn for a review? It is your fellow customers who’ve already used the product. They will almost always give an honest opinion of the product.
<br />If any company has not provided a proper service after the product developed some glitches,  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2J1eWFuZHJldmlld2l0LmNvbQ__" target="_blank">Buy And Review</a> process will also manifest that.
<br />It is not only about the product which will be known to other customers. It will also be the attitude of the company to their customers that will be revealed.
<br />How it helps companies
<br />Buy and review process is also helpful to the companies who feel that serving that customers is their primary aim.
<br />They can obtain reviews directly from their customers about the products they make.
<br />It is easy then to determine what the exact flaws are and how their sales might be affected by them.
<br />If there are no flaws, if could be what other additional features the customers expect from the company.
<br />The  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2J1eWFuZHJldmlld2l0LmNvbQ__" target="_blank">Buy And Review</a>  system is great for honest companies, and can bash down companies which look to deceive their customers.
<br />What are reviewed?
<br />There is no bound on what can be reviewed. Anything ranging from vibrating tong rings, cooktop electric oven can be reviewed.
<br />The prices of the product are also the ones to come under scrutiny. For example, if product discounts are available at a certain store, customers putting up the reviews will mention that store in their reviews.
<br />Other factors that are reviewed can be product reliability, durability, customer satisfaction, etc. If the product does not serve the purpose for which it was made, it is of no use. Not only concrete qualities, but also abstract qualities of the product are reviewed. Looks of the product is an example of it.
<br />Review process
<br />There is no hard and fast rule needed to be followed to review any product.
<br />Users just write their experience with the product. If a user had bought a sunglass for protection from the sun, and it does that fairly well, the customer will be satisfied. While if the same sunglass was bought by another customer to make a fashion statement; it might or might not satisfy him/her. So what is good for one customer may not be good for another customer.
<br />So everyone following the buy and review process must do a lot of research themselves and not just base their decisions on the reviews. They should follow what the manufacturer suggests them to do, the manufacturer’s quality statement and compare them with the customer reviews. Then one must use their own logic and judgement to make an informed decision, which will the best use of the buy and review process.
