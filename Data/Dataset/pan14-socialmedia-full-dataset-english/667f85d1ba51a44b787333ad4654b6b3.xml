<br />achorman1986 -
<br />&quot;your blog sucks donkey balls you....cunt&quot;
<br /><br />Since he quite ovbiously loved my blog so much i decided to dedicate this one specially to him. 
<br /><br />It makes me so sad that someone leaves me nasty messages on my blog  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/sad.gif" alt=":)" /> 
<br />It makes me feel so worthless <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/sad.gif" alt=":)" /> 
<br />rofl.
<br />Whatever mr anchorman.
<br />Suck my dong.
<br />Cause you can't bring me down by Typing out swearwords you articulate human being you. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/w00t.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />heres a tip for you though. If you don't like reading them.
<br />OMG
<br />heres an idea
<br />dont read them?
<br />Simple ecinomics anchorman.
<br />simple ecinomics
<br /><br />ANYWAY
<br />on with the donkey ball sucking blog.
<br /><br />on the first day of being on pan.net
<br />I learned that guys who wern't perves on here are like Gold dust. 
<br />renamed once again to...
<br />&quot;netspazz-place to get off&quot;
<br /><br />Gah I'm so Fed-up
<br />Bored.
<br />Just missed talking to jacob.
<br />He's gone to work. 
<br />Ghey.
<br />Didn't get to speak to him last night
<br />Nothing happenened other than that
<br />Doctors appointment cancelled. 
<br />He's going to kill me X| 
<br /><br />I was thinking today, How not many people Live by passion anymore.
<br />How most people Live their life by media, How much money they make.
<br />And theirs too many people that Looove to try and bring people down.
<br /><br />It fucks me off tbh

<br /><br />Oh god i really am tired and making no sense :]
<br /><br />Most days are now spent Avoiding college Like the plaugue AND avoiding my tutor like the plaugue 
<br /><br />My tutor looks like this 
<br /><br />&lt;Enter picture of a scary hairy best here&gt;
<br /><br />I would Put put a picture up :]
<br /><br />But Netspazz isn't advanced enough to put pictures on your blog &gt;:|
<br /><br />Gah Sort it out shlags.
<br /><br />See what i mean about random rambalings branching out
<br /><br />From the word &quot;shlags&quot; I have found myself onto another Topic....

<br />[Chilli Chowder!] 
<br />CRUTON CRUTON! 
<br />Crunchy friends in a liquid broth!

<br /><br />So i've been randomly searching Youtube
<br /><br />And laid eyes on...
<br /><br />The YtWatchDog :]
<br /><br />He rips the piss out of cheaters on Youtube
<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D8yEFi_R2jJM"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yEFi_R2jJM</a>
<br />^Very funny in my opnian :]
<br />He found a chipmunk...
<br />And named it tony...
<br /><br />Ok So question if you've mananged to stay awake this long..
<br /><br />If someones hurt you really bad..
<br />Should you trust them again?
<br /><br />A couple of weeks ago my now ex told me that He still loved his wife.
<br /><br />A couple of days ago he told me he still loves me but Still loves his wife at the same time.
<br /><br />He might want to get back with me.
<br /><br />Should i trust him again?
<br />Or try to move on?
<br />I really miss him <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/sad.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />Anyway 
<br />with the things that have been going on recently i've lost track of my life really gone off the rails a bit
<br /><br />And needed a fresh start on life if you get me?
<br /><br />so this monday or sometime soon
<br />I'm hopefully moving in with a freind.
<br />Trying my best in college (this one doesn't sound to fun)
<br />Finding myself a part time job (This one doesn't either.)
<br /><br />But hopefully it's going to work out in the long run ^-^
<br /><br />Just thinking about it is giving me a headache and just thinking about it is making me feel tired lol.
<br /><br />But i had a great weekend <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />Friday-got drunk n watched fireworks
<br />Saturday-got drunk watched fireworks.
<br /><br />Lol doesn't sound that fun but it was ^-^
<br /><br />Bottle of whiskey in one hand
<br />2 Bottle of Vodka upstairs eagerly awaiting having their insides drunk ^-^ 
<br /><br />Tip: When drunk Don't try and pick up Glass while being on the phone and trying to smoke &gt;.&lt;
<br />You end up Losing your balence.
<br />and falling on the glass &gt;.&lt;
<br /><br />It hurts <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/sad.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />But any reply on that question i asked about halfway through all this rambaling would be Much appreciated.

<br /><br />this is GUY TALKING...
<br /><br />IT'S 7TH GRADE...
<br /><br />I stared at the girl next to me...She was my so called &quot;best friend&quot;... I stared at her... Long, silky hair... And I wished she was mine... But she didn't notice me like that... I knew it... After class she walked up to me and asked me for the notes she had missed the day before... And I handed them to her... She said &quot;thanks&quot;... And gave me a kiss on the cheek... I wanted to tell her... I want her to know that I don't want to be &quot;just friends&quot;... I love her but I'm too shy to tell her... And I don't know why...
<br /><br />IT'S JUNIOR YEAR...
<br /><br />My phone rang... On the other end it was her... She was in tears... Mumbling on and on about how her love had broken her heart... She asked me to come over because she didn't want to be alone... So I did... As I sat next to her on the sofa... I stared at her soft eyes... Wishing she was mine... After 2 hours... A Drew Barrymore movie... And 3 bags of chips... She decided to go to sleep... She looked at me.. Said &quot;thanks&quot; and gave me a kiss on the cheek... I wanted to tell her... I want her to know... That I don't want to be &quot;just friends&quot;... I love her but I'm too shy to tell her... And I don't know why...
<br /><br />IT'S SENIOR YEAR...
<br /><br />The day before prom... She walked to my locker... &quot;My date is sick&quot; she said... He's not going to go... Well... I didn't have a date and in 7th grade... We made a promise that if neiter of us had dates... We'd go together just as &quot;best friends&quot;... And so we did...
<br /><br />IT'S PROM NIGHT...
<br /><br />After everything was over with... I was standing at her front door step... I stared at her ... She smiled at me... I wanted her to be mine... But she doesn't think of me like that... And I know it... Then she said &quot;I had the best time... Thanks!&quot;... And she gave me a kiss on the cheek... I wanted to telll her... I wanted her to know that I don't want to be &quot;just friends&quot;... I love her but I'm just too shy... And I don't know why...
<br /><br />IT'S GRADUATION DAY...
<br /><br />A day passed... And then a week... And then a month... Before I could blink... It was graduation day... I watched her... Perfect body... Floated like an angel up on stage to get her diploma... I wanted her to be mine... But she doesn't think of me that way... And I know it... Before everyone went home... She came to me in her smock and hat... And cried as I hugged her... Then she lifted her head from my shoulders and said &quot;you're my best friend&quot;... &quot;Thanks!&quot;... And gave me a kiss on the cheek... I wanted to tell her.. I wanted to know that I wanted to be more than &quot;just friends&quot;... I love her but I'm too shy... And I don't know why...
<br /><br />IT'S A FEW YEARS LATER...
<br /><br />Now I sit in the pews of the church... A church that she is getting married in now... I watched her say &quot;I do&quot; an drive off to her new life... Married to another man... I wanted her to be mine... But she didn't see me like that... And I knew it... But before she drove away... She came to me and said &quot;You came!... Thanks!&quot;... And she kissed me on the cheek... I wanted to tell her... I wantd her to know that I didn't want to be &quot;just friends&quot;... I love her but I'm just too shy... And I don't know why...
<br /><br />YEARS PASSED...
<br /><br />I looked down at the coffin of a girl who used to be my &quot;best friend&quot;... At the service they read a diary entry she had wrote in her high school years... This is what it said... &quot;I stare at him... Wishing he was mine... But he doesn't notice me like that... And I know it... I wanted to tell him... I wanted him to know... That I don't want to be &quot;just friends&quot;... I love him but I'm just too shy... And I don't know why... I wish he would tell me he loved me&quot;... I wish I did too... I thought to myself and I cried...

<br />I'm SUCH a serial Blogger.
<br />I'm Most sites and Always looking for new sites Just to blog on Lol.
<br /><br />And when i'm not online i Blog old fashioned style.
<br />Pen n paper <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cool.gif" alt=":)" /> 
<br /><br />I don't know why i Like blogging so much?
<br /><br />I guess its the kind of Mystery about it
<br />None of my &quot;real life freinds&quot; Are really on PAN and have never really heard of it.
<br /><br />So i just write in here
<br />I ramball on everywhere 
<br /><br />I've even Blogged on my desk where my computar is
<br />I was drunk
<br />t'is my excuse ^-^ 
<br />But it now says 
<br />&quot;Life-will chew you up and spit you out before you've had chance to breath&quot;
<br />on my desk :]
<br /><br />In some ways i think its a good thing that i have so much to say <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />But in a bad way i bet some people wanna gag me ^-^
<br /><br />I Love to make people laugh and Think about stuff <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/unsure.gif" alt=":)" /> 
<br /><br />I don't know why <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/unsure.gif" alt=":)" /> 
<br /><br />The last Blog i wrote 
<br />Omg.
<br />It was a chain letter <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/huh.gif" alt=":)" /> 
<br />I hate chain letters :/
<br />But i wanted to repost Because at the moment i just want A certain someone to say they Love me so bad :/
<br />I guess i wanna try anything
<br />Pathetic eh?
<br /><br />So today
<br />i missed college :/
<br />Atm i feel like i can't really go in 
<br />Dk why 
<br />but i haven't been in college for about 2 weeks now :/ Maybe three
<br />But i rang up today and explained myself
<br />To this woman
<br />&quot;anne&quot;
<br />She looks like a BEAST
<br />but was suprisngly nice and was really understand with my &quot;situation&quot;
<br /><br />Tip of the day: Never judge a Book by its Cover,you may be suprised.
<br /><br />But it's so weird 'Cause i ALWAYS judge books by there Covers. 
<br />Literally i mean
<br />I pick like Books by how pretty the Covers are
<br />And i bet most people do
<br /><br />I bet if the bible had a really knarly Cover
<br />More people would read it.
<br /><br />Jeez jesus,Did you have NO media aspects???
<br /><br />Lol here comes the ramballing
<br /><br />But back to where i was so today

<br />So at about 10pm we started drinking again and 
<br />drank untill 4:30am :/
<br /><br />At 7 left for college :|
<br />We were slightly drunk..
<br />Not a good idea no..
<br />But hey it happened
<br /><br />On the way there Shazz Pulled me off the pavement
<br />and said

<br /><br />We then made up a song
