Its continuously imperative to grasp the quantity of cubic ft the cylinder your enthusiastic about in reality is, also always take a look at the neck belonging to the cylinder. When the neck has an engraving or verbiage that states you'll find it a rental or has the name of the welding supply provider on it, you should certainly keep away from buying the cylinder, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5nYXNtYW51ZmFjdHVyZXIuY29tLyZxdW90O3RpdGxlPSZxdW90O2dhc21hbnVmYWN0dXJlcg__" target="_blank">gasmanufacturer</a> .<br /><br />Cylinder tanks should really be certified virtually every 10 years and you'll find symbols that help you figure out once the future certification should be. Usually there's a day of very last certification along with a additionally indication, which represents 5 yrs, also the star symbol which signifies one additional five yrs. If paying for a tank and there isn't any markings over the neck that may be a excellent indicator, nonetheless a dented or rusted tank or one that has rented over the neck might be prevented.<br /><br />As soon as you buy your cylinder that features a compressed gas you have got to guantee that the cylinder is clearly revealed. Identification should certainly be stenciled or stamped on the cylinder or on a label. If ever the labeling of one's contents within the cylinder turns into unclear you have to give a whole new label for the cylinder assuming that you know the contents. If ordering a cylinder and also contents are unknown and also identification is unreadable, return the cylinder and mark &quot;contents unknown&quot;.<br />Fuel Cylinders should certainly usually be secured, either by bench major, individually into a wall or stored within a cage or cylinder cupboard. Cylinders are serious if mishandled with misuse turning a metallic typical cylinder into a unguided rocket without control across the path or place and could very easily move through a brick wall and get rid of another person with its brutal power.<br /><br />Cylinder valves ought to usually be opened slowly with oxygen cylinder valves needing to become opened 100% of one's way. First of all you might open up the oxygen cylinder valve just a little bit, once the needle has stopped moving, than open the valve all the way. Oxygen cylinders will need to have the valve opened many of the way as a result of the large pressure from the tank.<br /><br />When the contents of a cylinder are empty, the valve will need to be closed, the technique bled and also regulator eradicated. At this time the valve cap should really get replaced as well as the cylinder should certainly be marked empty and separated within the other cylinders in use, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5nYXNtYW51ZmFjdHVyZXIuY29tLyZxdW90O3RpdGxlPSZxdW90O2luZHVzdHJpYWwgZ2FzIGN5bGluZGVycw__" target="_blank">industrial gas cylinders</a>.<br /><br />At long last, when shifting cylinders or transporting them, just one cylinder ought to be moved at a time and when shifting substantial cylinders be certain that you've a suitable cylinder cart to be certain balance and protection. These gas cylinder carts or welding carts will make certain mobility and balance with bottles simply being held by chains with adjustable chain one way links welded securely to frame. Carts come in many different measurements that can take care of between four to eight significant gasoline cylinders.

Beneath are some examples of cylinder physical hazards as outlined by the American Welding Society (AWS).<br /><br />Physical Damage &amp; Exposure<br />The internal pressure of a gasoline cylinder will be as high as 2,500 pounds per square inch. Extensive physical vibrations and exposure to heat or electric circuits are just a few things that could cause weaknesses in the wall of a cylinder, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5nYXNtYW51ZmFjdHVyZXIuY29tLyZxdW90O3RpdGxlPSZxdW90O2dhc21hbnVmYWN0dXJlcg__" target="_blank">gasmanufacturer</a>.<br /><br />This sort of damage could potentially trigger an explosion or rupture in the tank, sending certain rogue pieces of metal flying through the area and injuring a few people along the way.<br /><br />The number one cause of gas cylinder harm comes from tanks that are dropped, tipped over or fall. Special care in transporting and storing this large and potentially dangerous piece of gasoline equipment could prevent such incidents from happening.<br /><br />Gas Regulator Valve Hazards<br /><br />There's always potential for hazard when working around industrial equipment. Yet, following the set up security guidelines for a particular piece of equipment quite often minimizes the risk of injury.<br /><br />With gas cylinders, it's important to use tanks with valve inlets that meet the maximum dimension requirements established by the Compressed Gasoline Association (CGA). If a regulator valve breaks off and the valve inlet doesn't conform to the CGA standard, it's extremely possible you may possibly soon have a flying cylinder on your hands. Because cylinders often contain flammable gases such as acetylene and propane, it truly is important to routinely check for leaks. Storing cylinders in well-ventilated areas will minimize the potential risks posed by leaks.<br /><br />Here are some storage and transport techniques that will be used to avert or minimise gas cylinder catastrophes:<br /><br />To prevent tipping or falling, secure tanks in the upright position to a building or cylinder cart using a chain, cable or strap.<br />Make sure cylinders are kept in a dry and well-ventilated area at least 20 feet from any combustible materials. Tanks ought to be stored in areas where they will not be in contact with heat or electrical currents, and the potential for mechanical or physical damage is minimized, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5nYXNtYW51ZmFjdHVyZXIuY29tLyZxdW90O3RpdGxlPSZxdW90O2dhc21hbnVmYWN0dXJlcg__" target="_blank">gasmanufacturer</a>.<br />Utilize the proper equipment, number of workers and correct safety procedures when moving and lifting cylinders.<br />Keep away from dragging or rolling cylinders. Use a dolly or a cart properly designed to transport cylinders, and make sure the tank is properly secured in the upright position.<br /><br />These are just a small sampling of the things that need to be considered when transporting and storing gas cylinders.

The acetylene cylinder must be installed using the exclusive back fire arrestors and pressure reducers. Because the acetylene cylinder has versatile working places, more than frequently, they are going to be moved right here and there, it should certainly be installed on an exclusive small auto for the comfort, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5nYXNtYW51ZmFjdHVyZXIuY29tLyZxdW90O3RpdGxlPSZxdW90O2dhc21hbnVmYWN0dXJlcg__" target="_blank">gasmanufacturer</a>.<br /><br />two. Do not knock, crash, or vibrate the acetylene cylinder. That will lead the porous material sinking down and forming holes inside the acetylene cylinder, that will impact the storage of acetylene.<br /><br />three. The acetylene cylinder should never lie down but stand upright. If the acetylene cylinder is lain down, then the acetone will flow out collectively with acetylene and even flows into rubber pipes, which is rather risky.<br /><br />four. Open the acetylene cylinder with expert tools. The opener ought to stand behind the valves. Besides, the opener should open the acetylene cylinder slowly. Moreover, there will need to usually have some acetylene inside the cylinder.<br /><br />5. The temperature with the acetylene cylinder body shouldn't be over 40. In the season of summer, it ought not to be put beneath the sun for a extended time, since as well high temperature will reduce the dissolving speed of acetylene affected by acetone, which will result in the inner pressure in the acetylene cylinder rise in pretty brief time. <br /><br />6. If the inner liquid inside the acetylene cylinder is frozen in winter, then you must use hot water to unfreeze the acetylene cylinder. Fire isn't permitted, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5nYXNtYW51ZmFjdHVyZXIuY29tLyZxdW90O3RpdGxlPSZxdW90O2dhc21hbnVmYWN0dXJlcg__" target="_blank">gasmanufacturer</a>.<br /><br />7. Pressure reducer might be connected for the valves in the acetylene cylinder. It really is not allowed to use an acetylene cylinder when it's leaking. Or when the acetylene contacts together with the air, they are going to blow out if there is fire, even sparks.<br /><br />8. If defects are found on the acetylene cylinder, operators should not mend them by themselves. What they need to do is usually to send the acetylene cylinder for the manufacturer and have them fixed.<br /><br />The safety needs of storing the acetylene cylinder<br /><br />The distance amongst the storage room and the open fire or fire sparks should be no much less than fifteen meters. As well as the acetylene cylinder storage rooms ought not to be within the basements or semi-basement. Also, the storage room might have beneficial facilities that can reduce the temperature and make the air flow into the storage room. Direct sunshine ought to be avoided and the transport paths really need to be kept clear and there might be equipped with fire plugs and dry powder, but CTC fire plugs are forbidden be applied under this condition.

Nevertheless, acetylene belongs to a combustible not to mention explosive gas. The ignition energy is fairly small, about 1/10 of the normal flammable gas, and additionally sometimes it really is even difficult to find with our eyes. When it mixes with air to reach a certain concentration, it explodes when encountered fire, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5nYXNtYW51ZmFjdHVyZXIuY29tLyZxdW90O3RpdGxlPSZxdW90O2dhc21hbnVmYWN0dXJlcg__" target="_blank">gasmanufacturer</a>.<br /><br />Acetylene cylinders have some problems when we use them. When acetylene not to mention oxygen cylinders are set at the same location: there is no safe distance. After acetylene cylinders are horizontally scrolled, it will be put into use without vertical static discharge. The acetylene cylinder surface temperature is above 40?? without covering during the summer outdoor working. Acetylene cylinders fail to stay in the residual pressure. Filling company did not check carefully. These problems have led to some casualties.<br /><br />For this reason, the safe use of acetylene cylinders needs to stick to the following requirements:<br /><br />1. Acetylene cylinders ought to be maded by national sentinel manufacturers. A new bottle of certification should really be completed, not to mention consistent with the seal of the cylinder shoulder. It also needs to have a regular technical inspection.<br /><br />2. Before the use of acetylene cylinders, we should certainly slightly open the valve to remove dirt. Install the dedicated acetylene reducers, to make it to locate in the best parts of the bottle. And additionally check the joints if leaking. After confirmation, we adjust it to the required pressure, together with then use it.<br /><br />3. Acetylene cylinders really should normally be used below 40??. We might take effective measures to cool down it when the temperature exceeds 40??.<br /><br />4. Acetylene cylinder surface color is white; the paint color must be protected of intact. They are not permitted to change.<br /><br />5. We might choose a safe place to set the acetylene cylinders: not near heat sources coupled with electrical equipment. Acetylene cylinders must be placed vertically to prevent the acetone outflow which can cause combustion and then explosion.<br /><br />6. Do not strike  collide with the acetylene cylinders. When the valve is frozen, we can utilize 40?? hot water to thaw. It can be strictly prohibited roasted.<br /><br />7. Acetylene cylinders handling will need to utilize a special vehicle. It truly is strictly forbidden to use an electromagnetic crane or cable hoisting. When the place of work is not fixed coupled with needs to move frequently, it must be installed in a dedicated rubber tire car, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5nYXNtYW51ZmFjdHVyZXIuY29tLyZxdW90O3RpdGxlPSZxdW90O2dhc21hbnVmYWN0dXJlcg__" target="_blank">gasmanufacturer</a>.<br /><br />8. Acetylene cylinders must remain installed in the temper prevention device. When it needs to open the valve, the operator ought to stand on one side of the valve port, plus the action ought to be playful. The valve shouldn't exceed one and then a half when opening. Normally, it needs to open 3/4 turns, and also the working pressure usually in 0.02MPa-0.06MPa.<br /><br />9. It prohibits copper, silver, mercury together with their goods to contact to acetylene. If we must use a copper alloy apparatus, the copper content of the alloy really should be less than 70%.<br /><br />10. It is banned to exhaust the gas to the acetylene cylinders. Acetylene cylinders must stay in pressure 0.1MPa to 0.3MPa as per the changes in ambient temperature, to prevent other gases to come down the cylinder.<br /><br />11. When working, the acetylene cylinder valve wrench should stay in the valve in order to close the valve quickly when occur the occasional accident.<br /><br />12. When ceasing operations, the valve needs to be closed, not to mention remove pressure reducer. When confirming no leakage, the operators can leave the workplace.<br /><br />13. When using acetylene cylinders in the indoor or enclosed environment, we need to prevent leakage together with increase ventilation to avoid the explosion accident.

The weight of argon is 1.4 times of the air. It can form a stable air layer at the top of the molten pool, which has good protective properties. Plus, in the welding process, the smoke is less plus it can be easy to control the weld pool and also arc. Under the normal temperature, argon does not have chemical reactions with other objects, and then does not dissolve in the liquid metal even at high temperatures. So, it's better to show its superiorities in the welding of nonferrous metals, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5nYXNtYW51ZmFjdHVyZXIuY29tLyZxdW90O3RpdGxlPSZxdW90O2dhcyBtYW51ZmFjdHVyZXI_" target="_blank">gas manufacturer</a>.<br /><br />Argon is a monatomic gas. At high temperature, argon can directly dissociate from the positive ions not to mention electrons. So, the energy loss is low, and arc combustion is pretty stable. The volume of positive ions and then the quality is quite big after the decomposition. It has a powerful impact on the cathode, with a robust cathode crushing effect. Because of the small cooling effect of argon arc, the heat loss of arc burning is fairly small and it also has better stability.<br /><br />Heat shrinkable effect of the argon gas is extremely small, and the potential gradient plus current density is also not big. What's more, the voltage to stay in the argon arc burning is low, usually 10V. So, when the welding arc is elongated, the voltage is changed little, and difficult to extinguish. This is especially favorable to manual argon arc.<br /><br />Purity requirements of argon gas<br /><br />Argon gas is the by-product of oxygen. Because the boiling point of argon is in the range between the oxygen plus nitrogen, and then the difference is pretty small, so in argon gas sometimes remains a certain quantity of impurities. If the impurity of the argon gas is more than the required standard, it does not merely affect the protection of the molten metal in the welding process, but also easily generates pores, slag and also of defects, which destroy the quality of welded joints plus boost the burning loss of tungsten electrodes.<br /><br />Argon gas cylinder:<br /><br />Argon gas can be stored plus transported in liquid form coupled with in lower than -184??. Most argon gas for welding is loaded as a gaseous form in cylinders. Each cylinder can be fitted approximately 7000 liter gas. Argon gas cylinders in use are strictly prohibited percussion coupled with collision. they cannot be moved by electromagnetic cranes, coupled with in the summer, it needs to prevent sunlight. Argon gas cylinders cannot be exhausted and then should certainly be placed upright.<br /><br />The precautions of the argon gas cylinder, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5nYXNtYW51ZmFjdHVyZXIuY29tLyZxdW90O3RpdGxlPSZxdW90O2luZHVzdHJpYWwgZ2FzZXM_" target="_blank">industrial gases</a>:<br /><br />1. We cannot try to open the cylinder valve as we wish. 2. We cannot try to open the empty argon gas cylinder valves in un-installed reducing pressure valve condition. 3. We cannot try to open the new argon gas cylinder valves in un-installed reducing pressure valve condition. 4. We cannot try to open argon gas cylinder with the cylinder mouth in front of people or near the wall. 5. The cylinders are best to mount the bracket, to prevent cylinders dumping. 6.

However, when this flammable plus explosive gas mixes with air to a certain concentration, they are going to explode with fire supply. The acetylene has induced some casualties. Causes in the accidents are:<br /><br />The acetylene cylinder together with an oxygen cylinder are in the same location, with no a secure distance. Acetylene cylinders scroll horizontally, and not discharge vertically. The temperature of the surface of the acetylene cylinder is above 40OC. Or the acetylene cylinder fails to leave some considerably more pressure. These will all cause explosions. In line with this, we place forward several hows together with whys in regards to the acetylene cylinders.<br /><br />1. Why should certainly the acetylene cylinders prevent collision?<br />Just after collision, activated carbon crashes, and space increases. So, the acetylene gathers within the high pressure. Simultaneously, the temperature rises, not to mention gaseous acetylene polymerizes. So an explosion is easy to happen.<br /><br />two. Why can't the temperature of the acetylene cylinder be exposed inside the sun?<br />The boiling point from the acetone is 58OC. As the temperature rises, the acetone volatilizes faster, with the larger temperature. In the way, acetylene comes out, together with pressure inside the cylinder will improve substantially.<br /><br />3. Why should really there be some left gas in the acetylene cylinder, when employed up?<br />This is to prevent the mix of your air. Or else an explosion occurs effortlessly with no [url= <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gasmanufacturer.com%26quot%3Btitle%3D%26quot%3Bshielding"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.gasmanufacturer.com&quot;title=&quot;shielding</a> gas economizer]shielding gas economizer[/url].<br /><br />4. What if an acetylene cylinder catches fire?<br /><br />(1) When the fire is modest, you can actually just place a pair of loose gloves or a piece of thick cloth on the flame to put it out.<br /><br />part 2 When the fire happens in the connection, you ought to turn off the valve quickly. In the course of this time, the particular person mustn't stand in front in the fusible plug. The acetylene cylinder have to retain upright.<br /><br />(3) In the event the fire is at the safety valve or the main valve, we need to use a dry powder fire extinguisher or perhaps a carbon dioxide fire extinguisher to put out the fire. At that time, the person might get close to the acetylene cylinder on fire to make sure enough energy to put off the fire.<br /><br />(4) When an acetylene cylinder is on fire, the pressure in the cylinder increases. So, perhaps it will be hard to place out the fire inside a short period of time. At this time, we will need to use a water spray cylinders to do away with the explosion. Or you need just drag the ignition cylinder to a secure spot with ropes.<br /><br />(5) When the burning acetylene cylinder is placed in a poorly ventilated atmosphere, the very first point we should do is taking measures to prevent the fire from spreading. The fire on the acetylene cylinder can burn out itself. In the event the fire is put out by people, the cylinder will emit a large degree of acetylene, as a result causing an explosion or asphyxiation simply.<br /><br />To get the excellent effects, we have to use a acetylene cylinders safely with <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5nYXNtYW51ZmFjdHVyZXIuY29tL2NhdGVnb3J5L2dhcy1jeWxpbmRlci1idW5kbGUuaHRtbCZxdW90O3RpdGxlPSZxdW90O2dhcyBjeWxpbmRlciBidW5kbGU_" target="_blank">gas cylinder bundle</a>.

The <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5nYXNtYW51ZmFjdHVyZXIuY29tL3Byb2R1Y3Qvc2VtaS1hdXRvLXN3aXRjaC1nYXMtY3lsaW5kZXItbWFuaWZvbGQuaHRtbCZxdW90O3RpdGxlPSZxdW90O2NvbXByZXNzZWQgZ2FzIGN5bGluZGVy" target="_blank">compressed gas cylinder</a> has the design pressure larger than or equivalent to 12MPa (125kg/cm2) and is applied for storing compressed gases, which includes oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, air, argon, nitrogen, and so on., which are still within the gaseous state soon after being processing by way of high pressure compression. The liquefied gas cylinder is utilized for storing liquefied gases for instance carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide that are inside the balanced state with vapor right after becoming converted to be liquid and processed via high pressure compression. The dissolved gas cylinder is utilised for storing unsafe gases for instance acetylene which can resolve and explode, and these gases must be dissolved in suitable solvents and stored porous solid materials although they may be processed by high pressure compression.<br /><br />The gas cylinder is used for the storage of extremely toxic gases that include fluorine, chlorine, and so forth. flammable gases like hydrogen, carbon monoxide, etc. and combustion gases for example oxygen, nitrous oxide, etc. and inflammable gases which include nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and so forth. For this reason, the storage and operation in the gas cylinder require some safety understanding. First, the cylinders must be stored inside a cool and dry location which is away from heat sources, and open flame and solarization are prohibited. Secondly, so as to make certain safety, the cylinders really should be marked with logos in numerous colors to ensure that distinct cylinders is not going to be filled with wrong gases. Simultaneously, in order not to mix the accessories, the valves of a number of cylinders have various turning directions in accordance with the various natures on the cylinders.<br /><br />The <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5nYXNtYW51ZmFjdHVyZXIuY29tL3Byb2R1Y3Qvc2VtaS1hdXRvLXN3aXRjaC1nYXMtY3lsaW5kZXItbWFuaWZvbGQuaHRtbCZxdW90O3RpdGxlPSZxdW90O2dhcyBjeWxpbmRlcg__" target="_blank">gas cylinder</a> must be shop in well-ventilated location in order to avert the deterioration of the material in the cylinder. The gas cylinder can not be placed within the sunlight or close to other heat sources because the cylinder can explode when it is in heat atmosphere. There should never be reducible organic materials for instance oily cotton yarn, cotton fabrics, and so forth. close to the gas cylinder. When transporting the gas cylinder, crashing and rolling should certainly be avoided. Valves in the gas cylinders are fragile, and they must be protected.<br /><br />A variety of gas cylinders should be often passed a technical inspection. If serious corrosion or other damage is discovered for the duration of the process of utilizing the gas cylinder, the gas cylinder will need to be tested in advance.

Within the early 1900's right after even more efficient  less high-priced methods were created for synthesizing acetic acid coupled with methanol, charcoal production declined only to become revitalized by the development of the briquette for recreational cooking.<br /><br />Converted to mass production by Ford in the 1920's <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5icmlxdWV0dGVwbGFudC5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvYnJpcXVldHRpbmctbWFjaGluZS5odG1sJnF1b3Q7dGl0bGU9JnF1b3Q7Y2hhcmNvYWwgYnJpcXVldHRlcw__" target="_blank">charcoal briquettes</a> are made of two primary substances, one of which is essentially common lump wood charcoal referred to a char. It truly is added to give the briquette its wood smoke aroma and also simply because it really is easy to ignite. The other major ingredient is coal or anthracite which can be added to create a high temperature and also extended lasting fire.<br /><br />Ash whitening agent is added to let the chef know when the BBQ is ready to cook on (and still men and women burn their food by not being sufficiently patient!) The final ingredients certainly are a starch binding agent  an accelerate.<br /><br />The very first methods inside the manufacturing of briquettes are to prepare both the char and then the coal together with this can be done by diverse methods of controlled burning that drive off the moisture and also volatile components. As soon as total the completed items are pulverized prepared for blending.<br /><br />To produce the briquette, the char and then the coal is mixed inside the correct proportions with the starch binder and additionally fed into a blender exactly where it truly is thoroughly mixed. Regardless of possessing been desiccated, the mix nevertheless has considerable water content material  this is essential to support type the briquettes.<br /><br />The briquettes are formed together with dropped on a conveyor where they pass via a further drying process but being heated up from 40??C to 135??C for about four hours. During this procedure the moisture content in the briquette will decrease from about 35% to 5% and then at the finish they're going to either be stored or pass straight via to an on line bagging <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5icmlxdWV0dGVwbGFudC5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvYnJpcXVldHRpbmctbWFjaGluZS5odG1sJnF1b3Q7dGl0bGU9JnF1b3Q7QnJpcXVldHRpbmcgTWFjaGluZQ__" target="_blank">Briquetting Machine</a>.<br /><br />It is determined by the final item specification but it is in the bagging stage that natural solvent may perhaps be added (making use of an atomizer) just before bagging  this generates instant light briquettes. More often than not these are put into smaller paper bags so that the barbecue enthusiast can just pick up an individually wrapped pack and also light the paper with no getting to eliminate the briquettes from the bag.<br /><br />As a result of the usage of fossil fuels within the manufacture of briquettes and the many heat drying processes involved it really is arguable that lump wood charcoal is more eco-friendly however two points have to be borne in thoughts.<br /><br />The 1st is the fact that the drying process drives off volatile gases together with these gases may be implemented to fuel the driers themselves. Whether this really is fully sustainable I would doubt however the cutting-edge briquette companies do take the atmosphere seriously and then now manufacture their char from wood shavings and then sawdust i.e. the waste goods with the lumber business.

By virtue of material plus humidity content distinction in drying approach, different item indexes also differ. When equipment is installed in several places, there exists different requirement on drying gear material choice, gear form and then manufacturing or installation method. Most drying gear is composed of welding, plate and cylinder. In allusion to various function of anticorrosive process on drying machine, you can find some experiences about it to share.<br /><br /><strong>Phosphating and additionally passivation technology</strong><br />In manufacturing of <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5icmlxdWV0dGVwbGFudC5jb20mcXVvdDt0aXRsZT0mcXVvdDtkcnlpbmcgbWFjaGluZQ__" target="_blank">drying machine</a> regarding vibration fluidized bed, 70 percent of parts are of carbon steel structure. Because of long operation time between processes, there develops abundant rust in surface. It needs plenty of workers to remove rust before painting. Phosphating coupled with passivation engineering is proper the method recovering metal original color plus meanwhile building dens anti-erosion film inside the surface by one-time electronics or electro-chemical reaction. Soon after this course of action, metal will be placed in humid air for tens of days without having rusting. It can be of rather simple operation method, improves operating atmosphere, relieves labor strength  saves labor or material.<br /><br /><strong>Electrostatic powder spraying</strong><br />Classic painting material of dying machine is liquid which includes abundant of ester ketone and additionally hydra-carbon such organic solvent, bringing a considerable of trouble on production, deposition plus construction. What's more, it really is flammable and explosive. Getting poisonous, it seriously pollutes atmosphere when evaporating in to the atmosphere. Subsequently, painting authorities all endeavor to exploit new painting of small solvent or with no solvent. This new type painting is powder spraying. Since this sort powder coating has characteristic of solidity, bearing, great decoration also as excellent outdoor climate resistance not to mention heat resistance, also superior erosion resistance, powder resistant efficiency, nice luster coupled with brightness, electrostatic powder spraying fully suits for erosion resistance on drying machine shell.<br /><br /><strong>Austenitic nickel chrome stainless-steel welding</strong><br />In <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5icmlxdWV0dGVwbGFudC5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvZHJ5aW5nLW1hY2hpbmUuaHRtbCZxdW90O3RpdGxlPSZxdW90O2RyeWVyIG1hY2hpbmU_" target="_blank">dryer machine</a>, there is lots of plate welding structure piece which normally emerge erosion or cracking problem throughout welding. It severely affects product lifetime and additionally application efficiency. Distinction in between austenitic stainless steel not to mention common carbon steel hinges on  bad conductivity, significant expansion coefficient in heating and also high resistance value. In view of those characteristics of austenitic steel, it calls for adopting certain welding technique to weld. Inter-granular erosion is one problem of high alloy steel. This steel has high erosion itself, but erosion decreased during welding. Austenitic steel erosion has whole, partial coupled with inter-granular erosion 3 forms.

The following methods could enable customers to prevent their drying equipment from becoming corroded.<br /><br />About seventy percent from the elements in vibration fluidized bed dryer manufacturing are steel structures. The surface of those steel elements will produce a large number of rust on account of the prolonged turnaround course of action. For that reason, adequate artificial efforts are needed to get rid of the rust ahead of the painting process. Phosphide - passivation approach, attempts to allow the surface of steel components to keep its original metal color coupled with inside the meanwhile produce a dense rust-proofing layer on the surface of your metal through electrical together with electrochemical reaction. Adopting the passivation system could enable the drying machine to become placed in humid atmosphere for nearly ten days without having any rust. This approach is simple to operate, functions efficiently to strengthen the operating atmosphere, reduces coupled with saves labor intensity.<br /><br />The 2nd corrosion protection system is electrostatic powder coating. Traditional paint coating is liquid coupled with contains a large number of natural solvents such as hydrocarbons, incurring a series of troubles not to mention issues for storage, transportation plus construction. Mainly because a lot of the traditional electrostatic powder-coating supplies are toxic plus emitting dangerous substances in to the atmosphere, specialists in this field are endeavoring to develop new environmentally friendly coating supplies and then electrostatic powder is a single of them.
