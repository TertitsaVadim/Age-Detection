Let us hear the Lords reaction, &quot;And Jesus answering explained unto him, experience it to be so now: for thus it becometh us to satisfy all righteousness. Then he endured him. We should all follow the techniques of the apostles as they ended up our forerunners for the gospel of Jesus Christ.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5saWZlc29uZ3B1Ymxpc2hlcnMuY29tL2Jvb2tzL0JBUENPTS5odG1s" target="_blank">homepage</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5saWZlc29uZ3B1Ymxpc2hlcnMuY29tLw__" target="_blank">life song publishers</a>
