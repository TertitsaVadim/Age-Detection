This machine warms up and gets to work quickly, and it cleans parts very efficiently. If you are in need of an effective, economical, and efficient parts cleaner, this is a great option. <br /><br />What is Vapour Degreasing?<br /><br />First, however, you should take a little time to learn about the process of vapour degreasing, if it is unfamiliar to you. Vapour degreasing is simply one way to clean small parts. Manufacturers create parts for a number of reasons. For example, a company might create medical instruments for hospitals. Another company might create screws and bolts for construction. Yet another company might make small parts for engines. <br /><br />In many instances these parts need to be cleaned after they are created so that they can be packaged and sold or so that they can be used in another manufacturing process. For example, the screws will be cleaned and packaged for sale. The engine parts, however, might be used by the same company to create engines. <br /><br />With vapour degreasing, the parts are placed into the parts washer, and a solvent in the parts washer is heated causing it to vaporise. This vapour then clings to the parts and condenses. The condensation drips off of the parts, taking contaminants with it.  <br /><br />The Pero R1<br /><br />The Pero R1 is a vapour degreasing plant that can process up to 1000 kg of steel parts an hour. The single bath unit can process one load of parts every three minutes, and each load can weigh up to 80 kg. The twin bath unit is slightly slower at four minutes per load, but it can clean more parts at one time. This vapour degreasing plant features a fast warm up time of 60 minutes, meaning that you can get the machine running and cleaning parts even faster. <br /><br />While in operation, the machine has a 75 decibel noise level, a 13.2 kW heat output, and it also features an optional ultrasonic unit. You have two options with the ultrasonic unit, and you can choose a 600 watt, 25 kHz, 17 W/l unit or a 1000 watt, 25 kHz, 21.5 W/l unit. This vapour degreasing plant is 2600 mm by 1600 mm by 2550 mm in size, and the maximum basket size that it can accommodate is 530 mm by 320 mm by 200 mm. <br /><br />The Pero R1 is also known as the True Universal Machine because it can handle a number of different types of solvents including specially modified alcohols, hydrocarbons, and chlorinated hydrocarbons. <br /><br />Kumi Solutions <br /><br />If you want to see this machine in action, you should contact Kumi Solutions. They are Pero’s sole supplier in the UK, and they have a variety of parts cleaning, degreasing machines available for sale. In addition to selling these machines, they are happy to show you how they work. You can even bring your own parts to their facility for a demonstration. The Pero R1 vapour degreasing plant can help you to clean your parts quickly, effectively, and easily. <br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2dvbmVnb3RoaWMuY29tL2Jsb2cucGhwP2FjdGlvbj1zYXZlX2VudHJ5" target="_blank">Vapour Degreasing and the Pero R1</a>

This machine warms up and gets to work quickly, and it cleans parts very efficiently. If you are in need of an effective, economical, and efficient parts cleaner, this is a great option. <br /><br />What is Vapour Degreasing?<br /><br />First, however, you should take a little time to learn about the process of vapour degreasing, if it is unfamiliar to you. Vapour degreasing is simply one way to clean small parts. Manufacturers create parts for a number of reasons. For example, a company might create medical instruments for hospitals. Another company might create screws and bolts for construction. Yet another company might make small parts for engines. <br /><br />In many instances these parts need to be cleaned after they are created so that they can be packaged and sold or so that they can be used in another manufacturing process. For example, the screws will be cleaned and packaged for sale. The engine parts, however, might be used by the same company to create engines. <br /><br />With vapour degreasing, the parts are placed into the parts washer, and a solvent in the parts washer is heated causing it to vaporise. This vapour then clings to the parts and condenses. The condensation drips off of the parts, taking contaminants with it.  <br /><br />The Pero R1<br /><br />The Pero R1 is a vapour degreasing plant that can process up to 1000 kg of steel parts an hour. The single bath unit can process one load of parts every three minutes, and each load can weigh up to 80 kg. The twin bath unit is slightly slower at four minutes per load, but it can clean more parts at one time. This vapour degreasing plant features a fast warm up time of 60 minutes, meaning that you can get the machine running and cleaning parts even faster. <br /><br />While in operation, the machine has a 75 decibel noise level, a 13.2 kW heat output, and it also features an optional ultrasonic unit. You have two options with the ultrasonic unit, and you can choose a 600 watt, 25 kHz, 17 W/l unit or a 1000 watt, 25 kHz, 21.5 W/l unit. This vapour degreasing plant is 2600 mm by 1600 mm by 2550 mm in size, and the maximum basket size that it can accommodate is 530 mm by 320 mm by 200 mm. <br /><br />The Pero R1 is also known as the True Universal Machine because it can handle a number of different types of solvents including specially modified alcohols, hydrocarbons, and chlorinated hydrocarbons. <br /><br />Kumi Solutions <br /><br />If you want to see this machine in action, you should contact Kumi Solutions. They are Pero’s sole supplier in the UK, and they have a variety of parts cleaning, degreasing machines available for sale. In addition to selling these machines, they are happy to show you how they work. You can even bring your own parts to their facility for a demonstration. The Pero R1 vapour degreasing plant can help you to clean your parts quickly, effectively, and easily. <br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/jobherman/blog/blogid=10369184" target="_blank">Vapour Degreasing and the Pero R1</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2pvYmhlcm1hbjUxMy5kbXVzaWMubmV0L2pvdXJuYWwvMTI5MTcwNw__" target="_blank">Vapour Degreasing and the Pero R1</a>
