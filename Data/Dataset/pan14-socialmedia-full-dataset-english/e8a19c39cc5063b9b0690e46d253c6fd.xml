<br />	When I met you my heart had been riped so much I felt like I didn't have one
<br />Then came and helped me sew it back up
<br />Now now that all the pices are back in place
<br />although worn in places
<br />You are still helping patch the worn places
<br />My patch quilt heart is yours if you want it
<br />	I know you have been hurt in the past but, if you give me a chance I will prove to you I will treat you with the respect you deserve. I will do my best to love you the way you need to be. I promise you this I wont let your heart break I will be as careful with it as though it is a pricless artifact because to me your heart and the rest of you means every thing. I will protect it as long as you allow me to. I also give you my heart if you accept it. I shall charish your love more than any gem that was ever or will ever be unearthed. If I put my heart in a box and they said I had to trust one person too keep I would choose you if you would accep such a task as would I for you. I would gladly cross over any thing just to be by your side. I would go through the fires of hell just to be with you. If I whent to heaven I would wait at the peral gates then if you whent the other way I would give them back their wings and halo and go to hell to be with you. your love would mean every thing to me I hope you see that now. I would protect your heart from being broken. I would love you now and forever.
<br />this is for the guy i want to be with for the rest of my life you know who you are

<br />And if I'm right we're headed straight for hell
<br /><br />[Chorus:]
<br /><br />I'm goin' home, gonna load my shotgun

<br />He slap my face and he shook me like a rag doll
<br />Don't that sound like a real man
<br />I'm going to show him what a little girls made of
<br />Gunpowder and lead
<br /><br />It's half past ten, another six pack in
<br />And I can feel the rumble like a cold black wind
<br />He pulls in the drive, the gravel flies
<br />He dont know what's waiting here this time
<br /><br />I'm goin' home, gonna load my shotgun
<br />Wait by the door and light a cigarette
<br />If he wants a fight well now he's got one
<br />And he ain't seen me crazy yet
<br />He slap my face and he shook me like a rag doll
<br />Don't that sound like a real man
<br />I'm going to show him what a little girls made of

<br /><br />His fist is big but my gun's bigger
<br />He'll find out when I pull the trigger
<br /><br />I'm goin' home, gonna load my shotgun
<br />Wait by the door and light a cigarette
<br />If he wants a fight well now he's got one
<br />And he ain't seen me crazy yet
<br />He slap my face and he shook me like a rag doll

<br /><br />: --Guys hate sluts even though they have sex with them!
<br />(oh yeah..you're not &quot;popular&quot; if you've slept with more than 6 guys..you're a HOE)
<br /><br />--&quot;Hey, are you busy?&quot; or &quot;Are you doing something?&quot; ~ two phrases guys open with to stop from stammering on the phone.
<br /><br />--Guys may be flirting around all day but before they go to sleep, they always think about the girl they truly care about.
<br /><br />--Before they call, guys try to plan out a little about what they're gonna say so there aren't awkward pauses, but once he's on the phone he forgets it all and makes it up as he goes.
<br /><br />--Guys go crazy over a girl's smile.
<br /><br />--Guys will do anything just to get you to notice him.
<br /><br />--Guys hate it when you talk about your ex-boyfriend or ex love-interest. Unless they're goin for the let-her-complain-to-you-and-then-have-her-realize-- - - - how-wonderful-and-nice-you-are method.
<br /><br />--A guy who likes you wants to be the only guy you talk to.
<br /><br />--Boyfriends need to be reassured often that they're still loved.
<br /><br />--Don't talk about your guy friends to your boyfriend.
<br /><br />--Guys get jealous easily.
<br /><br />--Guys are more emotional than they'd like people to think.
<br /><br />--Giving a guy a hanging message like &quot;You know what?!..uh...nevermind..&quot; would make him jump to a conclusion that is far from what you are thinking. And he'll assume he did something wrong and he'll obsess about it trying to figure it out.
<br /><br />--Guys are good flatterers when courting but they usually stammer when they talk to a girl they really like.
<br /><br />--Guys hate asking parents for money to buy girls presents. So they come up with ideas like saving their lunch money for a week. But it never works because guys are always hungry so they end up asking the parents for money anyway.
<br /><br />--Girls are guys' weaknesses.
<br /><br />--Guys are very open about themselves.
<br /><br />--It's good to test a guy first before you trust him. But don't let him wait too long.
<br /><br />--Your best friend, whom your boyfriend seeks help from about his problems with you may end up being admired by your boyfriend.
<br /><br />--If a guy tells you about his problems, he just needs someone to listen to him. You don't need to give advice.
<br /><br />--A usual act that proves that the guy likes you is when he teases you.
<br /><br />--Guys love you more than you love them if they are serious in your relationships.
<br /><br />--Guys will brag about anything.
<br /><br />--Guys use words like hot or cute to describe girls. We rarely use beautiful.If a guy uses that, he likes you a whole hell of a lot.
<br /><br />--No matter how much guys talk about asses and boobs, personality is key.
<br /><br />--Guys learn from experience not from the romance books that girls read and take as their basis of experience.
<br /><br />--Guys worry about the thin line between being compassionate and being whipped.
<br /><br />--Guys think WAY too much. One small thing a girl does, even if she doesn't notice it can make the guy think about it for hours, trying to figure out what it meant.
<br /><br />--Guys seek for advice from girls not other guys. Because most guys think alike, so if one guy's confused, then we're all confused.
<br /><br />--Any guy could write out a rulebook or advice book for flirting, but no guy can write out a book about relationships.
<br /><br />--Try to be as straightforward as possible.
<br /><br />--If the guy does something stupid in front of the girl, he will think about it for the next couple days or until the next time he spends time with the girl.
<br /><br />--If a guy looks unusually calm and laid back, he's probably faking it and is spazzing inside.
<br /><br />--When a guy says he is going crazy about the girl, he really is. Guys rarely say that.
<br /><br />--When a guy asks you to leave him alone, he's just actually saying, &quot;Please come and listen to me.&quot;
<br /><br />--Guys don't really have final decisions.
<br /><br />--If a guy starts to talk seriously, listen to him. It doesn't happen that often, so when it does, you know something's up.
<br /><br />--If your best guy friend seems to avoid you or is never around when you're with your boyfriend, he's probably jealous and likes you.
<br /><br />--When a guy tells you that you are beautiful, don't say you aren't. It makes them want to stop telling you because they don't want you to disagree with them.
<br /><br />--When a guy looks at you for longer than a second, he's definitely thinking something.
<br /><br />--Guys like femininity not feebleness.
<br /><br />--Guys don't like girls who punch harder than they do.
<br /><br />--A guy has more problems than you can see with your naked eyes.
<br /><br />--Don't be a snob. Guys can be intimidated and give up easily.
<br /><br />--Everything in moderation. Put on makeup, wear perfume. Just not too much.
<br /><br />--Guys talk about girls more than girls talk about guys.
<br /><br />--Guys hate rejection, but they hate being led on even more.
<br /><br />--If you are going to reject a guy, just do it. Don't say they are like a brother or just good friends, it just hurts even more. Tell them that you aren't interested in a relationship and they will respect you.
<br /><br />--Guys really think that girls are strange and have unpredictable decisions and are MAD confusing but somehow are drawn even more to them.
<br /><br />--A guy would give his left nut to be able to read a girl's mind for a day.
<br /><br />--No guy can handle all his problems on his own. He's just too stubborn to admit it.
<br /><br />--Not all guys are assholes. Just because ONE is a jackass doesnt mean he represents ALL of us.
<br /><br />--We don't like girls who are too skinny.
<br /><br />--We love it when girls talk about there boobs.
<br /><br />--Always make sure you know what kind of stuff your getting into before making out with a guy ...like wheather it's a one time deal or not ....
<br /><br />--Believe it or not shy guys are the most easiest to talk to..it may not seem right but trust me they will start opening up like books after you just ask them questions about their lives and unoticable tell them about yours...
<br /><br />--When a guy hits your butt it means that he wants you sexually
<br /><br />--Even if they refuse it all guys are ticklish on the ribs..
<br /><br />--Guys love neck rubs and if he lets you keep doing it ..it means that he really likes you or his neck really hurts...
<br /><br />--Guys will test the waters to see how far they can get with you. Even if he doesn't intend to it will happen. Know how far it is you want to let him go and he will respect that...after you let him know a couple times.
<br /><br />--When a guy sacrifices his sleep and health just to be with you, he really likes you and wants to be with you as much as possible.

<br />She leaves a note for her family
<br />Then she takes the knife to her wrist
<br />It will be morning before they find her 
<br />By then it will be to late 
<br />Her last thought is I love him to death

<br />Then You Had Better Read On...
<br />One day a teacher asked her students to list the names of the other students in the room on two sheets of paper, leaving a space between each name.
<br />Then she told them to think of the nicest thing they could say about each of their classmates and write it down.
<br />It took the remainder of the class period to finish their assignment, and as the students left the room, each one handed in the papers.
<br />That Saturday, the teacher wrote down the name of each student on a separate sheet of paper, and listed what everyone else had said about that individual.
<br />On Monday she gave each student his or her list.. Before long, the entire class was smiling. 'Really?' she heard whispered. 'I never knew that I meant anything to anyone!' and, 'I didn't know others liked me so much,' were most of the comments.
<br />No one ever mentioned those papers in class again. She never knew if they discussed them after class or with their parents, but it didn't matter. The exercise had accomplished its purpose. The students were happy with themselves and one another. That group of students moved on.
<br />Several years later, one of the students was killed in Viet Nam and his teacher attended the funeral of that special student. She had never seen a serviceman in a military coffin before. He looked so handsome, so mature.
<br />The church was packed with his friends. One by one those who loved him took a last walk by the coffin. The teacher was the last one to bless the coffin.
<br />As she stood there, one of the soldiers who acted as pallbearer came up to her. 'Were you Mark's math teacher?' he asked. She nodded: 'yes.' Then he said: 'Mark talked about you a lot.'
<br />After the funeral, most of Mark's former classmates went together to a luncheon. Mark's mother and father were there, obviously waiting to speak with his teacher.
<br />'We want to show you something,' his father said, taking a wallet out of his pocket 'They found this on Mark when he was killed. We thought you might recognize it.'
<br />Opening the billfold, he carefully removed two worn pieces of notebook paper that had obviously been taped, folded and refolded many times. The teacher knew without looking that the papers were the ones on which she had listed all the good things each of Mark's classmates had said about him.
<br />'Thank you so much for doing that,' Mark's mother said. 'As you can see, Mark treasured it.'
<br />All of Mark's former classmates started to gather around. Charlie smiled rather sheepishly and said, 'I still have my list. It's in the top drawer of my desk at home.'
<br />Chuck's wife said, 'Chuck asked me to put his in our wedding album.'
<br />'I have mine too,' Marilyn said. 'It's in my diary'
<br />Then Vicki, another classmate, reached into her pocketbook, took out her wallet and showed her worn and frazzled list to the group. 'I carry this with me at all times,' Vicki said and without batting an eyelash, she continued: 'I think we all saved our lists'
<br />That's when the teacher finally sat down and cried. She cried for Mark and for all his friends who would never see him again.
<br />The density of people in society is so thick that we forget that life will end one day. And we don't know when that one day will be.
<br />So please, tell the people you love and care for, that they are special and important. Tell them, before it is too late.
<br />And One Way To Accomplish This Is: Forward this message on. If you do not send it, you will have, once again passed up the wonderful opportunity to do something nice and beautiful.
<br />If you've received this, it is because someone cares for you and it means there is probably at least someone for whom you care.
<br />If you're 'too busy' to take those few minutes right now to forward this message on, would this be the VERY first time you didn't do that little thing that would make a difference in your relationships?
<br />The more people that you send this to, the better you'll be at reaching out to those you care about.
<br />Remember, you reap what you sow. What you put into the lives of others comes back into your own.
<br /><br />This is for all my friends i care about you guys
<br />If you agree with this, pass it on.

<br />Why is when you fall in love so hard some thing comes around and takes it from you?
<br />Why do people play games with others hearts?
<br />When they know how much someone truly loves them and would lay their life in the line for them in a heart beat.
<br />But it was all just a game to them to see how long it took them to change some one
<br />When they fall for the person know how much they love them they turn and try to leave but can't because they don't want to break someones heart
<br />IF any one will pleas help me figure these things out because I'm completely lost
