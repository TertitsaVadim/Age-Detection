<br />READ THIS:
<br /><br />Isnt it funny that when you go to the shops with your friends you look down at the person with black jeans and studs but smile at the girl wearing a a mini with a tshirt that barely cover anything?
<br /><br />Isnt it funny you can change your music taste to impress a guy but when it comes to a person who likes there own music and her own style, you give them a mouthful?
<br /><br />ISNT IT FUNNY that a idiot can get away with being a gangsta but the emo gets a mouthful from everyone
<br /><br />are you laughing?
<br /><br />Isnt it funny a emo can be quiet all through the week but gets more shit from everyone than the girl who sleeps around and sells her virginity?
<br /><br />ISNT IT FUNNY that you dont mind your friends drinking, smoking but the minute someone mentions emo music you can give them a lecture on melodramatic teenage outcasts?
<br /><br />im not laughing.
<br /><br />ITS SO FUNNY that you and your friends can make a perons life hell and not know anything about the silent battle they might be fighting.
<br /><br />ISNT IT FUNNY that you can call emos, punks, goths the retards but still manage to get through your day without an inch of guilt in your heart.
<br /><br />HOW YOU CAN CALL A EMO A POSER, HOW CAN YOU SAY &quot;YOUR NOT EMO&quot; OR &quot;ATTENTION SEEKER&quot; WITHOUT SPENDING A SECOND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHY THERE ARE CUTS ON THEIR WRISTS AND WHY they SPEND THEIR LUNCHTIMES CRYING INSTEAD OR LAUGHING WITH THEIR FRIENDS
<br /><br />KEEP ON LAUGHING
<br /><br />isnt it funny you can say and do all this without any idea of what is going on in this persons life
<br /><br />without knowing their situation with her friends
<br /><br />or their family
<br /><br />or their LIFE
<br /><br />BRAVE ISNT GOING UP ON STAGE AND STRIPPING
<br /><br />BRAVE IS NOT SAYING A SPEECH
<br /><br />OR DUMPING YOUR BOYFRIEND/GIRLFRIEND
<br /><br />BRAVE IS
<br /><br />GOING TO SCHOOL ON MUFTI DAY AND NOT FOR A SECOND CARE WHAT THE WHORES AROUND YOU ARE SAYING ABOUT YOUR CLOTHES
<br /><br />ITS LISTENING TO YOUR OWN MUSIC AND BEING PROUD OF IT
<br /><br />ITS GOING THROUGH EVERY DAY WITH THE THINGS PEOPLE SAY TO YOUR FACE AND BEHIND YOUR BACK AND YOU STILL KEEP QUIET
<br /><br />ITS KNOWING WHAT YOUR &quot;FRIENDS&quot; ARE SAYING ABOUT YOU AND STILL CALLING THEM YOUR FRIENDS
<br /><br />BRAVE IS KNOWING THAT TOMOROW ISNT A BRIGHT AND HAPPY FUTURE
<br /><br />ITS ANOTHER DAY OF BITCHING AND DODGING RUMORS
<br /><br />KEEP ON LAUGHING.
<br /><br />if you agree put this on ur blog
<br /><br />and advise others to do so

<br />She hated everyone, except her loving boyfriend. He's always there for
<br />her. She said that if she could only see the world, she would marry her
<br />boyfriend.
<br />One day, someone donated a pair of eyes to her and then she can see
<br />everything, including her boyfriend. Her boyfriend asked her, &quot;now that you
<br />can see the world, will you marry me?&quot;
<br /><br />The girl was shocked when she saw that her boyfriend is blind too, and
<br />refused to marry him. Her boyfriend walked away in tears, and later wrote a
<br />letter to her saying. &quot;Just take care of my eyes, dear.&quot;
<br /><br />This is how humans change when their status changes. Only few remember
<br />what life was before, and who has always been there in the most painful
<br />situations.
<br /><br />Today before you think of saying an unkind word,
<br />think of someone who can't speak.
<br /><br />Before you complain about the taste of your food,
<br />think of someone who has nothing to eat.
<br /><br />Before you complain about your husband or wife,
<br />think of someone who's crying out to God for a companion.
<br /><br />Today before you complain about life,
<br />think of someone who went too early to heaven.
<br /><br />Before you complain about your children,
<br />think of someone who desires children but they're barren.
<br /><br />Before you argue about your dirty house that someone didn't clean or
<br />sweep, think of the people who are living in the streets.
<br /><br />Before whining about the distance you drive,
<br />think of someone who walks the same distance with their feet.
<br /><br />And when you are tired and complain about your job,
<br />think of the unemployed, the disabled and those who wished they had your
<br />job.
<br /><br />But before you think of pointing the finger or condemning another,
<br />remember that not one of us are without sin and we all answer to one
<br />Maker.
<br /><br />And when depressing thoughts seem to get you down,
<br />put a smile on your face and thank God you're alive and still around

<br /><br />I wonder if you see what is that you want to see,
<br />Or do you see me?
<br />I wonder if you see what it is that you want me to be,
<br />Or do you see underneath?  	
<br />I wonder if you even care what I look like inside,
<br />Or can you only see my beautiful hazel eyes? 
<br />I wonder why I care about what you see,
<br />Shouldn’t it only matter to me? 
<br />I tell you I don’t care how you see me, front to back top to bottom,
<br />Shouldn’t it only matter to me?
<br />I wonder why I care what you say to me,
<br />When you don’t even know me.
<br />I wonder why it hurts so bad when you look through me,
<br />When you haven’t even asked my name.
<br />So where do I place the blame?
<br />On me who cares to much about what you think,
<br />Or you who looks before thinks? 
<br />I tell you what I’m going to do,
<br />I’m going to look at all of you, top to bottom front to back,
<br />And I’m going to ask you your name,
<br />So that way you never have to feel this pain.
<br />I love everyone so why am I so judged?
