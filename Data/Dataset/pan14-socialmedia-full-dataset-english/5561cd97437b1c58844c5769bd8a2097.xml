<br />Reachin for the phone cause I can't fight it anymore
<br />And I wonder if I ever crossed your mind
<br />For me it happens all the time
<br /><br />It's a quarter after one, I'm all alone and I need you now
<br />Said I wouldn't call but I lost all control and I need you now
<br />And I don't know how I can do without
<br />I just need you now
<br /><br />Another shot of whiskey can't stop looking at the door
<br />Wishing you'd come sweeping in the way you did before
<br />And I wonder if I ever cross your mind
<br />To me it happens all the time
<br /><br />It's a quarter after one, I'm a little drunk and I need you now
<br />Said I wouldn't call but I lost all control and I need you now
<br />And I don't know how I can do without
<br />I just need you now
<br /><br />Guess I'd rather hurt than feel nothin at all
<br /><br />It's a quarter after one I'm all alone and I need you now
<br /><br />And I said I wouldn't call but I'm a little drunk and I need you now
<br /><br />And I don't know how I can do without
<br /><br />I just need you now
<br /><br />I just need you now
<br /><br />Ooo, baby, I need you now

<br />Trying to forget but I won't let go
<br />Looking at a crowded street
<br />Listening to my own heart beat
<br /><br />So many people all around the world
<br />Tell me where do I find someone like you girl
<br /><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/143096861_1406313_34632581.jpg" />
<br />Take me to your heart, take me to your soul
<br />Give me your hand before I'm old
<br />Show me what love is - haven't got a clue
<br />Show me that wonders can be true
<br /><br />They say nothing lasts forever
<br />We're only here today
<br />Love is now or never
<br />Bring me far away
<br /><br />Take me to your heart take me to your soul
<br />Give me your hand and hold me
<br />Show me what love is - be my guiding star
<br />It's easy take me to your heart
<br /><br />Standing on a mountain high
<br />Looking at the moon through a clear blue sky
<br />I should go and see some friends
<br />But they don't really comprehend
<br /><br />Don't need too much talking without saying anything
<br />All I need is someone who makes me wanna sing
<br /><br />Take me to your heart take me to your soul
<br />Give me your hand before I'm old
<br />Show me what love is - haven't got a clue
<br />Show me that wonders can be true

<br />Someone told me I should take
<br />Caution when it comes to love
<br />I did, I did-------
<br /><br />And you were strong and I was not
<br />My illusion, my mistake
<br />I was careless, I forgot
<br />I did
<br /><br />And now when all is done
<br />There is nothing to say
<br />You have gone and so effortlessly
<br />You have won
<br />You can go ahead tell them
<br /><br />Tell them all I know now
<br />Shout it from the roof tops
<br />Write it on the sky line
<br />All we had is gone now
<br /><br />Tell them I was happy
<br />And my heart is broken
<br />All my scars are open
<br />Tell them what I hoped would be
<br />Impossible, impossible
<br />Impossible, impossible
<br /><br />Falling out of love is hard
<br />Falling for betrayal is worst
<br />Broken trust and broken hearts
<br />I know, I know--------
<br /><br />Thinking all you need is there
<br />Building faith on love and words
<br />Empty promises will wear
<br />I know, I know--------
<br /><br />And now when all is gone
<br />There is nothing to say
<br />And if you're done with embarrassing me
<br />On your own you can go ahead tell them

<br />Even the good can be a curse (curse)
<br />Makes it hard to know which road to go down
<br />Knowing too much can get you hurt.
<br /><br />Is it better? Is it worse?
<br />Always sitting in reverse
<br />It's just like we're going backwards. (backwards)
<br /><br />I know where I want this to go
<br />Driving fast but lets go slow
<br />What I don't wanna do is crash nooo.
<br /><br />Just know you're not in this thing alone
<br />There's always a place in me that you can call home
<br />Whenever you feel like we're growing apart
<br />Let's just go back, back, back, back, back to the start.oh
<br /><br />Anything that's worth having
<br />Is sure enough worth fighting for
<br />Quiting's out of the question
<br />When it gets tough, gotta fight some more.
<br /><br />We gotta fight, fight, fight, fight, fight for this love
<br />We gotta fight, fight, fight, fight, fight for this love
<br />If it's' worth having, it's worth fighting for oh-oh-oh
<br /><br />Now everyday ain't gon' be no picnic
<br />Love aint a walk in the park
<br />All you can do is make the best of it now
<br />Can't be afraid of the dark.

<br />We just need to slow down
<br />And just ro-o-o-o-o-oll.
