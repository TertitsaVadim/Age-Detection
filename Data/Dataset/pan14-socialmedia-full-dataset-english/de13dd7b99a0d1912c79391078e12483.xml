You shall keep them, O LORD, you shall preserve them from this generation forever.&quot; Psalm 12:6-7 (NKJ) 
<br /><br />Matthew 27:51-54 
<br /><br />&quot;And behold, the veil of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom, and the earth shook; and the rocks were split...&quot; 
<br /><br />&quot;...and the tombs were opened; and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised...&quot; 
<br /><br />&quot;...and coming out of the tombs after His (Jesus') resurrection they entered the holy city and appeared to many
<br /><br />pastormary2: the Kingdom of God. John 3:3
<br /><br />How do we get to heaven? Humility, repentance, and faith in God are what we need to become part of God's kingdom. Jesus says we must become like little children if we are to enter. Do you have childlike faith?
<br /><br />~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 
<br />He is knocking at YOUR hearts door,
<br />Let Him in while there is still time
<br /><br />pastormary2: Of all the friends I've ever met, 
<br />You're the one I won't forget. 
<br />And if I die 
<br />Before you do 
<br />I'll go to heaven 
<br />And wait for you 
<br />I'll give the angels 
<br />Back their wings 
<br />And risk the loss 
<br />Of everything 
<br />Just to prove 
<br />My friendship is true 
<br />I'm thankful to have 
<br />Family and Friends like you! 
<br /><br />SEND THIS TO ALL YOUR FAMILY &amp; FRIENDS 
<br />AND BACK TO THE PERSON WHO SENT IT TO YOU.. 
<br />IF YOU GET IT BACK... 
<br />THAT PERSON IS YOUR TRUE FRIEND!!

<br />7) GET A KISS AND A BIG HUG 
<br />8) GET KISSED&amp; HUGGED 
<br />9) GET ALL THE ABOVE AND WHATEVER YOU WANT!! 
<br /><br />pastormary2: Faith that works is faith that cares
<br />trusting in the Lord  each day,
<br />Faith that believes in a God of miracles
<br />will reach the throne of God, as we pray.
<br /><br />Faith with works is alive.
<br />God can be felt in the depths of your soul,
<br />When  faith is extended toward heaven,
<br />God's hand reaches to the earth below.
<br /><br />Faith is the substance of things hoped for
<br />the evidence of things not yet seen,
<br />When we believe with all of our heart,
<br />We find faith works, as on Jesus we lean.
<br /><br />Trust in the Lord with all your heart
<br />knowing you can receive,
<br />All things are possible to those
<br />who abide in the Savior and believe
<br /><br />pastormary2: I find then a law, that, when I do good,
<br />evil is present with me.
<br />For I delight in the law of God
<br />after the inward man:
<br />But I see another law in my members,
<br />warring against the law of my mind,
<br />and bringing me into captivity
<br />to the law of sin which is in my members.
<br />O wretched man that I am! . . .
<br />Romans 7:21-24a
<br /><br />Rondal James: Verse of the Day 
<br /><br />“You, my brothers, were called to be free. But do not use your freedom to indulge the sinful nature; rather, serve one another in love.” (Galatians 5:13)    (Read by Max McLean. Provided by Zondervan.)

<br />pastormary2: REST IN THE LORD, AND WAIT PATIENTLY FOR HIM.
<br />                           ( PSALM 37:7 *NKJV )
<br /><br />pastormary2: In this World today patience is hard to find.  After all,
<br />   we have become accustomed to instant everything, from
<br />   T V dinners to instant mail via computer.  Thus patience
<br />   has almost become a lost art today!
<br /><br />It is important to remember that patience is a virtue.
<br />   So whatever you try to accomplish, do it with hard work
<br />   and patience.  For true accomplishments do not occur
<br />   easily or instantly!  For it is written: DO NOT BECOME
<br />   SLUGGISH, BUT IMITATE THOSE WHO THROUGH 
<br />   FAITH AND PATIENCE INHERIT THE PROMISES.  
<br />   ( HEBREWS 6:12 )
<br /><br />pastormary2: always put your trust in the Lord, work hard, 
<br />   and have patience.  For the only place where &quot;success&quot;
<br />   comes before &quot;work&quot; is in Webster's Dictionary!   Also 
<br />   remember that through the patience of many a great man 
<br />   or woman, truly wonderful things have been developed to
<br />   improve our lives today!
<br /><br />Therefore, MAY THE GOD OF PATIENCE AND
<br />   COMFORT GRANT YOU TO BE LIKE MINDED TOWARD
<br />   ONE ANOTHER, ACCORDING TO CHRIST JESUS, THAT 
<br />   YOU MAY WITH ONE MIND AND ONE MOUTH GLORIFY
<br />   THE GOD AND FATHER OF OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST.    
<br />   And, MAY THE LORD DIRECT YOUR HEART INTO
<br />   THE LOVE OF GOD AND INTO THE PATIENCE OF
<br />   CHRIST, and may you have a great Tuesday as well.  
<br />   Amen.        ( ROMANS 15:5-6 ) &amp; ( 2 THES 3:4-5 )
<br /><br />pastormary2: Although you have not seen him, you love him; and even though you do not see him now, you believe in him and rejoice with an indescribable and glorious joy.” I Peter 1:8 (NRSV) 
<br /><br />Rondal James: AMEN
<br />pastormary2: Begin to intently watch for God’s work in your life. He cares for you and is at work!
<br /><br />Reflections:  
<br /><br />What parts of my life or activities have the effect of diminishing God and His power in my thoughts? 
<br /><br />Have I allowed myself to receive God’s love for me personally or have I kept God at an “arms length”?
<br /><br />Rondal James: Sorry for delay in replying

<br />pastormary2: What glorious peace,
<br />What blessed hope!
<br />I am my Lord's and He is mine.
<br />Wondrous love, O joy divine!
<br /><br />Kneeling in prayer,
<br />His sweet face I see,

<br /><br />He calls me by name
<br />As I bow at His feet;
<br />And I linger in His presence,
<br />Rapt in ecstasy sweet.
<br /><br />pastormary2: Father of all people, fill us with your powerful Holy Spirit, enable us to be effective in sharing our faith, and motivate us to reach our city, our region, and our world with the Gospel. I still believe, Father, that you desire to do in our day what happened long ago. Make your Name great. Exalt your holiness in the eyes of all people. Use me and the rest of your people to accomplish your will of reaching all nations with the Gospel of grace. In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I pray. Amen. .love mary

<br />MAY OUR FRIENDSHIP NEVER COME APART ESPECIALLY WHEN IT'S STRAIGHT FROM THE HEART! 
<br />MAY YOU ALWAYS HAVE A RAINBOW OF SMIL ES ON YOUR FACE AND IN YOUR HEART FOREVER AND EVER! 
<br />FRIENDS FOREVER! 
<br />Forward this to at least 7 people and see what happens on your screen . you will laugh your head off!!!!!!!!!!! 
<br />If you forward it to 7 people a video comes on your screen. 
<br />This works. I don't know how...but it works.

Sing unto the LORD, bless his name; shew forth his salvation from day to day. Declare his glory among the heathen, his wonders among all people.
<br />Rev. Theresa Bloodgood: Psalms 96:4-7  For the LORD is great, and greatly to be praised: he is to be feared above all gods. For all the gods of the nations are idols: but the LORD made the heavens. Honour and majesty are before him: strength and beauty are in his sanctuary. Give unto the LORD, O ye kindreds of the people, give unto the LORD glory and strength.

O worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness: fear before him, all the earth.  Say among the heathen that the LORD reigneth: the world also shall be established that it shall not be moved: he shall judge the people righteously. Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad; let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof.
<br />Rev. Theresa Bloodgood: Psalms 96:12-13  Let the field be joyful, and all that is therein: then shall all the trees of the wood rejoice Before the LORD: for he cometh, for he cometh to judge the earth: he shall judge the world with righteousness, and the people with his truth.

<br /><br />Hello my family. I have been doing a lot of thinking and praying about something that God has placed upon my spirit these past few days. I feel that it is time to put my thoughts down so maybe others could see if God has been speaking to them also. 
<br /><br />Have you stopped and taken the time to really look at your life? I mean really looked at the way you live.
<br /><br />I am talking now to the folks who say they are a child of God, a christian.
<br /><br />Everyone that I have talked to believes in their spirits that God is going to be sending His son Jesus Christ very soon to call His people home. But, in believing this I wonder, has it changed how we live each day? Or do we believe it and still go about doing as we always do, believing that we will be ready to go when Jesus comes? 
<br /><br />When we are in our own homes how do we live? How do we speak? Do we speak to each other as we would talk to God or Jesus? Do we act towards each other as we would treat God and Jesus if they were in person in our own homes? Do we watch tv or read books that God and Jesus would read. or would we hid them and turn off the tv or turn it to a christian station or a station that had nothing that would offend them? Would we say words that would offend them if they heard us? 
<br /><br />When we are on the computer do we go to places that we would be ashamed for Jesus to see or even for our christian brothers and sisters? Do we talk about others and bring them down or do we build them up? Are we honest with all those that we send email to or do we try and cheat them out of things that should not be ours? Do we use the computer to do the will of God and Jesus or do we waste our time doing things that will not edify others? 
<br /><br />Well, my friend, if we are what we say we are, a christian, a child of God, then doesn't God and Jesus truly live in our homes and our computers as well as in our hearts always? 
<br /><br />When we leave our homes we seem to change into a different person. One more holyer and Godlyer than when we are in our own homes. But why do we have to change? Why can't we be just the same in our home as when we go out to meet others or go to church? 
<br />That is how God and Jesus wants us to be. His children always no matter where we might be. 
<br /><br />We must talk and walk each moment of our lives with God and Jesus. We must live our lives with God and Jesus with in us always. Others must see God and Jesus in us. That means the ones that live in our homes with us. Especially if we have unsaved ones living in our homes. For out of your mouth spews the lake of fire or the light of heaven! Which one do you want God and Jesus to see and Hear? 
<br /><br />I am not writing this to condemn anyone. For I to have been guilty of some of these things. And we can not use the excuse that God knows I am trying. We must think before we speak. We never know who we may offend. And God said that if it offends my brother then I am not to do it. And if it offends my God and Jesus then I am not to do it either. No one can tell you how you must live. That is between you and God and Jesus. All that we can do is show you what God and Jesus tells us to show you and the rest is up to you. 
<br /><br />I thank God for this lesson for it truly has opened my eyes also. God bless each of you and keep you in His loving arms. Your sister in Christ Reverend Barbara J. Williams June 5, 2007

<br /><br />What issues boggle your mind? What decisions slow you down? Bring these matters continually before the Lord. Patiently persevere in waiting for his answer, and it will come! He may not zap you to your destination, but he'll guide you along the way.
<br /><br />pastormary2: When the sun is shining brightly
<br />and our life is going smoothly,
<br />we find it easy to smile and be pleased,
<br />to praise God and give Him thanks.
<br /><br />But it's when the clouds are the darkest,
<br />when we should draw closer to God.
<br />For He is the silver lining in every cloud ~
<br />the Light in the center of our world.

<br /><br />Proverbs 13:20
<br />Walk with the wise and become wise;
<br />      Associate with fools and get in trouble.
<br /><br />The old saying &quot;A rotten apple spoils the bunch&quot; is often applied to friendships, and with good reason. Our friends and associates affect us, sometimes profoundly. Be careful whom you choose as your closest friends. Spend time with people you want to be like because you and your friends will surely grow to resemble each other.
<br /><br />Glorious Heavenly Father, Creator of all things, we thank You for Your Word to us today. May we place around us friends who we want to be like. Friends who will help us build our relationship with You. Friends who will pray for us, be there to listen to us, and encourage us as we continue our daily journey with You. Thank You Lord for our godly friends. In Jesus' Name, Amen..

<br /><br />Knowing, Believing, &amp; Trusting In God's Word Is The Beginning of the
<br />Eternal Relationship...
<br /><br />June 9th
<br /><br />Everyone who asks receives . . . —Luke 11:10
<br /><br />Ask if you have not received. There is nothing more difficult than
<br />asking. We will have yearnings and desires for certain things, and even
<br />suffer as a result of their going unfulfilled, but not until we are at
<br />the limit of desperation will we ask. It is the sense of not being
<br />spiritually real that causes us to ask. Have you ever asked out of the
<br />depths of your total insufficiency and poverty? &quot;If any of you lacks
<br />wisdom, let him ask of God . . . &quot; (James 1:5), but be sure that you do
<br />lack wisdom before you ask. You cannot bring yourself to the point of
<br />spiritual reality anytime you choose. The best thing to do, once you
<br />realize you are not spiritually real, is to ask God for the Holy
<br />Spirit, basing your request on the promise of Jesus Christ (see Luke
<br />11:13). The Holy Spirit is the one who makes everything that Jesus did
<br />for you real in your life.
<br /><br />&quot;Everyone who asks receives . . . .&quot; This does not mean that you will
<br />not get if you do not ask, but it means that until you come to the
<br />point of asking, you will not receive from God (seeMatthew 5:45). To be
<br />able to receive means that you have to come into the relationship of a
<br />child of God, and then you comprehend and appreciate mentally, morally,
<br />and with spiritual understanding, that these things come from God.
<br /><br />&quot;If any of you lacks wisdom . . . .&quot; If you realize that you are
<br />lacking, it is because you have come in contact with spiritual reality—
<br />do not put the blinders of reason on again. The word ask actually means
<br />&quot;beg.&quot; Some people are poor enough to be interested in their poverty,
<br />and some of us are poor enough spiritually to show our interest. Yet we
<br />will never receive if we ask with a certain result in mind, because we
<br />are asking out of our lust, not out of our poverty. A pauper does not
<br />ask out of any reason other than the completely hopeless and painful
<br />condition of his poverty. He is not ashamed to beg— blessed are the
<br />paupers in spirit (see Matthew 5:3).

<br /><br />Rev. Theresa Bloodgood: The Trinity
<br />Notes on the Trinity 
<br /><br />by &quot;Richard Young&quot; (<a href="/go/messages/send/receiver=richard_e_young@hotmail.com">richard_e_young@hotmail.com</a>)
<br />These notes briefly comment on the idea of Jesus being God in human flesh and the idea of the trinity (the One God consisting of three persons).
<br />The unique thing about Jesus is that he was fully man and fully God. That is, He is God come in the flesh. So, just as the tabernacle was the place where God dwelt among the Israelis so was Jesus. That is why John wrote:
<br />&quot;And the Word [i.e., God - see John 1:1] became flesh, and dwelt among us, and we saw His glory, glory as of the only begotten from the Father, full of grace and truth.&quot; (John 1:14).
<br /><br />Rev. Theresa Bloodgood: In the Old Testament we see God clothe Himself in a cloud, a pillar of fire (see Ex 13:21), and as a man when He appeared to Abraham (see Gen 18). [Jesus was tempted but without sin, His death was because He was punished for our sins which were put upon Him, I'll not dwell on this aspect of the incarnation but go into the main idea of the trinity].
<br />The concept of the &quot;trinity&quot; is that God consists of three persons who are one in being and nature. The concept of the &quot;trinity&quot; is not something that one just reads a verse or two and says &quot;so there it is!&quot; The word itself is not a translation of any word or phrase found in the Bible. The concept is derived and &quot;falls out&quot; of the evidence. Without Jesus' revelation when He was on earth I would say that the idea of the trinity would b
<br />Rev. Theresa Bloodgood: Without Jesus' revelation when He was on earth I would say that the idea of the trinity would be difficult to determine from the Hebrew Scriptures, for after all, Deuteronomy 6:4 states &quot;the LORD is one.&quot; But, because of Jesus, we are forced to re-examine our first impression understanding of this statement. Here are the pieces:
<br />(1) Jesus speaks to the Father in the second person. Jesus refers to the Father and the Holy Spirit in the third person. Jesus refers to His will being distinct from His Father's &quot;not my will but yours be done.&quot;
<br /><br />(2) The Father, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit are all referred to as God. Each is described as deserving of worship by us something only God Himself is worthy of.
<br /><br />(3) The Scriptures clearly teach that &quot;the LORD is one&quot; and that there are &quot;none bes
<br />Rev. Theresa Bloodgood: From these pieces the idea of God's nature being more complex than we would have imagined emerges. The question then needs to be addressed as to exactly what &quot;one&quot; means in Deuteronomy 6:4. Consider what Jesus said about His relationship to the Father. Jesus said that He and the Father were one (see John 17:22). Jesus wants us to be one as He is one with the Father. Further, when God created man and woman He desired that they be united as &quot;one flesh&quot; (Gen 2:24). This could not simply be a reference to the bearing of children, which are in a sense, a one flesh result of their union. It must refer to the marriage itself, for certainly they were &quot;one flesh&quot; before they bore any children. 
<br />Rev. Theresa Bloodgood: . This concept of &quot;one&quot; then does not then refer to a uniform or homogeneous state of being; men and women are very different (despite what some feminists would have you believe) and the members of the body of Christ are also very different. Individuals who are united in marriage do not lose their individual traits, such as their own thoughts, emotions, etc. And a married couple does not have the same blood type after they were married if their blood types were different before they were married. If the members of the body of Christ were to become a &quot;uniform and homogeneous&quot; being then we each would lose our identity as &quot;self&quot; and what would emerge would be something akin to an eastern religious &quot;cosmic consciousness.&quot; The &quot;oneness&quot; must refer not to a homogeneous singularity. 
<br />Rev. Theresa Bloodgood: The oneness of the marriage and the body of Christ are reflective of the nature of God Himself.
<br />What exactly does &quot;oneness&quot; then mean? The Hebrew word used for God as one &quot;echad.&quot; Echad can mean one as in &quot;one goat,&quot; &quot;one day,&quot; &quot;one stone,&quot; etc. However, it can also refer to a plural unity such as in a composite whole. For example, in Num 13:23 echad refers to a cluster of grapes. And in Gen 11:6 those who built the tower of Babel are referred to as &quot;one people.&quot; When we refer to a person we know that the &quot;one&quot; person consists of several distinct components (emotions, thoughts, hands, heart, liver, etc.). Yet we all understand all of these parts constitute &quot;one person.&quot; Echad was the word to describe the &quot;one flesh&quot; of marriage (Gen 2:24). 
<br />Rev. Theresa Bloodgood: Since God is referred to as &quot;echad&quot; in the same way as man and woman are referred to as &quot;echad&quot; this heavily implies that the oneness of marriage reflects the oneness of God. We also see echad used very intensely in Ezekiel 37:15-28 in the prophecy of the &quot;two sticks&quot; of Israel and Judah becoming one. In that prophecy we have a representative picture and the actuality. Examine the passage carefully and you will see that the intent of the two sticks is to be a picture that Ezekiel first shows to the captive Jews in Babylon. The idea is that they would remember this message as they go about their daily activities and would pick up sticks (for building cooking fires, for example) and be reminded of this promise of God and have hope. In Ezek 37:17 
<br />Rev. Theresa Bloodgood: 17 the sticks don't fuse together into a single stick. It appears that this was representative of the reality of what happens in God's hand in Ezek 37:19. Even then, Judah and Israel contain distinct tribes (after all, one must know who the Levites are for priests and who the tribe of Judah is from which the Messiah will come). So the oneness of the two sticks in Ezekiel's hand obviously is a representative oneness and echad in Ezek 37:17 could be easily translated as &quot;united.&quot; But, nevertheless, the oneness of Israel and Judah still consists of many individuals from twelve distinct tribes. The individuals do not become a homogeneous consciousness or a physical singularity of any sort. We are dealing on a spiritual level of oneness, which is reflective of God's nature. 
<br />Rev. Theresa Bloodgood: The &quot;oneness: we observe in marriage and the other examples are shadows of the reality of the oneness within God.
<br />Now the true nature of God's oneness we can only describe by how it appears to us from what Jesus said and did. The best words we have to describe the members of the trinity seem to be as &quot;persons.&quot;
<br /><br />Rev. Theresa Bloodgood: What doth it profit thee to enter into deep discussions concerning the Holy Trinity, if thou lack humility, and be thus displeasing to the Trinity? For verily it is not deep words that make a man holy and upright; it is a good life which maketh a man dear to God. I had rather feel contrition than be skillful in the definition thereof. If thou knewest the whole Bible, and the sayings of all the philosophers, what should this profit thee without the love and grace of God? --Thomas a Kempis (1380-1471), Of the Imitation of Christ

<br /><br />CR Staff/AH (June 13th, 2007)
<br /><br />(RALEIGH, N.C.)â€”Larry Ross, personal spokesman for the Graham family said today that Ruth Graham, Billy's wife, has fallen into a coma and is &quot;entering the final stages of life.&quot; (Photo courtesy of Billy Graham Evangelistic Assoc.)
<br /><br />Mrs. Graham had been treated for pneumonia two weeks ago, and had improved temporarily, but Wednesday morning entered a coma. According to the Church Report, she celebrated her birthday this past weekend. Four of the Graham's children are by their mother's side, the other on his way in.
<br /><br />Billy Graham said of his long-time companion, &quot;Ruth is my soul mate and best friend, and I cannot imagine living a single day without her by my side.&quot; 
<br /><br />&quot;I am more in love with her today than when we first met over 65 years ago as students at Wheaton College,&quot; he added.

<br />Mark 16: 15-16
<br /><br />Verses 15-16
<br />“Go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature. He who believes shall be saved, but he who does not believe will be condemned”.
<br /><br />Insight
<br />Jesus had commissioned his disciples to preach the Good News to everyone, going into all the world. That was He last commandment before He ascended into heaven. The disciples had their work cut out for them in sharing the Good News and it started with them. They would go into the lands and share the Gospel of Christ Jesus with others.
<br /><br />Have you share your faith with others? When was the last time you told your testimony?

<br /><br />Exodus 20
<br />The Ten Commandments 
<br />    1 And God spoke all these words: 
<br /><br />2 &quot;I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery. 
<br /><br />3 &quot;You shall have no other gods before [a] me. 
<br /><br />4 &quot;You shall not make for yourself an idol in the form of anything in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the waters below. 5 You shall not bow down to them or worship them; for I, the LORD your God, am a jealous God, punishing the children for the sin of the fathers to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me, 6 but showing love to a thousand {generations} of those who love me and keep my commandments. 
<br /><br />7 &quot;You shall not misuse the name of the LORD your God, for the LORD will not hold anyone guiltless who misuses his name. 
<br /><br />8 &quot;Remember the Sabbath day by keeping it holy. 9 Six days you shall labor and do all your work, 10 but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the LORD your God. On it you shall not do any work, neither you, nor your son or daughter, nor your manservant or maidservant, nor your animals, nor the alien within your gates. 11 For in six days the LORD made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them, but he rested on the seventh day. Therefore the LORD blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy. 
<br /><br />12 &quot;Honor your father and your mother, so that you may live long in the land the LORD your God is giving you. 
<br /><br />13 &quot;You shall not murder. 
<br /><br />14 &quot;You shall not commit adultery. 
<br /><br />15 &quot;You shall not steal. 
<br /><br />16 &quot;You shall not give false testimony against your neighbor. 
<br /><br />17 &quot;You shall not covet your neighbor's house. You shall not covet your neighbor's wife, or his manservant or maidservant, his ox or donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbor.&quot; 
<br /><br />18 When the people saw the thunder and lightning and heard the trumpet and saw the mountain in smoke, they trembled with fear. They stayed at a distance 19 and said to Moses, &quot;Speak to us yourself and we will listen. But do not have God speak to us or we will die.&quot; 
<br /><br />20 Moses said to the people, &quot;Do not be afraid. God has come to test you, so that the fear of God will be with you to keep you from sinning.&quot; 
<br /><br />21 The people remained at a distance, while Moses approached the thick darkness where God was. 
<br /><br />Idols and Altars 
<br />    22 Then the LORD said to Moses, &quot;Tell the Israelites this: 'You have seen for yourselves that I have spoken to you from heaven: 23 Do not make any gods to be alongside me; do not make for yourselves gods of silver or gods of gold. 
<br /><br />24 &quot; 'Make an altar of earth for me and sacrifice on it your burnt offerings and fellowship offerings, [b] your sheep and goats and your cattle. Wherever I cause my name to be honored, I will come to you and bless you. 25 If you make an altar of stones for me, do not build it with dressed stones, for you will defile it if you use a tool on it. 26 And do not go up to my altar on steps, lest your nakedness be exposed on it.'
