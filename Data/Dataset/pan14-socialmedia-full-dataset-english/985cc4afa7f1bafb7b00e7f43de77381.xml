<br />The Capital One Venture Card and the Capital One VentureOne Rewards Card are both popular credit cards for Americans who travel frequently as they have many excellent benefits for frequent travelers. You may be wondering which card is better for you, so here I’ll try to help you by comparing these 2 cards together.
<br /><br />The main difference between the two cards is that the Capital One Venture gives you 2 miles for every dollar spent and has a $59 annual fee, while the Capital One VentureOne Rewards Card gives you 1.25 miles for every dollar spent but has no annual fee.
<br /><br />Capital One Venture	VS	
<br />Capital One VentureOne Rewards
<br />First, a look at what both cards have in common:
<br /><br />Earn unlimited miles and miles never expire. The more you spend on your card, the more miles you will earn, without any maximum limit. Since your miles don’t expire, there’s no urgency for you to redeem your miles before any expiration date.
<br /><br />Redeem your miles for any travel expenses, such as air tickets, hotel accommodation, vacation packages, cruise line and auto rentals. You can book any airline at any time, with no blackout dates and no advance booking is required.  Simply pay for your travel booking with the card, and then redeem your miles online or by phone to be reimbursed for your purchase. To calculate how much your miles are worth, simply cut off the last two zeros. For example, if you have earned 22,300 miles, you’ve earned a $223 flight, or a $223 hotel room, or a $223 car rental. Your account will be credited for the travel purchase, and you will see that credit on your statement.
<br /><br />You can also redeem your miles for cash, gift cards or merchandise. If you don’t intend to travel, you also have the choice to redeem your miles for gift cards, cash back, merchandise, etc. This redemption flexibility stands out as one of the top benefits of this card.
<br /><br />0% foreign transaction fee. This is a great benefit especially for those who travel abroad frequently or make purchases over the internet as you won’t have to pay any foreign transaction fees when you pay in another currency using your card. Most card issuers charge around 3-5% as a foreign transaction fee, so this will result in additional savings for you!
<br /><br />No introductory 0% APR on balance transfers. You’ll start off with a variable APR of either 11.9%, 15.9% or 19.9% depending on your credit score, on balance transfers. Since there’s no 0% intro APR on balance transfers, you should only shift your existing card debts to either card if you are paying a higher interest rate than the one charged on this Capital One card. If you wish to transfer a balance, check out our 0% balance transfer cards.
<br /><br />No balance transfer fee. Unlike most other banks in the U.S. that charge a balance transfer fee when you transfer an existing card debt to another card, both cards do not charge any balance transfer fee. However, you should only do a balance transfer if you are currently paying a higher interest rate than the interest charged on this Capital One card (which is either 11.9%, 15.9% or 19.9%, depending on your credit score) since both cards don’t offer any 0% introductory APR on balance transfers.
<br /><br />Free Extended Warranty. If you purchase a new item with this card and it comes with an original manufacturer’s warranty of 3 years or less, Extended Warranty will double the original warranty time period to up to 12 months on most items that you purchase. This is a great benefit to have as it saves you from having to purchase additional warranty from stores especially when you buy electronic goods.
<br /><br />Free Purchase Security. Within the first 90 days from the date of purchase, Purchase Security will replace, repair, or reimburse you for eligible items paid fully with your Visa Signature card, up to a maximum of $500 per claim and $50,000 per cardholder, should your items get stolen or accidentally damaged.
<br /><br />$250,000 travel accident insurance. If you pay for your or your family’s travel tickets with this card, you will automatically be covered under this travel accidence insurance plan in the event of death or dismemberment.
<br /><br />Other travel-related benefits. You get 24-hour travel assistance services which will be helpful if you require any information relating to your travel such as passports, visas, immunizations etc. If your credit card is lost or stolen, you can get an emergency card replacement. You’ll also get medical assistance, legal referrals when you are away from your home.
<br /><br />Travel savings and upgrades. You can get complimentary room upgrades and special discounts at certain hotels, resorts and spas with this Visa Signature card.
<br /><br />Get access to advance ticket sales to popular sports, film, music, and theater events with the Visa Signature card. This will be a huge advantage to those who like entertainment as you get to enjoy access to advance ticket sales and preferred seating at concerts, sporting events like SuperBowl and hit Broadway shows, as well as movie ticket offers.
<br /><br />Auto rental insurance. When you rent a vehicle for less than 15 consecutive days in the US, or for less than 31 days outside the US with this card, you will be covered against accidental damage or theft of your rented vehicle. To be covered, you must decline the rental company’s collision/damage waiver. This insurance doesn’t apply to vehicles rented in Israel, Jamaica, the Republic of Ireland, or Northern Ireland.
<br /><br />Lost luggage reimbursement. If you pay for the full costs of your travel for yourself and your immediate family members with the Visa Signature card, you will be covered automatically for lost luggage due to theft or misdirection by the common carrier. You will be reimbursed up to $3,000 per trip.
<br /><br />Round-the-clock concierge service. This is a complimentary service to Visa Signature cardholders which you can use if you need assistance in booking any events, buying someone a gift or making restaurant reservations.
<br /><br />$0 Fraud Liability. This ensures that you won’t be obligated to pay for any unauthorized transactions on your card.
<br /><br />Capital One Venture Rewards	VS	
<br />Capital One VentureOne Rewards
<br />Now let’s have a look at the differences between these two cards:
<br /><br />Capital One Venture Card:
<br /><br />Get 10,000 bonus miles in your first 3 months. During the first 3 months of having this card, by spending at least $1,000, you will receive 10,000 miles. This is a very attractive offer since you will be getting these miles for free after spending a little more than $330 a month for the first 3 months. These 10,000 bonus miles equal $100 in travel.
<br /><br />Receive 2 miles for every $1 spent on any purchase. For any purchases you make with this Capital One Venture Card, you will always receive 2 miles per every $1 you spend. Earning double miles on everything ensures an ultra fast accumulation of miles which you can later redeem for a variety of rewards!
<br /><br />After the first year, you will have to pay an annual fee. After the first year of having this card, you’ll have to pay an annual fee of $59. You will have to spend at least $3,000 a year on your card just to cancel out this annual fee, which means that any amount in excess of $3,000 will be your upside. If you are going to spend more than $3,000 on your card in a year, the annual fee will be very worth it since you will earn double miles on everything you spend on. For example, if you spend $12,000 in a year on your card, your upside will be $9,000 x 2 miles = 18,000 miles (after factoring in the 6,000 miles to cancel out the annual fee), which can be redeemed for a $180 travel credit.

<br /><br />Capital One VentureOne Rewards Card:
<br /><br />No annual fee. You will be able to enjoy all the attractive benefits of this card for free without having to pay an annual fee.
<br /><br />Earn 10,000 bonus miles after spending $1,000 in the first 3 months. These 10,000 miles can be redeemed for $100 worth of gift vouchers, travel expenses and more.
<br /><br />Receive 1.25 miles per every $1 spent on any purchase. For any purchases you make with this card, you will receive 1.25 miles per every $1 you spend. This is a good offer as some other rewards credit cards only give you 1 mile for every $1 spent, and in this case, you get 25% more miles per dollar.
<br /><br />0% introductory APR on all your purchases till November 2012. You will enjoy the benefits of having a 0% introductory APR on all your purchases until November 2012, after that you will have to pay a variable APR of either 11.9%, 15.9% or 19.9% depending on your credit score. This is a great promotion for new sign-ups as it means that you will be able to make a big purchase and have the option to repay it interest-free over several months before November 2012. The sooner you sign up, the more you’ll get of the 0% intro period.
<br /><br />Low ongoing interest rates. The variable APR on purchases and balance transfers is either 11.9%, 15.9% or 19.9%, depending on your credit score. So if you have excellent credit score, you may qualify for the lowest rate of 11.9%. You only incur interest charges if you don’t pay your bills in full by the due date every month, otherwise, you don’t pay any interest at all.
<br /><br />Click here to go to Capital One’s official application, terms, and details
<br /><br />Our Verdict:  4.78/5 Stars
<br /><br />The Capital One Venture Rewards is a great rewards credit card since it gives you 2 miles per $1 spent on any purchases, which is more miles per dollar than what many other travel rewards cards offer.  Plus, you get 10,000 miles after you spend $1,000 during your first 3 months as a cardmember, which is redeemable for a $100 travel credit. This card was named the most rewarding card for airline flights in the Money Magazine. It does have an annual fee though, so if you are planning to spend less than $3000 a year on the card, you should probably opt for the Capital One VentureOne Rewards Credit Card which gives you 1.25 miles per $1 spent on any purchases, which is 25% more miles per dollar compared to that offered by some other rewards cards and has no annual fee.
<br /><br />Note that only the Capital One VentureOne Rewards Credit Card has a 0% intro APR on purchases till November 2012, which is a good offer for those who plan to take advantage of the interest-free period to make a big-ticket item purchase. The sooner you sign up for this card, the longer your 0% intro APR duration will be! Plus, you will receive 10,000 bonus miles after spending $1,000 in the first 3 months.

<br /><br />A recent fraud involving Amazon notification emails has been making the rounds online with the following on the subject line:
<br /><br />Subject:     Your order has been successfully cancelled.
<br /><br />But instead of being sent by Amazon.com, this message actually comes from spoofed emails (in this case, from <a href="/go/messages/send/receiver=orders@amazon.com">orders@amazon.com</a>). The link embedded in the email will usually take you to a login page designed to look like it’s really Amazon.com so as to collect your login details.
<br /><br />Because of the subject, Amazon users who are actually waiting for some pending orders will feel compelled to contact Amazon.com about the cancellation.
<br /><br />Not only that, there are also tons of other fraudulent transactions being done through Amazon.
<br /><br />- A man pleaded guilty in a fraud accusation that involves £500,000. He and a bunch of other people teamed up and allegedly used stolen credit card information to buy his own songs on Amazon and iTunes.
<br /><br />Lamar Johnson, a 19-year old from Wolverhampton, was charged one count of conspiracy to defraud along with 11 others.
<br /><br />They reportedly downloaded the songs more than 6,000 times between January 2008 and June 2009 in order to get royalties from the sales.
<br /><br />According to Johnson, he was responsible for around 2,000 of the downloads.
<br /><br />- Another incident involved someone who paid $400 for gold items he bought but since the seller was out of stock already, the order was cancelled. However, according to the poster, Amazon put a hold on his credit card and would not release any funds.
<br /><br />- Someone purchased a Sony digital camera with a bunch of accessories on Amazon and was delighted that he was given a free delivery. However, when the package arrived at their address, it turned out to be a randomly inappropriate book. He suspects that it might be because of some mistake on Amazon’s part or a horrible mix up in the delivery contractor. But noticing that the package has his name and address on it just right and that it appears to have been tampered with, he feared that there was some sort of theft or fraud involved.
<br /><br />- A customer bought a laptop through Amazon and was, strangely enough, sent a used laptop. But since the card used in the transaction was closed by the customer already, a USD 40 check was issued as refund instead. However, when it was deposited on the bank, it was discovered that the check is a fraud.
<br />While it is certainly understandable for fraud victims to blame Amazon and wish them all the bad luck, let’s also keep in mind that customers also have their responsibilities. Note to self: If you don’t want to suffer from horrible customer service and if a transaction looks shady early on, then just buy in a physical store.

<br /><br />Gold traders in Jeddah and Makkah, Saudi Arabia are lamenting about the low demand for gold along with difficulties they are faced with to boost the market. They are also opposing the blatant inequality between foreign and local traders.
<br /><br />Saudi’s gold industry is still suffering from high prices that lead to a large number of layoffs and closing down of shops.
<br /><br />Employees and investors in the gold market are among the worst hit after the slump in the gold sale brought about by high prices.
<br /><br />Local traders are barely surviving in the gold market because of many obstacles and remarkably low sales.
<br /><br />The pressure being placed on Saudi gold participants is way higher when compared to what foreigners are getting. Local gold traders are calling for equality between Saudi and foreign investors in terms of rights, duties and benefits. They reportedly face some problems dealing with government policies. Legally speaking, foreign investors get advantages of smoother processing and better services.

<br />Gold traders in Jeddah and Makkah, Saudi Arabia are lamenting about the low demand for gold along with difficulties they are faced with to boost the market. They are also opposing the blatant inequality between foreign and local traders.
<br /><br />Saudi’s gold industry is still suffering from high prices that lead to a large number of layoffs and closing down of shops.
<br /><br />Employees and investors in the gold market are among the worst hit after the slump in the gold sale brought about by high prices.
<br /><br />Local traders are barely surviving in the gold market because of many obstacles and remarkably low sales.
<br /><br />The pressure being placed on Saudi gold participants is way higher when compared to what foreigners are getting. Local gold traders are calling for equality between Saudi and foreign investors in terms of rights, duties and benefits. They reportedly face some problems dealing with government policies. Legally speaking, foreign investors get advantages of smoother processing and better services.
<br /><br />Gold sales in the Makkah area are really weak inspite of the increase in gold demand during the Haj and Umrah seasons.

<br /><br />Jewelers from Amazon to China create customized items made of precious metals for clients — from simple bracelets to sophisticated rings that alert one of the wearer’s status.
<br /><br />A jewel designer usually starts by discussing with clients what design concepts they have in mind. From that sketch, a technical drawing is then created to a scale. And since the popularization of computer aided designs, the technical model is rendered digitally in a 3D form to serve as basis for the casting and setting.
<br /><br />And it’s not just all about art skills. There are also technical aspects of the job, the same way that an architect needs expertise to start a project. The jeweler must have a good understanding of jewelry creation, what would look good on a specific client, etc.
<br /><br />Every client consultation is expectedly unique, for people sometimes want to have a more antique look on the jewelry they are requesting, or already have an accurate picture of what they like and would just like to tweak it a bit.
<br /><br />Some designs are more vintage, coming from inspirations from Amazon landscapes. On the other hand, there were also more trendy designs and colors that alert onlookers, derived from the more expressive trends at present.
<br /><br />The thing is, the variety in clients’ inclinations help a lot. When something is customized for a very specific purpose, it tends to become more meaningful for the clients.
<br /><br />The most challenging part of the work will be the part where the clients are not sure what they want to have. Having a creative mindset is an asset, especially in drawing out what the clients are actually looking for.
<br /><br />Either clients would have no idea what they like or they would have a variety of things they want to experiment on. As a result, jewel designers have to spend much time with the clients in order for them to figure out the best option. You have to be able to communicate effectively and have patience in every transaction.
<br /><br />To give you an idea how much a jeweler earns in a year, entry-level salaries amount to USD 23,050 while those with significant experience can have up to USD 50,000.
<br /><br />Aspiring jewelers can learn of the trade from vocational schools offering such courses or even on by distance-learning centers. Still, there are those who hone their skill in making or designing jewelry through on-the-job training.

<br /><br />Knowing what is coming up in jewelry developments is vital and then getting able to duplicate the pattern at a fraction of the designer or retail pieces is important. I have visited a number of factories recently and noted some strong trends coming through. Here they are:
<br /><br />Chunky, Remarkable and Large Metals
<br /><br />Huge and bold ornaments are in this time. There is no these issue as “not enough” and “much more a lot more-ness” is definitely desirable. Decadently embellished items having drama and generating a main statement will be the showstoppers everyone is hunting to individual. Also enormous metal pieces these as the giant curb link necklace pieces created by Kenneth J. Lane and other individuals and which are really expensive.
<br /><br />Antique, Vintage, Retro &amp; New Combinations
<br /><br />Absolutely everyone loves the look of antique, vintage and retro jewelry and now the most recent trend is to thoughtfully mix these with new and imaginative items for a special one particular of a variety glimpse. Jewelry designers these kinds of as Elizabeth Locke and Roberto Coin are beautifully infusing their new concepts and marrying them to antique and vintage seems to be and the resulting styles are perfection.
<br /><br />Dramatic, Special and Abnormal Necklaces
<br /><br />As opposed to in the previous when the huge brooches and pins have been the key component in one’s individual adornment… it is now the necklace. Necklaces that fill a neckline these as the well-known bib design, or the lengthy multi-chain with or without a pendant these as some of the styles by Chopard can include rhinestone crosses, circles, skulls and skeleton keys. Also multi material pieces that appear to be a single-of-a type produce that ever before common “artist -bohemian” search and every single having matching earrings to total the statement is what drama and unique is all about.
<br /><br />Ornamented &amp; Bold Bracelets
<br /><br />This pattern has been scorching for a while considering that Louis Vuitton produced a significant statement with his embellished cuff designs. Also wonderful dyed leather cuffs reminiscent of “surfer chic” with ornamentation are generating their appearance. Substantial Lucite confetti bangles like the old 50?s – 60?s versions, and metal cuffs with charms, studs and crystals are all bigger than actually.
<br /><br />Eclectic All-natural Ethnic and Tribal Seems
<br /><br />Ethnic and regional styles are often very hot and this year is no exception. Taking from the Native American or African use of normal stones like turquoise, agates, onyx, opaque and semi valuable stones in rock candy colors and like the high stop styles of Oscar Heyman and Katy Briscoe. Beautiful pale angelskin coral and the most critical a single but is valuable and uncommon red coral no matter whether utilized in their raw type or carved are not to be missed. All of this incorporated into authentic nature inspired designs produce an “earth mother” appeal.
<br /><br />Fake &amp; Genuine Pearls
<br /><br />Pearls are pure classicism. For centuries they have been hugely desired for their exclusive one particular of a sort nature. Even so in 2010-2011, pearls are not your mom’s string of 8mm pearls any longer. Pearls no matters whether actual or fake are coming in huge rounds, teardrops or Biwa shapes and are exhibiting up all over the place. Even Cartier has revived their classic styling in a lot more eye catching pearl in mixture with diamonds designs. Pearls can be at the finish of an extended neck chain, integrated into a massive hefty metal multi chain bib necklace, on top of a ring, dangling from ears or clustered as charms close to the wrist. They are still feminine but with a “warrior princess” edge.
<br /><br />More than The Best Rings
<br /><br />No matter whether fake or genuine the more one can place on a finger the greater and the notion is to “catch the eye”. Clusters of crystals, pearls, charms, Lucite beads, reflecting a fashion referred to as “French Salon Chic”. Flashing an unbelievable ring while getting cocktails and conversation is the ultimate “tease” and every person will be envious.
<br /><br />Huge Hoops and Chandelier Earrings
<br /><br />The hoop earrings is very flexible and this trend is nonetheless quite robust. The bigger… longer… and glitzier the far better. Earring Hoops that are 2? – 4? lengthy and have rhinestones or diamonds on the outside and inside of are correct on pattern. Jewelry designers Patricia Locke and Ramona Singer are creating new and fascinating hoop earring designs. Now for a far more elegant appear, chandelier earrings are ideal. Bulgari, and other people are providing their spin on this traditional earring design and style. In 2010, earrings with extreme coloration palettes these as scorching pinks, reds, greens and yellows produce a striking contrast that will give any vogue search a touch of glamour.
<br /><br />Green Eco Conscious Movement
<br /><br />Thank God this movement finally built it to the more than-indulgent earth of jewelry. A lot more and much more designers these kinds of as Mari &amp; Lani Davis, Alex and Ani, and Tamra Gentry just to name a few are concerned with” recycle and reuse” philosophies in their styles. No matter whether it is recycling vehicle paint, plastic milk cartons, utilized newspapers, or just plain trash… fascinating and thrilling jewelry is literally popping up just about everywhere!!
