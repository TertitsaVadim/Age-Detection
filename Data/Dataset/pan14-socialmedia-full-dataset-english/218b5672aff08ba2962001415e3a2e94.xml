<br />I didn’t thought it will make that much of pain
<br />And regret
<br />I was foolish , selfish and blind , didn’t c that ppl can be easily hurt ,coz I was not 1 of them ,

<br />Coz I made u love me , 
<br />Said I love but I lied  
<br />But it’s the time to say am sorry , wish it will come the day I understand the meaning of feeling sorry , wish  that day come soon before I hurt some1 again 
<br />Am not sorry for the pain and full nights of tears 
<br />But am sorry for being an idiot to lose the most beautiful nights  
<br />To lose the smile on ur lips
<br />To lose the faith in ur eyes 
<br />But everyday I wish I can tell u the truth , coz I know it will become harder and harder each day 
<br /><br />I have a serious matter with commitment, loyalty ,honesty and many thing could make me a better person if I tried to understand it before I knew u 
<br /><br />But it’s a must to meet some 1 like me 
<br />Coz evils r the darkness which gives the light its meaning

<br />listen to the sermon of sparrows

<br />there amongst the dandelion and thorn.
<br />Now I frequent hotel lobbies,
<br />like a chain smoker having a bad day.
<br />A nasty habit that breathes itself.
<br />Delivering each day to the needy next.
<br />Each with the promise of glitter and glory.
<br />But how my tiny heart aches to return.
<br />Like a daisy rooted in rot and rubbish
<br />asked to grow in strange rooms.
<br />Fed neon and cold pizza.
<br />I fear I may wither with forgetfulness.
<br />So I pull these pages close about my ears
<br />Tiny, leafy limbs pale with impression.
<br />My pen a single flame to keep me warm
<br />like a beacon holding memory.
<br />Until I am able to go back to my lovely mountains,
<br />or until I am strong enough to bring their essence
<br />to the rest of these hungry people
<br />who long to remember the simplicity
<br />which lies beyond the cities inbred streets
<br />and the godliness which resides in us all.
