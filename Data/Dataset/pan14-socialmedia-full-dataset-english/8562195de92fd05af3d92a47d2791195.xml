He also carried the Democratic Party to virtually unassailable power in both the House and Senate.
<br /><br />Obama sought after and received the strong endorsement of the Humane Society of the United States (HSUS), and this animal rights organization most certainly will try to cash in its political chips in ways that are likely to threaten dog owners, owners of other kinds of animals, hunters, gun owners and farmers.
<br /><br />That is not mere speculation. It is the way American politics works. To the victor go the spoils.
<br /><br />For dog owners, the next four years likely will decide our future. If we fail to act cohesively and effectively, our ownership of the dogs we love is doomed.
<br /><br />We will not be polite and we will not sugarcoat reality.
<br /><br />This is the political reality we must face in order to preserve dog ownership rights:

<br /><br />They carried their fight to the county auditor, the county commissioners and the local newspaper, and they won.
<br /><br />We urge all Ohioans to read this report, as we have some evidence that the Ohio Dog Warden’s Association is encouraging other counties to break the law. We also have received an unconfirmed report that at least one other county is breaking the state kennel licensing law, and there may be more.

<br /><br />On June 22, 2008 , my 10-year old lab mix, Chai, sustained a severe injury from a product that the company Four Paws, Inc., produces. The toy I’m referencing is the pimple ball with bell (Item #20227-001, UPC Code #0 4566320227 9).

If you can’t do without a four legged “friend,” choosing a hypoallergenic dog is the best alternative. For those who are scratching their heads, a hypoallergenic dog is not a special breed of dogs. They are dogs that generate less (hypo) allergens (allergenic) in the air, which has a lot to do with the dog’s physical size and length of its fur. For allergy sufferers, finding an allergy-friendly dog is the most reasonable choice. This doesn’t mean that the dog will be completely allergy proof, but it does mean that this type of dog tends to generate less amounts of allergy causing elements. It is impossible to find a dog that causes no degree of allergens.

Now I know it mentions insects and they are not animals but still there is some truth to it. Read w/an open mind and just get the message that is being sent.
<br /><br />Animals As Teachers
<br />Since prehistoric times, animals have acted as companions to humans on
<br />their journey toward enlightenment. Animals as disparate in character as
<br />house pets, birds, sea creatures, and insects have been our mentors,
<br />teachers, and guides. There is much we can learn from animals, as they
<br />offer us the unique opportunity to transcend the human perspective.

Take it slow and steady, pet parents. According to our experts, the danger of stray voltage on city streets can turn a simple stroll into a devastating event for our furry friends.
<br />Most common in northern climes and urban areas, stray voltage occurs when dormant utilities leak excess electricity. Combined with wet streets and salt-based ice melts, this current can shock, injure or even prove fatal for those in its path. “Since salt used to treat icy streets is a great conductor of electricity,” says Dr. Louise Murray, ASPCA Director of Medicine and author of Vet Confidential, “the risk of shock from stray voltage is that much higher during the winter months.”

An incurable, paralyzing disease in humans is now genetically linked to a similar disease in dogs. Researchers from the University of Missouri and the Broad Institute have found that the genetic mutation responsible for degenerative myelopathy (DM) in dogs is the same mutation that causes amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), the human disease also known as Lou Gehrig’s Disease. As a result of the discovery, which will be published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences this week, researchers can now use dogs with DM as animal models to help identify therapeutic interventions for curing the human disease, ALS.

Eddie went through some serious stressful situations as he learned how to care for a bunch of youngsters. With several kids of my own, I know how stressful kids can be to us, but have you ever thought about the stresses that kids go through? Thinking about this, it reminded me of what puppies experience during the process of getting a new home. If you have children, you probably remember when they first started daycare or school. Mom’s cry, dad’s worry and everyone is stressed out including the child who is learning what to do without mom and dad around. It doesn’t take long until the child ends up with a cold or other kind of illness and has to miss a day or so of school/daycare. When a puppy goes to its new home, it too suffers from very similar stresses. It was recently weaned from its mother, typically has to take a trip to its new home, either by vehicle or airplane, and then typically gets greeted with a house full of anxious new pet owners and often children who want to stay up late and play with the new puppy. Can you see how this is STRESSFUL!
