		<document id="63caa36d92c5e0b29c1bf5ca70b4eb38" url=""><![CDATA[Dungeon Dressing: Stairs<br/><br/>By Thilo Graf
<br /><br />This pdf is 13 pages long, 1 page front cover, 1 page advertisement, 2 pages editorial, 1 page ToC/foreword, 1 page SRD and 1 page back cover, leaving a total of 6 pages of content for the second “Dungeon Dressing”-pdf, so let’s check it out!
<br /><br />The Dungeon Dressing-series of pdfs seeks to add details, details, details to your game and provides tables of enticing, unique and evocative pieces to your creations, enabling you to make your locations feel more distinct – at least that’s the idea. Does it succeed?
<br /><br />Quite original, Creighton Broadhurst kicks off this discussion of stairs by classifying multiple kinds of stairs, from gradual to spiral staircases as well as stair made from e.g. magically hardened glass. We also get information on how different kinds of stairs impede movement, acrobatics-DCs etc., all contained in a concise page.
<br /><br />After having these basics covered, we get the tables and we’re in for a table I absolutely adore: Random characteristics provide a page of features that range from low ceilings, to masoner’s marks and niches and even steps with different heights – sometimes these features provide for added complications that influence e.g. DCs and options available to the PCs.
<br /><br />A total of 2 pages containing 100 dressings and features, from graffiti to dust and tracks, broken spear shafts, chipped steps and blood trails and slippery water are contained herein, once again providing different angles, hooks and, again, often modifications of crunchy circumstances the PCs may encounter.
<br /><br />My biggest gripe with the predecessor detailing statues was that the traps were not on par with the tables. This installment also features traps, 3 to be precise: Cr 3m 4 and 7 and boy, they are better: From the classic sliding staircase (with effects depending on the round) to a barrage of shadow-magic style boulders, the three different traps all can be considered winners – while not particular in their fluff, the traps are iconic enough to make not only for cool challenges, but also remain easy to integrate in the sample staircase of your choosing.
<br /><br />Conclusion:
<br /><br />Editing and formatting are top-notch, I didn’t notice any glitches. Layout adheres to RSp’S elegant 2-column b/w-standard and the pdf comes in two versions – one optimized for screen use on tablets and one to be printed out. The pdf is fully bookmarked. I’m a big fan of details – they make for the spice of adventuring and the difference between a cool world and one that can be considered truly immersive. The stairs contained herein are not simple fluff, though, instead adding a nice variety of modifications that can not only make the player’ experience better, but also provide for neat environmental challenges that influence your combat tactics. In the end, all of the content herein should be considered top-notch and taking the low price into account, I am more or less forced to grant this pdf the best possible rating 5 stars + endzeitgeist seal of approval for an exciting, cool supplement that is guaranteed to enrich your GM-arsenal.
<br /><br />Endzeitgeist out.

<br /><br />Born in Cali, Columbia, Caffé designer, Paula Saavedra, brought the flare and flavor of her South American roots to life through her astounding collection. Caffé Swimwear first burst onto the scene in 2004 and has been turning heads ever since. Its popularity has spread like wildfire; and is offered for sale internationally, in 38 countries. After earning her degree in Marketing and Advertising from Emerson College in Boston, Paula joined the creative team of McCann Erickson, a leading global marketing communications company in Miami. She worked in advertising for a few years and ultimately identified the need for a high-end, yet wearable swimwear line. Having always had a love for fashion and drawing, she and a friend channeled their creative energy into realizing the feat of launching a luxury swimwear line. Two years later, in 2006, Paula bought her partner’s participation and is now the sole owner of Caffé Swimwear. Her quality designs are influenced by current fashion trends and the rich culture and beauty of her beloved country, Colombia. She designs with the belief that women strive to look and feel confident and sexy , and can do so in her comfortable, hand-crafted, yet glamorous swimwear.
<br /><br />The Caffé, 2013 collection featured a stunning presentation of vivid, tropical shades and unique, lively patterns. Each look was figure flattering and styled to perfection – the essence of sexy chic. The vibe was breezy and refreshing and never compromised style and comfort. Beachy-glam ensembles all paired with classic gold accessories, and models donning gorgeous sun-kissed makeup, sleek ponytails, and toting straw and crocheted beach bags highlighted this striking presentation.
<br /><br /> Fun, embellished, silk kaftans sporting delicate beaded accents and coverups, topped flower printed bandeaus combined with classic black bikini bottoms, two and one-piece numbers with alluring cutouts in a plethora of brilliant shades of coral, aqueous blues, yellows and hints of animal print. Dazzling, flowing summer dresses in fluid fabrics were refreshingly effortless and transported  the audience to a far off tropical destination. Looks also included various resortwear suited for the poolside, beach or a summer stroll in the city. My personal favorite look, which Paula Saavedra wore, was a lovely printed, chiffon dress splashed in countless hues of blue and sprinklings of black and white, complete with tassel tie – GORGEOUS! The superior craftsmanship and precise fit also did not go unnoticed. Hand-crafted in Colombia, these pieces are made in a mix of Brazilian and American cuts, with flawless seamless stitching, and made to withstand extensive sun exposure and repeated wear, without fading or losing its original, immaculate fit. An added bonus for  Caffé’s fashion-forward customers, is that it offers edgy, reversible numbers which add support and provide maximum comfort.
<br /><br /> The Caffé 2013 collection was impressive, beautiful, and exuded radiance. Every creation showcased will surely add just the right touch of opulence to every woman’s summer wardrobe and epitomizes the brand’s trademark style – “Laid Back Luxury”; in short, mesmerizing.

With a headquarters in Malibu, California, which appropriately looks out at the Pacific Ocean, it is a top tier swimwear company.  Already popular among surf shops and sports enthusiasts, Maui and Sons is now expanding the horizon to include the fashion world with designer Lacey Corkery leading the way.  A designer of many talents, Lacey is currently focusing her attention on Maui and Sons’ 2012 Summer collection which was featured at the Fashion Splash runway show in West Hollywood last month.
<br /><br />    At Fashion Splash,  Models walked the catwalk in Lacey’s latest designs featuring neon colors and animal prints. They carried surf and body boards to stay true to the surf culture that the brand was built upon. Maui and Sons sunglasses and T-shirts were thrown out to the excited crowd.  Models wore board shorts, bikini tops, and colorful one-pieces while the male model showed off the retro neon board shorts to whistles and hollers. Obviously the shorts were a popular hit among the ladies in the crowd. The Maui and Sons 2012 collection is definitely bright, fun, and fresh! With a young designer like Lacey, Maui and Sons is taking a fresh new approach to their swimwear line and not missing a beat when it comes to incorporating the hottest trends of the season including: stripes, bright colors, geometric patterns and animal prints.
<br /><br />     The neon trend is nothing new to this seasoned swimwear company, which includes this color palette in its logo that has been with the company since it began some thirty years ago.  The logo also features figures to represent and celebrate elements of mother nature: earth, sea, sky and fire.  Because Maui and Sons embodies fun in the sun, it is not a surprise that this brand is particularly appealing to people who live active and adventurous lifestyles. Another unique part of this company is that they have their own mascot: Sharkman. which is one of the most widely recognizable branded images in the active sports apparel and equipment category worldwide.
<br /><br />          Maui and Sons first got its start in the 1980?s when three young southern California surfers decided to start their own apparel company. Years later, Maui and Sons has grown from being a small clothing manufacturer to a full-scale, international clothing and equipment company.  Their merchandise is sold in over 100 countries and the product range includes everything from both men’s and women’s apparel, footwear, and accessories to sports equipment and even household items.

<br /><br />FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS
<br />The Company's second quarter Operating Funds From Operations applicable to common shareholders (&quot;Operating FFO&quot<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/wink.gif" alt=":)" /> increased to $71.6 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, before $6.5 million of net adjustments, which compares to $64.4 million, or $0.23 per diluted share, before $11.9 million of net adjustments for the prior-year comparable period.  The increase in Operating FFO for the three-month period ended June 30, 2012, as compared to the same period in 2011, is primarily due to organic growth and the acquisition of nine shopping center assets in 2011 and 2012 partially offset by asset dispositions.
<br /><br />Funds From Operations applicable to common shareholders (&quot;FFO&quot<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/wink.gif" alt=":)" /> for the three-month period ended June 30, 2012, increased to $78.1 million, or $0.27 per diluted share, which compares to FFO of $52.6 million, or $0.19 per diluted share, for the prior-year comparable period.  The increase in FFO for the three-month period ended June 30, 2012, as compared to the same period in 2011, is primarily due to the gain on change in control of interests related to the Company's acquisition of two assets from an unconsolidated joint venture partially offset by the loss on debt extinguishment related to the Company's repurchase of a portion of its 9.625% unsecured notes in 2012.
<br /><br />FFO for the six-month period ended June 30, 2012 was $137.8 million, or $0.49 per diluted share, which compares to FFO of $145.5 million, or $0.45 per diluted share, for the prior-year comparable period.  The decrease in FFO for the six-month period ended June 30, 2012, as compared to the same period in 2011, is primarily due to the same factors impacting FFO as explained above in addition to the effect of the valuation adjustment associated with the warrants that were exercised in full for cash in the first quarter of 2011.
<br /><br />Net loss applicable to common shareholders for the three-month period ended June 30, 2012, was $44.5 million, or $0.16 per diluted share, which compares to net loss of $26.9 million, or $0.10 per diluted share, for the prior-year comparable period.  Net loss applicable to common shareholders for the six-month period ended June 30, 2012, was $66.5 million, or $0.24 per diluted share, which compares to net loss of $2.1 million, or $0.09 per diluted share, for the prior-year comparable period.  The increase in net loss applicable to common shareholders for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2012, as compared to the same periods in 2011, is primarily due to the same factors impacting FFO as explained above as well as an increase in impairment charges in the second quarter of 2012.
<br /><br />LEASING &amp; PORTFOLIO OPERATIONS
<br />The following results for the three-month period ended June 30, 2012, highlight continued strong leasing activity throughout the portfolio:
<br /><br />Executed 200 new leases aggregating 0.9 million square feet and 226 renewals aggregating approximately 1.8 million square feet
<br />The portfolio leased rate was 94.1% at June 30, 2012, as compared to 93.7% at March 31, 2012 and 93.0% at June 30, 2011 on a comparable basis
<br />The portfolio leased rate at June 30, 2012, including the 46 assets acquired on June 20, 2012 by the Blackstone joint venture, was 93.7%
<br />On a cash basis, rental rates for new leases increased by 10.7% at 100% ownership and 22.2% on a pro rata basis, and renewals by 6.1% at 100% ownership and 5.8% on a pro rata basis.  Overall, blended spreads were up 6.8% at 100% ownership and 8.3% on a pro rata basis. 
<br />Same store net operating income (&quot;NOI&quot<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/wink.gif" alt=":)" /> increased by 3.9% at 100% ownership for the three-month period ended June 30, 2012 as compared to the prior-year comparable period and 3.1% on a pro rata basis
<br />Total portfolio average annualized base rent per occupied square foot as of June 30, 2012 was $13.80, as compared to $13.46 at June 30, 2011 
<br />ACQUISITIONS &amp; FINANCINGS
<br />In June 2012, affiliates of the Company and The Blackstone Group L.P. (&quot;Blackstone&quot<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/wink.gif" alt=":)" /> closed a joint venture which acquired a portfolio of 46 shopping centers previously owned by EPN Group.  An affiliate of Blackstone owns 95% of the common equity of the joint venture, and the remaining 5% interest is owned by an affiliate of the Company.  The transaction is valued at approximately $1.4 billion.  The joint venture assumed approximately $635 million of senior non-recourse debt and entered into an additional $320 million of non-recourse debt with a five-year term. In addition, the Company funded the joint venture with $150 million in preferred equity with a fixed distribution rate of 10%, as well as its $17 million common equity funding.  The Company will continue to provide leasing and property management services and will have the right of first offer to acquire 10 of the assets under specified conditions.  The Company funded its investment with proceeds from the equity forward sale agreements entered into in January 2012 and settled in June 2012 for net proceeds of $231.2 million.   
<br /><br />In April 2012, the Company acquired its unconsolidated joint venture partner's 50% ownership interest in two prime power centers located in Portland, Oregon and Phoenix, Arizona for an aggregate purchase price of $70 million.  Tanasbourne Town Center in Portland, Oregon, is a large-format power center totaling 566,000 square feet.  The shopping center is anchored by national tenants including Target, Nordstrom Rack, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, Ross Dress For Less, Michaels, Old Navy and Petco.  Arrowhead Crossing in Phoenix, Arizona, is a large-format power center totaling 412,000 square feet. The shopping center is anchored by national tenants including Nordstrom Rack, DSW, T.J.Maxx, HomeGoods, Staples and Hobby Lobby.  The Company funded its $70 million investment with proceeds from the issuance of 4.8 million common shares at an average price of $14.64 per share through its at-the-market common equity program.  At closing, approximately $104 million of mortgage debt was repaid and the two assets are part of the Company's large unencumbered pool.  The Company recorded an aggregate gain of approximately $39.3 million in connection with the step-up of its investment basis to fair value due to the change in control that occurred.
<br /><br />In June 2012, the Company issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of 4.625% senior unsecured notes due July 2022.  Proceeds from the issuance were used to repay the 5.375% senior unsecured notes with an aggregate principal amount of $223.5 million at par scheduled to mature in October 2012 and repay amounts outstanding on the revolving credit facilities.
<br /><br />During the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2012, the Company repurchased $34.5 million and $60.0 million, respectively, aggregate principal amount of its outstanding 9.625% senior unsecured notes with a maturity date of March 2016 at a premium to par, resulting in a loss on debt retirement of $7.9 million and $13.5 million, respectively. 
<br /><br />On August 1, 2012, the Company expects to issue $200.0 million of its newly designated 6.50% Class J cumulative redeemable preferred shares at a price of $25.00 per depositary share.  In addition, in July 2012, the Company announced the redemption of its 7.50% Class I cumulative redeemable preferred shares at a redemption of price of $25.00 per depositary share plus accrued and unpaid dividends of $0.1875 per depositary share.  The proceeds from the issuance of the Class J shares are expected to be primarily used to redeem the Class I shares, which is expected to close on August 20, 2012.
<br /><br />DISPOSITIONS 
<br />The Company sold 15 consolidated assets, aggregating approximately 2.1 million square feet, in the second quarter of 2012, generating gross proceeds of approximately $60.4 million.  In addition, the Company sold $13.3 million of consolidated non-income producing assets.  The Company recorded an aggregate net gain of approximately $8.4 million related to asset sales in the second quarter of 2012. 
<br /><br />In the second quarter of 2012, the Company's unconsolidated joint ventures sold one asset generating gross proceeds of approximately $6.8 million, of which the Company's proportionate share was $1.4 million.  The aggregate gain on sale in the second quarter of 2012 was approximately $0.2 million, of which the Company's proportionate share was immaterial.
<br /><br />2012 GUIDANCE
<br />There has been no change in Operating FFO per share guidance since the last update provided on May 1, 2012.  The Company continues to estimate Operating FFO for 2012 between $1.00 and $1.04 per diluted share. 
<br /><br />NON-GAAP DISCLOSURES
<br />FFO is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measurement used as a standard in the real estate industry and a widely accepted measure of real estate investment trust (&quot;REIT&quot<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/wink.gif" alt=":)" /> performance. Management believes that FFO and Operating FFO provide additional indicators of the financial performance of a REIT. The Company also believes that FFO and Operating FFO more appropriately measure the core operations of the Company and provide benchmarks to its peer group. Neither FFO nor Operating FFO represents cash generated from operating activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (&quot;GAAP&quot<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/wink.gif" alt=":)" />, is necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs and should be considered as an alternative to net income computed in accordance with GAAP as an indicator of the Company's operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity.
<br /><br />FFO is defined and calculated by the Company as net income, adjusted to exclude: (i) preferred share dividends, (ii) gains and losses from disposition of depreciable real estate property, which are presented net of taxes, (iii) impairment charges on depreciable real estate property and related investments, (iv) extraordinary items and (iv) certain non-cash items. These non-cash items principally include real property depreciation and amortization of intangibles, equity income from joint ventures and equity income from non-controlling interests and adding the Company's proportionate share of FFO from its unconsolidated joint ventures and non-controlling interests, determined on a consistent basis. The Company calculates Operating FFO by excluding the non-operating charges and gains described above. The Company computes FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition as affirmed by NAREIT on October 31, 2011.  Other real estate companies may calculate FFO and Operating FFO in a different manner. FFO excluding the net non-operating items detailed above is useful to investors as the Company removes these charges and gains to analyze the results of its operations and assess performance of the core operating real estate portfolio. A reconciliation of net income (loss) to FFO and Operating FFO is presented in the financial highlights section of the Company's quarterly supplement.

Shay Miles collaborated with prolific photographer Arturo Torres and the beauty and style mavens of Evolving Images Inc. and Chinaka Hoshi, to channel a glamorous time-period in cinematic history.
<br /><br />ahr.es.ihm by R. Shay Miles™ presents Faith Garcia in her role as the gorgeous lead singer in ‘Ode to Sparkle’.  Based on the deliciousness of the striking silhouettes, femme fatale makeup, hip-swiveling and shoulder-shimmying performances from the 1976 film “Sparkle”, ahr.es.ihm™ by R. Shay Miles has designed a tribute collection to pay homage to the great glamour goddesses of the cinematic classic.
<br /><br />Setting the scene of a late-1950s in Vallejo, Calif. at the historical landmark, Empress Theatre, the editorial tribute captures a hybrid look of the film’s characters Sparkle and Sister, two members of a Supremes-esque local girl group; while also giving special recognition to the late Whitney Houston and her upcoming movie remake, “Sparkle” (2012).  One of the men responsible for making sure the period piece felt genuine is Johnny “Shotgun” Stokes, who paid intimate attention to the overall concept and wardrobe, and provided a 1937 Buick Oldsmobile from his showroom to make the scene feel authentic.  “After this tribute was conceived in December 2011, I obsessed over the details from the 1976 cult classic and challenged myself to design 21st century renderings, in support of the 2012 remake”, said R. Shay Miles.
<br /><br />The ‘Ode to Sparkle’ Collection is a quintessential experience that revisits the rules from the fashion time capsule when ‘ladies and gentlemen’ would step out in their finest attire and it reinforces the sultry, regal, and sophistication which is the innate nature of every woman.

And when I say anywhere, I imply that recollections are even designed underwater – so the creation of underwater digital digital camera.
<br /><br />An underwater digital camera is not just utilised to capture underwater memories some qualified marine photographers also use underwater digital cameras in their company. Even marine biologists and scientists use underwater digital cameras to capture marine life and hence be able to research the life and properties of the marine lifestyle. But I feel it is safe and sound to presume that you, my reader, are neither a marine scientist nor a professional photographer. Like me, you are just some photograph junkie who would like to capture underwater moments and just cant figure out how without having ruining your cameras.
<br /><br />Please pay attention to me when I say that even waterproof cameras can't withstand underwater photography. To be waterproof is to resist the water in certain ranges, submerging in beneath the water to get the great shot is like throwing it out of the window expecting a select-up truck to pass by and run in excess of it. 
<br /><br />Now if you’re genuinely severe about employing an underwater digital camera to capture individuals wacky and humorous moments underwater, I advise that you buy specialty cameras. 
<br /><br />There are seldom underwater digital cameras, as cameras are electronic and are not able to withstand water and water strain. The closest electronics has ever acquired to making underwater digital cameras are producing underwater casings for digital cameras. These casing will turn your traditional digital camera into an underwater digital camera. 
<br /><br />If you are shooting with your underwater digital digital camera, you need to take note of a number of items to support you come up with the ideal photos underwater.
<br /><br />Recall that as you farther under water, light diffuses. This indicates that your underwater digital digital camera will develop images darker than those images you took although on land – this is simply because of the light diffusion the red spectrum seems darker. To steer clear of this, use white stability come up with organic colours. Also, photographs taken underwater will come up more substantial than images taken on land with the exact same zoom effect. Be positive to examine your underwater digital camera’s viewfinder to test the appropriate image angle and size that you want.
<br /><br />An underwater digital digital camera with its created-in flash will generate marine demonstrate phenomenon. It is a phenomenon wherein your pictures come out as blurry and with white particles floating over it, to keep away from this phenomenon it is recommended to use external flash for your underwater digital digital camera.
<br /><br />In advance of making use of your underwater digital camera, submerge the camera in the water very first for many seconds then check out if there are leaks by way of the situation. Make certain that no grain of sand or piece of hair is caught in involving the seal to make certain that water will not permeate the situation and hence wet your digital camera in the method. It is also a good idea to put silica gel or two within the case of your underwater digital digital camera as long as they don’t disturb the camera’s operation. (Silica gel will retain the moisture from forming inside your camera situation.)
<br /><br />Most underwater digital cameras come with optional lenses. Don’t be afraid to add these lenses to your underwater digital digital camera kit. Macro lenses will help you capture modest factors with out receiving also close and startling your topic. 
<br /><br />Also, remember to often wash of salt when you’ve employed it underneath salt water. If the salts are not washed off, in time they will crystallize act as sands and bring about leaks for your camera case. In scenarios when sands appear to get into the case, they are much better washed off with streams of water. 
<br /><br />Test out Sony, Nikon and Canon’s web page for accessible underwater cases for your digital cameras.
