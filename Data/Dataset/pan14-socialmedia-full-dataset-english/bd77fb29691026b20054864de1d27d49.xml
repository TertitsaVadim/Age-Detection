<br />I logged on my e-mail and saw your name
<br />It's been months since I've even thought of you
<br />Months since we were torn apart
<br />This Christmas you sent me an e-mail
<br />that made me cry 
<br />I wanted to die
<br />This Christmas, after all this time
<br />I felt that pain I haven't felt in awhile
<br />You know I won't e-mail you back
<br />You know I won't call
<br />And yet you still sent me something for Christmas
<br />This Christmas
<br />after all this time
<br />I wish you would just forget me now
<br />and move on...

<br /> I bet you can't even speak 
<br />without feeling that sting of guilt in you heart right now. 
<br />'Cause you know I'm right. 
<br />And you know you're wrong. 
<br />You know I've been only trying to help,
<br /> and you've just been pushing me away.
<br /> But you don't want to admit that.
<br /> No, you'd rather lose our friendship 
<br />then admit that you've been wrong all this time. 
<br />But you know that I won't give up without a fight.
<br /> So just keep on trying. 
<br />Guess whose eyes are going to be bleeding tears tonight? 
<br />Not mines. 
<br />Guess whose gonna be staring into space thinking of ways to lie? 
<br />Not me. 
<br />Guess whose gonna be tossing around in the bed, 
<br />unable to sleep off the guilt they built? 
<br />Sure hell ain't me. 
<br />So just keep on trying. 
<br />You'll just be hurting yourself in the end. 
<br />And when you're finally ready to come back,
<br /> you'll know where to find me.

<br /><br />On new years we get drunk, find new love, party hard and then puck the shit out the next day. (well others do, I just sit back and laugh at my friends VERY loudly) Some other people (like me) sit at home and read threw all the &quot;fan mail&quot; in their inbox, having no life at all. And on days like this I list all the horrible things that is wrong with my life. Guess I'll start with the bad list:
<br /><br />Bad list:
<br />No bf/gf 
<br />5 friends dead due to suicide
<br />family hates me
<br />dad beats me
<br />friends are pretty much leaving me
<br /><br />Things to make this list go away:
<br />Fall in love with the right person
<br />Be thankful for the ones who stayed
<br />Love my family even more
<br />ignore my dad
<br />hold close to the ones who cares. 
<br /><br />Well yeah so theres my resolutions. They all seem to go to the same thing. Keep myself in high spirits. I need my friends and I need a partner, but I don't need them all the time. I won't HAVE them all the time. So I have to depend on myself. I guess in away I always have but like, I needed my friends to hold onto me so I could hold on to them. But no more. I've lost too many and I've seen to much. Hell I'm leaving high school this year. What am i going to do when my friends and I split up once and for all? I have to take care of myself first off this new year. Don't get me wrong, I'll still help my buds out, just not over really dumb shit (i.e. homework)
<br /><br />Well thats all I have to say. If you read all of this then takes, you've made my new years much better. If not well you won't be reading the ending of this anyway so fuck you. lol j/k/ Happy New Years y'all. Hope good things start off well for you.

I try so hard to keep myself up and my pain down. But even one, small, simple mistake, can crush my soul like nothing...
<br />I fell for a guy that I thought loved me. And I acted so much more...different, just so he could love me more...And then...I get so confused. So confused with him, my friends and everyone else around me. I let myself change when I was with him and then..poof. I see a side of me I didn't want to see...ever. And now I feel...I don't know...shame. A lot of shame. And the mistake was so simple. So fucking simple. I allowed myself to think something I knew wasn't there. I convinced myself that everything was going to be alright. But it's not. Not for a long time. I just...can't believe how simple it is...to make one tiny little mistake and then...poof. My life is just going up in the flames...and it's my fault. Not his, not my friends, not my family. No one but me. And you know what? I'm gonna fix it. Odds are by time my friends read this I'll be smile again and I won't talk about it. Not now, not ever...well..I gotta go...Don't make simple mistakes..no matter how small.

<br />I see a pretty girl
<br />with dark hair, brown eyes
<br />and a cool pink smile
<br />I see her pulling a hot comb threw her scalp
<br />winching at the heat as it nears her ears
<br />I see her brushing her teeth
<br />Going up down, left right
<br />A ritual
<br />I see her pulling her school uniform over her head
<br />royal blue with an eye, world in center
<br />I see her making sure her dress pants won't sag
<br />from the lost wight 
<br />and then buckles the belt in place
<br />I see this pretty girl studying her herself, 
<br />ignoring the fact that she is running out of time
<br />I see her brown eyes glow sad,
<br />her cool pink smile gone
<br />I see her lips open 
<br />A sigh escapes
<br />I see this pretty girl close her eyes
<br />avoiding the image of herself
<br />I relive last nights pain
<br />I feel the nightmares I had
<br />The ugliness I try to hide
<br />The every lasting engulfing pain
<br />of lost lovers and new comers
<br />who have no place in my life
<br />and yet are still there
<br />Then I re-open my eyes
<br />And I see a pretty girl
<br />with tearful brown eyes,
<br />a sad pink smile
<br />and pain
<br />I see her wiping her face as her mother knocks on the door
<br />Time to go to school
<br />and live another day
<br />without that pretty girl.

I get this thoughts and began to see everything as a beautiful ending. Death becomes my friend, and everywhere I go I see the blood of others on my hands, I feel the excitement of someone banging their hands on my arms, trying to breath threw water. I love it. But then I began to feel depress, alone, forgotten. Instead of wanting to kill others I wish to harm myself. I began to see every blade, every tub, every match as a tool of self-distraction. There have been times where I've almost gone threw with it. But as always, new thoughts come into my head, and then I began to see everything as it was. Maybe not beautiful but perfect the way it is. I wish not to hurt others, I wish not to end myself. Some times I wonder if this is some common test I have to take every so often. What if I acted out on my feelings? What if I really did decide to kill someone? What if I did take my own life? Would the world be better off, would I go to hell? I don't know. And I don't want to know. And yet I do... I don't know. I don't get it at all. Why do I feel this way? Hm...Oh and by the by, I'm in phase two of this mood right now. I want to die so badly and I can't understand why. I'm looking at this letter opened shaped like a sword, and I have it press agisnt my skin. The feel of its cool metal is so...pleasurably good. Yet I'm afraid to cut. I don't want to see my blood. Not this way anyway. I'll might bust my knuckles agisnt the bathroom wall and watch as my hand bleeds for a short moment. 
<br /><br />I just don't know what's wrong with me...

Away on some island, deep in underground water caves, buried in the dusty floor. But I can't. I can never get people out of my head, I can never forget about those I loved so much, and I know I can't forget about the people who have changed me over and over again. I've done wrong and have never looked back. I've killed myself with every little word and phrase just so I could be numb. I haven't had a moments rest with all my nightmares, all my fears, all my pain, shame, and whatever else, building up inside of me and exploding into hundreds of faces that mock me.My dad didn't call again, and the last time I saw him he hit me. My mom has been okay I suppose, but I still thinks she's mad at me for who knows what. My sisters and older brother are normal. My friends...the ones that are still here...Have been trying to help me out, but I don't see how they can help at this point. And like, I keep seeing &quot;him&quot; in my inbox, reading his letters, wanting to talk to him but I know I can't. I just can't cross the line again. Because no matter how well I hide it, no matter how well I try to cover up, my family always finds out.  I want to tell &quot;him&quot; I'm sorry. I want to cry to &quot;him&quot; and just get all of my feelings out. I want &quot;him&quot; to be happy. But I suppose I want to be happy too...Truth be told I don't know what I want anymore. I'm just a kid. A kid who wants to make her life meaningful, filled with magic, love, and crouge. But thats a dream...I just want to hide...Hide so badly. I want to cover my face in shame. I want to tell &quot;him&quot; I&quot;m sorry. I want to be perfect for everyone. I want to make everything right. I just want to be left alone, and be happy. Why can't I be happy?

Why should I care if, she askes me to go out with her and he calls? Or me justing wanting to talk but she's busy alraedy talking to him? Yeah yeah. It's not a big deal. I&quot;m just crying cause I have nothing better to do. Yeah, that's it. Just crying cause I have nothing better to do. Nothing bettter to see or hear....Oh God who am I kidding...I'm crying because I want my mom back. I want to be able to talk to her again you know? No one seems to understand that, even though she makes me mad, she's still my mom, and the one person I want the most to understand me. Cause that's what moms are suppose to do, ya know? They're suppose to listen to you when you're upset, or when you're super happy or when you just want to chat about whatever. They're suppose to be there for you, and my mom is there for me. And you know, I want to tell her. I want to tell her so badly. I want to go up to her and say, &quot;Hey mom. Listen to me. I'm still here and I'm still you daugther.&quot; But I can't. I can't bring myself to take away the one thing that is helping her out of her depression. Even if it means I can't have her anymore. I guess...I guess that's what I'm expected to do anyway....So I'm just going to sit here and cry and cry until I can't cry anymore. I'm going smile tomorrow and act like nothing ever happen. I'm going to be normal, because that's all I can be right now. Not myself, not crazy and wild...Just another normal teen with problems and issues....

<br /><br />I decided to start a new journal. Yeah me! So like, my head is throbbing like no tomorrow, my hormones are rushing like race stallions and from the looks of it, I’m doomed to forever live in a life with no relations. I don’t get it. I have done my best to be a good person (minus the craziness of course) and I still mange to fuck everything up. 
<br />	To begin with, one of my closet friends is having problems in his life, and I’m not really being any help. To be honest, I think I’m making things worse for him. All I can do is tell him what I know, and listen to him. And I feel so stupid when all I can do is listen. I feel helpless to a helpless person and everything becomes pointless in the long run. I don’t even understand how everything even started. How things have change so much for all of us. (I pretty sure they know who I’m talking about)
<br />	Another thing that has been bugging me is that I want to be with someone so badly now. I mean, it’s almost to the point that I’ll take just about anyone. I don’t understand why I’m going “a-wall” with my hormones and stuff. It’s almost like I’m losing myself in a never ending battle of tug-o’-war between “love before lust” and “lust before love”. The more I want to be with someone emotionally, the more I become aware of my sexual wants/needs. The more I become aware of these wants/needs the more I want to be with someone emotionally. So confusing, right? I don’t know what I want anymore. Or do I know what I want and just don’t know how to get it? Huh…I don’t know. Well, whatever I want, I sure hope it’ll fix itself before I fuck up big time. 
<br />	Maybe I just want to be loved too much. I mean, it is common for teenage girls, who pretty much grew up without a father figure, would want to be with a guy that they could love to no other world. But, I think it might also with my need to be with people in general. See, after my dad left us (I was five) my mom went into such a depression and pretty much locked me out of her world. It might not seem like it in pictures, and videos, but believe me, behind childish smiles and bright eyes, deep down, a new type of little girl was being born. I tell my mom almost everything in my life. Well I use to anyway. Now I just tell her simple things and about people I’m close too. She doesn’t understand me, and I’m tried of trying to explain myself to her. I have friends that I can talk to anyway about things that bug me. Well…Sometimes I do. Of late, I wonder if I really have friends that listen, or just strangers that stare at me, wondering why I’m talking to them. I know I know, I shouldn’t say things like that, because I do have real friends that love me and I love them…But I just can’t help but wonder sometimes. 
<br />	Hee…That’s strange. I want to be loved so badly. And yet, when I am loved, I’m afraid to accept it. Guess that’s just a thing with trust. I want to entrust my heart to my friends and love ones, but if I fully allow them to see who I am and can be, would they still love me? 
<br />	God damn it! Why the hell do I do this to myself! Of course they would still love me! They told me so. They told me and I just don’t want to believe them. I’m so stupid. So damn stupid. 
<br />	I guess I’ll stop for now. If I keep going, I’ll have a whole book by time I’m done…Wow…So much on my mind. So much and so little I can say right now…I wish I had someone real to talk too. Someone solid and not judging. Someone I know would never use harsh words to hurt me, but help me understand me better. I wish…No…I’ stop now. I need to stop…I’m sorry…later…

It was pretty much just innocent flirting. We both know each other pretty well and so he knew how to get me back for making horny. 
<br /><br />The next day though, it was cold and I was hungry so we went to his place to eat. After we were done eating, we went into his room since it's the only place in the whole apartment that has heating. We just chilled on his bed, me laying down, while he sat up watching tv. He laid down after awhile and I put my head on his chest and began to tease him again. The next thing I know his licking my neck, and it throws me off guard. I don't know what to do, and soon I find myself kissing him, and we're making out on his bed for about an hour all of a sudden. I was kinda freaked out but really didn't think much of it when he took me home or the next day when I saw him again. In fact, he didn't bring it up until we were in his folks car (he had to drop them off at the airport that day) and he asked me what I though of the other night. I told him it was wried cause I liked it, but, it was him. One of my best friends, and just...yeah so wried. 
<br /><br />Well we drove to Burger King, ate and then went to drop some stuff off at his place. This is were things got strange. I went into his room and was looking at all the neat stuff he had and he was hugging me from behind. He started tickling me and I pretty much backed toward the bed cause that was the only place I could go. He began to lick my neck again, and yeah, I was pretty much gone. We made out again, only this time he asked if he could lick me &quot;down there&quot; and I really am not comfortable with that so I said no. Then he asked me if I would give him a blow job and I was so fucking horny and confused I just said, &quot;OK&quot; and went for it. After that we just laid there, both lost in our own thoughts.  
<br /><br />We really haven't gotten the chance to talk about it really. And I can't stop thinking about it. This is something I've never done before and the fact it happened with my friend, well. I've always been told that anything sexual, be it just kissing or the whole way, is suppose to be with the one person you love dearly. No orgies, nothing. And yet, here I am, making out with a friend who I have no very strong feelings for...Or I do but I'm not sure if those are the feelings of a silly girl crush or actual love. I dunno, I'm confused about that too. But back to the point. I was raised one way, and now I'm being told by friends that it's OK to have a friend with benefits and that I shouldn't feel bad about anything.
<br /><br />But that's the thing. If I'm not suppose to feel bed, how come I know for a fact if I do tell my mom, she would kill me and then my friend on the spot? This is the type of stuff I would want my mom's help on but I can't ask for help because I know it isn't how she raised me. *sighs* 
<br /><br />I have a lot of question and I'm pretty sure no one will be able to answear them fully. Accept my friend of crouse. We need to talk, but I can't and it's annoying cause we can't talk, cause I&quot;m not allowed to call people when I'm grounded and he doesn't have a computer and grrrr....It's all a big mess...Can someone please help me??

<br /><br />I sat with him and just hugged him, petting his hair like I always do, because I never know what to say. We joked and I was getting blushie again. He saw it too...We kept teasing, and I kept telling myself I need to get home and think about what I need to do. But I wanted to stay with him so badly...Wanted to let him know I would always be there for him, like a friend should be, right? 
<br /><br />We went to his house. This time, I knew I wanted to kiss him. I wanted to hold him and just be there for him. And my God, it was amazing. 
<br /><br />We almost went too far, but he knows me and respected that I still don't want to have sex. He held me close to him, and I just felt so safe in his arms. I wonder what he was thinking about...I wanted to ask him, but he asked me suddenly if he had hurt me. We didn't have sex, but I'm on my period, and yeah, for some reason it hurts more when you let someone rub you like that. I told him a little, but it was OK cause I didn't mind. I was happy just to know he was there. I'm still happy. Just thinking about how I felt with him makes me happy. 
<br /><br />But it also makes me sad, because now, I understand myself a little more and just how much I need someone in my life I can really count on. I feel like I'm lieing to myself of late, telling myself that I don't need him or anyone else in my world. That I can hold my own and I'm strong. But I'm not...I'm not strong enough to face this on my own. I mean look at me, I'm asking complete strangers for help. People that I will never meet face to face or even remember when I'm old and tried of the whole computer thing. That's sad...
<br /><br />I'm also sad, because I'm afraid to tell him now how I'm feeling about all of this. I mean, sure I had my chance, and won't have another for the rest of this month (unless I sneak out again) but I mean...really, what can I say at this point? &quot;Hey, I love you. Let's hook up?&quot; *shakes head* No..I can't do that. I can't because if I do, what would we do? We can't hook up because of our different ages. If we keep goofing around like this, we might end up in a bigger, more, terrible mess. I mean, it's so strange.
<br /><br />Hee...You know it's funny. The other night I had a dream that we were at his house, and it was the night before my birthday this year. We were kissing again, and he looked at me and asked if I wanted him to be my first. I looked back and said, &quot;You know I&quot;m technically not 18 until 12:01 right?&quot; and he said, &quot;I can wait a little longer.&quot; We laughed and yeah...the dream went further but I won't go into that. I woke up thinking about it, and I had this wried, excited/confused/dizzy feeling about all of it. What if I did allow him to be my first? What if I allowed him to have sex with me at all? All these question, from a teenage girl whose always been told to wait for the right one. To wait and wait, and I want to wait. I want my fairytale dream to come true. But now I'm not sure....I want to ask him...I think I might. I'll ask him what would he do if I asked him to be my first and if he would? I just want to know...
<br /><br />God, look at me. Once upon a time, I was a shy, outspoken, blushie little girl who knew what she wanted out of life and what she expected in return. Now I'm a shy, outspoken, bold, blushie, almost legal adult, who knows what she wants out of her professional life but not her personal life and has no idea what to expect out of life. Sure I my confidence as a beautiful black woman living in America has been booted up, and yeah, I have become more bold in what I do...But I'm now I'm afraid to face this whole &quot;love&quot; thing and can't even tell the person I think I love that I do...I wish I didn't have emotions sometimes. I'm more emotional then I like to admit.
<br /><br />A lot more...*sighs* I guess I'm done talking for now. There's so much to say, but I feel that I need to say them to him first. There's so much to say...
<br /><br />Thanks for listening though...

Let’s travel to a new world, filled with the magic of hope and peace. No one here cries for the lost of love ones, because the love ones live on as the many colorful butterflies fluttering in the gardens. No one here knows what war is because the lust for blood was never known. Nothing dies in vain, because everything lives in a perfect cycle, and death is another form of helping the world grow. There are no gods to choose from, no mad leaders, no priest telling lies to a mass of foolish people. No my little angel, this world is perfect. And it can be our world. We can go there, and live with everyone else, and never worry about war, and sadness and pain and famine. So come with me little angel, come with me tonight, as we finish our bedtime story.
