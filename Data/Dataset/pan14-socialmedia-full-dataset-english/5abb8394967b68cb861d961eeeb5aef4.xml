But even if you don’t know anyone, you’re touched by it. It’s a small world.<br />“It’s a really sad thing. ”<br /><br />A third Ottawa connection to the crash was defenceman Vitaly Anikeyenko, who was the team’s second draft pick (third round, 70th overall) in 2005. He never made it to North america, staying in Russia to play with Lokomotiv, an organization he joined in 2002-03.<br /><br />On Wednesday afternoon, the Senators issued a statement of sympathy:<br /><br />“The Ottawa Senators organization is deeply saddened by the news of the tragic plane crash today in Russia. On behalf of the hockey club and all of our fans, we want to extend our sincere condolences to the family and friends of the players, coaches and staff who died, including Senators draft pick Vitaly Anikeyenko, and former players Pavol Demitra <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wholesaler-china.com%2Fjerseys-nhl-"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.wholesaler-china.com/jerseys-nhl-</a>  and Karel Rachunek. Our thoughts and prayers are with them. ”<br /><br />For the players, only one word fit: shocked.<br /><br />“I was shocked when i heard it and I still am, ” Kuba said. “It’s a terrible thing. It’s hard to believe that something like that has happened. Good guys and good players.<br /><br />“I don’t have the words for it. ”<br /><br />In a couple of stints with CSKA Moscow, Ottawa left-winger Nikita Filatov had crossed paths with a number of the Lokomotiv players.<br /><br />When he woke up Wednesday morning, turned on his computer and read about the crash, he couldn’t believe it.<br /><br />“It just shows how quickly it can end, in just a moment, ” he said. “Nobody expects it, but it can be over in just one minute. ”<br /><br />Alfredsson said a plane crash is tragic whenever it happens, but obviously hits closer to home when it’s someone from your own profession. However, the crash is not going to make him fearful about flying.<br /><br />“It is safe to travel by plane, ” he said. “I’m not worried about that, but you also know that if something happens, it’s not going to end well, usually.<br /><br />“It’s what we do in our job, and a lot of people do it - they fly a lot.<br /><br />“I’m not worried, personally, that it’s going to happen. If it does, it does. The way things are regulated, I’m confident in flying. ”

They met only twice in the first two months of the lockout that began July 1.<br /><br />But they went for about six hours last Wednesday, and decided they would go multiple days this week. Both sides said they could even carry over the discussions into a third consecutive day if things go well during Thursday’s session.<br /><br />“We agreed that we’re going to sit here for as many days as we can to see whether we can make progress, but we agreed not to characterize anything at all, ” Commissioner David Stern said.<br /><br />Both sides were cautious not to portray any optimism-though one player briefly did on Twitter, before saying his account had been hacked-or any other feelings about what was happening in the room at a midtown hotel. They said last week they wanted details of the discussions to remain private and seem intent on keeping that vow.<br /><br />“It’s tough to characterize it in one fashion or another. Obviously, the more we have the opportunities to meet, talk and discuss and really try to figure out how we can put a deal together, the better, so you can characterize that as positive in a sense, ” union president of the Lakers said. “But to characterize what comes out of the meetings and whether we’re making progress or we have momentum, we can’t say and it’s tough to say. Until the deal is done, there is no deal. ”<br /><br />Stern was joined on the owners’ side by Deputy Commissioner Adam Silver, San Antonio Spurs <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.zozbuy.com%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.zozbuy.com/</a>  owner Peter Holt, who heads the labor relations committee, and NBA senior vice president and deputy general counsel Dan Rube. The union negotiators were Fisher, executive vice president Billy Hunter, attorneys Jeffrey Kessler and Ron Klempner, and economist Kevin Murphy.<br /><br />Shortly after the meeting, Knicks guard Roger Mason Jr., a member of the players’ executive committee, wrote “Looking like a season. How u” on his Twitter page. He later deleted that post and wrote a subsequent one that his account had been hacked.<br /><br />Hunter, who long held a pessimistic view of the negotiations, said he thought clearly “there’s more than enough time” for a deal to be reached that would allow this season’s schedule to remain intact. Training camps would likely open Oct. 3, the first preseason games are Oct. 9, and the regular season opener is Nov. 1.<br /><br />Those long seemed in jeopardy as the sides remained far apart on most financial issues when the old collective bargaining agreement expired at the end of the day June 30. They then didn’t meet again until Aug. 1, then not again until last Wednesday.<br /><br />But both sides recognize that progress must be made soon, or the threat of losing games to a work stoppage for only the second time in league history will increase.<br /><br />“There’s a window here. We have an opportunity to make some progress, to try to hammer some things out, ” Fisher said.<br /><br />“Time is running down, not necessarily out, but I think we all feel in the room that if we continue to work at it we can possibly find a way to get a deal done. ”<br /><br />Each side has filed a charge against the other with the National Labor Relations Board <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.zozbuy.com%2FWholesale-Discount-nba-basketball-jerseys_c10.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.zozbuy.com/Wholesale-Discount-nba-basketball-jerseys_c10.html</a>  for unfair bargaining practices, and the league also filed a federal lawsuit against the players seeking to block them from using decertification of the union as a tactic. Fisher and the union negotiators were getting an update from outside counsel on where things stand with the legal matters after the meeting.<br /><br />But perhaps the more frequent talks can allow the players and owners to take care of things themselves without court interference.<br /><br />“We know we have a real problem to solve and there’s nothing personal about these negotiations, it’s going to be about problem solving, ” Stern said. “If we can, we can. If we can’t, we can’t, but we’ve agreed not to talk about it. ”

Packers: Matt Flynn. Flynn should be a highly coveted free agent in 2012 as teams look at him as the next potential Matt-turned-fine starter, following Schaub and Cassel. Last season, he proved he could handle the gig in Green Bay's high-flying offense with a solid fill-in performance for Aaron Rodgers in a loss to Tom Brady and New England.<br /><br />2. Patriots: Brian Hoyer. As the man behind Brady, Hoyer is being looked at the in the same light as Cassel, who guided New England to a 10-6 record in '08 after Brady went down in Week 1 to the team to which Cassel was eventually traded, the Chiefs.<br /><br />3. Falcons: Chris Redman. Redman has survived coaching and scheme changes to emerge as a strong backup option for Matt Ryan. His starting experience for Baltimore and Atlanta is his biggest asset.<br /><br />4. Chargers: Billy Volek. Volek first made his mark backing up the late Steve McNair in Tennessee, and then helped San Diego win a 2007 divisional playoff game over Manning's Colts while taking over in the fourth quarter for Philip Rivers.<br /><br />5. Bears: Caleb Hanie. Hanie gave Chicago a chance to compete with Rodgers' Packers in the last year's NFC championship game after Jay<br /><br />6. Saints: Chase Daniel. Daniel was a prolific passer at the University of Missouri, and sharing an undersized stature with Drew Brees, he has quietly learned well from his passionate competitor of a mentor. Daniel has come of age in the preseason.<br /><br />7. Eagles: Vince Young. Exit Kevin Kolb, and enter Young to be a mobile, experienced No. 2 for Michael Vick. Philadelphia also has a pretty good No. 3 option in second-year player Mike Kafka, who battled Young closely for the top reserve job.<br /><br />8. Steelers: Charlie Batch. This was the most talked about backup quarterback situation early last season while Ben Roethlisberger was serving his four-game suspension. Batch, who started in Week 3 and 4, held the fort with a 1-1 record and set up the Steelers to resume their march to the Super Bowl.<br /><br />9. Ravens: Tyrod Taylor. Joe Flacco has proved to be very durable in his three years as Baltimore's starter right from his rookie season, and now he's being backed up by a rookie sixth-round pick who impressed his coaching staff enough to the point where it might be better off than if the team still had veteran Marc Bulger.<br /><br />10. Jets: Mark Brunell. New York officials were impressed by rookie seventh-round pick Greg McElroy, but a thumb ailment forced them to put him on injured reserve. So back is the well-seasoned Brunell to back up Mark Sanchez. Although he's two years older than Collins, he has less wear recently and a successful Super Bowl backup stint behind Brees on his resume.<br /><br />Packers: Matt Flynn,. Patriots: Brian Hoyer, Falcons: Chris Redman, Chargers: Billy Volek, 5. Bears: Caleb Hanie, Saints: Chase Daniel, Eagles: Vince Young, Steelers: Charlie Batch, Ravens: Tyrod Taylor, Jets: Mark Brunell

This year there are several good reasons for making such a claim. The 2010 Chargers finished last season as the number one team in both offense and defense. Despite those heady statistics the Bolts failed to win their division or even make the playoffs. Why? Because their special teams were NFL record type bad and cost them at least two or three games. Head coach Norv Turner and General Manager A.J. Smith deserve all the credit and blame for a forgetful 2010. Smith addressed this team's problems by acquiring some key veterans, drafting special team players, and by hiring several new coaches. If the Bolts can turn their special teams around, then they will win their division again and rejoin the post-season tournament.<br /><br />BUILDING ON 2010<br /><br />The NFL's number one offense (in yards) is led by Philip Rivers who is in his prime and considered one of the elite QBs in the league. If one compares his numbers to Peyton Manning's over the past two years Rivers has outperformed his rival and has a better passer rating. Despite injuries that forced him to throw to seventeen different receivers, Rivers still led all QBs in passing yardage in 2010. He probably has the tallest set of receivers to throw to that any quarterback ever enjoyed. If Jackson, Floyd, and Gates can stay healthy, Rivers might even crack the 5,000 yard plateau. Rivers was undefeated in December until last year and is hungry to return to the playoffs. He's a proven winner who has blossomed under Turner and is determined to win it all. I'm sure Turner would prefer Rivers not throw for 5,000+ yards and instead have a more balanced attack for defenses to worry about. After a good preseason second year running back Ryan Matthews looks poised to have his first 1,000 yard season. Injuries prevented him from breaking out last season so fullback Mike Tolbert was called upon to do his best impression of a tailback and he didn't disappoint. Both backs have surprising speed and a nose for the endzone. The same offensive line returns with capable backups so this unit will be scoring a lot of points this season.<br /><br />The number one rating for the defense was something of a surprise considering that Smith got rid of two Pro Bowl players in Merriman and Cromarte. The secondary actually played better and the pass rush improved without those two. The Bolts were number one against the pass and better than average against the run. Now that two other teams in their division (KC and Oakland) are so good at running the ball the Bolts must improve against the run. The addition of Takeo Spikes and Bob Sanders should help improve the run defense as well as bring veterans leadership to this squad.<br /><br />As good as the other two units were, the special teams were down right embarrassing last season. It seems that every week they gave up a kick return for a TD or had a punt blocked. As a result a new special teams coach was brought in. Rich Bisaccia, who did a good job in Tampa Bay<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5lYnV5bWFya2V0LmNvbS8_" target="_blank">/</a>, seems to have solved the nightmares of 2010. He has one of the best punters in the league in Scifres and Kaeding continues to be the NFL's most accurate kicker. If this unit can avoid mistakes and do it's job of winning the battle of field position, then the Bolts will be playing games in late January.<br /><br />THE OFFENSE<br /><br />The same cast returns from last year with the exception of Sproles who is now a Saint. The other backs will pick up the slack as Matthews, Tolbert, and Hester will be catching more screens and dump passes in 2011. Vincent Jackson was franchised so he's making about $10 million more this season than last so he's a happy camper. Floyd, who was allowed to test free agency, came back to bookend this skyscraper receiving corp. Patrick Crayton<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5lYnV5bWFya2V0LmNvbS9qZXJzZXlzLW5mbC1qZXJzZXlzLWMtNjVfNjYuaHRtbA__" target="_blank">l</a> adds veteran experience while youngsters Goodman, Brown, and Walters bring speed to the mix. Antonio Gates began training camp in pain as his foot problems continue. This may be the most important foot in football as it supports a future Hall of Fame tight end who is also Rivers' favorite target. The biggest question will probably be: &quot;Can he stay healthy long enough to contribute in the post-season?&quot; Randy McMichael is an experienced backup and third stringer Kory Sperry has shown ability to get open. When Smith signed Jeromey Clary to return as the right tackle the GM might have overpaid him, but he maintained the continuity of an offensive line that boasts three Pro Bowl players (LT McNeill, LG Dielman, and center Hardwick). Louis Vasquez continues as the right guard while backups Green, Mruczkowski, and Dombrowski all have spot started in the past. Rivers is not only good, he's also durable. If he does get injured, then experienced backup Billy Volek will step in and get the job done. Matthews, who had such a disappointing 2010, seems primed to have a breakout year. Look for him to not only rush for over 1,000 yards, but also catch more passes as well. Tolbert will be counted on in short yardage situations to pick up the tough real estate. If this squad can cut down on fumbles and stupid penalties, then it should be the NFL's best offense again in 2011.<br /><br />THE DEFENSE<br /><br />Greg Manusky replaces Ron Rivera as the new defensive coordinator with the challenge to maintain this team's number one status. That lofty status last season as the number one yardage defense was a little deceptive since they were only number ten in scoring defense. However, they were the best pass defense in the league and tied for second in sacks. They were good against the run (number four), but inconsistent. AJ Smith made his number one draft pick a defensive end to help matters. Cory Liuget seems undersized for the position and has been blown off the line consistently in preseason. The Bolts may do better to have veteran Jacques Cesaire start and use Liuget as a designated pass rusher because he's relentless in his pursuit of quarterbacks. Antonio Garay emerged as the number one nose tackle and had a fine season. He returns as well as Luis Castillo at the other end. Vaughn Martin could break into the starting lineup at either end and Cam Thomas backs up Garay at nose tackle. In another move to help against the run Smith acquired 14 year veteran linebacker Takeo Spikes to play in the middle. Second year man Donald Butler will be a virtual rookie starting at the other middle spot. Butler missed all of 2010 with an injury and is sure to benefit form Spikes' experience. If Spikes gets hurt the Bolts have little experience to back him up because after veteran Ni'll Diggs there are only rookies Mouton and Gachkar left. This is undoubtedly the weakest link in the Chargers defense. The outside linebackers are led by Pro Bowler Shaun Phillips who was the Bolts best pass rusher in 2010. Who starts opposite him is anyone's guess as Travis LaBoy, Larry English, Antwan Barnes, and rookie Darryl Gamble all have a shot. My guess is that LaBoy will start with Barnes in on passing situations and English riding the bench nursing another injury. Smith also added a former Defensive Player of the Year in Bob Sanders. The ex-Colt hasn't played much in recent years due to injuries, but if he can play just half the schedule at strong safety he will add to this unit's toughness and experience. He teams up with free safety Eric Weddle to make one of the best safety tandums in the league. Quentin Jammer returns for a tenth season as one the the NFL's most consistent corners. He's joined by Antoine Cason at the other corner and Dante Hughes as the nickelback. Steve Gregory and Darrell Stuckey backup the safeties while rookies Marcus Gilchrist and Shareece Wright are in reserve at the corner spot. The defense may take a step back due to it's weakness at middle linebacker, but the secondary will hold up against the pass in the fourth quarter when opponents try to catch up to the Bolt's high scoring offense.<br /><br />SPECIAL TEAMS<br /><br />Last season the loss of Pro Bowlers Kassim Osgood and David Binn certainly hurt the special teams, but even their exit couldn't explain the wholesale collapse of this unit. New coach Rich Bisaccia certainly has his work cut out for him as he must mold a unit that will protect the punter better, smother kick returners, and open lanes for the Bolts' young returners to set up Rivers and company with good field position. It's not clear right now who the returners will be yet, but Walters, Goodman, and Crayton will all probably get a chance to return kickoffs with Cason as the main punt returner. Mike Windt replaces long time (17 years) long snapper David Binn and has big shoes to fill. He'll combine with Scifres as the holder and Keading doing placements as they attempt to continue Nate's record accuracy. If Scifres gets just average protection he should again be one of the NFL's top punters. Basaccia's boys will be under the microscope for the first few weeks of the season to see if they can avoid last season's mistakes and return this squad to being one of the NFL's best.<br /><br />CONCLUSION<br /><br />Many believe the Chargers are one of the best teams in the league, but have yet to prove they can succeed in the playoffs and get to the Super Bowl. The competition in the AFC is stiff as the Patriots, Steelers, and Colts have all won Super Bowls in recent years. One of the things Rivers is missing in his resume is a ring. After this season that will be corrected and the Bolts s will finally earn the name: SUPERCHARGERS.<br />Tampa Bay,Patrick Crayton, Kory Sperry ,Louis Vasquez,steelers jerseys <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy53aG9sZXNhbGVyLWNoaW5hLmNvbS9qZXJzZXlzLW5mbC1qZXJzZXlzLWMtNjVfOTYuaHRtbA__" target="_blank">l</a>

But like right now I love my driver so we would never switch for any reason.<br /><br />LONG TOM: Cobra’s latest weapon in the driver distance wars is the Long Tom, a 48-inch all-black driver with a face made from a new titanium alloy that Cobra says is stronger than its previous drivers.<br /><br />The club weighs just 269 grams and comes with a Grafalloy Blackbird shaft and a Winn Ultra Light/Shorty grip that’s so small as to discourage players from choking down on the club. Not that one would want to choke down on a club that’s four feet long.<br /><br />The Long Tom will be in stores in late November, while in October the company will release 500 Long Tom RAW models, with no cosmetic or paint treatments to the clubhead. Just in case you’ve been tired of looking at white drivers all year.

But Guillen’s website eliminated much of the drama by leaking the news he has agreed to become the Marlins’ manager.<br /><br />A post Monday night quoted Guillen announcing he was Florida bound. The blog was taken down a short time later and replaced by a post that discussed Guillen’s departure from the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5lYnV5bWFya2V0LmNvbS9qZXJzZXlzLW1sYi1qZXJzZXlzLWMtNjVfOTcuaHRtbA__" target="_blank">Chicago White Sox</a>, while making no mention of the Marlins.<br />On Tuesday afternoon Guillen tweeted: “Weird to be in miami in this time but very happy ready to go”.<br /><br />That sounded fine to Marlins players.<br /><br />“This should be a good thing, ” catcher John Buck said. “It’s a step forward. It’s a commitment by the team showing we want to win. Part of that is getting a manager who has proven that. ”<br /><br />Guillen’s briefly posted blog item said he had hoped to spend his entire managerial career with the White Sox, where he won a World Series title in 2005.<br /><br />“But there comes a point when you need to move on, and that point has come, ” he was quoted as saying. “The Florida Marlins believe I am the right man for the job to bring another World Series to South Florida. …<br /><br />“I can’t tell you how thrilled I am to be a part of the Marlins organization. I have an unbelievable amount of respect for the Marlins, owner Jeffrey Loria, president Larry Beinfest, and general manager Michael Hill. I can’t thank them enough for this opportunity and look forward to the future. I can’t wait to get started! ”<br /><br />Florida manager Jack McKeon said Monday he planned to retire at the end of the season. Guillen announced his departure with the White Sox hours later, but said nothing about taking another job. Florida officials declined to comment.<br /><br />The Marlins, who move into a new ballpark next spring, plan a big ceremony in conjunction with the final game at their current stadium Wednesday. There’s speculation they want to cap the occasion by introducing Guillen as manager, or they may do it at the new ballpark Thursday.<br /><br />“All the pieces are coming together, ” slugger Mike Stanton said. “We got the stadium, and we got the manager. ”<br /><br />Guillen had a year left on his contract, and White Sox general manager <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5lYnV5bWFya2V0LmNvbS9qZXJzZXlzLWMtNjUuaHRtbA__" target="_blank">Ken Williams </a>confirmed Tuesday that the club had an agreement with another team for compensation for the manager. But he did not identify the players involved and declined to say the Marlins were the other team.<br /><br />“It isn’t a secret, ” he said. “Out of respect for the desires for that particular organization, they did not want to be named so i am simply honoring that request. ”<br /><br />He also offered a diplomatic approach when asked if the Marlins were guilty of tampering in their courtship of Guillen.<br /><br />“Listen, some things in this game you have to live in the gray area on, ” Williams said, “and that will just have to be one of them. ”<br /><br />The buzz began more than a year ago that Guillen might be reunited with Loria in Miami, where he was McKeon’s third base coach with the 2003 World Series champions.<br /><br />Guillen became the White Sox manager that November, and in eight season he had a record of 678-617. It was a sometimes stormy tenure, and when his recent quest for a contract extension was denied, he received permission to be released from his current deal.<br /><br />The Marlins are staggering to a last-place finish in the NL East. With the team moving to a new home and making a push to become a contender, Loria has said he wants an experienced manager.<br /><br />The outspoken, sometimes outrageous Guillen would be the Marlins’ fourth manager since early 2010, and his relationship with management could create some off-the-field excitement. Strong-willed Joe Girardi lasted only one season with Florida in 2006, clashed with Loria and others in the organization, and was fired shortly before being chosen NL manager of the year.<br /><br />Several Marlins players said the tell-it-like-it-is skipper would be a good fit for the team.<br /><br />“That’s probably something we need around here, ” Stanton said. “Let us know, and don’t beat around the bush. It’s better than doing it behind your back. He’s going to come right to you. ”<br /><br />Left fielder and Twitter sensation Logan Morrison was impressed to hear Guillen blogs along with tweeting, and does so in two languages.<br /><br />“Now I need a blog, probably two, ” Morrison said. “And I’ve got to learn a foreign language in the offseason. I’ll have to follow him. If i don’t, I might get fined. ”<br /><br />AP Sports Writer Rick Gano in Chicago contributed to this report.

He doesn’t mind this dance, because it benefits him just like it does them. From Turkey to Italy, the suitors for the globe’s most popular player have gone to incredible lengths to make sure they never cut a deal with Bryant.<br /><br />Nothing will get done so publicly with him. It never does. Of course, this is the perfect dance for a superstar selling shoes overseas, a regenerating news cycle about how Bryant’s considering an offer to come play in a town near you. Bryant gets a push on his Nike tour of Europe, and the owners and general managers of Italy’s Bologna Virtus and Turkey’s Besiktas get the publicity of the courtship, the credibility of Bryant’s willingness to listen.<br />Before the Chinese Basketball Association banned the use of NBA players under contract, Bryant had gone deep into talks with teams, including outlining private travel perks and a $2 million-plus monthly salary that he would’ve wanted to play there. Those talks stayed quieter because of the private nature of Chinese organizations. Yet as Bryant traveled Asia peddling product, those fans believed maybe they could get him, too.<br /><br />Yes, these overseas offers are using <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uaWtla2luLmNvbS9uaWtlLWFjZy1zaG9lcy1jLTE0Mi5odG1sPw__" target="_blank">Bryant</a>, and Bryant’s using them. This week, he pitches his shoes on a European tour that makes stops in Rome and Istanbul reach even more feverish pitches. This isn’t so much a grand strategy out of Bryant as it’s a convenient byproduct of circumstance.<br /><br />The GM of Virtus Bologna is publicly calling for Bryant to return to his teenage roots, leaking his offers of $5 million per season or $700, 000 per game. If Virtus Bologna thinks that telling the world that Bryant is asking for an outrageous $15 million contract for the season is the way to lure him, well, they’re probably more interested in the spectacle than the signing.<br /><br />[Related: Italian team offers Kobe Bryant $5 million for season]<br /><br />Bryant has been more than intrigued with playing overseas because he knows that it could be a boon to his international branding. He loves to play, loves to make money, and that’s why he’ll probably accept one of these offers if the NBA season gets canceled.<br /><br />There were reasons sentimental and business-wise for Bryant to take deals in Italy (his childhood home), Turkey (his endorsement deal with Turkish Air) and China (the shoe market), and that makes the storylines intriguing. For the NBA Players Association, the bidding on Bryant has been beneficial. It reminds owners of the NBA’s star power, its global reach. It does so much more than superstars reducing themselves to a series of public shirts-and-skins pick-up games in college gyms.<br /><br />Bryant is older, 33 years now, and he doesn’t run around with his rivals playing pick-up games. Most of the NBA’s thirtysomething stars have shown little inclination to do that this summer, mostly leaving it to the next generation of players who are still chasing rings. Bryant has his old trainer, Tim Grover, traveling a lot with him this summer, preferring to grind it out in private. After a procedure in Germany in June, Bryant’s troublesome knee has made excellent progress, but nothing is ever truly known until the pounding of the season returns.<br /><br />For now, Bryant keeps listening to the overtures and listening closely to his teammate, Derek Fisher, from the labor meetings. The fact Bryant hasn’t signed a deal overseas suggests he believes there’s still real hope for a shortened NBA season - that it isn’t worth starting something that he can’t finish there.<br /><br />For now, those Euro teams will keep making big noise as they court Bryant, and that works out for him, too. All across the world, they think, just maybe we have a shot to sign Kobe. And in the end, that does something there that this numbing labor stoppage hasn’t done here: Keep fans engaged, keep the NBA’s most important stars still bigger than ever.

I’ve never even thought about wearing a visor before. We’ll take it game by game, but I’m not worried about it either way. ”<br /><br />He’s also not concerned about the cosmetic ramifications of the injury, even after appearing on the cover of the September issue of GQ. The magazine included several photos of the bare-chested quarterback, who was razzed by his teammates and other players around the league.<br /><br />“I mean, if it’s a cosmetic thing, I don’t really care, ” Sanchez said. “I’ll break my nose every game as long as we’re going to win. I don’t care about that. It’s not a big deal. ”<br /><br />Sanchez also stood up for his coach after Hall of Fame quarterback Joe Namath suggested during a radio interview that Rex Ryan is making his team overconfident, which helped lead to its loss Sunday at Oakland. Ryan said Monday that he wouldn’t change who is because of Namath’s opinion, and added that the former Jets star “doesn’t know our team. He’s on the outside. ”<br /><br />“I respect Joe Namath to the fullest, ” Sanchez said. “He’s the most notable Jet of all time, the ultimate Jet, and I can understand why he would criticize the team like that, and I kind of see where he’s coming from as an outsider’s perspective. But you’ve got to understand that in this building, these guys prepare their tails off. ”<br /><br />Sanchez acknowledged some mistakes he made in the Jets’ 34-24 loss, including a costly interception after Jeremy Kerley had a long punt return that put New york deep in Oakland territory.<br /><br />“It wasn’t a matter of preparation, ” he said of the defeat.<br /><br />And as far as Ryan’s brash attitude, Sanchez added: “We wouldn’t have it any other way, and that’s the way it is. ”<br /><br />Sanchez also brushed off comments former Jets linebacker <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5lYnV5bWFya2V0LmNvbS90aW1iZXJsYW5kLWMtMjMzLmh0bWw_" target="_blank">Jason Taylor </a>made to a Miami television station that he thinks Dolphins quarterback Chad Henne has more talent than his former New york teammate.<br /><br />“He’s one of the best teammates I’ve ever had, ” Sanchez said of Taylor, who spent last season with the Jets. “He’s saying the right thing. That’s his teammate and that’s his quarterback. ”

The Timberwolves are enduring a 1-4 stretch since losing rookie point guard  Ricky Rubio for the season to knee surgery.<br />Sunday’s 115-99 loss at Sacramento dropped Minnesota to 1-3 on this seven-game trip and featured a brief shouting match on the bench late in the game between Timberwolves star  Kevin Love and reserve guard Jose Barea.<br /><br />“It’s frustrating, but nothing personal against JJ, ” Love said. “I think we were both frustrated and took it out on each other when we should have took it out on the other  team. So both of us made mistakes and both of us feel bad. ”<br /><br />The Timberwolves committed 21 turnovers that led to 32 points for the last-place Kings.<br /><br />“Everything we started off at the beginning of the season trying to avoid we did tonight, ” coach Rick Adelman said. “I don’t know how many second-chance points they had,  but they continued to beat us to the rim. Their season has been tough and we talked about that before the game. If you let them get going in their own building they will be  tough. ”<br /><br />Love had 21 points and 11 boards for his league-leading 38th double-double and third in a row. He didn’t get much help from Darko Milicic, who had two points and no rebounds in  just six first-quarter minutes before Adelman benched the Serbian big man the rest of the way.<br /><br />The coach started Milicic at center in place of Nikola Pekovic, who is bothered by a sore left ankle. Pekovic averaged 22. 0 points on 55. 4 percent shooting and an average of  10. 6 rebounds over Minnesota’s previous five games.<br /><br />While Golden State (18-24) has traditionally been a tough matchup for Minnesota, it could be different after the Warriors dealt leading scorer Monta Ellis to Milwaukee on  Wednesday. Ellis averaged 22. 3 points against the Wolves over the previous two seasons.<br /><br />The new-look Warriors have lost three straight, falling 99-92 in overtime at Utah on Saturday. They allowed a tying three-point play by the Jazz’s Derrick Favors late in  regulation.<br /><br />“The frustrating thing is that we had the opportunity to close out the game. We needed one stop and we couldn’t get it done. It’s disappointing, ” coach Mark Jackson said.<br /><br />Richard Jefferson had nine points on 2-of-14 shooting in his Warriors debut after being acquired Thursday from San Antonio.<br /><br />“There were some shots that i could have knocked down, but you win as a team and you lose as a team, ” Jefferson said.<br /><br />Golden State could again be without Stephen Curry, who did not dress for the fourth straight game because of a sprained right ankle that has plagued him all season. Curry  averages 14. 7 points and 5. 3 assists.<br /><br />Rleated:Minnesota Timberwolves,Golden State Warriors,Ricky Rubio,Darko Milicic,Richard Jefferson

Though he couldn't finish like he normally does on his quick, furious drives to the basket, his unparalleled explosiveness was back.<br />''Every day is getting better,'' he said. ''I'm not trying to do too much out there, just trying to play with the team, trying not to get reinjured. That's the biggest thing, and making sure I'm playing with a lot of confidence.''<br />Rose, who had seven assists and just one turnover in 27 minutes, had 11 points and eight assists on Saturday in a win over Dallas after missing the previous three games.<br />''I think he's getting a lot more comfortable,'' Chicago coach Tom Thibodeau said. ''His body is feeling a lot better and he needs to play. He needs to play in games. He'll get up to speed very quickly.''<br />Kyle Korver scored 20 points, Carlos Boozer had 16 points and Joakim Noah had 14 points and 14 rebounds for Chicago. The Bulls ended the game needing just a win over Cleveland on Thursday or a loss by the San Antonio Spurs to clinch the top overall seed in the playoffs.<br />The Bulls said earning the top seed is a secondary goal.<br />''We're just trying to do what we can do as a team,'' Noah said. ''We're just playing for ourselves. We just want to be playing well for when it really counts.''<br />Lance Stephenson had a career-high 22 points in his first career start for the Pacers, who rested Danny Granger and Leandro Barbosa because they were locked into the No. 3 spot in the Eastern Conference. Indiana will have homecourt advantage against Orlando in the first round.<br />''Our last two games, the primary goal was to sharpen up for Game 1 of the playoffs,'' Indiana coach Frank Vogel said. ''Our starters got some good reps tonight and so did our bench. We accomplished the goal of getting a good look at Lance Stephenson.''<br />Chicago led 49-36 at halftime after shooting 50 percent from the field and outrebounding the Pacers 25-16. The Pacers shot just 5 for 21 from the field in the second quarter and were outscored 17-12.<br />Indiana went on a 7-0 run early in the third quarter to cut Chicago's lead to 55-47 and force a timeout.<br />The Bulls hung tough, and a fast break layup by Richard Hamilton pushed their lead back to 67-54. Chicago led 67-59 at the end of the third quarter.<br />A dunk by Taj Gibson increased Chicago's lead to 73-60.<br />Indiana made one more push. A fast break layup by Stephenson cut the Bulls' lead to 78-71 with 5:57 to play, but Chicago maintained control.<br />Thibodeau said the Bulls will play their regular lineup on Thursday.<br />''It will be about the same,'' he said. ''We'll see where we are. I want our starters to get more time together, so it will be similar to tonight. We'll see how the game unfolds. I just want us to continue to take it step by step.''<br />Thibodeau said the Bulls need the game against Cleveland to get sharper.<br />''There's always things you can do better and we need to work on, but we're getting there,'' he said. ''Our starters haven't played a lot together all year so it was a good opportunity for them to get some quality time on the floor. I thought that was good for us.''<br />Rose wants one more chance to prepare for a pressure situation before the postseason begins.<br />''If the game was in a crazy type of game and at the end I need to take over, that's what I'm going to try to do,'' he said.<br />Notes: Indiana shot 50 percent in the first quarter, but trailed 32-24 at the end of the period. Chicago outrebounded Indiana 12-6 in the first quarter. ... The teams combined for just one turnover in the first 12 minutes. ... The Pacers honored their ABA championship teams from 1969-70, 1971-72 and 1972-73 at halftime. All surviving members of those teams were invited. ... Indiana had just its sixth sellout crowd of the season.
