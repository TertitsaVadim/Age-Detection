The Nike Dunk High Pro SB – Skate or Die (Black / Neon Yellow) derives its inspiration and colors from the 1987 Skate or Die video game artwork. The game featured two ramp events,  the freestyle ramp and the high jump, two downhill events,  the downhill race (in a park setting) and the downhill jam (in a street setting),  and the pool joust.
<br />The color listed on the tag is Black / Neon Yellow. It does come with 2 pairs of laces, the blue and neon yellow. Nike Dunk Skate or Die Edition is part of the  Nike  Dunk SB Spring 2008 lineup. They are modeled after the 87’s or 88’s video game Skate Or Die as you can see from the picture. The colors and confetti patterns are on the back and sides. Nike Kids Skate or Die Edition was one of the most desired SB’s of 2008.

The colorway itself might seem familiar, as it was seen on a Nike Air Max 90 from 2006 that was unfortunately overshadowed by the re-release of the Infrared Air Max 90.
<br /><br />From wild and crazy to elegant and subtle, the Nike Dunk works in so many ways. For us personally it’s more so the subtle and simple designs which get us going and help us complete the perfect fit, which is exactly what this two-tone Nike Dunk High looks to do. Full grain leather and pebbled leather in pure White construct the entire upper while the White Electric Green Nike Swoosh is fabricated from patent leather. Further use of Electric Green is used on the nylon tongue and on the midsole stitching. Looking somewhat out of place in my opinion is a pair of  White Electric Green Blue laces, which as you know can easily be swapped for a color of your choice.

Boasting six different colors, not even counting the white and grey, this Nike multicolored Red Pink Gold will be sure to draw attention wherever they go. Rave pink, varsity red, bright yellow, aqua and grass green each command a different section of the the leather upper, but its the metallic orange heel panel that really makes this shoe stand out with a beautiful shimmer that falls somewhere between gold and copper. Granted, the outrageous appearance of this Dunk multicolored Red Pink Gold is distracting, but don’t overlook the fact that this Dunk Red Pink Gold model features a Zoom sole and is built for maximum comfort.

Accents come by way of some Blue mesh on the tongue and around the ankle and splashes of White on the toe box, tongue, heel tab and midsole. Like the Dark Chocolate/Metallic Silver pair seen yesterday, these will also be without padding in the tongue, but a nice color scheme and combination of materials should be more than enough for many Nike SB fans.

In addition to their collection, check out this new Nike Dunk Red Blue that comes in a Red, Royal Bue and White colorway.

The news first hit the web about the <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5kdW5rLXNob3AuY29tL25pa2UtZHVuay1oaWdoLXNiLWhlYXZlbi1nYXRlLXNhbXBsZS1wLTY4OC5odG1s" target="_blank">Heaven Gate Nike Dunk</a></strong> in December 2007 after we posted our exclusive interview with Todd Jordan. Mr. Jordan told us about the HG <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5kdW5rLXNob3AuY29t" target="_blank">Nike Dunks</a></strong> in the interview, but he said too much. At the time we had no idea Todd was talking about the religious cult “Heaven’s Gate” that was led by Marshall Applewhite and Bonnie Nettles. The cult resulted in 38 dead bodies that was found in a mansion in San Diego, CA on March 26, 1997.
<br /><br />The controversy surrounding the “Heaven’s Gate” <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5kdW5rLXNob3AuY29tL2N1c3RvbS1uaWtlLWR1bmstc2hvZXMtYy05Lmh0bWw/cGFnZT0zJmFtcDtzb3J0PTIwYQ__" target="_blank">Custom Nike Dunk</a></strong> High SB has forced Nike to scrap the Dunk Highs which were scheduled to be this Fall.

However, the black, purple, blue and white Dunk High SB will not be dropped and have popped up on the ‘bay!.

<br />For the first time in the lifespan of Triumvir, Brian and I were given a chance and a concept by an outside source (Nike) to design a shoe. The inspiration and concept of the shoe was based on “a Beijing native’s perspective of their own city, with the slogan skate towards Tienanmen Square.” The <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5kdW5rLXNob3AuY29tL25pa2Utc2ItZHVuay1taWQtYy04Lmh0bWw/emVuaWQ9ZHM0a3Q1MHMxbjdzb2pxc2o1bm01NTAxbDE_" target="_blank">Nike SB Dunk Mid</a></strong> is going to be a special edition for fly’s Beijing shop and the first <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5kdW5rLXNob3AuY29t" target="_blank">Nike Shoe</a></strong> ever to be named after China’s great northern metropolis, “Beijing.” We were asked to incorporate the following categories of what Beijing is known for into the design of the shoe: dust, traffic, highways, noodles, Tienanmen Square, and the capital of China. Below are a few pictures of the design phase that we sent to Nike and the actual <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5kdW5rLXNob3AuY29tL25pa2Utc2ItZHVuay1taWQtYmVpamluZy10cml1bXZpci14LWZseS1wLTQwOS5odG1s" target="_blank">Nike SB Dunk Mid Beijing - Triumvir x Fly</a></strong> shoes we received.
<br /><br />This was one of the drafts Brian and I came up with during our two days of lockup. Many drafts didn’t make it… I’ll probably show a few of those drafts later on - maybe. As you can see by the pictures, we had to represent every element given to us for the design of the shoe. The toughest part was to fuse the highway and noodle concept into the shoe.
<br /><br />This was the final draft of the <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5kdW5rLXNob3AuY29tL25pa2Utc2ItZHVuay1taWQtYmVpamluZy10cml1bXZpci14LWZseS1wLTQwOS5odG1s" target="_blank">Beijing Dunk Mid</a></strong> that was approved by Nike. As for the highway and noodle concept we decided to use a cad style design. The pattern on the heel and lace panel is an aerial view of the Beijing highway and since noodles are messy and intertwined, we went ahead with a repeated pattern to represent the effect. It’s funny that I used to use the same template to design my customs…
<br /><br />The <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5kdW5rLXNob3AuY29tL25pa2Utc2ItZHVuay1taWQtYmVpamluZy10cml1bXZpci14LWZseS1wLTQwOS5odG1s" target="_blank">Beijing Nike Dunks Mid</a></strong> was chosen to represent Beijing because Jeff loves to skate in Dunk Mids. We suggested using premium tumbled leather for the black panels. The gray tones were used to symbolize the colors of the city’s high-rises and highways.
<br /><br />On our first rough draft we included the allergy mask concept that is commonly worn by the Beijing people during its sandstorm seasons. We chose to use white on the front toe panel and on the laces to illustrate the allergy mask.
<br /><br />Beijing has a rich history and has been the capital of China for many centuries now, so to find a balance between it’s past and present we used red and gold on the shoe. Red and gold symbolize fortune and prosperity in Chinese culture; the colors also reflect that of the Chinese flag.
<br /><br />We needed to fuse the slogan “skate towards Tienanmen square” into the shoe. So we went with a traditional Chinese seal used to prove identity on documents, contracts, art; these seals were also used by imperial families of the past. The Chinese characters we used in this stamp are a more archaic form of the Chinese characters we see in the present day.

<br /><br />We finally have a good look at the <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5kdW5rLXNob3AuY29tL25pa2UtZHVuay1zYi1taWQtcHJlbWl1bS10di1jYXBwdWNjaW5vLXNpbHZlci1wLTQwMC5odG1s" target="_blank">Nike SB Dunk Mid Premium - TV</a></strong>. They are inspired by the television set, with the most noticeable feature of this inspiration seen on the insole, which is decorated with pixel boxes and and colorful designs. They feature a cappuccino / silver upper constructed from suede along with textured material on the side panels and toe box.
<br /><br />You might not immediately realize it by looking at them, but a look at the insole reveals that these <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5kdW5rLXNob3AuY29t" target="_blank">Nike Dunks</a></strong> are inspired by the almighty boob tube. The insole is decorated with pixel boxes and the rainbow striped no-signal bars that appeared on old television sets. The outer part of the shoe looks pretty basic, with a suede cappuccino/silver upper accented by a textured material on the side panel and toebox and a silver Swoosh.
<br /><br />At the end of 2008, this <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5kdW5rLXNob3AuY29tL25pa2Utc2ItZHVuay1taWQtYy04Lmh0bWw/emVuaWQ9ZHM0a3Q1MHMxbjdzb2pxc2o1bm01NTAxbDE_" target="_blank">Nike SB Dunk Mid</a></strong> Premium appeared with reports claiming that it inspired by TVs. At first glance it is hard to find the connection between this <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5kdW5rLXNob3AuY29tL25pa2UtZHVuay1zYi1taWQtcHJlbWl1bS10di1jYXBwdWNjaW5vLXNpbHZlci1wLTQwMC5odG1s" target="_blank">Nike TV Dunk SB</a></strong> and the cappuccino and silver color scheme with a television, but it isn’t until you see insole which bares graphics of pixels. Aside from the combination of cappuccino and a more grey than silver palette, this <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5kdW5rLXNob3AuY29tL25pa2UtZHVuay1zYi1taWQtcHJlbWl1bS10di1jYXBwdWNjaW5vLXNpbHZlci1wLTQwMC5odG1s" target="_blank">Nike Dunks TV</a></strong> also consists of griptape-like material on the toe box and side panel as well as premium materials including suede and leather. No word on when these will be available stateside, but they have dropped overseas.

<br /><br />We just got a look at the “aqua fuel” colorway of the <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5kdW5rLXNob3AuY29tL25pa2Utc2ItZHVua3MtbWlkLWFxdWEtYmx1ZS1wLTM5My5odG1s" target="_blank">Nike SB Dunks Mid Aqua Blue</a></strong>, which wasn’ t the best colorway.

This colorway of the nike sb aqua fuel will certainly turn some heads during the hot summer days. The sneakers base is made of cool aqua fuel leather, while black appears on the underlay and shoes lace, which features a cool and unique design. Aqua fuel is seen on the contrast stitching, outsole, ankle strap, tip and the nike swoosh. The sneaker also features a cool black midsole. What do you think?
<br /><br />Do you know something about the <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5kdW5rLXNob3AuY29tL25pa2Utc2ItZHVuay1taWQtYy04Lmh0bWw/emVuaWQ9ZHM0a3Q1MHMxbjdzb2pxc2o1bm01NTAxbDE_" target="_blank">Nike SB Dunk Mid</a></strong>? Okay let me tell you some interesting story about this shoe. In 2004, the kick coming out for the first time, but because of its strange colorway and the odd shape make public do not quite acceptable. Several years later, it came back again as the member of <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5kdW5rLXNob3AuY29t" target="_blank">Nike Dunks</a></strong> SB packup.

The shoes feature with better ankle support and partner the higher rise with the strap, so it surely can keep you lively if you hold one pair.
