Pin the Crown on the Princess, Pin the Eye Patch on the Pirate or X Marks the Spot are other fun ideas. Pin the Hat on the Cowboy or the Eye on Muno for a Yo Gabba Gabba party are just a few ways to turn this fun, fun party game into the perfect game for any them party. You all know how to play Pin the Tail on the Donkey...right? Each child gets a tail with two sided tape on it. You blind fold the player who is up, turn them around a couple times and then point them in the direction of the Donkey. They must try to stick the tail closest to where it belongs. The one who does get the tail close to where it belongs gets a prize...of course, you can give everyone a prize for playing. Stickers or temporary tattoos make great prizes for this kind of game...kids love them and they are about the cheapest party game prizes you are going to find.<br /><br />The Pinata game is fun too. Pinatas are a traditional Mexican game. A pinata is really a breakable container for party prizes and candies. The goal of this fun party game is to break the pinata and gather all the goodies hidden inside. These pinatas come in every theme imaginable so all you have to do is pick one that matches your theme and fill it with good stuff the kids will like. Stickers, temporary tattoos, candies and small game prizes work perfectly as filling. I like the pull string pinatas. This is a game that has strings the kids can pull. One of these strings rips the body of the pinata so the goodies fall out. Then everyone tries to gather all the goodies they can. You can buy a pull sting model or you can buy a pull string conversion kit to make this kids party game very safe. To play you hang your pinata up and blind fold each child as they take a turn pulling a string. You can put the blind fold on, and like with Pin the Tail on the Donkey, spin each child and head them off in the direction of the hanging pinata. Tell them about how many steps they need to take and send them off.<br /><br />No Pirate Birthday Party would be complete without some great Pirate Party Games. There are plenty of ready made options from party supply outlets, but sometimes it's more fun to make your own.<br />&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;<br />&lt;br&gt;One excellent Pirate party Game is called &lt;b&gt;X Marks The Spot&lt;/b&gt; and it is really easy to put together. Simply get a large flip chart sized piece of paper and draw a Treasure Map onto it. make it as detailed as you wish, but make sure that you&amp;nbsp;draw a Treasure Chest somewhere on the map.&amp;nbsp; Blindfold your party guests, one at a time, using a bandanna, and spin them around&amp;nbsp;four or five times. Move them toward the Treasure Map and&amp;nbsp;get them to mark an X, using a marker pen, &amp;nbsp;where they think the treasure chest is.

When throwing your pirate themed party make sure to send out invitations to everyone telling them that this is a costume party, although if you forget you can probably count on a few people coming dressed up on their own.<br /><br />You can easily provide food and drink fitting for a pirate party.  The pirates loved their beer!  Food should be rich and hearty.  Lots of meats and cheeses.  Perhaps you can set up a cold cuts buffet and let everyone make their own sandwiches for the event.   Make sure you have plenty of cut bread as these pirate guests of yours will certainly have appetites to match their garb.  Order extra of everything.<br /><br />Pirate themed decorations are only suiting to the event.  You can hang up red and black streamers, a skull and crossbones and give out eye patches and plastic hooks as party favors to the guests who happen to arrive without their pirate garb.<br /><br />Entertainment can be lots of pirate movies and if you don't feel like watching a movie try playing a CD of the movie soundtrack from the recent pirate movie, Curse of the Black Pearl.<br /><br />Pirates liked their gold too so you can set up a few poker and blackjack games to entertain the guests. If you want to keep the party civil then use chocolate foil covered coins instead of real money in your betting.  That way the winners still get a special treat and no one is throwing punches over lost money.<br /><br />See if you can start up a few rounds of classic sea shanties with the guests and get a real sing-a-round going at the party.  If not, don't worry, just go back to your good food, entertainment and poker game!<br /><br />Party Games for girls are fun so make sure you plan a lot of them. Young girls always enjoy playing especially at a birthday celebration. Match the play to your party theme and make your party planning easier than ever.<br /><br />What is your party theme? If it is a Princess party plan on some fun with a royal twist. Pin the Tiara on the Princess, Find the Kings Ransom, Royal Ball Freeze Dance are only a few of the princess theme fun ideas you can use to entertain your young guests. Dress Up is another fun ideas to use at your Princess celebration.<br /><br />Is Pink Skull Pirates your theme? Girly games are really fun for a pirate party. Find the Royal Treasure and of course, since it is a pirate theme, X marks the spot. Treasure Hunts are fun no matter what you call them. Get some lady buccaneer clothing, two of each article, and have a Pirate Dress Up Relay Race. A manicure really isn't a party game, but the girls at a Pink Skull Pirate party will enjoy it anyway.<br /><br />A Ladybug party theme has some really cute party supplies to match. You can have simple fun like Pin the Spots on the Ladybug or you can get a Ladybug pinata...a pull string model for the girls to play. Play musical party fun like Musical Ladybugs. Get some red pieces of paper and mark each with some black spots. Stick these papers on the floor, one less piece of paper than there are players and start the music. Each round as one contestant is eliminated take away one more piece of paper.

Decorate your deck with balloons, pirate cutouts, and a treasure chest pinata. Set around real or fake plants to resemble a jungle. Some fun props could be plastic swords and toy parrots.<br /><br />2. If you have a pool, this is the perfect place for fun activities. Decorate pool floats as small pirate ships.<br /><br />3. A tree house is also the perfect outside pirate party setting. Imagine the possibilities! You can make a fun Pirate Hide-a-Way.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;Room Decorating Tips&lt;/b&gt;<br />&lt;br&gt;Decorate with lots of balloons, pirate cutouts, and Pirates of the Caribbean movie posters. The posters can be framed and used as a gift and/or to decorate your child's room.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;Table Decorating Tips&lt;/b&gt;<br />&lt;br&gt;Themed paper goods (plates, napkins, cups, tablecover) are an easy way to decorate your party table. Toss some plastic gold coins around on the table. Tie balloons to the chairs. Your Pirates of the Caribbean birthday cake can be your centerpiece. No need to spend a lot of money.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;Party Activities and Games&lt;/b&gt;<br />&lt;br&gt;A pirate theme party can have fun activities. Here are a few ideas:<br /><br />1, Dress up and pretend play. Just let the kids use their own imagination!<br /><br />2. Swab the Deck Race: Supply some mops and balloons. The object is to see which team can mop up the most balloons.<br /><br />3. Pirate Ship Contest: Provide floats (if this is a pool party) or several cardboard ships, and have teams decorate their pirate ship. Be sure to have prizes for everyone, using different categories. If these are older kids, you could even have the teams make their own ship.<br /><br />4. Pin the Eye Patch on the Pirate: you can find this game at local party stores or Amazon.com<br /><br />5. Movie Marathon: Show all of the Pirates of Caribbean movies. Serve popcorn and candy, just like at the movies.<br /><br />6. Treasure Hunt: Use a treasure chest pinata or toy chest. Hide the chest and give guest (as a group) a treasure map with clues to find the chest (X marks the spot!). After discovering the chest, guest can then break It open for the treasure!<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;Party Food Suggestions&lt;/b&gt;<br />&lt;br&gt;What do pirates like to eat? Fish &amp; Chips, of course! If you're having the party outside, a cookout would be ideal. Grilled chicken kabobs (swords) would be fun, or anything you like on a grill. Other ideas would be sub sandwiches, hot wings, chips, fruit tray, and goldfish crackers.<br /><br />I saw a really cute idea recently. &lt;b&gt;Skull and Crossbones cookie cutters!&lt;/b&gt; If you have the time to make cookies, these would be a hit at your party. I saw these on Amazon.com.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;The Birthday Cake&lt;/b&gt;<br />&lt;br&gt;If you would like to make your own cake, there are several pirate theme cake toppers available, including Pirates of the Caribbean since this is a recent movie. There are also pirate ship cake toppers and cake molds. You can usually purchase these in craft stores or grocery stores. If you don't want to make your own, you can order a pre-made birthday cake at your local bakery or grocery.
