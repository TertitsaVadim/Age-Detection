<br /><br />No mere look-alikes, the stainless-steel daggers from the movie's grisly killer were as good as gold at auction and a new TV series on the hunt for Hollywood keepsakes.
<br /><br />&quot;Wow, these are really cool!&quot; said appraiser Joe Maddalena, owner of Profiles in History of Calabasas, as the cameras rolled for the premier of &quot;Hunting Hollywood.&quot; &quot;Those are phenomenal.
<br /><br />&quot;They're worth a fortune.&quot;
<br /><br />Residents from across Los Angeles queued up inside the Hollywood &amp; Highland Center after answering a casting call to have their movie and TV treasures appraised for a national television audience.
<br /><br />There were props rescued from studio Dumpsters. Scripts procured from studio producers. And signed head shots from nearly every Hollywood studio.
<br /><br />There were early Charlie Chaplin film reels. A Hollywood shoe last for Madonna. A script from &quot;The Brady Bunch.&quot; A baseball lamp from &quot;Arrested Development.&quot; And an NBC chair like the one that had supported Elvis for the &quot;NBC Elvis Comeback Special.&quot;
<br /><br />There were even wooden walls from a Palm Springs Prohibition-era speakeasy, signed by 212 stars from Humphrey Bogart to Clara Bow.
<br /><br />The trove of Hollywood memorabilia dredged from the garage to the attic after a century of movie production represented part of the hidden wealth of Los Angeles.

<br /><br />The &quot;Hunting Hollywood&quot; reality series, produced by Shevick*Zupon Entertainment for Syfy - formerly the Sci Fi Channel and a network of NBC Universal - is scheduled to air Nov. 4.
<br /><br />Similar to the popular &quot;Antiques Roadshow&quot; of PBS, it seeks to locate - and value - some of the lost treasures of Tinseltown, from costumes to production art.
<br /><br />The series follows Maddalena, the world's largest auctioneer of original movie, television and pop culture collectibles, as he sniffs out show biz memorabilia across the globe.
<br /><br />A Bela Lugosi tailcoat from &quot;White Zombie&quot; locked away in a trunk for 70 years just fetched $100,000 at auction. A first-season &quot;I Dream of Jeannie&quot; bottle just sold for $42,500.
<br /><br />Where, the producers of &quot;Hunting Hollywood&quot; asked, were such movie icons as the flying car from &quot;Chitty Chitty Bang Bang,&quot; the carpet bag wielded by Mary Poppins, or the or the ruby slippers tapped in &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;?
<br /><br />&quot;A three-year hunt for the Wicked Witch of the West hat, I think will happen during the show,&quot; said Steve Longo, executive producer for the series. &quot;This is the crown jewel.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;There are millions and millions of dollars worth of memorabilia yet to be unearthed,&quot; Maddalena added during the appraisal clinic under soaring Hollywood &amp; Highland elephants. &quot;I think the San Fernando Valley is a gold mine.&quot;
<br /><br />Carrie Gordon had three decades of Hollywood collectible packed into drawers, under the bed and the back rooms of her Santa Clarita home.
<br /><br />On Sunday, the artist carried two satchels of Grammy Awards goodies hoping to sell them at a later auction.
<br /><br />&quot;I just grabbed whatever I could find,&quot; said Gordon, 53. &quot;I'm a collector who wants to cash in.&quot;
<br /><br />Jim Welch, of Van Nuys, submitted a sepia photo of his grandfather, Elmer Hagg, working on the 1931 film set of &quot;Frankenstein.&quot;
<br /><br />Ted Nichelson, of Hollywood, submitted bound scripts from &quot;The Brady Bunch Variety Hour,&quot; one valued at $1,000.
<br /><br />Hollywood resident Richard Cray submitted the early Chaplin short, plus wooden shoe lasts by Pasquale Di Fabrizio, shoemaker for the stars. The Madonna last could fetch between $800 and $1,200, according to Maddalena.

According to tourist agencies in Tongling city, primary and middle school children as well as their parents make up the majority of tourists during summer vacation.
<br /><br />Among different summer vacation options, the Shanghai Expo trip, water route trip and famous schools trip are the most popular ones. Although the Shanghai Expo has caused the accommodation and transportation fees in Shanghai and its surrounding areas to increase, many students still chose Shanghai as their vacation destination.
<br /><br />Many parents also volunteered to accompany their children in summer camps and water route trips. According to the employees of Kangda International Travel Agency, water route trips are highly acclaimed by tourists in the summer. Most of those trips include famous scenic spots, such as Jiuhua and Huangshan mountain scenic areas. Due to the inexpensive cost and short journey, many parents are willing to take a water route trip with children on the weekend.
<br /><br />Summer camp offers students a great chance to learn things while having fun. Many travel agencies in Tongling advertise summer camps with different themes, such as famous schools trip and a do-it-yourself summer camp. A woman surnamed Zhu, who was signing up in a travel agency for a summer camp for her son, expressed the hope that her son could embrace university atmosphere in advance and learn to be more independent while playing. The insiders also told reporters that, based on application results, summer camp fever could last until late August.

<br /><br />The Victoria Rose is Victoria Cruises’ only classic category ship.
<br /><br />The Victoria Rose will depart Chongqing on Sept. 13, Sept. 27 and Oct. 11, arriving six days later in either Nanjing or Jiangyin depending on port authority approval. The classic vessel will embark on its return journeys to Chongqing on Sept. 19, Oct. 3 and Oct. 17.
<br /><br />Victoria Cruises will provide a motorcoach transfer from Jiangyin (about 50 minutes from Shanghai) or Nanjing (a little over two hours drive from China’s largest metropolis) and the reverse.
<br /><br />These sailings will augment Victoria Cruises’ existing service between Chongqing and Shanghai on the five-star Victoria Prince.
<br /><br />“We are happy to comply with the many requests of Expo participants for extra cruise capacity to and from Shanghai,” said Larry Greenman, manager of public relations and customer service for Victoria Cruises. “It provides the perfect opportunity to expose more passengers to the less often seen, but equally stimulating sections of the Yangtze River east of Yichang.”
<br /><br />Highlights of the journey include a magnificent sailing experience through the mist-shrouded Three Gorges, exhilarating onboard activities such as Tai Chi lessons and a host of nightly entertainment options, as well as the following scenic excursions:
<br />- The massive Three Gorges Dam, the largest hydroelectric engineering project in the world.
<br />- The “Ghost City” of Fengdu at Mingshan Hill, lined with statues of spirits and demons.
<br />- A sailing experience through the impressive Small Gorges of the Daning River, one of the Yangtze’s tributaries, bringing passengers to a floating dock near Dachang, where they will disembark to board a traditional sampan for a tranquil ride through the “Mini Gorges” of the Ma Du River, a tributary of the Daning (Daning River excursion may be substituted with Shennong Stream depending on river conditions).
<br />-  Huangshan, one of China’s most outstanding scenic attractions also known as “Yellow Mountain.”
<br />- The city of Wuhan, capital of Hubei Province.
<br />- Nanjing, capital of the Jiangsu province, where cruisers will experience the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum and a Qing Dynasty-style Bazaar surrounding a Confucian Temple.

		<document id="d48602a00ef2a04bedab6723a76dbaaa" url=""><![CDATA[virtual dressing room<br/><br/>Created by metaio, a software developer based in Munich, the application lets shoppers use the Web camera on their 
<br /><br />home computer to enter a “virtual dressing room,” browse through, try on and buy clothes.
<br /><br />Penney is sponsoring the dressing room on the fashion channel of Seventeen.com, the recently redesigned Web site of 
<br /><br />the Hearst magazine for teenage girls; it also is running the dressing room on Kaboodle.com, Hearst’s social Web 
<br /><br />site for shoppers.
<br /><br />The virtual dressing room, which went live last week, is part of Penney’s continuing digital marketing campaign, 
<br /><br />said Mike Boylson, the company’s chief marketing officer.
<br /><br />“The idea of augmented reality is a completely new level of interactivity” for Penney, a popular retailer among 
<br /><br />teenage girls, Mr. Boylson said. The virtual dressing room, he added, puts the retailer on the “cutting edge,” 
<br /><br />since it allows shoppers to virtually try on clothes.
<br /><br />Although Mr. Boylson said Penney hoped the dressing room would stimulate clothing sales, “it is more about brand 
<br /><br />engagement and the sense of discovery than the number of pieces of clothing we sell off the site. We know teens love 
<br /><br />style and technology, and that they know how to navigate” applications like the virtual dressing room.
<br /><br />He also said he expected the dressing room would be visited by girls ages 12 to 17.
<br /><br />Augmented reality, a technology that combines a real image with a virtual one, has become increasingly popular among 
<br /><br />marketers who use it to get people to interact with their ads or products. Last year, for example, Papa John’s 
<br /><br />International introduced a pizza box that could be held up to a Webcam and turned into a virtual car, a replica of 
<br /><br />its founder’s 1972 Camaro, while General Electric created an augmented-reality windmill Web site after it ran a 
<br /><br />Super Bowl commercial promoting its smart grid technology. This year Adidas introduced a new line of sneakers with a 
<br /><br />code on their tongue that owners can point to a Webcam and use to play video games; the shoe acts as the game 
<br /><br />controller.

<br /><br />inaugural Greenbrier Classic, the greatest sporting event ever on West Virginia soil, making him the most 
<br /><br />economically viable high school basketball coach in the nation.
<br /><br />But when he's not negotiating million-dollar Greenbrier deals, signing PGA Tour contracts and hiring hundreds of new 
<br /><br />Greenbrier employees, he's diagramming pick-and-rolls and making fun of Parker's sunglasses.
<br /><br />&quot;He jokes around all the time except in the games,'' said Parker. &quot;He's always cracking jokes about everyone.''
<br /><br />But he teaches more than basketball, said Dugan, a senior point guard who averaged six assists and five points on 
<br /><br />last year's 16-7 team.
<br /><br />&quot;He starts out with a life lesson,'' said Dugan. &quot;He calls it storytime, and then we go into basketball.''
<br /><br />Of course, mingling with Jerry West at the Old White is old hat for the Spartan girls.
<br /><br />As a longtime friend of Justice's, West makes an occasional appearance at Greenbrier East basketball practices and, 
<br /><br />in light of his extensive basketball background, tries to pass along some hoops wisdom.
<br /><br />&quot;He's really nice,'' said Parker. &quot;He tells us we're working hard and we have the best coach in the world and he 
<br /><br />gives us pointers.''

<br /><br />For the rest of you out there, maybe you can relate to this. A few years ago, there was nothing out there better 
<br /><br />than the fantasy football draft for which you and your buddies were getting together.
<br /><br />From NFL draft kits to fantasy cheat sheets, guys and girls around the globe gear up for this event every year, and 
<br /><br />sadly, it has become even more popular than the NFL itself in certain parts of the world.
<br /><br />The fact is, I played fantasy football for roughly three years and really did enjoy it. The obvious reality that 
<br /><br />nobody wants to face is: there are more negatives than positives as far as this game goes.
<br /><br />Sure, it's fun to get together and have a draft party with your buddies and joke around and see who can come up with 
<br /><br />the most talented roster, and see who can get &quot;the steal&quot; of the draft. It's fun to play general manager and 
<br /><br />consider trades and look at who to pick up from the waivers.
<br /><br />Beyond that, there is really nothing else.
<br /><br />Even if you do have a good team, chances are the guy that doesn't have a chance toward the end of the season will 
<br /><br />end up just giving up, and some won't even bother managing their teams when the playoffs draw near.
<br /><br />Add to that with the possibility of injuries that can occur at any point during the season, and you've got a mess on 
<br /><br />your hands. The fun can easily be sucked out of the game that quickly.
<br /><br />The days of waking up on Sunday and going to get a nice brunch before the games begin at 1 p.m. are gone. Now it's 
<br /><br />all about staying up late Saturday night, trying to get the perfect lineup for the day. You don't know if someone is 
<br /><br />going to play or not, and maybe they will start but you don't know how much they will actually play.
<br /><br />Asking the &quot;experts&quot; out there if you should make this trade, or who should you start at this position? Who really 
<br /><br />cares?
<br /><br />Nobody cares about anyone else's team or league, and it irritates the hell out of me every time I turn on 
<br /><br />SportsCenter only to see them waste 10 minutes on some fantasy football garbage.
<br /><br />I want to know what the keys are to the actual football game that is going to be played. I want to see the stars 
<br /><br />shine and watch the big plays. I want to watch the game and be in the game, not checking the bottom line for all of 
<br /><br />my players' stats and the players that I am going against this week.

The trio, as undergraduates at the University of Maryland's Hinman CEOs entrepreneurship program, hatched a business idea last fall specifically geared toward small to mid-size U.S. companies, such as those in the electronics industry. They would offer a one-stop shop for companies to get their products manufactured in China.
<br /><br />Their company, Trade Assurance International (TAI), officially launched in January, after a two-week visit to the Far East as the only undergraduate competitors in the 2010 China MBA Business Plan Competition, organized by the Dingman Center for Entrepreneurship at the University of Maryland's Robert H. Smith School of Business. On their trip, Horowitz and Winter were able to firm up partnerships with key manufacturers, financiers, quality-control firms and shippers. A recent month-long trip to Hong Kong and China allowed them to further establish their rapidly expanding network of strategic alliances. Now they are building a Web platform designed to set TAI Group apart from its peers.

<br />He describes the trip as an eye-opening experience as to the potential China offers New Zealand and specifically for the Bay of Plenty.
<br />&quot;China already is a big economic force and it's only going to get bigger.&quot;
<br />This holds benefits for Bay of Plenty based industries, says Simon.
<br />&quot;Our kiwifruit are selling for high amounts. In their supermarkets the Gold ones were selling in top supermarkets for NZ$4-5 and they are being marketed at young women as prestigious and also as healthy 'super-foods'.
<br />&quot;In kiwi Gold, demand well outstrips supply so we could sell lots more up there.
<br />&quot;The kiwifruit market is going to grow there in the 10s and 10s of percentage points in the near future.
<br />&quot;That's an example of how it's working and it was really exciting to see relationships take off in the aquaculture field while I was there.
<br />&quot;So our North Island mussel processing plants here in Tauranga may get into a situation where everything it can supply, and more, can be supplied into the Chinese market.&quot;
<br />Simon says China provides great opportunity for New Zealand and he suspects it will not be long before China steps past Australia as the country's biggest trading partner.
<br />&quot;The Prime Minister met with the Premier of China the week before I was there and agreed in principle to double the countries' trade from ($NZ) 10 to 20 billion per annum by 2025.
<br />&quot;It is estimated about ($NZ) 12 billion of that will be New Zealand trade into China.&quot;
<br />Such growth and opportunity makes Simon believe he will return there on behalf of his electorate.

<br /><br />BASKETBALL
<br /><br />Hudson Valley 90, New York City 74: Travis Nichols scored a team-high 20 points, Justin Greene had 18 points, Akeem Bennett added 16 and Chaz Williams had 10 for the New York City men’s open team, which lost to Hudson Valley Thursday night at Canisius College.
<br /><br />Central 74, New York City 40: Bishop Kearney’s Sam Retas had a team-high 12 points and Brittany McDonough (Goldstein) and Simone Roberts (Lincoln) added nine points apiece for the New York City girls scholastic team, which lost its opening game of pool play Thursday afternoon at Niagara University. New York City trailed 25-20 at the half, but came out sluggish in the second. Central went on a 10-0 run out of the locker room and never looked back.
<br /><br />Hudson Valley 103, New York City 91: Monsignor McClancy’s Patrick Modzelewski had a team-high 18 points, Devaughn Reid from Rice and Enees Nikovic from Murrow scored 13 points apiece and Xavier’s Eddie Sullivan added nine for the NYC boys scholastic team, which fell to Hudson Valley in its opening game of pool play Thursday afternoon at Canisius College.
<br /><br />BASEBALL
<br /><br />Adirondack 10, New York City 0: Michael Dagostino went 2-for-3, but John Pendergast allowed just three more hits in a complete-game shutout victory for Adirondack at Erie Community College North Thursday morning.
<br /><br />Western 11, New York City 3: Michael Auriemmo went 2-for-3 with two RBIs for NYC, which fell behind 8-1 after two innings Thursday afternoon at Erie Community College North.
<br /><br />BOXING

<br /><br />And for a team that was searching to get its rotation back on track, it seemed like a less than ideal time for this kind of scheduling quirk. After all, most of the starting pitchers' woes had come on the road.
<br /><br />But on Wednesday afternoon, the Twins capped off what was a very successful road trip for both their pitching staff and their offense with a 6-4 victory over the Royals that completed the three-game series sweep and marked their fifth straight win.
<br /><br />The Twins went 6-1 on their trip to Baltimore and Kansas City, keeping themselves right on the heels of the White Sox in the American League Central race.
<br /><br />&quot;[Matt Guerrier] and I were talking and we don't remember the last time we had a road trip that we've done that well,&quot; said Twins first baseman Michael Cuddyer. &quot;So that's huge. We beat the teams that we're 'supposed to beat' and you have to do that. You have to beat the teams in your division and you have to beat the teams you're supposed to beat. That's the only way you're going to win.&quot;
<br /><br />Offense was certainly the story for the Twins during their series with the Royals, having outscored the club 36-7 in the three games while tallying 20, 19 and 14 hits in the respective contests.
<br /><br />On Wednesday, it was a Delmon Young home run that got things started against right-hander Brian Bannister in the first inning. Young belted his career-high 14th home run of the season -- a three-run shot to left field that traveled an estimated 436 feet -- to put the Twins up, 3-0.
<br /><br />Young has now hit safely in 13 of his last 15 games and is hitting .439 in July with six homers and 28 RBIs. His team-high RBI total is now at 79 on the season -- 63 of those RBIs have come since May 21.
<br /><br />&quot;Delmon's definitely different than we've seen Delmon in the past,&quot; Bannister said. &quot;I think he's the hottest hitter in baseball right now.&quot;
<br /><br />Jason Repko added another home run in the second inning, a one-out solo shot, giving the Twins their 12th homer over this seven-game trip. Minnesota then tallied three consecutive hits to start the fourth inning and padded their lead thanks to Denard Span's RBI single to left field.
<br /><br />But the offense hasn't been the biggest tale of this road trip. The Twins got things turned round for their starting staff, which posted a 6-0 record and 1.40 ERA over the seven contests. That's after the starting staff had posted a 6.51 ERA from June 18-July 21.
<br /><br />&quot;That's been the key to our wins,&quot; said catcher Joe Mauer, who went 12-for-25 (.480) on the trip. &quot;Yeah, we've scored a few runs here, but we're not going to do that every night. If we go out there and we can hold them to a couple runs here and there, I think it gives us a great chance of winning.&quot;
<br /><br />Left-hander Brian Duensing played a role in that turnaround, making his first two starts of the season during the road trip after he replaced Nick Blackburn in the rotation. Despite being on a limited pitch count for both contests, which included around 85 pitches on Wednesday, Duensing performed admirably.

		<document id="2b3da4e87f4558bee9b02fa5b04f32cc" url=""><![CDATA[Prime Time Shootout<br/><br/>Games will be played from early morning through late in the day. Perennial Non- Public B powerhouse St. Patrick’s will lead an array of talented teams, which includes Trenton Catholic and local powerhouse Rancocas Valley as well as local entries New Egypt, which has one of the best big men and one of the hottest NCAA Division I recruits in the state in Desmond Hubert, the Hun School, Robbinsville, Princeton and the host team looking to rebound from a struggling season.
<br /><br />Allentown boys basketball coach Tim Magnus credited the help from his assistant coach — Jay Graber, who has coached the freshman team — as well as Joe Morini, Ben Nazario and Jim Search for setting up the showcase, which he said will draw a number of college recruiters.
<br /><br />Magnus said he also will look to replace junior varsity and assistant boys coach Pat Sharkey who resigned last week as his team has worked to improve on last season when it won five games.
<br /><br />Most teams in the showcase will play four games and some will play only two. Allentown plays on Friday (Aug. 6) at 1 p.m. against West Windsor-Plainsboro North and has two back-to-back games on Saturday against Monroe at 8 p.m. and Nazareth at 9 p.m. before returning to the gym Sunday for an 8 a.m. game against Robbinsville.
<br /><br />Magnus said schedules were adjusted for the most convenience accordingly for teams that travel the farthest.
<br /><br />As for his own team, it will continue to concentrate on shooting and defense as it did in the Mercer County CYO Boys High School League it played in that has games on Monday and Wednesday evenings at its own school and others at West Windsor- Plainsboro North. Magnus said the Redbirds are 3-5 in each gym.
<br /><br />“I saw a lot of positive things, stuff we have built off from last year,” said Magnus, who must replace three starters (Mike Ballo, Dean Search and Matt Muller) who were among the eight graduates off last year’s team. “We’ve played really good defense and have kept teams in the 30s and 40s [points]. We have really good shooters but some are out of synch playing baseball and getting ready to play fall sports. We’ll have a stronger shooting team from last year.”
<br /><br />One good shooter returns in Dennis Brophy, an incoming senior who sank nine 3- pointers in a game last season. Matt Morini, an incoming junior who is one of many on this season’s team, again will run the offense that looks to compensate for its lack of size with its speed in an up-tempo approach.
<br /><br />But Magnus said it’s tough to adjust to the different styles of teams which this showcase will further help his players to master.

According to a recent report from the Centers for Disease Control, there aren't enough parks and playgrounds for children to be active every day. And while the lack of play opportunities affects all kids, it has a particularly negative effect on girls and kids in low-income neighborhoods.
<br /><br />According to the CDC report, only one in five homes has a park within a half-mile — and only 17 percent of blocks have a fitness or recreation center within that distance.  Without easy access to suitable places to play, kids today are not getting as much physical activity as they need — a key contributing factor to the childhood obesity epidemic.
<br /><br />The lack of play opportunities affects girls and kids in low-income neighborhoods in particular, where the play deficit is leading to increased rates of obesity.  Studies have shown that girls, in general, are less likely to participate in unstructured physical activity — or play — than boys.  A 2008 study from the Archives of Disease in Childhood, showed that only 11 percent of girls ages 5 to 8 get the recommended hour a day of physical activity, compared with 42 percent of boys. Without access to suitable playspaces, the issue is compounded.
<br /><br />KaBOOM! (kaboom.org/), a nonprofit dedicated to saving play for America's children, has been building playgrounds in underserved neighborhoods across the country for the last 14 years — helping to build playgrounds in low-income neighborhoods.  Part of the process includes the KaBOOM! Design Days where the neighborhood kids can &quot;design&quot; their dream playgrounds.  Using paper and crayons, KaBOOM! staffers invite the kids to draw their ideal playgrounds.  
<br /><br />While boys and girls may participate in play at different levels and in different ways, KaBOOM! has found through their Design Days that there aren't big differences in what boys and girls ask for in their dream playgrounds. Not surprisingly, slides, swings and clubhouses are popular items. On the less traditional side, kids have also asked for football fields, video games, dinosaur fossils — and most recently a pet shark.

The wonderfully uxorious Henry Francis just doesn’t seem to inspire the passion of her ne’er-do-well ex, Don Draper. And young Sally seems to be following in her mother’s footsteps. Will this show go truly creepy as Sally and Betty compete for Glen? If that happens, I could bail and opt for watching “Brady Bunch” re-runs on Sunday nights. (What Freddy Rumsen says of Roger Sterling’s swirling modernist painting is, however, equally true of my attitude toward this season: “I feel like I’m getting sucked into that thing.”)
<br /><br />Compelling darkness continues on the set of “Mad Men,” even when it is brightly lit with Christmas tree lights. The best relationships go unconsummated (Roger and Joan; Peggy and Don) or go awry professionally (Peggy and Freddy whose scenes tonight were wonderful). The worst relationships make unfortunate progress, or at least, “forward movement.” (Glen and Sally; Peggy and her boyfriend; Don and his secretary). Toril, what do you make of the boyish boyfriend who tries to persuade Peggy to follow the example of the “Swedish Way of Love”? Evangeline, just how bad was Don’s behavior with his secretary? (I’m betting that was her resignation letter we saw her typing after exiting Don’s office with her bonus).
<br /><br />Tonight’s new character is Dr. Faye Miller, a motivational researcher. Her appearance is timely: this was the period when, for better or worse, psychology was making its imprint in many fields. In a wonderful example of art anticipating life (or at least life on “Mad Men”), the blog McSweeney’s Internet Tendency has a wonderful send-up by Jim Stallard in which he imagines Sigmund’s daughter, Dr. Anna Freud, consulting Sterling Cooper about her desire to “reposition” her father’s work. This excerpt can only capture a bit of the flavor:
<br /><br />DON DRAPER: Miss Freud, we appreciate your making the trip all the way here from London… I must say, we were surprised to receive your call. Your father’s brand seems as dominant as ever. I wouldn’t think you need to tell the world about his theories…
<br /><br />ANNA FREUD: Well, as you know, we’ve dominated psychology for decades. But lately we’ve begun losing our share of the market to Behaviorism. People want a more comforting interpretation of their lives. …
<br /><br />DRAPER: …[But] people think of Freudian insights as rising above the crowd. It’s an attitude that says, “I’m educated. I’m not a mechanic.” I don’t think you toy with that. … You’re not Norman Vincent Peale.
<br /><br />For my money, there’s too much Freud going on in tonight’s episode for comfort, including the creepy musical image of “mommy kissing Santa Claus” that brilliantly accompanies the final credits. If this is Christmas, thank heaven it comes but once a year.

<br /><br />As the 7-2 second choice in a compact field of six over-achievers, the dependable 4-year-old son of Arch owned by Claiborne Farms and Adele Dilschneider turned his three-length deficit at the eighth pole into a narrow Gr. 1 $750,000 Whitney Handicap victory over the 1-2 Quality Road.
<br /><br />Jockey J.R.Velasquez, on the lead aboard Quality Road for almost the entire race, saw the writing on the wall as early as the quarter pole.  He looked long and hard over his left shoulder to see who was there coming at him.  It was the wrong side to look, as on his left side both Blame and Musket Man were advancing.  Quality Road should have had plenty left in the tank, thanks to his leisurely pace.  But Blame caught him anyway.
<br /><br />It was a Whitney that included four handicap division horses of very high caliber. Quality Road, Musket Man, Blame and Haynesfield had a combined winning percentage of 70 percent.  Three Whitney starters had won their last three races; two had won their last four. There were more Beyer speed figures over 100 in the PPs than you'd see at an NBA basketball game.
<br /><br />Blame's game was to run 12s. Nevertheless, few people in attendance expected that to add up to victory. Bridge jumpers poured cash into the show pool.  Of the $808, 560 placed there, more than $630,000 of it was wagered on Quality Road.  
<br /><br />It seemed there was something thrilling to see all day long. In the co-featured Gr.1 Test Stakes, Champagne D'Oro lived up to Eric Guillot's braggadocio. The trainer loud-mouthed his way through a local morning TV talk show, yet his filly's behavior on the racetrack in the late afternoon is what really spoke volumes.
<br /><br />The sixth race was a study in chaos. The favorite Justin Phillip never got to run in the 6-1/2 furlong sprint for 2-year-old maidens because he broke loose from the hold of his handlers and dashed off before he could walk in the post parade.  Thatcatismine reared at the start and dumped his rider. Tiz Blessed won and might have won anyway had none of this happened. He's a nice colt by Tiznow. 
<br /><br />Hall of Fame trainer Bill Mott sent out his 4000th winner as Sequoia Racing's Mystic won the seventh. The Unbridled Song's 4-year-old colt demonstrated why Mott is the ultimate pro. Mystic, reserved in midpack early on, was bumped several times before swinging three wide for his stretch run and still won. Other than that, there was very little action - Not!
<br /><br />On Sunday, fans will receive a Rachel Alexandra ball cap with each paid admission. Around these parts, Jess Jackson's filly remains &quot;Queen of the Turf&quot; - not Zenyatta.

<br /><br />United new-boy Javier Hernandez 'Chicharito' scored on his competitive debut for the side as Alex Ferguson's men started the new season with an important win.
<br /><br />Strikes from Antonio Valencia in the first half and an exquisite Dimitar Berbatov chip in added time condemned Chelsea to their fourth preseason defeat in a row.
<br /><br />Chelsea seemed to be briefly back in the game when Salomon Kalou capitalized on a rebound to make it 1-2 in the 83rd minute, but in the end it was Berbatov's brilliance that settled this game.
<br /><br />The 84,263 fans who crammed into Wembley on a muggy Sunday afternoon were not disappointed as both teams gave it their all in this showdown.
<br /><br />Sir Alex Ferguson had said before the game that the winner of this fixture would have the vital psychological advantage going into the new season and the Red Devils seemed to take him up for his word.
<br /><br />Carlo Ancelotti too was pumped up for this game and fielded a strong starting XI with the exception of Didier Drogba who started on the bench.
<br /><br />Edwin Van Der Saar who turns 40 in October was as usual at his brilliant best when he palmed away Branislav Ivanovic's powerful header at full stretch.
<br /><br />The Blues were creating chances and keeping the Dutchman busy but were unable to force a decisive opening.
<br /><br />United on the other hand were exploiting the space left by Ashely Cole at left-back as the England international seemed more intent on moving forward than fulfilling his defensive duties.
<br /><br />It was this rather lax show that led to the opener in the 41st minute as Paul Scholes, who was just brilliant all game, played a weighted ball over the top to Wayne Rooney.
<br /><br />The Merseysider may have had his boo boys in the crowd but, he convincingly beat John Terry to the ball and squared it first time in the box where Antonio Valencia made no mistake and put the Red Devils in the lead on the stroke of half-time.
<br /><br />Valencia's movement had been very good in the first half and with Chelsea leaving space at the back, it must be said the goal was coming.

<br /><br />Pakistan skipper Salman Butt blasted: &quot;It is not good to see players throwing balls intentionally at others and not excusing themselves properly.
<br /><br />&quot;Cricket is a gentleman's game but I think they got frustrated. The throw was just one thing - there were plenty of words said, too.&quot;
<br /><br />Haider was just 18 runs into his 88-run knock when the incident occurred - but Broad had already been showing some signs of simmering fury.
<br /><br />He had been denied an appeal for caught behind in the previous over and had also been guilty of blatantly ignoring the umpire when appealing for another caught behind early in the day.
<br /><br />Broad was hauled in front of Madugalle after play and faces either a one-match ban or a fine of 50 per cent of his match fee.
<br /><br />While the Pakistan players were convinced Broad's throw was deliberate, England team-mate Graeme Swann was happy to give his pal the benefit of the doubt.
<br /><br />He said: &quot;Knowing Broady as I do he didn't have any malice in it - he apologised right away. It was just a sign of frustration.&quot;
<br /><br />There was plenty to be frustrated about as Pakistan staged their astonishing late rearguard action.

The street below was bathed in a milky substance, diffusing light from lamps and completely obscuring the buildings across. Cars -- I knew they were cars, though all I saw were blurry bright dots in the milk -- were crawling along the highway not two hundred yards away. Smog?
<br /><br />Having decamped to Moscow with my daughter every summer for the last 10 years for our vacation, I was used to annual reports of fires and burning peat, the now predictable ravages of nature in a city surrounded by dried-up peat bogs and large forests. &quot;Just a reminder of how many forests Russia has&quot; was my sister's optimism-in-a-crisis view. But smoke in Moscow? Looking at the barely discernible panorama of my neighborhood, I was stunned, but vaguely hoped the &quot;fog&quot; would dissolve by morning, in what weather forecasters predicted was going to be another scorcher of a sunny day.
<br /><br />Moscow had greeted us this summer with an astonishing 100-degree heat, its highest temperature in recorded history, that seemed to hold up for weeks. Since early July It had rained once.
<br /><br />A few hours later as I stood on my balcony, the only difference was in the color of &quot;milk,&quot; which had changed to a pearly grey. My district -- in the ecologically favorable Western part of Moscow, hugging the gentle curve of the Moskva river, and blessed with a large park running for miles -- has always prided itself on cleaner, cooler air than the rest of the city. When I stepped outside that morning to buy drinks for my small family -- many liters of water, milk and juice, a much more important staple than food during this heat wave --- I discovered the air was, indeed, cooler. There were also no shadows. Smoke hung heavy and dense, impenetrable to light. The sun was nowhere in evidence. &quot;Our first stage of a nuclear winter,&quot; quipped my friend at a newspaper kiosk, with a smile that did not look happy. Within an hour I have heard from my friends and relatives across the city: the smoke was everywhere, irritating and impossible to ignore. If you had a car, you used fog lights; visibility was a hundred yards or less.
<br /><br />I had a busy day ahead. NBC correspondent Jim Maceda was on his way to Moscow to report on the raging fires across Russia, the unbearable heat and devastation the summer brought to the country whose people seem incapable of either giving up bonfires and throwing around cigarette butts, or equipping themselves with enough firefighting technology to face the consequences. This year alone over 5,000 fires have sprung up in Russia; by early August over 2,000 people were left homeless, and official reports put the number of fatalities at 50 and growing.The areas around the old towns of Voronesh, Nizhniy Novgorod, Ryazan, and now Moscow were being hit the worst. My job was to find a fire not far from Moscow, and send Jim into its midst.

		<document id="ae2100d1eb3277a49ff50d3303450971" url=""><![CDATA[Mainland Affairs Council Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan<br/><br/>Lai, who traveled to Washington, D.C. to brief groups in the United States on the economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) that was signed with China in late June, was unable to fly to Los Angeles as planned and returned to Taiwan via New York instead.
<br /><br />Local media reports said she was forced to cancel her visit to Los Angeles because her speech in Washington reportedly irritated the Chinese government because it said China was responsible for holding back cross-strait relations.
<br /><br />&quot;Even though cross-strait relations have greatly improved, they are still heavily impeded by two factors. First, mainland China is still continuing to expand its military deployment against Taiwan and second the mainland authorities are still not willing to change the policy and law that sanction the use of force against Taiwan, &quot; Lai said in Washington.
<br /><br />&quot;These are obstacles to the development of cross-strait relations and they need to be eliminated,&quot; Lai added in her speech.
<br /><br />The government's top China policy planner insisted, however, that the reports that reaction to the speech led her to change her travel plans &quot;are sheer speculation without any solid basis or evidence.&quot;
<br /><br />Lai attributed the cancellation to mechanical problems on the aircraft she was supposed to take to Los Angeles, and she said that after trying unsuccessfully for six or seven hours to secure a flight to the West Coast, she was forced to return home via New York.
<br /><br />The MAC chairwoman said she will visit Los Angeles later this year to meet with Taiwanese immigrants there.
<br /><br />On her Washington trip, Lai said U.S. officials, congressional members and think tank scholars she met during her visit supported the signing of the cross-strait ECFA and Taiwan and China's ongoing constructive interaction.
<br /><br />&quot;American friends in general highly support our ECFA deal with China as they believe the agreement could be a catalyst for Taiwan to be included into regional economic integration and forge closer economic ties with its major trading partners,&quot; Lai said.
<br /><br />American officials and opinion leaders also believe that the ECFA is something worthy of encouragement even for the U.S., she added.
<br /><br />According to an article carried in the Sunday edition of the United Evening News, Chinese officials in charge of Taiwan affairs and think tank scholars met all day Thursday after Lai said in Washington D.C. the previous day that China should renounce the right to use force against Taiwan.
<br /><br />The article quoted unidentified Chinese officials and scholars as saying that Taiwan should refrain from touching on such sensitive issues publicly to avoid derailing cross-strait engagements or ruin the political basis for mutual interaction.

<br /><br />Manish Malik, general manager, gaming, Hungama, says, “In terms of audience and adoption, mobile gaming has the largest base of consumers. The GPRS penetration amongst the current subscriber base is around 15 per cent and the gaming penetration is around 3 per cent and growing rapidly.”
<br /><br />Rohit Dadwal, managing director, MMA, says, “The average customers are from the tech savvy younger generation of urban India. Kids and young adults from the top eight metros are currently driving growth. A recent survey showed that approximately 40 per cent of all mobile gamers belong to 22-35 years of age, followed by 13-21 years and 35 plus.”
<br /><br />Of all gaming genres, cricket, racing and Bollywood games are most popular in India. However, lately, gamers have started enjoying role playing (player assumes the role of a character) and multi player games.
<br /><br />Hungama is working with some big Bollywood studios to create, publish and distribute content for movies and has created a series of games around Indian cricketer Yuvraj Singh.
<br /><br />Malik says, “The games have performed extremely well in the market, the primary reason being Bollywood and cricket are a good connect with the target audience.”
<br /><br />Rohith Bhat, managing director and chief executive officer, Robosoft, had earlier told Telecom Yatra, “Mobile games market in India has a huge potential. Indian market will straight away hop onto the mobile gaming scene without going through the consoles and web gaming revolution. We are already seeing increased uptake of social networking. Social gaming, I think, will be a similar success.”
<br />Revenue models:
<br /><br />The present mobile gaming ecosystem consists of game developers, game publishers, mobile operators, handset manufacturers, software developers and advertisers. Developers are the ones who create, design and test the games before launching them in the market, while publishers are responsible for promotion and marketing.

<br /><br />After missing the first three games of the best-of-five postseason series due to a family vacation to Alaska, Paquette stepped to the Cardinal Park mound and fired a six-hit complete game to help the Redbirds capture Game 4 with a 7-4 decision over the Fairmont Martins.
<br /><br />The South Dakota State University sophomore right-hander’s pitching, combined with Tony Sandbulte’s three hits and two runs scored, helped Luverne stave off elimination for a second consecutive game.
<br /><br />Luverne (21-9) plays host to Fairmont (29-11) during the fifth and decisive game of the series at 7:30 p.m. Thursday night at Redbird Field in Luverne.
<br /><br />The winner of Game 5 will face Wilmont, which swept Jackson in their best-of-five series, for the regional’s No. 1 seed and will determine their spot in the Minnesota Class C state tournament.
<br /><br />Paquette and Fairmont ace right-hander Shaun McGuire proved a pair of weary-armed warriors as both hurlers neared and/or cleared the 150-pitch mark en route to complete-game performances.
<br /><br />McGuire recorded nine strikeouts and issued only three walks, while allowing 11 hits. Unfortunately for McGuire, his defensive lineup committed seven errors, leading to four unearned Luverne runs.
<br /><br />Paquette, however, battled through an eighth-inning injury that made the Redbird faithful hold their collective breath to close out his complete-game effort.
<br /><br />“At first I thought he had spiked me, but it just scraped the skin on my ankle a little,” Paquette said in reference to accidentally get spiked when covering first base on a close play with one out in the Martins’ next-to-last at-bat. “I was still able to push off (the mound) without any problem.”
<br /><br />Paquette surrendered a two-out single to Max Waletich in the eighth, but received a nice sliding catch from Luverne right fielder Taylor Van Santen on Dustin Zellmer’s sinking liner to end the threat.
<br /><br />The Redbirds tacked on two insurance runs during the top of the ninth inning. Jeff Sehr was grazed with a two-out delivery before consecutive singles by Tim Connell, Tanner Skattum and Zack Clark pushed the lead to 7-4.
<br /><br />Paquette then worked around a two-out walk to Pete Bissen in the last of the ninth to seal his pitching victory and even the series at two games each.

In last year's preseason opener, Patriots starters played into the second quarter, and Brady finished 10 of 15 for 100 yards, with two touchdowns and one interception. Some have speculated that Brady might not want to see extended time on the field until his contract situation is resolved because of the possibility of injury, but there has been no indication from Brady himself that this is the case.
<br /><br />3. Brandon Spikes in the middle. The late-second-round draft choice was moved into the starting lineup on the fourth day of training camp when Gary Guyton was sidelined with a knee injury and has been there since. He's a big presence next to Jerod Mayo, and Belichick seems intrigued by his instincts and feel for the game. Mayo also likes what he sees, but cautioned not to read too much into things at this point. &quot;He's a good player. I knew that when he was at Florida and I was at Tennessee,&quot; Mayo said. &quot;He's stepped in and done a nice job so far, but we haven't really done too much. Ask me that question after some games.&quot;
<br /><br />4. Where is the pass rush coming from? Because making contact with quarterbacks is off limits in training camp, it's been difficult to gauge the team's pass rush. Second-round draft choice Jermaine Cunningham and five-year veteran Rob Ninkovich have shown explosiveness at times in complementing Tully Banta-Cain at outside linebacker. But does that show up in the game?
<br /><br />5. Strength of depleted offensive and defensive lines. The Patriots have taken some big hits at the line of scrimmage, working without Logan Mankins (contract standoff), Nick Kaczur (back) and Ty Warren (hip). That's a lot of power, consistency and toughness to account for. Five-year veteran Dan Connolly will start at left guard, while veterans Gerard Warren and Damione Lewis are key players to watch early at defensive end.
<br /><br />6. Tight ends in the red zone. Rookie Rob Gronkowski and Aaron Hernandez haven't missed a training camp practice and they have been a major part of the team's red-zone and goal-line work. Hernandez, the team's impressive fourth-round draft choice, looks like he is in position for a major offensive role this season.

<br /><br />ProActive designated hitter Grady Luzier came up with the biggest hit of the game, knocking in three go-ahead runs with a bases-clearing double in the top of the seventh inning.
<br /><br />&quot;Actually, it was the calmest I've ever been at the plate,&quot; Luzier said. &quot;For not playing for a year, and finally coming back, [I was] just looking for something to drive. He gave me the perfect pitch to drive.&quot;
<br /><br />Luzier, although going just 1-for-4 at the plate, had five RBIs.
<br /><br />Down 6-5 entering the seventh, ProActive exploded in the final inning of an already offense-heavy game. Catcher Vince Nedimyer led off the inning with a single to center field, and right fielder Jake Settle followed that up with a double that went just past Lilly third baseman Lucas McCoy and down the line. A walk loaded the bases, and Luzier then sent a shot to left that almost went out of the park. Four batters later, ProActive's Jake Hargreaves brought home two runs with a double of his own.
<br /><br />Hargreaves finished the contest 1-for-3 with two RBIs.
<br /><br />&quot;We knew we had three more outs, and we just needed a baserunner, and it sort of snowballed,&quot; ProActive manager Tom Smith said. &quot;We had some good at-bats, Grady was able to deliver a clutch hit, and Jake Hargreaves added on with his two-run double.
<br /><br />&quot;We just stepped up and hit the ball that last inning.&quot;
<br /><br />Lilly catcher C.J. McCoy went 2-for-3 with three RBIs, while teammate Brent Davison was 2-for-4 with three RBIs.
<br /><br />Davison pulled through with a clutch hit of his own, smacking a three-run, inside-the-park home run in the fifth inning. Davison had to beat the throw from ProActive shortstop Sean Gority to score, and the hit gave Lilly its 6-5 advantage.
<br /><br />The two teams traded scores often throughout the game. Lilly's Matt Petrowsky opened the scoring with an RBI triple to right field in the first inning.
<br /><br />ProActive scored four runs in the third, and Lilly responded with two runs in its half of the fourth, cutting the deficit to one, 4-3, and setting up the epic finish.
<br /><br />Lilly manager Bill Colosimo thought his team played well despite not closing out the game and the championship.
<br /><br />&quot;A couple of things go wrong, and then he [Luzier] hits a 390-foot ball,&quot; Colosimo said. &quot;What can you do? I mean they hit the ball well, we hit the ball well. They got some breaks, and we got some breaks. Hats off to them.&quot;

TUI Travel Plc tumbled 10 percent after the travel operator said earnings will be at the lower end of forecasts. Intercontinental Hotels Group Plc fell 4.1 percent. Homebuilders Taylor Wimpey Plc and Barrett Developments Plc fell as a report showed U.K. house prices retreated in July.
<br /><br />The benchmark FTSE 100 Index fell 34.11, or 0.6 percent, to 5,376.41 at the 4:30 p.m. close in London, paring yesterday’s 1.5 percent rally. The FTSE All-Share Index declined 0.7 percent and Ireland’s ISEQ Index slid 0.9 percent.
<br /><br />Stocks followed Chinese equities lower after data on trade and property prices pointed to a deepening slowdown in the world’s third-biggest economy. The Shanghai Composite Index tumbled 2.9 percent, its biggest fall in six weeks.
<br /><br />“After yesterday’s short, sharp rally, the market is treading more carefully,” said London-based Manoj Ladwa, a senior trader at ETX Capital. “Downward pressure on equities is coming from China, as an increasing trade surplus is likely to hurt global growth.”
<br /><br />China Trade
<br /><br />China’s trade surplus reached an 18-month high as exports rose to a record and imports grew more slowly. Separate figures showed that property prices in 70 major Chinese cities climbed 10.3 percent in July from a year earlier, the slowest pace for six months.
<br /><br />Vedanta, which mines for copper, aluminum and zinc, dropped 4 percent, the stock’s biggest fall since June 29, to 2,480 pence as base metals declined in London. BHP, the world’s biggest mining company, fell 2.3 percent to 1,991.5 pence and Xstrata slid 3 percent to 1,053 pence, the biggest declines for both stocks since July 1.
<br /><br />Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange fell as much as 2.7 percent to $7,223.5 a metric ton. The metal rose as much as 1.6 percent yesterday amid speculation that the Federal Reserve will use more stimulus to shore up the U.S. economy.
<br /><br />The Federal Open Market Committee plans to release a statement at about 2:15 p.m. in Washington.
