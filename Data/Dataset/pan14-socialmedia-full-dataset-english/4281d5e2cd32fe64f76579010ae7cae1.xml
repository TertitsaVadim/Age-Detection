<br /><br />The Wunderbag Micro Pre-filter is the revolutionary filtration system that gives Dustless Vacuums a serious advantage over other vacuums. It’s not just another vacuum bag filter; it can actually captures particles down to .5 microns leaving only the .3 micron particles for the HEPA filter. This greatly improves vacuum performance and extends the life of the expensive HEPA filter. The Wunderbag is designed to hold up to 80 pounds of dust while the vacuum is made to be emptied at 40 pounds. This gives the filter 50% more surface area to ensure that there is always room to support proper airflow, which is crucial in dust control applications. Economically priced, the Wunderbag is simple to install and retains its strength even when wet. There really is no other vacuum filter bag like it!
