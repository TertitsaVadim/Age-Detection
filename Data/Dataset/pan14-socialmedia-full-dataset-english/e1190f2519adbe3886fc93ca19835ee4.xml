Why this such beautiful that ever happened to me has to be over. I was mad, i was crying, I was up set and complicated.
<br />and there's time I m really want to get over with in something. I wish the time moves so fast so this thing can be over soon. And after all that over and my wish come true, what'd I do?
<br />its a lil' bit took a while when I m realized that every end is new beginning. 
<br />After all life is a journey with adventure in it. Even there has to be end but your life will still continue, the journey will be starting with next chapter in your book. Many colors will fill when something has to be end and we start with new color again. And this is wonderful isn't? <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/4185//smilies/angel.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/4185//smilies/wub.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/4185//smilies/flowers.gif" alt=":)" />

<br />What I’ve done? <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/4185//smilies/biggrin.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />What I’ve achieved? <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/4185//smilies/biggrin.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />Can’t tell you about this cause its so relatives
<br />Well at least I m always see my life as Chrome. It’s the member VI B of periodic table. This element will show their color when it accepted or released energy… Chrome its self came from Greek world means color. And this is how me. Chrome can be play as protector for another material or make it more beautiful such as the stone which well know as “Zamrud”. But when unstable it can caused damage to… <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/4185//smilies/biggrin.gif" alt=":)" /> So, which one is me? I think all of them… I bet all the man like that after all we’re human. And god designs us as part of devil and the other half part of Angel. That’s why many people sometimes “KESETANAN” but some how there’s no “Kemalaikatan”.
<br /><br />This is my plan for tomorrow… get my French class from 8.00 to 12.00 and I know I m kind lack of money here after Mudik when my friends will kidnap me from some junk food restaurant. They ask me for some lil’celebration. I’ll take it as challenge what I can do for them in my lack of money situation.
<br />Do you want to donate me? <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/4185//smilies/biggrin.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />Well there’ be no necessary just wish my luck with a lil prayer that’ll be help.
<br />So, Happy Birthday to me…
<br />Deo gratias

It is been a while since I don't know, may be when I was at junior high to spend my time at home alone. It's used to be fun. I can sleep, cooking and do anything. Including messing my sister and brother's room. but now, times has passed away...
<br />And I m starting all activities that's i wanna do when people gone. But after couple hours i realized everything is so silent, then i was trying to get sleep at 10.00 AM but it is useless since i don't like to take a nap. I don't like TV either, and when i saw the paper. the news is still the same. Global warming. I think people now is too smart so the forget where  they live.
<br />And then i don't know how my weekend end up at some shoes store... suddenly  i was stood up and starring a piece of art.  Hmmmm.....
<br />What should I do??? <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/4185//smilies/biggrin.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />The shoes is always the cure i guess..... but to spend time alone at my home... it is always great cause you'll never know where you'll end .. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/4185//smilies/biggrin.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/4185//smilies/biggrin.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/4185//smilies/tongue.gif" alt=":)" />

<br />So, I always keep it on my mind those words. Cause sometimes and it’s often when I wake up in the morning that’s a big question mark above my head. What’s for today? Why GOD gives the mercy by giving me another day. 
<br />I was cursed by yesterday even I have been fighting with the night but YOU still give me another day.  YOU kept convince my self that I m worthy to have another day. YOU gave me all those chance in another day.
<br /><br />So, what make me still in conscious this week? Cause I m realize that GOD give me another day to say How amazing what we have, my BF and me.  Hardly to realized it ‘because I love and easily got lost by searching and forget what we’ve found. 
<br /><br />I m glad today and say it. Thank GOD for all those amazing feeling you gave to me. Thanks GOD for giving me the chance to feel it and to say it. 
<br />No one can’t feel what I feel and I bet what we had is special for us. But most important that… it is surprise that I can stand with you. Hard to believe for my self too but it is true. . That’s why I called amazing  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/4185//smilies/biggrin.gif" alt=":)" />

For protecting me from the worst mistakes, covered me with happiness and sending me a lot friends and people who helping to through the days. Friends make my life colorful with sad, tears, pains, laughs, loves and happiness, friend which keep me always conscious, makes me always be loved and in love.
<br />Open my mind to see the best side of worst. You have given me ability to see the best part of the villain by his self, to feel the heart of the man who lost and try to find his way, to watch his struggle for finding his home and the meaning of it. Even it is not fair to say that my life is better than he is. I just wish YOU can give YOUR LOVE to him as much as to me. And all the mercy so he can run his life peaceful and what he has done can bring goodness and kindness for him and this life. Hmmm… cause I never met some one before  who so afraid with his own adventure.  Fear his own life, have no courage to face reality, what a pity. Life should be to face it not to fake it. I though he is brave man and dare to love, well I guess that my mistake for thinking like that. I never have right either to call him coward, but never mind with that…he'll find his own dignity in his soul not in someone's body  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/4185//smilies/biggrin.gif" alt=":)" />  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/4185//smilies/biggrin.gif" alt=":)" />  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/4185//smilies/biggrin.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />I believe there’s a purpose when YOU sent him to me, for me and for him. Like always. 
<br />Thanks for all the days YOU have given to me  Sorry sometimes I take it with wrong way… but YOU never give up to give me another days and years,  Deo Gratias! 
<br />Behind every fortune there is a crime - Balzac &quot;what a qoute!!&quot;</em>

I don’t know in which part but as I recall there’s no “Shanking Martini”. There no “my Name is Bond. James Bond!” the Aston Martin is only passing through, and the Bond seems so cold may be because of his lost.  I guess this part makes my Bond more Human than before. 
<br />But still, my favorite spy is Jason Bourne… because he can fight with bare hand, his move so fast, and less talk but more action. That;s the important things. He works alone,  and the lost of his ID makes want him to be simple man. I guess this why I never want to find a superhero type for my man<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/4185//smilies/biggrin.gif" alt=":)" />, just simple ordinary person. he is trying to be monogamy (its is simple things isn't it<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/4185//smilies/unsure.gif" alt=":)" />. Simplicity - Ordinary things, some how its cost so much for several people. Like Jason Bourne (what ever his name). and me <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/4185//smilies/biggrin.gif" alt=":)" /> 
<br />So who is your favorite spy? And tell me about it?

This wedding was very huge as huge as when the Don's Daughter get married... the big band, cakes, champagne and many more. At the time we're just realized the our little friend is not as common people like us.but a princess in her's daddy kingdom. 
<br />She is the only Daughter of the Famous Company in my town ( I just found out a week before when she was going to get marry, silly me i missed this socialite, cause she rather to be home than to hang out or go to the traditional market especially handy craft... i think i miss the info. so, when everybody found out that i m a friend of her, they told me... nobody treat her like the way i treated her.. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/4185//smilies/biggrin.gif" alt=":)" /> ) and her husband is the only Child of the Textile Factory out side of this City (Very Lucky for Her). We knew her when she was asking about making the some events and i m kind proud to her. cause she got the education degree far far away from here but she is very concern about the culture and heritage of this nation. That's why we never know if she was a very high valuable girl in this country (wkakakakak... too <em>lebay</em>!!!) anyway, i think we have to ask apologize cause once of time we brought her to the another side this city and we walked... with very indecent food. We talked to the owner of this city in very causal way .... and we talked about life value. and both of in our time they called us material girls... cause we have something in common about money... i think that;s the one thing that we can get a long each others
<br />I m very sorry &quot;L&quot; but we proud of you. Thanks to make us part of the event and the company that you build and yes you're right.. lets make us proud to be Indonesian....!!  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/4185//smilies/hug.gif" alt=":)" />

That’s just some question when I feel that God put me in hell of earth. As matter of fact we created the sorrow it self, the misery and all the pain. Make the life so complicated than used to be. When we feel that we have no ability for gain of what we want, when we feel we’re in failed. But it’s true that we are failed?
