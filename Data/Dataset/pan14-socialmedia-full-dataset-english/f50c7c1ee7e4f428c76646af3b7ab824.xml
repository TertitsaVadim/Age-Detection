<br /><br />Memory chip maker Micron Technology (NAS: MU) recently came out with fiscal third-quarter losses that were much wider than what analysts had expected. However, what's proved to be even more disappointing is the fact that Micron has made its biggest yet, fourth consecutive quarterly loss.
<br />So what seems to be the real problem with Micron? Before we delve into the details, let's take a closer look at the numbers.
<br /><br />The numbers
<br />Micron's revenue increased 8% on a sequential basis, although it remained relatively flat from the prior-year period. This was mainly because of a 20% sequential increase in revenue in the DRAM segment -- the result of a combination of higher sales volumes and average selling prices.
<br />Unfortunately, on the other hand, Micron incurred a loss amounting to $320 million, as part of a series of quarterly losses mainly caused by the prevailing softness in the flash memory market. Revenue from the company's NAND segment remained largely flat, despite a whopping 40% increase in sales volumes, mainly because of weak market prices.
<br />However, one can take heart from the fact that these problems are not specific to Micron, as its peers in the NAND industry have also been having a hard time of late. For instance, flash memory king SanDisk's (NAS: SNDK) net income declined almost 50% as compared to the prior-year period because of weak market prices.
<br /><br />The bright side
<br />Micron has a few other reasons to feel happy as well. Demand in the DRAM space is beginning to show some signs of bottoming out. Plus, a further boost in the DRAM segment should occur when Microsoft releases its newest Windows 8 operating system, which in turn, should stimulate demand from Micron's OEM customers, namely Intel and Hewlett-Packard.
<br />Micron is also in the process of taking over the bankrupt Japanese DRAM manufacturer Elpida Memory. If the company is successful, this would double Micron's market share in the DRAM space and should somewhat reduce competition as well. Nevertheless, the positive effect of this development remains to be seen.
<br /><br />The flip side 
<br />But the company has its share of concerns, too. The NOR flash space is witnessing tough times. According to a TechNavio analyst forecast, the global NOR flash market will decline at a CAGR of -5% from 2011 through 2014 mainly because of a decline in average selling prices. However, the increasing demand for NOR chips could be a long-term positive in this direction.
<br />The NAND flash space is also passing through a turbulent phase, and Micron could see this segment of its business take a hit in the coming months. This is because NAND flash memory chips, used in mobile devices and solid-state drives, or SSDs, have been facing weak demand, coupled with oversupply issues of late.
<br /><br />The Foolish bottom line
<br />Micron is currently trading at a price-to-book ratio of just 0.7, which at first makes it seem attractive. However, I'd prefer to watch from the sidelines until Micron starts putting some cash on the table. The company's acquisition of Elpida could work in its favor in the long run, provided there is a significant improvement in the DRAM space.

<br /><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/182651526_1407535_49721710.jpg" />
<br />A study released in Micron Associates highlighted nicotine replacement therapy is the safest way for people discharged from the hospital after suffering a heart attack or chest pains.
<br />This is good news for a group of patients whose need to quit smoking.
<br />“We know continued smoking after a heart attack greatly increases the risk of a recurrent heart attack, (but) the ability of patients to quit smoking cold turkey is pretty low in general,” said Dr. Kevin Woolf, a cardiologist at Hillsboro Cardiology in Oregon, who led the study.
<br />Anti-smoking medications, such as the nicotine patch, gum, inhalers and lozenges, can double the chances that would-be quitters will actually kick the habit, said Woolf.
<br />But, he added, there has been a theoretical concern that nicotine replacement might come with its own hazards for heart patients.
<br />“We know that nicotine causes constriction of the arteries, which on paper could potentially harm patients with arteries in the heart that were already somewhat blocked,” Woolf told Micron Associates.
<br />To see whether nicotine replacement therapies do cause harm, Woolf and his colleagues collected medical information on 663 smokers discharged from the hospital after having acute coronary syndrome – which includes a heart attack or feeling chest pain without exercising, a condition called unstable angina.
<br />Doctors prescribed a nicotine replacement product, in most cases the patch, to 184 of the patients.
<br />After one year, the patients who received a prescription fared about as well as those who didn’t.
<br />Woolf and his colleagues report in the American Journal of Cardiology that 29 percent of the people in the nicotine group and 31 percent of the people in the other group died or experienced another major heart problem within a year of leaving the hospital.
<br />“This study adds support to safely using this medication after an acute coronary syndrome,” Woolf said.
<br />Dr. Stephen Kimmel, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania, said the study backs up many cardiologists who had already considered nicotine replacement safe.
<br />“If you’ve just had a heart attack or another heart event you should talk to your doctor and ask them about this therapy. Make sure you raise the issue if your doctor doesn’t, because it can help you and it seems safe,” said Kimmel, who was not involved in the study.
<br />Woolf said having an anti-smoking aid available to smokers’ right out of the hospital is important “because it’s a golden opportunity to assist them.”
<br />“When somebody comes into the hospital with a heart attack, it’s a wake-up call for them,” Woolf said, and they might be more willing to change their habits than later on.
<br />The study didn’t find out whether patients prescribed nicotine replacement therapy actually used it, nor whether those who were not prescribed it might have gotten their own over-the-counter nicotine replacement products.
<br />“But we can get a sense of things,” said Woolf. “Averaged over a large population, we should be able to tease out any trends that emerge from getting a prescription.”
<br />Woolf said an experiment that tracks the health of people who use nicotine replacement products, compared to the health of those who don’t, would be the best measure of the medicines’ safety.

<br />New Jersey- A couple Joann Smith and Wayne Betha who owns the real estate firm pleaded guilty to stealing from home sellers by taking profits from home sales, and well as defrauding mortgage companies by falsifying the earnings of loan applicants.
<br /> According to the report released on Mortgage Fraud Blog and reviewed with the Micron Associates Professionals, it showed that between the month of August 2006 and February 2008, with their real estate firm, S&amp;B Property Management and Maintenance LLC of Trenton, the couple stole over $600,000 from sellers in connection with 11 home sales. Smith and Betha ostensibly averted the sales into their own bank accounts for their personal use, misleading the seller into believing they were not entitled to all of the profits from their homes.
<br /> The couple used a variety of schemes to fraudulently divert proceeds from the home sales into bank accounts maintained by Smith and S&amp;B. They represented to sellers and title companies that monies were owed to them for expenses, including property renovations and repairs that were never done and exorbitant consultant fees that they claimed the sellers had authorized. Many of the checks issued by the title companies handling the property sales were written to the home sellers, but Smith convinced the sellers to sign the checks over to her for payment of business expenses and fees. In several instances, the defendants falsely indicated on HUD forms and tax forms that the sellers directly received all of the profits from the home sales. They also omitted to tell sellers that they were agreeing in mortgage closing documents to pay large, unauthorized “seller’s concessions or seller’s assists” to the buyers.
<br /> Most of the sellers were having serious health financial problems and could not continue paying their mortgages. The 11 homes are in Trenton (4 homes), Ewing (1 home), Hamilton (2 homes), Orange (1 home), Willingboro (2 homes), and Camden (1 home), New Jersey.
<br /> In arranging for sales of three of the homes, Smith and Betha provided false information about the salary or wages of the buyers on settlement forms filed with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and mortgage applications, causing three mortgage companies to issue loans totaling approximately $641,800.
<br />The victims were not financially sophisticated. They did not understand the details of the property closings and, because of their financial woes, were anxious to be free of the obligation of paying mortgages they could no longer afford. Smith and Betha took advantage of these facts to steal the victims’ profits from the home sales.
<br />Smith sometimes wrote false notations on checks written from her account and the S&amp;B account to make it appear that payments were made for home repairs. Other times she would write a small check to the seller and write “gift” in the memo portion of the check. Smith and Betha used the diverted funds for personal expenses, withdrawing hundreds of thousands of dollars, primarily as ATM withdrawals, checks written to cash, and checks written to Betha.
<br />No corporate business tax returns were filed with the State of New Jersey for S&amp;B for 2005 through 2008. Smith also failed to file state personal income tax returns for those years. Betha failed to file a state personal income tax return for 2007.
<br />Under their plea agreements, they will each face a sentence of five to 10 years in state prison and will be required to enter a consent judgment to pay restitution to the home sellers, as well as the mortgage lenders, to the extent that the lenders have sustained losses.

<br />A computer virus is a computer program that can copy itself and infect a computer without your permission or knowledge. Viruses can also spread to other computers by email or when you connect to the Internet. The term “computer virus” is sometimes used as a catch-all phrase to include computer viruses, worms, root kits, and other exploits. Once on your computer, many of these threats tend to show little to no symptoms so they can survive undetected or they can disable your anti-virus software without you being aware. At the same time, less than 25% of computers are fully protected because the anti-virus software is not kept up-to-date, installed on all the computers in a home, or the operating system or other applications have not been patched to fix security holes. These issues highlight a fundamental flaw in today’s home network security and why an additional layer of protection is needed.

<br /><br />Thomas and Raymond Kwok, the billionaire co-chairmen of Asia's largest developer Sun Hung Kai Properties, and Rafael Hui, Hong Kong's former No.2 public official, appeared at a Hong Kong court today to hear formal corruption charges against them.
<br />This is Hong Kong’s biggest corruption case in 40 years. The charges come after investigations between government officials and the city’s tycoons. That has touched a nerve with angry citizens who are concerned at the wide spread corruption between a  leading public figure and the two billionaire property developers.
<br />After attending the one hour hearing where they were both formally charged, the youngest brother Raymond Kwok talked to a waiting press corp, saying in Cantonese, that he had done nothing wrong
<br />&quot;I firmly believe I haven't done anything wrong. The Hong Kong judicial system is very fair. I will do my best to defend myself against these accusations. My goal is to prove my innocence. Thank you.&quot;
<br />Three others have also been charged in the Sun Hung Kai case. Thomas Chan, the Sun Hung Kai board member in charge of land purchases, Francis Kwan, a former banker and a former chief operation officer of the Hong Kong Futures Exchange. Thomas Kwok's lawyer declined to comment while lawyers representing the other four could not immediately be reached for comment.

<br /><br />HONG KONG — Tens of thousands including teachers and parents pushing strollers took to Hong Kong streets Sunday to protest the upcoming introduction of Chinese patriotism classes they fear will lead to brainwashing, the latest sign of growing discomfort over Beijing's influence in the semiautonomous territory.
<br />Students and pro-democracy activists were among those who marched to the Hong Kong government's headquarters to protest the new curriculum, which authorities are encouraging schools to begin using when classes resume in September.
<br />They fear the classes will be used to brainwash children into supporting China's Communist Party. The government has denied that and says they are aimed at building Chinese national pride.
<br />The controversy flared up after reports emerged that pro-Beijing groups published a booklet for use in classes that extolled the virtues of one-party rule.
<br />&quot;China wants Hong Kong's next generation to know how great it is and not know the bad stuff,&quot; said Chan Yip-Long, a 9-year-old primary school student. &quot;The booklet is very biased, so I am opposing it.&quot;
<br />The protest is the latest sign of growing discontent in Hong Kong over mainland China's increasing influence 15 years after the freewheeling financial center was returned to China by Britain following more than a century of colonial rule. Tensions have also been stoked by growing economic inequality and as well as an influx of free-spending wealthy Chinese, who are seen as driving up property prices and shop rents.
<br />Hong Kongers are also angry about stunted democratic development. Beijing has pledged that Hong Kong can elect its own leader in 2017 and all legislators by 2020, though no roadmap has been laid out. On July 1, tens of thousands of people protested over the city's new leader, Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying, who was chosen by an elite pro-Beijing committee and is widely suspected of having close ties to the Communist Party.
<br />Sunday's demonstrators carried placards and banners and shouted slogans calling for the government to withdraw its plan to introduce the Moral and National Education curriculum.
<br />The government has stood firm and plans to make the subject compulsory in primary schools starting in 2015 and in secondary schools the year after, although schools are encouraged to start using it earlier.
<br />According to the curriculum guidelines, students will learn about China's political leaders, the efforts and contributions they have made and the difficulties and challenges they face, as well as how to &quot;speak cautiously,&quot; practice self-discipline and get along well with others in a rational and respectful manner.
<br />Police estimated 32,000 people turned out for Sunday's protest. Despite blazing heat, many parents were there, pushing infants and young children in strollers. A group of young girls chanted, &quot;We want the truth, we don't want brainwashing.&quot;

But Micron Associates reveals, if your toothbrush stays on your teeth for half of an hour, your teeth can possibly damage.The acid burns into both enamel and dentin, the lower layer below the enamel, after taking fizzy or acidic drinks.Having a wrong time of brushing your teeth, specifically within 20 minutes after a meal can get-up-and-go the acid deeper into your teeth, rusting them far faster than they would have decayed by themselves.The president of the Academy of General Dentistry, Dr. Howard R. Gamble quoted, “With brushing, you could actually push the acid deeper into the enamel and the dentin.”Volunteers make a sample on how this will happen. They wore human dentin samples in their mouths, and tested different brushing procedures.After brushing the teeth within 20 minutes, it noticeably damaged the teeth after drinking soda.If you are more likely to eat spicy meal, better to wait for an hour to prevent the possible negative effects.However, researchers said that after intra-oral periods of 30 and 60 min, where not significantly higher than in was unbrushed controls.Micron Associates concluded that for you to protect the dentin surface, wait at least 30 minutes before brushing your teeth.Scrap your negative moodPut yourself on your side! Make a commitment to yourself to become a more positive person. Don’t do it because others want you to do or as a reaction to somebody else’s opinions; it for you and because of you. You will be the one to reap the benefits in the first place.Make a change in your attitude and your words. ”I hope it doesn’t rain” can be swapped by “It would be nice to have a sunny day”; a longer commuting to work that you always thought as tiring can be seen as a brilliant opportunity to listen to music, read, or chat with a stranger . It all depends on the point of view.Get yourself two or three books on positive thinking and make a point of reading at least ten pages a day. This will make a difference on the way you look at life over time. Besides, some of the books on positive thinking that you can find are real keys to enjoying a better life.Surround yourself with positive and uplifting people. When you meet someone that makes you feel better because they look on the bright side of life, decide to speak with them more often. Pay attention to the way they see life and the words they choose to use.Create your own set of affirmation cards with positive thinking affirmations that you can carry with you and read anytime, anywhere. You could read the whole set of affirmations in the first hour of the day and before you go to sleep for a number of days, and observe the good impact this habit has on you.Deal with streswww. Avoid predictable stressful situations. If a certain sport or game makes you tense (whether it’s tennis or bridge), decline the invitation to play. After all, the point of these activities is to have a good time. If you know you won’t, there’s no reason to play.2. Competing with others, whether in accomplishments, appearance, or possessions, is an avoidable source of stress. You might know people who do all they can to provoke envy in others. While it may seem easy to say you should be satisfied with what you have, it’s the truth. The stress from this kind of jealousy is self-inflicted.3. Eliminate as many sources of stress as you can. For example, if crowds bother you, go to the supermarket when you know the lines won’t be too long. Try renting videotapes rather than going to crowded movie theaters. Clear up the clutter in your life by giving away or throwing away the things that get in your way. A garage sale is one effective way to do this.4. If you can’t remove the stress, remove yourself. Slip away once in a while for some private time. These quiet moments may give you a fresh perspective on your problems. Avoid stressful people. For example, if you don’t get along with your father-in-law but you don’t want to make an issue of it, invite other in-laws at the same time you invite him. Having other people around will absorb some of the pressure you would normally feel.5. If you suffer from insomnia, headaches, recurring colds, or stomach upsets, consider whether stress is part of the problem. Being chronically angry, frustrated, or apprehensive can deplete your physical resources.6. Labor saving devices, such as cellular phones or computer hookups, often encourage us to cram too many activities into each day. Before you buy new equipment, be sure that it will really improve your life. Be aware that taking care of equipment and getting it repaired can be stressful.7. Remember, sometimes its okay to do nothing.8. Try doing only one thing at a time. For example, when you’re riding your exercise bike, you don’t have to listen to the radio or watch television.9. If you are always running late, sit down with a pencil and paper and see how you are actually allotting your time. Say it takes you 40 minutes to get to work. Are you leaving your house on time? You may be able to solve your problem (and de-stress your life a bit) just by being realistic.10. If you can’t find the time for all the activities that are important to you, maybe you are trying to do too much. Again, make a list of what you do during the day and how much each activity takes. Then cut back.Setting your reasonable goalsChoose a weight that is appropriate and attainable.1. See what you want.Visualization is step No. 1. Sit in a chair and imagine you happy five or 10 or 25 years down the road. Be specific. Be clear. One big reason people fail to reach their goals is that those goals were amorphous to begin with. A goal like “buying your first house soon” is too wishy-washy. Deciding that you’d like to buy a three-bedroom Cape on a half-acre within 30 minutes of your workplace before the next school year is much better. There’s no need to be practical about this–think big.Once you have your vision, focus on how it makes you feel. As the research of Harvard psychologist Dan Gilbert has shown, you’re likely very good at identifying the things you believe you want. But when you get them, they often don’t make you as happy as you thought they would.To become a better forecaster of your own happiness, think about how you’ll feel if you get what you think you want. What kind of emotions will that elicit? How long will they last? Try to imagine as many aspects of the outcome as you can. Even winning the lottery has its hassles–cold calling from brokers, new found dealings with the tax man, tension in families.2. WRITE YOUR GOALS DOWN.Like any good idea, goals need to be written down so that you can refer back to them every now and again. You may decide to change them or to abandon them. That’s your prerogative. But they need to be in writing.Why? Because if you don’t write them down, you’re likely to forget them. When you see something, your brain holds onto that image for about a half-second. When you hear something, you retain it a little longer, say three seconds. Then you lose it, unless you make an effort to retain it, perhaps by repeating it to yourself over and over or creating an association (Mrs. Green has green eyes). To move a bit of information from your short-term memory into your long-term memory, where it can be available for you to recall, you either have to play with it–or go with the easier alternative: Write it down.3. TURN EACH GOAL INTO AN ACTION PLAN.Break each goal down into the steps you’ll need to take to achieve it. Say your goal is to save $5,000 in the next year. That may sound daunting–but saving $100 a week for 50 weeks doesn’t.4. UNDERSTAND THE TIME INVOLVED.We often overestimate how much we can accomplish in a single day and underestimate how much we can accomplish in a year, given just a little progress every day. That’s true whether you’re teaching a child to swim, writing a book or trying to lose 10 pounds. Quick fixes rarely work.Your guide to live a Healthy LifestyleKeep your diet balancedA balanced diet doesn’t mean not eating foods in a day; rather, it is minimizing your food to consume in a day. A food that has a variety of vitamins and minerals which your body needs including healthy fats. So, you must begin to fully understand nutrition and make sure that you eat the proper portions of protein, carbohydrates, and healthy fats. If you are having a hard time calculating the suggested supplements into your daily diet routine, you could try taking vitamin tablets in order to ensure that your body is ingesting the nutrients it needs.Exercise DailyMaking your body exercised everyday does not necessarily mean to keep you in shape; it is also for you to increase your morale. Your simple and short workout can have a massive impact on your morale and can make you feel happier about yourself, give you more confidence, and just make you feel positive in life. This doesn’t mean to spend hours in a day for exercise, just taking around 20 minutes to half an hour doing light exercise and not working up too much of sweat is enough for your healthy living lifestyle.Get a good night’s restHaving an enough sleep is very vital for your mind, body and soul. Researchers have found that those who sleep more than 8 hours or less than 4 hours a night are not as healthy as those who sleep 6-7 hours a night. The right range hours of your sleep enables you to take away of any fatigue and regain some energy which gets lost throughout the day from performing your daily tasks. Getting a good night’s rest allows your body to regain energy for you to feel much better, safe and sound in the morning.Start a new hobbyTaking a new hobby is a great way to feel better about yourself and for you to live a healthy life. It’s a great way for you to meet a new people. And also, this is a great way to enhance your interaction with others especially in making friends in which could also helps to improve your good communication and people skills.Feel your good surroundingsEnjoy the great creation of nature by taking short walks when you can. Even a 10 minute walk a day will make you feel much better about yourself. Find nice places close to home, or find a place where you might like to spend a little time to sit down and read a book. Being outdoors has a positive effect on your brain and will make you feel much more relaxed and composed.How to keep your mind sharp?Working out is not just one of the best way to say that you’re totally fit and healthy. You also have to take into consideration that Brain is the most essential part to keep you healthy as a whole especially for your good mental health.

You can use visualization to exercise your creative faculties keeping them alive and well.4. Avoid using a calculatorDo math the old-fashioned way to exercise your brain. Sometimes it seems hard to even remember how doing basic math in our heads. This is mental flabbiness. The best way to overcome it is the same way we learned math in the first place. Practice, practice and practice!5. Sing along to your much loved songMemorizing and recalling the lyrics of songs you love is a great way to exercise your brain. It can also be a lot of fun! Of course, your family and neighbors might disagree with me.6. Play a musical instrumentLearning to play an instrument can be challenging. This makes the perfect exercise for your brain. You want to be challenged. Push your mind and discover how much it still has to offer you.7. Memorize poetry and literary writingsMemorize and recite a love poem to your significant other. They’ll love you for it and so will your brain. Of course, if poetry isn’t your thing, then you can always memorize passages from classic wisdom literature or your favorite joke book! Suit yourself.8. Solve brain teasersBrain teasers come in all forms. There are the ones you solve on paper and the ones where you try to untangle a seemingly impossible puzzle. Either kind will serve our purpose. The trick really is just to get your mind working harder than normal.
