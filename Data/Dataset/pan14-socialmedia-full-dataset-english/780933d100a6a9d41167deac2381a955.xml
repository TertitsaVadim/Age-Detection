We have daily gallery openings, concerts and so much more more; LA events are top of the line. LA CANVAS is here to bring you the best of LA events each week, and we think we do it well. Here are a few of our favorite events happening this week:
<br /><br />Tuesday 6/12:  Nite Jewel, aka Los Angeles-based singer-songwriter Ramona Gonzalez, is returning home from tour this week to play an awesome LA event at The Echo. Her debut album One Second of Love dropped earlier this year on Secretly Canadian, and it’s full of dark, grungy electro beats bumping under airy, layered R&amp;B vocal melodies. If Ramona’s 2012 music video releases have proven anything, it’s that she’s a freakily good dancer with a twisted streak—so obviously, you’ll want to see her live. Paradise and Nicholas Krgovich are opening for what’s sure to be a slightly strange, but certainly fun <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5sYWNhbnZhcy5jb20v" target="_blank">LA event</a>.
<br /><br />Saturday 6/11: Old Pasadena: A beautiful place to stop and smell the jasmine while you stroll in search of gourmet cupcakes, frozen yogurt, or fancy nick-knacks. But let’s not get too comfortable–it’s time again for this epicenter of all-things yuppie to open up its streets to the masses, luring them in with some good ol’ rock n’ roll for one of our favorite annual <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5sYWNhbnZhcy5jb20v" target="_blank">LA events</a>. This year, Grimes, Cults and Grouplove headline this massive festival including four main stages and over 100 spontaneous performances. Don’t forget to stop by the LA CANVAS tent and say hi as you brave the madness.
<br /><br />So that’s it for this week.  Make sure to check out LACANVAS.com for a more extensive list of <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5sYWNhbnZhcy5jb20v" target="_blank">LA events</a> each week as we update our calendar constantly with events we love - and we’re sure you will too.

Here are a few of our favorite events happening this week:
<br /><br />Wednesday 6/20: When was the last time you went to an LA event featuring three live accordion acts? If you’re anything like us, that answer is never. Bar Lubitsch is hosting a one of a kind evening program with accordion acts Ketchup Soup, Timur &amp; The Dime Museum, and princessFrank &amp; The Killsisters. This isn’t just your crazy uncle playing at the family party either - these acts can rock on the accordion like nothing you’ve heard before. The <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5sYWNhbnZhcy5jb20v" target="_blank">LA event</a> is guaranteed to blow the house down - we just hope it won’t be literal.
<br /><br />Thursday 6/21: Next Thursday, LA CANVAS is taking over The Standard with a unique night of partying for a good cause. We’ve got eight of LA’s best street artists, including Mear One, Gregory Siff and Dee Dee Cheriel, at one LA event in order to paint on 8-ft cuts of premium denim. Then, !ITEM Denim will turn the artists’ creations into wearable art. After being exhibited at Project Las Vegas, the jeans will be auctioned off with all proceeds going towards the Art of Elysium, a non-profit which provides artistic workshops to children battling serious medical conditions. Oh yeah, did we mention it’s going to be an awesome party?
<br /><br />So that’s it for this week.

From the laying on the sand relaxing underneath the sun for hours to happening across celebrities as you walk around Hollywood, we really can’t imagine being anywhere else. Even thinking about my mornings sitting on the 110 in a mid-morning traffic jam, I still wouldn’t choose anywhere else. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5sYWNhbnZhcy5jb20v" target="_blank">Los Angeles events</a> are another major reason nobody wants to leave the city of Angels. Los Angeles events range from improv comedy to the annual Strawberry Festival in Ventura. Here are some we’re especially excited for this week.
<br /><br />6/23: Whoever thought cemeteries were single-purposed has never experienced a <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5sYWNhbnZhcy5jb20v" target="_blank">Los Angeles event</a> at the Hollywood Forever Cemetery. On Saturday nights, the public is invited to come picnic and experience a classic movie while laying down with some of Hollywood’s most noted founders and celebrities. This week is no different;Roman Polanski’s Chinatown is on the bill, and we can’t wait for it. Never has visiting the dead been so much fun.
<br /><br />6/25: Haven Gastropub + Brewery is without a doubt one of our favorite spots for guzzling craft beers and noshing on things like beer-soaked, housemade potato chips or hand-twisted pretzels with bacon-fontina cheese sauce—I mean, we can always eat Kale later right? This Monday night, Haven’s Executive Chef Greg Daniels is roasting a whole suckling pig to be served tableside as part of KCRW and Dine LA’s Dinner Date series. Tickets to this Los Angeles event are $30 (excluding beverages and gratuity), and all proceeds go towards KCRW.
<br /><br />These are just two <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5sYWNhbnZhcy5jb20v" target="_blank">Los Angeles events</a> from this week. Make sure to always check up on our website, LACANVAS.com for an up to date calendar of Los Angeles events we’re stoked for.
