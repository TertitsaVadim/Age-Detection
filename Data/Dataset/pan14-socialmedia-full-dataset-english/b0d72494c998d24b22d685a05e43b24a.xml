<br />Should I be feeling guilty or let the judges frown?
<br />'Cause I saw the end before we'd begun,
<br />Yes I saw you were blinded and I knew I had won.
<br />So I took what's mine by eternal right.
<br />Took your soul out into the night.
<br />It may be over but it won't stop there,
<br />I am here for you if you'd only care.
<br />You touched my heart you touched my soul.
<br />You changed my life and all my goals.
<br />And love is blind and that I knew when,
<br />My heart was blinded by you.
<br />I've kissed your lips and held your head.
<br />Shared your dreams and shared your bed.
<br />I know you well, I know your smell.
<br />I've been addicted to you.
<br /><br />Goodbye my lover.
<br />Goodbye my friend.
<br />You have been the one.
<br />You have been the one for me.
<br /><br />I am a dreamer but when I wake,
<br />You can't break my spirit - it's my dreams you take.
<br />And as you move on, remember me,
<br />Remember us and all we used to be
<br />I've seen you cry, I've seen you smile.
<br />I've watched you sleeping for a while.
<br />I'd be the father of your child.
<br />I'd spend a lifetime with you.
<br />I know your fears and you know mine.
<br />We've had our doubts but now we're fine,
<br />And I love you, I swear that's true.
<br />I cannot live without you.
<br /><br />Goodbye my lover.
<br />Goodbye my friend.
<br />You have been the one.
<br />You have been the one for me.
<br /><br />And I still hold your hand in mine.
<br />In mine when I'm asleep.
<br />And I will bare my soul in time,
<br />When I'm kneeling at your feet.
<br />Goodbye my lover.
<br />Goodbye my friend.
<br />You have been the one.
<br />You have been the one for me.
<br /><br />I'm so hollow, baby, I'm so hollow.
<br />I'm so, I'm so, I'm so hollow.
<br />I'm so hollow, baby, I'm so hollow.
<br />I'm so, I'm so, I'm so hollow

<br />Flat on the floor looking back
<br />On old love
<br />Or lack thereof
<br />After all the crushes are faded
<br />And all my wishful thinking was wrong
<br />I'm jaded
<br />I hate it 
<br /><br />I'm tired of being alone

<br />So tired of being alone
<br />So hurry up and get here

<br />I'm not sure who I'm looking for
<br />I'll know it
<br />When I see you
<br />Until then, I'll hide in my bedroom
<br />Staying up all night just to write
<br />A love song for no one 
<br /><br />I'm tired of being alone
<br />So hurry up and get here
<br />So tired of being alone
<br />So hurry up and get here 
<br /><br />I could have met you in a sandbox
<br />I could have passed you on the sidewalk
<br />Could I have missed my chance
<br />And watched you walk away? 
<br /><br />I'm tired of being alone
<br />So hurry up and get here
<br />So tired of being alone
<br />So hurry up and get here
<br />You'll be so good
<br />You'll be so good for me

<br />I guess You heard me cry
<br />You smiled at me 
<br />Like Jesus to a child
<br /><br />I'm blessed I know 
<br />Heaven sent And Heaven stole
<br />You smiled at me 
<br />Like Jesus to a child
<br /><br />And what have I learned 
<br />From all this pain
<br />I thought I'd never feel the same 
<br />About anyone
<br />Or anything again
<br /><br />But now I know 
<br />When you find love 
<br />When you know that it exists
<br />Then the lover that you miss 
<br />Will come to you on those cold, cold nights
<br /><br />When you've been loved 
<br />When you know it holds such bliss
<br />Then the lover that you kissed 
<br />Will comfort you when there's no hope in sight
<br /><br />Sadness In my eyes 
<br />No one guessed
<br />Or no one tried
<br />You smiled at me 
<br />Like Jesus to a child
<br /><br />Loveless and cold 
<br />With your last breath
<br />You saved my soul 
<br />You smiled at me
<br />Like Jesus to a child
<br /><br />And what have I learned 
<br />From all these tears
<br />I've waited for you all those years 
<br />And just when it began
<br />He took your love away
<br /><br />But I still say 
<br />When you find love
<br />When you know that it exists 
<br />Then the lover that you miss
<br />Will come to you on those cold, cold nights
<br /><br />When you've been loved 
<br />When you know it holds such bliss
<br />Then the lover that you kissed 
<br />Will comfort you when there's no hope in sight
<br /><br />So the words you could not say 
<br />I'll sing them for you
<br />And the love we would have made 
<br />I'll make it for two
<br /><br />For every single memory 
<br />Has become a part of me
<br />You will always be My love
<br /><br />Well I've been loved 
<br />So I know just what love is
<br />And the lover that I kissed
<br />Is always by my side
<br /><br />Oh the lover I still miss 
<br />Was Jesus to a child

<br />I feel all alone in a crowded room,

<br />Flashback
<br />Memories punish me again.
<br />Sometimes I remember all the pain that I have seen.
<br />Sometimes I wonder what might have been...
<br /><br />Visions of love and hate
<br />A collage behind my eyes
<br />Remnants of dying laughter
<br />Echoes of silent cries
<br /><br />And sometimes I despair
<br />At who I've become
<br />I have to come to terms
<br />With what I've done
<br /><br />The bittersweet taste of fate
<br />We can't outrun the past
<br />Destined to find an answer
<br />A strength I never lost
<br />I know there is a way,
<br />My future is not set,
<br />For the tide has turned
<br />But still I never learned to live without regret.

<br />Turnaround, Every now and then I get a
<br />little bit restless and I dream of
<br />something wild
<br />Turnaround, Every now and then I get a
<br />little bit helpless and I'm lying like a child
<br />in your arms
<br />Turnaround, Every now and then I get a
<br />little bit angry and I know I've got to get
<br />out and cry
<br />Turnaround, Every now and then I get a
<br />little bit terrified but then I see the look in
<br />you eyes
<br />Turnaround bright eyes, Every now and
<br />then I fall apart
<br />Turnaround bright eyes, Every now and
<br />then I fall apart
<br />And I need you now tonight
<br />And I need you more than ever
<br />And if you'll only hold me tight
<br />We'll be holding on forever
<br />And we'll only be making it right
<br />Cause we'll never be wrong together
<br />We can take it to the end of the line
<br />Your love is like a shadow on me all of the time
<br />I don't know what to do and I'm always in the dark
<br />We're living in a powder keg and giving off sparks
<br />I really need you tonight
<br />Forever's gonna start tonight
<br />Forever's gonna start tonight
<br />Once upon a time I was falling in love
<br />But now I'm only falling apart
<br />There's nothing I can do
<br />A total eclipse of the heart
<br />Once upon a time there was light in my life
<br />But now there's only love in the dark
<br />Nothing I can say
<br />A total eclipse of the heart
<br />[INSTRUMENTAL]
<br />Turnaround bright eyes
<br />Turnaround bright eyes
<br />Turnaround, every now and then I know
<br />you'll never be the boy you always
<br />you wanted to be
<br />Turnaround, every now and then I know
<br />you'll always be the only boy who
<br />wanted me the way that I am
<br />Turnaround, every now and then I know
<br />there's no one in the universe as
<br />magical and wonderous as you
<br />Turnaround, every now and then I know
<br />there's nothing any better and there's
<br />nothing I just wouldn't do
<br />Turnaround bright eyes, Every now and
<br />then I fall apart
<br />Turnaround bright eyes, Every now and

<br />For a miracle to come
<br />Everyone told me to be strong
<br />Hold on and don't shed a tear
<br /><br />Through the darkness and good times
<br />I knew I'd make it through
<br />And the world thought I had it all
<br />But I was waiting for you
<br /><br />Hush, now
<br /><br />I see a light in the sky
<br />Oh, it's almost blinding me
<br />I can't believe
<br />I've been touched by an angel with love
<br /><br />Let the rain come down and wash away my tears
<br />Let it fill my soul and drown my fears
<br />Let it shatter the walls for a new sun
<br /><br />A new day has... come
<br /><br />Where it was dark now there's light
<br />Where there was pain now there's joy
<br />Where there was weakness, I found my strength
<br />All in the eyes of a boy
<br /><br />Hush, now
<br /><br />I see a light in the sky
<br />Oh, it's almost blinding me
<br />I can't believe
<br />I've been touched by an angel with love
<br /><br />Let the rain come down and wash away my tears
<br />Let it fill my soul and drown my fears
<br />Let it shatter the walls for a new sun
<br /><br />A new day has...
<br /><br />Let the rain come down and wash away my tears
<br />Let it fill my soul and drown my fears
<br />Let it shatter the walls for a new sun
<br /><br />A new day has... come
<br /><br />Hush, now
<br /><br />I see a light in your eyes
<br />All in the eyes of the boy
<br /><br />I can't believe
<br />I've been touched by an angel with love
<br /><br />I can't believe
<br />I've been touched by an angel with love
