<br />charred and black the pieces fell,
<br />upon the ground where embers lay
<br />fizzled once then blew away.
<br /><br />The stench of death lay heavy on
<br />a town who prayed for early dawn,
<br />and fear like heavy curtains fell
<br />to conger stories they could tell.
<br /><br />Oh heavy sadness and lament..
<br />I wonder where the dragon went?
<br />For now the lady is no more.
<br />Will all be like it was before?
<br /><br />It is the night that silence owns,
<br />stars as bright as precious stones
<br />that brought a child,of tender years,
<br />to face the essence of her fears.
<br /><br />To stand before the terrible scene
<br />without a fiber that is mean.
<br />&quot;Oh dragonlady I am so sad,
<br />That they have treated you so bad.
<br /><br />What they said I know is true,
<br />but I would gladly fly with you..&quot;
<br />Tears fell down where she had knelt
<br />and all the sadness that she felt,
<br /><br />came up as flowers white and sweet
<br />to make a fragrant funeral wreath.
<br />And as the small child walked away
<br />she knew they&quot;d meet another day
<br /><br />Deep within the blackened sooth
<br />dreams have died and turned to smut
<br />a tiny ember stirs to life 
<br />and splits the body like a knife
<br /><br />Emerging with one great desire
<br />eyes of flame and breath of fire
<br />and shrikes to split the night in two
<br />off the dragon lady flew
<br /><br />The villagers all quake in fear
<br />wondering what happened here?
<br />Knowing its not done at all
<br />and to each day a night must fall
<br /><br />Time stands still,the night bird cries.
<br />A child watches the darkened skies
<br />with a heart so old and very wise
<br />and dreams of dragon in her eyes

<br />with withered buildings
<br />faces tucked away in shame
<br />Angry wind up in the rafters 
<br />calling out the dragon's name.
<br /><br />On winds of night 
<br />we find her coasting
<br />A ghostly apparition there
<br />A dragon's heart and soul is 
<br />naught but whispers on the air.
<br /><br />On through the night,
<br />her quest seems endless
<br />Wrapped in deaths untimely cloak
<br />Wisps of sadness and resentment
<br />Upon the air a bitter smoke.
<br /><br />Then to her sight 
<br />like cooling waters,
<br />to quell the urge of fire and rage,
<br />Among the trees she sees her running ,
<br />Child of alder birch and sage.
<br /><br />Cobweb hair
<br />that floats around her.
<br />Calm eyes like the ocean blue.
<br />Skin so pale almost transparent.
<br />A heart so innocent and true.
<br /><br />Run yea to 
<br />your house or hovel.
<br />Tarry not, for in the sky,
<br />wings of evil follow closely.
<br />So sad so young should have to die.

<br />The dragon shadows a craggy peak.
<br />Like whispers to the rocks that hide her,
<br />smoke to those whose hearts are meek.
<br /><br />Sun does not bring change or challenge,
<br />nor ruffle grass or boulders break.
<br />But it carried on the wind her anguish,
<br />and knowledge of her grave mistake.
<br /><br />Spirits  have no homes or castles.
<br />They have no gardens,or bed so soft.
<br />No night bird resting on their shoulders,
<br />to carry all their dreams aloft.
<br /><br />She is gone,and she was the fairest.
<br />No more lives the dragon's name.
<br />Tears were cried but not enough tears.
<br />Not enough to douse the flame.
<br /><br />And so they burned her without pity.
<br />They watched her fall like tainted snow.
<br />But still the dragon heart grew stronger,
<br />stronger than you'll ever know.
<br /><br />As they danced macabre and mindless .
<br />Twisted shadows,and bent desires.
<br />A voice called out to Dragonlady
<br />and could be heard above the fires
<br /><br />&quot;Dance you evil sons of anguish&quot;
<br />The day will come ,you will fall apart.
<br />But Dragonlady will live on for ever.
<br />As a fiery drive within my heart.

<br />evil ferns and fungus grow.
<br />Shadows run from other shadows
<br />through the burnt and yellow snow.
<br /><br />Among the twisted trees of winter,
<br />sits a hovel all forlorn
<br />Windows stare with sad abandon
<br />on that cold forsaken morn.
<br /><br />A mother sings her song of comfort,
<br />wiping bitter tears away.
<br />Holding on to better memories ,
<br />memories of a better day.
<br /><br />A little child so full of promise.
<br />watch her dance, and hear her sing.
<br />Gifted with the blood of seers,
<br />fathered by a would be king.
<br /><br />And the mother called her Dragon.
<br />Freedom on the dragon's wings.
<br />But they were banished to the forest,
<br />for sad mistakes and other things.
<br /><br />'Dragon, Dragon,my heart is breaking.
<br />How can I live without you there?
<br />And she moaned and wept for hours
<br />pulling out her graying hair.
<br /><br />In the corner by the fire,
<br />a small child sits in silent pain.
<br />as the mothers smile she cherished ,
<br />washed away like summer rain.
<br /><br />&quot;Mother I have seen the fire,
<br />my heart says dragons never die.
<br />Please don't cry for Dragonlady,
<br />She lives for ever in the sky.
<br /><br />And the mother took her small hand,
<br />seen some strange and awful things,
<br />seen a heart so full of passion,
<br />lifted high on dragon's wings.

<br />and the day began a new.
<br />Birds of joy were singing sweetly,
<br />the morning sky was endless blue.
<br /><br />But a king whose crown was heavy,
<br />heart was restless and with doom,
<br />wanders in his sad confusion,
<br />aimlessly about his room.
<br /><br />&quot;Why is it that I feel such sorrow?
<br />Who walks so heavy on my grave?
<br />Must I guess all who I've forsaken,
<br />who is it  I did not wish to save?
<br /><br />First my children cold and lifeless,
<br />then my wife who pines away,
<br />then my people...do they fear me,
<br />jumping at each thing I say.
<br /><br />Love is black and all consuming,
<br />in what frame we choose to speak.
<br />I feel such loss and love has left me,
<br />loss of love for whom I seek.&quot;
<br /><br />Love was not the sword that slew him,
<br />fear and sadness cuts so deep.
<br />Some where in the dragon shadows,
<br />memories collect to weep.

<br />In my dreams I seen her fly.
<br />And the lady of the shadows,
<br />in bitterness I hear her cry.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;And it called me from my slumber,
<br />and I walked for many hours,
<br />to a valley,where at sunset,
<br />evil wilted all the flowers.
<br /><br />And I seen the lady fairest,
<br />tied so tight and left to burn.&quot;
<br />And the mother hushed her daughter.
<br />&quot;You have so much left to learn.&quot;
<br /><br />'I have cried and cried my heart out.
<br />Hush now wizard child I know.
<br />Stay beside me by the fire
<br />There are things you do not know.
<br /><br />She is a lady and a dragon,
<br />fierce and beautiful to see.
<br />And she slew and tore down castles,
<br />needing always to be free.
<br /><br />And I bore her like a burden,
<br />into the woods protective arms.
<br />And the forest kept my secret,
<br />The dragon child and all her charms.
<br /><br />A sister kin ,and a sad relation,
<br />Your blood and hers they run as one.
<br />Hearts alike and yet so different
<br />My heart the moon ,my heart the sun
<br /><br />And the small child smiled in sadness.
<br />loosing what she never knew,
<br />made her treasure even more so,
<br />a sister spirit wild and true.

<br />Spread your wings of peace and joy.
<br />But royal wings were draped in sorrow,
<br />and there was no solace in the sky.
<br /><br />Something in his past was calling.
<br />Some one reached beyond the realm.
<br />and like a ship he returned skyward,
<br />a mighty captain at the helm.
<br /><br />She who sees and pulls his heart,
<br />the mother of his dragon child.
<br />A siren song of need and anguish,
<br />over oceans rough and wild.
<br /><br />So he flew to heed her calling,
<br />through the barrier of light,
<br />into the cold white snows of winter,
<br />a dark and biting frosty night.
<br /><br />Over white ice laden castles,
<br />over hovels hid in snow.
<br />To the town of Destination,
<br />Where his heart led him to go.
<br /><br />To the forest dark and deadly,
<br />where he first met with desire.
<br />There above the moaning tree tops
<br />dread has set his soul on fire.
<br /><br />There below, among the snow drifts,
<br />He sees her waiting like before.
<br />But there is no joy or laughter,
<br />Just a funeral wreath upon the door.
<br /><br />&quot;I have come ,oh woman seer.
<br />Tell my heart of what I dread.
<br />Tell me life has changed for ever ...
<br />Tell me that my child is dead..&quot;

<br />into my soul no joy can pass.
<br />My child of fire and deeds of evil,
<br />has moved beyond the lowly class.
<br /><br />You had left behind a flower
<br />fire has burned it to the ground.
<br />And no hope rises from the ashes,
<br />only heartbreak can be found.
<br /><br />Fold your wings oh mighty dragon
<br />You have no reign upon this night.
<br />Only tears can fall between us
<br />and wings and scales before the light.
<br /><br />Before you are just man and only.
<br />before you walk as others thread
<br />Pride be not the winds that bring you,
<br />news of that the dragons dead.
<br /><br />No more castles fold beneath her,
<br />No more bodies flung which way,
<br />no more running ,no more screaming,
<br />Dragonladys dead this day...
<br /><br />Fly you back unto your castle.
<br />You are why my poor heart bleeds.
<br />A rose with thorns ,you have gave me ..
<br />sadly lost before it seeds.

<br />and watched the wretched dragon go.
<br />His heart so broke,his soul so crushed.
<br />The night was still the night owl hushed.
<br /><br />She wiped her tears upon her sleeve.
<br />For this was not the time to grieve.
<br />Her mind was set,her logic red,
<br />to wake the small child from her bed.
<br /><br />And take her to the source of pain,
<br />and pray she make it good again.
<br />With talents sharp,and abilities,
<br />It would carry them above the trees.
<br /><br />And if the child was old enough,
<br />then she could call the wizard's bluff.
<br />To bless the child,and break his hold
<br />and allow her gifts to save a soul.
<br /><br />&quot;Wake up and come ,oh child of mine.
<br />Ti's cold out side but we'll do fine.
<br />Our hearts are pure, our souls at rest,

<br />we have a ways to go tonight.
<br />For Destination's evil streets,
<br />that house the murderers and cheats,
<br />will give beneath our heavy step
<br />and open doors to secrets kept
<br />to show it's vile corrupting bile
<br />it's inner works of sad denial.
<br /><br />Here a wizard old and mean,
<br />once was married to a queen.
<br />And all the good their hearts had not,
<br />it seemed their son some how had got.
<br />The kindest touch was his to give,
<br />to love at life and love to live.
<br />And every girl would swoon and sway,
<br />when the young man walked her way.
<br /><br />A young girls heart was given then,
<br />and plans were made to meet again.
<br />But faith would sadly intervene,
<br />and in a storm so cold and mean,
<br />real love fell out of the sky,
<br />The young girl never questioned why.
<br />She fell under his dragon charms
<br />and gladly fell into his arms.
<br /><br />No love so fierce had ever been.
<br />But her village cried she was in sin.
<br />They chased the dragon far away,
<br />and that is where he is today.
<br />For love the young girl suffered much,
<br />but there was a part they could not touch.
<br />A young girls love,and a dragon wild.
<br />and a little baby dragon child.

<br />No child born to a father should

<br />who reminded him of his own son.

<br />and in that forest of despair,
<br />a child was born with golden hair.&quot;
<br /><br />The wizard he drew closer then.
<br />looked at the child once and again
<br />One day ago in morning sun,
<br />the blue eyes of his favorite son.
<br /><br />&quot;Oh evil woman how could you sin
<br />what hexes have you cast on him?
<br />to bring this child into my home..
<br />a bastard child that's yours alone.

<br />.
<br /><br />The daughter reached her hands out.
<br />and she placed the book there in
<br />The power was where it belonged
<br />in a heart so free from sin.

<br />is burnt upon the rocks.
<br />The years of bitter attitude
<br />like wild electric shocks
<br /><br />Have spread upon the valley
<br />and singed the anxious trees
<br />and quelled the song of dieing
<br />like a freezing winter breeze
<br /><br />In a town that's known for evil.
<br />Where the wizard now resides
<br />Behind his locks and latches
<br />there a bitter old man hides.
<br /><br />But the power of the dragon
<br />casts its shadow by the door.
<br />he seen it near his table
<br />stretching out across his floor.
<br /><br />and the dragon was his shadow
<br />as he walked across the room
<br />never leaving for a second
<br />in the cold grey light of gloom
<br /><br />Dragon I have been your master
<br />in this war that we have fought
<br />I have triumph ore your powers
<br />and the life that you have not.
<br /><br />You are not the fear of many
<br />only the dead will sing your name
<br />your sister struggles fruitlessly
<br />and your mother does the same.
<br /><br />Her connection to the living world
<br />started fading and grew dim
<br />she knew he spoke the truth for once
<br />and she felt no thanks to him

<br />my eyes will shed no tear 
<br />Death is  an obstacle
<br />and I will show no fear.
<br /><br />I must go to the darkness
<br />the lost souls linger there
<br />in that sad forsaken place
<br />to  find a heart so rare.
<br /><br />Hurt has stole away her joy
<br />and pain has warp her soul
<br />a heart so pure and loving
<br />survives and remain whole
<br /><br />Her mothers eyes were shaded 
<br />her daughter could not see
<br />the place that she was going,
<br />where she did not want to be.
<br /><br />The book of spells lay open
<br />the power was in her hands
<br />she cried to God to help her 
<br />to thwart its evil plans
<br /><br />to the darkness she was cast
<br />Her golden tresses shorn
<br />before the sun rose again
<br />a sorceress was born

<br />that was drawn on the floor.
<br />Many souls would travel here
<br />and many had gone before.
<br /><br />Twisted words upon the page
<br />was branded in her mind
<br />A cloud of smoke and thunder
<br />she left the world behind
<br /><br />Across the burning threshold
<br />of black decaying ice
<br />she called out to the guardian
<br />with power in her voice
<br /><br />I  come to fight the shadows
<br />I am armed with words of steel
<br />A sister heart is here within
<br />I know because I feel.
<br /><br />I know, I feel her presence 
<br />and I follow right along
<br />She guides me in the darkness
<br />with a voice just like a song.
<br /><br />this place that sees no sunlight
<br />only death and deep despair.
<br />she stood without her mother 
<br />and she stood without her hair.
<br /><br />And the darkness was a shadow
<br />and the shadow was a man
<br />they blended in together
<br />till the colors bled and ran.
<br /><br />His smile was like the autumn
<br />painting colors on the leaves
<br />and for a single moment
<br />she had struggled to believe

<br />its sap is blood and it runs free.
<br />Its roots are arms still reaching down
<br />and hearts are weeping ..underground
<br /><br />Where is the fear,where are the tears
<br />and with no hands, over your ears
<br />I have no time for  bravery
<br />lest you should die and be left to me
<br /><br />Stories and tales, stories and tales
<br />blown like the winters cold cutting gales
<br />What must I do ,and where must I go
<br />Tell me something I don't already know
<br /><br />What can you give me,girl without hair
<br />What can you part with, almost as fair
<br />Your eyes are like jewels blue as the sea
<br />Yes,I will guide you, give them to me
<br /><br />What will I see when my sister is found
<br />memories of blood all over the ground
<br />walls of decay and a ceiling of dread
<br />If I cant see her smile,I will also be dead
<br /><br />Lady of sorcery,and child of the light
<br />what bitter a deal do you peak my delight?
<br />I bend like a tree, I break like an oak
<br />Here in Death's chambers your life is a joke.
