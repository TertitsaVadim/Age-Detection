Ask the ‘Dilliwallahs’ &amp; they will tell you that love has found its zone in the congested environs of the Delhi Metro.It has become a new hot spot for all the singles in Delhi.
<br /><br />Love-in-a-metro
<br />This is a love story of a 21-year old Delhi University student, Mreenal Garg , who is in the final year and has been commuting via metro from the West to North of Delhi ( her college ) for almost 3 years. She reveals that travelling all alone does make the journey full of boredom. The only way to kill her time was to look around the people, hear their conversations &amp; then make her own silent judgement. But little did she know that she was also one of the spectators for a decent looking guy, un-noticed by her, who constantly stared at her till the time she got down at Rajiv Chowk for the next train.
<br />A week later, she spotted one guy in the same compartment, whom she found really cute. She kept on staring at him and after a while, the guy looked at her and passed a smile. She couldn’t resist but to return the favour. Next day, she saw the same guy boarding the train. She was wondering how come she did not notice him all this while. This time the guy was standing right behind her. She wanted to look back but somehow couldn’t gather her guts to do so. But she was well aware that the guy was staring at her. The incident got repeated for couple of more days. She realised that may be she has started liking him. But she had no clue how to approach him.
<br />One day fine day, she was waiting for the metro to arrive. In the midst of the crowd, she smelled the same perfume. Yes, it was him. The train arrived &amp; this time they boarded the train together and managed to find a sit. Feeling a bit shy sitting next to him for the first time and finding her ways to initiate a conversation was frustrating but it also felt amusing at the same time. The train was moving at its usual pace to reach the destination where they had to part their ways. But this time destiny had some other plans in stored for them.
<br />Before reaching the station the guy gently dropped a letter on her lap. Mreenal took a look around and opened the letter. She was awestruck as she kept on reading it. He mentioned that he was the same guy who was travelling with her in the same compartment for over a year but she never noticed him. He fall in love with her the very day he saw her, but couldn’t find means to express his feelings. He also wrote that how he was happy that his prayers came true after a year and they started having those blissful encounters off-late. She couldn’t believe what was written but she was overwhelmed by the fact that the guy had same feelings for her too. In return, she wrote her mobile number in the letter and gave it back to him.
<br />Today they are dating each other. She confesses that he is the best thing that has ever happened to her life. Her message to all the youngsters – “All you singles in Delhi looking for love, Delhi Metro is veritable cupid land. Go try your luck!”

If the answer is YES, then It is obvious that due to your hectic schedule you might hardly get any time to socialize.Spending 40 hours a week at work, itself is an indicator that you might get involved with someone at your work place.
<br />Dating an office colleague is tempting as it will provide you with some respite from the monotony of the job. But it has its implications.
<br /><br />Dating at office
<br />Office dating- Pros
<br />One of the biggest advantages is time efficiency. Since you no longer need to spend time searching for someone after your work who can accompany you in the evening, it saves both your time &amp; money.Now you have an option.
<br />Second advantage of office dating is you already have a fair idea of what your partner is like. So you hit off instantly.
<br />A final advantage is the maturity level, meaning when both the partners have a right set of mind, then it avoids several misunderstandings leading to a stronger foundation of a healthy relationship.
<br />Office dating- Cons
<br />Dating someone at office means that the person is in front of your eyes every day, most of the time. This might cause a little friction &amp; can lead to boredom in the relationship.
<br />Office dating results in distraction, thus, hampering one’s abilities to perform their regular tasks, and ultimately not able to deliver their best.
<br />The biggest disadvantage is if things doesn’t work out, then the same work place becomes very awkward for you. Daily encounter with that person might disturb you mentally. So be prepared for such unwanted situations.
<br />Finally, one can come to a conclusion that office dating has its positive &amp; negative shades. So be smart, analyse the situation &amp; then take the right decision, before you think you of dating someone in the workplace.

While many choose to ignore the importance of this day but little that we know that this day used to hold a special significance in the past.
<br /><br />Rarest But Perfect
<br /><br />I am sure many of you must have had an excellent date on Valentine’s Day. So, who took the giant step of arranging for a date &amp; then finally bending on your knees expressing your partner what you feel? Needless to say, that the romantic ritual till date is mostly performed by men.Though women in the modern times are free spirited &amp; very expressive by nature but they expect their partners to initiate.This is again very natural &amp; something which has not changed for centuries.
<br />But you know history has also something else to say. This rare date was chosen by women to propose to men they wanted to marry. The story goes back to an agreement between St. Patrick and St. Bridget in the fifth century, where St.Bridget on behalf of all the women petitioned St.Patrick that they have all the rights of choosing their husbands. As a result, women were allowed to propose to men every 4 years. There is also a myth that men rejecting such proposals were subjected to large fines.
<br />Thereby co-relating the history with modern era, this post carries a special message for all the women who have no clue about how to approach the one you love- GO ahead &amp; convey your feelings before its too late. If at all you were waiting for one BIG day, today is the DAY to create a history. All I mean to say is, just follow your heart &amp; don’t let this opportunity go away because this is the perfect day to start dating with men. So, All the best!

But finding the right partner isn’t that easy.What complicates the situation most is that we ourselves are not very clear about what we are looking out for when we are seeking for the “right one” in our life.So it is imperative to chalk out the key elements that describe us &amp; the partner, whom we would want to attract in our lives.
<br />By following the steps that your Agony Aunt recommends, I am hopeful that you will take a step closer to finding your dream partner.
<br /><br />Dream Partner
<br />Attributes
<br />Take a pen &amp; a piece of paper &amp; start writing the key attributes that you think your partner MUST have.For instance, I want my partner to be loving, caring, beautiful &amp; the list goes on.Do make a note that the attributes that you list, are the most important ones &amp; are irreplaceable.This will help you get a clarity on the kind of partner that you covet.
<br />Physical Characteristics
<br />Do physical characteristics matter to you? Well of course they do.Long or short hair, cute smile, height etc are some of the important characteristics that should be considered.
<br />Lifestyle 
<br />If you like to spend more time at home then there is no point of having someone who likes partying every night.There might be times when you would like to have a candle light dinner at home but your partner would want to go to an expensive restaurant. Would you be hurt? Yes, may be.You might end up feeling that the person does not care enough about your emotions and wishes. What I am trying to highlight, is that, the kind of life your partner leads may differ from yours which eventually might lead to difference of opinion, taking a toll on you. So, now you know, why both of your lifestyles should also match to a greater extent.
<br />Qualifications
<br />What kind of education do you think your partner should have? Do you want some one who is from the field of arts, music or working in a corporate.Try to answer these questions to yourself &amp; find out.

Instead of common rock materials, all the mountains are made up of diamond. You think the author is not in senses? but yes, scientists have found such planet in the universe that is completely made of the diamond.
<br /><br />A diamond planet, commonly known as a Carbon planet or Carbide planet, was first theoretically proposed by Marc Kuchner, an American astrophysicist at NASA. Like carbon planets, he also worked on ocean planets and Helium planets and made some storng observations.
<br /><br />What is the phenomenon behind Diamond planet:
<br /><br />This amazing planet is made up of dead stars orbitting around a pulsar. Pulsars are also made up of dead neutron stars of about 20 kilometers in diameter, highly magnetized and rotating very fastly. They also emits high beam of radiation. There is a large amount of carbon on such planets and oxygen may also be found there while most of the planets are usually made up of silicon-oxygen compounds. They are very much close to a pulsar rotates more than 10,000 times per minute. Their density is much high because of which it is believed that the carbon must be crystalline and there is a vast amount of diamonds on the planet.
<br /><br />The Only Discovered Diamond Planet:
<br /><br />PSR J1719-1438 b, a planet discovered on 25th August 2011, lying about 4000 light years away of our earth could possibly be diamond planet. According to the examinations the planet’s mass is about five to fifteen times greater than the earth. The planet could have more than 50% of diamond that exist in our galaxy. This planet may also have volcanoes, and during eruptions they may release diamond instead of Lava.

<br /><br />Although the temperature in space is as low as freezing but there is also direct radioactive rays from sun that makes the environment of space very interesting and amazing. what really happens to human body and other masses in space? Lets have a look on it.
<br /><br />What will happen to Humans in Space:
<br /><br />Although the mixed environment of space is risky for Humans but they won’t be freeze because the heat of the body will not be transferred away from it.
<br /><br />Humans may also experience vomiting, headache and malaise due to motion sickness in space because they are totally weightless there.
<br /><br />If someone put off his helmet in space he would just remain conscious for a couple of seconds because there is no oxygen in space and when his blood without oxygen reaches his brain that will lead him to death.
<br /><br />What will happen to water in Space:
<br /><br />If you throw some water in outer space, first it will be boiled immediately because of the radiation known as Cosmic Microwave Background and than it will be frozen within a couple of seconds. While the boiled water will release vapor droplets, so these droplets will be converted into ice crystals.
<br /><br />All other liquid elements e-g mercury, shall form themselves into a sphere.

By the Way how many of you have witnessed the most recent Solar Eclipse which occurred yesterday on May 20, 2012? Have you ever thought how this rare phenomenon occurs? Let us put some light on it.
<br /><br />What is Solar Eclipse:
<br /><br />A solar eclipse occurs when the moon comes between the earth and sun while revolving, and blocks the sun partially or fully. It occurs only on new moon and it blocks the light of sun to reach the earth. In fact, the moon and the sun are in conjunction as seen from the earth so the sun is completely invisible. The moon does not have its own light because it relies on Sun’s light reflected by earth, so it becomes dark during this whole process.
<br /><br />Eclipse types
<br /><br />Total Eclipse: When the sun is completely hidden behind the moon leaving a solar corona behind that is visible to naked eye.
<br /><br />Image credit: Flickr maaco
<br />Annular Eclipse: When the sun and the moon are in line but size of the moon is a bit smaller than the sun so it forms a bright ring around the sun.
<br /><br />Hybrid Eclipse: In fact, it is a combination of annular and total eclipse because at some specific points on earth it’s been observed as annular eclipse while on other points it is observed as the total eclipse.
<br /><br />Partial Eclipse: When the sun and the moon are not exactly in line and the Sun is partially hidden behind the Moon. This is the most observed type of Solar eclipse as it is witnessed in many areas even during the total and annular eclipses.
<br /><br />And now some amazing facts about the Solar Eclipse that one must know.
<br /><br />1) During a total Solar Eclipse, the temperature of the places where it is being witnessed, can be dropped by 20 degrees are more.
<br /><br />2) North Pole and South Pole are the only places where the Total Solar Eclipse cannot be observed but the partial solar eclipse.
<br /><br />3) The longest recorded duration of a total solar eclipse is about 7.5 minutes.
<br /><br />4) Annually, minimum 2 and maximum 5 solar eclipses can be observed on the Earth.
<br /><br />5) According to many astronomers, the time during the Eclipse period is considered inauspicious and they ask people to not to take baths, lunch and sleep during the eclipse.
<br /><br />Note: According to NASA, one should not look at any sort of partial or total eclipse without some proper techniques and equipments because it can result in retinal burn and the victim may loss eye sight permanently.

Okay, tell me how many of you or your friends ever witnessed a UFO or an alien like man? Do you remember the famous Star Trek Series? Who was your most favorite character?
<br /><br />Well guys, today’s post is dedicated to world’s most asked question i.e does aliens and UFOs exist or not? So, here we go.
<br /><br />Aliens and UFOs
<br />There are many studies conducted around the world on the existence of Aliens and UFOs (Unidentified Flying Objects). Human beings are always curious to know if there is any life beyond planet earth, or earth is the only planet holding life in the entire galaxy. As such, the existence of Aliens and UFOs has always been a debatable subject. This subject has found favor with many film makers and authors and the many movies made and books written (depicting aliens and UFOs) are a testament to this fact.
<br /><br />Several people claim to have seen aliens and likewise there have been many instances of UFO sightings in different parts of the world. The etchings found on walls of caves related to aliens resemble with the description provided by witnesses who claimed to have seen them.
<br /><br />Former NASA astronaut Edgar Mitchell who was part of the 1971 Apollo 14 moon mission has claimed in a talk to the fifth annual X-Conference around existence of UFOs. He has supported the fact that – we are not alone and we are visited by aliens.
<br /><br />UFO Witnesses:

<br />Corona, New Mexico
<br /><br />July 1947
<br /><br />A huge thunderstorm filled the night sky after a hot and humid afternoon. This whole event was witnessed by sheep farmer Mac Brazel. He heard bizarre sound which was extremely loud and appeared as a crash sound. The next day in the morning he found his land was covered with debris which was unusual in appearance.
<br /><br />This debris was later submitted to Roswell N M authorities. A press statement was released by Roswell Air Force base that they had a ‘Flying Disc/UFO’ in its possession. All the debris was removed and was taken to Air Force Headquarters in Ft. Worth, Texas Further, there was news related to Roswell Air Force base ordering four small sized hermetically sealed coffins which carried aliens after autopsy was performed over them.
<br /><br />The nurse who disclosed this secret was later transferred from the base. Many people reported to have witnessed the UFO wreckage and alien bodies. The wreckage and alien bodies were stored at Roswell temporarily and later were flown to Wright-Patterson field in Ohio.
<br /><br />The debate regarding aliens and UFOS existence will continue until there is solid evidence to prove their existence.  As we are building ships to discover the galaxy and explore the unknown maybe the other part of universe is also trying to contact us ….we have to just wait and watch to get the answer to this unanswered question – Aliens and UFOs ..do they exist?

<br /><br />Conversely, I guess, those without the courage to take hold of happiness are doomed to be miserable.
<br /><br />If I have learned one thing in the past nearly-a-year of writing about happiness, it’s that happiness is hard work. (If I’ve learned a second thing, it’s that it’s useless to actually work toward happiness. Which leads to a third thing: that virtually everything we say about happiness is paradoxical.)
<br /><br />Anyway, it’s true that happiness is available only to those who have the courage to take hold of it. Some of my friends (and I myself, when I was single) plan their own birthday parties. If no one else does it, why not? It’s a bold, and to some, self-serving, move. And yet, if it makes you happy, why not?
<br /><br />So grow some cojones. Have some nerve. Be bold and seize some happiness.
<br /><br />You’ll be happier.

<br /><br />So why wouldn’t the same be true of happiness?
<br /><br />No less an expert than Sigmund Freud said, “Just as a cautious businessman avoids investing all his capital in one concern, so wisdom would probably admonish us also not to anticipate all our happiness from one quarter alone.”
<br /><br />If there’s someone (or something) in your life that constitutes your “everything,” you run the risk of severe unhappiness in the case of loss. Think of it this way: As happy as that person or thing makes you, whatever heights you rise to, that’s how low you’ll go if you ever suffer a loss.
<br /><br />So spread those eggs around. Find multiple sources for the happiness in your life. Start a hobby, get a pet, create something, find a special place. But don’t let all your happiness come from one source.
<br /><br />Diversify. You’ll be happier.

		<document id="d6389cb5956738c63ef3f5e702ecf68b" url=""><![CDATA[Cultivate Mindfulness<br/><br/>As we come near the end of our 365 (this is number 361), I have been emphasizing a few points that have run through the series. Now I want to end with a “definitive” (ahem) list. Let’s call them “The Five Cultivates” (a naming convention borrowed from China, where I live).
<br /><br />The first one is: Cultivate Mindfulness.
<br /><br />Be mindful of the people around you, of the places where you spend time, of the way you live your life.
<br /><br />Which ones are making you happy? Which ones are making you not so?
<br /><br />Be mindful of your attitudes, towards things, towards people, towards life itself.
<br /><br />What mental furniture makes you the happiest?
<br /><br />In short, pay attention.
<br /><br />Socrates said it: “The unexamined life is not worth living.” I think he was talking about being mindful.
<br /><br />So there’s Number One: Cultivate Mindfulness. And you’ll be happier

		<document id="5ed9c4fa20c92cb383e39751ae4b3960" url=""><![CDATA[Cultivate Compassion<br/><br/>Here’s the second in our series of “The Five Cultivates”: Cultivate Compassion.
<br /><br />This word “compassion” is widely misunderstood. It’s often thought to mean merely “pity” or “kindness.”
<br /><br />It is so much more.
<br /><br />At its highest cultivation, compassion becomes an identity with those who are suffering. Lest you think this is some high-falutin’ Buddhist idea, just remember the words of John Donne:
<br /><br />Any man’s death diminishes me, because I am involved in mankind and therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls it tolls for thee.
<br /><br />When one suffers, we all suffer.
<br /><br />So for pity’s sake (!) Cultivate Compassion. You (and all sentient beings) will be happier.

		<document id="d4ad1f409afefed765983e7a0a79827e" url=""><![CDATA[Cultivate Gratefulness<br/><br/>The third of our “Five Cultivates” is Cultivate Gratefulness.
<br /><br />Yes, I’ve written about this before, but as we’re in the Final Five, it bears repeating: The key to abundance, and therefore happiness, is to be grateful for everything you get. You may or may not get more as a result of this attitude; but if you’re truly grateful for what you have, who needs more?
<br /><br />I am what is known amongst English speakers in Asia as “a templer,” one who visits temples (Buddhist, Daoist, etc.) fanatically.
<br /><br />When I visit, I “pray.” When asked the gist of my “prayers,” I can sum them up in two words: “Thank you.”
<br /><br />Thank who? Whoever’s listening. It’s not the “receiver” that’s important in giving thanks, it’s the heart of the sender, the position of acknowledging our dependence on others, on the universe.
<br /><br />So give thanks. Be appreciative. Cultivate Gratefulness. Your life will be fuller and richer for it, and, yes, you’ll be happier.

		<document id="4d2bae650608b63dcb147165b5abb627" url=""><![CDATA[Cultivate Peace<br/><br/>This brings us to the fourth of our “Five Cultivates,” Cultivate Peace.
<br /><br />In many ways, peace is both the end and the means of our quest. What I have been calling “happiness” for nearly a year is really a sense of peace, or well-being. It is a lack of turmoil, tsuris,dukkha.
<br /><br />And how do we attain it? We start with it. We end with it. Borrowing and adapting from a couple of traditions, let us say:
<br /><br />Peace before me
<br />Peace behind me
<br />Peace above me and under my feet
<br />Peace within me
<br />Peace around me, and in all whom I meet.
<br /><br />With peace may I walk.
<br />With peace before me, may I walk.
<br />With peace behind me, may I walk.
<br />With peace above me, may I walk.
<br />With peace below me, may I walk.
<br />With peace all around me, may I walk.
<br /><br />It is finished in peace.
<br />It is finished in peace.
<br /><br />Cultivate Peace, and you’ll be happier.

<br /><br />It seems the happiest people I know can whoop it up with friends on Saturday night and attend church with great conviction on Sunday.
<br /><br />They can chat with equal amiability with college professors and construction workers, with police officers and prostitutes, with ministers and mine workers.
<br /><br />They can have fun in a disco or on a mountain trail, can be at peace in traffic or in tranquility.
<br /><br />They are all things to all people.
<br /><br />They are, as the Tao recommends, as soft and yielding as water, yet, as it also says, their strength has no equal.
<br /><br />Anyone who sounds one note might not fit the bill.
<br /><br />And yet, in all these situations, happy people are always themselves, never sacrificing who they are for the sake of others.
<br /><br />They contain multitudes.
