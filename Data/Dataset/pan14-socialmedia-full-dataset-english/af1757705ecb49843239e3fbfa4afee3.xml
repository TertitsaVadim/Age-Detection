Unfortunately, the L100 is one of them and it's really quite unnecessary. Even the most basic digitial cameras have ISO change in the menu but not the L100.<br /><br />The noise test proved interesting as I had to lower the amount of light in the room to force the ISO higher. I only managed to get four readings of ISO102, ISO211, ISO400 and bizarrely, ISO2438. Unbelievably specific values to allow the camera to use.<br /><br />As expected, ISO100 is a nicely detailed image although I'm sorry to say that noise is coming through on the grey area at this level. Disappointingly, ISO211 has aggressive noise for such a low setting with white flecks littering the area and coloured blobs settling in for the night.<br /><br />Luckily there's not a great deal of difference between ISO211 and ISO400 but the bump up to the top setting of ISO2438 has lost all detail in the petals, reduced the resolution and makes you think you're looking at a television screen.<br />There are three modes to take advantage of in the drive mode although one of them isn't technically a continuous shooting mode. Continuous mode takes five shots in ten seconds giving it a rating of 0.5fps (frames per second) which isn't the best but the camera is capable of up to 13fps. BSS stands for Best Shot Selector and works by taking several images and choosing the best one from the bunch. Not really continuous shooting as it doesn't record all images but uses the feature in its execution.<br /><br />Finally, you can choose multi-16 which takes 16 small thumbnail shots and places them all on one image. I've often thought about what benefit this mode could have and I can only come up with it being a handy option for making a zoetrope.<br /><br />I flicked the camera into sports mode to see if I could find the 13fps mode and it seems that this could be the one. It managed to take 31 images in just over three seconds which is actually a little under 13fps but I'm testing the camera in more realistic terms and not a laboratory.<br /><br />Looking at the colour test chart image, I really like the colours with blue punching its way out and there's a decent result from the the other colours as well. Red is a little muted but not unappealing and the skin tone tile looks nice so I can't wait for the portrait shots. Earth brown and forest green are rich and there's some noticeable colour coming through from the pastel tiles down the left side of the brown, orange and blue tiles. These can often be bleached out so it's good to see the Nikon picking them out.<br /><br />I like the portrait image as it's given a balanced skin tone and a decent white balance result. Using auto flash wouldn't get a response as Nikon seem to prefer upping the ISO at the moment so I forced the flash and it didn't do anything to try and amend the power. A harsh reflection has appeared on the forehead and the whole image is over exposed. <br /><br />Review:<br />I'm not a big fan of cameras that don't allow much scope for creativity but I found myself really liking the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nikoncoolpixl100.net"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.nikoncoolpixl100.net</a>. Sure it has its problems such as no ISO adjustment, having trouble with macro and that I couldn't just press the shutter button to get out of the menu but had to backtrack out of it before I was allowed to take a picture. The flash also needs addressing when forced flash is selected or some good pictures could potentially be ruined.<br /><br />If you've always wanted a bridge camera but couldn't afford it or you didn't like the look of all those pesky buttons and switches, this could be your ideal camera.

Our society makes so many things from plastic that it’s hard to imagine what our lives would be like if plastic was never invented. The versatility of plastic is what allows it to be used in everything from car parts to shopping bags and from insulation to vinyl siding and windows that help cut energy consumption and lower your utility bills. From the car you drive to the house you live in, plastics help make your life much easier and ultimately better.<br /><br />Plastic materials and products also play a vital part in cutting-edge technologies. For example, plastics are used in various places throughout the space program, Medical Equipment, Industry;Farm;Household appliance;and Military fields,They played an important role in our Daily life. It is obvious that plastic has literally become the cornerstone of our society. With so many of our everyday products being made of plastic, it is easy to understand why the plastic injection molding industry is so important to various businesses and consumers.<br /><br />If your company or business relies on plastic products or parts that require custom moldings and is looking for something that will give you the cutting-edge over your competitors, consider plastic injection molding. A large amount of all plastic products and materials are produced using this process, and more specifically the process of custom injection molding.<br /><br />Does <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.pmolds.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.pmolds.com</a> Measure Up?As with any process, there are both advantages and disadvantages associated with plastic injection molding. However, the number of advantages far outweighs the number of disadvantages for almost all companies that are considering injection molding. The advantages include being able to keep the production rapid and efficient, being able to replicate a large number of the products being produced, and being able to lower the labor costs. The decrease in cost stems from the machinery that handles and completes a majority of the work and the precision of the process that lowers the scrap costs because of plastic injection molding accuracy.<br /><br />On the other hand, there are some disadvantages that affect smaller companies. When these companies want to use plastic injection molding as a means to produce parts, the equipment needed to accomplish the task is expensive and causes the operating costs to skyrocket. In these kinds of situations, the financial burden may outweigh the benefits of using plastic injection molding. However, there are businesses that specialize in custom plastic injection molding. They will be able to create the mold with complete exactness. The customer is given the mold along with an estimated cost for the entire job.<br /><br />Plastic Injection Molding offers Answers.So why is it that plastic <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.pmolds.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.pmolds.com</a> has become so widely used by companies? The answer is simply that it can provide the products your business needs to prosper and the products your customers need and want.

That kind of mechanism for plastic is quite expensive and very complicated. Even the machines involved costs a great deal. Known as injection molding, the machines are solid, and some even weigh a kilo tones.<br /><br />However, it is only when these machines are used properly, when in the final product turns out to be of high quality. The machines have high temperatures and have the capability to deal with complex systems. Plastic is introduced into the machine and heated until it becomes liquid and then injected for the final products.<br /><br />The plastic varieties used for the process of plastic injection molding are usually thermoplastics. Some thermoplastics used are nylon, polyethylene, polystyrene and rubber, and Bakelite. Sometimes a highly elastic polymer is also used, which is known as an elastomer.<br /><br />This consists of two elements, namely, the injection unit and clamping unit. Do not forget that the processes involved are to be carried out in a systematic manner. This starts with the first injection of plastics and polymers. The resin is heated to the melting temperature and the liquid is poured into the shape of the desired shape. The forms consist of two components, injection molding and mold removal. The molten plastic resin is poured into the mold with injection molding base. The removal of the mold used to push the plastic after it solidifies in the mold without damaging the screw around.<br /><br />The next step in this is to use a mechanical or hydraulic pressure. This is to allow air to escape into the mold. This is called building process. Therefore, you can put pressure air cavities in the mold corner moves. Then, the liquid can be cooled and solidified to form. Finally, the plastic solidifies in the mold is removed manually or automatically. CNC Plastic Machining is also used in the plastic machining industry these days for their automated and speedy services.<br /><br />After cooling, there is often a change in mechanical properties, physical and chemical properties of the plastic machining part. The thickness of the mold is one of the key design considerations for <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.pmolds.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.pmolds.com</a> . In general, a shape with a uniform thickness is preferred. Thus, we can say that plastic injection molding changes the mechanical properties of the plastic part. You can avail the services of a good service provider online that also has tight tolerance machining services to get quality products.<br /><br />Injection molding service in china is now very tough, now more and more countries are moving their injection molding to china, because the lower labor cost and other molding cost. But these months, there were big problem occurred that many chinese cities were power cut, because of the power shortages of hot weather.

This is a huge family, and one which is still growing, with other siblings including the likes of the military colored <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dunkskin.com%2FNike-Dunks-High-Shoes"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.dunkskin.com/Nike-Dunks-High-Shoes</a>  Oreos Paris, the rather high Nike Dunk Dinosaur Junior, the rather colorful Custom Nike High - Back to the Future II Horrible Pack and the Nike 6.0 Dunk High Black Coral; to name but a few of the numerous 'High' Nike Dunks. Of all Nike Dunks that I have gotten to use over my lifetime - and they are quite a number - I have to confess that it is Nike Supreme Blue that I have gotten most enchanted with.<br /><br />Although classified as a 'high' dunk, Nike High Pro SB Supreme Blue is not such a tall shoe, and it could just as well qualify to be termed as 'mid' dunk. It is perhaps the gradual, but unabating gain gradient, from the front part of the shoe where the toes go in to peak at the middle section of the shoe (where the tip of its 'tongue' is located) which qualifies it to be considered a 'high' dunk. This strong gradient does make the shoe look taller than it really is. It also helps, in building a perception of superior height, that the sole on Nike High Pro SB Supreme Blue is rather thick - though not particularly conspicuously so.<br /><br />Color-wise, at least 4 different colors can be identified on the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dunkskin.com%2Fnike-dunk-high-customs-tiger-flague"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.dunkskin.com/nike-dunk-high-customs-tiger-flague</a> . In my particular pair of this shoe, for instance, there is a 'purplish' scheme that can be described as the shoe's main color by virtue of the prominent places on the shoe where it appears, although in overall terms, black has more presentation on the shoe than the said purple, occurring as it does on the soles of the shoe (the lower part of it, that is), and most of the shoe's front part. The presence of white on this shoe, however, cannot be underestimated: as white comes out prominently on the upper part of the sole, that is, the part where the sole gets connected to the upper body of the shoe.<br /><br />Being such a tall shoe, it would be reasonable to expect the Custom Nike Dunk High SB Tigerflague to come with a rather lengthy shoelace affair, and in this respect it does not disappoint: coming as it does with a whopping 18-hole typing mechanism. <br /><br />In conditions of height, Nike Dunk Pro SB Mid - Tie Dye is really a quick shoe, a single which much more strictly talking, would be classified as belonging to the Nike 'Low' dunks loved ones. The rise in its gradient is gradual (and modest), commencing from the front area of the shoe wherever the toes go in, and peaking towards the middle part of the shoe, so that (like all Dunks), it will get to its greatest at the 'tip of the tongue' in which the shoe's upper human body meets its wearer's foot-trunk.As alluded to before, for a tying mechanism, Nike use a mixture of the classic shoelace and a flap mechanism which appears to be its favored mixture of securing mechanisms in all its modern day dunks. <br /><br />So the next time you play basketball you felt that the heat of the defense is on you, be sure to elude defenders with the help of Nike dunk shoes. Keep them adjusting to your game instead of you coping with the defense. With Nike dunks, you will be as unstoppable. Thanks to Nuke dunk shoes, in no time you will find yourself considered as one of the greatest players of the game.

Women have had a lesser privilege, since women rarely wear sports shoes. Nike Dunks have introduced sport shoes which look good on women as well. Women are getting more and more interested and attracted to sports. The high quality and durable sneakers can be sported by both men as well as women. There are new introductions to the shoes and sneakers year after year, thanks to the popularity and demand for Nike Dunks.<br /><br />Sporty as well as high utility value<br /><br />Nike Dunk is well appreciated by their clients because of its sporty look as well as high utility function. These shoes can be used daily since they are rough and tough and go well with different outfits. They would suit perfectly be it a sports event or any casual event. <br /><br />The Nike Dunks gained more popularity after it was reintroduced in 1998, this time the Nike Dunk was born in the form of the Nike Dunk SB; this shoe was meant for skateboarders, it was ideal for skateboarders because of its low profile and superb grip. Also the Nike Dunk has become a street fashion statement and it will remain to be one of the greatest shoes introduced till date.<br /><br />The next time when you are out to purchase shoes for your sports activity, buy <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dunkskin.com%2Fnike-hyperfuse-2011-rajon-rondo-black-green"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.dunkskin.com/nike-hyperfuse-2011-rajon-rondo-black-green</a>  for you. <br /><br />Nike at that time focused its Nike Dunks on the basketball court but because of the technology used in the shoes to address basketball requirements, the riders were attracted. The shoes were designed for strong grips, durability where ankle support is, and for comfort during flips and pivots. These were the same shoe requirements for skateboarding but that time, it wasn't too desirable for the underground nature of the sport. Riders preferred to buy from the smaller shops rather than the big shoe companies.<br /><br />When the skateboard industry grew to more than $2.5 by the early 2000s , so many brands like DC, Etnies, and Osiris got half of this growth with <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dunkskin.com%2Fnike-hyperfuse-2011-russell-westbrook-pe"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.dunkskin.com/nike-hyperfuse-2011-russell-westbrook-pe</a> .<br /><br />The shape of the shoes in the SB line was patterned after the original Nike Dunks for basketball.<br />Good cushioning was installed to protect from wear and tear<br />The science for low center of gravity was applied to these shoes through the Zoom Air Insoles.<br />Extra padding was placed around the ankle<br />Extra padding was placed at the tongue for extra cushion<br />Dunk SBs are stronger than the traditional as Nike took triple stitching to the next level<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dunkskin.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.dunkskin.com</a> are usually price-tagged at $59 to $99 depending on the demand. A lot of legendary Nike Dunk SBs have been produced and it is rarely that you will find one of these limited editions that sell for less than $150. Some of the most famous ones include the first Supremes, Heinekens, Supas, Forbes, Mulder, Tiffanys, and Calis - some fo which are still in reproduction.

For starters, the sole on the Womens Dunk High SB Christmas Edition is not particularly elevated/thick, which makes it a highly 'practical' shoe that one can 'rush around with.' <br /><br />For the health conscious, there is the rather attractive fact about the Womens Dunk High SB Christmas Edition, namely that it is a well ventilated shoe, with a lot of ventilation holes on the front section of it where the toes are meant to go in, and a back-end design which leaves quite some room for entry of fresh air into the shoe.<br /><br />These shoes aren't simple basketball shoes anymore than Michael Jordan is an average basketball player. These shoes are living pieces of the basketball legacy. They were so popular at one point that UNLV (University of Nevada Las Vegas) actually changed their basketball jersey colors to match the Nike Dunks.<br /><br />The <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dunkskin.com%2FNike-Dunks-Low-Shoes"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.dunkskin.com/Nike-Dunks-Low-Shoes</a> - Lobster is one of the members of the Nike Dunks Low family, and often wondering what it was that people found appealing in the lower dunks. That was, of course, before I got to use the Nike Dunk SB Low Lobster - with which I have since become thoroughly enchanted with, in the process getting to know the allure behind low dunks.<br /><br />For those who care about the long term health of their feet, there is the noteworthy fact that the Nike Dunk SB Low Lobster is quite a well ventilated shoe, with a lot of 'breather' holes on the front part of it (where the toes go in). <br /><br />Although the upper body of Nike SB Low Custom Pigeon is basically grey in color, at least 2 other colors can be identified at various parts of it (this in keeping with Nike's well known liberality with color), the other colors in question here being white (which dons the shoe laces) and the Nike 'tick' as well as orange (a carryover from the lower part of the sole, one would say), which makes a very brief appearance on the patch on the back end of the shoe between the region adjoining the shoe's tongue and the very back tip of the shoe.<br /><br />The sole on the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dunkskin.com%2FWomen-Nike-Dunks-Low-Pro-SB-Purple-Pigeons"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.dunkskin.com/Women-Nike-Dunks-Low-Pro-SB-Purple-Pigeons</a>  seems to be of the hardy, yet quite flexible variety, which normally holds the promise of durability to those who get to use it.

And they have really attracted people's attention since they were released in 2010. And Nike keeps introducing new designs of this series. Hyperfuse shoes are really high performance and light weight. They use the advanced material and technology. There are a pack of Hyperfuse which contain six different pair of shoes are created for the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dunkskin.com%2Fnike-hyperfuse-2011-white-metallic-luster-sport-red"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.dunkskin.com/nike-hyperfuse-2011-white-metallic-luster-sport-red</a>  in Los Angeles. Each one is designed in unique color scheme. The east LA silver, west LA max orange yellow, west LA cannon max orange, Hollywood 3D metallic pewter and 3D blue. All of the color scheme are inspired by the city of Los Angeles.<br /><br />First to come out was the V1, a shoe equipped with an Air Max 360 sole and Nike's Flywire technology. Considered an evolution of the LeBron 7, this shoe provides ample support and comfort, even for the biggest ballers. The V2 then came out. Armed with a modified upper, the carbon fiber panels are removed from the shoe and the base is wrapped in even more lightweight synthetic material and Flywire, making this shoe lighter than the V1. Then the PS came out. Now a full 2.5 ounces lighter than the V1, the materials for this shoe were radically modified. Flywire was replaced with the same mesh-type material seen in the Hyperfuse, the sole was replaced with a unit composed of an Air Max 180 heel unit and a Zoom Air unit in the forefoot.<br /><br />The <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dunkskin.com%2Fnike-hyperfuse-2011-rajon-rondo-black-green"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.dunkskin.com/nike-hyperfuse-2011-rajon-rondo-black-green</a>  is just another addition to the already strong lineup that Jordan Brand and Nike continues to drop in a low-cut basketaball shoe. And why wouldn't they? Ballers are demanding them. Demanding them in record numbers. The Nike Hyerfuse, originally dropped as a mid-cut basketball shoe has now become more popular as a low-cut shoe. More pairs of the Hyperfuse have sold in low-cut than it's mid-cut counterpart. Both professional and recreational basketball players have accepted and actually prefer playing in low-cut kicks. The lightweight stability is a big reason why this is the case. Durability and high performance are also big reasons that hoopers are switching over to low-cut kicks. The new technology in which basketball shoes are now made allow for all the qualities that a baller wants in a shoe.<br /><br />Nike Zoom KD III has been around for some time now. To our surprise, the sneakers were not worn by KD himself but his teammates Ivey and Michael Jai White, which were shown on the court. Kevin Durant, a basketball superstar, hopes his signature sneakers possess not only the wonderful functionality, but tolerable price. So that everybody who likes basketball shoes could own one pair. Besides, the Nike Zoom KD III applied for the Durant's own unique perspectives, and the designers integrate the allegoric details with a new style way into the sneakers' design.<br /><br />The Nike Air Force One was originally made for the basketball hardcourt. It was produced as a mid-top basketball shoe and subsequently as a low-top sneaker. Technology in footwear certainly has come a long way. Especially when it comes to performance footwear for basketball players. There are now Air Jordans and the Hyper series(i.e.Hyperdunks, Hyperfuses, etc.) that Nike offers as high performance basketball shoes. And, high performance they are. The Air Force One has not been seen near a basketball court since, well, the 80's.<br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dunkskin.com%2Fnike-zoom-hyperfuse-2011-white-metallic-luster-wolf-grey-volt-lime-greem"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.dunkskin.com/nike-zoom-hyperfuse-2011-white-metallic-luster-wolf-grey-volt-lime-greem</a>  <br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dunkskin.com%2Fnike-hyperfuse-2011-russell-westbrook-pe"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.dunkskin.com/nike-hyperfuse-2011-russell-westbrook-pe</a>

This is called greater Moment of Inertia (MOI). Greater MOI should lead to more center-of-the-face contact and theoretically make the ball go further and straighter. I guess you could say manufacturers have gone to extremes with the theory and this new square design.<br />Both Callaway and Nike have already come out with clubs using this concept. Nike has the SQ Sumo and Callaway has <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dunkskin.com%2Fnike-hyperfuse-2011-black-photo-blue-volt"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.dunkskin.com/nike-hyperfuse-2011-black-photo-blue-volt</a> . <br /><br />All around the world, Nike basketball shoes can be found without trouble. Suburban malls and urban shopping centers alike normally keep all the current styles in stock. To be sure, sneaker aficionados know where the best sneaker shops and outlet malls are found to keep the collection up to date.<br /><br />Nike is known for designing, creating, and selling shoes that are specific to NBA players who have achieved a certain status in the game or who are superstars. Such player edition models include ones associated with current mega-stars as Kobe Bryant, Kevin Durant, and LeBron James.<br /><br />For example, in 2011, the sportswear maker will sell the sixth version of <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dunkskin.com%2Fnike-hyperfuse-2011-luster-black"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.dunkskin.com/nike-hyperfuse-2011-luster-black</a> , the eighth edition of the Air Max LeBron James, and the third incarnation of Zoom Kevin Durant. As in the past, each of these lines is expected to be released starting in late 2010 and continuing throughout 2011 in a variety of colors and patterns.<br /><br />It all started during the 1984-85 season in the NBA. It was then that basketball kicks began its rise to iconic status. Until that season, white shoes were the norm and Nike was not the dominant entity it is today because adidas and Converse were just as popular, perhaps even more.<br /><br />The initial Air Jordan shoe transformed an industry. The shoe was available in several color schemes. One model in particular, primarily black and red with very little white, caused the NBA to levy fines at Jordan for each time he wore them.<br /><br />A feature that many basketball kicks fans like is the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dunkskin.com%2Fnike-hyperfuse-2011-rajon-rondo-black-green"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.dunkskin.com/nike-hyperfuse-2011-rajon-rondo-black-green</a> . It is a feature found on its web site and in official Nike brick-and-mortar stores. This program allows customers to choose their favorite style of basketball shoe for personal creation.<br /><br />You can just imagine the pain and injury that a player can get when he plays without the baseball gloves. Bruised palms, in could be the least that a player has to worry. And yet the first baseball gloves appeared only in the 1870&amp;rsquo;s. Before that baseball players has to catch the ball with bare hands, something that we can not imagine today. When baseball gloves started to appear it was made from scraps of leather that were sewn together.<br />The more popular manufacturers of baseball gloves are Rawlings, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dunkskin.com%2Fnike-hyperfuse-2011-russell-westbrook-pe"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.dunkskin.com/nike-hyperfuse-2011-russell-westbrook-pe</a> , Mizuno and Nokona.<br />For players starting out in baseball buying brand new gloves that are good can be a little steep. If you want a glove that is good, second hand gloves can be a good option and the Internet can show you where. The Internet has, in a very short span of years, become a virtual shopping venue. If you want to try it out, try Ebay or type the keywords &amp;ldquo;discount baseball gloves&amp;rdquo; and you will be surprised at what you will find. Searching the Internet for baseball gloves can yield you results several times over than going from store to store. There are good sellers on the net where you can buy your baseball gloves at 50% less than its brand new counterpart.

My pair, for instance, is based on the black yellow color scheme, the tone of black employed here being the 'real' absolute black tone, and the yellow being the 'darkest' tone of it, to make for a conspicuous combination indeed. Towards the bottom of the shoe, where the upper region of the shoe borders with the shoe's sole, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dunkskin.com%2FNike-Dunks-High-Shoes"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.dunkskin.com/Nike-Dunks-High-Shoes</a>  Pro SB comes with a brief white section - which is in fact a region of white paint on what otherwise appears to be the shoe's basically black sole. It would seem that Nike chooses to employ white at this point to create the 'contrast effect' which is otherwise not so apparent in the black-yellow color scheme employed all over the rest of the shoe.The word 'high' in the shoes name (High Pro S<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cool.gif" alt=":)" /> is not placed in the phrase just for the sake of it. <br />Contrary to what its name suggest, Nike SB Supreme Blue is in fact not a primarily blue shoe. Indeed, on my particular pair of this shoe, the primary color is white, with blue only making a brief appearance towards the back of the shoe. The bottom part of the sole, the part that is in contact with the ground is colored red, with the upper part of the sole, the part where it is joined to the upper body of the shoe being colored white. Most of the front part of this shoe is white too; including the part where the toes are supposed to go in, the tongue of the 'shoe,' and the main patch which connects the various parts of the shoes' body. This strong gradient does make the shoe look taller than it really is. It also helps, in building a perception of superior height, that the sole on Nike High Pro SB Supreme Blue is rather thick - though not particularly conspicuously so.The Nike tick on Nike Supreme Blue is, as in all modern Nikes, quite elongated; stretching all the way to the back of the shoe, and going round to emerge at the opposite end of the shoe. This can be seen as a signature, to show that Nike SB Supreme Blue is indeed a 'modern' Nike.For a tying mechanism, Nike has opted to provide the users of Nike Dunk High Pro SB Supreme Blue with the traditional shoe-lace mechanism. As befits a shoe of this height, this is quite an elongated affair, spanning over 18 shoe-lace holes (9 pairs) - although the user does have the option of leaving some of these unthreaded.
