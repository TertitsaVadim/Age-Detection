<br /><br />I want him to be honest with me.  He needs to be sweet and caring. He should at least like kids since I love spending time with my nieces.  He should love me unconditionally. He needs to be a decent guy, that has a job and has plans for a future. I want him to be taller than me. He needs to take care of himself. He should have no problem admitting when he is wrong and if he has a problem admitting it then that is ok.  I want him to be willing to hold me when I am scared or anytime I am sad about something.  I don't want to be his trophy wife, but he should want to show me off to his friends.  He needs to be a guy that always does the right thing even if it is hard for him.  I may seem to asking a lot of guys, but I deserve better than what boys have provided so far. Maybe I can find a guy like this.

<br />all torn to shreds.
<br />Broken glass all bloody,
<br />thoughts rush though their heads.
<br /><br />How could she do this?
<br />Just let it all go.
<br />Because of a kiss?
<br />She let her blood flow
<br /><br />Pictures of them together,
<br />so happy and in love.
<br />Now she is gone forever,
<br />his one and only love.

<br />it's simple to see.
<br />That I have forgotten
<br />your memory.
<br />We once laughed,
<br />we once cried,
<br />we once wrote
<br />this lullaby.
<br />We thought it would live
<br />to see the day.
<br />That we would be together,
<br />not walking away.
<br />You said you'd never leave me,
<br />I guess you lied.
<br />You set me free,
<br />and we both cried.

<br />I didn't know I'd let it o that far
<br />Didn't know you'd take my innocence away
<br />Then throw me out the very next day
<br />I didn't know I'd have to spend the rest of my life
<br />Supporting something that wasn't even wanted by Christ
<br /><br />I gotta pay those bills, gotta watch that tv
<br />Gotta wait for the check I've got since I was 17
<br />Gotta take them to soccer games and movie scenes
<br />Sometimes it just makes me want to scream
<br /><br />Starring at these marks, they just won't go away
<br />Praying you were here to help me make it through the day
<br />Avoiding their questions everytime I turn around
<br />Just wanting to fall crying to the ground
<br />Playing with babydolls to make her smile
<br />Listening to his stories just makes it all worth while
<br /><br />Gotta pay those bills, gotta watch that tv
<br />Gotta wait for the check I've got since I was 17
<br />Gotta take them to soccer games and movie scenes
<br />Sometimes it just makes me want to scream
<br /><br />I can't handle the pressure of &quot;being mom&quot;
<br />But I get through the day, and life goes on
<br />I get up every moring to take care of your kids
<br />I look at their pictures when i can't make it though the day
<br />I tell them about you when they want to know
<br />They don't understand why you left, all I say
<br />&quot;Mommy wasn't good enough to make him stay&quot;

<br /><br />Here's how it works: 
<br />Statistically speaking, unless you are a total hermit, social retard, or ugly as a bag of spoiled ass... 
<br />There's at least 1 person on here that wants to date you or sleep with you. So..... lets play &quot;friends w/ benefits&quot; 
<br /><br />The rules are simple... if you want to date the person who posted this, send them a msg saying &quot;I'M YOURS&quot; 
<br /><br />If you just want to sleep with them and stay friends, send them a message that says &quot;I'D HIT IT&quot; 
<br /><br />SCARED? LOL 
<br /><br />THE TWIST IS YOU HAVE TO REPOST THIS, EVEN IF YOU'RE TAKEN 
<br />&amp; see who replies. There is at least 1 person on your PAN that wants to date you, and maybe more that want to sleep with you. 
<br /><br />SO... re-post this as &quot;friends w/ benefits&quot;

		<document id="f122f66d2f890dff6af3e6ba7d279905" url=""><![CDATA[Hunter<br/><br/>I really don't know why I am writing you. I just am. I have so much that I want to say, but I don't know how to say it. Ok, here goes: Why do you say that you love me and yet you keep hurting me? Why is it you keep dating more than one person? Why is it you decided you would be happier with a fourteen year old? Why aren't I good enough? All these questions keep running through my mind. It hurts thinking about all of this. At times I can't even breathe because of the pain. But, I don't have the nerve to ask these face to face. I don't want you to see the tears in my eyes or the way that I can't stop trembling. I don't want you to hear the quiver in my voice. I don't want to be seen as weak. Yea, I get it, I'm already weak since I can't think about my dad and what he did without bursting into tears. I'm done being angry with you for breaking my heart yet again. I'm done loving you. I'm done being your doormat. God, this all sounds so good, but I know that I won't be able to stick to this if you come asking me back out. I am so pathetic. I can't stop shaking right now so I am just done. I'm sorry that I can't stop loving you and just move on.
