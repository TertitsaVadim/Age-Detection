<br /><br />Jonathan Percy, 29, pretended to be 15 when he contacted the girls, aged 12 and 13, through the Facebox networking site, a court heard yesterday.
<br /><br />After swapping messages he met them, plied them with alcopops and sexually assaulted the 12-year-old in his car while her friend sat in the back.
<br /><br />Days later, he had sex with the 13-year-old. She confessed to her mum.
<br /><br />Percy admitted assaulting the younger girl and sex with the 13-year-old.
<br /><br />Bournemouth crown court heard he was jailed in 2003 for unlawful sex with a 12-year-old.
<br /><br />Jailing him indefinitely, Judge John Beashel said: &quot;You did not learn any lessons. You are a danger to young girls.&quot;
<br /><br />Percy, of Mannington, Dorset, will not be considered for parole for three years and will be on licence for life. He must register as a sex offender and is banned from working with children and using computers.

<br />that I bought you roses
<br />to tell you that i like you
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />That I was raised with respect
<br />not to sleep with you when you were drunk
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />That my body's not ripped enough
<br />to &quot;satisfy&quot; your wants
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />that I open your car door,
<br />and pull out your chair like I was raised
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />That I'm not cute enough
<br />to be &quot;your guy&quot;
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />That I am actually nice;
<br />not a jerk
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />I don't have a huge bank account
<br />to buy you expensive things
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />I like to spend quality nights at home
<br />cuddling with you, instead of at a club
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />I would rather make love to you then just screw you
<br />like some random guy.
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />That I am always the one you need to talk to,
<br />but never good enough to date
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />That I always held your hair back when you threw up,and didn't get mad at you for puking in my car,
<br />but when we went out you went home with another guy
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />That I am there to pick you up at 4am when your new man hit you and dropped you off in the middle of nowhere,
<br />but not good enough to listen to me when I need a friend
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />If I start not being there because it hurts being used as a door mat, only to be thrown to the side when the new jerk comes around
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />If I don't answer my phone anymore when you call, to listen to you cry for hours, instead of getting a couple hours of sleep before work
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />that you can't realize.. I've been the one all along.
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />If you read this and know somebody like this
<br />but don't care
<br /><br />But most of all
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />For not being sorry anymore
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />That you can't accept me for who I am
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />I can never do anything right, and nothing that I do is good
<br />enough to make it in your world.
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />I caught your boyfriend with another girl and told you about it, I thought that was what friends were for...
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />That I told you I loved you and actually meant it.
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />That I talked to you for nine hours on Thanksgiving when your boyfriend was threatening you instead of spending time with my family.
<br /><br />I'm Sorry
<br />That I cared
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />that I listen to you at night talking about how you wish you could have done something different.
<br /><br />Ladies always complain and gripe to their friends that there is never any good guys out there, and they always end up with assholes who mistreat them. Well ladies next time you're complaining, maybe look up to see who you're complaining to, maybe that special someone is right there hanging on your every word as usual, screaming in his head &quot;Why won't you give me a chance?&quot;
<br />Because the person you are usually searching for is right by you.
<br /><br />If you're a guy and you agree with this letter, repost as &quot;I'm sorry &quot;
<br /><br />If You're one of the FEW girls with enough BALLS to repost, and you would never make your guy feel this way (again), repost as Subject &quot;Girls dont realize these things&quot;
