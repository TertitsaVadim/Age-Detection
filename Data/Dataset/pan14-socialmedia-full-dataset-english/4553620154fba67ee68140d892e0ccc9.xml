Oleoresin Capsicum is a non-lethal, non-toxic, non-flammable solution which ispressurized with C02 in aerosol form.&lt;/P&gt;
<br /><br />&lt;P&gt;If you are wondering which <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5zZWN1cml0eWFuZHNlbGZkZWZlbnNlc3RvcmUuY29tL3Byb2R1Y3RzL3BlcHBlci1zcHJheS9waXN0b2wtZ3JpcC1wZXBwZXItc3ByYXktdW5pdC5odG1s" target="_blank">pepper spray</a> is most effective, one must consider two key factors influencing the effectiveness of your pepper spray solution: the percentage of pepper being used and the heat rating of that pepper measured in Scoville Heat Units or (S.H.U.). &lt;/P&gt;
<br /><br />&lt;P&gt;Pepper spray allows you to protect yourself and offers effective self defense and keeps you a safe distance from an assailant. A one second spray at the facial area induces temporary blindness swells the veins in eyes making them to slam close, choking and restricting breathing , coughing, and nausea. Pepper spray use will force your assailant to their knees with results lasting as long as 45 minutes. &lt;/P&gt;

<br /><br />Pepper Spray Foggers
<br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5zZWN1cml0eWFuZHNlbGZkZWZlbnNlc3RvcmUuY29tL3Byb2R1Y3RzL3BlcHBlci1zcHJheS5odG1s" target="_blank">Pepper sprays</a> that dispersed with an aerosol method creates a cloud of pepper spray which is why it is called a fogger. The main advantages of this method are you are not required to be as accurate when you aim. Plus, you will take in a wider area… or multiple targets with a single spray. The disadvantages are that if you are on the move or in a windy spot the cloud of spray might come back towards you. Also a dispersed cloud may not pack as powerful a punch as focused stream of pepper gel or pepper foam.

<br />&lt;p&gt;There are two types of pinhole lenses – flat and conical. Conical lenses require a smaller hole and are often used in <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5zZWN1cml0eWFuZHNlbGZkZWZlbnNlc3RvcmUuY29tL3Byb2R1Y3RzL2NhbWVyYS1zeXN0ZW1zLmh0bWw_" target="_blank">surveillance camera systems</a> using ceiling tiles.

<br />&lt;p&gt;With their smaller hole size the pinhole lens will have a somewhat lower resolution than a board lens. which is usually 1/2 inch in diameter, thereby allowing more light to get in.&lt;/p&gt;
