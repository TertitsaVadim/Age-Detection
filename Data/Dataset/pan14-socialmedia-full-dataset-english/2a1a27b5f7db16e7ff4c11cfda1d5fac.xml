<br />Mommy
<br />I am only 8 inches long
<br />but I have all my organs.
<br />I love the sound of your voice.
<br />Every time I hear it
<br />I wave my arms and legs.
<br />The sound of your heart beat
<br />is my favorite lullaby.
<br /><br />Month Two
<br />Mommy
<br />today I learned how to suck my thumb.
<br />If you could see me
<br />you could definitely tell that I am a baby.
<br />I'm not big enough to survive outside my home though.
<br />It is so nice and warm in here.
<br /><br />Month Three
<br />You know what Mommy
<br />I'm a boy!!
<br />I hope that makes you happy.
<br />I always want you to be happy.
<br />I don't like it when you cry.
<br />You sound so sad.
<br />It makes me sad too
<br />and I cry with you even though
<br />you can't hear me.
<br /><br />Month Four
<br />Mommy
<br />my hair is starting to grow.
<br />It is very short and fine
<br />but I will have a lot of it.
<br />I spend a lot of my time exercising.
<br />I can turn my head and curl my fingers and toes
<br />and stretch my arms and legs.
<br />I am becoming quite good at it too.
<br /><br />Month Five
<br />You went to the doctor today.
<br />Mommy, he lied to you.
<br />He said that I'm not a baby.
<br />I am a baby Mommy, your baby.
<br />I think and feel.
<br />Mommy, what's abortion?
<br /><br />Month Six
<br />I can hear that doctor again.
<br />I don't like him.
<br />He seems cold and heartless.
<br />Something is intruding my home.
<br />The doctor called it a needle.
<br />Mommy what is it? It burns!
<br />Please make him stop!
<br />I can't get away from it!
<br />Mommy! HELP me!
<br /><br />Month Seven
<br />Mommy
<br />I am okay.
<br />I am in Jesus's arms.
<br />He is holding me.
<br />He told me about abortion.
<br />Why didn't you want me Mommy?
<br />Every Abortion Is Just . . .
<br />One more heart that was stopped.
<br />Two more eyes that will never see.
<br />Two more hands that will never touch.
<br />Two more legs that will never run.
<br />One more mouth that will never speak.
<br />if you're against abortion, then send this on

<br /><br />UNITED WE STAND
<br />1) New York City has 11 letters
<br /><br />2) Afghanistan has 11 letters.
<br /><br />3) Ramsin Yuseb (The terrorist who threatened to destroy the Twin Towers in 1993) has 11 letters.
<br /><br />4) George W Bush has 11 letters.
<br /><br />5) The two twin towers make an &quot;11&quot;
<br /><br />This could be a mere coincidence, but this gets more interesting:
<br /><br />2) The first plane crashing against the Twin Towers was flight number
<br />11.
<br /><br />3) Flight 11 was carrying 92 passengers. 9 + 2 = 11
<br /><br />4) Flight 77 which also hit Twin Towers, was carrying 65 passengers.
<br /><br />6+5 = 11
<br /><br />5) The tragedy was on September 11, or 9/11 as it is now known. 9 + 1+ 1 = 11
<br /><br />6) The date is equal to the US emergency services telephone number 911.
<br /><br />9 + 1 + 1 = 11.
<br /><br />Sheer coincidence..?! Read on and make up your own mind:
<br />1) The total number of victims inside all the hi-jacked planes was 254. &gt;2 + 5 + 4 = 11.
<br /><br />2) September 11 is day number 254 of the calendar year.
<br /><br />Again 2 + 5 + 4 = 11.
<br /><br />3) The Madrid bombing took place on 3/11/2004. 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 4 = 11.
<br /><br />4) The tragedy of Madrid happened 911 days after the Twin Towers
<br /><br />incident.
<br /><br />Sheer coincidence..?! Read on and make up your own mind:
<br />Now this is where things get totally eerie:
<br /><br />The most recognized symbol for the US, after the Stars &amp; Stripes, is the Eagle. The following verse is taken from the Koran, the Islamic holy book:
<br /><br />&quot;For it is written that a son of Arabia would awaken a fearsome Eagle. The wrath of the Eagle would be felt throughout the lands of Allah and lo, while some of the people trembled in despair still more rejoiced: for the wrath of the Eagle cleansed the lands of Allah and there was peace.&quot;
<br /><br />That verse is number 9.11 of the Koran.
<br /><br />Still unconvinced about all of this..?! Try this and see how you feel afterwards, it made my hair stand on end:
<br /><br />Open Microsoft Word and do the following, TRY THIS FOR REAL I'M I DID IT AND IT SCARED THE LIVING CRAP OUT OF MEE!!!!!!!
<br /><br />1. Type in capitals Q33 NY. This is the flight number of the first
<br />plane to hit one of the Twin Towers.
<br /><br />2. Highlight the Q33 NY.
<br /><br />3. Change the font size to 48.
<br /><br />4. Change the actual font to the WINGDINGS (scariest part of all)
<br /><br />Extremely scary huh? IT ACTUALLY WORKS!!!

<br />Her parents kept her
<br />Locked in an attic
<br /><br />Her only friend
<br />was a little toy bear
<br />It was old and worn out
<br />And had patches of hair
<br /><br />She always talked to it
<br />When no one's around
<br />She lays there and hugs it
<br />Not a peep of sound
<br /><br />Until her parents
<br />unlock the door
<br />Some more and more pain
<br />She'll have to endore
<br /><br />A bruise on her leg
<br />A scar on her face
<br />Why would she be
<br />In such a horrible place?
<br /><br />But she grabs her bear
<br />And softly crys
<br />She loves her parents
<br />But they want her to die
<br /><br />She sits in the corner
<br />Quiet but thinking,
<br />&quot;Please God, why is
<br />My life always sinking? &quot;
<br /><br />Such a bad life
<br />For a sad little kid
<br />She'd get beaten and beaten
<br />For anything she did
<br /><br />Then one night
<br />Her mom came home high
<br />And the poor child was beaten
<br />As hours went by
<br /><br />Then her mom suddenly
<br />Grabbed for a blade
<br />It was sharp and pointy
<br />One that she made
<br /><br />She thrusted the blade
<br />Right in her chest,
<br />&quot;You deserve to die
<br />You worthless peice of shit!
<br /><br />The mom walked out
<br />Leaving the girl slowly dieing
<br />She grabbed her bear
<br />And again started crying
<br /><br />Police showed up
<br />At the small little house
<br />Then quickly barged in
<br />Everything quiet as a mouse
<br /><br />One officer slowly
<br />Opened a door
<br />To find the little girl
<br />Liing dead on the floor
<br /><br />It must have been bad
<br />To go through so much harm
<br />But at least she died
<br />With her best friend in her arms
<br /><br />A child dies every day from child abuse.
<br />And if you have an ounce of pity in you for Auroura (the little girl),
<br />and you hate child abuse with a passion,
<br />you will repost this and help out those abused children,
<br />and let them know that someone cares for them.
<br />It doesn't take that long only about 10 seconds
<br />so please just do it.
<br /><br />she was only 5 and never loved ...
<br />if you dont repost this your a lazy, cold hearted person
<br />so plz repost this saying: she was ONLY fucking 5
