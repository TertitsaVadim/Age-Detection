However, most companies prefer that the insured person parts with something before the policy comes into effect.  There are some companies that will offer a no down payment method of acquiring auto insurance though and these can be found online.  This is not available in all states so it also depends on where the driver lives if he wants to take advantage of this kind of offer.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;Easiest Way for No Down Payment&lt;/b&gt; - Some companies will take the first month’s premiums as the down payment since the driver has obviously committed to the agreement.  However, for the truly no down payment cheap car insurance, it is a must that the driver must have a great credit score.  If this is so, all it takes is a few clicks online and the insurance is in place.<br /><br />Another way of looking at the no down payment method is to pay for all the insurance in one go.  That is, for three, six or twelve months in advance.  Now this sounds like a bit of a contradiction in terms but it actually saves on processing fees each month so will save money in the long run.  Middle income drivers usually opt for the monthly premiums instead but they will pay more over the course of the policy.  In the lowest insurance premiums this could run to one hundred and twenty dollars or more per year.<br /><br />This kind of offer, the no down payment kind, is usually reserved for middle income families that just cannot pull out a one year cover price all at once.  They will obviously need the car for work and for family arrangements etc but they still are living on a tight budget.  However, as with all arrangements, there is no such thing as a free lunch!<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;What Else Is Needed?&lt;/b&gt; - It is common knowledge that a car must have insurance to cover all eventualities and the person who would drive without cover is foolish indeed.  Not only would they be committing a criminal offence, they are also putting their assets at risk too.  If someone is not insured and is involved in an accident, the opposing driver can sue the coverless driver for all his personal assets and this can be devastating.<br /><br />To keep costs lower, go for the basic minimum cover allowed in the state and try to get discounts for different things.  For example, different organizations attract discounts as do being a member of different work groups.  This could include civil servants or those belonging to very large unions etc so check this out before buying the insurance of choice.<br /><br />Before accepting exceptionally cheap insurance cover, check online for the reputation of that company and see how they rate among the public.  It is no use paying minimum rates and then finding out that they don’t pay out properly when claims are made.  Indeed, this is the biggest complaint of some people so it is a good idea to check this aspect extremely carefully.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;In Conclusion&lt;/b&gt; - Although it is relatively easy to <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2NoZWFwYXV0b2luc3VyYW5jZTcuY29tL3RpcHMtZm9yLWdldHRpbmctY2hlYXAtYXV0by1pbnN1cmFuY2UtY292ZXJhZ2Uv" target="_blank">get cheap car insurance</a>, even no down payment auto insurance, with a bad credit history, it is not the only thing that insurance companies check up on.  The type of car which is being insured, the location the car is being kept in and the mileage that the car will do annually all comes into play here.  Just remember to be meticulously honest when filling in application forms since any anomaly here could render the policy null and void when making a claim in the future.  Honesty certainly pays in this instance! <br /><br />Compare Seven Cheap Auto Insurance Quotes and Save Up To 40% or $400 A Year on Auto Insurance Coverage at: <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2NoZWFwYXV0b2luc3VyYW5jZTcuY29t" target="_blank"><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fcheapautoinsurance7.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://cheapautoinsurance7.com</a></a>

Although they are more difficult to get insured, thanks to their tender age, there are some steps which can be undertaken to at least reduce rates that are sometimes extortionate.  With a little vigilance, and a lot of research, there are ways to cut down the amount of money to be paid for insurance on our children.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;Add Children to Parents’ Policies&lt;/b&gt; - The first and most obvious way to keep premiums low is to keep the child on the parents’ insurance policy for as long as possible.  Once they are removed from this policy, it is inevitable that their rates will go skywards.  Since they have no history of safe driving on their own insurance policies, they have to start right back at the beginning to create a history.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;Keep Students in Line&lt;/b&gt; - Another incentive to get good premiums on cheap car insurance for students is to find a company that offers lower rates for grade B students who manage to keep it at that level or above.  This is a great incentive since the student knows that by buckling down and staying with the books he will pay less for his insurance in the long run.  Since this can run to a whopping twenty percent, what great incentive do they need?  Be prepared to disclose results a few times per year to keep this kind of deal going.<br /><br />All students should strive to keep a pristine driving record.  If they don’t, and we all know what some students get up to when they are out of the parental home, this kind of bad behavior could actually follow them all through college and sometimes beyond college.  It is bad enough that insurance companies penalize young people anyway but give them a chance and they will increase rates for years.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;Lowering Risks&lt;/b&gt; - Oddly enough, anyone who has unpaid bills or is delinquent in paying utilities etc will be charged more for their insurance.  The insurance company sees someone not responsible for paying bills on time as someone who is a high risk.  Credit cards are the worst for increasing debt so make sure to pay these off as quickly as possible.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;Walk to School&lt;/b&gt; - Whenever and wherever possible, the student should take public transport to ensure that they stay below the mileage threshold on the policy.  Since most students live on or near their campus, then walking, cycling or bussing to college should be easy to do. Decreasing mileage means that a lower premium has to be paid.  Indeed, some companies have a ‘pay as you go’ scheme where they put a black box on the car to record mileage and will only charge according to how many miles are covered.<br /><br />College students often have the opportunity to take some defensive driving classes and these too will allow the insurance company to reduce rates. Finding cheap car insurance for students takes some time and maybe some effort, but when the results show in lower annual fees, most of us jump at this chance.<br /><br />It is clear then that there are several ways to cut down on premiums for car insurance.  Take some time to research online and compare each policy side by side. There will be some slight differences in each policy so the best way to do this is to figure out first what must be covered and what doesn’t.  For example, leave out the expensive sound system while at college so that the insurance company does not have to cover it.  This, for sure, is a small price to pay for not having music in the car! <br /><br />Compare Seven Cheap Auto Insurance Quotes and Save Up To 40% or $400 A Year on Auto Insurance Coverage at: <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2NoZWFwYXV0b2luc3VyYW5jZTcuY29t" target="_blank"><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fcheapautoinsurance7.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://cheapautoinsurance7.com</a></a>
