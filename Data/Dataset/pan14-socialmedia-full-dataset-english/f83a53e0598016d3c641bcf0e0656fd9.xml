<br />to wake up in the sun?
<br />How does it feel like,

<br />How does it feel like,
<br />to let forever be?
<br />How does it feel like,

<br /><br />Scream a symphony.

<br />How does it feel like,

<br /><br />Scream a symphony.
<br /><br />How does it feel like,

<br />How does it feel like,
<br />to breathe with everything?
<br />How does it feel like,
<br />to let forever be?
<br />How does it feel like,
<br />to spend a little lifetime sitting in the gutter?
<br /><br />Scream a symphony.
<br /><br />How does it feel like,
<br />to be a crystal fiend?
<br />How does it feel like,
<br />to spend a little lifetime sitting in the gutter? 
<br /><br />Scream a symphony.

<br />I can give you a fight where no one's to blame you can give me the light and not go insane let the bliss die with doves let a fist fight clean blood
<br />You can be there too late they won't realize you can come back some day they won't be surprised let the best cry for you let them see what you took
<br />And any answer is good for your doll
<br /><br />Let a man be insane for once in his life let a dog be the game for the rest who complain
<br />You don't need to obey the rules of your game better move feet of clay than follow the fame let the best cry for you let them see what you took
<br />When they scream and pretend you make a safe bet anything that is said is best to forget let the bliss die with doves let a fist fight clean blood
<br /><br />And any answer is good for your doll
<br /><br />Let a man be insane for once in his life let a dog be the game for the rest who complain
<br /><br />There's a place of no pride no need to be polite any question you have will be answered in time
<br />There's no bullet that kills (they fall for your lies)
<br />It ain't no bitter pill (a pleasant surprise)
<br />Spend your money on nothing you can just go wild go wild
<br /><br />Let a man be insane for once in his life let a dog be the game for the rest who complain

<br /><br />Change around the words that you say,
<br />to suit me fine.
<br /><br />Predictable behavior
<br />I crave ya
<br />I'm driven
<br />You're my only living saviour
<br />Sometimes I hate ya
<br />But I'm whipped
<br />Being gone head down to the crypt
<br />Restricted like a conscript
<br />You love to bully
<br />I placed the blame with you
<br />Fully... 
<br /><br />Change around the words that you say,
<br />to suit me fine.
<br />Make them mine...
<br /><br />Don't panic
<br />There's only we two left on the planet
<br />I can explain..
<br />I know it happened again, 
<br />It's manic
<br />I'm standing in the flame
<br />Trying to fan it
<br />You don't know what you've got till it's gone
<br />And by the edge of the night, 
<br />you nobody belong through this adjunct.
<br />And that's what you cut.
<br /><br />Change around the words that you say,
<br />to suit me fine.
<br />Make them mine...
<br />Listen to the voice of your head,
<br />It makes no sense,
<br />Take a rest...
<br /><br />I'm addicted..
<br /><br />I have a demon for a wife
<br />He delights in your pretty face and he hates my life
<br />Takes notes on how to provoke past grief 
<br />Makes my teeth decay with the last of my self believe
<br />Feed all day from underneath
<br />Like a theif
<br />I'm left weak
<br />barely able to speak
<br />I seek nothing but constant supply
<br />I can read every look in your eyes
<br />I leave with a lie
<br />Baby our love will never die
<br />Or, maybe it's the last time I make you cry
<br />Make my appeal like the condemned.
<br />Let's go away for the weekend
<br />Your life I will steal and descend with it into the pit.
<br /><br />I'm addicted..
<br /><br />Change around the words that you say,
<br />to suit me fine.
<br /><br />I'm addicted..
<br /><br />Listen to the voice of your head,
<br />It makes no sense..
<br />Take a rest...
<br /><br />I'm addicted..
<br />I have a little problem
<br />I have a demon for a wife
<br />He delights in your pretty face and he hates my life
<br />Takes notes on how to provoke past grief 
<br />Makes my teeth decay with the last of my self believe
<br /><br />Change around the words that you say,
<br />to suit me fine.
<br />Make them mine...
<br /><br />I'm addicted..
<br /><br />Listen to the voice of your head,
<br />It makes no sense..

<br /><br />Apoptygma Berzerk - Love Never Dies, Pt. 1
<br /><br />Forever in your arms, you said, forever in my heart

<br /><br />You have become what you have always been 
<br />light flickering around, peripheral vision 
<br />no words we can speak, our paths have been chosen 
<br />but all trails that we trek, 
<br />-should lead us back to here because our 
<br /><br />love comes again 
<br />just when i've broken down i found 
<br />love can come again 
<br />you've got to believe that 
<br /><br />love comes again 
<br />just when i've broken down i found 
<br />love can come again 
<br /><br />dig within me, turn all the secret stones 
<br />forests and fields, breathing with blood and bones 
<br />still no words we can speak, our paths have been chosen 
<br />but all trails that we trek, 
<br />-should lead us back to here because our 
<br /><br />love comes again

<br /><br />Now you see you're breaking up again
<br />Now you see you're slowly going insane
<br />You don't even know your face or name
<br />Stand up now we've got to break this chain
<br /><br />Now do you see the feeling in your eyes
<br />Do you know the things that make you cry
<br />There are things that money just won't buy
<br />Wake up now you got to trust and try
<br /><br />No I don't advocate god
<br />And you don't seem to find love
<br />Don't waste time praying
<br />Get on with finding
<br /><br />Just as you began to find your way
<br />I found you there with just bad words to say
<br />Get out of here you're just a waste of space
<br />You're on your own it's you and your disgrace
<br /><br />It's been a long time coming
<br />But now you've found some loving
<br />Don't throw it all away now
<br />Don't get on your knees and pray now

<br /><br />2. When paying for a taxi, don't look at your wallet as you take out a note. Just grab one out at random and hand it over. It will always be the exact fare. 
<br /><br />3. Television news bulletins usually contain a story that affects you personally at the precise moment it's aired. 
<br /><br />4. Creepy music (or satanic chanting) coming from a graveyard should always be closely investigated. 
<br /><br />5. Any lock can be picked with a credit card or paperclip in seconds. UNLESS it's the door to a burning building with a child inside. 
<br /><br />6. If you decide to start dancing in the street, everyone you bump into will know all the steps. 
<br /><br />7. All bombs are fitted with electronic timing devices with large red digital displays so you know exactly when they are going to explode. 
<br /><br />8. Should you wish to pass yourself off as a German officer, it will not be necessary to learn to speak German. Simply speaking English with a German accent will do. Similarly, when they are alone, all German soldiers prefer to speak English to each other. Same goes with Russian.
<br /><br />9. Once applied, lipstick will never rub off. Even while scuba diving. 
<br /><br />10. The Eiffel Tower can be seen from any window of any building in Paris. 
<br /><br />11. Any police officer about to retire from the force will more often than not die on their last day (especially if their family have planned a party). (Caveat: Detectives can only solve a case after they have been suspended from duty). 
<br /><br />12. Getaway cars never start first go. But all cop cars do. (They will also slide to a dramatic stop in the midst of a crime scene). 
<br /><br />13. If staying in a haunted house, women should investigate any strange noises wearing their most revealing underwear. 
<br /><br />14. On a police stake-out, the action will only ever take place when food is being consumed and scalding hot coffees are perched precariously on the dashboard
<br /><br />15. All grocery shopping involves the purchase of French loaves which will be placed in open brown paper bags (Caveat: when said bags break, only fruit will spill out). 
<br /><br />16. Cars never need fuel (unless they're involved in a pursuit). 
<br /><br />17. If you are heavily outnumbered in a fight involving martial arts, your opponents will wait patiently to attack you one by one by dancing around you in a threatening manner until you have defeated their predecessor. 
<br /><br />18. If a microphone is turned on it will immediately feedback. 
<br /><br />19. Guns are like disposable razors. If you run out of bullets, just throw the gun away. you will always find another one. 
<br /><br />20. All single women have a cat. 
<br /><br />21. Cars will explode instantly when struck by a single bullet. 
<br /><br />22. No matter how savagely a spaceship is attacked, its internal gravity system is never damaged. 
<br /><br />23. If being chased through a city you can usually take cover in a passing St Patrick's Day parade - at any time of the year. 
<br /><br />24. The ventilation system of any building is the perfect hiding place. Nobody will ever think of looking for you in there and you can travel to any other part of the building undetected. 
<br /><br />25. You will survive any battle in any war UNLESS you show someone a picture of your sweetheart back home. 
<br /><br />26. Prostitutes always look like Julia Roberts or Jamie Lee Curtis. They have expensive clothes and nice apartments but no pimps. They are friendly with the shopkeepers in their neighbourhood who don't mind at all what the girl does for a living. 
<br /><br />27. A single match is usually sufficient to light up a room the size of a football stadium. 
<br /><br />28. It is not necessary to say &quot;Hello&quot; or &quot;Goodbye&quot; when beginning a telephone conversation. A disconnected call can always be restored by frantically beating the cradle and saying &quot;Hello? Hello?&quot; repeatedly. 
<br /><br />29. One man shooting at 20 men has a better chance of killing them all than 20 men firing at once (this is known as Stallone's Law). 
<br /><br />30. When you turn out the light to go to bed, everything in you room will still be visible, just slightly bluish. 
<br /><br />31. Plain or even ugly girls can become movie star pretty simply by removing their glasses and rearranging their hair. 
<br /><br />32. Rather than wasting bullets, megalomaniacs prefer to kill their enemies with complicated devices incorporating fuses, pulleys, deadly gases, lasers and man-eating sharks. 
<br /><br />33. All beds have special L-shaped sheets that reach to armpit level on a woman but only up to the waist of the man lying beside her. 
<br /><br />34. Anyone can land a 747 as long as there is someone in the control tower to talk you down. 
<br /><br />35. During all police investigations it will be necessary to visit a strip club at least once. 
<br /><br />36. You can always find a chainsaw when you need one. 
<br /><br />37. Most musical instruments (especially wind instruments and accordions) can be played without moving your fingers. 
<br /><br />38. In Middle America, all gas station attendants have red handkerchiefs hanging out of their back pockets. 
<br /><br />39. All teen house parties have one of every stereotypical subculture present (even people who aren't liked and would never get invited to parties).
<br /><br />40. All aliens speak fluent english in cartoons
<br /><br />41. In films aliens and their craft only land in America.
<br /><br />42. During a time-bomb countdown thats supposed to last 10 seconds a movie can last up to 10 minutes.
<br /><br />43. Men will never act hurt when taking a serious beating, but when a girl is cleaning the wounds, they whine helplessly
