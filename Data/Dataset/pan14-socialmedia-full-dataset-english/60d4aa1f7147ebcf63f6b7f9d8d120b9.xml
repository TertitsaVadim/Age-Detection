<br /><br />click on the title for image description. 
<br /><br />“Publisher cannot be verified” error – “Unknown Publisher”
<br /><br />Description:
<br /><br />This is the result of Microsoft trying to protect users from malicious programs. The message will appear for any shortcut or executable that is hosted on a network share. The reason why you get the warning in the first place is because the windows new feature called Attachment Manager. This feature was added to help protect your computer from unsafe file attachments. This include accessing files across your network (e.g servernameshare), files that you might receive with an e-mail message and from unsafe files that you might save from the Internet.
<br /><br />If the Attachment Manager identifies an attachment that might be unsafe, the Attachment Manager prevents you from opening the file, or it warns you before you open the file.
<br /><br />Here are the steps to bypass the warning using Attachment Manager Group Policy. Also we have included the registry key modified by the policy.
<br /><br />Workaround 1:
<br /><br />From Start Run type: gpedit.msc
<br /><br />From User Configuration&gt; Administrative Template&gt; Windows Components&gt; Attachment Manager
<br /><br />Set the following:
<br /><br />Configuration Settings:
<br /><br />&gt; Default risk level for file attachments: Set it to Enabled and Set the default risk level to[Low Risk]
<br /><br />&gt; Inclusion list for low file types: Set it to Enabled and add the file extension [.exe;.vbs;.msi]
<br /><br />&gt; Do not preserve zone information in file attachments: Set it to Enabled.
<br /><br />Close Gpedit.msc and run gpupdate /force
<br /><br />Screenshot:
<br /><br />Publisher cannot be verified error Unknown Publisher
<br />Final Step:
<br /><br />&gt; Add the UNC to Local Intranet or Trusted Sites
<br /><br />&gt; Log off and log back in
<br /><br />&gt; Test accessing the UNC share
<br /><br />Registry keys:
<br /><br />[HKEY_CURRENT_USERSoftwareMicrosoftWindowsCurrentVersionPolicies]
<br /><br />[HKEY_CURRENT_USERSoftwareMicrosoftWindowsCurrentVersionPoliciesAssociations]
<br /><br />“LowRiskFileTypes”=”.exe;.vbs;.msi”
<br /><br />“DefaultFileTypeRisk”=dword:00001808
<br /><br />[HKEY_CURRENT_USERSoftwareMicrosoftWindowsCurrentVersionPoliciesAttachments]
<br /><br />“SaveZoneInformation”=dword:00000001
<br /><br />Workaround 2:
<br /><br />This is the preferred way:
<br /><br />First, determine what server the shortcut is hosted on. For our example we will allow only shortcuts that are pointing to server1 to be launched without the warning.
<br /><br />Open Internet Explorer.
<br /><br />Click on Tools, then Internet Options. Click on the Security tab.
<br /><br />Once you are on this tab. Make sure you first click “Local Intranet”, and then the “Sites” button should light up. Click it.
<br /><br />Publisher cannot be verified error Unknown Publisher
<br /><br />On the form that is displayed, click Advanced
<br /><br />Publisher cannot be verified error Unknown Publisher
<br /><br />You will be shown a list of sites that are in the “Local Intranet”
<br /><br />To add your server to the list. Type file://server where ‘server’ is the name of your server. We will put server1 here
<br /><br />Publisher cannot be verified error Unknown Publisher
<br /><br />Click on Add.
<br /><br />Click OK, on the rest of the dialogs to get out of the settings for Internet Explorer.
