ArgonzaSource: http://www.oldandsold.com/articles29/mythology-14.shtmlA still more characteristic version is told in Celebes. Seven brothers were hunting and drying the meat of the pigs which they had killed, but, as in one of the trickster tales, a man appeared who stole the food and made away with it, the brother who had been left on guard being unable to stop him. When the turn of the youngest came, he succeeded in spearing the robber in the back, but the culprit ran off and disappeared with the spear still sticking in him. Now the spear belonged to the boys' grandfather, who, angry at its loss, demanded that they find it and return it." The brothers, therefore, went to a great hole in the earth, from which, they had discovered, the robber usually emerged. Taking a long vine, the others lowered the eldest, but he, soon terrified at the darkness, demanded to be hauled up again; and thus it went with all six older brothers, only the youngest being brave enough to reach the bottom. Once arrived, he found himself in the underworld and there soon discovered a town. Asking if he might come in, he was refused admittance on the ground that the chief was suffering from a great spear with which he had been wounded, and which was still embedded in his back. The young hero thereupon declared that he could cure the sufferer and was accordingly admitted to the chief's house; but when he was alone with the patient, he killed him, pulled out the spear, and hastened to regain the place where he had been let down. On the way he met seven beautiful maidens who wished to accompany him to the upper world, and so all were pulled up together by the brothers stationed above, and each of them then took one of the girls for his wife. The occurrence of this tale in Japan," and on the north-west coast of America 18 is a feature of considerable interest.REFLECTION‘7 brothers’ theme is hereby narrated, akin to those of related ethnicities. ‘7 brothers’ signifies 7 racial families of a sub-race, 7 ethnic communities of a racial family, likewise 7 sub-races of a ‘root race’.Let us take our case as that of 7 ethnic groups who comprise a larger group approximating a race. These ethnicities encountered another set of humans, who were of the ‘underworld’ where supposedly a ‘town’ was discovered.In this myth, the ethnicities involved were the ones in the ‘above’ world, who had to travel down the ‘underworld’ via ‘vines’ which signify the silver cord. It’s a case here of higher subtle bodies doing reconnaissance in more dense worlds, where they discovered the presence of other peoples.‘Underworld’ could also signify the ‘inner space’ of mankind, where hidden are ‘robbed’ objects—meaning, the treasures of wisdom and knowledge. This space if often the place of retreat of any Adept during sessions of meditations, and in that space the same Adept can retrieve knowledge from the Akashic records (4th plane records).The descent from a higher world to a lower or ‘under’ world also signifies the devolution of ancient human souls down to the more denser planes, such as the physical plane. Breeding new pedigrees or ethnicities were a function of descending down dense plane, after which the ascent back to the divine spheres will be traversed.[Philippines, 29 June 2011]@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@PROF.

Argonza / RaBrotherhood of Light26 September 2012Magandang araw sa inyo kapwa! Good day to you fellow!Ra, messenger & teacher, from the Darjeeling Council, forthcoming Guardian, will pronounce heraldry on education and the philosophy of schooling in this note.First of all, let it be declared, that the commercialization of education will be over soon. Promoting subjects and tertiary level courses because such programs will make money for the learner, thus ending with highly skewed programs towards the more marketable degrees, is a Big No in the New Earth.Also, the corrupted practice of using schools as for moneybag purposes will end too. I’ve seen how too many youth from poor families can’t afford to enter good basic education schools and colleges due to lack of family income to support their tuition and maintenance needs.Furthermore, the practice—perfected in the West—of using education as institutional tool for thought control, manipulation, and rendering depersonalized learners as mere cogs in the oligarchic deus ex machine, will likewise be decapitated and buried in the catacombs of evils. Thought control education will end as the context that bred it ends soon.In the reorganization of the education, which begins with rethinking the philosophy of learning, the compass of direction will move to the East. Shamballah, Himalayas, and the Etheric Retreats of Brothers of Light, largely situated in the East, are the very centers of Light that have always provided Teachers for the world at large, and so shall it be that the educational compass will move East.The ‘nirvanic agenda’, liberation of soul from fragmentation, will be foremost premise for constituting a New Education. Holistic learning, with the teachings of the Masters as the definitive metaphysical, epistemological, and axiological foundation, will be the guiding paradigm of New Education.Anticipate the radical change in the population of children & youth in the New Earth, as the Laggards and Demoniacs (negative persons) will be taken out en masse and transferred to their own respective worlds. Those persons today who stubbornly cling to their Inner Demon’s penchant for fragmented, abnormal, Mad behavior complexes, and are therefore very polarized, will be discharged from our planet too, as they are brought to the Negative Planet for the polarized types.With the laggards, demoniacs, and acutely dysfunctional/abnormals gone, education will cease to adjust to their presence. Rather, education will adjust to a more intelligent, balanced, evolved soul population. Geniuses & Gifted Minds will comprise at least 10% of New Earth people, and that percentage is bound to grow to ‘dominance’ (past 50% of population) when the 7th Root Race will emerge (in South America) tens of thousands of years from now.The accelerated system for the geniuses & gifted children of today, which is regarded as ‘special education’, will be nourished using the Eastern Masters’ holistic paradigm and methods/tools to become the ‘regular education’ of the new context. Great care will be done so as to see a balanced development of both the ‘lower principles’ and ‘higher principles’ of Man, as per mandate fiats in the Wisdom of the Brothers.Higher Principles• Atma (Self): Wisdom, will, love, Divine enlightenment• Buddhi (Pure Reason): Perfecting esthetics (arts, creatives, esthetic appreciation) and intuitive development• Manas (Concrete Mind): Logical-analytic development, blended with linguistic intelligence developmentLower Principles• Prana/Chi (Vital Energy): Yoga as Meditation & centering tools (taught as early as basic education)• Desire: Tempering Desire as basis of Needs• Astral: Emotional development, harmonic feelings, empathy development• Physical: Physical culture, physical careThat told, dear ascension enthusiasts, get ready for the exciting educational paradigm & practices of the near future. Lifespan will be very long, so do begin to gear up for retooling and setting a learning agenda that includes finishing as many doctorate degree equivalents as possible. And, in the process, get yourself nearer the cross border line to the Buddhic mind that renders you nearer to becoming spiritual masters whose Atma is awakened.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@PROF.

ArgonzaSource: http://www.oldandsold.com/articles29/mythology-14.shtmlA story of quite wide distribution is that of the half-child. According to the Loda version, the first man and woman lived by a river, on whose banks they had a garden. A boy was born to them, but later, when a second child was about to be brought into the world, a great rain and flood came and washed away half of the garden, whereupon the woman cursed the rain, the result of her malediction being that when the child was born, it was only half a human being and had but one eye, one arm, and one leg. When Half-Child had grown up, he said to his mother, "Alas, what shall I do, so that I may be like my brother, who has two arms and two legs?" Determining to go to the great deity in the upper world. and beg him to make him whole, he climbed up and laid his request before the god, who, after some discussion, agreed to help him, telling him to bathe in a pool which he showed him, and at the same time cautioning him not to go into the water if he saw any one else bathing. Half-Child went to the pool, found no one else there, and after bathing came out restored to his proper shape and made very handsome.Returning to his home, he found his brother eating his dinner, and the latter said to him, "Well, brother, you look very beautiful!" "Yes," said Half-Child, "the deity, granted me to be even as you are." Then his elder brother asked, "Is the god far away?" and the other replied, "No, he is not far, for I was able to reach him easily." The elder brother at once went up to see the divinity, and when asked why he had come, he said that he wished to be made as handsome as his younger brother. The deity replied, "No, you are now just as you ought to be, and must remain so"; but since the other would not be satisfied, at length the god said, "Well, go to that pool there and bathe; but you must not do so unless you see a dog (i. e. the image or reflection of a dog) in it, in which case you must bathe with a piece of white cloth tied round your neck." So the elder brother went to the pool, tied a piece of cloth around his neck, and bathed, and behold! he was turned into a dog with a white mark around his throat; whereupon he returned to this world and found his brother, Half-Child, at dinner. "Alas!" said the younger brother, "I told you not to go, but you would do so, and now see what has become of you!" and he added, "Here, my brother, you must always remain under my table and eat what falls from it."REFLECTIONThe process of anthropogenesis in the mythos curiously seems like processes in the Initiation of a disciple into Adeptship. One begins with a stage of ‘half-child’ and then mutates into a ‘full child’. Surely intriguing a mythos.Going to the start of the narrative, it narrates first of the sexed humans of the mid-Lemurian aegis (‘man and woman’). They ‘lived by a river’, referring to the hydrological societies of antiquity who thrived on water systems. That was when humans were still a bit higher in vibratory frequency than today.Those ancients were still in touch with the higher dimensions, signified by the ‘garden’. That is the same ‘garden of Eden’ in Semitic myth. The ancients described bred two (2) races, the first and second. The second race evolved at a time of a great flood, which refers to possible polar shift and consequent inundations in antiquity.‘Half child’ signifies the gross state that happened to the affected race. They were of incomplete breeding and enculturation, and so were described as ‘half child’. Yet they were able to restore their looks and even looked handsome, which indicates the recovery of culture and relative civility after the flood.The ancients were also in touch with the great deity, which is another indicator of their access to higher dimension then. Their paranormal faculties were pretty much working, in other words.The narrative ends with the other race becoming a slave of those who recovered from the trauma of the floods. The earlier race or ethnicities turned out to be primitive, ‘became a dog’ which signifies their docility and tendency for subordination to a more cultured group.[Philippines, 29 June 2011]@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@PROF.

<br /><br />Erle Frayne D. Argonza / Ra
<br />Brotherhood of Light</strong>
<br /><br />28 September 2012
<br /><br />Kapayapaan at kaluwalhatian! Peace and harmony!
<br /><br />Ra, messenger &amp; teacher, from the Darjeeling Council of the Brotherhood, forthcoming Guardian, will elucidate further on the subject of education for the New Earth. 
<br /><br />As already discussed previously, spiritual Masters from the East will provide the directional compass of tomorrow’s education. This being so, let me elaborate more about the Masters’ thoughts on reorganizing education to fit into the emerging context of a planet governed by the Ascended Host: the Christed Ones of the Brotherhood of Light. 
<br /><br />For this note, I will advance the contention that the 7 Rays of Godhead must be a core guidepost for the forthcoming education. 7 Rays—representing 7 traits of Atma (Self)—will be the thematic attributional content guiding the methods and tools aimed at developing the 7 Principles of Man for each member of the New Earth society. 
<br /><br />The 7 Rays are as follows: 
<br /><br />1st Ray: Enlightened Power
<br />Trait: Will
<br />Learning Goals: Strengthen one’s own Will as emanation of Divine Will. Forge stronger courage, leadership, initiative, organizational acumen. 
<br /><br />2nd Ray: Wisdom
<br />Trait: Contemplative/Intellect
<br />Learning Goals: Study the Wisdom lessons (from the spiritual masters). Build Virtues, deprogram Vices. 
<br /><br />3rd Ray: Love
<br />Trait: Devotion/Faith
<br />Learning Goals: Conduct bhakti (devotion) to sustain devotion to the Supreme Being. Develop Universal Brotherhood, expressed as mutual devotion among members of society. 
<br /><br />4th Ray: Arts
<br />Trait: Craftsmanship
<br />Learning Goals: Learn and practice a craft/profession, bring it to the highest level of perfection. Grasp principles and practices of esthetics, learn from the masters of arts, till you profess prowess in at least one art form.
<br /><br />5th Ray: Science
<br />Trait: Knowing
<br />Learning Goals: Grasp the maximum knowledge of the laws of objective world (i.e. cosmic laws), in theory and practice. Learn self-knowing principles and tools, develop strong self-insight. 
<br /><br />6th Ray: Service
<br />Trait: Service (for Others)
<br />Learning Goals: Practice the Golden Rule via service works for community, humanity, Mother Nature, Divinity. Forge habits of sharing and giving in various aspects of life. 
<br /><br />7th Ray: Alchemy or Ceremonial Magic
<br />Trait: Synthesis
<br />Learning Goals: Study the science of Yoga, develop inner balance. Learn tools for centering, healing, energizing, self-integration. 
<br /><br />So what’s the rationale behind the 7 Rays as guideposts? To build and strengthen all the 7 traits in each member of society and no less. 
<br /><br />In the very ancient times, we were projected from the mind of the Almighty One Universal Principle (God), wielding the potentialities to become one of the 7 Rays during our evolutionary sojourn. 7 classes of human souls were therefore evolved from the Divine Mind, all complementing each other’s strengths in the lifeworld. 
<br /><br />The time for over-specializing in a certain Ray is now done though. Mankind is now on the upward ascending arc of his/her evolution, so it is necessary to build a higher level of awareness precisely by strengthening all of the 7 Rays in all souls on Terra. 
<br /><br />No less than the Ascended Masters have demonstrated the possibility of an Oversoul that is strong in all of the 7 traits as inspired by the 7 Rays of Godhead. While one particular Ray may be strong in a Christed One, still it is a fact-of-being that the said master is also strong in the rest of the 7 Rays. 
<br /><br />Since Terra is going back to God’s hands again soon, then let everyone be accustomed to following the Ascended Beings—the enforcers of God’s fiats—as their models in life. And so will it be that the Ascended Masters, the Brothers &amp; Sisters of Light, will reconstitute our educational compass on the basis of the 7 Rays that they have successfully demonstrated as doable in the real world.

<br /><br />Erle Frayne D. Argonza / Ra
<br /></strong>

<br />Tales which involve themes of the &quot;grateful animals&quot; and the &quot;impossible tasks&quot; are quite common; and as an example of one type of these we may take a Dusun story from British North Borneo. Serungal was an ugly man, but he wished very much to marry a rajah's daughter. On his way to the village of the rajah he saw some men killing an ant, but when he remonstrated with them, they ran away and left the insect, which crawled off in safety. A little farther on Serungal heard some people shouting and found that they were trying to kill a fire-fly, whose life he saved in the same manner as he had that of the ant; and before he reached the rajah's gate he also rescued a squirrel. Arrived before the rajah, Serungal made known to him that he had come to ask for the hand of one of his daughters; but since the rajah did not want him for a son-in-law, he said to him, &quot;If you can pick up the rice which is in this basket, after it has been scattered over the plain, you may have my daughter.&quot; Serungal thought that he could not succeed in this impossible task, for the rajah allowed him only a short time to complete it; but nevertheless he determined to try, only to find that achievement was hopeless. He began to weep, but soon an ant came to him, and learning the reason of his lamentation, said, &quot;Well, stop crying, and I will help you, for you helped me when men wished to kill me,&quot; and accordingly the ant called his companions, who quickly sought and gathered the grains of rice, so that the basket soon was full once more. When Serungal carried the receptacle to the rajah and announced that he had accomplished the task, the latter said, &quot;Well, you may have my daughter, but first you must climb my betel-nut tree and pluck all the nuts.&quot; Now this tree was so tall that its top was lost in the clouds, and Serungal, after several vain attempts, sat at the foot of the tree, weeping. To him then came the squirrel whom he had befriended, and in gratitude for the aid which Serungal had given him it climbed the tree for him and brought down all the nuts. The rajah had one more task, however, for Serungal to accomplish, telling him that he might have his youngest daughter if he could pick her out from among her six other sisters when all were shut up in a perfectly dark room. Serungal again was in despair when the fire-fly came to him and said, &quot;I will search for you and I will settle on the nose of the seventh daughter; so wherever you see a light, that will be the place where the rajah's youngest daughter is.&quot; 22 Accordingly Serungal went into the darkened room, and seeing the fire-fly, carried away the woman on whom it had settled; whereupon the rajah admitted Serungal's success and thus was obliged to recognize him as his son-in-law 23 Tales of this type present such close analogies to Indian and wide-spread European types that it is probable that they are directly or indirectly due to Hindu contact. 
<br />REFLECTION
<br /><br />The lore projects two themes: (a) strong affinity and synergy with the animal world; and, (<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cool.gif" alt=":)" /> virtues arising from such affinity.
<br /><br />Early humans had the greatest affinity with the nature world and respected all of its endowments—mineral, vegetative, animal. Necessarily, they were also held strong affinity and synergy with the devic world, the world of devas and elementals who were tasked to aid in the growth &amp; development of creatures of nature. 
<br /><br />The cherished reward of marrying the daughter of a rajah is the goal. That goal is no simple aim to achieve, as it involves the demonstration of dharma or virtues. Surprisingly, a virtuous persons’ demonstration of dharma vis a vis the animal world can also have its corresponding reward of being aided by the animals whom the person helped. 
<br /><br />The synergy with the animal world is still around with us—among peasants, fisherfolks, indigenous peoples most especially. Yet even at home we have this care for pets and greening of our homes. Both pets and gardens at home help to create the balance and harmony, the principles of which Theos Sophia fully support. 
<br /><br />Our affinity with the animal world didn’t evolve in time, but on the contrary has been waning with time. Absolute Evil at the end phase of the 5th root-race of Aryans holds sway so potently as to see humanity get alienated from the nature world, the ecological costs being the repercussions suffered by the entire planet.

<br /><br />Erle Frayne D. Argonza / Ra
<br />Brotherhood of Light</strong>
<br /><br />30 September 2012
<br /><br />Peace &amp; Light unto thee!
<br /><br />Ra, messenger &amp; teacher, staff at the Darjeeling Council, forthcoming Guardian, will shed light on the conduct of instruction as the teaching method in the New Earth. 
<br /><br />To begin with, let us reflect on the education of the current context, which is still largely a mass production kind of instruction. To induce efficiencies of scale, given the scarcity of teachers/professors, crowd the classrooms with pupils/students. An evenness of instruction is applied, along a temporal track of ladder-like movement from one year level to another. 
<br /><br />The context is changing, and will in fact be so radically altered soon enough. Efficiencies of scale and profits for school owners will be catacomb stuff as rationale for schools’ and universities’ existence. Instruction will rather move closer to the individualized instruction that is available from spiritual masters, graduate school classes, and a few basic education schools to boot. 
<br /><br />That step-by-step, year-by-year promotion of pupils/students was deconstructed by Paulo Freire as ‘banking system’ in his famed book Pedagogy of the Oppressed. The critique of the old system stays, as its premises and contentions are still valid till these days. So the relevant byline for education agenda is: No to both mass production and ‘banking system’ education!
<br /><br />I do recall, as a grassroots worker and social activist, how my mind and people skills were nurtured by our version of popular education or ‘pop ed’ in the ‘70s and ‘80s. That version of ‘pop ed’ in PH stuck with me, and I have since been using it in my spiritual instruction for seekers and classroom instruction for university students. It was our version of departing from our largely AngloSaxon ‘banking system’ education introduced to Filipinos by the Americans 11 decades ago. 
<br /><br />So, to advance our proposition a bit, classroom classes across all levels will follow the optimal sizes of no more than fifteen (15) for basic education up through tertiary level. The current system of having just a maximum of ten (10) in graduate school stays, and the lesser the class size the better.
<br /><br />Unless the contingencies merit it, we will not nor ever again replicate the stinking Great Man pedagogy of the West, where a single professor is given over 100 students to lecture to in a single class. Supposedly, the rationale is to maximize on the vast talents of the professor. This herd-type instruction erases every notion of individualized instruction that small class sizes can offer. 
<br /><br />Perhaps during a transition period, which we won’t discount, due to lack of classrooms and qualified teachers/professors, classes may have to begin with huge Herds. But this will only last during the transition, and will no more be practiced as soon as new teachers and professors are trained, while new state-of-the-art education infrastructures are built and operated. 
<br /><br />That is, small class sizes induce participation, synergy, open-mindedness, enthusiasm, and creativeness on the part of both pupils/students and teacher. The emotional, social, and non-cognitive growth needs of the respective student can be observed and responded to by the qualified teacher who is presumably a high empathy person. Team-building will also emerge from it, thus ensuring mutual help among the students, aside from building self-help for each student. 
<br /><br />Since, as already adduced to, geniuses will go up by several percentages of the population, then the accelerated type instruction will be re-tooled and adjusted to suit the needs of the geniuses and/or starseeds. From among these geniuses and gifted minds will rise the prospective teachers and professors whose high innovativeness will count a lot in educating the youth of the New Earth.  
<br /><br />Note that there also are adults in the New Earth who missed out on tertiary and graduate school. Special education will be offered to re-tool and orient the said adults to the new education, and encourage them to continue with their education, given the very long life span ahead of them. 
<br /><br />Likewise will special education be designed for tomorrow’s youth and adults who missed out on certain levels of their basic education and were stuck up at that level. Remember, there is no room for laggard behavior in the New Earth, as each person must strive to access to their higher minds, an access that the new education can offer ample tools and methods for accelerated development.
<br /><br />Classroom as used here isn’t a fixed thing, to note. Innovativeness means a teacher must combine classroom with off-classroom, on-line, and related methods. So if class management reached a certain level of excitement for the teacher and administrators of today, so shall it all the more be exciting in the coming 21,000-year New Age of Light.

<br /><br />Erle Frayne D. Argonza</strong>
<br /><br />The tale contained herein is among the standard lores that depict women of supernatural origin who supposedly provided beneficence to persons in need. Broadly, such tales signify humanity’s affinity with the devic world—of devas (architect of forms) &amp; elementals (materializers of forms)—during antiquity. 
<br /><br />Theos Sophia or divine wisdom declares that nothing is above nature or ‘super-natural’, for even the Spirit-Force from which we came from is well meshed with ‘mother nature’ which is the Almighty’s ‘outer garment’. Even the devic world forms a part of the totality of emanations in the nature world and not apart from or above it.
<br /><br />One truly enthralling tale concerns a lady who came from the bumble bee world. She shape-shifted to human in order to help a man in need, then married the man but with caution to the latter to observe a caveat, bore a child with him, and so on. The ‘bumble bee’ seems to signify those devas and elementals who in fact embodied as humans as part of their own evolutionary programs, and many are those ‘merman’ and ‘mermaids’ among us today.
<br /><br />Such an affinity has been lost with time, save for the folks and psychic sensitive humans who retain the faculties for sensing and relating to them. At the commencement of the 6th root-race of this present Evolutionary Round—properly called the devic-man round—that affinity and mutual respect between humans and devas/elementals will return.
<br /><br />[Philippines, 30 June 2011]
<br /><br />Source: <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.oldandsold.com%2Farticles29%2Fmythology-14.shtml"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.oldandsold.com/articles29/mythology-14.shtml</a>
<br />Widely disseminated in Indonesia, and also occurring far outside its limits, are stories based on a theme involving the miraculous providing of food by women of supernatural origin. A Bornean version may serve as an example of this type. One day a man named Rakian was out hunting for honey, when in the top of a mangis-tree he saw a number of bees' nests. The bees belonging to one of these were white, and as this was a curiosity, he selected this nest, removed it carefully, and carried it home. He spent the next day working in his garden and did not return to his house until evening; but when he entered, he found rice and fish already cooked and standing on his food-shelf above the fire. &quot;Who can have cooked for me?&quot; he thought, &quot;for I live here alone. This fish is not mine, although the rice is. The rice is cold, and must have been cooked some time. Perhaps someone has come and cooked for me and then taken away my bees' nest.&quot; On going to look, however, he found his bees' nest still where he had left it; so he sat down and ate, saying, &quot;Well, if someone is going to cook for me, so much the better.&quot; In the morning he went off again to his garden, and when he came back at night, there was his food already cooked as before; and this continued for some time until one day he resolved to return early to see if he could not solve the mystery. Accordingly he set off as if to go to his garden and then quietly came back and hid himself where he could watch. By and by the door of the house creaked, and a beautiful woman came out and went to the river to get water; but while she was gone, Rakian entered the house and looking at his bees' nest found that there were no bees in it. So taking the nest and hiding it, he secreted himself in the house; and after a while the woman re-turned and went to the place where the nest had been. &quot;Oh,&quot; said she, weeping, &quot;who has taken my box? It cannot be Rakian, for he has gone to his garden. I am afraid he will come back and find me.&quot; When it was evening, Rakian came out as if he had just returned from his garden, but the woman sat there silent. &quot;Why are you here?&quot; said he; &quot;perhaps you want to steal my bees?&quot; but the woman answered, &quot;I don't know anything about your bees.&quot; Rakian went to look for his bees' nest, but of course could not find it, for he had hidden it away; whereupon he again accused her of taking his honey, while she denied all knowledge of it. &quot;Well, never mind,&quot; said he; &quot;will you cook for me, for I am hungry?&quot; She, how-ever, replied that she did not wish to cook, for she was vexed; and then she taxed Rakian with having taken her box, which, she said, contained all her clothes; but he replied that he would not give it to her because he was afraid that she would get into it again. &quot;I will not get into it,&quot; said she. &quot;If you like me, you can take me for your wife. My mother wished to give me to you in this way, for you have no wife here, and I have no husband in my country.&quot; Accordingly Rakian gave her the bees' nest, and the woman then said, &quot;If you take me as your wife, you must never call me a bee-woman, for if you do I shall be ashamed.&quot; Rakian promised, and so they were married; and by and by his wife bore him a child. Now one day there was a feast at a neighbour's, to which Rakian went as a guest; but when the people asked him where his wife had come from, as they had never before seen so beautiful a woman, he replied evasively. After a while, however, all the men got drunk, and then, when they kept asking him where his wife had come from, he forgot his promise and said, &quot;The truth is my wife was at first a bee.&quot; 
<br />When Rakian got home, his wife was silent and would not speak to him, but after a while she said, &quot;What did I tell you long ago? I think you have been saying things to make me ashamed.&quot; Her husband denied that he had said anything wrong, but she insisted, declaring, &quot;You are lying, for though you were far away, I heard what you said,&quot; whereupon Rakian was silent in his turn. &quot;I shall now go to my home,&quot; said she, &quot;but the child I will leave with you. In seven days my father will pass by here, and I shall go with him.&quot; Rakian wept, but could not move her, and seven days later he saw a white bee flying by, whereupon his wife came out of the house, and saying, &quot;There is my father,&quot; she turned into a bee once more and flew away, while Rakian hurried into the house, seized the child, and hastened off in pursuit. For seven days he followed the bees, and then losing sight of them, found himself on the banks of a stream where he lay down with the child and slept. By and by a woman came from a house near by, woke him, and said, &quot;Rakian, why don't you go to your wife's house, and sleep there? The house is not far off.&quot; &quot;When I have bathed, you must show me the way,&quot; said he, and she replied, &quot;Very well&quot;; so they went, and the woman pointed his wife's house out to him. &quot;Her room is right in the middle. There are eleven rooms in the house. If you enter, you must not be afraid, for the roof-beams are full of bees, but they do not attack men.&quot; Accordingly Rakian climbed up into the house and found it full of bees, but in the middle room there were none. The child began to cry, whereupon a voice from the middle room asked, &quot;Why do you not come out? Have you no pity on your child, that is weeping here?&quot; Then, after a time, Rakian's wife appeared, and the child ran to her, and Rakian's heart was glad; but his wife said to him, &quot;What did I tell you at first, that you were not to tell whence I came? If you had not been able to follow me here, certainly there would have been distress for you.&quot; When she finished speaking, all the bees dropped down from the roof-beams to the floor and became men; while as for Rakian and his child, they stayed in the bees' village and did not go back any more.

<br /><br />Erle Frayne D. Argonza / Ra
<br />Brotherhood of Light </strong>
<br /><br />02 October 2012
<br /><br />Kapayapaan at Pag-ibig! Peace and Love!
<br /><br />This White Robe, messenger &amp; teacher, forthcoming Guardian, will focus on the thematic content and ‘elevative’ purpose of arts for this note. 
<br /><br />For the entire duration of the Kali Yuga, there has been an observed cycle across two extremes: (a) outerworldly arts and (<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cool.gif" alt=":)" /> sensate arts.  Prof. Ptirim Sorokin, in his book Crisis of Our Age, was able to capture this pattern in his circular-cyclical model of culture across the epochs. 
<br /><br />As the Old Earth ends, art themes have already degenerated to the most sensate state conceivable. This state I would prefer to label as Primal-Demonic, whereby the arts portray the grossest, densest attachments to Desire. Even those purportedly sweet music that are of pop music genres (e.g. pop/ballad, jazz fusion, mellow rock) project fixations to emotions, i.e. to the Sensate. 
<br /><br />The Demonic Mind is on the ascendant during the terminal phase of the Old Earth. I already elaborated on the degenerative mind elsewhere. This degenerative Mind has direct bearing on the art forms and content of the present, arts that were promoted by business interests for money and fame. 
<br /><br />Incidentally, there are very daring souls who introduced out-of-the-box arts that are counter-currents to the Primal-Demonic. Renaissance arts and classical music were the first of those daring art movements, arts that were actually led by spiritual masters embodied as masters of art. 
<br /><br />In the field of music, there are those artists who fused tribal-ethnic instruments and tunes with modern music to constitute World Music beats. New Age Music and its close kin Nature Music have also been daringly released by independent artists who began as underground music enthusiasts. 
<br /><br />Such musical pieces either aid to connect us to the ‘music of the spheres’ (classical music) or are aids in balancing the heart chakra (world music, new age music). Some other recent forms, coming from the East, aid in activating, cleansing, and aligning the chakras, and these are close to the World music/Nature music/New Age music forms. 
<br /><br />Those reverberations in the musical and performing arts are finding their own equivalents in the visual arts. Negative imagery in the visuals, such as those of Picasso’s, advertising arts, contemporary paintings, are being challenged by seemingly muffled voices of younger artists who are harbingers of the new Integrated Arts of the emerging context. 
<br /><br />Dangerously distorted imageries, dirty dances, primal-demonic music, and what-have-you demonisms of the Old Earth fixate end-users to the dense regions of the damned. They can wittingly or unwittingly attract Incubus/Succubus and Demons (negative elementals) to those unsuspecting persons addicted to them. 
<br /><br />Take the case of a Lady Gaga concert. Sure, a viewer can enjoy the Dionysian beats and sweetie-sweetie projections of the Gaga singer, but viewers don’t realize the concert hall as swarming with hundreds of thousands of incubus/succubus and demons. Upon going home, the negative Things will definitely follow the willing victims, will embed in the astral spaces of the viewers’ homes whom they will pester no end. 
<br /><br />There are counter-cultural artists at any rate, and they are the ones who will be entrusted by the Hierarchy to co-partner with the Masters in defining the contours and compass of the arts for the New Earth. Businesses that promoted the Primal-Demonic arts will be gone soon, replaced later by more spiritually and socially responsible promotions groups and outlets. 
<br /><br />Appreciation for the folk arts of the tribal communities, which already begun (look at the fashion accessories, world music, tattoos), will be elevated to couples of notches higher. Tribal communities will perform a strong role in bringing forth folk arts and integrated arts to the fore soon. City habitués will be taking vacations in the special regions-IPs for eco-tourism R&amp;R spiced up by tribal music, dance, fashion, handicrafts.  
<br /><br />Rest assured there’s no need to wage an Inquisition in order to confiscate and destroy those Primal-Demonic art items, or fine and jail the recalcitrant Old World minded arts consumer. We have more than enough daring trend setters and tribal communities to lead the art movements of the future world, and their works will be the ones promoted by the masters who will be around as Gatekeepers and teachers. 
<br /><br />Primal-Demonic arts will die a natural death. And we shall all celebrate that with Big Bangs of dances &amp; music, gallery exhibits, viewing of new architectural wonders, and related venues for art as soul elevation.

<br /><br />Erle Frayne D. Argonza / Ra 
<br />Brotherhood of Ligh</strong>t
<br /><br />04 October 2012
<br /><br />Magandang araw sa inyo! Good day to you!
<br /><br />For this particular note, Ra, messenger &amp; forthcoming Guardian, will focus on the subject of philosophy and its general discourse. Philosophy as of late has deteriorated to a fragmentary discourse with no particular directional compass, a situation that will be trashed to the dustbins soon.
<br /><br />For three centuries long, empiricism and logic were the dominant waves in philosophy. While the said waves were helpful in aiding scientific discovery to evolve, a trend that commenced during the termination of the 30 Years War (i.e. Treaty of Westphalia), it later deteriorated into an anti-values objectivism that was, in the main, dangerously degenerative. 
<br /><br />Positivism was the end product of the long march from British empiricism through utilitarianism and onwards through logical positivism. Metaphysics was declared as an irrelevant dead carcass, while the same positivist philosophy unabashedly proclaimed Logic—and its subsidiary Philosophy of Science—as the only correct philosophical undertaking worth pursuing. 
<br /><br />Along the way, Axiology, the study of values—and its subsidiary Ethics—was likewise declared as irrelevant and crass. Values were of no significant import to scientific undertakings, as philosophy turned into a legitimizing rampart for the conduct of scientific research undertakings. 
<br /><br />Thus, philosophy as logical positivism burned down values in the conduct of education as a whole, as even classroom instruction must turn into a non-value loading type of methodology. Value-free philosophy equals value-free science, which consequently led to value-free education. 
<br /><br />As the ethical, value-relevant ramparts of philosophy and science grew, the repressed philosophic discourses, notably western Marxism and existentialism, made radical, devastating blows on logical positivism. The said Western movements rode the search for meanings and values by more youthful generations, and they did gain points for awhile. 
<br /><br />Meantime, from the 60s onwards, the followers of Nietzsche expressed their exasperation and mass disenchantment with the failures of Enlightenment. Anti-reason became the new fashion, which deconstructed all meta-narratives such as nation, class, history, general theory, macro-discourse, and so on. A truly bizarre twist of history, as the new Nietszcheans, called post-Structuralists, actually championed the erosion of values, the dominance of Desire, and subtly declared the ascent of the Primal-Demonic in all areas of life. 
<br /><br />That is, of course, the situation of Dead End for philosophy that has been dominated by Western Thought for so long a time. Western Thought is so replete with polarities that end up unresolved, with no clear dialogue among the diverse discursive camps or paradigms. 
<br /><br />It is now the end of Western Thought, and all the more will that end be emphasized after December 21 of this year. Metaphysics and Axiology will return, though in regenerated forms that will fit the New Earth context. Eastern Thought will make a raging comeback, as it is already on the upswing in the last twenty-five (25) years of Old Earth. 
<br /><br />The ascended masters will be returning to social life on the surface of Terra again, after very long absence of nearly 900,000 years. The masters will be walking alongside mortal man again, and matter-of-factly will be administering the cities, special regions (for tribal communities), and the planetary state led by the World Leader Avatar, and so all philosophies from pure to practical will be guided by the discursive initiatives of the Christed Ones. 
<br /><br />I do realize that there are seemingly new philosophical movements, such as the ‘integral philosophy’, being churned out by Piscean writers from the West. I consider these as the last farts of the Western minds, as expressions of sighs of lamentation over the fragmentary predicament of Western philosophy in the present juncture. 
<br /><br />While the Pisceans of Western-trapped minds have their right to propagate, during this anarchic context of the Old Earth, their discursive peregrinations, we Brothers of Light have nothing to do with them. The Wisdom of the Masters will dominate the philosophic domain in the New Earth, as a way of permeating all areas of Terran life with Divine Light.

<br /><br />Erle Frayne D. Argonza / Ra
<br /></strong>
<br />The tale contained herein is a Philippines version of the previous tale circulating among the Indonesians/Borneans.
<br /><br />The feminine gender is used here as signifier of the ‘miraculous’ powers of the nature world. In Theos Sophia, ‘miracle’ is nothing to ponder about, it is as natural or follows cosmic laws, and mastery of the laws will enable any evolved soul to tap into the infinite endowments of Kosmos. 
<br /><br />The folk mind surely has a way of reducing natural laws and cosmic forces into ‘supernatural’ and ‘miracle’ discourse. Sociologically, that is a way how evolving humans make sense of phenomena and forces happening around them. Nature or natura is matter, which comes from the Latin word mater, which in turn means ‘mother’. 
<br /><br />Even the endowments of nature they anthropomorphize by projecting human attributes to them. However, the folks never made a mistake by endowing the nature and celestial bodies with consciousness, for indeed consciousness inheres from the minutest atoms to the entire Kosmos itself. 
<br /><br />[Philippines, 30 June 2011]
<br /><br />Source: <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.oldandsold.com%2Farticles29%2Fmythology-14.shtml"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.oldandsold.com/articles29/mythology-14.shtml</a>
<br />A version from the Philippines 25 adds several features of interest. &quot;`We go to take greens, sister-in-law Dinay, perhaps the siksiklat [a sort of vine, whose leaves are used for greens] will taste good. I have heard that the siksiklat is good,' said Aponibolinayen. They went to get her siksiklat. When they arrived at the place of small trees, which they thought was the place of the siksiklat, they looked. Aponibolinayen was the first who looked. As soon as she began to break off the siksiklat which she saw she did not break any more, but the siksiklat encircled and carried her up. When they reached the sky, the siksiklat placed her below the alosip-tree. She sat for a long time. Soon she heard the crowing of the rooster. She stood up and went to see the rooster which crowed. She saw a spring. She saw it was pretty; because its sands were oday and its gravel pagatpat and the top of the betel-nuttree was gold, and the place where the people step was a large Chinese plate which was gold. She was surprised, for she saw that the house was small. She was afraid and soon began to climb the betel-nut-tree, and she hid herself. 
<br />&quot;The man who owned the house, which she saw near the well, was Ini-init — the sun. But he was not in the place of his house, because he went out and went above to make the sun, because that was his work in the daytime. And the next day Aponibolinayen saw him, who went out of his house, because he went again to make the sun. And Aponibolinayen went after him to his house,. because she saw the man, who owned the house, who left. When she arrived in the house, she quickly cooked, because she was very hungry. 
<br />&quot;When she finished cooking, she took the stick used in roasting fish and cooked it, and the fish stick which she cooked became cut-up fish, because she used her magic power. When she finished to cook the fish, she took out rice from the pot, and when she had finished to take out the rice from the pot, she took off the meat from the fish. When she finished taking the fish from the pot, she ate. When she finished eating, she washed. When she finished washing, she kept those things which she used to eat, the coconut shell cup and plate, and she laid down to sleep. 
<br />&quot;When the afternoon came, Ini-init went home to his house after he finished fishing. He saw his house, which appeared as if it was burning, not slowly. He went home because it appeared as if his house was burning. When he arrived at his house, it was not burning, and he was surprised because it appeared as if there was a flame at the place of his bed. When he was in his house, he saw that which was like the flame of the fire, at the place of his bed, was a very pretty lady. 
<br />&quot;Soon he cooked, and when he had finished to cook he scaled the fish, and when he had finished scaling he cut it into many pieces, and he made a noise on the bamboo floor when he cut the fish. The woman awoke, who was asleep on his bed. She saw that the man who cut the fish was a handsome man, and that he dragged his hair. The pot she had used to cook in looked like the egg of a rooster, and he was surprised because it looked like the egg of a rooster; and the rice which she cooked was one grain of broken rice. Because of all this Ini-init was surprised, for the pot was very small with which she cooked. After Ini-init cooked, the woman vanished and she went to the leaves of the betel-nut, where she went to hide. 
<br />&quot;After Ini-init finished cooking the fish, he saw the bed, the place where the woman was sleeping, was empty. He was looking continually, but he did not find her. When he could not find her, he ate alone, and when he finished eating he washed, and when he finished washing the dishes he put away, and when he had finished putting away he went to the yard to get a fresh breath. . . . When it began to be early morning, he left his house, he who went up, because it was his business to make the sun. And Aponibolinayen went again into the house. 
<br />&quot;When it became afternoon, Ini-init went to his home, and Aponibolinayen had cooked, after which she went out to the betel-nut trees. When Ini-init arrived, he was surprised because his food was cooked, for there was no person in his house. As soon as he saw the cooked rice and the cooked fish in the dish, he took the fish and the rice and began to eat. When he had finished eating, he went to his yard to take a fresh breath and he was troubled in his mind when he thought of what had happened. He said, `Perhaps the woman, which I saw, came to cook and has left the house. Sometime I shall try to hide and watch, so that I may catch her.' He went to sleep, and when it became early morning he went to cook his food. When he had finished eating, he went again to make the sun, and Aponibolinayen went again to his house. 
<br />&quot;When the sun had nearly sunk, he sent the big star who was next to follow him in the sky, and he went home to spy on the woman. When he had nearly reached his home, he saw the house appeared as if it was burning. He walked softly when he went up the ladder. He slammed shut the door. He reached truly the woman who was cooking in the house. He went quickly and the woman said to him, `You cut me only once, so that I only cure one time, if you are the old enemy.' `If I were the old enemy, I should have cut before,' said Ini-init, and he sat near her who cooked. He took out the betel-nut, and he arranged it so that they began to chew the betel-nut, and he said, `Ala! young lady, we are going to chew, because it is bad for us to talk who do not know each other's names.' Aponibolinayen answered, `No, for if the rich man who practises magic is able to give to the rich woman who has magical power, soon there will be a sign.' Ini-init said, `No, hurry up even though we are related, for you come here if we are not related.' 
<br />&quot;He begged her, and he cut the betel-nut, which was to be chewed, which was covered with gold, and he gave it to the woman who had magical power, and they chewed. When she laid down the quid, it looked like the agate bead, which has no hole for the thread. And the quid of Ini-init looked like a square bead. 
<br />&quot;`My name is Ini-init, who often goes to travel over the world. I always stop in the afternoon. What can I do, it is my business,' he said. Aponibolinayen was next to tell her name. `My name is Aponibolinayen, who lives in Kaodanan, who am the sister of Awig,' she said, and when they had finished telling their names, both their quids looked like the agate bead, which is pinoglan, which has no hole. Ini-init said, `We are relatives, and it is good for us to be married. Do not be afraid even though you did not come here of your own accord. I go to Kaodanan,' he said. Then they married, and the sun went to shine on the world, because it was his business, and the big star also had business when it became night.&quot; 
<br />In some versions the woman who provides food miraculously is a tree-spirit, or comes from a plant or fruit; while in other stories she appears from the sea. In its distribution the tale extends eastward into Melanesia.

<br /><br />Erle Frayne D. Argonza / Ra
<br />Brotherhood of Light</strong>
<br /><br />06 October 2012
<br /><br />This White Robe extends Light &amp; Love to you all!
<br /><br />As messenger &amp; teacher, work staff of the Darjeeling Council, forthcoming Guardian, Ra will share heraldry regarding the subject of childrearing in the New Earth. 
<br /><br />Let it be declared, first of all, that parental competency is a must in the New Earth. The physical cum social context will be totally changed, thus necessitating massive retooling in the area of childrearing, from pre-natal to post-natal care of the soul who is newly birthed. 
<br /><br />Two gigantic developments in family &amp; kinship had taken place across the last 300 years, which we must all reckon with in the matter of childrearing paradigm shift and retooling. First is the decline of the extended family, while the second is the massive arrival of evolved souls who are indubitably qualified for embodiment. 
<br /><br />In regard to the decline of the extended family and the predominance of the nuclear family, sociologists have discovered the phenomenal degenerative impact of it on the self-development of children. Industrial Revolution and urbanization in particular led to the decline of the extended family, and the resultant alienation of the folks into a ‘lonely crowd’ (to borrow from David Riesmann).
<br /><br />The rapid evolvement of humans from the ‘herd mind’ to the ‘individuated mind’ necessitated a painful shift, which included the lost of the once treasured extended family kins and networks. Yet without that development, people would still be mired in the folk mind, and be subject of social control by potent extended families and clans. 
<br /><br />The challenge of the changed context is to evolve new social mechanisms that can serve as substitute for the lost extended family kins. Such as the frequent social contacts among family friends that would, in turn, lead to wider social exposure for the children. The notion of ‘second parents’ then emerged that serve as grounds for the value formation and dream-building of the young ones. 
<br /><br />Since there would be time for everything in the new context, the adult siblings should care to meet up once in awhile with each other even after they’re all with respective spouse and children. The periodic reunions can reinforce the need to shore up the ‘high touch’ requirements of the new context, as that would lead to more wholesome and balanced psyche for the children.  
<br /><br />Moving on to the next phenomenon, the massive arrival of evolved souls or Old Souls, much was already discussed by fellow White Robes and myself. A lot of these old souls are from higher dimension planets across the stars, who were volunteered by their respective spiritual Hierarchs to aid New Earth peoples in accelerating psychosocial, mental, and spiritual evolution as a whole. 
<br /><br />Just to consider that the percentage of geniuses will rise from the present 2% to at least 10% of the population among newly born, already should be signal enough for parental retooling. Following closely would be another 70% who would range from the bright normal to the very intelligent. 
<br /><br />Souls of average intelligence will be fewer. The morons, imbeciles, idiots, and borderline minded souls will disappear en toto, transferred to the planet fit for the laggards. Thus, childrearing will be a bit even across the siblings, though a new sophisticated approach is expected to efficaciously handle a population of very smart kids. 
<br /><br />The overall childrearing situation therefore demands a re-orientation of present parents and those forthcoming fathers &amp; mothers. All the more are homes expected to be friendlier to children, such as to equip the tots with their own library space and from problem-solving learning tools and materials early in life, aside from playgrounds, gardens, art production space, science quasi-lab for kids, and appropriate play items. 
<br /><br />All parents will now have greater time for their children then before, so there will be no more reason for parents to neglect ‘high touch’ childrearing through hands on learning and application of the state-of-the art principles and tools to raise balanced, well-bred, multiple intelligence smart, highly cultured, virtuous persons from among the newly arrived old souls and/or starseeds. 
<br /><br />There will be very strict implementation of the policies for childrearing. Monitoring of family management, childrearing at the center, will be done right within the neighborhood, with mechanisms set up to ensure proper parenting. Rest assured that there will be a decline if not elimination of child abuse resulting from incompetence and sociopathic parents such as we had in the Old Earth.

<br />Erle Frayne D. Argonza</strong>
<br /><br />Among the indigenous groups in the Pacific Islands come the Micronesian tales, such as this one from the Carolines. The lore speaks of the highest deity Luke-lang and exploits of one of his sons Olifat. 
<br />Such a myth has equivalents in the West notably the narrative of Odin and his son Thor. What is curiously revealed in the Carolines myth is the theme of ‘destruction of man’ that is inextricably intertwined with the history of the planet and with anthropogenesis. 
<br />The Micronesians could be remnants of the 3rd root race of Lemurians who were already largely de-programmed in antiquity, as two (2) other root-races—Atlanteans, Aryans—would precede them. Yet remnants indeed survive, and among their tales are bits and pieces of cosmogenesis, anthropogenesis, and geological changes.
<br />Interestingly, the internecine conflicts among ancient ethnicities and races are also depicted in the myth. Such conflicts are signs that the law of polarity was operating more strongly among the mid-Lemurians (beginning of sexual human reproduction, twinflame mates) who were traced as the earliest humans in this tale.

<br />Micronesia Mythology - Miscellaneous Tales
<br />Source: <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.oldandsold.com%2Farticles29%2Fmythology-18.shtml"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.oldandsold.com/articles29/mythology-18.shtml</a>
<br /><br />ONE of the most important myths or series of myths in the Carolines, outside of the more strictly cosmogonic tales, is that describing the exploits of Olofat or Olifat, the eldest son of Luke-lang, the highest deity. In the version from the central Carolines, which is here followed,' he appears as a mischievous, almost malicious, person who stands in marked contrast to his brother or brothers, who are beneficent; and it is interesting to compare this antithesis of malice and goodness with Melanesian types. 
<br />Olofat saw that one of his brothers was better than he and also more beautiful, and at this he became angry. Looking down from the sky-world and seeing two boys who had caught a couple of sharks, with which they were playing in a fish-pond, he descended to earth and gave the sharks teeth, so that they bit the hands of the children. When the boys ran home crying with pain and told their troubles to their mother, Ligoapup, who was the sister of Olofat, she asked them if they had not seen any one about, whereupon they said that they had, and that he was more handsome than any man whom they had ever beheld. Knowing that this must be her brother, Olofat, Ligoapup asked her sons where he was, and they answered, &quot;Close by the sea.&quot; She then told them to go and get the man and bring him to her, but when they reached the place where they had left him, they found only an old, grey-haired man, covered with dirt. Returning to their mother, they informed her that the man whom they had seen was no longer there; but she bade them go back and bring whomsoever they might find. Accordingly they set off, but this time they saw only a heap of filth in place of a man; and so once more they went home to their mother, who told them to return a third time. Obeying her, they questioned the filth, saying, &quot;Are you Olofat? For if you are, you must come to our mother&quot;; whereupon the pile of filth turned into a handsome man who accompanied them to Ligoapup. She said to him, &quot;Why are you such a deceiver?&quot; And Olofat replied, &quot;How so?&quot; And she _said, &quot;First, you turned yourself into a dirty old man, and then into a pile of filth.&quot; &quot;I am afraid of my father,&quot; answered Olofat. &quot;Yes,&quot; said Ligoapup, &quot;you are afraid because you gave teeth to the shark.&quot; Then Olofat replied, &quot;I am angry at Luk, for he created my brother handsomer than I am, and with greater power. I shall give teeth to all sharks, in order that they may eat men whenever canoes tip over.&quot; When Luk, who was in the sky-world, became aware of these things, he said to his wife, &quot;It would be well if Olofat came back to heaven, since he is only doing evil on earth&quot;; and his wife, Inoaeman, said, &quot;I think so, too. Otherwise he will destroy mankind, for he is an evil being.&quot; 
<br />Accordingly Luk ordered the people of the sky-world to build a great house, and when it was finished, he not only commanded that a feast be announced, but also had a large fish-basket prepared, in which they placed Olofat and sank him in the sea. After five nights, when they thought he would be dead, two men went in a canoe and hauled up the basket; but behold! it contained only a multitude of great fish, for Olofat had slipped away and seated himself in a canoe near by. The men asked him, &quot;Who are you?&quot; And he replied, &quot;I am Olofat. Come here, and I will help you to put the fish into your boat.&quot; Taking one fish after the other, he handed them to the men, but in so doing he removed all the flesh of the fish and gave the men merely the empty skins. For himself he kept nothing but the smallest ones; and when the people said, &quot;Why is it that you take only the little fish?&quot; Olofat replied, 
<br />&quot;Give Luk all the big ones; I am quite satisfied with the little ones.&quot; Then the people brought the catch to Luk, who asked them, &quot;Where is the fish-basket? Who took the fish out?&quot; When they replied, &quot;Olofat did that, but has again placed the basket in the sea,&quot; Luk said, &quot;Has he then taken no fish for himself?&quot; to which they answered, &quot;Only the very smallest ones.&quot; Luk now ordered all sorts of food to be prepared for the feast and commanded that the fishes should be cooked; and when all were gathered in the house, while Olofat sat at the entrance, Luk said, &quot;Let every one now eat. Let the food be divided, and let each receive his share.&quot; Nevertheless, Olofat refused to receive any; and when the guests took up the fish, lo! there were only the empty skins, and within was nothing, so that they had to content themselves with fruit. 
<br />Olofat, however, ate his own fish; but Luk said, &quot;See, we have nothing, whereas Olofat is able to eat his own fish, and is still not finished with them.&quot; Thereupon he became very angry and sent word to Thunder to destroy Olofat; but since Thunder lived in a house at a distance, Luk said, &quot;Take Thunder some food.&quot; So one of the gods took some of the viands in order to carry them, but Olofat, snatching them from him, himself carried .them to Thunder; and on arriving at the house, he called out, &quot;O Thunder, I bring food.&quot; Now Thunder had found a white hen, and coming out, he thundered; but though Luk cried, &quot;Kill him,&quot; and though Thunder blazed, Olofat merely placed his hand before his eyes. Nevertheless, Thunder followed him and thundered again and again behind him; but from under his mantle Olofat took some coco-nut milk which he had brought with him, and sprinkling it upon Thunder, he quenched the lightning. After this he seized Thunder and bore him back to his own home; and when Olofat had returned to the feast house, Luk said, &quot;Why has the man not been killed?&quot; Notwithstanding this, Olofat again took his place by the door, while Luk now ordered another of the gods to take food to Anulap. Thereupon Olofat stood up and walked along behind the one who carried the food and he took the viands away from him, saying, &quot;I myself will take the food to Anulap.&quot; So he went to the god and said, &quot;Here are viands for you&quot;; and then he turned about and came back to the great assembly house, whereupon Luk said to Anulap, &quot;Why have you not killed the man?&quot; Then Anulap took his great hook, which was fastened to a strong rope, and throwing it at Olofat, he caught him around the neck; but Olofat quickly seized a mussel-shell and cut the rope, after which he hastened to the house of Anulap, where he sat down upon the threshold. When Anulap saw him, he seized his club to strike Olofat; but as he stretched it out, the latter changed himself into a wooden mortar. Thereupon Anulap called, &quot;Where is Olofat?&quot; and his wife, answering, &quot;He must have run away,&quot; they lay down and slept. After all this Luk said, &quot;We can do nothing with Olofat; I believe he cannot die. Go, O Laitian, and tell the people to come in the morning to make a porch for the house.&quot; When the people had come and asked how they should construct the porch, Luk said, &quot;Go to the forest and bring great tree-trunks&quot;; and when this was done, and the tree-trunks were laid by the house, Luk commanded, &quot;Now, go and fetch Olofat.&quot; Olofat came and said, &quot;I shall go, too&quot;; but Luk replied, &quot;You must aid us to build the porch. You must make three holes in the ground, two shallow and one deep; and in these the tree-trunks must be set.&quot; Accordingly Olofat dug three holes, but in each of them he made an excavation at one side; after which Luk asked, &quot;Olofat, are you ready yet?&quot; Thereupon Olofat, taking a nut and a stone, secreted them in his girdle; and Luk said, &quot;Now set the tree-trunks in the holes.&quot; In obedience to this, three men seized the upper end, while Olofat grasped the lower part; and they pushed Olofat so that he fell into the hole, only to creep quickly into the space which he had made on the side. Not knowing this, however, they then raised the tree-trunk high, and dropping it into the hole, they made it firm with earth and stone. 
<br />All now believed that Olofat had been caught under the great post and had been crushed to death. He, however, sat in his hole on the side, and being hungry five nights later, he cracked the nut with the stone which he had brought with him and ate it; whereupon ants came, and taking the fragments which had fallen to the ground, they carried the food along the trunk to the surface, going in long rows. The man who sat in the house above, seeing this, said to his wife, &quot;Olofat is dead, for the ants are bringing up parts of his body&quot;; but when Olofat heard the speech of the man, he turned, him-self into an ant and crept with the others up the post.' Having climbed high, he allowed himself to drop upon the body of the man, who pushed the ant off, so that it fell to the ground, where it was immediately changed into Olofat. As soon as the people saw him, they sprang up in fear, and Olofat said, &quot;What are you talking about?&quot; When Luk beheld him, he said, &quot;We have tried in every possible way to kill you, but it seems that you cannot die. Bring me Samenkoaner.&quot; After Samenkoaner had come and sat down, Luk asked him, &quot;How is it that Olofat cannot die? Can you kill him?&quot; To this Samenkoaner replied, &quot;No, not even if I thought about it for a whole night long, could I find a means; for he is older than I.&quot; Thereupon Luk said, &quot;But I do not wish that he should destroy all men upon the earth&quot;; and so the Rat, Luk's sister, advised that they should burn Olofat. Accordingly they made a great fire, to which they brought Olofat; but he had with him a roll of coco-nut fibre, and when Luk ordered them to throw him into the flames, he crept through the roll and came out safely upon the other side of the fire. Then Luk said, &quot;Rat, we have tried everything to kill him, but in vain&quot;; and the Rat answered, &quot;He cannot die; so make him the lord of all who are evil and deceitful.&quot;

<br /><br />Erle Frayne D. Argonza / Ra
<br />Brotherhood of Light</strong>
<br /><br />08 October 2012
<br /><br />This White Robe from the Brotherhood’s Darjeeling Council extends warm greetings!
<br /><br />As teacher, messenger, forthcoming Guardian, let me share at this moment a note on the spirituality of the New Earth. In previous writings, I already declared the freethinker’s credo for a post-Church spirituality, a byline that I won’t depart from. 
<br /><br />Big Church and its conduit Big Charity will only last till December 21 of this year. Freethinker type of seekers as well as church devotees are now tired of being harnessed to encumbrances of organized church, notably Big Church, and so here comes a new context that will provide them opportunities to breath the air of devotional freedom unencumbered by links with powerful church hierarchies. 
<br /><br />Religious cults, on the other hand, which mushroomed by the millions over the last six (6) decades, will also be shorn of the magical deceptions that they once exercised on superstitious Herds. The herds of folks that they preyed upon will be transferred to their respective planets, so shorn of their follower base, the cults will implode to stinking irrelevance. 
<br /><br />Meanwhile, the habitués of New Earth will find a new exciting development: the rise to spirituality’s nadir of the Melchizedek Priest. Spiritual masters they are, including this messenger Ra who is a true blue Melchizedek, who are tasked, as interplanetary priests, to provide wise mentoring, coaching, and counsel on diverse aspects of life. 
<br /><br />Because of their superb levels of wisdom and knowledge acquired from many lives of dedication to the Wisdom and practices, Melchizedeks will also be tasked to perform public duties as Gatekeepers of cities, special regions-Indigenous Peoples, regions of the planet (clusters of cities &amp; special regions-IPs), and special concerns such as science, culture, arts, and education. Being tasked with public duties, they can be easily convened into a planetary parliament that will be housed later in a ‘city of governance’ (which also houses the Guardianship council).
<br /><br />To the Melchizedeks will also go the task of gatekeeperships of global energy spots, such as the Mt Banahaw and Mt Fuji. On those sites of energy spots can be installed the Ascension Temples of the future, for the purposes of meditation, healing, balancing, learning esoterics and mysticism, and spiritual tourism. 
<br /><br />There are White Robes and would-be masters down on the surface who were already tasked to serve as gatekeepers of the said energy spots. For now, they are still in the dark as to what duties to perform in the forthcoming years as gatekeepers, given the lack of official mandates to get them to action. 
<br /><br />At some time in the near future will the World Leader Avatar, Guardianship Council, with the special counsel of Lord Metatron and Lord Melchizedek, convene the Melchizedek priests to set the agenda and plan for the Ascension Temples that will be built on the very sites of energy spots. The Ascension Temples in the Etheric Plane serve as models for the forthcoming temples in the New Earth, so the question of model is already settled. 
<br /><br />What can happen will be more or less like this as scenario: In the localities, individuals will be forming spiritual circles of their own. They will be meeting regularly for meditation, discussion, group healing, fellowships. These circles will then find impetus to visit pilgrimage sites and, when ready, the Ascension Temples where they can bath in the beneficial energy of the site, do healing &amp; balancing, and listen to the wise words from the Melchizedeks tasked to administer the site. 
<br /><br />There are 70 energy spots of major proportions around the globe, which in the long run will all be installed with respective Ascension Temple. A particular spiritual circle, as described above, can then attune itself to any of the said temples, and visit its preferred site on yearly basis. Its members can also decide to see the other sites and temples across the decades to come. 
<br /><br />The links between the spiritual circles in localities and the various Melchizedeks, including their own locality gatekeeper, will be direct. Being the truly mandated priests, the New Earth habitués will naturally gravitate around them, seek their wise counsel when they feel the need to, even bless the marital unions of newly wed as well as bless the newly born babies. 
<br /><br />The predominance of the Melchizedeks on the surface will surely turn the Old Earth priests into irrelevant figures overnight whose only purpose is for reminiscence of the dead world of the past. So the challenge to the Old Earth priests is to be initiated as Brothers of Light, mutate to true Melchizedeks, and transform their respective churches into Golden Age citadels of Light, thus rendering them as true catalysts of authentic human liberation: the liberation of souls from cycles of rebirth and miseries accompanying life in the surface.

<br /><br />Erle Frayne D. Argonza
<br />Brotherhood of Light</strong>
<br /><br />10 October 2012
<br /><br />Peace &amp; Love from this White Robe!
<br /><br />Ra, messenger &amp; teacher, staff at the Darjeeling Council, forthcoming Guardian, will shed light on the gargantuan change in the criminology &amp; penology as we all move to the New Earth context. To put the thesis in simple terms: crimes will be almost nil, rendering prisons irrelevant.
<br /><br />Let’s get straight to the point and see what makes crimes drop by a humungous deep cut in occurrences: (a) Evil Masters will all be gone, banished to their prison by Gabriel and the warrior angels; (<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cool.gif" alt=":)" /> Demoniacs or ‘negative persons’ will all be gone likewise, shipped out to their own planet in the negative subplane of the Astral Plane (Kama Loka planet); and, (c) Laggards, who are easily swayed by the Evil Ones, will be shipped out en masse to their own 3rd dimensional planet(s). 
<br /><br />What’s left of the population to start the New Earth—from 5th through 7th Densities (depending on level of awareness)—are the more relatively evolved souls. Necessarily, their respective psyche is relatively more balanced. 
<br /><br />The higher the state of inner balance of the habitué, the higher the ‘density’ of residency of the person concerned. Conversely, the lower the inner balance, the lower the density of habituation of the person concerned. Lightworkers, who are more relatively balanced, will be occupying the 5th through the 7th densities, depending on their own state of inner balance. Many Lightworkers who are qualified for 6th and 7th may volunteer to niche down 5th density, which will be a bonus for peoples in the latter.
<br /><br />So, with more relatively balanced inhabitants of the ascended planet, what crimes can be possibly committed if ever? There will be a thorough genuflection and review of the new psyche situation, aimed at redefining what crime is and what constitutes deviations from norms that may be considered not crime but merely misdemeanor or so. 
<br /><br />Penology, which comprises of all essential frames and forms of punishment and possible corrections, was largely a prison-based penology in the Kali Yuga 3D planet. I will dub it as Panopticon Penology, based on the prisons that we have today where a prisoner is constantly under surveillance within the premises of the jail, but impervious to the prying eyes of the outsider. 
<br /><br />So, even while the prisoner is sleeping, s/he will always live in constant fear of reprisals for possible escape plans or so. The drudgery for the sin of commission called ‘crime’ is morbidly heavy, and the stigma of society reinforces that drudgery, even if the person may have been a mere mistaken identity and was unjustly punished. 
<br /><br />Modern thinkers did their own contributions to the legitimation of the Panopticon Penology, with the utilitarian philosopher James Mill serving as the frontal advocate of the Panopticon prison philosophy and structural design. The history of crime and penology was well discoursed by Michele Foucault in his book Crime &amp; Punishment, which exposed the subtle evil behind the Panopticon and the subculture of surveillance built around its system. 
<br /><br />Fortunately, that situation is all coming to change very soon. Sure, during the transition period, there will be interim prisons, where those captured elites and Mad Max demoniacs will be kept for awhile. This is while waiting for the shipment of the said persons to their own planets. But once Terra stabilizes electromagnetically and new cities &amp; special regions (for tribal communities) will be up and running, penology will radically be re-engineered tailor-fit to the new context. 
<br /><br />Sure there will be physical prisons, but there will not be as many prison facilities as they were in the Kali Yuga 3D planet. And that situation of constant surveillance may not be necessary, as imprisoned ones may just be there for some couples of days, if ever. The penology will apply largely to the 5th density habitués, and will be inapplicable to the higher ones (will keep mum about it). 
<br /><br />Personal misbehaviors will be largely those concerning marital relations and misdemeanors that will be so petty, it won’t even need to incarcerate the perpetrators. Village- or neighborhood-level amicable negotiations and settlements will be done, with the help of volunteers who will aid in reflection on the misbehavior, counsel the person(s) involved about behavior modification, and related interventions. 
<br /><br />Now, as regards the relationship among the localities (cities, special regions), this is where irritants can arise as regards trade, movements of people, and proprietary rights to intellectual properties where this can apply. Lawyers and penologists will be busy representing parties involved, but rest assured the settlements of the disputes won’t lead to imprisonment of perpetrators. 
<br /><br />Thus, the transmuted penology will be an exciting field for behavior science studies, as it represents a radical departure from old frameworks and practices. And the new penology may as well be dubbed as Post-Prison Penology, while the old time Criminal Law will totally die with the dead Old Earth.

<br /><br />Erle Frayne D. Argonza / Ra
<br />Brotherhood of Light</strong>
<br /><br />12 October 2012
<br /><br />Kapayapaan at pagmamahal! Peace and love!
<br /><br />This White Robe, guru who was mandated to be messenger by Lord Metatron, staff at the Darjeeling Council, forthcoming Guardian, will share to you a heraldry on the subject of magistracy and the new justice system. 
<br /><br />As already publicly pronounced by us messengers of the Hierarchy, White Robes will be mandated to become judges. Yes, we White Robes will be deputized by the Karmic Board to conduct judicial review and decide on the case of our fellow humans in the post-ascension New Age. [Add: Guardians will be judges and executioners too.]
<br /><br />This extra mandate will radically alter the magistracy precepts and practices on the surface(s) of the New Terra habituated by mortals. The ancient practice of assigning judges from among qualified lawyers may take the back seat for a long time, the period of which we can’t estimate for now. 
<br /><br />There will be a total of 144,000 new Ascended Masters, White Robes or Rishis as we are also called, after the ascension event. The human domain is, after all, the domain of Ascended Masters, so the top policy, judicial, and executive tasks at all levels are intended for the Christed Ones as humans evolve to higher awareness levels across the epochs coming. 
<br /><br />At the city and special region (Indigenous Peoples) level, which will co-exist in parallel and symbiotic fashion, a Melchizedek Priest will be appointed as Gatekeeper, as already elucidate previously. To each of these same Melchizedek Priests will go the task of core public policy initiatives as well as the magistracy as concurrent role. 
<br /><br />The possibility of crime rate crashing down to nil is there, as already explicated in the penology subject. Therefore, the need for magistracies in any given city or special region will be drastically reduced to just a single “court” if the term is appropriate at all. 
<br /><br />The day-to-day administration of the city or special region—of the execution of core policies, agenda, and plans—will go to the hands of the Council officials who, as already clarified, will be elected at large among the members of the locality. This situation allows the Gatekeeper (master) to conduct magistracy duties and responsibilities at the same time.  
<br /><br />At the planetary level, there will be a Planetary Magistracy that will be reviewing and deciding on cases akin to what the international courts do today. The magistracy too will be organized in the manner of a Gatekeepership, which was already explained in the article on planetary governance. 
<br /><br />If in case the sala of the particular Gatekeeper of a city or special region will be so cramped up with so much cases, in case this happens at all, then shall there be a decision to expand on the magistracy at the local level to comprise of a team. Associate Magistrates can be deputized to dispense with justice decisions, as contingencies may point out to such an option. 
<br /><br />Yet shall it be that even associate magistrates will come from the ranks of the Ascended Masters. Even the top-level staff or personnel for the magistracies from local to planetary will likewise by Ascended Masters. Public heraldries by any magistracy should also be from among the Ascended Masters holding office in the same unit. 
<br /><br />Meantime, the need for lawyers will continue as the same has been for many epochs come to pass. The law profession will have to drastically shift in paradigm though, and retool likewise in drastic fashion. The branches of law as we know them today will be pared off, as the likes of corporate law, political law, and even criminal law will be obsolete.
<br /><br />A reclassification of the branches of law or jurisprudence will evolve in time, and need not be rushed. But already, we anticipate the civil law to be hot potato, ditto for the settling of disputations regarding negotiations and contracts. Environmental law could also be hot potato, more so that tribal communities will be involved in their stewardship which increases monitoring of potential violators of nature endowments’ usage. 
<br /><br />In an even more solid Information Society of space age proportions, the savvy for innovations and inventions will rise meteorically. We anticipate irritants in the matter of intellectual properties, even more than the ones we are experiencing today, so this calls for a new framework and tools for handling intellectual products and settling disputes. 
<br /><br />As to legal cases against medical malpractices, a current dread of medical doctors and allied professionals, these too will drastically die down to nil. People’s health will be near perfect, and health will shift entirely to wellness concerns away from the sickness rut of the present. 
<br /><br />So that, in sum, is the forthcoming magistracy and justice system awaiting you all. And, the changes coming for the law profession.

<br /><br />Erle Frayne D. Argonza / Ra
<br />Brotherhood of Light</strong>
<br /><br />14 October 2012
<br /><br />Katotohanan at Tanglaw! Truth &amp; Light!
<br /><br />What will happen to mass media, communications, internet post-Ascension? This White Robe, messenger &amp; teacher, forthcoming Guardian, will shed light on the subject. 
<br /><br />First of all, there will be catastrophic turbulence in the EMF (electromagnetic field) of Terra immediately upon the planet’s entry to the Null Zone. Onwards to 2013 when geo-atmospheric changes will consequently take place, turbulence will be sustained, thus crashing down power, communications, and mass media including the internet.
<br /><br />Besides, Terra is moving to higher dimension, where polarity principles won’t work. Electricity, communications, mass media, and internet (using binary language) may just not work again as they used to, unless that quick R&amp;D and technology diffusion by space friends will help Terrans to alleviate their miserable situation due to the lack of communications, media &amp; internet. 
<br /><br />What is good news is that Giant Moguls who own and control the media, will be gone. The meltdown and death of Big Biz in communications, media, internet will surely change the equation in the ownership, technicalities, and technology innovations for the subjects at hand. 
<br /><br />There can then be greater social responsibility and reason in the affairs of communications-media-internet or CMI. Communications infrastructures may have to be run by the planetary state for a long time, with diverse media outfits tapping into them. Smaller communications outfits can be allowed at the localities, provided that they won’t grow to the levels of titanic media monopolies that gobble up others as they do today.
<br /><br />On the other hand, a new protocol for the internet will need to be developed and operated altogether, as the binary language of the past may be misfit in the new EMF context. Many internet sites of the present just may not be operable any longer in the protocol, more so those networks that need codes to log in, though the more navigable ones due to openness such as blogs can still be surfed from outside. 
<br /><br />The blogosphere is a trend yet of the future rather than the present, so watch out for this platform to serve as the percolator of ideas for the many bright minds that suddenly find greater freedoms to exercise innovation though with greater social responsibility. The blogosphere is now converging with the news &amp; media, but that convergence will climb to another level yet, as more news will be reported by independent persons and groups there. 
<br /><br />With the death of Big Media and Big Biz Communications, ‘mass’ media will turn to a more responsible, high-touch, yet informative, reason-upgrading platform. We will use the term ‘community media’ to refer to this new media, which departs radically from the mass society, illogical, fear-inducing, irresponsible mass media of the Old Earth. 
<br /><br />Community media can then find convergence all the more with the new internet, so that more and more will people be relying on the internet for truly informative and socially responsible news &amp; public affairs. Even the radio broadcast &amp; music platforms that we know today may just need to retool and depart from the old mode to transfer relay with the interactives to the internet. 
<br /><br />In the long run, with new technological innovations impacting on the CMI, the capacity to join the loops of interplanetary CMI highways will be effected. There can then be freer flow and exchanges of information between Terra and higher dimensional worlds that are hooked up to the CMI highways. 
<br /><br />Needless to say, our present CMI facilities will be heavily watched over by the angels and the Galactic Command contingents. Even now, the angels are guarding the internet, helping to protect certain websites and networks amid the attempt by Evil Ones to smash the genuine Lightworker sites, a protection that will lead to the conservation of the entire internet to permit its usability even after a new protocol will be installed. 
<br /><br />As to those very dirty materials on the internet, let the gatekeepership for communications &amp; media take note of that situation and recommend courses of action. If those sites can’t be navigated anyway, it is moot to act on them. But if dirty sites such as pornography, New Age Movement deceptions, Satanic/Luciferan stuff, and pop music/arts of primal-Demonic themes, then there’s reason to take them down in any way conceivable. 
<br /><br />Ascension enthusiasts, welcome the CMI of the New Age of Light! Enjoy surfing sites from across the galaxy! Happy reading and viewing the community media reports of the New Earth!

<br /><br />Erle Frayne D. Argonza / Ra
<br />Brotherhood of Light</strong>
<br /><br />16 October 2012
<br /><br />May the best of health be with you in the New Earth!
<br /><br />Ra, messenger &amp; teacher, from the Darjeeling Council, forthcoming Guardian, will focus on the subject of health &amp; wellness in this note. This is among my last few heraldries to proclaim, as my ground tasks will soon end in full gear up for my forthcoming missions as a guardian. 
<br /><br />I already wrote on the subject of physical mutation—from organic- to crystalline-based bodies—in previous articles. Life span will be very long in the New Earth, an indication of perfected health for everyone else in the ascended planet. 
<br /><br />Consequently, health perspective will shift from the Sickness paradigm of the Old Earth to the Wellness paradigm long advocated by diverse cultural innovators. The health situation by then will be entirely different from what we are experiencing for now.
<br /><br />In the current context, we have a love-hate relationship between Allopathic Medicine on the one hand and Alternative &amp; Traditional Medicine on the other hand, as regards the matter of health care. Allopathy or Western medical paradigm is largely based on bio-physical paradigm and drug-based intervention, while Alternative &amp; Traditional Medicine is broader and prescribes remedies other than drug or pharmaceutical interventions. 
<br /><br />Both of the paradigms are, incidentally, fixated to healthcare as a matter of healing the sick persons, though the approaches to interventions do vary. Both are now recognized in the mainstream, even as we witness the proliferation of organic and herbal medicines across the globe. 
<br /><br />The situation in the New Earth will be radically different, as physical bodies will be less prone to sickness while aging disappears altogether. Healthcare will logically shift from healing the sick to preventing sickness, as you’ll find out later. 
<br /><br />Hospital or clinical care as intervention measure will almost totally disappear in the near future. The need for medicare and related healthcare policy tools will be irrelevant too, thus saving the diverse stakeholders enormous resources—individual capital, social capital, infrastructures, tools—that can then be used for other developmental engagements. 
<br /><br />Sure, there will be the equivalent of clinics, such as the health centers operated by non-governmental organizations proliferating in the big cities today. There will be instrumentations and tools too, for routine health check ups. But gigantic hospitals, pharmaceutical industries, and related resource-intensive systems won’t be around again in the new context. 
<br /><br />Instead, there will be a greater proliferation of fitness centers that will stress physical culture as part of total wellness regimen. Also will there be skin care, hair care, dental care, massage therapies, and the likes that we now witness, with slight modifications. Of course, organics &amp; herbals that go with such practices will be sustained and improved in the new context. 
<br /><br />Everybody will be meditating in the new context, which adds meditation tools among the wellness interventions. Prana will be the source of energy for crystalline-based bodies, prana that can be tapped largely via meditation practice. 
<br /><br />The use of pranic approaches, crystals, and related alternative methods for wellness inducements will intensify more than they are done today. Wellness will also include balancing the home ecology using music &amp; sounds, crystals, incense, candles, magnetized water solutions, practices that redound to better wellness.  
<br /><br />Health professionals today who are quite aware of the coming changes should get ready for massive retooling in the light of radically changed context. They must learn to recognize the role of the fitness specialists, meditation gurus, geomancers, crystals producers, herbalists and organic practitioners in building perfect health, as the healthcare equation will shift heavily to the latter stakeholders. 
<br /><br />Rest assured there will be room for the diverse stakeholders in wellness &amp; health in the New Earth. Obesity and hunger will both be gone, thus rendering the citizens themselves as participants in the healthcare of tomorrow. Isn’t it gladdening to know that wellness will have replaced sickness in the coming New Age of Light?

<br />Erle Frayne D. Argonza</strong>
<br /><br />Source: <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.oldandsold.com%2Farticles29%2Fmythology-20.shtml"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.oldandsold.com/articles29/mythology-20.shtml</a> 
<br />The second class of tales relates more directly to the origin of human beings. Myths of this type are apparently confined to the series of tribes just mentioned as having legends of the first category, but in this instance the area seems to extend as far as Tasmania. As an illustration we may take the version given by the Arunta. At the time of the retreat of the original sea to the northward there were in the western sky two beings who were self-existing and of whose origin nothing is stated. From their lofty position they saw far to the east a number of Inapertwa, &quot;rudimentary human beings or in-complete men, whom it was their mission to make into men and women.&quot; These Inapertwa were of various shapes and lived along the edges of the sea. &quot;They had no distinct limbs or organs of sight, hearing or smell, and did not eat food, and presented the appearance of human beings all doubled up into a rounded mass in which just the outline of the different parts of the body could be vaguely seen.&quot; The two sky-beings came down, therefore, from the sky and armed with large stone knives, set to work to make these amorphous objects into men. &quot;First of all the arms were released, then the fingers were added by making four clefts at the end of each arm; then legs and toes were added in the same way. The figure could now stand, and after this the nose was added and the nostrils bored with the fingers. A cut with the knife made the mouth. . . . A slit on each side separated the upper and lower eyelids, hidden behind which the eyes were already present, another stroke or two completed the body and thus, out of the Inapertwa, men and women were formed.&quot; Closely similar tales are told by many other tribes of the central area 9 and the south-east, as well as in Tasmania.'&quot; 
<br />REFLECTION
<br /><br />‘At the time of the retreat of the original sea’ is a direct referent for the geological changes in antiquity, past 100 millions of years back. That was the eon of the first experimentation on Terran humans, which involved the ‘lunar pitris’ (lunar fathers) as revealed by ancient wisdom, a revelation that forms a part of Theos Sophia or divine wisdom.
<br /><br />The said beings volunteered to come to Earth back then, to check on the conditions of life support systems and nature’s evolutes. The evolutes they could have seen was man-like primates that antedated all of today’s primates. Suffice it to state that such primates could have been the copy models for embodying group-soul humans that were on the descending phase of their development in the evolutionary arc. 
<br /><br />Two (2) beings could very well signify two (2) teams of ‘pitris’ of creator fathers—‘lunar pitris’ and ‘solar pitris’—who came forth in antiquity, during the galvanization of a new super-continents. The first supercontinent where mankind appeared is what geologists of today call Pangaea or Land of Pan, which mystical circles call Hyperborea and Thule. The other supercontinent, Lemuria, superseded Pangaea. 
<br /><br />So graphical is the experimentation on the Pangean evolutes that they practically resemble a laboratory process that involves incision instruments (‘knife’) and grafting of different body parts surgically stitched or glued together. Such a creation of Terrans could have moved on till the Lemurian sub-races, when mankind began to appear in a more physical form than the previous etheric or ‘shadowy’ Pangeans. 
<br /><br />It could have been so difficult a process altogether, as some of the experimental humans turned out to be lifeless vegetables. Needless to say, their soul imprints were erased by their creators, so that new souls can be used to embody other experimental forms. These experimentations went on up until the more recent races, with ‘pitris’  from higher dimension worlds landing a hand in the genetic breeding.

<br /><br />Erle Frayne D. Argonza / Ra
<br />Brotherhood of Light</strong>
<br /><br />18 October 2012
<br /><br />Magandang araw sa inyo! Good day to you all!
<br /><br />Ra, teacher &amp; messenger, from the Darjeeling Council of the Brotherhood, forthcoming Guardian, will add more substance to the theme of Prana as vital source of energy for New Earth habitués. As an advanced thesis, let me re-echo the theme spread by Brothers that the Sun’s binary twin star will be the prana booster in the aftermath of the Ascension event. 
<br /><br />That the Sun has a binary star twin is no new knowledge to me, as a former student of mine at the De La Salle University in Manila showed me a controversial article regarding the same, circa 1999 yet. A male student of engineering sciences, the student was a seeker and starseed who discussed and consulted with me about metaphysics, controversy, and conspiracy matters. 
<br /><br />In that article, it was theorized that the binary star traverses a path that is elliptical vis a vis the Sun (not circular path) as viewed from a certain angle. It takes that twin star, which I will call Sun II for simplification, 26,000,000 years to complete the elliptical movement. Accordingly, the Sun II will come nearest to the Sun in the near future. 
<br /><br />That knowledge didn’t make much sense to me, not even when I reviewed the 2012 books by Guruji Krishnananda that included the same subject, until I had a dream vision of the same Sun II in early July of this year. It was the last dream vision I had for the night, which took place right before 5:00 a.m. when I usually get up for the day. 
<br /><br />In that dream vision, I was among people hobnobbing in a certain city street, with the sky very visible as it was almost a cloudless day. Suddenly the people were agitatedly exclaiming that “there goes the 2nd Sun!” in an exuberance I’ve never witnessed before. For the people take for granted the Sun and wouldn’t cease their activities to observe it unless that an eclipse would take place. 
<br /><br />The Sun II was huge, as it was practically larger than our own Sun I in the dream scene. Knowing intuitively that it is farther from Earth than Sun I, such a huge Sun II could surely amaze any enthusiastic observer. The observed hugeness confirmed to me that the binary star twin is very gigantic, which appears larger than the Sun I in fact as the vision facilely indicated. 
<br /><br />Thus concluded my rather unusual research into Sun II, unusual because I was able to see it in direct vision, as a direct experience, whereas ordinarily people can’t see the same Sun at all. Looming so large in the horizon, the Sun II will be nearest to Earth in its celestial path at a time when Terrans will have urgent need for more sources of Prana or vital energy during the Ascension transition up through the beginnings of the New Age of Light (approximate full start on 2018). 
<br /><br />As already heralded by the White Robe messengers, myself included, Prana will be source of energy to sustain the crystalline-based bodies of the New Earth habitués. During the 7-year transition from 2012-2018, bodies will still need solid organic foods even when the Earth had already entered the higher dimension past Dec. 21 of this year. 
<br /><br />The Moon may slip away from Earth’s gravity during the transition, most especially as the Solar system passes by the Null Zone, and so the Moon as source of prana will be out of the option. That moonless scenario is precisely the very rationale for an Option B as source of prana, which is Sun II. 
<br /><br />To sum up the situation, the planet will be bombarded with very high frequency energy sources from the Photon Belt, Sirius, galaxy’s central space, and diverse star systems. Photon will spiritualize Terra and its inhabitants, while the star energies’ high frequencies will be scaled down by the two suns into manageable frequencies for Terrans and other creations on the planet. Prana will be among such energies shared by the twin stars Sun I and Sun II.
<br /><br />That being the case, then let’s all jubilantly welcome the coming of Sun II. The Beatles’ song “Here Comes The Sun,” which I can still play and sing with gusto along with the acoustic guitar, would be an apt theme song for the convergence of energies of the two Suns. 
<br /><br />Here comes the Sun! So mote it be. Let it be!

<br /><br />Source: <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.oldandsold.com%2Farticles29%2Fmythology-20.shtml"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.oldandsold.com/articles29/mythology-20.shtml</a> 
<br />Myths of the third type are, on the other hand, characteristic of the south-easterly portion of the continent. Although in many cases 12 there are no detailed stories of the creation of mankind, the statement being merely that the first men were created, more definite myths do occur. Thus, the tribes in the vicinity of Melbourne say that in the beginning Pundjel made two males from clay. &quot;With his big knife he cut three large sheets of bark. On one of these he placed a quantity of clay, and worked it into a proper consistence with his knife. When the clay was soft, he carried a portion to one of the other pieces of bark, and he commenced to form the clay into a man, beginning at the feet; then he made the legs, then he formed the trunk and the arms and the head. He made a man on each of the two pieces of bark. He was well pleased with his work, and looked at the men a long time, and he danced round about them. He next took stringybark from a tree, ... made hair of it, and placed it on their heads — on one straight hair and on the other curled hair. Pund-jel again looked at his work, much pleased . . . and once more he danced round about them. . . . After again smoothing with his hands their bodies, from the feet upwards to their heads, he lay upon each of them, and blew his breath into their mouths, into their noses, and into their navels; and breathing very hard, they stirred. He danced round about them a third time. He then made them speak, and caused them to get up, and they rose up, and appeared as full grown young men.&quot; Some of the Queens-land tribes declare 14 that the moon created the first man and woman, the former being made from stone and rubbed all over with white and black ashes, while the latter was shaped from a box-tree and rendered soft and supple by rubbing with yams and mud. In South Australia, on the other hand, there is apparently a belief in the creation of men from excrement which was moulded and then tickled, this causing the image to laugh and become alive. 
<br />REFLECTION
<br /><br />‘Two men’, two (2) root-races of early humans: Hyperborean or Pangaean races. ‘Clay’ signifies the earth which, in turn, contains all the 100+ elements of matter known in chemistry, all elements found in man’s body. 
<br /><br />Observe the very graphic processes involved in creating or evolving the early humans, which looks very much like some laboratory scientists creating species using scalpels and surgical instruments. The ‘dance’ signifies the energizing of the species in order to bring life to it, ‘life’ literally meaning ‘vital energy’ or prana, which is the Breath in other cultures. 
<br /><br />The Queensland version directly indicates the role of the ‘lunar pitris’ or fathers in creating the first humans, signified by the ‘moon creating the first man and woman’. Those first races were actually asexual in birthing, with a hermaphrodite race appearing in a phase of the evolutes. 
<br /><br />That version about first humans made of white or black ashes indicates knowledge of the primordial humans. ‘White’ signifies the etheric-to-astral humans who were as ‘white as light’, not yet bio-physical in form. The ‘ash’ signifies the sub-races of Lemurians who were indeed black or very dark in skin hue.

<br /><br />Erle Frayne D. Argonza / Ra
<br />Brotherhood of Light
<br /></strong>
<br />20 October 2018
<br /><br />Gracious day from this Brother of Light! Maluwalhating araw!
<br /><br />Ra, teacher &amp; messenger, staff at the Darjeeling Council, forthcoming Guardian, will share an update regarding the pole-less situation as Earth enters the Null Zone on December 21 of this year 2012. I will also clarify the Divine Forces’ intervention for possible shortening of the pole-less situation. 
<br /><br />To continue with our ascension chronicles, of which over a hundred articles were already released by Ra, let us reflect on those very moments when the entire Solar System &amp; Alcyon (central star of the Sun) will align with Sirius (central star of Alcyon) and the central space of the Milky Way. As per latest update we got, which was heralded by Guruji Krishnananda (see <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Flightagemasters.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://lightagemasters.com</a>), the event will happen on 11:11 a.m. of the 21st of December. 
<br /><br />Without external intervention from Divine Forces, Terra will accordingly be without poles for three (3) days. When the poles return, they will be in reversed order, while the Earth will rotate in reverse direction. These forecasts hereby supersede those that I made earlier about the subject. 
<br /><br />Should the planet be without poles for 3 days, the deleterious effect of pole-less circumstance will be felt strongly by those who are the least prepared for the ascension event. Hundreds of millions of the very dense and imbalanced types will be dropping dead every day by sheer force of high frequency energies that their bodies are least prepared to take, energies that cause fatal system failures. 
<br /><br />As per findings from Russian scientists, experimental subjects who simulate pole-less situation for days suffer from madness (sociopathy, schizophrenia) thereafter. So, to remedy the situation, the aerospace  scientists designed magnets that were embedded in the suits of the cosmonauts, magnets that can simulate the planetary poles in outer space, hence avoiding the dysfunctional maladies that can be very fatal in the short run. 
<br /><br />The option being taken by the Divine Hierarchs is to directly intervene so as to undercut the pole-less circumstance from 3 days down to 3 hours. Lord Metatron assisted by Dhyan Chohan angels (dhyan chohan = planetary spirit, a level of awareness at avatara or God-realized stage) will comprise the Divine Team who will intervene as stipulated.  
<br /><br />The effect of the intervention is the saving of many lives among the unprepared. The mere 3 hours will result to just about some tens of millions dead all over the world due to system failure. Those who will be saved will have six (6) years more to decide and work out their preparedness until 2018. 
<br /><br />Note that Terra will be in 4th Dimension by December 21, and Terrans will be going to density niches where they most fit. 5th through 7th Densities will be reserved to the Lightworkers and Light Helpers, which they will traverse with aid of the Galactic Confederation, Celestial Forces (angels), and Brothers/Sisters of Light. 
<br /><br />Couples of billions will be left in 4th Density where they must decide and work for change. Even the Service-for-Others will be in 4th Density largely, and from there they apply some more intervention tools so that they can merge with the 5th Density population as both 4th and 5th Densities will merge by 2018. 
<br /><br />Meantime, billions of misfits will likewise be staying in 4th Density for some time (till 2018), creating chaotic Mad Max scenarios all over the planet. To alleviate the sufferings of the fit ones (higher vibrating), they will be moved over to safe havens, as I already elucidated many articles back. 
<br /><br />Which means that the Fits and the Misfits will be sharing the same space, but set apart from each other, for some time yet. Those already located in higher densities will help out both populations through Light channel interventions, counsel (where applicable), and related tools. Angels &amp; Galactic Command contingents aid in rescue, rehab, amenities and provisions, while Seraphs will aid in securing Terra. 
<br /><br />The Divine intervention could thus allow the numbers of Terrans who qualify for New Earth to go beyond the 20% margin as earlier forecast. Meantime, those Misfits must get ready for their transfer to ‘7 earths’ readied by the Hierarchy for them depending on their levels of awareness.

<br /><br />Erle Frayne D. Argonza / Ra
<br />Brotherhood of Light
<br /></strong>
<br />22 October 2012
<br /><br />Magandang araw sa inyo! Good day to you all!
<br /><br />Most if not all of you Ascension enthusiasts know all about the 7 Years of Tribulation as revealed by John the Beloved (see Book of Revelation). Ra, teacher &amp; messenger, forthcoming Guardian, will amplify the subject with a clarificatory note. 
<br /><br />The evolutionary leap from Old Earth to New Earth is no quick-fix overnight event. There is always a transition period whenever an entity or being is born. This we know from our experience in doing organizational change, or in building a new institution, where there are always the birth pangs to the new entity.
<br /><br />Such is the history of the coming New Earth. The transition period, which is shared by Masters from East to West, expectedly follows the Septenary Law patterns (Law of 7), thus enabling us all an easy forecast of a 7-year transition period. 
<br /><br />As already elucidated by me, the 5th through 7th Densities in the upward movement will begin to galvanize, stabilize a bit, thus rendering buildable areas to be manifested with infrastructures following community plan designs known to the Ascended Masters. 4th Density, however, will still be replete with transition dilemmas and challenges that will run all through the end of 2018. 
<br /><br />It is at 4th Density where the Mad Max scenario of massive lootings, harassments, attempts by global elites to regroup and gain some control, will be experienced. The shortening of the ‘Earth without poles’ situation from 3 days to merely 3 hours will complicate the dilemmas, as many supposedly dead misfits will be given another chance to change, though the time frame for change is very narrow: 6 years and 10 days remaining till December 31, 2018.
<br /><br />Those possible additions to higher density living will thus be exiting 4th density group by group, as possibly many will seek the help of Brothers of Light—Light Masters—who are niched in the astral and etheric planes. Those Terrans who will go up the dimensional ladders of existence will also be offering help by ‘channeling Light’ (Guruji Krishnananda’s term) and sharing tools to quicken ascension. 
<br /><br />During the transition period, Photon Belt energies will already be upon us all in full blast. The tough challenge to change will be upon those misfits and/or unprepared who must change or perish. By 2017 comes another tumultuous event as a celestial body will rub atmosphere with Terra, an event that will catalyze the offering of Divine Grace upon all those who are being challenged to change (see Sal Rachele’s predictions, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.salrachele.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.salrachele.com</a>). 
<br /><br />The Photon energy will itself be a catalytic agent towards that goal of Ascension, just to remind everyone else for whom this information is intended for. It is part of the Father’s grace to move on, while Gaia’s grace will continue to pour upon those who choose to change as well as among the tribal peoples. 
<br /><br />During such a transition, even the Light Forces mandated to take down the Demoniacs and ship out Laggards too will hold in abeyance heavily punitive direct action upon the 4th density hold outs. The Father’s hands and the Mother’s heart are upon the misfits and hold outs, and a tumultuous showering of Divine Grace is available to every hold out just so they might indeed choose to change. 
<br /><br />By 2018, during the last blasts of turbulent winds, geological cataclysms, flood waters’ rush, Lord Kalki will directly provide a device to those who choose to ascend, which the latter will use to boost their chance to tap higher energies and ascend successfully. On that year, the last turbulence will be the accompanying tumult as the 4th and 5th densities are merged, thus ending the 7-year transition. 
<br /><br />Those too many hundreds of millions who will perish will be transferred to their own planets—7 earths as per Guruji Krishnananda’s heraldry—where they will be given a longer chance to evolve at their own pace. As they are being shipped out, the New Earth habitués will be endowing them with Light to ensure somehow that, upon their habituation of their new worlds, they will be attuned to the Hierarchy. 
<br /><br />Depending on how you’d look at it, the 7 tribulation years could be so dreadfully terrifying or so abundant with spiritual opportunity. Those who choose the latter and make it to the New Earth will see the World Leader, Christs, Buddhas, Ascended Masters, and White Robes appear before their very eyes on the surface of Terra. 
<br /><br />So will Shamballah, golden City of Light, manifest itself again at the end of the period. Whereas before only the Initiated Adepts can enter Shamballah, in the Golden Age everyone who will enthusiastically seek the Path of Light will have the chance of visiting the city and receive the blessings of the Most Holy Ones led by Ancient of Days and 3 Logoi aides.

<br />Erle Frayne D. Argonza</strong>
<br /><br />Source: <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.oldandsold.com%2Farticles29%2Fmythology-20.shtml"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.oldandsold.com/articles29/mythology-20.shtml</a> 
<br />Another tale from Victoria records the origin of woman as follows. One day Pallyan, the brother (or son<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/unsure.gif" alt=":)" /> of Pundjel, the maker of man, was playing in a deep water-hole and in so doing he thumped and thrashed the water with his hands until it became thick and muddy. At length he saw something, and parting the mass with a branch, he discovered hands and then two heads, and at last extricated two female forms, which were the first women and were given as wives to the two men whom Pundjel had already made. An origin of mankind from the sky is given by one of the tribes of the Northern Territory,&quot; who state that Atnatu, a self-created deity in the heavens, being angry at some of his children, threw them down to earth through a hole in the sky, and that these became the ancestors of the tribe. The dispersion of mankind was explained as follows by these same tribes. After men had multiplied, they became wicked; and thereupon Pundjel, coming down in anger from the skies, whither he and Pallyan had been carried by a whirlwind shortly after they had made the first human beings, with a great knife cut the people into small bits which moved and crawled about like worms. Then a great wind arose and scattered the pieces like flakes of snow far and wide over the world; and wherever they fell, they developed again into men and women. Although presenting some obvious features of missionary influence, the tale probably contains a nucleus of aboriginal thought. 
<br />REFLECTION
<br /><br />In the beginning of human history, two generic or ‘root-races’ of humans evolved, both of which were asexual in birth. This theme appears in many myths across the ASEAN &amp; Pacific. It is also found in the Bible as Adam without Eve, the ‘deep sleep of Adam’. These phases of Pangaean races are signified by two (2) men created by Pundjel who had no wives.
<br /><br />The advent of women signifies the arrival of sexually producing humans—of the mid-Lemurian racial families—whereupon birthing by ‘sweat-born’ and/or ‘egg-born’ ceased. Accordingly, they came from the water, ‘water’ here signifying the astral element, which means sexual reproduction evolved when Earth was still vibrating at higher frequency than today. 
<br /><br />Atnanu as ‘self-created deity’ signifies the Spirit-Force or Supreme Being/Godhead from which we all came. Atnanu’s ‘throwing of his children down to Earth due to anger’ is a direct referent for the descent of humans to more dense environments such as what Earth can offer, this being the devolution phase of human development. 
<br /><br />The beginnings of more individualized souls is also revealed in the narrative. The earlier souls were group-souls, the first minds were collective minds, first Thought was group-thought. That all changed with the coming of individuation, signified by the ‘cutting of humans into smaller pieces’. Theos Sophia or divine wisdom has clarified that process sufficiently. 
<br /><br />Current occult and mystical revelations in fact go more than that, as souls were accordingly sub-divided into ‘soul fragments’. This happened as Lucifer convinced mankind to evolve by controlling their passions, an option that backfired so badly as it fragmented human souls further. That was how humans descended so lowly to the physical plane, a descent that reduced life span and made humans dependent on the bio-sphere for sustenance.

<br /><br />Erle Frayne D. Argonza
<br />Brotherhood of Light</strong>
<br /><br />24 October 2012
<br /><br />Kaluwalhatian at kapayapaan! Light and peace!
<br /><br />The Mamas and Papas out there may be worrying so much about their babies and children, terrified as they are by prospect of perishing by the latter during the 7 year tribulation. Ra, teacher &amp; messenger, staff at the Darjeeling Council, forthcoming Guardian, will appease all ye worrying parents by declaring thus: babies &amp; children are prepared for ascension. 
<br /><br />Children refer to persons who are still in grade school or lower grades at this time when the transition has begun, down to preschool to age 3 years old. Babies of course are those ages two and lower. Save for the laggards who were born from 2000 onwards, most of the babies &amp; children are prepared for the grand event. 
<br /><br />As I was sharing lessons to my chelas (disciples) this year, who are the last batches I am mentoring &amp; coaching, I noticed the worry shown by chelas who have children as their direct responsibilities. They need not express it verbally, but I sensed the deep worry in their body language and facial expressions. 
<br /><br />So I gave them an assuring note that they shouldn’t worry about their children &amp; babies, as the latter are already prepared for the ascension. I told them candidly to worry about their own states of being, as they are still relatively imbalanced, still undergoing healing of their subtle bodies, with occasional gathering of dense energies from the present ongoing and past life engagements. 
<br /><br />Adolescents and adults of today who may be fired up with zeal to ascend still have to hurdle the challenge of activating their dormant DNA strands (10 dormant, 2 active), and that takes humungous amounts of interventions all done simultaneously (e.g. purification tools, meditation, bhakti, people service, deprogramming vices including negative thoughts, emotions, feelings). As the aspirant applies those tools, energy veils shall drop by couples at once, thus activating DNA strands by 1 strand every quarter of the year. 
<br /><br />In contrast, babies &amp; children of the ‘elect’ type (programmed by Hierarchy to ascend as they are already evolved souls) already have all of their 12 DNA strands activated upon birth (2 biological + 10 subtle strands). Hence, they won’t be experiencing the pains of transition undergone by adolescents &amp; adults who feel like being crucified (charge that to their Attention Deficit Disorder maybe hmmm).  
<br /><br />Children &amp; babies are also in direct contact with their coterie of Guides (Evolved Humans &amp; Guardian Angel) + their Devic Crew (deva notably, plus the Earth-Water-Air-Fire elementals assigned to aid their physical growth). They hardly need protective charms &amp; amulets contrasted to their parents who would need an arsenal of devices for protection, abundance, good health. 
<br /><br />Fact is, the children &amp; babies may need to be protected from their very own parents, who bring home toxic energies from work and produce dense energies from habitual negative emotions, social antipathies, negative thoughts. Add to that the protection from the viruses &amp; bacteria carried by their parents. 
<br /><br />So, dear parents, you need not teach your children how to meditate, how to tap Light, and other rather ridiculous projected thoughts unto your own children &amp; babies. Tell that to any spiritual guru today and s/he may respond with chuckles bordering ridicule, for it is you more than your children &amp; babies who need to work out with great sweat on your ascension program. 
<br /><br />Even the rescue &amp; rehab contingencies for children &amp; babies are already well prepared. Name the rescuers—Angels, Space Friends, Terran volunteers—and you have them right. So dear parents, either you blast your children &amp; babies with Light &amp; Love, or you let them inherit tons of dense toxins from your recalcitrant psyche. 
<br /><br />The optimal thing that you parents can do now is to Feng Shui your children’s/babe’s room with crystals and activated Divine protective figures plus mantras, plus burn incense periodically to take down excess conflicting energies. A balanced room surely can be very stabilizing on the small ones. Add fine music (classical, New Age, Nature music) to that regimen, and that will make things fine for them.
