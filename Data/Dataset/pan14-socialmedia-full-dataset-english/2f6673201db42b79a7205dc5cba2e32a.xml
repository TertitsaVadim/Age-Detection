<br /><br />1. We have absolutely no idea where our purse/bag is, and for some reason,that's ok.
<br /><br />2. We believe that dancing with our arms overhead and wiggling our butts while yelling &quot;WOO-HOO&quot; is truly the sexiest dance move around.
<br /><br />3. We've suddenly decided that we want to kick someone's ass and
<br />honestly believe we could do it too.
<br /><br />4. In our last trip to pee, we realize that we now look more like a homeless hooker than the goddess we started out at just 4 hours ago.
<br /><br />5. We drop our 3am submarine sandwich/pizza slice on the floor, pick it up and continue eating it like its nobody's business.
<br /><br />6.We start crying and declare to everyone we see, including people we barely know, that we love them SOOOO MUCH.
<br /><br />7. We get extremely excited and jump up and down every time a new song comes on because &quot;OH MY GOD, I LOVE THIS SONG!&quot;
<br /><br />8. We're suddenly full of profound spiritual wisdom... and so is
<br />the geek next to us.
<br /><br />9. We don't see anything wrong with making out with profs/co-workers/boss should they be around!
<br /><br />10. The urge to take off articles of clothing, get up on the table or bar and start to sing or dance becomes strangely overwhelming to us.
<br /><br />11. Our eyes just won't seem to stay open by themselves, so we keep them half closed and think it looks incredibly sexy.
<br /><br />12. We've suddenly taken up smoking and we believe we're really
<br />good at it!
<br /><br />13. We yell at the bartender who we believe has cheated us by giving us just orange juice, but that's just because we can no longer taste the vodka.
<br /><br />14. We think we are in bed, but our pillow feels strangely like the floor.. or like the mop.
<br /><br />15. We start every conversation with a slurred &quot;Don't take this the wrong way but...&quot;
<br /><br />16. We fail to notice that the toilet lid is down before we sit on it.
<br /><br />17. Our hugs begin to resemble wrestling take-down moves.
<br /><br />18. We are tired, but we are troopers so instead of going home, we just sit on the floor wherever we are standing and take a quick nap.
<br /><br />19. We begin leaving the buttons open on our button fly jeans to
<br />cut down on the time we're in the bathroom away from our drink.
<br /><br />20. We take our shoes off because a) they're ridiculously
<br />impractical.
<br />but so beautiful! <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cool.gif" alt=":)" /> We believe it's the shoes' fault that we can't walk straight.
<br /><br />21. No matter what got broken, thrown up on, stolen, no matter who said what or who went home with whoever else - we ALWAYS call each other the next day!
