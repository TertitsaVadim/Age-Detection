You are right when you say, &quot;I have no power to stop sin, i want to stop sining but i cant&quot; I would have been surprised when you say, &quot;i can stop sin?&quot;  You can not stop sin, but you can overcome sin. Jesus did not stop sin, but overcame sin. If He wanted to stop sin, He would have declared an end to sin on the cross. Since only Jesus overcame sin for you, you can do same by only knowing that Jesus has made you RIGHTEOUS. But devil constantly reminds you of your failures through CONDEMNATION. Each time you fall back to sin, it is because you were listening to the voice of the &quot;accuser of the brethren&quot;through CONDEMNATION. You must learn to listen to only the voice of the HOLY SPIRIT that constantly tells you that He has made you RIGHTEOUS even when you fall. You must constantly confess loudly everyday of your life that &quot;I am the righteousness of God through Christ Jesus&quot; then, you will see how His power will overcome that sin in your life in Jesus Mighty Name. &quot;AMEN&quot;

The very idea of holiness had been lost to them. To correct this, God began at the bottom. He localized Himself in the cloud and fire, and later when the tabernacle had been built He dwelt in fiery manifestations in the Holy of Holies. By innumerable distinctions God taught Isreal the difference between holy and unholy. There were holy days, holy vessels, holy garments. There were warshings, sacrifices, offerings of many kinds. By these means, Isreal learned that GOD IS HOLY. It was this that He was teaching them, not the holiness of things or places. The holiness of Jehovah was the lesson they must learn. Then came the great day when Christ appeared. Immediately He began to say, &quot;You have heard that it was said to the people long ago,...But i tell you...&quot; (Math 5:21-22) The Old Testament schooling was over. When Christ died on the cross the veil of the temple was rent from top to bottom. The Holy of Holies was opened to everyone who would enter in the faith. Jesus declared, &quot;Believe me, woman a time is coming when you will worship the father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem. You Samaritans worship what you do not know; we worship what we do know, for salvation is from the Jews. Yet a time is coming and has now come when the true worshippers will worship the father in spirit and truth, for they are the kind of whorshippers the father seeks&quot; John 4:21-23. Shortly after, Paul took up the cry of liberty and declared all meats clean, every day holy, all places sacred and every act acceptable to God.

God! Through whom did He make the statement? Prophet Malachi! Who was He sending? John the Baptist! Who did John the Baptist prepare the way for? Jesus Christ! Who then is Jesus Christ?

But many poor people He has led out of poverty through football, do not want to serve Him in return. God is saying that He want footballers to leave fornication and corruption. He want footballers to return back to Him, to serve Him through football. This is why He has called me to lead His spiritual orderliness in the beautiful game. Evang. U N Odigomma

He has called YOU to live as His priest in the game. You are His Royal priests. You should model for the kingdom of God. This is why God said He created the game after human body. Everything about soccer is about human body. He created man in His image. The only way you can not serve Him properly is fornication. It is a direct sin against the body which He gave you for free. Footballers! Time has come for a total change IJN. Evang. u N Odigomma

He created the game after His body, which is His image. Every thing about the game is human body. The body is the greatest equipment to play football. This is why most clubs before they sign a player to play for them, such a player must undergo a fitness test. They wouldn't test your kit, but your body. God gave that body free of charge to players to play the game. But the same players are busy abusing the body given to them free by God throught fornication. The Bible says, &quot;your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit&quot; so why abusing the same body? If you are a player, remain Holy and Righteous and you will see His goodness in your life. Worship God, stay in faith. It's ur time.

When you treat evil with good, you cut yourself from the consequences of reaping from another evil. But when you sow evil for evil or treat evil for evil, you still have many more evils to reap. For instance, you were hurt by someone, instead of allowing the person to reap the consequences of her evil, you choose to avenge. By avenging, you sow seed of unforgiveness, which you will also reap. Learn to allow God fight for you.

He suffered what He believed. Through His suffering, He brought the gospel to us. You have to spread the gospel through your sufferings. While being faithful to what you believe in Him, His grace will manifest to see you through. May His grace see u through ur sufferings IJN

Phil 3:9 In verse 5, Paul discovered that all his knowledge in the law, could not save him. The rich young man in the Bible obeyed the law, yet he needed Jesus for eternal life.  Knowledge of the law can't save us but Jesus. He is righteousness by faith. And not the righteousness by Law. He has defeated the accuser, the condemner, the one who causes fear using the law. This is why Paul said, &quot;therefore there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus&quot; are you in Christ?

Nobody has ever won a race, looking back most of the time. Concentration is in forward looking. Challenges can only be solved looking ahead. Doubters look back, victors look ahead nomatter the negative signs. More victories lies ahead than behind. Keep your head up.

God has made you a star unto Himself. You have been made the blue star that carries stregth to generate heat for energy. The energy is the wealth and fame which the Almighty has left in football for you.just as the Bible said in the quoted scriptures above, you have been giving all it takes to succeed. The Bible says in Eph. 3:20, that you will do exceedinly and aboundantly well according to the powers that work in you. You have been given a power within you by God to shine as a star in glory. What then is stopping your shining? Because you have not yet known your creator. You ought to know that it is only the original inventor of a product that knows it's functionality. God created and knows perfectly well what you will become. He knows your purpose here on earth. We are only here to celebrate why we were born. If you have not yet discoverde that, then you need the help of your inventor, God. Footballers are uniquely made for a reason to promote the word of God through football. But the enemy has taken over the game with corruption and fornication, destroying all God has made. If you are in this game, you must stay away from evil because God is coming to remove all enemies of the game. He is moving in FIFA and He will move into all the federations and confederations to deal with those who has constituted a stumbling block to the progress of the game. Be WISE . (Evang. U N Odigomma)

The story of Naomi in the Bible is a pathetic one. Here, a woman was running away from Bethlehem, Judah, from famine to the land of Maob where they believed all will be well. While in this land, she lost first her husband. As if that was not enough, she lost her two sons who just got married. (Ruth 1:5) While they were in Moab, suffering the attacks of the enemy, the Lord was busy blessing Bethlehem, Judah in their apsence. (Ruth 1:6) She had to move back home as a widow. My Friend, when that opportunity will throw itself at you, make sure you ask the Lord if it was meant for you before you jump into it. Abraham had to hear from the Lord before leaving to the promise land. Do not allow the enemy to trick you from your place of blessing into the place of agony. If not for the intervaintion of the Lord, Naomi would have suffered more. God had to make Ruth to stand by her. God had to make Boaz a blessing to both Ruth Naomi. Despict your mistakes, God is always at hand to rescue you. He is always there to lend a helping hand. Even when we ignore Him, He still stand by us.

It is one thing to know about the love that God has for you, but another thing to actually believe it in your heart. It is one thing to know that the sun shines on us during the day, and another thing to believe that the sun is still shining even though we don't feel it's warmth and all we see are dark clouds. Sometimes, we are slow in believing God's love when we are going through hard times. But God want you to know and believe that He loves you in the midst of all your challenges. So come boldly to His throne of grace to obtain mercy and find  grace (Heb 4:16)
