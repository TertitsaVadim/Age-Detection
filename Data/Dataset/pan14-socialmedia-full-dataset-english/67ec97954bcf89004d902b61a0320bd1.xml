<br />party and
<br /><br />she ended up staying longer than
<br /><br />planned,
<br /><br />and
<br /><br />had to walk home alone. She wasn't
<br /><br />afraid
<br /><br />because it was a small town and she
<br />lived
<br /><br />only
<br /><br />a
<br /><br />few blocks away.
<br /><br />As she walked along under the tall elm
<br /><br />trees,
<br /><br />Diane asked God to keep her safe from
<br /><br />harm
<br /><br />and
<br /><br />danger.
<br /><br />When she reached the alley, which was a
<br /><br />short
<br /><br />cut to her house, she decided to take
<br />it.
<br /><br />However, halfway down the alley she
<br /><br />noticed
<br /><br />a
<br /><br />man standing at the end as though he
<br /><br />were
<br /><br />waiting
<br /><br />for her.
<br /><br />She became uneasy and began to pray,
<br /><br />asking
<br /><br />for
<br /><br />God's protection.
<br /><br />Instantly a comforting feeling of
<br />quietness
<br /><br />and
<br /><br />security wrapped round her, she felt as
<br /><br />though
<br /><br />someone was walking with her.
<br /><br />When she reached the end of the alley,
<br /><br />she
<br /><br />walked right past the man and arrived
<br /><br />home
<br /><br />safely.
<br /><br />The following day, she read in the
<br /><br />newspaper
<br /><br />that
<br /><br />a young girl had been raped in the same
<br /><br />alley
<br /><br />just
<br /><br />twenty minutes after she had been
<br />there.
<br /><br />Feeling overwhelmed by this tragedy and
<br /><br />the
<br /><br />fact
<br /><br />that it could have been her, she began
<br />to
<br /><br />weep.
<br /><br />Thanking the Lord for her safety and to
<br /><br />help
<br /><br />this
<br /><br />young woman, she decided to go to the
<br /><br />police
<br /><br />station.
<br /><br />She felt she could recognize the man,
<br />so
<br /><br />she
<br /><br />told
<br /><br />them her story.
<br /><br />The police asked her if she would be
<br /><br />willing to
<br /><br />look
<br /><br />at a lineup to see if she could
<br />identify
<br /><br />him.
<br /><br />She agreed and immediately pointed out
<br /><br />the
<br /><br />man
<br /><br />she had seen in the alley the night
<br /><br />before.
<br /><br />When the man was told he had been
<br /><br />identified,
<br /><br />he
<br /><br />immediately broke down and confessed.
<br /><br />The officer thanked Diane for her
<br />bravery
<br /><br />and
<br /><br />asked if there was anything they could
<br />do
<br /><br />for
<br /><br />her.
<br /><br />She asked if they would ask the man one
<br /><br />question.
<br /><br />Diane was curious as to why he had not
<br /><br />attacked
<br /><br />her.
<br /><br />When the policeman asked him, he
<br /><br />answered, &quot;Because she wasn't alone.
<br /><br />She
<br /><br />had
<br /><br />two tall men walking on either side of
<br /><br />her.&quot;
<br /><br />Amazingly, whether you believe or not,
<br /><br />you're
<br /><br />never alone. Did you know that 98% of
<br /><br />teenagers
<br /><br />will not stand up for God?
<br /><br />Repost this as A GIRL RAPED IN (your
<br />city) if you truly
<br /><br />believe
<br /><br />in
<br /><br />God..,
<br /><br />PS: God is always there in your heart
<br />and loves you no matter what
<br /><br />&quot;If you deny me in front of your
<br />friends, I shall deny you in front of
<br />my Father&quot;
<br /><br />STAND UP FOR HIM

<br />2. We don't enjoy talking dirty to you as much as you enjoy listening.
<br />3. Don't say you understand when you don't.
<br />4. Girls are pretty, but yours is ALWAYS the prettiest!
<br />5. You don't have PMS; don't fuckin' act like you know what it's like.
<br />6. Saying something sweet might get you off the hook; doing something sweet will always get you off the hook.
<br />7. If you talk about having a Big Dick; we know you don't.
<br />8. Size does matter, but only to hoes; not girls that want real relationships.
<br />9. We don't like it when you act like Mr. Big.
<br />10. A system in your car only impresses your homeboys, not us.
<br />11. No matter what you say, your ex-girlfriend is a hoe.
<br />12. It's good to be sensitive, sometimes.
<br />13. If you did something wrong or even if you didn't, apologize.
<br />14. Be spontaneous; dinner and a movie won't always cut it.
<br />15. We are self-conscious by nature; we can't help it.
<br />16. We are Drama queens.
<br />17. Fashion police do exist.
<br />18. Don't ask us to give you head; if you are nice you just might get it.
<br />19. We absolutely DO NOT care about monster trucks, car systems, paintball, or anything else you and your friends talk about. In other words shut the fuck up.
<br />20. Hugs and kisses must be given at all times!
<br />21. We don't shave our legs everyday, so get over it.
<br />22. Don't make bets about us; we will always find out.
<br />23. Shave; no matter how cool you think your goatee or beard or mustache looks, we always hate it.
<br />24. Even if you think it is cool to burp, fart, or emitt other strange gases from your body, it isnt, so DON'T.
<br />25. Don't compare our breasts with Pamela Anderson's; hers are fake, just remember that. (You have a better shot at ours than you ever will with hers, you may as well give it up now).
<br />26. It's not cool to shoot snot rockets.
<br />27. We are beautiful - at ALL times.
<br />28. We will always think we are fat, so humor us and tell us we aren't.
<br />29. You can shoot hoops, score a goal, knock down big fat guys, and hit a little baseball with a stick, so why the hell cant you piss in the toilet and not on it.
<br />30. Most importantly: we are always right; so don't forget it!
<br /><br />THIS IS 100% TRUE!

<br /><br />Girl: Ricardo, what do u mean?
<br /><br />Boy: Something has come up...
<br /><br />Girl: What? What's wrong? Is it bad?
<br /><br />Boy: I don't want to hurt you, baby.
<br /><br />Girl: *Thinks* Oh my God, I hope he doesnt break up with me... I love him so 
<br />much.
<br /><br />Boy: Baby, are you there??
<br /><br />Girl: Yeah, I'm here. What is so important??
<br /><br />Boy: I'm not sure if I should say it..
<br /><br />Girl: Well, you already brought it up, so please just tell me.
<br /><br />Boy: I'm leaving...
<br /><br />Girl: Baby, what are u talking about?? I don't want you to leave me, I love 
<br />you.
<br /><br />Boy: Not like that, I mean I'm moving far away.
<br /><br />Girl: Why? All of your famliy lives over here.
<br /><br />Boy: Well, my father is sending me away to a boarding school far
<br />away.
<br /><br />Girl: I can't believe this.
<br /><br />[FATHER: (Picks up the other phone, interrupts &amp; yells furiously
<br />ERICA!, what did I tell you about talking to boys?!!!... Get off the damn 
<br />phone!! (And hangs up).]
<br /><br />Boy: Wow, your father sounds really mad.
<br /><br />Girl: You know how he gets, but anyways, I dont want you to go.
<br /><br />Boy: Would you run away with me?
<br /><br />Girl: Baby, you know I would, I would do anything for you, but I can't... 
<br />You don't know what would happen if I did. My dad would kill me!
<br /><br />Boy: *Sad* It's okay.. I understand, I guess..
<br /><br />Girl: *Thinking*I can't believe what's going on.
<br /><br />Boy: I need to give you something tonite, because I am leaving on flight 
<br />1-80 in the morning, so I need to see you now.
<br /><br />Girl: Okay, I will sneak out &amp; meet you at the park.
<br /><br />Boy: Okay, I'll meet you there in 20 minutes.
<br /><br />[They meet at a nearby park, they both hug eachother. And he gives her a 
<br />note.]
<br /><br />Boy: Here you go, this is for you. I gotta go.
<br /><br />Girl: *Tear* (Begins to cry.)
<br /><br />Boy: Baby, dont cry, you know I love you... But I have to go.
<br /><br />Girl: Okay (Begins to walk away.)
<br /><br />[They both go back home. And Erica begins to read the letter he gave her]
<br /><br />It says...
<br /><br />&quot;Erica,
<br />          You probably already know that I'm leaving, I knew this would be 
<br />better if I wrote a letter explaining the truth about how much I care about 
<br />you. The truth is, is that I never loved you, I hated you so much, you are 
<br />my bitch and dont you ever forget that. I never cared about you, and never 
<br />wanted to talk to you, and be around you. You really have no clue how much I 
<br />hate you. Now that I'm leaving I thought you should know that I hate you, 
<br />bitch. You never did the right thing, and you were never there. I didnt 
<br />think I could hate someone as much as I hate you. And I never want to see 
<br />you, for the rest of my life, I will never miss kissing you like before, I 
<br />never want to cuddle up, how we used to. I will not miss you and that's a 
<br />promise. You never had my love, and I want you to remember that. Bitch, you 
<br />keep this letter because this may be the last thing you have from me. Fuck, 
<br />I hate you so much. I will not talk to you soon bitch... Goodbye.
<br />- Ricardo&quot;
<br /><br />[ Erica begins to cry, she throws the paper in tha garbage crys for hours ]
<br /><br />.... A day passes, she is sad, depressed and she feels so lonely... Then she 
<br />gets a phone call....
<br /><br />Friend: How are you feeling?
<br /><br />Girl: I just cant believe this happened.. I thought he loved me.
<br /><br />Friend: Oh, about that. Ricardo left me a message. A few days ago. He told 
<br />me to tell you to look in your jacket pocket or something...
<br /><br />Girl: Umm.. okay.
<br /><br />[She finds a piece of paper in the jacket,
<br /><br />It says:
<br /><br />&quot;Baby I hope you find this before you read my letter. I knew your dad might 
<br />read it, so I switched a few words...
<br /><br />Hate = Love
<br /><br />Never = Always
<br /><br />Bitch = Baby
<br /><br />Will not= will
<br /><br />..... I hope you didn't take that seriously because I love you with all my 
<br />heart, and it was so hard to let you go thats why I wanted you to run away 
<br />with me...
<br /><br />-Ricardo&quot;]
<br /><br />Girl: Oh my God! It's a letter.. Ricardo does love me!!, he must of
<br />slipped it into my pocket when he hugged me. I can't believe how stupid I 
<br />am!!
<br /><br />Friend: lol Okay but I g2g... Call me later.
<br /><br />Girl: *happy*okay, bye, I'll be at home waiting for my baby to call me!
<br /><br />.... Erica turns the T.V. on......
<br /><br />[Breaking news] &quot;An airplane has crashed. Over 47 young boys died,
<br />&gt;we are still searching for survivors... This is a tragedy we will never 
<br />&gt;forget, this plane was flight 1-80... it was on its way to an all boys 
<br />&gt;boarding school...&quot; the Reporter says.
<br /><br />[ She turns off the t.v. ... 3 days later, she kills herself,
<br />because of the fact that Ricardo was dead &amp; she had nothing to live
<br />for... ]
<br /><br />.... A day after that the phone rings. Nobody answers. It was
<br />Ricardo, he called to leave a message. &quot;Its Ricardo, I guess you're not home 
<br />so, I called to let you know that I'm alive, I missed my flight because I 
<br />had to see you one last time. So, I hope your not worried. I am staying for 
<br />good...

<br />When broken bodies lay about
<br />&quot;And blood was everywhere,&quot;
<br />&quot;The sirens screamed out eulogies,&quot;
<br />For death was in the air.
<br />&quot;A mother, trapped inside her car,&quot;
<br />Was heard above the noise;
<br />Her plaintive plea near split the air:
<br />&quot;Oh, God, please spare my boys!&quot;
<br />She fought to loose her pinned hands;
<br />She struggled to get free,&quot;
<br />But mangled metal held her fast
<br />In grim captivity.
<br />Her frightened eyes then focused
<br />&quot;On where the back seat once had been,&quot;
<br />But all she saw was broken glass and
<br />Two children's seats crushed in.
<br />Her twins were nowhere to be seen;
<br />&quot;She did not hear them cry, &quot;
<br />&quot;And then she prayed they'd been thrown free, &quot;
<br />&quot;Oh, God, don't let them die! &quot;
<br />Then firemen came and cut her loose, &quot;
<br />&quot;But when they searched the back, &quot;
<br />&quot;They found therein no little boys, &quot;
<br />But the seat belts were intact.
<br />They thought the woman had gone mad
<br />&quot;And was traveling alone, &quot;
<br />&quot;But when they turned to question her, &quot;
<br />They discovered she was gone.
<br />Policemen saw her running wild
<br />And screaming above the noise
<br />&quot;In beseeching supplication, &quot;
<br />Please help me find my boys!
<br />They're four years old and wear blue shirts;
<br />&quot;Their jeans are blue to match.&quot;&quot;
<br />&quot;One cop spoke up, &quot;&quot;They're in my car, &quot;
<br />And they don't have a scratch.
<br />They said their daddy put them there
<br />&quot;And gave them each a cone, &quot;
<br />Then told them both to wait for Mom
<br />To come and take them home.
<br />&quot;I've searched the area high and low, &quot;
<br />But I can't find their dad.
<br />&quot;He must have fled the scene, &quot;
<br />&quot;I guess, and that is very bad.&quot;
<br />&quot;The mother hugged the twins and said, &quot;
<br />&quot;While wiping at a tear, &quot;
<br />&quot;He could not flee the scene, you see, &quot;
<br />&quot;For he's been dead a year.&quot;
<br />&quot;The cop just looked confused and asked, &quot;
<br />&quot;Now, how can that be true? &quot;
<br />&quot;The boys said, &quot;&quot;Mommy, Daddy came &quot;
<br />&quot;And left a kiss for you.&quot;&quot; &quot;
<br />He told us not to worry
<br />&quot;And that you would be all right, &quot;
<br />And then he put us in this car with
<br />&quot;The pretty, flashing light. &quot;
<br />&quot;We wanted him to stay with us, &quot;
<br />&quot;Because we miss him so, &quot;
<br />&quot;But Mommy, he just hugged us tight &quot;
<br />And said he had to go.
<br />He said someday we'd understand
<br />&quot;And told us not to fuss, &quot;
<br />&quot;And he said to tell you, Mommy, &quot;
<br />&quot;He's watching over us.&quot;
<br />The mother knew without a doubt
<br />&quot;That what they spoke was true, &quot;
<br />&quot;For she recalled their dad's last words, &quot;
<br />&quot; I will watch over you.&quot;
<br />The firemen's notes could not explain
<br />&quot;The twisted, mangled car, &quot;
<br />And how the three of them escaped
<br />Without a single scar.
<br />&quot;But on the cop's report was scribed, &quot;
<br />&quot;In print so very fine, &quot;
<br />An angel walked the beat tonight on Highway 109.
<br />&quot;The 7 Second Prayer, Just repeat this phrase and see how God
<br />moves.
<br />&quot;Lord, I love you and I need you, come into my heart, and 
<br />bless my family, my home, my friends, and me. Amen. &quot;
<br />Pass this message to 7 people {EXCEPT YOU AND ME}.
<br />You will receive a miracle tomorrow.
<br />He who has a thousand friends has not a friend to spare.
<br />This morning when the Lord opened a window to Heaven, He saw 
<br />me, and He asked: &quot;My child, what is your greatest wish for today?&quot; I responded:
<br />&quot;Lord please, take care of the person who is reading this
<br />message, their family and their special friends. They deserve it and I love them very much. &quot; The love of God is like the ocean, you can see its beginning, but not its end.This message works on the day you receive it.
<br />&lt;&lt;qqimstp_wine_glass_en.gif&gt;&gt;
<br />Let us see if it is true.
<br />ANGELS EXIST but some times, since they don't all have wings, 
<br />we call   them FRIENDS.
<br />Pass this on to your true friends.
<br />Something good will happen to you at 11:11 in the evening;
<br />something   that you have been waiting to hear.
<br />Do not break this prayer; send it to a minimum of 5 friends.

<br />And remembered what you said.
<br />You told me not to drink, Mom,
<br />so I had a Sprite instead.
<br /><br />I felt proud of myself,
<br />The way you said I would,
<br />that I didn't drink and drive,
<br />though some friends said I should.
<br /><br />I made a healthy choice,
<br />And your advice to me was right.
<br />The party finally ended,
<br />and the kids drove out of sight.
<br /><br />I got into my car,
<br />Sure to get home in one piece.
<br />I never knew what was coming, Mom,
<br />something that I expected least.
<br /><br />Now I'm lying on the pavement,
<br />And I hear the policeman say,
<br />&quot;The kid that caused this wreck was drunk,&quot;
<br />Mom, his voice seems far away.
<br /><br />My own blood's all around me,
<br />As I try hard not to cry.
<br />I can hear the paramedic say,
<br />&quot;This girl is going to die.&quot;
<br /><br />I'm sure the guy had no idea,
<br />While he was flying high.
<br />Because he chose to drink and drive,
<br />now I would have to die.
<br /><br />So why do people do it, Mom
<br />Knowing that it ruins lives?               
<br />And now the pain is cutting me,
<br />like a hundred stabbing knives.
<br /><br />Tell sister not to be afraid, Mom
<br />Tell daddy to be brave.
<br />And when I go to heaven,
<br />put &quot;Mommy's Girl&quot; on my grave.
<br /><br />Someone should have taught him,
<br />That it's wrong to drink and drive.
<br />Maybe if his parents had,
<br />I'd still be alive.
<br /><br />My breath is getting shorter, Mom
<br />I'm getting really scared
<br />These are my final moments,
<br />and I'm so unprepared.
<br /><br />I wish that you could hold me Mom,
<br />As I lie here and die.
<br />I wish that I could Tell you i love you,
<br />So I love you and good-bye...

<br /><br />okay so a guy is
<br />near the
<br />end of his
<br />senior
<br />year in high school.
<br />Unfortunately,
<br />he still has to share a room with his
<br />younger
<br />brother who is only 9
<br />years
<br />old.
<br /><br />One night, he decides to bring his
<br />girlfriend home
<br />for a little fun.
<br />They
<br />have bunk beds and the guy notices that
<br />his little
<br />brother is already
<br />asleep
<br />on the lower bunk, so he and his
<br />girlfriend climb
<br />up
<br />to the top bunk.
<br />As you
<br />might expect things start to heat up.
<br /><br />The guy remembers that his little brother
<br />is
<br />sleeping below so he tells
<br />his
<br />girlfriend to whisper &quot;lettuce&quot; if she wants
<br />it
<br />harder and &quot;tomato&quot; if
<br />she
<br />wants a new position.

<br /><br />Tomato!!!
<br /><br />Whoa!!!
<br /><br />PULL IT OUT!!!
<br /><br />PULL IT OUT NOW!!!
<br /><br />I can't get pregnant!
<br /><br />Then the little brother shouts out, &quot;Hey,
<br />would you
<br />guys stop making
<br />sandwiches up there! You're getting
<br />mayonnaise
<br />all over my
<br />face!*!*!*!*!&quot;
