They make solvent degreasing plants, aqueous degreasing plants, solvent recovery systems, and more. They are widely regarded as one of the leaders in this field, and their machines are touted for being efficient and effective. <br /><br />One of their most popular units is called the Pero R1 Vapour Degreasing Plant. Pero released this machine back in 2009, and it is the only vapour degreasing plant that can run with nothing other than power, air, and water. Vapour degreasing is far more effective than older forms of cleaning. This machine warms up quickly (in 60 minutes), and it also has a low power mode where it can be “woken” up very quickly as well. This allows you to get work all that much faster. It also means that you will use less energy because the machine will be on for less time overall. <br /><br />The best thing about this degreasing machine is its efficiency, and the Pero R1 can clean up to 2000 kg of parts in one hour. It processes a batch every three or four minutes (depending on the unit type you are using), and it can accommodate baskets with up to 80 kg of parts. This allows your company to become very efficient, and some businesses have even been able to drop a full shift after purchasing this machine. In addition to being efficient, the machine also has a relatively small footprint, and it is about 2.6 m wide and 1.6 m deep (without its charging unit) and 2.55 m tall. <br /><br />You can purchase a Pero R1 in the UK from Kumi Solutions, the UK’s sole distributor of Pero degreasing machines. They have a single bath unit and a twin bath unit available. The single bath unit processes a load every three minutes, while the twin bath unit takes slightly longer at four minutes. They have the solvent capacity of 217 litres and 338 litres respectively, and they can be equipped for ultrasonic cleaning. Additionally, this machine is called the “True Universal Machine” because it can accept so many different types of solvents, including alcohols, chlorinated hydrocarbons, and hydrocarbons. <br /><br />Kumi Solutions can help you determine if the Pero R1 is the right machine for your company. They can also help you find aqueous parts washers and parts washing accessories. They offer everything your company needs for efficient and effective parts washing. <br /><br />They are based in Nuneaton, and they regularly have free cleaning trials at their facility. This means that people can visit their facility to see the degreasing machines in action. You can even bring some of your own dirty parts to be washed. This lets you see exactly how these machines will work with your specific parts. <br /><br />If you are interested in learning more about the degreasing machines that Kumi Solutions sells, you should contact them today. <br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2NvbW11bml0eS5iYWJ5Y2VudGVyLmNvbS9qb3VybmFsL25vdWR0aHlzc2VuNTExLzM2MDc0NzcvcGVyb19kZWdyZWFzaW5nX21hY2hpbmVz" target="_blank">Pero Degreasing Machines</a>

They make solvent degreasing plants, aqueous degreasing plants, solvent recovery systems, and more. They are widely regarded as one of the leaders in this field, and their machines are touted for being efficient and effective. <br /><br />One of their most popular units is called the Pero R1 Vapour Degreasing Plant. Pero released this machine back in 2009, and it is the only vapour degreasing plant that can run with nothing other than power, air, and water. Vapour degreasing is far more effective than older forms of cleaning. This machine warms up quickly (in 60 minutes), and it also has a low power mode where it can be “woken” up very quickly as well. This allows you to get work all that much faster. It also means that you will use less energy because the machine will be on for less time overall. <br /><br />The best thing about this degreasing machine is its efficiency, and the Pero R1 can clean up to 2000 kg of parts in one hour. It processes a batch every three or four minutes (depending on the unit type you are using), and it can accommodate baskets with up to 80 kg of parts. This allows your company to become very efficient, and some businesses have even been able to drop a full shift after purchasing this machine. In addition to being efficient, the machine also has a relatively small footprint, and it is about 2.6 m wide and 1.6 m deep (without its charging unit) and 2.55 m tall. <br /><br />You can purchase a Pero R1 in the UK from Kumi Solutions, the UK’s sole distributor of Pero degreasing machines. They have a single bath unit and a twin bath unit available. The single bath unit processes a load every three minutes, while the twin bath unit takes slightly longer at four minutes. They have the solvent capacity of 217 litres and 338 litres respectively, and they can be equipped for ultrasonic cleaning. Additionally, this machine is called the “True Universal Machine” because it can accept so many different types of solvents, including alcohols, chlorinated hydrocarbons, and hydrocarbons. <br /><br />Kumi Solutions can help you determine if the Pero R1 is the right machine for your company. They can also help you find aqueous parts washers and parts washing accessories. They offer everything your company needs for efficient and effective parts washing. <br /><br />They are based in Nuneaton, and they regularly have free cleaning trials at their facility. This means that people can visit their facility to see the degreasing machines in action. You can even bring some of your own dirty parts to be washed. This lets you see exactly how these machines will work with your specific parts. <br /><br />If you are interested in learning more about the degreasing machines that Kumi Solutions sells, you should contact them today. <br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL25vdWR0aHlzc2VuNTExLmppZ3N5LmNvbS9lbnRyaWVzL2dlbmVyYWwvcGVyby1kZWdyZWFzaW5nLW1hY2hpbmVzLTk_" target="_blank">Pero Degreasing Machines</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wdXJldm9sdW1lLmNvbS9ub3VkdGh5c3NlbjUxMS9wb3N0cy8xMzQ1MDk4L1Blcm8rRGVncmVhc2luZytNYWNoaW5lcw__" target="_blank">Pero Degreasing Machines</a>
