<br />Matthew 1:21 NIV 
<br /><br />Be it known unto you therefore, men and brethren, that through this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins: and by him all that believe are justified from all things, from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses. 
<br />Acts 13:38,39 KJV 
<br /><br />And inasmuch as it is appointed for men to die once and after this comes judgment, so Christ also, having been offered once to bear the sins of many, will appear a second time for salvation without reference to sin, to those who eagerly await Him.

<br /><br />Matthew 6:27	 	 Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature?

<br /><br />Matthew 6:30	 	 Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to day is, and to morrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith?

<br /><br />If you don’t believe in yourself nor your dreams, you will be left wondering and nothing will ever satisfy you.
<br /><br />Live purposeful!
<br /><br />Ephesians 5:14-17  Amplified Bible (AMP)
<br />14Therefore He says, Awake, O sleeper, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall shine (make day dawn) upon you and give you light.
<br />15Look carefully then how you walk! Live purposefully and worthily and accurately, not as the unwise and witless, but as wise (sensible, intelligent people),
<br />16Making the very most of the time [buying up each opportunity], because the days are evil.
<br />17Therefore do not be vague and thoughtless and foolish, but understanding and firmly grasping what the will of the Lord is.
<br />Proverbs 29:18    Amplified Bible (AMP)
<br />18Where there is no vision [no redemptive revelation of God], the people perish; but he who keeps the law [of God, which includes that of man]--blessed (happy, fortunate, and enviable) is he.
<br /><br />Example:  Luke 18:35
<br />Bartimaeus = “Son of Value”
<br />Bartimaeus, the blind man by the bath of Bethesda, felt hopeless.  For 38 years he had to sit and watch how other people around him were healed and he just stayed sick.  But his healing came.
<br />John 20:29 Amplified Bible (AMP)
<br />29Jesus said to him, Because you have seen Me, Thomas, do you now believe (trust, have faith)? Blessed and happy and [a]to be envied are those who have never seen Me and yet have believed and adhered to and trusted and relied on Me.
<br />What is your dream and do you follow your dream?
<br />Proverbs 16:4   Amplified Bible (AMP)
<br />4The Lord has made everything [to accommodate itself and contribute] to its own end and His own purpose--even the wicked [are fitted for their role] for the day of calamity and evil.
<br />We are called to make a difference in this world, in your family, in your workplace and in your church.
<br />Then you must have an intimate relationship with Jesus.
<br /><br />We have a purpose on earth.  The church is here on earth with a purpose and you are a part of it.
<br /><br />Bill Hybels once said:  We are made to help God to live out His vision.
<br /><br />God is constantly busy filling His people with favour, grace and power, so that he can repair the broken planet.
<br /><br />Fear holds you back.  People are scared of change.
<br /><br />Don’t give up hope, keep on dreaming and moving forward.
<br /><br />John Maxwell says that someone who has a dream knows what he is willing to give up to achieve that dream.
<br /><br />You are part of God’s bigger plan.
<br /><br />It takes sacrifice, but in the end, it’s worth it.
