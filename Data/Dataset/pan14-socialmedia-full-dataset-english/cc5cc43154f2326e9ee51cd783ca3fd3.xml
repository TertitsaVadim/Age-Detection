<br /><br />So, here is a series of promises that really speaks to true friendship:
<br /><br />1. When you are sad - I will help you get drunk and plot revenge against the sorry bastard who made you that way. 
<br /><br />2. When you are blue - I will try to dislodge whatever is choking you.
<br /><br />3. When you smile - I will know you've finally had Sex. 
<br /><br />4. When you are scared - I will tease the crap out of you about it every chance I get.
<br /><br />5. When you are worried - I will tell you horrible stories about how much worse it could be and to stop your bloody whining. 
<br /><br />6. When you are confused - I will use only little words. 
<br /><br />7. When you are sick - Stay the hell away from me until you are well again, I don't want whatever you have.
<br /><br />8. When you fall - I will point and laugh at your clumsiness.
<br /><br />This is my oath...I pledge it till the end. Why you may ask?
<br /><br />Because you are my friend.
<br /><br />Remember: A good friend will help you move. A really good friend will help you move a body .
<br /><br />Let me know if I ever need to bring a shovel.

<br /><br />Nobody understands why I love you. But I don't want to tell them, because I am afraid that they'll fall in love with you too. 
<br /><br />love is when you ask him what he did last night and he says &quot;i dreamed about you&quot;
<br /><br />Every girl wants a man, that she can go to in her sweats, hair a mess, make-up running down her face, eyes red from crying, and the first thing he says to her is &quot;baby, your b e a u t i f u l&quot; and means it!

<br />If you are my friend, please answer me this: 
<br />Are we friends, or are we not? 
<br />You told me once, but I forgot. 
<br />So tell me now, and tell me true, 
<br />So I can say &quot;I'm here for you.&quot; 
<br />Of all the friends I've ever met, 
<br />You're the one I won't forget. 
<br />And if I die before you do, 
<br />I'll go to Heaven and wait for you, 
<br />I'll give the angels back their wings
<br />And risk the loss of everything.
<br />There isn't a thing I wouldn't do, 
<br />To have a friend just like you!

<br />*he paused to stand*
<br />*as he took his class ring* 
<br />*off her hand*
<br />*all who were watching* 
<br />*did not speak* *as a silent tear*
<br />*ran down his cheek* 
<br />*and through his mind*
<br />*the memories ran*
<br />*of the moments they walked*
<br />*and ran in the sand hand and hand* 
<br />*but now her eyes were so terrible cold*
<br />*for he would never again*
<br />*have her to hold*
<br />*they watched in silence*
<br />*as he bent near* 
<br />*and whispered the words..*
<br />*&quot;I LOVE YOU&quot; in her ear* 
<br />*he touched her face and started to cry* 
<br />*as he put on his ring and wanted to die*
<br />*and just then the wind began to blow* 
<br />*as they lowered her casket*
<br />*into the snow....*
<br />*this is what happens* 
<br />*to man alive.....* 
<br />*when friends let friends....*
<br />*drink and drive.*

<br />*And you think you're alone*
<br />*I'll be there*

<br />The misfits. The rebels. 
<br />The troublemakers. 
<br />The round pegs in the square holes. 
<br />The ones who see things differently. 
<br />They aren't fond of rules. 
<br />And they have no respect for the status quo. 
<br />You can quote them. Disagree with them. 
<br />Glorify or Villify them. But the only thing you can't do is ignore them. 
<br />Because they change things. 
<br />They push the human race forward. 
<br />And while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius. 
<br />Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do

<br />how long will it be for u to realize 
<br />words on a screen won't get you a date 
<br />and if anyone can i can relate 
<br />don't keep your thoughts in your heart and your head 
<br />speak what you're thinking, be forward instead 
<br />you may be too scared afraid of rejection 
<br />but in the future it'll be a reflection 
<br />of your courage to say what you're feeling inside 
<br />the words that you spoke and chose not to hide
