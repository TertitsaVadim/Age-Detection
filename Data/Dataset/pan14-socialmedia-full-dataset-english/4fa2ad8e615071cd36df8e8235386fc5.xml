Contrary to press reports, cereal makers have not stopped using recycled cardboard boxes and, if they are to be believed, recycled cardboard converters have not reported a drop in demand.<br /><br />So, is the recycled cardboard box really something to be scared of?<br /><br />Given the fervour with which the nationals whipped up the story when it broke, perhaps it was no small irony that the potential cancer risk stems from mineral oil in inks used in, wait for it – newspapers. Newsprint, very often itself made from paper that has been recycled several times, tends to end up as recycled cardboard as there isn’t much else that can be made with it.<br /><br />In March, Koni Grob, of the Food Safety Laboratory in Zurich, announced his toxicology team had found that the mineral oils in printing ink from recycled newspapers turned into cardboard could get into foods.<br /><br />While admitting humans would only be exposed to tiny individual doses, Dr Grob claimed that the oils had been linked to inflammation of internal organs, and in the worst cases, cancer. Worryingly, 89 of 119 items bought from German supermarkets last year, which were mainly cereal, pasta and rice products, exceeded recommended mineral oil limits, and most exceeded it by as much as 10 times.<br /><br />Just as concerning, Grob found that commonly used inner plastic bags had no protective effect. In fact, only aluminium foil was effective.<br /><br />Not long after the study was made public, however, the Food Standards Authority (FSA) was quick to downplay fears. In a statement, it said: &quot;We are not aware of any firm evidence to suggest there are food safety risks related to mineral oils in recycled food packaging. The research is interesting, but due to incomplete data the results have not demonstrated that mineral oils in food packaging represent a food safety risk.&quot;<br /><br />Yet, the FSA hasn’t dismissed the findings completely. Instead, along with the European Food Standards Authority (EFSA) it has decided to conduct its own research into mineral oil food contamination, the results of which are expected in the autumn.<br /><br />New solutions<br />In the meantime, it has effectively given the green light for food manufacturers to carry on as normal. Still, producers are understandably taking the issue seriously. Kellogg’s says it’s working with its suppliers on new packaging to allow it to meet environmental commitments but also contain significantly lower levels of mineral oil.<br /><br />Jordans, meanwhile, switched from 80% recycled cardboard to an FSC-accredited board for a number of its products before the scare arose, not as a response to it, as was reported at the time.<br /><br />Those working in print understand the nervousness food manufacturers must feel. Steve Wicks, director at eco-orientated print manager Greenprint Consultancy, believes any price rise food manufacturers would incur switching from recycled to virgin-fibre carton and cartonboard would pale into insignificance against a potential lawsuit if the boxes were found to be harmful to humans.<br /><br />While stressing he is no expert on the toxicological effects of mineral oil, Wicks calls for a rational response. And that is the point – there is no good reason to change at the moment.&quot;<br /><br />Source: Print Week UK<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5qdWtlYm94YWxpdmUuY29tL2Jsb2cucGhwP2Jsb2dfaWQ9MTAyMDcwNTU_" target="_blank">Could postal deregulation bring about a two-tier service?</a>

However, despite the best efforts of Fujifilm, Screen, HP, Xeikon, MGI and Landa, plus those of a Ryobi/Miyakoshi partnership, show director Manuel Mataré says the epithet is a little premature for the self-styled 'Olympics of print'.<br /><br />&quot;It’s too early to predict what title will be bestowed on Drupa 2012,&quot; he asserts. &quot;What I do think, though, is that rather than one single technology or one single element, the thing to come out of Drupa 2012 will be the message of different technologies working together for the best possible print outcome.&quot;<br /><br />He adds that speaking in terms of technology is also a little outdated, as print shows and the print offerings of manufacturers are now as much about business as about technology. Manufacturers are going into Drupa heavily promoting their respective business programmes, while also talking much more about practical commercial applications of kit, rather than just the kit itself.<br /><br />So if not the ‘B2 Drupa’, perhaps this will be the ‘practical Drupa’ –in the sense of technologies working together for the greater good, and in the way that the practical application of kit is more important than ever.<br /><br />Exhibitors certainly seem to have been practical with R&amp;D budgets; reduced spends have not led to the anticipated absence of inventiveness.<br /><br />In pre-press, visitors can expect to be taken into a whole new dimension as a focus on ‘the cloud’ appears to be defining the sector – though as our preview pointed out last month, picking and choosing when to use that technology is crucial if you’re to make the most of it. Elsewhere, there are new CTP launches from the likes of Kodak, Agfa and Basyprint; plate launches from companies including Esko, Fujifilm and Presstek; and a wide range of software upgrades and new launches. Of the latter, Chilli Publish is attracting a lot of attention with its ‘InDesign in the cloud’ product, while Heidelberg’s Prinect Business Manager and the PantoneLive platform are both generating column inches.<br /><br />In presses, as we have discussed, it appears B2 digital is set to grab the headlines. However, there is much more to talk about. For example, there’s the return of Benny Landa; a real surge into packaging solutions; and the various practical (that word again) link-ups between litho and digital manufacturers. Partnerships particularly catching the eye are those of Timsons and Kodak, KBA and RR Donnelley and Konica Minolta and Komori. Over in wide-format, the continued evolution of latex solutions and a renewed focus on the pres-press and post-press elements of print are making headlines.<br /><br />Into post-press, and here it really is about the hand following the eye: post-press manufacturers striving to create machines that match what the press manufacturers are producing. This means more automation, more inline options, and an ability to cope with digital’s increasing speed.  Innovations on show include the Digimaster series from Morgana, new cutting equipment from Zünd and Kongsberg, a new feeder from Horizon and a new UV-spot laminator from Autobond.<br /><br />As Mataré says, though, alongside all these technological advances are a raft of environment and business ideas, alongside conferences and talks taking place all over the Messe halls. And to be able to get all that for the price of an air fare and a day ticket seems reasonable.<br /><br />Source: Print Week UK<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5qdWtlYm94YWxpdmUuY29tL2Jsb2cucGhwP2Jsb2dfaWQ9MTAyMzY5MjE_" target="_blank">Email Marketing To Increase Your Profits And Keep Customers</a>

She says the reasons for this are based not necessarily on ignorance, but more on time pressures. <br /><br />&quot;In this market, customers, particularly the smaller ones, don’t have a lot of time to build up a detailed knowledge of the environment, so they are reliant on certain certificates,&quot; explains Branch. &quot;For the customer, it needs to be simple.&quot;<br /><br />It is not surprising, then, that those credentials that can be expressed in the form of an official stamp of independent approval, rather than uncorroborated claims, are frequently cited as most desirable by print buyers. Not that the official stamps narrow the eco field of appraisal too far – there is still a wide comparison of accreditations, certificates and stamps to be made. <br /><br />At least unofficially, among the well known-names of FSC, PEFC, EMAS and countless others, print buyers do tend to place a higher regard on ISO 14001, an internationally recognised system monitoring the environmental targets companies set themselves and how they achieve and improve upon them. <br /><br />This certification is seen as a must-have for many print buyers, Parker says, and it is certainly no secret that the UK’s biggest print buyers need this in place before the sales process even begins.  <br /><br />The number of printers pursuing and gaining the accreditation suggests that they have recognised the power the ISO holds in print buyers’ eyes. But Chris Head, health, safety and environmental manager at Howitt, says the badge is more than attractive clothing to entice a buyer. Rather it has tangible benefits to the company as well, being a valuable tool to ensure that businesses achieve a high environmental performance. <br /><br />&quot;We look at it more from a point of view of what ISO 14001 can do for us,&quot; he says. &quot;If you have good benchmarking and good objectives and targets it can actually deliver quite a good saving for the company. <br /><br />For instance, waste on this particular site in 2005 was more than 500 tonnes to landfill; last year it was less than 25 tonnes. So the management of those parts of the business is extremely important and can produce a saving.&quot;<br /><br />Head does concede, however, that, for smaller businesses, the costs of achieving ISO 14001 recognition could be prohibitive. Expenditures to be taken into account are the twice-yearly audits, costing around a £1,000 each, and of course the salaries of workers like Head who ensure the systems are implemented. For print buyers to give precedence to an ISO seems an unfair bias, then, against smaller operations. <br /><br />That said, there are cheaper ways of implementing the ISO 14001 than the most widely respected UKAS accredited scheme. But this might not get them very far with buyers who see a UKAS verified ISO 14001 as a must.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2JnbS5tZS9yLzIxMTc0MzU_" target="_blank">Banner picks up Carphone Warehouse contract off HH Global</a>

Its drivers weigh the plates and then calculate any credit that the clients are owed, which is used to offset any chemical charges incurred on the day of collection.<br /><br />Once transported to the company’s sites the plates are weighed and bundled onto pallets before being melted down and reused as a pure raw material.<br /><br />Items such as batteries are collected by J&amp;G Environmental before being dispatched to a registered recycling contractor. The batteries are sorted, segregated and stripped down to their components, which include metal, plastic and electrolyte.<br />Chemicals such as solvents are decanted, treated and stored. Any reclaimed petroleum is then reused as third-grade fuel by a licensed contractor while hazardous components are converted to an inert sludge and non-hazardous liquid.<br /><br />THE JOURNEY OF RECYCLED PAPER<br />The paper waste produced at a print site, in the form of overs, trimmings, makereadies and plain sheets, begins its recycling journey when it is collected and taken to a sorting centre. Here the paper is separated into different categories according to type and grade; these categories include office waste, old magazine papers, newsprint, cardboard and corrugated cardboard.<br /><br />For the manufacture of high-quality paper that is not obviously recycled it is essential to use good-quality sorted office waste that can be used to produce high quality white pulp.<br /><br />Julian Long, national key account manager for paper manufacturer Arjowiggins Graphics explains: &quot;We are a large consumer of waste for recycling and for top- quality paper that has the same characteristics as virgin fibre, we need good-quality sorted waste. We can’t take newspaper or cardboard. The low-grade waste is used to produce materials where the appearance is not such a critical factor, such as corrugated cardboard and newspaper print.&quot;<br /><br />The sorted waste is then taken to a paper mill, where the paper is pulped and the ink is removed. After the paper has been de-inked, it can be bleached and made into new paper. Some virgin fibres may be added to the pulp for the manufacture of high-quality recycled paper, but low-grade products such as corrugated cardboard and newsprint can be made from 100% recycled fibres.<br /><br />Wood fibres in paper can typically be recycled five to six times before they become too weak and degraded for further use in papermaking.<br /><br />Long is keen to dispel the myths that surround paper recycling, which some sceptics claim is more damaging than making paper from virgin pulp.<br /><br />&quot;Manufacturing recycled paper produces between 20%-45% less CO2 than from virgin fibres,&quot; he explains. &quot;It also avoids landfill, which stores up waste for future generations to deal with. The other alternative would be to incinerate waste paper, but this releases CO2 into the air immediately.&quot;<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2FsYmVydG9idXNjaDMxNi5uZXdzdmluZS5jb20vX25ld3MvMjAxMi8wNS8zMS8xMTk4ODI0OC13aGlsZS10aGUtaW5kdXN0cnktY29udGludWVzLWl0cy1sb25nLXJvYWQtdG8tcmVjb3Zlcnktb25seS10aGUtbW9zdC1vcHRpbWlzdGljLXdvdWxkLWNsYWltLXRoYXQtdWstcHJpbnQtaXMtYmFjay10by1mdWxsLWhlYWx0aA__" target="_blank">While the industry continues its long road to recovery, only the most optimistic would claim that UK print is back to full health.</a>

		<document id="43c50be475b6dc8dcac519d712ed47e0" url=""><![CDATA[Printers capsized by an endless sea of paper options.<br/><br/>&quot;In today’s market, everything is based on price and we steer our clients towards the most cost-effective method of producing something that still does the job at the best quality possible – that means set papers. We are essentially taking the hassle of choosing away from the client, and our clients do tend to want that choice taken out of their hands.&quot;<br /><br />In some ways, you can see why the approach appeals. For many, the paper supply chain is not a sleek river flowing through manageable channels of choice, but a torrent of chaos and confusion, where too many products make the market difficult to navigate, with hidden undercurrents of discontinuity and mirages of difference. However, disorientating though it may be, a wide choice of paper is, some say, essential to print’s very being, central to its success as a communications medium, and so rather than a need to restrict choice, the key going forward is more to manage that choice better.<br /><br />The problem with that is print’s diversity. Everyone wants something different from the paper merchants, and for every Anthony Thirlby, there is a Richard Owers, director at UK commercial printer Pureprint.<br /><br />&quot;For the vast majority of our work, having a choice of papers at our disposal is incredibly important,&quot; he explains. &quot;We use a wide range in both digital and litho. In creative print, the choice of substrate is a key factor.&quot;<br /><br />For Owers, the current level of choice is important for the way his business works. And while the merchants accept the choice is wide, paper manufacturer Arjowiggins corporate affairs manager Shannan Hodgson says that with the mix of technologies and processes these days, having a breadth of choice is essential.<br /><br />&quot;It’s important to offer variety in papers to allow companies the widest possible range to choose from,&quot; she explains. &quot;With so many different shades, thicknesses and types, end-users are – with the help of a printer – able to pick exactly the right paper for their specific print job.&quot;<br /><br />For the merchants, the solution to any confusion the printers or end-clients may have with the choice of paper is not restriction, but improving the information channels. Hodgson says Arjowiggins uses extensive marketing to ensure printers are properly informed, while PaperCo head of marketing Charles Eaton adds that his company has worked hard at simplifying the buying process.<br /><br />The latter is much needed, argue printers, as the current supply chain doesn’t help itself in terms of clarity with the way certain products are branded – and this is contributing to there being too many products on the market. Often, you could have three different papers, branded and priced differently, that you know have come from the same mill and were produced in exactly the same way: they are essentially the same product.<br /><br />Antalis McNaughton marketing director James Jarvis, though, counters that, while this issue was once a problem, the market has become more consolidated over the past five years and so it happens less frequently. Robert Horne customer marketing manager Paul Cassidy adds that, firstly, this quirk of supply is not as widespread as people may think, and secondly that where it does occur, some printers actually see it as a benefit. In combination, this should mean printers can still have their choice of substrates, but without the complexities and confusion.<br /><br />Source: Print Week UK<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3BhdHJpa2tlbm5lZDI0Lm5ld3N2aW5lLmNvbS9fbmV3cy8yMDEyLzA1LzMxLzExOTg4MjY2LWNvdWxkLXBvc3RhbC1kZXJlZ3VsYXRpb24tYnJpbmctYWJvdXQtYS10d28tdGllci1zZXJ2aWNl" target="_blank">Could postal deregulation bring about a two-tier service?</a>

A carbon-neutral logo from one of the array of companies offering carbon footprinting services can look very impressive on a printer’s website, but the logo does not necessarily guarantee that the company is making efforts to reduce its emissions as well as paying to offset them.<br /><br />&quot;There may be some companies offsetting rather than reducing,&quot; admits director of the Carbon Trust accreditation service Harry Morrison, conceding that this could be disheartening for printers with admirable reduction schemes who sense they may be losing out to competitors basing their carbon-policy purely on offsetting and receiving an impressive-looking logo for this. <br /><br />This scenario is, however, becoming less and less of an issue. &quot;When we launched in 2008 there were quite a lot of companies basing their entire carbon strategy around offsetting,&quot; he says. &quot;But since then the market has matured a lot and many of the offsetting firms now encourage reduction activity.&quot;<br /><br />The Carbon Trust has its own standard and Morrison says that printers looking to differentiate themselves should get involved as it is a more robust system than the buyer’s favourite ISO 14001. <br /><br />&quot;ISO 14001 is a good start, as it means that you’re taking the right actions and have the right policies in place,&quot; says Morrison. &quot;But while there is some assessment of improvement there isn’t an absolute performance threshold that you have to hit. Carbon certifications are a newer area and represent more of a stand-out performance and, over the past two years, we’ve seen big companies starting to ask their suppliers for much more information about carbon.&quot;<br /><br />Another less-used way of standing out is EMAS (Eco-Manage-ment and Audit Scheme). This accreditation requires organisations regularly to produce a public environmental statement and so is seen by its advocates as the gold standard of transparency. <br /><br />Knowledge of EMAS and the Carbon Trust Standard is not as widespread as the ISO 14001s of this world, however, so despite some arguing the former to be more rigorous, their kerb appeal for print buyers is perhaps less than the latter. That said, Richard Owers, company director at Pureprint, the company with the longest-held EMAS certification in the UK, says that official accreditations like EMAS certainly have a role to play in helping printers to secure business. <br /><br />&quot;EMAS is important to us because it is indicative of the whole culture at Pureprint,&quot; he says. &quot;When a customer comes to visit, there’s a whole ethos going on which I think is what gives us the edge if a print buyer is comparing us with another company.&quot;<br /><br />It’s this process of inviting the buyers into the company and really explaining the eco performance of the business that many see as the way forward through the blinding accreditation maelstrom. If the buyers are pre-occupied unfairly with a couple of the easy-to-understand labels, then it is the job of the printer to educate them otherwise, to explain why their in-house scheme is better than an ISO, or why the Carbon Trust Standard means they are performing better than someone with a PEFC paper logo.   <br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3BhdHJpa2tlbm5lZDI0Lm5ld3N2aW5lLmNvbS9fbmV3cy8yMDEyLzA2LzAxLzEyMDAxNzkyLWtvbmljYS1wbG90cy1hbi1pbmtqZXQtcmV2b2x1dGlvbg__" target="_blank">Konica plots an inkjet revolution</a>

Elsewhere, there are new CTP launches from the likes of Kodak, Agfa and Basyprint; plate launches from companies including Esko, Fujifilm and Presstek; and a wide range of software upgrades and new launches. Of the latter, Chilli Publish is attracting a lot of attention with its ‘InDesign in the cloud’ product, while Heidelberg’s Prinect Business Manager and the PantoneLive platform are both generating column inches.<br /><br />In presses, as we have discussed, it appears B2 digital is set to grab the headlines. However, there is much more to talk about. For example, there’s the return of Benny Landa; a real surge into packaging solutions; and the various practical (that word again) link-ups between litho and digital manufacturers. Partnerships particularly catching the eye are those of Timsons and Kodak, KBA and RR Donnelley and Konica Minolta and Komori. Over in wide-format, the continued evolution of latex solutions and a renewed focus on the pres-press and post-press elements of print are making headlines.<br /><br />Into post-press, and here it really is about the hand following the eye: post-press manufacturers striving to create machines that match what the press manufacturers are producing. This means more automation, more inline options, and an ability to cope with digital’s increasing speed.  Innovations on show include the Digimaster series from Morgana, new cutting equipment from Zünd and Kongsberg, a new feeder from Horizon and a new UV-spot laminator from Autobond.<br /><br />As Mataré says, though, alongside all these technological advances are a raft of environment and business ideas, alongside conferences and talks taking place all over the Messe halls. The Drupa Cube in particular is looking to be a must-attend.<br /><br />But what about those currently undecided about whether Drupa will be a worth an attendance altogether?<br /><br />&quot;For their business, for their technology and for their future – Drupa is a must,&quot; says Mataré. &quot;Also, this is a once-every-four-years occurrence. Miss it this time around and you have to wait four years until you get the chance again.&quot;<br /><br />The point behind those reasons is really that you now get out of the industry what you are willing to put in. Keeping abreast of what is happening, what is available and what direction the future holds when it comes to print is essential for the success of any print business, big or small. And to be able to get all that for the price of an air fare and a day ticket seems reasonable.<br /><br />Source: Print Week UK<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovLzUwMGJ1c2luZXNzY2FyZHMyNy53ZXRwYWludC5jb20vcGFnZS9FbWFpbCtNYXJrZXRpbmcrVG8rSW5jcmVhc2UrWW91citQcm9maXRzK0FuZCtLZWVwK0N1c3RvbWVycw__" target="_blank">Looking For Tips On Email Marketing?

Carbon certifications are a newer area and represent more of a stand-out performance and, over the past two years, we’ve seen big companies starting to ask their suppliers for much more information about carbon.&quot;<br /><br />Another less-used way of standing out is EMAS (Eco-Manage-ment and Audit Scheme). This accreditation requires organisations regularly to produce a public environmental statement and so is seen by its advocates as the gold standard of transparency. <br /><br />Knowledge of EMAS and the Carbon Trust Standard is not as widespread as the ISO 14001s of this world, however, so despite some arguing the former to be more rigorous, their kerb appeal for print buyers is perhaps less than the latter. That said, Richard Owers, company director at Pureprint, the company with the longest-held EMAS certification in the UK, says that official accreditations like EMAS certainly have a role to play in helping printers to secure business. <br /><br />&quot;EMAS is important to us because it is indicative of the whole culture at Pureprint,&quot; he says. &quot;When a customer comes to visit, there’s a whole ethos going on which I think is what gives us the edge if a print buyer is comparing us with another company.&quot;<br /><br />It’s this process of inviting the buyers into the company and really explaining the eco performance of the business that many see as the way forward through the blinding accreditation maelstrom. If the buyers are pre-occupied unfairly with a couple of the easy-to-understand labels, then it is the job of the printer to educate them otherwise, to explain why their in-house scheme is better than an ISO, or why the Carbon Trust Standard means they are performing better than someone with a PEFC paper logo. <br /><br />&quot;Within this industry, there are professionals who deal in the environment such as myself and it’s our job to clarify things for people so they do ensure that they’re making an informed choice,&quot; says Head. <br /><br />The trouble is that an &quot;informed choice&quot; is a malleable concept and so benchmarking accreditations in a hierarchical list is nigh on impossible – priorities will shift with the type of work and the context of that work.   <br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2FsYmVydG9idXNjaDMxNjYxOC50dW1ibHIuY29t" target="_blank">Konica plots an inkjet revolution</a>

The gold stamp was then embossed to create a &quot;seal of approval&quot; effect using a Sanwa machine. Finally, a Trumex screen printer applied the spot UV varnish.<br /><br />The original design saw solid black foil set in certain areas but Celloglas set up the SBL flatbed in its Reading plant to apply a lighter texture, creating grainy numerals with differing texture, which would become a feature of the final cover.<br /><br />Computer Arts designer Becca Allen said: &quot;We weren’t aware that we could have texture but Celloglas suggested it for the black foil pattern and we liked it.

However, the Colour Bridge supplements for coated and uncoated papers will not be available until June.<br />Source: Print Week UK<br /><br />[url=]A creative approach to inline manufacturing has given this mailing house an edge[/url]

Everyone wants something different from the paper merchants, and for every Anthony Thirlby, there is a Richard Owers, director at UK commercial printer Pureprint.<br /><br />&quot;For the vast majority of our work, having a choice of papers at our disposal is incredibly important,&quot; he explains. &quot;We use a wide range in both digital and litho. In creative print, the choice of substrate is a key factor.&quot;<br /><br />For Owers, the current level of choice is important for the way his business works. And while the merchants accept the choice is wide, paper manufacturer Arjowiggins corporate affairs manager Shannan Hodgson says that with the mix of technologies and processes these days, having a breadth of choice is essential.<br /><br />&quot;It’s important to offer variety in papers to allow companies the widest possible range to choose from,&quot; she explains. &quot;With so many different shades, thicknesses and types, end-users are – with the help of a printer – able to pick exactly the right paper for their specific print job.&quot;<br /><br />For the merchants, the solution to any confusion the printers or end-clients may have with the choice of paper is not restriction, but improving the information channels. Hodgson says Arjowiggins uses extensive marketing to ensure printers are properly informed, while PaperCo head of marketing Charles Eaton adds that his company has worked hard at simplifying the buying process.<br /><br />The latter is much needed, argue printers, as the current supply chain doesn’t help itself in terms of clarity with the way certain products are branded – and this is contributing to there being too many products on the market. Often, you could have three different papers, branded and priced differently, that you know have come from the same mill and were produced in exactly the same way: they are essentially the same product.<br /><br />Antalis McNaughton marketing director James Jarvis, though, counters that, while this issue was once a problem, the market has become more consolidated over the past five years and so it happens less frequently. Robert Horne customer marketing manager Paul Cassidy adds that, firstly, this quirk of supply is not as widespread as people may think, and secondly that where it does occur, some printers actually see it as a benefit. If, for example, a printer’s usual supplier has no stock of a particular grade, he can go to another merchant and maintain continuity of supply – albeit under a different name.<br /><br />At the end of the day, the flexibility of print to give thousands of different feels and textures and products is at the heart of what makes it great. However, the substrate confusion that seems to be currently occurring in some print areas threatens to undermine that flexibility. To overcome that, some product consolidation is needed from the merchants, but also information channels need to be clearer and the information given more process focused. In combination, this should mean printers can still have their choice of substrates, but without the complexities and confusion.<br /><br />Source: Print Week UK<br /><br />[url=]Could postal deregulation bring about a two-tier service?[/url]

The origin of the cancer scare was not from the food itself, but rather the cardboard box that it was packaged in.<br /><br />A Swiss study had found food packaged in recycled cardboard to be a potential health risk. And while the national newspapers were typically emotive and not entirely accurate in their handling of the story, the evidence from the study was a cause of major concern for anyone involved in the production and use of the material – and rightly so.<br /><br />Two months down the line, however, and very little seems to have changed as a consequence of the Swiss study, and a similar one conducted in Germany. Contrary to press reports, cereal makers have not stopped using recycled cardboard boxes and, if they are to be believed, recycled cardboard converters have not reported a drop in demand.<br /><br />So, is the recycled cardboard box really something to be scared of?<br /><br />Given the fervour with which the nationals whipped up the story when it broke, perhaps it was no small irony that the potential cancer risk stems from mineral oil in inks used in, wait for it – newspapers. Newsprint, very often itself made from paper that has been recycled several times, tends to end up as recycled cardboard as there isn’t much else that can be made with it.<br /><br />In March, Koni Grob, of the Food Safety Laboratory in Zurich, announced his toxicology team had found that the mineral oils in printing ink from recycled newspapers turned into cardboard could get into foods.<br /><br />While admitting humans would only be exposed to tiny individual doses, Dr Grob claimed that the oils had been linked to inflammation of internal organs, and in the worst cases, cancer. Worryingly, 89 of 119 items bought from German supermarkets last year, which were mainly cereal, pasta and rice products, exceeded recommended mineral oil limits, and most exceeded it by as much as 10 times.<br /><br />Just as concerning, Grob found that commonly used inner plastic bags had no protective effect. In fact, only aluminium foil was effective.<br /><br />Not long after the study was made public, however, the Food Standards Authority (FSA) was quick to downplay fears. In a statement, it said: &quot;We are not aware of any firm evidence to suggest there are food safety risks related to mineral oils in recycled food packaging. The research is interesting, but due to incomplete data the results have not demonstrated that mineral oils in food packaging represent a food safety risk.&quot;<br /><br />Yet, the FSA hasn’t dismissed the findings completely. Instead, along with the European Food Standards Authority (EFSA) it has decided to conduct its own research into mineral oil food contamination, the results of which are expected in the autumn.<br /><br />New solutions<br />In the meantime, it has effectively given the green light for food manufacturers to carry on as normal. Still, producers are understandably taking the issue seriously. Kellogg’s says it’s working with its suppliers on new packaging to allow it to meet environmental commitments but also contain significantly lower levels of mineral oil.<br /><br />Jordans, meanwhile, switched from 80% recycled cardboard to an FSC-accredited board for a number of its products before the scare arose, not as a response to it, as was reported at the time.<br /><br />Those working in print understand the nervousness food manufacturers must feel. And that is the point – there is no good reason to change at the moment.&quot;<br /><br />Source: Print Week UK<br /><br />[url=]Could postal deregulation bring about a two-tier service?[/url]

Steve Wicks, director at eco-orientated print manager Greenprint Consultancy, believes any price rise food manufacturers would incur switching from recycled to virgin-fibre carton and cartonboard would pale into insignificance against a potential lawsuit if the boxes were found to be harmful to humans.<br /><br />While stressing he is no expert on the toxicological effects of mineral oil, Wicks calls for a rational response. &quot;The danger with these things is that everybody jumps on a bandwagon that says all recycling material is bad and we should not be using it,&quot; he says. &quot;There has got to be a measured approach to the problem.&quot;<br /><br />It’s a line that, understandably, ink manufacturers are keen to adopt as well. None are keen to talk directly about the issue, but the industry has a shared voice in the British Coatings Federation (BCF).<br /><br />&quot;What we have here is a fundamental issue that concerns the whole supply chain,&quot; explains BCF chief executive Tony Mash. &quot;Will it result in newspaper inks becoming fully contact approved? Or do we have to change the way we recycle paper? Those questions I can’t answer right now, but I can say the ink industry is working very closely up and downstream to think this one through. I can also say ink manufacturers can offer, and do offer, food contact approved inks.&quot;<br /><br />The BCF is currently taking guidance from the European Printing Inks Association (EuPIA). As long ago as 2009, EuPIA stated that &quot;with very few exceptions, printing inks intended for graphic, general packaging and food packaging applications are not designed to come into direct contact with food, and therefore, the raw materials used in printing inks do not generally meet food standards.&quot;<br /><br />At the time, EuPIA said it is the responsibility of those placing recycled paper and board on the market for food packaging purposes to assess any risk, and reduce it below acceptable levels in accordance with EC regulations. Naturally, it has reiterated this point since the recent scare.<br /><br />&quot;As EuPIA shows, the ink industry has been raising this issue for a while,&quot; says Mash. &quot;I think we’re in for a broad reappraisal of our approach. And that is the point – there is no good reason to change at the moment.&quot;<br /><br />Source: Print Week UK<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL21vcmdhbmRlbGVvbjI2LnBvc3Rlcm91cy5jb20vY291bGQtcG9zdGFsLWRlcmVndWxhdGlvbi1icmluZy1hYm91dC1hLXR3by10" target="_blank">Could postal deregulation bring about a two-tier service?</a>

It is an important agenda to a lot of people and I believe it has helped us to attract customers, even when we are not necessarily the cheapest supplier.&quot;<br /><br />Money matters<br />But the benefits don’t stop at winning new business. Financial returns can also be more immediate thanks to the money you can generate from recycling. In the current economic climate, the financial benefits of recycling should not be overlooked.<br /><br />The Guardian Print Centre, which prints The Guardian and The Observer newspapers, is making around £2,000 per month profit from recycling its waste, which includes aluminium plates, waste chemicals, batteries, fluorescent tubes and IT waste.<br /><br />It works with waste management company J&amp;G Environmental, which offsets the cost of taking away chemicals against the value of the aluminium plates and sends the company a cheque every month for the balance.<br /><br />Engineering manager Danny Couchman explains: &quot;We’ve been working with J&amp;G Environmental since 2005. They take away all of our waste and if there is anything that they don’t deal with they will put us in touch with a company that does handle it.&quot;<br /><br />Arda Metal Packaging, which has three metal and three glass plants in the UK, has also discovered the financial benefit of recycling and has reduced the amount of waste it sends to landfill by 26 tonnes per month, which, as landfill tax is currently set at £56 per tonne, represents a huge saving.   <br /><br />The company, which recycles aluminium, plates, solvents, lacquers, oil drums, ink tins and gearboxes, has also cut its skip hire down from four 40-yard open skips per week to one 35-yard compacted skip per month.<br /><br />Arda Metal Packaging works manager Steve Niblett, says: &quot;The value of the aluminium plates almost writes off the cost of our waste disposal. We are now recycling or reusing around 85% of our waste – that’s 85% out of landfill.&quot;<br /><br />O’Connor says that the Tangent Group makes a profit of around £1,000 a month from its recycling, which has reached a heady 98% of waste.<br /><br />&quot;We’ve just renegotiated the rate we receive for our paper waste from £15 to £50 per tonne,&quot; he explains. &quot;We make more money out of paper as we don’t generate a huge amount of aluminium waste.&quot; <br /><br />Like Arda Metal Packaging, the Tangent Group has found that cutting down on landfill can also help to cut costs.<br /><br />&quot;We have significantly reduced the amount we were spending on skips and landfill taxes,&quot; O’Connor adds. <br /><br />So, at a time when many businesses are struggling in a difficult economic climate, how many can afford to throw away what could be valuable waste? With many printers doing their best to cut costs, boost profits and win new business, examining what’s in the skip could be just the ticket.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3BhdHJpa2tlbm5lZDI0LnBvc3Rlcm91cy5jb20vYmFubmVyLXBpY2tzLXVwLWNhcnBob25lLXdhcmVob3VzZS1jb250cmFjdC1v" target="_blank">Banner picks up Carphone Warehouse contract off HH Global</a>

Finding a way to offset them is therefore essential for most to stay in business. Fortunately, shelter from the storm comes in a number of guises. Some digital printers are opting for a switch from the OEM to cheaper third-party suppliers, while others are taking advantage of a helping hand from manufacturers in the form of fixed-price deals and innovative service package solutions. Picking the right option for your business is essential as the wrong option can be more detrimental than the ink rise itself.<br /><br />Absorbing the rises<br />In the litho world, the options available for offsetting ink costs derive chiefly from the ink manufacturers themselves. Far from upping the prices and hiding away in fear of retribution, most are working on ways to help printers find a way of avoiding passing on these increases to the customer. This help usually centres on finding savings elsewhere in the pressroom to, in effect, pay for the cost of the ink price rise.<br /><br />Manufacturers such as Sun Chemical have done this by helping to initiate the use of process improvement practice ‘Six Sigma’ in pressrooms, while Fujifilm will audit a company’s kit so that output quality is standardised and work can be printed on the most economical kit, rather than the kit with the quality the client likes best. Perhaps the most innovative example of manufacturer assistance, though, comes from ink and consumables manufacturer and supplier Stehlin Hostag.<br /><br />It has developed a system called i-Check whereby printers can implement a proven efficiency project that best fits their business and monitor the impact that project has via a website that can be accessed remotely from any computer. The website carries details of the project, its aims and its reasoning, along with ongoing data on how it is progressing.<br /><br />Managing director David Ward explains that the project began with the company looking back over its history of helping clients with efficiency drives and picking out the most successful for a portfolio of the projects, reducing blanket usage for example or moving to alcohol-free processes. Clients could then look through this portfolio and select which measures best suited them.<br /><br />&quot;We looked at the situation of rising costs and decided that there were lots of opportunities within the pressroom where we could save,&quot; he says. &quot;And the fact the i-Check is transparent proves it is not just words: we have quantifiable and measured results to prove that the savings are genuine.&quot;<br /><br />Another way<br />That’s why some in the digital market have opted to take the option of switching to cheaper inks and starting on a whole new staircase altogether – one that starts at a much lower price point so is arguably a more long-term option. Rising costs are a reality the industry is going to have to face and while these solutions can act as a buffer, printers will at some point have to pass the cost of the inks on to their own customers, as the manufacturers have had to do, in order to survive.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWdlbnRlLmNvbS95b3VyX3BhZ2UvYmxvZy92aWV3X3Bvc3RpbmcuaHRtbD9waWQ9Mjc2MDUxMSZhbXA7cHJvZmlsZV9pZD03Mjg3MTU0JmFtcDtwcm9maWxlX25hbWU9YWxiZXJ0b2J1c2NoMzE2JmFtcDt1c2VyX2lkPTcyODcxNTQmYW1wO3VzZXJuYW1lPWFsYmVydG9idXNjaDMxNg__" target="_blank">Experts writing the book on production: three publishing figures</a>

So says a recent Mail Media Centre report, which found that in 2010 an average of 91% of direct mail was opened, that 48% of customers felt information received by direct mail was easy to understand compared with 20% by email, and that the percentage of mail where customers took action increased from just 4% in 2004 to 5% in 2010.<br /><br />Outdoor advertising is delivering similarly impressive results, with a Kinetic Worldwide survey finding that 75% of store owners say posters outside their shops are the main influence on what sells, and Outdoor Media Centre reporting that, although outdoor digital accounts for 14% of their revenue, six out of seven pounds are still being spent on printed posters.<br /><br />Still need convincing? Then take a look at PrintWeek’s pick of some of the most successful printed campaigns of late...<br /><br />The campaign<br />Out-of-home (OOH) marketing has long been a key aspect of H&amp;M’s promotional strategy. Working with Clear Channel to deliver wide-format posters, H&amp;M’s outdoor presence is increasing year-on-year with OOH now by far the principal medium for any campaign, accounting for 62% of the brand’s entire media investment (up from 16% in 2006).<br /><br />The reason behind this emphasis is that H&amp;M has discovered that it is not just a certain sector of the population buying its clothes. Many women now buy H&amp;M clothes and accessorise with more expensive items, so a form of marketing that broadcasts to the public as a whole, and not just young girls, has proved a worthwhile strategy.<br /><br />Why print?<br />Print will be the medium of choice for the majority of OOH campaigns for a long time, says Darren Mckay, Clear Channel international sales director, UK, because technological developments in HD presses mean that the quality is always improving. This is particularly advantageous where fashion OOH is concerned, Mckay reveals, with high definition print complementing H&amp;M’s simple and striking images. <br /><br />&quot;I think there’s something quite sexy about the poster and I think that’s why fashion has bought into it over many years,&quot; he says. &quot;There are more large digital canvases coming out, but the quality of them isn’t as good as you get on the smaller format. There’s a also a cost issue with digital screens.&quot;<br /><br />Print is important throughout H&amp;M’s marketing strategy, he adds. The brand appears in the right magazines, attracting people in the first place, and the posters act as reminders to people as they are out and about shopping.<br /><br />The result<br />Through consistent growth in outdoor advertising, H&amp;M now runs a live campaign for 22 weeks of every year (versus six in 2006). The result of H&amp;M having visibility on almost every high street in the UK is a brand awareness of 98%, a 700% shift in 16-30s agreeing that H&amp;M would be their first choice, and a 15% increase in global sales in 2010.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWdlbnRlLmNvbS95b3VyX3BhZ2UvYmxvZy92aWV3X3Bvc3RpbmcuaHRtbD9waWQ9Mjc2MDUxMSZhbXA7cHJvZmlsZV9pZD03Mjg3MTU0JmFtcDtwcm9maWxlX25hbWU9YWxiZXJ0b2J1c2NoMzE2JmFtcDt1c2VyX2lkPTcyODcxNTQmYW1wO3VzZXJuYW1lPWFsYmVydG9idXNjaDMxNg__" target="_blank">Experts writing the book on production: three publishing figures</a>

Carbon certifications are a newer area and represent more of a stand-out performance and, over the past two years, we’ve seen big companies starting to ask their suppliers for much more information about carbon.&quot;<br /><br />Another less-used way of standing out is EMAS (Eco-Manage-ment and Audit Scheme). This accreditation requires organisations regularly to produce a public environmental statement and so is seen by its advocates as the gold standard of transparency. <br /><br />Knowledge of EMAS and the Carbon Trust Standard is not as widespread as the ISO 14001s of this world, however, so despite some arguing the former to be more rigorous, their kerb appeal for print buyers is perhaps less than the latter. That said, Richard Owers, company director at Pureprint, the company with the longest-held EMAS certification in the UK, says that official accreditations like EMAS certainly have a role to play in helping printers to secure business. <br /><br />&quot;EMAS is important to us because it is indicative of the whole culture at Pureprint,&quot; he says. &quot;When a customer comes to visit, there’s a whole ethos going on which I think is what gives us the edge if a print buyer is comparing us with another company.&quot;<br /><br />It’s this process of inviting the buyers into the company and really explaining the eco performance of the business that many see as the way forward through the blinding accreditation maelstrom. If the buyers are pre-occupied unfairly with a couple of the easy-to-understand labels, then it is the job of the printer to educate them otherwise, to explain why their in-house scheme is better than an ISO, or why the Carbon Trust Standard means they are performing better than someone with a PEFC paper logo. <br /><br />&quot;Within this industry, there are professionals who deal in the environment such as myself and it’s our job to clarify things for people so they do ensure that they’re making an informed choice,&quot; says Head. <br /><br />The trouble is that an &quot;informed choice&quot; is a malleable concept and so benchmarking accreditations in a hierarchical list is nigh on impossible – priorities will shift with the type of work and the context of that work.   <br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWdlbnRlLmNvbS95b3VyX3BhZ2UvYmxvZy92aWV3X3Bvc3RpbmcuaHRtbD9waWQ9Mjc2NTgxMiZhbXA7cHJvZmlsZV9pZD03Mjg2NzY1JmFtcDtwcm9maWxlX25hbWU9bW9yZ2FuZGVsZW9uMjYmYW1wO3VzZXJfaWQ9NzI4Njc2NSZhbXA7dXNlcm5hbWU9bW9yZ2FuZGVsZW9uMjY_" target="_blank">Konica plots an inkjet revolution</a>

The gold stamp was then embossed to create a &quot;seal of approval&quot; effect using a Sanwa machine. Finally, a Trumex screen printer applied the spot UV varnish.<br /><br />The original design saw solid black foil set in certain areas but Celloglas set up the SBL flatbed in its Reading plant to apply a lighter texture, creating grainy numerals with differing texture, which would become a feature of the final cover.<br /><br />Computer Arts designer Becca Allen said: &quot;We weren’t aware that we could have texture but Celloglas suggested it for the black foil pattern and we liked it. It was more raised against the white background, which had been a risk.&quot;<br /><br />Celloglas has been able to give more input to the design of the products through working directly with the art team, offering finishes the client had not considered.<br /><br />Computer Arts editor Rob Carney said: &quot;The Celloglas team was very helpful in helping us determine what we could do. The gold 'seal' idea came out of our original meeting with Celloglas. I'm particularly pleased with the black textured foil.<br /><br />&quot;I'm really pleased with the final cover – particularly the gold foil and embossing and we've had some great feedback from readers.&quot;<br /><br />Celloglas sales director Steve Middleton added: &quot;It was fantastic to work so closely with Computer Arts magazine on this cover, their creative ideas for finishes were really flowing<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWdlbnRlLmNvbS95b3VyX3BhZ2UvYmxvZy92aWV3X3Bvc3RpbmcuaHRtbD9waWQ9Mjc2NTgxMiZhbXA7cHJvZmlsZV9pZD03Mjg2NzY1JmFtcDtwcm9maWxlX25hbWU9bW9yZ2FuZGVsZW9uMjYmYW1wO3VzZXJfaWQ9NzI4Njc2NSZhbXA7dXNlcm5hbWU9bW9yZ2FuZGVsZW9uMjY_" target="_blank">Konica plots an inkjet revolution</a>

However, despite the best efforts of Fujifilm, Screen, HP, Xeikon, MGI and Landa, plus those of a Ryobi/Miyakoshi partnership, show director Manuel Mataré says the epithet is a little premature for the self-styled 'Olympics of print'.<br /><br />&quot;It’s too early to predict what title will be bestowed on Drupa 2012,&quot; he asserts. &quot;What I do think, though, is that rather than one single technology or one single element, the thing to come out of Drupa 2012 will be the message of different technologies working together for the best possible print outcome.&quot;<br /><br />He adds that speaking in terms of technology is also a little outdated, as print shows and the print offerings of manufacturers are now as much about business as about technology. Manufacturers are going into Drupa heavily promoting their respective business programmes, while also talking much more about practical commercial applications of kit, rather than just the kit itself.<br /><br />So if not the ‘B2 Drupa’, perhaps this will be the ‘practical Drupa’ –in the sense of technologies working together for the greater good, and in the way that the practical application of kit is more important than ever.<br /><br />Exhibitors certainly seem to have been practical with R&amp;D budgets; reduced spends have not led to the anticipated absence of inventiveness.<br /><br />In pre-press, visitors can expect to be taken into a whole new dimension as a focus on ‘the cloud’ appears to be defining the sector – though as our preview pointed out last month, picking and choosing when to use that technology is crucial if you’re to make the most of it. Elsewhere, there are new CTP launches from the likes of Kodak, Agfa and Basyprint; plate launches from companies including Esko, Fujifilm and Presstek; and a wide range of software upgrades and new launches. Of the latter, Chilli Publish is attracting a lot of attention with its ‘InDesign in the cloud’ product, while Heidelberg’s Prinect Business Manager and the PantoneLive platform are both generating column inches.<br /><br />In presses, as we have discussed, it appears B2 digital is set to grab the headlines. However, there is much more to talk about. For example, there’s the return of Benny Landa; a real surge into packaging solutions; and the various practical (that word again) link-ups between litho and digital manufacturers. Partnerships particularly catching the eye are those of Timsons and Kodak, KBA and RR Donnelley and Konica Minolta and Komori. Over in wide-format, the continued evolution of latex solutions and a renewed focus on the pres-press and post-press elements of print are making headlines.<br /><br />Into post-press, and here it really is about the hand following the eye: post-press manufacturers striving to create machines that match what the press manufacturers are producing. This means more automation, more inline options, and an ability to cope with digital’s increasing speed.  Innovations on show include the Digimaster series from Morgana, new cutting equipment from Zünd and Kongsberg, a new feeder from Horizon and a new UV-spot laminator from Autobond.<br /><br />As Mataré says, though, alongside all these technological advances are a raft of environment and business ideas, alongside conferences and talks taking place all over the Messe halls. And to be able to get all that for the price of an air fare and a day ticket seems reasonable.<br /><br />Source: Print Week UK<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWdlbnRlLmNvbS95b3VyX3BhZ2UvYmxvZy92aWV3X3Bvc3RpbmcuaHRtbD9waWQ9Mjc2NjAyMiZhbXA7cHJvZmlsZV9pZD03Mjg3MTI3JmFtcDtwcm9maWxlX25hbWU9cGF0cmlra2VubmVkMjQmYW1wO3VzZXJfaWQ9NzI4NzEyNyZhbXA7dXNlcm5hbWU9cGF0cmlra2VubmVkMjQ_" target="_blank">Everything You Need To Know About Email Marketing</a>
