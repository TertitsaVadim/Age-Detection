<br /><br />In a video which they apparently planned to&lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.monclersalestore.com%2F8-moncler-hoodies-women%26quot%3B%26gt%3BMoncler"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.monclersalestore.com/8-moncler-hoodies-women&quot;&gt;Moncler</a> Hoodies Women&lt;/a&gt; send to German media outlets, the alleged terrorists claim to have killed eight ethnic Turks, one ethnic Greek and a police officer from 2000 to 2007, prosecutors said.
<br /><br />The attacks occurred all over Germany and became known as the &quot;Doener Murder Series&lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.monclersalestore.com%2F12-moncler-coats-women%26quot%3B%26gt%3BMoncler"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.monclersalestore.com/12-moncler-coats-women&quot;&gt;Moncler</a> Coats Women&lt;/a&gt;.&quot; Until the arrests, police had not thought they were committed by the same people.
<br /><br />The German magazine Der Spiegel reported that the right-wing extremists also claim in the video to be responsible for several bank robberies and a nail-bomb attack in Cologne in 2004, which hit a street with mostly Turkish and Kurdish residents.
<br /><br />German Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich said Monday: &quot;It looks like we are facing a new form of right-wing extremist terrorism.&quot;
<br /><br />Authorities in the country have not previously believed there were active, organized right-wing terror cells operating in Germany, experts say.
<br /><br />Germany's Federal Public Prosecutor's Office took charge of the investigation on Friday.
<br /><br />Two of the alleged terrorists, identified as Uwe B. and Uwe M., were found dead in a burning motor home on November 4, the prosecutor general's office said.

<br /><br />He and the New England Patriots weren't used to struggling or hearing people wondering if they're no longer the powerhouse they've been for years. Well, just like that&lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.monclersalestore.com%26quot%3B%26gt%3BMoncler"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.monclersalestore.com&quot;&gt;Moncler</a> Outlet&lt;/a&gt;, they're back in a familiar spot: all alone at the top of the AFC East.
<br /><br />Brady threw three touchdown passes&lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.monclersalestore.com%2F12-moncler-coats-women%26quot%3B%26gt%3BMoncler"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.monclersalestore.com/12-moncler-coats-women&quot;&gt;Moncler</a> Coats Women&lt;/a&gt;, including two to Rob Gronkowski, and the Patriots assumed sole possession of first place in the division with a convincing 37-16 victory over the New York Jets on Sunday night.
<br /><br />&quot;It's very sweet,&quot; Brady said, &quot;getting this win.&quot;
<br /><br />The game was a showdown for the top spot in the division, but it turned out to be no contest as the Patriots (6-3) controlled the game most of the way and ended a rare two-game skid. It also prevented New England from its first three-game losing streak since 2002.
<br /><br />&quot;Losing two straight, you have 14 days of just feeling (bad),&quot; Brady said. &quot;Every day of practice is harder. It's hard to build on losses. It feels really good to win this one.&quot;
<br /><br />It was also a crushing loss for the Jets (5-4)&lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.monclersalestore.com%2F7-moncler-vest-men%26quot%3B%26gt%3BMoncler"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.monclersalestore.com/7-moncler-vest-men&quot;&gt;Moncler</a> Vest Men&lt;/a&gt;, who had their three-game winning streak stopped, were swept in the regular-season series and are again looking up at their bitter rivals in the division.
<br /><br />&quot;It looks doubtful right now,&quot; an irritated Jets coach Rex Ryan said of his team's chances of winning the AFC East. &quot;What am I going to say? Maybe I should guarantee the fact that we're out of it. The last time I did that, we made the playoffs.

<br /><br />The mayor and police chief toured and surveyed the area for about 10 minutes, and then left for a media briefing.
<br /><br />The area is sealed off. Police are planning to inventory everything, to make sure belongings are returned.
<br /><br />A few dozen protesters are left at the barricaded intersection of 14th and Broadway, and streets are still blocked off in the immediate area.

<br /><br />we'll come back,&quot; said Little, who has been with the Oakland movement since it began a month ago.
<br /><br />Little said some of the people evicted from Frank Ogawa Plaza may show up at Snow Park, but he also expected them to regroup and recamp at the downtown location.
<br /><br />Carly Jean, another Snow Park camper, said the raids were &quot;inflicting fear&quot; on people in the movement.

<br /><br />By the time the Niners’ work week was complete Sunday afternoon, every player in the home locker room at Candlestick Park had earned the right to flex.
<br /><br />In the biggest test of legitimacy thus far for the NFL’s most surprising team of 2011, San Francisco over the , moving to within half a game of the undefeated, defending Super Bowl champion in the race for home-field advantage in the NFC.
<br /><br />If you’d read that previous sentence in early September as a sneak preview of the future, you’d have assumed it was lifted from The Onion. But here we are in the middle of November and the 49ers (8-1)&lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.monclersalestore.com%2F15-moncler-boots%26quot%3B%26gt%3BMoncler"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.monclersalestore.com/15-moncler-boots&quot;&gt;Moncler</a> Boots&lt;/a&gt;, led by a rookie coach undaunted by the challenge of a lockout and a quarterback who spent the previous six years as a punching bag for Niners fans and opponents alike, have a seven-game winning streak and a five-game lead in the NFC West with seven to play.
<br /><br />Related:
<br /><br />They also have swagger&lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.monclersalestore.com%2F6-moncler-vest-women%26quot%3B%26gt%3BMoncler"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.monclersalestore.com/6-moncler-vest-women&quot;&gt;Moncler</a> Vest Women&lt;/a&gt;, even though coach Jim Harbaugh and his players do their best to project a humble facade. Chafed by the popular perception that quarterback  is merely a game-manager administering a run-oriented, conservative offense, Harbaugh and his offensive assistants defiantly crafted an aggressive game plan for the Giants (6-3), nonplussed by the specter of facing the league’s most potent pass rush.
<br /><br />“All week long, they talked about attacking,” Smith said of Harbaugh and his coaches. “They hear what’s being said. They know. This was a big game, and they were out to prove a point. It was like, manage this.”
<br /><br />While Smith’s numbers weren’t overwhelming – he completed 19 of 30 passes for 242 yards, with one touchdown and an interception – this was no Just Don’t Screw It Up effort. There were strong, downfield throws and seven-step drops sprinkled in among the usual assortment of high-percentage passes and quick, rollout throws.
<br /><br />Oh, and the focal point of the Niners’ offensive attack, halfback , had his streak of five consecutive 100-yard rushing games ended. In fact, Gore fell a mere 100 yards shy of that total, gaining nada in six attempts and sustaining a seemingly minor left knee injury that limited

Instead of waiting for an early January deadline to make or break the season, the league managed to advance the timetable by two months and set up a mid-November showdown.
<br /><br />With one final take-it-or-leave-it proposal&lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.monclersalestore.com%26quot%3B%26gt%3BMoncler"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.monclersalestore.com&quot;&gt;Moncler</a> Sale Store&lt;/a&gt;, the league gave the players an ultimatum -- accept their offer and get ready for a 72-game season that starts on Dec. 15, or live with the consequences. If the players reject the NBA's deal, then the league's offer resets to where it was back in June. At that point, a legal battle will be a virtual certainty.
<br /><br />&quot;It's all in the hands of the players,&quot; said commissioner David Stern.
<br /><br />&quot;If this offer is not accepted&lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.monclersalestore.com%2F15-moncler-boots%26quot%3B%26gt%3BMoncler"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.monclersalestore.com/15-moncler-boots&quot;&gt;Moncler</a> Boots&lt;/a&gt;, then we'll revert to our 47 percent proposal,'' added Stern, referring to the league's offer that featured a &quot;flex cap,&quot; or two-tiered cap system. In this system, the lower cap would function like the league's previous soft cap. The upper cap would be a hard cap. The proposal also features steep rollbacks on existing salaries.
<br /><br />The players summarily rejected this idea when it was originally proposed. &quot;We view that as just a total distortion of reality,&quot; union president Derek Fisher said at the time. &quot;It's not a flexible cap, it's a hard cap.&quot;
<br /><br />This dispute has always been about a hard cap -- or at least a harder cap.
<br /><br />Ever since the players made the idea of a hard cap a &quot;blood issue,&quot; the league has tried to find clever ways to sneak one in. When the players rejected the flex cap, &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.monclersalestore.com%2F13-moncler-coats-men%26quot%3B%26gt%3BMoncler"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.monclersalestore.com/13-moncler-coats-men&quot;&gt;Moncler</a> Coats Men&lt;/a&gt;the league pitched a soft cap with an overly punitive luxury tax. The players rejected this idea as well, recognizing that a luxury tax that no team is willing to pay is really a hard cap in disguise.
<br /><br />So the league shifted its attention back to the system issues -- the exceptions and other cap mechanisms that allow teams to function while over the salary cap. If the players will not allow a directly punitive luxury tax, then the league wants one that is indirectly punitive -- one that takes privileges away from taxpaying teams. Teams that are above the tax threshold wouldn't have access to the midlevel exception, sign-and-trade transactions, and other mechanisms that were the life blood of free agency in the previous system.

<br /><br />A tired-looking Oakland Mayor Jean Quan said Monday that she was &quot;relieved&quot; that the police raid on the camp was peaceful. She implored protesters not to be destructive.
<br /><br />At a press conference&lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.monclersalestore.com%2F6-moncler-vest-women%26quot%3B%26gt%3BMoncler"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.monclersalestore.com/6-moncler-vest-women&quot;&gt;Moncler</a> Vest Women&lt;/a&gt;, Quan said the camp had put the city's resources to the test and placed a &quot;tremendous strain&quot; on all departments. She said there were 179 calls to 911 that didn't get answered because police were responding to demonstrators last week.
<br /><br />Interim Chief Howard Jordan said there were no injuries reported by police or protesters.
<br /><br />City spokeswoman Karen Boyd said the city is asking employees and businesses to delay work until 10 a.m. today.

<br /><br />Evie McKnight is one of at least seven people who set up camp last week in front of the Veterans Memorial Building, at the intersection of Harrison Street and Grand Avenue.
<br /><br />When told that the Ogawa Plaza encampment had been closed by police, McKnight said that was a

<br /><br />President Obama says his talks with the Chinese and Russian presidents in Hawaii produced agreement on one major objective.
<br /><br />&quot;All three of us entirely agree on the objective, which is making sure that Iran does not weaponize nuclear power and that we don't trigger a nuclear arms race in region&lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.monclersalestore.com%2F13-moncler-coats-men%26quot%3B%26gt%3BMoncler"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.monclersalestore.com/13-moncler-coats-men&quot;&gt;Moncler</a> Coats Men&lt;/a&gt;,&quot; he said.

<br /><br />Obama repeated that the U.S. takes no options off the table regarding Iran and believes Iran's government knows how determined the world is to prevent a nuclear-armed Iran and an arms race in the region.

<br /><br />&quot;I think he's going to be a great leader,&quot; a teammate of Matheny's with the Cardinals&lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.monclersalestore.com%2F13-moncler-coats-men%26quot%3B%26gt%3BMoncler"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.monclersalestore.com/13-moncler-coats-men&quot;&gt;Moncler</a> Coats Men&lt;/a&gt;, said Sunday night in a telephone interview with The Associated Press. &quot;If he goes out there and does what he's capable of doing and they put the players around him, he could be the manager for the next 20 years.&quot;
<br /><br />The 41-year-old Matheny played for the Cardinals from 2000-04, won three of his four Gold Gloves and was part of three postseason efforts including a World Series. He became a team leader playing for La Russa&lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.monclersalestore.com%2F9-moncler-mens-hoody%26quot%3B%26gt%3BMoncler"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.monclersalestore.com/9-moncler-mens-hoody&quot;&gt;Moncler</a> Mens Hoody&lt;/a&gt;, who retired just days after leading the team to his second World Series title in 16 seasons.
<br /><br />Matheny's playing career blossomed after he signed a one-year free-agent deal to be the backup catcher in St. Louis. Though a career .239 hitter, Matheny did enough defensively to earn a starting job.
<br /><br />Matheny was one of six men the Cardinals interviewed to replace La Russa.
<br /><br />They also talked to Hall of Famer Ryne Sandberg, longtime Cardinals third-base coach Jose Oquendo, former Boston manager Terry Francona, Triple-A manager Chris Maloney, and coach.
<br /><br />General manager John Mozeliak declined to comment on the hire aside from a one-word text to The Associated Press: &quot;Tomorrow.&quot; La Russa did not respond to telephone and text messages.

<br /><br />He tabled a Commons motion urging action on fuel prices in response to an e-petition signed by 110,000 people.
<br /><br />It was approved by MPs without a vote but it is not binding on ministers.
<br /><br />Treasury minister Chloe Smith said the government was listening to people's concerns but &quot;now was not the time&quot; to change duty rates as such decisions must wait for the Budget. 
<br /><br />The government plans to increase fuel duty by 3p a litre in January - meaning an extra ?1.50 to fill an average car - and Chancellor George Osborne is under pressure to scrap that as part of his autum statement on the economy later this month.
<br /><br />Petrol prices have tripled in the past two decades&lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.monclersalestore.com%2F15-moncler-boots%26quot%3B%26gt%3BMoncler"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.monclersalestore.com/15-moncler-boots&quot;&gt;Moncler</a> Boots&lt;/a&gt;, but ministers say prices would be even higher had they not scrapped automatic fuel-tax increases imposed by Labour.
<br /><br />Mr Osborne scrapped the annual fuel tax escalator - a mechanism under which duty rose by 1p above inflation every year - and cut fuel duty by 1p in March's Budget.
<br /><br />However, he has only postponed the planned inflation-linked part of the duty rise from April 2011 to January 2012, and from April 2012 to August 2012.

<br /><br />He said the government had to be &quot;realistic and truthful about who pays the lion's share of fuel duty&quot;.

<br /><br />“With my visit to the region I am making it clear that the United States is stepping up its commitment to the entire Asia-Pacific region,” Mr. Obama said at a joint news conference with Ms. Gillard soon after his arrival here in Australia’s capital.
<br /><br />Mr. Obama said the basing agreement “allows us to meet the demands of a lot of partners in the region that want to feel that they’re getting the training, they’re getting the exercises&lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.monclersalestore.com%2F7-moncler-vest-men%26quot%3B%26gt%3BMoncler"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.monclersalestore.com/7-moncler-vest-men&quot;&gt;Moncler</a> Vest Men&lt;/a&gt;, and that we have the presence that’s necessary to maintain the security architecture in the region.”

And we’re going to make sure that we are able to fulfill our leadership role in the Asia Pacific region.” 
<br /><br />On his two-day visit&lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.monclersalestore.com%2F12-moncler-coats-women%26quot%3B%26gt%3BMoncler"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.monclersalestore.com/12-moncler-coats-women&quot;&gt;Moncler</a> Coats Women&lt;/a&gt;, the president will fly north across the continent to Darwin, a frontier town and military outpost across the waters from Indonesia that will be the center of operations for the coming deployment. The first 200 to 250 Marines will arrive next year, with forces rotating in and out and eventually building to 2,500-strong, the two leaders said.
<br /><br />The United States will not build new bases on the continent but instead will use Australian facilities. Mr. Obama said Marines will rotate through for joint training and exercises with Australians and the American Air Force will have increased access to airfields in the nation’s Northern Territory.

<br /><br />&quot;We call upon the 99% to participate in a national day of direct action and celebration,&quot; said , which bills itself as the online resource for the movement that began in New York City's financial center and has spread throughout the United States and the world. 
<br /><br />Events will culminate in a &quot;musical&quot; in downtown New York City — complete with marching band and a gospel choir — to &quot;mark the two-month anniversary of the #occupy movement&lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.monclersalestore.com%2F9-moncler-mens-hoody%26quot%3B%26gt%3BMoncler"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.monclersalestore.com/9-moncler-mens-hoody&quot;&gt;Moncler</a> Mens Hoody&lt;/a&gt;, and our commitment to shining light into our broken economic and political system,&quot; the organization said on its website.
<br /><br />Meanwhile in Dallas, police arrested up to 20 Occupy protesters as they cleared an encampment in a city park early early Thursday morning,quoting organizers.
<br /><br />&quot;Hundreds of police, many mounted on horseback, many more in riot gear surround Occupy Dallas,&quot; Occupy Dallas.
<br /><br />&quot;Occupy Dallas exists as more than a physical location,&quot; NBC DFW later quoted the group as saying in a press release. &quot;We are not just a camp, but a movement. This is our (r)evolution. This is not an end, but a beginning.&quot;

At the time, protesters said they would keep their campsite clean so they don't get kicked out.

<br /><br />Assad is facing severe isolation stemming from his crackdown on an 8-month-old uprising, which appears to be spiraling out his control. Attacks by army defectors are growing, and world leaders are looking at possibilities for a Syrian regime without Assad.
<br /><br />The latest blow came from the&lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.monclersalestore.com%2F6-moncler-vest-women%26quot%3B%26gt%3BMoncler"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.monclersalestore.com/6-moncler-vest-women&quot;&gt;Moncler</a> Vest Women&lt;/a&gt;, which on Wednesday suspended Damascus and threatened economic sanctions if the regime continues to violate an Arab-brokered peace plan.
<br /><br />Germany, Britain and France are pressing for a U.N. resolution that would strongly condemn Syria's human rights violations. The three European countries decided to move ahead with the General Assembly resolution after the Arab League confirmed its suspension.
<br /><br />&quot;We hope it will show Assad just how isolated he is,&quot; Germany's U.N. Ambassador Peter Wittig said of the resolution.

In October, they vetoed a resolution that threatened sanctions against Syria if it didn't end its crackdown.
<br /><br />But on Thursday, spokesman Liu Weimin appeared to suggest China might support a resolution in the future.

(AP) —&lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.monclersalestore.com%26quot%3B%26gt%3BMoncler%26lt%3B%2Fa%26gt"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.monclersalestore.com&quot;&gt;Moncler&lt;/a&gt</a>; Oklahoma State University women's basketball coach Kurt Budke and assistant coach Miranda Serna were killed when the single-engine plane they were riding in during a recruiting trip crashed near a wildlife management area in central Arkansas.
<br /><br />The university said the pair died in the crash Thursday night near Perryville, about 45 miles west of Little Rock. The Winona Wildlife Management Area is in steep terrain in the eastern Ouachita Mountains&lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.monclersalestore.com%2F12-moncler-coats-women%26quot%3B%26gt%3BMoncler"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.monclersalestore.com/12-moncler-coats-women&quot;&gt;Moncler</a> Coats Women&lt;/a&gt;. A cause of the crash was not announced.
<br /><br />In January 2001, 10 men affiliated with the university's men's basketball team died in a Colorado plane crash.
<br /><br />OSU said the plane's pilot and another passenger also died in Thursday's crash. Their names were not released and OSU said they were not associated with the university.
<br /><br />&quot;There were no survivors,&quot; the university statement said.
<br /><br />The Perry County Sheriff's Department said the crash occurred just before 7 p.m. about 4 miles south of Perryville. FAA spokesman Lynn Lunsford said an immediate search revealed that at least two were dead. The school's statement Friday put the death toll at four.
<br /><br />Lunsford said the plane was a single-engine Piper PA-28.
<br /><br />The National Transportation Safety Board said it was sending investigators&lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.monclersalestore.com%2F8-moncler-hoodies-women%26quot%3B%26gt%3BMoncler"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.monclersalestore.com/8-moncler-hoodies-women&quot;&gt;Moncler</a> Hoodies Women&lt;/a&gt;, and that it could take nine months to determine the cause of the crash.
<br /><br />OSU hired Budke from Louisiana Tech seven years ago and the coach compiled a 112-83 record at the school. This year's team was 1-0 after defeating Rice on Sunday.
<br /><br />Oklahoma State canceled its women's college basketball home games set for Saturday and Sunday. The school's second-ranked college football team plays Friday night at Iowa State.
<br /><br />University president Burns Hargis credited Budke with elevating the team in a tough program. Serna, he said, set a good example for the players.
<br /><br />&quot;Our hearts and prayers go out to the families of Kurt Budke, Miranda Serna and the other victims &quot;Kurt was an exemplary leader and a man of character who had a profound impact on his student-athletes,&quot; Hargis said. &quot;Miranda was an up-and-coming coach and an outstanding role model for our young ladies.&quot;
