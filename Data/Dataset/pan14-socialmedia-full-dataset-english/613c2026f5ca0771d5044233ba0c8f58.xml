<br />Oh wonderful fallen star
<br />How much you lost
<br />At the cost of your pride
<br /><br />You felt you could run this place
<br />And all that was in it
<br />A job much too powerful
<br />For the likes of you
<br /><br />You let your pride 
<br />Get to your head
<br />Knowing you would be the best
<br />Knowing you would rule all
<br /><br />But that plan was shot down
<br />Faster than you could think it
<br />Who would have thought
<br />That you would betray them
<br /><br />Oh how the mighty have fallen
<br />Straight down from Heaven
<br />Oh morning star, son of the dawn
<br />You have been cast down to Earth
<br />You who have weakened the nations
<br /><br />Forever in your pain
<br />You try to bring us down with you
<br />Sometimes you succeed
<br />But with others you shall not
<br /><br />For they are protected 
<br />By the one you decided to betray
<br />Forever shall he turn away from you
<br />And forever ignore you
<br /><br />Those who see you stare at you
<br />They ponder your fate
<br />&quot;Is this the man who shook the earth 
<br />And made kingdoms tremble?&quot;
<br /><br />Surely you have become a name
<br />Never to be forgotten
<br />But soon your legacy and all of it's remains
<br />Shall forever be destroyed
<br /><br />So remember these words
<br />These words that are uttered
<br />For the day shall come 
<br />That you shall be no more
<br /><br />So count your days
<br />And count them well
<br />The days of the Morning Star
<br />Are beginning to shrink
<br /><br />Prepare to be destroyed
<br />By the Lord Almighty
<br />And forever be subject
<br />To the Hell you created

<br />When the world wages war
<br />You'll know it was me
<br /><br />I'll stand and I'll laugh
<br />While you fight for your life
<br />Grabbing your throat
<br />As if cut by a knife
<br /><br />I'll stand and I'll wait
<br />Waiting simply for the end
<br />and when you beg for help
<br />only death shall i lend
<br /><br />You'll beg for mercy
<br />Cry out for grace
<br />But i'll be there waiting
<br />to laugh in your face
<br /><br />Nothing can save you
<br />Not even a cry
<br />For no one can hear you
<br />shall you deny?
<br /><br />look into my eyes
<br />and what do you see?
<br />Death, Destruction, Hate, and Greed
<br />Standing right before thee
<br /><br />You'll regret what you've done
<br />When i come to town
<br />For the cities you once saw
<br />Shall instantly be taken down
<br /><br />Remember the name
<br />and remember it well
<br />The bringer of death
<br />and the ruler of hell
<br /><br />I am one with the hate
<br />The death that you see
<br />When the end comes upon you
<br />You'll know it was me

<br />I undoubtedly devote to you
<br />The one who was there for me
<br />The one who knew
<br /><br />How to make me happy
<br />How ever to make me smile
<br />Giving me that hope
<br />to say its all worthwhile
<br /><br />The art of the mind
<br />flows out onto the soul
<br />the hand takes over
<br />and you lose all control
<br /><br />Passion fills your being
<br />and you never could regret
<br />the art that you create
<br />and the pictures that you get
<br /><br />You devote all of your work
<br />to the one that gave you hope
<br />the one that offered you help
<br />if only by a simple rope
<br /><br />She gave you the inspiration
<br />to make anything come about 
<br />she made your ideas flourish
<br />when they seemed to be in drought
<br /><br />So to the girl i speak about
<br />The one who made me smile
<br />I give to her and all of you
<br />my art, my work, my style
<br /><br />I give to the world
<br />All that I hold dear
<br />If you'll just give me a moment
<br />I'll fire up my gear

<br />What it means to be in love
<br />Through the power of the skies
<br />And all that is above
<br /><br />Take but a moment
<br />To stare into her eyes
<br />That's when you'll see
<br />She's an angel in disguise
<br /><br />Our past is but a relic
<br />An artifact of the mind
<br />Our hearts have come together
<br />As one we have combined
<br /><br />Look past the darkness
<br />And Into the light
<br />For hope will shine
<br />In darkness fright
<br /><br />The tides have turned
<br />Love again has prevailed
<br />What once denied us
<br />Has thus failed
<br /><br />Im here for you
<br />In all of our days
<br />Forever staring in your eyes
<br />With that ever trancing gaze
<br /><br />You're the one for me
<br />I know this to be true
<br />Forever shall I give my hand
<br />And everything to you
<br /><br />You have my heart
<br />So treat it well
<br />Those who deny us
<br />Can simply go to hell
<br /><br />I love you

<br />Looking out amongst the sky
<br />The wind against my face
<br />The sun glaring in my eye
<br /><br />Feeling at peace
<br />For once in my life
<br />Memories of the past cut deep
<br />A bit like a knife
<br /><br />From above the city I stand
<br />Thinking hard about the past
<br />Wishing I'd never done wrong
<br />Maybe then i'd make it last
<br /><br />He gave me this life
<br />Asking only for the best
<br />But instead I rebelled
<br />Acting just like the rest
<br /><br />If only i could take it back
<br />Never again would i go wrong
<br />Maybe then I could prove
<br />And join in the song
<br /><br />Their lives down here are short
<br />Only able to see so much
<br />But who better am i to say this
<br />For i stand on a crutch
<br /><br />Relying on the pain of others
<br />To simply make up for my own
<br />But that gets you nowhere
<br />As I've vaguely shown
<br /><br />So here i stand amongst this cliff
<br />With nothing but my tears
<br />No longer will I be afraid
<br />Nor hindered by my fears
<br /><br />Taking one step off I begin to see
<br />My life, My worth...it all begins to show
<br />It's then that i realize
<br />I was nothing but a foe
<br /><br />I then begin to fall
<br />Staring down at the ground
<br />No longer will i be that enemy
<br />No longer shall i be bound
<br /><br />I stare at the ground
<br />Seeing it come closer to me
<br />A smile forms on my face
<br />As I realize i'll be free
<br /><br />Just before I hit the ground
<br />I look up to the sky
<br />Almost feeling holy now
<br />once again feeling as though I can fly
<br /><br />Just before i hit the ground
<br />With my only last breath
<br />I utter the words i've wanted to say
<br />&quot;Free from this life, Away from Death&quot;
<br /><br />I lay against the ground
<br />With nothing but a smile
<br />Finally ive done it
<br />It was definitely worth while
<br /><br />The sky turns black
<br />As well as everything within
<br />No longer will i be a foe
<br />And no longer shall i sin
<br /><br />If you haven't already guessed, this is indeed a first person account of a fallen angel, one that realizes what he's done, and in that, doing the only thing he knows best to stop himself. Once he does it, he truly feels free.

<br />How wide it is this morning
<br />Why then, is it so difficult
<br />So overwhelmingly obtrusive?
<br /><br />It's standing there
<br />Staring at me
<br />Waiting for me
<br />Here I stand
<br /><br />The rain is starting now
<br />Life seems calming
<br />I begin to push the door open, but stop
<br />Looking back, was I right?
<br /><br />The door opens
<br />A blinding light
<br />The past is gone
<br />And the future becomes me.

<br />Yet it seems so light
<br />These feelings enrapture me
<br />No matter how hard I fight
<br /><br />This isnt your average story,
<br />Not for the faint of heart
<br />For there are no angels,
<br />Only death from the start
<br /><br />The world you know
<br />This life so pure
<br />It can end in an instant
<br />So much for secure.
<br /><br />So thus the heart is blackened
<br />With every word that is written
<br />Like venom to the soul
<br />As if I'd been bitten

<br />I begin to look around
<br />Time passes by
<br />And I begin to hear a sound
<br /><br />Footsteps Footsteps
<br />Where could they be
<br />As fear begins to set in
<br />It is him that I can see
<br /><br />&quot;It's time to go&quot; He said
<br />Which puzzled me to hear
<br />But in his eyes and in his voice
<br />He must have been sincere
<br /><br />He reached out his hand
<br />Which had a shining light
<br />I tried staring into his eyes
<br />But my how they were bright
<br /><br />I grabbed his hand 
<br />And there we went
<br />I knew what this was
<br />I knew what it meant
<br /><br />Your time was short
<br />But your life was great
<br />A new world awaits you
<br />In this land of fate

How can one truly say that he is ready for what is to come of the next day, when he really has no idea what will happen?
<br /><br />In a world filled with stress and pressure, one can only cry to God to give them relaxation. The stress that tears at us, is said to also make us stronger... but what is our breaking point?  When do we buckle under the pressure?
<br /><br />When do the prayers that we send among the skies become heard and answered?  When do we finally recieve the peace we have been looking for?  When do we finally recieve the togetherness that we desire?  When do WE get what we want!

<br />there was no turning back
<br />for the future had come
<br />when the skies had turned black
<br /><br />Fights broke out
<br />from across the street
<br />as i said to my love
<br />&quot;be quick on your feet&quot;
<br /><br />We fled the scene
<br />where all had gone dark
<br />we hid for awhile
<br />in a nearby park
<br /><br />There i found a gun
<br />lying on the ground
<br />i looked out to the streets
<br />and this is what i found
<br /><br />I knew the time had come
<br />to stand up and be brave
<br />for the moment had finally arrived
<br />and revenge i did crave
<br /><br />Looking out at the streets
<br />i said to my love
<br />&quot;if I dont make it out alive,
<br />I'll see you up above&quot;
<br /><br />She cried out to me
<br />please dont leave,
<br />please dont go.
<br />if you were to die
<br />how would i ever know?
<br /><br />I looked her in the eyes
<br />and this is what i said
<br />&quot;meet me up at the top of that rock
<br />just up ahead.&quot;
<br /><br />We kissed one last time
<br />and even though it was fast
<br />i knew it just might be
<br />my very last
<br /><br />I looked her in the eyes
<br />and told her i loved her
<br />god how i'd miss
<br />that wonderful kisser
<br /><br />Staring out at the battlefield
<br />my life flashed before my eyes
<br />i thought to myself
<br />how could we believe such lies?
<br /><br />i ran out to the street
<br />holding tight onto my gun
<br />thinking to myself
<br />this battle must be won
<br /><br />Thats when i see it
<br />the worst one could ever see
<br />death, destruction, hate, and rage
<br />all standing right in front of me
<br /><br />Just then i see a little girl
<br />so helpless and so lost
<br />thinking to myself to save her
<br />but really at what cost
<br /><br />I run over and grab her
<br />and thats when it happened
<br />my vision fades out
<br />and all sound is blackened
<br /><br />A strike in the back
<br />i have no feeling
<br />i fall to my knees
<br />to the ground i fall, kneeling
<br /><br />i try my best to pray
<br />but my words begin to fade
<br />this pain travels nearer
<br />and i start to get afraid
<br /><br />the light begins to shine
<br />and as im about to go
<br />i see the face i loved so much
<br />and it begins to glow
<br /><br />I say to her
<br />you look so great
<br />to have to leave
<br />how i hate this fate
<br /><br />i kiss her one last time
<br />holding her as close as i can
<br />i then begin to fade away
<br />just as i began
<br /><br />the light begins to shine brighter
<br />slowly she starts to disappear
<br />and thus my life is ended
<br />with one last and final tear
