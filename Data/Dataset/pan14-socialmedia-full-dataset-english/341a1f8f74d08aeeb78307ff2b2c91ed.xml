<br />I lift you to my mouth.
<br />The abundance of your wetness greets me
<br />and my mouth overflows with your warm essence.
<br />Your sweet taste is on my tongue
<br />and your fragrance delights my senses.
<br />No gentle lick this visit.
<br />No bashful cautious approach
<br />For I wish to consume you.
<br /><br />Push against my hungry mouth
<br />As the tip of my tongue slides up the slippery furrow
<br />that welcomes me between rows of delicate pink petals.
<br />Thrust against my generous tongue.
<br /><br />Show me the power of your desire
<br />for my oral caress.
<br />My exploring tongue lifts the hood
<br />and finds your smooth firm pearl.
<br />You squeal in that unique way,
<br />signaling that I have found your special spot.
<br />I harden in response.
<br /><br />My jaws protests what my open mouth provides
<br />but I am unrelenting in my gift,
<br />intent only on your fulfillment.
<br />I feel your body tense,
<br />and you are quiet now...
<br />Concentrating... bearing down.
<br />Soon now my love,
<br />ecstasy approaches.
<br /><br />You push hard and fast against my tongue,
<br />shameless in using me
<br />and I so willingly comply
<br />until you cry out...
<br />and in your satisfaction,
<br />I will find mine,
<br />But mine will be the greater.

They are very laid back and tend to piss people off when they drive too slow or too fast down the road in their ol' pickup trucks.
<br /><br /># They love women/men (preferrably Cowgirls/boys), country music, wearin' jeans, wearin' boots (may be leather), wearin' a cowboy hat, yellin' yyyyyeeeehhhhhaaaaaawwwwww! out loud, shootin' the bull (talkin and telling some stories), fishin', huntin' watching wrestlin', watchin' or goin' to NASCAR races, watchin' baseball, or watchin' football.
<br /><br /># Rednecks may also like the rodeo. They love ridin’ horses or bulls, or ropin’ calves. Most Rednecks can usually be found at or off your local gravel road, in Texas, Tennessee, Mississippi, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Arizona, Georgia, Alabama, South Carolina, and maybe even in other southern states. They will be found on or near your local farm, at a bar (playin pool), local rodeo event and or stock show. The Redneck diet may include t-bone, tender loin, beef, beef stew, cajun food, Burger King, pizza, and maybe some good ol’ peach cobbler fer desert.
<br /><br /># Things that make a redneck mad: somebody stealin’ his healthy horse, making a promise which you can’t keep, cuttin’ down rodeo evernts, and much more.
<br /><br /># Things that really piss a redneck off is: stealin’ his cowgirl, a guy hitting a gal, a guy cheating on his gal, child abuse,beatin’ up his haas(word which means buddy), messin with his family, and much more. I tell ya, most rednecks like to fight for their woman and/or to defend their own honor. And i guarantee you if a true redneck sees you do one of the things in this list that redneck will whoop your @$$ right then and there
<br /><br /># Rednecks know how to treat women. Rednecks know how to respect, love, and care about gals. True Rednecks love females for who they are and would never cheat on them. A True redneck would never hit or injur a female. White trash lies to females, cheat on them, beat them, get them pregnant and then leave them.
<br /><br /># How can your friends be more important than yourself? This might be a question from a typical non-redneck. Where the outdoors are loved and where blue-collar labor is not looked down on but a way of life. Where hard hats are worn instead of pocket protectors. Where steel toe boots are worn instead of nice loafers. Where blue jeans and a flannel are preferred to a nice coat and tie. Rednecks are the people that make the world go round! 
<br /><br />* 4. Rednecks are not stupid. In the bountiful ignorance of most cityfolk, they have confused ignorance with stupidity and proven my point themselves. There are old rednecks in these hills that never went past the second grade that have more knowledge in the head than most of those acedimic boobs that profess to be &quot;educated&quot;. Once had some of these fellers poken fun at me for miss using an economic term, but when I asked them a question, damned if any one of 'em knew how much hardener to add to a golf ball sized helpin of body puddy!! Guess they must'a just been stupid??

HMMM what a load of crap that is, if that was true why the hell is my life shitty then? Nothing ever good happen to me yet that will stick with me my whole life, and what about all these asshole in life that get everything. Maybe i should start become a asshole then, nah i don't think i will because that is not me. I will stick to being good and doing good things for ppl even though i know it will not get me anywhere, but hey that life right. Good guy get shit on and always end up last, and asshole get everything.

<br />They said had run the light
<br />That caused the six-car pileup
<br /><br />On 109 that night.
<br />When broken bodies lay about
<br />And blood was everywhere,
<br /><br />The sirens screamed out eulogies,
<br />For death was in the air.
<br />A mother, trapped inside her car,
<br /><br />Was heard above the noise;
<br />Her plaintive plea near split the air:
<br />'Oh, God, please spare my boys!
<br />She fought to loose her pinned hands;
<br />She struggled to get free,
<br />But mangled metal held her fast
<br />In grim captivity.
<br /><br />Her frightened eyes then focused
<br />On where the back seat once had been,
<br />But all she saw was broken glass and
<br />Two children's seats crushed in.
<br />Her twins were nowhere to be seen;
<br />She did not hear them cry,
<br /><br />And then she prayed they'd been thrown free, 
<br />Oh, God, don't let them die! 
<br />Then firemen came and cut her loose, 
<br />But when they searched the back, 
<br /><br />They found therein no little boys, 
<br />But the seat belts were intact.
<br />They thought the woman had gone mad
<br />And was traveling alone, 
<br />But when they turned to question her, 
<br /><br />They discovered she was gone.
<br />Policemen saw her running wild
<br />And screaming above the noise
<br /><br />In beseeching supplication, 
<br />Please help me find my boys!
<br />They're four years old and wear blue shirts;
<br />Their jeans are blue to match.
<br />One cop spoke up, ''They're in my car, 
<br />And they don't have a scratch.
<br /><br />They said their daddy put them there
<br />And gave them each a cone, 
<br />Then told them both to wait for Mom
<br />To come and take them home.
<br />I've searched the area high and low, 
<br />But I can't find their dad.
<br /><br />He must have fled the scene, 
<br />I guess, and that is very bad.
<br /><br />The mother hugged the twins and said, 
<br />While wiping at a tear, 
<br />He could not flee the scene, you see, 
<br />For he's been dead a year.'The cop just looked confused and asked, 
<br /><br />Now, how can that be true?
<br />The boys said, ''Mommy, Daddy came 
<br />And left a kiss for you.'' 
<br />He told us not to worry
<br />And that you would be all right, 
<br />And then he put us in this car with
<br />The pretty, flashing light. 
<br /><br />We wanted him to stay with us, 
<br />Because we miss him so, 
<br />But Mommy, he just hugged us tight 
<br />And said he had to go.
<br /><br />He said someday we'd understand
<br />And told us not to fuss, 
<br />And he said to tell you, Mommy, 
<br />He's watching over us.
<br /><br />The mother knew without a doubt
<br />That what they spoke was true, 
<br />'For she recalled their dad's last words, ' ' I will watch over
<br />you.'
<br /><br />The firemen's notes could not explain
<br />'The twisted, mangled car, 
<br />And how the three of them escaped
<br />Without a single scar.
<br />But on the cop's report was scribed, 
<br />In print so very fine, 
<br />An angel walked the beat tonight on Highway 109.

<br /><br />What I Love About You
<br /><br />I love the way you look at me,
<br />Your eyes so bright and blue.
<br />I love the way you kiss me,
<br />Your lips so soft and smooth.
<br /><br />I love the way you make me so happy,
<br />And the ways you show you care.
<br />I love the way you say, &quot;I Love You,&quot;
<br />And the way you're always there.
<br /><br />I love the way you touch me,
<br />Always sending chills down my spine.
<br />I love that you are with me,
<br />And glad that you are mine.
<br /><br />A stranger you were once.
<br />Then, with a gentle look you took my hand.
<br />As our lives engaged,
<br />you lit my life and I held both your hands.
<br />Now that decades have passed,
<br />ours souls have indeed become one.
<br />How fortunate we are 
<br />that we have found the love so true
<br />that everyone dreams about.

<br />Empty his heart of all but blood,

<br />This the soul to God I give.
<br /><br />You have your parties and drink your beer,
<br />While young men are dying over here.

<br /><br />There is one thing that you should know;
<br />And that's where I think you should go!
<br />I'm already here and it's too late.
<br />I've traded all my love for all this hate.
<br /><br />I'll hate you till the day I die.
<br />You made me hear my buddy cry.
<br />I saw his leg and his blood shed,
<br />Then I heard them say, &quot;This one's dead&quot;.
<br /><br />It was a large price for him to pay,
<br />To let you live another day.
<br />He had the guts to fight and die,
<br />To keep the freedom you live by.

<br /><br />There is discipline in A Soldier
<br />you can see it when he walks,
<br />There is honor in A Soldier
<br />you hear it when he talks.
<br />There is courage in A Soldier
<br />you can see it in his eyes,
<br />There is loyalty in A Soldier
<br />that he will not compromise.
<br />There is something in A Soldier
<br />that makes him stand apart,
<br />There is strength in A Soldier
<br />that beats from his heart.
<br />A Soldier isn't a title any man
<br />can be hired to do,
<br />A Soldier is the soul of that man
<br />buried deep inside of you.
<br />A Soldier's job isn't finished after
<br />an 8 hour day or a 40 hour week,
<br />A Soldier is always A Soldier
<br />even while he sleeps.
<br />A Soldier serves his country first
<br />and his life is left behind,
<br />A Soldier has to sacrifice what
<br />comes first in a civilian's mind.
<br />If you are civilian -
<br />I am saying this to you.....
<br />next time you see A Soldier
<br />remember what they do.
<br />A Soldier is the one that is brave
<br />protecting you and me.
<br />If you know A Soldier -
<br />I am saying this to you.....
<br />Respect is all we ask

<br />the painful silence they shared
<br />between them that night. The girl then
<br />asked the boy to pull over because she
<br />wanted to talk. She told him that her
<br />feelings had changed &amp; that it was
<br />time to move on. A silent tear slid
<br />down his cheek as he slowly reached
<br />into his pocket &amp; passed her a folded
<br />note. At that moment, a drunk driver
<br />was speeding down that very same
<br />street. He swerved right into the
<br />drivers seat, killing the boy.
<br />Miraculously, the girl survived.
<br />Remembering the note, she pulled it

Sometimes they're little, subtle moments. Sometimes, they're big moments you never saw coming. No one ask for their life to change, but it doses. It's what you do afterwards that counts. That's when you find out who you are.
<br /><br />Life is too short to wake up in the mourning with regrets. So love the people who treat you right, forget the ones who don't. If you get a chance take it, it just might change your life.

<br />Means: Absolutely nothing. It's a conditioned response.
<br /><br />&quot;IT WOULD TAKE TOO LONG TO EXPLAIN&quot;
<br />Means: &quot;I have no idea how it works.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;I WAS LISTENING TO YOU. IT'S JUST THAT I HAVE THINGS ON MY MIND.&quot;
<br />Means: &quot;I was wondering if that redhead over there is wearing a bra.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;TAKE A BREAK HONEY, YOU'RE WORKING TOO HARD&quot;.
<br />Means: &quot;I can't hear the game over the vacuum cleaner.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;THAT'S INTERESTING, DEAR.&quot;
<br />Means: &quot;Are you still talking?&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;YOU KNOW HOW BAD MY MEMORY IS.&quot;
<br />Means: &quot;I remember the theme song to 'F Troop', the address of the first girl I ever kissed, and the vehicle identification numbers of every car I've ever owned, but I forgot your birthday.&quot;

<br /><br />&quot;WHAT DID I DO THIS TIME?&quot;
<br />Means: &quot;What did you catch me at?&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;I HEARD YOU.&quot;
<br />Means: &quot;I haven't the foggiest clue what you just said, and am hoping desperately that I can fake it well enough so that you don't spend the next three days yelling at me.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;YOU KNOW I COULD NEVER LOVE ANYONE ELSE&quot;
<br />Means: &quot;I am used to the way you yell at me, and realize it could be worse.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;YOU LOOK TERRIFIC&quot;

<br /><br />&quot;I'M NOT LOST. I KNOW EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE.&quot;

<br /><br />&quot;WE SHARE THE HOUSEWORK&quot;
