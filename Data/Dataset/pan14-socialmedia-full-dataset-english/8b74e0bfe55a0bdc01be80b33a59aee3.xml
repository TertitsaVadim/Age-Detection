<br /><br />It's summer and everything is boring. I mean, I got a lot of job to do (such as eating, sleeping, and eating again) yet I felt like everything is weaved in a very bland and dry way. Complicated? Yeah, it is. But my point is, these stuffs were all that I wanted. I supposed to enjoy these but everything turned out to be boring...
<br /><br />Allow me to name it one by one...
<br /><br />1. I am taking up animation classes which required an amount of Php 1200.00 as a tuition fee. Well, though it's a bit expensive, it's animation classes anyway that's way I scraped my last money just to be with the class. It's been my dream to know about animation. Our classes started last April 30. Well, I was excited to attend the class at first until the first day comes. To may dismay, I find out that the class is really a heck when ---- First Lesson: Image Editing with Adobe Photoshop! Toinks... It's not that I'm bragging but I guess anybody who must attend an animation classes is already expected having knowledge with the use of the program so that the 'animation' discussion would go smoothly. Unfortunately, I have to wait with my classmates to know photoshop first before we could go on with the next lesson. To sum it all, it's not what I expected. I am the only accelerated student in our animation class... Ahay... Sayang akong 1 thou...
<br /><br />2. The second boring thing is my part-time job which required me to write movie reviews--- for a Korean student who is finishing her thesis. Wow, at first it's great because the job is all about writing and watching movies... It is supposed to be great but I already find it boring. Why? I have to watch movies which I don't like. I need to watch every move of the motion picture (even if I don't like it) so that I can make a good review... Whoaaa... Really tiring...
<br /><br />3. The third one is our job with Bhoy Pierce and Bhoy Jick as freelance graphics artist... At first, I am really excited with the job because, of course, I would be working with my two great buddies. Hehehe... But unfortunately, I already find the job boring. (Sorry Bhoy!) I don't know... Maybe, I am just carried away by my boredom with other things... Hehe... (But don't worry Bhoys, magtatrabaho parin ako kahit delayed ang sweldo...)
<br /><br />4. I am alone again in my boarding house. My latest roommate had just left. That's why, IT'S REALLY BORING... My only companion there is Arthur, the adopted teddy bear from Emann and Love... Hehe... Mahirap kausapin si Arthur dahil hindi naman nagsasalita...
<br /><br />Hehehe... Though bored, I can assure you one thing. Boredom will never kill me...

I am not and I am shamelessly admitting that since the day you said goodbye, everything around me turned dull and gloomy. I won’t even deny the fact that I miss you everyday in everything that I do. As much as I would like to condition my mind with the thought that you’re not worth missing for ? nah, it is already a great stupidity if I would continue brain-washing myself in that way. You actually worth it anyway, so let it be. However, the feeling is just only limited in missing you. I just missed and I would prefer feeling that way than having you back. I missed you but I don’t want you back. That is the main reason why I am making no effort to rekindle things between us. Why? It is simply because everything is already enough. And enough is enough. Afterall, life is not all about you.
<br /><br />While I am shamelessly admitting that I was badly hurt when you turned your back on me, please allow me also to thank you for breaking my heart for I really learned a lot from it. Your absence as well as your harsh decision had made me become a better person now. Your absence had given me solitude to figure things out that afterall, life is not all about love ? and more, life is not all about you. You had imparted and taught me that I can fix my broken pieces all by myself, inspired by my own heartaches. I have learned to do it my way without you.
<br /><br />But sure again, it is stupidity if I would say that learning those lessons is an easy way. No, it’s not. I am admitting that though those lessons had instantly made me to better from bitter, learning it came through a very throbbing process. Everything was painfully taught to me. I painfully learned, and I painfully became a better person. However again, though everything is associated with that cursing word the dictionaries refer as ‘pain’, I guess I must thank you still. After the long hurting run, you had helped me discover the beauty beyond pain and as well as the lessons of pain. You had helped me to figure things out that in my first-ever life’s heartbreak, it is not all about frustrations and aches. Of course, those had come along, but you had opened my eyes to find the underlying bliss beneath the sorrows that you made.
<br /><br />Say that my life now is dancing with the hurting melody of grief.  Yes, it maybe is. But it is only for now. My life is maybe surrounded now with gloom, but don’t dare laugh at me. Take note that it’s only for now. For as soon as tomorrow comes, I am confident that I can get over and recover from this.
<br /><br />Say that I badly missed you. Yes, I do and what the hell I care if I do. In fact, I even keep on galloping back to the memories we’ve spent together, squeezing some sweetness from it to momentarily aide the bitterness that you did. In effect, because I desperately miss you, your faces is everywhere around me ? from the wall of my room to the wallpaper of my cellphone. But again, don’t make it as a laughing stock. Don’t ever claim that I got the greatest loss! Just wait ‘til I can recover and I would surely be burying all our memories and I would surely be burning all your images. I just missed you and it’s only as of the moment. It’s only for now. I know that little by little everyday, I will slowly learn living a life without you ? without missing you. Take note, I am even learning now…
<br /><br />Say that all I have now are shattered wings. Well, perhaps. But still, don’t say you got the last laugh! With what happened, my eyes are opened to the reality that afterall, I need not to worry for I don’t really have wings to be shattered. It is only you who made me believe that I have those stuffs; that I can fly ? when in fact, all I have are feet that must be kept in the ground. Well, after dreaming so hardly that I can really fly and with you suddenly leaving me floating in the space, I am now thrown badly in the ground. But laugh not at me! I don’t actually have shattered wings to be fixed after what you did, for in reality, I don’t really have wings. All I have now are not shattered wings but broken legs. And wait ‘til the wound heals. With these feet, someday, I’ll kick you out of my life.
<br /><br />Say I am badly hurt. Say I badly missed you. Yes, I am. Yes I do. And it’s not your business anymore… Say that it was my greatest loss. Yes it was. However, I don’t care losing great anymore! At least for now, I am just being true in admitting it. Afterall, my life is not all about you.
<br /><br />Well, how about you? How did you feel about this thing you call as ‘final breakup’? Aren’t you badly hurt too? Aren’t you missing me too? Com’on! Don’t be stupid and silly! Don’t be such a great pretender. Let’s just be true to ourselves…
<br /><br />Afterall, your life is not all about me… Hehehe
<br /><br />___________________________
<br /><br />Afterall and after these, what I would get next is an acting award for being so dramatic… Wahehehe! Oscar, Grammy, Academy…. Are you there? Hehe…

<br /><br />My life is back to normal now.
<br /><br />I suppose to watch Spiderman 3 today alone in one of the theaters in Dumaguete, but unfortunately, I did not manage to get a gate pass. (FYI: Dumaguete is really late when it comes to showing movies.) A lot of people had been lining up, and since my laziness to stand patiently in the midst of a crowd circulated in my veins again, I just chose to back out and spend the rest of the day with Carla and Bhoy Jick.
<br /><br />Well, it was supposed to be a boring day until we find some stored hard disks in a side of the room. As a computer engineering student myself (ew, as if), an idea that something is inside the hard disks popped out in my mind so I installed it in the computer. In a wink, the day suddenly turned colorful…
<br /><br />We find out that the content of the disks were pictures and videos of the publication staff’s activities and outings in the past years. And we indeed enjoyed watching the faces of the people in the pictures and videos while comparing it to their present features. The videos were hilarious and the people too. Of course, we are no excuse to that. My stomach was really aching because laughing so hardly while seeing my whole feature years ago… I am still young and virgin in those days… (Joke)
<br /><br />One of the realizations that I discovered from gazing over those stored memories is that IT IS ALREADY CONFIRMED that I am not growing any younger anymore. I am already becoming mature, although not mentally, but physically. Another not-so-embarassing-but-still-embarassing thing that I found out is the fact that I am gaining weight. A lot of people had already told me that I am becoming chubby but I did not believe them since I cannot feel it. Oh well, today, I could really say that I am indeed gaining weight (but just gaining weight and not really turning chubby)… We really laughed out loud when we saw my half-naked picture in a beach during an outing. Waaaah, I was really bony and I really wonder where I got the guts to pose that way when my body is so ‘pitiful’ that time. Hehe
<br /><br />More than that, after watching those memoirs, I started missing people. I really missed those particular times--- the never-ending stupidities of friends which was captured by the photos; the dramatic and serious events, meetings, and outings; and of course, the remarkable unlimited ‘boodle fights’ that the staff enjoyed in the entire year. 
<br /><br />Well, after watching those, I just hope that this year we, the entire staff, will continue to weave and capture again worth-remembering memories. So that one day, when we will came across with it, we will again laugh over it as we refresh it in our rusty minds.  
<br /><br />Drama, isn’t it? But it’s really true… Hehe…
<br /><br />____________________
<br /><br />Suddenly, I got this ‘flavor of the minute’ song which I downloaded from the internet and was played repeatedly on my phone. I really don’t like this (since songs like this had never passed my taste of music in my entire life) but I guess, it fitted to my sort of far-out dramas today. Hehe. To note, this is also one of our graduation songs when I graduated in high school. I don’t really know who sang this but the lines goes this way:
<br /><br />Memries,
<br />Like the corners of my mind
<br />Misty water-colored memories
<br />Of the way we were
<br />Scattered pictures,
<br />Of the smiles we left behind
<br />Smiles we gave to one another
<br />For the way we were
<br />Can it be that it was all so simple then? 
<br />Or has time re-written every line? 
<br />If we had the chance to do it all again
<br />Tell me, would we? could we? 
<br />Memries, may be beautiful and yet
<br />Whats too painful to remember
<br />We simply choose to forget
<br />So its the laughter
<br />We will remember
<br />Whenever we remember...
<br />The way we were...
<br />The way we were...

Sometimes we just have to go with… For whatever happens --- happens.
<br /><br />Someday, everything will all make perfect sense. So for now, laugh at the confusion, smile through the tears, and let’s be always reminded that EVERYTHING HAPPENED FOR A REASON. 
<br /><br />These realizations had opened up my mind this summer. Although this time of the year was literally boring, it was seasoned with so many events that somehow made me comprehend that sometimes we must free ourselves from the hassle and bustles of life and go with its flow. In the end, the reason why it happened is: ‘everything happened for a reason.’ Something was instilled for us somewhere.
<br /><br />The events of my life earlier this year was traumatic and agonizing, and unlike other people who have experienced the events with me, I must admit that it wasn’t easy for me to move on and keep the past a history. The pain had remain and it’s there hurting me. However, this summer, something enlightened me and made me realize why I must hold on to the pain when I can set myself free. What do I get from bearing the pain anyway when everyone had already moved on? According to them, those events happened for a reason. So like them, I must stand on that belief too…
<br /><br />When Lola passed away earlier this year, I was really heartbroken and felt like I will never be complete again. Although I am just silent with the whole event, it pained me so much knowing the fact that I had lost one of the important persons in my life. Adding more to that, I missed the chance to be there in her last moments --- the time when she lost her breath and the time she was buried. I was not even given the chance to see her cold remains, for a lot of firm circumstances and concrete reasons stopped me to do so. And so I said, I might be grieving forever because of losing her. However though, this summer, I had observed that everyone’s life in the family had already been back to normal while I was there keeping the pain. And so I said, I must set myself free. Lola’s death happened for a reason. Although we were still not ready with it, she had been long suffering with her ailment that is why, maybe, God just wanted her to rest. Taking the reason and setting myself free is the best way that I thought. Besides, Lola would never ever be happy seeing me in pain --- seeing me incomplete.
<br /><br />When a big problem, strike our family also early this year, I really stumbled. I felt like its melting especially when a certain problem includes shame and degradation of reputation and dignity not just on one individual but to a whole family. I had watched my sister crying for it (for she was the main reason why it happened). I had witnessed Mama shedding tears and Papa taking deep sighs. And I was there, stumbling. However, this summer, contrarily and while I was keeping the pain, I have seen how Mama and Papa moved on --- taking the problem not a problem, acting like nothing happened, and living positively with my sister’s mess. I have watched them how they cope, hope and try to bring back the ‘glow’ in our home. They are fighting the problem and so are the rest of my family and of course, my sister. While they were doing that, I discovered that I am not doing such. Mama and Papa were the main persons who were affected. Therefore, I realized that if my Mama and Papa had managed to move on from my sister’s mess, I guess, I must too. And mind you, after I did it, life in our family is better now. We believed it happened for a reason. Though people see my sister’s pregnancy as a wrong thing, I don’t care. So what? We have moved on from the shame, and we’re now looking forward to the glory of the problem. While Mama and Papa are open-heartedly expecting their first ‘apo,’ I will soon become an uncle. (It’s exciting, isn’t it<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/unsure.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />What is in my mind now is the reason that those things happened for a reason, therefore, I must not keep the pain. I have stopped over, let it go, and moved on… FOR EVERYTHING HAPPENED FOR A REASON…

I stopped from what I am doing and took some time reading the short story which I wrote years ago. The story is basically written inspired by my first girlfriend (which broke me up almost a month ago) and the setting in the manuscript happened five years ago. While reading at the story, I cannot help but smile while noticing that the short story was written in a very dramatic, or should I say OA manner. Everything is still vivid to me when Sir Romy, our adviser, edited that story last year. For almost a month, I have been the center of his jokes because he said he never thought I am as deep and as serious as that (stated in the story) when in comes to intimate relationship.
<br /><br />Well, I myself now, could really say that it was indeed an OA writing. Really ew! It was about how I and my first GF started a preface of our love story…
<br /><br />___________________________________
<br /><br />STUPIDITY
<br /><br />IT WAS A LATE afternoon of September when I chose to be stupid. I shivered a little as I sat on that life-sized stone for almost an hour, looking up blankly at the distant mountain filled with creeping daffodil bushes. The sky was alive with cotton-like clouds and the whole place was supposed to be quiet if not without the rustling dance of fallen dry leaves and the soft cries of the breeze. My blank mind had been awakened several times by the calachuchi blossoms hitting my head, and its saccharine aroma was as if reminding me that what I am doing was a full inanity.
<br /><br />She told me to meet and wait for her in that place after school dismissal, to clarify things, perhaps. It was a place a bit distant from the highway, situated some few meters to the seashore. There was a feeling of uncertainty creeping into my whole self and it was beyond words to illustrate. 
<br /><br />My consciousness was awakened again after I was hit by another flower from the plump calachuchi tree trunk kissing the stone where I sat. I decided to stand up and explore the surroundings while waiting for her aiming to at least ease the horrid mood that I felt even just for a moment. I jumped down from the stone, and I was about to take some steps when a soft spoken voice called me, “ Jordan , are you leaving?”
<br /><br />I froze. I already knew who owned that voice. It was her voice. I felt that her voice struck me and made my knees to shudder and my shoulders to wobble. I was running out of words. I turned back to face her with a feeling that everything turned into slow-motion. I tried to paste a normal smile on my lips as what I used to but I find a hard way doing it. I felt that my body turned numb as I watched her approaching nearer to me.   
<br /><br />She was still wearing her school uniform with her long, straight robin-black hair falling to her shoulders, gracefully swaying as she walked. The eyes she had welcomed to me were wide and lightened by something. I still did not utter any word. I just stared at her blankly with innerness as if trodden by a million hoofs of horses. Her delicate beauty and her fine, smooth, pale olive skin shone richly in the rays of the late noon’s sunlight. Her straight and finely molded nose coaxed with her full and crimson lips as she pasted a charming smile. And then she spoke again, “Sorry Jordz, I’m 15 minutes late… ”
<br /><br />Another calachuchi blossom hit me again, this time, on my forehead. It was only then when I realized that I should say a word or else I would end up hilarious in her front, freezing and trembling. 
<br /><br />“Ah… no… It’s okay,” I said while getting off my sight out from her and kept my voice not to stutter. “I just also arrived about 10 minutes before you did.” I lied just to say a word.
<br /><br />“Really? I thought I made you wait long,” she said with a smile. She drew nearer and sat in the side of the rock nearest to where I stood. “I supposed you’re leaving because you thought I’m not coming anymore.”
<br /><br />“No, no… I’m not,” I uttered with my eyes looking at the ground as I made some steps backward to keep a little distance from her. “I know you’re coming…” I crossed my legs and sat on the ground pretending that I am not tensed.
<br /><br />Silence followed. The more the silence went, the faster the thumping of my heart. I tried to think of something to break the silent gap but I couldn’t think of any topic. I felt like I am a mouse cornered by a hungry cat. And then she spoke again.
<br /><br />“This is such a beautiful place, isn’t it?”
<br /><br />“Yeah. You absolutely said it right…” I answered back, pretentious that I am not uncomfortable.
<br /><br />And there was silence again…. I could hear her soft breaths while I kept my eyes on the ground, playing my fingers.
<br /><br />She broke the silence again. “You’re so quiet…” she said with a sigh. I felt like her words made me stupefy. I wished that I could talk and talk and prove to her that she was wrong, but I couldn’t.
<br /><br />“You’re not like that. You’ve never been as quiet as that before every time when we’re together!” she said in a low voice. I felt like something was holding on my lungs as I tried to answer her back. I wanted to rebut her but I couldn’t grasp of any exact word. Maybe because, what she was telling me was right.
<br /><br />“You’ve changed a lot these past few days. And maybe I just missed the Jordan I used to be with before—my best friend and my ultimate companion. I missed you,” she said with a lonely tone in her voice.
<br /><br />“Lol as in laugh out loud. What’s that drama all about?” I finally answered back with a faked smile as I tried to change the mode of our conversation. “It seems that I already watched that in a teleserye! Ah no…from A Walk to Remember? Huh, not a good movie,” I added. It was a joke. But deep in me, I regretted why I said so, why I was like a fool escaping from getting serious.
<br /><br />“Jordz, it’s not a drama. I’m serious!” she walked and drew near to me. She stood in my front and looked fixedly at me with solemn eyes. I felt like I am on my way of losing consciousness again. I got my sight off from her while her breaths were ringing through my ears. 
<br /><br />“Jordz, please don’t act as if everything is alright. Please don’t pretend that there’s nothing wrong between us. Don’t act as if you know nothing. Much more, don’t act as if you don’t know that you’ve changed. You’ve changed a lot Jordz! You’ve changed a lot… You’ve changed since…”
<br /><br />“Since the day I gave you the love letter?” I interrupted her with a louder voice. “Then, forget about it! Forget the love letter…” My last words were softer but with emphasis. Something —courage urged me to talk to her straight to her eyes.
<br /><br />She looked astounded by my words and marks of confusion were painted into her face. “What do you mean?”
<br /><br />“I mean, forget about it. Forget everything that I’ve wrote in that letter — or say that those were just mere lies, or jokes or a play… So that everything will be okay, so that you will not think that I’ve changed!” I said in a louder and sounding-heated voice. She did not speak. She only threw me a stern look.
<br /><br />“Or do you still expect that everything will be normal again after that damn letter that I wrote? Do you still expect that I won’t change after writing you that I love you, that I fall in love with my best friend? I don’t think so. I don’t see myself acting as what I am before when it was not already a secret to you that I loved you.” It was the braver me who spoke again while seeing those little drops of liquids forming through her eyes.
<br /><br />She then spoke. “And your words before that you would never change—that you would still be my best friend no matter what happen. What are those? Castles of clouds? You said that you will never change no matter what happens… that includes…”
<br /><br />“Includes that even if I’m in love with you, I won’t still change? Kas, we need to face the reality, we’re not children anymore. We should not stick to that drama that is only possible on movies. I need to change… but I’m still you’re best friend!”
<br /><br />She only answered me back with a sigh. And then, she spoke. “So what’s the purpose of that letter you’ve wrote for me?”
<br /><br />I halted. I asked myself. What was really my purpose? To know if I have the chance? No. The question paralyzed my mind as I tried to formulate an answer. “I wrote that letter so that…. To be free… So that I will not sleep late at night thinking of ways how to let you know that I love you. So that I won’t wake up in the morning thinking how to hide the stupidity that I feel for you. So that you will know that I’m in love with you. That’s it and nothing else.”
<br /><br />“Nothing else?” she refuted.
<br /><br />I was stocked again. And then, words just came from my mouth, “Yeah, nothing else.” 
<br /><br />Silence followed. I got the chance to speak again. “Nothing else. I never wrote that letter because I see the chances. I never wrote that because I see the hope that you will love me too. I mean, of course you love me, but only as a best friend. Maybe I’m just too stupid to seek a love more than that… But again, I did not write it because I see the chance!”
<br /><br />She then faced me and talked in an irritated tone, “Do you know Jordz what’s the problem with you? The problem is that, you always assume…”
<br /><br />“I don’t assume. I’m just being practical. I’m just facing reality. I know I have no chance.”
<br /><br />“How did you know?”
<br /><br />“How did I know? It’s because as of press time, I’m still living in the reality and not in the clouds. It’s because I’m still intelligent and I don’t want to turn foolish because of this feeling. It’s because, you’re my best friend and I know what the type of guy you wanted and who your dream man is. It’s because…”
<br /><br />“It’s because you’re afraid to see the hope?” she expressed her words in a condemning tone. “And that’s what you call being in love as stated in your letter?”
<br /><br />“I’m not afraid to see it. I would even be the happiest human being on earth if I would see an ounce of it. But I must be practical. I have seen none.” I stood up, turned back and talked again without a full caution, “And please don’t try to let me assume that there’s really a hope. I know there’s none and if you will let me assume, it will just hurt me more.”
<br /><br />“Fine. So, you’re afraid to get hurt… and then that’s what you call state of being in love?” she countered in a insipid tone. 
<br /><br />“Afraid to be hurt? Huh! My God, the pain is already killing me dear! How come I’m afraid with it when at this very moment, I’m already hurt? Do you think knowing that I don’t have any chances at all is not such a hurting fact for me? Do you think all these stupidity that I am doing does no pain? Do you think it’s not painful to risk our friendship just to let you know that I love you? It hurts so much Kas. If I am afraid to be hurt, then I would have not done all these stupidity.” I just noticed frosty liquids were already dropping down my cheeks. I am already crying.
<br /><br />“You’re just hurting yourself. You never knew what the truth is. You just assume,” she said in an irritated mode.
<br /><br />“I did not. I know what the truth is!”
<br /><br />“It’s a mere assumption. Truth leaves no rooms for possibilities,” it’s her words, softer yet accusing.
<br /><br />“Possibilities? What’s the possibility about the truth that I got no chance at all? I got no rooms of chances, no rooms for possibilities”
<br /><br />“Possibilities are--- I might like you too. Haven’t you ever thought that?” her words were stiffer this time.
<br /><br />“My God. I’m not that stupid....”
<br /><br />“You really are stupid! You never know what the fact is!” She reciprocated.
<br /><br />“So fine. Now, would you mind telling me what the fact is?”
<br /><br />“The fact is....”
<br /><br />“What?”
<br /><br />“The fact is I also love you!” She said with a hesitation mixed in her voice, highlighting the last two words.
<br /><br />“What?” I countered in a rushing adrenaline. I felt like choking but something was holding me not to misinterpret her words with the thought that she was just trying to change the channel of the flamed confrontation. “Are you kidding?”
<br /><br />“Isn’t what I’ve said enough?” She replied.
<br /><br />“Of course, you also love me as a friend I know that...” I answered conditioning myself that I am maybe just misapprehending her statement. 
<br /><br />“I love you more than a friend! Enough?” her shocking statement expressed in a sweet-pissed-off sounded voice seemed pushing me to be drop-dead on the ground. I must be dreaming, I said to myself. I jumped, I pinched myself, I slapped my face and I shook my head, but still I am not awake. So, I concluded it was not a dream.
<br /><br />I don’t really know what exactly happened next to that. I just found myself sitting close to her on the ground matted with calachuchi blossoms, talking about our selves and sharing thoughts and dreams. We indeed missed each other’s company because we talked too much, I concluded. We stayed in the location while watching the sun setting reminding me that the stupid day has ended. It’s a continuation of our friendship and beginning of a new relationship, they so-called love, I said to myself. 
<br /><br />As darkness completely swathed the surrounding, and as the sand-spilled looking stars replaced the show of cotton-like clouds, the uneasiness I felt completely vanished. I felt like listening to a harmony enthralling the place. The rustling dry leaves, the splashing of sea waves and the daffodil bushes that turned calm, seemed integrating a sweet note on the tone played. The calachuchi flowers continuously hit me, yet it already seemed a gentle touch.
<br /><br />And then the sweet music stopped. She started talking again and she was now leaning on my shoulder. This time I know what juncture we will be talking of. It’s about our relationship. We still have a lot of things to discuss considering that many things are really in a need to be conferred.
<br /><br />“Actually, I really don’t know if it’s right for us to start up like this,” she said in a whispered voice.
<br /><br />“Me too, I know we differ a lot,” I said.
<br /><br />“I love sports why you don’t,” she countered.
<br /><br />“You love music while I love silence,” I stressed.
<br /><br />“I love to talk why you prefer to be quiet,” she uttered.
<br /><br />I ended up in a statement recounting our various differences. “You love eating shrimps, while I am allergic on it. I love sleeping late at night while you abhor it.  I am always early while you’re always late. I love laughing over problems while you want to cry over it. You are rich while I ....”
<br /><br />I was stopped by her pat. “Hey, is this really right?” She said in a sour smile.
<br /><br />“We clicked as friends. So maybe...” I answered slowly.
<br /><br />She then continued talking with a more mixed sadness on her tone “Besides, we know that I’m leaving next month with my family. We still don’t know when we will see each other again. Next year or the year after next, or the year after next year?”
<br /><br />“Damn!” I said to myself. I already know about the matter and I’m just trying to keep away from it. I know that her family will be migrating to the US the next month. I started crying again while I looked fixedly into her eyes. She started crying too.
<br /><br />“Everything really happened too fast. This relationship had just started a while ago and here we are crying over the consequences installed ahead of us.” I spoke in a hushed crying voice.
<br /><br />“So tell me Jordz, is this right?” She asked me again.   
<br /><br />I gulped and words just came out from my mouth. “If this love is wrong then I don’t want to be right,” I answered staring straight to her teary eyes.
<br /><br />“We still have a lot of things to get through. What if we can’t make it? What if we can’t learn to adjust with our differences? What if we get tired waiting for ourselves and got feed up with a long distance relationship? There are still a lot of things and along the way. We might get tired and let our love to just pass away.” She bombarded me in an undertone.
<br /><br />“Love can pass away. We can even let it pass and let it run away. But still, we can chase it back,” I answered, trying to cheer her.
<br /><br />“What if I’ll get tired?” Her debating logic ran once more.
<br /><br />“If you’ll get tired, then, I’ll carry you,” I answered. She smiled. And the music played again.
<br /><br />It is sure not yet a happy ending. Certainly, it is stupid. Deep inside me, I also have a question. What if I get tired of carrying her? Well, at least, we’ve tried to work it out. 
<br /><br />___________________________________
<br /><br />OA ano? Agree? Somebody actually told me that since we already broke up with my GF, I must also write an ending of our story. Heck, I just nodded and said, &quot;IT'S NOT ALREADY WORTH WRITING FOR!&quot;...
<br /><br />I am already tired carrying her. Lolz...

<br /><br />What else could I asked for? Today is never been boring to me. I spent the whole day having a movie marathon with pirated cds. (Sorry, I can’t really wait for genuine ones…) What is so good about it is that, I was given the chance to watch the movies which I have been longing to watch for; the movies which the theaters in Dumaguete forbid me (Note: They are very late and these movies are yet to be shown next week or the week after next.) I was able to watch Spiderman 3, Shrek The Third, and Pirates of the Caribbean: At World’s End… The three were all fine and splendid!
<br /><br />Here are some good lines and scenes of the movies that really made a kick:
<br />_____________________
<br /><br />In Spiderman 3:
<br />_____________________
<br /><br />Peter Parker: Flint Marko; the man who killed Uncle Ben, he was killed last night. 
<br />Aunt May: Oh my... What happened? 
<br />Peter Parker: Spider-Man killed him. 
<br />Aunt May: Spider-Man? I don't understand, Spider-Man doesn't kill people. What happened? 
<br />Peter Parker: I uh... he... he was... I thought that you'd feel... He deserved it, didn't he? 
<br />Aunt May: I don't think it's for us to say whether a person deserves to live or die. 
<br />Peter Parker: Aunt May, he killed Uncle Ben! 
<br />Aunt May: Uncle Ben meant the world to us, but he wouldn't want us living one second with revenge in our hearts. It's like a poison. It can take you over, before you know it, turn you into something ugly...
<br />_____________________
<br /><br />Peter Parker: Eddie, it's the suit. You've got to take it off. 
<br />Eddie Brock: Yeah, You'd like that, wouldn't ya? 
<br />Peter Parker: I've been there, Eddie. The power; it feels good. But you'll lose yourself to it. It'll destroy you. Take the suit off Eddie, it's not too late! 
<br />Eddie Brock: [&quot;Thinking&quot; about it] Nah... I like being *Bad*. It makes me... -HAPPY...
<br />_____________________
<br /><br />Peter Parker: This suit, where'd this come from? The power, feels good... But you lose yourself to it...
<br />_____________________
<br /><br />Peter Parker: Whatever comes our way, whatever battle we have raging inside us, we always have a choice. My friend Harry taught me that. He chose to be the best of himself. It's the choices that make us who we are, and we can always choose to do what's right.
<br />_____________________
<br /><br />Mary Jane Watson: We've all done terrible things to each other, but we have to forgive each other. Or everything we ever were will mean nothing.
<br />_____________________
<br /><br />Flint Marko: I didn't want this. But I had no choice... 
<br />Peter Parker: We always have a choice. You had a choice when you killed my uncle. 
<br />Flint Marko: My daughter was dying, I needed money. I was scared. I told your uncle all I wanted was the car. He said to me 'why dont you just put down the gun and go home?' I realise now he was just trying to help me. Then I saw my partner running over with the cash... and the gun was in my hand... I did a terrible thing to you; I spent a lot of nights wishing I could take it back. I'm not asking you to forgive me; I just want you to understand. 
<br />Peter Parker: I've done terrible things too... 
<br />Flint Marko: I didn't choose to be this. The only thing left of me now is my daughter. 
<br />Peter Parker: ...I forgive you...
<br />_____________________
<br /><br />In Shrek The Third
<br />_____________________
<br /><br />Prince Charming: You! You can't lie! Where is Shrek? 
<br />Pinocchio: Well, uh, I don't know where he's not. 
<br />Prince Charming: You don't know where Shrek is? 
<br />Pinocchio: On the contrary, 
<br />Prince Charming: So you do know where he is! 
<br />Pinocchio: I'm possibly more or less not definitely rejecting the idea that I undeniably 
<br />Prince Charming: Stop It! 
<br />Pinocchio: Do or do not know where he shouldn't probably be. If that indeed wasn't where he isn't!
<br />_____________________
<br /><br />Snow White: Right! Ladies, assume the position! 
<br />[Sleeping Beauty falls asleep, Rapunzel sits on a high stool with her braid trailing, Snow White lies down in her coffin pose, and Cinderella seats herself on the floor gazing dreamily into space] 
<br />Princess Fiona: What are you doing? 
<br />Snow White: [exasperated] Waiting to be rescued!
<br />_____________________
<br /><br />Donkey: [Donkey and Puss in Boots have switched bodies] I've been abra-cadabra'd into a Fancy Feasting second-rate sidekick! 
<br />Shrek: Donkey... 
<br />Donkey: I feel all exposed and nasty!
<br />_____________________
<br /><br />In Pirates of the Caribbean: At World’s End
<br />_____________________
<br /><br />Jack Sparrow: He needs the Pearl. Captain Turner needs the Pearl, 
<br />[to Elizabeth] 
<br />Jack Sparrow: and you felt guilty, 
<br />[to Barbossa] 
<br />Jack Sparrow: and you and you're Brethren Court. 
<br />[to everyone] 
<br />Jack Sparrow: Did no one come to save me just because they missed me?
<br />_____________________
<br /><br />Jack Sparrow: Why should I said with any of you? Four of you have tried to kill me in the past... one of you succeeded 
<br />[looks at Elizabeth] 
<br />Jack Sparrow:. Oh, she's not told you. You'll have loads to talk about while you're here. As for you... 
<br />[going to Tia Delma] 
<br />Tia Dalma: Now don't tell didn't enjoy it at the time? 
<br />Jack Sparrow: Fair enough. You're in. 
<br />[begins going do the line of pirates on the beach] 
<br />Jack Sparrow: Don't need you 
<br />[to Ragetti] 
<br />Jack Sparrow: , Gibbs, you can come, Marty, Cotton... Cotton's parrot, I'm a little iffy... At least I'll have someone to talk to... Who are you? 
<br />[to Tai Huang] 
<br />Tai Huang: Tai Huang. These are my men. 
<br />Jack Sparrow: Where does your allegiance lie? 
<br />Tai Huang: With the highest bidder. 
<br />Jack Sparrow: I have a ship. 
<br />Tai Huang: That makes you the highest bidder. 
<br />Jack Sparrow: Good man. 'Weigh anchor all hands. Prepare to make sail 
<br />[takes out compass] 
<br />Jack Sparrow: [Cotton's, squaking] 'Weigh anchor. 
<br />Jack Sparrow: Jack... Which way ya goin' Jack?
<br />_____________________
<br /><br />'Bootstrap' Bill Turner: One day on land and ten years at sea. It's an awfully high price to pay. 
<br />Will Turner: Depends on the one day.
<br />_____________________
<br /><br />Elizabeth Swann: It wasn't your burden to bear. 
<br />Will Turner: If you make your choices by yourself... How can I trust you? 
<br />Elizabeth Swann: You can't.
<br />_____________________
<br /><br />Elizabeth Swann: Often men offer desire as an excuse for their crimes. 
<br />Captain Sao Feng: I offer simply my desire.
<br />_____________________
<br /><br />Jack Sparrow: [Flies from one ship to another and lands on deck] and that was without a single drop of rum! 
<br />Davy Jones: Ha ha... Lookie here boys. The lost bird. A lost bird that never learned to fly. 
<br />Jack Sparrow: To my great regret. But, it's never too late to learn! 
<br />[uses the Dead Man's Chest to trigger a line to pull him up to the Flying Dutchman's mast]...

I don’t care if I would be forever remembered as a brainless coward who chose to surrender rather than to fight. I don’t care if people would keep in nodding as the memory of me crosses their minds --- a memory of a hopeless man who quitted hoping. I don’t really care. Anyway, if that time would come, my ears are already deaf to hear it; my eyes are already resting in full peace; my mind is already in an eternal solitude; and all of my senses are already numb…
<br /><br />I know what the consequences are. I know what would happen next. I know what things I would surely be missing. I know I would be hurting a lot of people. I know. But blame me not if I would do this. Blame me not. I’ve been a fighter too. I’ve been striving hard too to be somehow a winner of this seemingly incurable hopeless disease of fate. I’ve been a brave man too; a man full of hope. However though, sometimes, mind me, those weren’t enough to keep one standing on a ground…
<br /><br />I have fallen and mounted for so many times. It is just that this time, I am already tired from rising. Why? Everything seems to be an endless and boundless cycle. Rising and falling again and again is already tiring. I already get tired for I am just a human who could feel such. After falling for so many times, I came up into an idea: why not stay fallen on the ground forever --- and much better, if it’s under the ground. In there, I’ll found peace and solitude. In there, I could get away from the cruelties of life. 
<br /><br />I am ending this yoke. Goodbye world. Goodbye cruel fate…
<br /><br />(Goodbye Facebox… I’m doing this for a reason…)

I might decide to commit a suicide in the next few minutes (by hanging myself at my boarding house’ bathroom, or by jumping from the peak of the Bandera Building, or by getting myself drowned in the wastes of Banica River). I might be hit by a bicycle tomorrow or be stripped dead by my landlady’s all-time angry dogs. I might be hold-up later, and because the thieves can’t get expensive stuffs from me because I’m poor, the thieves might decide to kill me instead. Or as soon as I would sleep in the next few minutes, I might wake up no more…
<br /><br />You might think that I am already paranoid, insane, or crazy. But no, I’m just being practical. Nobody really knows. Everything is unpredictable and things can happen every now and then. Every tick of the clock was even said precious. Therefore, because of the fear that I might not be able to leave some words to the people around me before I will pass away, I am doing this now. The following is not really a last will and testament (because I don’t have any property except for my body, brain and soul…LOL). This is more of a suicide note (if ever I will commit a suicide), or finale words (if I will die unexpectedly). 
<br /><br />So, here it goes…
<br /><br />To Mama and Papa. I know that my sudden death would caused you much pain, however, please bear that seeing you in pain would also caused me more pain. Therefore, just give that stuff to me as a bonus. Please never ever cry. Sorry for all the damages I caused including the things that both of you had invested to me for my future that turned out wasted. Sorry for all the damages I caused including the burial fees. I am sorry. Always remember that I love you and please dwell on the brighter side of my death. My death means lessening your headaches (since I can’t anymore ask allowance and do stupid acts.) I love you and as Superman says “I’m just around.” Therefore, don’t be sad. 
<br /><br />To my siblings (specifically to my three younger brothers, Nonoy, Jayjay and Jimjim). Never ever give headaches to Mama and Papa. Else, you’ll get a headache from me. Kuya is just around (mumo) when you need him, and is always around to discipline you when you get hardheaded. 
<br /><br />To my TN family. This is OA guys but I need to say this. Adieu and thank you (Aw, may dapat ba akong pasasalamatan sa inyo? peace)… Of course, you’ve already been a family to me, a part of my life and everything… Huhuhu… 
<br /><br />To my co-TN Editors. Even if I’m dead, I won’t care bothering you though. Don’t be scared. Continue the overnights and continue everything. Continue living on our like-a-home office with air-conditioned accommodation, tummy-bulging foods, and unlimited internet access. 
<br /><br />To Ate Merl, our Assoc Ed, Thanks for being my Ate through thick and thin. It’s sad to note that I can’t already reach the age that you got (and your age must be something that you must thank for, peace). Thank you for everything. Anyways, I hope that you will soon find the guy that will fulfill your so called ‘elusive dreams.’ 
<br /><br />To Aubrey, our EIC. Brey, I know you got a crush on me but I’m sorry. I’m already dead and it’s your loss because you missed the chance of telling that feeling to me (hehehe, peace). Anyways, I hope that you will still find your true love, and I would be very happy if that true love would be in the names ‘Michael’ or ‘Ceasar’. Always remember, that if you got emotes including your endless tales of heartaches, just whisper it to the wind, I’ll be there to listen. That if, you won’t get scared of me. To idol, our News Ed. Idol, in my life I have missed so many things. Life is always full of surprising things. Therefore, whatever thing that you wanted to do, you must do it know for you might miss it. Ang gusto ko lang namang sabihin, kung mahal mo si Ameur, e di, ligawan mo na. Thank you! 
<br /><br />To the Senior Writers. To Maja. Cupkeyk (remember that), minimize your ‘katalipandasan’. Hehehe. Thanks for everything. You’ve been always there for me. Although sometimes, we can’t just connect our ‘lies’ that’s why we get caught in the end. Always remember to value Floyd, because he’s madly deeply inlove with you. Take care! To Yowh. I know you love Pambet therefore love him to the fullest. Thank you and I will always miss our Cooking Committee groups! Anyways, if you’re still interested and if you won’t get scared, I’m always ready to help you cook. Also, I know that you’ll be replacing me as the artist, and as the great artist (that avoids the obvious) as what you claimed, you got what it takes. 
<br /><br />To the TN feature writers, my feature dwarves. I, Feature Ogre, am still under in a great confusion if who among you would succeed my position. I know that both of you were good writers. One of you must become the features editor while the other one must be the assistant features editor. I hope that there would be no more war and I hope that Carla would give a way for Riza to be the features editor since Riza is already fed up being the alalay or what they call ‘assistant.’ I just want to thank for all the laughter we’ve shared (although wala jud ko ka-feel nga ni-respect mo nako as an editor) and for all the memories including the headaches. OA… To Baby Amps, you’ll be next Miss CAS and stop getting your suitors busted! It could hurt! Hehehe. To Riza, if one day you’ll fail becoming a chemist-journalist, always remember that Punchline and Clowns’ doors are always open for you (joke). I only know one thing for you. Someday, you’ll be Mrs. Amper, Mrs. Credo, or Mrs. Real. Feature Dwarves, sorry if I was not able to become a good features editor, that would keep following you up all of the time, but God knows I tried my best. It’s just that my best was not good enough. Hehehe… 
<br /><br />To the members of the Kawayan Society, the BHOYS (Bhoy Jick and Bhoy Pierce). (Drama!) Guys, I know that I will miss you and I’ll just see you in hell soon (hehehe)! Let‘s continue our foolishness and stupidity there, unless Saint Peter would give us rooms for that in heaven. Anyway Bhoys, I just want to thank you for everything, for the company, for being my true friends. Although we got lesser time for bonding, because both of you were busy with your girlfriends and ‘gugmang giatay’ while I am busy with mine too, I know you’ve been always there for me everytime I need somebody to talk to. Now that I’m gone, I would suggest that you would hire new members for our Society since kamo nalang duha ang nabilin. Just always reserve the Dabong name for me. Moreover, drama or not, I’m still around to help. Yaw mo pag-LQ ha? Hehehe…I only got few true visible friends (since most of them are invisible) here on earth and you’re among of those… 
<br /><br />To Ate Tonet. Thank you and please always take pictures including my death scene and burial… (It’s non-compulsory though, if you’ll get scared.) Thanks for being my Ate. Love Lory and Lowen always. To Ameur and Faith. I know that both of you would be happy with my death since nobody would bother teasing you all of the time. Though, I just want you to know that what I did is just what they call ‘nature’ in our fishbowl called ‘office.’ I’m not bad though and I am a friend. Sorry if I’ve been so rude. To Faith, sorry for the never-ending teases and jokes. I just want you to know that I am always a good brother if you need me, even if I’m dead. 
<br /><br />To Love. I know that you got grudges on me including my transformation from a ‘silent’ type to a ‘talkative’ one. I am sorry for that, it’s just that people wants me to change also into that way you least wanted for me. Sorry for the grudges and for being demanding in terms the drawing for the handurawan, mascot, and university diaries. I just want you to become a better Love. To Yanyan, my baby sis, stop being a ‘talipandas.’ I got no baby sister and I am just too unlucky that you’re all that I got, so please always be good! You got a big future (but not boobs) in journalism. You’ll be the next EIC! Thank you for everything and Kuya is always around to get you squared everytime mag-inigat ka! To Joel. Dong Rad, I hope that one day you will finally realize that your claim that you are Superman is just an elusive dream. Thank you for your respect to me as Kuya Mag although I’ve been rude sometimes. (I can’t just take it since I know that you got plans to shoed me as a features editor, peace. Your time to shine now is wavering since I’m already dead.) I hope that Satan would install a radio station in hell so as I could still listen you (respetar ra ba kay kaila gud ta…) To Alos, love Joel always. Sorry if sometimes I am too rude. It’s not that I don’t want you to become the Junior Silence Breaker, it’s just that you can become somebody greater than that silence breaker. Thank you and see you in hell soon… 
<br /><br />To my TN desperate housewives, Phuto and Bhicko. Your widows now and you got the freedom to flirt other guys the same way you are when I’m still alive. Thank you for the sweetness and laughter you’ve shared with me. Again, thank you and please don’t grieve. You can still find a guy better than me (feeler, as if you care). Minimize ang pagka-egat. I will always miss the two of you… 
<br /><br />To Maam Evz and Sir Amardz, thank you for always being there for me, for the help, for the guidance and for the care. For sure, I won’t see you in hell… 
<br /><br />To my relatives (my cousins, aunts, and uncles), thank you and I love you. I know I was never been perfect and I am very sorry for that. 
<br /><br />To my high school classmates and friends, I would be missing you. To Cherry, thank you. I might see Zeneith there, so don’t be sad of losing your two bestfriends. We could still communicate someday even if you’ll go to heaven. To Parekoy Brix, thanks for being my best true friend throughout my life. I would always miss the scandal movie marathon, and your never-ending stories of foolishness. And hey, unless you’ll stop that, I will really see you in hell one day. So what else could I say than continue that and we will continue that in hell one day. Thank you Parekoy, for always being there for me… 
<br /><br />To my fans (ayaw react kay naa bya), specifically the gays at the cafeteria who always request ‘Silence Breaker, buk-a ko’, thank you and somehow you made my liver puff… Hehehe. I can’t however grant your requests since I’m already dead. To the group of education and nursing students who’ve been always looking after my column and column pic (feeler!), thank you. To the cigarette and other sidewalk vendors, to the Student Laborers, and to the guards, who were always been my number one fans, thank you for inspiring me… OA! 
<br /><br />To My Friendster, Facebox, Multiply, Myspace, Ringo, BootyCall, BlogSpot, BlogChex, RoseOnline, Warcraft, and Pangya acquaintances and friends, I will surely miss you all. I love you all, and thanks for everything. There's no internet in hell, so sorry, ACCESS denied. Don't worry though. There's no way that I can haunt you online...
<br /><br />Lastly, to Bubbles, I don’t know what to say. You know how much you mean to me, how much I love you, and how much I value you so please don’t cry over my dead body (hehehe) because it will just hurt me more. You’re one of those that give me reasons to live. Sorry, I love you and Goodbye! 
<br /><br />That’s it. To everyone (kadtong majungero, ug ang tuyo kape ug tinapay), I never loved disco and party but I want to have it the night before my burial. I want to see you guys happy! 
<br /><br />Toinks... OA... But we never know...

<br /><br />1. Whether we like it or not, we are all human beings, great than any other life-form, walking on the earth of this complicated zygote they call life, leaving footsteps that may not stay forever. 
<br /><br />2. This is a democratic crazy psychotic world where you have a choice to leave remarkable footsteps. I just thought that if ever I would leave a footstep that would stay forever; I don’t want to leave one which is of a QUITTER.
<br /><br />3. I can only kill myself through writings but never in reality. It is so frustrating to discover that as much as I would like to condition my mind in doing it, I can’t really turn back to the fact that this crazy world is still beautiful. It is so frustrating that as much as I would like to end everything (as what I said in my write-ups), I can’t really do it. Thinking the process of killing me in whatever way is already unbearable. 
<br /><br />4. Killing me in my writings is my way of getting over my frustrations of being incapable of killing my own self in the reality. At least, I was killed in my writings. At least, I have rested for some time…
<br /><br />5. When I killed myself through words, pens, and papers, I always have the choice to bring back my life anytime I want it. And then, what if I killed myself in the reality? Do I ever have the authority to bring back my life? 
<br /><br />6. With all fairness, I discovered from the event that there are still a lot of people who love me despite my stupidity (thanks to my online friends in Friendster, MySpace, Blogspot, PAN, etc, who were too many to mention…) Thanks for the posts, calls, advices, and for saying “Stop” and “No!” I’m just too stupid… 
<br /><br />7. Bloopers happened in the event such as an EX-girlfriend calling you over the phone in a very friendly voice (as if you both have ended up nicely) while conversing you with phrases like “Life is not all about me. Don’t die for me. I felt guilty with these.” The funniest thing is, you want to slap here to be awake (but you cannot do it because she’s on the other line) and tell her, “Excuse me miss, wrongs number. I can’t relate. It’s AS IF I am doing this because of you.” 
<br /><br />8. I discovered who were really my true friends are (plural). I discovered who among them are ready to be with me in the downfalls of my life. Well, I just want to say thanks to my buddies who offered Red Horse, Colt 45, and whatever cursing drinks. Sorry if I turned it down. Tropicana twister is already enough. Huh, if I am just a drunkard! Don’t you worry guys, the thought of being there and cheering me counts the most. I was just too dramatic and thanks for slapping my face with the reality that it’s not yet the end of the world…
<br /><br />9. I discovered that the hurting is much larger when YOU FAIL YOURSELF than failing others. It pain is much bigger when you lose yourself than losing others. It’s like being stocked and tangled in an I-wanna-forget-breathing webs…
<br /><br />10. I am still young. And because I am young, I do stupid things, I think stupid things, and I feel stupid feelings. The good thing about it is, as time passes and as the wounds heal, I would just laugh over those stupidity and wonder why I did it or why I reacted the stupid way… 
<br /><br />11. I realize that I don’t want to end my life with the question “What if?”
<br /><br />12. I am just too stupid. As of the moment, I AM LAUGHING OVER MY STUPIDITY! At least, I am already laughing.

This article was published in the second issue of our university publication under my weekly column “Silence Breaker.” Just posting this here for the sake of the people WHO CAN RELATE…
<br />__________________________
<br /><br />Wondering about education
<br /><br />Seeing the vibrant and enthusiastic faces lurking around the campus as the school year opens had taken me back to a memory months ago, when we conducted an unplanned interview with the street children (if I can call them that way) of Dumaguete City, for an article that was supposed to be published in one of the issues in our university paper last semester.
<br /><br />I wonder if those faces who answered our questions with high hopes and innocence, would be among the vibrant and enthusiastic faces that every higher institution welcomes every school year. I wonder if years from now, those children whose young muscles are forcibly flexed by the laborious jobs such as scavenging recyclable waste materials and selling peanuts and rags everyday, could afford a higher education. I wonder if years from now, they would be enjoying the life any other university student enjoys.
<br /><br />While my mind is an avid aficionado of a happily-ever-after ending, wishing the best for those young unfortunate ones, I cannot set aside the virtual sad and harsh reality that with the current problems bedeviling the education system of the country for almost three decades now; their good future is vaguely painted. If we are to base it on today’s situation, we can really say that a blurry tomorrow is waiting for them, considering that the education crisis in our country currently deepens.
<br /><br />According to the study conducted by the Department of Education, out of 10 students entering Grade 1, six will complete the elementary course. Of the six students completing the elementary school, four will get through high school and from the four, two will enter college. Worst, it is still a big question if the two who entered college will land a job or even get a degree. 
<br /><br />Supporting more to that, it was also revealed that half of the country’s youth population is not even in school. Among over 40 million youth in the archipelago, it is said that only 20 million are in school and that most of the out of school youth are either working with very low wages or are into drugs or prostitution. Meanwhile, some of the youth may have fortunately afforded the high cost of education, but at the same time, they are also badly savoring its declining quality. Others may have earned a degree but after, it was found out that most of the graduates are working in fields that are not related to their course.
<br /><br />It is already a very sad reality. But there is a reality more saddening than that. Back to the things that had transpired in our interview months ago with the less fortunate children, most of them chorused that they dreamed to be educated someday. 
<br /><br />Jenjen, an eight year old girl selling rags on the street, dreamed of becoming a teacher, though she thought her parents are irresponsible and that she’s uncertain if she could even graduate elementary. From school, she would rove around the city, with his brother, to earn from selling rags.
<br /><br />Ronie, an out of school little boy who did not even know his age, who would use the sidewalk as a bed, and who would go rummaging the garbage everyday with his friends, wants to run a business and own establishments like Jollibee and Lee Plaza. Other than that, the little lad also wished that his packs of peanuts will be completely sold everyday.
<br /><br />Angelo, a Grade 2 pupil whose age is already 10, wished to be the president of the Philippine Republic and in fact asked me what course he should take up to become a  president. 
<br /><br />Kokoy, on the other hand, a small and burned-skinned little boy, who earns several pesos from tending vehicles in a certain city parking lot, wanted to become either a priest or a policeman, thinking that he could taste instant richness if he were either of the two.
<br /><br />It was inspiring to see these children being so full of dreams and high hopes despite the hardships life has already offer to them at their tender ages. However, as we asked them how they could achieve their dreams, everything turned out to be a tormented rhapsody as their optimistic faces slowly turned into a frown. They do not know. And as I asked myself how they could, seeing the present education crises, like those innocent children, I neither can tell. While the education crises go deeper each year, it continues to narrow down and steal the bright future of the high-spirited young ones, specially the less fortunate individuals, transforming it into a blurry picture. And if not aided, the future of these children is nothing but a shattered dream. 
<br /><br />Now, I wonder if how many among of those children whom we interviewed could finish elementary level, and could make it in high school. I wonder if there is even one among them who could taste a higher education and who would come along with the vibrant and enthusiastic individuals we see every opening of the school year. 
<br /><br />If someone from them could miraculously finish college, with the present pestering situation that the Philippine education system is currently suffering, I wonder what kind of incompetent education this country could offer.
<br /><br />__________________________
<br /><br />Seeing these crises, I wonder how can the concern people who are supposed to deal with this problem walk with heads up high. Yes, the Arroyo administration may have taken ways and means in the recent years to repair the tragedy suffered by the Philippine education, but with this picture of education system in the country growing deeper each school year; sure, it was never enough. Fundamental problems in access, a high dropout rate, and a very low reading proficiency remained manifesting. How we wished the word ‘education’ is really the main concern of the present administration.
<br />__________________________
<br /><br />May these current crises would serve as a reminder to every student taking up a higher education to value education and strive hard for excellence. We are very much luckier that we have reached this far in our life’s education. Imagine yourself being one of the luckiest two, out of ten youth, who made it to college?
<br /><br />May these would serve as a challenge for us to surface up from the deep sea of educational crises.

I suppose to go home today (because my mom told me I must be there since it’s Saint John The Baptist Day). The whole family will be going out tomorrow, of course to the beach, but I opted not to go home because I have a lot of things to do. 
<br /><br />I really wished I can be there. Unfortunately, as much as I want to, I find it tiring to travel and do things hurriedly thinking that I still have a lot of things to do. Besides, I really hate it spending a little time with my family; feeling ‘bitin’ because of this stupid stuffs in school… Hehe
<br /><br />I’m starting to hate student life!

		<document id="db430c4560893defdf1b8ed5a239f068" url=""><![CDATA[Dropped!<br/><br/>I was really totally dying to get a freelance a job while I am studying. This semester, aside from the fact that I want to be financially independent from my parents (since I made a promise to myself that I would lessen their headaches after my elder sister’s pregnancy), I am already taking up all-major subjects. More than that, although I am currently affiliated to some community magazines and newspapers as a layout artist and a contributor, I really want to have an actual experience on how it feels to be in the authentic field of work. That is why, when one of my instructors prompted me that a certain company (I cannot name it) is looking for a graphics designer who at the same time could write, I rushed in for the last minute compiling my resume and samples. And alas, after a day, I was called for an interview.
<br /><br />In the interview (in which I found it awkward wearing a semi-formal attire when I am applying for a freelance job only), a woman (the interviewer who looks on her middle forties), asked me to tell something about myself, my skills, and my experiences. She started with a question “If you are a product, why must I pick you from the rest?”
<br /><br />I was nervous what to say at first but I was able to catch up. I remember my Effective Speech instructor telling me that in a job interview, I must tell everything so as I would impress the interviewer. Therefore, I started by saying:
<br /><br />“Maam, I am not confident with my grammar all of the time but I can write well. I am currently the associate editor and a columnist as well of our weekly university publication. I, at the same time, am the layout artist.”
<br /><br />“My basic job as an editor is to edit articles submitted by the writers before forwarding it to our editor-in-chief. As of graphics designing and layouting, I am responsible with the overall appearance and page design of the paper. Aside from that, I also published a weekly column.”
<br /><br />She just kept on nodding as I continued…
<br /><br />“I am comfortable both with writing and designing. In fact, I have been a writer and an editor as well of a quarterly published cooperative magazine. I am also a contributor writer in a community paper. Also, I have been the layout artist of various newsletters of public schools and offices (while showing her my samples).”
<br /><br />“I have been into the graphics designing business in the past years (while showing her again my proofs), layouting and designing posters, logos, billboards, tarpaulins, cards, and other designing stuffs of print media.”
<br /><br />“As of other skills, I can also draw. In fact, I have reached regional and national levels for poster making contests (while citing to her my previous experiences).”
<br /><br />“I am a leader too, that is why I can assure you that I am a good follower. I am currently our barangay’s SK Chairman and as well, the manager of a student cooperative in our university.”
<br /><br />She just smiled. Thinking that I impressed her, I still continued.
<br /><br />“I graduated as an elementary valedictorian. In high school, I also made it to the honor roll. I am currently a junior Computer Engineering student…”
<br /><br />“If you will hire me ma’am,   I can assure you that you can entrust projects to a freelancer. More than that, I am also willing to learn some more and to be trained.” (And so on and so forth.)
<br /><br />After that she said I can already go out. After saying “thank you,” she said that she will just call after making some assessment.
<br /><br />Days passed and yesterday, I received her message. In her text message she said, “Junrell, you are too qualified for the job. We don’t hire qualified applicants. We are hiring those who want to be qualified; those who will soon qualify because we trained them… Thank you for your application.”
<br /><br />I was so frustrated with the message. If I only knew that they don’t hire qualified ones, I would have acted that I am willing to learn and that I don’t know much of the job. I was like tormented. 
<br /><br />Moreover, I was pained not because I expected too much to get the job. What pained me was the fact that it was my qualifications who shoo me out from the job. The next time I would be in an interview, I would already buckle what to tell. 
<br /><br />Nah, I don’t what to do. I already stopped hoping of getting a freelance a job… This world is indeed UNFAIR!

It was almost a month ago when we have witnessed them raising their right hand on the air to pledge and formalize their installations as the new set of senators who will be serving the Filipino people. In fact, the reality show assessing if they are indeed good leaders is kicking now.
<br /><br />Perhaps, the common questions now that were in the mind of Filipino people are (for those who care): What can we expect from them? What can they offer to us? Or, is there really something new that we can expect from them? Or, will it be the same old brand new chaotic, controversial, and blah-blahs leadership?
<br /><br />These questions would remain hanging for a long time and can only be answered precisely and exactly at the later part of their term (which is six years). It’s wrong to speculate. For now, what we can do is to wait and watch out while these new set senators make their ways. And perhaps cooperate, if necessary.
<br /><br />Moreover, as a young (<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/unsure.gif" alt=":)" /> Filipino who ‘cares’ and expects a better Philippines, I believe that our senators will be guided in their expedition taking their responsibility if we let them know our own expectations (Impossible but who knows? My idol Chiz Escudero might drop in PAN one day… Hehe). It is already up to them to work for these expectations. This is a democratic country anyway and they always have the choice.
<br /><br />So the new set of senators may know, please allow me to lay my (as well as the others) expectations from them. 
<br /><br />1. As we are all painfully taught, politics in this country is the dirtiest that it can pull down even a leader with the sincerest intention. May they will not allow their selves to be pulled down. Because the moment they get their hands dirty, the blot of the politics would always remain keeping them dirty all their lives.
<br /><br />2. May all of them will move on now for the betterment of the country. Looking back on the past would only keep scratching the seemingly incurable wound of misunderstanding. May they will do that act of heroism for the country. (Fiction<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/unsure.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />3. It may sound already obsolete and is more of a cliché; still we continue to expect an honest, dependable, respectable, and transparent senator. We anticipate them to be reliable, committed, and truthful individuals who are for the people, who would stand for the people, and who are not puppets of anybody. Above all, we look forward to senators who work for the people and not for their own personal intentions and interests.
<br /><br />4. More than that, we expect a senator that would stop the people’s cry, not a senator that would make the people cry. We are looking forward to a senator that materializes projects that can bring benefits to the majority of the Filipinos, not projects benefited from the Filipinos. Furthermore, we expect a panorama of worthwhile programs that would mold the majority of the Filipinos into better ones, not a panorama of money-wasting programs and activities that would only make their stomach bulging.
<br /><br />The new set of senators has the six years to prove that they deserve every vote they got last election. May they fail us not…

I feel like bursting already but I just maintain on holding on my long patience (as if I have) because I know, the moment the volcano would erupt, it could create many aspects of devastation. And devastation means things that are never repairable and reconcilable. As a saying goes, once an egg is broken (from volcano to egg… what a…), no matter how hard you put it up again to become a one whole egg, the fact remains that it is already broken. (So, here I am pulling out my anger here? Not really.)
<br /><br />I understand that I am living in a fishbowl-like world where I have no choice but to blend up with people (as if they look like one) of different principles, beliefs, breeds, and attitudes. I understand that in my day to day existence, I have to mingle with people who are perpendicular to my bring-ups and everything. I deeply comprehend that and in fact, I have tried to adjust and blend (even if I am never a good mixer) with them. However, there are just times that our bring ups would collide and… poof! While I try harder to understand them, the more I become confused why they always believe their actions are always rightfully done.
<br /><br />I am not saying that I am always right as well as I never ever claimed that I am a perfect person. I have also my own share of mistakes and shortcomings (human as I am, OA), but every time I commits one or two or many, I always acknowledge it. In other way, I am always been open-minded with suggestions and criticisms because again, as I was saying, I also commit mistakes. I always consider and welcome other people’s suggestions and views about me because I know my attitudes were never ever perfect; it also leaks at some time; and it also sucks.
<br /><br />I guess that was it. Even if you look at your self everyday in a life-size mirror every minute, you can never tell what you are. It’s not like Snow White’s wicked stepmother who got the mirror on the wall who could tell who is the fairest of all. In the long run, it is the people around you who could greatly tell you how and what you are. But then, as long as you acknowledge your mistakes and try to straighten it, it would make a good sense. But then again, there are just people born in this world hardheaded in the sense that even if a lot of people already hate them for how they acted, they still continue on what they think is right. (And I hate them, bow!) They always claim ‘I am what I am’ but they never ever realized that being on their selves means stepping the egos not just of one person but of many individuals. 
<br /><br />Moreover, (pag-sure oy!) there are really people whose attitude are just too hard to understand, too unbearable to take, and too far-out to adjust with. There are just people born who are subconsciously or unconsciously (whatever is the term) too inconsiderate, demanding, insensitive, boastful and know-it-all. There are just people around me whose attitude sucks the most. (This is not my own view alone but a view of a lot of people who are also affected with these kinds of creatures…) These kinds people are really making me wicked and a villain…
<br /><br />Those people concern are already aware of the increasing number of individuals who were greatly irritated and pestered on their attitudes. But still, they go on displaying their putrid and staled behaviors! 
<br /><br />As for me and as of the moment, I have to keep these GRUDGES, as I was saying, for the sake of not hurting people (tell me if am right). Only, I cannot just promise until when I could hold on my patience. By now, I already imagined myself exchanging blows, creating nosebleeds, and cursing words…

Or would you turn the other cheek? Father, father, father, help us! Send us some guidance from Above… ‘Coz people got me, got me, questioning where is the love? 
<br /><br />Thus, goes the song “Where Is the Love” currently played (it’s not really my choice of music), sung by a foreign-based band, Black Eyed Peas. Setting aside its phenomenal popularity years ago, and even until now, it is probably the best theme song for the recent turn-out of events in the country.
<br /><br />As aired on national televisions and as published in national newspapers, dated July 10, 2007, fourteen Philippine marines where gruesomely killed – ten of whom were beheaded by a reported joint forces of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) guerillas and Abu Sayyaf bandits in Basilan. Nine others were wounded in one of the country’s most shocking military debacles in years. The marines were supposedly returning to their base after a fruitless search for kidnapped Italian priest Gian Carlo Bossi, when they were ambushed, and the ensuing 10-hour battle later turned into carnage.
<br /><br />Looking at the picture alone of the ten beheaded soldiers is already unbearable and shocking that one cannot help but wonder if the people who did these beastly brutalities can actually be called ‘humans.’ This is not the first time that such nerve-wrecking and horrible event stirred the Filipino masses. Terrorism has become one of the country’s biggest problems. In fact, not a day goes by without us seeing, hearing or reading about terrorism.
<br /><br />Branded as an ‘act of barbarism’, it can be recalled that on April of this year, the Abu Sayyaf provoked outrage and disgust from Islamic scholars and ordinary Filipinos when they beheaded seven workers in Jolo. Two of whom were innocent brothers who worked as construction workers just to support their tertiary education.
<br /><br />In 2000, the same group of terrorist mercilessly beheaded two school teachers as a ‘birthday present’ to then President Joseph Estrada. Moreover, on June 2001, the same group had also beheaded Sobero as an ‘Independence Day’ gift to President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo. Sobero was one of the hostages captured together with US missionary couple Martin and Gracia Burnham.
<br /><br />These are few only of the ruthless events that transpired in the past, not to mention the different terrorist-military encounters that killed numerous lives. It is said that sometimes gun battles between the government and the terrorists would go on for days, leaving as many as 40 soldiers and 30 guerillas dead.
<br /><br />Recalling the events, countless of lives have been sacrificed and bloodshed has been offered in the altar of terrorism. 
<br /><br />To whom do we put the blame? To the terrorists for being so ruthless and wicked? Or to the government for teaching the citizens to become rebels? 
<br /><br />I once asked a Muslim friend, who currently studies in a neighboring university, on what makes a terrorist. The question might be broad and he might not be the right person to ask, but somehow he provided me with satisfying answers.
<br /><br />According to him, terrorists are not beasts; they are just like any other people. He explained that just like others, terrorists apply morals in everything they do. Only, what differs them from ordinary people is their willingness to go all lengths just to get what they want and what they believe. My friend added that what they usually fight for are religion, justice, and freedom or independence. These fights, according to him, would lead them into the breaking point of committing horrible crimes such as killing numerous innocent lives. But then, he said, if only terrorists were given what they always wanted, such disgusting and iniquitous event would have been avoided.
<br />My friend continued saying that people hated the terrorists because people are not amendable to the terrorists’ morals. He said that people wouldn’t really think ill of the terrorists if only they knew what terrorists really wanted and understood what the terrorists’ points of view are. He also stressed that terrorism can only be sorted out if everybody would understand the terrorists, instead of instantly incriminating them.
<br /><br />“Sometimes terrorists can be crazy people. On the other hand, they can be called patriots; patriots in a way that they are people who are ready to do anything to defend and to fight for their morals,” he opined.
<br /><br />While I agree on some of my friend’s views, I cannot just turn my back on the beheaded Filipinos in the past, wondering how many other innocent lives will be wasted before this war ends. Let’s say they are forcibly fighting for the right belief, justice, independence, freedom, religion, or for whatever reason they think is right. But, can’t these be achieved without shedding blood and wasting lives?
<br /><br />Perhaps this is the time when love comes in handy. But where is the love?

<br /><br />December 31, 2007)
<br />10:00 a.m.
<br />San Jose Extension, Dumaguete City)
<br /><br />(Pardon me for my grammar… Got no time to edit this carefully…)
<br /><br />In the next few hours, the year figures in the calendars, whether we like it or not, will change. In the next few whiles, the whole planet will be celebrating the opening of a new year, which is, for every human creature, means a brand new start, a refreshing time to change, and a new chapter of one’s book of life. New Year has been always perceived that way and I must admit that as a human being (although I don’t look like one), I am one of those who strongly believed that New Year is a time for a refreshing and brand new start. However though, as I look back, I wonder how I can make a brand new start when I have a lot of old undone sensible business tugged in my back as I am about to hop to the new year. How can I say that the New Year is a brand new start for me when all I got was the old pieces of me which I can never leave behind – old pieces that I wished I could escape from?
<br /><br />Sadly and surely, I’ll be transporting into the New Year with frustrations and pain; with a broken self and a broken heart; with confusions and tangles; and with an extinguished flame of passion, dedication, and will. For sure, that’s what awaits me in the opening of the year. Piteous, distressing, and sad? NO. People should not feel that way to me. They need not to pat my back, express their sympathy, and say sorry. I am used in facing the sad realities of life all by myself, and knowing these facts that the coming year is never a brand new start to me, does not hurt me anymore. Pain is habitually striking me, and it always appeared to me normally in my daily existence. Pain is normal to me and the pain itself had anesthetized me not to feel its presence.
<br /><br />Well, let me make a twist in this manuscript and so much for these senseless emotes. (I’ll just cross the bridge when I get there…) Let me impart some of the thoughts, I learned from people in the year 2007. Most of it are maybe harsh, but let’s face it. It’s the reality…
<br /><br />1. This world is unfair. You don’t always get what you really deserved. There are some people in this world who will immediately disregard your dedications, hardworks, and efforts once you get them disappointed. There are really people who are ungrateful and who would make you feel unfair.
<br /><br />2. In this world, even if you are right, it’s pointless to argue with good debaters. Sometimes, it is better to shut up and keep your reasons within yourself. Afterall, it’s useless to voice out. Some people would really insist that they are correct even if deep inside, you know, you are not wrong.
<br /><br />3. People could easily say that you are wrong when you fail, without thinking that you are doing the same way when you once succeed. Seeing that something failed with what you did, it is just easy for other people to say “What you did was wrong… You could have blah blah blah…” What they failed to see is that, you are just doing the same way you did when you once succeed in doing the thing. The only difference is, you succeeded before and you failed this time. It is maybe like adding insult to the injury when people would react that way during your failures, (when they could have said that during those times when you succeed in doing the things) as if you got all the mistakes and they don’t, but let’s accept it, people like that really exists. And they suck!
<br /><br />4. There are people in this world who would insult you and who would accuse you by action, if not verbally, of doing things that you never did. Without thinking, it so easy for some people to question and accuse other people. Fore me, it is the greatest insult of man’s life being accused of doing things he never did. But we must be open to this reality; such people exist in this planet.
<br /><br />5. Some people are only concern of their ideas, of what they feel, and of what they wanted, without thinking others. There are really people in this planet who would never respect what you feel, as if they can’t feel such, and as if they don’t do such. Some people are too demanding to say “I don’t want you to blah blah, when I blah blah…” without thinking that they are only concerned of what they wanted --- and without considering that you don’t want it. To sum it all, some people are too greedy and insensitive…
<br /><br />7. Don’t dedicate yourself so much to a thing. Why? For once you get what you don’t deserve, the hurting and pain is forever.
<br /><br />8. It’s nicer to be in hell and be carefree, than be in heaven and be pained. (Don’t interpret this literally.)
<br /><br />9.  Some people would say “explain...” but the fact is: they don’t really need it for they are already done judging you before your explanations. Explanations are actually useless to some people.
<br /><br />10. And many more that I wish I could write every thought I have in mind…
<br /><br />Harsh? That’s the fact… Well, let me again make another twist in this writing… hehe…(F.U.) Let me share this simple thoughts how to begin a New Year (if these are applicable to you…):
<br /><br />Free your heart from hatred. Free your mind from worries. Live simply. Expect less. Give more. Thank God for the pains and blessings… Happy New Year!

<br /><br />We supposed to have a recording that night on our originally-composed songs but everything ended up to nothing. We supposed to materialize our long-planned music video but unfortunately, we achieved nothing. Well, it is maybe because everyone was tired that night. I myself was tired too that I opted to sleep instead of nagging them to start what we planned. But that night was not a total failure after all. We were able to write a song with the contributed lyrics. We call this “The Senseless Hatred Song”… (and the chords by the way, is still under construction)…
<br /><br />The Senseless Hatred Song
<br />(as in, teamwork au ang lyrics ani kay walay sense ang song, walay rhymes, walay thought, and walay tone. Puro ra ni “yawyaw u…”
<br /><br />I.          Get out of my life
<br />            Your existence is haunting me
<br />            It causes me sleepless nights
<br />            It causes me nightmares
<br /><br />II.         Get out of my life
<br />            I need no more pain
<br />            You tear my heart into pieces
<br />            I want you out of my life
<br /><br />Chorus:
<br /><br />I’m done with
<br />            It’s over now
<br />            Let’s stop this stupidity
<br />            I’ve had enough of you
<br />            Get out of my life now
<br />            Because I want someone new
<br />            I’ve had enough of your deceptions
<br />            Leave now with you cruel intentions
<br />            Dare not fool me with your lying eyes
<br />            ‘Cause you are now nothing to me
<br /><br />III.       My door is now shut for you
<br />            Windows are now open for someone new
<br />            With you I tasted bitter life
<br />            This will be the end as I start to live again…
<br /><br />(That’s all. Kaya nga ‘senseless’ eh…)
<br />Prev: A toast for the New Year!

<br /><br />Certain people have a way of saying things that shake us at the core. Even when the words do not seem harsh or offensive, the impact is shattering. What we could be experiencing is the intent behind the words. When we intend to do good, we do. When we intend to do harm, it happens. What each of us must come to realize is that our intent always comes through. We cannot sugarcoat the feelings in our heart of hearts. The emotion is the energy that motivates. We cannot ignore what we really want to create. We should be honest and do it the way we feel it. What we owe to ourselves and everyone around is to examine the reasons of our true intent.
<br /><br />My intent will be evident in the results. After all, he who wants the roses must value the thorns…
<br />______________
<br /><br />When I chose to be silent; when I chose to keep my mouth shut and ignore people after a misunderstanding; when I move on a distance after getting hurt--- it does not mean that I hold a grudge, nor treat anybody as a mortal enemy. I only have one reason for doing that. Yes, I did that because I was hurt but the good thing for doing that is, at the same time, I AM ALSO HEALING and FORGETTING.
<br />But sometimes, it makes me wonder why when just as I am already shutting up, healing, and forgetting, some people would still keep on digging the issue. More than that, what I wonder most is why my name has to be included when I AM ALREADY OUT OF IT. 
<br />I don’t understand it now…

The event, as part of the Siquijorian tradition, would mean a big gathering filled with unlimited food and drinks to commemorate and remember the person who passed away. So, why I am here? I supposed to be at home now. Well, as much as I would like to be there, I cannot. I have so many personal reasons that barred me from coming home and made me skip from that important family gathering. Anyway, I am sure that Lola would tolerate me this time and understand my raison d'être. Besides, I believe that I can still reach out to her and pray for her soul even if I am away from home.
<br /><br />It’s been one year already since Lola passed on (I WOULD PREFER TO SAY ‘PASSED ON’ THAN ‘PASSED AWAY). And since the day she left, a lot has already changed. A lot of things had happened and would have been prevented if Lola is just around to render guidance. A lot of blessings came and Lola would have been enjoying it with us if she is just around. Lola has already missed a lot of issues and events in the family, as everyone, for sure, had missed her.
<br /><br />Growing up with Lola in my side--- disciplining me in every mistake I committed; congratulating me in every good thing I achieved; laughing with me in my success; leaning a shoulder during my pressing times; and supporting in every step I take --- I still shed tears every time I think about her. It sounds overacting but believe me, one year is not enough to recover from Lola’s death. Every time her memories would hit my psyche, I would always think where and how she is now. I would always wish that wherever she is, she will be okay.
<br /><br />More than that, I always wish that she is watching over me --- and hit me hard so that I will be awake from my stupidities; and wipe the tears of my depressions and frustrations.
<br /><br />I love you Lola and you will live forever in Dodong’s heart…

I don’t really know how to exactly define it but while I put my things on the boxes and swept those tons of dusts (I hope you can imagine how messy our room is), it made me realized that everything is really uncertain and unexpected in a person’s life. I mean, when the four of us arrived in that rectangular four-cornered room, we never imagined that our stay would end up as what it is now. I grasped that life is really unpredictable and that imagining the future is useless because afterall, we never hold the last say of how it will really be.
<br /><br />When we entered the gates of RoSan Homes, we were full of high hopes and dreams of a positive future. Although I can only count the nights that I spent sleeping on my boarding house’s bed (because most of my night times were spent with the university publication’s editing and layouting overnights, or if not sleeping somewhere for a cause), I can really say that I was able to live a normal and healthy boarders’ life. And if I can consider my stay there as a normal one, then how much more are theirs…
<br /><br />They do most of their personal stuffs there --- cooking, eating, hanging out, drinking, etcetera. They broke rules and apologized. They did stupid things and regretted… They studied; talked a lot; fooled some more, name it. Everything was normal for them and as well for me. Until life has its twists and turns that sprouted at an expected time--- twists and turns that are avoidable and unavoidable.
<br /><br />Kuya Jesryl first left after he decided to transfer into another school due to his failed engineering subjects. (As an engineering student myself, I understand why he failed as I also committed the same failure.) I could attest that he failed not because he neglected his studies and as a matter of fact, he was able to spend countless late nights burning eyebrows. I just can’t figure it out or give precise explanation why he failed but I am sure that it is because of the thing they call “bad fate.” Everything was unplanned and Kuya Jes had no choice but to move out and transfer to another school in the second semester--- to seek for a better fate, perhaps. And so, he exited.
<br /><br />After a month, Kuya Mitchum followed after he decided to quit from his studies to escape from the trouble caused by his reckless actions. To precisely illustrate it, Kuya Mitch contemplated to leave our boarding house because he was afraid to be killed by his girlfriend’s father who was furiously hunting him. It sounds like a joke but it was really true. There is much to be told about it but to make it short, Kuya Mitch stopped studying because of that matter. He went to his hometown and hide. He is really willing to finish the school year but because of fear, he decided to give up his studies and save his life.
<br /><br />Four minus two equals two as Kuya Eziel and I were the boarders left in that room. Everything ran smoothly for the two of us until a woman whom he introduced as his wife came visiting to our room from time to time. At first, I tolerated the thing because I understand that they are couples and that it is normal. But the visits turned into a several-day-stay and her presence turned into a nuisance. Let us illustrate it this way. My moves were limited when she is around and I feel like the atmosphere is very uneasy. Imagine sharing a room with an overacting and uneducated woman. Imagine sharing a room with a couple who will never respect even just for delicadeza’s sake. I cannot freely change my clothes. My privacy was invaded (OA). And most of all, they do their sexual acts right at my front.
<br /><br />Being a person raised with proper values, it pissed me off knowing that they never respected me. At some point also, I realized that what they were doing is already intolerable considering that there are innocent lady boarders who reside in the other room of the boarding house. At some time, I decided to confront them but my ‘peaceful-effect’ attitude would always stop me from doing so. And so, I ended going out in the room when they are around.
<br /><br />With the couple’s actions, I am not only one who was pissed off with it but the entire house. Time passed. The school year ended and Kuya Eziel exited the house bringing his arrogance and hardheadedness. He brought with him his wrong belief that he was right with his actions. He disrespected a lot of people and it is saddeing to know that he will be always remember as that and he can never be permitted to stay in the house again (He deserves it anyway so let it be)…
<br /><br />Time indeed had fled too fast and here I am alone in the room. My past roommates have left me this realization that everything is really uncertain in this life. But of course, you can always do something about it…
<br /><br />Kuya Jes made me realized that failures are not ends. I can still vividly remember the note he left me before he left the house. He said that someday, each of us could find its own perfect place in this world. It sounded like I joke in that note but it’s true. It enables me to see that if a way does not work, then surely, there could be another way. And I guess that is what he is doing right now.
<br /><br />Kuya Mitch on the other hand, made me realized that I should be careful in whatever step I take. One reckless action could destroy everything. As of the moment, he is suffering the consequence of his being irresponsible. Hopefully, he could straighten that.
<br /><br />For Kuya Eziel, unsa ba? Wala dagway… Haha… Bitaw, I realized that I must not put too much arrogance in my head because its impact to the environment is obviously bad. I don’t want to be remembered as a person who is full of arrogance. I want to be remembered as a person leaving good-sounding footprints. Aw… Kadto ra… And siguro, Kuya Eziel being remembered as a proud, arrogant and hardheaded person is already a heavy consequence for what he did. But as what I’ve said, he deserves it so let it be… Hehe…
<br /><br />So much for these. I have to take a bath now. My life in this room continues and I must be  always grateful that I found a home away from my real home...

<br /><br />Di na ako dapat magpaligoy-ligoy pa.  I know it would be so unfair for others specially to the people whom I considered my family if I will leave things hanging. Okay. I AM STAYING. (I just don’t know if this is for good or what<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/unsure.gif" alt=":)" />. I am staying for so many reasons that I wish I could tackle here one by one. But to sum it all, I am staying because a lot of people want me to stay and because a lot of people said that it would be better if I will stay. Although I still doubt if I am really doing this for my own good, there is only one thing that I am pretty sure about this: I am doing this for the people whom I considered important to my life.
<br /><br />This is another decision in which I am not sure yet if I would be regretting this in the end. In the past, I wasted several opportunities and let it pass even if it is already within a grab by my hand. Definitely this time, I will be wasting again another opportunity - an opportunity which I am not sure if it will knock me again the moment I am already prepared to embrace it. I must admit that a part of me feels sayang about it but whatever I am feeling right now, it will not affect my decision. It is already fixed, and whether I have a choice or not, I will stay. I will do this for the people I love.
<br /><br />I can maybe say that I already did so many things for other people in the past and that, it is time now to do something for myself and find my own way, but I guess, this is again another point of my life wherein I will set aside my journey of finding my real self for the sake of other people. I see them deserving anyway, so let it be. I just hooked on the idea that staying is my another try to find the light of my journey in this dark tunnel.
<br /><br />Yes. What I am doing now is clinging to the idea that this is again another 'trial and error' for me to light back the glow of my stars that died a long time ago. But, am I not tired of trying? Of course I am. It’s been four years already since that stars refused to glow, letting me walk unguided in the dark wilderness. It’s been four years already since I stumbled and was left broken and rummaging my broken pieces in the darkness. In the past years, I have been trying so hard to  stand, dissipate the black clouds that steal the stars’ glow and I even try to fix and put back my broken pieces even if everything is a total darkness. I made so many ‘tries’ in the past and I failed, and apparently, I will be trying again this time. Sure, I am already tired of trying but with the defense that “I am again trying” at least, I can still say that I am doing something for myself and not just for other people.
<br /><br />Leaving and rejecting the idea of ‘staying’ is supposed to be my other way for to get out from this dark tunnel. It is supposed to be a reroute to follow the scheme that “if plan A isn’t working, then proceed to plan B.” But I guess, this time, I will prefer gain the idea that I must “try and try, until I succeed.” Or try and try until I die… I just have to do this ‘try’ again for other people.
<br /><br />I’ve been like this almost every year, opting to ‘try’ again and again. I’ve been like this every year, choosing to follow this path and chasing the little light. I’ve been like this every year, listening to people and doing this for them.  I’ve been like this every year, turning down other opportunities which could have been an avenue for me to find my right way. And this time, I am doing this again. And I guess, I just have to.
<br /><br />I can’t just turn my back to other people and to their suggestions. Yes, those opportunities might lead me to the right way of finding my perfect place in this world, but what if it will not lead me back to the arms of the people I love. I WILL STAY. And if you’ll ask me why? I am doing this for Mama who said that I am still young to work abroad; that to see us, their children, finishing our studies is Papa’s ultimate dream that he has been working so hard when he was still alive;  and that after Papa’s sudden death, she can’t afford to see another loved one parting far from her. I am doing this because Lola said this time is not the right time for me to leave. I am doing this because MyWifey said as the oldest son in the family, I must not turn my back to my family at these moments that they needed me most.  I am doing this because my friends said that I must stay for others’ good. ETCETERA…
<br /><br />It’s final. I will reject that opportunity. I will stay. I will pursue my study. I will try this way again.
