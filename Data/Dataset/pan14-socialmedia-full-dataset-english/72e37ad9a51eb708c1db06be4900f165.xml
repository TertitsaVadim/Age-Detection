Inside the ensuing years, though, shoe companies began to increase the amount of cushioning on their products. Many researchers believed then (and a lot of still do) that runners needed cushioning, both in the forefoot and particularly the heel, to absorb the shock through the road. But because the cushioning lifts the heel off the floor, additional hardware?asuch as medial posts and plastic shanks?awere added to the midsole to supply stability and counter the end results of overpronation (the twisting that occurs when your ankle rolls too far inward). The result: the development of so-called stability and motion-control shoes, whose features show up in such popular models as Asics's 13-ounce Gel-Kayano and New Balance's 15-ounce 1012. &quot;For earlier times 3 decades, it's been bulk, bulk, bulk,&quot; says Ned Frederick, Ph.D., a biomechanics consultant for shoe companies. &quot;People added more cushioning because we were competing for that soft ride that everybody was after.&quot;<br /><br />But like hemlines, pocket handkerchiefs, and pleated pants, it seems like running shoes?aboth in fashion and substance?aare subject to consumers' changing demands. Fueled to some extent with the FiveFingers phenomenon, many shoe makers have started to engineer minimalist models with new low-to-the-ground designs and ultralight materials that still provide cushioning while increasing flexibility (see &quot;The Lowdown,&quot; page 80). Some new shoes have heel heights of just eight millimeters, in comparison with, say, the 38 millimeters of the Brooks Beast, a well known motion-control shoe. Plus much more light, pliable, and lower-heeled footwear is coming. &quot;Watch how minimal goes to endless weeks of frustration brands in 2011,&quot; says Marshall Cohen, chief industry analyst to the NDP Group, an industry research firm. &quot;We're investigating point-of-sale data in the stores. In mid-2010, it had been around two percent of sales for all those athletic shoes. By next year, it can be double digit.&quot; (Still, while any shakeup in the $5 billion running-shoe marketplace is news, the size of the &quot;minimalist shoe&quot; market is fairly small, at most Ten percent of athletic shoes, based on Matt Powell, an analyst with SportsOneSource.<br /><br />What could be <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5teS1qb3JkYW5zLWNoZWFwLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"><strong>buy cheap jordans</strong></a> more resounding than revenue, though, may be the role the sneakers can play in aiding defuse the perception that running-shoe makers sell only overbuilt, overcushioned footwear. &quot;If you're making money from the puffy running shoe, as well as an unexpected people are saying the product is probably not healthy for you, you must address that,&quot; says Greg Dutter, editorial director with the trade magazine Footwear Plus.Yet after dark bandwagon marketing of the current minimal trend, companies continue to invest a whole lot into researching what runners do need. Often, their research requires cushioning. Now, with the rage in lightweight shoes for us, the question becomes, how low would you go?<br /><br />Perhaps it is often years because you last ran barefoot?amaybe you had been chasing your kid down the beach or your canine in a very grassy field following a summer picnic.
