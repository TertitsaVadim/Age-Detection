His are the gems that lie deep in the Earth and the gold that is fair in the hand, no less than the walls of the mountains and the basins of the sea. The Noldor learned most of him, and he was ever their friend.&lt;/p&gt;
<br />&lt;p&gt;Melkor was jealous of him, for Aul? was most like himself in thought and in powers; and there was long strife between them, in which Melkor ever marred or undid the works of Aul?, and Aul? grew weary in repairing the tumults and disorders of Melkor. Both, also, desired to make things of their own that should be new and unthought of by others, and delighted in the praise of their skill.&lt;/p&gt;

There are indications in a fragmentary legend of Georgius son of Giles.&lt;/p&gt;
<br />&lt;p&gt;His page Suovetaurilius (Suet) that at one time an outpost against the Middle Kingdom was maintained at Farthingho. But that situation does not concern this story, which is now presented without alteration or further comment,though the original grandiose title has bear suitably reduced to Farmer Giles of Ham.&lt;/p&gt;

There are indications in a fragmentary legend of Georgius son of Giles.&lt;/p&gt;
<br />&lt;p&gt;His page Suovetaurilius (Suet) that at one time an outpost against the Middle Kingdom was maintained at Farthingho. But that situation does not concern this story, which is now presented without alteration or further comment,though the original grandiose title has bear suitably reduced to Farmer Giles of Ham.&lt;/p&gt;

<br />&lt;p&gt;His feet were still far below, making holes in the fields.The moon dazzled the giant and he did not see the farmer;but Farmer Giles saw him and was scared out of his wits: He pulled the trigger without thinking, and the blunderbuss went off with a staggering bang. By luck it was pointed more or less at the giant's large ugly face.&lt;/p&gt;

<br />&lt;p&gt;Some were now running up the hill shouting.The villagers had heard the horrible thump-thump of the giant's feet, and most of them had immediately got under the bed-clothes; some had got under the beds.But Garm was both proud and frightened of his master.He thought him terrible and splendid, when he was angry; and he naturally thought that any giant would think the same.&lt;/p&gt;

<br />&lt;p&gt;And what may that amount to?The characters are archaic and the language barbaric,said the parson, to gain time.A little closer inspection will be required.He begged the loan of the sword for the night, and the farmer let him have it with pleasure.Well, I can't start today, and that's a fact,said he.I've a lot on hand with my cowman sick and all.&lt;/p&gt;

Some accounts made him the mater-nal great-great-grandfather of the King.The songs and tales of his deeds were many, and if forgotten at court,were still remembered in the villages.&lt;/p&gt;
<br />&lt;p&gt;This sword,' said the parson, will not stay sheathed, if a dragon is within five miles; and without doubt in a brave man's hands no dragon can resist it.Then people began to take heart again; and some un-shuttered the windows and put their heads out.In the end the parson persuaded a few to come and join him; but only the miller was really willing.&lt;/p&gt;

<br />&lt;p&gt;He never whistled at his work, unless some disaster (such as frost in May) had duly occurred after he had foretold it.Since he was daily foretelling disasters of every kind, few happened that he had not foretold, and he was able to take the credit of them.It was his chief pleasure; so naturally he was reluctant to do anything to avert them.&lt;/p&gt;

<br />&lt;p&gt;But the King wanted money.He took leave of his loyal subjects,but he was short and sharp about it;and he cancelled half the tallies on the Exchequer. He was quite cold to Farmer Giles and dismissed him with a nod.The more hopeful and simple-minded thought that a message would soon come from the court to summon master Aegidius to the King, to be knighted at the least.&lt;/p&gt;
