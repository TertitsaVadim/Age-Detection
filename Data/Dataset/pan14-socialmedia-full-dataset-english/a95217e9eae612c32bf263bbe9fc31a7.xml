<br /><br />i volunteered as a PPCRV/NAMFREL pollwatcher for the 2007 national and local elections. i wanted to be really involved in this crucial event. i know how important the elections are and i never want to simply vote, i want to be part of the counting as well.
<br /><br />i expected things to be hard.. and yes, they are.. 
<br /><br />i woke up at 530 in the morning and prepared myself for a long tiring day, i know it's going to be a tough job but i guess i'm ready for it. in fact, i was excited. 
<br /><br />i don't need to give a detailed account of what happened during the day.. i just have to say a few things.. 
<br /><br />i came to realize the following:
<br /><br />it's hard to be a volunteer. aside from the fact that we don't get anything but 'thank you', we also have to wait for hours before we could eat our sponsored meals. good thing i live near the polling place so i was able to go home and get some 'panawid-gutom' food while waiting for our lunch. but i'm fine with it. let's say i've expected it already. i don't really have a problem with that. 
<br /><br />yes, we were tired.. who wouldn't be? but physical stress is much better than mental and emotional stress and i prefer it over the other two.. 
<br /><br />you might be wondering where this post is headed.. i'm sorry, i can't seem to find a good way of putting things together, of keeping my thoughts organized. i don't know where to start and where should i end..
<br /><br />this could be the effect of the three consecutive days that i've forgotten the meaning of 'sleep'.. my mind is thinking a lot but the words aren't coming out right.
<br /><br />but still, let me try.. 
<br /><br />i really don't have that much to say.. i'm just a bit disappointed with the outcome of the local election. and i'm talking of Pasig alone. 
<br /><br />forgive me if i may sound a bit emotional, let's just say that i am among the few concerned citizens.. i mean, those who are TRULY concerned. 
<br /><br />i'm not a loyalist of whoever but i am a lover of development, real action, pure service, and genuine care. 
<br /><br />i respect the opinion of others and i don't have any negative intention in writing this blog entry. 
<br /><br />i'm just worried. what will happen to the country if people would vote just for the sake of voting? 
<br /><br />unfortunately, i can't say that those who participated in yesterday's elections were responsible.. 
<br /><br />sorry but i mean it.
<br /><br />when people are asked why did they vote for that candidate, they would say 'for a change'. when asked what changes are needed, they would say 'a lot' but they can't even say just one concrete answer. 
<br /><br />my point here is that, why vote when you don't even know why you're voting? 
<br /><br />nakakalungkot isiping hindi man lang maipagtanggol ng tao ang desisyon nya, well, that's if decision niya talaga yun at hindi dulot lang ng impluwensya ng ibang tao.
<br /><br />ask me why i voted for him.. and i'll ask you 'why not?'
<br /><br />as a Pasigueño, i am a witness to the many struggles of this city.. and i have seen how, through their initiative, this town has progressed through the years.. 
<br /><br />dito ako lumaki, dito ako nag-aral, at ngayon dito rin ako nagtatrabaho. salamat sa pinagandang ortigas center, kung saan matatagpuan ang chikka at ang iba pang malalaking IT companies.
<br /><br />i can't stop the tears from falling.. i know they're falling because i am hurting.. i am really disappointed.
<br /><br />i've never been this affected with the results of the elections.
<br />maybe because i'm a first time voter and i've witnessed how people took for granted what seemed so important to me..
<br /><br />i kept on asking 'why'..
<br /><br />ano pa bang kulang ha? anong pagbabago ang gusto niyo?
<br />hindi ba kayo kuntento sa kung anong meron tayo ngayon?
<br />oo, kurakot sila.. pero sino bang hindi?
<br /><br />what is important is that you give to the people the services that they need.. hindi ba nangyayari yun sa pasig? siguro nga may pagkukulang sa pasig city general hospital, pero hindi dahil hindi ka naasikaso ng nurse at doctor dun e magagalit ka na sa mayor o sa vice-mayor o sa kung sino mang tao.. 
<br /><br />they don't deserve the blame. hindi naman nila hawak ang isip ng mga empleyado nila. and mind you, every hospital has its own admin.. wag nyong isisi lahat sa local government..
<br /><br />i don't want to sound like pinagtatanggol ko sila.. pero kasi naranasan ko rin naman yun..
<br /><br />i was rushed to the pasig city general hospital because my tummy hurts like hell.. when we got there, i started to vomit.. at sabi nga ni mama, namumutla na raw ako.. sobrang weak na ako nung time na 'yun.. 
<br /><br />pero yung nurse na tumingin sken, wala pa ring ginagawa aside from getting some useless information about me.. she even said that i might be pregnant which really made my father mad.. 
<br /><br />imagine that: a father seeing her daughter suffer because of ulcer and you would tell him about the possibility of the girl being pregnant? and i was just 19 then.. 
<br /><br />my father was so furious.. muntik na niyang masuntok yung nurse, babae pa man din.. 
<br /><br />they decided to transfer me to a private mini-hospital where i was confined for two days.. 
<br /><br />that incident was more than enough reason for us to hate the admin of that hospital but it didn't mean we have to hate the city council as well.. 
<br /><br />it's not their fault.. you could say that they must have hired better people, but c'mon, even the best companies have not that competitive employees.. i mean, it's normal.. sa family nga lang, may tinatawag na black sheep di ba? it's the same thing..
<br /><br />but the thing is, man by nature, as they say (but i don't agree), easily forgets your 10 good deeds the moment you've done at least 1 negative action, no matter how simple or how serious that action is.. and another thing, people believe allegations most of the time.. they are never fair.. 
<br /><br />bakit nga ba ganun daw ang tao? does that mean hindi ako tao? 
<br /><br />good heavens naman! why judge someone because of one wrong move or worse, one bad allegation? 
<br /><br />'for a change..'
<br />err, hindi ko na alam kung ano pang sasabihin ko para lang ipaintindi sa tao na hindi lahat ng bago ay maganda at hindi lahat ng luma ay bulok na..
<br /><br />corrupt daw.. pero ano na bang nagagawa niya? kaya nyo pa bang bilangin kung ilang schools na ang naipatayo? ilang magulang at estudyante na ang natulungan? 
<br /><br />here i go again.. hindi ko talaga mapigilang mapaiyak.. nahihiya ako sa nagiging takbo ng bilangan.. sa mga lumalabas na partial results..
<br /><br />is this what he deserves? i don't think so.. 
<br /><br />err, i can't continue anymore.. i'm getting too emotional.. baka makita na ako ng boss ko na umiiyak..
<br /><br />hindi pa tapos ang bilangan.. the battle's not over yet pero sa lahat ng bumoto sa taong nangangako ng pagbabago, sana lang hindi kayo nagkamali sa decision niyo..
<br /><br />parang relationship yun e.. sawa ka na sa partner mo kasi you've been together for so long already.. alam mo na lahat sa kanya, wala na kayong maitatago sa isa't isa.. and then someone comes.. he/she promises to add flavor to your life.. dahil sa bored ka na, papatulan mo naman, iiwanan ang dati mong partner para itry kung anong pwedeng ioffer ng bagong kakilala.. kaso lang, short time happiness and satisfaction lang pala talaga ang gusto niya at kaya niyang ibigay.. pa'no na? hanap uli ng iba?
<br /><br />the problem with us is this: we are never contented.. we always ask for more.. 
<br /><br />i'm still hopeful na mananalo kung sino yung dapat.. 
<br />marami pa akong gustong sabihin but my heart can longer stand the pain..
<br /><br />i'm afraid i have to end it here.. 
<br /><br />i have to heal myself first..

<br /><br />and what i got for today was some dose of real romantic, heartwarming and touching songs from 'the fray'.. yes, i'm addicted to them now.. good thing i was able to recover from my 'your love' sickness.. and i am now addicted to a new flavor, 'the fray' songs.. 
<br /><br />however, i'm not that fortunate to hear the songs because we don't have speakers here, you know, we're just interns.. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/mellow.gif" alt=":)" /> but browsing through the lyrics is really good enough.. 
<br /><br />i swear, i felt love again.. and it feels so right.. i just content myself with daydreaming.. hearing him singing those wonderful songs to me.. oh God, nothing could be much sweeter than that.. 
<br /><br />oops, before posting the lyrics, i just want to share this bulletin post.. read on.. i swear, i agree to everything that's written.. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/mellow.gif" alt=":)" />

<br /><br />err, naiiyak na naman ako.. bakit ba? ano bang problema mo unaiza?! hay.. i wanna go home.. and lock myself in my room.. i'm trying to be ok but i can't.. c'mon girl, what's wrong? 
<br /><br />hay.. ganito ata talaga pag stressed ka physically, mentally, and emotionally.. good thing i'm not having problems with my spiritual life.. anyway.. here are the lyrics.. for real..
<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<br />ALL AT ONCE
<br /><br />There are certain people you just keep coming back to
<br />She is right in front of you
<br />You begin to wonder could you find a better one
<br />Compared to her now she's in question
<br /><br />And all at once the crowd begins to sing
<br />Sometimes the hardest thing and the right thing are the same
<br /><br />Maybe you want her maybe you need her
<br />Maybe you started to compare to someone not there
<br /><br />Looking for the right one you line up the world to find
<br />Where no questions cross your mind
<br />But she won't keep on waiting for you without a doubt
<br />Much longer for you to sort it out
<br /><br />And all at once the crowd begins to sing
<br />Sometimes the hardest thing and the right thing are the same
<br /><br />Maybe you want her maybe you need her
<br />Maybe you started to compare to someone not there
<br />Maybe you want it maybe you need it,
<br />Maybe it's all you're running from,
<br />Perfection will not come
<br /><br />And all at once the crowd begins to sing
<br />Sometimes
<br />We'd never know what's wrong without the pain
<br />Sometimes the hardest thing and the right thing are the same
<br /><br />Maybe you want her maybe you need her
<br />Maybe you've started to compare to someone not there
<br />Maybe you want it maybe you need it
<br />Maybe it's all you're running from
<br />Perfection will not come
<br /><br />Maybe you want her maybe you need her
<br />Maybe you had her maybe you lost her to another
<br />To another
<br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<br />HEAVEN FORBID (i really like this one.. i mean really..)
<br /><br />Twenty years it's breaking you down, now that you understand there's no one around.
<br />Take a breath, just take a seat, you're falling apart and tearing at the seams.
<br /><br />Heaven forbid you end up alone and don't know why
<br />Hold on tight wait for tomorrow, you'll be alright
<br /><br />It's on your face, is it on your mind, would you care to build a house of your own.
<br />How much longer, how long can you wait, It's like you wanted to go and give yourself away.
<br /><br />Heaven forbid you end up alone and don't know why
<br />Hold on tight wait for tomorrow, you'll be alright
<br /><br />It feels good. Is that reason enough for you.
<br />It feels good. Is that reason enough for you.
<br /><br />Heaven forbid you end up alone and don't know why
<br />Hold on tight wait for tomorrow, you'll be alright
<br />Heaven forbid you end up alone and don't know why
<br />Hold on tight wait for tomorrow, you'll be alright
<br /><br />Out of this one
<br />Don't know how to get you out of this one, don't know how to get you out of this one,
<br />Don't know how to get you out of this one, don't know how to get you out of this one
<br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<br />HUNDRED (for some reason, this song hits me too..)
<br /><br />The how I can't recall
<br />But I'm staring at what once was the wall
<br />Separating east and west
<br />Now they meet amidst the broad daylight
<br /><br />So this is where you are, and this is where I am
<br />Somewhere between unsure and a hundred
<br /><br />It's hard I must confess
<br />I'm banking on the rest to clear away
<br />Cause we have spoken everything
<br />Everything short of I love you
<br /><br />You right where you are, from right where I am
<br />Somewhere between unsure and a hundred
<br /><br />And who's to say it's wrong
<br />And who's to say that it's not right
<br />Where we should be for now
<br /><br />So this is where you are, and this is where I am
<br />So this is where you are, and this is where I've been
<br />Somewhere between unsure and a hundred
<br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<br />LOOK AFTER YOU (this is really beautiful)
<br /><br />If I don't say this now I will surely break
<br />As I'm leaving the one I want to take
<br />Forgive the urgency but hurry up and wait
<br />My heart has started to separate
<br /><br />Oh, oh,
<br />Be my baby
<br />Ohhhhh
<br />Oh, oh
<br />Be my baby
<br />I'll look after you
<br /><br />There now, steady love, so few come and don't go
<br />Will you, won't you, be the one I'll always know
<br />When I'm losing my control, the city spins around
<br />You're the only one who knows, you slow it down
<br /><br />Oh, oh
<br />Be my baby
<br />Ohhhhhh
<br />Oh, oh
<br />Be my Baby
<br />I'll look after you
<br />And I'll look after you
<br /><br />If ever there was a doubt
<br />My love she leans into me
<br />This most assuredly counts
<br />She says most assuredly
<br /><br />Oh, oh
<br />Be my baby
<br />I'll look after you
<br />After You
<br />Oh, oh
<br />Be my baby
<br />Ohhhhh
<br /><br />It's always have and never hold
<br />You've begun to feel like home
<br />What's mine is yours to leave or take
<br />What's mine is yours to make your own
<br /><br />Oh, oh
<br />Be my baby
<br />Ohhhhh
<br />Oh, oh
<br />Be my baby
<br />I'll look after you
<br /><br />You are so beautiful to me
<br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<br />next time na lang yung iba.. it's already 6 and i'm dying to go home.. i swear..

<br /><br />BAD DAY
<br /><br />Where is the moment we needed the most
<br />You kick up the leaves and the magic is lost
<br />They tell me your blue skies fade to gray
<br />They tell me your passion's gone away
<br />And I don't need no carryin' on
<br /><br />You stand in the line just to hit a new low
<br />You're faking a smile with the coffee you go
<br />You tell me your life's been way off line
<br />You're falling to pieces every time
<br />And I don't need no carryin' on
<br /><br />Because you had a bad day
<br />You're taking one down
<br />You sing a sad song just to turn it around
<br />You say you don't know
<br />You tell me don't lie
<br />You work at a smile and you go for a ride
<br />You had a bad day
<br />The camera don't lie
<br />You're coming back down and you really don't mind
<br />You had a bad day
<br />You had a bad day
<br /><br />Will you need a blue sky holiday?
<br />The point is they laugh at what you say
<br />And I don't need no carryin' on
<br /><br />You had a bad day
<br />You're taking one down
<br />You sing a sad song just to turn it around
<br />You say you don't know
<br />You tell me don't lie
<br />You work at a smile and you go for a ride
<br />You had a bad day
<br />The camera don't lie
<br />You're coming back down and you really don't mind
<br />You had a bad day
<br /><br />(Oooh.. a holiday..)
<br /><br />Sometimes the system goes on the blink
<br />And the whole thing turns out wrong
<br />You might not make it back and you know
<br />That you could be well oh that strong
<br />And I'm not wrong
<br /><br />(yeah...)
<br /><br />So where is the passion when you need it the most
<br />Oh you and I
<br />You kick up the leaves and the magic is lost
<br /><br />Cause you had a bad day
<br />You're taking one down
<br />You sing a sad song just to turn it around
<br />You say you don't know
<br />You tell me don't lie
<br />You work at a smile and you go for a ride
<br />You had a bad day
<br />You've seen what you like
<br />And how does it feel for one more time
<br />You had a bad day
<br />You had a bad day
<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<br /><br />TICKLE TEST RESULT: WHAT's BEHIND YOUR EMOTION
<br /><br />Your strongest belief is honesty. 48% of test takers also hold honesty as an important value in life.
<br /><br />Because of your uncompromisingly honest nature, you generally feel most fulfilled when you can fully share your thoughts and feelings, good or bad.
<br /><br />People likely come to you when they need a forthright opinion because they know you are brave enough to tell your version of the truth, and you enjoy being around people who are forthcoming with their thoughts and opinions as well. Those around you have come to expect that you will generally &quot;tell it like it is.&quot; You may feel that any untruth, even a little white lie, will lead to more harm than good. Your emotional intolerance for dishonesty — in yourself and others — makes you a highly trustworthy person.
<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<br /><br />i really don't know if i agree to this result or not..my mind's not functioning well.. i'm jaded..

<br /><br />how can i love and hate a person and a song all at at the same time?
<br /><br />i don't know what's gotten in to me.. last night i acted so badly.. just because of one song.. what's with 'your love' that makes me cry and break down?
<br /><br />i love that song.. i really do.. but in times like these, i hate it..
<br /><br />chai, you're right.. something hurts but i don't know where it is.. and i don't know how to ease the pain, heal the wounds, and get over it..
<br /><br />i spent my time looking for a perfect song to describe what i'm feeling today and why i broke down last night.. and i found not only one..
<br /><br />i'm not sure if i have mentioned this before.. but i have a new love.. secondhand serenade..
<br /><br />emo/rock/acoustic.. that's how he describes his music.. yes, secondhand serenade is composed of only one member.. john vesely..
<br /><br />and his story is really amazing.. i wish to have a lifetime partner like him.. someone who can sing me songs of love written with sincerity.. songs which came from the heart.. songs which not only contain words, but emotions..
<br /><br />why secondhand serenade?
<br /><br />&quot;It's everything I would want in a band name and more. It basically sums up what I do. I write my songs about events and feelings that occur in my life, and I sing the songs to my wife. Everyone else gets the Secondhand Serenade.&quot; - John Vesely
<br /><br />isn't he sweet? i swear, he's really good.. and he hits me with his songs..
<br /><br />for more info, visit his myspace page: <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fmyspace.com%2Fsecondhandserenade"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://myspace.com/secondhandserenade</a>
<br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br /><br />You know that I hate this song
<br />Because it was written for you
<br />*I Hate this Song, Secondhand Serenade
<br /><br />And someday, I promise I'll be gone
<br />And someday, I might even sing this song
<br />To you, I might even sing this song, to you
<br />and I was crying alone tonight
<br />and I was wasting all of my life just thinking of you
<br />So just come back we'll make it better
<br />So Just come back I'll make it
<br />better than it ever was
<br />*Maybe, Secondhand Serenade
<br /><br />I lose myself in all these fights
<br />I lose my sense of wrong and right
<br />I cry, I cry
<br />It's shaking from the pain that's in my head
<br />I just wanna crawl into my bed
<br />And throw away the life I led
<br />But I won't let it die, but I won't let it die
<br />*It's not Over, Secondhand Serenade
<br /><br />Will you stay awake for me?
<br />I don't wanna miss anything
<br />I don't wanna miss anything
<br />I will share the air I breathe,
<br />I'll give you my heart on a string,
<br />I just don't wanna miss anything.
<br />.....
<br />And if it's a hero you want,
<br />I can save you. Just stay here.
<br />Your whispers are priceless.
<br />Your breathe, it is dear. So please stay near.
<br />*Awake, Secondhand Serenade
<br /><br />Take me with you
<br />I will never let you down
<br />I will love you now and forever
<br />*Take me With You, Secondhand Serenade
<br /><br />I wish my life was this song
<br />cause songs they never die
<br />I could write for years and years
<br />and never have to cry
<br />*The Last Song Ever, Secondhand Serenade
<br /><br />I'll hold you closer and tell you I love you
<br />but it won't matter in the end
<br />It's obvious you're leaving soon
<br />just another heart to mend
<br />So what happens once you lose control?
<br />When the future has to start
<br />What happens when you're still in love
<br />but time rips you apart.
<br />Is there ever an answer
<br />for when love is not enough?
<br />*End, Secondhand Serenade
<br /><br />If you leave me tonight, I'll wake up alone,
<br />don't tell me I will make it on my own,
<br />don't leave me tonight,
<br />this heart of stone will sing till it dies
<br />if you leave me tonight
<br />.....
<br />I'm not the only one for you
<br />but you're the only one for me
<br />*Stay Close Don't Go, Secondhand Serenade
<br /><br />I never wanted anything the way that I want you
<br />But my words dont seem to matter
<br />*Tested and True, Secondhand Serenade
<br /><br />I will never let you fall
<br />I'll stand up with you forever
<br />I'll be there for you through it all
<br />Even if saving you sends me to heaven
<br />*Your Guardian Angel, The Red Jumpsuit Apparatus
<br /><br />You're the only one I turn to
<br />When I feel like no one's there
<br />And when I'm lonely in my darkest hour
<br />You give me the power
<br />To sit and pretend
<br />*Damn Regret, The Red Jumpsuit Apparatus
<br /><br />not related..
<br /><br />&quot;if someone you love hurts you.. it's fine to cry a river.. just make sure you don't forget to drown the idiot in it..&quot; &lt;&lt;--haha! thanks for this message leyn! i love it!

<br /><br />kung gaano ako kabadtrip kahapon, ganun na lang ako kasaya ngayon.. haha!
<br /><br />yeah, i'm happy.. i guess i woke up on the right side of the bed.. =D
<br /><br />para malaman nyo kung gano ako kabadtrip kahapon, here's an excerpt of what i've written para sana sa blog ko..
<br /><br />***
<br />i hate this day.. nothing went right.. well, it's good that i was able to finish my task and that i'm done with the testing, but still, in general, i didn't have a good day..
<br /><br />i arrived two minutes late for the 8-5 shift so i have to be in the office until 6pm if i want to get the full daily allowance.. and yes, i chose to stay.. that money would mean a lot ,i swear! and i can't just take it for granted.. 
<br /><br />hell is listening to emo songs.. i hate emo but i love secondhand serenade, i love dashboard, i love dishwalla.. true enough, there's a certain pleasure in pain.. and now that i'm hearing that damn &quot;every little thing&quot; by dishwalla, it makes me feel broken, depressed, sad.. but at the same time, hopeful.. hopeful that someday, someone would sing me that song.. 'wish i could be every little thing you wanted..' and hell again, lifehouse! ...'you're all i want, you're all i need.. everything, everything..'
<br /><br />yeah, chai's right.. i can't move on by listening to these darn emo songs.. to hell with emo! but how can i ever stop myself from loving them? all i've been wanting to hear is emo.. 
<br />***
<br /><br />see? obvious naman sigurong yesterday was a bad day for me.. hindi lang yun, nasira pa PC ko.. for some reason, bigla na lang siyang namamatay.. grabe talaga.. at dahil 6pm na ako umuwi, mahirap ng sumakay, traffic pa.. past 7 na ako nakarating sa bahay.. at hindi pa good news ang sumalubong sken.. at may natanggap pa akong text message na lalong nagpainit sa ulo ko.. i swear, nakakarindi talaga.. sa lahat kasi ng ayaw ko e yung sasabihin mo sken kung anong dapat kong maramdaman.. utang na loob naman, pati ba naman emotions ko pakikialaman pa.. err.. i don't wanna talk about it anymore.. mga walang kwentang bagay..
<br /><br />anyway, change topic.. 
<br /><br />so, why am i happy?
<br /><br />una sa lahat, ngayong araw lang ako nagising na walang new message sa phone ko.. masaya ba yun? hehe.. well, actually sad kasi walang nakaalala sken pero ok lang.. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/mellow.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />i started the day right.. syempre prayer muna.. well, ganun naman ako everyday.. ewan ko ba, di talaga maiwasan ang mga hindi magagandang araw.. 
<br /><br />at ano nga bang nangyari? well, hindi ako matagal na naghintay ng masasakyan kanina.. buti na lang mapalad ako ngayong araw.. at umabot pa ako sa 8-5 na shift.. ibig sabihin, makakauwi ako ng 5pm mamaya..yey! yun pa lang, masaya na ako e..
<br /><br />pagdating ko rito, sira pa rin ang pc ko..so i had to report it to zer, our supervisor, who called the attention of the tech support.. 
<br /><br />after x minutes, kuya jojo arrived..
<br /><br />ayun, may ilang bagay siyang ginawa at ayun nga, na-experience nya rin ang topak ng pc ko.. 
<br /><br />after a while, he decided to restore the system.. 
<br /><br />good thing it worked.. and now, ok na uli PC ko.. yey! <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/mellow.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />that's the first good thing.. what's next? well, wala lang naman, nakatxt ko lang naman ang isa sa mga taong super miss ko na.. si ruthie! grabe, sa wakas, nag-abot din kame ng sis kong yun.. 
<br /><br />syempre chikka galore.. kaso lang nasa byahe sya and i had to do something na rin kaya natigil na kme.. later na lang uli.. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/mellow.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />yeah, when it rains, it pours tlaga.. kahapon, inulan ako ng mga hindi kanais-nais na pangyayari, pero ngayon, good things naman ang bumubuhos.. hay.. i guess that's just the way life goes..
<br /><br />another good news: i'm done with almost everything.. actually, with everything.. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/mellow.gif" alt=":)" /> 
<br /><br />done with the setup, testing, queries, unistats.. ok na lahat.. kaya for the rest of the day, eto lang ang gagawin ko.. dumaldal sa blog.. 
<br /><br />for the meantime, eto na muna, later na lang uli.. lunch muna ako.. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/mellow.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />God bless everyone!
<br /><br />it's so nice to be happy.. =D
<br /><br />current song playing on my mind: &quot;I'll worship at Your throne, whisper my own love song.. with all my heart I'll sing, for You my Dad and King.. I'll live for all my days, to put a smile on Your face.. and when we finally meet, it'll be for eternity..&quot;

God is practicing me for a life without him? yeah, that's great! &lt;sigh&gt;
<br /><br />sarcasm aside, i would like to take this chance to share with you some of the realizations i recently had..  rather, the things that have happened today.. just today.. 
<br /><br />i don't wanna wait for tomorrow to write this post because definitely, tomorrow's gonna be a new day.. and what i feel now won't be exactly what i would feel the next day.. without further adieu, let me write about today..
<br /><br />as what i've said in my previous post, today wasn't as good as i intended it to be.. things didn't turn out the way i wanted them to.. not even the way i planned.. and it brought me back to the first chapter of Rick Warren's &quot;The Purpose-Driven Life&quot;.. it's not about me, it's all about God! 
<br /><br />at this point, let me enumerate the things i've been through today.. 
<br /><br />A DAY IN THE LIFE OF A MASKED PRINCESS (what a title)
<br /><br />i woke up at around 7:30 this morning.. i set the alarm to 6:00am because i have a class at 8:30 (supposedly.. good thing our prof didn't arrive.. and that made me much earlier for my next class..) but i was just so tired that my body can't bear to rise.. another reason could be the very nice dream that i had.. how i wish it was real.. real as it seemed in my dreams.. 
<br /><br />..i went to school.. and blah blah blah &lt;place some words here that describe what school is like.. what UP is like.. and yes, Sir Edel's right, hell is UP!&gt;
<br /><br />after class, no.. after the presentation, i went to quiapo to attend the Friday mass, like i always do.. but before that, i was thinking of meeting with him so that i could hand over the cute little thing i bought for him.. 
<br /><br />but i don't have that much time because i need to be in rosario on or before 8pm, 8:30 the latest for our chapter teaching..
<br /><br />in other words, i attended the mass and went to rosario church.. 
<br /><br />and the following paragraphs/words/sentences came from tonight's teaching..
<br /><br />it was the first chapter teaching that i have attended and it was about Faithfulness and Orderliness.. the speaker, (ate) sister jane, was a good one and she has explained well the values and ideas we need to learn as Christians, especially as members of the CFC-SFC community..the best thing she has said: faithfulness means obedience.. obedience to God and trusting His perfect will.. 
<br /><br />but i would like to commend kuya kris who spoke really really well.. honestly, i was amazed by the words he has uttered.. those words really hit me straight to the heart.. i almost cried.. 
<br /><br />first point: Mother Teresa has been canonized as a saint.. and just like her, we are all saints.. for as long as we have faith, we have order, and we believe that God has a plan for our lives, we are saints in our own right.. 
<br /><br />second point: we need to choose to be faithful.. and by being faithful, we must entrust our whole being, our lives to God.. we need to trust him completely..
<br /><br />last and most striking point: good thing i was able to control my tears.. 
<br />&gt;&gt;when a person undergoes a heart transplant, part of his body changes, that is, the heart.. but that doesn't mean that the person is also changed into another being.. 
<br /><br />the person you have loved with your old heart could still be the person you would love with your new heart.. because in reality, it's not the heart that dictates us who we should love.. contrary to what most people believe, one doesn't actually follow his/her heart, it's the mind that works!
<br /><br />the mind is responsible in telling a person that he/she is in love with that special someone.. the heart just feels it..
<br /><br />and i realized, that's a good point.. something i could relate with.. 
<br /><br />no matter how hard you try to stop your heart from wanting a person, you would still end up loving him/her because your mind says so.. 
<br /><br />the heart gets hurt.. yes, that's true.. and sometimes, the agony is already too much to bear that your heart surrenders and is broken into pieces.. but as long as your mind doesn't give up, somehow, you would find enough reasons to hold on, be strong, and stay in love..   
<br /><br />i have always asked this question since people i hold dear have failed me.. why in the hell do i still love them? why can't i just forget and ignore them? when will i stop caring for them? they have hurt me badly, broke my heart into thousand pieces.. they don't care anymore.. yet, i can't help but still be concerned.. 
<br /><br />i thought it was my heart's fault.. it hasn't learned any lesson.. it loved, got hurt, but still loves and i guess will continue to love..  but no.. it wasn't my heart.. 
<br /><br />i thought i have already forgotten to follow the 'mind over heart' principle.. but i was wrong.. it was my mind which decides all along.. 
<br /><br />&quot;life is a combination of success and failures. the best way to focus one's life is to never put a question mark where God has placed a period.&quot;

<br />Let me tell you, make sure you read all the way to the bottom. I almost deleted this email but I was blessed when I got to the end. 
<br /><br />God, when I received this e-mail, I thought... 
<br />I don't have time for this... And, this is really inappropriate during work.   
<br /><br />Then, I realized that this kind of thinking is... Exactly, what has caused lot of the problems in our world today. 
<br /><br />We try to keep God in church on Sunday morning... 
<br />Maybe, Sunday night... 
<br />And, the unlikely event of a midweek service. 
<br />We do like to have Him around during sickness... 
<br /><br />And, of course, at funerals. 
<br /><br />However, we don't have time, or room, for Him during work or play... 
<br /><br />Because.. That's the part of our lives we think... We can, and should, handle on our own. 
<br /><br />May God forgive me for ever thinking... 
<br />That... there is a time or place where..   
<br /><br />HE is not to be FIRST in my life. 
<br /><br />We should always have time to remember all HE has done for us. 
<br /><br />If, You aren't ashamed to do this...   
<br /><br />Please follow the directions. 
<br /><br />Jesus said, &quot;If you are ashamed of me, I will be ashamed of you before my Father.&quot; 
<br /><br />Not ashamed? 
<br /><br />Pass this on ONLY IF YOU MEAN IT!! 
<br /><br />Yes, I do Love God. 
<br /><br />HE is my source of existence and Savior. 
<br /><br />He keeps me functioning each and every day. Without Him, I will be nothing. But, with Christ, HE strengthens me. (Phil 4:13) 
<br /><br />This is the simplest test. 
<br /><br />If You Love God... And, are not ashamed of all the marvelous things HE has done for you... 
<br /><br />Send this to ten people and the person who sent it to you! 
<br /><br />Now do you have the time to pass it on? 
<br /><br />Make sure that you scroll through to the end. 
<br /><br />Easy vs. Hard 
<br /><br />Why is it so hard to tell the truth but Yet so easy to tell a lie? 
<br /><br />Why are we so sleepy in church but Right when the sermon is over we suddenly wake up? 
<br /><br />Why is it so easy to delete a Godly e-mail, but yet we forward all of the nasty ones? 
<br /><br />Of all the free gifts we may receive, Prayer is the very best one.... 
<br /><br />There are no costs, but wonderful rewards... GOD BLESS! 
<br /><br />Notes: Isn't it funny how simple it is for people to trash God and then wonder why the world's going to hell. 
<br /><br />Isn't it funny how someone can say &quot;I believe in God&quot; but still follow Satan (who, by the way, also &quot;believes&quot; in God). 
<br /><br />Isn't it funny how you can send a thousand jokes through e-mail and they spread like wildfire, but when you start sending messages regarding the Lord, people think twice about sharing? 
<br /><br />Isn't it funny how when you go to forward this message, you will not send it to many on your address list because you're not sure what they believe, or what they will think of you for sending it to them. 
<br /><br />Isn't it funny how I can be more worried about what other people think of me than what God thinks of me. 
<br /><br />I pray, for everyone who sends this to their entire address book, they will be blessed by God in a way special for them. 
<br /><br />And send it back to the person who sent it, to let them know that indeed it was sent out to many more.

		<document id="13d187697bf25b3aced75aee26a428f0" url=""><![CDATA[Politics as a Vocation<br/><br/>In her speech at the Ateneo University recently, former president Cory Aquino enumerated what she believed to be the qualities of an ideal leader for our times. She said that he or she “must have a sense of right and wrong, of morality and justice, and a sense of kinship with all of our people.”
<br /><br />These are very general characteristics which can be claimed by almost every contender for the presidency today. Ms. Aquino tried to explain what kind of person she had in mind by giving this composite picture: “...the intelligence of Pepe Diokno, the charisma of Ramon Magsaysay, the courage of Nene Pimentel, the soothing and healing personality of Christian Monsod, the vision of Jose Rizal, and the commitment to the country of all the Filipinos at EDSA.” But this too only impresses upon the citizen the near impossibility of finding a living figure who can lead our nation at this time. 
<br /><br />Perhaps what we need is not one person, but several, who can imagine themselves being “called” to politics, as priests and nuns are called to the religious life. Not every good person can make it as a politician. And as everyone knows, it takes more than an abundance of good intentions to run a government or lead a nation properly. 
<br /><br />There are two types of individuals needed in government: the civil servants who will administer the affairs of government and not engage in politics, and the political leaders who will fight and assume responsibility for governance. Some of the good people Ms. Aquino mentions are cut out for administrative roles, but may not make it as political leaders. Others could be effective politicians but poor civil servants. What we may be looking for are individuals who, in the words of the German sociologist Max Weber, have a real “vocation for politics.”
<br /><br />Politics here is simply understood as the striving to change or influence the distribution of power in society. In Weber's view, this field properly belongs, and should go, not to those who “live off” politics but to those who “live for” politics. In the modern state, political power has become so concentrated in political officials that it behooves everyone who wields it to ask how he can hope to do justice to this power.
<br /><br />Thus Weber asks: “What kind of a man must one be if he is to be allowed to put his hand on the wheel of history?” Exactly what Ms. Aquino tried to answer in her speech at Ateneo. Max Weber – to whose writings all political sociology invariably turns – mentioned “three preeminent qualities (that) are decisive for the politician”: passion, responsibility, and proportion.
<br /><br />The first is passionate devotion to a cause, whatever this cause might be. The ideal politician approaches politics not as a playground for his ego, but as field in which he seeks to achieve a cause much larger than himself, his family or corporation. The striving for power in his case is a purely objective enterprise, which he takes up methodically and relentlessly, and dedicates exclusively to the service of “the cause.” He does not allow himself to enjoy it for “purely personal self-intoxication.” This passion, Weber warns, is not the same as the “sterile excitation” that is common enough among intellectuals.
<br /><br />The second is the feeling of responsibility. The true politician is driven by a substantive purpose. He is concerned with producing concrete results, not impressions. Therefore, he never takes lightly the responsibility for the outcome of his actions. He cares and worries if his actions cause injury to other people. Even as he passionately devotes himself to “the cause,” his political conduct remains rooted in an “ethic of responsibility.” This is an attitude that compels the leader to give an account always of the foreseeable consequences of his decisions. Thus, the responsible politician will never be heard invoking the authority of “ultimate ends” to justify indifference or unmindfulness about injurious results. 
<br /><br />The third is a sense of proportion. Unlike the “power politician” for whom politics is nothing but an ego trip, the true politician maintains a “distance towards one’s self” – he resists the temptations of a “quite vulgar vanity”. He has an instinct for power. Yet he looks upon the striving for power not as enjoyment but as an unavoidable means to the attainment of a higher goal. Therefore, he never loses his objectivity. He is neither resentful nor vengeful. In victory, he thinks of “the responsibility towards the future which above all burdens the victor.” He does not exploit ethics or dishonor the enemy he has defeated. 
<br /><br />This notion of the political vocation restores to politics the dignity it has lost in many societies. At the same time, it is a reminder of the arduous tasks that await those who are “called” to it. Because of my exposure in media, people often ask me if I have any plans of entering politics. My answer has always been, following Weber’s criteria, that I feel I do not have the passion for it. 
<br /><br />I am filled with awe by the standards by which this great thinker, Max Weber, measures politicians and would-be politicians. He concludes: “Only he has the calling for politics who is sure that he shall not crumble when the world from his point of view is too stupid or too base for what he wants to offer. Only he who in the face of all this can say ‘In spite of all!’ has the calling for politics.” It is not of politicians, as we know them, that Weber seems to speak. He is really speaking of leaders and heroes.

<br /><br />~*all your life you're marching onto your own tune.. one day, you'll be surprised to hear someone playing another tune that blends beautifully with yours.. that's true love.. it's not giving up who you are.. it is taking your identity and uniting it with someone else..*~
<br /><br />~*hurt: it's the reaction of the heart when it disagrees with what the mind tells us.. the fact that we're hurting means we know what to do, we just can't accept it..*~
<br /><br />~*one grows distant from another not because of hatred, but because of indifference, but because of fear.. there's the fear that the hurt gets greater as one gets closer; a recognition of the tendency to fall deeply, and consequently drown in a quicksand of stupid irrationalities.. sometimes, what drives one away is not the absence of emotion, but the overwhelming presence of it..*~
<br /><br />~*according to aerodynamics, bees can't fly.. because their small wings are fragile for their heavy bodies.. but they're able to.. because they believe they can..*~
<br /><br />~*we've always known what hurts, still, we haven't learned to stay away from such.. because as painful as it is, if that's the only way to feel their presence, we always give in.. we still check on them every now and then, just to see what's been happening since they left.. that even if sometimes we say 'i just wanna see him/her happy', deep in our hearts, there's this flicker of hope.. so then, its true, that the more you think you are healing, the deeper the wound is searing..*~
<br /><br />~*sometimes, you will feel like you just wanna cry all day.. collect all the pain the whole day brought you.. fill your heart with anger.. internalize every tear that fell from your eyes.. and feel numb about it.. when this happens, close your eyes and cry as much as you want to and end it with a smile.. life is tough.. but prove that you're tougher..*~
<br /><br />~*life has great options, but you don't always have to pick what seem to be the best.. sometimes, the best and the perfect aren't what makes you happy..*~

<br /><br />-&gt;one of those 'pasok sa banga' quotes, as chai calls them.. 
<br /><br />anyway, i'm glad that i've fixed whatever is needed to be fixed.. 
<br />hindi ko pala talaga kaya.. ako rin ang naunang mag-sorry.. it's not true na kayang tiisin ng anak ang magulang.. depende siguro yun sa tao.. as for me, i love my parents that much that i can't afford to hurt them.. although hindi talaga maiwasan minsan.. good thing they understand..
<br /><br />i'm really blessed to have them as my parents.. kahit ano pang sabihin ng ibang tao, for me, they're still the best..
<br /><br />and now that we're ok again, as good as before, i feel relieved.. hindi talaga kasi ako mapalagay 'pag alam kong may hindi ako nalilinis na gusot.. lalo na kung involved ang parents ko.. 
<br /><br />God is good indeed! He constantly guides us to do what's right and what's good..  we just have to pray, ask for guidance, and seek the light.. 
<br /><br />have a good day everyone! God bless! <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/mellow.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />P.S. another good quote:
<br /><br />~*never let the things you want make you forget the things you already have..*~

<br /><br />but i have to stay here until 5pm or else i won't get my allowance for today.. 
<br /><br />killing time.. that's exactly what i'm doing right now.. 
<br /><br />i'm reading almost every recent post in the friendster bulletin board.. and i find these three the most interesting ones.. 
<br /><br />POST #1: 10 Uri ng Manliligaw
<br /><br />what i have to say:
<br /><br />i prefer none of the above.. hehe.. bulok lahat eh.. haha.. pero may kilala akong #9.. kaso lang di rin effective eh.. yung #10 naman, pwede na rin.. basta ba hindi chocnut yung chocolate eh.. tsaka, san ang karugtong nun? pano nya napapakilig yung nililigawan nya?
<br /><br />1. Mr. Gwapings
<br />&gt;&gt; mayaman, gwapo, kilala, at higit sa
<br />lahat may wheels. mataas ang
<br />confidence nya na hindi sya
<br />mababasted, kaya pag nabasted...
<br />maapektuhan ng husto ang kanyang EGO.
<br />at teyk note, malas mo kung may sour
<br />grape attitude pa yan. pwede nyang
<br />sabihing &quot;sus kala mo kung sinong
<br />maganda e pinagtyatyagaan ko lang
<br />naman sya! pwe!&quot;
<br /><br />2. Mr. Quickie
<br />&gt;&gt; ang type ng manliligaw na kada
<br />magkikita kayo e wala nang alam na
<br />sabihin kundi &quot;kelan mo ba ako
<br />sasagutin?&quot; o kaya &quot;i love you na, ako
<br />ba hindi mo pa lab?&quot; kahit na isang
<br />linggo pa lang naman syang pumoporma.
<br />kung baga dinadaan nya sa pangungulit
<br />para mabilis ang pagsagot mo.
<br /><br />3. Mr. Everything
<br />&gt;&gt; linya nya ang &quot;sagutin mo lang ako,
<br />ibibigay ko sayo lahat, lahat ng
<br />magustuhan mo. kahit ang pa buwan o
<br />kaya mundo.&quot; !@#$ ka na pag nagpauto
<br />ka. dahil pag sinagot mo na yan,
<br />makakalimutan na nya ang linyang yan.
<br /><br />4. Mr. Stalker
<br />&gt;&gt; eto yung type ng manliligaw na pag
<br />nagkahiwalay kayo e sisimulan ka sa
<br />tanong na &quot;kumain ka na ba?&quot;
<br />pagkasagot mo susundan pa nya ulit ng
<br />tanong &quot;nsan ka ngayon?&quot; &quot;sinong
<br />kasama mo?&quot; &quot;anong ginagawa mo?&quot; at
<br />kung anu- ano pa. basta tungkol sa
<br />daily activities mo kelangan malaman
<br />nya.
<br /><br />5. Mr. Take it or leave it
<br />&gt;&gt; pag binasted mo ang ganitong type
<br />ng manliligaw, asahan mo bukas may
<br />nililigawan na sya ulit. at heto pa,
<br />hinding hindi ka na nya papansinin.
<br />period.
<br /><br />6. Mr. Salesman
<br />&gt;&gt; dadaanin ka sa matatamis na salita.
<br />parang si Mr. Everything din kaya lang
<br />sya mas matindi mang-uto. yun bang
<br />tipong..&quot;ang ganda ganda talaga ng mga
<br />mata mo..&quot; o kaya &quot;ang kinis kinis mo&quot;
<br />o kaya &quot;ang lambot ng mga kamay mo&quot; at
<br />iba pang pang-uuto mapasagot ka lang.
<br /><br />7. Mr. Good Dog
<br />&gt;&gt; eto ang nakakatuwang manliligaw.
<br />kase payag syang magpaalipin. taga
<br />bitbit ng bag mo o kahit ng mga
<br />kaibigan mo. kahit magmuka syang
<br />buntot sa tuwing may gala kayo ng mga
<br />barkada mo. nagpapakitang gilas kung
<br />baga. pero pag sinagot mo na, for sure
<br />gaganti yan.
<br /><br />8. Mr. Anonymous
<br />&gt;&gt; motto nya ang &quot;action speaks louder
<br />than voice&quot;. wala kang kaalam-alam,
<br />nanliligaw na pala. kaya pala ang bait-
<br />bait sayo. e akala mo mabait lang
<br />talaga. hehe!
<br /><br />9. Mr. Second chance
<br />&gt;&gt; sya ang pinakamasugid
<br />mong manliligaw. kahit 100 tayms mong
<br />sabihing ayaw mo sa kanya at wala na
<br />syang pag-asa ang sasabihin nya
<br />parin &quot;Please give me a second chance&quot;
<br /><br />10. Mr. Romantiko
<br />&gt;&gt; jologs ang mga paraan nya sa
<br />panliligaw. manghaharana,
<br />pakikisamahan mga barkada mo,
<br />liligawan parents mo at laging may
<br />dalang flowers and chocolates tuwing
<br />dadalaw. pero madalas nakakapagpakilig
<br />sya ng nililigawan nya dahil sa
<br /><br />GUYS lam nio n b kung alin keo jan?..
<br />GIRLS: which do you prefer?..
<br /><br />POST #2: This is Why Girls Cry
<br /><br />what i have to say:
<br /><br />i agree to everything.. and i would like to add, most girls also cry when they're overwhelmed.. i don't want to generalize but i believe it's not only me who cries out of extreme happiness.. happiness because someone appreciated my work, someone told me he/she loves me and i felt his/her sincerity, and/or someone cared for me so much and i was touched by his/her action..
<br /><br />this is a nice post except that the repost instructions are kind of exaggerated.. 
<br /><br />They Fell In Love With The Wrong Person
<br /><br />They're Mad
<br /><br />They're Sad
<br /><br />They're Scared
<br /><br />They're Nervous
<br /><br />They're Frustrated
<br /><br />They're Missing Someone
<br /><br />They're Alone
<br /><br />They Have To Let Him Go
<br /><br />They're PMSing
<br /><br />They're Pregnant
<br /><br />They're Tired Of Abusive Relationships
<br /><br />Their Heart Is broken
<br /><br />They're In Love
<br /><br />They Still Want To Be With That Special Person
<br /><br />Their Souls Have Been Torn
<br /><br />They Met Someone They Can't Have
<br /><br />They Feel Cheated
<br /><br />They Hurt So Bad Inside
<br /><br />They feel unloved
<br /><br />They Saw Him With Her
<br /><br />They Saw Him Kiss Her
<br /><br />They're Confused
<br /><br />It's Over
<br /><br />BOYS!!!: If any girl you know is
<br />crying, and you see them, don't just
<br />stand there like an ass and say you're
<br />sorry, hold them, kiss them, and tell
<br />them everything will be ok, even if
<br />you have no idea what is wrong with
<br />them. Girls go through more drama than
<br />you can imagine! Girls just want to be
<br />held and know that someone cares about
<br />them.
<br /><br />Girls: Repost this if you're tired of
<br />dealing with the drama, and you're
<br />sick of putting up with the bullshit!
<br /><br />Boys: Repost if you're a loving,
<br />caring, sensitive guy, who hates to
<br />see a girl hurt like this and you hate
<br />to see a girl cry!
<br /><br />Repost this in:
<br /><br />1 minute: You'll will find your true
<br />love next week!!!
<br /><br />2 minutes: You'll find them in two
<br />weeks!!!
<br /><br />3 mintutes: You'll find them in three
<br />weeks!!!
<br /><br />4 minutes: You'll find your true love
<br />when you're 90 years old
<br /><br />5 minutes: You took too damn long and
<br />someone else got them!!
<br /><br />and re-post as &quot;this is why girls cry&quot;
