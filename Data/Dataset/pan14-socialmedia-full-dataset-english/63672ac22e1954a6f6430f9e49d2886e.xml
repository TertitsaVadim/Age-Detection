The issue is now getting full media attention in Kerala.  And for the first time, coverage has surpassed issues such as Plachimada which dwarfs into insignificance when one examines the havoc wrecked by endosulfan in Kasaragod district of Kerala and northern areas of Karnataka. People have been affected by endosulfan in Palakkad and Idukki districts also, though they are yet to be documented.
<br />The Union Minister of State for Agriculture K. V. Thomas’s attempt to speak for the endosulfan lobby has boomeranged on him. The issue snowballed with Mr. Thomas’s speech in the heart of Kasaragod district.
<br />To retain its ground and to pre-empt the Union Ministry for Environment and Forests, the Union Agriculture Ministry announced a new committee to study the issue. C. D. Mayee, who headed an earlier committee that declared that no link had been established between endosulfan and the health problems of people in 11 panchayats of Kasaragod district, was suitably chosen to head the committee. The outcome is predictable, but this time around, public criticism is not going to be doused by its report.
<br />Succor to endosulfan victims was something promised by V. S. Achuthanandan when he was the Opposition. His slow-acting government has taken years to get into action to reach any significant assistance to the victims. (Non-governmental organisations did better than the government.). Now, he has convened a review meeting and made some announcements. But the government is likely to demit office with a half completed study by the State Council for Science, Technology and Environment and credit for providing marginal assistance to the victims.
<br />Core issues like compensation to the victims remain unattended by successive governments. Even the Human Rights Commission is forgetting about fundamental rights to safe drinking water and food when it talks of health facilities alone.
<br />Update (22/12/2010): The Centre has decided to drop Mayee from the committee and decided to appoint a committee headed by a health department official. No package for victims or national  ban on the pesticide before the committee submits its report.</strong><em></em><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/144991241_2261345_36612664.jpg" /><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/144991241_3301680_36612661.jpg" /><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/144991241_8062934_36612658.jpg" /><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/144991241_13112028_36612649.jpg" /><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/144991241_14534110_36612647.jpg" />

<br /> flowers and plants adorn his cradle. 
<br />Light snow on evergreen; autumn leaves in a riot colour,
<br /> golden sun on the desert floor 
<br />everything,
<br /> everything cherished him.
<br /> As his dreams and desires he grew up. 
<br />He place his first step auspiciously
<br /> he swung in the wind 
<br />He wished to soar like a bird
<br /> and settle   in space.
<br />He could fly……………
<br />And settle in space.
<br />He changed the history by his numberless discoveries.
<br />Nobody could trounce him. 
<br />but sky abandoned him.
<br />Rain, thunder and tempest frightened him with its destructive floods.
<br />Then he tried to establish his kingdom in the depths of water.
<br />He could swim 
<br />and travel through it.
<br />Neither the vast sky , nor the flowing water gave him shelter.
<br />He was immersed in despair and anxiety.
<br />He thought ‘I destroyed the beautiful earth which was gifted to me,
<br />I lost my dream sky, the water and all.
<br />All left leaving me alone.
<br /><br />BUT A LOVING GOD IS THERE TO KEEP YOU AS THE APPLE OF HIS EYE...NEVER ..NEVER BE ALONE</div>

If I love you, you are in continuous fear that I may start loving somebody else too. And with the love divided, you will not be getting the same quantity you were getting before. Jealousy is nothing but an expression that love is still a quantity in your mind: shared it becomes less; shared with many people, you are getting less and less. Hence a monopoly is needed, so that you can have the whole lot of it.         And both of the lovers – because of this stupid idea – are suspicious, are always spying on each other. You are confined to an imprisonment. And the same way you are confined, you are jailed; in return you are creating a jail for your    jailer. All lovers are functioning as jailers to each other. Hence, love promises so many roses but brings only thorns, promises stars but brings only scars.    The awakened    person, the person who is conscious of his acts, of himself transforms every quantity into quality. His love becomes lovingness. He is a loving person. Now lovingness is not quantity, it is a quality. It is not confined to somebody, it has nothing to do with the other, and it has something to do with you. Your heart is overflowing with a loving energy; everybody is invited…….whoever is receptive.</div>
