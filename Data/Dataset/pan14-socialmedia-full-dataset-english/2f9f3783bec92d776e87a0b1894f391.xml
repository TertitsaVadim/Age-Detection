<br /><br />WASHINGTON – The current strong gains in hiring makes the Federal Reserve policymakers worried that it could buzz if the economic growth of the US doesn’t go up.
<br /><br />According to the Fed’s minutes on Tuesday, members were first stated their concerns before they make a plan to keep interest rates at record lows until at least late year 2014. However, some of the members want to take further procedures to improve the economy current status if a condition gets worse or inflation remains reclaimed.
<br /><br />After the meeting, Fed presented the somewhat current view of the economy mainly because of the three consecutive months of hiring in two years. It was concluded that there have been similar raptures of hiring in the previous two years which ended up fading.
<br /><br />On the speech echoed by the Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke last week in the economists gathering, the decline of the economy recovery was the main concern of Fed as it did last year.
<br /><br />Americans aren’t receiving meaningful pay augmentation. Gas prices are high. Additionally, Europe’s debt crisis could reflect on the U.S economy. Provided that the inflation will remain on its current position, analysts think that the Fed will likely give interest rates down in order for them to give the economy an additional support. Most of the economists don’t think that Fed officials will alter their interest-rate policy at their following meeting on April 24-25 and will only relieve credits if the economy gradually moves from its current status.

<br /><br />Because of the cut down prices of copper on Monday stamped as a sign of a slower global economy in which many are asking about what is the future demand for the industrial metal. It was being lowered down two percent as well as the palladium and silver. These three metals are used in a huge number of consumer products from automobiles to consumer electronics and construction materials. It was reported that in the past few days the driving of the economic worries which includes the slowdown in U.S job creation and an increase in China’s inflation rate.
<br /><br />The U.S Labor Department reported Friday that employers added just 120,000 jobs in March, about half the pace from December through February. That renewed concerns about the pace of U.S. economic growth. Consumer prices in China rose 3.6 percent from a year ago but remained below the government’s 4 percent target for the year. Investors speculated that the government may not cut the ratio of funds that banks must hold as reserves, which would free up money for lending, R.J. O’Brien senior commodities broker Phil Streible said. That could hurt demand for copper in the world’s second-largest economy, which is a huge importer of raw materials.

<br /><br />I recently had the opportunity to show a couple of first time visitors around Hong Kong. They were connecting to a cruise and only had a day and a half. Additionally, the weather was hot and extremely muggy, a condition they were not used to. What to do? What to do?
<br />Since they were staying in Hung Hom on the Kowloon side, the first leg was easy. Take the Star Ferry to Central where we could meet up easily (I live in Central). Since I had just arrived that morning after an all-night 14 hour flight from the U.S., I set up a 2:00pm meeting and they used the late morning and early afternoon to wander around and have a light lunch.
<br /><br />I first walked them through the IFC Mall. They aren't shoppers but malls, whether we, who live here, like it or not, are a significant part of the &quot;Hong Kong experience.&quot; They were interested in what a Hong Kong Supermarket was like so we toured City Super, which with its Japanese flavor and ethnically diverse product offerings is surprisingly interesting to visitors.
<br /><br />Next we rode the escalator up to Hollywood Road, sometimes called &quot;Antique Street.&quot; New visitors are fascinated and often awed by the escalator. I'm still slightly in awe of it after 14 years. From there, it's an easy stroll past the antique shops to the Man Mo Temple with its hundreds of burning incense offerings and praying visitors. It may not be fancy or famous but it is inherently intriguing. It’s the oldest continuously operating temple in Hong Kong. You can find a review of it elsewhere in this journal.

<br /><br />HAMILTON, N.J., May 15, 2012 -- /PRNewswire/ -- Cruise Shipping Asia-Pacific –conference and trade show focusing on the emerging Asian-Pacific cruise industry— interviews Rama Rebbapragada, Chairman of the Asia Cruise Association and supporter of the Cruise Shipping Asia-Pacific show. The Asia Cruise Association (ACA) is a leading cruise association dedicated to the development and promotion of the cruise industry in the Asia-Pacific region. Mr. Rebbapragada will be speaking at Cruise Shipping Asia-Pacificat the Marina Bay Sands, Singapore from September 17-18, 2012.
<br /><br />(Photo: <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fphotos.prnewswire.com%2Fprnh%2F20120515%2FNY07662"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20120515/NY07662</a>)
<br /><br />Rama Rebbapragada, Chairman of the Asia Cruise Association, describes the opportunities to come in the rapidly growing Asian Cruise marketplace. What do you see as the major opportunities in your market in the next 2 years? RR: The continuing popularity of cruising as a mainstream vacation option within Asia coupled by the increased deployment of newer and larger ships into the region. The continuing growth in South East Asia and China and the re-emergence of markets such as Japan, not only as a destination but as source markets present huge opportunities for cruising in Asia.
<br /><br />Among the challenges the industry faces, which do you think are the most pressing? RR: Port infrastructure development to accommodate large ships in ports of call within South East Asia and Japan is the most pressing challenge. CIQ and guest visa regulations in North Asia and certain supply chain related issues are also areas that needed to be addressed to make Asia a cruise industry friendly region. Travel agent training and increasing the number of travel agents selling cruises in Asia is another pressing need for the industry. What do you believe are the most creative solutions to these challenges? RR: Encouraging private investment in port development with certain incentives similar to what is going on in Europe should help smaller ports get upgraded faster to accommodate the increased capacity in the region. Partnering with tourism boards, trade associations and adapting industry certified training modules and customizing them to the local needs would help address the lack of knowledge on selling cruising within the trade community.
