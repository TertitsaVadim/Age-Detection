<br />An apathetic star looked shineless as an ancient husk.
<br />Terminal illness rained down and around like ashes and dust,
<br />Cancelling out a summer of delinquency and lust.
<br /><br />Crackling and bellowing upon stained steel and urbanisation,
<br />A lost train from 1899 travelled through time and degeneration.
<br />The passenger corpses stared aimlessly through cracked glass,
<br />A little less so, in the preserved first class.
<br />A perfectly normal sight it would seem to the other blank stares,
<br />On the platform of apathy where not a soul cares.
<br /><br />A train of thought flew by at the speed of lightning,
<br />Almost escaping unseen but it felt a grip tightening.
<br />Choking and spluttering it tried to deny it's identity
<br />With zombie-like determination and uttermost obscenity.
<br />It struggled for all its worth, so it was not long overcome.
<br /><br />That'll give you something to think about when you see a ghost train.
<br /><br />The Antinational Obligatory Ethnic Cleaning Through Globalised Culture
<br /><br />...originated in 1887, the AEECTGC was founded by a schizophrenic prophet by the name of Alberto Harold Esquire III. It's no suprise the organisation has only been kept alive by his descendants (schizophrenia after all, is hereditory, one common sympton is an exagerrated pretense of grandeur). Alberto's rewal name was Roger and he wasn't really a prophet, still all humour and satire surrounding the whole thing was usually lost by a term known as 'stating the obvious' when letting an audience read between the lines is more often than not a sure fire way to invoke feelings of amusement whilst also provoking an ego boost in seemingly obscure complex jokes that the average person may not understand.
<br /><br />Through the evolution of humankind, millions of years of life, existance, and all that, you'd think common sense would have reached an acceptable height at least. One or two or a thousand and eight may of thought the world would be rational now and everything would make complete sense one way or another. What they wouldn't of counted on is the basic psychology of mankind, particularly the lack of control over emotions. One of these possible one thousand and ten people was a pseudo-detective who went by the name of Clinton Royce. As the only member of the Esquire family that didn't join the AOECTGC you would consider him to be sane.
<br /><br />That's an introduction to Clinton Royce, taking a rather odd approach.
<br /><br />I hope you understand more about the nature of sense and nonsense.

<br /><br />Do your best to look like a teddy bear,
<br />then pretend to look vertically dead.
<br /><br />Go by bus, they're highly dependable
<br /><br />You never hear a bloke getting knocked on the bonce,
<br />Although there was a driveby shouting once
<br /><br />My grandfather's clock was too tall for the shelf,
<br />So I sold it and opened up a store, selling JOY DIVISION OVEN GLOVES!
<br /><br />I dreamt about a love affair in far off Budapest, 
<br />The sort of thing that sugars every pill.
<br /><br />Well they mocked me in my mocks,
<br />And embroidered in my socks...the bastard son of Dean Friedman.
<br /><br />Irk the purists tonighttttttt
<br /><br />I can lend or offend, mend or befriend...as I help to set up the PA
<br /><br />I don't know anyone who puts peaches on their cornflakes either
<br /><br />99% of Gargoyles look like Bob Todd!
<br /><br />The universe is ruled by chance and indifference
<br /><br />If it wasn't for my pills, my psychiatric bills, 
<br />and your unreliable fullopians.
<br /><br />If only you'd give me my Lev Yashin poster back 
<br />Six months ago, I'd return your brown anorak, 
<br />But you keep forgetting 
<br />And its far too upsetting 
<br />So baby Ferenc Puskas to you, to you 
<br /><br />When you're holding tea and toast and there's noone else about, do you switch the kitchen light off with your chin?
<br /><br />God I could murder a Cadbury's flake, but then I guess you wouldn't let me into heaven.
<br /><br />Check yer sheds, check yer sheds, I think I've lost my mind!
<br /><br />(to the tune of Yellow Submrine) In the town, where I was born, lived a man who went to work, and he told us of his life, building spaceships on Â£40 a week, and he'd take us all for rides, and we'd take some serious drugs, on board the enterprise allowance, we can do anything we like.
<br /><br />They came for the reflexologists, but I wasn't a reflexologist, so I did nothing
<br />They came for Danni Bear, I said she's over there, behind the wardrobe
<br />They came for the fire eaters, but I wasn't a fire eater, so I did nothing
<br />Turn a blind eyeeee, sometimes it's best to, turn a blind eyeeee
<br /><br />The singer outta Slipknot went to rome to see the pope,
<br />and the pope said to his aid...
<br />WHOOOO THE FUCKING HELL ARE SLIPKNOT??
<br />In relation to me getting out of bed.
<br /><br />I've been in a mental hospital
<br />I've been in a mental hospital
<br />I've been in a mental hospital
<br />I've been in a mental hospital
<br /><br />Careful with that spliff Eugene, it causes condensation!
<br /><br />SEAL CLUBBING!!!!
<br /><br />Your optimism strikes me as junk mail address to the dead
<br /><br />Go find some HALF MAN HALF BISCUIT

<br />A chill of a breeze clashing with warmth's intrusion.
<br />Singing out to the vastness,
<br />Pleeing for absolution.
<br />A dot upon a dot,
<br />Flowing through understanding.
<br /><br />How the landscape has changed,
<br />Along my old time journeys.
<br />How people get left behind,
<br />Whilst others seek calmer shores.
<br />Do they really subdue the tempest?
<br />Or just get blown into another?
<br /><br />Gently pick out the fleeting moments,
<br />Sew them into a patchwork or wonderment.
<br />Absorb the sweet with the bitter,
<br />And colour your world erratically,
<br />Only stopping to perfect the stars,
<br />The constant to soothe the ache.
<br /><br />Bit of random free verse...inspiration = music I'm listening to electronic/chill out/ambient stuff. - made me think of waking up on the beach, but not the typical image of a warm sandy beach in paradise. Understanding nature and the endless metaphors you can extract from it. How the sea and land stretches for miles, making you seem so insignificant. 
<br />How streets change through the years, how you wonder about the people who stay and where the people that left went. About how people try to run from their troubles, and how some will always follow until you resolve them mentally. 
<br />And finally, how the mundanity and negativity don't have to overcome you, and how you can imagine your life as made up of all the best and worst moments that paint a picture that doesn't have to be colourful, or black and white, but of all the uniqueness that can include every colour and shade imaginable. And that there's always going to be a constant energy that leads you in your directions, and how if you accept that energy and keep it positive then you'll see life isn't so bad, in fact, it's great.
<br /><br />That is a deviation from my normal nonsense, so some nonsense to follow soon I think =]

<br />I would erase the disorder part, 
<br />Because it is not in my nature to be adaptive,

<br />But you're more like a soggy paper, left to decay.
<br />But still I'd vow, to do wonderful things for you,
<br />I'd firstly go out and celebrate you, by getting a tattoo.
<br /><br />I would not die for you perhaps, maybe a third degree burn,
<br />Maybe not so far, maybe just file your tax return.
<br />I'd torture a kitten just for your approval,
<br />Not too morbidly, maybe just some hair removal.
<br /><br />There are many, many things I'd do for you, Mr.Jones,
<br />Like make you some tea cakes, or maybe just some scones.
<br />I'd bake you every single type of pie,
<br />And do funny impressions of Stephen Fry,
<br />Even if you're more partial to a bit of Laurie,
<br />I'd probably be too preferenced to say sorry.
<br /><br />I would whole-heartedly make a bio-pic of your life,
<br />And undoubtedly would play your made up wife.
<br />I would even wear pink to our wedding,
<br />And perhaps have it at a festival, maybe Reading.
<br />We'd honeymoon in dangerous parts of Iran, 
<br />Where we would most likely get a much needed tan.
<br /><br />If you needed it so, I would give you my kidney,
<br />Or at least a runner-up prize, of a trip to Sydney.
<br />And if there, you were bitten by a poisonous spider,
<br />And there was an antidote, I would be the provider.
<br />Though if you joined the cast of Home and Away,
<br />Don't be suprised, if I decided to stray.
<br /><br />There are endless, wonderful and fantastical things,
<br />That I would do, for Mr.Jones.

<br /><br />To be exact, twenty two thousand and fifty nine,
<br />One being, to find him a friend in interior design.
<br />You see, his bathroom is sadly decorated using lime and lilac,
<br />Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen went there and had an anxiety attack!
<br />(He never did pee again, despite the excrutiating pain.)
<br /><br />I would dress up as a polar bear and do volunteer work,
<br />Even for the mental, if they didn't go too beserk.
<br />I'd scrub the elderly and humour the dying,
<br />Even if any involved were not complying.
<br />I'd become a nun too, still dressed as a bear,
<br />And help the homeless, with their dental care.
<br /><br />I'd shave my head for you without a second thought,
<br />And then rob a wig store as long as I wouldn't be caught.
<br />Yes, for your amusement I'd run naked through Tesco,
<br />And resist arrest by insisting I was a renowned chess pro,
<br />Even though Scrabble pro would amuse me more,
<br />Or even a veteran of the Spanish civil war.
<br /><br />I'd have your babies and call them number one, two and three,
<br />And maybe a fourth so they could all do the YMCA.
<br />And when that got boring we could leave them in the woods,
<br />Or find someone to exchange them for consumer goods.
<br />Or maybe we could just raise a shetland pony named Blue,
<br />And when he got old and dull, we could just sell him for glue.

<br />There are numerous things that I'd simply have to resist.
<br />I would not eat a muffin, two weeks past it's sell by date,
<br />Having just done so, not noticing the rapid mold growth rate.
<br /><br />For you I simply couldn't, lick a monkey's eyeball,
<br />Or sit through an entire game, of professional baseball.
<br />And I would certainly oppose to starting a war,
<br />In anywhere but Australia or Singapore.
<br /><br />I can't say I would give you my last rolo,
<br />And if you liked acid jazz you'd be dancing solo.
<br />I simply couldn't sit through another Lord of the Rings,
<br />Or listen to anything Ronan Keating sings.
<br /><br />I'd have to protest to blowing up Blackpool tower,
<br />And especially to you singing in the shower.
<br />I'd not stand by your choice of BT over Virgin,
<br />Even if they did have plans of merging.
<br /><br />So don't quite go mad with power yet,
<br />It might just be, your biggest regret. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/evileyes.gif" alt=":)" />

<br /></span>
<br />Feathers and dice distort the mishap,
<br />A shiny gloss over missing foundations.
<br />No tangled rags to confide the failure,
<br />No visible tears nor open wounds.
<br /><br />The rich red walls and golden ceilings
<br />Conceal the apathy and degradation.
<br />A royal flush blazes,
<br />Whilst a hope burns out.
<br /><br />There's no real love to be found,
<br />In this house of addiction.
<br />A gamble was taken,
<br />A loser was chosen,
<br /><br />He was born out of forgotten lust,
<br /><span style="text-decoration:underline"></span>And watched all his luck crumble to dust.
<br />He was trapped in a side glance,
<br />Waiting for his, game of chance. 
<br /><br />03/09/07
<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration:underline">42g Pebble</span>
<br /><br />Devoid they lay, draped in red and gold stars,
<br /><br />A candle shines and contrast burns.
<br /><br />Close your eyes for the visualisation,
<br /><br />Of navy and silver intoxication.
<br /><br />Absorb the words until you relate,
<br /><br />Follow them as they lead to your fate.
<br /><br />A coincidence marked in a dull shade,
<br /><br />White wood denial, tattered and frayed.
<br /><br />Far off, a drop d tuned riff,
<br /><br />Moonkissed and carried through the airless night
<br /><br />In the reign of apathy and grey,
<br /><br />The drops of hope fall in dismay,
<br /><br />And beneath the flag of black and white,
<br /><br />Jagged continuity and distraction unite.
<br /><br />Steal the teal from the broken sky,
<br /><br />Amplify the call of disaffection,
<br /><br />Monotone and monochrome.
<br /><br />Bury me where I fall. 
<br /><br />01/02/07
<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration:underline">Deep Sense of Darkness</span>
<br /><br />A distorted kind of perception, led to this state,
<br />Where upon these eyes, opened too late.
<br />It's the decay before the bloom,
<br />A life wasted away,
<br />Nothing can bring it back,
<br />Let it live another day.
<br /><br />The lucid kind of corrossion, broke down the foundation,
<br />Blocked every inch, of any new creation.
<br />The descent beyond,
<br />The balance of reality,
<br />A concept out of mind,
<br />Believing immortality.
<br /><br />It was the deep sense of darkness, that broke through the seams,
<br />Intruded into every aspect, seeped into dreams.
<br />A silent desperation,
<br />Lost the will to cope,
<br />And when the ashes clear,
<br />So will, the final hope.

<br /><br />The blessing of the night brings mystery to the ocean,
<br />Waves; a dark tranquility; swift yet a strong motion,
<br />Beauty of the waters give nest to the moon,
<br />Purple clouds surround and hug it into a cacoon,
<br />Jellyfish in the depths set it alight
<br />To give illumination to the fairground of the night,
<br />Starfish reflect the skies own decoration,
<br />Shoals of fish swim in a routine of orientation,
<br />Imsomniac's eyes sink to the seabed and find
<br />The secrets of the oceans making them blind,
<br />Nature's forgotten beauty hides under the blanket,
<br />Silent whispers; ripples in the water, thank it.
<br /><br />The moon retires it's guard of the Earth,
<br />The sun, once again to the light gives birth,
<br />Waters still so dark in the gleam of the sunshine,
<br />Thick oil washes onto the weeping shoreline,
<br />The mystery of the deep is a tanker wreck,
<br />Birds lay dead and polluted; no longer fly or peck,
<br />The night was silent, no dolphins or whales,
<br />Toxic liquid the death, boats cast down their sails.
<br />Golden sand is now worthless and dull,
<br />Hopeless, accepting, sailors gaze down from the hull.
<br />The dark untaints, protects purity from the evil,
<br />The sun opens our eyes, to the truth, and the lies.

<br /><br />Something put together out of useless images.
<br /><br />Hmmmm
<br /><br />I've just met a beatle, he's eager to tell me many things,
<br />But instead of explaining he just sings and sings.
<br /><br />He tells me he wants to be a paperback writer,
<br />Not a doctor, a lawyer, nor fire fighter.
<br />He invites me to his octopus' garden under the sea,
<br />But strawberry fields is where I'd rather be.
<br />We spot lucy in the sky and the fool on the hill,
<br />And wonder why he's staying there still.
<br />Then he tells me he wants to hold me tight,
<br />When it's been a hard day's night.
<br />I tell him all I have is a ticket to ride,
<br />But I can't buy his love so my offer's denied.
<br />Nothing's gonna change his world.
<br /><br />If you think that's pants, check this out...
<br /><br />It's raining, it's pouring, and incredibly boring,
<br />The footsteps echo on the laminate flooring.
<br />There's no cheese in the fridge but a slug in the bath,
<br />And electoral reformers looking for staff.
<br />I picture myself in a boat on the river,
<br />With a very important message to deliver.
<br />It's for the devil but he doesn't care,
<br />He's far too busy playing solitaire.
<br />But he's always losing with a three card draw,
<br />So breaks the screen with a circular saw.
<br />There's nothing to do so we play some poker,
<br />I wager my soul but it's too mediocre.
<br />A gnome joins in but I know he'll bluff,
<br />It's obvious he's got an ace up his cuff.
<br /><br />It's summertime in hell so we all go swimming,
<br />Satan storms off when I tell him his beard needs trimming.
<br />It's time to be off anyway, things to do,
<br />Stories to construe, books to review.
<br />A kangaroo to beat with a tennis shoe.
<br />It started the fight when it invaded my land,
<br />I had no choice but to take the upper hand.
<br />My military command only went so far,
<br />Till the troops deemed it too bizarre.
<br />My army now patrols the British isles,
<br />Looking for 2 for 1 offers and shampoo free trials.
<br /><br />We can't all live in a yellow submarine,
<br />Or operate a dialysis machine,
<br />Which wouldn't be that cool in any case,
<br />As it would take up too much storage space.
<br />I'd much rather have some stripy socks,
<br />And fish for crabs down by the docks,
<br />Then have an affair with a delusional sailor,
<br />Who thinks he's a pirate living in a trailer.
<br />We'd eat tuna for breakfast, lunch and dinner,
<br />As we dream of being a lottery winner.
<br />We'll elope on a boat he named after me,
<br />And live happily ever after on the HMS Tallapodee.
<br /><br />And if you thought that was too pants to be true, even more garblegobble!
<br /><br />Flipper doodle candle bee,
<br />Caffle pop in the pine tree,
<br />Idiosyncratic fandle bar,
<br />Big and fruitful tootle star.
<br />Hargen gaffle into two,
<br />Zip the zebra at the zoo,
<br />Plagarize iggy pop,
<br />What a snoopy rabble cop!
<br /><br />Mute and youthful shoe?
<br />Yooble you and through,
<br />Kaboosh the lies,
<br />Agglebash the skies,
<br />Tie the ties,
<br />To prove the lies.
<br />Enter sandle sham,
<br />Wafer thin ham.
<br /><br />I aim to be your faithful baker,
<br />Whilst you become a mover and shaker.
<br /><br />At unconventional times we shall jive,
<br />As long as there's a CD drive.
<br /><br />Tipple the tape imperial,
<br />Waffle apes for cereal,
<br />Take the poodle path,
<br />Read some Sylvia Plath,
<br />For fun or misery,
<br />Try some aggrissery.
<br />Limple logs and pans,
<br />Rid fiddlers of frying pans,
<br />Before they elaborate
<br />Onto the irate.
<br />Reform gaffer plants,
<br />Oogle smelly aunts.
<br /><br />Umpire yepper gates,
<br />Mosh the dinner plates,
<br />Visit fifty states,
<br />Whilst hindering empty fates.
<br />Wash your hobblegoss,
<br />Hike your ampleboss,
<br />Yearn for apple flip,
<br />Take a yumpton trip.
<br /><br />Hark the void beneath my garden boots!
<br />Has the hunt gone beyond my grasp?
<br />The snail huffles at my hardened roots,
<br />But will he ever escape my clasp?

<br /><br />A flirty co-founder, a pencil gnawed,
<br />The putrid smell of that zombie horde.
<br />I've got the telemarket sympathy quote.
<br />I've got a ten year old doctor's coat.
<br /><br />Cos I'm a true, true drug abuser.
<br />I'm a true, true drug abuser.
<br /><br />I embark on the soaring plain,
<br />The sky was empty, now my domain,
<br />And if it's not, I'd have to take a drop,
<br />And print wilfully that I was a traffic cop.
<br /><br />Cos there's a few, few badger abusers
<br />There's a few, few badger abusers
<br /><br />(Fetch my slippers, Molly!)
<br /><br />I used to favour injustice and the uncouth,
<br />A sigh for a sigh, a youth for a youth.
<br />One day I know I'll have to trace his math,
<br />A talk with Michelle for a talk with Sylvia Plath.
<br /><br />Cos I'm a shoe, shoe end user,
<br />I'm a shoe, shoe end user.
<br /><br />Cos I'm due, due to be a loserrrr
<br /><br />Fiddled with the lyrics of Blue Badge Abuser by Half Man Half Biscuit
<br />...badly haha

The street lights blurred as you dozed, then snapped into sharp focus as another venemous remark reached your almost jaded ears. Those two obscured figures in the front of the car were slowly becoming distant strangers, to each other and to you. A hazy face turned your way for a second and you wondered if they noticed your damp eyes, and whether they recognized them as tears or just a sympton of your fatigue, which it was. 
<br />     More words were being tossed seat to seat now, each one with an even more irascible response. You couldn't make out the last few words, but they even seemed to sting your heart. Silence ensued as the ashes of the fight began to settle on old wounds once more. You wouldn't of imagined this old silence would lead to new depths of repressed emotion being unleashed, but you anticipated a move before quickly drifting back into comforting distractions. The car still smelt new, and it was nicer than the old one. The old car smelt of sickly scents that dripped onto you from the dangling pine tree like unpleasant liquids. What was worse was the lingering smell of death that it was trying to cover up. It would still creep up on you occasionally, reminding you of that pet you loved that laid stiff and decaying after an innocent trip to the vet one hot afternoon. Your shoes still gleamed with their newness too. Just the ones you had always wanted. As long as everything still seemed new, everything still seemed good.
<br />     You awoke sharply from an alarming impact. Something was happening second by second, and each second froze to build a storyboard of terror. You felt somehow suspended, and through the rain drops on the window screen you could make out nothing but an approaching darkness. A scream pierced through your senses, blocking all outward expression of your panic. The darkness became you as suddenly you realised you were entering the new depths beyond imagination. 
<br /><br />One by one your senses kicked in with each desperate heartbeat thudding throughout your submerged body. You wished you didn't feel so crushed and trapped but that would soon pass as you became flooded with fear. You could make out familiar blurred lights above you as you floated away from the figures, no longer obscured, but distinct with their glazed looks they always wore. You tried to go back to your life that was falling to the murky riverbed but your body refused. As the harsh air invaded your lungs you still foolishly wanted to go back, but now strong, gentle waves you were dragging you away. You whimpered as headlights faded from view, and the word 'mum' escaped your quivering lips. 
<br /><br />The scene is fragmenting now. You thought you were washed up upon broken crates and stone riddled mud, but you're not. Soft grass now caresses your bare shoulders which no longer ache from struggle. The darkness is no more and warmth is gradually blessing you. You feel apprehension about what awaits if you open your eyes. You wait a moment, sifting through the silence for reassurance. You find tender whispers that brush past you as soft as rose petals. Somewhere between them you hear your name being called, joyfully. Your first glimpse is of a cloud speckled azure sky, so vivid you quickly look away fearing the ache of the constrast, but all feels serene. You're raised so high you think you can feel the clouds brushing against your hair, but it's just the soft breeze telling you everything is okay. With bright new eyes you see a face beaming with pure euphoria, and for a second you barely recognize it without the melancholic eyes. All you can focus on is her dress, long and flowing in a rich scarlet, and the poppies dancing by its side in the same hue. And the smell of it all, all so fresh, all so new.
<br /><br />(haven't checked it so probably some mistakes, point them out maybe? too lazy myself)

<br /><br />There are seven hundred and sixty six ninjas in San Francisco Bay,
<br />Artistically warped and distorted into misinterpretations of suicide squeeze play.
<br />They frolicked in the violet mist of tomorrowâs implications,
<br />Till collapsing and requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
<br /><br />The north and south of decision decided, the Sanfrans resided in residual misguidance,
<br />No external cardiac massage, in their circulating garage, no pulse, thus, dead.
<br /><br />Wallowing in the afterlife of strife they claimed their prize money,
<br />Such a symphony of conscience hidden in a septic tank of the late Frank,
<br />Skinner and Baddiel repeats on eye tee vee, perpetual audiences jeering on the night train.
<br />An extinguished flame in the superficial middle cerebral vein.
<br /><br />No angels in this or any city, nor in Dee Eff Ess on any settee,
<br />Half price, quarter, thought her, the one to prove it all wrong,
<br />Just another guerilla raging against the machine and the Vietcong. 
<br />Oh, um bongo, the song go, every which way but north west,
<br />Resisting arrest in a bulletproof vest.
<br /><br />Saving grace, in the meantime, are the hair metal dwarfs,
<br />Mighty morphinâ, injecting morphine and glycerine.
<br />Wailing presidents reverberating puddles, eating their earnest pudding.
<br /><br />They caught the last bus to Uganda to catch the buggers of propaganda, 
<br />Dozen year to go plus and a bottle of HP, to suppress and oppress the Map of Africa.
<br />Nineteen sixty two said so long and thanks for all the fish and chips,
<br />They had to come to grips to make it home for the lunar eclipse.
<br /><br />Abstract, abstract, abstract, frying fractal pans.
<br /><br />Fifty million spoons at hand to wage war on the phases of the moons,
<br />Silly miscalculations of ancient rulers or just manual binoculars,
<br />Jocular jokers jesting with the best end of the night down the west end,
<br />East end, doors and smiths with their loved ones in comas,
<br />Wheezing on the aromas of the patientâs melanomas.
<br /><br />And, if you went from the Andes to Indies in your undies,
<br />Youâd find the unkempt souls of Peter Pan syndrome sufferers.
<br /><br />Written on the walls we found the secrets to death and glory,
<br />And scrawled on the ceiling, was this shaggy dog story.
<br /><br />-A combination of lyrical inspiration and randomly sought words and pointless word play.

<br />Always pouring,
<br />And there is no doubt,
<br />That the old man is snoring.
<br /><br />Statistics say women are waiting till twenty nine,
<br />And averaging a day two units of wine.
<br />The youth are just a bunch of leachers,
<br />But at least they seem to like their teachers.
<br />Seventy percent of us have a computer,
<br />And probably use a wireless router.
<br />That may be a hint to why we're obese,
<br />And just a hunch, the depression increase.
<br />Yet we still obsess about our five a day,
<br />(Or maybe just lied on that survey).
<br />Being 'green' just invites another lie,
<br />Because a quarter of TVs are still left on standby.
<br />We'd rather go on Facebook than pick up The Sun,
<br />And eighty percent think watching TV is fun!
<br /><br />The numbers, the logic, the truth...or lies?
<br /><br />Cream teas, Big Ben and Shakespeare,
<br />Green, green grass and a nice warm beer.
<br />Perfect reserve and those stiff upper lips,
<br />A national dish of fish and chips.
<br />We love our dogs, and the Queen,
<br />And that nine to five routine.
<br /><br />Nobody really knows how Great Britain really is.
<br />Or how much of a United Kingdom we are.
