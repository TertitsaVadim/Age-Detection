<br />Palma was the first Supreme Court justice who opposed martial law under the late President Ferdinand Marcos, who appointed her to the high court.
<br />“Recent events have led us to a seemingly “one-man rule,” Corona said. in his speech Thursday at the Philippine Women Judges Association at the Manila Hotel.
<br />He called the women judges the new breed of “Cecilia Munoz Palmas” who would continue the fight against dictatorship.
<br />“Judicial independence is being undermined by transient leaders in government.”
<br />“Judiciary must be insulated from political pressure, popularity surveys, coercion from executive and legislative departments,” he added.

<br />Day 29 of the impeachment trial of Chief Justice Renato Corona on Wednesday began with lead defense counsel, Serafin Cuevas, complaining that a document borrowed by private prosecutor Jose Justiniano the other day was missing.
<br />The documents were Cristina Corona’s handwritten letter acknowledging receipt of transfer of certificate titles covering seven parcels of land in Marikina City that she sold to Demetrio Vicente in 1990 for P500,000, and a deed of sale between Vicente and Miriam Roco.
<br />“It was borrowed by lawyer Jose Justiniano. After the trial, the said document has been missing, and has not been returned. We tried to have a talk with Attorney Justiniano but there was no satisfactory explanation,” Cuevas said at the start of the hearing.
<br />Justiniano confirmed borrowing a “bunch of documents” from the defense panel in Tuesday’s hearing, but he said he did not notice that this included the “receipt.”
<br />‘Ethical implications’
<br />He asked for time for the prosecution to locate the document.
<br />Noting that this has “ethical implications,” the presiding officer of the trial, Senate President Juan Ponce Enrile, ordered the prosecution to immediately “look for the document.”
<br />After three hours of hearing, the prosecution could not produce the documents. The prosecutors said the documents could have been placed in one of their cars and asked the driver to bring the car to the Senate. On Senator Franklin Drilon’s manifestation, both prosecution and defense agreed to confer with one another on how to find the documents.
<br />Vicente, 70, a relative of Corona, testified on Tuesday that he purchased the seven parcels of land in Marikina City with a total land area of 1,700 square meters for P509,900 in 1990 from Cristina. He also said he purchased another 1,700 sqm from Cristina’s sister Miriam Roco.
<br />Under cross-examination, Vicente confirmed that the properties were still in Cristina’s name, and so was the tax declaration. He said he had no more money to pay for the transfer of titles. He has been paying real property taxes in Cristina’s name since 1990.
<br />The prosecution produced a certification from a Makati City court showing that the deed of absolute sale between Cristina and Vicente was notarized by an “unlicensed” notary public in 1990. Vicente confirmed that Corona stood as one of the witnesses.
<br />Vicente was the defense witness for the second impeachment article, which accuses Corona of failing to disclose his statements of assets, liabilities and net worth (SALN), and failing to disclose his assets in the SALN.

<br />Ariza told FightHype.com Tuesday that he is leaving for Manila Wednesday night, arriving Friday morning, to chart Pacquiao’s training regimen for his defense of the World Boxing Organization welterweight crown against Bradley in Las Vegas, Nevada, on June 10.
<br />Bradley holds the WBO light welterweight belt.
<br />Inactive since his majority decision victory over Mexican warrior Juan Manuel Marquez last Nov. 12, Pacquiao wants to build up his stamina first before fine-tuning his skills and reflexes for the eight-week training camp set in Baguio City and later in Hollywood.
<br />According to Ariza, he will be returning to the United States in the third week of April to help Julio Chavez Jr. in his preparation for a showdown with Martin Murray on June 16.
<br />Hall of Fame trainer Freddie Roach is expected to plane in before the month ends to supervise Pacquiao’s workouts and sparring sessions.
<br />The unbeaten Bradley has actually started light training, according to Top Rank big boss Bob Arum, who promotes both Pacquiao and Bradley.

<br />Pacquiao, regarded as the world’s best pound-for-pound fighter, told radio station DZMM in an interview also broadcast over the channel’s Teleradyo TV show, that he had decided to give up all his vices after the dream.
<br />“I will not stay long in boxing because He said: ‘You have done enough. You have made yourself famous but this is harmful,’” said a serious-looking Pacquiao, who has won eight titles in as many weight divisions.
<br />Pacquiao, 33, said he had the dream earlier this year but declined to reveal how many more fights he would contest before stepping down.
<br />But when asked if his newfound religious fervor would hurt his boxing, Pacquiao replied: “I will do my work inside the ring.”
<br />The boxer, who has translated his sports fame into huge riches, a show-biz career and election to congress, said he believed he had been chosen by God to use his fame to spread the Christian message.
<br />“When I speak, a lot of people listen,” he said.
<br />He said he would make a major announcement on a religious note later this month.
<br />Pacquiao, who has a 54-3 win-loss record with two draws, stakes his World Boxing Organization welterweight crown against undefeated American Timothy Bradley in Las Vegas on June 9.
<br />Mayweather and Pacquiao have never had a fight and boxing fans have long sought a matchup. The pair were in negotiations for a mega-fight to be held later this year but talks fell through.
<br />Formerly a heavy gambler who was fond of late-night parties, Pacquiao announced in January that he had become a changed man after his religious vision.

<br />Of late, Roach’s crystal ball gazing had turned blurry with Pacquiao unable to stop his last four victims.
<br />Roach hopes Pacquiao will finally return to his explosive, fiery attacking ways and knock unbeaten American Timothy Bradley out when they tangle on June 9 for the Filipino’s World Boxing Council welterweight crown.
<br />“I think Manny will have a spectacular win. The fans want to see a knockout. I want to see a knockout,” Roach told Boxingtalk.com.”
<br />The reason for Roach’s optimism is the fighting style of Bradley, the WBC light welterweight champion.
<br />“Bradley is aggressive; he comes to fight and will be fighting until the end but I think Manny will catch him coming in, and knock him out in the later rounds.”
<br />Pacquiao, of course, thrives against fighters in the mold of Bradley.
<br />In 2009, Pacquiao knocked out a charging Ricky Hatton in two rounds then halted Miguel Cotto in the 12th round.
<br />After that, Joshua Clottey and Antonio Margarito in 2010 and Shane Mosley and Juan Manuel Marquez last year were all able to last the distance against Pacquiao, putting some doubt on his punching power.
<br />Roach wants his prized ward to prove that he’s still at the top of his game.
<br />Meanwhile, promoter Rex “Wakee” Salud, a trusted friend of Pacquiao, belied reports originating from the Daily Mail stating that Pacquiao is offering Floyd Mayweather Jr. a 70-30 split, with the differential 40 percent going to the winner.
<br />“That’s impossible,” Salud said. “It would be greatly disadvantageous to the loser.”
<br />According to Salud, the ideal is 55-45 split with the winner getting the extra 10 percent.

<br />The nationwide survey was conducted from Feb. 26 to March 9 before lawyers of Corona started presenting their evidence in the Senate impeachment court.
<br />Of the 1,200 respondents, 47 percent said Corona was guilty while 43 percent were undecided. Only 5 percent believed Corona was innocent. Another 5 percent said they didn’t have enough basis to make a decision.
<br />The noncommissioned survey used face-to-face interviews and had a margin of error of plus-or-minus 3 percentage points at the 95-percent confidence level. Estimates for Metro Manila, the rest of Luzon, the Visayas and Mindanao had a margin of error of plus-or-minus 6 percentage points.
<br />Sixty-six percent of the respondents who said Corona was guilty formed their opinion in the course of the impeachment trial, while 34 percent said their opinion was formed even before the trial began.
<br />Among the regions, Mindanao accounted for the biggest percentage of respondents (54 percent) who found Corona guilty. Corona was also found guilty by the majority of those in the socioeconomic class ABC (52 percent).
<br />Half of the respondents in Metro Manila said the Chief Justice was guilty. The same opinion was shared by 48 percent of the respondents in Luzon outside the metropolis, 37 percent in the Visayas, 48 percent among Class D and 45 percent among Class E.
<br />When broken down, those who said Corona was innocent were as follows: 1 percent among Class ABC; 3 percent among Class E and in the rest of Luzon; 4 percent in Metro Manila and the Visayas; 6 percent among Class D and 9 percent in Mindanao.
<br />Those who could not say whether Corona was guilty ranged from 31 percent to 48 percent across all geographic areas and socioeconomic classes.

<br />Sen. Joker Arroyo on Tuesday raised this question, noting that the law requiring public officials to file SALNs allows the correction of errors in their declarations.
<br />Arroyo noted that prosecutors were attempting to pin Corona down for culpable violation of the Constitution and betrayal of public trust for allegedly failing to include several high-end properties in his SALN.
<br />“Does the filing of wrong entries amount to an impeachable offense? That is a question that will confront the senators at the moment of truth,” Arroyo said in a phone interview.
<br />“If wrong SALN entries constitute an offense, is it elevated to a level that would merit (Corona’s) removal from public office or is it just an ordinary misdemeanor? We note that not every offense is impeachable, like jaywalking or a little slander,” he added.

Reyes, his mayor-brother and a former provincial administrator in connection with last year’s killing of environmentalist-broadcaster Gerardo “Doc Gerry” Ortega here.
<br />Reyes was charged with murder, along with Mayor Mario Reyes of Coron town in northern Palawan, and lawyer Romeo Seratubias, who served as the former governor’s provincial administrator,  following a reinvestigation of the case by the Department of Justice (DOJ) in Manila.
<br />Judge Angelo Arizala of the Palawan  Regional Trial Court (RTC) issued the arrest warrants against them and denied their lawyer’s motion for bail.
<br />Ortega, a staunch critic of  Reyes and incumbent Governor Abraham Kahlil Mitra, was gunned down inside a used clothes store on Jan. 24, 2011. The alleged triggerman, Marlon Recamata, was captured immediately.
<br />In Manila, Justice Secretary Leila de Lima directed the Bureau of Immigration to be on the “lookout” for Reyes, his brother, Seratubias, and his former staff members, Arturo Regalado and Percival Lecias, who were the alleged contacts of Ortega’s killers from Quezon.
<br />“It won’t prevent them from leaving. But at least we would know about their plan to depart from the Philippines,” De Lima said in a text message.
<br />Ortega’s widow, Patria Gloria, expressed relief at Arizala’s issuance of the arrest warrants.
<br />“We have been waiting for this opportunity to face Joel Reyes in court. He has managed to get a pass for over a year because of his sheer clout and influence. We ask him now to submit to the mighty rule of law and face this case squarely,” she said.

<br />Senators Aquilino Pimentel III and Francis Pangilinan on Tuesday pointed out that the defense was already presenting its evidence, which began after the prosecution had rested its case.
<br />In resting its case, the prosecution reserved the right to present evidence on Corona’s dollar deposits. Philippine Savings Bank has petitioned the Supreme Court to prevent the impeachment court from scrutinizing the Chief Justice’s account.
<br />“To reopen the case after the prosecution rested would be a long shot, especially when the property is not even in the name of the respondent,” Pimentel told the Philippine Daily Inquirer in a phone interview.
<br />“In basketball, it would not only be a half-court shot, but a shot all the way from the other end of the court.”
<br />The issue of admitting new evidence for the prosecution surfaced after a blogger reported on a California property bought by Corona’s daughter Maria Charina, a physical therapist in the United States.

<br />The Filipino eight-division world champion said he is now willing to accept a lesser guaranteed purse just to seal a fight with the unbeaten American.
<br />Pacquiao, however, insisted that the pay- per-view revenues be split equally.
<br />“It’s fine with me if he has a bigger guaranteed purse,” Pacquiao told ANC Headstart in Filipino yesterday. “There’s no problem as long as we have a 50-50 split on the PPV.”
<br />Pacquiao scoffed at Mayweather’s earlier offer of $40 million with no PPV share and made a counter offer of 45-45 sharing with the remaining 10 percent going to the winner of the fight.
<br />Mayweather rejected the offer and instead booked a showdown with Puerto Rican Miguel Cotto on May 5, forcing Pacquiao to stake his crown against unbeaten WBO light welterweight champion Timothy Bradley on June 9.
<br />Pacquiao said he is willing to fight Mayweather any time and it is up to his pound-for-pound rival to seal the deal that could reward each fighter with at least $50 million.
<br />Pacquiao also disclosed that Mayweather’s reluctance to agree to an equal sharing stems from the possibility that he might suffer a first, career-derailing defeat.
<br />Mayweather reportedly told a member of his team that Pacquiao, being a congressman (of Sarangani province), has a fallback position while he has none.
<br />Meanwhile, Pacquiao was guest of honor at the well-attended 12th Gabriel “Flash” Elorde Banquet of Champions held Sunday night at the Dusit Thani Hotel in Makati City.
<br />In his speech, Pacquiao, who was feted for his outreach program, enjoined his fellow boxers, including former world champion Rolando Navarette and former world contender Z Gorres, to continue pursuing their dreams for the country’s glory.
<br />Also present was former light welterweight champion Amir Khan, who will join Pacquiao’s training camp in Baguio City.
<br />In one of the pre-event bouts, Dennis Laurente survived a first-round knockdown to stop Eusebio Baluarte in the 12th round and retain his Philippine welterweight title.

<br /><br />Early Promotions Although the fight is not yet until the end of summer, in June 9, promotions had already started since February. The reason why is because many boxing fans felt that Timothy Bradley, an uplifted boxer, is not a worthy opponent to the Pound-per-Pound King, even though Bradley boasts an undefeated boxing streak throughout his career. 
<br /><br />However, Manny “Pacman” Pacquiao had heavily supported his upcoming fight by stating his challenger’s unbeaten record. However, to make the fight more interesting for boxing fans, Freddie Roach have asked Manny to knock-out Bradley in their fight. This is after his inclination that Pacquiao had become softer after failing to win his last 4 fights with a knock-out. 
<br /><br />Make the Fight more Entertaining Hall-of-fame trainer Freddie Roach longs for the day when Manny Pacquiao would make him look good again by proving his knockout predictions accurate. Of late, Roach’s crystal ball gazing had turned blurry with Pacquiao unable to stop his last four victims.

<br />“The congressman himself is the one fuelling the controversy. We are only answering questions,” BIR Commissioner Kim Henares said.
<br />The eight-time world champion, who is also a member of Congress, faces a criminal case for obstructing a tax investigation into his earnings, in a case that he says has cost him millions of dollars in endorsements.
<br />Henares said the BIR was only asking Pacquiao, one of the world’s highest-paid sportsmen, submit records of his earnings so the agency could assess if he has any unsettled tax liability.
<br />“Those who receive a letter authority are required to submit proofs of account, receipt, contract or IRS payment because we want a realistic assessment whether there is a tax due or not,” Henares said.
<br />Pacquiao on Monday vowed to fight the case in court and accused the BIR of singling him out for harassment, without saying why he was being targeted.
<br />Finance Secretary Cesar Purisima on Tuesday said the government was only doing its job.
<br />“I don’t think the BIR will dare to harass an eight-time world champion. He is a national icon,” Purisima, whose department oversees the bureau, told reporters.
<br />Henares said all that Pacquiao needs to do is submit the needed documents.
<br />“Madali lang naman ang kasong ‘yan. Pag nag-submit ka ng dokumento, mawawala na yang kaso na iyan,” Henares said.
<br />“The sooner he submits, the sooner this controversy will die down. Wala naman kaming sinasabing liability kaya nga ho namin siya iimbestigahan,” she said.
<br />“We have to see the gravity of the violation if there are any. As of now we are not even talking of tax evasion. We are only asking him to submit the documents,” Henares said.
<br />Seen as the world’s best pound for pound boxer, Pacquiao declared assets at the end of 2010 at P1.13 billion and no liabilities, making him the country’s wealthiest member of Congress.
<br />Forbes.com magazine estimated he spent $7 million in his election campaign in 2010 while also earning $35 million for his two fights against Joshua Clottey and Miguel Cotto.
<br />Henares said in 2008, Pacquiao paid about P125 million in taxes but in 2009, he only paid P7-million.
<br />“Bakit bumagsak eh paganda nga nang paganda ang career nya. Hindi s’ya nalalaos,” Henares added.
<br />Pacquiao, who has a 54-3 win-loss record with two draws, stakes his World Boxing Organization welterweight crown against undefeated American Timothy Bradley in Las Vegas on June 9.

No deadly waves or serious damage resulted, and a watch for much of the Indian Ocean was lifted after a few hours.
<br />Women and children cried in Aceh, where memories are still raw of a 2004 tsunami that killed 170,000 people in the province alone. Others screamed “God is great” as they poured from their homes or searched frantically for separated family members.
<br />Patients were wheeled out of hospitals, some still lying in their beds with drips attached to their arms. And at least one hotel guest was slightly injured when he jumped out of his window.
<br />The U.S. Geological Survey said the first 8.6-magnitude quake was a shallow 22 kilometers (14 miles), hitting in the sea 270 miles (435 kilometers) from Aceh’s provincial capital.
<br />An alert that followed from the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Hawaii advised countries all along the rim of the Indian Ocean, from Australia and India to as far off as Africa, that a seismically charged wave could head their way.
<br />Two deadly tsunamis in the last decade — the most recent off Japan just one year ago — have left the world much better prepared.
<br />Sirens sounded along coastlines and warnings spread like wildfire by mobile phone text messaging. Though often chaotic, evacuations began immediately with streets clogged with traffic, especially in Aceh.
<br />The only wave to hit, though, was less than 30 inches (80 centimeters) high, rolling to Indonesia’s emptied coastline.
<br />Just as the region was sighing relief, an 8.2-magnitude aftershock followed.
<br />“We just issued another tsunami warning,” Prih Harjadi, from Indonesia’s geophysics agency, told TVOne in a live interview.
<br />He told his countrymen to stay clear of western coasts.
<br />Residents in Aceh could hardly believe it.
<br />“What did we do to deserve this?” cried Aisyah Husaini, 47, who lost both her parents and a son in the 2004 tsunami. “What sins have we committed?”
<br />“I’m so scared, I don’t want to lose my family again,” she said, clinging to her two children in a mosque in Banda Aceh, where hundreds of people sheltered.
<br />Again, though, the threat quickly passed.
<br />Experts said Wednesday’s quakes did not have the potential to create massive tsunamis because the friction and shaking occurred horizontally, not vertically. The earth’s tectonic plates slid against each other, creating more of a vibration in the water.
<br />In contrast, mega-thrust quakes cause the seabed to rise or drop vertically, displacing massive amounts of water and sending towering waves racing across the ocean at jetliner speeds.
<br />Roger Musson, seismologist at the British geological survey who has studied Sumatra’s fault lines, said initially he’d been “fearing the worst.”
<br />“But as soon as I discovered what type of earthquake it was … I felt a lot better.”
<br />The tremors were felt in neighboring Malaysia, where high-rise buildings shook, and Thailand, India and Bangladesh.
<br />Those countries, Sri Lanka and the Maldives evacuated buildings and beaches and readied relief efforts in case of disaster.
<br />The World Meteorological Organization said communication systems set up after the 2004 tsunami appeared to have worked well.
<br />“Our records indicate that all the national meteorological services in the countries at risk by this tsunami have received the warnings in under five minutes,” said Maryam Golnaraghi, the head of WMO’s disaster risk reduction program.
<br />The alert was sent out by U.S. National Weather Service, which operates a tsunami warning station in Hawaii, she said.
<br />Indonesia straddles a series of fault lines that makes the vast island nation prone to volcanic and seismic activity.
<br />The giant 9.1-magnitude quake and tsunami on Dec. 26, 2004, killed 230,000 people in about a dozen nations.

<br />Alex Ariza has made it clear he was not impressed with Pacquiao’s last two fights, against faded Shane Mosley and perennial nemesis Juan Manuel Marquez.
<br />Well, if Pacquiao had, say, been happy enough with his big bore of a bout with Mosley, there’s no way the national boxing superhero should be proud of his pedestrian performance against Marquez.
<br />* * *
<br />The tempestuous, magical Pacquiao was nowhere inside the ring in Las Vegas last November.
<br />The Pacquiao that got manhandled by Marquez was both tame and predictable.
<br />If the old magical Pacquiao had really been there, Marquez would’ve not cried “robbery.”
<br />If it was the original stormy Pacman who had waged war against Marquez, the hugely contested points win would have never occurred.
<br />* * *
<br />They can’t afford a bad camp, swore Ariza, in the process bringing out in the open that, despite brags to the contrary, the training Pacquiao did against Marquez was anything but ideal.
<br />Who was to blame?
<br />Quite a number, but Ariza said he hopes Pacquiao’s extra-curricular commitments don’t come in the way again.
<br />In short, it’s all up to Pacquiao to manage his time; it’s all up to him to regain total focus.
<br />Pacquiao, in short, can’t afford to lose to himself again.
<br />* * *
<br />That’s warning No. 1.
<br />If the Ariza sermon sounded every word significant and valid, you’re free to debunk this next one as mere mumbo-jumbo.
<br />Listen please.
<br />If you bothered to count back, it would show that Pacquiao’s forthcoming fight against Bradley will be his 16th bout since last losing to Erik Morales.
<br />Sorry, but there’s something ominous about that number.
<br />* * *
<br />Chronicler Marv Dumon of the International Boxing Examiner has noted that, since Pacquiao’s first pro loss to “Rustico Torrecampo in 1996, he has lost every 16th bout thereafter.”
<br />For the record, Dumon continued, Pacquiao was stopped by Medgoen (3-K Battery) Singsurat in September 1999 to lose the WBC flyweight crown.
<br />That defeat coincided with Pacquiao’s 16th fight since first losing to Torrecampo.
<br />* * *
<br />Pacquiao moved up in weight and went on to win the IBF super bantamweight crown.
<br />He had a string of sensational fights, including the first bout with Marquez which was declared a draw in May 2002.
<br />In March 2005, Pacquiao would lose a bloody bout against Eric Morales, which also happened to be Pacman’s 16th fight since losing his flyweight crown in Thailand in 1999.
<br />* * *
<br />Going straight to the point, Dumon repeated that Pacquiao’s June meeting with Bradley will be his 16th bout since that sensational losing stand against Morales in 2005.
<br />Dumon naturally smells a bad omen in the No. 16.
<br />“Don’t send me the congratulatory e-mail,” he said. “I accidentally stumbled upon this insight through a blog post.”
<br />Dumon, with an MPA degree from the University of Texas at Austin, writes on a range of subjects, social media, sports, gambling, business and politics.

<br />(GOODBYE ALING ORIANG: Gloria Licad Lanot, favorite dinner host of National Artists Nick Joaquin and Andrea O. Veneracion, beloved aunt of the celebrated concert pianist Cecille Licad and mother-in-law of poet Pete Lacaba (married to Marra Lanot), has passed on. She was 94. She lies in state at the St. Peter Memorial Chapel on Quezon Ave., Quezon City and will be interred tomorrow, Friday, at the Loyola Memorial Park, Marikina. It will never be the same again. Prayers please for her eternal peace in the Valley of the Lord.)

And, chances are, it will no longer be staged in LasVegas but in Marquez’s turf— Mexico City.
<br />Fernando Beltran of Zanfer Promotions, which manages Marquez, told Miguel Rivera of BoxingScene.com Wednesday (Thursday in Manila) that his group has initiated discussions with Pacquiao’s representatives and these “have gone well.”
<br />“Having (the fight in Mexico) is not being viewed as a bad thing,” said Beltran. “There are many benefits to having the Pacquiao fight made there.”
<br />Beltran is said to be so enamored with Pacquiao-Marquez IV that he has vowed to bring the showdown—projected to be held in Nov-ember—to the spanking-new Arena Mexico.
<br />The indoor Arena has a maximum capacity of 22,300 although it can only accommodate 16,500 when reconfigured for a boxing event.
<br />In their first fight in 2004, Marquez survived three first-round knockdowns to salvage a draw with Pacquiao, who won the return bout in 2008 by split decision on the strength of a third-round knockdown.
<br />Last November, Pacquiao repeated over  Marquez by majority decision.
<br />Beltran believes that Mexico, the boxing fans, and Marquez deserve the final battle with Pacquiao, who is well-loved in the country despite his tag as “Mexican assassin.”

<br />“Well, right now, we’re not planning to put him (Alejandro) in the lineup yet for (the upcoming UAAP season),” Altamirano said. “Bata pa s’ya (He’s still young), so we try to give him time to mature first, and hopefully next year, he’ll be part of the team.”
<br />NU secured a commitment from the 6-foot guard Alejandro last February. He led the Malayan High School Red Robins last year to a fifth-place finish at the NCAA juniors division while averaging league-best 25.4 points, 4.7 rebounds, 4.4 assists and 1.8 steals.
<br />He was named as the team captain of the Energen Pilipinas Under-16 team, which finished fourth in the 2011 FIBA Asia Under-16 Championships in Nha Trang, Vietnam, last October, where he once scored 34 against Japan in the second round of the tournament.

<br />Ranidel de Ocampo and Jimmy Alapag, silent for most of last night, drilled the baskets that mattered when the outcome was in the balance as the Tropang Texters tripped Barako Bull, 101-90, to enter the PBA Commissioner’s Cup Finals at the Smart Araneta Coliseum.
<br />De Ocampo and Alapag combined for 11 critical points in the stretch that held off the Energy as the rubber match of this best-of-five series went down the wire.
<br />The Texters advanced against the B-Meg  Llamados, who made the best-of-seven title  series on Tuesday after a 108-84 win over Barangay Ginebra and a 3-1 triumph.
<br />“In the end, it’s about making the shots that matter. Jimmy’s triple and Ranidel’s four-point play. That’s how it is,” coach Chot Reyes, who will make the 15th title series appearance of his career, said.
<br />“We had no illusions about the other team. We knew they were going to be very good,” Reyes said. “In the finals (against B-Meg), it will be that way again.”
<br />The only two times in this series that the results weren’t blowouts were games won by the Energy, as their veterans carried the fight in the stretch.
<br />It was De Ocampo and Alapag’s turn last night for the Texters, whose first two wins in the series were by an average of  23 points.
<br />Alapag first drained a triple from close to 30 feet, and after the Energy had come to within four points heading into the final three minutes, De Ocampo completed a rare four-point play that kept the Texters’ heads above water, 96-88.
<br />The reigning MVP Alapag then had an unmolested lay-up and De Ocampo sewed it all up for the Texters with two free throws with 60 seconds remaining for a 100-90 lead.
<br />Donnell Harvey led the Texters with 29 points, 14 rebounds and three steals and De Ocampo finished with 18 that went with seven boards.
<br />Reyes said Alapag shouldn’t have even played. Alapag’s father is battling cancer and his brother just suffered a stroke a day before the series started.
<br />The scores:
<br />TALK N’ TEXT 101—Harvey 29, De Ocampo 18, Dillinger 14, Castro 14, Williams 9, Peek 7, Alapag 6, Fonacier 3, Reyes 1, Alvarez 0.
<br />BARAKO 90—Freeman 22, Seigle 21, Tubid 18, Allado 12, Miller 6, Salvador 4, Najorda 3, Arboleda 2, Pena 2, Weinstein 0, Pennisi 0.
<br />Quarters: 25-27, 56-47, 77-74, 101-90

		<document id="4fc59338f8292cce4369b4ed87bcf204" url=""><![CDATA[Getting started on Running!<br/><br/>Running is one of the most popular forms of exercise that anyone of any age can do and achieve. However, there are a number of instances in which those who have made running not only as a simple exercise, but also their life, have had to stop running to give more time on other aspects of their life. One of those was Triathlete Ani De Leon-Brown, who has been an active runner for all her life, until she got pregnant. 
<br /><br />How to Get Back on Running According to Ani, a 10K used to be an “easy run,” but three months after giving birth, she could hardly run for four minutes straight. However, it was not the end for her running career. 
<br /><br />“It was very hard for me to get back to my former speed. My first run was just four minutes, and the next was 10. After three days, I was able to complete 10 minutes, then 15,” she explained. “The thing with running is you have to slug it out for the first two weeks, then it will get better—and you will feel better,” Ani said. 
<br /><br />Getting Started on your Journey Although many may prefer other forms of exercises, such as aerobics, sports such as boxing, cycling, swimming, and even Yoga, many have also chosen running as their preferred exercise to maintain their healthy lifestyle, according to many <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2xpZmVzdHlsZS5pbnF1aXJlci5uZXQvY2F0ZWdvcnkvd2VsbG5lc3M_" target="_blank">Wellness Philippines</a> experts. The reason why is because of its simplicity, and that anyone, either young or old, can get active in running. What matters is starting it. 
<br /><br />Kids can be “programmed” at an early age, said Ani, while it’s more of mental and physical conditioning for adults. “I know it is very hard to get up very in the morning, so it is best to join a group so that you can follow a training time and routine.” 
<br /><br />Ani, also a coach and trainer, said you have to set realistic goals, and then work on how to sustain it. Her tip: Work around your schedule, find time within your work and family life, identify goal rate, and slowly build up your runs around it. Prioritize. Being too busy is not an excuse, because “if you want it hard enough you will find a way.” 
<br /><br />Ani is one of the partner athletes in Unilab’s Active Health campaign, according to <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2xpZmVzdHlsZS5pbnF1aXJlci5uZXQv" target="_blank">Philippines Lifestyle</a> news. She and husband Dan, runners Rio del Rosario and Jaymie Pizarro, and cyclist Raul Cuevas recently gave a talk on how to start and stay active. The event, held at Holiday Inn Galleria in Ortigas, Pasig, also introduced Unilab’s lineup of sports activities for the year.

		<document id="89040a903766cf0a7cd3656c70faab48" url=""><![CDATA[Complete Acquittal from the Articles<br/><br/>As the Impeachment Trial of Chief Justice Renato Corona continuous, more and more articles are being withdrawn from the prosecution due to the lack of supporting evidences which will point to the Chief Justice’s involvement in many of his allegations. 
<br /><br />However, a mere withdrawal of 5 out of 9 articles is not enough for the defense to ensure that the same articles would not be used again. And so the camp of the Chief Justice plans to seek acquittal of not just one article, but all 5 articles of impeachment filed against him by the prosecution. 
<br /><br />Complete Acquittal from the Articles Corona’s lawyer, Ramon Esguerra, feared that if Articles 1, 4, 5, 6 and 8 were simply withdrawn “without prejudice,” then the allegations contained in the articles could be used again in filing another impeachment case against the Chief Justice after the one-year ban for filing lapses. 
<br /><br />“[If it is] dismissed with prejudice, I think we can agree with that…They can’t refile anything on this five articles anymore…If it will amount to an acquittal, then that’s fine with us. But if you’re saying: No, we’re withdrawing this without prejudice to refiling them from December or after the one year, that’s different. How can we agree to that?” Esguerra said over a phone interview on Wednesday. 
<br /><br />For this reason, Esguerra said the defense team would first seek a clarification from the prosecution team whether they were withdrawing the five articles with or without prejudice. 
<br /><br />And if the prosecution team decides to withdraw the allegations without prejudice, then Corona’s camp will present evidence to seek the acquittal of the Chief Justice on the five articles of impeachment. 
<br /><br />“We might as well present evidence on the five articles so that there will also be a ruling ultimately by the Senate sitting as an impeachment court on the five articles not only the three. That’s just fair,” he said. 
<br />“You can’t just go to court and say: You know, I’m accusing you of 10 counts but I’m withdrawing nine [and] I will stick to one,” Esguerra added. 
<br /><br />According to latest <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5pbnF1aXJlci5uZXQv" target="_blank">Philippines Current Events</a>, this statement was submitted after the prosecution rested its case against Corona after presenting only evidence and witnesses for only three of eight articles in the impeachment complaint. 
<br /><br />According to <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5pbnF1aXJlci5uZXQv" target="_blank">Philippines News Today</a>, the three articles submitted for decision to the Senate impeachment court were Article II pertaining to Corona’s alleged non-disclosure of statement of assets, liabilities and net worth, Article III on his alleged lack of proven competence, probity, integrity and independence and Article VII pertaining to his alleged “partiality” in the granting of a temporary restraining order on the government’s watchlist order against former President and now Pampanga Representative Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo last November 15.

Though we all think that losing weight is good for our health, taking it too extreme may not be as healthy as we think. This is the reason why we all must first love ourselves and our bodies before we undergo weight-loss regimens. 
<br />Loving Your Body Exercising and eating right to achieve a healthy weight are major goals for an improved lifestyle. But exercising and dieting to the point of compromising one’s health, relationships, self-esteem and even life will never solve your body issues. 
<br /><br />In the Jan. 4, 2005, issue of the New York Times, according to latest <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2xpZmVzdHlsZS5pbnF1aXJlci5uZXQvY2F0ZWdvcnkvd2VsbG5lc3M_" target="_blank">Wellness Philippines</a> news, it was reported that 19 percent of overweight people would risk their life to be thin, while 33 percent of obese people and 4 percent of normal-weight people would do the same to lose 10 pounds. Meanwhile, 31 percent of obese people would trade up to five percent of their remaining years to be 10 percent thinner. 
<br /><br />Unrealistic weight goals are manifestations of a poor body image, and have been linked to serious health problems. Body image is the way you picture your own body. According to studies, the way we see our body is the effect of what we see in the environment, like the underweight models in magazines, dieting friends, thin celebrities, influential people like athletes and coaches, and even parents who are obsessed with dieting. 
<br /><br />Recognizing Your Body Issues Recognize your body issues. According to latest <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2xpZmVzdHlsZS5pbnF1aXJlci5uZXQv" target="_blank">Philippines Lifestyle</a> news, before setting off in your goal of losing weight, you might have to consult a mental health specialist or a counselor, or even get more support by talking to your family and loved ones if you experience the following: 
<br /><br />1.) You worry too much about your appearance even if you look fine and your weight is just right for your height. 
<br /><br />2.) You spend a lot of time thinking of how to be thin, you are never content with your body, and you keep criticizing yourself. 
<br /><br />3.) You are always negatively affected by others’ looks and weight. 
<br /><br />4.) You are willing to spend just to lose weight or improve your appearance in the fastest possible way. 
<br />5.) You can take weight loss to the extreme by dieting and/or exercising as much as you can endure.

This path, however, is not without any challenges, and that Powerade will still have to face its greatest challenges. 
<br /><br />With their offense clicking, the Tigers pummeled the Air21 Express, 121-92, Sunday night, but somehow, things still aren’t as easy as it looks for Powerade. The team sits on third place at 4-3 with two games left in the elimination round. 
<br /><br />Powerade’s Toughest Challenges Yet “Looking ahead, it’s really going to be down-the wire towards the last two games that we have, we have to win at least one, better if two,” said Powerade mentor Bo Perasol. Though it may seem easy, actually doing it and achieving their goal is not as easy as the Tigers perhaps have the hardest last two games among the remaining squads left vying for a playoff spot. 
<br /><br />According to latest <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3Nwb3J0cy5pbnF1aXJlci5uZXQvY2F0ZWdvcnkvc2VjdGlvbi9iYXNrZXRiYWxsL3BiYQ__" target="_blank">PBA News</a>, some of the teams that Powerade will still have to face include the Alaska Aces in which the team will battle on Friday, as well as B-Meg, which is currently raring to bounce back after losing to Rain or Shine. 
<br /><br />“For all the distractions, it was really difficult for us to focus but they still believe that we really have what it takes to win in this tournament,” Perasol said. 
<br /><br />“So they just played together. I challenged them that the little things are going to matter in this game. I think they responded well to the challenge but there’s still so much difficulty ahead in those last two games,” added Perasol. 
<br /><br />The Tigers played minus immense pressure last conference as the team went all the way to the Finals before losing to the Talk ‘N Text Tropang Texters in five games. This time’s different, however, according to <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3Nwb3J0cy5pbnF1aXJlci5uZXQvdWFhcC1sYXRlc3QtdXBkYXRlcw__" target="_blank">UAAP News</a>. After that successful run, the expectation rose and now, perhaps anything short of a finals berth is a failure. 
<br /><br />Pressure is Good for the Team For Perasol, pressure is a good thing. “I’m okay with pressure. Pressure is for the better. It’s a challenge for us to be better. We just have to do what we can with what we have,” Perasol said. 
<br /><br />And what they have with scoring maching Gary David and prized rookies Marcio Lassiter and JV Casio are vital pieces not every team has. 
<br /><br />“No question Gary David is the best scorer today if he wants to he can score but it all boils down again if are we going to win with those kinds of numbers. Is he going to share, which he did (tonight),” Perasol told INQUIRER.net.

<br /><br />Rain or Shine Shining through B-Meg Lefty marksman Jeff Chan shot 10 of his 19 points in the final quarter as Rain or Shine stunned B-Meg, 101-95, Wednesday night in the 37th PBA Commissioner’s Cup at the Smart Araneta Coliseum. The win kept the Elasto Painters’ quarterfinal bid alive.
<br /><br />According to latest <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3Nwb3J0cy5pbnF1aXJlci5uZXQvY2F0ZWdvcnkvc2VjdGlvbi9iYXNrZXRiYWxsL3BiYQ__" target="_blank">PBA News</a>, import Duke Crews had 24 points but had 20 cracks and only made nine. Crews also grabbed 16 rebounds. Rain or Shine bucked a 38-point explosion from the Llamados’ reinforcement Denzel Bowles, who had 15 markers in the final quarter alone. 
<br /><br />B-Meg, on the other hand, remained in second place at 5-3 but blew its opportunity to seize an outright semifinals berth. 
<br /><br />Barako Bulls Whipping Petron Blaze As two of the most prominent teams in PBA, the battle between Barako Bulls and Petron Blaze had become a scorcher when the Barako Bulls bulled its way across the field and landed its win against Petron Blaze. 
<br /><br />Rodney White fired 41 points and had 22 rebounds and Mick Pennisi stole the show with a classic comical act way before Barako Bull routed Petron Blaze, 94-80, which kept the Energy in the hunt for a quarterfinal berth in the PBA Commissioner’s Cup. 
<br /><br />White, who chalked up the season’s first triple double of 18 points, 12 rebounds and 11 assists in an 89-82 victory over Meralco last Saturday, was virtually unstoppable as the Energy rose to 4-4, now tied for fifth overall. 
<br /><br />New Petron import Will McDonald got tossed out of the court with 8:45 left in the second period after he threw the ball to the head of Pennisi, who did a good overacting job—although way delayed—of falling to the floor after the incident, eliciting laughter from both benches and the Smart Araneta Coliseum crowd. 
<br />Pennisi’s antic already trended on Twitter and was getting numerous hits on YouTube and more than that, even Barako Bull coach Junel Baculi said “the flop” helped his team, without taking credit away from his players who played their hearts out. 
<br /><br />“I was surprised at how their (Petron) import acted, and we were lucky that he got thrown out,” Baculi told reporters. “It would have been a different story had he been around to finish the game.” 
<br /><br />All-Star Game Top Bets Perennial MVP contender Arwind Santos of Petron Blaze and crack rookie JV Casio of Powerade are the early frontrunners for starting spots in the Veterans and Rookies, Sophomores, Juniors team for this year’s PBA All-Star Game. 
<br /><br />According to <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3Nwb3J0cy5pbnF1aXJlci5uZXQvdWFhcC1sYXRlc3QtdXBkYXRlcw__" target="_blank">UAAP News</a>, fans have another week to select members of the Veterans and RSJ sides, which will be mentored by Chot Reyes of Talk ‘N Text and Powerade’s Bo Perasol, respectively. The Event is set May 10 to 13 in Laoag City.

<br /><br />Early Promotions Although the fight is not yet until the end of summer, in June 9, promotions had already started since February. The reason why is because many boxing fans felt that Timothy Bradley, an uplifted boxer, is not a worthy opponent to the Pound-per-Pound King, even though Bradley boasts an undefeated boxing streak throughout his career. 
<br /><br />However, Manny “Pacman” Pacquiao had heavily supported his upcoming fight by stating his challenger’s unbeaten record. However, to make the fight more interesting for boxing fans, Freddie Roach have asked Manny to knock-out Bradley in their fight. This is after his inclination that Pacquiao had become softer after failing to win his last 4 fights with a knock-out. 
<br /><br />Make the Fight more Entertaining Hall-of-fame trainer Freddie Roach longs for the day when Manny Pacquiao would make him look good again by proving his knockout predictions accurate.
