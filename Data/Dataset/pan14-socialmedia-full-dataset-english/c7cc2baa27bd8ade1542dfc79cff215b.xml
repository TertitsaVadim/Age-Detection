<br /><br />Its senior year...
<br /><br />the day before prom...she walked to my locker... &quot;my date is sick&quot; she said...he's not going to go... well...i didnt have a date and in 7th grade...we made a promise that if neither of us had dates...we'd go together just as &quot;best friends&quot;...and so we did...
<br /><br />Its prom night...
<br /><br />after everything was over with...i was standing at her front door step...i stared at her...she smiled at me...i wanted her to be mine...but she doesnt think of me like that...and i know it...then she said &quot;i had the best time...thanks!&quot; ... and she gave me a kiss on the cheek...i wanted to tell her...i wanted her to know that i dont want to be &quot;just friends&quot;... i love her but i'm just too shy... and i dont know why...

A church that she is getting married in now... i watched her say &quot;i do&quot; and drive off to her new life... married to another man... i wanted her to be mine... but she didnt see me like that... and i knew it... but before she drove away... she came to me and said &quot;you came!... Thanks!&quot;... and she kissed me on the cheek... i wanted to tell her... i wanted her to know that i didnt want to be &quot;just friends&quot;... i love her but i'm just too shy... and i dont know why... 
<br /><br />Years passed...
<br /><br />I looked down at the coffin of a girl who used to be my &quot;best friend&quot;... at the service they read a diary entry she had wrote in her high school years... this is what it said... &quot;I stare at him wishing he was mine, but he doesnt notice me like thatand i know it. i wanted to tell him, i wanted him to know that i dont want to be &quot;just friends&quot; i love him but im just too shy, and i dont know why. i wish he would tell me he loved me&quot;... i wish i did too... i thought to myself and i cried...

Somehow you lived without them your whole life and after they've taken your heart its unbelievably hard to live without them. It almost seems as though they put their own lock on your heart and you have to figure out how to get it off. In the end you can try and hate them all you want but somehow the love you have for them always sticks with you.

<br />Boys cry because...
<br /><br />1. Girls screw them over...
<br />2. They just got hit in the balls...
<br />3. They're about to die...
<br />4. Their heart is broken..
<br />5. Because they are true men.
<br /><br />GIRLS: If you see a guy crying, hug him close and hold him up as he gets over the pain of getting kicked in the nuts. Tell him he's not going to die, and if he's crying over a girl... hug him and kiss him and let him know you won't screw him over and break his heart like the last girl did. Guys just want to know that our girls will be there for us to support us when we need them and help us get our mind off the pain of heartbreak, getting kicked in the balls, and knowing we're gonna die.
<br /><br />Girls cry because...
<br /><br />1. They're sad...
<br />2. They're scared...
<br />3. They're nervous...
<br />4. They're frustrated...
<br />5. They're missing someone...
<br />6. They're alone...
<br />7. They're PMSing...
<br />8. They're pregnant..
<br />9. Their heart is broken...
<br />10. They're in love...
<br />11. Their souls have been torn...
<br />12. THEY MET A BOY THEY CANT HAVE...
<br />13. They fell in love with a boy...
<br />14. They hurt so bad inside...
<br />15. They're mad...
<br />16. Something bad happend...
<br />17. JUST BECAUSE THEY FEEL LIKE CRYING
<br /><br />******BOYS: If any girl you know is crying and you see them, don't just stand there and say you're sorry. Hold them and tell them everything will be okay, even if you have no idea what is wrong with them. Girls just want to be held and know that someone cares about them.
<br /><br />Repost this in:
<br /><br />1 minute: you'll be kissed by your lover.
<br /><br />2 minutes: You'll find them in two weeks.
<br /><br />3 minutes: You'll find them in three weeks.
<br /><br />4 minutes: You'll find your true love when you're 90 years old.
<br /><br />5 minutes: You took too damn long and someone else got them.

<br />4:52 PM, Jun. 30, 2011

<br /><br />A Sheboygan County jury on Thursday found an Adell man not guilty of having sexual contact with two young girls several years ago.
<br /><br />Donald W. Arendt, 50, had been charged with two counts of sexual assault of a child under 13 years of age, each of which carries a maximum penalty of 40 years in prison, and one count of intimidation of a victim, a misdemeanor for which he could have been jailed for nine months.
<br /><br />The jury of eight men and four women deliberated for more than six hours Thursday after hearing a day and a half of testimony and closing arguments. 
<br /><br />Arendt, of N1434 Highway 28, was charged in October. 
<br /><br />According to a criminal complaint, one girl, then 17, told a social worker and a Sheboygan police detective last fall that Arendt had sexual contact with her in Sheboygan when she was in kindergarten between September 1998 and June 1999.
<br /><br />When the girl told her younger sister that she was reporting the incident to the police, the younger girl said Arendt had sexually assaulted her, as well, as recently as 2008. 
<br /><br />When the first girl telephoned Arendt about the assaults, he denied any sexual activity and threatened to take legal action against her and her mother, adding that he didn’t think she’d “survive it.”
<br /><br />Assistant District Attorney Joel Urmanski said he was disappointed by the jury’s verdict and said the prosecution’s case would have been helped if he’d been allowed by Judge James Bolgert to introduce evidence that assaults had occurred in other counties and that an expert on delayed disclosure had been allowed to testify.
<br /><br />“We knew going in this would be a difficult case,” he said.
<br /><br />Arendt’s defense attorney, Public Defender June Spoerl, declined to comment.
<br /><br />The girls who leveled the charges left the courtroom in tears when the verdict was read. They and family members declined to comment.

<br />On swings right up into the lucid sky 
<br />Dancing in the warm summer rain 
<br />With your friends laughing with you by your side
<br />Laying in the grass feeling the breeze through your hair
<br />Walking around bare foot feeling the earth touching you
<br />Summer is the time is a time of freedom
<br />The time for fun 
<br />The time to live

Time can not shake it words can not destroy it. All people have faith whether they know it of not. It is as simple as putting trust in a friend or as complex as having faith in god. As we grow older it seems that the faith that we have for the larger things in life seem to be fading. As children we has faith that santa claus would leave presents for us underneath the christmas tree for us. As teenagers we have faith the we will attain your license, get a car and graduate high school. Now that were older we have lost faith in our government, in our leader, in the people around us and most importantly in our self's.Faith is what keeps us going: it's what gets us out of bed in the morning. Life without faith would be no life at all. You don't see the moon during the day but the doesn't mean it isn't there. I think that faith is the strongest word that we humans use.
