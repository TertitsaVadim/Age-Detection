The movie's emphasis on martial arts as a means of emotional and spiritual development created a sensation. Audiences saw Daniel learn as much about life as about karate through Mr. Miyagi's gentle but firm training. Parents liked what they saw, and the demand for children's martial arts exploded.<br /><br />A new version of &quot;The Karate Kid&quot; will be released on June 11, 2010. In the new version, the characters' names are different (Daniel and Mr. Miyagi become Dre and Mr. Han), the action takes place in Beijing instead of Los Angeles, and the Dre learns Chinese kung fu instead of Japanese karate. However, the plot is virtually identical to that of the 1984 film: a young hero learns martial arts so he can defend himself against bullies, and in the process becomes a better person and learns some important life lessons.<br /><br />Millions of people will watch the new movie this month, and will be attracted to its portrayal of martial arts. Both the 1984 and the 2010 versions of &quot;The Karate Kid&quot; reflect the positive message of what traditional martial arts training really is. This message can be summarized in five lessons:<br /><br />Lesson #1: Courtesy. As Dre bonds with Mr. Han, they practice common courtesy, which leads to mutual respect. Dre learns that by submitting to Mr. Han's instruction, he will become skilled more quickly. His rebellious attitude also softens toward his mother and other authority figures.<br /><br />Lesson #2: Integrity. Dre's opponents in the contest either cheat to win or do things that are legal but morally wrong. In contrast, Mr. Han won't let Dre cheat or manipulate the rules. In the process, Dre learns that you can triumph without doing the wrong thing.<br /><br />Lesson #3: Perseverance. Martial arts take a long time to learn. Dre spends a lot of time on activities he thinks are boring, but are really building the skills he needs to be a competent fighter. In so doing, he learns that training takes time, and it's not always fun, but it's worth the reward if you stick with it.<br /><br />Lesson #4: Self-Control. At the beginning of the movie, Dre's response to being bullied is to lose control, and it gets him beaten up. Through his training, he learns to control his emotions and not give in to them. This pays off in the final scenes where he must face the bullies without letting the pressure get to him.<br /><br />Lesson #5: Indomitable Spirit. In the beginning of the movie, Dre is easily intimidated by the kids who are bullying him. After training with Mr. Han, Dre faces off against his tormentors, and is determined to continue to the end, even though he is injured. Through martial arts, he learns the importance of courage.<br /><br />These five principles capture the core meaning and values of traditional martial arts training. They capture the true message of &quot;The Karate Kid&quot;: the goal of traditional training is ultimately to make the student a better person.<br /><br />So if you saw &quot;The Karate Kid&quot;, you are probably excited about martial arts. It's the only way to train -- and succeed -- like Dre.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy55b3V0dWJlLmNvbS93YXRjaD92PU9HN3NvdnRwZGIw" target="_blank">Kids martial arts Houston</a>

This can be frustrating to care givers, especially parents and grandparents.<br /><br />Most sports require specific skills - often physical skills which autistic children tend to lag behind other children of the same age. This can be frustrating and de-motivating in itself, but then add to that possible taunting and teasing from other children and criticism from the coach or parents. This is why it is often common for an autistic child to quickly loose interest in sports.<br /><br />Many adults find it important that the child participate in some sport of sport or exercise. Certainly it is good for health and can be great for confidence and well being if the child feels successful in the activity.<br /><br />Something to consider doing for your child is trying martial arts. There are many misconceptions about martial arts - such as the violence aspect or bullying. However not all martial arts programs or schools are geared toward fighting or all about winning tournaments.<br /><br />There are instructors that are knowledgeable about ADHD, autism or specialize in shy kids. They focus on building confidence, making it a fun and productive, confidence building experience.<br /><br />Beyond this, it is easier for autistic children to succeed at martial arts because there are fewer specific physical requirements. For example, to hit a baseball, a child has to master swinging a small thin bat and hit a tiny ball. Think of all the precision, the skills in play all at the same time. This is all just to make a connection to the ball, then you can consider which way the ball goes and how far. Other sports have similar requirements, physical prowess or have extremely complicated rules.<br /><br />In martial arts things can be much simpler. Throwing a punch is something most any child can do. Even a child in a wheel chair can snap out a hammer fist strike. Then they have a sense of accomplishment. They now know a martial arts move, it has a fancy name. They earn a belt and feel respected by their teacher and other students. They fit in.<br /><br />As they are able to, they can advance - learning more movements, more complicated techniques and steps. However it is very important that time and care are taken. The instructor must be understanding, as well as the parent.<br /><br />For certain autistic children such as Asperger's type, you may have success integrating counting - such as increasing the number of strikes - 2, 4, 6 or 8 - by twos - or, by tens. The instructor might use Japanese vocabulary to count as an additional incentive.<br /><br />At the end of the day, be sure to show interest - be sure it is genuine interest, and show genuine praise when warranted. These children can be very smart, and can often tell when they are being given false or exaggerated praise.<br /><br />Be sure to check out multiple studios or schools, talk to the instructors, find out who would be teaching your child, and what experience they have with your child's traits. Watch a class or two. Ask questions, and have fun with your child.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy55b3V0dWJlLmNvbS93YXRjaD92PU9HN3NvdnRwZGIw" target="_blank">Kids Karate Lessons Houston</a>

This is done by stepping back with either foot and bringing your hands up to a position in front of the body that says: &quot;Stop, don't hurt me&quot;. Body language means a lot and this stance appears to say: &quot;Don't come any closer&quot; but actually means &quot;Please come a little closer. Please&quot;.<br /><br />As a student of &quot;traditional&quot; martial arts I was taught a long, deep front stance and a wide and deep horse stance. We had all kinds of conjecture on how these stances would be employed without any solid instruction as to what those stances were really for. They do have a place but it is not as you might think.<br /><br />Now if I were to teach another women's self defense course I would not teach karate stances per se. The OMG stance would be where I would start. I would not teach punches and no fancy kicks. I would not teach joint locks. Nor would I teach Judo type throws. All of those take a lot of practice to learn and to be able to use them under the duress of an attack makes them impractical. Finger locks on the other hand work great and are easily learned and almost instinctive to apply.<br /><br />We have a multitude of weapons at our disposal. I would teach the basic use of those weapons. Palm heel strikes, knee strikes, elbow strikes, head butts, and eye gouges. I would teach them how to spit and how to scream like a wounded bear. I would teach them to scream only one word - FIRE! Everybody likes to watch a good fire. Not many people want to get involved with someone screaming for help. The idea is to get a bunch of witnesses. Getting them to testify is another subject.<br /><br />I would not explain pressure point strikes, cross body meridian strikes, times of the Shichen, or yin/yang strikes. I would point out three or four easily accessible targets such as the eyes, the throat, the groin, the side of the knee, and the top of the foot. They all contain points related to Chinese Medicine but knowing their names, how they relate to the diurnal cycle or the cycle of creation/destruction is not necessary.<br /><br />I would have the women practice the strikes in combination: Palm heel to the chin, knee to the groin, elbow to the neck, then a heel stomp to the top of the foot or some variant combination thereof. Then I would I would have them do the techniques until they dreamed about them. The final course of instruction is the application of the techniques. Protective suits are expensive but if I were to do this on a regular basis I would have one. Then I would send the women out into the night, regardless of weather or light conditions and have them attacked by the sucker in the protective suit. Techniques must be of such a nature that they can be applied under an actual attack. Adrenalin can be both good and bad.<br /><br />Teaching mindset of winning and being a survivor begins the moment class begins. Train Hard.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RvbW1lamVyMjQueGFuZ2EuY29tLzc2ODEyNTk5NC9raWRzLWthcmF0ZS1sZXNzb25zLWhvdXN0b24v" target="_blank">click here</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL0dlbnRyeUtsZWFtZXFpbGppYWgubmV3c3ZpbmUuY29tL19uZXdzLzIwMTIvMDkvMjQvMTQwNTczNDktY2xpY2staGVyZQ__" target="_blank">Kids Karate Lessons Houston</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2dyb3Vwcy5kaWlnby5jb20vZ3JvdXAvY3V1cmZkaWV5anlocmVhYWRqeXQvY29udGVudC9jbGljay1oZXJlLTY1MDc2NzQ_" target="_blank">Kids martial arts Houston</a>

There are hundreds, if not thousands, of reasons why people choose to take up an art, but I want to take a second to outline what I feel are the most important reasons to at least try a martial art. Maybe it's for yourself, maybe it's for your children...whatever the reason, all martial arts contain a unique wealth of knowledge and discipline that you simply can't get anywhere else. My hope is that this article will inspire you to get out of your chair and into a school to see what martial arts is all about.<br /><br />Self Confidence<br /> As you train in martial arts, you will notice a lot if improvements, such as your physique, balance, awareness, flexibility, and many other physical and mental characteristics. Martial Arts will teach you how to combine these capabilities and use them to succeed in competitions, attaining higher belts, building friendships and protecting yourself if necessary. The more you can do, the more confident you will be.<br /><br />Self Defense<br /> One of the most common reasons to study martial arts is to learn how to defend one's self. A number of schools may dedicate class time and/or offer a scheduled class that strictly goes over self defense tactics. Also, depending on the MA style or school, self defense can be a large part of the curriculum, which can be beneficial to those interested in &quot;applicable arts&quot; (arts you can use in everyday life) as opposed to &quot;traditional arts&quot;.<br /><br />Self Discipline<br /> Webster defines self-discipline as the &quot;correction or regulation of oneself for the sake of improvement&quot;. Whether it be trying to make a high school team or meeting company deadlines, once you learn the focus necessary to succeed in Martial Arts you can apply it to the rest of your life. Success is mental, and Martial Arts will teach you the self discipline necessary to succeed at anything you put your mind to.<br /><br />Coordination<br /> Martial arts does require a lot of hand, foot, eye, and mental coordination, but all of this is developed over time. If you consider yourself as an uncoordinated person, training in the martial arts will help you grow those skills. You'll be amazed what your body is capable of doing! Even if you are a natural athlete, standing on one foot, while kicking with the other, and blocking with your hands is quite difficult and involves coordination.<br /><br />Fitness<br /> Martial Arts does not have to focus only on fighting or self defense as some styles are based more on fitness. Tae Bo and Tai Chi are two examples of this. However, those with an interest in the fighting &amp; self-defense aspects of Martial arts will find their fitness levels quicly increasing as training not only develops various muscle groups, but flexibility and balance as well. One's level of fitness can be just as important in winning a match as one's skills and abilities.<br /><br />Family Enjoyment<br /> Most people don't know that this is an excellent way to spend time together with your family! Some martial art schools allow families to train together and others separate classes by age groups. Regardless of how classes are segregated, families find themselves enjoying the time spent together.  <br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2dyb3Vwcy5kaWlnby5jb20vZ3JvdXAvY3V1cmZkaWV5anlocmVhYWRqeXQvY29udGVudC9jbGljay1oZXJlLTY1MDc2NzQ_" target="_blank">Kids martial arts Houston</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RvbW1lamVyMjQuZG11c2ljLm5ldC9qb3VybmFsLzE2MTEyNjU_" target="_blank">Kids martial arts Houston</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RvbW1lamVyMjQueGFuZ2EuY29tLzc2ODEyNTk5NC9raWRzLWthcmF0ZS1sZXNzb25zLWhvdXN0b24v" target="_blank">Kids Karate Lessons Houston</a>

One of the issues that should be on the radar of your Karate Class or Dojo is the issue of child neglect by parents. This neglect does not refer to physical neglect such as food, clothing and shelter, but rather, emotional neglect.<br /><br />Emotional neglect can has many roots, but can lead to various symptoms later such as lack of cognitive ability, lack of social behaviour skills, lack of confidence etc. These symptoms can manifest separately, or one can cause the other and have a snowball effect.<br /><br />One of the key enablers of growing a successful student, is identifying these symptoms and addressing some of these roots. A point should be made at every Instructor's meeting, to discuss the behaviour, interaction and conduct of certain students within the class. You need to look at those that need to be lifted up, but also at those who need to get down to earth. Your training methods should be structured to address both scenarios with a tweak here and there as necessary to tip the scales. This mental reprogramming of a child takes quite a while, depending on the damage caused by a person, event, or a combination of the two.<br /><br />I have personally identified a trend in children that are dropped-off and collected after class vs. children that are brought to class with the parent/s or guardians sitting in on the class. In most cases, the children who are dropped-off, are those children that need boosting vs. those whose parents / guardians are part of the training experience, even by just being there. You do get those parents that are present at the class, but they are disconnected from what their child is doing, how he is performing because they are reading a magazine or something to pass the time. These are the boundary line children and you should consider &quot;working the audience&quot; when identifying that this is happening to a child. Engage with audience by saying, Hey parents, did you see that great stance&quot; or &quot;Hey Daniel's dad, did you teach him this or is he just that good!!&quot;<br /><br />The mission of your class or dojo needs to focussed on building people by what you do and how you do it. Character, sincerity, effort, etiquette, self-control and respect must be the foundation of learning at your dojo and be in the hearts and minds of your students.<br /><br />Teaching children martial arts is like nurturing a Bonsai tree (not to steal the fame from Mr Miagi), You cannot let it grow for 10 years and then try and shape it, it requires constant attention to detail, sometimes, detail you never knew was there.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RvbW1lamVyMjQucG9zdGVyb3VzLmNvbS9jbGljay1oZXJlLTU0ODk0" target="_blank">Kids martial arts Houston</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWdlbnRlLmNvbS95b3VyX3BhZ2UvYmxvZy92aWV3X3Bvc3RpbmcuaHRtbD9waWQ9MzUxNjU4NiZhbXA7cHJvZmlsZV9pZD03NjY2MTQxJmFtcDtwcm9maWxlX25hbWU9dG9tbWVqZXIyNCZhbXA7dXNlcl9pZD03NjY2MTQxJmFtcDt1c2VybmFtZT10b21tZWplcjI0" target="_blank">Kids Karate Lessons Houston</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5pYW1zcG9ydC5vcmcvc2VhcmNoLz90YWc9S2lkcytLYXJhdGUrTGVzc29ucytIb3VzdG9u" target="_blank">Kids martial arts Houston</a>

Even after a long time, martial arts have thrived and become even more practiced all around the world. Contrary to what others believe, they can be practiced even by young ones and not by adults alone. Karate, especially has become a favorite by people of all ages.<br /><br />Nowadays, it is becoming more popular among kids. This is because they are so many benefits of it for kids. Here are the primary ones which are being observed especially by parents who have children who are into it.<br /><br />Self-defense- most of the time, parents enroll their kids in martial arts schools and academies for this reason. The rising rate of crimes that involve children have alarmed parents too much that they believe that enrolling their children in these schools will increase the possibility of preventing such circumstances. This is actually true. Of course you cannot expect children aged five to ten doing complicated moves. The point is at least they can learn basic yet effective ways to escape dangerous situations. Simple self-defense moves are enough to give parents a peace of mind.<br /><br />Self-confidence- why is this important in every child? Whenever they will go, kids need to be confident with themselves. At school, they need this to answer the questions properly and perform activities. Don't you know that most of those kids who do not have self-confidence, no matter how intelligent they are doomed to be low performers? They can also be prone to bullying and ridicule. When they know martial arts, at least they can be confident with themselves.<br /><br />Self-discipline- one of the basic values that martial arts teach children is self-discipline. One cannot actually pass these courses if they do not master this value. As a parent, one of the hardest tasks is getting their attention. This is actually one of the primary lessons that they will be learning in karate lessons. Believe it or not, you can get positive changes in their behavior once they attended martial arts curriculum.<br /><br />Keeping them fit-of course, who cannot be physically fit in doing these courses? With all the moves and tactics to learn, how can the body store too much fat? As young as they are they will learn how to value their body. No need to instruct them to eat this and that for they will willfully eat healthy foods and do their own exercises.<br /><br />As mentioned, there are many benefits of martial arts training for kids. However, for these positive things to be enjoyed fully, you must choose the right center or school. To have a fresh start, you can always browse the internet for some helpful websites. You can also ask other parents for this matter or the school where your children are. Shopping as early as now will help you make up your mind. Things like quality teachers and complete facilities are common criteria to look after in choosing martial arts schools for your kids.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/tommejer/blog/blogid=12261766" target="_blank">Kids Karate Lessons Houston</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL0dlbnRyeUtsZWFtZXFpbGppYWgubmV3c3ZpbmUuY29tL19uZXdzLzIwMTIvMDkvMjQvMTQwNTc1NDYta2lkcy1rYXJhdGUtbGVzc29ucy1ob3VzdG9u" target="_blank">Kids martial arts Houston</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWdlbnRlLmNvbS95b3VyX3BhZ2UvYmxvZy92aWV3X3Bvc3RpbmcuaHRtbD9waWQ9MzUxNjU4NiZhbXA7cHJvZmlsZV9pZD03NjY2MTQxJmFtcDtwcm9maWxlX25hbWU9dG9tbWVqZXIyNCZhbXA7dXNlcl9pZD03NjY2MTQxJmFtcDt1c2VybmFtZT10b21tZWplcjI0" target="_blank">Kids martial arts Houston</a>

		<document id="59214c5c8cf2d1fcb98dbacb3cc4af7e" url=""><![CDATA[Kids martial arts Houston<br/><br/>Karate is a very exciting martial art that focuses on character development, physical fitness and practical self-defence.<br /><br />Most karate classes are highly structured and follow an internationally recognised syllabus, where students are constantly encouraged to do their best, as they learn various skills and techniques that help them develop both physically and mentally.<br /><br />As a result students learn self-discipline, improved concentration and focus, improved fitness and stamina, self confidence and the ability to focus under pressure.<br /><br />With a structured syllabus and the progressive belt system, this allows for students to progress within the style as they meet the requirements of each belt level, this makes the achievement of a new grade a very individual accomplishment and lets students grow at a rate that suits their learning and physical abilities.<br /><br />CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT <br />Karate is a traditional Japanese based style that focuses greatly on values such as respect, self control, discipline and honour.<br /><br />The founder of one style of karate, once believed that if he could take any student, no matter what type of person they were and teach them those values, then they would leave the dojo (school) a much better person, and if he could teach those values to enough students he would have a significant impact, not only on his local community but possibly even effect the chances of world peace.<br /><br />This may seem far fetched in today's scheme of things, but it makes sense that if you can improve the core values of enough people, even in a small part of the population, it would have a positive effect on some level.<br /><br />PHYSICAL FITNESS <br />The physical training involved in a style such as Kyokushin karate in particular, develops co-ordination through repetitive use of the body's general motor skills, and increases strength, core stability, balance and flexibility, which is important especially for younger students during the early years of physical change.<br /><br />This physical aspect of training also encourages an overall positive attitude to keeping fit and leading a healthy active lifestyle.<br /><br />PRACTICAL SELF DEFENCE <br />Although karate teaches the physical skills that could be used if a student was to find themselves in danger, its main purpose is to build the confidence within a student of their ability to protect themselves, which eliminates reactions based on fear, allowing them to focus under pressure, control aggression, and only apply the force necessary to protect themselves under the circumstances.<br /><br />OVERALL BENEFITS OF KARATE <br />Over all karate teaches life skills. Skills that are the building blocks of good character and leadership.<br /><br />Karate is good for people of any age, but in particular, karate is good for kids, to be able to learn these life skills early in their development, as well as taking on a healthy attitude to being active, creates a strong foundation for a happy healthy individual.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWdlbnRlLmNvbS95b3VyX3BhZ2UvYmxvZy92aWV3X3Bvc3RpbmcuaHRtbD9waWQ9MzUxNjU4NiZhbXA7cHJvZmlsZV9pZD03NjY2MTQxJmFtcDtwcm9maWxlX25hbWU9dG9tbWVqZXIyNCZhbXA7dXNlcl9pZD03NjY2MTQxJmFtcDt1c2VybmFtZT10b21tZWplcjI0" target="_blank">Kids martial arts Houston</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RvbW1lamVyMjQueGFuZ2EuY29tLzc2ODEyNjQ5MS9raWRzLW1hcnRpYWwtYXJ0cy1ob3VzdG9uLw__" target="_blank">click here</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/tommejer/blog/blogid=12229502" target="_blank">Kids Karate Lessons Houston</a>

		<document id="3bde8fda348f48f4cc490a4b840f7965" url=""><![CDATA[Kids martial arts Houston<br/><br/>Focus in Kids Martial Arts<br /><br />There are many benefits associated, or at least claimed to be, with martial arts for kids. One of these is focus. By focus I am referring to focus of attention, taking instruction, listening to the teacher or put simply concentration. Learning judo, kung fu or karate for kids involves listening to the teacher, understanding the instruction and acting on it. Often this process involves a physical demonstration. Nothing spectacular in any of that but it can result in a concurrent improvement in focus at school.<br /><br />I remember one mother after a grading had finished remarking how well her daughter took instruction. I agreed with her but it turned out that her child had a form of dyslexia which was supposed to make taking instruction difficult. I was incredulous at the time, as the girl in question was one of the most dedicated kids, worked very hard at her training and as a result was one of the most talented kids in the class. I would never have guessed her condition.<br /><br />Other times I have parents telling me their kids grades have improved at school, partly, at least to the kids ability to focus improving. This is all very good but how does this happen?<br /><br />In many ways martial arts classes are an analogy for the big bad world. You get out what you put in, and this should be especially so for kids. Children will mess about given the chance, by balancing learning MA skills with fun games that are relevant to martial arts, the kids have fun and learn through play! This balance of learning and fun keeps kids on track AND focused!<br /><br />Focus in Kids Martial Arts Classes and School is Rewarded <br />In Martial Arts classes, as in school, children that pay attention are able to learn to a higher level than those that don't. In martial arts this is reward is manifested at gradings as the relatively higher skill level in comparison to less attentive kids is demonstrated and rewarded in the form of the highly desirable new coloured belt.<br /><br />At gradings we tend not to fail kids, rather we break belts or grades into quarters so the less able have a reasonable opportunity to progress. This enables a certain amount of leeway to reward those that put the effort in with higher (partial) grades than those that tend to cruise.<br /><br />There is a natural selection process here. If a kid puts the effort in, practices at home as well as in class it is reflected in their ability. It is very obvious to see. Of course the reverse is true; anyone coasting does not improve to the same level.<br /><br />By ensuring that focus in class is rewarded with praise and tangible reward, kids come round to the idea that it's a good idea to listen and act on instruction. Not rocket science but this occurs time and time again. Through positive peer 'pressure' in class to do the correct thing, focus, and with tangible rewards on offer kids get the message. This is reinforced through the sheer joy of learning a physical skill.<br /><br />The act of overcoming an obstacle that once seemed impossible, breeds confidence and supports the notion that focusing on the teachers advice is a good, helpful thing. Nowhere is this more so than in kids martial arts.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2dyb3Vwcy5kaWlnby5jb20vZ3JvdXAvZnpwb2Z5YWp1Z2d0cnZhZHZ2d2ovY29udGVudC9raWRzLWthcmF0ZS1sZXNzb25zLWhvdXN0b24tNjUwNzk3Nw__" target="_blank">click here</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy52aWxhZ28yMS5jb20vZXZlbnQvY2xpY2sraGVyZS8xNDM2OTYwL3Byb2ZpbGU_" target="_blank">Kids Karate Lessons Houston</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RvbW1lamVyMjQuZG11c2ljLm5ldC9qb3VybmFsLzE2MTA0MzQ_" target="_blank">Kids martial arts Houston</a>

The physical benefits are obvious (endurance, strength, flexibility, coordination and balance), but there are several mental benefits as well, including improved communication skills.<br /><br />As both a student for the past 8 years and as an instructor, I have noticed the following communication benefits from karate:<br /><br />1. Focus. Paying attention pays off in karate. As students focus on learning, their skill improves and they earn the next belt.<br /><br />Communication benefit: focus is critically important to understanding the flow of conversation. Listening. If students don't listen and follow instructions, they literally will be out-of-step. Students must also confirm that they have heard and understood the instructions by saying, &quot;Yes, Ma'am&quot; or &quot;Yes, Sir.&quot;<br /><br />Communication benefit: Listening isn't just waiting for your turn to talk. Good listeners are &quot;in-step&quot; with their conversation partners and reflect back that they have heard and understood.<br /><br />3.  Respect and Courtesy. Instructors and other students are to be treated and spoken to with respect. Instructors are addressed by Mr., Mrs., or Ms. Last name.<br /><br />Communication benefit: Talking respectfully to others, even if you don't agree with them, keeps the doors of communication open. Knowing when to address others formally also makes a good impression.<br /><br />4. Reading Body Language. Reading body language is especially important in sparring. Students need to react to their sparring partner's stance and movements.<br /><br />Communication benefit: Many studies show that 50 percent or more of communication is non-verbal. Being attuned to what other people are &quot;telegraphing&quot; with their body or facial expressions will greatly enhance communication.<br /><br />5. Confidence-and how to appear confident by proper stance, eye contact, body movements and voice. Confidence grows as new skills are learned, but learning how to appear confident is also a skill.<br /><br />Communication benefit: First impressions matter. Appearing confident will make a good impression.<br /><br />6. Clarity. As a student moves up in belt ranks, other students look to him or her for guidance. When a student helps another student, he or she learns the value of clear and precise language.<br /><br />Communication benefit: Clarity in word choice and expression leads to greater understanding.<br /><br />7. Show vs. Tell.  Showing someone what you mean or how to do something is often more effective than telling them how to do it, especially when a student is learning something new.<br /><br />Communication benefit: Showing, either by physical demonstration (which is the usual method of &quot;showing&quot; in karate), or by vivid description, creates a picture in the other person's mind. Pictures are easier to remember. Let me give an example of narrative telling vs. narrative showing...<br /><br />Example of telling: I was car-jacked after grocery shopping.<br /><br />Example of showing: On a moonless, cool summer night, just after I got into my van after grocery shopping, a short Asian man flung open my van's passenger door. He climbed in, pointed a gun at me, and told me to start driving.<br /><br />Which is more interesting or memorable-telling or showing?<br /><br />Finally, the make-or-break communication skill:<br /><br />8. Bad attitudes are expected to be left outside the studio.<br /><br />Communication benefit: Being able to rise above circumstances and exhibit a generally happy, can-do attitude attracts others so they will want to communicate in a like-wise positive manner.<br /><br />Help your kid get kick-butt communication skills with karate!<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RvbW1lamVyMjQucG9zdGVyb3VzLmNvbS9jbGljay1oZXJlLTM5NTgx" target="_blank">Kids Karate Lessons Houston</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RvbW1lamVyMjQueGFuZ2EuY29tLzc2ODEyNjc5NC9jbGljay1oZXJlLw__" target="_blank">Kids Karate Lessons Houston</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWdlbnRlLmNvbS95b3VyX3BhZ2UvYmxvZy92aWV3X3Bvc3RpbmcuaHRtbD9waWQ9MzUxNjU4NiZhbXA7cHJvZmlsZV9pZD03NjY2MTQxJmFtcDtwcm9maWxlX25hbWU9dG9tbWVqZXIyNCZhbXA7dXNlcl9pZD03NjY2MTQxJmFtcDt1c2VybmFtZT10b21tZWplcjI0" target="_blank">Kids Karate Lessons Houston</a>

These days ADD is rampant because of the instant gratification society that we live in with the internet. Kids can change what they are watching faster than ever with a click of a button and there are so many children these days who are spending 90% of their time on the computer.<br /><br />Martial arts can help your child with his/her focus, attitude, morality, behavior, reflexes, fitness, discipline, attention span, the list goes on and on. With kids karate, (starting at about 5 to 6 years old) they will learn early how to stay focused on one subject, even if its just being quiet for an extended period of time. This can make staying quiet in school easier to deal with since this is rewarded in kids martial arts classes. The earlier you can start your child out, the better.<br /><br />The reason for this is, because, your child may already be developing ADD, because of watching too much T.V. or playing video games all the time. These sorts of things can cause problem in your child's personality, their character, and also in focus and decision making skills as well.

The mental and physical training necessary to be successful in any martial art will give students helpful skills they can apply to a number of other facets of their lives. With so many martial arts schools in even the smallest cities it may be a overwhelming task for parents to evaluate them and figure out what is the best martial art for their kids. Although there's no single martial art that is best suited specifically to all kids there are some which are more suitable than others. Some styles may focus more on the physical tournaments and preparing for them, while others may have an increased emphasis on character and self esteem developing. Furthermore two schools that provide the same style will teach that style distinctly, setting greater emphasis on different aspects of the style, for example mastering the formal movement patterns vs a focus on the sparring aspects. In this short article we hope to help you with some information regarding the best martial art for kids.<br /><br />Firstly you being a parent have to be sure you understand the reason you are searching for a martial art for your kids. There are a number of skills to be acquired through martial arts, such as self-defence, fitness improvements, teaching self-confidence, or training to compete in competitive events.<br /><br />While most if not all martial arts are in some ways acceptable for kids, the same can't be said for all schools or coaches. That is the reason why the initial step when choosing a martial art for your kids should be to determine which of the martial arts styles offered in your area are most suited for your kids, and then assess the schools within driving distance, the instructors in those schools and then the type of training they provide to both students and to instructors.<br /><br />Begin by exploring several of the schools found in your community to determine what their primary styles are. The World Wide Web is an excellent resource for this as you can get a quick summary of the tenets, history and styles involved with each individual martial art. Consider not only your goals for your kids, more self-confidence or building physical strength for instance, but also the skills of your child when deciding which martial arts may be best suited for them. Judo and mixed martial arts both have some focus on grappling, which is locking or pinning opponents down. So these may not be the best martial arts for kids which are claustrophobic. These things are important indications of the commitment level that the instructors and masters have to the school.<br /><br />Now that you've found a school you have to inspect the physical location itself. The physical location of the school or the equipment the school uses may not be tolerable to you once you actually see it. More than likely you are going to want to visit the school without your children, in the event that they may be anxious to begin training there and you determine that you are not comfortable with the school. Be sure to help your kids with some research into these aspects.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy52aWxhZ28yMS5jb20vZXZlbnQvS2lkcyttYXJ0aWFsK2FydHMrSG91c3Rvbi8xNDM2OTA4L3Byb2ZpbGU_" target="_blank">Kids Karate Lessons Houston</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWdlbnRlLmNvbS95b3VyX3BhZ2UvYmxvZy92aWV3X3Bvc3RpbmcuaHRtbD9waWQ9MzUwNjMxNCZhbXA7cHJvZmlsZV9pZD03NjY2MTQxJmFtcDtwcm9maWxlX25hbWU9dG9tbWVqZXIyNCZhbXA7dXNlcl9pZD03NjY2MTQxJmFtcDt1c2VybmFtZT10b21tZWplcjI0" target="_blank">Kids Karate Lessons Houston</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RvbW1lamVyMjQueGFuZ2EuY29tLzc2ODEyNjU4Ni9jbGljay1oZXJlLw__" target="_blank">Kids Karate Lessons Houston</a>

All parents understand the benefits of personal safety and discipline their child will receive from a kids martial arts program, but let's not overlook the mental and social aspects that are just as important for building the leaders of tomorrow. <br /><br />Setting goals leads to Success! When a child sets out on achieving their first belt rank, they are actually guiding themselves toward reaching a worthy goal. Every step towards that objective requires a kid to focus on learning the curriculum techniques and having the patients to complete the process. The enjoyment and thrill of getting to the first goal will enthusiastically push them to go after the next belt rank &quot;goal&quot;. <br /><br />One of the core principles in kids martial arts is to improve on a weakness in order to build up self-esteem. The best way to get children to be organized and think through problems logically is to provide an atmosphere that is mentally challenging. As skills and techniques improve, so will self-confidence and the way they look to solve problems or stresses in daily activities. <br /><br />Martial arts teaches kids to incorporate positive social interaction with their peers and prevent physical altercations. Learning how to present confident body language is as essential as learning how to defend a kick or punch. Standing up straight and tall while making eye contact when speaking exudes belief in oneself. <br /><br />The environment in a martial arts school builds teamwork through training with a variety of partners. The close student and instructor interaction provides the opportunity for the child to not only learn from his or her peers, but teach them as well. <br /><br />Any parent will be able to tell you that their son or daughter seems like a total different child compared to when they started. They have learned to act with an aggressive boldness and seek out solutions to any problems they might face. They seem to thrive on a good challenge and nothing seems impossible. They do not look for guidance or answers from peers, they set out to figure stuff out on their own. <br /><br />Students learn to show respect to their instructors and each other by bowing or with a hand shake gesture. They address mentors and people of authority with the correct titles and don't speak out of turn. The respect shown in the academy is carried over into the family and school life. The child shows consideration and appreciation when interacting with family members and other students. <br /><br />Preparing a child to carry out and execute any task they start requires good physical health, a mental toughness, and being social adept. <br /><br />Give your child the best opportunity to succeed in every aspect of their life by enrolling them into a martial arts program. Watch as they excel in physical, mental, and social areas of life and strive to be a leader and not a follower. <br /><br />Mass Bay BJJ offers Boston Martial Arts classes for kids in Jiu Jitsu Boston Basics and Karate. <br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2dyb3Vwcy5kaWlnby5jb20vZ3JvdXAvZnVyamJ2eWpyeHlmYnB0amNsencvY29udGVudC9jbGljay1oZXJlLTY1MDc5NDI_" target="_blank">Kids martial arts Houston</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RvbW1lamVyMjQucG9zdGVyb3VzLmNvbS9raWRzLW1hcnRpYWwtYXJ0cy1ob3VzdG9uLTkwOTY3" target="_blank">Kids martial arts Houston</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RvbW1lamVyMjQueGFuZ2EuY29tLzc2ODEyNjY3OC9raWRzLW1hcnRpYWwtYXJ0cy1ob3VzdG9uLw__" target="_blank">click here</a>
