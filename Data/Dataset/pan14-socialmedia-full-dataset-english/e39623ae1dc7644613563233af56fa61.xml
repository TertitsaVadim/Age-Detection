<br /><br />for selling her soul to some merciful turtles
<br /><br />one day she went into the market to buy sume simpathy
<br /><br />but she was only greeted with pain
<br /><br />so she released her magical lady beetles
<br /><br />to create a haapy energy
<br /><br />and they did wee wee everywere until about 2 47 am
<br /><br />then the sun started to shine early so she
<br /><br />dicintergrated in to the ipithany of nothing
<br /><br />thats wen there was some maggots named goerge and leane
<br /><br />they made friends with louie the fly until one day
<br /><br />they stood under way tooo many girafs and had seen the end in a stoie weeeved in the starz
<br /><br />so they went dpwn to the hock shop and sold everything they ownd so they could
<br /><br />buy their freedom in the wide world of maggots.
<br /><br />by reuniting there body wid there soulthey created
<br /><br />but the pawn broker had no good for maggot possetoins so
<br /><br />they hung their heads in shame until they met an elephant called
<br /><br />bohimia
<br /><br />he gave them 4 dollars and a broken ass xylophone and told them to
<br /><br />go to band camp and learn the flute so they cud
<br /><br />enter the miystical relm of nod
<br /><br />in nod they could be everything that they were here but heeps better so they decided
<br /><br />that they wud ride a magikal unicorn to glide to the rainbow that lead to the
<br /><br />yellow brick road
<br /><br />and thats when after they used the 4 dollars to buy
<br /><br />a bus ticket that took thm to the pixie house made of candy and ice cream
<br /><br />it waz a multitasking ticket alowing entry to williy wonkas chocolate factory

<br /><br />decided to bully the poor little maggots who weighed 5 grams each
<br /><br />the fats got hungry and ate the maggots they ate them frm the inside out
<br /><br />then the maggots went to the cassino to play the pokeys
<br /><br />where they met louise they fly. perhaps it was their mother, but they didn't know. they fell instantly in love with her
<br /><br />but she had eaten a dog
<br /><br />and she told them how she met there father at a funeral and then hooked up for the nite and the next day found out they were related

<br /><br />and sml gold spiders
<br /><br />wot would people say a woman marrying a maggot? they didnt care they were in love and when

<br /><br />and knitted them matching jackets out off his own pubes the purple frog was heeps better so he knitted it a gimp suit from his pubes also apon seeing his new clothes the little frog

<br /><br />Tired, lost, and hungry, they sat down next to a beautiful spring to make their favorite dinner of spaghetti and meatballs. 
<br /><br />They had just unpacked their trusty mule, Bill and ben the flowerpot men, and laid out the raw meat when they heard a frightening, low growl and rustling in the bushes.
<br /><br />They turned just in time to see a ten-foot tall mongoose standing on its hind legs sniffing the air. In a flash, Bill and ben the flowerpot men-the-mule bolted into the woods. 
<br /><br />The miners sprinted up a tree, and all the raw food went flying into the spring. Disappointed that there would be no dinner, the giant mongoose ran off into the woods.
<br /><br />As the miners peered down from their wobbly perch, they heard rumbling. All of a sudden the spring started frothing and foaming and the air took on the fragrance of Hungry jacks. Before they could say &quot;Astounded!,&quot; twenty fully-cooked meatballs shot out of the water. The hungry miners quickly popped them into their mouths. The meatballs were better than anything they had ever tasted! 
<br /><br />After Bill and ben the flowerpot men returned, they explored the rest of the area. They found that Chunchy grew from the trees and the rivers flowed with Pinnacollada.
<br /><br />They knew they had struck it rich. Immediately they decided to build a restaurant right on that spot, and they named it Bill and ben the flowerpot men's. As word spread, people from Amsterdam to The land of nod flocked to the area to taste the fabulous meatballs. Houses began to spring up and so did businesses to serve the residents and tourists.
<br /><br />And from then to now, Meatball Springs is known far and wide as the place where &quot;meatballs spring eternal.&quot;

Whether the temperature's up or whether the temperature's down, the nature watcher, the catcher and the pitcher are always around. The pitcher pitches, the catcher catches and the watcher watches. So whether the temperature's rises or whether the temperature falls the nature watcher just watches the catcher who's watching the pitcher who's watching the balls.

<br />diencumber from all my worry,
<br />exonerate my soul, that binds me blindly to all i loathe,
<br />the demenour of an empty face, recoiled in darkness hides,
<br />the hollow indicisions, of broken dismal lies,
<br />resurrect my spirit, replenish the lost soul,
<br />where once there was a person,
<br />there now remains a hole,
<br />detatched from all emotions, floating inbetween,
<br />bring fourth the renewal, of  a hope redeemed,
<br />perplexed by indicision, of the compromised mind,
<br />altered by the essence, of a once remembered time,
<br />disjointed in the thoughts, i tend to re-create,
<br />reminise on moments, that in time i grow to hate,
<br />captivated minds affected by infinate fate, 
<br />merging of emotions, awarness too late, 
<br />blinded by delusions and mystified by truth,
<br />slowly lifes momentum, drifts by in vain,

<br />in every moment we are a new expression on the blank canvas of life,
<br />we are everchanging souls, connected by nothing and everything, 
<br />we are a smile, a laugh , a comment made in passing,
<br />we drift aimlessly though confusion,
<br />we reach great hights, we fall, cry , get up and do it all again, we walk through moments only glimpsing at possibilitys, 
<br />not ever truly aknolaging wat we are truly capible of, 
<br />cease every moment as though it where your last,
<br />only wen we live right on the edge do we see the fantastic view, 
<br />look back on your life and think of all the moments that have defined you, 
<br />made you wat you are, walk away from life knowing you took every chance travelled every road, 
<br />make mistakes, laugh at them, be afraid but still do it , u never know wat the new day will bring, dnt be saddened for long if things never turn out the way u planned because they never do, its the happy times, the down times, the memories we capture that make us smile, open your eyes and see the world, be open to its grandure and know that being yourself can bring joy to ppls lives, be honest with who u are, to yourself and know that life wieves a webb of myterious wounder.

<br /><br />A guy picked up a woman at a bar one night and took her home. On the way, she asked him if he had aids. He told her he didn't. At his house she asked again if he had aids, and he assured her that he didn't. In bed, after they had begun to remove their clothes, she stopped and turned to him.
<br /><br />&quot;You're sure you don't have aids?&quot; she asked.
<br /><br />&quot;Yes, I'm sure,&quot; he told her, getting a bit annoyed. She finally stopped talking, and they had sex for hours, doing everything imaginable. Afterwards they were laying there in bed and she snuggled up to him.
<br /><br />&quot;Look,&quot; she said, &quot; It's too late now, so you might as well tell me if you have aids.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;I told you I don't have aids,&quot; he almost yelled.
<br /><br />&quot;Oh, thank god,&quot; she sighed, &quot;I wouldn't want to get that again.&quot;

<br />to challenge ourselves to get back up to see, how far the fallen fall, to know what its like to alter our own perceptions, to that which evades us in our truth,
<br />to know that knowledge can bring both equality and grief in equal amounts, as  that which we perceive as truth is often an illusion our mind creates, 
<br />to keep our souls at bay, too questions we want to remain unanswered, in this sense we become our own worst critique, knowing we will never live up to our own expectations but being naïve enough to believe in them, this is life in its essence, this is hope in emptiness, light in darkness and a smile on a tear filled face, but as one moment fades into the horizon a new dawn begins , it awakens us, we see that our perceptions of yesterday are altered by the thoughts of today….

<br />the month fades, a year drifts away,
<br />a smile crumbles,
<br />a heart breaks,
<br />a precious life drifts away,
<br />the sparkle from your eyes left,
<br />your laughter died away,
<br />i can only imagine the words i never got to say,
<br /><br />i never saw your face as you drifted away,
<br />but i hope you know in spirit, i was with you on that day,
<br /><br />your laughter that once made me laugh,
<br />now haunts me till i cry,
<br />i wish i could have said to you my last forever &quot;goodbye&quot;
<br />all the memories i have of you,
<br />now only make me cry,
<br />why do they say the good die young,
<br />i finally understand,
<br /><br />so much life you had in you,
<br />but god had other plans,
<br />i will never forget the times together shared,
<br />the laughter, tears and memories forever there,
<br /><br />in my heart i'll carry you around the world we'll go,
<br />every laugh i have,
<br />i know you'll have one too,
<br />although you cannot join me,
<br />in spirit you will be,
<br />in each and everyone of us you touched,
<br />you will always be

<br />now i just see rain,
<br />where did all the sunshine go,
<br />the world has too much pain,
<br /><br />twisted memories,
<br />distorted words,
<br />and broken dreams that die,
<br />fractured hearts,
<br />filled by empty lies,
<br />that make the forgotten cry,
<br /><br />silent screams masked with smiles,
<br />hatred replaced with denial,
<br />the pain you never have to feel,
<br /><br />get up move on,
<br />do it all again,
<br />the endless cycle,
<br />the re-cycled words,
<br />the new beginning of the end.
