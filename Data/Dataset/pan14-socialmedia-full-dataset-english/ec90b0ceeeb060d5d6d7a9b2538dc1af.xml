You could use this at home by easily too, try oral on your partner if you want to keep her arousal levels high.&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;They would often quickly finish the first time, but knew that after that they would be lasting much longer. Many guys at home try strategic masturbation before big dates if they want to impress a new partner.&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;They think about something else while on the job. One guy I talked to was writing a screen play so he worked on that in his mind. Another would replay a basketball game in his imagination. Just about everyone had a trick to take their minds off of what they were doing.
