<br /><br />It has been a while since the last time I wrote about myself. It was always grief, anger, pain, tears, lost and everything that is bad. Yes, I have been to that at the very young age and I don’t have any regret because I have learned so much lessons from those bad things that happen to me. I just let myself to do it in right way I think. I pour so much tears that almost no tears will fall from my eyes. I shouted that almost everybody was able to hear it, but then I always feel alone that I thought nobody cares and I am alone in this world. Yes, I have made myself alone. It was me who made me alone.
<br /><br />Starting from my young age that I know I am a gay and my family cannot accept me, I drove myself out of the family. I just lean on their financial support. I do not expect family or moral support.  I was able to tell myself that I am alone now and I can live with it. I have made a different world out of my own and tried to live with it and tried to make this world of mine as happy as I can think of. I was wrong, as my true friends told me before. “You are born here in this world with people around, with your family, with your cousins and family friends; you are not alone so don’t put yourself in jail made by your own. Do not imprison yourself; you are making yourself a criminal of your own fault.” It was Marianne who told me that. She is my true best friend that she will tell it to you bluntly the truth of what you are doing, of what have you done, what it is the reason why it happens. That’s why I love her so much; she is my true best friend. That time, I knew that I am not alone and what is doing is not and should not be done and should not be going. I feel that time that am not alone. I feel that I have somebody to lean on, somebody that cares for me, somebody that I can rely on. That time, I knew what the meaning of moral support is.
<br /><br />Still my heart is away from my family that I thought, they never care about me. I have graduated high school without inviting anybody from the family, celebrates my birthday alone or some of true friends that I can just count on my fingers. I even graduated and finished my degree course that anybody in the family never knew that I was a scholar that I can finish that degree that I have earned. After my graduation that is the first time I stayed in our family house for more than one month.  Yes I am still a gay and nobody can bend it. So my family treats me like I am sick, so sick that I am quarantined for that long month. Nobody talks, nobody shares my thought and they don’t care what I wish for. Still I am inside the family alone. One time my brother tried to punch me because am a disgrace in the family. Since my Dad is working away and I knew that he will be coming home soon, I have tried my best to stay up to 2 months, a grueling 2 months of pain, tears and sadness. 
<br /><br />My father came home after few more days. That was April of 2000. So therefore, since I never talk to him for years since he was away and he doesn’t know what is happening to me. I felt that he doesn’t care about me too. A day after his rest, I ask him if I can have a few minutes alone with him. My dad says yes and I did talk to him. My dad doesn’t know how to cry that’s what is sure of. He is brave and stoned hearted. Over a cup of coffee I did not waste any second. I ask and ask and ask until I got all the answers. My Dad was able to understand me. It was the most wonderful day of my life. I remember my friend again, that I am not alone, I have still my family. And a mere kiss on his forehead was my answer with tears of joy.
<br /><br />Before I left that table as I remember, my Dad told me to try to talk to my Mom and Sisters and Brother. I told him that I cannot, I do not have enough strength to talk to them and I have a full anger to my mom that almost ruins my life. Just to hear the words like this “You better not be alive, you are a disgrace in family.” Will you come back at your family house? Will you talk to her ever? Will you have the strength and love to show to her? I don’t think so. I thought of talking to Mom. I get the strength from Dad. My Dad instead talks to Mom and we have conversation, the three of us. It was like hell. I stare at my Mom as like I don’t know her. I talk and explain. But still my mom cannot understand what should be understood. 
<br /><br />That time I have decided to grab the offer of one company in Manila. I told my Dad that it maybe my goodbye to everyone. But they can visit me if they thought they want to see me. My dad told me this “You are mature enough and you know what is better from good.” He always says that when I talk to him even when I was a little kid before. I say goodbye to Dad one morning to go to work in Manila that nobody in the family knows that I am leaving except my Dad. And so that’s life. Back to normal, to be alone and care for myself.
<br /><br />I love my job in my new place. I live to work not that I live for happy life, which should be like that. Daily routine, daily things, always the same that nothing changed. The only thing that was changed is that, I woke up in the morning to go to work not to go to the University. Everything is going smoothly and I am receiving what I was expecting before I left the family that they call home.
<br /><br />One day, I receive a call. That was year 2003, I know that Dad was already retired from his job so he is staying home only. I receive a call from my Mother which obviously makes me frightened. First, she doesn’t know my office number, second, she doesn’t even call me for long time and third, the question that bangs me “Why did she call?” My mom was crying over the phone. I ask why and I am very calm as if she is anybody. I ask why and she said that Dad was sick and found out that he has Hypoglycemia damaging the organs. The doctor said that my dad will just live his life for 2 weeks from that time. I don’t know what to do that time. I packed up and go to my room. I did not cry, instead I started to think. I was working as a chemist that time and having a part time job as a family nurse handling a diabetic person. I cannot leave immediately since I need a reliever for my patient. And so I was able to find a reliever but it was too late. My dad is dead already. I blame myself that I almost commit suicide asking myself “Why can I take of somebody else, wherein I cannot care for my Dad?” It was so unfair. I did not ask God why he is unfair, because I know I have my fault, I have a problem with my family and that is the reason why I blame myself for that.
<br /><br />I was not able to know that when I packed up and ready to go to the one we call home, somebody knocks on my door. They are my sister that they do live in Manila already. Three of my sisters are living in Manila where I live too. One is married and the other 2 are working. That was the very first time we have travelled as one. That is the first time we talk after a long period of time. I am tired so therefore I just sleep for the 8 hours drive. While I am sleeping, I keep on asking myself so many WGY’s. Why only this time that we can be whole as one when my Father is dead? Why only this time that I can meet all of our Family? Why …… All of those questions were not answered. Until we arrive in the so called home. I am calm, trying to be stone hearted, and some doesn’t recognize me anymore. My sisters are crying but I remember my Dad’s words before I left the Family home before year 2000. “You are the bravest of the whole family, I trust you to take care of them when am gone.” I go near the coffin, I ask them to open it and I hold his hand and say “YES”. And up to now, that yes is still going. It is still yes.
<br /><br />Seven days of mourning. Seven days not talking to my Mom. Seven days of intrigue around the community and seven days of shame and pain of loss. Until the day my Dad was left in his long life journey the cemetery. After that day, I say goodbye again. I talk to my family just like Dad does every time before he left for another contract of job.  I talked like father well my Mom is not there. I left my contact information to my sisters and brothers and said goodbye.
<br /><br />Going back to work is not that easy. I have pain of loss, regret that I was not able to make that time to make peace with my Mom only for my brothers and sisters. Well I just thought my words, my very own word “Well that’s life; we need to continue no matter what.” So I did. I continue, continue and continue. Until my sister visited me in my apartment with his family. It was the very first time that I had a guest in my apartment that is a family member. Imagine that, from year 2000 to 2004. Well the first visit in 2003 cannot be considered as a freewill visit, because they need to do something. It was the very first time to play with my niece and nephews. It was great, really great. Unexplainable feeling, amazingly different. Until I ask them to celebrate with me on Christmas, but my sister said no. So be it. 
<br /><br />I want to make sure that what I have said to my Dad lastly will be true to me and to the Family. My youngest brother had finished High school and I get him and live in another apartment in Manila to go to University. I look for another family apartment for my sisters Family and for my other 2 sisters. At least I can have an eye to everybody, especially to the girls. My sister finished college by her own and ask me to help here to go abroad. And so I did. My other sister asks me to send here to college and so I did. My youngest brother was also in college so I have a lot of things to cover. I feel like I am Dad but far away from them..
<br /><br />My sister left for Saudi Arabia year 2005 working for the Ministry. Then my other sister followed in 2008. I am not informing everybody that I have 3 offers waiting. One in Malaysia other in Japan and here in Saudi Arabia. Since my Dad have worked here and my 2 sisters are here, I better take a look at them so I did get the offer here in Saudi Arabia at least I have a background of things and how is it going here in Saudi Arabia. Nobody knows what I am planning, nobody knows what I am doing until my mom was able to answer my mobile confirming that my flight will be on the 18th of September 2008. So my Mom asked me why I will be going to Saudi Arabia and just a one word I was able to answer her Q. “Job” that’s what I answered and she did not ask anymore. I was working with Apple Inc. that time and my last duty will be at the 17th night shift. Cleared everything and I flew to Saudi Arabia.
<br /><br />It was like nothing happens. I have my life as it was in Philippines. They say that some of Filipinos go crazy because of homesickness, but I do not know what homesickness is until the first Christmas celebration happens in our flat. They call their family, they greet each other through phone, though messenger and everybody is happy. I am used to celebrate this occasion alone so I try to call them and say Merry Christmas and they did reply. I ask for Mom to talk to. And so my brother gave the phone to her. I greet her and she greets me. That’s all.
<br /><br />I never forget to send them money for the schooling of my brother and for the allowance of them. That was my role before. Another Christmas happens, I call and greet them and my Mom shouts over the phone because my brother was the one talking to me. I told my brother to give it to her and he greets me with a smile I think. And she asks me this, “It has been a long time son, when you will celebrate Christmas with us?” And I know that she was crying, her voice is shaking. I answered her, “Soon Mom” It is like heaven feeling. The very first time that my Mom invited me for family celebration where I celebrate it always alone. I was going to office that time and I want to go out of the bus and pick a ticket going to Philippines. Hehehe. That was the very first time that a Mom is a sweet person, a sweet mother, understanding mother. 
<br /><br />Today, I can call Philippines anytime and talk to my Dear Mother. If I am confused, I talk to her. If my job is overloaded, I talk to her and she will comfort me. This is the life that I ever wished for, but it was too late, my Dad is just watching us but not with us. I am so mad at me that I just did the effort so late. I may have this life before if I just exert a little effort. But it was too late but still I am so thankful. My mom, my sister, my brothers are talking to me like am one of the Family member now. Yes I am one of the members of the Family. Maybe I just forget that I am one of them also. It was late, but it was meaningful. Even my Dad had passed away and never sees us like this; I know that he is happy of what is happening. 
<br /><br />I miss almost whole of my life if I did not exert effort. It is just a matter of pushing a twig that barricades the relations of us. I love the love that is given to me. I love the understanding of the family and accepting me as who I am. This is me and nobody can change me, except me, myself and I. This is the life that I wish for and now I am having it and I hope to have it until the day I die.

<br /><br />It has been 3 long years and I almost forgot what love is. How does it feel to love and what is the pain you got in saying goodbye. I left Philippines because I was heartbroken. I fell in love and it suddenly it dies. It is like a flare with bursting flame at first and ends up like a stream of water that flooded my heart with pain.
<br /><br />September 2006, when I transferred to a new company and found the one that I thought was the right person for me. Have been friends since that time and started to grow ponder and ponder. Never thought that it will end and never expect that it will happen. Every moment with him is unexplainably happy, no sad moments and never knows what the meaning of sadness. We are working in same company and same team – so what I expect? – We became closer to each other and bestfriend inside the team. Throwing jokes, making fun and treasuring every moment. I never feel sadness; I never had bad times and never thought that it will end.
<br /><br />February 2008, we meet at the grounds of the company we are working with and we both have a great smile. He greets me with an ever glowing smile and I do the same. And he said to me that he will give something for me to review. Yes, we are at work that time already and of course what I thought is that he will be giving me something about work. So we go upstairs to start the night (we are working in night shift) of long work. In the middle of that night he approach me with a rolled paper in his hand, tapped my shoulders and said, “Joe could you please check if my correspondence is right?” And yes I know it was a draft, so I did open the rolled paper, ran through the message and I was shocked, HE WISH TO HAVE AN IMMEDIATE RESIGNATION. To be honest, I want to shout that time and throw a punch on his face. My best friend saw me that my face is red and she approaches me asking why. She can sense what happens. (My bestfriend Chai knows everything about me and she is my dearest sister as I treat her). I tried to be calm and make myself easy and well poised as we are in public place (work floor). I just recommend some notes and things to improve his correspondence. I write it in the way like a secretary does and that’s it. 
<br /><br />Lunch time (actually it is midnight since we are working at night), I go with my bestfriend to the restaurant and I did not talk anything about him and even my bestfriend did not talk anything about him. Silence for the whole meal session. Until he came and said “why you just left without me?” Cha answered and I did not make any noise. My bestfriend left us inside the restaurant and we talk. (I don’t like to remember the things in saying goodbye.) He said he will be going back to where he belongs and will be leaving March of that year. And I said, Is it over? And he said YES. I just stand up as if nothing happens. I filed for a leave that night and stayed in my room for 2 days. My bestfriend called me many times checking if I am ok. I told her that I am fine and am good. I changed my shift for me not to see him. But one time he waited for me and approached me in my office and invited me for a party. I know it will be his birthday. So I did say yes in a frantic way for him to go out of my office. He knows my attitude at work and outside of office.
<br /><br />At his birthday, everybody was there and enjoying while I just sat down and watch the guests of his party. I tried to be ok and fine and tried to look happy for his birthday but I can’t. I drink a lot until I got drunk. Then as I can remember he said that he will be leaving in 2 weeks time. So he invited the people again for his despidida party and of course I am one of them. Nothing happens in his birthday. It was as cold as ice and freezing like winter in North Pole. No more talks, no more grins and winks and smile.
<br /><br />Despidida party, I was there. I helped him prepare to leave, my friends were there. We cook and we sing until the time that he needs to left. The time he will leave he asks me to join him in the car going to the airport and I said no I will just join my friends in the other car. So the travel begun. We reached the airport right on time that he has few minutes before boarding. He approached me and had a sweet friendly kiss on the cheeks and a tight hug. For the last time I whispered the word I LOVE YOU and Goodbye. I cannot hide it, my tears fell down and I immediately took a taxi going home. I never had a second glance at him. It was my most sad goodbyes.
<br /><br />I cannot really forget him. What I have done is, I packed all the things he gave to me and throw it away. Even his favorite gift that he have given to me. I did put any reason for me to remember him. But as time goes by, he is still in my heart and he always makes me cry.
<br /><br />June 2008, I have heard that he came back from other country. But that time I was eager already that I will be going out of the country to forget him. I have received already the job offer. He invited me for a party again. I did join in so casual way. And I approached him like I just meet him that time saying. “Hi am Joe, pleased to meet you.” He was shocked but he got the meaning of what I have done. He insisted that time to talk to me. We go for a walk. I was so calmed and keeping myself in poise. I have told him that if he can left me like a rug I can forget him like an empty can and I will be leaving the country soon and when he comes back, I will not be there anymore.
<br /><br />I saw sadness in his face, but I need to forget him. We said goodbye and everyone departed going to each nest to rest. I did my way home still in pain and I get a good sick leave to recollect myself into one. I have cried a lot and stayed in my home for 2 weeks. I did not accept any friend. I close my mobile phones and unplug my land line phone. (I stay alone in my apartment). My sister came and checked me and I just answered am OK and they know me that I can handle everything in proper way. 2 weeks is over and I need to go back to work.
<br /><br />Back to work and it is July. The first step inside the company building, the guards told me that I look so thin and unwell. I told them am ok. Then I entered my office and started to do the job but every time I pass by his previous office I still remember him and I cannot forget him in my heart. I finally decided to work abroad. My friend told me that he is still in Philippines that time processing his papers for his job. I waited for one more week and I signed the contract to work here in KSA. I continue to work and waited for further notification. 
<br /><br />Mid of August 2008, I got my VISA and undergone procedures to leave the country for good and to forget. September 2008, it was the birthday celebration of Zachy – the son of our Manager. I was so happy to see this kid. He is so cute and cuddly.  Party had started and I never expect for late guests, and here he comes. He comes with a kid also I know the kid his nephew. He approached me and as usual, the hug is there. And he has the ego to ask me “How are you?” and I say. I should be fine. In the middle of the party our manager has informed everybody that I filed for resignation for good. Everybody was shocked and everybody is asking why. Mommy – as we call our manager- gave me the floor to explain. I told the team that I will be leaving them with bleeding heart. That they are my family already, that they are the only people that can make me happy and I regret to leave but I need too. And lastly I told them that I need to leave to FORGET. He bow his head down, I don’t know if he is ashamed or what. I saw my bestfriend Chai has flaring eyes of anger to him. As my lonely tear fell down. I said goodbye to all. The company did not let me go until I show to them the ticket going to KSA. They say that I should stay since I am one of the good team player of the company and I told them that I need to go for something and not that I do not like the company. Again my sad face was shown in HR office of our company. The Manager of HR told me that I can comeback anytime I like. That makes me happy.
<br /><br />September 17, 2008 is my last night at work. Everybody goes to my office and give me a hug, a kiss, a tap on the shoulder and somebody even give me something that will make me remember them. My trainees even gave a flow of tears. That is how they love me in the company. The best thing that I receive that day was 3 orchids with his name and note. And I throw it immediately into the trash.  So I say goodbye that night and my flight is in the afternoon of September 18, 2008. Until then, I did remove him in my mind and trying to remove him in my heart. It is like heaven and hell combined. I am happy that I made a way to forget but I am sad because I loved and forget.

<br />(I Should Leave While Am In Love)
<br /><br />It was over, I am done, I fell, I failed and I am hurt. I leave, I left and suppose to be gone, but I have tried to cope up, move on and take another step. A step that then became a leap and a leap that became a jump to a new hope. A hope that I will find the right one. The right person to love, to care and to share with my life. It is not over as they say, but it hurts and I should accept it.
<br /><br />September 18, 2008 I arrived in Dammam Airport from Philippines with my luggage and pain. He is the main reason why I left the country. He the reason why I am looking for another life, another part of my life that I have missed the time that I loved him. But I told myself, it is alright, nothing should change, it will be still me and that ME will go on. A bit of sadness and tears go on and slowly I am adjusting to the new environment that I am in. Tried to stay peaceful and calm, and tried to hide the pain.
<br /><br />I worked as if nothing happens, pretending that I am alright. But deep inside I am broken, broken into pieces that I am trying to fix and pick one by one. It is not easy, I maybe far from him and from the memories that we have shared but he is still inside of my heart. Three (3) months had past and I am now ready (as I can see) to face the new ME. I wind up around and am myself. The pain is almost gone but I can still see the scars.
<br /><br />January 2009, I have my residence permit and I am allowed to go around anywhere I like. I have tried to sit in coffee shops, restaurants, go to some places and meet some nice people. I have this one favorite place that I always sit in with my laptop and chat with my family back home. This is one way of moving on and getting connected more to my family since I did not have more time to be with them when I was in Philippines. As time goes by and my routine stays the same, it is like a piano tune that never raises a note or even makes it in falsetto. 
<br /><br />One February evening, it was a nice peaceful weekend and a bit cold. I decided to visit my favorite place in that coffee shop. It was full but my favorite was just like reserved for me. I sit down and turn on my laptop. The waiter came and he took my order (This waiter almost knew what I want every time I am there). As there are lots of people, the place is a bit noisy but not that loud so I decided to use my earphones. Listening to music and having done with a blog entry for the month. It was really cool night. The moon is shinning and the sky is clear and the weather is great. We call that weather as “the tail of winter” it was chilly cold with dry wind.
<br /><br />Here comes my coffee. Warned by the waiter that it was hot, I decided not to touch it yet. Well focused on what am doing and to my computer, I did not noticed that somebody was in front of me asking if he can join me in that place since there are no seats available. I stand up and say sorry (a gentle gesture of Arabs), and I said please you may. I did not mind him; anyways we are not friends or anything. Still continuing my work on a set of poems, he suddenly cracked the silence in that place asking why am so serious of what am doing and that was the second time (he told me) asking me. I did not hear him since am listening to music (Music is not allowed to be heard by Muslims in public places). I said sorry again and remove my earphones. I sipped my coffee and told him that I am writing something. That was the time that I saw his face directly and scrutinizes every inch of his appearance. He has a blue eyes, well designed mustache and beard. He started to talk and he is fluent in English but he is so serious. So I tried to fit in on his mood. He introduced himself and I introduce myself but I did not give my complete name since it is hard to do that here in Saudi Arabia. He asked me about anything he wish to know and I throw some questions too. Then he asked me if I usually have time to stay in that coffee shop and I said “yes I am always here if I have free time”. Then we both drink the coffee and had a long conversation and he knows how to smile and laugh that I did not know he can since he is a serious type of guy.
<br /><br />Another February 2009 weekend, I grab my computer and directly headed to the coffee shop. It was dusk after the prayer time. When I proceed to my place, I smiled because I saw somebody is there. (The place is actually at the corner where you cannot see the TV screen and most of Locals go there to watch football match while drinking coffee with friends.) Most of the time, nobody wants to take that seat before and the coffee shop was not full. He was there in my place reading a news paper. So I turn around and look for another seat. The only thing I don’t know is that maybe he felt somebody is coming to such place (my favorite seat) so he put down his newspaper and he saw me looking for another place. Then he called me and smiled. He asked me “You don’t want to seat in your favorite place?” I just smile and said “Yes of course I own that part of this coffee shop, I actually rented that for a year.” And I smiled, he laughed. He invited me to seat with him and so I did. I was not that talkative to avoid everything along the way hehehehehe. He started the long, long conversation that the coffee shop closed for the last praying time but we are still inside the coffee shop. We finished 2 cups of coffee and we reached 12 midnight. It’s getting late so I asked him an excuse to go home. I was shocked when he said “would you like a lift, I can bring you home.” I just told him, “no thank you so much but my house is just 5 minutes walk from here.” He said, “No it’s ok you will not pay the gas of my car, it’s for free.” Then I laugh and I cannot say no. That time, he knew where I was living. That meeting in coffee shop continues.
<br /><br />Until March 2009, I never saw him again. Well who is he anyways, it doesn’t matter. April 2009, I was amazed and shocked when he suddenly appeared in my place again. I don’t know but I feel happy to see him again. We are not friends. I approached him and said hello. He shook hands and what is more shocking when he greet me in a local way (kissing the right cheeks and saying salam). So I did reply also in local way. I asked him where he go the past month. He told me that he was in Yemen doing some Military Peace Keeping Force from Saudi Arabia. That time I knew that he was in Military. I got curious and I ask some questions about personal things. I just knew that he is an aircraft engineer working in Ministry of Defense (Naval Force) and he is doing the ground tactics. I said, “you are to humble and it doesn’t show in your face that you are a military guy.” But I said thank you (I usually give thanks to our uniformed men for keeping us safe), then he laughed ask me why I gave him thanks. I told him that I gave thanks for keeping us safe. And I continued, “I will not believe you until I see you in uniform with your rank on your shoulder.” Hahahaha it was a funny joke and he laughed to. We talked a lot until we exchange emails and mobile numbers.
<br /><br />I will never forget March 27th 2009. My phone rang and I do not know who is on the line. Well, I answered anyways expecting that it was a call from office. It was Friday and it was a weekend but my boss loves to bother me in weekends (this pisses me off). He did not answer immediately until I said ‘who’s on the line please?” Suddenly I hear his voice and I said “kick your ass military men, how are you?” He said he is fine. So I asked him why he called, instead of answering my question he asked me to go down the house. I grabbed my trousers (we are not allowed to wear shorts in this country) and rushed down. I saw his car but I cannot recognize him. I doubt to come and meet the guy in his car. The guy is wearing a navy uniform and wearing RayBan glasses (classic). I am going to turn around and go back when he called again, now he said, “where are you going am inside my car. I want to invite you for a lunch at the beach.” So I said ok. (Locals gets pissed off if they invite somebody to eat with them and they say no.) I come over and he went out of his car and removes his glasses. He was smiling like he is pissing me off. I entered the car and the time he sat down on the driver seat, I punch him hard on his shoulder. And he laughed so hard and asked why. I told him “I thought police is catching me for something.” And he really laughed so hard and said. “Nobody can touch you here even police, I am here habibi. (Means close friend).” And I said “Oh really? Now I believe that you are a navy but I do not believe that you can be a hero.” And he said “You need to test, am serious.” No comment at all and a sudden silence. I told him that I will not go out of the car and eat at the beach restaurant with him in his uniform. So he told me that I need to give him three minutes to go to his house and change his clothes.
<br /><br />We arrive in his house, I did not go out of the car instead I waited. Exactly 3 minutes he came back and I was in total shock. He is wearing denim and shirt. But the shirt couldn’t hold his big masculine body. Now you can describe him as a HUNK, he is perfectly shaped. Not showing to him how I was really attracted to his physique, I don’t look at him too much. It was a complete silence when suddenly he flicks my ears (I was listening to music). And I shouted, it hurts “Ouch, the hell you are.” And he laughed so loud. I punched him many times on his right shoulder and then I stopped and he asked “is that all you’ve got?” His shoulders were so hard like you are punching a stone with a very thin cushion. I just said, “Hell you are, it hurts.”
<br /><br />We arrived at the restaurant and we come in. We sat in Arabic style of eating (squatting on the floor). I just raised my brows and smiled and said, “I know you don’t like to eat in this position, but I like and I dominate, you did not win yet on challenges.” So I ask what challenges. He said “if you make my shoulders violet in one punch then you win.” I laughed because I don’t know that he has this kind of sense of humor. I cannot do anything, so I just sat down and wait for the food. I was in total shock when I saw the bunch of food. One whole grilled chicken for me and a mountain of Arabic rice. A local yogurt and a half liter of juice. And I said “Am I going to be executed after this meal?” He laughed again and said, “That’s how big people eat, a feast and since you are with big person today, you should eat just like how I eat.” So I just said ok.
<br /><br />After about an hour of talking and eating, we finished lunch and we went to the beach to grasp some fresh air. Then I asked him to bring me home. Then at that moment he said, “Before I bring you home I will tell you something.” And then I asked what. I don’t know if I will like it or not but I hear it from him. He said, “Can we be more than friends?” and I said, “Like what?” He said “Like partners, I will be there if you need me and you will be my inspiration.” That time I kicked him really and he was too fast that he blocked my foot. And he laughed so hard and said. ‘You will never win habibi, you will never win. But I will lose something and I know you will win.” He started to be serious again. And I said, “Kick your ass Military men, don’t make jokes or I will kill you with my bare hands.” He laughed so hard and grabbed me with his one hand. He hugged me from the back that I can’t breathe because it was too tight hug. Then he bite me in my right ear and said, “Ok try to kill me now.” He continuously laughs. And I got pissed off and gave him a blow from my elbow on his stomach. Now I was able to get away and I am the one laughing Hahahaha. I sat down again and he sit beside me and ask seriously. “Will you let me love you? Will it be possible?” I did not answer instead I just smile.
<br /><br />We continuously meet each other if he is free and I am free. Until we found out that we are developing a good relationship. Time goes on; everything seems to be happy and great. Everything is like a sparkle of a star. And it is like the world never ends. He calls me from time to time but I never called him. It was great to be with him. I feel so safe and I am very happy for the first time after I get broken. I prayed and hope that this will never end. 
<br /><br />We continue our affair of love and relation, until the time that he told me, I need to go to the gym and make myself fit because he feels awkward when I am with him outside because he can just lift me with his finger. I just smile at him until January 2010. He came to me with a card. Then I can’t read it since it is Arabic. He told me, come with him tonight and we will go somewhere and just show the card to the person who will ask. So since I trust him so much, I joined him. He pick me up at 8 PM and then drive through for a very short wile. Just about 2 minutes, we stopped. I asked why and where we will go. He smiled and said, “come with me, you should see people because you are just hiding there in your room like a prisoner.” So I went out and join. I was amazed when I enter the door. It was a gym, and the gym instructor approaches us and said, “Sir, are you a new member?” He said immediately, “Yes, he will be a member from now on, habibi give him the card.” The gym instructor was shocked when he called me Habibi. Then he left me by the counter and the gym instructor guided me through. When I asked the front desk if how long will be my membership, he told me that it will be valid for 3 months. I just said ok.
<br /><br />About to start the training he approaches me and said, “Be good ok.” Then he introduced me to his friends inside the gym. So I started the proper training until I get addicted to gym. He doesn’t need to get me from home and bring to the gym. I just walk and we meet there. Building up and everything is going fine but I am feeling a doubt that something is happening.
<br /><br />I did not see him for a day. The he arrived late the next evening in the gym. So I asked why. He just said that he was busy with his job in the naval base, so I just said ok. Not minding everything, my job gets worse and worse. I need to do overtime every night that I am so tired that I miss some of my gym schedules where we usually meet. He called me one time and get angry. Asking why am wasting the time. I told him that I am too busy with my job but he did not accept my reason. I promised him that no matter what happen I will be in the gym as he wished and so I did.
<br /><br />Slowly everything fades away like clouds from the sky after the rain. The sky went bright and the sun shines. And that cloud would be him. I did not see him for long time. February, March, April, May. I thought he was lost already. He is gone. I am continuing my gym training with my own membership already. I never expect him to come back. Yes, I was in love with him and I thought he is also. Time passes by and one night he arrived. He just shook my hand and said hi. 
<br /><br />I know he is there already so that nights I send an offline message in his Yahoo messenger and he did reply. Tried to talk again and he again replied. In the long run of the conversation, the person on the other line slipped and said a word which is my mother tongue and I asked who he is. Then I called him over his mobile and it is off. I send an SMS and suddenly he replied. That time I thought that he is cheating.
<br /><br />Next night I saw him in gym and I did not greet him and nothing happens. The guy behind the magical Yahoo messenger showed up and he make a face unto me that just like saying, “get away from my partner.” I never talked to him until one day he called me. He told me if I can go out with him and I told him NO. That is the first time I said no to him and I mean it. That time am not sad nor happy. I just said to myself, “This is me and nothing will happen no matter what, Joe will still be Joe and nobody can change me. I am the rock that nobody can break.
<br /><br />The next night in the gym he approached me and said sorry and I told him directly on his face. “It’s ok not a problem for me. It is better to see you happy with somebody than to be with me and you feel lonely. But why him? I don’t like his attitude.” And he just smiled. And then he ask me, “Can we still be friends?” And I say Yes but that same friends before. I need to leave you while am in love. And that’s the end. We see each other inside the gym but we never talk to each other.

<br />Isn’t it beautiful?
<br /><br />I can see the twinkle of your eye
<br />The smile from your beaks
<br />You want to try to fly
<br />Fly like a big bird in the sky
<br /><br />Be free little bird
<br />Spread your wings and fly
<br />You don’t have to worry
<br />Wind will always be under your wings
<br /><br />Spread you wings little bird
<br />Spread it as you can
<br />Try to fly and be free
<br />Fly as high as the sky can offer you
<br /><br />It is such a good feeling
<br />It is such a nice adventure
<br />I wish I will be a bird like you
<br />Free to explore the sky
<br /><br />Fly . . .  oh fly
<br />Fly little bird  . . . fly
<br />Offer us the beauty of the sky.
<br />Give us your sweetest smile
<br />Fly oh fly little bird.

<br />With a silent gush of smile.
<br />With a sweet breeze that everyone loves.
<br />But I was wrong.
<br /><br />I thought my life is like the river 
<br />That freely flows to the open sea
<br />Silently rushes to embrace the beauty of life
<br />But I was wrong
<br /><br />I thought that I have the sky.
<br />So blue and wide, 
<br />With cotton fields of clouds,
<br />But I was wrong.
<br /><br />Everything falls down,
<br />Everything burned out
<br />Everything was lost
<br />The time you left me.
