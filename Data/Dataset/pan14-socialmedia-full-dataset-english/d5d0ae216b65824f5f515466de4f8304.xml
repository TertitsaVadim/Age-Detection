Because of its extensive and profound content, it involves the medieval social life, cultural life and spiritual life in every area. and contains the history, philosophy, political science, theology, religion, culture, arts and literary allusions. The use of symbols, metaphors and allusions could be found everywhere, which increases the difficulty of reading and results in many people today could not get the connotation. However, in that gray era that has led all sincere people to go through the dark life and across the towering dome in the life door. Finally when the people look at the night sky, they can see the dazzling starlight. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5sdW11Ym9vdHMuY29tL2x1bXUtdWdnLXNsaXBwZXJzLWNvcXVldHRl" target="_blank">ugg slippers</a> are in the First Place in the List of Most Wanted Finds in 2009
<br /><br />Engels once praised to say, “The end of the Medieval feudal era and the beginning of modern capitalism is marked by a giant figure.” This figure is the Italian Dante. “He is the last medieval poet,&quot; because it means that he is the medieval rebellion;&quot;but it is also the first poet of the new era,&quot;which is reflected in his contribution to the Renaissance humanism. The poem &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; is devoted all his life to this masterpiece of Dante. The whole work is divided into three parts: &quot;Paradise&quot; and &quot;Hell&quot; and &quot;Purgatory.&quot;Most Dramatic <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5hbmRyZWFtamV3ZWwuY29tLw__" target="_blank">Pearl Jewellery</a> In Vogue
<br /><br />On April 7, 1300, at the Easter of that year Dante Ali and Eli are both 35 years old, and they occasionally lost in the &quot;dark forest&quot;, finally fled the forests and started to climb the mountain in front of the forest. In the occasion when leopards, female wolves wanted to bite him, BeaTerri came to the earth following the order of Virgin Mary, and immediately called the soul of the Roman poet Virgil from hell to rescue Dante. The absent Virgil said to Dante that if he wanted to return to the real world, he must go through hell, heaven and the community to pure crime. Therefore, the two poets began the travels of the three states. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5sdW11Ym9vdHMuY29tLw__" target="_blank">ugg boots</a> , Most Fitting Most-Wanted Pieces for Mother
<br /><br />Throughout the whole work, albeit take the rescue of dead as a clue, the theme should be human salvation in the real world. On the one hand, he satirized and castigated the evils of society for he had realized the reasons of Florence’s chaotic political situation, the political darkness, which all caused by the intervention and rebellion of King and the Pope. Therefor, he had written those who were hated by people like the political opportunists, the believers of flattery, the corrupt persons, as well as the gossipers, the sowers of discord and those betraying the party and selling out the country into the chapter of hell. In addition to the exposure of the darkness of society, he also try to specify a journey towards brightness for human and so that the poem can end with happiness. He developed the doctrine of the medieval Christian. He did not simply spread the Christian sentiment of personal salvation, that is, strongly hoped to be forgiven for their evils on earth by God, to avoid suffering the pains in the hell after death. This included non-human factors.
<br /><br />Dante’s The Divine Comedy was full of brightness of humanism. The god took the form of supreme origin of love which showed righteousness and virtue, but he is not omniscient, people can not obed him blindly, but rather should strive to pursue their own happiness and ideals. At the same time, Dante also denied the church ‘s intermediary role as the role of an individual savation, and he mercilessly revealed the corruption and hypocrisy of the Church. The constancy and struggle of hell ghosts, the noble and climbing of Purgatory, as well as the sanctity and calm of heaven gods touched people. Through the hell and the purgatory, which mean human recognize their mistakes and sins, and thus wake up, turn over, access to get new life. Nobody can die twice, but suffering the death can make people have a deeper understanding about the meaning of life. Dante chose to face the limitation of life, leading people through the hell, and thus better understood the true meaning of life and the value of human existence. As Maylezkovsky has pointed out, “By inviting the death, Dante wanted to know how to behave as a human being, individually and collectively?”

The present work is with long work time, and the treatment is not so good though giving one people with two people's workload, and the boss requires a lot, but for learning more experience, I would have resigned early. Top 10 Fashion for Valentine's Day You are not supposed to fill yourself with extreme dissatisfaction if your workload is not that unreasonable or you are not at all good at your present job. Hey! <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5sdW11Ym9vdHMuY29tL2x1bXUtdWdnLXNhbmRhbHMtaGFsZW5kaQ__" target="_blank">ugg sandals</a> are the Favorites of People in Mumbai Instead you should try to get accustomed varied responsibilities by seizing different opportunities to show yoursef so that you can make yourself an indispensible member of the company.
<br /><br />Does it stand to reason that you should hop to a better company since you have a high education degree? Staying in this small company with a master’s shinning ring always seems not so pleasant. Watching those former classmates hopping into big-name companies one after another, you can’t help considering how to follow up. In career, degree is a threshold, but definitely not the unique &quot;job-hunting property&quot;. Besides, skills, personality and attitude are also important elements in forming self-advantages. Before changing a job, look into &quot;your own ability&quot;, then talk about changing conditions.
<br /><br />Will your letter of resignation make the boss angry at you when employees are stretched to limit? If some of your colleagues left the company the end of the previous year, is this a suitable time to talk with the boss about your resignation when the company is short of staff. Unless the boss suggests that you should resign, office workers will inevitably be faced with emotion pressure when offering a letter of resignation. The basic approach is to be informed of the company’s schedule first and then to express your will to resign.
<br /><br />Dose the company not fit for me, nor do I not fit for the company? If the work can not make the individual merit come to play, many people would be very dissatisfied; while if the company did not timely give recognition and respect, the office workers would also feel dissatisfied. If it is the office workers who don’t not know how to project themselves, or their abilities can not match the working demand, even if they have an exaggerated sense of their own importance, they should be back to claim their own pace to catch up with the company, rather than blindly look forward to the company to catch up with them.
<br /><br />Job hopping is the quickest way to ask for a higher payment? Want a higher payment, but it seems to be rare in the current company, someone suggested achieving this goal by &quot;job hopping&quot;, is it feasible? Many companies will give a higher payment than the average level to make it when they are proaching talents. However, when you get into the new one, you will find that there are not so many opportunities to develop as you expected. At that time, you may not get this higher payment for much long time.
<br /><br />Will frequent job-hopping be not good for your later job-seeking? Will it be so frequent that you just have a job-hopping to this company because of your unsatisfication of last work, and if you will change it again this year. Generally speaking, an office worker who is around 30 years old should not change the work more than 6 times. You should never rush to change the job before making a proper evaluation.
<br /><br />Is it necessary to make up a good reason for resiganation? Since you have made great efforts on the resume to express how much appropriate you are to the job you are applying for, is it necessary extricate your yourself with a sensible reason? As to the office workers, the curriculum vitae and the letter of resignation, is just as a admission ticket and billing, one is used for admission, the other is used for paying for the past, it is suggested that a better approach is to provide a direct interview with the director on your resignation, and honestly told him/her the reasons.
<br /><br />You do not like this work or you do not like working? If you are ambitious, and when you meet some work that can not arose your enthusiasm, you should get away soon. However, this point does not include people who are originally not interested in any work. If it is the matter&quot; work&quot; that you are tired of &quot;, you should evaluate whether you should adjust your mood or have a rest for some while, and go start after you have a good rest.
<br /><br />The next work will be better? You do not murmur at the present company, and can go on the work without any problems, but you just simply think that only the change can provide a better job, dose the thought work? Before changing your job, you should evaluate yourself carefully that what you really are. Do you have enough abilities and energy to suit with a new job? The more understanding your abilities and bottom, the more possible you get the best suitable job.
<br /><br />Is your mind perturbed at the sight of others’ hopping? Your good friend wrote on the blog that he or she had hopped to a satisfying big company, with salary quadrupled; the colleagues in the same company once intentionally or unintentionally implied that they “want to have a try in a different environment”. Should I also take advantage of this opportunity? If you just follow the crowd,watching others have a good result after job-hopping,that you also want to follow up is often not worth the candle.Calm down,list all the advantages and the disadvantages and analyse your professional and preferences.That is the last thing to do before considering to change the job.

However, doctor Anga from a well-known London hospital said, &quot;In the event of heart attack, you can not try to lose weight, because the extra energy inside the body can have a protective effect.&quot;
<br /><br />In the annual conferance in Vienna, doctor Anga said, for those older patients with heart disease, it was the safer way to keep the present weight once the heart attack had happened. For those younger adiposities, they should hurry to lose weight to keep in the healthy weight to lower the danger of getting a heart attack. Anga once had an article published in the press have pointed out that for elderly patients with heart disease, the body mass index between 30 to 35 people, the survival rate is higher. In the opposite, no statistic or sign showed that losing weight can made the disease better. And some old patients with heart disease were not getting better after losing weight either.
<br /><br />Doctors encourage obese patients to lose weight in order to reduce the prevalence of heart disease. It is a scientific proposal for young people, but for the older people, it does not work.
<br /><br />Similarly, doctor Anga says that, like patients with heart disease, patients with cancer should not lose weight, or their lives will be in danger on the contrary. Among the cardiopathy sufferers, those with adiposity get better effect on treatment. For the patients with chronic diseases like kidney disease and cirrhosis, their survival rate will be higher if they are overweight. That's because the fat in overweighed people provides sufficient energy to them. For people who are underweight, heart disease in these populations more difficult to be diagnosed, that is, unable to advance the prevention, once the disease may be more insidious.
