It is on the Shanghai Road. We decided to meet at 11:30 a.m. at the restaurant. When I came in that restaurant, I could feel the Indian’s feeling because I could watch the Indian video from the TV. Then we sat down, and we ordered the food.  I looked at the menu; there were a lot of food. I ordered some food that I haven’t eat before such as Taj’s Special Soup, Chicken Chaat, Chicken Tikka Masala and Chicken Pakora, I thought it was very nice. We were waiting for the food, and then tasted it. I thought it was a little bit hot and the Indian food was full of curry. I don’t like the peppery things but I knew that curry is good for health, so maybe I will eat it more often. We also had something for drink such as Mango Yoghurt. I really love it! Finally, we had some desserts such as ice-cream which was very nice. After finishing our lunch, I sat together with Gr.12 mentors and took some photos. I don’t like Indian food very much but I think it has it own style. I really like the environment there because it makes me feel warm and happy. In all, that was a wonderful lunch and I really enjoyed the time with my friend and Gr.12 mentors.

I went there with students from 10 F, and we enjoyed our work there. I thought that is not an easy work for me. We helped the shop assistants to put the books in the order, and walked around the bookstore. We also helped the bookstore to make some table. I thought I can work well with all my group members. I learnt that we must distribute our work and be a person who has sense of responsibility. We can’t always sit there and talk with each other. During this process, I gained few things about me. I can’t be lazy; I feel that the volunteer work is not easy as I think .After this process; I really felt that work is very difficult and tired. At some time, my friends went to have lunch, so only me stay in the bookstore. I need to walk around the bookstore more frequently. Sometimes, I really felt tired and bored because bookstore is a quite place, we can’t talk loudly. The most important work is making the tables. We work in groups, I told the numbers to the Edison, and he made the table on the computer. I thought it was the time that showed our team work, and we all did it well. For this volunteer work, I played the role as the shop assistant; I do think that was the good chance to me, and I thought that must be an unforgettable experience to me. From this experience, I learnt how to talk to the customers, and that made me more audacious. I had an experience, when I worked there, there was a foreigner, and he didn’t know the price of the book, so he asked me. I told him the price of the book, and he said thank you to me. I felt very happy about that. I think community is very important to us because it can let us know how to talk to people and give the experience to us. I am an outgoing girl, so I think it is not difficult for me. I think we can learn some social experience too. We can know how to comminute with others. In all, I really enjoyed this work and know that it is difficult to make money and in the service trades, it is important to be polite and always smile to the customers. This is what I learnt from this experience.

We appointed to meet each other at 6 o’clock in the evening. We chose this German food because we thought German food must be delicious, so we decided to go and try it. This restaurant is near the Xuanwu Lake and its name is Secco. 
<br />     I really love this kind of food because I love the steak and pork. I ordered pork and it was really nice.   I do think it’s different than food I usually eat because in China, we always eat rice, but in foreign countries, they often eat steak or pork, so maybe some of the Chinese people can’t adapt to eat this kind of food. This restaurant’s environment was really attracted by me. It’s not a big restaurant but it is very special. It has dark light. On the first floor, there was billiards and it’s a bar. On the second floor, it’s the place for food. The restaurant had lots of Blues that make us feel really clam. There were several customs sitting near us. They were the foreigners. I thought the service was very good because the clerk was a polite lady. I would like to recommend other people to eat there because it’s worth to try it.

All of the GCA students attended this concert. Our class decided to get involved in this concert, so everybody from class 10D would sing the song. The name of the song was When Christmas Comes to Town. This song is from the cartoon. It was really a nice song, and everyone in our class loves it. We practiced a lot before the performance. We practiced the song during the Self-study courses and after school even in the English class, so it spent us lots of time on practicing. Everyone in our class tried our best to learn it even the song’s key is very high, some boys still tried to get that key. I felt very honor and lucky to get this chance to perform in front of the whole school, so I want to show my singing skills. When I stood on the stage with lots of lights, I felt I like a super star. Also I felt a little bit nervous because that was my first time to sing in front of so many people. I thought we complete the performance successfully. That was the first time that I performed with the class, so I felt really happy. I thought everybody sang well. That experience made the deep impression to me. From this performance, I knew that group work is very important and our class is very united. I love all my classmates!

This is the popular activity in both Canada and United States. I went to the park which was near our school with my classmates and Ms. Headley on 28th of April after school. That was Wednesday. We held some signs in our hands. It was written Warm Hug. It meant that we can give hugs to the strangers. 
<br />    When we arrived at park, I felt a little bit nervous, so I dare not to ask someone for a hug. Gradually, I noticed that I must have the courage to ask people for a hug. I asked old women for hug, she agreed and smiled happily, and then we took a photo. But I still met someone was not understand us and didn’t polite. I asked a women and her mother, I explained what we were doing, but that women just glanced to me. I really felt bad even angry. Lydia comforted me and then we tried to find other people to ask. It was really a long time to find another people. Overall, I thought this activity was nice because that was another way to show our friendly. That was my first time to hug some strangers and I really felt a little bit shy. I really love this event because it can let us be braver and let us know how to communicate with others, and this was a good chance for us to learn something.

I really think Dancing Club is a well-organized club because we have an excellent leader and helpful club members. Our club is very nice because all of the members are unite and we all love dancing very much. During this process, I noticed that I had some new idea about dancing. I realized that I must be very diligent and can’t be lazy any more. If I want to improve my dancing skills effectively, I need to be very conscientious. When teacher is teaching, I can’t be shy. I know that I must use all my strength and try my best. Our club is extremely famous at GCA because we are the people who only care about dancing in our free time. We have a dancing class once a week. In that class, we invited a famous dancing teacher to our school and teach us how to dance. He teaches us some basic things and tells us don’t be lazy and practice every day. It’s very convenient for me because the dance studio is very far away from my home and school, so it saves my time. Also it’s good for my health. Sometimes, we will have some battles. Some of them are in school; some of them are battle with other school’s students. This is a nice way to improve ourselves, I feel happy and excited when there is a battle. I prefer do more exercise rather than eat less. I really think it is the good way to keep fit. Although dancing is very tired and hard, I still want to keep it. To be a good student doesn’t mean that all we need to do is study, we still need do some sports and be healthy people. Good health is really important, if we sick, we will don’t have energy to study. GCA is a splendid school that pays more attention on students’ health and study, so all the teachers in GCA encourages us to do some sports. This club really matches my personal fitness goals because I want to keep fit and be a fantastic dancer. If I don’t dance hard, the dream will not come true. I truly love dancing, but I am a student now, I need to put effort on study, so I can’t put all my energy on dancing. That’s the limitation. From this club, I know feel things. First one is, if I want to do something, all I need is to keep it and don’t give up. Second one is, it is really difficult to organize one club. The leader of dancing club is Only; I think he is a capable person because he can organize well. I will learn from it. These are some valuable things that I learn from this club. In the end, the last thing I want to say is keep on dancing!

He is an architect. His duty is to design the different kind of buildings. Lin Shengsan works in the Nanjing Jinghai Design Engineering co. this company has about 160 people and this is also a highest level of architecture in China. He is a kind person. I asked him about the qualifications which means what the requirements does the company demand. For this question, he said must graduate from the university and the major is Department of Architecture. It would be better if we do the job shadow because that could be a good experience for us. Also, you must good at drawing. In Nanjing, the eastern south university is famous for this major. When I asked how he entered the profession, he answered that he thought that art can include a lot of things such as drawing, painting and sculpture. Architect is also a part of the art. He thought he can design real buildings is very cool and that was the dream when him was young, so he chose this major to study and tried to go to a good company. He felt glory and also a sense of accomplishment when he finished one work. I also asked him what he usually did during the work time. He said that he usually searched the internet for some information about buildings and then made the design because he loves studying. It has two ways to design the layout. One way is use the computer and the other way is use the hands. In the 21st century, almost every person uses the computer but Lin Shengsan prefers to use his hands to design. Searching the internet for others design is really a good way to improve skills. When I asked what some of the challenges he faces in his job are, he said all he need to do is to find the way to design the building which was safety and have a sense of times. I know that this is difficult because every architect can design buildings but he must have his own style and unique insights, and then design some unique things. For the rewarding part, he said he could get money from the company if he put the effort in the work, or got bonus for his wonderful drawing. Everyone has an idol; his favorite idol is a man whose name is Bei Lvning. He is a Chinese, and he designed a lot of famous buildings. He also told me an interesting story about his job. He said that when he first contacted his job, he was really interested in this job, and all he thought was made a beautiful design. So he tried to draw a wonderful layout for his son. Finally, he succeeded. When he gave the layout to his son, his son felt delightful. Then, I finished my interview. I think this job is very cool, so maybe I will choose this job in the feature.

It can be a dancing class, playing badminton and running. So, we have lots of choices. We can choose what we want and to finish the portfolio. For me, I choose some of my favorite sports such as basketball. I went to Wu Taishan twice a week with my father because I thought that was a good place for exercise. We usually run around the track, play basketball, play badminton and play Horizontal bar. Horizontal bar is the thing that can train our arms; I also play it in the P.E. class. Sometimes I had some competitions with my father and we all enjoyed it. I remembered that once I had the badminton competition with him, and we played it for almost 30 minutes, after that I felt tired and drank lots of water. During the competition, there were some things really interesting. The wind was very strong so that my father couldn’t touch the ball because of the wind; he just ran left and right and tried to get the ball. That was really funny. Running is another sport which is really tired, but my father told me it’s good for vital capacity. Basketball is my favorite sport, I always watch the NBA at home. So I am very familiar with the basketball rules and always play it at school with my classmates. So I can play it well even exceed my father. That is most delightful thing to me. I also learned few things about me as an athlete. I realized that to be an athlete is not that easy. If we want to be an excellent athlete, we must do more trainings than others. Everyone who wants to be famous and gets the award cannot be lazy; they must keep on practicing although it is very boring because they just repeat one thing over and over again. It is said that if you want to succeed, the only thing you can do it repeat to do one thing. That is the most difficult thing for the athlete. Sometimes they might get hurt, that is the worst thing to them because that means they can train anymore. After this process, I knew that personal health was extremely important because if we don’t have the healthy body, we can’t do anything. So I will put health at the first place. There are also some benefits to myself. This the good way to keep fit. I couldn’t eat nothing that is bad for my health, so the only thing I can do is do more exercise. Also, I don’t want to be a student who always studies because the life will be very boring. For my personal fitness goal, I want to be healthy, so I just follow it through! My father and I are both used to this life. Now, I think this kind of lifestyle is nice and I will keep it.

The first place I went to is the Foreign Bookstore, and the second place I went to is Nanjing Jinghai Design Engineering co at 9 o’clock. I felt really sleepy. That was a company which designs the buildings. This company was not very big and there were about 100 people work there. The people there were very kind. My duties were to clean the company and helped the office worker to print something or deliver the water to them. I noticed that all the office workers were very conscientious. When they worked, they didn’t do anything else. That is what I need to improve. When I do my homework, I should not play the computer or play with my mobile phone. The first thing I did is clean the floor, at the beginning of it, I thought it was very easy, but after finished my work I felt really tired. I felt my back was pain. I cleaned 3 floors which made me dull, and I couldn’t imagine how the cleaner keep could do it everyday because this was a most tired work in the company. All office workers need to do all the things in perfect order, and they spoke in a low voice because they didn’t want to bother other people. I tried to learn how to draw the layout from the building designer, but I failed because I really not good at drawing. Then I walked into the office, the person in charge told me to print the paper out. That was a boring work, I just stood beside the printer and put the paper in and got the paper out. Next, I helped people to carry things to 3rd floor, it didn’t have the lift, so I must go upstairs, after that I felt really tired but I didn’t get the chance to relax. I cleaned the table right away. I felt that work was very difficult and tired. I realized that there are some differences between individual and collaborative workers. For individual work, you must be independent. You must complete all the things by yourself. For collaborative workers, the most important thing is team sprit; they must work together and share the idea with each other. After few hours work, when I went home, the first thing I did is lay down and drank water.  Overall I thought that was a good chance for me to learn how to comminute with other people, I knew that communication is extremely important because if I have some different ideas with other people, I need to talk to them. I leant some life skills such as how to do the housework and how to organize things well. Also that can be an experience for me because I know I lot of things before I go to work. From this experience, I learnt a lot of things and that can be my treasure in the feature.

The performance was began at about thirty past three o’clock in the afternoon. This puppet show was held in the Youth Theater which was on the Shanxi Lu. The name of this show is San Mao Liu Lang Ji. We chose this performance to see because we haven’t seen the puppet show for a long time, and we all wanted to see it again and find the feelings when we were young. 
<br />    This show told the story about a poor kind child called Sanmao. He was a waif and was very pathetic. He didn’t have any relatives and need to make a living on his own. He did a lot of different kinds of work such as selling newspaper. His uncle used his ignorance to let him do some bad things, but when Sanmao realized that these were bad things, he stopped from doing them. Also, he didn’t like the life in the rich family, so he escaped and wanted to find his own life.
<br />    For me, I like this show because it tells us some meaningful things. For example, I know that if I meet some dilemma, I should not give up, just believe myself and keep doing it, and then, you can be succeeded. Although this show was a little bit childish, I still saw it from the beginning to the end. This show can let us think more about our lives.

The title of the exhibition was Where New Zealand Meets China. There was only one artist, his name is Cao Jun. this exhibition was held in the Jiangsu Provincial Arts Museum. Cao Jun is a person who paints traditional Chinese paintings. This exhibition was held from 18th April to 28th April. Cao Jun is a famous artist and he lives in New Zealand. People from New Zealand called him dissemination of Chinese culture messenger because he usually draws some traditional Chinese things. He can use the traditional way to show some contemporary things. He has already had his own exhibition in New Zealand and had his own arts museums in Shandong, Yangzhou and Wuxi. 
<br />    I took a photo at the entrance; it showed whose exhibition I went to. When I went into the museum, I was shocked by so many paintings. I love paintings but I am not the person who is good at painting. Then, I walked around the museum; I found that Cao Jun’s works are very large sized. Suddenly, one of the works grabbed my eye. That painting’s name was Return of King. The subject of this artwork is a lion. I saw a strong lion on the picture. When I went near to the painting, I saw some grass and water. I thought the lines there were very soft. The picture’s color is a little bit dim; the artist didn’t use the colorful paintings to paint. For a closer look, I noticed the expression in lion’s eyes, it was athesim. I didn’t know the textures of this painting because the conservator didn’t allowed people to touch it. 
<br />    This artwork made me feel desolate. I thought the lion’s eyes were firm. I thought that this lion must be a male. I made this guess from its body. From this painting, I remembered the lion that I saw in the zoo. They are almost the same. So, I thought Cao Jun was a good artist and had the extremely high art skills. The artist might want to show the momentum of the king of the lion. That was a king of the king, when he came back, he might made people feel a little bit scared and be afraid of him. So, the artist’s intention is to show this atmosphere.
<br />     I really think this artwork is successful because they are really make deep impression on me. I think this kind of artwork is my style because it shows some traditional things such as flowers, trees and animals. These are the good points. Cao Jun uses these artworks to tell the New Zealand people what the china is and let them to know more things about china. He really makes the good communication for both china and New Zealand. Cao Jun is very famous in both china and New Zealand. So, I f I have this chance; I will buy his artworks because this is very valuable and maybe appreciate.

I did lots of activities almost every day. The most thing i did was dancing. I had dancing class every week. That wasn't my first time to go to dancing lesson there. The dance studiowas called Crazy Tempo Dance Studio which there lots of people from different schools and companys. I thought dance was not that difficult for me, but i was in the wrong. When i learnt after the teacher, i found it was really hard for me, i knew that it's very difficult for dancers to be sucessful. We always do some basic exercise before learning the whole dance movements such as ligament pulling. I always break into a sweat during the warming time. The dance movements were not difficult , but if we wanted to dance like our teacher was not easy. The most important thing in the dance is feeling. For the newcomer, we couldn't find the right way to dance immediatly, but we could practice. The classroom was not big but were full of students. Some of them were really get down, and some of them were really shy, but i knew i must get down because i wanted to improve, and i wanted to be the best. Through the dance lesson, i made lots of new friends and we always dance together and they always tell me the problem i had and the solution. I love dancing, so i went to dance studio almost everyday. The lesson lasted two hours, it was a ordeal for me. Also, i got it's benefit to my health.
<br />       Except dancing, i also played badminton , running, skating and other activities. I think exercise make people healthy, so we need to do exercise in our daily life. I really enjoyed my summer holiday. Dancing is really match my personal fitness goals because i want to health everyday.

This two restaurants were extremely good that i fell in love with them. I went to Bella Nappoli with my best friend Lydia on 27th of November in 2010, and i went to Blue Sky with Edison and Freeman on 8th of May in 2011. Both of them made the deep and nice impression in my mind.
<br />	Bella Nappoli was located in Deji Plaza. When i first went into this restaurant, i was attracted by the corking atmosphere. Most of the customers were foreigners because this restaurant made Italian food really well. I ordered the seafood risotto which was really delicious.  It was differ from what i usually eat because it added some tomatoes. Also, the service there was really good. 
<br />	Blue Sky was like a bar restaurant, there were TV, Billiards, beers all around the restaurant. It was a Australian restaurant. I ordered Lasagna this time, it was really delicious! I really loved it! There were tomatoes on the top of the Lasagna, and the Lasagna were really soft and not greasy. Everyone loved this Lasagna very much. I saw lots of foreigners playing Billiards, and they were really good at it. The beer there was good. This restaurant had a thick of foreign atmosphere, and we ally loved it. 
<br />	To sum up, i strongly recommend these two restaurants to you because they were worthy to try, and i hope you can have a good dinner time with all you friends and families.

During the grade 11, i did a lot of different kinds of activities in my free time because i wanted to keep fit and be strong. 
<br />	I did lots of activities such as basketball, badminton, running and exercise equipments in my community. Every weekend, i went downstair to do some exercises with my father. I practiced shooting with my father. Actually, i thought basketball needed strength to shoot the basket, so i tried to be strong. I loved running best because i was in the school track and field team when i was in primary school. I remembered that my running teacher always told us running is the best way to exercise, so i keep on running during the spare time. Moreover, there are many exercise equipments in my community which are really convenient for area residents. I usually use those equipments to do exercises.
<br />	Fortunately, we have P.E. Classes every Tuesday afternoon, we play basketball, ping pang, volleyball and so on in every class. I must say that i learnt a lot about how to play these balls especially how to play golf. I haven't played it before i learnt this golf class, so everything was very curious to me. I tried hard to learn it although i couldn't play in very well. I think this is the good chance for us to exercise because we really don't have much time to exercise everyday.
<br />	By these exercises, i learnt a lot. First of all, exercises play the vital role during our lives because it's good for humans' health and exercise determination. Physical activities are really tiring and boring, so if we want to get good figure or good health, the only thing we can do is persist. Same in study, if we put effort into it, we must get satisfied result. Secondly, when i finish exercise, i feel comfortable and i am not always sick, so it really matches my fitness goal. I believe that everyone especially girls want to have a wonderful figure, so doing physical activities is the best choice. However, i feel that the time for exercising is not enough because we have a lot of stress on study and we need to get ready for applying for universities. During the daytime, we are really busy because we have the different classes, and after school, we have homeworks, projects and presentations to finish, also we have lots of quizs, tests and provincial exams. Even during the weekend time, we have IETLS and TOEFL classes, so we really have little time to take exercises.
<br />	So, i strongly recommend all of students to take some time for physical activities as following reasons. Firstly, it can make our bodies stronger, and not easy got infection by those virus. Secondly, it can let our mind relax, and breathe the fresh air.
<br />	Consequently, starting exercising immediately please!

It was really differ from Auto exposition because it had nothing to do with cars. It was hold in Nanjing Art Gallery which located near 1912 plaza.
<br />	 I remember that i have visited one of the exhibition at the same place last year and it was really excellent. I saw lots of great paintings last year.  So, when i went into this gallery, i felt really excited because i know that the exhibition there must be really cool and fascinating. Therefore, i went to this exhibition with my friend Elsa on 20th of April which was Wednesday. 
<br />	This exhibition was held by Su Weidong, a famous Calligrapher in China. He was born in 1936 in Henan. He has written Chinese for 60 years, and finished lots of far-reaching art works. His works are sold about 1 million RMB. So, it was my honor to visit his exhibition. 
<br />	The exhibition was not require for tickets, so we went directly and took some photos. When i first went into the exhibition, there was not lots of people, but some elderly were taking photos and carefully study of his calligraphies. I thought it was differ from others exhibition because all his works were not big scales paintings, but they all really nice. Suddenly, I stopped in front of one of the works which was plum flowers on the top and Inscription below it. The drawing technique was really superb because he draw each petal delicately. Also, the calligraphy were really powerful and strong. The color of plum flowers were very pretty which was pink. I can read plum's perseverance through the calligraphy and painting. So, this was really a good art work.
<br />	Then i continued to go to the inside of the exhibition, i saw lots of different calligraphys such as painting of apples and poems. However, i was attracted by an enjoyable painting with words on it. That was come from a Chinese proverb &amp;amp;quot;vegetables or Radish, whatever you like.&amp;amp;quot; It demonstrated that different people have different flavours, so everybody can choose what they like and regardless of other people. That's really cool, right?The painting was really vivid, and i really fell in love with it.
<br />	To sum up, In my opinion, i think this exhibition is really worthy to visit because it shows the spirit of the Chinese calligraphers and shows the face of the Chinese people. His strong Calligraphy skills shocked a lot of people including me. Thus, i really enjoyed this exhibition with Elsa because it let me to know more about Chinese Calligraphy history. We believe that life can not continue without art, so i really love arts, and try to appreciate art. So, if i have a chance, i would like to visit more exhibition like this.

I went their with my friends on 5th of August. We got up at about 5 o'clock and took a taxi to arrive at there. A large group of people were lining up to wait for entering. We waited for about one hour, and then got into the Expo. We ran to the Thailand gallery directly because lots of people ran as well. During the waiting time, i saw Australian gallery, French gallery were near Thailand gallery. I was really excited when i was allowed to get into this gallery. It was really fascinating and attractive. I saw a 3D movie in that gallery and knew lots of historys about Thailand. After that, we went to other gallerys such as Czech Republic gallery, Belarus, Turkey and Nepal. I would always remembered the ice-cream that i ate in Turkey gallery because it was so delicious. In fact, the gallery that i most wanted to see was Spain, but the huge amount of people made me scared, so i didn't line up. 
<br />	To sum up, Expo. was really majestic and magnificent because it showed different cultures in different countries. I really thought it was worthy to visit it although the sun was hot. The trip to Expo. let me know more about other countries culture, customs and local conditions. Therefore, i believe i can adapt the environments in lots of countries. Nowadays, Expo. was torn down because the government think it occupied lots of lands. I feel so sad because i think it worth that. All in all, i really love the Expo. tour.

Therefore, i chose to go to Christianity church to see what was it like. It was located on Mouchou Road. Before i went there, i asked my parents about taboos that i could not do in the Christianity church. When all are ready, i went to there with my friends Freeman. 
<br />	When i went in the church, i asked a woman if we could take photos or not, she allowed us to do it. Coincidentally, there was a speech. That woman closed her eyes and said lots of things. However, i could not understand what she said, so i just listened it quietly. Then i went into the hall, i saw some people in there and pray, and there was a Cross in the middle of the church. Everything was new to me, but i thought it was good. I didn't want to bother them, so i quietly took some photos and then go upstairs. 
<br />	I really love the feeling in the church because it was really quiet. In my mind, i think church is a divine place that no body can bother it. It was my honor to visit a Christianity church because i haven't seen any churches before. This religion experience really make deep impression in my mind, and let me know more about religions, i hope i can visit there again.

I really enjoyed myself in these clubs because we always have some activities to do at weekends. 
<br />	I was impressed by one of the activities that the leader of cooking club Iris organized. On one Sunday morning, we went to a cake shop and tried to do our own biscuits. That was not a easy task for me, but i tried my best. The cake division gave us some different flavour doughs, and then we began to make it.
<br />	Firstly, i chose the flavors which was chocolate, strawberry and lemon, and then cut part of it. According to the requirements of cake division, i balled those doughs and then Squash them. Next, i use different molds to press on the dough, then different models were made. They were flowers, elephants, hearts and so on. I finished my model of biscuits, and then started to help other friends. I taught them how to make the dough thinner. We made the model by ourselves carefully, when we done, we all had a sense of accomplishment, and felt satisfied. Finally, we asked cake division to bake the biscuits. We waited for about 30 minutes, and we smelled the sweet smell from the oven. Finally, we got out delicious biscuits!! We tasted them and packed them in order to bring them to home. This was a really nice experience that i ever had because i know the steps of making biscuits, and maybe i could make it at home.
<br />	Moreover, in badminton clubs, i practiced playing badminton with students.we went to badminton court to practice. Sports were always a good way to keep fit and make our body strong. So, i really liked to play badminton because it was easy to learn, but difficult to control. Another club was DIY club, this club was formed by Stella, and she was in order to practice our practical ability, and make some small troys by on our own. I made a sun flower by myself. It costed me about 3 days to do it because it was really hard. When i finished, i felt so happy that i could make my own troy.
<br />	All in all, by these school clubs, i learnt a lot which i could not learn in daily life. I knew that if i wanted to accomplish a task, instead of myself, i also need some suggestions from my friends. We can share our ideas and then make final the decision. Also, i practiced my practical ability by making troys and strengthened my body by doing some sports. Therefore, i think school clubs are really important during our school life because it represents our GCA and good for all of the students. So, i strongly support to continue to have these school clubs. That will be the most precious and meaningful time in my memory.

My friends Freeman, Edison and i went to the exposition on 1st of May because we all love cars especially sports cars. The exposition was hold in Expo center and it was far away from our homes, so we chose to take taxi to get there. 
<br />	We bought the tickets and then came into the exposition. The varieties of cars really attracted us that we didn't eyes off those roadsters. The whole exposition was divided into four sections which were A, B, C and D. 
<br />	We began our exposition trip from the first section. There were some popular cars in this part, we saw Chery QQs, Volkswagens ,Buicks and so on. A lot of people were there and took some photos with those beautiful cars models who stand beside those cars. They were all really beautiful and attractive , and the cars which against the backdrop of them appeared more beautiful. When we came out of the first section, we saw the Test Drive Section, and i wanted to try it! However, i didn't get this chance because i don't have the Driver's license. That's a pity!
<br />	Next, we moved to the 2nd section, but we felt disappointed because the cars there were so common and not cool. Therefore, we went to the section D directly because there were a lot of SUPREME sports cars which we were expected to see. I was shocked when i came into there, Lamborghini, Ferrari, Bentley, and Aston Martin were placed there. These cars were so cool that i had hardly seen in the real life because they were extremely expensive, and the people in the working-class can not afford them. More and more people were come in front of these supreme cars and took photos. I was really interested in that pink Bentley sports car because i loved the color and model very much, so i took a photo in front of it. This car was sold I was determined to study and when i grew up , i would by it. When I went to the end of the hall, lots of big RV appeared in front of me. They were so appealing that i could not move my eyes off them. I haven't seen such a large RV before , and people around me praise these cars a lot during the whole gallery. 
<br />	In my point of view, i thought this cars exposition was so wonderful that i would not forget it during my life. I was a person who was fond in cars so much that i always buy some cars books and watch some news about cars. I also know that if i don't put effort into my study or work, i will never get money to buy this kind of sports cars, so i try my best to study and work. Thus, this exposition really made a deep impression in my mind.

This play was for little children to watch, but because we all have childishness, so we went their and enjoyed ourselves.
<br />	This play told us a story about three little pigs who had different characteristics, building their own homes in order to defend themselves and their mothers. However, they had different ideas and have contrary on building homes. Thus, they decided to build their own homes. The eldest pig Huanhuan built a straw house which was really vulnerable, the second son Miaomiao built a stone house which was much better than the first one, and the third son Naonao built a cement house which was really firm. Therefor, when the wolf came, the first two houses were both destroyed by wolf, and both Huanhuan and Miaomiao went to the third house to have a shelter.
<br />	It played by real people with figurative costumes, so it really attracted lots of children to come with their parents. Moreover, the players had lots of interactions with those children in order to make the atmosphere better. 
<br />	In my opinion, i loved the scene with three little pigs consociated together resist the bad big wolf most because it showed their unity and audacity. It enlightened me that in my whole life, i should be really brave when i got into some troubles and never gave up. Consequently, i really love this childlike performance.

		<document id="f261150c1f7ffe11899e0c8b7559a72" url=""><![CDATA[Volunteer experience(1)<br/><br/>During the third term, i also had some volunteer works as what i did in grade 10. I was impressed by one of the volunteer works which was work in Nanjing Jinghai Design Enginerring Co.,LTD company. It was a architecture company which designed all kinds of buildings. I went to there with my friends Jane, Elsa and Helen,
<br />	When i first came to this company, i felt nervous because i was afraid that i could no behave well. I couldn't do some works which required skills because i didn't know how to do it such as drawing sketch of buildings. So, i chose some easy works which i could do it. The works that i was in charge of were organize files, wipe the tables and do some forms. Actually, they were not that easy because i need to be really cautious. I need to be methodical when i organized files because there were a lot of different file. This was really a tough task because if i didn't pay attention, it might be wrong. 
<br />	The second task i did is wipe the toilet's table, it was really nausea that i felt unpleasant. It had bad odour, so i really didn't want to enter that room. However, i still went into this toilet and began to wipe the table. There were water everywhere, and all i need to do was clean it. Then, i used mop to mop the floor. The floor was so dirty that i must mop it twice. When i finished these works, i felt tired and exhausted.
<br />	The last thing i did was use computer to do some forms. It was hard for me because i could not use it proficiently. However, i tried my best to do the best forms. When i gave the final forms, the manager of this company said i was good.  
<br />	To sum up, in order to make work efficient, i need to concentrate on my work and be careful. Moreover, not all the works were smooth, i also did some mistakes, but the people there were so nice that they didn't blame me , in stead, they taught me how to correct the mistakes. Thus, i felt very warm just like at home, and i really love this company.
<br />	Although the work was difficult, i still learnt some skills such as how to organize files and persist to doing one thing. I believe this skill can make me be a structured person in the future. Also, i learnt how to communicate with different kinds of people, i know that i would meet all kinds of people when i came to work, so communication was really considerable to me. Moreover, i also know that money is not that easy to earn, so, i need to work hard to get good salary in the future. Therefore, i believe that this volunteer experience must benefit to myself through all my life.

I went to do some volunteer works with my friends Edison and Freeman. That was my first time to work in a KTV, and actually, i didn't know how to service for customs. So, i really felt excited and nervous.
<br />	When we went into Lollipop KTV, the manager led us to a small room, and distributed works to us. My works were organize bottles and deliver the food to every rooms. Organizing bottles were easy to me, but deliver the food was not that easy. As we know, people who do the service sector always need to be polite, and they need to smile every time they see the customs. Therefore, it was a big challenge for me. I organized bear bottles in the commissary which was belong to the KTV. It was easy because it didn't require one's IQ or physical strength. So, i didn't feel any stress and toilsome.
<br />	However, when i began to be as a attendant, i felt really hard for me. I could not imagine that what kind of customs i might meet. When i got the food from the kitchen, i used plate to hold the food and then delivered it to a room. The floor was really slippery, and i almost slip on the floor, fortunately, Edison gave me a helpful hand, so i did not fall down. Otherwise, i would fell down, and the food must be spilled out. When i stood in front of the room, i knocked the door first, and then said&quot; excuse me!&quot; Those customs were really friendly, they smiled to me and i gave a smile back. Yet, i also got into some troubles. Because of my carelessness, i dropped one cup of juice on the floor, and the water splashed on one customs clothes. I felt intense because i didn't know what should i do. However, i came to the quick response, i said&quot;sorry&quot; and gave paper napkin to her. She was not that angry, in the contrary, she said &quot; Are you a novice?&quot; i felt embarrassed and apologized again. When i got out of the room, i took a breathe, and felt satisfied with what i responses because it was my first time to meet this kind of problems.
<br />	To sum up, this working experience was really impressive during my life because it was my first time to be a waitress in a KTV and communicate with different kinds of customs. It would be a good lesson on the path of my growth, i learnt how to communicate with other people and how to correct the mistakes. All in all, although the works there were not very easy, i still enjoyed this working experience, and i hope that i can get another chance to work for Lollipop KTV.
