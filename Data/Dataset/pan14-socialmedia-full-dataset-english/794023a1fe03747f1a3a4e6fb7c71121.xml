Get A single or Two Aromatherapy Books&lt;/b&gt;<br />Pick just one particular or two guides to start your aromatherapy library. Pick textbooks which are general resources, that will give you some basic info and allow you to discover the areas through which you've essentially the most curiosity. Two of my favorites Are Colleen K Dodt's &lt;i&gt;The Vital Oils Book&lt;/i&gt;, and Joy Bowles' &lt;i&gt;The A-to-Z of Vital Oils&lt;/i&gt;.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;2.

Cats, in particular, may be adversely impacted by essential oils. Make sure crucial oils are kept out of reach of children.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;10. Don't Ingest Essential Oils&lt;/b&gt;<br />Although you will examine conflicting data about taking essential oils internally, you need to steer clear of doing this.
