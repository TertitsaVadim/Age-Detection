No foundation or structural changes are necessary, as stone veneer becomes an integral part of the surface. So today you may also need to know more about the installation steps if you are planning to do it yourself.
<br />Step1: Surface Preparation
<br />Cover entire surface with 3.4 expanded metal lath, overlapping the joints using 1-1/2&quot;- 2” nails. Over an existing wood surface, nails should be six inches (6”) apart in every direction, with extra attention to being sure that nailing is through all existing studs. Overlap all joints and at all corners, and never leave a lath seam at a corner. Overlap at least 6&quot; on vertical seams, and 2&quot; on horizontal seams. Use tin snips to cut lath.
<br />Step2: Trim to Fit
<br />Most veneer, including that made with our instructions, is easily shaped or cut as desired. This will enable you to “fit” stones easily into place to insure a natural looking wall with tight mortar joints. Cutting or shaping can be done by using a circular saw with a masonry blade, a wet saw, a hatchet, maul and chisel, or wide mouth nippers, (horse hoof nippers).
<br />Step3: Apply Mortar to Stone
<br />Butter the Stone. Using a trowel, apply approximately 1/2&quot; to 3/4” of mortar to the back of each stone piece, covering the entire back. Butter one piece at a time, just prior to applying the stone piece.

<br />    Scatter single, loose leaves across your mantel, our idea is to make the leaves look like they gently fell from a tree. Be sure to mix up the colors and arrange them in slightly different positions to appear natural.
<br />    Place large leaves under candle holders, small clocks, vases, and other accessories on your mantel.
<br />    If leaves are not loose, rather attached to faux branches, gather the branches together like a flower arrangement and place in a clear glass or autumn colored vase to place on one end of the mantel.

But as the infrastructure of roads etc. in Poland starts improving, more and more foreigns start focusing on the market, it is likely that some Polish companies may conclude, as many of their companions in Germany and France already have, that it makes more business sense to buy from abroad than try to do everything by oneself.
