And the data stored by the computer is first coded by the software in order that it can be read by that computer. The sensor scans the data entered in the system. It detects the finger create or voice or iris and compares the entered data while using the existing coded data. The biometric gun vault is a much secure way of storing firearms and ammunition which uses advanced biometric technology.
