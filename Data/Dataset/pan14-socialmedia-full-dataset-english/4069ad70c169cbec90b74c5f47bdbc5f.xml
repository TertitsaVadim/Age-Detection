<br /><br />That experience gave me a good lesson, and I admit that I am more matured after going through it. 
<br />We human beings should try our best to enjoy the happiness of life, right? Forget about those rainy days, just let it go. Coz I believe that there's someone who's waiting for me on the way to my future, he will be someone I can count on and trust, he won't fail me in every way, he will treat me like a princess and love me with all his heart, he won't hurt me if he know it in advance, he will be free that everytime I need him..
<br /><br />Goodbye, old days. 
<br />Welcome to my new life!!!

<br /><br />Just sometimes, I want to travel to somewhere for few days to relax myself, but it's kind of impossible after having my little hope.
<br />My dog is more handsome and totally different from the very beginning now, I like every way he acts except the time he bites me badly,  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/angry.gif" alt=":)" /> But he means no harm, he just want to get more attention from me, and wants me to play with him.
<br />I really feel sorry for him that leaving him alone at home for the whole day, and I still can not spend too much time on accompanying him as I have a lot of things to do, like cleaning up, cooking, feeding we both... ... 
<br />Sometimes, I hope he was my little boy, and one day he can take good care of himself very well, like how much he should eat per meal, not pull my everything all around, maybe read some books to kick boring away.
<br />Nowadays, he likes to sit on my knees and eat from my hand, he's so lovely and cute boy.
<br />I like him, and I do want to look after him very well..

<br />They are the beautiful monsters in this world, and i can not let them escape from my eyes. Same as beautiful sights. 
<br />I love to find and catch the tiny and beautiful part of life, which can make me feel brave and relax. I'm not going to envy the luxury life, coz there's no luxury thing in my blood. I'm not going to grab or seize anything, coz no one can own anything in real, we are all passengers on this earth, we born with nothing, and die with nothing. And all I can do and want to do is to see more sights on my trip, to make my short trip as interesting as possible. I'd love to learn and see things, if there's anyone who want to show me, that' ll be better. 
<br />But anyways, I'm happy that I'm a girl.... ...

<br />I received a call from my mom last night, we talked about savings and my brother's marriage, and I fell bad.  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/huh.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />I know it's the time to pay them back as I should do, but I still wonder that if I can live a free and relax life for myself, just like others do. I didn't have much savings, but at least I can live very well on myself, and I don't need my parents to give me a helping hand any more. 
<br />I don't need to count on someone else and closed to work forever like other girls did, I mean I can live well on my own, and I live safe and happy with my earnings. Money is nothing but a tool and the basement of life, and more money doesn't mean you will live a happier life.
<br />I am not saying money is useless, but it's not as important as life itself. Mom, I just need a free and easy atmosphere which can help me get close to my future. Coz I can not enjoy my life and each everything under those pressures...
<br />And I'm still not sure where I am standing in this world... I am confused. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/dry.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />PS: My dear brother, I know it's hard, but if I were you, I won't get married if my finance situation doesn't allow me to do that.

<br />The sun was clouded and flowers faded away;
<br />When you stopped calling,
<br />The music vanished and the room started to cry;
<br />When you stopped calling,
<br />The devil monitored my thoughts and my mind went wild;
<br />When you stopped calling,
<br />The tiny insects kept on biting my heart and made it bleed badly;
<br />When you stopped calling,
<br />You shut your door.
<br />When you stopped calling,
<br />I felt bad.
<br />When you stopped calling,
<br />I felt down from the heaven to the hell.

<br />When the heat left,
<br />The wind starts to blow,
<br />gently and slightly.
<br />As the noises were locked up,
<br />Dusts were taking rest in the corner,
<br />peacefully and quietly.
<br /><br />High above our heads,
<br />It's the mysterious blue velvet sky,
<br />beautiful and lovable.
<br />The moon feels shy and hides up,
<br />Stars start to play hide-and-seek there,
<br />smart and naughty.
<br /><br />We are shoulder to shoulder.
<br />We are hand in hand.
<br />We walk in the same rhythm.
<br />We make eye contact from time to time.
<br /><br />Can you feel the warmth of mine,
<br />When you hold my hands firmly and even my body?
<br />Can you feel the thrill of my heart,
<br />When you lift up my hands and settle it on your chest?
<br />Can you feel the emotions shaping in my eyes, 
<br />When I look up at you and both of us ain't saying anything?

<br />Kiss me in the wind...  ...

<br />I heard some bad news from your side
<br />And it comes as a small stone which 
<br />Creases the peaceful and resting lake in my heart
<br />Leaves me a restless mind
<br /><br />You should know that
<br />I care about you
<br />As much as I did before
<br />No matter what we are
<br />And where we are standing
<br />This care is still there
<br /><br />You tell me that you are so sad to know that 
<br />I had a new BF
<br />But
<br />If you are so sensitive
<br />How can’t you feel 
<br />How sad and depressed I was,
<br />When you stopped messaging me?
<br />Why can’t you feel 
<br />How desperate and helpless I was,
<br />When you stopped calling me?
<br /><br />You tell me you are sad.
<br />But why?
<br />Aren’t you feeling happy for me that
<br />I find someone who
<br />Loves me more than you
<br />Cares me more than you did
<br />Likes to share every tiny thing with me
<br />Willing to face everything with me
<br /><br />I don’t regret falling in love with you before
<br />And, I won’t regret to leave you either
<br /><br />Why not go and find someone else who’s better than me?
<br />As long as you are safe
<br />I’m happy for you.
<br /><br />Do take care.                                   ---------------Agape  2011.08.22

<br />But her voice is good anyways.
<br /><br />Well, I always imagine how it will go on once my life stopped suddenly, like drving on the highway, or on the train of a tour, or in a fligh of a business trip...  ...
<br />Maybe nothing will happen, just few people will think of me from time to time, that's all. 
<br />I read a book last weekend, an article tells&quot; we all come with no name.&quot; It surely is. We all have no name after born, and we are putting everything on ourselves to distinguish our own from the rest, what's that for? One day, we died in an accident, everything will sealed with our death.
<br />That's the real fact, not beautiful or memorable at all.

<br /><br />I don't want to say this, but I gain much weight indeed.
<br />And the reason is nothing but work and life.
<br /><br />Busy, and not happy as well. Should I act like an adult, like focus on earning money and try every way to achieve that? I do want to change my current job, then I started to notice that I've already held up by it, Miserable me.
<br />Close, but not satisfied. They say family is most important, and we should be happy as they come to visit us, but why can't I feel the same way? Everything messed up, it seems like my heart and ears are too full to accept anything. Less patient, bad-tempered... what's wrong with me? I just want to flee away and get rid of those things. 
<br />Don't wanna talk, don't wanna hear, don't wanna see, why can't I live alone and without bothered by anyone?  
<br /><br />Finally, food left. The most comfortable and best friend of mine, it tastes sweet, and it makes me feel like wrapped by happiness when I eat something sweet. 
<br />Then, in it's considerable care, I fell asleep... ...

<br />I like to bow my head and walk, focus on the ground in front of my shoes, it makes me feel like the world is so small that only I lived on it, sadness are everywhere;
<br />When I was sad,
<br />I like to stay in the house, lean on my bed, look at my little hope sadly, watching him bites my shoes hard and stubbornly, leave tears flood on my face;
<br />When I was sad,
<br />I like to recall the memory, sitting at the table with pen in my hand, but no any single word will be written, it seems like the sorrow is so thick that it blocks the spring of my creativity, the inspirations all died.
<br />When I was sad,
<br />I like to be cared, like a dog, stay in master's arms quietly, feel the gentle touch of master's soft hands on the head, and so down for the feeling of being loved.
<br />When I was sad,
<br />I like to keep silent, just be quiet, lean or lay down, even stay in the bed for a whole day, neither move nor eat, neither listen nor look, just don't want to be bothered by anything;   
<br />When I was sad,
<br />I like to buy snacks, like a mouse, take all my favorite food back home, choose whatever I like, eat as much as I want, no one can stop me;
<br />When I was sad,
<br />I like to watch a movie, the sadness will fade away while I was watching it, till I played the role totally, i will laugh or cry, fall asleep afterwards, never gonna wake up; 
<br /><br />---In fact, we should be alone when we were sad; and when you were sad, remember to love yourself more or even spoil yourself a little bit.

What if I did all things I failed to do, you might be cured and waiting me at home now...
<br /><br />I am used to waking up and seeing your joyful face
<br />as you are always fresh and delighted
<br /><br />I am used to taking you outside and showing you to everyone
<br />as you are famous and my shiny star 
<br /><br />I am used to your trying to climb up my knees and licking my face
<br />as you are so cute and lovely
<br /><br />I am used to hearing your begging noises while eating my snacks and feeding you with another hand
<br />as you are pretty childish and naive
<br /><br />I am used to your paws attaching to my leg and asking me to carry you in my arms
<br />as you are still timid and young
<br /><br />I am used to calling your name and talking to you while I feel lonely
<br />as you are very considerate and understanding
<br /><br />I am used to giving you a bath, drying you up and touching your head
<br />as you are too small and more like my baby
<br /><br />I am used to buying breakfast with you and going to market with you
<br />as you are a little curious toward this world and ready to go
<br /><br />I am used to thinking about you while at outside and keeping in mind what you like
<br />as you are my little boy, my love and my everything.
<br /><br />I am used to the new and happy life you bring to me, and I cannot stop it.
<br />You left a hole in my heart, and it's bleeding all the time, as everything will remind me of you. 
<br />You know what, I bought a new book to replace the broken book you bitten and borrowed from library, I will cherish it for my whole life as it was a gift from you. 
<br /><br />But my little boy, I'm so sorry that:
<br />I cannot warm up your cold and stiff body,
<br />I cannot wake you up, kiss your forehead and tell you that I love you.
<br />I cannot stop your life passing away
<br />I cannot do that, 
<br />my little boy.
<br />How much I wanted it back, but I'm so helpless...  ...
<br /><br />My boy, will you still love me, if you know that I am the murderer???

<br />But I got a little confused.
<br /><br />What is love?
<br />--Love should not be sex. 
<br />Love is love, it's just a strong feeling, nothing more than that. You can attch the happiness of sex to love, but love can never be replaced by it. 
<br /><br />--Love should is not despotism or surrender.
<br />Someone spoils the one he loves, even if his lover wanted drugs, he will go and get it;
<br />Someone confines the one he loves, &quot;bab, this is not good for you, that's not good either... okay, take this...&quot;
<br />We can not give up or take someone's freedom away, we both need to compromise a little bit, make sure he/she is alive and happy, that's all. 
<br />No one want to take further steps with you if you insisted the way you like instead of what your love like, coz none of us will love a person who always stops us from doing everything. 
<br /><br />--Love should come with responsibility.
<br />Love me, and be mine. You can never say it easily. But it's not equal to marriage either.
<br /><br />Love? 
<br />I'm not ready for it now.
<br /><br />You love me?

<br />Well, that would be so lovely.
<br />Recently, I read a book, it tells about the love letters of those great men in the history, like Napoleon, Balzac, Tolstoy, and etc. 
<br />I must say that nature is so frail when a human falls in love with another person (no matter it's a man or a woman), the emotions start to burst out from our chest and sometimes it is so easy to be turned into anger or hate. 
<br />Anyone who indulged in love will become a good author or a talented poet. Sometimes, the feelings exceed words, and all we can do is to stare at the one we love and feel the marvelous love running around inside our body. 
<br />&quot;Can you feel the love inside my heart?&quot; Lovers always ask this stupid question, but unfortunately---No, they can't, coz it's your own treasure, it's your own fortune that no one can take it away.
<br /><br />I love to write, or to read. I love the feelings the author gives me, I love the languages human created, and that's how my life becomes more beautiful and lovable.
<br />&quot;My adorable husband, I would like to compose love letters for you. 
<br />Will you be happy to read them?&quot;
