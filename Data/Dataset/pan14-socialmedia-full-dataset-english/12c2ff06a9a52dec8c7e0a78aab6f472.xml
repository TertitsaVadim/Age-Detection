<br /><br />in one day you can have 3 people fuck you over but that hurt as bad as the one u say u luv turns and fucks u over
<br /><br />now wat r u supposed to do? u might feel like diein but u arent gonna try it!!!
<br /><br />i guess u could say thata it'll all be okay, that's just to reasure urself that it'll all go away!!!!
<br /><br />but in all actuallity it's not gonna go away until u come to realize u made the same mistake u said u'd never make again!!!
<br /><br />if our parents told us that life was gonna be so shitty then it might have saved us a lot of heartache or if we would have just listened!!!!!!
<br /><br />point blank u can tell urself over and over ur not gonna make another mistake!! but wat ends up happenin? u eventually make more mistakes!!!
<br /><br />cuz that is the way of mankind to be cruel and insensitive. life will always be a mystery!!!!!
<br /><br />i wrote this in 2005 later trina leave a comment if u want to say wat u think and be honest people for real i dont want fake ass comment either!!!!!!!

<br />it my way i luv u but i hate u
<br /><br />the part of me that luvs u wants to 
<br />keepa relationship going, but the 
<br />part that hates u doesnt want
<br />anything to do with u
<br /><br />i feel this way cuz of the day u choose
<br />to leave behind a life that could have 
<br />meant something
<br /><br />two little beautiful gursl and a handsome 
<br />father lost someone! the little gurls were 
<br />6 and 3 but almost 4, the father who was 
<br />26 when the 6 year old was born and 
<br />was 29 when the 3 year old was born, he 
<br />was in the navy and goin to college both of those were full time and then he was a full time parent as well, leave all the stress of raisin
<br />them on him why dont u?
<br /><br />why couldnt u both have just let the feelings
<br />go? if u would hav there probably would be two
<br />happy little gurls! but no u couldnt do that for 
<br />the sake of ur two little precious daughters!!!
<br /><br />so if ur two little gurls r really messed up 
<br />mentally, its all of ur damn fault!! i hope u have
<br />fun tryin to figure that one out! just remember
<br />that ur two little gurls are now 18 and 21!!!!!
<br /><br />so if u dont get the respect u think u deserve
<br />than dont be surprised, cuz of the fact u diserted a husband and two precious little gurls
<br />that trusted u!!!!
<br /><br />i dont now how to say this so ill say it my way
<br />i luv u but i hate u!!!!!!
<br /><br />just remember ur little gurls will never be able to luv u fully but they can hate u for not
<br />bein there for many important occasions!!!!! 
<br /><br />i wrote this in 2005 fot the fact that i was tryin to get to now my mother who left when i was almost 4 years old!!!!!!

<br />ur scared and nervous
<br />u both think that ur doin the 
<br />right thing butu then come to 
<br />find out ur just pissin 
<br />the other person off
<br /><br />luv isnt easy and u now it
<br />but wat can u expect? not 
<br />a perfect fairy tail i hope!
<br /><br />when u fall in luv let it come
<br />naturally and u will be
<br />perfectly fine and have no
<br />problems to deal with it
<br /><br />when ur in a relationship 
<br />things ru supposed to come
<br />easy or os u think but not
<br />every relationship is 
<br />supposed to be simple
<br /><br />u both r gonna make mistakes
<br />but it takes time to change
<br />to fit into eachothers lives
<br />or style
<br /><br />when u start out u dont now wat
<br />to expect but time comes along and
<br />u both change or mold to fit the 
<br />relationship
<br /><br />after a while u start to hang with
<br />eachothers friends and then u really
<br />get to see wat they r like to 
<br />other people and u realize that u do
<br />luv eachother and wanna be there 
<br />to help the other one out no matter 
<br />wat happens
<br /><br />when u get to that point its a new
<br />step to take forward but ur catious
<br />bout it cuz u dont now wat to 
<br />say or do
<br /><br />u both take baby steps all the time 
<br />but thats only cuz u both r still 
<br />nervous bout one another
<br /><br />u finally get passed the point bout
<br />bein nervous with eachothere and the
<br />relationship goes so much better cuz 
<br />neither one is holdin back
<br /><br />u need to now that when that happens
<br />u take another huge step in the
<br />relationship to make it happen for both
<br />of u
<br /><br />cuz a relationship takes two people to 
<br />make it work and happen and takes amjor part of time from both of u
<br /><br />so if ur not interested to make a relationship
<br />then u dont need to have a man or gurl in 
<br />ur life do u??????
<br /><br />i wrote this cuz i had started havin problems in a reltaionship at point and it helped me and him out
