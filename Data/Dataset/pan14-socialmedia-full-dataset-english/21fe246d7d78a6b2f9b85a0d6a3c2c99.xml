<br /><br />&quot;Har zarre par ek qaifiyat-e-neemshabi hai 
<br /><br />Ai saaki-e-dauraan yeh gunahon ki ghadi hai&quot; 
<br /><br />- Firaq Gorakhpuri 
<br /><br />&quot;We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are 
<br /><br />endowed   by   their   creator   by   certain   inalienable   rights,   that   among   these   are   life, 
<br /><br />liberty, and the pursuit of happiness&quot; 
<br /><br />- American Declaration of Independence, 1776 
<br /><br />Over   two   centuries   have   passed   since  Thomas   Jefferson  wrote   those 
<br /><br />memorable   words,   which   are   still   ringing   in   history,   but   a   large   section   of   Indian 
<br /><br />society still regard a section of their own countrymen as inferior.  This mental attitude 
<br /><br />is simply unacceptable in the modern age, and it is one of the main causes holding up 
<br /><br />the country's progress.

<br />&quot;Bane hain ahal-e-hawas muddai bhi munsif bhi Kise vakeel karein kisse munsifi chaahen&quot; -- Faiz Ahmed Faiz
<br /><br />.&quot;Custodial violence, including torture and death in 
<br /><br />the   lock-ups,   strikes   a   blow   at   the   rule   of   law,   which 
<br /><br />demands that the powers of the executive should not only 
<br /><br />be   derived   from   law   but   also   that   the   same   should   be 
<br /><br />limited by law. Custodial violence is a matter of concern. 
<br /><br />It   is   aggravated   by   the   fact   that   it   is   committed   by 
<br /><br />persons   who   are   supposed   to   be   the   protectors   of   the 
<br /><br />citizens. It is committed under the shield of uniform and 
<br /><br />authority in the four walls of a police station or lock-up, 
<br /><br />the   victim   being   totally   helpless.   The   protection   of   an 
<br /><br />individual from torture and abuse by the police and other 
<br /><br />law-enforcing   officers   is   a   matter   of   deep   concern   in   a 
<br /><br />free society.
<br /><br />In   spite   of   the   constitutional   and   statutory 
<br /><br />provisions aimed at safeguarding the personal liberty and 
<br /><br />life of a citizen, growing incidence of torture and deaths 
<br /><br />in police custody has been a disturbing factor. Experience 
<br /><br />shows   that   worst   violations   of   human   rights   take   place 
<br /><br />during the course of investigation, when the police with a 
<br /><br />.
<br />                                                                                              1
<br /><br />view   to   secure   evidence   or   confession   often   resorts   to 
<br /><br />third-degree   methods   including   torture   and   adopts 
<br /><br />techniques of screening arrest by either not recording the 
<br /><br />arrest or describing the deprivation of liberty merely as a 
<br /><br />prolonged   interrogation.   A   reading   of   the   morning 
<br /><br />newspapers   almost   everyday   carrying   reports   of 
<br /><br />dehumanising torture, assault, rape and death in custody 
<br /><br />of   police   or   other   governmental   agencies   is   indeed 
<br /><br />depressing. The increasing incidence of torture and death 
<br /><br />in custody has assumed such alarming proportions that it 
<br /><br />is   affecting   the   credibility   of   the   rule   of   law   and   the 
<br /><br />administration   of   criminal   justice   system.   The 
<br /><br />community   rightly   feels   perturbed.   Society's   cry   for 
<br /><br />justice becomes louder.
<br /><br />Custodial death is perhaps one of the worst crimes 
<br /><br />in   a   civilized   society   governed   by   the   rule   of   law.   The 
<br /><br />rights   inherent   in   Articles   21   and   22(1)   of   the 
<br /><br />Constitution   require   to   be   jealously   and   scrupulously 
<br /><br />protected. We cannot wish away the problem. Any form 
<br /><br />of   torture   or   cruel,   inhuman   or   degrading   treatment 
<br /><br />would   fall   within   the   inhibition   of   Article   21   of   the 
<br /><br />Constitution,   whether   it   occurs   during   investigation, 
<br /><br />interrogation   or   otherwise.   If   the   functionaries   of   the 
<br /><br />Government   become   law-breakers,   it   is   bound   to   breed 
<br /><br />contempt for  law and would encourage lawlessness  and 
<br /><br />every man would have the tendency to become law unto 
<br /><br />himself thereby leading to anarchism. No civilized nation 
<br /><br />can   permit   that   to   happen.   Does   a   citizen  shed   off  his 
<br /><br />fundamental right to life, the moment a policeman arrests 
<br /><br />him? Can the right to life of a citizen be put in abeyance 
<br /><br />on   his   arrest?   These   questions   touch   the   spinal   cord   of 
<br /><br />human rights' jurisprudence. The answer, indeed, has to 
<br /><br />be an emphatic `No'.&quot;..............

<br /><br />is   a   form   of   declaration   by   the   donor   and   not   an
<br /><br />instrument of gift as contemplated under Section 17 of the Registration
<br /><br />Act. If all the three essential requisites are satisfied by the gift deed
<br /><br />,   the   gift   in   favour   of   donee  became
<br /><br />complete and irrevocable.
<br /><br />According   to   the 
<br /><br />Mohammedan   Law,   there   can   be   a   valid   gift,   if   three 
<br /><br />essentials  of the gift are satisfied.  (1) a declaration of the 
<br /><br />gift by the donor, (2) the acceptance of the gift express or 
<br /><br />implied   by   or   on   behalf   of   the   donee   and   (3)   delivery   of 
<br /><br />possession of the subject of gift by the donor to the donee. 
<br /><br />If  these   conditions  are  complied  with  the   gift  is  complete. 
<br /><br />According   to   Muslim   law   it   is   not   necessary   that   there 
<br /><br />should be a deed of gift in order to make it a valid gift, but 
<br /><br />of course, if there is a deed it should be registered. But if 
<br /><br />the   deed   is   merely   a   memoranda   of   an   already   effected 
<br /><br />gift,   then   it   stands   on   a   separate   footing.

<br /><br />major enemies of the human beings.  However, its grip is 
<br /><br />not   loosened   in   spite   of   the   realization   of   the   evil 
<br /><br />effects   of   alcohol   on   the   human   life.     On   the   other 
<br /><br />hand,   the   unholy   grip   is   being   tightened   day   by   day. 
<br /><br />Therefore, when the standard and healthy alcohol in the 
<br /><br />form  of liquor  is not  available or  is too  costly for  a 
<br /><br />common   man,   the   poor   section   of   the   society   goes   for 
<br /><br />illicitly   distilled   liquor   which   is   sold   by   the 
<br /><br />bootleggers.  The conscienceless bootleggers - thanks to 
<br /><br />their   avarice   for   money   -   take   full   advantage   of   this 
<br /><br />human weakness and without any compunction or qualms of 
<br /><br />conscience,  distill illicit  liquor and  then to  increase 
<br /><br />the   sale   and   to   gain   astronomical   profits   make   their 
<br /><br />product   more   potent   at   least   in   taste   so   as   to   attract 
<br /><br />the   poor   customers.     Such   poor   customers   invariably 
<br /><br />become   the   prey   of   such   unholy   avarice   on   the   part   of 
<br /><br />the bootleggers and in the process even lose their lives 
<br /><br />at   times   or   suffer   such   injuries   which   are   irreparable 
<br /><br />like total blindness etc. and that is precisely what has 
<br /><br />happened in this case.

<br /><br />Aataa hai abhi dekhiye kya kya mere aage&quot;
<br /><br />--  Mirza Ghalib
<br /><br />`honour' killings have become commonplace in many parts of the 
<br /><br />country,   particularly   in   Haryana,   western   U.P.,   and   Rajasthan. 
<br /><br />Often young couples who fall in love have to seek shelter in the 
<br /><br />police lines or protection homes, to avoid the wrath of kangaroo 
<br /><br />courts.  We have held in Lata Singh's case (supra) that there is 
<br /><br />nothing `honourable' in `honour' killings, and they are nothing but 
<br /><br />barbaric   and   brutal   murders   by   bigoted,   persons   with   feudal 
<br /><br />minds.
<br /><br />In   our   opinion   honour   killings,   for   whatever   reason,   come 
<br /><br />within   the   category   of   rarest   of   rare   cases   deserving   death 
<br /><br />punishment.     It   is   time   to   stamp   out   these   barbaric,   feudal 
<br /><br />practices which are a slur on our nation.    This is necessary as a 
<br /><br />deterrent for such outrageous, uncivilized behaviour.  All persons 
<br /><br />who are planning to perpetrate `honour' killings should know that 
<br /><br />the gallows await them.  ---BY APEX COURT OF INDIA

<br /><br />Martha Graham with Bertram Ross (1961)
<br />Born	May 11, 1894
<br />Allegheny City, Pennsylvania, United States
<br />Died	April 1, 1991 (aged 96)
<br />New York City, USA
<br />Nationality	American
<br />Field	Dance and choreography
<br />Movement	Modern dance
<br />Awards	Kennedy Center Honors (1979)
<br />Presidential Medal of Freedom (1976)
<br />National Medal of Arts (1985)
<br />Martha Graham (May 11, 1894 – April 1, 1991) was an American dancer &amp; choreographer of modern dance, whose influence on dance has been compared with the influence Stravinsky had on music, Picasso had on the visual arts, or Frank Lloyd Wright had on architecture.[1]
<br />Graham invented a new language of movement, and used it to reveal the passion, the rage and the ecstasy common to human experience. She danced and choreographed for over seventy years, and during that time she was the first dancer ever to perform at The White House, travel abroad as a cultural ambassador, and receive the highest civilian award of the USA: the Presidential Medal of Freedom.
<br />In her lifetime she received honors ranging from the Key to the City of Paris to Japan's Imperial Order of the Precious Crown. She said, &quot;I have spent all my life with dance and being a dancer. It's permitting life to use you in a very intense way. Sometimes it is not pleasant. Sometimes it is fearful. But nevertheless it is inevitable.&quot; <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/hug.gif" alt=":)" /> FROM WIKIPEDIA

		<document id="464e457ecb4a7f9e259eb779afca8358" url=""><![CDATA[ABOUT LAWLESSNESS<br/><br/>our  ancient   thinkers   were  of  the   view   that   the   worst   state   of 
<br /><br />affairs possible  in society is a state of lawlessness.   When the rule of law 
<br /><br />collapses it is replaced by Matsyanyaya, which means the law of the jungle. 
<br /><br />In Sanskrit the word `Matsya' means fish, and Matsyanyaya means a state of 
<br /><br />affairs where the big fish devours the smaller one.  All our ancient thinkers 
<br /><br />have   condemned   Matsyanyaya   vide   `History   of   Dharmashastra'   by   P.V. 
<br /><br />Kane   Vol.   III   p.   21.     A   glimpse   of   the   situation   which   will   prevail   if 
<br /><br />matsyanyaya comes into existence is provided by Mark Antony's speech in 
<br /><br />Shakespeare's `Julius Caesar' .  
<br /><br />This idea of matsyanyaya (the maxim of the larger fish devouring the 
<br /><br />smaller ones or the strong despoiling the weak) is frequently dwelt upon by 
<br /><br />Kautilya,   the Mahabharata and other works.   It can be traced back to the 
<br /><br />Shatapatha Brahmana XI 1.6.24 where it is said &quot;whenever there is drought, 
<br /><br />then the stronger seizes upon the weaker, for the waters are the law,&quot; which 
<br /><br />means   that   when   there   is   no   rain   the   reign   of   law   comes   to   an   end   and 
<br /><br />matsyanyaya beings to operate.
<br /><br />Kautilya says, `if danda be not employed, it gives rise to the condition 
<br /><br />of   matsyanyaya,   since   in   the   absence   of   a   chastiser   the   strong   devour   the 
<br /><br />weak'.   That in the absence of a king (arajaka) or when there is no fear of 
<br /><br />punishment,   the   condition   of   matsyanyaya   follows   is   declared   by   several 
<br /><br />works such as the Ramayana II, CH. 67, Shantiparva of Mahabharat 15.30 
<br /><br />and   67,16.     Kamandaka   II.     40,   Matsyapurana   225.9,   Manasollasa   II. 
<br /><br />20.1295 etc.
<br /><br />Thus in the Shanti Parva of Mahabharat Vol. 1 it is stated:-
<br /><br />&quot;Raja chen-na bhavellokey prithivyaam dandadharakah
<br /><br />Shuley matsyanivapakshyan durbalaan balvattaraah&quot;
<br /><br />This shloka means that when the King carrying the rod of punishment 
<br /><br />does not protect the earth then the strong persons destroy the weaker ones, 
<br /><br />just   like   in   water   the   big   fish   eat   the   small   fish.     In   the   Shantiparva   of 
<br /><br />Mahabharata Bheesma Pitamah tells Yudhishthir that there is nothing worse 
<br /><br />in the world than lawlessness, for in a state of Matsyayaya, nobody, not even 
<br /><br />the evil doers are safe, because  even the evil doers will sooner or later be 
<br /><br />swallowed up by other evil doers.
<br /><br />We have referred to this because  behind the growing lawlessness  in 
<br /><br />the country this Court can see the looming danger of matsyanyaya.

<br /><br />international law is a phenomenon that has assumed greater 
<br /><br />dimensions  with  the  spread  of  Indian  diasporas  across  the 
<br /><br />globe.  A  large  number  of  our  young  and  enterprising 
<br /><br />countrymen  are  today  looking  for  opportunities  abroad. 
<br /><br />While  intellectual  content  and  technical  skills  of  these 
<br /><br />youngster find them lucrative jobs in distant lands, complete 
<br /><br />assimilation  with  the  culture,  the  ways  of  life  and  the  social 
<br /><br />values  prevalent  in  such  countries  do  not  come  easy.  The 
<br /><br />result  is  that  in  very  many  cases  incompatibility  of 
<br /><br />temperament apart, diversity of backgrounds and inability to 
<br /><br />accept  the  changed  lifestyle  often  lead  to  matrimonial 
<br /><br />discord  that inevitably forces one  or  the other party to seek 
<br /><br />redress  within  the  legal  system  of  the  country  which  they 
<br /><br />have adopted in pursuit of their dreams. Experience has also 
<br /><br />shown  that  in  a  large  number  of  cases  one  of  the  parties 
<br /><br />may  return  to  the  country  of  his  or  her  origin  for  family 
<br /><br />support,  shelter  and  stability.  Unresolved  disputes  in  such 
<br /><br />situations  lead  to  legal  proceedings  in  the  country  of  origin 
<br /><br />as well as in the adoptive country.

<br /><br />only the people physically but also influences them mentally. 
<br /><br />It   creates   opinions,   broadcasts   different   points   of   view, 
<br /><br />brings to the fore wrongs and lapses of the Government and all 
<br /><br />other governing bodies and is an important tool in restraining 
<br /><br />corruption   and   other   ill-effects   of   society.     The   media 
<br /><br />ensures   that   the   individual   actively   participates   in   the 
<br /><br />decision-making   process.     The   right   to   information   is 
<br /><br />fundamental in encouraging the individual to be a part of the 
<br /><br />governing process.   The enactment of the Right to Information 
<br /><br />Act is the most empowering step in this direction.   The role 
<br /><br />of   people   in   a   democracy   and   that   of   active   debate   is 
<br /><br />essential for the functioning of a vibrant democracy. 
<br /><br />7.      With   this   immense   power,   comes   the   burden   of 
<br /><br />responsibility.  With the huge amount of information that they 
<br /><br />process, it is the responsibility of the media to ensure that 
<br /><br />they   are   not   providing   the   public   with   information   that   is 
<br /><br />factually wrong, biased or simply unverified information.  The 
<br /><br />right to freedom of speech is enshrined in Article 19(1)(a) of 
<br /><br />3
<br /><br />the   Constitution.     However,   this   right   is   restricted   by 
<br /><br />Article 19(2) in the interest of the sovereignty and integrity 
<br /><br />of   India,   security   of   the   State,   public   order,   decency   and 
<br /><br />morality and also Contempt of Courts Act and defamation. 
<br /><br />8.      The  unbridled power  of the  media can  become dangerous 
<br /><br />if check and balance is not inherent in it.   The role of the 
<br /><br />media is to provide to the readers and the public in general 
<br /><br />with   information   and   views   tested   and   found   as   true   and 
<br /><br />correct.     This   power   must   be   carefully   regulated   and   must 
<br /><br />reconcile with a person's fundamental right to privacy.   Any 
<br /><br />wrong or biased information that is put forth can potentially 
<br /><br />damage the otherwise clean and good reputation of the person 
<br /><br />or   institution   against   whom   something   adverse   is   reported. 
<br /><br />Pre-judging   the   issues   and   rushing   to   conclusions   must   be 
<br /><br />avoided.
<br /><br />9.      This is exactly what has happened in the present case. 
<br /><br />The   then   Chief   Justice   of   the   Allahabad   High   Court   who   has 
<br /><br />otherwise   proved   himself   to   be   a   competent   and   good   Judge 
<br /><br />wherever he was posted during his career was brought under a 
<br /><br />cloud   by   the   reporting   which   is   the   subject   matter   of   this 
<br /><br />petition.  His image was sought to be tarnished by a newspaper 
<br /><br />report which was apparently based on surmises and conjectures 
<br /><br />and not based on facts and figures.  The dignity of the courts 
<br /><br />4
<br /><br />and the people's faith in administration must not be tarnished 
<br /><br />because of biased and unverified reporting.  In order to avoid 
<br /><br />such biased reporting, one must be careful to verify the facts 
<br /><br />and   do   some   research   on   the   subject   being   reported   before   a 
<br /><br />publication is brought out. 
<br /><br />10.     We   are   glad   that   the   persons   against   whom   contempt 
<br /><br />proceedings were initiated for a wrong and incorrect reporting 
<br /><br />about   the   then   Chief   Justice   as   aforesaid   have   understood 
<br /><br />their   mistake   and   have   expressed   their   repentance   through 
<br /><br />their   advocate   and   also   themselves   by   filing   an   unqualified 
<br /><br />apology before us for the wrong done.
