Next we want to show and tell you about a few very excellent habits that will do your IM experience good. Developing positive habits for your <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.squidoo.com%2Ftop-rated-gps-navigation-systems-2009"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.squidoo.com/top-rated-gps-navigation-systems-2009</a> related online enterprise can assist you to grow it.<br /><br />If you're into Internet marketing then you have to be good at building new and strong relationships. If you want to do joint ventures, then you will need to cultivate some kind of possibly short term but real relationship with another business owner. The one thing that is different concerns email marketing because you have to do certain things to build that great relationship that you will not need to do in other situations. The best business relationships are those in which all parties receive something positive out of it. We think a lot of this is common sense, and sincere intentions are always the best type of foundation.<br /><br />If you are not the curious type, then think about it and try to do something about it - it will help you. When you think about doing business on the net, then it is not hard at all to see where this fits in. Take a look at simply keeping up with new developments with IM, that certainly requires a good bit of curiosity to find out. Just look at your business and how you promote it, and you will see a lot of areas in which your attention would be beneficial. All you do means you have a fresh chance to learn something new each day, and that is one of the keys to success. Also, being curious about things will naturally compel you to pay more attention and do a more quality job. As an example, if the content that you simply want to generate is about <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.squidoo.com%2Ftop-rated-laptop-computers-2009-2010"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.squidoo.com/top-rated-laptop-computers-2009-2010</a> then that's where your writing skills will probably be useful.<br /><br />How do you feel when you do something you consider to be a failure? Are there concrete steps you can take to achieve this mindset? We all have our unique methods of coping with frustrations and setbacks, but the most important with this is to accept that it will happen no matter what you do. There are so many ways of looking at this, and we will just tell you to stay positive and keep moving ahead. Changing how you respond to failure or setbacks will take time, so just resolve to working on it every day.<br /><br />Think of forming effective habits as a form of investment for your online business. We think today is the most perfect day for you to begin. Go ahead and commence applying these habits to your <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.squidoo.com%2Ftop-rated-digital-slr-cameras-2009-2010"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.squidoo.com/top-rated-digital-slr-cameras-2009-2010</a> related online company and see the alter for your self.<br /><br />Additional Links:<br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.journalhome.com%2Fkeithytcarr%2F158601%2Fhow-to-get-your-site-approved-by-google-for-adsense.htmlhttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.blogabond.com%2FCommentView.aspx%3FCommentID%3D249843http%3A%2F%2Fwww.democratandchronicle.com%2Fapps%2Fpbcs.dll%2Fsection%3Fcategory%3DPluckPersona%26amp%3BU%3D8f5e7763e8444d92af0840b1eadd71dd%26amp%3BplckPersonaPage%3DBlogViewPost%26amp%3BplckUserId%3D8f5e7763e8444d92af0840b1eadd71dd%26amp%3BplckPostId%3DBlog%253a8f5e7763e8444d92af0840b1eadd71ddPost%253aa64b0bf4-908e-4a34-bf89-7d446ff45795%26amp%3BplckBlogItemsPerPage%3D5"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.journalhome.com/keithytcarr/158601/how-to-get-your-site-approved-by-google-for-adsense.htmlhttp://www.blogabond.com/CommentView.aspx?CommentID=249843http://www.democratandchronicle.com/apps/pbcs.dll/section?category=PluckPersona&amp;U=8f5e7763e8444d92af0840b1eadd71dd&amp;plckPersonaPage=BlogViewPost&amp;plckUserId=8f5e7763e8444d92af0840b1eadd71dd&amp;plckPostId=Blog%3a8f5e7763e8444d92af0840b1eadd71ddPost%3aa64b0bf4-908e-4a34-bf89-7d446ff45795&amp;plckBlogItemsPerPage=5</a>

Constructing positive habits for your <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.squidoo.com%2Ftop-rated-gps-navigation-systems-2009"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.squidoo.com/top-rated-gps-navigation-systems-2009</a> related on the web business can assist you to grow it.<br /><br />What are your networking skills like? If you are lacking or afraid to do it, then that implies some habits that should be addressed. There are many Internet marketers that go through slow progress because they don't want to go out there and network with the right people. So this is just a matter of seeing where these opportunities exist for you, and then you methodically begin to work on them. If you have the time, then we suggest you begin looking for ways to network such as even in a good marketing forum. Have you ever attended one of the very many IM seminars that are held every year? The more you work with others in growing your online business, the easier will be your route to success. Perhaps this is a positive habit you can work on developing in your own online business.<br /><br />Have you ever made serious business goals but failed to reach them? If so, do you know why you did not reach your goals? You can learn to relax a bit more with your internet business once you have your goals in place and things are working toward seeing them through. You will be more in control of the situation and will be able to guide your online business in the right direction without really worrying about the consequences. Be sure to break-up your primary goal because that will just help to make it more manageable. There are many people that don't really like the idea of setting goals, but unless and until you try it, you won't know what you're missing. Just like any other success habit, they work like gangbusters, and you must begin immediately. For example, if the content which you need to develop is about <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.squidoo.com%2Ftop-rated-laptop-computers-2009-2010"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.squidoo.com/top-rated-laptop-computers-2009-2010</a> then that's where your writing abilities will likely be beneficial.<br /><br />As you probably can imagine, since this is the net we are talking about, the use of various areas of technology are heavily used. If you want to grow and expand your online marketing business then you will have to effectively follow and use technology. How you handle technology in your business is something you have to wrestle with since it is your business. If you want to succeed and move ahead of the others then speed of execution is important, an idea without execution is useless, and technology helps you get the results as fast as possible.<br /><br />Perhaps one of the best habits you can develop as it impacts your online business is to have focus and not be scattered. Go ahead and begin applying these habits to your <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.squidoo.com%2Ftop-rated-digital-slr-cameras-2009-2010"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.squidoo.com/top-rated-digital-slr-cameras-2009-2010</a> related online organization and see the change for your self.<br /><br />Additional Links:<br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.democratandchronicle.com%2Fapps%2Fpbcs.dll%2Fsection%3Fcategory%3DPluckPersona%26amp%3BU%3D8f5e7763e8444d92af0840b1eadd71dd%26amp%3BplckPersonaPage%3DBlogViewPost%26amp%3BplckUserId%3D8f5e7763e8444d92af0840b1eadd71dd%26amp%3BplckPostId%3DBlog%253a8f5e7763e8444d92af0840b1eadd71ddPost%253adc631bca-a866-43a5-bd7a-b5bcf33ff3d4%26amp%3BplckBlogItemsPerPage%3D5http%3A%2F%2Fwww.journalhome.com%2Fkeithytcarr%2F158601%2Fhow-to-get-your-site-approved-by-google-for-adsense.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.democratandchronicle.com/apps/pbcs.dll/section?category=PluckPersona&amp;U=8f5e7763e8444d92af0840b1eadd71dd&amp;plckPersonaPage=BlogViewPost&amp;plckUserId=8f5e7763e8444d92af0840b1eadd71dd&amp;plckPostId=Blog%3a8f5e7763e8444d92af0840b1eadd71ddPost%3adc631bca-a866-43a5-bd7a-b5bcf33ff3d4&amp;plckBlogItemsPerPage=5http://www.journalhome.com/keithytcarr/158601/how-to-get-your-site-approved-by-google-for-adsense.html</a>

There are some SEO basics as well as unique factors to consider due to the nature of a lens, and we will try to cover both in the article. Regardless of whether your Squidoo lens is about <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.squidoo.com%2Ftop-rated-gps-navigation-systems-2009"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.squidoo.com/top-rated-gps-navigation-systems-2009</a> or any other topic, you should recognize that by finding it ranked within the search engines you may obtain more targeted traffic.<br /><br />Unless you have been under a rock or in a cave the past several months, then you are well aware of how Google feels concerning site content, etc. The &quot;thing&quot; about videos still exists, and they can and often do rank very highly when optimized correctly. This one is very easy, put excellent video content embedded on your Squidoo lens, and make it good so people watch the whole thing. There will be nothing but good things that will come of this if you do good backlinking, etc. Another point is making and using a video that belongs to you on a lens will look better to &quot;them.&quot; There is great value when your lens does not look like everybody else's because people will tend to stay longer and read.<br /><br />Let's face it, if you're creating a Squidoo lens then you want it to get noticed and receive the right amount of exposure. Do you know how easy or hard it will be to get your long-tail phrase to the top of page one? If you do not know that, then you have to determine that, first. This is really just a bit of common sense, plus it has been the standard approach to this process since the beginning, almost. You do want to avoid the really broad search phrase as that will pretty be impossible to do anything with. How well your content and the topics you write about perform or are accepted by your audience matters very much. You can really help to define how specific you want to get by the keyword phrase you are optimizing for with your lens. So if you would like to make it large with your <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.squidoo.com%2Ftop-rated-laptop-computers-2009-2010"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.squidoo.com/top-rated-laptop-computers-2009-2010</a> Squidoo Lens then it is actually crucial that you simply focus on acquiring issues proper with the Search engine optimization.<br /><br />The search engine algorithm has changed over time, and today it's more focused on synonyms than anything else in order to serve relevant results. It has become increasingly more difficult to do SEO primarily because Google really does not want you to do that. Optimizing your site is still not hard to do, and in some ways things have not changed so much. Search engine algorithms are pretty good at reading a page and figuring out what it is about. The best approach really is to just write naturally about your subject. Never to extremes with SEO and especially optimizing your content.<br /><br />As we have said, backlinking is a must as is optimizing your content for your keywords. So go ahead and apply these guidelines to your <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.squidoo.com%2Ftop-rated-digital-slr-cameras-2009-2010"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.squidoo.com/top-rated-digital-slr-cameras-2009-2010</a> lens to obtain probably the most out of it Seo wise.<br /><br />Additional Resources:<br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fsquidobestdslr.wikidot.com%2Fstraightforward-talk-about-squidoo-lens-seo-and-high-rankinghttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.blogigo.com%2FSquidobestdslr%2FGetting-Your-Squidoo-Lens-Ranked-Google-and-Bing%2F1%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://squidobestdslr.wikidot.com/straightforward-talk-about-squidoo-lens-seo-and-high-rankinghttp://www.blogigo.com/Squidobestdslr/Getting-Your-Squidoo-Lens-Ranked-Google-and-Bing/1/</a>

Hey, we all do this - you too, and me, and so it is just the way people are. Hence out call to you to include product or service benefits. Once your benefits start working on them, then that is when their resistance starts to get weaker.

This notion of taking action is not something we invented, but it is a business fact of life. No matter whether you want to take action on growing your <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.squidoo.com%2Ftop-rated-gps-navigation-systems-2009"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.squidoo.com/top-rated-gps-navigation-systems-2009</a> company or one thing else, you should focus on taking timely action.<br /><br />There is something real about energy and flow because once things get interrupted it can be a struggle to get back into things. What is also important is finding a sweet spot with your goals because you can sabotage your efforts by making them too great or so small they almost do not matter. So as you probably know, what you decide to shoot for has to feel right for you, and that is the most important thing here. Remember we all need direction, a sense of purpose and the desire to achieve it, and from those three elements all else will follow. By simply exercising your thoughts to be focused on what's coming up and the positive aspects of your goal, you will be inclined to take more action and you'll actually end up enjoying the whole process.<br /><br />Suffering from poor focus can be the result of lack of knowledge and being unsure of what to do, and that will contribute to poor or insufficient action. People tend to avoid those things that are uncomfortable and make them feel bad or annoyed, and it is the rare person who can work through that and resolve all those little problems. What you have to do is choose one task and work on that until it is done and have the discipline to shut everything else out. We all are faced with taking care of many tasks each day; learn to prioritize your tasks and do one task at a time. For instance, if you want to enhance the sales for your <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.squidoo.com%2Ftop-rated-laptop-computers-2009-2010"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.squidoo.com/top-rated-laptop-computers-2009-2010</a> Net Enterprise then ensure you happen to be taking enormous action.<br /><br />Most people do not take the time to think about what they are habitually thinking or doing, and that is one thing you need to do most - think about your self. If you are only working part-time on your business, what are you doing with your time besides working your job and maybe taking care of children, etc? However, even after doing all that, you still need to arrange your schedule so you are operating at maximum efficiency. You can use a simple spreadsheet to make your time tracking easy, which in turn makes it simple for you to take strong action in the direction of your goal.<br /><br />The ability to create movement toward what you want can snowball and create incredible results if you give it a chance. So what are you waiting for? Go ahead and start taking action on your <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.squidoo.com%2Ftop-rated-digital-slr-cameras-2009-2010"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.squidoo.com/top-rated-digital-slr-cameras-2009-2010</a> enterprise to get essentially the most out of it.<br /><br />Additional Resources:<br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.soulcast.com%2Fpost%2Fshow%2F1131573%2FInternet-Marketing-Success---Learn-What-It-Takes-to-Take-Actionhttp%3A%2F%2Fonlinbusandtricks.wikia.com%2Findex.php%3Ftitle%3DTaking_Action_-_99%2525_of_Success_is_Simply_Showing_Up_Every_Day%26amp%3Baction%3Dsubmit"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.soulcast.com/post/show/1131573/Internet-Marketing-Success---Learn-What-It-Takes-to-Take-Actionhttp://onlinbusandtricks.wikia.com/index.php?title=Taking_Action_-_99%25_of_Success_is_Simply_Showing_Up_Every_Day&amp;action=submit</a>

If you have little to no experience with a web business, then you have to get used to the idea of taking action very quickly, at times. Whether you need to take action on growing your <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.numbthumb.com%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.numbthumb.com/</a> enterprise or some thing else, you ought to focus on taking timely action.<br /><br />Any person who has built a real business needs to know what to do, where to go, what to work toward and the like; if you are missing those components then that could be the problem. So if action is an issue, then try sitting down and writing out the major points that must be accomplished in your business. Any time you have questions about what to do, then go to Google and find the answers. Seriously, make a plan if you have never done this, and the difference between you and those with experience is they already know what needs to be done with each business. But when you organize yourself and create a strong system of work, you'll see that the majority of the actions that you take are pre-determined, which means there is less of thinking and more of doing.<br /><br />One of the most powerful forces that exists today is decision making - if you're able to make any decision, you'll move yourself to take action. What stops you from taking any action is your inability to make a decision when you really need to. Getting used to the feeling of something is often the key to making it a behavior, and that applies to anything from decision making to action taking. So bear in mind that you should never worry about whether or not you made the right decision, just make it and keep on rolling. Remember, it is the moment of decision that you really move towards your goals and take massive action. For example, in the event you want to boost the sales for your <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.numbthumb.com%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.numbthumb.com/</a> Net Enterprise then be sure you happen to be taking enormous action.<br /><br />Self-awareness is an important aspect when you're trying to take consistent action towards your goal. We do realize that some people are extremely busy with family and their regular jobs, though, and you just have to do what you can do on your business. However, even after doing all that, you still need to arrange your schedule so you are operating at maximum efficiency. You can use a simple spreadsheet to make your time tracking easy, which in turn makes it simple for you to take strong action in the direction of your goal.<br /><br />This pervasive issue of taking action is one that plagues thousands if not millions of people, but there are effective solutions available. So what are you currently waiting for? Go ahead and start taking action on your <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.numbthumb.com%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.numbthumb.com/</a> organization to obtain essentially the most out of it.<br /><br />Additional Resources:<br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fblogbud.com%2Fcgi-bin%2Findex.pl%3Fpoemnumber%3D477994%26amp%3Bsitename%3Dkeithcarr%26amp%3Bpassword%3D310331GdOtQqCefyo59938.3103%26amp%3Bpoemoffset%3D0%26amp%3Bdisplaypoem%3Dt%26amp%3Bitem%3Dbloghttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.democratandchronicle.com%2Fapps%2Fpbcs.dll%2Fsection%3Fcategory%3DPluckPersona%26amp%3BU%3D8f5e7763e8444d92af0840b1eadd71dd%26amp%3BplckPersonaPage%3DBlogViewPost%26amp%3BplckUserId%3D8f5e7763e8444d92af0840b1eadd71dd%26amp%3BplckPostId%3DBlog%253a8f5e7763e8444d92af0840b1eadd71ddPost%253afdcb367a-0d20-4758-9973-7247fa9ea9be%26amp%3BplckBlogItemsPerPage%3D5"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://blogbud.com/cgi-bin/index.pl?poemnumber=477994&amp;sitename=keithcarr&amp;password=310331GdOtQqCefyo59938.3103&amp;poemoffset=0&amp;displaypoem=t&amp;item=bloghttp://www.democratandchronicle.com/apps/pbcs.dll/section?category=PluckPersona&amp;U=8f5e7763e8444d92af0840b1eadd71dd&amp;plckPersonaPage=BlogViewPost&amp;plckUserId=8f5e7763e8444d92af0840b1eadd71dd&amp;plckPostId=Blog%3a8f5e7763e8444d92af0840b1eadd71ddPost%3afdcb367a-0d20-4758-9973-7247fa9ea9be&amp;plckBlogItemsPerPage=5</a>

What is so amazing about social media is you do not need to have a large operating budget or tons of experience. The rest of this article is devoted to all those who wish to incorporate social media but just need a little direction. No matter whether you would like to promote your <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.squidoo.com%2Ftop-rated-gps-navigation-systems-2009"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.squidoo.com/top-rated-gps-navigation-systems-2009</a> related product or any other product, you will soon realize how social media marketing and advertising can aid.<br /><br />Your audience may not always be able to tell you want they want or need, but one thing is they will know when they see it. We know you do not want to miss out on all that potential, and that is why we are here today writing this for you. Creating a successful social media marketing campaign can't happen just like that as you need to read your customers and prospects so that you can give them what they want. Analyzing market research is not high energy physics, but you must do this important step that, honestly, we think most small online businesses fail to do. Once you start engaging your target audience, then you should always have open ears because they will talk to you. Get in the habit of asking your audience what they think and feel about something, and hopefully you will get enough of a response from them.<br /><br />All copy of any kind requires you to make the most of the words you choose. We frequently recommend that people study other ads that are running and learn from them. Remember that if you are running ads, then you must test them against each other, and long ad copy that does not get to the point will always lose. Even the best of the campaigns may fail if you don't focus on writing good copy, because ultimately your aim here is to get results from each of your campaigns. For instance, if you're in the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.squidoo.com%2Ftop-rated-laptop-computers-2009-2010"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.squidoo.com/top-rated-laptop-computers-2009-2010</a> market place, you'll want to be sure you are constructing an successful relationship with it.<br /><br />How you go about capturing the attention of your market will depend on the nature of your marketing and advertising. Be different from the rest and take your campaign seriously; innovation doesn't always mean that you should make things complicated. Usually the simplest approach to something is the most effective because not all solutions need to be overly complicated. You will find that a fine line has to be walked between something containing a creative idea and something that turns people off from you.<br /><br />Remember that social media marketing is not a silver bullet, and lots of people have walked away from places like Facebook feeling pretty dejected, so just remember you need to have everything in one sock. So what are you currently waiting for? Attempt and apply the tips that we discussed to boost your social media advertising and marketing campaign targeted towards <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.squidoo.com%2Ftop-rated-digital-slr-cameras-2009-2010"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.squidoo.com/top-rated-digital-slr-cameras-2009-2010</a>.<br /><br />Related Resources:<br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fblogbud.com%2Fcgi-bin%2Findex.pl%3Fpoemnumber%3D479961%26amp%3Bsitename%3Dkeithcarr%26amp%3Bpassword%3D310331GdOtQqCefyo59939.3103%26amp%3Bpoemoffset%3D0%26amp%3Bdisplaypoem%3Dt%26amp%3Bitem%3Dbloghttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.blogabond.com%2FCommentView.aspx%3FCommentID%3D277302"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://blogbud.com/cgi-bin/index.pl?poemnumber=479961&amp;sitename=keithcarr&amp;password=310331GdOtQqCefyo59939.3103&amp;poemoffset=0&amp;displaypoem=t&amp;item=bloghttp://www.blogabond.com/CommentView.aspx?CommentID=277302</a>

Whether or not you need to drive targeted traffic to your <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.squidoo.com%2Ftop-rated-gps-navigation-systems-2009"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.squidoo.com/top-rated-gps-navigation-systems-2009</a> website or any other website, it is important that you simply focus on the correct way of write-up marketing.<br /><br />Quality Comes First: If you are going to create and post garbage online, then that's exactly the type of traffic you will generate. While quantity is important, it should never affect the quality. If you want your campaign to stand out from the crowd, the only way to do that is to make sure your audience receives excellent value and quality. Due to the high quantity of articles online that are nothing more than fluff and have no relevance whatsoever, search engines like Google have been changing their algorithms to remove this type of content from their pages. Article marketing can provide excellent results in the long term if done properly so you will only benefit by taking the time to write quality articles. So never underestimate the importance of quality when creating articles for your campaign.<br /><br />Focus on the Title: If you want to run a successful article marketing campaign, you should know the value of writing good titles with great titles. The title of each of your articles plays a major role in making your overall campaign a success because if you fail to get people to read your articles, then everything else is going to fail. It doesn't matter what niche you are in, because half the battle is one if people are interested enough to click through and read your articles. You need to offer your readers strong motivation to read your articles and that won't happen if you have weak titles. If you want to create a winning title every time, then you need to follow this fail-proof formula: be direct, include your keywords and make people curious. As an example, if you are write-up advertising and marketing to drive to site visitors to your <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.squidoo.com%2Ftop-rated-laptop-computers-2009-2010"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.squidoo.com/top-rated-laptop-computers-2009-2010</a> website then you ought to make an effort to get your audience curious with your articles.<br /><br />Regular Reports: It is imperative that you keep a record of what it going on because otherwise you won't know what changes are required to ensure everything keeps moving steadily forward. Your progress completely depends on how well you understand your own potential and try to raise the bar higher. It's easy to create a regular report for something like this, which will provide you with a clear view of how far forward you have moved and will help you see your mistakes. To get an even stronger record of your progress, you can start with weekly and monthly reports after you master the daily ones.<br /><br />You need to use your words to create warm articles that easily connect to your readers. When you're doing article advertising for your <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.squidoo.com%2Ftop-rated-digital-slr-cameras-2009-2010"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.squidoo.com/top-rated-digital-slr-cameras-2009-2010</a> company, make an effort to make your articles as welcoming as achievable.<br /><br />Related Resources:<br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fblogbud.com%2Fcgi-bin%2Findex.pl%3Fpoemnumber%3D488199%26amp%3Bsitename%3Dkeithcarr%26amp%3Bpassword%3D310331GdOtQqCefyo59935.3103%26amp%3Bpoemoffset%3D0%26amp%3Bdisplaypoem%3Dt%26amp%3Bitem%3Dbloghttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.blogabond.com%2FCommentView.aspx%3FCommentID%3D289144"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://blogbud.com/cgi-bin/index.pl?poemnumber=488199&amp;sitename=keithcarr&amp;password=310331GdOtQqCefyo59935.3103&amp;poemoffset=0&amp;displaypoem=t&amp;item=bloghttp://www.blogabond.com/CommentView.aspx?CommentID=289144</a>

They fail because they have a hard time building a good enough foundation first and instead decide to put a bunch of work into other, less important things. Keep reading to learn how to boost the speed of your article writing. Regardless of whether you're writing articles about <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.squidoo.com%2Ftop-rated-gps-navigation-systems-2009"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.squidoo.com/top-rated-gps-navigation-systems-2009</a> or any other subject, you may discover that by improving the speed of your post writing, you will have the ability to accomplish more.<br /><br />Use an Editor Program: Time saving is an important aspect to focus on when trying to boost the speed of your article writing, and you need to be smart in your approach if you want to save a lot of your time. Editor programs help save time because they fix your spelling and check for other errors while you do the writing. It takes more time to look for, find and correct these mistakes if you do the tasks separately and a good editor program will make it all easier for you. However, this doesn't mean that you can skip the proof reading part that comes after you complete your article because it still happens to be important. A typical editing program isn't going to catch every single error, you need to hunt them down yourselves. Then again, using an editor program can still cut down quite a lot on the time you spend working on each article.<br /><br />Be Knowledgeable: Keeping track of the happenings around the world will allow you go gather new ideas that you can add to your articles easily, plus allow you to pick up the pace in how fast you write. Keep an eye on what the people are talking about, and what your target audience wants to read. If you want to develop high quality articles in a short time-frame, than this makes it easy for you to not have to think too much about what it is you are writing about. Stay on top of things and pay careful attention to the types of questions people are asking, because as time progresses people are faced with new things to worry about every day. Speedily writing an article can be all about placing your beliefs, trepidations, thoughts and ideas into your own words, and this will take little time if you go about it the right way. As an example, if you are writing an write-up about <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.squidoo.com%2Ftop-rated-laptop-computers-2009-2010"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.squidoo.com/top-rated-laptop-computers-2009-2010</a>, then you'll be able to write it quicker in the event you follow this technique.<br /><br />Enthusiasm is Important: To increase the flow of ideas for your writing topics, you need to allow yourself to get worked up and feel enthusiastic about your work. Being excited and happy about your topic makes it so much easier to actually put words down on your page. In other words, you could fly through your writing session without realizing it if you are excited about the topic that you want to cover.<br /><br />Try to remember that it is okay to walk away from your article if you aren't excited about it; you can always go back to it later on when you feel more excited about things. Momentum is important, focus on keeping it built up, even if you need to take a break to get back on track. Once you begin applying these guidelines, you will recognize that developing <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.squidoo.com%2Ftop-rated-digital-slr-cameras-2009-2010"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.squidoo.com/top-rated-digital-slr-cameras-2009-2010</a> articles speedily will assist you to boost productivity.<br /><br />Additional Articles:<br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.democratandchronicle.com%2Fapps%2Fpbcs.dll%2Fsection%3Fcategory%3DPluckPersona%26amp%3BU%3D8f5e7763e8444d92af0840b1eadd71dd%26amp%3BplckPersonaPage%3DBlogViewPost%26amp%3BplckUserId%3D8f5e7763e8444d92af0840b1eadd71dd%26amp%3BplckPostId%3DBlog%253a8f5e7763e8444d92af0840b1eadd71ddPost%253af05d7e96-caea-4d2e-b9d5-089824ec72d2%26amp%3BplckBlogItemsPerPage%3D5"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.democratandchronicle.com/apps/pbcs.dll/section?category=PluckPersona&amp;U=8f5e7763e8444d92af0840b1eadd71dd&amp;plckPersonaPage=BlogViewPost&amp;plckUserId=8f5e7763e8444d92af0840b1eadd71dd&amp;plckPostId=Blog%3a8f5e7763e8444d92af0840b1eadd71ddPost%3af05d7e96-caea-4d2e-b9d5-089824ec72d2&amp;plckBlogItemsPerPage=5</a>

Twitter affords all of its registered users the ability to communicate via direct messages and a DM autoresponder for contacting those who are new at following you. The autoresponder message is underused in our opinion, and maybe that is one reason so many businesses have difficulty achieving their goals at Twitter.No matter whether you want to use Twitter to promote <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.squidoo.com%2Ftop-rated-gps-navigation-systems-2009"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.squidoo.com/top-rated-gps-navigation-systems-2009</a> related goods or something else, you will discover that by intelligently utilizing the Twitter DM autoresponder you'll be able to get much more out of your efforts.<br /><br />One thing that counts in all markets anywhere around the world is real value. If your end user has nothing to derive from the message that you're sending out to him, how do you expect him/her to take any real action? There's just no point in sending out a message to your new followers if you don't have anything meaningful to say. So if you're still not aware of the value you can deliver to your target audience, then figure that out first before utilizing the autoresponder for your Twitter account. Give your followers something real, even if it's just perceived value, it does matter in the long run.<br /><br />When you do write anything that is promotional in nature, stick to the facts and do not try to be heavy on the emotional trigger words. If you are relatively new at Twitter, then just lurk a while and note how people talk to each other. If you know how to write pre-sell copy, then that is what you want to do because there is never any pressure. Don't be too demanding trying to force the recipient to click on your link and do what you want them to do. Imagine how you feel when people market to you at Twitter, and that will give you a small glimpse into the minds of your audience. Persuasion is the key to success when it comes to effective copywriting, but when you're working with the Twitter autoresponders, you need to know when to draw the line.By way of example, let's say you're targeting the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.squidoo.com%2Ftop-rated-laptop-computers-2009-2010"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.squidoo.com/top-rated-laptop-computers-2009-2010</a> niche, you will discover that by using the Twitter DM Autoresponder in a better way you'll get much better results.<br /><br />The email alerts is valuable to you but only if your followers elect to use that feature. So the danger here is that you could send out a message two times. Do what you can to prevent these little mishaps, but most people are understanding about user mistakes.<br /><br />You can obviously use the Twitter DM autoresponders for a better purpose and leverage them to achieve high response to your offers. Also, do not forget the points about the absolute need for offering solid value at all times. So if you want to find good results in advertising your <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.squidoo.com%2Ftop-rated-digital-slr-cameras-2009-2010"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.squidoo.com/top-rated-digital-slr-cameras-2009-2010</a> related product to your Twitter followers, the above guidelines will prove to be immensely helpful.<br /><br />Additional Links:<br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.blogabond.com%2FCommentView.aspx%3FCommentID%3D310198http%3A%2F%2Fblogbud.com%2Fcgi-bin%2Findex.pl%3Fpoemnumber%3D505426%26amp%3Bsitename%3Dkeithcarr%26amp%3Bpassword%3D310331GdOtQqCefyo11719.3103%26amp%3Bpoemoffset%3D0%26amp%3Bdisplaypoem%3Dt%26amp%3Bitem%3Dblog"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.blogabond.com/CommentView.aspx?CommentID=310198http://blogbud.com/cgi-bin/index.pl?poemnumber=505426&amp;sitename=keithcarr&amp;password=310331GdOtQqCefyo11719.3103&amp;poemoffset=0&amp;displaypoem=t&amp;item=blog</a>

We know that on the surface it may not seem like much, but there is a lot you have to think about so you avoid hiring the wrong person. The reason this is so important is because it is your business,  and you naturally want to get the job done and move forward. In order to maximize your efforts, take some time to learn first and that will be a good investment. We offer three really solid tips for preparing for and hiring the content writer you will be happy with in your project.  Whether you would like to hire a content writer for your <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.squidoo.com%2Ftop-rated-gps-navigation-systems-2009"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.squidoo.com/top-rated-gps-navigation-systems-2009</a> web site or any other website, it is essential that you simply invest in the correct talent.<br /><br />As you can quickly imagine, it is much better to deal with a writer who is professional about their work rather than the opposite. You can frequently tell a lot about how a person talks and behaves because those attitudes usually extend to other  areas such as their work ethics. Some businesses owners will simply communicate with a few emails, but  if possible you should call them on Skype or whatever and talk to them. The human voice can tell you a lot, and so it is very much recommended you do this.<br /><br />Anymore you do have to be careful about who you hire because there are many writers for whom English is not their first language, but they  will tell you that it is. The quality of the article will be greatly affected if the writer isn't proficient in the language he's writing in. If your particular market is highly educated, then your writing fees will be a bit higher than what is normally expected. If you are happy with what your new writer supplies to you, then that is all that matters. By way of example, if you're hiring a content writer to function on your <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.squidoo.com%2Ftop-rated-laptop-computers-2009-2010"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.squidoo.com/top-rated-laptop-computers-2009-2010</a>  website then you should strive to put within the effort to discuss even the smallest  elements.<br /><br />One thing that is very common is looking into some kind of  reasonable discount if you think the order will merit. You will discover writers are open to a discount, but the  individual pieces cannot be significantly different in terms of research otherwise it will not be worth it to them. Never try to rip-off your writers, and from their point of view it is like a writer giving you plagiarized content - not a good thing. Perhaps the best thing to do is figure out your budget  and what you want to pay a writer, and then go from there.<br /><br />If you ever need to outsource to a content writer, then keep these points in mind and remember there is more to this story. You can get the facts before you start hiring, or you can learn the  hard way - always up to you.  So go ahead and put these suggestions into action to make certain which you discover the best content write for your <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.squidoo.com%2Ftop-rated-digital-slr-cameras-2009-2010"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.squidoo.com/top-rated-digital-slr-cameras-2009-2010</a> business.<br /><br />Related Articles:

You should try to insert the call to action in various effective forms across your website in prominent places so that you're constantly reminding your prospects to take action. You want to make it very easy for your visitors to take action, so don't make them look for the &quot;buy&quot; button or have to figure out what they have to do to order or opt in. The call to action is an important factor that can influence your conversion rates, so make sure it's easy to understand and repeated several times.<br /><br />The Top of the Page is Crucial: You should put the most compelling part of your message where people will look first -at the top. This is why you need to have the important points and your prime selling advantages right on the top of the page so that your prospects continue to read further. This part of your page is usually what determines whether a visitor will stay on your page or click away. You can't rely on vague or generic content at the top of your page -you want to address the most interesting and exciting points about your product or offer so they can't resist reading further. You should never underestimate the importance of such small but vital points. As an example, if you're running a internet site about <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.squidoo.com%2Ftop-rated-laptop-computers-2009-2010"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.squidoo.com/top-rated-laptop-computers-2009-2010</a>, then you must focus on growing your conversions at all times.<br /><br />Use an internal linking structure to make it easy for your visitors to browse around and go from one page to another. Make sure that the search engine that you are using on your website is also good so that no one has a problem finding what they want. You will find that your conversion ration increases automatically once you have navigation that is simple to use. <br /><br />Making your site more conversion friendly is a matter of finding every possible area where a change is in order, such as the factors we've looked at here. The most popular websites are those that do whatever is necessary to appeal to their visitors' needs and preferences, so this is what you should aim for as well. You shouldn't hesitate to do everything you can that might improve your conversions, as even minor changes can add up to have a major effect on your results. Not everything will work, of course, but the point is that some things will, and that's how you start to make progress. So what are you currently waiting for?

Actually, the only way you will know if the biggest benefit is the way to go is by doing a simple A/B split test arrangement. In addition, the headline lets people know what the copy is all about, and that serves to weed out anyone not interested or not targeted properly. One of the very best investments of your time would be developing headline writing skills, but it does take some learning and doing but well worth it.<br /><br />Most people do not combine video and text, so if you go with text then you will have to ensure a few things are done right.

Using lengthy lines will make it confusing for your prospects who are going through your copy and this might actually prove to be a turn off. So that is the challenge of copywriting, keeping everything very concise and to the point. Your conversions will be much higher when you follow the guidelines we have just given you.

We all know the value of testimonials, so use them at your discretion and see how they work for you. This is actually an area that you just have to be careful about so you do not shoot your self in the foot. So only go with those that use very specific information that support what the person is saying. If you use too many testimonials, then that could come across the wrong way, so use them sparingly.<br /><br />These are just a couple of important items you need to think about for your landing page. If you want to improve the conversions of your page then you need to take such a targeted approach. So what are you waiting for?

Have you attempted to produce your first copy in the best way possible? If yes, then this article will be very helpful to you. Whether or not you need to use copywriting to sell a <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.squidoo.com%2Ftop-rated-gps-navigation-systems-2009"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.squidoo.com/top-rated-gps-navigation-systems-2009</a> related product or any other item, becoming an effective copywriter will take you a lengthy way.<br /><br />It's All About Your Prospect: A copy that talks about you and only you is not going to make it. Your prospect has to be the center of attention most of the time. Being self-centered in your approach will not persuade people to purchase your product. People mainly want to know what your product will do to improve their situation. Your approach, therefore, has to be tailored to your audience so they understand how your product will benefit them. You can't afford to get diverted from this issue, or people will lose interest. People don't actually make purchases rationally, but emotionally. They're not looking to buy just another product, but something that will make their life better. They want results, not a list of your accomplishments. If you can clearly communicate the benefits to them, they'll hit the &quot;buy&quot; button without any hesitation. It's fine to introduce yourself to your prospects, but always keep the focus on them.<br /><br />Don't Make Things Complicated: You should avoid assuming that people know a lot about your subject; explain things as clearly as possible. People don't like to make purchases until they have all the necessary information, which is why it's a good idea to treat your audience as though they were all newbies. While some of your prospects will be more knowledgeable than others, it's always better to explain too much than too little. Prospects are much more likely to take action when they've been presented with lots of relevant information, as this makes them feel more certain about the product. Take them through the whole process by the hand, and you'll put their minds at ease. As an example, if your copy is about <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.squidoo.com%2Ftop-rated-laptop-computers-2009-2010"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.squidoo.com/top-rated-laptop-computers-2009-2010</a> then you ought to see to it which you give your prospect the highest priority by means of it.<br /><br />The Final Sentence is Essential: Just like the first sentence, your last sentence is also important. When you end your copy, ensure that your prospect is happy about your offer. Push him into taking action. This is where you have to be very convincing. This is so that you will have more opportunities to convince your prospect to take action. Many times, you will see that people cannot be persuaded until the very last second. They make a buying decision only when they feel like it's right. So when you make the last sentence important, you help your prospect to make up their mind to buy.<br /><br />Stay away from using any type of jargon in your copy because that will actually confuse your prospect. When a person is not in the right frame of mind, they will not want to make a decision to purchase product. So you should always aim at giving more and more clarity to your prospects. In short, regardless of what niche you're targeting, regardless of whether it is the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.squidoo.com%2Ftop-rated-digital-slr-cameras-2009-2010"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.squidoo.com/top-rated-digital-slr-cameras-2009-2010</a> niche or any other niche, efficient copywriting will help you in many techniques.<br /><br />Additional Links:

But you know there must be a right and wrong way to go about doing this. Just about any person can benefit from this approach, but for long term results it is best to make it a part of your overall strategy. So we will share several excellent strategies that you can begin to use right away. Regardless of whether you need to guest weblog concerning the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.squidoo.com%2Ftop-rated-gps-navigation-systems-2009"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.squidoo.com/top-rated-gps-navigation-systems-2009</a>  topic or any other subject, it is critical that you simply focus on high quality.<br /><br />It only makes good sense that you want your content to be read by those who would naturally be in your audience. All you need to do is a Google blog search for your niche keywords to locate good candidates. So when you begin using this method, you have to remember that lots of people will be reading it and assessing you. Therefore, making a concerted effort to find those blogs in your market is one of your first orders of business. People from markets that are not yours will probably not want to read anything you write if it is not related to them. It doesn't matter what niche you seek to target, as long as it's something you like and can be consistent with, there's no reason why you shouldn't succeed with guest blogging.<br /><br />You always want to make a great impression, and so do not spoil it by being a time vamp by sending a lot of emails to them. Most if not all the blogs we have seen that actively solicit guest posts will have a dedicated page talking about what they want, what they are looking for and what you need to do. One thing is for sure, if you become a pain or hassle to deal with, then the blog owner will probably just start ignoring you. Most of the blogs that accept guest posts have information posted on their blog, so instead of emailing them with questions and discussing stuff, send them your article with the first email itself. Only the best you can produce is what you want to use as a guest post, and that will further your chances of getting traffic. For example, if you're creating a guest post about <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.squidoo.com%2Ftop-rated-laptop-computers-2009-2010"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.squidoo.com/top-rated-laptop-computers-2009-2010</a>  then you ought to attempt to be specialist in every way.<br /><br />You will also find that very popular blogs will only want people who are already established, and that makes a certain amount of sense, too. Don't write your posts like you're writing for some trade journal; be yourself and try to keep the content as original as possible, so that you're able to get noticed, and published by the big bloggers. Create a very compelling headline and make the post as killer as you can muster. Do impeccable research and get some information that most people will never discover on their own only because they are too lazy.<br /><br />What we discussed in the above article is only the tip of the iceberg -there's a lot more you'll learn as you move ahead as a guest blogger. Go ahead and apply these guidelines to locate success with <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.squidoo.com%2Ftop-rated-digital-slr-cameras-2009-2010"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.squidoo.com/top-rated-digital-slr-cameras-2009-2010</a>  guest blogging.<br /><br />Additional Links:<br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.blogster.com%2Fdinohoruffman%2Fa-few-simple-guidelines-for-guest-blogging"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.blogster.com/dinohoruffman/a-few-simple-guidelines-for-guest-blogging</a> <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fblogingsystems.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F9588623833%2Fhow-to-become-a-successful-guest-blogger"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://blogingsystems.tumblr.com/post/9588623833/how-to-become-a-successful-guest-blogger</a>

Playing it safe will not bring the results you desire. You need to be willing to take the extra step needed to be able to keep the flow of subscribers to your newsletter consistent and to make things happen. Simple easy to apply tips are given in the article below that will help you to boost your newsletter subscriber numbers... Regardless of whether you might be running a newsletter about <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.squidoo.com%2Ftop-rated-gps-navigation-systems-2009"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.squidoo.com/top-rated-gps-navigation-systems-2009</a>  or some other subject, it is genuinely critical that you simply concentrate on quality.<br /><br />Start with a Landing Page: Getting the targeted audience to learn what you offer and and to take action is a basic step to increasing your newsletter subscriber numbers. While it's good to have a subscription box on your website, you should also consider using a landing page to drive targeted traffic to. The landing page is where you can put your subscription box and a small sales letter with bullet points that describes the benefits of subscribing to your newsletter. The visitors to your landing page will have a clear understanding of what they will receive if they subscribe to your newsletter and how to go about it. A landing page is very necessary, especially when you're driving traffic through paid sources such as pay per click ads. Keep your landing page simple and easy to use so it doesn't confuse your prospects.<br /><br />Publish Guest Posts on Related Blogs: No matter what niche you're in, there are certainly going to be other blogs that are devoted to the same subject. Find such relevant blogs and see if they accept guest posts; by writing a guest post for a good blog within your niche, you'll be able to get yourself in front of your target audience easily. Link to your landing page from the article that you submit to the blog, so that people that are interested in learning more about your newsletter can click the link and check it out. In order for this technique to work, your articles have to be compelling, both to entice other bloggers to publish them and to convince readers to click through to find out what your site is all about. Guest bloggers can often leverage their posts to gain lots of useful publicity and traffic, and also become known as experts on their topic. By way of example, if you're targeting the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.squidoo.com%2Ftop-rated-laptop-computers-2009-2010"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.squidoo.com/top-rated-laptop-computers-2009-2010</a>  niche, you can guest weblog in it.<br /><br />Give Them an Incentive to Subscribe: You can invite visitors to become newsletter subscribers, but this isn't enough to motivate everyone. In order to get people to take the action you want, you may have to offer them a bribe. To get the maximum effect from this, though, you have to put an original spin on it, as the &quot;free gift&quot; technique is familiar to many people by now. So try to come up with an incentive that's worth something to your potential subscribers to get their attention. Target your bribe to your audience -so for a newsletter about investing, you might want to give away a truly informative video that has tips on investing in stocks or forex. Nothing is better than an original and well targeted bribe if you want to give people a compelling reason to subscribe.<br /><br />The main objective when you are writing a newsletter is to constantly expand your reader population. It does not matter what kind of niche you are targeting, whether it is <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.squidoo.com%2Ftop-rated-digital-slr-cameras-2009-2010"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.squidoo.com/top-rated-digital-slr-cameras-2009-2010</a>  or any other niche, it's crucial which you function on rowing your subscriber base.<br /><br />Related Links:<br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fdinohoruffman.livejournal.com%2F877.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://dinohoruffman.livejournal.com/877.html</a> <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.squidoo.com%2Fnewsleterandcameras"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.squidoo.com/newsleterandcameras</a> <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fdinohoruffman.insanejournal.com%2F412.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://dinohoruffman.insanejournal.com/412.html</a>
