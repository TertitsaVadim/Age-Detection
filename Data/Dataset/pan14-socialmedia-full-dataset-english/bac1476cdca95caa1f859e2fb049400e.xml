Hint: it’s the exact opposite of boring cardio, but with no cardio at all…<br /><br />My 1 &quot;weird&quot; old trick of a flatter belly, and how this trimmed our stomachs much faster than boring and painful ‘abs’ exercises…<br /><br />How this tasty little dish we ate late at night actually boosted one of the most powerful fat loss hormones in our bodies while we slept the night away…<br /><br />How we accessed this old motivation trick for a leaner, healthier body so powerful, it’s been passed down for decades &amp; used by some of the hottest celebrities still today…<br /><br />1. Fad Diets That Work? Forget It!… You WON’T lose weight fast and keep it off by just eating low carb diets, low fat diets, or low calorie diets. The truth is, fast weight loss that lasts comes down to a diet that works, but that is right for you. You’re going to discover an easy way you can &quot;trick&quot; your body into burning more calories by eating more of these delicious and healthy fat burning foods that fight your cravings… 2. Cardio Doesn’t Work Like This… Those long and frequent cardio or aerobic workouts from quick weight loss programs are among the WORST WAYS to burn fat. You’re going to see how to boost your fat loss and fitness results by exercising in almost the complete OPPOSITE manner with these tips for just 45 minutes a WEEK…with no separate cardio at all! 3. You Probably Won’t Lose Any Real Belly Fat With Sit-ups &amp; Ab Gizmos… 1000?s of crunches, sit ups, or those crappy infomercial abs gizmos WILL NOT allow you to lose belly fat or give you a flatter stomach and certainly not six pack abs. You’re going to learn how to lose stomach fat 5 times faster with these full body exercises that don’t actually target your abs at all…<br /><br />4. Late Night Eating Can Actually Help Burn Fat &amp; Fight Cravings… Going to bed hungry is actually one of the WORST THINGS YOU CAN DO. You’re going to discover you can boost fat loss in your body by eating the right type of tasty little dish an hour or so before you go to sleep… 5. The ‘Fat Burning Zone’ Is A BIG Mistake… The &quot;fat burning zone&quot; you see on most cardio machines is actually the LAST THING you want to follow to burn the most body fat. You’re going to burn fat and calories for up to 3 days like we do with this VERY DIFFERENT rapid and simple workout that takes an average of just 15 minutes… 6. ‘Toning’ Your Muscles Doesn’t Work… Trying to &quot;tone&quot; your body by using light weights or high repetitions is a BIG WASTE OF TIME. But now you’re going to see how to start cutting stubborn pounds… all while sculpting a leaner and sexier body that will burn your stored body fat for energy with this 1 overlooked technique… <br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvZXhlcmNpc2UtZml0bmVzcy8_" target="_blank">weight loss exercise</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvcmVtZWRpZXMv" target="_blank">diet definition</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvbnV0cml0aW9uLw__" target="_blank">diet definition</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvbWVudGFsLWhlYWx0aC8_" target="_blank">slimming world</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvc2xlZXAtYW5kLWRyZWFtcy8_" target="_blank">lose weight fast</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvbWVucy1oZWFsdGgv" target="_blank">diets that work</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvYWRkaWN0aW9uLw__" target="_blank">diet definition</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvYmVhdXR5Lw__" target="_blank">weight loss exercise</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvZGVudGFsLWhlYWx0aC8_" target="_blank">balanced diet</a>

But he lost close to 40 pounds in just one month and was now doing work outs at the gym to maintain his new body weight.<br /><br />He was a fitness enthusiast and he explained to me why I wasn’t seeing results. The reason was actually very simple — all of the the programs I was following were never meant to work!<br /><br />Diet plan fail they DO NOT tackle the root problem and instead of losing weight, one or more of the following happens to you:<br /><br />You experience Muscle Loss: The rapid weight loss of most diets is attributed to muscle loss. And that is counterproductive as you need muscles to burn body fat!<br /><br />You experience Water Retention Loss: Most diets produce fascinating short-term results as you lose water from your body instead of fat. (It’s not sustainable and could land you in hospital)…<br /><br />You undergo Intolerable Starvation: Some diets advocate drastically reducing how much you eat (It’s almost impossible to maintain and torturous to endure)…<br /><br />You overwork your body with an Extreme Exercise Regime: Some programs recommend that you exercise a lot, to the point where it becomes harmful to you and your body.<br /><br />For most weight loss companies and products, I dare say (And I’ve experienced first-hand) that their program is definitely NOT SUITABLE for us to lose weight… Now, what’s the reason? Well, simple! If every single client were to successfully lose weight, they’ll be out of business…<br /><br />So Darren, the guy I met at the gym, told me about the HCG diet plan, a new method of losing weight that have worked exceptionally well for some of his friends and it obviously did for him too… Although I had my doubts, I decided to give it a shot. Since I’ve tried out so many diet programs already, I figured I had nothing to lose… At first, I thought I couldn’t last one week of the HCG diet plan, but it turned out, not only did I successfully completed the whole program, I didn’t feel it was as hard as other diets I’ve experienced… The results too were shocking! In just over one month, I lost almost 60 pounds and it just could only get better…<br /><br />Today, weighing in at only 75kg, I’ve successfully lost a whopping 65kg and living out my life more than ever…<br /><br />The HCG diet plan is designed to fit the lifestyle of the people of the 21st century. Some of the characteristics of the HCG diet plans are:<br /><br />It does NOT require you to exercise at all during the intake period (In fact you’re advised against it)…<br /><br />It is safe and has little or no side-effects (As compared to the many adverse reactions from other weight-loss supplements, this is a low risk weight loss method )…<br /><br />It has an accompanying diet plan that will boost your weight loss efforts quickly! It focuses mainly on fat-loss only…<br /><br />Now the HCG diet plan has so many benefits and in fact, it is a widely recognized diet program heavily featured in the media.<br /><br />It has totally turned my life around and I want YOU to experience the same kind of change in your life.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvbWVudGFsLWhlYWx0aC8_" target="_blank">balanced diet</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvbWVucy1oZWFsdGgv" target="_blank">diet plans</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvYWRkaWN0aW9uLw__" target="_blank">dukan diet</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvZ2VuZXJhbC8_" target="_blank">diet definition</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvZXhlcmNpc2UtZml0bmVzcy8_" target="_blank">diet plans</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvbWVkaXRhdGlvbi8_" target="_blank">diet tips</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvYmVhdXR5Lw__" target="_blank">diet tips</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvbnV0cml0aW9uLw__" target="_blank">diets that work</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvZGVudGFsLWhlYWx0aC8_" target="_blank">atkins diet</a>

The audio files are in MP3 format and the written materials are formatted as adobe acrobat PDFs, which can be viewed on Mac or PC.<br /><br />&quot;Yuri, I’d like to just let you know how you and Eating for Energy have changed my life…&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I live in Melbourne Australia and I don’t expect you to remember but a few months ago I wrote to you out my ear and hearing problem which I have been suffering from for the past 8 months and all of winter here in Australia. Well, I bought you e-book “Eating for Energy” after much hesitation, read it from cover to cover (I was glued to it and still am) so I’d like to share with you the difference it made to my life.<br /><br />Needless to say, the medical profession has let me down greatly. After extensive examinations, MRI and CT scans, visits to ENT specialists and even a Neurologist. I was told nothing can be done about my condition and I would have to be fitted with a hearing aide and just live with the fact that my hearing loss would not get better and put up with the tinnitus for the rest of my life.<br /><br />Well, I may be getting old (I’m 55 now in a few months I will be 56) and I don’t feel this old and I’m certainly not ready to be fitted with a hearing aide yet. To cut along story short I decided to take matters into my own hands.<br /><br />I started your raw food diet plan, went on a detox for 4 weeks, and added certain vitamins and minerals to my daily dietary intake and WOW! The results are amazing, see for your self (attached are photos).<br /><br />Exactly one year ago, in October, my husband and I went to Japan for 3 week holiday and I weighed 172 pounds, the second pictures is of me earlier this month on a trip with my girlfriends in Sydney.<br /><br />I have lost 22 lbs, have more energy now then I ever did in my life before, and I feel happier and healthier then on my 50th birthday almost six years ago.<br /><br />Yuri, I just want to say there is so much information and so many web sites on the internet on health and fitness but you are by far THE BEST!<br /><br />Thanks ever so much for changing my life, but not just mine…because I cannot stop talking about you and your dietary advice to my friends, who see the results and question me how I achieved this in such a sort time. I am proud to direct them to your web site to check it out for them selves without hesitation. I know they will get the right advice and wealth of information.<br /><br />&quot;In a world filled with dubious diet books, Eating for Energy identifies the proven steps that will lead to abundant health, a fit body, and radiant energy.

It produced not only weight loss of close to 60 pounds; my strength increased rather dramatically. &quot;<br /><br />I uncovered research studies that showed how intervals were superior to slow cardio for fat loss, and how heavier resistance training (i.e. 8 reps per set) was far more effective at burning calories than the traditional &quot;high-reps to get cut&quot; approach.<br /><br />Out of the huge stack of research papers that I had analyzed, I accidentally stumbled onto two studies that proved my theories beyond a shadow of a doubt, and completely transformed my thinking about fat loss training. This created the foundation for Turbulence Training and has now changed the course of fat loss training forever.<br /><br />In the second landmark study that helped create the Turbulence Training method, researchers found that performing 8 repetitions per set of an exercise helped women burn more calories after exercise in comparison to using 12 repetitions per exercise.<br /><br />(NOTE): Not only did the results of this study destroy the high-reps, low-weight myth, it also proved that the Turbulence Training principles are as effective in women as they are in men.<br /><br />SCIENCE FACT: The fat-loss programs you read about in muscle mags from the 80?s and 90?s are based on out-of-date exercise science and nutrition information.<br /><br />SCIENCE FACT: Exercise science has advanced by leaps and bounds just in the last two decades. The latest fat loss research, which Turbulence Training is based on, allows you to lose more fat while keeping your hard-earned muscle, and doing so with less time working out than ever before.<br /><br />SCIENCE FACT: Fat loss programs that require you to do endless hours of long, slow, boring cardio workouts will rarely help you achieve your fat loss goals and may lead to over use injuries.<br /><br />SCIENCE FACT: You need to use more advanced, modern training methods, such as Turbulence Training Intervals, to help you burn more calories in and out of the gym. With Turbulence Training cardio, you will skyrocket your post-workout metabolism allowing you to burn almost twice as many calories as you would with traditional cardio workouts.<br /><br />SCIENCE FACT: Traditional fat burning programs typically don’t even mention strength training in their instructions, because most trainers and clients don’t understand how resistance training will help fat loss. Even if your fat loss program does recommend strength training, it’s likely that you’ve been told to use the ineffective and outdated method of high reps and low weight (which does NOT burn fat!).<br /><br />SCIENCE FACT: If you want to maximize your metabolism, and get defined arms, abs, and legs, then you must include strength training in your fat loss workout. High intensity strength training with the Turbulence Training system helps protect your lean muscle mass, which you are almost certain to lose on traditional diet and exercise programs<br /><br />These are the facts. The research simply does not lie. The way you are currently training is probably not only getting you less than satisfactory results, but may actually be causing overuse injuries, or even catabolic muscle loss.<br /><br />Over time, the Turbulence Training philosophy got even better as I refined, tweaked and re-tested it on myself and my clients until it became a complete training and nutrition methodology and series of workout programs that started producing such breathtaking results for my clients that they could hardly believe it. That’s when I put these workouts into a special brand new Internet package that includes…<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvYWRkaWN0aW9uLw__" target="_blank">balanced diet</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvYmVhdXR5Lw__" target="_blank">weight loss diet</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvbWVucy1oZWFsdGgv" target="_blank">unexplained weight loss</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvZGVudGFsLWhlYWx0aC8_" target="_blank">slimming world</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvZ2VuZXJhbC8_" target="_blank">unexplained weight loss</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvZXhlcmNpc2UtZml0bmVzcy8_" target="_blank">diet plans</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvbWVkaXRhdGlvbi8_" target="_blank">atkins diet</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvbWVudGFsLWhlYWx0aC8_" target="_blank">weight loss resources</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvZGlldHMtd2VpZ2h0LWxvc3Mv" target="_blank">diet plans</a>

The content has helped me to live an active and healthy life without it taking my time and energy. Once I got into ESE, I stopped searching for more diets, workout plans etc. I’ve found what I searched for; an easy and healthy lifestyle which I know I can follow the rest of my life. Thank you so much. Yours sincerly, Claus Aschou.<br /><br />&quot;…I’ve never felt as fit and healthy as I do right now…I have no intention of stopping…&quot;<br /><br />Hi Brad, Back in late December, 2008, one of our sales managers thought up the wonderful idea of having our own office &quot;Biggest Loser&quot; competition. The competition ran from January 9-April 9, 2009. I was one of 22 people who chose to participate. The contest was based on a combination of percentage body weight lost and percentage body fat lost. I’m pleased to report that thanks in large part to your program of intermittent fasting and weight training I won the contest! I experienced nearly 8% reduction in body fat. Not only did I win enough cash to buy a set of adjustable dumbbells, a stand, weight bench, and some new clothes, but I’ve also never felt as fit and healthy as I do right now. Moreover, I have no intention of stopping. I’ve experienced a complete paradigm shift in my relationship to food. I know it sounds cliche, but I truly do no longer &quot;live to eat,&quot; but rather &quot;eat to live.&quot; It’s incredibly liberating. And I love people’s reaction when they ask me how I did it and I tell them &quot;intermittent fasting.&quot; They look at me blankly tell them the Eat Stop Eat story. The smart ones are inquisitive about it, and the even smarter ones are giving it a try (one of my co-workers and her sister fasted yesterday and said it went well). All that said, keep up the great work! Sincerely, Louis Ressler<br /><br />Brad, ESE has helped me feel the best I’ve ever felt. I was worried about it at first, but then upon Brad’s advice after an e-mail exchange, I just tried it out. It’s been life changing. It’s helped me feel like I’m free from food and because I don’t have to worry about getting so much food in a certain day helped me get more variety back in my diet. I recommend to just about everyone that they go out and get ESE and try it out. I love ESE! Brian Wittman<br /><br />Hi Brad, Eat Stop Eat is the easiest way to lose weight.

The study, conducted by the Harvard School of Public Health, quizzed over 120,000 nurses and other health workers about their dietary habits over the course of many years. The goal was to discover what impact diet had on weight over time.<br /><br />Here’s the deal: Whether or not you like it the drug industry (and that includes doctors) are in it to make money. And while you’re health is a large priority, the fat cats in the industry and even the doctors themselves hope and prey that you will never discover this information. What’s more, they do everything in their power to make sure information like this never sees the light of day! They’d rather keep selling you and me half-ass solutions that deliver severely lacking results…if any…so that you have no choice but to keep coming back to them. The truth is, there’s a whole world of little known, all-natural remedies out there. Many of which have been proven to cure many of today’s most pressing ailments… You just never hear about them. Why? Because if people knew about these things…the drug industry would lose BILLIONS of dollars. Thousands of doctors would soon be practice-less! It’s a horrible but true fact: it’s just not in the best interest of the doctors to tell you about some alternative natural approach. Especially one that actually works so amazingly well to tackle the root cause of your problem. You see, during my research I made a shocking discovery…<br /><br />‘The Greek Yogurt Diet’ Reveals The Only All-Natural, Proven, 2-Step System That Is 100% Guaranteed To reduce body fat and restore health by repairing your digestion…naturally! If You Can Follow 2 Simple Steps, Then You Can Lose The Weight and Feel Great Permanently!

You will be blown away why this has not gone mainstream yet.<br /><br />My name is Rachelle Gordon, and over the past 10 years, ive been working extensively in hospitals mainly in the Intensive Care Unit and in the out-patient department– two places where you normally see a whole lot of kidney disease sufferers ranging from acute/chronic renal failure, diabetic renal disease, kidney stones to polycystic kidney disease.<br /><br />My experience as a kidney/renal nurse for 10 years has taught me a sure-fire, proven and tested system that is backed by some of the top nephrologists in the country today.<br /><br />In addition, the active medical research that I have been doing for the past 7 years specifically for kidney disease sufferers has led me to deliver this diet method to more kidney disease sufferers.<br /><br />In addition, my private practice as a health consultant for kidney sufferers since early 2003 has given me an avenue to test this system out on clients with various kidney diseases. Hence, you see the unsolicited testimonials on this website.<br /><br />As you will see in a little while, I have been devouring all the information that I can about the ongoing research on kidney diseases. So caught up that I often get a research finding even before they get published in the medical journals.<br /><br />I studied all of this from any angle you would look at it in the academe, I have been exposed to countless kidney disease patients in my extensive years of clinical rotations and being a researcher myself, there is very little that I dont know about kidney diseases.<br /><br />If you belong to the at-risk group of kidney disease sufferers or you already have the symptoms of having a kidney disease, then you owe it to yourself and your family to read on… This will be one of the most important letters you will ever read.<br /><br />Statistics taken from 2007 health survey show millions of Americans have kidney disease in a certain degree of seriousness and dont know it. It was estimated that at the very least, there are 6.5 million Americans have an elevated blood creatinine level. A very likely sign of kidney failure.<br /><br />If you think about it more deeply, you are even luckier than most people because you got an idea you have a kidney disease.<br /><br />Among older American adults with kidney stones, diabetes or hypertension, 1 out of 8 has kidney disease. On the other hand, among the rest of non-institutionalized adults, 1 out of 10 has kidney disease.<br /><br />This figures have been seen in most developed countries including UK, France, Germany and Australia to name a few.<br /><br />1.) Genes – Sad fact be told, if you have a family member having some form of kidney disease, chances are, you have will have it too. And as you may have realized already, it is definitely not your fault.<br /><br />I’m not just saying that either – you really will be able to see huge improvements in just a short space of time if you follow what you’re about to discover.<br /><br />Leading US Nephrologists Strongly Believe… There Is Lack Of Effective Care Among Kidney Disease Patients.<br /><br />Since late 1990?s, a lot of medical journal articles have been springing…<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvYWRkaWN0aW9uLw__" target="_blank">slimming world</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvbWVucy1oZWFsdGgv" target="_blank">diet plans</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvYmVhdXR5Lw__" target="_blank">diet tips</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvbWVudGFsLWhlYWx0aC8_" target="_blank">unexplained weight loss</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvZGVudGFsLWhlYWx0aC8_" target="_blank">weight loss diet</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvc2xlZXAtYW5kLWRyZWFtcy8_" target="_blank">weight loss calculator</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvcmVtZWRpZXMv" target="_blank">diet for weight loss</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvbnV0cml0aW9uLw__" target="_blank">diet plans</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvbWVkaXRhdGlvbi8_" target="_blank">diets to lose weight</a>

They’re baffled why they no longer feel as good as they did when they were a child.<br /><br />In fact, they haven’t got a clue. And that really makes sense when you consider the types of foods they’re eating day-to-day, and the dangerous, often toxic, medications they’ve used throughout life.<br /><br />Of course not. If medication or a magic pill was the real answer, then you’d already feel as good as you want to be.<br /><br />For many years mainstream medicine ignored the role that diet can play in both health and disease. More recently it began emphasizing the need to eat healthier foods to keep illness at bay.<br /><br />One of the most exciting discoveries has been the effect some foods have on the body’s acid-alkaline pH levels when digested.<br /><br />Regardless of how much you work out and try to eat right, if you can’t balance the acids in your body, you’ll never feel as good as you’d like to be.<br /><br />The problem is, on a whole, the average western diet is acid-producing. And when acidic wastes accumulate, they can cause organs to malfunction and break down.<br /><br />This creates a fertile breeding ground for various forms of chronic illness that are now experienced by more than half the population.<br /><br />If you often feel tired, it’s a safe bet that you are overly acidic. The simple fact is, most people are. You need to counter acidity with alkaline foods as soon as possible.<br /><br />Eating the proper foods and getting the best nutrients in balance will help you avoid all that – along with the misery and poor quality of life that so often precede death, sometimes by decades.<br /><br />Enter your name and email in the form provided to discover how a high alkaline diet works and why alkaline foods are highly recommended.<br /><br />We respect your privacy and HATE SPAM as much as you do.

But this pipeline fails in 90% of the cases at one specific spot, the coronary arteries, with the length of only one billionth of the total vascular pipeline&quot;.<br /><br />&quot;Regarding the fear that people have for high cholesterol, results have shown it is totally unfounded because dietary intake of cholesterol doesn’t control cholesterol levels; it’s your body’s metabolism that controls cholesterol levels&quot;.<br /><br />&quot;It is not uncommon for people to have high cholesterol levels despite living on a low fat diet. Dietary fat does contribute to your cholesterol level but the bulk of the circulating cholesterol is generated in the liver. If your body is genetically programmed to make large amounts of cholesterol, diet adjustment is important but may not be enough to lower it to safe levels&quot;.<br /><br />Around 80% of Cholesterol found in the body is manufactured by the liver, so keeping this organ in tip top condition is vital.<br /><br />Yes, there is a way natural health practitioners can see High Cholesterol in patients and you can learn how.<br /><br />All drug therapies have side effects to varying degrees – Cholesterol lowering drugs have some of the biggest lists of side effects.<br /><br />Here are just a few of the drug side effects ranging from the relatively mild gastrointestinal disturbances such as diarrhoea and nausea through to depression, inflammation of the liver and indeed even weakening of the heart muscle!

I very much enjoyed reading it.&quot;<br /><br />This manual will truly empower you to make the right choices by giving you more knowledge about this life threatening condition……..If you have High Cholesterol…..you have options beyond medication!<br /><br />You will learn the top recommendations from health practitioners about foods which you should avoid, which to eat and crucially why!<br /><br />Your liver function is key, and this manual will help you understand the signs of a stressed liver and how to look after it naturally.<br /><br />You are likely to come across Cholesterol products and information from many sources – use Chapter 4 in this manual as a complete reference to what works and what to avoid.<br /><br />Concise information is given for you to maintain a healthy heart – Including important nutrients, stress reduction strategies, diet information, exercise, and beneficial supplements……….in essence this manual contains the most comprehensive advice for your success in Beating Cholesterol<br /><br />1.

Take the conventional route with cholesterol lowering drugs and rely on ‘lady luck’ for your own brand of side effects……will it be the diarrhoea and nausea, depression, or the liver inflammation and weakening of the heart muscle that finally catches up with you?

Nature &amp; Health is widely considered the best Australian natural health magazine.<br /><br />For years I’ve had my own private practice where I treated numerous clients suffering from hypothyroidism. My treatment plan helped them get their health back and lose weight… so they looked better AND felt better as a result!<br /><br />Because of my experience… I can also help you deal with thyroid issues and weight gain… so you can live a healthier and happier life.<br /><br />In fact. I’m actually going to give you the same exact step-by-step plan I give my clients. You can use it to improve your thyroid, literally starting in a very short time.<br /><br />After all, there’s NO doubt you want your thyroid working properly. It determines how healthy, happy, and slender you are.<br /><br />Not only that, but your thyroid gland controls your body’s metabolism. And the hormones your thyroid produces can directly affect your weight.<br /><br />When your thyroid doesn’t get the proper nutrients it needs, it slows down production of these vital hormones, causing your metabolism to slow down.<br /><br />Not only that, but an inactive thyroid condition makes it a lot tougher to lose weight. And it has you feeling tired, exhausted, cranky, and unhappy.<br /><br />But that’s not all. If your thyroid fails to secrete the adequate amount of hormone, you could also find yourself dealing with any or all of these issues:<br /><br />Without a doubt, having thyroid problems can be such a pain and burden in your life and can prevent you from doing all the activities you like to do.<br /><br />The truth is, you don’t have to continue to suffer. I can give you a plan to help support your thyroid so you can start to feel better WHILE you also shed that stubborn weight!<br /><br />And the good news is, I’ve learned some simple nutrition techniques that can help improve your thyroid function so that it becomes healthy again. When you make these simple changes to your daily eating habits, you’ll see and FEEL results a lot faster.<br /><br />It’s true… you can be strict with your diet and you STILL won’t lose weight! That’s because reducing your calorie intake slows your metabolism down. Not only that, but your thyroid slows down as well.<br /><br />And this can actually cause you to GAIN weight. What’s worse… diets make you feel tired, exhausted, and miserable.<br /><br />But if you follow a healthy eating plan that actually BOOSTS your thyroid activity and SKYROCKETS your metabolism… you can finally lose all the weight you want.<br /><br />When you learn how to support your thyroid with a healthy, natural thyroid diet… you’ll SEE and FEEL the results in a very short time!<br /><br />And when you finally break free from those fad diets and you start supporting your thyroid… you’ll finally feel better and lose weight!<br /><br />This e-book is called &quot;The Natural Thyroid Diet: How to Stop Eating the Foods that Damage your Thyroid!&quot; and it’s designed to boost your thyroid using the RIGHT foods and nutrients so you can FINALLY lose weight.<br /><br />When your thyroid doesn’t get the nutrition it needs…it becomes exhausted and makes weight loss slow down. And when your thyroid is working better… you’ll have more energy…<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvbWVucy1oZWFsdGgv" target="_blank">weight loss resources</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvcmVtZWRpZXMv" target="_blank">lose weight fast</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20v" target="_blank">quick diets</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvYmVhdXR5Lw__" target="_blank">balanced diet</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvZ2VuZXJhbC8_" target="_blank">unexplained weight loss</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvZXhlcmNpc2UtZml0bmVzcy8_" target="_blank">fast weight loss</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvbWVkaXRhdGlvbi8_" target="_blank">fast weight loss</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvZGVudGFsLWhlYWx0aC8_" target="_blank">fast weight loss</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvYWRkaWN0aW9uLw__" target="_blank">unexplained weight loss</a>

It was terrifying – I had no idea how to live my life without some diet telling me how much, when and what to eat.<br /><br />Scared as hell, I threw away my scales, burned my diet books and started to experiment. It turned out to be an incredible journey during which time I discovered the secrets that I divulge in The Mind over Fatter Program. It’s a 100% Healthy Weight Loss Plan that challenges almost everything you know about weight loss.<br /><br />but now I know there is ONE MORE SECRET INGREDIENT to simple and easily sustainable permanent weight loss and without it, you’re fighting a losing battle.<br /><br />The principles behind this all healthy weight loss plan have been published in many magazines like: Shape, Readers Digest, Glamour, Living and Loving, Fit Pregnancy and many others. And have appeared in many newspaper articles.<br /><br />This healthy weight loss plan has been the subject of workshops for Shape and Fit Pregnancy readers, and delivered at numerous health fairs and psychological conferences.<br /><br />Even the South African Department of Health offered Mind over Fatter training to their team of healthcare professionals.<br /><br />This healthy weight loss plan was chosen as the weight loss partner for Metropolitan Life’s ‘The Good Life’ program and was presented at the Kellogs-sponsored ‘Body Empowerment Workshops.’<br /><br />Dr. Maxwell Maltz, author of the bestseller “Psycho-Cybernetics,” says that the brain needs a goal to focus on. If I tell you NOT to focus on a pink elephant, your brain will naturally focus on what it is supposed to avoid because it can’t focus on a blank! When I started to focus on GAINING HEALTH instead of LOSING WEIGHT, something magical happened. My life started being about healthy things I could do rather than unhealthy things I shouldn’t do.<br /><br />Doesn’t sound like much of a shift, but it was incredible what a difference that tiny change of focus made.<br /><br />Would you rather gain something or lose something? Mind over Fatter will show you how to focus on gaining health so that the natural result is losing weight.<br /><br />For the 20 years I was trapped in diet hell, I’d focused on changing my body – what a waste of energy. When I changed my MIND (which is why I call this healthy weight loss plan, MIND over fatter), my body was able to follow without fuss or bother. What I needed all along wasn’t a body makeover, but rather a MIND makeover. When I made healthy choices because I wanted to, rather than because I had to – I didn’t need willpower. I’d always thought I was the weak-willed failure, instead what I discovered was that I didn’t need diet motivations. This was revolutionary stuff!<br /><br />Think about it, because alcohol has never been my vice, I don’t need to exercise willpower not to over-drink. Wouldn’t you love not to have to exercise willpower not to over-eat? Mind over Fatter will show you how.<br /><br />When I let go of obsessing about my weight, my weight let go of me. But more importantly you’ll gain health, freedom from your fear of that scale and a sense of peacefulness, now that’s worth gold.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvZGlldHMtd2VpZ2h0LWxvc3Mv" target="_blank">balanced diet</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvZXhlcmNpc2UtZml0bmVzcy8_" target="_blank">diets that work</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvZ2VuZXJhbC8_" target="_blank">weight loss exercise</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvbWVkaXRhdGlvbi8_" target="_blank">weight loss resources</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20v" target="_blank">weight loss calculator</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvZGVudGFsLWhlYWx0aC8_" target="_blank">lose weight fast</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvYmVhdXR5Lw__" target="_blank">diet definition</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvc2xlZXAtYW5kLWRyZWFtcy8_" target="_blank">diet definition</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvYWRkaWN0aW9uLw__" target="_blank">atkins diet</a>

This is unlike anything you’ve seen before. Because of hundreds to thousands of hours in the trenches researching, testing and tweaking various exercise programs and diets, you will discover<br /><br />Hi there…I’m Jared…and I want to tell you a story. I promise this is like nothing you have heard before. It’s about how I discovered 3 underground and little known fat burning switches that when turned on, ignite your body’s fat burning capabilities 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.Now if you’re anything like me, you want a set of flat, firm, and cut abs, you want to lose your stubborn love handles and you want to do it fast…<br /><br />These 3 methods have been used by people all over the world from the U.S., to AU, To UK, Canada, India and even more…<br /><br />They have nothing to do with fad diets, crazy supplement scams, confusing or complicated exercise programs, funny looking ab machines, or gyrating exercise videos.And the reason why I want to share this with you is because I know the pain, anger and frustration that you probably have gone through with your weight…And how you don’t need to be a slave anymore to what all of those so called gurus and health magazines say you must do to lose weight…<br /><br />Now I wasn’t typically what you would say as fat…the doctor did say I was overweight according to my body mass index, but still I wasn’t comfortable with taking my shirt off…which we all know is the true test of having an awesome body that you’re proud of…I had gone on traditional fat loss diets in the past before vacations, but never really achieved that ripped look I was after. I would lose weight (mostly water) and then gain it all back again.<br /><br />The typical diet and exercises for love handles routine that I would follow was probably what you’ve heard before…old outdated advice from way back in the stone age day such as…do your cardio for an hour a day…cut your calories, and don’t eat carbs…and god forbid if you go off the deep end and fall off your program the whole world would come to an end…But don’t worry though cause later on I’m going to show you how to purposely cheat on your diet and still burn fat…<br /><br />So by following the advice above like millions of other people around the world, my results were sub optimal at best. It’s quite sad when you’re waking up everyday frustrated from lack of results, while these supplement mafiosos are counting their stacks of money in their big corporate offices<br /><br />“A parasite is an organism that lives on or in an organism knows as the host from the body of which it obtains nutrients…”The host does not benefit from the association (meaning you) and is often harmed by it…Doesn’t this sound like your love handles now? It seems like no…<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvZGlldHMtd2VpZ2h0LWxvc3Mv" target="_blank">slimming world</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvbWVudGFsLWhlYWx0aC8_" target="_blank">weight loss resources</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvbnV0cml0aW9uLw__" target="_blank">quick diets</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvZ2VuZXJhbC8_" target="_blank">diet plans</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvYmVhdXR5Lw__" target="_blank">weight loss diet</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvZGVudGFsLWhlYWx0aC8_" target="_blank">fast weight loss</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvbWVkaXRhdGlvbi8_" target="_blank">diets to lose weight</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvZXhlcmNpc2UtZml0bmVzcy8_" target="_blank">weight loss calculator</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvYWRkaWN0aW9uLw__" target="_blank">atkins diet</a>

Until I saw your video and it all clicked! The video alone motivated me to lose weight and the tips helped me out so much that I decided to get your guide. And life has been great ever since!<br /><br />I lost 31 pounds of fat in 12 freaking weeks plus 15 pounds in the months following and I feel amazing! My confidence is increasing slowly but surely and I actually feel excited about going to the mall to shop for clothes! Hopefully ill get myself a girlfriend for the FIRST time in my life…ill keep you updated on that one dude. Cheers Rodney B, Fort Lauderdale, FL”<br /><br />“I love the fact that your book showed me the truth about losing weight and losing fat. Many people, including myself, really don’t know the difference between the two and now, thanks to you I do!<br /><br />I have been on so many diets and tried so many pills, but I always got disappointed and honestly, I was very skeptical about yet another weight loss website when I got to yours. But then again…I tried it all so obviously I was desperate for a solution! The guide literally got me motivated from the get go and it made understanding fat loss so simple. Not 234 pages of technical blabla, just the facts on how to lose fat fast! I kept losing a steady 4 pounds per week and after 10 weeks I lost about 38.6 pounds give or take(I cant give up on my krispy kreme donuts). My belly is way flatter(lost 15 inches) and I know for a fact that I will be comfortable enough to wear a bathing suit to the beach this summer! Heck I’m 5ft9 and 39 years old…I might even do some modeling, at least god blessed me with the height! Thanks a bunch for showing me the real deal on weight loss. Sandra Van Dries, Rancho Cucamonga, CA”<br /><br />“Sir, thank you for giving me my waist back. Being “the fat guy” when hanging with your friends isn’t funny. It actually is quite hurtful and depressing. That’s exactly who I was, just the fat guy at all the parties. I’m still young, I’m only 35 so I feel like I have allot to do on this planet.<br /><br />Being fat really puts a damper on enjoying life while your still young due to the embarrassment you feel when going out in public.<br /><br />At my heaviest I was 221 pounds, and with me being only 5ft9, you can imagine how that didn’t work well with the ladies. I saw your video online one day and I decided to view it till the end and it got me interested, so I purchased and thank lord I didn’t click away your website.<br /><br />When I read the guide I was quite pleased and it motivated me by keeping it all super simple. Thanks for sharing your hard learned experience with losing fat with us.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvcmVtZWRpZXMv" target="_blank">atkins diet</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvbnV0cml0aW9uLw__" target="_blank">balanced diet</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvbWVudGFsLWhlYWx0aC8_" target="_blank">slimming world</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvbWVucy1oZWFsdGgv" target="_blank">quick diets</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvYWRkaWN0aW9uLw__" target="_blank">dukan diet</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvc2xlZXAtYW5kLWRyZWFtcy8_" target="_blank">diets that work</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvYmVhdXR5Lw__" target="_blank">unexplained weight loss</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvZGVudGFsLWhlYWx0aC8_" target="_blank">unexplained weight loss</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvZGlldHMtd2VpZ2h0LWxvc3Mv" target="_blank">diets to lose weight</a>
