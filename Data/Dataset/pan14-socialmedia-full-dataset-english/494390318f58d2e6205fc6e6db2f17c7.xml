But what is the key to innovation? The answer, or at least an important answer, is becoming an observer. By observing how we and other people do things, we will spot opportunities for improvements. The more we observe, the more opportunities we will find. We can then work to provide solutions for some of the problems. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jYXJyZXJhZ2xhc3Nlc3N0b3JlLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> carrera sunglasses </a>By becoming a good observer, we will recognize the problems before many people do and have first-mover advantage. 
<br />Here are some things you can do to innovate through observation:
<br />1. Don’t take things for granted
<br />There are many things which look usual on the surface but have some hidden opportunities behind them. So open your eyes to observe even the seemingly normal things. Observe how you and other people do routines, and discover the details you overlooked.
<br />2. Watch for inconveniences
<br />Inconveniences are clear signs of problems. Are people waiting too long for something? Do they find it difficult to accomplish certain tasks? If you watch for inconveniences, either those experienced by you or by other people, you can easily find opportunities for innovation.
<br />3. Watch for possible gaps
<br />Sometimes we are so accustomed to doing things in a certain way that we can no longer see it as inconvenient. In that case, it is up to your imagination to spot opportunities for improvements. Maybe the current process is already efficient, but you know of some technologies you can use to improve the process even more. The difference between current situation and possible future situation creates a gap for improvement.
<br />4. Follow technology trends
<br />To help you with the previous step, you should closely follow the trends in technology. Familiarize yourself with the latest developments in relevant fields. This way you will expand your horizon of what is possible and make it easier for you to spot possible gaps for improvement.
<br />5. Watch how your competitors work
<br />You can get ideas for innovation not only by observing how people work, but also by observing how your competitors work. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jYXJyZXJhZ2xhc3Nlc3N0b3JlLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.carreraglassesstore.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.carreraglassesstore.com</a></a>Is there something they do well that you can learn from? If yes, then don’t hesitate to take the idea and implement it.
<br />6. Observe different people at different places
<br />To get broader perspective of a problem, you should go to different places and observe how different people do things. By observing people from different backgrounds in different situations, you will see different dimensions of the problem. This way you will come up with better, more complete solutions.

She keeps track of it in a planner that has such small spaces for recording <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jYXJyZXJhZ2xhc3Nlc3N0b3JlLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> carrera sunglasses </a>appointments or tasks that I thought my eyes would fall out of my head from squinting so hard.
<br />So I did what any good big sister interested in productivity would do: I offered to set her up with something a little easier to use. Nothing fancy, of course: I was thinking of introducing her to Remember the Milk. I like RTM for a lot of reasons, although I know a lot of other people have their preferences — the fact that I can use plugins to integrate RTM with both Google Calendar and GMail do a lot for my productivity.
<br /><br />My sister’s response? An immediate no. She relies on paper, not some fancy online gizmo. She proceeded to explain that she only goes online every couple of days, mostly to check her Hotmail email account. It was like an arrow straight into my Web 2.0-loving heart. Somehow, I survived and suggested that maybe a new planner — a bigger one — might be in order. I even offered a trip to the bookstore. I was again shot down, with a whole list of counter-arguments: she’d have to transfer everything over, she’s used to this particular planner and this planner was free, whereas a new one would cost money.
<br />I don’t consider myself some sort of productivity evangelizer; I just think that her system could be improved upon, if only to protect her eyesight. It’s her schoolwork: she’s more than welcome to organize it however she wishes. I managed to keep my advice down to a short suggested reading list and making her promise to consider this whole newfangled internet thing.
<br />I did start thinking, though, about other situations where a person can be forced to adopt a productivity system that just flat out doesn’t work for her, and how to maybe work around it. It’s happened to me before, and I certainly didn’t like it. One of my past employers required us cubicle-dwellers to use a custom system based on Excel spreadsheets accessible across the network to track not only our ongoing tasks but our time cards, accomplishments and a host of other information. I was the employee who constantly forgot to update the spreadsheets and had to be reminded where to check for a given piece of information on a regular basis. It wasn’t a case of my not having the necessary data — I had everything my manager wanted at any given time — but I didn’t translate it into the company’s system very well. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jYXJyZXJhZ2xhc3Nlc3N0b3JlLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.carreraglassesstore.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.carreraglassesstore.com</a></a>We finally managed to slip into an arrangement where I used my own methods to track my work and then filled out my spreadsheets once a week or so.

<br /><br />While Washington policymakers debate how best to stem the obesity epidemic across the nation, many of us are struggling with how to deal with the obesity epidemic in our own homes. A third of all youngsters are now overweight or obese, well on their way to joining the two thirds of adults whose weight also tips the scales at unhealthy levels. Potential solutions are at least as controversial in America's kitchens as<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jYXJyZXJhZ2xhc3Nlc3N0b3JlLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> carrera sunglasses </a> the single-payer plan is on Capitol Hill. Should we ration chips and soda? Or kick the kids outdoors so they get at least a minimum level of physical activity every day? Do we clear the pantry of junk food? Or all of the above?
<br /><br />Now a new study by researchers at the University of Buffalo suggests an even more radical idea: banning fat friends from eating together. Sarah-Jeanne Salvy, an assistant professor of pediatrics at the university's School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, and her colleagues found that fat kids consume significantly more calories when they chow down with friends who are also overweight than when they eat with lean friends.
<br /><br />In the study, published in the August issue of The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, researchers randomly paired 23 overweight and 42 normal-weight children between the ages of 9 and 15 with either a friend or a kid they did not know. There were 33 friend pairs and 39 stranger pairs. Each pair of kids spent 45 minutes in a room that contained puzzles, games, and bowls of both healthy snacks (in this case, baby carrots and grapes) and calorie-rich treats (potato chips and cookies). The kids could eat as much as they wanted, but only from their own bowls. The researchers monitored the youngsters on closed-circuit TV. Afterward they weighed the uneaten snacks to figure out how many calories the kids had consumed.
<br /><br />The results showed that in general, friends who ate together took in more calories than youngsters who were unfamiliar with their partner. That was true for both fat and thin kids. Not surprisingly, overweight kids ate more than lean kids, whether or not they were paired with a friend. And they ate even more when they were paired with another overweight youngster. The greatest number of calories was consumed by two overweight friends eating together in what Salvy describes as a kind of synergistic effect. &quot;Being friends increased food intake, being overweight and eating with an overweight [person] increased eating, and when you combined those, the overweight friends were eating about 700 calories,&quot; Salvy says. (The lean kids consumed several hundred fewer calories.) And, she points out, this is snack food—which means they were consuming a good chunk of their daily calories in that one sitting.
<br /><br />The effect of friends on food intake is an increasingly interesting subject to researchers. In 2007, a highly publicized study in The New England Journal of Medicine found that when a person becomes obese, his or her friends increase their own risk of obesity by 57 percent. The greatest influence was among close friends. If one became obese, another had a 171 percent increased chance of also becoming obese. This epidemiological study, which used data over a 32-year span, made the growth of obesity seem like a virus spreading among social circles—a finding that Salvy thinks is not far off the mark. But, she says, the contagion is spread not by an infecting organism but by a form of social conditioning. As Americans get fatter, our ideas of what is a normal body size can become distorted, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jYXJyZXJhZ2xhc3Nlc3N0b3JlLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.carreraglassesstore.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.carreraglassesstore.com</a></a>she says. &quot;I don't think people see others as being overweight anymore,&quot; she says. &quot;If anything, they see people who are normal weight as being overly skinny.&quot;

Sometimes it’s so loud that I can hear it clearly a few feet away. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jYXJyZXJhZ2xhc3Nlc3N0b3JlLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> carrera sunglasses </a> Maybe it marks me as an old person, but I always wonder how the listener can tolerate having the volume up so loud. Is the music loud because they can’t hear well? Or can they not hear well because the music’s so loud?
<br /><br />It’s not a secret that loud noises can cause hearing loss. Noise-induced hearing loss, or NIHL, can be triggered by a one-time exposure to an extremely loud sound, or by repeated exposure to moderately loud ones. Being in close proximity to a gun shot (170 decibels) or a jet takeoff (140 d<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cool.gif" alt=":)" /> is enough to damage the delicate cells in our ears that turn sound waves into electrical impulses for the brain to process. (For comparison, a whisper is about 30 dB, and a normal conversation is about 60 dB.) Prolonged exposure to loud music at concerts or noise at work is also enough to cause damage, and once these cells are damaged, they never grow back, first affecting higher-frequency sounds, and then gradually working down towards the frequencies of normal speech. 
<br /><br />Hearing loss is a normal part of the aging process, but the increasing rate of hearing loss in children and young people has many health professionals concerned. The National Association of School Nurses reports that about 12.5 percent of kids aged six to nineteen have experienced some degree of hearing loss, and the American Academy of Family Physicians reports that up to a third of college students have high-frequency hearing loss.  
<br /><br />Don’t Stop the Music
<br /><br />It’s easy to blame the now-ubiquitous iPod, but the increase in rates of hearing loss actually goes back far further. People have been listening to personal music players for a few decades, including the Walkman and portable radios, and many people in their 30s and 40s are also suffering from the beginning stages of hearing loss, including ringing and buzzing in the ears, or tinnitus. What’s making things dangerous today are the high volume that the music players project, the length of time people listen to them, and the design of new headphones.
<br /><br />For many people today, listening to music has become an all-day event, as opposed to just an accompaniment to exercise or long family road trips. People listen while commuting, they listen while doing errands, and they listen while at home. Not only are there more occasions to use MP3 players, but battery life on the devices is also much longer than in generations past, so people can easily clock twelve to fifteen hours without a break. We also use headphones and music to drown out ambient noises that surround us—traffic, construction, or other nuisance noises—turning the volume way up to compensate. Modern headphones don’t help the problem, either. Most sets are “in-ear” canalphones, which focus all the sound output directly into the ear canal.
<br /><br />Listening for a long time at a loud volume is the main contributor to NIHL. It’s generally safe to listen to noises up to 75 dB, but anything louder can begin to cause hearing loss. As the volume of the sound increases, the amount of safe listening time decreases, so although it’s safe to listen to 75 dB sounds for hours, it’s only safe to listen to a 90 dB sound for a few minutes. iPods have come under fire for featuring top volumes of up to 115 dB (the equivalent of standing next to a pneumatic drill), which can cause damage in as little as five minutes per day. Teenagers have been found to be particularly at risk, and a study at Children’s Hospital in Boston found that even though many teens kept their device’s volume<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jYXJyZXJhZ2xhc3Nlc3N0b3JlLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.carreraglassesstore.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.carreraglassesstore.com</a></a>at the maximum, they were unaware of just how loud the music was. Many teenagers also trust that all the manufacturer’s default volume settings are safe for their ears.

<br /><br />A study found that the bones of women who drink beer regularly are stronger, making them less likely to suffer from osteoporosis.
<br /><br />It is thought that the high level of silicon in <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jYXJyZXJhZ2xhc3Nlc3N0b3JlLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> carrera sunglasses </a>beer slows down the thinning that leads to fractures and boosts the formation of new bone, the journal Nutrition reports.
<br /><br />Beer is also rich in phytoestrogens, plant versions of oestrogen, which keep bones healthy.
<br /><br />Bones are made up of a mesh of fibres, minerals, blood vessels and marrow, and healthy ones are denser with smaller spaces between the different parts.
<br />The researchers asked almost 1,700 healthy women with an average age of 48 about their drinking habits. They then underwent ultrasound scans of their hands, which showed the bones belonging to beer drinkers to be denser.
<br /><br />The women's hands were chosen because the bones in the fingers are among the first to show signs of osteoporosis, a disease of bone that leads to an increased risk of fracture.
<br /><br />Those who had less than a pint a day, whom scientists classed as light beer drinkers, fared just as well as those in the moderate bracket, suggesting that even small amounts can boost bone health.
<br /><br />The Spanish researchers said: &amp;quot;Silicon plays a major role in bone formation. Beer has been claimed to be one of the most <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jYXJyZXJhZ2xhc3Nlc3N0b3JlLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.carreraglassesstore.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.carreraglassesstore.com</a></a>important sources of silicon in the Western diet.&amp;quot;
<br /><br />Three million Britons are affected by osteoporosis. It is most common in women after menopause.

<br />The ruling by Cumberland County Superior Court Judge Gregory Weeks, the first under the state's controversial Racial Justice Act, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jYXJyZXJhZ2xhc3Nlc3N0b3JlLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> carrera sunglasses </a>means that 38-year-old Marcus Robinson now faces life in prison without the possibility of parole. Robinson, who is black, was convicted of first-degree murder in 1994.
<br />At the center of the judge's ruling is a finding that prosecutors across the state participated in the practice of excluding potential black jurors.
<br />&quot;Robinson introduced a wealth of evidence showing the persistent, pervasive and distorting role of race in jury selection throughout North Carolina,&quot; Weeks wrote in his ruling.
<br />&quot;The evidence, largely unrebutted by the State, requires relief in his case and should serve as a clear signal of the need for reform in capital jury selection proceedings in the future.&quot;
<br />Weeks did not question whether the crime was committed by Robinson, who was convicted of killing a white, 17-year-old teen -- Erik Tornblom.
<br />Passed by the state Legislature and signed into law in 2009, the Racial Justice Act states &quot;no person shall be subject to or given a sentence of death, or shall be executed pursuant to any judgment that was sought or obtained on the basis of race.&quot;
<br />Under the law, those with death sentences can appeal by using statistical analysis to prove race played a role in how their case was handled.
<br />The cornerstone of Robinson's appeal is a Michigan State University study of jury selection in North Carolina in 1994, the time during which Robinson was sentenced, that found prosecutors struck blacks from juries at a rate of more than 2-to-1 compared with whites.
<br />In the ruling, Weeks found that not only did prosecutors across the state intentionally use the race of a potential juror as a significant factor in decisions to exercise preemptory challenges -- the practice of striking somebody from a jury without explanation, but that the practice occurred in Robinson's case.
<br />The North Carolina Conference of District Attorneys strongly disputed that race had anything to do with death sentences in effect across the state.
<br />&quot;While we respectfully disagree with Judge Weeks, we are not surprised by his ruling,&quot; the group said in a written statement.
<br />The group has been opposed to the Racial Justice Act, saying that cases should not be decided by generalized statistics presented years after a conviction.
<br />&quot;Capital cases reflect the most brutal and heinous offenders in our society. Whether the death penalty is an appropriate sentence for murderers should be addressed by our lawmakers in the General Assembly, not masked as claims (of) racism in our courts,&quot; the statement said.
<br />Robinson is among 157 death row inmates -- 83 blacks, 63 whites and 12 other ethnicities -- who filed appeals under the Racial Justice Act, according to records from the North Carolina Department of Public Safety.
<br />The NAACP in North Carolina, meanwhile, expressed their sympathies to the family of Robinson's victim, while lauding the ruling.
<br />&quot;We take this moment to remind prosecutors and their staffs that the Racial Justice Act mentions the idea of training program, to help weed out racial bias as they exercise their broad discretion in capital cases,&quot; said the Rev. William J. Barber II, president of the NAACP in North Carolina.
<br />&quot;We encourage the Association of District Attorneys to take advantage of such training to drain some of the unconscious and conscious racial bias out of our courthouses.&quot;
<br />After Friday's ruling, Robinson's mother Shirley Burnes told CNN affiliate WTVD that her son expected Friday's decision &quot;because it<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jYXJyZXJhZ2xhc3Nlc3N0b3JlLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.carreraglassesstore.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.carreraglassesstore.com</a></a>was true facts, and that's it.&quot;
<br />She said she understood that the ruling could make way for other such successful appeals in North Carolina.
<br />&quot;This has been a hard long journey,&quot; Burnes said. &quot;And there are others out there who will be affected by this.&quot;

<br />The Bhoja Air passenger jet crashed Friday <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jYXJyZXJhZ2xhc3Nlc3N0b3JlLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> carrera sunglasses </a>as it tried to land in a thunderstorm at Islamabad's main airport, killing all 127 people on board and reviving concerns about aviation safety in a country saddled by massive economic problems, an embattled government, and Islamist insurgency.
<br />The small domestic airline, which only resumed operations last month after suspending them in 2001 due to financial difficulties, said after the crash that the weather was the cause of the accident.
<br />Speaking at the scene of the disaster, Interior Minister Rehman Malik said that Farooq Bhoja, head of Bhoja Air, had been put on the &amp;quot;exit control list,&amp;quot; meaning he can't leave Pakistan. Such a ban is often put on someone suspected or implicated in a criminal case. He said Bhoja had been ordered into protective custody and a criminal investigation launched into the incident.
<br />He later said that the airline &amp;quot;seems to be at fault as it had acquired a very old aircraft.&amp;quot;
<br />&amp;quot;If the airline management doesn't have enough money it doesn't mean you go and buy a 30-year-old or more aircraft as if it were a rickshaw and start an airline.&amp;quot;
<br />Separately, Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani said he has ordered a judicial commission to probe the accident and said, &amp;quot;It is not fair to reach any conclusion without a proper investigation.&amp;quot;
<br />Jahanzeb Khan, a Bhoja Air representative, declined comment.
<br />The weak government has come under immediate media criticism for granting Bhoja, one of only three private airlines in Pakistan, a license. Gilani and Malik maybe trying to deflect some of that criticism. Such is the distrust of the state in Pakistan, few believe that the government has the will to hold wealthy or political connected people accountable, or carry out credible investigations.
<br />Given the violent storm lashing Islamabad during the accident, some experts have speculated that &amp;quot;wind shear,&amp;quot; sudden changes in wind that can lift or smash an aircraft into the ground during landing, may have been a factor. It may even have been a dangerous localized form of the phenomena, called a microburst. That can cause planes to lose airspeed suddenly or lift abruptly if a headwind suddenly changes to a tail wind during takeoff or landing.
<br />Soldiers and emergency workers at first light began the grim task of looking for bodies and body parts among the debris from the Boeing 737-200, which was spread out over a one-kilometer (mile) stretch of wheat farms around five kilometers (three miles) from the Benazir Bhutto International Airport.
<br />The plane was on a flight from the southern city of Karachi to Islamabad when it crashed at dusk.
<br />One soldier had a plastic bag over his hand and was picking up small bits of flesh. Another was using a stick to get at remains in a tree. The smell of decomposing bodies was beginning to fill the air.
<br />&amp;quot;We are collecting these so that the souls are not desecrated,&amp;quot; one of them said.
<br />The officers were also picking up personal effects of the passengers, making piles of documents, bank cards, gold and bangles.
<br />The last major plane crash in the country — and Pakistan's worst — occurred in July 2010 when an Airbus A321 aircraft operated by domestic carrier Airblue crashed into the hills overlooking Islamabad, killing all 152 people aboard. A government investigation blamed the pilot for veering off course amid stormy weather.
<br />According to the Web site  the Bhoja jet was 32 years old and first saw service with British Airways in South Africa. Thirty-two years is not especially old for an aircraft, and age by itself is rarely an important factor in crashes, said Nasim Ahmed, a former crash investigator.
<br />Ahmed said it appeared at this stage that the age and air worthiness of the plane were unlikely causes.
<br />He said that a combination of factors during the most crucial stage of the flight, the landing, was probably to blame, possibly the weather or some form of unexpected incident that caused the pilot to lose vital awareness of the plane's location.
<br />Ahmed said the accident highlighted long-standing weaknesses in Pakistan's aviation industry, which he said couldn't be separated from management problems in the Civil Aviation Authority, poor government oversight and corruption and <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jYXJyZXJhZ2xhc3Nlc3N0b3JlLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.carreraglassesstore.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.carreraglassesstore.com</a></a>nepotism in the state-owned Pakistan International Airlines.
<br />In 2007, the European Union banned most PIA flights from its member's airports for eight months due to safety concerns. &amp;quot;There are problems in the overall handling of the country, and the Civil Aviation Authority is not an isolated pocket of good governance,&amp;quot; he said.

<br />Spinning the facts as they emerge poses more risk: The Secret Service and the military are supposed to be above politics, dedicated to protecting presidents, their families and the nation.
<br />&quot;Sure, it creates a problem for President Obama. It adds to the sense that Washington is broken. But if the Republicans try to make this a point in their arguments, they are making a big mistake,&quot;GOP strategist Karl Rove said on &quot;Fox News Sunday.&quot;
<br />A dozen Secret Service personnel and another 12 military enlistees preparing for Obama's visit to Cartagena are being investigated for cavorting with prostitutes. Six Secret Service agents have been let go over the incident, and on Monday, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta told reporters his department has suspended the security clearances of the military personnel being investigated. As many as 20 prostitutes were involved with the group, officials say. None are believed to be underage.
<br />The incident came to light after one of the prostitutes argued with a Secret Service agent over her payment in a hallway of the Caribe hotel. Local law enforcement intervened on the prostitute's behalf. Paid sex is legal in Cartagena, but violates codes of conduct for U.S. personnel who were working there.
<br />Secret Service Director Mark Sullivan launched an investigation and requested an independent probe by the Homeland Security Department's inspector general. Sullivan ousted some of those implicated and, perhaps as importantly, he busily briefed key members of Congress who left no doubt they would hold public hearings should they find his investigation insufficient.
<br />For now, there's no complaint about the swift pace of the fallout or Sullivan's thoroughness. But there's been much<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jYXJyZXJhZ2xhc3Nlc3N0b3JlLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.carreraglassesstore.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.carreraglassesstore.com</a></a>discretion, strategic question-asking and even notable silence from some members of Congress, uncharacteristic restraint in a tense election year sizzling with gender politics.

<br />2. Don’t overplan - There is nothing wrong with planning your goals in life, however if you try to perfect your planning, you won’t take action on any of your goals.
<br />3. Meet new people – When you constantly meet new people, you will see yourself learning a lot about yourself and others as well. You can then use the new knowledge to contribute and help others.
<br />4. Practice being present - When you are engaged in a specific task/activity or are having a conversation with someone, make sure that you are fully present and not caught up thinking about the past or future.
<br />5. Take leadership roles – Start taking leadership roles in every area of your life. Organize a workshop or plan a trip or a social event. When you start taking leadership roles, your self-confidence will rise.
<br />6. Note down all of your ideas - Whenever an idea pops into your head make sure to write it down somewhere so you can refer back to it. There are going to be those times where your mind will suddenly get creative ideas, so make sure that you have a pen and paper handy.
<br />7. Set aside “alone time” - Spend a half hour every day by yourself in a quiet place and take time to think about your goals for the future. Think about where you want to be in the next ten years.
<br />8. Spend more time outdoors - Get outside the house/office more often. You don’t have to plan a big trip to get out. It can be as simple as going for a hike or walking by the beach. You will be able to think clearly and focus better on your tasks. Don’t become a workaholic and get burnt out.
<br />9. Attend seminars - Start attending helpful workshops and seminars of topics that interest you. You will be surprised by the knowledge you will gain. You will also meet like-minded people and make new friends.
<br />10. Read more often - Turn off the television and start reading more. Once you start developing a habit of reading, you will notice that your vision will expand and you will see the world in a whole different way.
<br />11. Don’t talk about yourself too much – If you are ever interacting with close friends or at a social event, don’t make a habit of talking about yourself and your success. This is a sign of insecurity. Instead, take interest in others unless or until someone asks you more about what you do.
<br />12. Spend minimum time browsing the web – When you constantly browse the web, your mind will be cluttered with different images and thoughts and you will get sidetracked from all your goals. You will start getting imaginary thoughts that will get you nowhere.
<br />13. Go to the gym at least four times a week - When you make a habit of working out frequently you will have a lot of positive energy that will help you in other areas of your life. Put it on your calendar and make it a “must do” task.
<br />14. Don’t delay to have fun - Some people think that they need to have a lot of money in order to have fun. They think that one day that big paycheck will solve all the problems in life. Life will have its ups and downs regardless of whether you have accumulated a lot of wealth. Don’t wait for that big day to arrive to have all your fun. Enjoy every minute of life.
<br />15. Be honest with yourself - Be very honest with yourself about who you are and what you want out of your life. Spend time thinking about what your purpose is in life. When you are aligned with your purpose in life, you won’t get many conflicting thoughts that will leave you confused about who you are. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jYXJyZXJhZ2xhc3Nlc3N0b3JlLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.carreraglassesstore.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.carreraglassesstore.com</a></a>

Most are due to common eye disease, such as cataracts and glaucoma, which can be avoidable by suitable diets and good habits.
<br />A balanced diet and a good habit are <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jYXJyZXJhLWdsYXNzZXMuY29t" target="_blank"> carrera sunglasses </a>introduced to keep good eyesight in the following.
<br />Blueberry is rich for antioxidants which can effectively prevent the age-related macular degeneration (ARMD) mostly happened among the elderly. ARMD is regarded as the main cause of age-related blindness, so eating more blueberries can delay or avoid the disease.
<br />Spinach is abundant with lutein which can also prevent the ARMD and cataracts diseases. Fat, such as olive oil is suggested to take with spinach for better absorption.
<br />Red onion but not the yellow one is affluent in element of quercetin, one kind of antioxidants, which can act as the same function to guard against ARMD and cataracts diseases.
<br />Fish is full of omeg-3 fatty acids which is the bane for dry eyes. You are recommended to have fish twice a week. If you are not able to take fish for some reason, you can exchange for other kind of food containing the same nutrients.
<br />Sweet potato contains high Vitamin A, which is useful for enhancing the night vision.
<br />Greasy or sweet foods, high in omega-6 fatty acids, deteriorate or cause the ARMD disease. So you'd better be away with this kind of food, including potato chips and hamburgers.
<br />Multivitamin pills contain various different Vitamins which are needed by our body to keep in an excellent condition, so you can take the pills every day to guarantee the body requirement. At least 150mg Vitamin C is needed to prevent cataracts effectively.
<br />Smoking is bad for your whole body, and eye is no exception. Smoking is one reason for ARMD, glaucoma and dry eyes. Considering from your eyesight, please get rid of the awful habit.
<br />Do not let the air from air-conditioner to blow your eyes directly. Because long time exposure will increase the choice of dry eyes, then the following corneal abrasion.
<br />Do adjust your computer below your eye level to make sure that your eyes can be half-closed when looking at the screen. In this way, the possibility of fluid evaporation and dry eyes can be greatly reduced.
<br />No one would like to get an eye surgery. No one would like to wear eyeglasses. However, everyone would like to have good eyesight.

We have to see the world through them, and our daily lives are in need of them. In this sense, we should protect our eyes as we can. Here are some advices<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNoYWVsa29yc2hhbmRiYWdzb3V0bGV0d2ViLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> michael kors handbags </a>on how to take care of our eyes.
<br />The awareness of protecting eyes should be nurtured since early time. Especially, we should know how to protect our eyes under sunlight.
<br />The commonest way is to wear sunglasses. However, there is one disadvantage in this method. It is true that our eyes can <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNoYWVsa29yc2hhbmRiYWdzb3V0bGV0d2ViLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> michael kors outlet </a>be protected by the glasses, but the skin and tissues around our eyes will suffer.
<br />Another one is to use some sunscreen. This method has a disadvantage. That is the skin around our eyes may suffer from some water loss which can always lead to puffy eyes.
<br />Use some moist cream is also very nice. It can help keep sufficient moisture that our skins need.
<br />Most of us always wonder whether there is a good way to relax ourselves and our eyes. In fact, sufficient sleep is really the best way for the health of our bodies and eyes. The commonest symptoms caused by insufficient sleep, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNoYWVsa29yc2hhbmRiYWdzb3V0bGV0d2ViLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> michael kors </a>as black circles, etc. will be eliminated if we have sound sleep.
<br />When we are over 25, we will have to pay more attention to our skins, especially these around our eyes. Fortunately, there are some very effective anti-aging creams for eyes. Of course, it is very essential for us to know more information about these creams. Perhaps searching online is a good means to get such information. Creams with matrixvl or resveratrol are very effective. Anyway, we are not suggested to us these cheap ones with low quality. All aforesaid points should be noticed, for screams matter very much on the health of our eyes.
<br />Any way, we should take care of our eyes because each of us has only two eyes and if they are injured, we will suffer a lot. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3d21pY2hhZWxrb3JzaGFuZGJhZ3NvdXRsZXR3ZWIuY29t" target="_blank"> <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.michaelkorshandbagsoutletweb.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.michaelkorshandbagsoutletweb.com</a> </a>

It’s important to people that they feel valid, important, and respected. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jYXJyZXJhLWdsYXNzZXMuY29t" target="_blank"> carrera sunglasses </a>Just as saying sorry matters, so too does remembering to thank those who help you move forward. Here are some tips and ideas:
<br />Email is nice; a personal card is better- It’s really easy to send email. I just sent a thank-you that way, and that’s what prompted me to post this. And yet, looking back, I think it’s much nicer to send along a physical card. A personal note written by your own hand inside matters far more than a few lines of type into a window that’s so easily available at your fingertips. It shows you care enough to take an extra step.
<br />Write specifically- We’ve all done it: we get a gift from someone around the holidays or our birthday but we forget who sent what, so we send out that generic “Thanks very much for the gift.” People know. They feel a little less special when you’ve sent a generic reply. I find that people respond really well to targeted responses. “Thanks for the copy of IMPROV WISDOM. I really look forward to reading it, and look forward to discussing it with you when we talk next.” That’s simple, brief, and targeted.
<br />Use nice cards and a nice pen- If you’re going to go this route, put in the extra few minutes to purchase nice notecards and use a pen that gives you decent flow. You don’t have to break the bank to still give a professional and yet personal presence via the thank-you note you select and the ink you use to sign it. And, just like attractive-looking people don’t always have a great voice for radio, an expensive pen isn’t always the best flowing pen. Read up on pens and their value on sites like PigPog, where Michael is nigh obsessed with quality writing materials.
<br />In person- Make sure you say thank-you to people face to face when you have the opportunity. The same “content” applies. Be brief, be specific, and be warm about it. Say so in an unhurried way, looking into the person’s eyes. It is not enough to just say the words, or at least it won’t have the same effect. Don’t make it into a miniseries TV moment, but do try to make sure the person senses how imporant their contribution to your life really was.
<br />I won’t belabor the point more than this. Thank the people in your life who add value, and make sure you spread a little<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jYXJyZXJhLWdsYXNzZXMuY29t" target="_blank"> <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.carrera-glasses.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.carrera-glasses.com</a></a>good karma that way. Be kind and generous in your thanks, and the results will almost always be favorable.

We are told by government to be alert to the risk of terrorists. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNoYWVsa29yc2hhbmRiYWdzb3V0bGV0d2ViLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> michael kors handbags </a>And we are watched by CCTV wherever we go. But all this advice to be watchful makes us fearful. It makes us shrink into ourselves. We become unkind, unconcerned for others, and our children become terrified of the outside world.
<br />These days, you have to have a Criminal Records Bureau check before you volunteer to work with anyone described as vulnerable — children, anyone over 65, and a whole lot of others besides. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNoYWVsa29yc2hhbmRiYWdzb3V0bGV0d2ViLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> michael kors outlet </a>That makes many young men, especially, nervous about volunteering at all, and others deeply irritated that they are being asked for a CRB check to work, say, in hospital radio.
<br />If a young man has a criminal record, but now wants to help others who are younger still — just getting into trouble with the police and at risk of worse — he has to be incredibly determined not to be put off by the marathon of bureaucracy.
<br />Hospital staff are often told not to put an arm round patients to comfort them lest it be viewed as assault. So it tends to be the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNoYWVsa29yc2hhbmRiYWdzb3V0bGV0d2ViLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> michael kors </a>porters and care assistants who give a bit of comfort, while the nurses only touch the patients when they have to carry out some kind of intervention. Many people, especially older people, don’t want too many interventions. What they want is human contact, a bit of tender loving care.
<br />We are all so terrified of child sexual abuse that we have outlawed taking photographs of children at nursery school without parental consent. And adults are terrified that their motives will be suspected if they talk to a child or, even worse, hug one. So, a few years ago, when Clive Peachy, a bricklayer, saw two-year-old Abigail Rae walking down the road after she had escaped from her nursery school in Warwickshire, he did not stop and help her because he thought people would think he was trying to abduct her. The result? She drowned in a pond.
<br />Young male volunteers in primary schools describe feeling like pariahs, viewed with suspicion by many staff — when all they are doing is trying to help. And children want comfort if they fall over in the playground, yet teachers have been told never to touch the children in their care. So you get 12-year-olds with broken legs crying for their mothers, with staff unable to give them a hug, and five-year-olds putting sunscreen on each other because the teachers have been instructed not to touch them. The mess that ensues, and the visits to hospital because cream gets in their eyes, would be funny were it not so ridiculous. Equally absurd are the letters informing parents that children should not bring home-made birthday cakes into school in case of food poisoning — a position that results in children being less likely to share.
<br />So what is all this about? First, there is a real fear of being sued, far greater than the actual numbers of cases would warrant. Second, there is a fear of what others might think. We have begun to internalise the messages that people might think we are abusers when we are not. Third, we are fearful of our children being injured, being killed, being abducted. Yet, in terms of ordinary accidents happening to children, the numbers have gone down dramatically rather than up over the last 30 years.
<br />Nevertheless, our children are frightened to go outside because, as the think-tank Demos and the Green Alliance demonstrated a few years ago, they fear the outside world. They think the streets are full of terrorists, murderers and child-abductors. Worse, they think they know what they look like. They are white, male, middle-aged, wear horrible clothes and have a funny look in their eyes.
<br />But children would not feel like this if adults did not encourage them. It is adult fear, stoked by government and insurers, by risk assessors and hospital and school managers. If we aren’t careful, the next generation will consist entirely of wimps. They will go off on adventure holidays abroad, but they will not walk down the street or get on the Tube alone for fear of attackers. The net result will be not only a lack of life skills, but overwhelming fear: of predators, of accidents, of life itself.
<br />Meanwhile, the sexual predators will carry on just as before — largely in the family — because no system of checks will root them out completely. And we will have created a whole generation of unhappy people. We need to be sensible, not risk-averse; we need to look out to see<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3d21pY2hhZWxrb3JzaGFuZGJhZ3NvdXRsZXR3ZWIuY29t" target="_blank"> <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.michaelkorshandbagsoutletweb.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.michaelkorshandbagsoutletweb.com</a> </a>where we can help others. And, sometimes, we may even need to touch them.

Now, research suggests that caffeine activates the same fat-busting genes as an hour's exercise. Somebody, pass the espresso.
<br />A team of researchers from the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden, were interested in the genetic activity in the body during exercise. By taking biopsies from the legs of participants, they were able to work out that several genes associated with metabolizing fat are activated by exercise—but only after an hour or so. That means that your body breaks down fat more effectively<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNoYWVsa29yc2hhbmRiYWdzb3V0bGV0d2ViLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> michael kors outlet </a> after an hour's exercise.
<br />But what they also found was that the exact same genes are activated by large doses of caffeine, a finding they report in Cell Metabolism. In fact, the caffeine causes the body to release calcium, which tricks it into thinking that muscles are being contracted—hence the effect.<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNoYWVsa29yc2hhbmRiYWdzb3V0bGV0d2ViLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> michael kors </a>Sadly, the doses of caffeine required to achieve the same effect as an hour's exercise are... intimidating to say the least. &quot;[You] would need to consume a caffeine equivalent of about 50 cups [of coffee] per day, almost close to a lethal dose&quot;, explains Juleen Zierath, one of the researchers, to Nature. Maybe exercise is easier after all. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNoYWVsa29yc2hhbmRiYWdzb3V0bGV0d2ViLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.michaelkorshandbagsoutletweb.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.michaelkorshandbagsoutletweb.com</a> </a>

<br />Officer Bert Lopez's dismissal from the New Mexico state police was confirmed by The Santa Fe New Mexican on Saturday. The newspaper said Lopez has 30 days to appeal the firing.
<br />The surveillance photos were taken from a motion-triggered security camera positioned at the front gate of the county-owned <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNoYWVsa29yc2hhbmRiYWdzb3V0bGV0d2ViLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> michael kors outlet </a>La Bajada Ranch south of Santa Fe. The encounter was at the remote Canyon Ranch.
<br />Two photos showing a uniformed officer having sex on the hood were forwarded to Santa Fe Sheriff Robert Garcia, who identified the officer as being with New Mexico State Police. He forwarded the images to State Police Chief Robert Shilling.
<br />An internal investigation was immediately launched, and Lopez, an eight-year veteran, was put on paid administrative leave for about three weeks.
<br />Police officials would not comment on whether the dismissal was an indication whether the officer was on duty at the time of the incident.
<br />The dismissal came days after <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNoYWVsa29yc2hhbmRiYWdzb3V0bGV0d2ViLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> michael kors </a>investigators said the officer didn't commit a crime. Officials were assured the sexual encounter was not in exchange for anything related to his position as a law enforcement officer.
<br />&quot;It is an embarrassing situation for the department, but we have to remember the rights of the employee afford him due process we must follow so we won't be commenting further,&quot; said spokesman Sgt. Tim Johnson.
<br />The department refused to release the identity of the woman or details about her relationship with the officer. It was unclear when the photos were taken, but Garcia said he believed it was either late July or early August.
<br />If Lopez contests his firing, the appeal goes to a special commission within the New Mexico state police department and then <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNoYWVsa29yc2hhbmRiYWdzb3V0bGV0d2ViLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.michaelkorshandbagsoutletweb.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.michaelkorshandbagsoutletweb.com</a> </a> state District Court, according to the New Mexican.

		<document id="dba22dc5159a84f47905454f2836cb5f" url=""><![CDATA[Female Orgasm Remains an Evolutionary Mystery<br/><br/>After baffling biologists for decades, the female orgasm has resisted yet another attempt to explain its elusive evolutionary <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNoYWVsa29yc2hhbmRiYWdzb3V0bGV0d2ViLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> michael kors handbags </a> origins.
<br />A survey of orgasmic function in thousands of twins found none of the statistical patterns expected if female orgasm is just a coincidental byproduct of natural selection on its male counterpart, as has been suggested.
<br />“The evolutionary basis of human <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNoYWVsa29yc2hhbmRiYWdzb3V0bGV0d2ViLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> michael kors outlet </a> female orgasm has been subject to furious scientific debate, which has recently intensified,” wrote University of Queensland geneticist Brendan Zietsch and Pekka Santtila of Finland’s Abo Akedemi University in a Sept. 3 Animal Behavior article. “These results challenge the byproduct theory of female orgasm.”
<br /><br />While the male orgasm is, in evolutionary and practical terms, a fairly straightforward thing — it makes men want to have sex more often, thus continuing their lineage, and is achieved with ease — the female orgasm is a far trickier beast.
<br />Unlike male orgasm, which is found across the primate spectrum, female orgasm has skipped some species. (Lady gibbons,<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNoYWVsa29yc2hhbmRiYWdzb3V0bGV0d2ViLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> michael kors </a>for example, are out of luck.) In humans, men are far more likely to experience orgasm than women, of whom one in 10 don’t ever experience it.
<br />That imbalance runs contrary to traditional explanations of female orgasm: that it strengthens bonds between mates and thus improves the care received by their children, or that the ability to elicit orgasm indicates a male’s virility, or that underlying physiological processes somehow improve reproductive success.
<br />‘The evolutionary basis of human female orgasm has been subject to furious scientific debate.’
<br /><br />After all, if female orgasms are an important evolutionary adaptation, they should be easier to attain. Also perplexing is that many women require clitoral stimulation to achieve orgasm, not penetrative action. If female orgasms were meant to encourage sex, the opposite ought to be true.
<br />All this has led to an alternative explanation, popularized in Elisabeth Lloyd’s popular 2005 book The Case of the Female Orgasm: That there’s no adaptive purpose. Women simply happen to share biology with men, for whom orgasm is important. It’s an accidental byproduct, like men’s nonlactating nipples.
<br />But while this idea is plausible, it hasn’t yet been rigorously explored. So Zietsch and Santtila devised a test. They surveyed 1,803 pairs of opposite-sex twins and 2,287 pairs of same-sex twins, asking them how often and how easily they reached orgasm. If female orgasm is evolutionarily connected to male, opposite-sex twins should have similar orgasmic function.
<br />But that’s not what they found. Instead, while orgasmic function was genetically shared in same-sex twins — brother tended to share function with brother, or sister with sister — the relationship vanished in opposite-sex twins, though both share the same amount of genetic material. The underlying genetics, and thus the underlying evolutionary pressures, thus appear to differ.
<br />“This does not support the hypothesis that female orgasm is maintained only as a byproduct of selection on the male orgasm,” wrote Zietsch and Santtila.
<br />However, the researchers warn that their findings aren’t yet definitive. Self-reported surveys aren’t methodologically airtight, and a recent Journal of Sexual Medicine study by Zietsch “found near-zero correlations between women’s orgasm rates and 19 other evolutionarily relevant traits.”
<br />Those findings contradict the latest study, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNoYWVsa29yc2hhbmRiYWdzb3V0bGV0d2ViLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.michaelkorshandbagsoutletweb.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.michaelkorshandbagsoutletweb.com</a> </a>and suggest female orgasm might be a byproduct after all. It might also have been evolutionarily important to humanity’s ancestors, but irrelevant now.
<br />“The evolutionary basis of female orgasm is both important and unknown,” wrote Zietsch and Santtila. “Much more work needs to be done.”

<br />Scheindlin called that &quot;disturbing.&quot;
<br />&quot;First, suspicionless stops should never occur,&quot; Scheindlin wrote.
<br />Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly declined to comment. Mayor Michael Bloomberg defended the program, saying it had helped the city prevent thousands of deaths.
<br />&quot;It's taken more than 6,000 guns off <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNoYWVsa29yc2hhbmRiYWdzb3V0bGV0d2ViLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> michael kors </a>the streets in the last eight years, and this year we are on pace to have the lowest number of murders in recorded history,&quot; Bloomberg said. &quot;We're not going to do anything that undermines that trend and threatens public safety.&quot;
<br />The city law office said in a statement: &quot;We respectfully disagree with the decision and are reviewing our legal options.&quot;
<br />Darius Charney, who argued the case on behalf of the Center for Constitutional Rights, a non-profit legal organization, said the ruling &quot;reinforces that this is a citywide problem theNYPD needs to address.&quot;
<br />The RAND Corp. research organization, in a study commissioned by the NYPD and released in 2007, acknowledged that &quot;black pedestrians were stopped at a rate that is 50% greater than their representation in the residential census.&quot; <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNoYWVsa29yc2hhbmRiYWdzb3V0bGV0d2ViLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.michaelkorshandbagsoutletweb.com%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.michaelkorshandbagsoutletweb.com/</a></a>

Deb Fischer's upset win in Nebraska's Republican Senate primary, the campaign battle lines were drawn, with Ms. Fischer stressing her deep roots as a rancher in the state and former Sen. Bob Kerrey, a Democrat, emphasizing his record of deviating from his party's orthodoxy.
<br />&amp;amp;quot;We don't need the same type of person who's supposedly going to represent us in Washington,&amp;amp;quot; Ms. Fischer told supporters <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNoYWVsa29yc2hhbmRiYWdzb3V0bGV0d2ViLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> michael kors outlet </a> Tuesday night. &amp;amp;quot;We need somebody different, somebody who's tough, somebody who's effective, somebody who's a Nebraskan.&amp;amp;quot;
<br />That might have been a dig at Mr. Kerrey, who has lived in New York for a decade as president of the New School in Manhattan, though he's served as Nebraska governor and senator and owns restaurants and fitness <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNoYWVsa29yc2hhbmRiYWdzb3V0bGV0d2ViLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> michael kors </a>clubs in the state.
<br />Mr. Kerrey, in an interview, said solving the country's biggest problems requires lawmakers willing to buck their parties, and he questioned whether Ms. Fischer would do that. &amp;amp;quot;I do not think we will get the deficit behind us unless people are willing to break from their caucuses,&amp;amp;quot; Mr. Kerrey said.
<br />Following the victory of Ms. Fischer—a little-known state legislator—Democrats and Republicans were trying to determine what her candidacy would mean for a race seen by many as Republicans' best opportunity to pick up a Senate seat. Democrats depict Ms. Fischer, 61 years old, as an untested candidate, while Republicans stress her role as a mother and rancher from the small town of Valentine.
<br />Ms. Fischer was defined during the primary in part by what she wasn't—neither an establishment candidate like state Attorney General Jon Bruning nor the tea-party candidate like state Treasurer Don Stenberg. That ultimately worked in her favor.
<br />But Ms. Fischer, despite a low profile even in Nebraska, is comfortably within the state's political orbit. Her father worked for former GOP Gov. Kay Orr, and she chairs the transportation committee in the state legislature, where her signature initiative was a bill to accelerate road construction using a portion of the state's sales tax revenue.
<br />Sen. Mike Johanns (R., Neb.) noted that she has opposed Gov. Dave Heineman, a fellow Republican, on roads issues as well as supporting him on tax issues. &amp;amp;quot;She would stand toe-to-toe with anybody,&amp;amp;quot; Mr. Johanns said.
<br />Democrats hope to turn Ms. Fischer's identity as a rancher against her, portraying her not only as a conservative ideologue who's in over her head but also as a hypocrite. They cited a report in the Omaha World-Herald that Ms. Fischer grazed her cattle on federal land for a reduced fee despite her support for government frugality. Ms. Fischer has said ranchers help manage the federal land and that she doesn't set the rates.
<br />Mr. Kerrey, 70, won't be a pushover. A former Navy SEAL and Medal of Honor winner, he had his right leg amputated after a war injury in Vietnam. He served as governor and two-term senator and gained a dash of glamour from dating actress Debra Winger. In an interview, he called Ms. Fischer a &amp;amp;quot;very good opponent&amp;amp;quot; and suggested that he faces a tough race. &amp;amp;quot;All I can say is that I felt duty bound to get in the race.…As to whether the voters ask me to go back and represent them, that remains to be seen.&amp;amp;quot; <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNoYWVsa29yc2hhbmRiYWdzb3V0bGV0d2ViLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.michaelkorshandbagsoutletweb.com%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.michaelkorshandbagsoutletweb.com/</a></a>
