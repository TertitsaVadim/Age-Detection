Scientists are working hard to create fuels that burn clean and are safe for the earth. Latest developments have resulted in fuels that not just burn clean but provides an advantage to drivers. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2dhc21hcmtldDA2Lndpa2lzcGFjZXMuY29tL0FsdGVybmF0aXZlK0Z1ZWxzK0FyZStIZXJlK1RvK1N0YXk_" target="_blank">Alternative Fuels: Not A Craze</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL21hcnlzYXd5ZXI0MTAubGl2ZWpvdXJuYWwuY29tLzY4My5odG1s" target="_blank">Alternative Fuels Are Never Going Away</a><br /><br />The most famous alternative fuel today is ethanol. Ethanol, also known as grain alcohol, is created from either soya or corn. On the market, you can purchase E85, which is a blend of 85% ethanol, and 15% gas. Many who use it say that it burns cleaner that petrol and offers better gas mileage. Though there is gas in E85, it does not emit as much toxins as normal petrol. Aside from corn and soya beans, plant materials from logging, old paper and other organic materials can be used to make ethanol. One other alternative type of fuel that is akin to ethanol is methanol.<br /><br />Methanol, or wood alcohol, is a biomass fuel derived from materials like wood or coal. Wood alcohol can be produce affordably from natural gas or propane. Propane, or compressed natural gas, is usual in many homes but has been gaining traction for fueling automobiles. Just like crude oil, propane is fuel that can be found underground. Nonetheless, unlike crude oil, propane is a gas and not a liquid. Its popularity has grown over the years as natural gas is an eco-friendly fuel. One other fuel type that is widelyy used is electricity.<br /><br />While electric vehicles have been around for , they have become very popular recently. The electric automobile sources its power from batteries instead of petrol. So as to power the electric-powered car, it may take 12 or 24 batteries. The latest alternative vehicle fuel is hydrogen, and it is so fascinating as well as promising. Hydrogen fuel is still in its early development stages but the potential is there. Hydrogen has potential because it is not difficult to produce and very light to use. Many people believe that hydrogen will become the next essential fuel for future cars.<br /><br />These are merely a few of the many alternative fuels on the market these days. As we become more fearful of global warming, efforts will be made to discover better alternative fuels. Alternative fuels will increase in popularity, and their place will go up and down depending on what is  next.

Scientists are working hard to create fuels that burn clean and won't damage the environment. There are some alternative fuels that have been found safe for the earth while giving value to the driver. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2ppbW1pZXR1cm5lcjYxLnhhbmdhLmNvbS83NTYwNjg1NjIvYWx0ZXJuYXRpdmUtZnVlbHMtYXJlLWhlcmUtdG8tc3RheS8_" target="_blank">Alternative Fuels: Not A Fad</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2dhc21hcmtldDA2Lndpa2lzcGFjZXMuY29tL0FsdGVybmF0aXZlK0Z1ZWxzK0FyZStIZXJlK1RvK1N0YXk_" target="_blank">Alternative Fuels Are Heree For Good</a><br /><br />Perhaps the most well-known of alternative fuels is ethanol. It is also called grain alcohol, and it is generally made from either corn or soya. There are places selling fuel that is a mixture of 85% ethanol and 15% gas which is known as E85. Individuals who use E85 see that they get better gas mileage and feels that the fuel is burning cleaner than the average gas. Although there is gas in E85, it does not emit as much toxins as regular gas. Plant material left from logging, and rubbish including paper, can be used to make ethanol, and so can other organic materials, such as agricultural crops and wastes. Because they both are alcohol-based products, methanol is a type of alternative fuel very similar to ethanol.<br /><br />Methanol, or wood alcohol, is a biomass fuel derived from biomass materials such as wood or coal. Methanol can be created cheaply from natural gas or propane. Another alternative fuel has been used in homes for many years, but today is rising in popularity for cars, and that is propane, a compressed natural gas. Like petroleum, natural gas is extracted from the earth. You need to know that propane is not a liquid but a true gas similar air. Its popularity has increased over the years because propane is an earth-friendly fuel. Still another type of fuel that has gained popularity is electricity.<br /><br />Due to environmental concerns, electric cars are getting popular once again, even though they have been around for several years. The power of the electric auto comes from batteries instead of burning gas. An electric car may require 12 to 24 batteries to power it. Yet another alternative type of fuel that has promise is hydrogen. Majority of the cars using this fuel now are experimental, but there is much potential for this energy source, which is kind of unique. It is bringing plenty of excitement through the environmental fuel industry, since it is so easy to make and also because it is so light. A lot of people believe that hydrogen will become the next great fuel for future cars.<br /><br />These are merely a few of the several alternative fuels on the market nowadays. With everyone worred about global warming, every effort is being made to create even better and more efficient alternative fuels. Alternative fuels will continue to grow in popular, and their place will go up and down depending on what is created next.

There are scientists who are working diligently to make fuel sources that are clean and healthy for the earth. Recent developments have resulted in fuels that not merely burn clean but provides an advantage to vehicle owners. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2tub3dob3ctbm93LmNvbS9tL2FydGljbGVzL2Jyb3dzZS9jYXRlZ29yeS9FbnZpcm9ubWVudA__" target="_blank">gas market</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2tub3dob3ctbm93LmNvbQ__" target="_blank">gas market</a><br /><br />The most famous alternative fuel today is ethanol. Ethanol, also known as grain alcohol, is produced from either soya beans or corn. On the market, you can get E85, which is a mixture of 85% ethanol, and 15% gas. For individuals who use it, they save on gas mileage because ethanol burns much cleaner than petrol. E85 still burns clean even though it does contain gas. Ethanol can be created from any organic material such as waste from crops, tossed paper and the like. An alternative fuel type that is similar to ethanol is methanol.<br /><br />Methanol can be made out of biomass resources, such as wood and coal, and is referred to as wood alcohol. Today, making methanol is inexpensive as it can be made from natural gas or propane. One more fuel that is becoming increasingly popular is propane or compressed natural gas. Propane is a regular fuel that comes from underground, similar to petroleum. As the name suggests, propane is a gas much like air, and not like crude oil which is a liquid. As it is a really earth-friendly fuel, natural gas is becoming increasingly popular. An alternative fuel that has been with us for many years is old-fashioned electricity.<br /><br />Even though electric-powered autos have been around for yearsmany years, they have become very popular as of late. An electric-powered automobile runs on electric power stored in batteries, rather than burning petrol in an engine. To run the electric-powered car, it will need 12 or 24 batteries. The latest alternative vehicle fuel is hydrogen, and it is extremely interesting as well as promising. Majority of the cars using this fuel nowadays are experimental, but there is much potential for this energy source, which is quite unique. It is bringing plenty of excitement through the environmental fuel industry, as it is so easy to create and also because it is so light. Hydrogen could become the next big alternative fuel that can be used for running your cars.<br /><br />What's discussed in the article is only a few of the alternative fuel sources available these days. As the masses become more fearful of global warming, efforts will be made to discover better alternative fuels. Alternative fuels will continue to grow in popular, and their place will rise and fall based on what is  next.
