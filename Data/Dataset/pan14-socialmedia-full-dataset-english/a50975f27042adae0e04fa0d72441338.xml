Mountain lands like the ones available, in Blue Ridge Parkway or Fancy Gap in Virginia, have many restaurants and resorts, to give fulfilling social life at this place. A checklist for mountain lands should include its proximity to eateries and places of entertainment, besides other amenities and basic requirements. Wilderness will have something new to present, but it is people who need golf resorts and restaurants to adjust to a place, and socialize with others. People looking for getaway vacation spots, are always eying secluded mountain properties to explore, but people who have plans to settle in such a place, have to search and check more aspects, about the property or land as, secluded property, is not a good option for them.
<br /><br />Properties with scenic views are therapeutic, and after one checks the view offered by a property in pictures during fall or summer, they should also try and know what safety measures are offered during winter, or when it snows heavily. For example, Blue Ridge Parkway has its private roads connected to school-bus roads. These are roads that will be given preference, when scraping is required. Hence, safety measures installed for the community that is built amidst greenery, is another aspect on the checklist to check. Next thing to check is the rules of this community and legal hold it executes on the house owners. This requires one to check for existence of Property Owners Association, as created by Blue Ridge Parkway, or other governing body, and also read and understand rules of contribution, work execution and maintenance in this region.
<br /><br />Commuting distance to highways should also be checked for, when buying a mountain land or property. For instance, Fancy Gap is just two miles away from Interstate 77 and takes only an hour, or more to reach Winston Salem, from Highway 52. Maintenance is also an aspect to look out for, when one has plans to invest in mountain properties. Less maintenance, high quality houses are scarcely offered, but when one is dealing with Blue Ridge Property developers in Fancy Gap, they are assured of higher quality for properties. The best part is the views that manifest from the house, which are magnificent. Websites that offer, listings in Mountain View properties are many, but ones that have pictures to support their claims, are too few.
<br /><br />Winding pathways in green around a house that overlooks beautiful scenery, is what everybody dreams to own and now, this dream can be realized with<strong> <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL21vdW50YWlubGFuZHZpcmdpbmlhLmNvbS8_" target="_blank">Fancy Gap</a></strong> and Blue Ridge Parkways properties and <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL21vdW50YWlubGFuZHZpcmdpbmlhLmNvbS8_" target="_blank">cabins in fancy gap va</a></strong>. All one has to do is, check necessary aspects before signing the deed. Rules that a community or property developer has put in place for such properties, should also be given some study, for some developers such as Blue Ridge Parkway Properties, restrict dirt bikes or bikes that make huge noise, disturbing the serenity of the location. Knowing this in advance, will help one prepare themselves to become more eco-friendly.

The huge difference between realtor and a land developer is the dedication, the latter puts in to develop the land, into something worthwhile. The former is always eying for ways and means to increasing the sale value of the property, and is not interested in developing it, or making it environment friendly. Making a property, as environment friendly as possible, will be the aim of a land developer, not a realtor, because amenities are what the latter wants to include, so property value increases. Community development is a tough job, needing right legal approach. A developer never neglects legal aspects involved in land development.
<br /><br />Fancy Gap in Virginia is a place ideal for vacation. If one were to get a chance to own a cabin house at this vacation destination, it would be wonderful. One need not worry about accommodation, when on vacation. Fancy Gap may or may not have cabin houses for sale, but surrounding land in this place has seen development, which is a good reason to own a cabin house, or a house in a community developed at this place. One may also love owning a house, with mountain backdrop, or magnificent views, as a retirement plan for future. It is close to nature is so close and one has the advantages of becoming healthy, living here or staying here for short durations. Besides, owning a second home at this place will definitely have economic benefits.
<br /><br />A peaceful place to retire is close to nature, modern amenities and well-connected, which is what makes Blue Ridge Parkway perfect in every aspect. Besides, it is a good choice for post-retirement settlement or as a second house, or a house for vacationers. Even in bad weather, being assured of staying connected is a rare scenario, but the Blue Ridge Parkway is safer even, when it snows, for they have private roads, connecting to main roads. Private ATV's are allowed in private communities like Blue Ridge Parkway. Single lanes are laid all around this place, which increase the security aspect, for thefts are minimal when roads are single lane. Maintaining cabins or houses at an elevation is easier, when compared to houses on flat surfaces, for there is no need to maintain yard, as it is natural and full of greenery at this place.
<br /><br />If being close to nature is a cherished dream, then Fancy Gap, Blue Ridge Parkway and similar other destinations like <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL21vdW50YWlubGFuZHZpcmdpbmlhLmNvbS9ibHVlLXJpZGdlLXBhcmt3YXktbGFuZC1mb3Itc2FsZS8_" target="_blank">cheap land for sale</a></strong> are right places to look for a retirement house or second house. Safety is also an aspect that these communities offer.

But there are many loop holes and pitfalls, when one is into buying such mountain lands, offered at cheap prices. It is always safer to buy developed land when it concerns mountain property, from an established property developer like Blue Ridge Property Developers. This is because, they advanced machinery to develop the land and make them safe, comfortable and fit to stay, which looks a good option, when one understands the ways they can be duped. Cheaper lands are not always cheap, there are many things involved for development of it, which needs a common man to invest hugely.
<br /><br />Steeper Lands, Acre Averages, Wells and more
<br /><br />If one is sure about buying a Mountain land, Virginia and develop it themselves, they should avoid buying steeper lands. These need one to invest heavily in repair, to lay appropriate roads, and ready the site for building. Many are not even informed about the condition of the land in mountain regions, for example wet soil, rocky surface and few other factors that make construction difficult or impossible, may lead the realtor to reduce the price drastically. One has to investigate the land for ground conditions, and calculate a rough draft for money that needs to be spent on repairs. This will give a clearer picture, I if or not the land is really cheap. All this research is taken up by a dedicated team from Blue Ridge Property developers, and they take measures to get the best land at its best price, and develop it.
<br /><br />Another pitfall is a property that has no well. It will increase the costs of development heavily, because one may have to hire, machinery and professionals for digging a well, pumping the water and also make arrangements to store it. Blue Ridge Property developers, create ponds for every property that is built. Another plus point of buying property in such a community is safety measures installed, besides modern amenities for ensuring safety. If one is buying a land on their own, they will have to look into safety measures, try and make roads leading to their houses better, and maintain it appropriately.
<br /><br />Buying Community Houses or Cabin
<br /><br />One advantage of buying a house in community that is developed by Blue Ridge Property developers is the availability of picnic spots, or places for gatherings and celebrations. Helipads help with faster transport, in case of medical emergencies. This sort of development needs huge investment for machinery, which is only possible for large scale developers like Blue Ridge Property developers. People who love wilderness and being close to nature, will always vote for buying a land on their own, but once the reality of utility costs, installation for communication modes such as telephone lines, septic tanks according to regulations of Health department, roads for commuting and, last but, very important factor to check is, if the construction is violating Mountain Protection Act.
