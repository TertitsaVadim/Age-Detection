<br />To tell the difference between
<br />Thieves and crooks
<br />When all along it was me and you
<br /><br />Give me something that I need
<br />Satisfaction guaranteed
<br />Because I’m thinking about
<br />a brand new hope
<br />The one I’ve never known

<br />Has the sweet breeze blown?
<br />Has all the kindness gone?
<br />Hope still lingers on.
<br />I drink myself of newfound pity
<br />Sitting alone in New York City
<br />And I don't know why.
<br />Don't know why.
<br /><br />So I walk up on high
<br />And I step to the edge
<br />To see my world below.
<br />And I laugh at myself
<br />While the tears roll down.
<br />'Cause it's the world I know.
<br />Ooooh it's the world I know.
<br /><br />Are we listening?
<br />Hymns of offering.
<br />Have we eyes to see?
<br />Love is gathering.
<br />All the words that I've been reading
<br />Have now started the act of bleeding
<br />Into one.
<br />Into one.
<br /><br />So I walk up on high
<br />And I step to the edge
<br />To see my world below.
<br />And I laugh at myself

<br />Light weights steppin aside when we comin'
<br /><br />Feel it in your chest the syllables get pumping
<br />People on the street they panic and start running
<br /><br />Words on loose leaf sheet complete coming
<br />I jump on my mind, I summon the rhyme, I'm dumping
<br /><br />Healing the blind I promise to let the sun in
<br />Sick of the dark ways we marched to the drummin'
<br /><br />Jump when they tell us that they wanna see jumping
<br />Fuck that I wanna see some fists pumping
<br /><br />Risk something, take back what's yours
<br />Say something that you know they might attack you for
<br /><br />Cause I'm sick of being treated like I have before
<br />Like it's stupid standing for what I'm standing for
<br /><br />Like this war's really just a different brand of war
<br />Like it doesn't cater the rich and abandon poor
<br /><br />Like they understand you in the back of the jet
<br />When you can't put gas in your tank
<br /><br />These fuckers are laughing their way to the bank and cashing their check
<br />Asking you to have compassion and have some respect
<br /><br />For a leader so nervous in an obvious way
<br />Stuttering and mumbling for nightly news to replay
<br /><br />And the rest of the world watching at the end of the day
<br />In their living room laughing like &quot;what did he say?&quot;
<br /><br />[Bridge]
<br />Amen
<br />Amen
<br />Amen
<br />Amen
<br />Amen
<br /><br />In my living room watching but I am not laughing
<br />Cause when it gets tense I know what might happen
<br /><br />The world is cold the bold men take action
<br />Have to react or get blown into fractions
<br /><br />Ten years old is something to see
<br />Another kid my age drug under the jeep
<br /><br />Taken and bound and found later under the tree
<br />I wonder if he thought the next one could be me
<br /><br />Do you see the soldiers that are out today
<br />To brush the dust from bullet proof vests away
<br /><br />It's ironic, at times like this you pray
<br />But a bomb blew the mosque up yesterday
<br /><br />There's bombs in the buses, bikes, roads
<br />Inside your market, your shops, your clothes
<br /><br />My dad he's got a lot of fear I know
<br />But enough pride inside not to let that show
<br /><br />My brother had a book he would hold with pride
<br />A little red cover with a broken spine
<br /><br />On the back, he hand wrote a quote inside
<br />&quot;When the rich wage war it's the poor who die&quot;
<br /><br />Meanwhile, the leader just talks away
<br />Stuttering and mumbling for nightly news to replay
<br /><br />And the rest of the world watching at the end of the day
<br />Both scared and angry like &quot;what did he say?&quot;
<br /><br />[Bridge]
<br />Amen
<br />Amen
<br />Amen
<br />Amen
<br />Amen
<br /><br />With hands held high into a sky so blue
<br />As the ocean opens up to swallow you
<br /><br />With hands held high into a sky so blue
<br />As the ocean opens up to swallow you
<br /><br />With hands held high into a sky so blue
<br />As the ocean opens up to swallow you
<br /><br />With hands held high into a sky so blue
<br />As the ocean opens up to swallow you
<br /><br />With hands held high into a sky so blue

<br /><br />Seasons are changing,
<br />And waves are crashing,
<br />And stars are falling all for us.
<br />Days grow longer and nights grow shorter,
<br />I can show you I'll be the one.
<br /><br />I will never let you fall. 
<br />I'll stand up with you forever.
<br />I'll be there for you through it all. 
<br />Even if saving you sends me to heaven.
<br /><br />'Cause you're my, you're my, 
<br />My true love, my whole heart.
<br />Please don't throw that away.
<br />'Cause I'm here... for you!
<br />Please don't walk away and,
<br />Please tell me you'll stay!
<br /><br />Whoa
<br />Stay!
<br />Whoa
<br /><br />Use me as you will!
<br />Pull my strings just for a thrill!
<br />And I know I'll be okay,
<br />Though my skies are turning grey! 
<br /><br />I will never let you fall!
<br />I'll stand up with you forever!
<br />I'll be there for you through it all,
<br />Even if saving you sends me to heaven!
<br /><br />I will never let you fall!
<br />I'll stand up with you forever!
<br />I'll be there for you through it all,
<br />Even if saving you sends me to heaven

<br /><br />Only through struggle have I found rest
<br />With a piece of me taken away
<br />I begin to understand
<br />Hollow out this machine like chest
<br />With it's gears that turn to make me feel assembled
<br />As I fade away
<br /><br />Only through struggle have I found rest
<br />Only through struggle have I found rest
<br /><br />Remove from me
<br />This deception that I called love
<br />That I called love
<br /><br />With it's gears that turn to make me feel assembled
<br />As I fade
<br />I fade away
<br /><br />Remove from me (Remove from me)
<br />This deception (This deception)
<br />That I called love (That I called love)
<br />That I called love
<br /><br />Only through struggle have I found rest
<br />With a piece of me taken away
<br />I begin to understand
<br />I begin to understand
<br />I begin to understand

<br />Here from the wild dream come true
<br />Feast like a sultan I do on treasures and flesh - never few
<br /><br />But I, I would wish it all away if I thought I'd lose you, just one day
<br /><br />The devil and his had me down in love with the dark side I'd found, dabbling all the way down; up to my neck, soon to drown
<br /><br />But you changed that all for me; lifted me up, turned me 'round
<br />So I...
<br />I...
<br />I...
<br />I...
<br />I would
<br />I would
<br />I would wish this all away
<br /><br />Prayed like a martyr dusk 'til dawn
<br />Begged like a hooker all night long
<br />Tempted the devil with my song
<br />And got what I wanted all along
<br /><br />But I...
<br />And I would
<br />If I could, then I would wish it away, wish it away, wish it all away
<br />Wanna wish it all away
<br />No pressure could hold, sway, or justify my kneeling away my center
<br /><br />So if I could I'd wish it all away, if I thought tomorrow would take you away
<br />You're my peace of mind, my home, my center
<br />I'm just trying to hold on one more day
<br /><br />Jambi I...
<br />Jambi I...
<br /><br />Dim my eyes if they should compromise our fulcrum
<br />Wants and need, divide me, then I might as well be gone
<br /><br />Shine on forever
<br />Shine on, benevolent sun
<br /><br />Shine down upon the broken
<br />Shine until the two become one
<br /><br />Shine on forever
<br />Shine on, benevolent sun
<br />AWESOME SONG BY AN AWESOME BAND
<br /><br />Shine on upon the severed
<br />Shine until the two become one
<br /><br />Divided, I wither away
<br />Divided, I wither away
<br /><br />Shine down upon the many
<br />Light our way, benevolent sun
<br /><br />Breathe in union
<br />Breathe in union
<br />Breathe in union
<br />Breathe in union
<br />Breathe in union
<br />So, as one, survive another day and season
<br /><br />Silence leeches; save your poison
<br />Silence leeches; stay out of my way!

The day that i'm sure changed my life forever she said &quot; i want you to fight for me&quot; and i did but it still wasn't enough. She brought out the best in me and i loved....love her with all my heart. Everyday since has been filled with sorrow. I've mad it a point to let her know exactly how i feel but it gets no reaction, i was sure and sometimes i'm still sure shes the one. Looking back, I wish our last kiss would've lasted longer. That girl has stolen my heart. I've given her all my love yet she gives it to another man.Maybe this was supposed to happen. Maybe I'm mean to be alone for ever. We're born alone we live alone and we die alone. I'm not tryin to seem emo or depressed, i just had to finally get this out and &quot;say it&quot; in a way.
