The mentor of our group is Karen. We went there to eat lunch on Sunday.
<br />  We sat down and looked at the menu then I ordered Seafood Ju rice. It has shrimp, imitated crab meat, sea fish and some mushrooms. I waited for a long time at least twenty-five minutes to get my food and I asked the waiter a cup of water for three times. Because of this, so I think service is not so good.
<br />  My food had a good smell and I can’t wait try it. It is called rice ju but it is different from Chinese rice. It is not very soft like Chinese rice but it tasted good. I like this taste, it is not strange and I think it is suitable for Chinese people.
<br />The environment in Seecros is grate. It is clean for sure; there are some green plants beside the front door. They are fresh and beautiful. The gentle, peaceful and slow background music created a comfortable feeling so I think the atmosphere is nice. There are some other people there like business man and family members and they look very relaxed. Although the service is not so good I will recommend my friends to there because of the food and the environment.

I have done 21 hours volunteer work (7hous per day) for three days there.
<br />   In the old people’s home, .I learned how to take care of old people and communicate with them. I did cleaning for the old people and chatted with them. I learned that how to feed them (because some already blind) and how to give them the shower..I worked there for three days, I know all the old people need one day but I also need to be careful with my work. Sometimes I made a mistake and it will make the worker there unhappy so I have to think about the detail more and try my best to focus on my work.
<br />   I think the most important thing you need to wok there is patience because you need to do so many things for the old people and you cannot complain about it. Also to study from the workers is important too. They worked there for a long time so they are used to it and they know it very well. To watch how they did the work and learn it is the fastest way to succeed.
<br />   After lunch, I talked to some old people there and they become more familiar to me. The communication is so necessary and it made the relationship between the old people and I better. This really makes me very happy because I always think that it is difficult to talk with old people. This is may help me to improve my communication skills to different people. It can help me become more socialize.
<br />  During this process, I think it trains me to be a patient, detail person and to care more about the old people.Although it is tired?but I still felt very happy about it.I think it is worth to do this work to help the old people feel happy and comfortbale.I hope that more  people can pay attention to these old people.I am proud  that I worked for them. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" />

<br />I ordered one New Orleans jambalaya with fresh crab. It is French flavor fry rice and it only costs 35 RMB.I think that is very cheaper than some other restaurants. I love the taste of it very much and I don’t feel strange or uncomfortable with the food. Although I ate Chinese fried rice which is very tasty, this French flavor does not make me feel oily like the Chinese one. It has more vegetations than Chinese one too. The environment in Henry’s Home is good. The lights create a quiet and comfortable feeling so I like the atmosphere there. There are some other Chinese peoples there when we eating. The service is fantastic. They provide free water and it is also free to add drinks. Waiters are all very kind and careful.
<br />I would strongly recommend other people to eat at Henry’s Home for its delicious food, comfortable atmosphere, good service and cheap price.

<br />I choose Christian because I want to know about this western religion so I won’t feel unfamiliar when I am aboard.
<br />The worker gave us a leaflet and it is the introduction about the service. During that time, I was sitting in the church and listening to the person to talking. I followed him and read the leaflet .Actually, I am not really understood what he is talking about but I can feel the feeling in the church was quiet and peaceful. It is like another world and you do not need to be worried and afraid. They also sang a extol song together and the whole church was full of the sound of singing. 
<br />After this, my mom and I went to see the workers and my mom asked some information about the service in church. They are all friendly to us and give us a card about the church.
<br />I don’t think this is very interesting but it makes me know a little about Christianity and I think it is relaxing when I sitting in the church and make my heart clean.

I choose this activity because I never make western food by myself so I want to try it. That was really fun!
<br />  First, we went to the supermarket to buy some materials like chopsticks and a pot. After cleaning these things, we began to make our egg tart.
<br />  We used many things like eggs, butter, salt, sugar, milk, etc.During that time, I felt very interesting. We mixed egg and milk to make the center of the tart. It should be only the yolk inside the egg; we need to use the shell to get the yolk. It is a difficult thing for us but we done it successfully.
<br />  At last, we put it in to the oven. When it was heating, I can smell the smell and I can not wait to open it. The food is not very “beautiful” but I think it is a great success for me. 
<br />This is not only interesting but also improving my cooking skills. I hope that I can cook more western food so I can cook by myself when go to the university aboard.

<br />  I choose this because I can sell the things I do not need to someone who wants it and I can buy things I want very cheap. That is killing two birds in one stone. My mom and I carried a lot of books that I bought before, some hair clips and dolls to the flea market to sell. We put a tablecloth on the ground and put all of tings on the tablecloth then started to sell. 
<br />Actually, things are sold faster than what I expected. Many parents bought books from ours because they thought these books have good qualities and also very cheap. There is a boy who wants the book called “The Records about Insects” but he does not have enough money so he used a notebook to exchange. I felt happy too that he can get the book he likes.
<br />  We got 80RMBs from this market. I know that it is not a lot but I really had a good time there. We joined in this market not only sell things and get money but also to help others. This is activity was meaningful.

I went there with my mom.
<br />Before the concert began, my mom and I ate in this restaurant and I was so lucky to saw jil caplan practicing and preparing for the concert. I asked her for a photo and she is so kind. I choose this concert because Jil Caplan is one of my favorite singers in France.
<br />  At 7:00pm, the concert started.Jil and a man with a guitar and another man with electric bass standing on the stage. Most of the songs she sang were French songs but there are still some of them are English songs. Although I do not understand the French language, I can understand the music. I clapped my hands and I felt very exciting. I remember that before one song started, she taught all the audiences to sing this song so when she is singing we are singing with her following the melody. It was fantastic! I like it so much. When the concert finished, everyone was shouting “Encore! Encore!” because we do not want finish. That was so impressed.
<br />This concert makes me know more about French music and I am so glad I had a very good time with Jil Caplan.

I really put a lot of efforts in this because I am not very good at sports before. I try my best to do as much as I can every week, and I really get reward. 
<br />   Playing tae kwon do is not only a physical activity but also a test on my stamina. I go to a tae kwon do class every Friday afternoon after class. For me, it is really a big challenge because to play tae kwon do requires a strong body and you can never give up easily. At first, I was not serious to take this class so I almost failed every thing. The coach was dissatisfied with me and if I can not do better I can not take class any more. I have to practice and more hardworking. I felt the pain when I do the flexibility practice but I did not give up .Even though I know that is not easy, I still try my best on every practice.Slowly, the training is not that hard like the beginning. I am used to it and I know that I can do it. I learned a lot of things in tae kwon do class like legs kick; shadowboxing and I can bend over because of the flexibility practicing. I become more confident on sports and more hardworking than before. .By the way, I lose weights because of the activities I done. I am really happy about this. Although I am still not very professional on this, I really try my best and put a lot of efforts. 
<br />   I climb Purple Mountain very often and I become a good climber now. In 2010, I go to the purple mountain with my sister and my mom for about five times. Climbing is a good training to heart and to make it healthier. I climb mountain so many times so I do not feel fired now and it is relax for me. When I arrived the top of the mountain, I feel very comfortable and proud of myself. Climbing mountains and breathe deeply on the mountain is a really good way to relax and also do physical activity.
<br />   Every Sandy ride a bike to have my TOEFL lessons from my home to the place I have classes.
<br />   Overall, I did a lot of physical activities and I become more confident about myself and sports. I was not sure about myself and seldom do sports before, I am glad that I can have the changes and become stronger.

I feel very meaningful and happy to join these activities in different clubs.
<br />On Halloween festival, I worked as a waitress in the coffee shop organized by ACG club and it is one of the most interesting things I expired. The day before the festival, all the club members went to a shop to rent clothes for the next day. We should all dress up like a maidservant. There are so many different kinds of dresses and I have no idea which one is better for me. After a hard time, the club leader chose beautiful one for me and it is suitable for me. The next we were very busy working in the shop because we need to prepare the food, drinks, tables and chairs by ourselves. When the people came in, I feel embarrassing to treat them at the beginning, later on I was used to it and I even don’t have the time to think about this because it was really busy. There were different people came to our coffee shop like students from other schools and teachers too. I was so excited to do this job and know more people in my school when I servicing. I think from this job I can be more active when I see other people and break the ice. That is really a good way to make friends and build the relationship between others.
<br />I spent lots of time in Environment club too. In this club we always do some project about the environment and the way to solve different pollutions .We did the project of light pollution about how it comes, why it is so serious now and how to solve it.
<br />We make the recycle bin by ourselves and put the recycle bins in front of the school gate. The recycle bins have different types. One is paper; one is plastic and also batteries. We made that bin for a long time and I am really had that these materials can be recycled. We listened a speech about the water pollution from an old professor too. He introduced the ways that people treat the polluted water and how to make the water clean again. He said that to make water clean cost a lot of money and energy but we can use the water to water the plants. That is really a good way to protect the environment know a lot of chemistry knowledge in this club, and may be is will be useful in the future.
<br /> I enjoyed the club activities and really build a good friendship with other club members. I learned many knowledge from these clubs too and make myself more interested in club activities. I think that I will join in more clubs later and to do more exciting, meaningful activities in clubs.

<br />   I did a volunteer work on parent-teacher meeting in April; 2010.I did the volunteer work for marketing club and also for the school. That was really a busy time. From 12o’clock at noon, I begin to do this work and until 4 o’ clock in the afternoon. First, I was sent to make sure the queue of parents is in order and do some things for the Science teacher. After the teacher leaving, I was sent to another place which is outside the hall and lead the parents in to the hall so they do not get lost. My friends and I standing outside and beside the hall for over one hour and we need to make ourselves professional and don’t chat with teacher. Last I was sent by the principle and to become a timer of a teacher. The principle did that because to make sure the meeting keep going on, each parent can talk to one teacher for 5 minute so my job is to mention the time for the teacher otherwise, it will be running out of time. 
<br />  I need to be very patient when doing this work because I have to watch my watch all the time and to mention the teacher every five minutes. This can be a useful employability in the future because a lot of works need very patient people to do the careful work.
<br /> I   did a special job in May Day holiday which is to sell and sent newspapers for the store. To sell newspapers seems to be very easy; actually it is a very difficult job. My mission is to sell 30 pieces of newspapers in 3 hours .I thought that was so easy at the beginning, so I just sit there and wait for someone buy it . One hour later, I only sold 6! I felt worried and embarrassing if I can’t sell these newspaper then I made a big decision that to shout and ask the people to buy it. This is really difficult for me because I am not extroversion. I felt shy and even angry when I really did that. A woman saw me and asked” how much”, and then I sold one! This is more quickly and effectively so I become more brave to talk and convincing people to buy it. At last, I only have 4 left. I felt very happy and the shop keeper thinks that too.
<br />  This job was so impressed on me because I would never forget how hard to talk with a stranger and asked him to buy a newspaper. I know conversation skill is a very important skill and sometimes I have to make myself more active to talk to someone I do not know,like selling the newspapers. I hope that I can be more active and improve my conversation skills.

<br />  He always practices his calligraphy in the morning and reads books about art. Then some people will come to store to see the paintings. In the afternoon, he teaches many students calligraphy.
<br />He said that he does not plan to do this job, just because he thinks this should be interesting and he began to do this job and he can’t stop! I asked the qualifications need to do this job and he said that is honest and hardworking. If the person is not honest, his art would not be beautiful. To be an artist need practice every day so if a person who is lazy then he can’t be a successful artist. Last you need to have the sprit to make your art perfect and more close to perfect.
<br />  He said that he really happy he can do the job he good at and he really likes. Sometimes he will be sad too. He said that that if others can not understand what the artist want to express this will be a greatest pity for the artist. Also Chinese character is so many and each dynasty has a different writing. He practices as much as he can and he is not satisfied with himself after writing ten thousand times only one character. He just repeats writing it and never gives up. I can see that he has a high request for himself.
<br />He said that he is so happy that he can has the improvement on calligraphy and this is a self-satisfied. He also feels proud when his students get the reward and do better. He showed me one piece of working his student wrote I thought that was so fantastic and it doesn’t seems like a student’s work but looks so professional and beautiful. The student is in grade 4 from primary school that was so surprised.
<br />  He feels that to be a good artist can’t just follow others but also need to be creative. He thinks a person need to have many teachers and learned many good things then keep it for him. You can not follow everything teacher teaches you.
<br />  Last, I asked about his favorite artist. He said is Van Gogh. He thinks that Van Gogh’s work seems difficult and crazy sometimes but he is a real artist because he made a break through. He went beyond himself and that is really admirable.
<br /> During the 20 minutes I interview and saw a real artist from his way of talking and his eyes. I feel the art atmosphere around me. This is really a food time and I really enjoyed my talking to this artist. I hope that I can talk to him again in the future.

<br />  There are many fantastic art working. This exhibition is a small size, and all the artists in this exhibition are from China. There are no crazy drawings like the color field paintings and all of them are portrait
<br />My favorite one is called “The Palace”. It is drawn by Xu Lele and she was born in Nanjing. This is a drawing used paint and pen. There are many curved lines used and wavy lines. I can see a person with a sword and a shield. The painter used much yellow based color in this painting.
<br />   I think this drawing is full of mystery and an old feeling like this painting is from very long time ago. This is painting makes me think of the cruel ruler and he use his power from the sword to control everything in the world. There is a woman under something and seems strange. This drawing reminds me of my tae kwon do training because it gives us a hard and pain feeling. I think that the artist maybe wants to express that the sexism in today’s world because the man has the sword and shield but woman has nothing and need to under the pressure. She maybe wants to tell that the cruel control is in today’s world. Someone still has the power to control many things.
<br />  I like this painting because it gives me an old classical feeling and makes me want to treasure it. The drawing also is my favorite style. I like the old things like history, antique and old books so I really love the feeling of this picture.

Although I did not take many kinds of activities, I think swimming is enough for me. It really trained my body and made me strong some ways.
<br />In July, I began to take my swimming classes on eight o clock at night every day. I still remember my first swimming class. I was so afraid of the water at first and I cannot go to the middle of the pool. I just stayed at the edge of the pool and watching other people.Slowly, I found that I am the only one who is not swimming. My coach noticed and she started to force me to swim and took me in the middle of the pool. The coach told me I have to be brave and to learn how to hold the breath under the water; otherwise, I would never swim. So I calmed down, inhaled, and just put my whole body in the water. After a few minutes, I was floating on the water. It is not that hard as I thought! After that, it is easier for me to learn other movements in class. This swimming class last for fifteen days and I learned the breaststroke and backstroke.
<br />I chose swimming because it can cool me down in the summer and it can train almost every muscle on body. It really can make me stronger and keep fit. It is also good for my lung.
<br />Throughout this experience, I know that I have to be calm and brave when I face a tough problem. To conquer fears is important for the rest of my life because I am always too careful and I don’t like to try the things I am not sure. I know I am timid sometimes, but I need to overcome my fears and I have to be brave. To swim can train me this way. To exploring the unknown need this spirit.. hope this quality can be helpful in the rest of my life.
<br /> (I already uploaded my pictures and a video.)

It is on the mountain Jiuhua and I went there with my mother. I chose this temple to do a religious service because it left me an impression when last time I went to Jiuhua Mountain. 
<br />  My mom and I arrived there at 8AM. The name of this temple grabs my attention. Xuanzang is the eminent monk in the novel called Journey to the West. Inside the temple, there is a figure of Buddha and that is the Xuanzang monk. He is too kind and he even can’t kill the ant, I respect him. A Buddhist service should include burning incense and pray. The proper way to burn the incense, your left hand must on the top and right hand at the bottom and turn the body toward east, south, west and north. We bought the incense and burn it outside the hall and put it in the censer. Then we entered the hall and kowtow to Xuanzang, the figure of Buddha. When kowtowing, I made a wish inside my heart and I hope that will come true. 
<br />  The service did not take a very long time. I prefer to this kind of service because it is simple and easy to perform. Buddhism was originated from china so it is a native Chinese religion. Compare to a service in church, this kind of service is suitable for me and I felt comfortable about the service process of burning incense. It is a traditional service of Buddhism and I am familiar with it.

The Christmas show was held by our school which is the Grand Canadian Academy. We put a lot of effort in this performance and we learned from this performance.
<br />   The story is written by some of my classmates and me. We took the idea from different people and then add to a short story. I am not the leading role of this show; instead, I was acting as a funning beggar on the street. The main plot of our story is that a boy met a beautiful girl and he is in love with her. Then, he bought flowers and waited for her because he wanted to tell the girl that he loves her, but the girl refused him. Until the end, the girl accepted him. The story is simple but we put a lot of time on the detailed things. Almost every day, we would do some practice on the show. We prepared a lot, like the materials  like guitar, clothes and the music background. There are three songs we needed and we need to cut the song and construct the three songs into one piece. The time for a song is settled, so we need to practice to match the time.
<br />   On the perform day, our humorous acting won the laughter of audiences. It is memorable to act with classmates and I think the process of practicing is also very meaningful.

I lived in Shanghai for two days so we can see more pavilions on the expo. Although the weather is not pleasant from Agu26 to Agu27, we did visit lots of Pavilions. The reason I went to Expo is that it is too famous and I would like to see this exhibition held in China.
<br />  The first day is a hot, sunny day. We visit the pavilion of Thailand on the first day. The line is too long and it took us three hours to get inside. I remember one thing about the Thailand Pavilion. That is its smell. When you watch a movie inside the pavilion, it sprays some kind of atomizer and it smells really mysterious and unique. It is not like the perfume in the shop, whereas, a fresh smell. I think I would never forget that smell.
<br /> On the second day, we visited other pavilions. The Turkish Sticky ice cream disappointed me. It is sweet and I can’t feel cooler when eating the ice cream, instead of cooler, it made me feel hotter. Then, we went to the US pavilion and saw the 3D movie inside. I love that movie because it is very creative and it talks about protecting environment. 
<br />  Overall, I found this visit of Shanghai Expo very interesting. I found a lot of special stuff of different countries on the expo. I am glad that I could come to see this great exhibition.

The performance is from 8PM to 10PM. I went there with my friend, Rosella and my mom. I choose this concert because I am a fan of Scott who is the singer from America. I heard of him when I was in junior high school so I really want to see his performance.
<br />  If you give Scott a guitar and a space, he would make his own music. From this performance I could see this point. The bar is loud, but Scott could sing like nothing beside him. He sang the quiet songs with a guitar, but he can grab people’s eyes. Most of his songs were written by himself so he is really talented. 
<br />   I love the performance very much. Although the environment of a bar is not good, I listened all his song from the beginning to the end. All the songs were done by him and guitar and that’s his style, that’s his way. His voice adds points to his songs. The songs are all soft and give a comfortable feeling. His music can really make me calm down and think of important things. This is why I am a fan of him and this is why his music attracts people.
<br />   I love his music very much so I asked him for a picture. 
<br />     Here are the pictures of Scott and me ~
<br /><br />(I uploaded 1 video of Scott from the performance.)

My Physical exercise can be divided into four parts: Skating club’s activity, my tennis class, ride a bike to school and climb Purple Mountain. Some of these are regular, like I ride a bike to school and go home on workdays of the week. The tennis class is also regular. I take tennis class every Saturday afternoon. The skating and climbing are irregular and I do these activities from time to time.
<br />   First, I will talk about my tennis class. The class was started in November, 2010. First few classes were about the swing path of a racket, I practiced the swing path more than three thousand times in total. Sounds silly, but to be familiar with a correct way to swing a racket is crucial. My coach said that to remember it by your body and to be used to the action of. Another important thing is that to warm up is absolutely necessary for tennis class. If you don’t warm up your body properly, you would have muscle spasm. After a few classes, the coach started to teach me how to serve a ball. It is too difficult for me and the ball I serve couldn’t pass the net. I have to be concentrated before I serve a ball. Then, I practice the action for hundreds of times. In order to serve a good ball, I have to be stubborn and I can’t easily give up. After the practice of five classes, I finally can serve a ball beautifully. Playing tennis is a way to train my body and mentally. I have to be unremitting and keep practicing, and then I may play tennis well.
<br />   The exercise of riding a bike is the every day physical activity for me. Since my mom bought me a bike in March, I started to ride a bike to school and go home. Every morning, I will ride a bike through Beijing East Road and the traffic is terrible in the morning. The cars drive on the slow-traffic lane so it is very crowded and dangerous to ride a bike on the Beijing East Road. To eliminate the chance of being crashed by another one or crash on someone, I need to be” self-effacing”. That meanings, don’t ride a bike too quickly, otherwise, it is hard to brake. Let others go; don’t squeeze with them because it is easy to get accident. Riding a bike on crowded Beijing East Road is a way to practice my quick reaction too.
<br />  Last, I will talk about skating and climbing the Purple Mountain. I climb Purple Mountain by the footstep and I never climb the mountain through big way because it is too easy and that can’t reach my foal of exercising. Climbing through the footsteps is like climbing a building with 300 floors. It is tiring but I enjoy the feeling of reaching the peak. Although it is tiring, it bought a felling of satisfaction. That is the feeling of succeed.( I uploaded a video from my tennis class.)

<br />  The environment in the restaurant is comfortable and the service is satisfactory. I ordered spaghetti with tomato sauce because I think that Italian pasta is hard to eat it all, so I ordered a sour flavor. The food is actually normal. There is no specific thing I could remember for the food so it is pretty normal flavor. The environment of the restaurant is quiet and pleasant so I still recommend people to go there.
<br /> I also went to a western restaurant in Hong Kong called “Euro Go Go” on May 8, 2011. This restaurant is located at Langham Place. I went there with my friend Lucia and my mom. The environment in that restaurant is comfortable too. I ordered Garlic Mussel with Cheese Sauce. I chose this because the picture of the food beside looks very delicious. The first bite of the mussel is magic. It surprised me because its tastes very good. The pasta and the cheese match very well with each other and I really love this dish. The service here is not that pleased like the food because the waiter didn’t say a word to us. I think the service attitude is bad.

For example, I am one of the organizers of service club and one of the active members in tutor club and cooking club. I also joined a sports club which is skating club, but I decided to count the time from that club for my physical activities. I enriched my after-school activities this year because I joined so many clubs.
<br />  The first club I would like to talk about is Tutor club. This is the club that I put the most time among all the clubs I joined in. Tutor club is different from other clubs because there is no fun activity. The only thing I can do as a tutor in this club is teaching. In term1 and term2, I tutored grade10 student for Science almost every Thursday after school. In order to let my tutee learn from this small class, I need to prepare the class that is what I am going to teach. Every Wednesday, I would write down the key points of tomorrow’s class. I also need to be patient when I am teaching. If tutee can’t understand properly, I would explain to him again. It is also important to be efficient. The time is limited, so the problems should be solved during the time of the class. I slowly become more efficient and patient through the tutoring program.
<br /><br />Another club that I put a lot of effort in is the service club. I organized a service work in Nanjing Orphanage and the nursing home for the elderly in November. I contacted the people in the orphanage and the nursing home. There are too many organizations coming to orphanage at the weekend so it is very important to advance a reservation and then we need to wait for our turn to visit. Before we visit the old people in the nursing home, we bought some fruits. When we get there, we gave the fruits to grandpas and grandmas. Sometimes, we can even chat with them. The memory of visiting the orphanage is very impressive. Before I enter the door of the orphanage, I never think of the children are living behind a glass from us. When we walked inside, there was a big glass that isolates the children from us. At that moment, I started to notice that the things I could do for them is obviously not enough. I hope I could help these people and that’s why I joined service club. Joining in service club is not only a way to improve communication skills with adults but also sympathy for the children. Although the help from our club is not enough, we tried our best to help.
<br />  The last club left is cooking club. I took part in a activity of making cookies. That’s my first time to make cookies by myself. When I made the cookies, I concentrated on shapes of them. My cookies looks delicious after taking from the oven so I am really happy about that.

It is a Sunday and we arrived there at 9 AM in the morning. After register, the administrative staff let us work in the area of Chinese literature. Then, we began our work of a whole day.
<br /> The workers from that area asked us to “clean up” the area of magazine. Basically, our job is to put the magazines in order on the shelves. The work sounds easy but it is actually hard to finish. There are about twenty shelves of magazines. Magazines are not like books, they are thin and hard to classify them. Although the shelves have order, it is a tough job to put a lost magazine to where it should be. At first, I was totally confused by the number on the shelves. There is no sequence I could find from one to another, so it took me about ten minutes to put a magazine back to where it should be. I figured out this method is ineffective, so I started from the first shelve with a plain trolley which can put the lost magazine on it.  While arranging the magazines on the shelves, I picked up the magazines that put in the wrong place. The lost magazines were put on my trolley one by one. When I move to another shelf, I could put the magazines back to the right place if I was lucky. Sometimes, the numbers on the magazine does not exist on the shelf and that is frustrated because I can’t find the right place to put it back. I didn’t realize it is lunchtime until the worker told me. The work is half done and we need to complete in the afternoon.
<br />  We came back half an hour later and the worker gave us a new job. Put the new publication (magazines) on the shelves. The new publications are easy to find their number on the shelves but the amount of these magazines is big. This type of work forces me to work quickly and to be effective; otherwise, I can’t finish my work in a certain time. In order to be effective, Rosella and I need to collaborate. If two people looking for something on the book shelves at the same time, it is much easier to find. At 5PM, we finished our work and I found my hands turned black because of the dust on the magazines.
<br />  From this work, I improved my ability to classify things and the rate cleaning up things by myself. I also practiced my eye to search for things. I am sure this experience would help me in organizing things and coming up with a better plan as a team.

Before, I thought a job as waitress is one of the simplest job available. I found serving as a waitress is not as easy as I had. My experience is a significant step in my life and has helped me learn to work with people around me.
<br />The work time is from 8 a.m. to 9 p.m. I need to work for two weeks so it is really a challenge for me. First day, I woke up at 6 a.m. and started to prepare for my work. Another reason I woke up so early is I was too excited and anxious. After arriving at the restaurant, I got the unified dress for waitress and a pair of high-heeled shoes. The basic work for me is to open the door for clients then find a suitable seat for them and also ask them what they want to eat from the menu. Sounds pretty easy, actually, I messed up a lot of things. There was one thing very impressive, I was asked to carry out a plate of big fish which was just cooked and hot from the kitchen to the table, wearing the high-heeled shoes. I walked slowly and carefully, afraid of felling over .Although I am not good at this yet, I finished the mission. The first day after work, I felt very tired. I thought if I keep working like this, I will burn out, but I also felt pleased because I enriched my holiday.
<br />First three days, I kept studying manners, working attitude, and diction from other waitresses because they are more sophisticated, hoping I could be more professional.  I became more natural to treat clients in the second week than the first week. Most of the time, I could promote some special dishes in the restaurant for costumers depending on the age of them. Smiling is also important when serving. If you look awful and unhappy, there would be no one who is willing to have a great meal in your restaurant. One time, I met a man and he asked a lot of impolite things. There demands irritated me in some ways but I can’t show my unhappy outside. I finished all his requests politely and I didn’t complain a word. At last, he said that my service is thoughtful and praised my job attitude. Suddenly, I felt all my efforts are worth. It is pleasant that I can make these progresses in two weeks.
<br />After two weeks, my work came to an end. All the resent, hard work and effort in the two weeks finally elapsed. I was surprised that I could do the job successfully. I learnt a lot during the time, like how to treat people properly and be positive to all the tasks before me. This work experience helped me gain courage and be more confident to deal with other things in my life.

Nanjing museum is closed to my home so my mother and I walked there. The first reason I went to see this exhibition is that it is closed to my home. The second reason is I can see different types of art work from different artists at the same time.
<br />  The exhibition hall was decorated beautifully. As I enter the hall, there was a big poster of the exhibition with title of it. On the entrance, there was also calligraphy of title of the exhibition. The angle of light is good for showing the texture of a painting and the light make the quality of paintings looks better. This exhibition includes oil painting, pencil sketch, calligraphy and Chinese traditional painting. The theme of these art works is not unified. Some are landscape paintings, some are portrait painting. A few of paintings I can’t tell what the artists are drawing because the pictures are too abstract for me.
<br />  I found two pieces of work that interested me. One is an oil painting called “The Youth”. This picture grabbed my eyes among lots of art works because its bright color and the young ladies on the picture. It is showing that a group young lady are preparing for a costume ball. They all look youthful and gorgeous. The artist use different color to show the light intensity so it appears like a beam of spot light highlighting the girls. This kind of intensive way of showing the color leaves me a deep impression. Another picture I found very fun is also an oil painting. I don’t remember the name of the picture but I remember the content. It is a western girl sitting on a chair playing the Pipa which is the Chinese traditional instrument. The painting shows the harmony of a combination of western and eastern culture. I think the western girl matches the instrument very well. From the picture, I think the artist tried to show the western recognition of Chinese culture and the harmonious relationship between the two cultures.
<br />  This collection of art works seems interesting for me. I watched a lot of great art work at the same time and communicated with the artists through their paintings. A picture is not only a way of showing of artistic ability, but also a way to convey a person’s thought. Some artists show the wish of laboring people through a picture of them working very hard. Some satirical drawings indicate the corruption in nowadays society by a picture indirectly. This exhibition is aesthetic. It strengthens my knowledge and perspective on art and culture. I enjoyed this visit of exhibition very much.
<br /> (This exhibition is free, so it doesn’t have ticket. I bought some souvenirs from the exhibition.)

The exhibition was held at Jiangsu Provincial Art Museum. The reason I go to this exhibition is that Professor Su is my calligraphy teacher’s friend and my teacher recommended me to see his art work and to read the poems he wrote.
<br />  Inside the museum, there are lots of Chinese paintings and calligraphy works hanging on the wall. There are different types of Professor Su’s art work. Some are just Calligraphy but some are beautiful paintings with poems beside. These poems are the written by professor Su, so he is not only an artist, but also a poet. Most of his paintings are plants like flowers and bamboos and he also love to draw birds. I could understand the personality of professor Su through his work. His writing is powerful and vigorous, that’s his style. The poems he wrote show his attitude for life. Basically, he encourages us to slow down and enjoy small things in our lives. It is a simple and unadorned positive feeling about living.
<br />   The most impressive work is calligraphy about a pine tree. The poem simply means a pine tree standing at the cliff can’t be easily bent. This tree experienced a lot just like professor Su himself. This pine tree is a metaphor and the pine tree is professor Su. My teacher told me that professor Su experienced the Great Cultural Revolution. He suffered terribly during that time of revolution and he met lots of obstacles. These challenges did not perform like hinders, instead, give him the courage to confront the problems. Isn’t he the pine tree on the cliff? I do admire his spirit to be brave when something blocks him so I love this poem. His vigorous hand writing also reflects his personality. The poem matches his experience, giving a recalcitrant appearance of pine tree and courage inside. It is brilliant!
<br />  I like this exhibition. From this exhibition, I can learn the skills of calligraphy and also appreciate deeply from the poems that professor Su wrote. The picture in his poem is vivid in my head so he is good at describing things. Professor Su is successful because he Inherited excellent traditional culture and did some creation on his own. Those who are inflexible could not achieve real success. Professor Su learned from the traditional way of calligraphy but he did not copy from that. His writings, poems and paintings have his own style, not stereotype. 
<br />   He rejoices with the book and he is broad-minded. From his poems, I can see that he faces life with a simile. He is not utilitarian. Although he retired, he still writes his poems and draws his pictures. “Knowledge is boundless.” That is his attitude and he is always humble. His indifferent to fame and wealth and unremitting are the reasons he achieved success. I don’t think I can reach his height now, but his spirit and attitude are valuable for me to learn.
