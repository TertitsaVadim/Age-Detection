<br /><br />Yes, it is absolutely possible to become wealthy even in today’s economy and you can start right now with a Savings Highway Membership. I’d recommend joining at a Gold Level because it offers you the most Savings, Bonuses, and Commissions. As a Gold member, you can earn up to $40,000 a month plus bonuses, of course that totally depends on how motivated you are but Gold is for serious income earners. You may also choose from a Silver or Bronze Membership, however, Gold provides the most potential income for you and your family.
<br /><br />Before I get too carried away, I want to tell you that by joining <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2FuZ2llbWl0Y2hlbGwudGhlc2F2aW5nc2hpZ2h3YXljbHViLmNvbQ__" target="_blank">Savings Highway</a>  you are not “selling” anything. This is a savings and earnings program, we do not try to sell people things they do not need or want. We offer people the opportunity to save money on the things the need or purchase anyway such as dining out, entertainment, shopping, dental, vision, roadside, legal, x-rays, prescription savings, groceries and so much more.
<br /><br />I invite you to check out my website for a list of services and benefits offered to you as a member and to those you will be helping to become wealthy as well. Who would have thought that we can all retire early and save money at the same time?
<br /><br />Since almost everyone wants to save money and make extra income, offering these savings is an easy thing to do especially with a program like Savings Highway. The faster you help people and the more people you introduce, the faster you can become wealthy and retire early.
<br /><br />Let me show you your money making potential as a Gold Member

		<document id="f2d5cf94ad535e7c2710571dfb0ad960" url=""><![CDATA[Earn Residual Income | Savings Highway | Angie Mitchell<br/><br/>A lot of people out there are looking to learn how to “cash in” when it comes to earning a <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RoZXNhdmluZ3NoaWdod2F5Y2x1Yi5zYXZpbmdzaGlnaHdheS5jb20_" target="_blank">residual income</a> .
<br /><br />Network marketing has exploded and it is not surprising to me at all. This industry is great and more importantly the Internet is helping boost its popularity. There are no special skills that can’t be learned as-you-go and if you’ve never done something like this before you will learn alot. It’s a process and who knows, it may become your passion like it has for me, my only regret is that I never started sooner.
<br /><br />The downside is that a lot of people fail because when they don’t make a large amount of money right away they quit, trust me, this will take time and effort on your part if your goal is to earn a residual income.
<br /><br />If someone told you “it’s easy, you will be making $5,000 or $10,000 in no time, RUN!” Often times people who don’t see immediate success blame the companies, their upline, the product or service when they should be blaming themselves.
<br /><br />I chose <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RoZXNhdmluZ3NoaWdod2F5Y2x1Yi5zYXZpbmdzaGlnaHdheS5jb20_" target="_blank">Savings Highway</a>  as my vehicle to earning a residual income because it’s a stable company with integrity that offers real value and savings to real people just like me. Sure, it hasn’t happened overnight but I feel pretty darn good about promoting a program that the “average Joe” can really sink their teeth into and that’s important!
<br /><br />Look, there is no easy way to earn a residual income with any program that you decide to get involved with. Sure, after you begin to promote it and get the hang of it, make some sales it may seem easy. But it does take some work to get to this point.
<br /><br />Most people who find a way to earn a residual income from their home with the internet is that once you find one program and become successful with it, then and only then should they look to find another. Some are so desperate to make money they end up dropping alot of cash trying with different programs and they end up spreading themselves too thin. You are better off in getting the skills and training to learn how to earn an income such as this and FOCUS, FOCUS, FOCUS ON ONLY ONE!!!
<br /><br />You can eventually have multiple streams of residual income that allow you to put in some hard work at the beginning and see dividends in the form of passive income for months or even years to come. It’s not being lazy, it’s being SMART!
<br /><br />My Earning Residual Income <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RoZXNhdmluZ3NoaWdod2F5Y2x1Yi5zYXZpbmdzaGlnaHdheS5jb20_" target="_blank">Opportunity</a>

<br /><br />Do you feel that your future is destined to bill payments and maxing out credit cards? Are you living from pay check to pay check struggling to get ahead? There is another path...you can have financial freedom and start earning <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy4xMnBhdGguY29tL1NIU29jaWFsLmh0bWw_" target="_blank">residual income</a>  working from home.
<br /><br />Perhaps you’ve heard about what you can do to become financially free, but you don’t know how to go about achieving it. I like to give you my opinion on the subject. Financial freedom is not only possible, but very achievable by average people just like you and I, even in this volatile economy. All you have to have is the desire to make your dreams a reality. Often times we can be just plain lazy and keep putting things off till tomorrow and the problem with that is tomorrow never comes.
<br /><br />First of all, have you ever considered a legitimate online home based business? If not, why? This is in some cases, a low cost entrepreneurial business opportunity for you, where you can earn a <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy4xMnBhdGguY29tL1NIU29jaWFsLmh0bWw_" target="_blank">residual income</a>  for years to come and make financial freedom attainable.
<br /><br />There are so many advantages to working from home… freedom, choice, flexibility (especially with childcare), the opportunity to do something you’ve always wanted to do, to live a more balanced life and of course, earn a residual income.
<br /><br />Being able to take advantage of the tax breaks is a real plus, you can deduct a part of your home’s operating and depreciation expenses as business expenses. This can be a percentage of your mortgage, property taxes, insurance, utilities, and/or the expenses of household maintenance. Are you starting to see the big picture? You could be SAVING thousands every year just for having a legitimate home based business.
<br /><br />Network marketing is an excellent business model to achieve financial freedom because you can create residual income. This just means you are going to get paid in the future for work you’re doing right now and an online home based business is perfect for that.
<br /><br />Now that you're starting to really consider this option, what kind of business are you looking to promote? The latest and greatest miracle juice, the best ever live till you’re a thousand health care products? (Trust me, I’ve done it and it’s a hard sell, especially in today's economy!) For me it was like trying to sell a steak to a vegetarian. There was no income coming in, never mind <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy4xMnBhdGguY29tL1NIU29jaWFsLmh0bWw_" target="_blank">residual income</a> !
<br /><br />I'd suggest joining a Program/Company that’s honest, cares about the &quot;average Joe&quot; and more importantly, one that going to offer others you'll be promoting to, some real value.
<br /><br />Think about this....What do most people want? People want to save money and people want to make money.
<br /><br />I'm very thankful for finding Savings Highway because it allows me to do just that. Save money, make money, offer others real value and make residual income on top of it. As I continue to build my organization, and promote my savings and earnings program, my <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy4xMnBhdGguY29tL1NIU29jaWFsLmh0bWw_" target="_blank">residual income</a>  will keep growing becoming quite significant.
<br /><br />I can’t quite believe it sometimes...but we are getting paid to save money and help others save money! Who woulda thunk it? There is no catch, you can build your business as quickly or slowly as you like and be on your way to financial freedom and earning a residual income.
<br /><br />It is my mission to educate people and bring savings, success and financial freedom everywhere!

		<document id="10d22032ecea163ffdccc5251577ffdf" url=""><![CDATA[Bring Home the Residual Income Bacon | Angie Mitchell<br/><br/>I’m not against earning some good, honest, “one-shot” linear income, but given a choice, which would you rather do: work hard and get paid only once, through linear income, or get paid continuously - perhaps for years or even the rest of your life - for hard work you perform only once, through <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3Jlc2lkdWFsaW5jb21lLnRoZXNhdmluZ3NoaWdod2F5Y2x1Yi5jb20_" target="_blank">residual income</a> ?
<br /><br />Linear income is directly proportional to the number of hours invested in it (40 hrs. of pay for 40 hrs. of work), but one of the great advantages of residual income is that once the ball starts rolling, you continue making money from your initial efforts, while gaining time to devote to other things… such as spending more time with your family or perhaps generating more streams of <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3Jlc2lkdWFsaW5jb21lLnRoZXNhdmluZ3NoaWdod2F5Y2x1Yi5jb20_" target="_blank">residual income</a> !
<br /><br />There are many different businesses models to choose from. The key is to learn how to make money off of other people’s labor as well, rather than trying to do it all on your own. Likely it may not happen right off the bat but it will come with a little effort and dedication on your part. Note that leveraged income may or may not be residual income… when you combine them, that’s even better.
<br /><br />Now is the time to think about how to apply this in your business. How could you make money off the work of others? As for me, I chose to promote a recession proof Savings and Earnings Program that offers the opportunity to save money on daily purchases such as gas and groceries and in turn offer the same benefits to others. When people join the program I start making <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3Jlc2lkdWFsaW5jb21lLnRoZXNhdmluZ3NoaWdod2F5Y2x1Yi5jb20_" target="_blank">residual income</a> .
<br /><br />The sooner you answer these questions, the sooner you’ll have financial and personal freedom.
<br /><br />Although taking care of your children is a job you gladly do for the joy of being with them, it doesn’t exactly pay the bills. But in order to stay afloat these days, most households need both parents to have a job. For stay at home moms and dads, exchanging time with their children for time in a cubicle is an unappealing trade.
<br /><br />Luckily the technology available today is making it possible for parents to work from home. Computers, combined with the power of the internet, have opened up a slew of opportunities to be able to bring home the residual income bacon while taking care of young children. Whether you are looking for part time work or need to replace lost income.
<br /><br />Ultimately, the best job for stay at home moms or dads is the job they design for themselves by owning their own home based business. As a home based business owner, you get to be in charge of your time and your income. If done right, your initial investment of hard work could even lead to years of <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3Jlc2lkdWFsaW5jb21lLnRoZXNhdmluZ3NoaWdod2F5Y2x1Yi5jb20_" target="_blank">residual income</a> . Meaning you’d be able to take a trip to the Bahamas and still get paid.
<br /><br />For stay at home moms and dads, I have done the research and found the perfect opportunity that lets you make money and save money while giving you that freedom you want to spend time with your family. All it takes is a click to get started on the road towards achieving your dreams and start enjoying the “<strong>residual income bacon</strong>” we’d all love to have.

<br /><br />Today I'm going to focus stricktly on the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy4xMnBhdGguY29tL0Jsb2dnZXIuaHRtbA__" target="_blank">email autoresponders</a> .
<br /><br />This is where you will create new messages and edit current messages for any of your autoresponder lists. You can also add letter templates and edit letter templates.
<br /><br />New Autoresponder Message: After you have setup your mailing list, one of the next steps is to create your actual <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy4xMnBhdGguY29tL0Jsb2dnZXIuaHRtbA__" target="_blank">email autoresponders</a> . Remember that messages are list specific so if you have 10 different mailing lists, you can have 10 different autoresponder message series, although you can use the same messages in all your lists if you're promoting the same thing and you just want to test different advertising.
<br /><br />When you click on the new autoresponder message link, you will come to a page where you can fill in your messages, choose one of the ready made templates, setup your message delivery options, add attachments to your messages and basically get your messages ready to go make you money.
<br /><br />View/Edit Autoresponder: Once you have setup your <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy4xMnBhdGguY29tL0Jsb2dnZXIuaHRtbA__" target="_blank">email autoresponder</a>  messages, there might be times you want to edit and update those messages and the View/Edit feature allows you to easily accomplish this task. You can edit any part of your autoresponder from this one simple interface.
<br /><br />Add Letter Template: While you have access to dozens of fresh and professional letter templates in your autoresponder setup section, we also realize you might want to create your own and if you do, you click on the Add Letter Template link and use the editor to create your own professional looking templates.
<br /><br />View/Edit Letter Templates: Just as you can edit everything in all other parts of the email autoresponders, you also get this ability with your own templates that you have created. The View/Edit letter template is the place to go for this and all edits are done in real time so you never miss an opportunity.
<br /><br />You can review the entire 12 Second Commute system absolutely FREE for a full 30 days. There is NO credit card required to get your account and if you decide that 12SC is not for you, you simply cancel your account within 30 days or do nothing and it will delete for you after the 30th day.

The same is true for an internet business and generating a stream of residual income. We all know why we want residual income - so we can travel, spend time with our families and generally do the things we want.
<br /><br />Starting your own internet business is one of those things where your initial investment of time will not be rewarded very well at all, but as you keep at it, you WILL eventually be paid for every minute of the time you put in, and paid very well.
<br /><br />A lot of people have the delusion belief that things have already peaked with the internet, but this couldn’t be any further from the truth. In fact… things are just beginning. As the economic growth continues, more and more people are discovering the internet for the first time. All these people that were never part of the .com boom now want in. That being said, it’s a very good time to get your piece of the pie.
<br /><br />Networking marketing has become one of the most popular ways of earning residual income. However, due to constant management and business planning issues, this form of marketing is also considered as one of the riskiest techniques. Pick ONLY reputable companies that offer quality training and that show proven growth.
<br /><br />There are knowledgeable people with years of experience willing to show you the way and lead by example. They can show you how to earn a residual income. Heed those who tell you “You’ll make thousands in no time!” because it’s going to take a little while when you first get started but you will be rewarded for your efforts down the road.
<br /><br />You get there by making a promise to yourself - commit to a certain amount of time every day. If you can only spare 30 minutes, turn off the TV and go do it. You’ll be very glad you did.
<br /><br />Great things start with small actions and by being persistent. Ask yourself this; is a chance at earning a residual income worth 30 minutes per day of your time? It all depends on how fast you want to get there.
<br /><br />When I picked my Business Opportunity, I did my research, I gathered information and made a decision to join Savings Highway 2 months later. It’s extremely important to believe in what you are promoting because people are pretty good at sniffing out the “fakers.” Residual income is what you want. Unfortunately, there are many opportunities available that really do an injustice to this concept. So, master the concept of residual income and you’ll master your destiny!
<br /><br />We’ve all heard the story of the gold miner who toiled fruitlessly for a long time before deciding to give up and move on. He makes the decision one day that enough is enough and packs up, selling his claim to a new miner. The new person starts digging and finds the trail of gold almost immediately.
<br /><br />He then gets to spend the rest of his life thinking about “what if…”
<br /><br />The good news is there is still gold to be found and it’s on the internet.
<br /><br />Dig for gold and don’t give up!

In my personal opinion it's a wise choice to purchase a <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy4xMnBhdGguY29tL1BldHNlY3VyZVF1b3Rl" target="_blank">veterinary pet insurance</a>  policy that will help you pay for the costs to get your pet back to a good state of health if either an illness or accident should occur.
<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy4xMnBhdGguY29tL1BldHNlY3VyZVF1b3Rl" target="_blank">Veterinary Pet Insurance</a>  is as important to your pet as medical insurance is to you. Making sure that your animal’s medical needs and veterinary bills are taken care of is of upmost importance. When your pet needs to be rushed over to an animal hospital or vet, the last thing you want to be thinking about is what it is going to cost me? or how am I going to pay for this?
<br /><br />With <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy4xMnBhdGguY29tL1BldHNlY3VyZVF1b3Rl" target="_blank">Petsecure</a>  you can breath a little easier knowing that depending on the plan you choose some or most of your costs will be covered. In you're fur babies moments of need, you can focus on them and not the financial burden facing you.
<br /><br />Of course, a serious accident or illness may never happen – and you certainly hope they won’t, but sometimes they do and I think it’s a good idea to consider right away how you will cope with the situation if an accident or illness does happen. There are a number of good reasons for having dog pet insurance, but the most important one of all is – peace of mind.
<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy4xMnBhdGguY29tL1BldHNlY3VyZVF1b3Rl" target="_blank">Veterinary Pet Insurance</a>  is about what you are willing to spend on your pet, again if you’re like me, you will spend whatever it takes to help your pet. Monthly premiums are nothing compared to the hundreds or thousands of dollars out of pocket you will pay for a sick or injured pet. Sadly, animals do get sick or hurt usually at some point.
<br /><br />Pet insurance is a good option for people who aren’t financially secure, because as we all know vet bills add up fast and I'm talking fast!
<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy4xMnBhdGguY29tL1BldHNlY3VyZVF1b3Rl" target="_blank">Petsecure</a>  is just one of dozens of pet insurance companies, and if you have more specific questions, I'd suggest calling the companies directly. Don’t let any pet insurance salesperson talk you into buying something you are uncomfortable with. Ask tons of questions and take notes. If the policy seems too good to be true, it is.
<br /><br />If you are planning on buying pet insurance, make sure you shop around to find the company that meets your needs and offers the most realistic rates. Don’t just settle for the most popular company or the most-advertised plan.
<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy4xMnBhdGguY29tL1BldHNlY3VyZVF1b3Rl" target="_blank">Click here for a Petsecure free quote</a>

<br /><br />It's silly how we all manage to find the money to buy all of the pet products on the market today, but ignore one major expenditure time after time - pet insurance. You might ask why should I insure my pet? Or do I need a pet insurance plan? Well the answer is obvious when you're faced with an unexpected visit to your vet's office. Whether it is pet insurance for your cat, or pet insurance for your dog you do need some sort of pet insurance plan in place.
<br /><br />Getting &quot;Spot&quot; a pet insurance plan is an after thought for many pet owners, simply because they take a &quot;I'll deal with it when it happens&quot; approach to their animals. If the cost of treatment gets too high, sometimes they choose to have the animal euthanized.
<br /><br />Ahhhhh... but many who think they'd draw the line at a certain price point find themselves wavering when the time actually comes. You know the story - The kids are crying, the vet says a treatment would be successful, and a lot of parents break down and spend the money.
<br /><br />It can be a very emotional situation, I know, I've been in those shoes and I've paid full price out of pocket. OUCH!
<br /><br />If you had a chance to save the life of your pet but money was the decider, you would be devastated that you didn’t look into a pet insurance plan earlier.
<br /><br />If you don't have sufficient savings to cover the treatments, you might consider pet insurance. But do your homework before you buy and ask these questions:
<br /><br />1. Which Deductible Should You Choose? 
<br />2. What are the Policy Limits? 
<br />3. What does the policy cover? What are the available options? 
<br />4. How is Your Reimbursement Calculated when You File a Claim?
<br />5. Can You Choose Any Vet or Are You Restricted to a Network? 
<br />6. Who Determines Your Pet's Treatment? 
<br />7. What is Excluded? 
<br />8. Does the Policy Provide Lifetime Continuous Coverage? 
<br />9. Does Your Veterinarian Recommend the Pet Insurance Company?
<br />10. What Experience Can I Expect? 
<br /><br />I hope that after coming to a conclusion, you will feel better prepared to make an educated choice in choosing a pet insurance plan that best suits your needs.

We shouldn’t have to pay extreme amounts out of pocket, however. Getting the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy4xMnBhdGguY29tL2Jlc3RpbnN1cmFuY2VwZXQ_" target="_blank">best pet insurance</a>  coverage you can afford can help pay the vet bills for the things that tend to happen to our pets, like gastric torsion! After reading the horror stories below of pet owners, you’ll no doubt be thinking about purchasing pet insurance soon if you haven’t already.
<br /><br />1. Everything was going just dandy for Virginia Jackson and her 4-year-old Rottweiler, Nigel when suddenly he needed emergency surgery for gastric torsion. She explained how difficult it was for her to pay $4,965.60 out of pocket for diagnostics, surgery and treatment. Unlike many other pet owners, however, she was able to breathe easy because she had the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy4xMnBhdGguY29tL2Jlc3RpbnN1cmFuY2VwZXQ_" target="_blank">best pet insurance</a>  she could afford for Nigel. Soon after filing a claim, her pet insurance plan reimbursed her $2,735.10. Otherwise it would have been a very hard pill for her to swallow.
<br /><br />2. Sheena, my lab became suddenly ill. A large bump was discovered in her chest. I scheduled an appointment with her vet… Unexpectedly, I had to leave the office without my angel because the vet informed me that she had a tumor that required immediate removal. Knowing that I had the very <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy4xMnBhdGguY29tL2Jlc3RpbnN1cmFuY2VwZXQ_" target="_blank">best pet insurance</a>  plan was a tremendous relief - I was so distraught at having to leave her that the last thing I needed to worry about was a $1,500.00 bill! Less than 2 weeks later, a cheque arrived from my pet insurance company to reimburse me for every penny! (minus the deductible) I highly recommend others to consider pet health insurance. Pet insurance truly does provide peace-of-mind at a time when all you care about is the safety and health of your beloved pet.
<br /><br />3. Our dogs love to run around our property, however sometimes they come home with cuts and abrasions. It made us wonder what we would do if something more serious happened. We considered pet insurance as recommended by our veterinarian and thought it sounded like a good idea…so we bought the best pet insurance we can afford and well, turns out, it was a great idea! One day Charlie came home vomiting. He had hives and trouble breathing. We were terrified. We rushed him to the veterinarian, who said he must have eaten some type of poison. He was treated immediately and now Charlie is back to his healthy self. It helped knowing that any costs we were to incur were covered by our pet insurance.
<br /><br />Don’t delay until you’re sitting at the veterinarian’s office and it becomes one of those – “would’ve, could’ve, didn’t” situations – insure your pet today and purchase the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy4xMnBhdGguY29tL2Jlc3RpbnN1cmFuY2VwZXQ_" target="_blank">best pet insurance</a>  that fits your budget and rest a little easier knowing that if something does happen – you’ve got coverage.

		<document id="2a4dc33f26bb93f948e60bfdd26a532e" url=""><![CDATA[Veterinary Pet Insurance | Dental Insurance | Petsecure<br/><br/>Did you know you’re 40% more likely to get your pet’s teeth cleaned if you have <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy4xMnBhdGguY29tL3ZldGVyaW5hcnlfcGV0aW5zdXJhbmNl" target="_blank">veterinary pet insurance</a>  that covers it? With Petsecure you do! Use your dental insurance for an annual cleaning or problems with your pet’s teeth and/or gums.
<br /><br />With Petsecure pet health insurance, you can use any licensed veterinarian in Canada and can visit and claim at multiple veterinary clinics – the choice of who should care for your important pet is completely yours. Petsecure offers up to 80% coverage for all approved claims for dog insurance.
<br /><br />Petsecure is a wholly owned and operated Canadian <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy4xMnBhdGguY29tL3ZldGVyaW5hcnlfcGV0aW5zdXJhbmNl" target="_blank">veterinary pet insurance</a>  company which offers pet insurance in Canada. It is one of the largest and oldest companies in the field.
<br /><br />“My cat went in for a routine dentistry, mostly some plaque build up, nothing too serious. My vet had urged me to switch to the new Petsecure from Pet Plan so that the dental would be covered. I was hesitant, thinking they only covered accidents (which my plan didn’t cover, I was on the standard) but I made the switch to Secure 2 which gave me $400 towards dentals. The clinic faxed the claim through for me last Monday evening and low and behold, a cheque for $400 came to my door last night!!!!! The total for the dentry was $580, but my plan covered up to $400. I was thrilled! They didn’t even remove deductible from it. Sweet deal.” – RHS
<br /><br />Pets’ mouths are biologically similar to humans. Their teeth are susceptible to plaque and tartar build-up and bacterial infections. A significant bacterial infection growing under the gums can damage the structural tissues (gum and bone) that hold teeth in place. This is called periodontal disease, and the pet should receive the appropriate treatment from a veterinarian. If a tooth has been cracked or chipped, bacteria may migrate deeper into the surrounding tissues and cause inflammation or an abscess. In some cases, abscessed teeth require extraction.
<br /><br />There is a price to pay for overlooking a pet’s dental health—and it’s more than the high cost of a dental cleaning. Your pet’s mouth can be the gateway to more serious health issues: excessive tartar, tooth decay, periodontal disease and oral abscesses can lead to other major medical conditions involving the heart, liver and kidneys.
<br /><br />To prevent serious health problems, pet owners should have their pets’ oral and dental health evaluated by a veterinarian regularly. The most effective preventive treatment for dental disease is a professional teeth cleaning. Only with a professional cleaning is a <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy4xMnBhdGguY29tL3ZldGVyaW5hcnlfcGV0aW5zdXJhbmNl" target="_blank">veterinarian</a>  able to fully assess an animal’s dental health, take X-rays as needed, scale bacteria and tartar off of tooth surfaces as well as from under the gum line, polish and perform more advanced procedures if necessary. Having pet dental insurance is a wise choice in any situation.
<br /><br />I think that being a Canadian myself, it is comforting to find a Canadian owned and operated business that is able to provide <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy4xMnBhdGguY29tL3ZldGVyaW5hcnlfcGV0aW5zdXJhbmNl" target="_blank">veterinary pet insurance</a> .

		<document id="915b64822aa4f4552eb4beae40aee551" url=""><![CDATA[Online Marking Tools Are A Must | Angie Mitchell<br/><br/>Okay, so we all like convenience, right? Most of us aren’t sitting around wondering how we could make our lives just a little more complicated. Well, for those of us at 12 Second Commute, we’ve got <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy4xMnBhdGguY29tL29ubGluZW1hcmtldGluZ3Rvb2xz" target="_blank">online marketing tools</a>  that we use pretty much daily to help keep things, and by things I mean us, more organized, focused, and overall on track.
<br /><br />The flagship <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy4xMnBhdGguY29tL29ubGluZW1hcmtldGluZ3Rvb2xz" target="_blank">online marketing tool</a>  that's really going to throw the blood in the water is the top of the line (exclusive only to 12 Second Commute) is the Program Builder.
<br /><br />Network Marketers with a not so active downline are loving this one because it allows you to easily duplicate a sales and marketing system so they can be up and running with the same capture page and autoresponder messages as you--all fully customized with their information.
<br /><br />For example, if you want to create a Program Builder for a current program you are involved with, these are the steps you would take.
<br /><br />Step One : Click on the Variable Setup link and assign the values you want to use in your Autoresponder messages and on your capture page.
<br /><br />Step Two : Click on the Variable Layout Page link and give instructions to users of your Program Builder so they will know what to put in the custom fields.
<br /><br />Step Three : Click on the Autoresponder link and create/edit messages for a current list or create a new list with new messages and insert your AR custom codes in your messages in the proper place.
<br /><br />Step Four : Click on the Capture Page Creator link and create a new capture page and insert the custom codes where you want the information to be or edit a current page and insert the custom codes on that page.
<br /><br />Step Five : Click on the Create New Password and generate your password for this program builder. This is the password, you will send to your clients. You can also find this password in the future by clicking on the Existing Program Details link.
<br /><br />No to worry, there are also videos on the Program Builder that will walk you step by step through the process of creating a Program Builder for your downline as well as using a Program Builder from someone else.
<br /><br />I'd say, coming in a close second would be the Capture Page Creator/Editor; this thing is seriously going to enhance your webpages and the best part is, you don't need to know HTML, Java or any of those other nasty 4 letter words.
<br /><br />Ad and link trackers are also important, so you to know where the heck the traffic is coming from or what's working and what's not?
<br /><br />The Autoresponders are powerful, reliable and easy to use, a must for anybody looking to carve out their piece of the internet! Build a quality and responsive list using the only AR you will EVER need!
<br /><br />A Contact manager is extremely important as well because if you don't keep in touch with your prospects and clients, you will never reach the top. Having this specific <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy4xMnBhdGguY29tL29ubGluZW1hcmtldGluZ3Rvb2xz" target="_blank">online marketing tool</a>  solves that issue since it is automatically tied into your Autoresponder, your job is simply a matter of managing prospects and clients instead of having them manage you.
<br /><br />There is so much more included in 12 Second Commute than what is mentioned above, my advice to anyone working online, no matter what your product, information or service is to try a 30 day trial to see for yourself how valuable this system really is.
<br /><br />There are literally hundreds of software tools you can buy, but these are hands down the best <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy4xMnBhdGguY29tL29ubGluZW1hcmtldGluZ3Rvb2xz" target="_blank">online marketing tools</a>  that I have purchased.
<br /><br />Online Marketing Tools are popular for a reason - there are some good ones that work just fine, then there are tools like 12 Second Commute that work grrrrreat! The best internet marketing tools can work wonders for an online business.
<br /><br />By adding <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy4xMnBhdGguY29tL29ubGluZW1hcmtldGluZ3Rvb2xz" target="_blank">online marketing tools</a>  to your arsenal it is the &quot;secret sauce&quot; that makes the magic work.

Angie Mitchel<br/><br/>Are you working from home and do you really want to be successful? That might sound like a silly question, but it is the first questions you must ask yourself and you need to be brutally honest. Do you have what it takes? Are you using <strong>online marketing tools</strong>? If not, you are leaving money on the table people!
<br /><br />Many people will say &quot;Yes!, I want to be successful!&quot; but they are not willing to do what is necessary to achieve their goal. First off, <strong>online marketing tools</strong> are a must, look at all the superheroes, they had all sorts of aids to make their lives easier and the end result was, they helped and the mission was accomplished successfully.
<br /><br />Working from home is work and while the scammers are telling you how easy things will be and how much you can make overnight, you and I both know that is not the case or you would not be reading this article.
<br /><br />If working from home was so easy, we would all be sitting on a beach watching the waves roll in with our laptop spewing out money. Working from home can be easier but that requires an investment on your part. Get yourself a set of <strong>online marketing tools</strong>, let them be your &quot;superheroes&quot; I know you might be good but not that good. Who has time to send out individual emails and keep in contact with their customers while keeping track of where the traffic is coming from? Who has time to hold others hands when you could be handing them a ready made fully customizable program they could be using that very hour?
<br /><br />I saw an email today that read 7 steps to 7 figures and it went on to tell how one person made their first million in only 21 days. Do the math on this and that is over $47,000 per day. Right and I saw a pig flying last Friday too.
<br /><br />People are tired of all the hype and misleading information that litters the internet these days. Every Product, Program and Service is just so much bigger, better, more powerful than the last. Being helpful and teaching others to be helpful is the key to success. People follow people not Products, Programs and Services so, stop trying to cram whatever it is you are trying to promote down peoples throats. Build a relationship and be honest, offer to help... then show them the <strong>online marketing tools</strong> you use in being successful.
<br /><br />If you believe that hype out on the Internet about instant riches, you might want to stop reading right now because you are not going to get it from me.
<br /><br />Some are so desperate to make money online but they don't want to invest in <strong>online marketing tools</strong>. Working like a dog, trying to be successful is plain and simple a huge waste of time and money if you don't have online marketing tools- not when you're competing with the thousands that are. It takes some work and it will take some money on your part—not much, but some.
<br /><br />I'm not a &quot;Guru or Webmaster&quot;. I did however wake up and smell the coffee then I purchased myself a great set of online marketing tools and I am finally seeing the fruits of my labor and let me tell you it feels pretty darn good! I'm not able to retire just yet but the light at the end of the tunnel is getting brighter every day.
<br /><br />Every day people are seeing the power of their <strong>online marketing tools</strong>, they too are experiencing success.
<br /><br />There are many businesses out there who will give you capture pages and Autoresponder messages to help sell THEIR service, but you are not building YOUR own prospect list. Start building your own list that you totally control and that you can use to sell any legal product, program or service on the Internet.
<br /><br />If you cannot afford online marketing tools to manage your entire online business, build your prospect list and get unlimited help and support, then you might want to seriously rethink your online objectives. No, that is not a slap but as I told you in the beginning, you are going to need to invest a little money to build your business and speaking personally, I am actually making money online and that is more than 99% of people can say.
<br /><br />Do not purchase online marketing tools because I recommend it, do it for yourself and your business.

Online Marketing Tools<br/><br/>Are free <strong>email autoresponders</strong> safe for your online marketing business? I will show you three main issues behind a free email autoresponder offer and how to escape them.
<br /><br />As you may have heard, knowledge is power: if you know the dangers, you can avoid them.
<br /><br />I’m talking about free online marketing tools you can have access to by way of a free subscription. Sometimes you could find yourself bombarded with spam or, even worse, malware before you even realize it.
<br /><br />Of course, if your goal is to make money online you have to be careful when using free online marketing tools, a good dose of malware would definitely throw a wrench into things, free is not always the way to go in my own opinion.
<br /><br />The most important online marketing tool is <strong>email autoresponders</strong>, Many companies offer a free autoresponder account. Unfortunately, not all these offers are really what they seem. 
<br /><br />Here is a list of things to watch out for.
<br /><br />1) A 1 Month Free Trial
<br /><br />Most of the top autoresponder companies offer a free account with this clause: &quot;You will receive an account free of charge for a trial period of one month and then, if you then decide to keep it, you must pay the monthly fee.&quot;
<br /><br />To escape this trap you need to carefully check the terms and conditions before subscribing. If you decide to use the free <strong>email autoresponders</strong> just to test the service out, it’s no skin off your back if you drop you account at the end of the month. However, if you do indeed decide to use the free account for the real intent to grow your online business, make certain you don’t loose your subscribers at the end of the 1st month. The only way to escape this is to make sure, before subscription, that the service allows you to export your subscribers list. Once exported, you get your asset and you can import it and market it with any other email autoresponder service.
<br /><br />2) Limited Follow-ups 
<br /><br />One of the main limitations of free <strong>email autoresponders</strong> has to do with the number of follow-up messages you can import. Obviously, you will need at least a follow-up series for each one of your marketing campaigns, but this is something many newbies don’t realize. That’s why they may discover how a free email autoresponder may limit their business when discover, it’s too late. 
<br /><br />An easy way to escape this trap is to subscribe for more than one account to the same service: If the free autoresponder service gives you 3 follow-up series, you could subscribe for two accounts and get access to 6 series. Most of the time, the only thing you need is another email address, and you can get as many as you want at gmail.com (within reason) then again this does require a bit more work to manage. This is up to you to evaluate: You should plan in advance which kind of business you want to build and how many campaigns it will need. If the campaign number is high as compared to the maximum follow-up series of the account, maybe the price you’re going to pay for it will be too high. As before, check the terms and conditions before subscribing then make your plans accordingly. I personally would never go this route because I don't need the headache.
<br /><br />3) Low Level Instruction (how to use the darn things)
<br /><br />If you have never used <strong>email autoresponders</strong> before you might find that with a free service that there is little to no real instruction on how to properly set them up and use them to your advantage. When working online you know that time is precious, you do not want to find yourself bouncing from page to page like a confused crazy person unable to find what you needed. Again, it depends on the service you choose. What I can suggest you to do to avoid falling in this trap is to check the instructions and tutorials right away after subscription and before launching any marketing campaigns.
<br /><br />Everybody learns differently, some need to read it, some need to hear it, some need to watch it and some need all three and there is nothing wrong with that.
<br /><br />With the set of online marketing tools I use including <strong>email autoresponders</strong>, there are video tutorials, text based tutorials, live conferences 4 times per week where you will get your questions answered, there is even a Skype group where people (from around the world) gather and offer help. All for a Basic Membership of $9/mth up to a $39/mth Elite Membership where the online marketing tools is unlimited.
<br /><br />I hope this article will be useful to you. If you’re determined to build a real business and make money online, know that you can do it with free resources, Personally I could do without the headaches.

While all of these <strong>online marketing tools</strong> mean well, 90% miss on the most important part of product, program or service management.
<br /><br />Simplicity.
<br /><br />I’ve come across dozens of <strong>online marketing tools</strong>, and I can say with certainty that the number one most important aspect of good online tools is it needs to be drop-dead simple. Unfortunately, this is the number one most-overlooked aspect as well.
<br /><br />I don't necessarily use all the fancy schmancy tools I have available to me, although very handy when I do need them. I do make great use of the Autoresponder, Contact Manager, Capture Page Creator, Link Tracker, SEO Tools... these are all standard tools when working online. Sure, I could use a sharp stick on leather if I wanted to. (Note to self: get more leather at local tannery.)
<br /><br />No, this system the most dexterous, all-inclusive system I've ever come across, short of the old pen and paper method. If you have ears and eyes to listen to training videos, attend trainings and know how to follow instruction then you will do just fine. Yes, there is alot of information provided with this service because it offers so much. Note: there is also a lot of support as well if needed and I'm not just saying that because it sounds good.
<br /><br />There are alot of newbies trying to make a living online and I know all too well how frustrating it can be but there is only one way to eat an elephant and that's one bite at a time. (Isn't that right Olson<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/unsure.gif" alt=":)" /> There is just not enough time in one day to know everything there is to know about working online. However, there are tools available to make things easier and you can have them all under one roof, saving you time and money floundering all over the internet.
<br /><br />And I guarantee you’ll get more done.
<br /><br />If you don't have a process in place, it doesn't matter what glossy software you install. It won't work. You’ve got to know the ropes when you’re running your own business. Choose the right <strong>online marketing tools</strong> for the job and you’ll on your way to getting it done efficiently, effectively and profitably.
<br /><br />Are you trembling with excitement, dreaming of all the free time you’ll have for doing all of those things you always wanted? You should be. This will change your life. Are you ready?
<br /><br />After getting yourself a product, program or service to promote use online marketing tools and start promoting! Build yourself a capture page, track you traffic, start building your list and keep in contact with them. I've become pretty good at BUM Marketing, I have never ever paid for advertising, all I have paid for is the online marketing tools the rest of my time is spent writing content and getting it out there.
<br /><br />You have got to keep things simple, stay focused and don't make the mistake so many others have made by spreading yourself too thin or having too many irons in the fire as they say.
<br /><br /><strong>Online marketing tools</strong> is largely all about solving problems, time management and being efficient - and I for one will take all the help I can get in that regard.
<br /><br />Running an online business and making money on the Internet is soooooo much easier when you have right tools and supreme guidance.
<br /><br />Till next time, happy marketing!
