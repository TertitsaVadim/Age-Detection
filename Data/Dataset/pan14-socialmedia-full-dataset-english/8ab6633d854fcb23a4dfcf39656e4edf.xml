<br /><br />**To lose the person you love so much to another who doesn't care at all. 
<br /><br />**To have someone you care so about so much throw a party...
<br />and not tell you about it. 
<br /><br />**When your favorite person on earth neglects to invite you to his graduation. 
<br /><br />**To have people think that you don't care. 
<br /><br />**The greatest pain in life, is not to die, but to be forgotten.
<br /><br />** To be left in the dust after another's great achievement. 
<br /><br />**To never get a call from a friend, just saying &quot;hi&quot;. 
<br /><br />**When you show someone your innermost thoughts and they laugh in your face. 
<br /><br />**For friends to always be too busy to console you when you need someone to  lift  your spirits. 
<br /><br />**When it seems like the only person who cares about you, is you. 
<br /><br />**Life is full of pain, but does it ever get better?
<br /><br />Will people ever care about each other, and make time for those who are in need? 
<br />Each of us has a part to play in this great show we call life. 
<br />Each of us has a duty to mankind to tell our friends we love them. 
<br />If you do not care about your friends you will not be pusinshed. 
<br />You will simply be ignored...
<br />forgotten...
<br />as you have done to others. 
<br /><br />The greatest pain....is to lose a friend..in the blink of an eye.......

<br /><br />Every single evening
<br />As I'm lying here in bed
<br />This tiny little prayer
<br />Keeps running through my head.
<br /><br />God bless my Mom and Dad,
<br />And all my family.
<br />Keep them warm and safe from harm
<br />For they're so close to me.
<br /><br />And God, there is one more thing
<br />I wish that you could do.
<br />Hope you don't mind me asking,
<br />Bless my computer too.
<br /><br />Now I know that it's not normal
<br />To bless a mother board,
<br />But listen just a second
<br />While I explain to you 'My Lord.'
<br /><br />You see, that little metal box
<br />Holds more than odds &amp; ends
<br />Inside those small compartments
<br />Rest so many of my FRIENDS.
<br /><br />I know so much about them
<br />By the kindness that they give
<br />And this little scrap of metal
<br />Takes me in to where they live.
<br /><br />By faith is how I know them
<br />Much the same as you
<br />We share in what life brings us
<br />And from that our friendship grew.
<br /><br />Please, take an extra minute
<br />From your duties up above
<br />To bless those in my address book
<br />That's filled with so much love!
<br /><br />Wherever else this prayer may reach
<br />To each and every friend,
<br />bless each email Inbox
<br />And the person who hits Send.
<br /><br />When you update your heavenly list
<br />On your own CD-Rom
<br />Remember each who've said this prayer
<br />Sent up to God.com.
<br /><br />Amen.

<br />I thought about you.

<br /><br />Dear Diary,

<br />trying to find a reason - any reason - to stop loving 
<br />but it doesn't help, i stll love no matter what 
<br />'cause thats the only thing i kno how to do best 
<br />stll i try to reserve myself so that i dnt get hurt 
<br />but i do i always do 
<br /><br />Dear Diary, 
<br />as i write this i feel like crying 
<br />at the same tym i want to give life to my love 
<br />so theat he can kno that it's alright eventhough it looks like the end

<br />so that he can be ale to move ahead without fear and negative thoughts 
<br />i want to give faith to my love 
<br />so that he can realize that anything is possible 
<br />i want to give sight to my love 
<br />so that he can see him the way i do 
<br />but i can't 
<br />to give life means i would hav to die 
<br />to give hope means would hav to live his life, or he; mine

<br />I found that so hard to believe
<br />Because his kiss belonged to me
<br /><br />How could an angel break my heart
<br />Why didnt he catch my falling star
<br />I wish I didnt wish so hard
<br />Maybe I wished our love apart
<br />How could an angel break my heart
<br /><br />I heard here face was white as rain
<br />Soft as a rose that blooms in may
<br />He keeps her picture in a frame
<br />And when he sleeps he calls her name
<br />I wonder if she makes him smile
<br />The way he used to smile at me
<br />I hope she doesnt make him laugh
<br />Because his laugh belongs to me
<br /><br />How could an angel break my heart
<br />Why didnt he catch my falling star

<br />some friends one
<br />evening
<br />and time passed quickly as each shared
<br />their
<br />various experiences of the past year.
<br /><br />She ended up staying longer than
<br />planned,
<br />and
<br />had to walk home alone. She wasn't
<br />afraid
<br />because it was a small town and she lived
<br />only
<br />a
<br />few blocks away.
<br /><br />As she walked along under the tall elm
<br />trees,
<br />Diane asked God to keep her safe from
<br />harm
<br />and
<br />danger.
<br /><br />When she reached the alley, which was a
<br />short
<br />cut to her house, she decided to take it.
<br /><br />However, halfway down the alley she
<br />noticed
<br />a
<br />man standing at the end as though he
<br />were
<br />waiting
<br />for her.
<br /><br />She became uneasy and began to pray,
<br />asking
<br />for
<br />God's protection.
<br /><br />Instantly a comforting feeling of quietness
<br />and
<br />security wrapped round her, she felt as
<br />though
<br />someone was walking with her.
<br /><br />When she reached the end of the alley,
<br />she
<br />walked right past the man and arrived
<br />home
<br />safely.
<br /><br />The following day, she read in the
<br />newspaper
<br />that
<br />a young girl had been raped in the same
<br />alley
<br />just
<br />twenty minutes after she had been there.
<br /><br />Feeling overwhelmed by this tragedy and
<br />the
<br />fact
<br />that it could have been her, she began to
<br />weep.
<br /><br />Thanking the Lord for her safety and to
<br />help
<br />this
<br />young woman, she decided to go to the
<br />police
<br />station.
<br /><br />She felt she could recognize the man, so
<br />she
<br />told
<br />them her story.
<br /><br />The police asked her if she would be
<br />willing to
<br />look
<br />at a lineup to see if she could identify
<br />him.
<br /><br />She agreed and immediately pointed out
<br />the
<br />man
<br />she had seen in the alley the night
<br />before.
<br /><br />When the man was told he had been
<br />identified,
<br />he
<br />immediately broke down and confessed.
<br /><br />The officer thanked Diane for her bravery
<br />and
<br />asked if there was anything they could do
<br />for
<br />her.
<br /><br />She asked if they would ask the man one
<br />question.
<br /><br />Diane was curious as to why he had not
<br />attacked
<br />her.
<br /><br />When the policeman asked him, he
<br />answered, &quot;Because she wasn't alone.
<br />She
<br />had
<br />two tall men walking on either side of
<br />her.&quot;
<br /><br />Amazingly, whether you believe or not,
<br />you're
<br />never alone. Did you know that 98% of
<br />teenagers
<br />will not stand up for God?
<br /><br />Repost this as Love vs. Sex if you truly
<br />believe
<br />in
<br />God..,&quot;

<br />I roam without a care.
<br />I’m the queen of hearts what sadness is I know not,
<br />With no fear, I do and I defy.
<br />They can halt, they can try
<br />They can stop and ask me why.
<br />But do I listen?
<br />Oh no not I.
<br />I’m stubborn, I’m crazy.
<br />They say my mind is hazy.
<br />But no one knows where my dreams lie.
<br />Let the nymphets come to lure me,
<br />And know that I’m no worker bee.
<br />For when I look in their eyes,
<br />I’ll steal their hearts, their minds.
<br />No matter how gorgeous.
<br />They’ll be mine without a fuss.
<br />Like the winds sigh 
<br />And the birds fly
<br />Like the bumble bee’s affair,
<br />I roam without a care.
<br />I may be mad, a little strange,
<br />And wilder most,
<br />But the most lovable,
<br />And I’m everybody’s toast.
<br />Like the winds sigh 
<br />And the birds fly
<br />Like the bumble bee’s affair,
<br />I roam without a care.
