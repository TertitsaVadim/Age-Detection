They were widely used to build basic business websites. However with the advent of content management systems, website builders have almost become an obsolete technique. Drupal website development has been one of the leaders in this CMS revolution. Its user-friendliness and robust features make it one of the most preferred web development tools in the world. Let us now take a look at some of the benefits that Drupal offers over website builder system.
<br /><br />Cost of Development – Drupal is an open source CMS which means that you don’t need to incur any expense in designing and developing a website using Drupal. This makes it the first choice for any business website especially the startups. On the other hand for website builders, you need to purchase licensed software such as Dreamweaver that may not be economically viable. Online builder tools from domain and hosting service providers are expensive, that force you pay for the services you may not even use as a part of their website developer packages.
<br /><br />Design and Functionality – If you are choosing a website developer you will need to compromise on the design and functionality of the website. Most site builder come packed with a handful templates, which you would have stick to build a website. This results in mundane websites that don’t attract many eyeballs. Apart from these, the auto-site builders allow you develop only basic websites with basic functionality. Drupal website development however doesn’t tie you to any template or theme as you can design your own from scratch. Apart from this, you can add robust functionality to the website with the use of third-party plugins.
<br /><br />Scalability – Your website needs to constantly keep pace with the changing demands of your business or the quantum leap that web technology may be undergoing. Since website builders have limited options in site customization you will have to stick to the site you have or completely overhaul even when you might need a simple upgrade. Drupal is highly modular in nature that allows you to add features and functionality to the website along with altering the look. When third-party plugins are installed, they immediately offer interactive functions that can be customized to suit your needs.
<br /><br />Search Engine Friendliness – Search engines play a very vital role in driving traffic to your website. But the results depend on the quality and size of your code base. This is where Drupal is miles ahead of website builders as it generates clean and search engine friendly code that helps you rank high in the results pages. Coding is the biggest con of website builder systems as they generate lots of unnecessary lines of coding making the website heavy and load slow on the web browser.
<br /><br />All the above mentioned factors are extremely important for the success of your website and this is why you should choose Drupal website development over website builder system.

It is an established set of techniques that attracts targeted traffic to the website and make it more popular among users. A good business web design must implement these techniques to be successful. In e-Commerce websites, more traffic can lead to larger number of sales, where as in other corporate or organizational websites it allows marketers to promote their website across a larger target audience. Here are some of the basic web promotion ideas for website optimization which should be a part of your business web design.
<br /><br />Clean Coding – This is one of the basic things that you need to have for an effective optimization campaign. The website should be coded manually and not using WYSIWYG editors which often make the code base large and sloppy. Clean codes attract search engine crawlers and such websites rank high on the search engine results pages. You can opt for semantic coding technique where the site is well-defined resulting in better SEO score. The code needs to undergo W3C validation to ensure that the pages are error free.
<br /><br />Page Title and Description – The page title and description say a lot about the content of your page both to the visitors as well as the search engines and thus you need to be very creative with these. You need to ensure that it defines the page well and contains the primary keywords for your page. The description should be crisp as this will emphasize the content of that page. Page titles and description appear in the search engine results and thus need to catch the eyes of the visitors instantly.
<br /><br />Alt Tag – Images are a part and parcel of any business web design and it is very important that the images are properly defined to the search engines as these results in higher traffic. You can make use of alternate attribute better known as ALT Tag. It is nothing, but an alternative text that is rendered when the element to which it is applied cannot be rendered. The Alt Tag is easily indexed by the search engines that helps attract traffic.
<br /><br />URL Optimization – The URL of your webpage can have a great contributing factor to the overall promotion of the website. It is advisable that you create the URL of the webpages manually by including relevant keywords as this attracts search engines. The URL also has to be short and shouldn’t have more than two sub-indexes. A user should be able to reach any page in the website with least number of clicks.
<br /><br />Create A Sitemap – Creating a sitemap helps letting search engines such as Google and Yahoo know of every single page within your site which helps them crawl the pages with ease. You need to create a sitemap and keep on updating it as and when new sections (not pages) are being added to the website.

That time is now gone, and today's world is witnessing a flourishing ecommerce industry. Thanks to Magento, osCommerce and other ecommerce platforms that helped merchants break new grounds in the ecomm world. But if we get deep into this world and have to decide between Magento and osCommerce, the situation becomes difficult. If we look at the popularity of both, however, Magento is way too ahead of osCommerce.
<br /><br />Magento (2008) came as a new player in the game that osCommerce was playing since 2000. But it soon became the top seed in the market. How? What are the major advantages and disadvantages of Magento – and of osCommerce, for that matter ?
<br /><br />Magento Community: A bigger one, a thriving one than that of osCommerce
<br />There's no denying to the fact that Magento has a huge, thriving community. Magento Forum and Magento Answer are excellent places to find answers to all your issues. Magento Bug Tracking is another great way to depict and resolve a problem in your site. The community of osCommerce, though not as large as Magento's, has numerous relevant discussions going on at everyday basis and has also proved to be handy in solving the problems of users.
<br /><br />Magento provides you with a sea of features – But wait, is there any catch here?
<br />Here you can not only find the major products of Magento but also easily compare them (on the basis of pricing and features). You'll observe that not all of them are free. Only Magento Community, which comparatively has very less features, lacks functionality and is recommended for developers only, comes free. The others (Magento Enterprise and Magento Enterprise Premium) cost you a good amount of money for that sea of features – like strong data encryption, targeted offerings, gifting options, reward points system, enhanced CMS etc. South Korean giant Samsung uses the enterprise version Magento.
<br /><br />There is another version of Magento, not free but relatively cheaper and specially designed for small businesses with big dreams. It's name is Magento Go – you must explore it, for you never know it might be the one for your business.  
<br /><br />osCommerce is absolutely free!  
<br />On the other hand, osCommerce is completely a free software and you can see all its features here. Some of its major features are: SSL-based transactions, multi-lingual and multi-currency support, unlimited products, fast search, numerous online and offline payment gateways etc. It has always been a user-friendly platform, and its new version is coming soon in the market. However, it doesn't yet offer multiple store feature, which is also available in Magento Community. It similarly lacks features like cross-selling, image zoom-in, checking recently viewed products etc.
<br /><br />We hope we have given you a good overview of Magento and osCommerce. If you have any queries, you can ask us through your comments.

Google and Apple both today have more than 600K apps in their application stores. And today, mobile app development is happening everywhere across the world. The big thing now is not app development, but app marketing – that too amid a dog-eat-dog competition where every other app is scratching everything under the sun to get talked about. And this post is a bid to help app developers successfully market their apps. This might sound a cliche and some of the what's-about-to-come things might sound generic, but if you religiously make them your guiding light, you'll truly understand their importance.
<br /><br />Let's start from the manufacturing phase: Create one-of-its-kind app
<br />Google says your content should be unique to get a good position in search results. Same applies to apps. If you're just trying to make an improvement – or a copy – of some already-popular app, who's going to notice it unless it's some awesome rethinking/redesigning? But imagine if it is a new concept, it'll become a new bait in itself and will save you thousands of dollars for marketing.
<br /><br />Pouncing onto the last stages of app development
<br />No, here we are not going to steer you into technical hustle bustle. We'll just ask you some questions:
<br /><br />* Taking care of all the market trademarks and knowing that today's world is more likely to fall for an unique, cool yet relevant app, have you decided the name of your app?
<br /><br />* Have you chosen the most relevant category for your app?
<br /><br />* The app that is the result of your creativity and hard work also demands a compelling icon – do you have any?
<br /><br />* Have you started targeting social media for your app? If not, start doing it now. The more buzz you'll be able to create, the more popular your app will end up being.
<br /><br />* Hype, yes hype, is one of the best ways to promote anything, but only if that thing is truly unique. Have you made a hype of your app?
<br /><br />Now that you're ready with your app – what after it?
<br />Immediately after your app is tested and ready to set its feat into the market, start preparing for its grand launch. Send the newsletters. Target the social media again. Host some contests. Give away some attractive gifts. Share the promo codes. Make your presence felt on the popular app sites/blogs. Prepare a making-of-the-app video. And promote it over the Web.
<br /><br />To sum up, your objective of app marketing should be to create an awareness and spread the word about your app – both before and after its release. Make bloggers blogging about your app, tweeple tweeting about it and tech gurus debating about it. The more successful you become in doing all this, the more popular your app is likely to get.
<br /><br />PixelCrayons is a well known web development and mobile solutions provider. At PixelCrayons, you may hire professional <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2FuZHJvaWQucGl4ZWxjcmF5b25zLmNvbS8_" target="_blank">Android developers</a> and <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2lwaG9uZS5waXhlbGNyYXlvbnMuY29tLw__" target="_blank">iPhone developers</a> at quite affordable rates.

So to make your app stand out in a crowd, it must be featured not only functional.
<br /><br />Here in this post, we’ll provide some design tips through which you can get to know the secret of successful mobile applications.
<br /><br />Design Responsively
<br />Handhold devices are available in the market with various screen sizes, and making an app look  great across hundreds of devices with different combinations of screen size, pixel density is what makes it acceptable. So choosing a particular size is really a difficult task, but couple of factors are there on the basis of which you can finalize the one:
<br /><br />* Targeted audience
<br />    * Purpose of application
<br /><br />If you are not sure about the size of the screen your audience might prefer, better design something universal, as strategies are available there for coping with the diversity of the platform such as using fluid layouts that can stretch and compress as per the resolution of the screen.
<br /><br />Design For People
<br />The prime factor which must be kept under consideration while creating an mobile app is neither the idea nor the platform, it's the audience for whom you are designing the application. Consider the variety of audience that is going to use that application as defining the targeted audience is half the battle won.
<br /><br />Create your app after imagining the daily routine of your audience – is this app really gonna help them in their day-to-day life? How audience can relate their daily life with your product? Once you start thinking like this, you may come to know the important features missed by your product as defining the audience on terms of their lifestyle is more relevant than defining them on terms of technology.
<br /><br />Design Structurally
<br />The goal is to make the navigation simple and easy for the users. Large number of options can make your users frustrated. So to prevent users from frustration, design an app with user-friendly interface. Keep options in general categories so that user can experience a easy, simple and better navigation menu.
<br /><br />Design Dynamic Content
<br />Dynamic content is the visuals you would show to users when they’re stuck due to lost Internet connection and slow downloading speed. Dealing with such kind of challenges with animations is a great way, as they can keep users distracted when they are supposed to wait and can keep them away from frustration.
<br /><br />Design With Minimum Work
<br />Too much functionality in your mobile app can make its structure very deep, so it's better to display only the content and controls that are necessary for the user at that time as more functional display can confusing for the users. Better to include only core functionality in your mobile application so that essential functions can be used more easily.
<br /><br />Summing Up
<br />Designing a mobile application includes so many big and small factors. Above mentioned design tips are those that are must to keep in mind while designing a mobile application. Screen orientation and font used also need proper designer attention as they are must for an application to perform properly in both landscape &amp; portrait mode and switch between them.

Only a well-designed website is not what you want (or should want) to compete with millions of websites present out there in the world of Internet. So what is that X-factor? What  can make your website different from those of your competitors?
<br /><br />Obviously, everyone strives to make their website memorable and design it in such a way that it lasts an unforgettable expression on the visitor's mind. But it's not about thinking big, but about how!
<br /><br />Let's find out that how!
<br /><br />There's no limit to fun and creativity – but only when they're led by your objective!
<br />Fun-filled, creative website design can help us in producing a more engaging website as generating smiles on the faces is the best way to establish a connection; a little humor can break the ice and urges people to take a step ahead.
<br /><br />Here we are not advising you to make a circus site as there is a fine line between sensible design and silly design. And to make your website sound professional, its design must convey your business objective as well. Make it a delightful experience so that remember your message not only gets conveyed but stays with them (your targeted audience).
<br /><br />Things that you can't afford to overlook!
<br />Some pivotal factors that must be kept into consideration while designing an interactive web page are: What to add, where to add and how much to add?
<br /><br />Right amount of interaction at the right places can create a memorable experience, but too much of it can backfire as well, driving your site visitors away.
<br /><br />Proper balance
<br />The most successful websites are those which have the balance of both: what you want to convey and what people are looking for. If visitors don't find the elements they are looking, they will definitely play a major role in taking your website's bounce rate northwards. For ensuring the proper balance, never stop doing your market research and always keep a tab on changes in the buying behavior of people. 
<br /><br />Infographics
<br />It is a general approach of thinking that some websites can't be highly interactive as they provide other kind of services. The answer is yes. But that doesn't mean they can't be interactive at all. And  in the age of infographics, what other best way you have? Infographics are graciously adopted by many popular brands nowadays and you should too incorporate them in your website to better the way you engage with your visitors.
<br /><br />Summing up
<br />Finally, your aim should be to design a memorable website to leave an impression on people, not to lose them forever either with no interaction or too much of it. Also, keep an eye on your target audience so that your website not only looks attractive but also ensures more and more conversions.

If you aren’t sure what this translates to let us explain this to you in brief. Responsive web design is a technique whereby websites are designed to react to the user’s environment or device. In simple terms, this means a user gets to browse through a comprehensively built website irrespective of the devices he or she uses to access the website.
<br /><br />Responsive websites have a fluid grid structure which in combination with media queries in your CSS, where the breakpoints are predefined, allows the creation of device sensitive layouts. Let us now take a look into the factors which have made responsive web design so important in today’s world.    
<br /><br /><strong>It’s a Multi Device World</strong>
<br /><br />Gone are those days when desktop and laptops were solely used to browse through the Internet. These days smartphones and tablets are being used just as much to access your website, if not more. Responsive web design allows you to cater to all these customers at one gone without having to design and develop customized websites for different platforms. Even within these devices the screen size and resolution keeps changing and it is only with responsive web design that you can create a robust website which is compatible with all these devices.
<br /><br /><strong>Clients Are on the Go</strong>
<br /><br />Your clients are constantly on the move and it is during this time that they might browse through your website on their smartphones or tablets sipping a cup of coffee or taking a ride in the underground tube. Imagine the competitive advantage that your website would have over the rivals if you can offer a full scale site to these clients against a skimmed one, which most traditional mobile websites were. This can become your biggest branding factor.
<br /><br /><strong>Speed Up and Be Counted</strong>
<br /><br />Research has shown that an average Internet user spends no more than 8 seconds on a webpage. They hardly read the content on the first visit and rather scan through it. And with multiple sites open in different tabs you don’t have the luxury of time with your design. Responsive web design renders compatible version of images and graphics onto the browser, thus speeding up the rendering process. So when you are up against competition on multiple tabs you will be counted among the best.
<br /><br /><strong>It is Cost Effective and Future Ready</strong>
<br /><br />Imagine the overhead cost of developing multiple versions of the same website and the amount of server space you would require. Add to it the trouble of creating a new version of the website each time a new device is launched in the market. This might require a team of designers to constantly keep working on the website to keep it in sync with the changing trends in the market. With responsive web design you can sleep in peace as your website will not only meet your present day needs but also will be ready for the future.

Drupal is one such content management system that lives up to the hype and continuously delivers excellence. As an open source content management system, Drupal is seeing increased users every day. Currently, 873,678 people in over 200 countries speaking 181 languages use Drupal to run their websites. A vibrant and diverse community is continuously helping the content management system to grow making it climb the ladders of popularity quite successfully.
<br /><br />While Drupal 7, the latest version, is out and being used by thousands of people, the community is already working on the next version, Drupal 8. The CMS comprises of modules and themes that are easily downloadable and applied according to the need of a website. Let us look at a few interesting faces about Drupal :
<br /><br />* Drupal boasts of flexibility and lives up to it by making it extremely easy to incorporate videos, text, blog, podcasts and polls into a site. The web interface has a visual editor making it easy to upload data and make frequent changes. The features of menu handling, real-time statistics and revision control further help developers use the CMS. Changes can be easily implemented without having to start from scratch.
<br /><br />* The core development team of Drupal lays special emphasis on security and understands the need to continuously strengthen it. According to a study by WhiteHat Security Inc, a company based in California, US, 7 out of 10 websites have serious vulnerabilities. Keeping this in mind, Drupal continuously keeps releasing modules to strengthen the security. Currently there are 622 security modules from Drupal.
<br /><br />* Multi-level users, different levels of user permissions make Drupal user-friendly. Since multiple levels of users can be defined, roles can be specified and permissions can be given. A super user can set instructions on the roles of other users and thus fine-grains the permission levels. The administrative powers in Drupal 7 have further been strengthened.
<br /><br />* Often termed as a secret weapon of Drupal, the taxonomy module can leave one and all impressed. Since information is scattered all around the system and it becomes difficult to retrieve and organize them, Drupal makes it possible to tag articles, videos, images etc in an organized manner. When an article is tagged, the content is given more importance than the organization structure that is the tags. This way the end-users are in a position to change content tags rather than wait for the system administrator. Taxonomy gives fluidity to the organizational structure of a website.
<br /><br />* The developers and administrators who have used CCK will vouch for the usability of the module kit. The CCK or Content Construction Kit is regarded as an essential module for Drupal that allows administrators to create new content types. Working hand-in-hand with CCK is the views module that is essentially a smart query builder and filters results search and displays results based on the popularity of the content on the site.
<br /><br />* 16000 modules and the numbers will only increase once Drupal 8 releases. This is the module strength of Drupal. Any requirement, any necessity can be easily be fulfilled thanks to these modules. Drupal offers core modules and add-on modules – both of which help make a website dynamic, robust, interactive and user-friendly.
<br /><br />* Large community support further makes it exciting to work on Drupal. Groups.drupal.org allows developers to come together and work together breaking all geographical boundaries. The idea is to be more involved, learn from the community and support the community. This learner-friendly atmosphere has helped Drupal attract more developers.

A decade back having a website or rather an online address was a symbol of pride for most businesses. These websites were with a few images and text put together. Today websites are visually much more attractive, informative and engaging – thanks to advancement in web design technology. The advent of advanced technologies such as HTML5 and CSS3 have given web design and development a completely new dimension. Let us take a look at some of the advantages that HTML5 and CSS3 bring to your business and why you should make use of these technologies for your business.
<br /><br />* Minimal Coding : HTML5 and CSS3 allow you to develop websites with minimal coding compared to technologies in the past. A lot of the coding process has been automated in HTML5 using which you can develop easily readable codes. Apart from this HTML5 generates clean semantic codes which make it easy for search engine crawlers to index your website ensuring you higher rankings in search engine results pages (SERPs).
<br /><br />* Offline Storage : This is one of the biggest advantages that HTML5/CSS3 brings to you. The new technology has the ability to cache emails, texts, images and other content on a local computer which can be used while browsing the website in the offline mode or when there is regular interruptions in connectivity. This advanced cache also helps reestablish connection faster between the client and the server as only the changes are updated rather than the entire cache.
<br /><br />* Browser Compatibility : It is one of the major issues which a developer has to deal with while creating a website and with HTML5 and CSS3 by your side your website will be compatible across all major mobile and web browsers. It also allows you the option to make use of fallback content for non-supporting browsers. Thus your website will be accessible to almost all Internet users in the world.
<br /><br />* Customization and Uniformity : Cascading Style Sheet has always been known to bring in uniformity to a website and CSS3 gives you more control over the appearance of your website. With this robust technology you can easily customize stock page elements within the website. It gives you increased control over colors, gradients and shadow effects which add to the visual appeal of the website.
<br /><br />* Videos and Audio : Today’s websites have come a long way from the days of image and text based websites as they include a lot of content in the form of audio and video. Prior to HTML5 and CSS3 developers had to make use of third-party applications such as Flash to integrate audio/video content but HTML5 allows you to integrate them seamlessly. Apart from this you can also create high-quality drawings, charts and rich content on your website using this platform.
<br /><br />* Geolocation : One of the most talked about features of HTML5 is Geolocation, which allows you to make the website smarter and serve a visitor’s exact needs. This allows the client’s location to be detected based on his/her permission. This also allows you to present the visitor with a highly customized webpage which relates to his/her exact needs.
<br /><br />HTML5 and CSS3 are a powerhouse of technology and to gain maximum out of these it is advisable that you hire the services of a professional web development company. The developers must have sound knowledge of these technologies and have the power to develop highly innovative and interactive websites. Take a look at their portfolio as this will allow you to make a highly informed decision.

Difference between Internet and Intranet is that the latter, unlike the former, is an internal network, confined within an organization. Extranet is also an internal network with the only difference of its wide range access; an Extranet can be accessed by associate partners and/or customers.
<br /><br />You must be wondering that why you need an Intranet when you can make organizational moves around a conference table but have you ever thought that spreading that information is a huge, hectic task while working with an organization of many people. Intranet can help you in keeping you away from this headache.
<br /><br /><strong>Four major reasons why your organization should invest in Intranet :</strong>
<br /><br /><strong>Make your intra-organizational communication robust.</strong>
<br /><br />* Irrespective of the size of an organization, whether it is small or big, communication issues are always there. For a company having remote employees, it becomes very difficult to communicate effectively with those employees and in such a case communication issue becomes more challenging.
<br /><br />* Information changes when they spread through a non-reliable source and a wrong information is more dangerous than an unknown information.
<br /><br />* To avoid this communication barrier it is must to have a centralized corporate communication so that each of the employee can retrieve the required information.
<br /><br />* Intranet enables communication among widely spread remote employees and departments and hence improves the overall organization's performance.
<br /><br /><strong>Save the time killed over unnecessary tasks.</strong>
<br /><br />* Work such as vacation request, order purchase, salary slips, and many others needs time as well as paper form to be filled. Intranet can make all this tasks convenient for the employees with an electronic form, employees are not supposed to rush to the HR for such kind of works and hence can save their time.
<br /><br />* Intranet also saves the document search time as one can easily retrieve the required information, and employees are not supposed to look here and there for document search. But make sure your Intranet is designed properly and in a user-friendly manner, otherwise it will become difficult for employees to reach the required stuff.
<br /><br /><strong>Save space on your server &amp; system.</strong>
<br /><br />* Information is the soul of an organization and keeps on increasing with time. Most of the informations are stored in electronic form over computer systems. Every employee has some information stored in his/her system. Now for a team working over those individual's informations stored in their systems is really hectic as gathering that data over a single space is difficult as this can also lead to mistake.
<br /><br />* You must be thinking that we can e-mail that data or can use the print copies. But both e-mailing and printing are time consuming and expensive methods.
<br /><br />* To improve the efficiency of your staff, it's must to have all the information at a single place from where it can be easily available to access to everyone and can be update instantly.
<br /><br />* So before your organization reaches low storage space stage, it makes sense to consider setting up a company Intranet. Intranet saves printing cost and hence saves our environment. It also enables employees sharing their data online.
<br /><br /><strong>Make flawless your information flow and its regulation.</strong>
<br /><br />* There is nothing more frustrating to employees than to look here and there for information they require.
<br /><br />* Categorized information ensures that data of the organization is secured and searchable for the future reference also. It improves the transparency of informations.
<br /><br />* Larger the company, more distributed the branches and employees and more important to keep the data such as company strategies, announcements and informations centralized &amp; categorized, so that quick &amp; efficient decisions can be taken instantly.
<br /><br /><strong>Summing up</strong>
<br /><br />Intranet makes your work smart as you can access your organizational information on your finger-tips whether working remotely or within the organization. Intranet also saves organization's time, money and enables employees to work efficiently.

A successful Intranet needs a lot of work and careful thought to make your staff collaborate and share information but mistakes can limit its success, so it's better to test your Intranet design for mistakes before getting too late!
<br /><br />Here are some words of wisdom for you to keep you away from traveling that road of mistakes:
<br /><br /><strong>Complex To Use</strong>
<br />Intranet should be intuitive, not complex. Otherwise, it becomes difficult to use as there is nothing worse than clicking here and there for retrieving the information. And users won't mind clicking if they know that they are searching in the right direction, but if they are not confident then more clicks can blow their minds.
<br /><br /><strong>Cloudy Navigation</strong>
<br />A poor navigation system can confuse users. Navigation link should take users to the next level only, not into an entire different section. There must be a breadcrumb trail so that user can easily navigate without any disorientation.
<br /><br /><strong>Uncategorized Information</strong>
<br />Un-categorization keep users away from the information. So to avoid this problem group the similar things together and make sure the words used in the categorization make sense to users and are descriptive of the information found within that category. Better to avoid bulky categorizations and keep most common categories on the top.
<br /><br /><strong>Universal Homepage</strong>
<br />Some contents are relevant for most of the users, but not for all as each department in an office needs specific information only. Employees of different departments require different information, displaying all the information on the welcome page just doesn't work as everyone is interested in What's For Me not in What's For Everybody.
<br /><br /><strong>Cluttered Welcome-Pages</strong>
<br />Welcome-Pages should be as simple as they can be so that users can easily find things they seek. It should not contain all the possible links; to keep your welcome-pages effective keep only those links which are important.
<br /><br /><strong>Creating A Single-Way Communication Platform</strong>
<br />Design Intranet for employees not for the corporate. So to make your employees get involved ask them for their suggestions that what features they need to get their job done better.
<br />Avoid to make complex approval process for publishing over the Intranet by employees as strict control stops users from participation.
<br /><br /><strong>Many Sign-Ups</strong>
<br />Signing up every time to take a step ahead hesitate your users to go further. So better to keep a single sign-up step open the other doors automatically for them. As already too many passwords are there for users to learn, so it's better to give them a stress-free experience.
<br /><br /><strong>Ignore Security Issues</strong>
<br />Everyone has some official data that can't be shared with everyone out there, so it's must to have some kind of security lock where employees can keep their official data secure such as financial data, strategies, organizational plans etc.
<br /><br /><strong>No Integration</strong>
<br />Integrate your corporate Intranet with external sources such as News, Stock Price, Press Release so that users can interact with the outer world and can experience a better interface. Integration also increases the interest of users in Intranet.
<br /><br /><strong>No Search Option</strong>
<br />Keep a search tool for the convince of users so that they are not supposed to go through each file and document while searching for something particular. An easy-to-search tool save efforts and time of your users and make your system more user-friendly.
<br /><br />We hope we made it – the wrongs you might end up in while developing your Intranet.

Digital storefront  – also called online store, estore, virtual store etc – is your answer. It'll take care of all your concerns, like increasing clientele, managing inventory, streamlining management, branding etc.
<br /><br />Term &quot;storefront&quot; traditionally used to describe a retail store, but can now refer to a website where Internet users can see, browse through and avail your products and services.
<br /><br />Many businesses today need an estore to boost sales, and in fact most startups don't even think of starting their business without an online storefront nowadays. But the question that arises here is that who should get a digital storefront?
<br /><br />Adopting a Digital Storefront can be beneficial for :
<br /><br />* Manufacturers – As it can help them improve their reach.
<br />    * Service Providers – Helps keep their advisors network up to date.
<br />    * Sales Operations – Helps streamline distribution and display of their materials.
<br /><br />Features of a Good Digital StoreFront :
<br /><br />Digital StoreFront should provide complete control to website operators over product description, product management, inventory, shipping and sales information. It should also provide –
<br /><br />* Ease Of Use – Intuitive shopping cart interface for users
<br />    * Account Information – Order status, history, product information, availability etc.
<br />    * Reduced Administration – Facilitates self-service with minimum human management efforts.
<br /><br />Challenges That Clients Usually Face :
<br /><br />Managing while customers make their purchases is not the only stressful thing about Digital StoreFront, some other tasks are also there which are time-consuming and labor-intensive such as :
<br /><br />* Warehouse Integration – Importing all the data of products you are getting from your suppliers is really a painful task especially when managing multiple suppliers and stores.
<br />    * Product Management – Out-of-stocks &amp; canceled-order problem generally arises when you have multiple suppliers or warehouses with the same product lines.
<br />    * Inventory Tracking – Keeping a record of all products that are published, unpublished, blocked, skipped, available, unavailable in real time is another painful &amp; time-consuming task.
<br /><br />Tips To Make Your Digital Storefront Successful :
<br /><br />* Identify Your Market – Keep your opinions open by looking at several different markets with different products but identify niche products that have broad appeal and stick with a common theme and focus your marketing activities within that particular niche.
<br />    * Do Your Homework – Go through the competitor's site and check that out for the price, offers, user Interface and other factors.
<br />    * Research for the keywords that suits your businesses.
<br />    * Products – It’s easy to build a Digital StoreFront for several hundred products but it’s much more difficult to manage that design for several thousand products efficiently. Therefore it's better to provide choices to consumers, but not so many that they have to think too hard.
<br />    * Shipping – In a market where everyone offers free shipping, you may have to offer free shipping. Consider whether you can make enough revenue to cover both your cost of goods sold and the shipping costs.
<br />    * Promotion – Promoting your business is must but your business promotion must have a specific goal, measure and be sure to listen and respond to audience feedback and adjust your content accordingly.

Launching a website is not only about having an online presence and buying server space, but much more. The aim of any web design ideally is that users should be able to connect with the website’s layout and design and should want to stick around for more time than they intended. Thus if your aim is to connect with the people (and that remains the core aim in most cases), you need to know the tricks of effective web designing that will help your business grow online.
<br /><br />Effective Web Designing Approaches
<br /><br />* Structure The Site Smartly : Users do not like to think when they are browsing any site and thus when they are visiting your website, do not make them think. Typically a user will glance through the home page, scan through a few lines of text and if in those seconds they find something interesting will they proceed. Thus it is important that you have a solid layout using appropriate grids and layouts. The site design and usability needs to be intuitive so that unconsciously the user clicks on what you want them to click on.
<br /><br />* Focus On Important Elements : Before you start designing the website, you should already know who your target audience is and what is the purpose for creating the site. Answers to these will give you the focus that will make your site crisp and effective. Effectively synchronize text and images (remember that images are always more attractive and thus should be used wisely).
<br /><br />* Do Not Test The User’s Patience : As already stated, a user doesn’t have time or patience to scroll through unnecessary content to finally reach to what they want. If you need your user to sign up or register, make the process short. They are not signing into something extremely confidential that they need to fill in every personal detail.
<br /><br />* Crisp Content : Only have crisp content in your website. Having a 1000+-word paragraph of something unnecessary is a big NO. Keep your sentences short, stick to the rules of basic grammar and do not get too informal. No matter how trendy the user is, they still like to see things in a conventional way (mostly). Do not go on and on but break the content into sub-heads and paragraphs.
<br /><br />* Color Coordinate The Layout : Choosing the right color scheme that sends across the right message is crucial for a good web design. A website run by a doctors’ association cannot play around with loud colors while a music website cannot look dull. Only the right color combination will convey the right message.
<br /><br />* Keep it Simple : The golden rule for designers is to always keep things simple. Do not overdo either with the colors or with the layout. You cannot have everything on the home page nor can you have too less. Striking the right balance will appeal the users. The sites should have minimal ads, more content with images and multimedia and should be interactive and that is it.
<br /><br />We hope that these tips help you build better websites.

With the help of <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3dvcmRwcmVzcy5waXhlbGNyYXlvbnMuY29tLw__" target="_blank">WordPress web development</a></strong> you can design any kind of website without much difficulty. However there is one thing that often pulls down the greatness of the CMS and that is its loading time of the website on a server. WordPress is known for becoming slow as your blog becomes heavy with content. By using more plugins you further run the risk of slowing the site. What is the solution to counter this? In the list given below we have listed a few plugins that can help in making your WordPress blog run faster.
<br /><br /><strong>W3-Total Cache:</strong> To cater to a heavy traffic flow into the site, this plugin is a must have. W3-Total Cache lets you create static cached files thus reducing the time taken to load PHP and other scripts file every time the blog site is accessed. What makes W3-Total Cache one of the best tools to make a blog faster is that apart from caching files it also lets you use CDN created media files. With the help of this tool you can also remove unnecessary white spaces. Having these white spaces means that a server takes more time to load.
<br /><br /><strong>Plugins from Google Libraries:</strong> With the help of Google’s AJAX Libraries API, you can easily access many of the JavaScript libraries that are distributed with WordPress. When you access the libraries via Google, you do not need to serve them from your own WordPress directory. Using the Google libraries has several benefits. Most importantly it takes away the load from your server, secondly the chances of finding cached files in users’ computers increase and thirdly you can also access the compressed versions of certain libraries.
<br /><br /><strong>WP-DBManager:</strong> The best way to make a site fast is to keep the database uncluttered. The WP-DBManager offers such a plugin which allows you to find simple solutions to fix databases, optimize them and empty unused tables from the blog. By keeping your database updated you also reduce the risk of scripting errors. One of the added advantages of this plugin is that it lets you schedule database backups.
<br /><br /><strong>CDN Tools:</strong> Taking the help of a content distribution network, you can improve the loading speed of your blog. You can use CDN tools by allowing parts of your blog to be loaded from the closest server possible to each user. To use this plugin, you have to select the CDN service you want to use from a given Primary CDN field and enter your username and API secret key.
<br /><br /><strong>WP-Optimize:</strong> This plugin works great for optimizing the WordPress setup and clearing out unnecessary stuffs from the database. With the help of this plugin, you can enhance WordPress <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2Ntcy5waXhlbGNyYXlvbnMuY29tLw__" target="_blank">cms development</a></strong>. The program allows you to clear out old posts, auto drafts, and spammed comments. The plugin can also clear unapproved comments and all this happens with a single click of the mouse. By clearing the database, you increase the efficiency of the blog.
