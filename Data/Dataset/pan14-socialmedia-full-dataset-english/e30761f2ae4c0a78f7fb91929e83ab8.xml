In the TCM system of medicine, the body is seen as a delicate balance of two opposing and inseparable forces: yin and yang. Yin represents the cold, slow, or passive principle, while yang represents the hot, excited, or active principle. Among the major assumptions in TCM are that health is achieved by maintaining the body in a balanced state and that disease is due to an internal imbalance of yin and yang. This imbalance leads to blockage in the flow of qi (vital energy) along pathways known as meridians . It is believed that there are 12 main meridians and 8 secondary meridians and that there are more than 2,000 acupuncture points on the human body that connect with them. <br /><br />These days, people are looking for healthier and more natural treatments for these conditions. Nobody wants to be drugged into feeling better; they increasingly prefer deep breathing exercises, meditation, dietary modification and acupuncture to ease the symptoms.

Common side effects associated with them include fatigue, dizziness, gastrointestinal discomfort and decreased sexual ability.

Hypertension is typically caused by a disharmony of the Liver organ in Oriental Medicine. It is important to understand that this refers to an energetic function of the Liver and not necessarily the physical liver in the body. The Liver is responsible for the smooth flow of energy, called Qi, in the body, and the regulation of the Blood.The most typical patterns causing hypertension include: Liver Yang Rising, Liver Qi Stagnation, and Liver and Kidney Yin Deficiency. <br /><br />Wheezing is a whistling sound that occurs during breathing, usually during expiration through narrowed airways. Inflammation of the airways, bronchospasm (tightening of the muscles around the bronchial tubes), and hypersensitivity (reactivity to triggers such as allergens, irritants, or infections) all play a role in the development of wheezing. <br /><br />LEKOMAT monitor for home treatment of kidney disease works on the principle of modern acupuncture needles without pain free and feel improvements after only a day or two.

The spinning sensation of vertigo may be accompanied by other symptoms, including nausea and vomiting. <br /><br />The latest researches in medical science have suggested a number of treatment options to lower high blood pressure. Today, high blood pressure or hypertension is a very commonly found health problem, which is mainly caused by a stressful lifestyle. This health condition is also associated with obesity, aging, alcoholism, smoking and certain diseases such as diabetes or kidney diseases. People with high blood pressure experience symptoms such as shortness of breath, headache, nausea, restlessness, fatigue and blurred vision. Uncontrolled high blood pressure can cause certain complications such as heart attack, stroke, renal failure, metabolic syndrome and vision loss. <br /><br />Fever is part of the body's own disease-fighting arsenal. Rising body temperatures apparently are capable of killing off many disease-producing organisms. For that reason, low fevers should normally go untreated. Although, if the fever is accompanied by any other troubling symptoms, you may need to see your doctor to be certain. <br /><br />The exact workings of this old natural art are still not well understood.
