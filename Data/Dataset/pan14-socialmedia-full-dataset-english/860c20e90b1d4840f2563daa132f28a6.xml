<br />Sometime of Interamna, which is called Ferni,
<br />Now of the delightful Court of Heaven,
<br />I respectfully salute you,
<br />I genuflect
<br />And I kiss your episcopal ring. 
<br /><br />It is not, Monsignore,
<br />The fragrant memory of your holy life,
<br />Nor that of your shining and joyous martyrdom,
<br />Which causes me now to address you.
<br />But since this is your august festival, Monsignore,
<br />It seems appropriate to me to state
<br />According to a venerable and agreeable custom,
<br />That I love a beautiful lady.
<br />Her eyes, Monsignore,
<br />Are so blue that they put lovely little blue reflections
<br />On everything that she looks at,
<br />Such as a wall
<br />Or the moon
<br />Or my heart.
<br />It is like the light coming through blue stained glass,
<br />Yet not quite like it,
<br />For the blueness is not transparent,
<br />Only translucent.
<br />Her soul's light shines through,
<br />But her soul cannot be seen.
<br />It is something elusive, whimsical, tender, wanton, infantile, wise
<br />And noble.
<br />She wears, Monsignore, a blue garment,
<br />Made in the manner of the Japanese.
<br />It is very blue-
<br />I think that her eyes have made it more blue,
<br />Sweetly staining it
<br />As the pressure of her body has graciously given it form.
<br />Loving her, Monsignore,
<br />I love all her attributes;
<br />But I believe
<br />That even if I did not love her
<br />I would love the blueness of her eyes,
<br />And her blue garment, made in the manner of the Japanese. 
<br /><br />Monsignore,
<br />I have never before troubled you with a request.
<br />The saints whose ears I chiefly worry with my pleas
<br />are the most exquisite and maternal Brigid,
<br />Gallant Saint Stephen, who puts fire in my blood,
<br />And your brother bishop, my patron,
<br />The generous and jovial Saint Nicholas of Bari.
<br />But, of your courtesy, Monsignore,
<br />Do me this favour:
<br />When you this morning make your way
<br />To the Ivory Throne that bursts into bloom with roses
<br />because of her who sits upon it,
<br />When you come to pay your devoir to Our Lady,
<br />I beg you, say to her:
<br />&quot;Madame, a poor poet, one of your singing servants yet on earth,
<br />Has asked me to say that at this moment he is especially grateful to you
<br />For wearing a blue gown&quot;.

<br />...Not in lone splendour hung aloft the night
<br />And watching, with eternal lids apart,
<br />...Like nature's patient, sleepless Eremite,
<br />The moving waters at their priestlike task
<br />...Of pure ablution round earth's human shores,
<br />Or gazing on the new soft fallen mask
<br />...Of snow upon the mountains and the moors--
<br />No--yet still steadfast, still unchangeable,
<br />...Pillow'd upon my fair love's ripening breast,
<br />To feel for ever its soft fall and swell,
<br />...Awake for ever in a sweet unrest,
<br />Still, still to hear her tender-taken breath,
<br />...And so live ever--or else swoon to death.

<br />Is new and neat and adequately tall;
<br />I tie the noose on in a knowing way
<br />As one that knots his necktie for a ball;
<br />But just as all the neighbours on the wall 
<br />Are drawing a long breath to shout &quot;Hurray!&quot;
<br />The strangest whim has seized me. . . After all
<br />I think I will not hang myself to-day.
<br /><br />To-morrow is the time I get my pay
<br />My uncle's sword is hanging in the hall
<br />I see a little cloud all pink and grey
<br />Perhaps the rector's mother will NOT call
<br />I fancy that I heard from Mr. Gall
<br />That mushrooms could be cooked another way
<br />I never read the works of Juvenal
<br />I think I will not hang myself to-day.
<br /><br />The world will have another washing-day;
<br />The decadents decay; the pedants pall;
<br />And H.G. Wells has found that children play,
<br />And Bernard Shaw discovered that they squall;
<br />Rationalists are growing rational
<br />And through thick woods one finds a stream astray,
<br />So secret that the very sky seems small
<br />I think I will not hang myself to-day.

<br />Its loveliness increases; it will never
<br />Pass into nothingness; but still will keep
<br />A bower quiet for us, and a sleep
<br />Full of sweet dreams, and health, and quiet breathing.
<br /><br />Therefore, on every morrow, are we wreathing
<br />A flowery band to bind us to the earth,
<br />Spite of despondence, of the inhuman dearth
<br />Of noble natures, of the gloomy days,
<br />Of all the unhealthy and o'er-darkened ways
<br />Made for our searching: yes, in spite of all,
<br />Some shape of beauty moves away the pall
<br />From our dark spirits. Such the sun, the moon,
<br />Trees old, and young, sprouting a shady boon
<br />For simple sheep; and such are daffodils
<br />With the green world they live in; and clear rills
<br />That for themselves a cooling covert make
<br />'Gainst the hot season; the mid-forest brake,
<br />Rich with a sprinkling of fair musk-rose blooms:
<br />And such too is the grandeur of the dooms
<br />We have imagined for the mighty dead;
<br />All lovely tales that we have heard or read:
<br />An endless fountain of immortal drink,
<br />Pouring unto us from the heaven's brink.
<br /><br />Nor do we merely feel these essences
<br />For one short hour; no, even as the trees
<br />That whisper round a temple become soon
<br />Dear as the temple's self, so does the moon,
<br />The passion poesy, glories infinite,
<br />Haunt us till they become a cheering light
<br />Unto our souls, and bound to us so fast
<br />That, whether there be shine or gloom o'ercast,
<br />They always must be with us, or we die.
<br /><br />Therefore, 'tis with full happiness that I
<br />Will trace the story of Endymion.
<br />The very music of the name has gone
<br />Into my being, and each pleasant scene
<br />Is growing fresh before me as the green
<br />Of our own valleys: so I will begin
<br />Now while I cannot hear the city's din;
<br />Now while the early budders are just new,
<br />And run in mazes of the youngest hue
<br />About old forests; while the willow trails
<br />Its delicate amber; and the dairy pails
<br />Bring home increase of milk. And, as the year
<br />Grows lush in juicy stalks, I'll smoothly steer
<br />My little boat, for many quiet hours,
<br />With streams that deepen freshly into bowers.
<br />Many and many a verse I hope to write,
<br />Before the daisies, vermeil rimmed and white,
<br />Hide in deep herbage; and ere yet the bees
<br />Hum about globes of clover and sweet peas,
<br />I must be near the middle of my story.
<br />O may no wintry season, bare and hoary,
<br />See it half finished: but let Autumn bold,
<br />With universal tinge of sober gold,
<br />Be all about me when I make an end!
<br />And now at once, adventuresome, I send
<br />My herald thought into a wilderness:
<br />There let its trumpet blow, and quickly dress
<br />My uncertain path with green, that I may speed
<br />Easily onward, thorough flowers and weed.

<br />the road precisely a road, the horizon fixed, 
<br />the limit of what could be seen, 
<br />a glass of wine was no more than a glass of wine.
<br /><br />With you the world took on the spectrum
<br />radiating from my heart: your eyes gold
<br />as they open to me, slate the color
<br />that falls each time I lost all hope.
<br /><br />With your advent roses burst into flame: 
<br />you were the artist of dried-up leaves, sorceress
<br />who flicked her wrist to change dust into soot.
<br />You lacquered the night black.
<br /><br />As for the sky, the road, the cup of wine: 
<br />one was my tear-drenched shirt, 
<br />the other an aching nerve, 
<br />the third a mirror that never reflected the same thing.
<br /><br />Now you are here again—stay with me.
<br />This time things will fall into place; 
<br />the road can be the road, 
<br />the sky nothing but sky; 
<br />the glass of wine, as it should be, the glass of wine.

<br />O come Georgiana! the rose is full blown,
<br />The riches of Flora are lavishly strown,
<br />The air is all softness, and crystal the streams,
<br />The West is resplendently clothed in beams.
<br /><br />2.
<br />O come! let us haste to the freshening shades,
<br />The quaintly carv'd seats, and the opening glades;
<br />Where the faeries are chanting their evening hymns,
<br />And in the last sun-beam the sylph lightly swims.
<br /><br />3.
<br />And when thou art weary I'll find thee a bed,
<br />Of mosses and flowers to pillow thy head:
<br />And there Georgiana I'll sit at thy feet,
<br />While my story of love I enraptur'd repeat.
<br /><br />4.
<br />So fondly I'll breathe, and so softly I'll sigh,
<br />Thou wilt think that some amorous Zephyr is nigh:
<br />Yet no -- as I breathe I will press thy fair knee,
<br />And then thou wilt know that the sigh comes from me.
<br /><br />5.
<br />Ah! why dearest girl should we lose all these blisses?
<br />That mortal's a fool who such happiness misses:
<br />So smile acquiescence, and give me thy hand,
<br />With love-looking eyes, and with voice sweetly bland.

<br />A mortal foe and enemy to rest, 
<br />An envious boy, from whom all cares arise, 
<br />A bastard vile, a beast with rage possessed, 
<br />A way of error, a temple full of treason, 
<br />In all effects contrary unto reason. 
<br /><br />A poisoned serpent covered all with flowers, 
<br />Mother of sighs, and murderer of repose, 
<br />A sea of sorrows whence are drawn such showers 
<br />As moisture lend to every grief that grows; 
<br />A school of guile, a net of deep deceit, 
<br />A gilded hook that holds a poisoned bait. 
<br /><br />A fortress foiled, which reason did defend, 
<br />A siren song, a fever of the mind, 
<br />A maze wherein affection finds no end, 
<br />A raging cloud that runs before the wind, 
<br />A substance like the shadow of the sun, 
<br />A goal of grief for which the wisest run. 
<br /><br />A quenchless fire, a nurse of trembling fear, 
<br />A path that leads to peril and mishap, 
<br />A true retreat of sorrow and despair, 
<br />An idle boy that sleeps in pleasure's lap, 
<br />A deep mistrust of that which certain seems, 
<br />A hope of that which reason doubtful deems. 
<br /><br />Sith* then thy trains my younger years betrayed,[since] 
<br />And for my faith ingratitude I find; 
<br />And sith repentance hath my wrongs bewrayed*,[revealed] 
<br />Whose course was ever contrary to kind*:[nature] 
<br />False love, desire, and beauty frail, adieu. 
<br />Dead is the root whence all these fancies grew. 
<br /><br />Sir Walter Raleigh

<br /><br />2. Men have died from time to time, and worms have eaten them, but not for love.
<br /><br />3. Love is not love that alters when it alteration finds.
<br /><br />4. If thou remember not the slightest folly into which loves hast made thee run, though hast not loved.
<br /><br />5. But love is blind and lovers cannot see the pretty follies that themselves commit; for if they could, Cupid himself would blush to see me thus transformed to a boy.
<br /><br />6. If music be the food of love, play on.
<br /><br />7. Shall I compare thee to a summer day? Thou art more lovely and more temperate… When in eternal lines to time thou growst So long as men can breathe or eyes can see, So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
<br /><br />8. Love asks me no questions, and gives me endless support…
<br /><br />9. Things base and vile, holding no quantity, Love can transpose to form and dignity. Love looks not with the eye, but with the mind, and therefore is winged Cupid painted blind.
<br /><br />10. The courses of true love never did run smooth.
<br /><br />11. So dear I love him that with him, all deaths I could endure. Without him, lives no life.
<br /><br />12. To me, fair friend, you never can be old, for as you were when first your eyes I eyed, such seems your beauty still.
<br /><br />13. Doubt that the stars are fire; Doubt that the sun doth move; Doubt truth to be a liar; But never doubt I love
