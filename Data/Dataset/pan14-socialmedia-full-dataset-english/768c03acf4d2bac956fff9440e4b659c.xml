His legions of fans have saved him from the drop week in week out, but even they couldn't forgive a miserly total of 19 points scored on Monday night (April 16, 2012) and - after the dance-off last night - his 'Dancing' tenure was finally brought to an end, reports the Los Angeles Times.
<br />DeGraw found himself in a dance-off with Jaleel White and, although he tried gamely, there was no way his cha cha to Lady Gaga's 'Edge Of Glory' was ever going to defeat the far superior White, throwing his moves at the same time and - to the disappointment of the show's <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jYXJyZXJhZ2xhc3Nlc3N0b3JlLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> carrera sunglasses</a> bosses no doubt, who would've hoped for a more tense dance-off - it was clear he was on his way home.
<br />Other highlights of the show included Maria Menounos and Derek Hough being invited back for the Encore Dance following their steamy performance the previous night during which the TV host planted a big smacker right on the lips of her professional partner. This time round the love wasn't contained to just them, and judges Carrie Ann Inaba and Bruno Tonioli both received <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jYXJyZXJhZ2xhc3Nlc3N0b3JlLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.carreraglassesstore.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.carreraglassesstore.com</a></a> smooches from the pair, with judge Len Goodman playing the gooseberry.

<br />The move announced Sunday is the latest sign of souring relations between the Camp David peace treaty partners. Egypt accuses Israel of failing to make payments on gas deliveries in recent months. Israel denies the claim.
<br />Shipments have been interrupted more than dozen times over the last year due to sabotage attacks and explosions along the pipeline through the Sinai Peninsula.
<br />The deal, signed in 2005, is viewed in Egypt as a symbol of the corruption of the previous regime. Political and religious figures have called for its termination ever since former President Hosni Mubarak was toppled last year.
<br />Critics <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jYXJyZXJhZ2xhc3Nlc3N0b3JlLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> carrera sunglasses</a> claimed that Mubarak gave Israel below-market rates for the gas, which at one point covered about 40% of Israel's needs.
<br />Over the last year, Israel has scrambled to offset declining deliveries from Egypt by increasing its domestic production, but energy officials warn that a complete termination of supplies from Egypt may lead to power disruptions this summer.
<br />Israeli and Egyptian officials stressed that the dispute is purely commercial and will not affect diplomatic relations. But others view the conflict as a further distancing between the two countries, which could affect their 1979 peace accord.
<br />Israeli opposition leader Shaul Mofaz told Israeli media Sunday that Egypt's decision marked &quot;a <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jYXJyZXJhZ2xhc3Nlc3N0b3JlLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.carreraglassesstore.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.carreraglassesstore.com</a></a> new low in the relations between the countries and a clear violation of the peace treaty.&quot;

<br />Executives from Wal-Mart’s Mexican subsidiary reportedly used systematic bribery to receive building permits across the country, according to The New York Times story that broke the news Saturday. After Wal-Mart learned about the bribes, it stalled an internal investigation into the situation and failed to promptly report the problems to the government. The Wal-Mart executive described by The Times as the man directing the illegal operations, Eduardo Castro-Wright,  now serves as a vice president at the company, set to retire in July.
<br />Wal-Mart is meeting with the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission. If the allegations prove true, Wal-Mart violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), legislation that allows investigators to charge a U.S. company with bribing overseas officials. After a decade of carefully encouraging companies to report misbehavior early, the Justice Department  may be under pressure to make an example of Wal-Mart.
<br /> “We take compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act very seriously and are committed to having a strong <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jYXJyZXJhZ2xhc3Nlc3N0b3JlLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> carrera sunglasses</a> and effective global anti-corruption program in every country in which we operate,” company spokesman David Tovar said in a statement.
<br />A UBS analysis of past FCPA violations show a typical investigation slogs on for two to six years with little day-to-day impact on the offending company’s operations. Past SEC and Justice Department penalties are usually about 1% to 2% of annual sales. In 2011, this would mean at least a $4.5 billion, or 77 cents per share, penalty for Wal-Mart, the world’s largest retailer and the biggest private employer in Mexico.
<br />The greater impact will be on Wal-Mart’s Mexican growth. A slowdown in new store openings could mean a 5% decrease in growth, a $1.3 billion loss, according to the UBS analysis. Wal-Mart has beaten rivals to the Mexican market. Its store count there has soared 135% in five years, as the market now accounts for 6% of total revenue.
<br />Wal-Mart stock has lagged behind the broader market rally since 2009. Wal-Mart has rebounded about 25%, nearly a third of the growth experienced by the S&amp;amp;P 500 index. The retailer, which competes with such companies as Target, Costco and Sears Holding, trades at 14 times trailing earnings.
<br />“The headline risk that had been wrung from Wal-Mart’s shares, say from 2008 to last week, looks to be back in the fold,” says Brian Sozzi, NBG chief equities analyst.
<br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jYXJyZXJhZ2xhc3Nlc3N0b3JlLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.carreraglassesstore.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.carreraglassesstore.com</a></a> Wal-Mart shares were down 4.8%, at 8:50 a.m., to $59.55.

<br />Harden was initially cleared to return to the game by the Thunder doctors, but that diagnosis was overruled when it was determined he was suffering from the effects of a concussion. Now, as Darnell Mayberry of the Oklahoman explains, it could be awhile until Harden is able to rejoin his teammates.
<br />Under the NBA's newly instituted concussion policy, Harden can return to the court only after passing a rigorous evaluation process that could take several days. Once he's considered free of concussion symptoms, Harden must make it through increasing stages of exertion -- from riding a stationary bike, to jogging, to agility work, to individual basketball skills -- while ensuring the symptoms don't return after each stage.
<br />If Harden passes each test the team then has to consult with Dr. Jeffrey Kutcher, the director of the NBA's concussion program, to determine when Harden can return. The NBA's concussion policy went into effect at the start of training camps this season.
<br />There's no telling how long it will take Harden to recover, considering some players have returned just a few days after the initial impact while it takes others months to show that they're free of the symptoms. Hopefully Harden is a member of the former group rather than the latter.
<br />For more on Harden and the Thunder, head over to Welcome to Loud City. Be sure to stick with SB Nation NBA for the latest on the fallout from Sunday's incident as it <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jYXJyZXJhZ2xhc3Nlc3N0b3JlLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.carreraglassesstore.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.carreraglassesstore.com</a></a> becomes available.

		<document id="e4860053b7ee948a04dda284fd4b5984" url=""><![CDATA[Former Liberian President Charles Taylor guilty of aiding an<br/><br/>LONDON -- In a landmark case, former Liberian President Charles Taylor has been convicted of aiding and abetting war crimes and crimes against humanity through his arming of ruthless rebel groups in neighboring Sierra Leone in exchange for so-called blood diamonds.
<br />An international war crimes tribunal announced Thursday that it had found Taylor guilty of &amp;amp;quot;sustained and significant&amp;amp;quot; support for the rebels who engaged in a long campaign of terror, murder, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jYXJyZXJhZ2xhc3Nlc3N0b3JlLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> carrera sunglasses</a> rape, sexual slavery and enlistment of child soldiers. However, he was found not guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of ordering those abuses himself.
<br />Still, it was a milestone verdict in a case that has been seen as an important test of the international justice system. Taylor, 64, is the first former head of state to have a judgment brought against him by an international court since the Nuremberg trials after World War II.
<br />The verdict followed a year of deliberations by the judges of the Special Court of Sierra Leone just outside The Hague. A sentencing hearing is scheduled for May 16; Taylor could be imprisoned for life.
<br />His trial <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jYXJyZXJhZ2xhc3Nlc3N0b3JlLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> carrera sunglasses</a>
<br />lasted five years, during which the court heard a catalog of horrific acts committed by rebels whom Taylor helped arm in Sierra Leone’s civil war. The war ended in 2002 after more than a decade of fighting and more than 50,000 deaths. The rebels backed by Taylor became particularly known for hacking off the limbs of their perceived enemies and carving words onto their bodies.
<br />They also recruited children to fight and terrorized the civilian population through rape, looting and burning down homes. Crucial to their campaign were the weapons they bought from Taylor and paid for with what came to be known as “conflict&amp;amp;quot; or &amp;amp;quot;blood&amp;amp;quot; diamonds, because of their role in fueling conflict in Africa.
<br />At one point during the trial, supermodel Naomi Campbell testified to receiving diamonds from Taylor at a banquet hosted by South African President Nelson Mandela. Actress Mia Farrow also testified regarding that incident.
<br />Taylor, a warlord-turned-elected president, was indicted in 2003, arrested in 2006 and eventually flown to The Hague for trial. Conducting the proceedings in Sierra Leone itself was deemed potentially too destabilizing for West Africa.
<br />Taylor pleaded innocent to 11 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity. He testified for seven months in his own defense, portraying himself as a statesman, peacemaker and victim of a witch hunt by “vindictive” former colonial powers intent on keeping him out of power. His lawyers acknowledged that terrible abuses took place during Sierra Leone’s civil war but argued that he was not responsible for them.
<br />The prosecution disagreed, describing him as the “godfather” of the rebels. Prosecutors called 94 witnesses and backed up its case with nearly 800 exhibits admitted into evidence. Taylor’s defense team called 21 witnesses.

<br />In a widely expected move, the ECB left its main overnight lending rate at 1%, a level the bank has maintained since late last year.
<br />The <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNoYWVsa29yc2hhbmRiYWdzb3V0bGV0d2ViLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> michael kors outlet </a> Governing Council of the Frankfurt-based ECB met in Barcelona as the economic outlook in the eurozone has deteriorated.
<br />Spain, for example, confirmed earlier this week that it officially slipped back into recession in the first quarter. Meanwhile,unemployment in the 17-nations that use the euro edged up to 10.9% in March -- the highest level since the common currency was introduced in 1999.
<br />Overall, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNoYWVsa29yc2hhbmRiYWdzb3V0bGV0d2ViLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> michael kors </a> the eurozone economy is widely expected to suffer a mild recession this year as austerity -- budget cuts and tax hikes -- take a toll on growth.
<br />Europe: 'Dark clouds on the horizon'
<br />In addition to Spain, several other eurozone economies already struggling with recession, including Italy, Ireland, Greece and Portugal.
<br />But there is increasing concern that austerity is actually doing more harm than good, and a growing number of policymakers have been calling for reforms to boost economic growth.
<br />To be sure, the ECB has taken unprecedented steps to support the economy.
<br />In two separate operations, the ECB funneled more than 1 trillion euros worth of ultra low-cost loans into the banking system. The two long-term refinancing operations, or LTROs, helped prevent a credit crunch in the banking system.
<br />The LTROs also appeared to drive down borrowing costs for troubled euro area governments including Italy and Spain. But the effects of the lending program have waned <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNoYWVsa29yc2hhbmRiYWdzb3V0bGV0d2ViLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.michaelkorshandbagsoutletweb.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.michaelkorshandbagsoutletweb.com</a> </a> and some investors are now calling for the ECB to do more.

<br />The <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNoYWVsa29yc2hhbmRiYWdzb3V0bGV0d2ViLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> michael kors handbags </a> dramatic drop - $US5 per barrel by midday on Friday - is easing fears that high energy prices would cripple a US economy that is struggling to overcome high unemployment, stagnant wages and weak growth.
<br />The catalyst was Friday’s weaker than expected report on job growth in the US that added to recent signs that the global economy is weakening, meaning demand for oil should slow.
<br />Earlier <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNoYWVsa29yc2hhbmRiYWdzb3V0bGV0d2ViLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> michael kors outlet </a> this year, world oil demand looked to be rising quickly at the same time that world supplies were threatened by a host of small production outages and the prospect of drastically reduced production from Iran, the world’s third biggest exporter.
<br />Those developments raised the prospect that world supplies would be at their most tenuous just as the summer driving season in the developed world was arriving. The price of the US benchmark oil rose to $US110.
<br />International oil spiked even higher, to $US128 per barrel. Petrol prices in the US appeared to be on track to soar past $US4 per gallon nationwide and break the 2008 record of $US4.11.
<br />That picture has now been turned upside down. World oil supplies are growing while demand is falling. US petrol prices have fallen to $US3.80 per gallon from a peak of $US3.94 in early April. Now they could go as low as $US3.50 per gallon by July 4, according to Tom Kloza, Chief Oil Analyst at the Oil Price Information Service.
<br />On <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNoYWVsa29yc2hhbmRiYWdzb3V0bGV0d2ViLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> michael kors </a> Friday, Benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude fell $US4.83 to $US97.70 in afternoon trading on Friday. That’s a drop of 4.7 per cent.
<br />Oil prices have been falling since Wednesday because of a renewed focus on the economy. The Labor Department said on Friday that the US economy added just 115,000 jobs in April - far fewer than the pace of hiring earlier this year. Government data show that US oil consumption dropped 5.3 per cent in the first quarter.
<br />Meanwhile, supplies have been growing for the past six weeks and hit a 22-year high in Cushing, Oklahoma, where benchmark crude is delivered.
<br />The European economy also is slowing down as governments on that continent struggle with oppressive debt.
<br />‘‘We’re fearful that the economy is slowing more than we originally thought,’’ PFGBest analyst Phil Flynn said.
<br />US oil prices haven’t dropped this much since December 14, 2011, when the benchmark price fell by $US5.19, or 5.2 per cent, to $US94.95 per barrel.
<br />The price of the US benchmark crude has crossed the $US100 mark 21 times during the past year. It rose as high as $US109.77 on February 24 this year. Last year it rose to $US113.93 per barrel April and <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNoYWVsa29yc2hhbmRiYWdzb3V0bGV0d2ViLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.michaelkorshandbagsoutletweb.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.michaelkorshandbagsoutletweb.com</a> </a> fell as low as $US75.67 per barrel on October 4.
<br />Brent crude, which is used to set the price of oil imported into the US, lost $US1.98 to $US114.10 per barrel.

<br />Of <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNoYWVsa29yc2hhbmRiYWdzb3V0bGV0d2ViLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> michael kors handbags </a> the 137 Derbys run so far, nearly half — 63 — experienced rain at some point during the day, according to the National Weather Service office in Louisville.
<br />Nevertheless, the generally good weather experienced in early May is a primary reason the Derby is run on the first Saturday of the month. The average temperature for Louisville in early May is 74 or 75 degrees.
<br />The Kentucky Derby has never been canceled because of weather, although it was postponed to June 9 in 1945 because of a wartime ban on racing.
<br />In its first decade, the Derby was run in the latter half of the month, with dates ranging from May 15 in 1876 to May 23 in 1883.
<br />But <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNoYWVsa29yc2hhbmRiYWdzb3V0bGV0d2ViLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> michael kors outlet </a> when Matt Winn and several other men purchased the financially troubled Churchill Downs in 1902 for $40,000, he wanted to turn the Derby into a tradition, and he wanted a good day for it.
<br />Winn studied the weather conditions of Louisville as far back as he could and determined that the first Saturday in May was the prettiest day of spring.
<br />Sure enough, the skies were clear and the track was deemed fast for the Derby on May 2, 1903. The track turned a profit for the first time in its history that year, and Winn became general manager in 1904.
<br />But thunderstorms threatened the 1905, 1906 and 1908 Derbys, according to National Weather Service records.
<br />Today, some might question Winn's decision about the first Saturday in May. The longest stretch of consecutively dry Derby Days happened in the race's very beginning, from the first in 1875 to the 12th in 1886. Only a trace of precipitation was recorded on the 13th Derby in 1887.
<br />The <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNoYWVsa29yc2hhbmRiYWdzb3V0bGV0d2ViLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> michael kors </a> wettest Derby was in 1918, when 2.31 inches of rain fell — an inch of which fell from 1 to 7 p.m. It was the first Derby in 22 years in which the track was deemed &quot;muddy,&quot; but that didn't prevent Exterminator from winning by a length.
<br />A sloppy track means bettors must evaluate the race in a manner that gives preference to &quot;mudders,&quot; those horses that perform better on a wet surface.
<br />Take, for example, the 50-1 shot Mine That Bird in 2009. The gelding, ridden by Calvin Borel, shocked <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jYXJyZXJhLWdsYXNzZXMuY29t" target="_blank"> carrera sunglasses</a> everyone by skimming through the slop close to the rail and winning the Derby by 6¾ lengths. It was the largest margin of victory since Assault won by 8 lengths in 1946.
<br />Compare that to General Quarters, who came in 10th in 2009's field of 19 horses.
<br />&quot;He came back to the barn choking in mud,&quot; trainer Tom McCarthy said after the race. &quot;One eye was completely shut with mud. He coughed twice, and it popped out.&quot;
<br />In many cases, Derby horses don't have experience with mud, and it's impossible to tell how the 3-year-olds will react when the gate opens.
<br />&quot;It hits their belly and face,&quot; trainer Bob Baffert told The Associated Press in 2010. &quot;They throw their head up, they lose interest and they get scared.&quot;
<br />The longest stretch of consecutively wet Derby Days was from 1989 to 1994.
<br />Of the most miserable Derby Days, 1989 was among the worst. It rained lightly and then sleeted for about four minutes just after 1 p.m. It was 43 degrees at race time.
<br />A mint julep vendor who had been handling trays of the ice-filled drinks all day told the Herald-Leader: &quot;My fingers are so frozen, I can barely count my money. I'm afraid someone's going to grab my money and I won't even feel it.&quot;
<br />Arrests in the infield were well below normal that year as the cold put the kibosh on disorderly conduct, but sales of official Derby sweatshirts were up.
<br />Attendance for the 1989 Derby was 122,653, or about 15,000 less than the year before, when the high was in the low 80s.
<br />The coldest temperature recorded on Derby Day was 36 degrees in 1940 and 1957 (the Weather Service notes that the lows weren't necessarily at race time). The 1957 Derby was accompanied by 20 to 25 mph winds.
<br />At the opposite extreme, the warmest temperature recorded on Derby Day was 94 degrees in 1959. British Ambassador Sir Harold Caccia, in attendance that day, was quoted in the Lexington Herald as saying the warm, sunny weather was welcome compared to what was typical at the English Derby, or &quot;Darby.&quot;
<br />&quot;At the Darby, it's always raining,&quot; Caccia said.
<br />The <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNoYWVsa29yc2hhbmRiYWdzb3V0bGV0d2ViLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.michaelkorshandbagsoutletweb.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.michaelkorshandbagsoutletweb.com</a> </a> sports page of the Herald showed a from-the-neck-up photo of Bill Shoemaker, the jockey aboard 1959 winner Tomy Lee, enjoying a shower after the hot day.
<br />What this year's Derby will bring is anyone's guess. During the past 10 years, the weather has ranged from thunderstorms in 2010 to mostly sunny in 2002 and 2005.
<br />The only sure thing is this: Whatever the weather for Derby Day, umbrellas are a &quot;banned item&quot; and cannot be taken into Churchill Downs.

Look no further than Saturday evening's dazzling moonbeams. The full moon is taking its closest pass by Earth tonight, making it a &quot;super&quot; moon.
<br />The <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNoYWVsa29yc2hhbmRiYWdzb3V0bGV0d2ViLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> michael kors handbags </a>super moon will appear about 14 percent bigger and 30 percent brighter than normal full moons and will be the brightest of 2012.
<br />The source of the super moon's power: Its elliptical orbit. At 8:35 p.m., the full moon will reach the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNoYWVsa29yc2hhbmRiYWdzb3V0bGV0d2ViLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> michael kors outlet </a> part of its path that is closest to Earth, called it's perigee. Because of slight variability in its orbit, this perigee is the closest of all the perigees this year for the Earth's satellite. The result is a grand, golden orb.
<br />To <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNoYWVsa29yc2hhbmRiYWdzb3V0bGV0d2ViLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> michael kors </a> experience the gravity of its grandeur, NASA astronomers recommend viewing the super moon during moonrise, when the glowing disc emerges over mere terrestrial forms. Behind majestic trees or even towering skyscrapers, the super moon creates an inexplicable illusion that it's even larger than when it's hanging in the sky.
<br />The show starts about 8 p.m. Saturday. The super moon rises at 7:59 p.m. amid clear skies while the sun sets at 8:01 p.m. Though super moons sometimes get a bad rap -- particularly from werewolves and headless horsemen -- they mostly only use their powers for good. Super moons only raise tidewaters an insignificant inch or so, and they don't lead to a spike in beastly attacks.
<br />But the super moon does have to share its spotlight with other celestial events this month. May 20 <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNoYWVsa29yc2hhbmRiYWdzb3V0bGV0d2ViLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.michaelkorshandbagsoutletweb.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.michaelkorshandbagsoutletweb.com</a> </a> will host a new moon and a partial solar eclipse, and on May 21, Venus will be visible just north of the moon.

<br />&quot;Right then and there, I knew that this is what I wanted to do,&quot; James said Friday.
<br />On Saturday, the Miami Heat forward was set to get another MVP award — one that puts him on a list alongside seven of the game's absolute greats.
<br />A person familiar with the decision told The Associated Press that James will be announced as the winner of the NBA's top individual honor, and that he'll be formally presented the trophy by Commissioner David Stern on Sunday afternoon before Miami faces Indiana in Game 1 of their Eastern Conference semifinal series.
<br />James is winning the award for the third time in four seasons. Only Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Michael <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jYXJyZXJhLWdsYXNzZXMuY29t" target="_blank"> carrera sunglasses</a> Jordan, Bill Russell, Wilt Chamberlain, Larry Bird, Magic Johnson and Moses Malone have won at least that many MVP trophies.
<br />Abdul-Jabbar won six times, Jordan and Russell five times each, Chamberlain four times. After this weekend, they'll be the only players with more than James.
<br />&quot;I think LeBron is an MVP candidate every year,&quot; Boston Celtics coach Doc Rivers said last month. &quot;It's just who he is. He only does everything. So I don't know what more you can ask from him.
<br />&quot;LeBron, to me, is the favorite every year. The years he doesn't win it, it'll usually be because people are just tired of voting for him. Statistically, if you go all-around game, I don't know how you don't vote for him every year.&quot;
<br />James said last week that while another MVP award &quot;would be amazing and would be humbling,&quot; it's not <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNoYWVsa29yc2hhbmRiYWdzb3V0bGV0d2ViLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> michael kors outlet </a> what drives him. In his ninth season, James still has not won an NBA title and it's clear that, although he wanted to reclaim the MVP trophy, winning a championship is far and away his top basketball priority.
<br />&quot;I think he's probably as committed as he's ever been in his career,&quot; Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said this week, asked to summarize James' season. &quot;And he's always been committed. ... We all respond to his energy on the court.&quot;
<br />A news conference was scheduled to take place on the court at AmericanAirlines Arena after Saturday's Heat practice.
<br />James averaged 27.1 points, 7.9 rebounds and 6.2 assists — making him only the fourth player with those totals in at least two seasons, according to STATS LLC, joining Oscar Robertson (five times), John Havlicek (twice) and Bird (twice).
<br />Add James' 53 percent shooting and 1.9 steals per game into the mix, and the club gets even more exclusive. Only Jordan had a season with numbers exceeding what James did this season in those categories — 1988-89, when he averaged 32.5 points, eight rebounds, eight assists and 2.9 steals on 54 percent shooting.
<br />And Jordan wasn't even the MVP that year, the trophy going to Johnson instead.
<br />Voting results will be announced Saturday as well. Oklahoma City's Kevin Durant was widely expected to be James' top competition for the MVP, after winning the NBA scoring title for a third straight season. Chris Paul of the Los Angeles Clippers, Kobe Bryant of the Los Angeles Lakers and Tony Parker of the San Antonio Spurs also had seasons that generated some MVP buzz.
<br />James' teammates also lobbied for him to be defensive player of the year this season, noting that probably no one else in the league routinely plays four positions on offense while sometimes being asked to guard anyone from a point guard to a center on defense. James was fourth in that balloting.
<br />&quot;LeBron has been unbelievable,&quot; Heat guard Dwyane Wade told The AP before the playoffs. &quot;He's done it at both ends, every night, offensively and defensively.&quot;
<br />Last season's MVP, Derrick Rose of the Chicago Bulls, appeared in only 39 of 66 regular-season games this season because of a variety of injuries. His season ended in Game 1 of the Bulls' first-round series against Philadelphia, when he tore a knee ligament.
<br />Many in the Heat organization thought James should have won the award a year ago as well, when he <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNoYWVsa29yc2hhbmRiYWdzb3V0bGV0d2ViLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> michael kors </a> dealt with constant fallout from &quot;The Decision&quot; to leave the Cleveland Cavaliers as a free agent and sign with Miami, where he, Wade and Chris Bosh formed a &quot;Big Three&quot; that has been celebrated at home and reviled in just about every other NBA arena.
<br />James has said he played more out of anger and to silence criticism than anything else last season. So this season, his mindset changed, with him trying to revert to old ways, first as a superstar-in-waiting at St. Vincent-St. Mary High School in his hometown of Akron, Ohio, then during his seven seasons with the Cavaliers.
<br />It apparently worked.
<br />&quot;I wanted to get back to who I was as a person,&quot; James said.
<br />It's the first time that the Heat will be hosting an MVP celebration.
<br />Shaquille O'Neal won his only MVP award before coming to Miami, and James won the 2009 and <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNoYWVsa29yc2hhbmRiYWdzb3V0bGV0d2ViLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.michaelkorshandbagsoutletweb.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.michaelkorshandbagsoutletweb.com</a> </a> 2010 trophies with the Cavaliers — receiving 225 of a possible 244 first-place votes in those seasons.
<br />The NBA MVP trophy is named for Maurice Podoloff, the league's first commissioner. Heat assistant coach Bob McAdoo won the award once, for the Buffalo Braves in 1975.

Now the 30-year battle against AIDS is on the verge of a radical new phase, with the government expected to endorse a once-a-day pill to prevent infection with the virus.
<br />Some <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNoYWVsa29yc2hhbmRiYWdzb3V0bGV0d2ViLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> michael kors handbags </a> doctors already are giving patients the drug, Truvada, to ward off infection. But Food and Drug Administration approval would expand that practice and could make the expensive medicine more affordable. Truvada costs $11,000-$14,000 a year.
<br />The lifetime cost of treating one person diagnosed with the AIDS virus has been estimated at more than $600,000.
<br />Approval seems likely after an FDA advisory panel endorsed the use of Truvada for prevention Thursday.
<br />&amp;quot;With this recommendation, we're nearing a watershed moment in our fight against HIV,&amp;quot; said James Loduca, a spokesman for the San Francisco AIDS Foundation. &amp;quot;We know this isn't a magic bullet, and it's not going to be the right prevention strategy for everyone, but it could save thousands of lives in the United States and potentially millions around the world.&amp;quot;
<br />Since 2004, Truvada has been FDA-approved for treating people infected with AIDS. Once a drug is on the market, doctors are free to prescribe it for off-label, or unapproved, uses, and that's what some have <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jYXJyZXJhLWdsYXNzZXMuY29t" target="_blank"> carrera sunglasses</a> been doing in giving Truvada to patients who are healthy but in danger of getting the virus from their partners or through risky sex.
<br />Official FDA backing of the practice would allow Truvada's maker, Gilead Sciences of Foster City, Calif., to market it for prevention. Approval probably would spur many more insurance companies to pay for the drug. And widening the market for Truvada could prompt Gilead to lower the price.
<br />An FDA decision is expected by June 15.
<br />In one U.S. government study of more than 1,200 men and women in Botswana, Truvada lowered the HIV <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNoYWVsa29yc2hhbmRiYWdzb3V0bGV0d2ViLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> michael kors outlet </a> infection risk about 78%. Another larger study in Africa found a slightly lower rate of effectiveness, but researchers say that if used as directed, the pill can be 90% effective or higher.
<br />An estimated 1.2 million Americans and millions more around the world have HIV. Unless the virus is treated with antiviral drugs, it can turn into full-blown AIDS. Antivirals made the disease more manageable and allowed patients to live much longer than when the epidemic began in the early 1980s.
<br />Nevertheless, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNoYWVsa29yc2hhbmRiYWdzb3V0bGV0d2ViLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> michael kors </a> about 50,000 new infections are diagnosed in the U.S. each year, a number that has held steady for about 15 years.
<br />Truvada represents &amp;quot;a pretty radical step, but I think it's a necessary step,&amp;quot; said Dr. Lisa Sterman of San Francisco, who treats HIV patients. She prescribes the drug to infected patients and those who are healthy but at risk.
<br />&amp;quot;We've come as far as we can with condom use and safe-sex strategies.&amp;quot;
<br />The FDA also is considering approving the first over-the-counter HIV test for use at home.
<br />FDA reviewers said Friday that the OraQuick In-Home HIV test could play a significant role in slowing the spread of HIV, according to briefing documents posted online. But they also raised concerns about the accuracy of the test, a mouth swab that returns results in about 20 minutes.
<br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNoYWVsa29yc2hhbmRiYWdzb3V0bGV0d2ViLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.michaelkorshandbagsoutletweb.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.michaelkorshandbagsoutletweb.com</a> </a> Public health experts estimate one-fifth of the 1.2 million HIV carriers in the U.S. -- about 240,000 people -- are not aware they are infected.

<br />In addition to a still vibrant scene of a king and his retinue, the walls are rife with calculations that helped ancient scribes track vast amounts of time. Contrary to the idea the Maya predicted the end of the world in 2012, the markings suggest dates thousands of years in the future.
<br />Perhaps most important, the otherwise humble chamber offers a rare glimpse into the inner workings of Maya society. (Video: &quot;Mysterious Maya Calendar &amp; Mural Uncovered.&quot<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/wink.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />&quot;The paintings we have here—we've never found them anyplace else,&quot; excavation leader William Saturno told National Geographic News.
<br />And in today's Xultún—to the untrained eye, just 6 square miles (16 square kilometers) of jungle floor—it's a wonder Saturno's team found the artwork at all.
<br />At the Guatemalan site in 2010 the Boston University archaeologist and Ph.D. student Franco Rossi were inspecting a looters' tunnel, where an undergraduate student had noticed the faintest traces of paint on a thin stucco wall.
<br />The pair began cleaning off 1,200-year-old mud and suddenly a little more red paint appeared.
<br />&quot;Suddenly Bill was like, 'Oh my God, we have a glyph!'&quot; Rossi said.
<br />What the team found, after a full excavation in 2011, is likely the ancient workroom of a Maya scribe, a record-keeper of Xultún.
<br />&quot;The reason this room's so interesting,&quot; said Rossi, as he crouched in the chamber late last year, &quot;is that ... <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jYXJyZXJhLWdsYXNzZXMuY29t" target="_blank"> carrera sunglasses</a> this was a workspace. People were seated on this bench&quot; painting books that have long since disintegrated.
<br />The books would have been filled with elaborate calculations intended to predict the city's fortunes. The numbers on the wall were &quot;fixed tabulations that they can then refer to—tables more or less like those in the back of your chemistry book,&quot; he added.
<br />&quot;Undoubtedly this type of room exists at every Maya site in the Late Classic [period] and probably earlier, but it's our only example thus far.&quot;
<br />Maya Twilight
<br />Its facade long ago erased by erosion and creeping plant life, the scribe's chamber was once part of a small <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNoYWVsa29yc2hhbmRiYWdzb3V0bGV0d2ViLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> michael kors outlet </a>building just off a massive Maya plaza circled by pyramids, where kings and high priests conducted ceremonies and peddlers likely sold the clay pots whose fragments now litter the forest site.
<br />Discovered in 1915, the sprawling city was just five miles (eight kilometers) from another Maya metropolis, San Bartolo, which became famous when Saturno uncovered stunning, 2,000-year-old Maya murals there about a decade ago.
<br />Beyond the two cities, the Maya civilization spanned much of what are now Guatemala, Belize, and Mexico's Yucatán region. Around A.D. 900 the Classic Maya centers, including Xultún, collapsed after a series of droughts and perhaps political conflicts. (Read about the rise and fall of the Maya in National Geographic magazine.)
<br />The apparent desperation of those final years may have played out on the walls of the newly revealed room—the only major excavation so far in Xultún.
<br />A &quot;Different Mindset,&quot; Etched in Ancient Stucco
<br />Despite past looting, the interior of the newfound room is nearly perfectly preserved.
<br />Among the artworks on the three intact walls is a detailed orange painting of a man wearing white disks on his head and chest—likely the scribe himself, said Saturno, who received funding from the National Geographic Society'sCommittee for Research and Exploration and Expeditions Council. (National Geographic News is a division of the Society.)
<br />Holding a paintbrush, the scribe is reaching out to the blue-feather-bedecked king, whose elaborate likeness was hidden behind a curtain attached to the wall by human bone, according to the study, published this week in the journalScience.
<br />But what was really interesting was what the team found next.
<br />Working with epigrapher David Stuart and archaeologist and artist Heather Hurst, the researchers noticed several barely visible hieroglyphic texts, painted and etched along the east and north walls of the room.
<br />One is a lunar table, and the other is a &quot;ring number&quot;—something previously known only from much later Maya books, where it was used as part of a backward calculation in establishing a base date for planetary cycles. Nearby is a sequence of numbered intervals corresponding to key calendrical and planetary cycles.
<br />The calculations include dates some 7,000 years in the future, adding to evidence against the idea that the Maya thought the world would end in 2012—a modern myth inspired by an ancient calendar that depicts time starting over this year. (Related pictures: &quot;2012 Doomsday Myths Debunked.&quot<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/wink.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />&quot;We keep looking for endings,&quot; expedition leader Saturno said in a statement. &quot;The Maya were looking for a guarantee that nothing would change. It's an entirely different mindset.&quot;
<br />Though the idea of cyclical time is nothing new in Maya studies, team member Rossi added, the Xultún mural is by far the earliest known expression of the concept.
<br />For example, he said while pointing to the ring number, &quot;this is something we don't see again for over 500 years.&quot;
<br />(See &quot;2012 Prophecies Sparking Real Fears, Suicide Warnings.&quot<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/wink.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />Now Is the Time
<br />The Maya at Xultún were likely less concerned with the end of the world than the end of their world, according to Mayan-writing expert David Freidel of Washington University in St. Louis.
<br />For ninth-century Maya, tabulating astronomical calendars to predict times of plenty was akin to gauging the stock market today, said Freidel, who wasn't involved in the new study.
<br />When the Mural was made, the Xultún region was facing &quot;a period of intense drought. In fact, cities were collapsing in various parts of the Maya world in this era,&quot; he said.
<br />&quot;The <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNoYWVsa29yc2hhbmRiYWdzb3V0bGV0d2ViLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> michael kors </a>preoccupation of this king and his courtiers with astronomical calculation is not an arcane exercise. It has a very practical consequence for the people of the city of Xultún, which is, What the hell is going on with the economy?&quot;
<br />Xultún Discovery &quot;Pretty Wild&quot;
<br />During tough times, the Maya looked to their leaders to divine the intents of the gods and appease them.
<br />In turn, those rulers may have looked to the scribes, who many archaeologists believe used past events—in combination with mysterious, complex arithmetic—to predict the future.
<br />As such, the newfound workroom could hold secrets into how the long-forgotten political system operated.
<br />But for the scientists, the mural is also about the joy of discovery.
<br />&quot;To be uncovering glyphs and reading them right off the wall—to be the first one in 1,200 years to read something? I mean, it's pretty wild,&quot; Rossi said.
<br />Sadly, we may never understand the full context of the workroom. Many of the glyphs are badly faded. Worse, the entire city of Xultún was looted clean during the 70s, leaving very little other writing or antiquities.
<br />Because of this, and despite Xultún's obvious prominence in the Maya world, many archaeologists had written off the site.
<br />&quot;And yet we've still found things here that we've never seen anyplace else,&quot; excavation leader <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNoYWVsa29yc2hhbmRiYWdzb3V0bGV0d2ViLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.michaelkorshandbagsoutletweb.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.michaelkorshandbagsoutletweb.com</a> </a> Saturno said. &quot;And we only started looking three years ago.&quot;

The other 26 attempts blocked in front by his teammates were every bit as important in the New York Rangers' Eastern Conference finals opening win.
<br />&quot;We know that's happening,&quot; Devils captain Zach Parise said after the Rangers' 3-0 win on Monday night. &quot;We know that's coming. That's the way they play. They block a lot of shots, and we expect that for the rest of the series.&quot;
<br />So did the Ottawa Senators and the Washington Capitals, the Rangers' first two postseason opponents, who pushed the East's top-seeded team to seven games, but couldn't knock them out.
<br />Lundqvist earned his fifth career playoff shutout across the ice from New Jersey's Martin Brodeur, who owns the NHL postseason record with 24.
<br />The <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jYXJyZXJhLWdsYXNzZXMuY29t" target="_blank"> carrera sunglasses</a> game was in a scoreless deadlock until the third period when the Rangers broke it open.
<br />&quot;It felt like it was important for me to get a good start,&quot; Lundqvist said. &quot;It's always tough to come from a Game 7. So emotional, and everything around it, and then start over. (Sunday) was all about regrouping, and move your focus to a new team and just a different type of game. I didn't really know what to expect from this game, honestly.
<br />&quot;It <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNoYWVsa29yc2hhbmRiYWdzb3V0bGV0d2ViLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> michael kors handbags </a> pretty much turned out the way I hoped.&quot;
<br />Rookie Chris Kreider, defenseman Dan Girardi, and Artem Anisimov all had a goal and an assist for New York, which rebounded well two days after outlasting the pesky Capitals.
<br />Just as they did in the first two rounds, the Rangers jumped out to a 1-0 series lead. They hope to avoid losing Game 2 at home for the third straight series.
<br />&quot;We want for the first time to get a 2-0 lead,&quot; forward Brad Richards said.
<br />After 14 games and two nail-biting playoff series wins, the Rangers insisted they have plenty left to make a run at the Stanley Cup.
<br />If <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNoYWVsa29yc2hhbmRiYWdzb3V0bGV0d2ViLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> michael kors outlet </a> any proof was needed, Lundqvist provided it.
<br />&quot;I don't know where you guys get all this stuff about being tired,&quot; Rangers coach John Tortorella said. &quot;If we're tired this time of the year, there's something the matter. We still have a month to play. You might as well not even ask me questions about being tired.&quot;
<br />The Rangers said during their one day off before facing the Devils that they liked the rhythm of playing every other day, and didn't think the quick turnaround would affect them. The Devils, however, had been off for five days since they knocked out the Philadelphia Flyers in five games.
<br />No team forced to play seven-game series in each of the first two rounds has gone on to win the Stanley Cup. The Rangers are determined to be the first. They slogged through two scoreless periods before dominating the third.
<br />The Rangers are in the conference finals for the first time since 1997, and they haven't reached the Stanley Cup finals since 1994, when they beat a then 22-year-old Brodeur and the Devils in a classic seven-game series that backed up captain Mark Messier's guarantee.
<br />Brodeur and the Devils are making their first conference finals appearance since 2003, the year they won the Cup for the third time.
<br />Game 2 is Wednesday night in New York.
<br />Girardi, who struggled at times with his defensive duties, got a perfect setup from Kreider and scored 53 seconds into the third. Playing in just his 13th NHL game, all in these playoffs, Kreider sent a pass back from the right circle in the Devils' zone to the point. Girardi took long strides as he charged up ice and stepped into a shot that ripped through a screen in front by teammate Derek Stepan.
<br />&quot;I saw (Kreider) coming up the wall, and I was delaying to see what he was going to do,&quot; Girardi said. &quot;I saw no one go to the point, and I kind of stepped into it and got it through.&quot;
<br />The shot beat Brodeur for Girardi's second playoff goal this season and second in 47 career postseason games. It was a drive Brodeur said he never saw.
<br />&quot;We didn't finish Kreider down the board,&quot; Brodeur said. &quot;We didn't close him out and get him off of the puck. Nobody went to him, probably a miscommunication, and he was able to lay a puck to Girardi and for a bomb.&quot;
<br />The other assist went to 21-year-old defenseman Michael Del Zotto, who along with Kreider was only 3 when these teams last met in the conference finals in `94.
<br />Girardi also earned a secondary assist on Kreider's power-play goal with 8 minutes remaining that made it 2-0. New York's slumping power play connected after Girardi was drilled hard from behind into the boards by Devils forward Steve Bernier.
<br />Anisimov, who also assisted on Kreider's goal, scored into an empty net to make it 3-0 with 1:27 left.
<br />Brodeur heard sing-song chants of &quot;Mar-ty, Mar-ty&quot; before the game started. Those got much louder after Girardi's goal, and even more taunting after Kreider scored as the blue-shirt wearing, towel-waving fans' excitement grew. Brodeur finished with 25 saves.
<br />Lundqvist was solid throughout in posting his second shutout of these playoffs.
<br />&quot;Hank is huge for us back there,&quot; Girardi said. &quot;We were struggling a little bit in our defensive zone and he was there to bail us out. That's what happened. He made some big saves, and in the third period we came out hard and got a couple of goals for him.&quot;
<br />To no one's surprise, the teams were still tied heading into the final frame, but not because of a lack of chances.
<br />Lundqvist was sharp in turning aside pucks that sneaked through the wall of teammates. He was at his best while the Rangers were on a power play late in the second period.
<br />Parise had the puck to the left of the net and snapped off a forehand that Lundqvist blocked. Parise got another whack at the rebound, and was again denied. Given one more chance with a backhander, Parise failed to break the deadlock with a short-handed goal.
<br />&quot;I tried to go 5-hole on the first one and it just kept popping back to me,&quot; Parise said. &quot;I tried to go up, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNoYWVsa29yc2hhbmRiYWdzb3V0bGV0d2ViLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> michael kors </a> and he made the save. It came back, and I tried to go high, and he made another save. It was unfortunate. It was a few of those opportunities we had. We just didn't capitalize.&quot;
<br />It wasn't the first bit of frustration in the series opener for Parise. He was caught from behind by hard-charging defenseman Ryan McDonagh to thwart a first-period breakaway before Parise could get a shot on Lundqvist.
<br />McDonagh made the most of his 22-year-old legs, and showed no signs of fatigue from 14 previous playoff games this season, when he also chased down Ilya Kovalchuk in the first period. Lundqvist made a stop at the end of the charge.
<br />The Devils also peppered Lundqvist in the opening minutes of the second period. Lundqvist fought to see between a maze of players and even gave a shove to the back of teammate Anton Stralman, trying to move the defenseman out of his line of sight.
<br />Notes: Brodeur made his 183rd consecutive playoff start for the Devils. He is the only player from <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNoYWVsa29yc2hhbmRiYWdzb3V0bGV0d2ViLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.michaelkorshandbagsoutletweb.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.michaelkorshandbagsoutletweb.com</a> </a> the 1994 series still in the NHL. ... Kreider, who made his debut on April 16 at Ottawa after winning the NCAA championship with Boston College, has three goals in the playoffs.

		<document id="a41faedb8ba389b3d13d3f74b77b8270" url=""><![CDATA[Ratko Mladic's Genocide Trial Under Way<br/><br/>Twenty years after his troops began brutally ethnically cleansing Bosnian towns and villages of non-Serbs, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jYXJyZXJhLWdsYXNzZXMuY29t" target="_blank"> carrera sunglasses</a> Gen. Ratko Mladic went on trial Wednesday at the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal accused of 11 counts of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes.  
<br />The ailing 70-year-old Mladic's appearance at the U.N. court war crimes tribunal marked the end of a long wait for justice to survivors of the 1992-95 war that left some 100,000 people dead. The trial is also a landmark for the U.N. court and international justice — Mladic is the last suspect from the Bosnian war to go on trial here. 
<br />(MORE: Warlord Convicted: Liberia's Charles Taylor Found Guilty of War Crimes)
<br />Mladic, in a suit and tie and looking healthier than at previous pretrial hearings, gave a thumbs-up and clapped to supporters in the court's public gallery as the trial got under way Wednesday. He occasionally wrote notes and showed no emotion as prosecutors began outlining his alleged crimes. 
<br />Munira Subasic, who lost 22 family members in the 1995 Srebrenica massacre, was among a group of relatives of war dead in the courtroom's public gallery to face Mladic. 
<br />The 65-year-old said she wanted to look him in the eye &quot;and ask him if he will repent for what he did.&quot; 
<br />One &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.michaelkorshandbagsoutletweb.com%26quot%3B%26gt%3B%26lt%3Bb%26gt"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.michaelkorshandbagsoutletweb.com&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt</a>; michael kors handbags&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; woman in the public gallery called him a &quot;vulture&quot; as prosecutors began two days of laying out their case for judges. 
<br />Presiding Judge Alphons Orie of the Netherlands said at the outset that the court was considering postponing the presentation of evidence, due to start May 29, due to &quot;errors&quot; by prosecutors in disclosing evidence to the defense. Prosecutor Dermot Groome said he would not oppose a &quot;reasonable adjournment.&quot; 
<br />Groome began his opening statement by focusing on the plight of a 14-year-old boy whose father and uncle were among 150 men murdered by Bosnian Serb forces in November 1992, part of a pattern of atrocities that characterized the start of the war. 
<br />&quot;The &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.michaelkorshandbagsoutletweb.com%26quot%3B%26gt%3B%26lt%3Bb%26gt"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.michaelkorshandbagsoutletweb.com&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt</a>; michael kors outlet&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; world watched in disbelief that in neighborhoods and villages within Europe a genocide appeared to be in progress,&quot; he said. 
<br />Groome said Mladic's forces continued such killings through to 1995, when they massacred some 8,000 Muslim men in the Srebrenica enclave, the worst mass murder in Europe since World War II. 
<br />&quot;By &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.michaelkorshandbagsoutletweb.com%26quot%3B%26gt%3B%26lt%3Bb%26gt"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.michaelkorshandbagsoutletweb.com&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt</a>; michael kors&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the time Mladic and his troops murdered thousands in Srebrenica ... they were well-rehearsed in the craft of murder,&quot; Groome told the court. 
<br />He then showed judges video of the aftermath of a notorious shelling of a market in Markale, in the Bosnian capital Sarajevo, that killed dozens of people. 
<br />He said all the attacks were part of an &quot;overarching&quot; plan to ethnically cleanse parts of Bosnia of non-Serbs. 
<br />Prosecutors will present evidence, including Mladic's own wartime diaries, that demonstrate, &quot;beyond reasonable doubt the hand of Mr. Mladic in each of these crimes,&quot; Groome said. 
<br />Mladic has refused to enter pleas, but he denies wrongdoing, saying he acted to defend Serbs in Bosnia. If he is convicted, he faces a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. 
<br />He suffered a stroke while in hiding and has had other health problems since arriving in The Hague. He now looks little like the burly, swaggering general who marshaled his troops as the world watched during the Bosnian war. 
<br />His lawyer, Branko Lukic, said Mladic's spirits were up ahead of the trial. 
<br />&quot;He's feeling better,&quot; he said. &quot;But for a man in the state he is — he's a man in generally bad shape — he's feeling pretty good,&quot; Lukic said. 
<br />Mladic's trial opened as the case against his former political master, Radovan Karadzic, has reached its halfway stage at the same court. Both men face virtually identical 11-count indictments alleging they masterminded the ethnic cleansing of Bosnia. The man accused of fomenting conflicts throughout the Balkans in the 1990s, former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, died in his cell here in The Hague in 2006 before judges could deliver verdicts in his trial. 
<br />Karadzic and Mladic were indicted together 17 years ago, but their cases were split when Karadzic was captured in Serbia in 2008 and transferred to The Hague. It was another three years before Mladic was finally arrested in a village near Belgrade, ending 15 years as one of the world's most-wanted fugitives. 
<br />Izudin Alic, a Muslim boy made famous in 1995 by images of Mladic patting his face and handing him &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.michaelkorshandbagsoutletweb.com%26quot%3B%26gt%3B%26lt%3Bb%26gt"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.michaelkorshandbagsoutletweb.com&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt</a>; <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.michaelkorshandbagsoutletweb.com%26lt%3B%2Fb%26gt%3B%26lt%3B%2Fa%26gt"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.michaelkorshandbagsoutletweb.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt</a>; chocolate, said he wants swift justice after waiting for so long. He planned to watch the opening of the trial on television. 
<br />&quot;Just like everyone else, I want him to be tried and sentenced as fast as possible. I hope that the trial will not drag on,&quot; he said as he visited his father's grave in Potocari, near Srebrenica. &quot;I want him to be sentenced as soon as possible.&quot;

<br />The  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jYXJyZXJhLWdsYXNzZXMuY29t" target="_blank"> carrera sunglasses</a> euro dipped below $1.27 to a four-month low, the main index of top European shares, the FTSE Eurofirst 300 &amp;lt;.FTEU3&amp;gt;, touched its lowest level for 2012, while U.S. stock futures pointed to a weak day on Wall Street.
<br />The probability that Greece will leave the single currency rose markedly after political leaders in Athens failed on Tuesday to form a government, forcing another round of elections. Opinion polls show this is likely to be won by leftist parties opposed to the country's bailout deal.
<br />In response, markets have moved to price in a Greek exit from the 17-member bloc, but are uncertain about the impact this will have on the rest of the region, while big investors have largely retreated to the sidelines, adding to the volatility.
<br />&amp;quot;The <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNoYWVsa29yc2hhbmRiYWdzb3V0bGV0d2ViLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> michael kors handbags </a> idea that you can contain the spillover, the contagion, into the likes of Portugal, the likes of Spain, I just don't see that as being feasible,&amp;quot; said James Ashley, senior European economist at RBC Capital Markets.
<br />Peripheral euro zone sovereign bonds have taken the brunt of the selling pressure as some investors withdraw to safe havens like German government debt. Price moves were most pronounced in the market for insuring bonds against a potential default.
<br />The <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNoYWVsa29yc2hhbmRiYWdzb3V0bGV0d2ViLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> michael kors outlet </a> Italian five-year Credit Default Swap (CDS) was 16 basis point (bpts) higher at 510 bpts in European morning trade, while the Spanish 5-year CDS widened 4.5 bpts to hit an all time peak of 546 bpts.
<br />In the cash market moves were less dramatic, with 10-year Spanish bond yields easing to 6.35 percent after making big gains on Tuesday. The Italian equivalent debt was little changed at 6.01 percent.
<br />The yield spread of all major emerging sovereign bonds over safer U.S. Treasuries however widened to be near 3-1/2-month highs of 386 basis points.
<br />&amp;quot;The re-weighted probability of Greece leaving EMU has led to a sharp widening of government bond spreads, suggesting that long-term capital is leaving the periphery of Europe,&amp;quot; Morgan Stanley said in a note to clients.
<br />There were also signs in Athens that the prospect of a rapid devaluation of any new currency if the country leaves the euro was concerning ordinary Greeks.
<br />Central bank head George Provopoulos told political leaders savers had withdrawn at least 700 million euros ($894 million) from the nation's banks on Monday.
<br />The euro dropped to $1.2681 against the dollar putting it on track to test the January low of $1.2624, below which would mark the euro's lowest level since August 2010.
<br />&amp;quot;The bias is still for a lower euro and a $1.26 target for mid-year looks pretty appropriate&amp;quot; said Jeremy Stretch, head of currency strategy at CIBC.
<br />The dollar rose to its highest in four months against a basket of currencies &amp;lt;.DXY&amp;gt;, while the euro also hit a three-month low versus the yen.

<br />GROWTH IMPACT
<br />The <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNoYWVsa29yc2hhbmRiYWdzb3V0bGV0d2ViLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> michael kors </a> potential for a &amp;quot;disorderly&amp;quot; outcome, either directly from Greece leaving the euro or as related contagion worsens the already stagnant euro zone economy, has sent tremors through world equity and commodity markets.
<br />Emerging market stocks as measured by the MSCIEF index &amp;lt;.MSCIEF&amp;gt; plunged 2.58 percent, with the index close to erasing all its year-to-date gains on its way to posting its biggest one-day loss in six months.
<br />Weakness in Asian share markets sparked by the Greek crisis have already pushed MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan &amp;lt;.MIAPJ0000PUS&amp;gt; down 3.3 percent to a four-month low.
<br />MSCI's global equity index &amp;lt;.MIWD00000PUS&amp;gt; was down 0.9 percent to 304.95 and is now up less than 2 percent for the year to date.
<br />European shares were hit by a broad-based sell-off, with the FTSEurofirst 300 index &amp;lt;.FTEU3&amp;gt; down 0.7 percent to 990.54 points, having also dropped 0.7 percent on Tuesday.
<br />Spain's IBEX 35 &amp;lt;.IBEX&amp;gt; fell 0.5 percent while Italy's FTSE MIB &amp;lt;.FTMIB&amp;gt; weakened by 1.7 percent.
<br />Oil prices slid along with world shares and industrial commodities like copper in the general move away from riskier assets, but its fall was accentuated by a surprise build in U.S. crude inventories.
<br />Brent crude was down $1.21 at $111.03 a barrel and U.S. oil was down $1.52 to $92.46 a barrel.
<br />Brent crude oil fell to $110.82 cents a barrel and gold extended its losses to be down $13.34 at $1,530.76 an ounce, its weakest level since late December.
<br />Gold gained nothing from flows into safe havens and fell for a fourth straight day to its lowest since <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNoYWVsa29yc2hhbmRiYWdzb3V0bGV0d2ViLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.michaelkorshandbagsoutletweb.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.michaelkorshandbagsoutletweb.com</a> </a> late December as investors sold the precious metal to profit from the strength in the U.S. dollar.
<br />Spot gold was down 0.6 percent at $1,534.54 an ounce, having dropped by nearly 3.8 percent in the last four days - its longest stretch of consecutive losses in nearly five months.
