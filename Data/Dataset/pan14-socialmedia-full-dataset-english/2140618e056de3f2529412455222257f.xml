<br /><br />No matter who you are, you need one
<br />no matter what you do, you want one
<br />No matter if you are uptight or smug
<br />everybody needs a hug
<br /><br />Even if you are up or even if you’re down
<br />even if you’re flat on the ground
<br />Even if you feel like you’ve got some kind of bug
<br />everybody needs a hug
<br /><br />Maybe you’re a millionaire
<br />or maybe you have no underwear
<br />Maybe your life sucks and your beer is full of suds
<br />maybe you just need some hugs
<br /><br />When you can’t seem to get around
<br />when you have to look up to see down
<br />When all you have to eat is one small spud
<br />sounds like it’s time for a hug
<br /><br />If you’ve been dragged over the coals
<br />if life is taking it’s toll
<br />If you’re being chased by a thug
<br />just open your arms and give him a hug
<br /><br />Sometimes people are very rude
<br />just because they’re in a bad mood
<br />You should get up close and snug
<br />Then reach out and give their ass a hug
<br /><br />When everyday all you see is bad omens
<br />when life keeps feeding you lemons
<br />When for the things you are owed, you never get paid
<br />Just give a hug and say it's all paid........ <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/kiss.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/kiss.gif" alt=":)" />

<br />That always warms the heart;
<br />It welcomes us back home
<br />And makes it easier to part.
<br />A hug is a way to share the joy
<br />And sad times we go through,
<br />Or just a way for friends to say
<br />They like you 'cause you're you.
<br />Hugs are meant for anyone
<br />For whom we really care,
<br />From your grandma to your neighbor,
<br />Or a cuddly teddy bear.
<br />A hug is an amazing thing --
<br />It's just the perfect way
<br />To show the love we're feeling
<br />But can't find the words to say.............. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/hug.gif" alt=":)" />

<br />*~*~*~* ~ * ~ * ~ * ~ *
<br />Love is like magic
<br />And it always will be
<br />For love still remains
<br />Life's sweet mystery!
<br /><br />Love works in ways
<br />That are wondrous and strange
<br />And there's nothing in life
<br />that love can not change!
<br /><br />Love can transform
<br />The most common place
<br />Into beauty and splendor
<br />And sweetness and grace.
<br /><br />Love is unselfish,
<br />Understanding and kind
<br />For it sees with its heart
<br />And not with its mind!
<br /><br />Love is the answer
<br />That everyone seeks...
<br />Love is the language,
<br />That every heart speaks.
<br /><br />Love can't be bought,
<br />It is priceless and free,
<br />Love, like pure magic,
<br />Is life's sweet mystery!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!......... <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/tongue.gif" alt=":)" />

Was it because they just enjoy clicking and browsing cute/ beautiful photos, looking/reading profiles or Taglines? Or just because they only want to &quot;increase&quot; their &quot;friends list&quot; on their page? After we accept them, do you also notice some never send us a thank you message, wink, luv, tags, comments or send us even a &quot;Hello&quot; and, what is worse, even after they see you send them winks, luv, tags, or comments, they still never say &quot;Thanks&quot;........... <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/confused2.gif" alt=":)" />
