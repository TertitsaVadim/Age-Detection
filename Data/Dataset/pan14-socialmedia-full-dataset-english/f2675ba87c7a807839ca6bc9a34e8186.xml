The news channels have laboriously created a universe for themselves, and funnily, its drifting further and further from that of the astronomer's. And the use of such terms as &quot;Art Attack&quot; (by the way, thats a really good show on Disney) are quite a poor effort on the part of the researcher/reporter in highlighting the story.
<br /><br />Cutting to the chase, I don't think all of the &quot;vandalism&quot; by the VHP activists should be viewed in the photographer's room. I don't believe that all &quot;expressions&quot; should be left uncensored. I don't think it is right to propagate the view that &quot;The artist should be allowed to open his mind and heart whenever he has a brush/pen in his hand&quot;. After all, would we like a person on the street opening his filthy mouth when it  comes to addressing us or our family members. I am not going into the Constitution here for two reasons. I don't have such a deep insight into the laws in that large fat book. And second, I believe that the Constitution is deeply flawed if it allows for such &quot;expressions&quot;.
<br /><br />Over the past year, it has been made quite clear through various incidents that everthing from a cartoon strip to a movie to a painting can be categorized as offensive. In the countless discussions that have gone on, one thing has emerged. The religious leaders are very liberal when it comes to &quot;offensive&quot; material with respect to another religion, but very strict when it comes to their own. So, basically, the discussion is stuck in a muck, with no outcome whatsoever. I have a very simple solution to these mess. A common sensical one.
<br /><br />Why can't there be a law which states that a finite number of sacred symbols cannot be used in &quot;artistic expressions&quot;? I am sure the artists can work with such a &quot;restriction&quot;. I am critical of the artists because it is becoming more and more obvious that their effort is more to create a media hype, and fetch a higher price for their work. I cannot think of any other reason why the artist in Vadodara would paint such a painting knowing fully well that it was refering to the sacred space of a religion. I only wish he wouldn't have got himself into jail by painting his explosive and deragatory expressions. I wish he would be as relaxed as I am while I am writing this blog. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />If only the artists would go about their business the way the rest of India does, I would have had a better discussion than &quot;Art Attack&quot; to watch while I had my dinner. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" />

You'll find her in my friends, please feel free to let out ur anger at this article... 
<br /><br />Marriages are lovely times, and I mean that. From every perspective possible, they are the best occasions... Lemme explain why... and how... 
<br /><br />They are the best everyone loses something, and gains something... Lets start with the groom shall we... He gets a fully paid publicity event, with lots of money (I would like to be politically incorrect and say &quot;from the guy's point of view, dowry is a positive thing&quot<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/wink.gif" alt=":)" />, gets to meet lots of friends, gets to see lots of girls, enjoys the great food... and gets (all virgins, say i do) a honeymoon... NOW... what he loses is the freedom for the rest of his life... he is now officially gonna tick the &quot;married&quot; column which probably holds much greater significance than just the ink... He is now a responsible person, and i think the &quot;r&quot; word is the opposite of the &quot;f&quot; word for a guy... or is it?! <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />Next, the bride gets loads of jewelry... which is again, quite good when you love to show off... she gets to live in her own house, have her own family, and live the great Indian dream... and the gifts.. and the honeymoon... what does she lose in all of this? well, she wont be getting a million friend requests a day which actually make her feel so sought after... and of course, her husband is gonna throw everything in wrong&quot;est&quot; place possible... 
<br /><br />The guy's parents lose a pocket-hole digger... they can finally buy the skoda and not the swift... the girl's parents can proudly say that their daughter is married, and they don't' have to worry about &quot;when will we get her married? ... how much will it cost?&quot;... they can buy the flat and get out of rented accommodation... 
<br /><br />The guests are split in half... Half of them love the food, the girls... and the give the gifts as a sign of payment for all the enjoyment they get out of it... 
<br />The other half are the left to fend for themselves... they are the disgruntled ones... who hate wearing jewelry, hate the photos, hate the insatiably hungry &quot;others&quot;, and still sleep off early in the night for the marriage next day... 
<br /><br />Well, as is usual now, I don't think everyone will get everything I have written in the blog... But do feel free to give a 10 rating for the spoof that it was... <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" />

<br /><br />Most of the social networks and related apps allow for an avatar in one way or another. The word avatar was (I am guessing here) used by Yahoo! and subsequently there are many names for the same. For example, the status message in Gtalk, or the Headline in Orkut.. hell, probably even this blog!
<br /><br />These avatars are an expression of what we are... no, sometimes they explore what we want to be. All this sounds well and good. But isn't it all a little wierd? Total introverts writing &quot;Hey gals, wanna chat?&quot;... or an absolute dumbass quoting einstein or the million other quotes on the net. At some level, it is pitiable to see people coming up with some plagiarized lines just to make themselves sound &quot;cool&quot;. And this is the final nail... the avatars keep changing, to keep up with the cool bandwagon...
<br /><br />Frankly, I haven't yet heard of a definition of cool, other than the &quot;highly successful in talking to girls&quot; one. I wonder what kind of people would love to show off something which they aren't. I wonder what kind of people would spend hours browsing and pleading for friendship on every girl's scrapbook. I wonder what kind of people struggle to keep with the handful of courses in their college but keep track of all the possible break ups in the vicinity. (And here I am refering to both guys and girls). I wonder how the country can pride itself of bringing up the biggest, youngest &quot;TALENT&quot; pool in the world...
<br /><br />When I say that, I am sure that there are people who don't fall into such groups, but most of the people do. And the point here is not just of &quot;whether they join an IT co&quot; or not, the point is that of the society that is being built up. Frankly, we may be wearing Levi's, smoking a Marlboro, driving a Ferrari or drinking JW, but when we do all of that, we should have atleast one cent of self-respect and decency!
<br /><br />For once, an avatar of decency and truth will go a long way...

<br />Happenings from the world above and my homely lane,
<br />What is it that brings them so close,
<br />What is it that makes me muse,
<br />Is it the colors, or the lack of it,
<br />Or the silence that comes with it,
<br />Happiness, in seeing the most beautiful,
<br />All the words in this world cannot describe in full,
<br />How I wish we knew how to create such beautiful happenings,
<br />Alas… after all, we are only beings;
<br />Who can see all that nature has to offer,
<br />But nothing comes close, whatever we proffer, 
<br />But again, we are lucky to sight,
<br />What is definitely the most wonderful sight,
<br />Which leaves us in awe, over and over again,
<br />Nature never repeats in vain,
<br />It never cease to amaze,
<br />As we continue to gaze…

But for those who haven't done the right thing and didn't read my blogs... this won't shake you out of your seat. It will make you think (hopefully, I can use the word &quot;again&quot; here). <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />Now that we are through the courteous introduction, let me get on with my work of writing the blog... Thanks for tuning in, hopefully you'll enjoy reading this as much as I did writing it.
<br /><br />How this world is all about people... and how its not
<br />How important it is to mingle with others... and how important it is to realize that its not that important either...
<br />How its wonderful when you get hang out with them... and how its just as wonderful when you realize the same all by yourself...
<br />How you can find yourself so happy when you are with them, and without...
<br /><br />In this world of youtube videos, and orkut scraps, and facebook werewolf attacks, its nice to step back and watch the revolution created by netizens. Responsible or not, they are creating a revolution. But a few points escape the mind in this world. How important it is realize who friends are. I talk about friends because the buzzword among all the communities is &quot;friendship&quot;. I think friendship is something very nice... and its even better in richer quantities. I think its the one place where quality matters more than quantity. Its the one place where the person matters, more than the time.
<br /><br />I have found a very good analogy for almost anything in life. Everything in life is a pill. A pill because everything in moderated quantities is great. It has a fine balance. I call it the finite balance. Zero amount of anything is bad... be it studies, be it relaxation or anything else for that matter. But so is an overdose of the same. There is a fine balance where everything is just perfect. Let me put it this way. Instead of using the pill analogy (inviting bitter sweet comments <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" /> ), let me use the cooking analogy. A fine balance is like the correct amount of ingredient... makes the dish perfect. Especially something like biryani ( I come from Hyderabad... <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" /> ). Every restaurant has a rice dish masquerading as biryani, but only very few chefs know the correct balance. Life's just like that.
<br /><br />Coming back to friends... the recipe is just the same. The quality of friendships is what matters. Not the number. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" /> Just like... it doesn't matter if you own a hundred cars, but just one gallardo. You live in hyderabad, and eat all the udipi biryanis, and haven't tasted the real one. Just like you have a collection of a hundred comics, but only a few asterix or c&amp;h. Just like you have read many blogs, but haven't read mine. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" />

<br /><br />I have heard the term &quot;wonderful nature&quot; so many times that I started investigating why so many people say that, and why so many people second that. During my usual critical (also referred to by many as cynical) view of the surroundings, I have realized that &quot;wonderful nature&quot; is the most politically correct statement ever! It has a little bit of truth, though. What is completely false is the next statement after that... &quot;Whatever man makes, it can never compare to nature&quot;. Now, that looks like a Foreign Affairs statement... rather than a balanced observation.
<br /><br />You could always argue with me that these are &quot;points of view&quot;, but so is mine on them. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" /> It really is a loop!
<br /><br />Getting back to not-so-wonderful nature and amazing humans. Man has accomplished almost everything he needed, whenever he needed it. Without much problem, he has survived and flourished for the past god-knows-how-many years. Among the various &quot;works&quot; of man, are literary (something close to this), architectural (nothing like my house here), and automotive and electronic... besides the &quot;when-u-get-sick&quot; medical stuff. To me, any expression of pride starts with either electronic, automotive or architectural. Among these, the architectural wonders are the biggest, most visible symbols.
<br /><br />There's a bridge called the Milau bridge in France. It is built over a very large valley, and its fantastic! No other word for it... Its Fantastic. It never has and never will get as much attention as the lazy elephants on discovery or animal planet, but the bridge speaks volumes just through pictures (courtesy google images). I dare anyone to look at the Milau bridge and appreciate the nature around and rank it above the bridge. The bridge is just so imposing, so arrogant, so much &quot;in-the-face&quot; that it is pretty much impossible to lie about it.
<br /><br />I could've chosen a gallardo... Already have a blog on that, and I wouldn't want to butcher it to death... There are already a hundred clones of it here in US who are doing that job.
<br /><br />I could've chosen the computer... which is still mind-boggling in its complexity... I say still because I find that it is more and more complicated as I learn about it.. not the other way!!
<br /><br />Coming to the point... I think man has created his own place in earth's history. And I am not referring to global warming or any such &quot;negative impacts&quot;. I am referring to the way he has made a land of jungles and rivers, and deserts and ice-caps, into an extremely fun-place to live in. He has transformed the way earth looks from the sky and the moon. He's like a chef. He was given a world to live in, and has mastered it. What was given to him may have been really good, and it truly is, but what he has made of it, is even more startling.
<br /><br />I love animals and plants and other stuff, but what I love the most is the world that we have created... that world where what we want is done.

I have had a really good time this semester in NCSU, and I am headed home for the winter break. Thats the background, now I start painting...
<br /><br />Friends, gadgets, family, good food, games... is that the perfect recipe for life? Okay, I'll add gf to the list, to widen the consensus. I have every one of these things back home... but I didn't realize that something else lay ahead of me in US. Guess what... YES! there is something in US which I didn't get in India... absolutely, top-notch education system. They make u slog, push u to the limit, but it works! it really works... Without any doubt, I have done a lot more work this sem than multiple sems during the bachelors. And its not butcher's work either, its really really good work. So, in hindsight, do I regret coming here? No ways... Do I have everything I want in life back home? Now... thats a tougher question to answer. I can't find a single institution (besides the IITs) which can guarantee the standards and the curriculum here.
<br /><br />Now thats interesting... its easy to answer the flip question... Should I have come to US? YES!... Did I have everything back home?... ummm... If I were doing a job, I guess yes... I mean, I wouldn't care for the quality of education then. But as a student, I think US presents a wonderful opportunity to study. And for that, and that alone, I think its worth making the journey.
<br /><br />True.. you don't have the neighbourhood theatre playing ur fav movies... you don't have dadu's chat right beside ur house to drop in for a chat every other day... you don't have ur mom to cook food everyday by the time you reach home... you don't have a home with limitless food (believe me, my house is a heaven for food, always). BUT... what you do have... are really good courses... peers who are just as good as u... wonderful facilities... and a way of life... you MAY start to like...
<br /><br />Normally, around this time, I set out explaining the title... so, lets keep up the tradition... when I was in hyd, I was really excited about coming to US... and so were each and every one of my friends... i am guessing pretty much everyone in my age group felt the same way...
<br /><br />A semester later... &quot;u r so lucky to go back home&quot;... &quot;u r going home? awesome man&quot;... &quot;have really good food back home... and bring us back lots&quot;... Now... this isn't a contradiction... but its surprising... but what is... &quot;this life sucks... life back in hyd is really great man&quot;... (btw, i love my life in hyd, and really love the work life here... if u haven't already, read between the lines)...
<br /><br />my point in all this... indians have been coming to US for a few decades.. shouldn't US be a known quantity by now? Shouldn't we know what to expect and what not to... Well, somethings really do stay unknowns although everyone knows about them... <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" /> US is one such place... Its a wonderful place to come to study... and... if u ask me, thats about it...
<br /><br />If any of my potential employers is reading this... pls don't take this to be a testament of my english and/or views... but pls do consider placing me in India... <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" /> cheaper for u... and happier for me...

<br /><br />In the music... when you feel the tune is made for you... when there is a message which put everything else in life, in a different perspective... which makes you wonder... leaving you in heaven...
<br /><br />In the food... which changes your mood... makes you realize how somethings heavenly are right here on earth... and they are most unlikely pathways to happiness...
<br /><br />In the pleasure of a car... which drives you to drive it... more and more and more... where you forget that the world is round, and chase the setting sun... a car which never makes you feel alone... even though you are happy that you are happy being alone... and you leave your world behind and head off into distant lands... just you and your car...
<br /><br />In the passion... for games... which transform you into another actor in the game... and you have a country to conquer... another race to win... another role to play... another challenge for you to take up... another adrenaline pumping experience... another opponent who wants to test his skills against yours... with all the artificial intelligence that the computer has garnered... and you will have to come up with new tricks... to outsmart it... to win the game... the ultimate proving ground...
<br /><br />In the breathtaking speed of the computers... of their brains... the processors... the gadget which is leading the world... the most abused, the most loved, the most understood, the most misunderstood... the gateway to the whole world... at the &quot;tap of a key&quot;... the &quot;click of the mouse&quot;... with its own english... where faces are pasted on books... where you can have all the space you want... and still feel crammed...
<br /><br />In the eyes of the one person who makes you feel happy about the world... every single second... who lets you free when you want to venture out... and shield you whenever you don't want to... shares the perfect moments in life... a million memories every second you spend... a million more when you recollect the good times... and every fight looks like a expression of thoughts, with no evil intent... and all this happens, without even noticing that the two personalities are disparate... two living beings, who were brought by people based on either the &quot;hypothesis of love&quot; or the &quot;stars&quot; and grandparents... and there started the journey... another of the many stairways to heaven that life gives you...
<br /><br />heaven is right here... gotta grab one of the many stairways to it... all the stairways have one common tag on them... they are all in a perfect harmony...

So, I didn’t know how to take it and went on a mission to find out what it is. At the end of the mission, I didn’t find an answer, so I killed everyone else on the planet who wasn’t bored and felt happy that the rest of humanity was also bored along with me. Right.
<br />Lets start over… with the real story this time. After a long semester, I was a little scared of the winter break. I was scared because I had nothing to do during that period. No plans to go out. No trips to any place. Three weeks of absolutely nothing awaited me. When I say nothing, I don’t mean a life of loneliness in the middle of a forest. It just means I didn’t have any concrete plans to go visit any friends or relatives (or a trip back home like last year). The inevitable three weeks began with an upside down routine, also called the jet-lagged routine, or the IST routine. Sleep in the morning and wake up at night. Counter Strike was the biggest draw to begin with and a couple of other games joined the line-up as the vacation continued. But these games would take up about 6 hours a day (yup, we did play that long). What about the other parts? Food took up a few hours. We had really good food this time round. Well, those were the oceans of boredom which were so empty, you could almost lose yourself in completely useless things and not feel guilty after you get back to reality.
<br />It was one of those trains of thought which actually led to coin the term “virtues of boredom”(if no one else has trademarked it, I wish to) (and even if you did, I will buy it from you). I realized that boredom is that time in life which makes you realize that your life isn’t overflowing with stuff to do. You have enough time to schedule any number of stuff that you want. You are like an under-utilized engine which has enough free time to refit itself with a turbocharger and see how it sounds (I am a car freak, if you didn’t know).
<br />I think life comes with a project specification. That specification tells you what to expect and what you are expected to do. Once you understand that specification, you have figured out what life is all about and you won’t be really scared out of your wits about anything. You will understand everything around you properly once you have completely absorbed the specification. It is a pretty big one, and I don’t think mastering it is achievable, at least not when you are loaded with work for 9 plus months of a year. But you can get a rough idea of what it is. And that’s all that really matters. I can proudly say that I have understood some of it, and what it tells me is that being bored is a good thing. You have fulfilled all the things you wanted to do in the other parts of your life, and you still have time left to do something else. Something new for which you don’t have to sacrifice other things. And when you are bored, you find a lot more things to do. Personally, I wish there is always some amount of boredom in my life (not the sort of boredom while sitting in an office with loads of work on your head). And that boredom allows me to come up with new things I want to explore. This time round, I realized that there is such a thing called useless thinking, but that’s the topic for another blog.
<br />My first ever suggestion to readers… always leave enough time to be bored in your life. It really does feel so good to be bored. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />P.S. I was a teaching assistant last semester and have been studying for quite a few years. So the word “specification” is something I hear and use a lot. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" />

<br /><br />I have loved gadgets since I have known them. It is a fascination which I cherish, and the resulting purchases are manageable, at least till now. So, it must came as little surprise to you when I say that the day I got my iPod Touch (a birthday gift), I was ecstatic. I was totally taken in by the ease of operation. I was consumed with the way it felt in my hands. It was the best thing I have ever owned. It is the most reliable gadget I have used in a long time. When the jail break came along, well before the App Store, I jumped on the bandwagon and have been hooked onto it even more. I made the shift to the App Store somewhere down the line. So, that is the status quo. I love the Touch, and I am thankful to my uncle and Apple.
<br /><br />There is one thing which makes the iPod Touch and not the iPhone, the best gadget ever. You don’t have to pay any fees every month in order to hold onto it. The downside of this is that I need another phone. My current phone is a very reliable Nokia which I have turned into an rock with all the glue I put on it. The phone was with me through many tough times, not tough as in mentally, but phone-wise. It finally needed the bandages after it met with a concrete pavement. The phone, therefore, is ready to take the VRS I am offering, but I need to replace it with young blood. 
<br /><br />Being in the most advanced country in the world has its share of disadvantages. Apparently, it is more capitalistic and free-market-ish to lock the consumer in to a two-year contract and not allow him to change his phone until the contract nearly expires. And if he does buy the phone on his own terms, even then he is bound to the two year contract if he wants to use it. 
<br /><br />Why did I spend three paragraphs trying to explain three different things, besides the fact that this is free so I shouldn’t ask that question anyways? All of them make up the Tangible Conundrum. You see, I need to find a new phone, but whatever phone I buy, I will compare it with the iPod Touch. And let’s face it; there isn’t anything in the market out there now which can eclipse the Touch in terms of overall satisfaction. Till now, there is pretty much no competition between the Touch and the Nokia. The Nokia can call and message. The Touch can do the rest. However, a new phone which does both will be quite a problem. Any phone with the same features will cost a pretty penny, but in the end, it may not be worth it because the iPod will come out the better one. The question of the two-year contract comes in when I have finally decided to replace the Nokia with another phone in the same family. I would make money out of the phone if I were to take it along with a contract from the company. Therefore, no incentive to buy now, and I have to wait until May to replace it. And in the meanwhile, I keep searching for a phone which can at least prove to be a worthy competitor to the Touch. 
<br /><br />If you have any suggestions (non-abusive), let me know. And last, a wacky pearl of wisdom… If you are in a dilemma when it comes to buying the next fully featured phone, just buy the iPod Touch. You will end up with the above conundrum, but at least, you will have the Touch which will keep you entertained all the way.

There are also a shit load of personality tests out there to make you feel better about yourself. The tests are more like drugs, for the faint hearted. All of the results suggest that you are really God's gift to humanity, and that you are one in a million. The point is, the quiz says the same thing to the other 999 thousand also! And we imagine all those good things actually exist within us, for a moment atleast, and feel happy about it. Wonder why we just don't like being called a human... a selfish, materialistic, greedy, ambitious, faulty, sadistic, hypocritical human. Probably its that one thing in us which is only happy when it is told that we are good. When someone tells us that we are good, it feels happy. When we are accepted into the society, we feel happy. A currency to measure this acceptance is friends. This is just one measure, not the only one. But, it is an (if not the most) important one. 
<br /><br />We pretty much can't do anything about our IQ. Maybe we can but its rare that you fail tenth because you can't add numbers, and end up discovering something great in science later. Self-help books can make you believe, and in some corner cases, rightly so, that you can change your EQ. But how about your social quotient. How about that? Can you change that? Can you read a book, or take a course, and increase your social score? My view is that you can't do anything about it. Its one of those things that quintessentially you. 
<br /><br />For a while, I believed that it was possible to change a person's social score. I thought there were a certain set of things that you need to do, and you can change it. It is probably true with girls, because... lets face it.. there are enough desperate guys around to keep them company at any point of time. So, if a girl really want to hang out, not too much of a problem to find &quot;a&quot; guy. Rerouting... but I realized quite fast that basically there isn't anything you can do about it. Its what you are. There are many things we love about ourselves, and many things we don't. And this is just one of those many things. Its a part and parcel of what we are. I thought this was worth a blog because of two reasons (i) blogs are free (ii) i think there are lot of people who agree and disagree with me on this. Something contentious makes a good blog. 
<br /><br />This is how I view things. Everybody is pretty much the same. They possess all the wonderful (please get the sarcasm) qualities (and more of what) I described above. And I am pretty happy being a human in that sense. My Friday and Saturday nights are just like any other night... watching a movie, sitting in the lab and debugging code written by someone from Mars, cooking food, sitting in a coffee shop or sleeping. No clubs, no discos, no parties every other night for me. To a sub-20, or just 20-plus year old, that may sound lame. And for a while I thought it was. But then I realized that we all live in different worlds. We are a product of our childhood, our environment, and our decisions. So, when I see people who want to change what they are, I feel quite bad about it. I think they are just perfect being themselves. We may be from the same planet, but Eve isn't our mother. And I guess the faster you accept you, the easier everything is. I think its great to party, but its equally good or even better to be excited when you fix code written by another underpaid grad student on a Friday night at 12. I think the same applies to relationships. Relationships don't define people. Its the other way round. You can love life, irrespective of whether you are in one, or out of one. And I am out of words.
<br /><br />Just to keep track... this blog is around 3am. Thanks for reading it. Hope you liked it. See ya.

<br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/rajeshwar_vanka/photo/photoid=28570401" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/14692984_10649092_28570401.jpg" /></a>
<br />I am starting this blog at 3 in the morning. It has been snowing for a while today. Went out for a walk in the snow. It was a very very nice experience. A hot coffee sent me to heaven. And here, I am back at home. 
<br />I have a few topics in my mind which I wanted to talk about. And today, I got the proper introduction I was looking for, on my way back home. This place is pretty much covered in snow. Some people are excited to see snow, others aren’t. That’s because it snows here once a year, if you are lucky. It is cold, but it doesn’t snow often. So, most people who drive here are not used to driving in snow. So you see people driving cars without having removed the snow from the top, which is quite dangerous. That was a surprising thing I noticed, however today night was a little more serious. A guy driving an SUV, talking on his cell phone, skids while trying to stop for a red signal, and stops in the middle of the intersection. He knew the red signal was coming on. Nope, this guy wouldn’t just care. If he tried to stop sincerely and missed, I wouldn’t have a problem with it. Even then, he is stopping an SUV which is bigger than everything here, and frankly, has nothing sporty about it. And this great soul doesn’t think it is necessary for him to actually stop talking on the phone even then. Nope. And why am I concerned? Because I was trying to cross the road and luckily didn’t assume that he had brains. Talking about brainy people…
<br /><br />There’s been a nice little drama going on here regarding NBC, a television channel. I won’t go into the details of the whole drama, but this is basically what happened. The network had two people who wanted to host the same legendary comedy show, The Tonight Show. One of them, Jay Leno, was hosting it for the last two decades, and has been hugely successful. The other is a younger upstart, Conan O’Brien who might be the future. So the channel decided to go with the younger one, and pushed the older one elsewhere. Now both the shows were doing badly, so they decided to bring the old one back. The younger one didn’t like it, and he got 40 million dollars (i.e. the rest of his contract) and he is going to leave the channel, for another one which will give him the same time slot there. The older one is getting back his show. The way it has been portrayed here is that the younger one is being kicked out. And people stood in rain outside the channel’s headquarters to protest his expulsion. And he thinks he is a victim, and is milking it to the max. I mean, come on!!!!! How dumb can people be ... This is a country with an un-employment rate of 15%. Walmart, the cheapest store in town, is shedding jobs by the thousands because people don’t have the money to buy stuff even at their bargain basement prices! And of all the things to worry about, the biggest thing to do apparently is to show sympathy to a comedian who has made 32.5 million dollars, for the rest of his contract! Pardon me if I am wrong, but how dumb can people get. I mean, he didn’t like the spot he was given by the channel, so he quit. Isn’t this like any other job? And for god sakes, he is making more money than 99% of the American population will ever make. Leno on the other hand is being blamed for “kicking out” Conan. I am sorry. How is that wrong? Leno wanted his show back. NBC wanted Leno more than Conan. Simple. Why can’t people accept that? 
<br />The next topic I want to talk about is something which has even more people hooked on. Telangana. One fine day, one guy goes on a fast-unto-death, and students are “agitated”, and start burning down buses they haven’t paid for? They start damaging property they don’t own? I have a question here. If you are upset about anything in your house, do you go and torch your neighbour’s house? No. Because then you would be jailed. However, in this case, the students were apparently “emotionally upset”. Frankly, I don’t know how they can get emotionally upset about someone who hid from public view after elections because he couldn’t face his own party men, but then, even if they did get emotionally upset, why should they be allowed to torch the buses? Is this straight out vandalism? These are students who are studying to get a Bachelors or a Masters degree. Granted, it is in arts, and not a technical field. But still, if this is the emotional state of these people, that they would erupt so violently when something “aggravates” their minds, then shouldn’t they be in rehab? I keep “quoting” the words because I don’t believe in any of these explanations. I agree that there may have been some discrimination in the way the funds were allocated. But I guess the more important question here why this is happening now. If this was close to an election, it would be legitimate but it is not. At the end of the day, all these students who are actually damaging public property end up being corrupt politicians, or corrupt government workers.  I don’t think Microsoft would like to hire a student who has “I torched Bus No 3K during Telangana agitations in 2010” as one of his extra-curricular achievements. I am so grouchy about this whole thing is because it’s basically a set of people with money funding others, for their own benefit. And the rest 99% of the population pays a price for it. The more I see democracies in action, I realize that it is not the perfect solution. It needs to be tweaked so that when combined with capitalism, it doesn’t end up servicing the top-end of the population. Talking about Telangana, and Hyderabad…
<br />There is company called Notion Ink, which released a tablet called Adam. It is based in Hyderabad, started by a handful of IITians and MBA grads. They trained students from a local engineering college, BVRIT, to write the software for the applications running on the tablet. In a matter of a few months, they learnt themselves and educated the students how to write applications on Google’s Android. They did this because, as a startup, they couldn’t afford to pay the going price for professionals in the area (1 lakh a month for an Android developer).  The tablet is priced lower than Apple’s tablet, the iPad and has more features. Granted that it may not “look” as polished, or have a picture of half-eaten fruit on the back, I think this is a bigger achievement than the rave here about the iPad. This might look very Hyderabadi of me to bring up this tablet, but I am taking this as an example to prove a point. Even in this era of online news, there is still a hierarchy in terms of which news gets covered. I admire the iPad for what it is. A bigger iPhone , without the phone functionality. Its running a basic operating system for its size, in a strictly environment, by a company which thinks apps with explicit content are not in the “right taste”.  I know how the system works, with the advertising money and market muscle, but I just wish that there was a way in which companies like Notion Ink are given the publicity they desperately need to come up. I don’t believe that the products from a big brand company should be called awesome even before people have seen it. Did I tell you that Notion Ink was showed to the world well before the iPad? I believe that the best products will only come out when you have a lot of companies in the same field, fighting for market share. Not when you declare the verdict and bombard people with marketing 24 hours a day regarding one arguably sub-standard product, from first look. I am sure most people would agree that, for all the hype and speculation, the iPad was a dud of epic proportions.
<br /><br />To round up, I prefer Leno to Conan… I would like to see Andhra Pradesh as a unified state for purely sentimental reasons, or in the worst case, Hyderabad should become a UT by itself, with Naidu as its CEO. And I am hoping that the Paradise restaurant is not damaged in all this agitation stuff. Hyderabad wouldn’t be the same without its biryani. I have an iPod Touch and I love it. I am not likely to buy an iPad, because I am not impressed by it.
<br /><br />This is my longest blog so far. If you read it till here, thanks for your patience. Hope you liked it. Before I finish, a disclaimer. I have nothing against Conan’s supporters who were standing in the rain (as long as I don’t have to do anything like that), the Telangana agitators (but please don’t destroy the buses that we pay taxes for, and frankly, you don’t) and Apple fans (I know quite a few of you, and Apple did a great job with the iPhone and the iPods).

<br />Before I start the blog, a very strict warning… If you are lactose intolerant, skip this blog. It is… how do I say it… say… cheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeesey!
<br /><br />Okay. So let’s start. RkS (Rahul ka Swayamwar), if you didn’t know was the reality aired on NDTV Imagine this past month. It was about five weeks of fun-packed show, which I truly adored. I spent more than 16 hours of my life watching it. Granted that, I was multi-tasking for a while, but still. I did keep my ears firmly glued to the best show on earth. Since it is the best show in the universe, I assumed that the whole universe was watching it. So, I picked a couple of unfortunate souls at my workplace and home, and starting discussing the show with them. To my horror, I realized that they weren’t watching the show. I could not tolerate that. Being their well-wisher, I could not see them miss out on this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. I convinced a few of them to watch it, and I must say (and I am not making this up), they were extremely enthusiastic to share their experience of watching it. That made me extremely happy. However, being the mankind-loving-person-that-I-am, I wanted to ensure that no one else missed the show. So, almost every single Indian friend of mine (that’s about 99.9 %, if you include my boss) knew that my opinion of the show and some of them (I hope) watched it. All my friends loved me for my recommendation. I realized it was time to take this global (in a way), and put it on the third most frequently visited site in the world(Google and Facebook being the first and second)… errr…  this one.
<br />This blog is dedicated to the show. The show which had me gripped for more than a week. The outline is pretty simple. Rahul Mahajan wants to get married for a second time, after his first wife (apparently) left him after drug and physical abuse. NDTV, showing outstanding judgment makes a show out of this. Oh wait… that is wrong. There was already a show, and this is the second season. The first one had Rakhi Sawant… and that was equally “Imagine”ative.  I didn’t have much respect for the one-shot wonder MBAs but after these two shows, I have grown to admire them. I’ll reserve that for a later blog though. For now, lets “focus”!  As the host, they chose the one and only Ram Kapoor. His charm was no match for Rahul’s… ahem. Anyways, show started with 16 (yes, you read that right… sixteen) out-of-this-world- -should-been-miss-universe-ten-times-over girls. Rahul was initially very confused. He had so many girls to choose from, he couldn’t believe his eyes. Neither could I, so I shut them instead. 
<br /><br />Coming to the girls…. Some of them were trying to be cuter-than-cupid, a few others were trying their hands at cooking, while the rest of the lot was just trying to get as-much-Rahul-as-they-could… because, of course, they loved-him-more-than-anyone-else-could-Imagine. One of them even confessed to loving him decades before they met. My guess is she may have started loving him even before he/she were born. A couple of others fell in love when they first saw him. It was as if, cupid was in Fatehgarh palace (that’s where the show was filmed) on the first day with unlimited supply opium-tipped arrows. And why wouldn’t cupid want to be there… there was so much beauty, brains, brawn, booze and balderdash on display. And boy, oh boy, was the opium strong. The girls looked like they were hooked to him for millennia. Some people have said that the girls had a hint of desperation in their actions, and they were looking for silver screendom. But you know me. I wouldn’t buy such cynicism ever. 
<br />The show also had its set of extremely accomplished guests. Movie and television stars who have made a mark for themselves, purely based on their acting talent, and ABSOLUTELY NOTHING ELSE. One such guest was… errr… Neha Dhupia… umm… uh-oh…  Anyways, moving on…
<br />The show was down to the final three, after many girls had to leave the show, and the love of their lives. It was truly heartbreaking for me to watch their true love not materialize. As they say, sometimes you crack an egg just to see what is inside. 
<br /><br />The final, as you might imagine, were the most eligible of the lot for him. RkS had reached its finale, and I finally caught up with all the episodes on <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.rahulswayamvar.in"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.rahulswayamvar.in</a>. I was waiting for the final decision. I was rooting for Dimpy I must confess. She was competing with two others who were equally beautiful, talented, accomplished in their… ahem… fields. Although the average age of the three girls was less than two-thirds of Rahul’s age, they were up-to-task in <strong>every</strong> <em>way</em>. 
<br /><br />Then came the fateful day, March 6th 2010, and the whole universe (except me… I was sleeping. I missed the live broadcast, but I did catch up the recorded one) held its breath. Everyone was anxious… and surprise, surprise, I hit the jackpot. Dimpy was the one!!! Times of India has a very flattering article about her. I encourage you to search to Google/Bing for it (Dimpy Ganguly interview).  Her pics on Google Images are equally good, or even better. A picture does speak a thousand words in this case.
<br />For all those people who haven’t watched it yet, and I hope there aren’t many, I strongly encourage you to watch it. Consider it a personal request from me. 
<br />Being the idealistically-romantic, completely-unsarcastic, gullible person that I am, you can see why I say this is the best show in the universe. 
<br />There <em>may</em> <span style="text-decoration:underline">one</span> <em>other </em>reason why I liked it. You see, before this show, I thought there were two types of humour. 
<br />1.	Humour by amatuers. The comedian in all of us.
<br />2.	Humour by the professionals. Professional comedians, cartoon-writers.
<br />Only after this show, did I realize the third way…
<br />Unintentional comedians. People who do not intend to be funny, but who end up making you laugh until your stomach breaks up. They bring you laughter by saying things you never expected. They really mean them… maybe. But they are so hilarious!
<br />If you didn’t heed my previous request, I hope you do take it seriously now. Watch it. I never knew Indian Television was this good!

<br />How often do we find that the biggest ironies come in real life, and go quite un-noticed by most of us? Quite often, actually. And this is one of those instances.
<br /><br />What is the first song you heard on radio when you are in a traffic jam? The traffic jam is probably the most confined place in the world! I assure you, it is the one place in the world you can't run out of. And, its the one thing which you have go through if you live in any place with a population greater than... well, in India, you can have a traffic jam even in the loneliest of junctions. And thats not a contradiction. So, now that we are in the greatest place in the world, we would like to make our lives a little worse. And the radio is the only companion, besides the sweat and the humming AC. And there you have it... the one song you never wanted to hear, the one song which everyone in India knows but wish they didn't, the one song which ostracizes its patrons. Its a song with a very deep nasal trademark. Its one of a million, the rest 999,999 songs playing on the other stations. Its a Reshmmiya song.
<br /><br />I would like to think that the world hates the songs, because poor HR is the punching bag for any journo who can't make up the lines for the page 3 script. But that isn't quite the case. It definitely isn't. Because as you surf thru the channels, all that you find is the one trademark voice, the trademark background music... well, even the copyleft pain!
<br /><br />And thats my point. How come the media criticizes a singer who rules the airwaves? and whose pics are on the telly more often than our prime minister (not Sonia!) Manmohan, albeit with a cap always! Its quite an irony that an apparent &quot;idol&quot;, is rubbished by the very popular media, and still retains his status, at the least! One of the million ironies in India... &quot;we love to hate HR&quot; or... &quot;we hate to love HR&quot;?
<br /><br />What was I doing when I heard HR's songs on my radio, well, i turned the radio off, and listened to my iPod, which btw, has no HR songs. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" />

She may not be able to play cricket (well, not as well as Bangladesh atleast!), but she can be &quot;seen&quot; with a cricketer. And thats not such a bad idea, since Mr. John isn't really the flavor of this month. 
<br /><br />The Indian cricket team is the most adored, and alternately hated, team in the world. They grab more column inches in most sections of the paper (forget sports, the page 3 and biz journos live off them). And when such demi-gods lose to our neighbouring mortals, the reactions are, quite obviously, very strong. Strong enough to &quot;demolish a house under-construction&quot;. The effigy-burning is quite a common phenomenon by now, and so, the news channels don't really bother covering them. In these situations, the country is split in two. One half of them believe that the team would do better to take the next flight back home. The other, probably influenced by the &quot;ladega toh jeetega&quot; campaign, believe that India should fight back. For the cricketers, I guess all this makes little difference because they were butchered nano-seconds are the loss. 
<br /><br />Whether the cricketers should be kept under such tight scrutiny and whether cricket is over-hyped is a question which is nearing the end of its time. I think the media has sucked all the money it can from the question. But there is another aspect of reporting, which carries an implicit message. That there are two teams when India talks about cricket. Not one.. but two! The other being our very fervent, lost-to-us-in-all-world-cup-matches neighbour. 
<br /><br />On saturday night, the top two stories of the news generated mixed reactions. The first about India's defeat to Bangladesh. The second about Pakistan's exit from the world cup, thanks to the one-day-wonder Ireland. The Irish announced their arrival on the international scene with a big-bang win over Pakistan. 
<br /><br />Indians therefore had two things on their mind. India's loss, which meant that India may return without even entering the second round. Pakistan's exit, which in some convoluted minds (like mine) meant that India had after beaten Pakistan to the post. India may well return, but Pakistan returns earlier! A small consolation, you may think, but in India, its a big prize. My condolences to the advertisers if India does come back before next weekend. 
<br /><br />In all this commotion, there was a tragedy which put all the events in a different perspective. The death of the Pakistani coach, Bob Woolmer, who was widely regarded as the pioneer of modern coaching techniques. That filled me with (a shock to begin with, and) a sadness which overshadowed everything else. I hope this world cup does not claim any more victims. It simply isn't worth it.
<br /><br />I always like to end on a happy note, but I think it is impossible to do so for this article. I hope India reaches the second round, and wins the world cup. Thats a hope, with a rider. Even if we don't win one more match in this world cup, I..... wouldn't blame any of the cricketers.

And the millionaire posters have turned into bisexual ones.  And I have broken my promise… I cursed them the moment Murali caught Rahul in the deep. And haven’t stopped ever since. Being a passionate cricket fan, and till recently, a  believer in the Indian cricket team, I was completely disappointed. There is one not-so-welcome outcome of the very-famous Natwest victory. There is one thread of hope which refuses to give up, until Sreesanth is back in the pavilion. 
<br />As I write this, I am listening to a few of the best songs in the recent past…  Yeh honsla (Dor) , Ajnabee shehar (Jaaneman), Rozana (Nishabd). 
<br />When I think of this exit, and its subsequent repercussions, I can’t help but imagine, HOW COME NO ONE ANTICIPATED THIS? It is very easy understand the poor little Indian fan who has all his emotions resting on the shoulders of 11 people whose credentials, besides cricket, are quite suspect. It is very easy to understand why the media hyped the team of 11/(1 billion) brains. + 1 Australian one. But how did the companies miss it? How is it that the companies stand to lose around 2 billion rupees, (initial estimates). Well, that is quite a mystery. But what is a bigger mystery, and probably the least quoted is how the greatest one of them all, Nostradamus, never wrote about this wonderful game? When one-sixth of the humanity is held in the grasp of a few men, how did Nostradamus miss this phenomenon and its outcome? I haven’t read any interpretations of his writings from the Indian cricket’s perspective. And I think I know the reason for the “apparent” gap in the “future portrait”. I am sure he would’ve had this on his mind, but did not put it on paper, for fear of being maligned. It’s not easy to predict the Indian team’s fortunes from a month away from the WC, leave alone a few centuries. ? 
<br />Well, now that the demi-gods are descending on our mortal land, what do we do about them? Shall we get them to work as mortals as a punishment? Or shall we condemn them to hell? Or shall we change the system? I have a few suggestions here which can work. We can always use diversity to our advantage. Team diversity. More teams, more chances of winning. Let BCCI select some of the really good cricketers around now, and make them into a team. Let it also add the ones with “senior recos” into other teams. The identity of the really talented team is kept secret for political and economic reasons! ? That would work. That way, everyone can find a cricketer to throw their old shoes at, and more posters to deface. And, even if one of them wins, we can feel that “hum lade… aur jeete bhi”! After all, it is not fair for 1 billion to show their anger on 11 + 1 men.
<br />My second suggestion is even more radical and wouldn’t require so many teams. It would  assure us of victories in every match. Here, I take a leaf out of the government’s think tank. The government has made it mandatory for all the channels to share their feed for matches involving India. Why doesn’t the government make it mandatory for all bookies to bet on India? That way, the bookies would do all the “coaxing” and “bring the best” out of the cricketers. Put in another way, “they would pray loud enough so that the demi-gods can hear and be forced to answer them”.  And, the bookies get a tax holiday and a swiss account as freebies. Howz that? Think they can be paid consultancy fees from the Fringe Benefit Tax accruals? ? 
<br />Well, I believe in God. And I believe he poses the challenges in our lives. This would be the first time, when we would force the gods (read cricketers) to answer our prayers.

A wonderful one. I know that even before I listen to it. But… there’s one song from Swades.. Yeh jo des hain tera. It fills me with that very deep feeling of patriotism. And by patriotism, I don’t mean how to make India better? It is this wonderful feeling of being an Indian. The place is wonderful. It may have the worst politicians in the world. It may have the most silent and uncaring public. The worst drivers. The power cuts. But its India. And I am an Indian. Frankly, this feeling I have right now is quite different from anything else I have ever experienced. This feeling doesn’t stop me from going to US. This feeling wont force me to stay here. I will do it over the course of time. I wont come back because this country needs my help, but quite simply because I love it. People. Food. Cricket. These are features of this country you wont get to experience even if you have a few million NRIs in your country. That’s when I realize that… no matter where I was born, I would have loved this country. Not love it “inspite of its faults”. Just… LOVE IT!

Sachin’s height. The most aerodynamic car. What do these all have in common? Well… they are all short. And a couple of them are admired for being short. I will let you choose your picks. My picks would be 300 and Music and Lyrics.
<br /><br />I watched 300 a couple of days ago. And I am glad I had to pay half as many bucks to watch it. Because, the effect, the sheer effect in an IMAX theater is overwhelming. The movie is very good not just because of its effects, but because of the lack of “complication”. Most people can’t distinguish between sophistication and complication. They merely assume both to mean stuff, which can cause make our mind go crazy, for good or bad reasons. 300 was sophisticated, not complicated. I was joking about this to my friend. I said “if the king returned back to find his wife had slept with another man, there may have been a further complication”. More often than not the complication destroys the movie. I loved watching 300. The ideas were original, the setup was excellent, and the actors was brilliant as usual.
<br /><br />In sharp contrast to the earth-shattering IMAX sounds, I watched Music and Lyrics y’day night on a laptop with headphones. The movie was an hour and a half, and it wasn’t complicated either. It had sophistication. Two people had to understand each other and realize that they knew more about each other than they knew about themselves. That, for me, was the essence of love. The movie wasn’t based on extravagant plots, and special effects with out-of-the-world sets. It probably didn’t have more than a dozen sets to begin with, and all of them were in the heart of New York.
<br /><br />To me, the second movie showcases love like no other. There is only one movie which comes close… You’ve got mail. The songs are beautiful, and so are the characters. They show how wonderfully simple love can be. How beautiful you can make it. And how we don’t need helicopters and sphinx shots to showcase it (Karan, wake up and smell the Koffee!). What I look forward to in a movie is an intoxicating blend of creativity and beauty. The former was in 300. The latter is in Music and Lyrics.
<br /><br />For many, the story may not be large enough. But, I like it short and sweet.

I drive it anywhere I want, drive it as fast as I want. Drive it to a race, and play hardball! Walk away with a few grand, some of which I use for a new coat of paint. Just for kicks, ram a few pedestrians in their teeny-weeny cars. The race didn’t do it for me… set a new speed record for the police. And yes… there they are, right on time! The cars have more power on their radios than at the wheels. I can hear them trying to scramble more and more cars, even as the existing ones are on their rims. And then… come the backup cars! By god, these can’t be the police cars! They are as fast as my Lambo!! And they drive more recklessly than me!!! But the radio is still full of their anxious voices. I lead them into the downtown area… drive past their “HQ”. The radio is a blur with all the turns and bumps… I slow down to let them know I know the traffic rules… “We got him surrounded”. I can feel a crash against the bumper. The mirrors have been warning me. And then… I bring to life… the V6. I unleash the power of over 500 horses! I disappear without a trace. The hounds are left smelling the burnt rubber. Now come their friends from the neighboring borough… it’s time to show them how the Lambo handles. The roads are winding, letting never either of us floor the pedal. But the low-end torque of the Lambo is surely the best in its class… the class of Super Cars. The handling is awesome. It’s as if the car seems to know which way I want to go. At the same time, it’s like a beast, which needs to be tamed. The cops are long gone, trying to change gears and keep up with the Lambo. For the couple that did follow, the gas station taught them a lesson they won’t forget in a hurry! On my way back to the garage I met a few cops, but the woods were there in time. The Traction Control and the muddy soil are a potent combination. Too much for the hounds, which should’ve stayed on their homely roads. I turn into the driveway, and see the reflection on the garage door. Not a scratch! It’s a wonderful car. It’s a wonderful drive. It’s the stuff intoxication paradise is made of!

<br /><br />1. Sachin ‘Ten’dulkar shouldn’t be asked to retire. After all, he has given his life to the game. He has the right to suck whatever life is left in it now. And quite seriously, how do you expect to know what is the newest product in the market without the girlish voice drooling over it?
<br />   2. It is not correct to expect Yuvraj to shut up when the BCCI tells him to. He did not bat when the whole of India wanted him to! And he is used to blabbering on TV ads anyways. Remember, he did give a one-liner there too!
<br />   3. Air India shouldn’t be blamed for the lack of nose-gear on some of its planes. Its after all, a million to one chance that something may go wrong in a plane, and on Air India, that millionth part turned out to be the front tyres. And don’t tell me the plane can’t run on sixteen other tyres.
<br />   4. It isn’t fair to expect Rahul to know history. Atleast not Indian history. After all, all our bedtime stories come from our parents. In his case, his father was flying around in planes, and so was his head. And his mother is an Italian. So, you should expect him to know Italian history.
<br />   5. Its not correct to oppose the reservations in education and/or jobs. After all, the Supreme Court did say “We like to be called backward”. So, the more number of “reserved seats”, the better... as more of &quot;India&quot; is “learning”.
<br />   6. It is not correct to expect Arjun to leave Manmohan in peace. It would be like Tony Blair giving up on George Bush. Too much love and hate to separate the two of them. And they are the solo supporters of the each other’s policy!
<br />   7. It is not fair to expect Miya Musharraf to give up his presidency and/or his chief of army post. Atleast the posts are Pakistani, unlike Kargil.
<br />   8. Its not fair to blame Air Deccan for a few “overbooked” seats. After all, everything in India is overbooked. From the trains, to the buses, to the seats, to the electricity, to the houses, to the concerts, to VIP (apparently!). Even stupidity.
<br />   9. Its not fair to expect Renuka Choudhary to stay on the “unequal” side of life. After all, women have been oppressed for a million years, and the vengeance should last another million, at the very least! And, why the hell oppose it when more than half of “man”kind in India is on the other side!
<br />  10. Its not fair to expect me to write a wonderful blog every time. Sarcasm is the bitter-sweet taste of life. Black humor is no one’s own. Sarcastic humor is an intoxication with no bounds.

These blogs do not represent the cutting edge (if there is such a thing) in blogs. These blogs do not represent the great strides mankind has made over the years. These blogs do not represent the brighter side of life. These blogs may not represent the truth always. These blogs may not be up-to-date. These blogs may be the greatest pieces of writing by an Indian (definitely better than anything written by Arundati Rai… the other Rai seems to have hit jackpot with Mr. Motorokr). These blogs are definitely very different from anything you may have read in your life. These blogs… these blogs… these blogs… well, I could go on forever, but let me keep it “short and sweet”. What you have been reading took me about a nanosecond to make up… and what I am about to write will take a millisecond for you to understand… this blog is the exhaustive definition of intoxicating crap.
<br /><br />And if you have remembered through all the “do not”s, “may not be”s, “may be”s and “definitely”s, this blog is in fact titled the sixth, and not the fifth. Well… the fifth was not really socially acceptable, but I intend to polish it before I put it up… (crap!)

I don’t think the analogy of parallel lines applies here, either. ‘coz once u talk of parallel lines, u know the distance between them. Here, they are just so far apart. U can’t measure the distance…
<br />The difference strikes you when you think of the VT shootout. What was a guy doing with a gun on a campus. More importantly, how in the world did he get hold of it. And even more shocking, how come this happens so frequently in US. The reason behind it is the stimulus for this article.
<br />Guns are available freely in the US. That’s a known fact. What is also known is that the gun lobby is very strong, and hence doesn’t let the “harmful” laws to limit the presence of “self-defence” arms. Well, ironically, the pistol didn’t even save the life of the miscreant at VT! To the un-“shielded” brains, the incident will look quite unbelievable. How can this be going on in a country which, otherwise, is a model for all the developing countries? Well, that’s quite true. It is a model for the developing countries to look at. The “developing” part of the country means that the country is going deeper into capitalism. And the leader of the Free World is showing us what it means to reach and live at that level. I am not an anti-capitalist. After all, my first job was a result of the proliferation of capitalism in this country. And the reason why the airline tickets are as low as the train fares is due to the same. And there are million more such examples. But the point I am trying to make here is that, we live in reality, not in the &quot;ideal&quot; world.
<br />But when the reality is filled with such punch-you-in-the-face stuff, how come I find that people stick onto morals. Why is it that people stick onto out-of-date principles, and perceptions about life? At some level, it’s hypocrisy. It’s a drive within a person which makes him choose to talk of morals. Which makes him try to ridicule the world around him, or watch in apparent “amazement” at the lack of morality. This is one of the most difficult questions to find answers to… it has been so for me. I find it quite simple. Morals have only one place in our society. They are taught to the tiny tots so that they believe that the world runs on “good” principles, and they live a blissfully happy time until they reach adolescence. And then they realize that life isn’t all about the good stuff, but its just as fun to live in. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/biggrin.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />To end on a happy note, life is just as much fun to live in, one way or another. There aren’t many rules in life, except for the ones we impose on ourselves. And I personally have found that a more practical understanding of the world un-complicates most of the events. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />By the way, a final thought... doesn't realism meet idealism (around... lets say 21) ?
