Hint: it’s the exact opposite of boring cardio, but with no cardio at all…<br /><br />My 1 &quot;weird&quot; old trick of a flatter belly, and how this trimmed our stomachs much faster than boring and painful ‘abs’ exercises…<br /><br />How this tasty little dish we ate late at night actually boosted one of the most powerful fat loss hormones in our bodies while we slept the night away…<br /><br />How we accessed this old motivation trick for a leaner, healthier body so powerful, it’s been passed down for decades &amp; used by some of the hottest celebrities still today…<br /><br />1. Fad Diets That Work? Forget It!… You WON’T lose weight fast and keep it off by just eating low carb diets, low fat diets, or low calorie diets. The truth is, fast weight loss that lasts comes down to a diet that works, but that is right for you. You’re going to discover an easy way you can &quot;trick&quot; your body into burning more calories by eating more of these delicious and healthy fat burning foods that fight your cravings… 2. Cardio Doesn’t Work Like This… Those long and frequent cardio or aerobic workouts from quick weight loss programs are among the WORST WAYS to burn fat. You’re going to see how to boost your fat loss and fitness results by exercising in almost the complete OPPOSITE manner with these tips for just 45 minutes a WEEK…with no separate cardio at all! 3. You Probably Won’t Lose Any Real Belly Fat With Sit-ups &amp; Ab Gizmos… 1000?s of crunches, sit ups, or those crappy infomercial abs gizmos WILL NOT allow you to lose belly fat or give you a flatter stomach and certainly not six pack abs. You’re going to learn how to lose stomach fat 5 times faster with these full body exercises that don’t actually target your abs at all…<br /><br />4. Late Night Eating Can Actually Help Burn Fat &amp; Fight Cravings… Going to bed hungry is actually one of the WORST THINGS YOU CAN DO. You’re going to discover you can boost fat loss in your body by eating the right type of tasty little dish an hour or so before you go to sleep… 5. The ‘Fat Burning Zone’ Is A BIG Mistake… The &quot;fat burning zone&quot; you see on most cardio machines is actually the LAST THING you want to follow to burn the most body fat. You’re going to burn fat and calories for up to 3 days like we do with this VERY DIFFERENT rapid and simple workout that takes an average of just 15 minutes… 6. ‘Toning’ Your Muscles Doesn’t Work… Trying to &quot;tone&quot; your body by using light weights or high repetitions is a BIG WASTE OF TIME. You will experience nearly ZERO results this way, especially after a few weeks. But now you’re going to see how to start cutting stubborn pounds… all while sculpting a leaner and sexier body that will burn your stored body fat for energy with this 1 overlooked technique… <br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvYmVhdXR5Lw__" target="_blank">diet plans</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvZGVudGFsLWhlYWx0aC8_" target="_blank">weight loss exercise</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvYWRkaWN0aW9uLw__" target="_blank">diet definition</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvbWVkaXRhdGlvbi8_" target="_blank">weight loss calculator</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvbWVucy1oZWFsdGgv" target="_blank">weight loss resources</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvZ2VuZXJhbC8_" target="_blank">atkins diet</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvZXhlcmNpc2UtZml0bmVzcy8_" target="_blank">weight loss diet</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvZGlldHMtd2VpZ2h0LWxvc3Mv" target="_blank">atkins diet</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvbWVudGFsLWhlYWx0aC8_" target="_blank">unexplained weight loss</a>

I also achieved emotional, physical and financial goals I never thought possible. I believe your success can be traced back to something as simple as desire. Answer one question – ‘How Bad Do You Want It?’ If you want it bad, you can win like I did, you just need the right program and keep your desire burning.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I’m a 40 year old mom of 3, ages 11, 6 and 4. Before, I was 85 kg and 36.5% body fat, size 40. I was fat and miserable. My family life and relationship were suffering. My husband knew someone who did Burn The Fat and it changed his life, so I tried it too. I lost 15 kg in 8 months and kept it off. Because of my desire to be &quot;hot at 40,&quot; I took it to a new level. Tom taught me how and I lost another 8 kgs in 3 months and did my first bikini competition!&quot;<br /><br />I’m Tom Venuto… and yes, I really am a 7-time Natural (steroid-free) Bodybuilding Champion… and NO you DO NOT have to become a bodybuilder to quickly get into the best shape of your life.<br /><br />I’ve been working with regular people of all shapes and sizes for over 20 years as a trainer, gym manager and fat loss coach.<br /><br />Plus I’ve authored more than 500 articles on fitness and nutrition and I’ve been featured on over two dozen radio shows including Martha Stewart Healthy Living (on Sirius Satellite radio), 1250-ESPN and WCBS-AM New York…<br /><br />You can find me all over the internet as well as in print. I’ve written for many major fitness magazines including Muscle and Fitness, IRONMAN magazine, Men’s Fitness, and I was recently featured in Oprah magazine.<br /><br />The reason my fat loss system has been praised and publicized is because the secret behind my 49-Day Body Transformation doesn’t just help you move the needle on your scale…<br /><br />… it helps you achieve permanent fat loss while protecting your lean muscle tissue. &quot;Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle&quot; – that’s what it’s all about.<br /><br />But as you’ve probably discovered, most weight loss is temporary at best. That’s because most diets are designed for you to fail.<br /><br />The people behind them have never worked alongside real people to see what it really takes to make a change.<br /><br />They don’t know the struggle regular people endure to overcome a lifetime of bad habits and faulty information.<br /><br />My system is the only one backed by 20 years of “in the trenches” fitness training with real people. I’ve personally guided thousands of people as they transformed their bodies and took control over their lives.<br /><br />With my system you will work WITH your body’s natural type – not against it – to burn fat and re-energize your metabolism so you can keep it off forever. And I’ll be explaining exactly how we’ll do that in this short letter.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvYmVhdXR5Lw__" target="_blank">weight loss diet</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvZGVudGFsLWhlYWx0aC8_" target="_blank">balanced diet</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvcmVtZWRpZXMv" target="_blank">diet plans</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvZXhlcmNpc2UtZml0bmVzcy8_" target="_blank">diets to lose weight</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvZGlldHMtd2VpZ2h0LWxvc3Mv" target="_blank">dukan diet</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvc2xlZXAtYW5kLWRyZWFtcy8_" target="_blank">fast weight loss</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvYWRkaWN0aW9uLw__" target="_blank">weight loss diet</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvbWVucy1oZWFsdGgv" target="_blank">diet definition</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvbWVkaXRhdGlvbi8_" target="_blank">fast weight loss</a>

As expected, none of them worked…<br /><br />After trying out many different diets and still failing to lose weight, I was frustrated and on the verge of giving up. It wasn’t until I met this guy during a gym session whom I shared my frustrations with. It turned out that he too was overweight before. But he lost close to 40 pounds in just one month and was now doing work outs at the gym to maintain his new body weight.<br /><br />He was a fitness enthusiast and he explained to me why I wasn’t seeing results. The reason was actually very simple — all of the the programs I was following were never meant to work!<br /><br />Diet plan fail they DO NOT tackle the root problem and instead of losing weight, one or more of the following happens to you:<br /><br />You experience Muscle Loss: The rapid weight loss of most diets is attributed to muscle loss. And that is counterproductive as you need muscles to burn body fat!<br /><br />You experience Water Retention Loss: Most diets produce fascinating short-term results as you lose water from your body instead of fat. (It’s not sustainable and could land you in hospital)…<br /><br />You undergo Intolerable Starvation: Some diets advocate drastically reducing how much you eat (It’s almost impossible to maintain and torturous to endure)…<br /><br />You overwork your body with an Extreme Exercise Regime: Some programs recommend that you exercise a lot, to the point where it becomes harmful to you and your body.<br /><br />For most weight loss companies and products, I dare say (And I’ve experienced first-hand) that their program is definitely NOT SUITABLE for us to lose weight… Now, what’s the reason? Well, simple! If every single client were to successfully lose weight, they’ll be out of business…<br /><br />So Darren, the guy I met at the gym, told me about the HCG diet plan, a new method of losing weight that have worked exceptionally well for some of his friends and it obviously did for him too… Although I had my doubts, I decided to give it a shot. Since I’ve tried out so many diet programs already, I figured I had nothing to lose… At first, I thought I couldn’t last one week of the HCG diet plan, but it turned out, not only did I successfully completed the whole program, I didn’t feel it was as hard as other diets I’ve experienced… The results too were shocking! In just over one month, I lost almost 60 pounds and it just could only get better…<br /><br />Today, weighing in at only 75kg, I’ve successfully lost a whopping 65kg and living out my life more than ever…<br /><br />The HCG diet plan is designed to fit the lifestyle of the people of the 21st century. It focuses mainly on fat-loss only…<br /><br />Now the HCG diet plan has so many benefits and in fact, it is a widely recognized diet program heavily featured in the media.<br /><br />It has totally turned my life around and I want YOU to experience the same kind of change in your life.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvYWRkaWN0aW9uLw__" target="_blank">atkins diet</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvbWVucy1oZWFsdGgv" target="_blank">diet plans</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvZGVudGFsLWhlYWx0aC8_" target="_blank">diet plans</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvYmVhdXR5Lw__" target="_blank">quick diets</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvbWVkaXRhdGlvbi8_" target="_blank">quick diets</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvbWVudGFsLWhlYWx0aC8_" target="_blank">quick diets</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvZ2VuZXJhbC8_" target="_blank">diet plans</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvbnV0cml0aW9uLw__" target="_blank">balanced diet</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvcmVtZWRpZXMv" target="_blank">dukan diet</a>

I am proud to direct them to your web site to check it out for them selves without hesitation. I know they will get the right advice and wealth of information.<br /><br />&quot;In a world filled with dubious diet books, Eating for Energy identifies the proven steps that will lead to abundant health, a fit body, and radiant energy. I can’t think of a better book on healthy eating to help you get from where you are to where you want to be. It is easy, understandable, inspiring, and applicable. It’s the best tool to come along in years. &quot;<br /><br />&quot;Yuri, this is the first time ever I’ve taken time out to write a testimonial. But I’m just so excited about Eating for Energy. I haven’t felt this good in years.<br /><br />I’ve been suffering with perimenopause for the last five years which made me feel like I was going insane.<br /><br />I love your recipes and the 12 week meal plan is great – it keeps me focus on eating right. I have so much energy its scary. I know its only been three weeks but I feel like I could eat this way forever. I also purchased Eating for Energy Best Life Ever package over the weekend. I just started listening to it at work today and there’s so much incredible information I don’t know where to start. I could go on and on. I just can’t thank you enough.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I was about 100 lbs over weight from stress and lack of exercise. I thought I was eating healthy and juiced occasionally. However, your well-researched book showed me otherwise. I am trying to do at least one green juice a day.<br /><br />Within the first week, people were commenting to me that I had lost weight. Also many women are telling me how beautiful my skin is. Now I am doing two juices a day – one fruit and one green veggie and have discovered that I am not as hungry.<br /><br />Part of your program is helping me reduce time spent in other areas. For instance, I am juicing more which means less cooking and more time for exercise and other activities. I never thought about it before but my vita mix is really my stove.<br /><br />I know that once my results are significantly better, people will ask “how did you do it?” Weight Watchers? Atkins? South Beach? None of the above – I am going to shout Yuri’s Eating for Energy! I feel greatttt!!<br /><br />&quot;I have been trying to find a way to cure my Rheumatoid arthritis. The approach you recommend in your book makes the most sense of any yet. I have been vegetarian since December 2007. I have lost 26 pounds so far and I am feeling so much better. I notice a difference in how much better I feel when my PH is alkaline. I hope to continue my learning and cure myself. I’ll keep you posted. Thank you for the book and all the great information in it.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Yuri, your book &quot;Eating for Energy&quot; has been…<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvZ2VuZXJhbC8_" target="_blank">weight loss exercise</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvYWRkaWN0aW9uLw__" target="_blank">weight loss tips</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvbWVkaXRhdGlvbi8_" target="_blank">diet plans</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvZGVudGFsLWhlYWx0aC8_" target="_blank">weight loss tips</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20v" target="_blank">diet tips</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvZGlldHMtd2VpZ2h0LWxvc3Mv" target="_blank">fast weight loss</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvZXhlcmNpc2UtZml0bmVzcy8_" target="_blank">diet plans</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvYmVhdXR5Lw__" target="_blank">diet tips</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvbWVucy1oZWFsdGgv" target="_blank">diet for weight loss</a>

This created the foundation for Turbulence Training and has now changed the course of fat loss training forever.<br /><br />In the second landmark study that helped create the Turbulence Training method, researchers found that performing 8 repetitions per set of an exercise helped women burn more calories after exercise in comparison to using 12 repetitions per exercise.<br /><br />(NOTE): Not only did the results of this study destroy the high-reps, low-weight myth, it also proved that the Turbulence Training principles are as effective in women as they are in men.<br /><br />SCIENCE FACT: The fat-loss programs you read about in muscle mags from the 80?s and 90?s are based on out-of-date exercise science and nutrition information.<br /><br />SCIENCE FACT: Exercise science has advanced by leaps and bounds just in the last two decades. The latest fat loss research, which Turbulence Training is based on, allows you to lose more fat while keeping your hard-earned muscle, and doing so with less time working out than ever before.<br /><br />SCIENCE FACT: Fat loss programs that require you to do endless hours of long, slow, boring cardio workouts will rarely help you achieve your fat loss goals and may lead to over use injuries.<br /><br />SCIENCE FACT: You need to use more advanced, modern training methods, such as Turbulence Training Intervals, to help you burn more calories in and out of the gym. With Turbulence Training cardio, you will skyrocket your post-workout metabolism allowing you to burn almost twice as many calories as you would with traditional cardio workouts.<br /><br />SCIENCE FACT: Traditional fat burning programs typically don’t even mention strength training in their instructions, because most trainers and clients don’t understand how resistance training will help fat loss. Even if your fat loss program does recommend strength training, it’s likely that you’ve been told to use the ineffective and outdated method of high reps and low weight (which does NOT burn fat!).<br /><br />SCIENCE FACT: If you want to maximize your metabolism, and get defined arms, abs, and legs, then you must include strength training in your fat loss workout. High intensity strength training with the Turbulence Training system helps protect your lean muscle mass, which you are almost certain to lose on traditional diet and exercise programs<br /><br />These are the facts. The research simply does not lie. The way you are currently training is probably not only getting you less than satisfactory results, but may actually be causing overuse injuries, or even catabolic muscle loss.<br /><br />Over time, the Turbulence Training philosophy got even better as I refined, tweaked and re-tested it on myself and my clients until it became a complete training and nutrition methodology and series of workout programs that started producing such breathtaking results for my clients that they could hardly believe it.

Thanks for all of the work and insight Chad Fenwick, PhD (Candidate)<br /><br />I purchased ESE last April and I saw incredible results and I was close to my goal of a 6 pack by mid May. I know it sounds cliche, but I truly do no longer &quot;live to eat,&quot; but rather &quot;eat to live.&quot; It’s incredibly liberating. And I love people’s reaction when they ask me how I did it and I tell them &quot;intermittent fasting.&quot; They look at me blankly tell them the Eat Stop Eat story. The smart ones are inquisitive about it, and the even smarter ones are giving it a try (one of my co-workers and her sister fasted yesterday and said it went well). All that said, keep up the great work! Sincerely, Louis Ressler<br /><br />Brad, ESE has helped me feel the best I’ve ever felt. I was worried about it at first, but then upon Brad’s advice after an e-mail exchange, I just tried it out. It’s been life changing. It’s helped me feel like I’m free from food and because I don’t have to worry about getting so much food in a certain day helped me get more variety back in my diet. I recommend to just about everyone that they go out and get ESE and try it out. I love ESE! Brian Wittman<br /><br />Hi Brad, Eat Stop Eat is the easiest way to lose weight. If you’re tired of all the complicated diets out there, just give a try to this way of intermittent fasting. Just think about it, do nothing and lose weight. I want to thank Brad for giving us this simple solution and for his work documenting the facts about this way of life. You really can make this a part of your lifestyle. Can you see yourself incorporating your actual diet into your lifestyle? With this, you really can. Just try it! All the best, Cristian<br /><br />Hi Brad, I’ve been following the ESE lifestyle since it came out in 2007. I will not go back to my compulsive eating again. No more good &amp; bad foods. No more thinking about food more than living life. Life is more than food &amp; getting enough protein (loved the book by the way). That is what this ESE is about. The flexibility of fasting to control calories is just an added bonus. Thank You for all the research you have done and for standing your ground against OCE. Denise Nelson<br /><br />My fasting days are my most productive. I am not as hungry today as I was that day after eating twice in the morning. I noticed that in the book you say that people make about 200 choices about food everyday, which I totally agree with. I could not believe how much free time I have now on my fasting days. The biggest problem I had on my first day of fasting was not that I was too hungry, but I was too bored. I was not sure what to do with all my time. I have found it easier to…<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvcmVtZWRpZXMv" target="_blank">unexplained weight loss</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvYmVhdXR5Lw__" target="_blank">weight loss resources</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvZXhlcmNpc2UtZml0bmVzcy8_" target="_blank">diet plans</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvbWVkaXRhdGlvbi8_" target="_blank">weight loss diet</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20v" target="_blank">lose weight fast</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvc2xlZXAtYW5kLWRyZWFtcy8_" target="_blank">weight loss tips</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvYWRkaWN0aW9uLw__" target="_blank">quick diets</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvZ2VuZXJhbC8_" target="_blank">atkins diet</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvZGVudGFsLWhlYWx0aC8_" target="_blank">weight loss diet</a>

The study, conducted by the Harvard School of Public Health, quizzed over 120,000 nurses and other health workers about their dietary habits over the course of many years. The goal was to discover what impact diet had on weight over time.<br /><br />Here’s the deal: Whether or not you like it the drug industry (and that includes doctors) are in it to make money. And while you’re health is a large priority, the fat cats in the industry and even the doctors themselves hope and prey that you will never discover this information. What’s more, they do everything in their power to make sure information like this never sees the light of day! They’d rather keep selling you and me half-ass solutions that deliver severely lacking results…if any…so that you have no choice but to keep coming back to them. The truth is, there’s a whole world of little known, all-natural remedies out there. Many of which have been proven to cure many of today’s most pressing ailments… You just never hear about them. Why? Because if people knew about these things…the drug industry would lose BILLIONS of dollars. Thousands of doctors would soon be practice-less! It’s a horrible but true fact: it’s just not in the best interest of the doctors to tell you about some alternative natural approach. Especially one that actually works so amazingly well to tackle the root cause of your problem. You see, during my research I made a shocking discovery…<br /><br />‘The Greek Yogurt Diet’ Reveals The Only All-Natural, Proven, 2-Step System That Is 100% Guaranteed To reduce body fat and restore health by repairing your digestion…naturally!

I know it will never come back once you really beat the root cause.<br /><br />&quot;I had Diabetic Renal Disease before I saw Rachelle Gordon’s Kidney Diet Secret Book and figured what could I lose. Well, it saved me another surgery and a whole lot of confidence in me. Im back working now and I can now spend time with my family once again. A true blessing indeed!&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Rachelle, without your advice I would still be suffering from renal failure. Thanks a bunch! I did what you recommended and was very satisfied with the results. I hope you dont mind if I would pass your methods to other kidney disease patients.&quot;<br /><br />These are some of the unsolicited comments that I get from clients who have kidney disease and was able to manage them successfully without expensive surgeries, toxic drugs, or costly and repeated doctor consultations…<br /><br />…If you think this guaranteed-to-work diet method can make a difference to you and your family in the coming years, then I ask you to drop everything and prepare to have both eyes opened intently.<br /><br />You are about to discover what might be the most powerful system that was ever created to manage kidney diseases. It’s the same system that hundreds of kidney patients, just like you, have been using since the dawn of this decade.<br /><br />These methods were originally kept secret by the leading nephrologists and dietitians for reasons that I will discuss in a while. You will be blown away why this has not gone mainstream yet.<br /><br />My name is Rachelle Gordon, and over the past 10 years, ive been working extensively in hospitals mainly in the Intensive Care Unit and in the out-patient department– two places where you normally see a whole lot of kidney disease sufferers ranging from acute/chronic renal failure, diabetic renal disease, kidney stones to polycystic kidney disease.<br /><br />My experience as a kidney/renal nurse for 10 years has taught me a sure-fire, proven and tested system that is backed by some of the top nephrologists in the country today.<br /><br />In addition, the active medical research that I have been doing for the past 7 years specifically for kidney disease sufferers has led me to deliver this diet method to more kidney disease sufferers.<br /><br />In addition, my private practice as a health consultant for kidney sufferers since early 2003 has given me an avenue to test this system out on clients with various kidney diseases. Hence, you see the unsolicited testimonials on this website.<br /><br />As you will see in a little while, I have been devouring all the information that I can about the ongoing research on kidney diseases. So caught up that I often get a research finding even before they get published in the medical journals.<br /><br />I studied all of this from any angle you would look at it in the academe, I have been exposed to countless kidney disease patients in my extensive years of clinical rotations and being a researcher myself, there is very little that I dont know about kidney diseases.<br /><br />If you belong to the at-risk group of kidney disease sufferers or you already have the symptoms of having a kidney disease, then you owe it to yourself and your family to read on… This will be one of the most important letters you will ever read.<br /><br />Statistics taken from 2007 health survey show millions of Americans have kidney disease in a certain degree of seriousness and dont know it. And as you may have realized already, it is definitely not your fault.<br /><br />I’m not just saying that either – you really will be able to see huge improvements in just a short space of time if you follow what you’re about to discover.<br /><br />Leading US Nephrologists Strongly Believe… There Is Lack Of Effective Care Among Kidney Disease Patients.<br /><br />Since late 1990?s, a lot of medical journal articles have been springing…<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvZGlldHMtd2VpZ2h0LWxvc3Mv" target="_blank">diets that work</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvbnV0cml0aW9uLw__" target="_blank">diet plans</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvbWVudGFsLWhlYWx0aC8_" target="_blank">weight loss tips</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvbWVucy1oZWFsdGgv" target="_blank">weight loss resources</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvcmVtZWRpZXMv" target="_blank">lose weight fast</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvYWRkaWN0aW9uLw__" target="_blank">diets that work</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvc2xlZXAtYW5kLWRyZWFtcy8_" target="_blank">slimming world</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvYmVhdXR5Lw__" target="_blank">weight loss exercise</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvZGVudGFsLWhlYWx0aC8_" target="_blank">weight loss tips</a>

Many years ago when I had just started writing for magazines and so forth I used to supplement my income getting fitness models and bodybuilders into shape for competitions.<br /><br />As my clients starting winning competitions and modeling contracts, I ended up getting a very good reputation for being &quot;the man&quot; to work with. This ended up with everybody from rich businessmen and women to Olympic athletes, pro golfers and everybody else in between coming to me for advice on how to get lean.<br /><br />This focus on fat loss, ended up translating into more and more research, more and more study, I also concentrated on what worked for the average guy and woman living under the normal conditions of working, looking after kids perhaps, basically people with not a lot of time on their hands and those not wanting to have to become scientists to understand how to lose fat.<br /><br />This popularity led to virtually hundreds of faxes, letters, and in the last ten years, emails. I would constantly get the same questions :<br /><br />Over my life time I must have received those 3 questions, or some variation of those 3 questions, somewhere in the region of 100,000 times!<br /><br />It was impossible to keep up with, combined with the fact I was also spending hundreds of hours a month researching supplements educating consumers on what worked and what didn’t, I was spending more time helping people and answering emails and such than I was working.<br /><br />&quot;I have worked with all kinds of people from all walks of life…<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvZGlldHMtd2VpZ2h0LWxvc3Mv" target="_blank">weight loss diet</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvZXhlcmNpc2UtZml0bmVzcy8_" target="_blank">diet plans</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvZ2VuZXJhbC8_" target="_blank">fast weight loss</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvbWVkaXRhdGlvbi8_" target="_blank">diet definition</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvZGVudGFsLWhlYWx0aC8_" target="_blank">dukan diet</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvYmVhdXR5Lw__" target="_blank">weight loss calculator</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvcmVtZWRpZXMv" target="_blank">weight loss exercise</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvbnV0cml0aW9uLw__" target="_blank">lose weight fast</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvbWVudGFsLWhlYWx0aC8_" target="_blank">weight loss exercise</a>

That was me. 60 minutes weights and 60 minutes horrible hard cardio 6 days a week and then I’d go demolish an entire box of Crunchy Nut Cornflakes. Pointless.<br /><br />Everyone is busy. No one has enough time. The approach to fat loss that is going to work for you has to fit sustainably into your life. The majority of the day to day small steps you take need to be geared towards sustainable lifestyle choices. After years of learning the slow way I have discovered the 6 simple steps that anyone who has failed at fat loss before can take quickly and without giving up your favourite food or doing a ton of exercise. Most importantly what has worked for me and for all my clients will also work for you.<br /><br />I designed this program as the alternative to the programs that are guaranteed to TORMENT you, COST PLENTY &amp; leave you both FRUSTRATED &amp; FATTER.<br /><br />Have you considered how (&amp; if<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/unsure.gif" alt=":)" /> your program will fit in with your ideal lifestyle LONG TERM…there’e no joy in an ideal body &amp; zero quality of life.<br /><br />The Brain b4 Body approach makes fat loss natural &amp; your new body sustainable because it aligns your fat loss goal with everything that you value, excel at &amp; love.<br /><br />Silencing Self Sabotage has the 3 mistakes to avoid when embarking on your fat loss program covered…<br /><br />I’ll also show you how to break through the 4 biggest problems you’ll have sticking to most diet and exercise programs…<br /><br />=&gt; Do You Feel STUCK because you’re living confined to a body that doesn’t reflect the success you’ve already created in other areas of your life?<br /><br />=&gt; Have you seen huge inspiring GOALS PASS YOU BY because you lack the energy to make them a reality?<br /><br />How does the system work? =&gt; Steps 1 &amp; 2 = Define &amp; Align: Uncover what makes you do what you do (or not do what you don’t do!) and then align everything that you do naturally, easily and sustainably with your fat loss goal. =&gt; Steps 3 &amp; 4 = Eradicate &amp; Educate: Why what you’ve been doing doesn’t work &amp; what to do instead. Here we eliminate limiting emotions, beliefs and secondary gain.

system and got KILLER results.<br /><br />How about with a Biology grad, who’s studied virtually countless cases, coached thousands of others who were overweight and obese, and written hundreds of papers dealing with nutrition, dieting, and the scientific connection between our DNA and weight gain-and how it can all be turned around by following a STRUCTURED action plan?<br /><br />Can you imagine how much FASTER your progress of losing 10, 20, or even 50 pounds of extra ‘weight’ will be?<br /><br />Instead, it’s what’s behind the curtain that HASN’T been shared with you yet that’s really valuable, because there hasn’t been anyone generous enough to share the true inside secrets that the pros on magazine covers really use to melt of buckets of fat in a few short days on command.<br /><br />Truth is, in life if you’d like bad situations to change then you must accept the change you’re going to make in order to get from point A to Z to actually make it happen.<br /><br />I’m going to give you right tools and share with you how I’m able to stay incredibly lean and shockingly defined all year round at an insane 4.3 – 4.9 percent body fat.<br /><br />In the dictionary, the word: &quot;Thermo&quot; comes from the Greek words thermss, or thirme, which means: &quot;heat,&quot; or &quot;hot&quot;.<br /><br />&quot;Ology&quot; is short for Biology – which of course is the science of life or living matter in all its forms (ah, I love science… don’t mind me, that’s just the bookworm speaking in me).<br /><br />Simply put…&quot;Thermodymology&quot; is about cutting your workout time (in the gym or at home) by over 70 percent using the new scientifically selected &quot;IRM&quot; Intense Rapid Movement style of training, combined with killer nutrition for the FASTEST fat loss humanly possible.<br /><br />WARNING: This specific training won’t be easy, it’s intense, tremendously effective, and highly addictive… in fact it may just kick your butt into another dimension.<br /><br />Because I make sure to keep it very exciting, challenging, and FAST paced so you work up a sweat in a few short minutes and hit 3 different body parts in one rip roaring workout that is usually LESS than 20 minutes.<br /><br />With minimal rest of 0 to 15 seconds in between and at 1/3 the time of normal workouts, you’ll be able to get a workout in and get out with easily TRIPLE the results in less than half the time.<br /><br />This same scientific &quot;Champion Certified&quot; formula is backed by countless of successful student test runs and trials that allow you to begin at your pace (which doesn’t make it easy, but it makes it flexible).<br /><br />For example, at certain points if you feel you need more than a 15 second break between intervals, then you can take the max rest of 30 seconds between sets.<br /><br />As you begin to &quot;upgrade&quot; your body’s fitness level then you can turn it up a notch and go for no rest during the entire routine, which I show you (if that’s even sane).<br /><br />After years of schooling and training with Olympic level track stars I finally figured out what was missing…<br /><br />After I found out what it was I formulated a no-fail system that was the answer to all of my burning questions.<br /><br />This is where I cover the concrete principals, strategies and easy-to-implament key methods which include:<br /><br />I’ll be your personal fitness coach through every day of the week, month, and entire program from start to finish.<br /><br />Large colorful photographs covering over 25 full body training exercises with &quot;how to&quot; images and step by step instructions.<br /><br />Having trouble finding pulse pounding workouts that really crank up your fat loss FASTER than you can tie your shoe laces?<br /><br />Here I document photos and descriptions of my exact workout routines that I use to DOMINATE the competition while I get ready for fitness model shows.<br /><br />I can’t think of ANYTHING more important to dropping the pounds and shaping your body then carefully designed meals… after all “you are what you eat” (80% of what we look and feel like is directly related to this) so do it right!<br /><br />In this special report (which I’ve never shared before) I go into the EXACT &quot;paint-by-numbers&quot; steps I used in order to drop 10 pounds in only 3 short days.<br /><br />This is the same unique strategy and tactic that helps me get down to an absolutely skin-tight 3.8% body fat in order to get ready for some last minute magazine photo-shoots.<br /><br />To help you get a grip on how &quot;busy&quot; my schedule actually is I’d have to invite you to come along with me on all the international flights, business meetings and private parties that my career demands. And that’s not to mention my time with family and friends.<br /><br />I use this special blueprint for EMERGENCIES ONLY since it may cause a severe case of fast fat loss-addiction!<br /><br />The reality is this ISN’T for everyone, in fact for some people it might even be dangerous, and it must not be used more than once per month!<br /><br />And if you EVER feel yourself &quot;letting go&quot; a few months down the road you…<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvc2xlZXAtYW5kLWRyZWFtcy8_" target="_blank">weight loss resources</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvcmVtZWRpZXMv" target="_blank">diet definition</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvbnV0cml0aW9uLw__" target="_blank">balanced diet</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvbWVudGFsLWhlYWx0aC8_" target="_blank">lose weight fast</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvZGlldHMtd2VpZ2h0LWxvc3Mv" target="_blank">atkins diet</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvZXhlcmNpc2UtZml0bmVzcy8_" target="_blank">weight loss calculator</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20v" target="_blank">diet definition</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvZ2VuZXJhbC8_" target="_blank">weight loss diet</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvbWVkaXRhdGlvbi8_" target="_blank">slimming world</a>

The jocks always poking fun at me and putting me down, and it did a number on my self-esteem and confidence.<br /><br />Have you faced the feeling yet of being with a girl the first time and she views only your chest and not you as a person? I sure did. (IF I ever got the courage to talk to her.)<br /><br />Always pulling on the front of my shirt or wearing two shirts… I got so good at those stupid excuses: &quot;I’m keeping my shirt on… because I’m sunburned…&quot;<br /><br />The final straw was about 3 years ago when my kids got older. They started asking the hard questions. (No, not the sex ones.) The pool ones.<br /><br />&quot;Can we go to the pool, Daddy?&quot; I bet I said no a hundred times. I soon realized… (with the nudging of my wife) I was losing valuable ‘quality’ time. Time I couldn’t get back.<br /><br />I was absolutely sick and tired of being sick and tired of being so preoccupied with my man boobs… You know you’ve got a problem when you think about your chest more than your wife’s…<br /><br />I could no longer live this kind of life. I started thinking really deeply about how badly I wanted to become… well… for lack of a better word… normal. I just wanted to fit in.<br /><br />Life had to be better than the way I was living it. I imagined the difference it would make… just with my wife! I know they say that men are the only ones that are visual… but I NOW KNOW from talking with my wife- It wasn’t the biggest turn-on in the world.<br /><br />This was it, I was really going to do this. I had made the decision and there was no turning back. I was going to prove everyone wrong and show them exactly what I was made of. I was MORE than these damn man boobs.<br /><br />All those diets I went on- starving myself to death- only to see ZERO change in my chest. I got to the point where I really WISHED I could believe them but refused to get burned again. I had had it up to HERE!… and didn’t know what to do<br /><br />And it all came together when I was on vacation with my wife in the mountains… (we didn’t go to the beach back them)<br /><br />We’re checking out the local library because we didn’t have the kids and just wanted to lie around and read… I was looking through the ancient books (small town) when this aged book caught my eye. When you get the system, you’ll fully understand why.<br /><br />The system does something that no other system can do for you… GET RESULTS… without gut-wrenching diets… without spending hours at the gym… and without taking dangerous pills.<br /><br />Don’t take my word for it… Listen to exactly how well the system worked for Fred, who by the way only started using it one week ago.<br /><br />Trey told me he was going to get rid of…<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvbWVkaXRhdGlvbi8_" target="_blank">diet tips</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvZGlldHMtd2VpZ2h0LWxvc3Mv" target="_blank">fast weight loss</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvZXhlcmNpc2UtZml0bmVzcy8_" target="_blank">weight loss tips</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvc2xlZXAtYW5kLWRyZWFtcy8_" target="_blank">fast weight loss</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvYWRkaWN0aW9uLw__" target="_blank">diets that work</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvZ2VuZXJhbC8_" target="_blank">unexplained weight loss</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvbWVudGFsLWhlYWx0aC8_" target="_blank">weight loss tips</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvcmVtZWRpZXMv" target="_blank">weight loss resources</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5iZS1mZS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvbnV0cml0aW9uLw__" target="_blank">diet plans</a>

Some may be minor, others may be life threatening. You may need to lose 100 pounds or an extra 10 pounds but, regardless of your situation, the solution is the same – &quot;The Rapid Action Metabolism (RAM)™ Fat Burning System.”<br /><br />In fact, thousands of people have cut back on their calories and increased their exercise regimen. But the truth is, it’s virtually impossible to keep that up for 10, 15 or 20 years without a proven plan.<br /><br />We’ll Show You The Healthy System For Losing 10 to 20 Pounds A Month With Just a Few Simple Tweaks to Your Diet and Daily Activities!<br /><br />You see, losing weight is difficult and you know that. You’ve probably spent a lot of time, money and effort using techniques that are out of date and completely ineffective. Have you tried any of these “weight loss solutions?&quot;<br /><br />Any luck with those? Of course not, they are expensive, ineffective and in some cases just scams. You may have lost some weight quickly, but then you hit a plateau and the weight came back just as quickly as it came off.<br /><br />And every time you try to lose weight in ineffective ways you are left with pain, anger, frustration, and other mentally draining and unhealthy negative effects.<br /><br />Believe us, we know. We tried it all and nothing worked. We wasted thousands of dollars on what we thought were weight loss solutions. But at the end of the day it’s not about money, it’s about how we feel about ourselves.<br /><br />It’s about how we feel when we put on a pair of jeans that fit a few short weeks ago but we can no longer get into.<br /><br />It’s about the confidence we have to strive in our lives, not just from a health perspective but a social, psychological and emotional well being that allows us to feel great, have a ton of energy and pursue dreams we never thought possible when we were overweight.<br /><br />Let’s be frank, being fat sucks. We would go to the beach and never, ever dream of taking off our shirt. We remember hearing people at restaurants discuss how “fat and gross” we were. And that did nothing in terms of motivation. In fact, it made us eat more and gain more weight.<br /><br />There was a period—a long one—when we didn’t have control over our lives. We could not control our eating habits. We fell into a routine of eating, feeling depressed about our situation, feeling sorry for ourselves, and finally blaming others.
