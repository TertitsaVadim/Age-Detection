<br /><br />“If you can't convince them, confuse them.”
<br /><br />“Sometimes I'm confused by what I think is really obvious. But what I think is really obvious obviously isn't obvious...”
<br /><br />“A perfection of means, and confusion of aims, seems to be our main problem.”
<br /><br />“The friend who can be silent with us in a moment of despair or confusion, who can stay with us in an hour of grief and bereavement, who can tolerate not knowing... not healing, not curing... that is a friend who cares.”
<br /><br />&quot;Four things to learn in life: To think clearly without hurry or confusion To love everybody sincerely; To act in everything with the highest motives; To trust God unhesitatingly.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;Confusion is a word we have invented for an order which is not understood.&quot;
<br /><br />Truth comes out of error more readily than out of confusion
<br /><br />&quot;Be not careless in deeds, nor confused in words, nor rambling in thought.&quot;

<br />to laugh and cry with,
<br />An inspiration,
<br />Someone who lends a helping hand,
<br />though friends may not be forever,
<br />And they may not end up together,
<br />the memories of a true friendship will
<br />last forever.
<br />A friend is not a shadow nor a servant
<br />But someone who hold
<br />a piece of a person in his heart.
<br />Someone who shares a smile,
<br />Someone who brightens up your day
<br />What makes a person a friend?
<br />Is by saying your Love will stay.
<br /><br />friendship is not just the name of an
<br />ordinary feeling.but it is the name of the feelings of 
<br />understanding,honesty and frankness between two persons.and these 
<br />feelings keep the two very special persons bounded together and such a 
<br />frienship lies in two of us.

<br />are like sand held in your hand
<br />. 
<br />Held loosely, with an open hand,
<br />the sand remains where it is.
<br /><br />The minute you close your hand 
<br />and squeeze tightly to hold on, 
<br />the sand trickles through your fingers.
<br /><br />You may hold onto some of it, 
<br />but most will be spilled.
<br /><br />A relationship is like that. 
<br />Held loosely, 
<br />with respect and freedom 
<br />for the other person, 
<br />it is likely to remain intact.
<br /><br />But hold too tightly, 
<br />too possessively, 
<br />and 
<br />the relationship slips away 
<br />and 
<br />is lost.”

<br /><br />For everything there is a season,
<br />And a time for every matter under heaven:
<br />A time to be born, and a time to die;
<br />A time to plant, and a time to pluck up what is planted;
<br />A time to kill, and a time to heal;
<br />A time to break down, and a time to build up;
<br />A time to weep, and a time to laugh;
<br />A time to mourn, and a time to dance;
<br />A time to throw away stones, and a time to gather stones together;
<br />A time to embrace, And a time to refrain from embracing;
<br />A time to seek, and a time to lose;
<br />A time to keep, and a time to throw away;
<br />A time to tear, and a time to sew;
<br />A time to keep silence, and a time to speak;
<br />A time to love, and a time to hate,
<br />A time for war, and a time for peace.
<br /><br />Peace has to be created, in order to be maintained. It is the product of Faith, Strength, Energy, Will, Sympathy, Justice, Imagination, and the triumph of principle. It will never be achieved by passivity and quietism.
<br /><br />Peace is not the absence of conflict but the presence of creative alternatives for responding to conflict -- alternatives to passive or aggressive responses, alternatives to violence.

<br /><br />Your life right now is a reflection of your past thoughts. 
<br />That includes all the great things, 
<br />and all the things you consider not so great. 
<br />Since you attract to you what you think about most, 
<br />it is easy to see what your dominant thoughts 
<br />have been on every subject of your life, 
<br />because that is what you have experienced.
<br /><br />The reason visualization is so powerful is because 
<br />as you create pictures in your mind of 
<br />seeing yourself with what it is you want, 
<br />you are generating thoughts and feelings of having it now. 
<br />Visualization is simply powerfully focused thought in pictures, 
<br />and it causes equally powerful feelings.
<br /><br />Can you think 'outside of the box'?
<br />It means leaving behind frustration, anger, stress, and fear.
<br /> Can you be creative?
<br />Can you manifest in a reality of infinite possibilities?

<br />who can stay with us 
<br />in an hour of grief and bereavement, 
<br />who can tolerate not knowing, 
<br />not curing, 
<br />not healing 
<br />and 
<br />face with us the reality of our powerlessness, 
<br />that is a friend who cares.
