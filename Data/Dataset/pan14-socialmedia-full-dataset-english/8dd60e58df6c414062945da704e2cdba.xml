<br />Well for those who are in school/college/university you guys know what i'm talking about... school is rough. Like seriously.. and I thought high school was hard?!? High school was a piece of frigging CAKE compared to college... geez. 
<br /><br />I swear... sometimes I just feel like quitting. I know I won't, because I can't. I mean, it's not that I hate it, because I love my course but... it's SUPER hard, and very stressful. I mean... you miss ONE day, and then you're screwed. Seriously... and with all the frigging money it costs... I can't quit now. Even though I really feel like it sometimes but... thank god I have my boyfriend and my friends to push me to go further... because I know myself too well to know I probably wouldn't stay. I'm just like that... I don't know.
<br /><br />But anyway... to a less depressing subjet... lol. Tonight is my Christmas dance for the school, and I can't wait! <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/biggrin.gif" alt=":)" />  All my friends from class are finally going to meet my boyfriend, and it's going to be so much fun!! <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/biggrin.gif" alt=":)" />  Can't wait! Planning on drinking a bit before going too. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" />   Not too much though... because I already feel like shit as it is... stupid sinuses!! <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/dry.gif" alt=":)" />  Grrr.
<br /><br />Well anyways, i'm in school right now so.. I should probably go...

<br /><br />Well, I can't wait till this frigging week is over okay.. holy crap! *sigh*
<br /><br />We have 3 tests this week, and I feel like i'm about to pull my hair out. Thank frigging god that we don't have school on friday... geez. But hey... after this week it's Christmas break till january 8th!! YAY!! <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/biggrin.gif" alt=":)" />  Are you guys getting a Christmas break? If so, when?
<br /><br />My boyfriend is pretty cranky lately, and of course he always gets on my back.. *rolls eyes*  I know he's tired, and that night shifts are killing him, but still. These past couple days hasn't been exactly the greatest, but I know it must be hard on him... and I know I can be pretty cranky do, and I do the same thing to him so... I guess I can't talk, right?
<br /><br />He's supposed to start day shifts VERY soon, I can't wait!! <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/biggrin.gif" alt=":)" />  In like 9 days, I think... and before he starts his new schedule, he gets 4 days off (or something like that) so... that's going to be really awesome! 4 days to spend doing whatever we want, not having to worry about the time... aahh man... seriously can't wait! And I know he cannot wait either. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" />   Aww, I love him sooo much!!! <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/inlove.gif" alt=":)" />   Even when he gets cranky with me. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/tongue.gif" alt=":)" /> 
<br /><br />I can't believe that Christmas is this weekend... it's so weird... doesn't feel like Christmas at all. We don't have any snow, and it feels really weird. And we probably won't have any for Christmas either... *sigh*  My very first Christmas without snow.... so sad. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/sad.gif" alt=":)" /> 
<br />What's the weather where you live??
<br /><br />Well anyway.. i'm in school so... I gotta go!
<br />take care 
<br />&amp;have a merry christmas everyone if I don't come back on here before then!!

<br />I don't even know what i'm still doing here but... yeah. lol.
<br />So, back to school since yesterday... *sigh*  I didn't really wanted to come back, but hey... do I really have a choice? Not really. It's not that school is so bad, it's just that the exams are coming soon and i'm super stressed out... and I just can't wait to finally have a job... SO tired of being broke all the time!!
<br />But except that not much is going on... my vacation were alright... could of been more exciting, but I spent most of my time with my baby, so that's all I care about. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/wub.gif" alt=":)" /> 
<br />Talking about him... he's sick. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/sad.gif" alt=":)" />  He has strept throat... had a fever of 100-102 since friday night.. poor baby! I think he feels better though.. I hope. I'm going to go see him after school! <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/biggrin.gif" alt=":)" />  Haven't seen him in 2 days!! I miss him soooo much! <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cry.gif" alt=":)" /> 
<br /><br />Well anyway, I have to go... lunch break is over.

<br /><br />So I never ended up seeing Phil yesterday... *sigh*  I was PRETTY disapointed about that... but it's alright.
<br /><br />We never been this long without seeing each other (3 days), and I hate it... I miss him SO much!! <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/sad.gif" alt=":)" /> 
<br /><br />Maybe for some people 3 days isn't a big deal, but for me it is. I'm not used to not seeing him... and this sucks.
<br /><br />I'm going to see him today though.. no matter what!
<br /><br />It's just that he's been sick since friday night with high fever and everything (strept throat), and yesterday he said I could come over, but had to cancel our plans, because he started being sick so.. yeah... *sigh*
<br /><br />I hope I see him today...

<br /><br />We're doing a project in class right now, and I chose abortion for mine. I'm pro-choice.
<br /><br />We have to give our opinions on the topic, and support it with facts (from a website or others).
<br /><br />So what do you think about abortion?? Pro-choice, pro-life? Let me know what you think!
<br /><br />P.S. If you know any good websites with good arguments, please let me know!
<br />thanks! <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" />

<br /><br />I don't really know why I still come on this site, but I guess i'm just that bored, and it's pretty much the only site that I can talk to my friends that the school hasn't block so... yeah. lol.
<br /><br />Things were a little rough for a little while, with my boyfriend, with school and friends, but things are slowly getting better, and i'm happy about that. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />I'm actually doing pretty well in school now! I'm glad... might end up having honors in all my classes in the end. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" /> I hope so!! I know my dad would be really proud... <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />One of my friend gave me the idea of making a scraptbook with pictures, drawings, journal entries and personal stuff like that for my boyfriend. I mean, I kinda thought about it before, but I didn't really knew what to put in it, but she gave me some great ideas... so I can't wait to start that now! I'm going to go to Walmart and buy a scraptbook soon, so I can start it. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />I started a part time job at Super Store, and it's alright... a little boring, we always do the same stuff, but hey... it's better than being on cash! And anyway, I only have (hopefully) like 2 months left there (maybe not even) so... it's not so bad... I can't wait till' I have a real job though!! *sigh*
<br /><br />Well anyway, i'm kinda in class right now... so I should probably go. lol.
