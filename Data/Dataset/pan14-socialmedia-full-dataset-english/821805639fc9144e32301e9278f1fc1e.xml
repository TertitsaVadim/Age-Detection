The Palms hotel is not on the strip but that makes for a better perspective of the view of the nocturnal hours lights. I highly recommend becoming reservations at as in close proximity to twilight as possible and enjoy the sun going down and the lights turning on facing your eyes. To better view the following nightly spectacular light show created by nature and man, Alize has huge two-story windows that offer a unique panoramic view of Las vegas. <br /><br />The ambiance of Alize is a plus also with elegant settings, furniture, art and many other decor. The restaurant is known for it's large wines selection with over 1, 700 varieties available. You can see most of the bottles on display inside dinning room wine &quot;cellar&quot;. If you're a wine connoisseur you certainly will appreciate Aliza even much more. <br /><br />We have been especially hungry so we decided to get three appetizers: 1. Arrangement of Baby Greens, Caraway Cracker, Goat Parmesan cheese and Balsamic Vinaigrette : Simple but delicious. I ate the majority of it since I enjoy baby greens. 2. Braised Veal Cheek, Truffled Spud Mousseline, Veal Jus - This was the best of this appetizers and highly recommended if you like veal. 3. Classical Escargots de Bourgogne. Good, but not exceptional. <br /><br />For any entrees we got: 1. This Wasabi &amp; Sesame Crusted Rack of Lamb, Tagine Greens, Dried Apricots, Dates Lamb Jus. Cooked perfectly. The apricots and times complimented the meat in a unique way. The dinner left me satisfied. two. The Roasted Venison Loin using Sweet &amp; Sour Cabbage, Mad Mushroom Herb Spaetzle and Poivrade Sauce. I only had one bite of this as I was focusing on the rack of lamb but was sufficiently impressed as was my dinning partner. <br /><br />We were tempted to get desert but were feeling pretty full now. However the desert menu had about six or even seven delicious sounding options. <br /><br />The company at Alize was exceptional to say the least: very fast and attentive. <br /><br />The only part of our experience that might be considered a negative were the prices. Alize is not inexpensive. However, for the over-all dinning experience, especially like the great view and mood, it is worth the money in my view. If the prices seem too high for your pocketbook, there are occasional discounts and coupons available like during the popular Cafe Week in Vegas where proceeds search for a local charity. <br />.<br />Las Vegas has long been renowned as the entertainment capital of the country. Home to some of the biggest casinos in the world, people go to there to savor themselves. No one visits Las Vegas without having a good time.
