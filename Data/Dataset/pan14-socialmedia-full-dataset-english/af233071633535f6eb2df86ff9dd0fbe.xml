Go!! Coolest parker pens Are Launched It also refers to popular and mature information carriers existed, such as SMS messaging service. Another common explanation of SNS: Social Network Site, ie the &quot;social Web&quot; or &quot;social net.&quot;Natalie Portman is Found in Yearning parker fountain pens 
<br /><br />When ordinary people can have computing and communications resources which may compare to the web server by installing the SNS software, what will those Internet companies investing in a large number of servers do? What are their advantages? Will there be more new Internet companies, whose front end and background might not be present Google, EBAY or Sina model? Even the 3 million strong server clusters of which the operator like Shanda games is proud is the core competitiveness? When the machine in a cartoon's home can play his work through the SNS video device, does he need to go to manage a website? Probably a housewife does not know Html programming, doed not know the word site, but she can only use the SNS cookbook publishing program and a PC in the kitchen to help millions of people master her craft, and her stances on the stove is quite clear. What are you thinking at that time? In today's Internet now, we as the clients are like a dummy, do some slavery things only through the server, look at other people's sites, play other people's games, send emails, in addition to these, we have no freedom.The Incorrect Ideas of ugg boots You Should Know
<br /><br />Now is the time to start a revolution! Central task of the revolution: how to let more than 10 million computers play their own roles, let users create and control their own information, without the company's servers manipulating us. Individual power is weak, the birth of the Internet makes syntaxis of individuals' and strange forces in a short time possible, while SNS makes the possibility become a reality. The ultimate significance of SNS is to integrate the scattered individuals in the Internet orderly and organicly, just like the silk thread strung pearls. The key is to make the pearls find the pearls and the fish balls find the fish balls. If an SNS always let the fishball fall into the pearl base, or vice versa, it is definitely a disaster.
<br /><br />To let the same type of individuals associate perfectly is the core application of SNS. Now almost all of the SNS take the webgame as the core applications for getting users together, which is obviously a departure from the basic value of SNS. SNS takes human relations as a basis. The user inevitably have the behaviour characteristics of participation, communication and sharing. This kind of behaviour spends a lot of time. Therefore, the core applications of SNS should invovle two basic characteristics of simple operation and high frequency property of participation. Internet application which now can meet the two characteristics is only the microblog.
<br /><br />Living the life from the days into the scripts is the inevitable result of the information age and the rapid urbanization, which is also the reason why microblog is highly regarded. Significance of microblog for the individual is not confiding but listening. Individuals will be more concerned about the content published by the objects followed, and associate by responses. This series of acts like release, attention, following, recovery, re-release form a virtuous communication cycle. Each man and followed object form a small circle, a number of which link together to form a SNS Network. Microblog makes SNS more valuable. Microblog can not be said to be the only core application of SNS, but the success of microblog definitely can promote the success of SNS, which is of course only the success on applications. From the time used, the mobile terminal has more potential than a computer to become the main platform of SNS. The successful commercial application must tie the other twin brother SMS. Microblog and text message are born to make a pair. Break down the boundaries between the two means not only to create a new network application, but to create a new business model. The key is how to merge the interests of the enterprise, microblog and the user into a harmonious business system.

Why the Most Expensive bridal dresses Around The World are So Queer?

Let's Have a Look at the Most Expensive mbt shoes During Winter Vacation&quot; They believe in God of the sun god, moon, mountain, water god, Lake God, Poseidon, a monkey god, Divine and so on. God's influence is everywhere in the daily lives of people in Bali and they believe that God exists in every corner.
<br /><br />Bali is more like a space in another era, or a world which is anachronistic. Both of the native artlessness and religiosity and the extraneous fashion and civilization, and the oriental leisureliness and gentleness and the western ebullience and vehemence have emerged in Bali. The endless Indian Ocean is so calm that some people confused. Some slight white spray slapping gently the rocks near the foot of the mountain. The sea is too blue and it just like the most beautiful picture you have ever seen, besides and the sky is lucency and some white clouds occasionally flutter and parked there for several hours without moving.
<br /><br />Go to Kura beach, although it is not likely to go surfing, still well viewing scenery is worth to see. Many young people are directed at Kura`s white horses and fly to change a car with a surfboard to come here.

So the monks in the temple took off their waistbands and threw them into the sea, and then the belts became two sea snakes which had finally dominated the stormy waves. So the sea snakes had become the eudemons of the temple.
<br /><br />For tourists, the temple`s location is the most special. It is a narrow coastal rocks stretching into the Indian ocean which the temple is built on. During high tide, the surrounding of the rock by the water isolate the whole temple and make it an offshore land, standing alone in the deep blue sea. When the tide falls, the rock comes out the coastal platform, connecting the lands, thus people can walk directly from the shoreside to the Tanah Lot.
<br /><br />Pura Tirta Empul is one of the six famous temples in Bali, which has over-thousand history till now. It is said that in the distant past, evil wizard poisoned the water to taint country people. God Indra used a spear to prong the ground and the jetted water saved all people. This is the holy spring of origin. Quan Temple building large-scale integrated, from here you can see all the features of the temple of Bali and the Bali unique religious culture.

The big fellow is called [Stygiomedusa gigantea&quot; as its scientific name, with a disk-like shield. It is as wide as over 1 meter and has 4 tentacles, the longest of which is 6 meters long.Lately Beyoncé Knowles was Criticized for Wearing ugg boots 
<br /><br />The researchers expressed that such deep-sea giant jelly only had been found 114 times in 110 years. Recession Chic â€[ How to Be Fabbest on a Budget Serpent is a joint project of marine scientist and including BP, Shell, Chevron and Petrobras these energy companies. Why Shop bridal dresses for Firefighters When carrying out [Serpent&quot; program in the Gulf of Mexico, Mark Benfield, professor with Louisiana State University, hit into this huge jellyfish accidentally. With the help of the remote-controlled submersible from Oil and Gas Company, the scientists can carry out more detailed deep-sea exploration, whose area includes the middle and deep layers of the ocean. In a similar research recently, the researchers photographed sea serpent which looked like a snake. Sea serpent is one of the largest marine fishes.
<br /><br />The scientists have known few of Stygiomedusa gigantean. According to their speculation, this giant jellyfish was the biggest invertebrate predator in the ecosystem of the sea. The direct observation under the sea with this jellyfish was very rare. Before it, the scientist had photographed this giant monster in the Pacific coast of America. Besides, the remote-controlled submersible also captured them in the coast of Japan, but it is the first photo of Stygiomedusa gigantea in history in the Gulf of Mexico. The researchers claimed in their report that they once met with this kind of huge jellyfish for four times from 2005 to 2009. During that time, the resource company were doing regular check to its equipments under the sea. The video showed that the activity area of this red purple giant jellyfish was under the water from 996 meters to 1747 meters. According to the inspection of the scientist, the jellyfish was using its large flat tentacles attached to the equipment under the sea. Paddle like tentacle doesn't have thorn like cirrus, scientists still don't know their particular function. Tentacle may be use to round their preys, and it explained why jellyfish can cling on man-made structure.
<br /><br />Another video made by the researchers shows that a fish was swimming within or near the protective area of the jellyfish. This fish is known as the bleeny which lives in the deep sea area, it is a rare fish and has formed a symbiotic relationship with jellyfish. This kind of fish can get protection while enjoying the food scran by moving inside the guard of the jellyfish. Before this, scientist never find Stygiomedusa gigantea or ocean extreme deep blenny in Mexico bay. Based on past research and record related with such a kind of giant jelly, the scientists confirmed that the animals are widely distributed and everywhere left their figures except the Arctic Ocean.
<br /><br />The research conducted by the American scientists is the first attempt to assess Stygiomedusa gigantean's distribution around the globe. Benfield and his research group hope that they can have more close contacts with this enormous acalephe in the future. help them further understand these giant fellows and some other animals which share the sea with them. The research findings have been published on [The Journal of Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom.

Hey Mom! How Can You Resist the Glamour of Precious parker pens Hubble Space Telescope Cosmic Origins Spectrometer (COS) and other three observation suggested it's from a large stellar group for 375 light years diatance. Now this homeless runaway star is staying at the edge of [30 Dourados Nephelium&quot;, which is the noisy breeding place of fix stars in close to the Large Magellanic Cloud. This research has proved that many supermassive fix stars exist in the [30 Dourados Nephelium&quot;, which serves as the best unique laboratory for studying overweight fix stars. [Thirty Dourados Nebula&quot; is also called the [Tarantula Nebula&quot;, which is approximately 17 000 light years from earth. In its central area perches the R136 star cluster which comprises several stars that are more than a hundred times bigger than sun in terms of mass. This observation will help to gain insight in how the supermassive star cluster operates.Jessica Simpson Bring You to Pair With Most Superior parker pens 
<br /><br />Nolan Walborn from the Baltimore Space Telescope Institute remarked, [What`s fascinating about this research is that the once theoretically predicted the dynamic variation of the extremely dense, super-massive star clusters can be observed visually for the first time in space&quot;. What Christian Siriano Wearing? ! For the past half century very few supermassive runaway stars had been detected to exist in the comparatively small Orion nebula, this is recently the first time to attest the existence of runaway star in supermassive, young star luster&quot; It formated with its own &quot;companion&quot;, a fast one in the supermassive dense group of stars maight still existed one or two same heavier companion, it escaped in an alarming rate, was ejected in the binary system of stars in the pinball game or deported by another one more mass star in the system of supernova explosions. The study team member Danny Lennon of Hubble Space Telescope Cosmic Origins Spectrometer (COS) said &quot;R136 is a very young stellar group. It is impossible for the inner super massive stellar within the form of supernova to have an explosion, suggesting that this observed runaway star is definitely expulsed under the dynamic interaction of the large mass stellar.&quot;
<br /><br />It`s said that this runaway star research team is led by Chris Evans from the Astronomic observatory of Edinburg, Britain. The research paper was published in the May 10th issue of the Astrophysical Journal Letters Since from 2006, the research team which was leaded by the astronomer Lan Howarth in the British London University had ever conducted the observation. They found that the runaway star was not match with another super massive hot blue and white stellar. They were often far away from any star group When astronomers use this fix star as a rectifying objective of COS, they unexpectedly found another important clue ---- they found that this capricious fix star released intense charged particle as one of the strongest stellar winds up to now. In addition, clear indication suggested that the quantity of this supermassive fix star may be 90 times heavier than that of sun. Therefore it should be a very young star which has been there for about 1 to 2 million years - supermassive stars could only live for several million years. Through sifting the picture files of the Hubble telescope astronomers found another vital clue.
<br /><br />The optical imagery of this star taken by No.2 Wide Field and Planetary Camera in 1995 revealed an eggshell-like cosmic void at the end of the star; the glistening verge of the void extends to the behind of the star and pointed to the direction of the Thirty Dourados Nebula. The another spectroscope study of the European Southern Observatory Very Large Telescope (VLT) showed that the speed of the stellar remained constant, which was not the result of the binary star system orbit. Its speed was completely inconsistent with the movement around the stellar. The clear evidence showed that it was an runaway star. This study additionally affirmed that the observed runaway ray came from a single supermassive star rather than a combination of two less weighty stars. Moreover, the observance identified that this runaway star was 10 times hotter than the sun and it`s temperature tallying with have star body.
<br /><br />Very Large Telescope observations of a VLT-FLAMES survey tarantula was part of the plan, the observation study was led by Evans, who from international research team, and their observations have covered 30 Dora Dusi Yun nebula, which had more than 900 stars in. This runaway star was not possible the only runaway star of the universe region. The observation had found two super hot massive stellar in the edge of Dora Dusi Cloud nebula. Astronomers deduced these two stars were also expelled; they`d planed to specifically analyze them in order to ascertain whether the Thirty Dourados Nebula had released massive runaway stars to its vicinity. Paul Crowther, a member of the research team pointed out that this capricious runaway star may continue to live a homeless life and finally end its life in the form of supernova explosion, formulating a black hole with the final wreckage.

However, what you might not expect is how numbers change our world decisively. A number can determine our sense of beauty and the friends we have. Numbers have emerged into our genes and here are just some examples of how numbers change our way of living.Well!! Most Adaptive parker pens Are Available
<br /><br />Dunbar Number: Some communities are basically unchanged for a long time, while other communities, and even modern blocks will become chaotic and collapse. Blanchetteâ€™s Reason for mbt shoes When we keep in touch with some of our friends and colleagues, we completely ignore the rest, which is clearly unreasonable. Some Details to Protect Your parker pens There also seems to be management problem when company employes number of employees. There seems no relation among these things, but they are all related with a number. It is claimed by the researcher, the human society is accentuated with 150. Scientist studying primates hold that the bigger a monkey's cerebral cortex is, the bigger the community may grow. After studying 38 groups of monkeys, professor Dunbar estimated that the approximation of human community is 150 This means that we can handle about 150 kinds of social relations. In any case, when we have to deal with more than 150 people relations, we tend to become increasingly inefficient.
<br /><br />Take an example, if you plan to have a party of 150, you can easily remember the names of them and who they like or dislike to sit beside. If you are planing a party for 300 or 500 people, you may forget many names or their seats. There are some other examples to prove that if the population of any society is more than 150, the care for each other disappeared. For instance, if there are more than 150 residents, crime rate will be a serious problem. In the history of whole human, 150 is up to full strength for the arm, which seems to be easier to control. Any company with less than 150 will have more productivity than company with large office.
<br /><br />Golden ratio: this figure is the most widely used in the universe. The human being not only use it in fashion, furniture, art, music and even economics, this number even occurs in the human body, nature, and even related to the formation of the Milky Way. Golden ratio was first discovered by Greeks to be found everywhere in nature. It was so great of having discovered its existence. There are many books explaining how golden ratio works and the reason why beauty is a precise science. Our face and healthy body are consistent with the golden ratio. This figure comes from a spiral, and the length of each spiral is just 1.618 times. This constant number, for some reason becomes a general rule which direct everything from the bone structure to the growth of vines.
<br /><br />Secret of success: According to latest research, genius isn't born with the tallent. Malcolm Gladwell believes that a successful person is made by practice including Bill Gates to the Beatles. Interestingly, we can know that any person goes into one thing and masters its number of hours. Scientists say that after 10,000 hours, anyone can become an expert in any field. Beatles band, which enjoys high reputation, spent many year even longer time in German club, played 12 hours everyday. The manager and Beatles admitted the tense training will help them to form their own style. If they hadn't practiced for 10,000 hours, maybe the Beatles would not succeed for ever. Bill Gates also passed over many years in the computer lab few men could privately access to. This was a fortunate coincidence, but this made him accumulated about 10,000 hours of computer experience earlier than his peers. The same story happened to Steve Jobs, who also had the oppotunity to use computer. The conclusion is simple, that is, if you want to succeed, 10,000 hours is neccessary.
<br /><br />4.7: well-known psychologist George Miller proved with a lot of articles that, only seven objects of our short-term or working memory can be retained before it begins to ignore new messages or forget the old knowledge. In other words, if someone told you 10 names and let you write them down, you can only remember 7. More interesting is that studies show that the number of long-term memory is also affected by number 7. When new information is repeated 7 times, we will eaily remeber it for longer time. Marketing Personnel even thinks if the product price ends with 7 will sell better. It seems that 2.97 dollars is more attractive than 1.99 dollars for some reason.
