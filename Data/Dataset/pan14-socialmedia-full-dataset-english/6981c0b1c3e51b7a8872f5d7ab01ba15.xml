Practicing using previous years’ CBSE papers not only acquaints students with the overall examination pattern but also helps them assess their current levels of preparation.
<br /><br /><em>In view of the benefits of using previous years’ CBSE papers for revision, students should keep in mind the following steps for using the previous years’ CBSE papers effectively:</em>
<br /><br />--&gt; The first and foremost step is to finish all conceptual understanding. Before starting to practice from the previous years’ CBSE papers, students should have all their study material and revision notes in place. Students should only plan to practice from these previous years’ CBSE papers once they are confident about their preparation and they think they are cent percent ready to write the final CBSE papers.
<br /><br />--&gt; While organizing the previous years’ CBSE papers, students should also simultaneously look out for their respective solution sheets along with the official marking scheme.  At this stage creating a pool of such solution sheets is important. However, students should restrain themselves from reading the solutions at this stage.
<br /><br />--&gt; Before starting to practice from the previous years’ <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2Nic2UubWVyaXRuYXRpb24uY29t" target="_blank">CBSE Solved question papers</a>, students should aim to create a simulated exam atmosphere around them. Choosing a study corner that is free of any disturbance and well-lit. Students can also choose to ask their parents and friends not to disturb them while writing an ‘exam’. Students should also keep a stop-watch handy, so as to keep a track of the time left to complete the mock CBSE paper.
<br /><br />--&gt; With all the required things in place, students can now start attempting their <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5tZXJpdG5hdGlvbi5jb20_" target="_blank">CBSE question papers</a>. Students should make sure that once they start writing their mock CBSE paper, they should resist any temptation to look into the solution sheet. Students should focus on completing their mock CBSE papers in time and write quality answers that can fetch them a good score.
<br /><br />--&gt; Once students are through with their mock CBSE papers, it is time to evaluate their performance and calculate their score. With the help of the solution sheet and the official marking scheme students can appropriately rate their performance. While evaluating the answer sheet, students should try to act as a strict examiner and not reward marks generously. Doing so will help them raise their own standards of performance.
<br /><br />--&gt; Once through with checking the CBSE question papers, students can highlight or identify all the topics or areas where they performed poorly. Students should then get back to their <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5tZXJpdG5hdGlvbi5jb20_" target="_blank">CBSE study material</a> and revise those particular topics to strengthen their conceptual base.
<br /><br />After a few days, students should once again go back to those questions and revise them all over again. They should also ensure that they are cent percent accurate this time around.
<br />Now that all you students out there know how to use previous years’ CBSE papers, scoring good marks will not be that difficult.

Many often consider CBSE model papers a sure-shot way to excel in examinations. CBSE model papers are usually a loose prototype of the final CBSE question paper that gives students a first-hand look of their final examination paper. Regular practice from CBSE model papers not only helps students to identify their weak areas in various subjects and but also instills in them the much required confidence to combat exam-related stress. Keeping in mind the benefits of practicing from CBSE model papers, students should make it a point to include such practice sessions using model papers in their revision schedules. However, it is also very important for students to know how and when to seek help from these model papers.
<br /><br />---&gt; To start with, students should only start practicing from the CBSE model papers after they are through with understanding and memorizing all the important points in a particular subject. A preparation like this before attempting <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2Nic2UubWVyaXRuYXRpb24uY29t" target="_blank">CBSE model question paper</a> will help students truly assess their preparation levels for exams. It will also place them in a better position to take remedial action if required, to help score great marks in the final exams.
<br /><br />---&gt; At this stage students can also choose to take adaptive assessment tests that are geared to test their knowledge in a particular chapter along with related concepts. These adaptive assessment tests help students an instant identification of their weak concepts that may be stumbling blocks in the way of a thorough and effective understanding of a particular concept. There are a few websites that provide such formative assessments in Maths and Science for students studying under CBSE board.
<br /><br />---&gt; Once through with a particular chapter, students can tests their understanding by taking chapter-wise practice tests or CBSE model papers. There are a variety of websites that provide CBSE aligned chapter-wise MCQ and descriptive tests. These chapter-wise practice tests not only add variety to a student’s learning schedule but also ensure a thorough assessment of students at different levels. A rigorous practice using such tests will solidify students’ understanding of the topics in the subject.
<br /><br />---&gt; After taking the chapter-wise tests, now comes the time to revise using full length <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2Nic2UubWVyaXRuYXRpb24uY29t" target="_blank">CBSE model papers</a> or previous years’ question papers. A full-length test in simulated exam atmosphere enables students to gauge their preparation levels with respect to the answering style, time management strategies etc. The more a student practices, the better are his/her chances to perform well in exams. These e-learning websites not only provide CBSE model papers but also provide solved CBSE board papers to help students familiarize themselves with the correct answering style and the official marking scheme.
<br /><br />Students who wish to score well in their final CBSE examinations should support such practice sessions with robust revision sessions using a host of other revision aids available to the students. Once through with all the revision, students must re-visit their CBSE model papers before the final CBSE examinations.
<br /><br /><strong>All the best!</strong>

Thousands of students each year sit for these competitive exams that just have a few hundred seats to offer. 
<br /><br />With increasing number of students aiming to crack these entrance exams each year, competition levels are soaring. In a situation like this how to keep stress levels under control and prepare well for these entrance exams and also be sure of the performance? After reading this article, questions like these will no longer trouble you. This article will help you arrive at ways that will make cracking the most difficult engineering entrance exam easy.
<br /><br />•&lt;b&gt;Plan for the academic years in advance!&lt;/b&gt; If you are in class XI, now is the right time to start planning and preparing for your engineering entrance exams. Students in class XI and XII should lay emphasis largely on three subjects i.e. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2Nic2UubWVyaXRuYXRpb24uY29t" target="_blank">CBSE Physics, Maths and Chemistry</a>. Thorough understanding of concepts in these subjects is imperative to help them emerge with flying colours. The engineering entrance examination papers are primarily geared to check the conceptual knowledge of students majorly in these subjects. Therefore, students are advised to start planning for their entrance exams while they are studying in class XI. However, if you have lost out on some precious time, there is no point getting stressed out. Start preparing for these entrance exams right away!
<br /><br />•&lt;b&gt;Get your basics clear!&lt;/b&gt; It is of utter importance for students preparing for these engineering entrance exams to have their knowledge of basics concepts and processes in <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5tZXJpdG5hdGlvbi5jb20_" target="_blank">CBSE Physics, Chemistry and Maths</a> crystal clear. The questions asked in these entrance exams are based on the concepts taught in CBSE Physics, Chemistry and Maths for classes XI and XII but of a higher difficulty level. Therefore, before starting to prepare for these engineering entrance exams students are advised to thoroughly go through their NCERT books for CBSE Physics, Chemistry and Maths. While preparing for the entrance exams students should practice hard the end-of-chapter questions in these NCERT books. Students can also choose to seek help from various websites that provide free NCERT solutions for CBSE Physics, CBSE Chemistry and CBSE Maths.
<br /><br />•&lt;b&gt;Pass your CBSE board exams with more than 60% marks!&lt;/b&gt; Some students may not know that majority of the engineering institutes in India have an eligibility criteria for admission. As per this eligibility criterion, students should have passed their CBSE board exams with more than 60% marks. A condition like this gives more reasons to students preparing for these entrance exams to take their NCERT books for CBSE Physics, Chemistry and Maths seriously. While preparing for the board exams, students should also practice from the previous years’ board papers for CBSE Physics, Chemistry and Maths. There are a few websites that provide previous years’ solved board papers, model tests and practice tests for these subjects to help students score well in their board exams.
<br /><br />•&lt;b&gt;Seek help from entrance exam aligned test papers!&lt;/b&gt; After preparing for your board exams, students should practice concepts from the model question papers and test series for entrance exams. This will help students get a hang of the type of questions that are usually asked in these engineering entrance exams from CBSE Physics, Chemistry and Maths.
<br /><br />Now that all you students know how to prepare for your engineering entrance exams, I am positive that cracking these exams won’t be difficult.
<br /><br />All the best!

<br /><br />In today’s fast, nerve-racking and competitive lifestyle, “Change” has become the order of the day.  So, to keep pace with the contemporary world, education in the 21st century has also attained a new form.
<br /><br />Education has now shifted from traditional learning to new-technology motivated e-Learning. Now, study has become web-oriented with the arrival of “Internet” in every home. With the advent of e-Learning, studies have become easier as one need not be present in classrooms physically for fixed hours.
<br /><br />e-Learning is the most popular alternative for home study support as it combines various fields like distance learning, online learning, technology-delivered instruction and web-based training. It is a digital learning experience that offers interactive online support in the form of online lectures, online forums and chat rooms; live virtual classes and online bulletin boards are highly attention-grabbing and learner-centric and very popular with students. 
<br /><br /><strong>Traditional Learning vs. e-Learning</strong>
<br />It is a well researched fact that learning through audio, video, graphics and animation is more effective than learning through unexciting, lengthy and mundane books.  Human mind is capable of retaining picture, audio and other sensory perceptions for a longer duration than words. Keeping in mind the above mentioned facts, e-Learning study modules are specially designed to deliver specific topics, lectures and techniques that are more interesting, easy to grab and retain. 
<br /><br />Traditional learning is gradually being replaced by web based learning or e-Learning. Some of the benefits of e-Learning over traditional learning are discussed below: 
<br /><br />Unlike traditional learning, e-Learning is not time bound. Students are free to attend the lectures whenever they want and wherever they want. They can enjoy learning as per their convenience and at their own pace. The mentors, tutors and parents can record the live lectures and pass it on to the students when required. 
<br /><br />e-Learning programs offer the facility of online discussions wherein the students can share their views, thoughts and opinions with each other. Through video-conferencing, the students can take advantage of the skill, talent, experience and knowledge of renowned experts and trainers. Further, students can revise the lessons and strengthen their weaker sections easily.
<br /><br />e-Learning provides customized courses to students to satisfy their interest.  It allows the students to choose their preferred courses and establish their own roadmaps. Now, students need not stick to the courses that are offered by board or university under the traditional learning systems. Traditional universities usually take a long time to replace old syllabi with new ones, but e-learning courses always comprise updated course material.
<br /><br />e-Learning reduces travelling and study expenses and provides quality education which is affordable and reliable. With the new form of digital learning, higher education is economical and easy like never before.
<br /><br />Team,

The program is already being implemented in several schools across Singapore, Oman, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia and Japan and is long due to be implemented in India as well.
<br /><br />The CBSE-i curriculum follows the international pattern and will do away with the need to opt for the International Baccalaureate (I<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cool.gif" alt=":)" /> Program or the <strong>International General Certificate of Secondary Education (IGCSE)</strong> for students aspiring to go abroad after completing their class XIIth in India. The curriculum incorporates subjects like visual arts, performing arts, research, life skills and physical education besides language, science and social science. Seems like CBSE, through this program, is also looking towards the all-round holistic development of the students and not just focusing on their academic progress.
<br /><br />CBSE-i has been a success internationally and now, with over 350 Indian schools having expressed their interest to join the program, students here should also be able to be a part of this program soon.
<br /><br />This is an important step taken by CBSE to promote world-class education in India. Incorporating the program in all the schools will be significant in bringing the Indian school curriculum at par with that followed worldwide.
<br /><br />Kudos to CBSE for this initiative!
<br /><br />Cheers!

<br /><br />A common national level test for admission to engineering courses across the country will be introduced from 2013. Under the new scheme, all aspirants will have to take two exams - JEE main and JEE advanced - to be held on the same day. The aspirant's scores in these 2 exams will determine whether he or she is eligible for admission to the Indian Institutes of Technology (IIT), NIITs or IIITs, or other state-funded institutions.
<br /><br />For admission to IITs, 50% weightage will be given to the class XIIth results, while for centrally funded institutions which include NIITs and IIITs, it will be 40%.
<br /><br />The new structure has met stiff opposition from students and the IIT faculty alike. What do you think? Should class XIIth marks be given weightage in the selection process for the engineering entrances?
<br /><br />On the other hand, a student wanting to take admission into an engineering college need no longer sit for three to five entrance tests, but just a single test will do. So for over 15 lakh students who sit for engineering entrance exams every year, can this be seen as welcome move?
