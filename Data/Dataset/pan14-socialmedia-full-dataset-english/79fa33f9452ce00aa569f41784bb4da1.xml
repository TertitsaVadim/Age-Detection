<br /><br />From ZDNet
<br /><br />After months of waiting since the official announcement last November, Google has finally picked a time to release the Chrome operating system: this fall.
<br /><br />According to AFP, Google execs have confirmed that the open-source Chrome OS will be available for free, although no month nor date during autumn has been specified.
<br /><br />It’s also yet to be known whether any new (or old, maybe) devices to be released at that time will be running on the Chrome OS. It could be an interesting selling tool for the holiday season, although it’s not clear cut how much this will challenge Microsoft Windows just yet.
<br /><br />Now I can see what is going to replace with Windows system on Google employees Desktop. Check this &quot;Google ditches Windows on security concerns&quot;
<br />Which mention that
<br /><br />New hires are now given the option of using Apple’s Mac computers or PCs running the Linux operating system. “Linux is open source and we feel good about it,” said one employee. “Microsoft we don’t feel so good about.”
<br /><br />More and more OS level development from Google will be great competition for Canonical, Microsoft &amp; Apple.
<br /><br />From slashdot.org
<br /><br />&quot;On Wednesday Google's vice president of product management said that this fall Google will launch Chrome OS to compete with Microsoft Windows. More than 70 million users already use the Chrome Browser, and Google expects at least 1 million users of the OS by day one of release.&quot;
