<br /><strong>The Amazing Immune System</strong>
<br />Our bodies naturally have an amazing ability to regenerate tissue if damaged and to combat illness of many sorts. Unfortunately, due to today's society and dietary trends, our <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">immune system</a></strong> tends not to work as efficiently as it can.
<br /><br />During <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">Qigong</a></strong> and <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">Taiji</a> </strong>practice, one of the requirements of training is that the tip of the tongue is placed gently to the roof of the mouth. There are many physical and metaphysical <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">benefits</a></strong> of doing so. The main one that I will focus on is the fact that by placing the tongue thus causes the saliva production to increase. Within saliva, there is an enzyme called &quot;amylase&quot; which is responsible for the first stages of digestion. This is one of the reasons why it is recommended to thoroughly chew food before swallowing it, as the amylase mixes with the food and begins the digestion process. A healthy <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">digestive system</a></strong> means a strong immune system.
<br /><br />Medisch Dossier (Volume 6, No. 7), a Dutch medical newsletter, reports on a study where a group of older men and women (average age of 70) practiced Taiji three days a week for 45 minutes. After fifteen weeks, they not only felt much more healthy, but had twice the number of immune cells (called T-cells) which are specially equipped to knock out the virus that causes shingles and also many other viruses.
<br /><br /><strong>Jim Plant</strong>
<br /><strong>Taiji Practitioner (Darwen Falls prevention classes)</strong>
<br />&quot;I began <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">Taiji</a></strong> under the tuition of Steven Burton about one year ago. I was prompted by the <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">Health and Fitness</a> </strong> development team of Blackburn with Darwen Borough Council to try Taiji as they believed that it would help improve my mobility and balance.
<br /><br />I have always been active and in my youth was a very sporty person. But, I have never come across a more concise series of exercises as Taiji. The exercises work both the physical external muscles and joints as well as working all the internal organs through the breathing techniques. All the movements are gentle and there is no stress to any joints. My health has improved so much. I find Taiji truly amazing!&quot;
<br /><br />Mild reminder,the list of benefits is seemingly endless but the most important thing is to enjoy your journey into the study of this fascinating art, <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">taiji</a></strong>.

<br />Traditional Chinese Medicine &amp; Taiji--Promoting Mental, Physical  and Spiritual Health
<br />By Professor Shulan Tang Founder of Shulan College of Chinese Medicine;</strong>  
<br />Academic Executive ofATCM UK; Fellow Member of Registrar of Chinese Herbal Medicine, UK; Member of the British Acupuncture Council, UK
<br /><strong>
<br />Introduction</strong>
<br />I have been practicing <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">Chinese medicine</a></strong>in England since 1991. The majority of my patients are Westerners, suffering mainly from depression, anxiety and low energy, especially during the long cold winters here. Along with <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">acupuncture</a></strong> and Chinese <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">herbal medicine</a></strong>, I believe Taiji is excellent for treating physical excesses as well as mental and emotional problems. For pure <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">relaxation</a></strong> it has no equal.
<br /><br />The close links between traditional Chinese medicine (<strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">TCM</a></strong>) and Taijiquan have long been familiar to the Chinese -- both are based on the core value of balance and harmony, and the belief that balance is essential for a long and healthy life, physically, mentally and emotionally. This balance can best be summed up by the <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">Yin-Yang</a></strong> concept.
<br /><br />The main foundation for TCM is that of universal energy, or Qi (pronounced as &quot;chee&quot;, which surrounds us and is necessary for all living things, whether plants, animals or humans. Qi is considered positive and negative, dynamic and static, passive and aggressive, Yin and Yang -- complementary opposing forces. In the human body, this energy circulates along channels known as meridians. There are points along these channels which can affect the flow of Qi, thus directly altering the body's essential balance and harmony. If certain blockages or imbalances occur, this can result in illness. TCM assumes that a balance between Yin and Yang is the key to health.
<br /><br />There are many ways to <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">influence</a></strong> the flow of Yin and Yang: TCM is one way, by prescribing herbs to treat certain excesses or deficiencies in the patients' constitution; acupuncture is another, involving the manipulation of certain points on the meridians to stimulate Qi flow; and Taiji can also act to attract and circulate Qi through the body in a steady way, rectifying any imbalances through gentle exercise. When your body is ready, more vigorous exercises will produce even greater benefits.
<br /><br />The medical classic, Yellow Emperor's Internal Canon of Medicine, produced over two thousand years ago, states clearly that the concept of Yin-Yang is at the heart of everything, including life and death, and this belief is the basis for <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">TCM treatment</a></strong> as well as Taiji forms of shadow boxing, pushing movements offset with pulling, left movements with right, forwards with backwards.

<br /><strong>What Makes Taiji Special?</strong>
<br />There are four main <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">features</a></strong> of Taiji: it is gentle and relaxing, a non-impact activity suitable for all ages and nearly all conditions of <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">health</a></strong>; it is fluid and uniform in movement -- there are no sudden stops and starts as in many sports; it is circular and cyclical, the forms bringing you through a series of smooth movements to finish back where you started; and it is integrated and complete, gently working the whole body, exercising the mind and powers of concentration and breathing techniques, while working on the inner organs at the same time.
<br /><br />It is the most popular type of exercise that uniquely combines breathing, mind, body movements and consciousness all together. Without these qualities, it is just like any other exercise. The training methods will generate large amounts of natural Qi energy without external manipulation, i.e., <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">acupuncture</a></strong> or <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">traditional Chinese herbs</a></strong>. Therefore, it compliments acupuncture and herbs, and sustains and maintains health for the long term. After Taiji has helped improve health, it could lead to fighting fit health if you are dedicated enough.

<br />One of the main reasons that <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">Taiji</a></strong> is so widely practiced in China is that it promotes a long and <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">healthy life</a></strong>. The Taoists practiced a form of Taiji in their quest for eternal youth, and the doctor Sun Simiao, known throughout the Chinese world as the Medicine King, lived to the ripe old age of 100, conscientiously carrying out the forms. He recommended it as an excellent way of maintaining good health, urging his patients to learn perseverance and patience from the steady progress they made with Taiji.
<br /><br /><strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">Taiji</a></strong> is also a safe and practical sport. There is no risk of acute cardiac problems   when practicing, and it is an excellent all-round healthy activity. Because of its balanced yet cyclical nature, there are no sudden movements or jolts to shock weak joints or muscles, the movement is gentle and constant, with no stops or starts. Breathing is kept slow and regular throughout the form, instead of forcing participants to gasp for breath or stop for a rest. It is extremely practical in that no special equipment or dedicated space is required – comfortable loose clothing is all you need, and a little time regularly. You can keep up <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">Taiji</a></strong> even when you are away from home.
<br /><br />This activity can also improve general coordination, flexibility and mobility. This is especially true for older people. Regular Taiji sessions will strengthen the leg and back muscles reducing the likelihood of falls and injuries, giving more independence. Arthritis can be eased with regular practice, as Taiji can help strengthen the muscles around the affected joints, encouraging flexibility and enlarging the range of movements in a gentle, painless way. Taiji is suitable for all ages, irrespective of gender, physical condition or strength and ability. Like Yoga, those practicing Taiji go at their own pace without forcing any movements, each level providing room for improvement.
<br /><br />Taiji is fun and can be practiced alone or in a group, to soft music or in silence, indoors or out. The importance of enjoyable activity cannot be overstressed -- relaxation and enjoyment are as important in life as work and study. The trick is to get the balance right -- too much work makes Jack a dull boy! Even we in the west know that a healthy body means a healthy mind, and that happiness plays a major role in our health. And when it is practiced in a group, all the advantages of socialization and personal interaction are at play and the activity becomes something to look forward to. So Taiji can simply be practiced for fun, too, and to meet people.
<br /><br />Finally, Taiji can provide positive treatment for many serious <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">illnesses</a></strong>. According to the WHO, the main killers of our society are now cancer, heart diseases, brain diseases and diabetes. Taiji and <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20v" target="_blank">TCM</a> </strong>can be beneficial in the treatment of all of these.
<br /><br />In TCM, cancer is believed to be caused by a deficiency of some kind, and tonic herbs such as Ginseng and Lingzhi (ganoderma mushroom) are usually prescribed. In Taiji, cancer is thought of as grains of sand in the muscles, and the gentle, smooth movements can help to ease them slowly out of the system.
<br /><br />The cardiovascular system can benefit greatly from the practice of Taiji, as this activity promotes overall circulation of blood. The leg muscles are worked extensively, thereby reducing the risk of blood clots or other problems affecting the extremities, and the overall benefit is that blood and oxygen are directed more regularly to the brain. In TCM, brain and heart problems are often treated with Danshen,  in tea, powder or tablet form.
<br /><br />Diseases of the blood can be slowed down with certain teas: Jiangzhi tea for reducing cholesterol, Jiangtang tea for lowering blood sugar levels, and Jiangya for blood pressure. Regular Taiji sessions have been proven highly effective for improving the heart rate, especially for normally sedentary elderly people, and for reducing blood pressure by decreasing stress. The immune system can also be improved with Taiji.
<br /><br />As with <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20v" target="_blank">TCM</a></strong>, Taiji works the body and mind as a whole, seeking to rebalance Yin and Yang. Where TCM treats with herbs, massage and acupuncture, Taiji work with movement. Both offer genuine health benefits.

<br /><strong>Taiji as Meditation</strong>  
<br /><strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">Taiji</a></strong> should be thought of as a form of dynamic meditation. Most people think meditation is a practice that involves sitting down with your legs crossed; but <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">meditation</a></strong> should not be confined to just this single activity.
<br /><br />The intricate nature of the <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">Taiji</a></strong> routines require the complete co-ordination of mind, body and breath with every action. Through regular repetition, these actions become ingrained in the body to allow the mind to focus clearly on their intention and application. Once relaxation and intention are combined, distractive thoughts are removed, internal energy is awakened and a state of meditation is created.
<br /><br /><strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">Taiji</a></strong> exercises not only teach you to focus the mind but also to create a strong posture -- one of the basic requirements for meditation. During seated meditation, your body should be strong (but not stiff) to maintain a vertical position of the spine. With correct training, your body will gradually become accustomed to holding this posture. Once relaxed, energy will begin to rise up your spine to stimulate the higher energy centres.
<br /><br />Most students will notice the similarity between sitting meditation and the static Taiji posture, since no movement occurs. However, students do not seem to associate the flowing movements of the Taiji routines in the same way. A student should be able to create the same sensations of energy flow that are experienced during seated meditation in all forms of <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">Taiji practice</a></strong>. 
<br /><br />At more advanced stages, internal energy is stimulated and then circulated. This flow of energy becomes an integral part of the body that initiates movement within the form. This fluidity of action will have a calming meditative influence on the individual practicing but also on those watching -- allowing others to benefit from your practice as well.
<br /><br />Mild reminder, taiji has a thousands years history in China, if you want to learn more details, please click <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">tcmtaiji</a></strong>.

		<document id="71886ae089e47e0dfbc05f8a1ca39d16" url=""><![CDATA[Taiji as Meditation(II)<br/><br/><strong>Early Signs of Progress</strong>
<br />A s a <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">beginner</a></strong>, you will experience a variety of sensations that may excite or confuse you. They are all in fact quite harmless and are just signs to indicate that higher levels are being attained. Some of the early sensations that occur during practice include tingling and sweating, caused by heat generated within the body. These <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">sensations</a> </strong> are common and will gradually disappear over time as your body becomes stronger and more accustomed to enhanced circulation of <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">blood and energy</a>.</strong>
<br /><br />Of all the techniques learnt in the early stages, the static postures are the most important since they encourage greater internal awareness. By gradually increasing the length of time that you are able to hold these postures, you will begin to produce similar sensations to those indicated below:
<br /><br /><strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">Relaxing</a></strong> your upper body and sinking at the waist produces a feeling of being strongly rooted to the floor, like being stuck to the floor with glue. This sensation is accompanied by an intense heat in the sole of the foot and is a good indication that blood and energy are circulating freely. These feelings are experienced whilst practicing static postures but are also felt when performing the <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">Taiji</a></strong> routines slowly.
<br /><br />The standing postures often create a feeling of hot water being poured into the legs. This feeling rises from the feet and begins to fill the thighs. By relaxing, this heat travels up the back and surges over the top of the head and is sometimes combined with a trembling of the thighs. At other times, an intense heat swirls and pulsates around the body as it begins to fill the channels with energy, in the same way tributaries are filled following heavy rainfall. These sensations are quite normal and are associated with a feeling of lightness in the upper body and total contentment and connection to your surroundings.
<br /><br />Undertaking regular posture training produces strong feelings of energy circulating within, like having a warm river of electricity, or magnetic oil, passing inside your body. This sensation permeates both bone and muscle with a strong vibrating energy. These sensations are astonishing and develop a feeling of internal strength and fluidity of movement that provides great encouragement to continue with your studies.
<br /><br />The Taiji posture is the simplest to learn, but often the most difficult to perfect. As your body begins to relax from regular training, internal energy begins to circulate freely within. Your skin will become highly sensitive and produces a subtle feeling of warm magnetism surrounding the body, like a &quot;Ready-Brek Glow&quot;. This energy strengthens your body and provides protection from the invasion of harmful external pathogens, such as infections, and viruses and is one of the important benefits to help strengthen your immune system.
<br /><br />After several years of continued practice, your overall ability in the <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">Taiji</a></strong> forms and postures will advance. This growth brings with it stronger and more intense feelings that will vary depending upon the health and vitality of each student.

<br /><strong>
<br />Higher Levels of Development</strong>
<br />Once you become confident and capable in the <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">Taiji</a></strong> forms, you can begin to apply greater emphasis on the internal aspect of the art.
<br /><br />Through studying <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">Taiji</a></strong>, you build an awareness of a universal energy that surrounds and permeates you. The training <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">methods</a></strong> help you to access this universal energy like tuning into your favorite radio station and once you receive a strong signal, your movements will begin to flow powerfully. 
<br /><br />When the body is soft and flexible, this energy is directed to the extremities in wave-like-pulses, similar to the action of cracking a whip. This wave starts from the feet, travels to the waist and radiates from this central hub, spiraling through the limbs. Unique twisting actions found in <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">Chen Style Taiji</a></strong> encourage this energy to travel through the limbs and enhances this flow naturally. This process is only possible once your body is loose and is why so much emphasis is placed on relaxation during the first phase of training.
<br /><br />Once internal energy flow is experienced, the martial application behind the movements becomes clearer. This energy appears gradually and enhances the momentum and fluidity of every action performed. It will take a while for you to reach this level of understanding, but it is worth every ounce of practice. As you approach this stage in your training, you will begin to see the usefulness of <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">Taiji</a></strong>and its effectiveness in a self-defence situation. 
<br /><br />During this phase of training, your state of mind will play a vital role in your progress. You must first develop the belief that you are capable of performing the movements and with this confidence the seed of intention is sown. If nurtured, it will grow to have a profound influence, not just on your movement, but also in all aspects of your life. Taiji promotes a positive outlook and encourages an enthusiasm for life that opens the door for you to explore the furthest reaches of your potential. This outlook will reflect in your behaviour towards others and reinforces the feeling of being connected, not isolated from the world you live in..

<br />The <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vUmVmbGV4b2xvZ3lfVGhlcmFweS9pbmRleC5odG1s" target="_blank">benefits</a></strong> gained during this stage of practice are due to increased levels of energy that circulate through your body's energetic pathways. <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vUmVmbGV4b2xvZ3lfVGhlcmFweS9pbmRleC5odG1s" target="_blank">Relaxation</a></strong> allows this energy to flow and once abundant, is drawn up the spine as a river of vibrating energy, like rising steam. This condensed vapour nourishes your kidneys on its journey to the higher energy centres of the brain before descending vertically down the front of the body, cascading through the throat and chest until it reaches your <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vUmVmbGV4b2xvZ3lfVGhlcmFweS9pbmRleC5odG1s" target="_blank">Dantian</a></strong> (abdominal area), where it is drawn into another circuit.
<br /><br />This transportation system occurs in the same way that water from the ocean evaporates, traveling in the form of clouds and cascading as rain on the earth, until eventually returning back to the sea again by means of streams and rivers. This action will continue to nourish your whole body, as long as your energy remains strong and the body and mind are relaxed and calm.
<br /><br /><strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vUmVmbGV4b2xvZ3lfVGhlcmFweS9pbmRleC5odG1s" target="_blank">Taiji</a></strong> was developed with a profound understanding of these energetic pathways. Through unique spiraling actions found in <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vUmVmbGV4b2xvZ3lfVGhlcmFweS9pbmRleC5odG1s" target="_blank">Chen Style</a> </strong>Taiji, these pathways are freed from blockages to allow energy and fluid to flow smoothly. Once this occurs, your body returns to its original state of optimum health.
<br /><br />Every movement you undertake reinforces the opening and clearing of these pathways, in the same way a Chinese doctor would aim to do using acupuncture or Tuina massage. <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vUmVmbGV4b2xvZ3lfVGhlcmFweS9pbmRleC5odG1s" target="_blank">Taiji</a></strong> exercises have been used for centuries as an effective supplement to Chinese medicine, used to strengthen the body and to promote a long and healthy life.
<br /><br /><strong>Conclusion</strong>   
<br />One should always be aware that <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vUmVmbGV4b2xvZ3lfVGhlcmFweS9pbmRleC5odG1s" target="_blank">Taiji</a></strong> is in the body, not in the mind. You may read and theorize about it, but a true understanding only comes from continued practice. Just keep reminding yourself of the old saying &quot;practice makes perfect&quot;.
<br /><br />Iam very fortunate to have begun my own journey under the guidance of two exceptional teachers, Master Liming Yue and Grandmaster Chen Zhenglei. This level of instruction has given me a deeper understanding of this incredible art and I will be forever grateful for all that I have been taught. Even after a decade of training, I am still enthusiastic and excited in what lies ahead, always aware just how much there is still to learn.

<br />1. Enhancing the <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">health</a></strong> of the nervous system and conditioning the reflex reactions
<br />All of the bodily functions in your daily life are guided by the nervous system. In particular, co-ordination of  the body<strong> <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">muscles</a> </strong>and regulation and control of the internal organs. Most Taijiquan exercises require a focused and relaxed mind during practice. As a result, the exercises stimulate and enhance energy flow within the body, which in turn reinforces the ability of the nervous system to concentrate and focus more easily. In addition, as the nervous system improves, the peripheral nervous system is enhanced, as is the sensitivity of sensory organs such as the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, skin, etc. This makes your reflexes and reactions noticeably faster, and can also help improve your ability to learn new skills. Regular <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">practitioners</a></strong> of Taijiquan find that they feel more energized and fresh, thinking more clearly and feeling happier and more motivated.
<br /><br />Normally, peoples' emotions are linked to the state of their health. Positive motivation and healthy ambition are important factors for good health. An excess of the emotions, such as happiness, anger, worry, thinking, sadness, paranoia or depression and fear, can cause health problems which can often appear as physical symptoms of illness. In China, these are called the &quot;seven emotions.&quot; According to ancient Chinese medical philosophy, the seven emotions are considered as the root cause of illness. They are connected to the six internal organs of the human body. If you are too happy, it can cause heart problems. However if you are too angry, it can cause liver problems. Too much worry and thinking can cause spleen problems while too much <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">sadness</a></strong> can cause lung problems. Excess paranoia or depression can cause kidney damage and excessive fear can damage your gallbladder. There are also six external physical conditions that can contribute to sickness; they include excesses of wind, cold, heat, dampness, dryness and fire. Normally, the six external causes are not strong enough to create illness, but when one or more of the seven emotions are out of balance, the body's defence is weakened against the six external influences entering the body and causing illness. This is why the ancient Chinese medical book Neijing (Yellow Emperor's Internal Canon of Medicine) places <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">emphasis</a></strong> on keeping quiet and calm and ignore any external interruptions, clearing your mind and focusing on your internal feeling when you are practicing Qigong, which is also a key requirement for Taijiquan.
<br /><br />Stressful, busy, fast and intensive modern city life causes people many problems, such as stress, short temper, anxiety, inefficiency and poor sleep patterns. Taiji for Health exercises utilize the &quot;Neijing&quot; principle of using your own mind to relax your body and spirit, relieve stress, and calm the seven emotions. This reduces the chances of becoming ill, and improves overall health..

<br />2. Improving the Condition of Bones, Joints and Muscles and the Ability to Exercise
<br />Taiji for Health <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">exercises</a> </strong>are based on turning, spiraling and twisting movements. These types of movement co-ordinate the bones, joints and muscles, increasing the density,  thickness  and strength of the<strong> <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">bones</a></strong>, the muscles also becoming stronger. In turn, this makes bones harder and more resistant to being injured or broken. The joints and the tendons around them also become more flexible and elastic. This is good for the well-being of the joints and muscles, improving the practice of Taijiquan and significantly increasing your ability to apply or defeat a lock movement. Beyond that, the sensitivity gained from practicing these exercises both relaxes the mind and <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">body</a></strong> as well as enhances the ability to react to external stimuli.
<br /><br />All of these twisting and spiraling <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">movements</a></strong> are controlled by the mind, based on the relaxation of the body. The whole body co-operates with itself, with muscle fibre becoming longer (because of the twisting movements), more elastic and stronger. One of the benefits of this kind of exercise is its <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">ability</a></strong> to reduce the amount of fat around the muscles and open the pores of your skin, resulting in the skin looking and feeling smoother, softer and healthier. A further benefit is that slim people are able to put more muscle on, and overweight people are able to get rid of excess fat, aiding weight loss.
<br /><br />Mild reminder, taiji is a health exercise which is good for your health, if you want to learn more about this topic, please click <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">tcmtaiji</a></strong>.

<br /><strong>3.Strengthening the Digestive System and Improving the Respiratory Functions</strong>
<br />The basic <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">functions</a></strong> of the digestive system are to ingest food, absorb nutrients and expel waste. In <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">Chinese medicine</a></strong>, the digestive system and a person's state of health is closely connected to the ability of the six internal organs to function correctly. <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">Taiji</a></strong> for Health exercises are smooth, gentle and slow. The breath naturally follows the body movements, which in turn allows internal energy to circulate more freely inside the body, flowing through all of the internal organs. The long, deep breaths taken during Taiji exercises greatly benefit the muscles that aid digestion, producing a gentle <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">massage</a></strong> for the stomach and intestines.
<br /><br />This in turn stimulates secretions from the digestive glands, reducing digestion time and improving the assimilation of food and therefore nutrition. Thus, practicing Taiji for <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">Health</a></strong> exercises improves appetite, cures dyspepsia, gastrointestinal neurosis, gastric ulcers, anorexia, bulimia and other eating disorders.
<br /><br /><strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">Taiji</a></strong> for Health exercises coordinate body movements and breathing allowing <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">Qi</a></strong> energy to flow to the four extremities (the tips of fingers and toes), resulting in the breath becoming slower, deeper and longer. During this process, the contraction and expansion of the abdominal muscles is improved, and the traction force between the lungs is increased. The contact area between capillary vessels and alveoli enlarges, improving lung capacity and efficiency. 
<br /><br />Heart tips, a benefit of practicing taiji is being able to maintain your concentration for longer without getting tired and improving your working efficiency.

<br />4.Strengthening the <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">Functions</a></strong> of the Heart, Improving the Condition of the Blood Vessels
<br /><strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">taiji</a></strong> for Health exercises can make the cardiac muscle fibre wider and stronger, the wall of the heart thicker, the contracting ability better and <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">blood circulation</a></strong> easier. In addition, it can improve the flexibility and fortitude of the arterial wall, making the diameter of coronary arteries wider. These changes improve the functioning of the blood vessel system which in turn assists the absorption of nutrition by the digestive organs, improves oxygen absorption into the lungs and assists the secretion of hormones by internal glands to organs and tissues. Regular practice of <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">Taijiquan</a></strong> can greatly help in improving all of the functions of the heart. The heart rate when you are quiet is lower than usual, slightly increasing when you are moving normally, and greatly increasing when exercising vigorously, but resuming its slow rate faster than usual. Overall, Taijiquan is beneficial to homeostasis, metabolism and the stability of the internal organs.

<br /><strong>5. Stimulating the Internal Energy, Smoothing the Jingluo</strong>
<br /><strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkv" target="_blank">Jingluo</a></strong> (acupuncture meridians, or channels) are the main blood and Qi energy channels and are directly related to the body and mind's state of health. If the channels are free of blockages health will be good. If the channels are blocked sickness can occur. According to philosophy included in the ancient Chinese medical classic, Yellow Emperor's Internal Canon of Medicine Lingshu, &quot;Those 12 <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkv" target="_blank">channels</a></strong> are the source of people's living, as well as people's sickness. To find out and cure the sickness you have to check the 12 channels and their conditions.&quot; Essentially, traditional Chinese medicine (<strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkv" target="_blank">TCM</a></strong>) is a lifetime of continuously studying the 12 channels.
<br /><br />Maintaining the channels by keeping them unblocked helps to prevent illness and maintains the body's natural balance and harmony.
<br /><br /><strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkv" target="_blank">Taijiquan</a></strong> and <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkv" target="_blank">Qigong exercises</a></strong> have many different methods of practice. Whichever method you choose, the final goal and fundamental purpose is to increase the level of Qi energy within the body and drive it through the 12 main channels, producing a half-body energy circle (Xiaozhoutian) or a full-body energy circle (Dazhoutian). The benefits of this can vary from the prevention of sickness to maintaining a good level of fitness, helping to keep the mind  sharp  and keen  while enjoying a long and healthy life.
<br /><br />Mild reminder, practicing taiji, and living a healthy life. If you want to learn more details, please click <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkv" target="_blank">tcmtaiji</a></strong>.

<br /><strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkv" target="_blank">Internal energy</a></strong> (Qi) is the vital living force existing within every human body. The flow of internal energy is integral to the health of the individual. This internal energy is present from birth but how it develops and strengthens depends upon the level of practice and training that is undertaken by each individual. As long as you practice with a reasonable method, the internal energy will begin to increase in power and become a uniting force within the body. The outcome is that one can use this enhanced energy for self-defence, maintaining a <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkv" target="_blank">healthy life</a></strong>, enhancing the ability to rid oneself of sickness and preventing <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkv" target="_blank">diseases</a></strong> from entering the body in the first place.
<br /><br />The <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkv" target="_blank">Taiji</a></strong> for Health method of exercising requires a relaxed body, a calm mind and a quiet environment. Using the mind in combination with correct body posture and movements to direct internal energy increases Qi circulation within the body. Once the internal energy starts to get more powerful, <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkv" target="_blank">Qi</a></strong> energy will flow with greater ease through the 12 main energy channels and spread throughout the whole body. Under your control and direction, the internal energy moves through your heart, maintaining it in a good state by relaxing it and making it more flexible, thus helping to prevent heart attacks. If moved through the kidneys, the internal energy makes them stronger, making you feel more energized and revitalized. When the energy moves through the lungs it makes your breathing much longer and deeper, moving oxygen to the brain more efficiently. Also, because the breathing goes up and down to your <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkv" target="_blank">Dantian</a></strong> (lower abdomen), it results in shortening the length of time in which you are out of breath after exercising or undertaking strenuous activity. Once the energy passes through the liver it helps to cool it down, relieving it from any &quot;anger-heat.&quot; Then, if it is directed through the spleen, it improves its ability to work with the stomach which, in turn, helps the digestive system as well as the absorption of nutrition. Direct the energy up to the head and it brings a calmer and more refreshed feeling. As the blood supply increases and the brain gets more oxygen, the optical nerves relax, making your eyesight sharper. It also helps to keep them in good working order.
<br /><br />Once the energy passes through your skin, it can make it look smoother, more shiny and softer to the touch. When the energy travels through your blood vessels, it helps the blood to circulate more freely, preventing any blockage of the arteries, therefore helping to prevent heart attacks. When it travels through your hair, it makes the hair very sensitive, and the scalp more efficient in getting rid of all the waste fluids when you perspire. An ancient Chinese medical health <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkv" target="_blank">expert</a></strong> once said, &quot;Use your mind to direct your Qi energy according to your own body's requirements and, in this way, rid the body of any sickness. Many of the internal sicknesses can thus be cured.&quot;

<br />People from other countries who visit <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">China</a></strong> are often impressed -- both touched and puzzled -- by the Chinese enthusiasm for early <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">morning exercise</a></strong>, especially <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">Taijiquan</a></strong> that has been one of the most popular forms of morning exercises in China for ages.
<br /><br />Chinese have been &quot;getting up at the crack of dawn to practice with the sword,&quot; as the old saying goes, since ancient times. The story behind the saying can be traced to Zu Di, a Jin Dynasty (265-420) general who from childhood dreamed of doing great things for his country on the battlefield. This <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">ambition</a></strong> inspired him as a youth to get up early on hearing the crow of a rooster and wake up his friends to go practice unarmed combat and sword techniques every morning. Later when the State of Jin was forced to retreat down to the south of the Yangtze River after being invaded by a foreign state, General Zu Di led the Jin army across the Yangtze to recover a large area of lost territory. Stories about Zu Di's exploits have inspired <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">Chinese youth</a></strong> over the generations to dedicate themselves to hard study and training in the service of their country. The stories also helped establish a tradition of practicing the martial arts early in the morning to <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">keep fit</a></strong>.
<br /><br />In <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">Beijing parks</a></strong> in the downtown area like Tiantan Park, Zhongshan Park, and Dongdan Park, people can be seen everywhere doing morning exercises of various kinds. But the most eye-catching are those people wholly concentrated in practicing <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">Taijiquan</a></strong>. Their slow steps and gentle movements seem to carry them to a world above the mortal life, seeing and hearing nothing around them. Only when the exercises are over do they return to the busy life of this world. Many ride bicycles or get on a bus to get back to their work.
<br /><br />The first regular bus to Fragrant Hills, a scenic region in the western suburbs of Beijing about 15 miles from the downtown area, is always crowded with people going to the mountains to do morning exercises. So popular is this activity that the bus company had to add extra buses and open a special line to the Fragrant Hills. Once I went there, too, invited by a friend. Half way up the mountain, I was out of breath but my Taiji friend said that they had yet to start their morning exercises. They practice <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">Taijiquan</a></strong> here everyday for half an hour before going back down the mountain.

<br />On my campus of Renmin University in northwest <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">Beijing</a></strong>, many teachers and students make it a point to take time in the morning to do three things before going to class: <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">Morning exercises</a></strong>, morning reading and breakfast. As an old Chinese <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">proverb</a></strong> goes: &quot;The plan of the year starts in spring; the plan of the day begins in the morning.&quot;
<br /><br />My colleague Wu Qiantao, a professor at the Philosophy Department at Renmin University, offers an example of the many who make it a point to arrange their morning fully in good order. In addition to teaching, his responsibilities include supervising students writing doctoral dissertations and directing the work of the university's information office. Since he has to receive many visitors during the day, he often works until midnight. But still, he never changes his habit of getting up at six every morning to practice <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">Taijiquan</a></strong>, taking a shower at seven, and having breakfast before going to work at eight. It is hard to see how his slow movements in Taijiquan connect with his busy work schedule, yet he says: &quot;No matter how busy I am, I do 30 minutes of <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">Taijiquan</a></strong> in the morning. Otherwise, I don't have the energy and spirit for the whole day.&quot;
<br /><br />A <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">Taiji</a></strong> friend who practices in a park early in the morning once told me in a goodnatured way:     &quot;People who come fall into three types: The first to arrive like us treasure life and crave good health. After we leave, the second batch includes tourists who come to appreciate the scenery and flowers. They enjoy life and have good health. The third batch that comes in the evening is pairs of lovers. They create life but neglect their health.&quot; Beyond being an important recreational and sports activity, Taijiquan permeates Chinese culture. For instance, in China a friend might ask about someone: &quot;Is he a hot-headed, outspoken person or does he have a <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">Taijiquan</a></strong> temper?&quot; Which means -- Is he quick to anger or does he have an even disposition? Also, you might hear: &quot;Don't play Taijiquan with me. Please come straight to the point.&quot; This means that the speaker wants you to speak directly and frankly, not in a roundabout way.
<br /><br />Mild reminder, to thoroughly understand the life of the Chinese people, one has to understand Taijiquan.

Bathed in  the morning sun and cool ocean breeze, this diverse group came together to perform slowly to the rhythm of music in harmony under the blue sky and white clouds.

<br />In Chinese &quot;<strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">Tài</a> </strong>?&quot; means the highest or supreme, as in describing the highest heaven or the supreme ruler. &quot;<strong>Jí</strong> ?&quot; means the last or the ultimate. The word &quot;<strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">Tàijí</a></strong>??&quot; first appeared in The Book of Changes, which was written more than 3,000 years ago, in a reference to the most primitive state of the universe, the origin of all changes, or the highest realm of existence.
<br /><br />The Book of Changes (<strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">Yìj?ng</a></strong> ??) is composed of two parts, the Text (J?ng ?) and Commentaries (Zhuàn (?). The Text deals mainly with divination and an integrated system of trigrams or hexagrams (guà?). As symbols of divination, the eight trigrams are formed in various ways to tell fortunes according to interpretations of the lines of the trigrams. Legend has it that the classic Text was written by the King Wen of the Zhou Dynasty (11 century- 256 BC). The Commentaries include an interpretation or discussion of the Text, composed of philosophical essays by many different people that express their world outlook based on the theory of yin and yang. In &quot;The Great Interpretation&quot; essay in the Commentaries section of The Book of Changes, Taiji was first mentioned as follows:
<br /><br />&quot;Yì (?) contains Tàijí(??) which gave birth to the two basic <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">elements</a></strong>; the two basic elements gave birth to the four symbolic figures; the four symbolic figures then gave birth to the eight elementary trigrams (b?guà??) that can predict fortune and misfortune, which enables great accomplishment.&quot;
<br /><br />Here Taiji refers to the origin of changes, the most primitive state from which everything evolves. It is the highest state of existence. Throughout the ages, Chinese scholars have offered different philosophical interpretations of the world based on the <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">Taiji yin-yang theory</a></strong>. For example:
<br /><br />&quot;Before Heaven and Earth were divided, the primal fluid--primary elements that form Heaven and Earth--were combined into one. That is the beginning of the great Unity of Tai or the great oneness of Tai.&quot;
<br />     -- Kong Yingda of the Tang Dynasty (618-907)
<br />    &quot;Taiji was the primeval chaotic and primitive state of the universe before Heaven and Earth were formed.&quot;
<br />    --Wang Tingxiang of the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644)

When the movement reached its peak, it quieted down into motionlessness to become <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">yin</a></strong>. At its extreme point, yin began to move and turn toward yang. The polarized motion and stillness or yang and yin produce and promote one another. The theory of the five elements (<strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">w?xíng</a></strong> ??) came from yin and yang; Yin and yang came from Taiji.&quot;

<br />     &quot;Taiji covers everything in the universe.&quot;
<br />     -- The Song Dynasty philosopher Zhu Xi
<br />     &quot;Taiji is the heart and mind.&quot; And: &quot;Taiji is the Dao (Way).&quot;

<br /><br />The <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">Taiji yin-yang theory</a></strong> that is such an important part of ancient Chinese philosophy serves as the theoretical basis of Taijiquan. But only in modern times did the Taiji name become associated with a kind of unarmed method of combat [quán ?, literally, &quot;fist&quot;].
<br /><br /><strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">Taijiquan</a></strong> (???) or &quot;Taiji Fist&quot; was first called the &quot;13 <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">Methods</a></strong> (eight techniques plus five stances).&quot; It was also called Changquan (long fist), referring to its long and continuous form; Ruanquan (soft fist), Rouquan (gentle fist), and Zhanmianquan (adhering fist). The name of Taijiquan formally came into being in the &quot;Treatise on Taijiquan&quot; written by Wang Zongyue, a martial arts master of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911 ). Wang Zongyue named Taijiquan after the Taiji yin-yang theory to signify that Taijiquan is based on this fundamental principle of the universe as well as on the belief that people are an integral part of nature. The name also represents Taijiquan's combining firmness with gentleness. Unfathomable and unpredictable through its interplay of the insubstantial and the substantial (empty and solid), Taijiquan is invincible.

<br />As both experience and scientific research have shown, <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">Taijiquan</a></strong> is a <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">physical activity</a></strong> that helps keep both the mind and body healthy. Combining motion and stillness, Taijiquan embodies Chinese cultural approaches to maintaining <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">good health</a></strong>: Motion keeps the body fit while stillness nourishes the mind.
<br /><br /><strong> 1. How Taijiquan Works on the Nervous System</strong>
<br /><br />When practicing <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">Taijiquan</a></strong>, your mind should be calm with all movement initiated and directed by the mind (yì ?). The cortex of your brain should be in a protective state of rest. This is a kind of active rest for people who use their brains a lot at work, a helpful <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">treatment</a></strong> for the modern sickness caused by too much tension and lack of exercise. Experiments show that the brain consumes 1/8 to 1/6 of the energy needed by the human body. Too much tension not only consumes a lot of energy but can also lead to a lack of coordination in the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems, causing disruptions in the brain cortex and thus inviting many diseases. The practice of Taijiquan can dispel tension and fatigue in the nerves of the brain, refresh the mind, and activate the spirit. It can help regulate the nervous system and help cure some chronic <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">diseases</a></strong>, promoting hormonal balance and improved immunity. Also, because Taijiquan requires the use of the mind, the brain continuously sends out benign signals to cause the qi, blood and energy to focus on the intended parts of the body in a way that can invigorate the body's metabolism and increase blood circulation by some 30 percent. Doctors sometimes use &quot;biofeedback&quot; to describe this  phenomenon. Buddhist meditation, the ancient Chinese method of expiration and  inspiration, and qigong in modern times are all examples of trying to cause physiological changes by using the mind and will. It is through &quot;leading the body with the mind&quot; (yî yì d?otî ????) and the &quot;focus of the mind&quot; (yì niàn guànzhù ????) smooth circulation of blood and energy throughout the body.

<br /><br />The gentle and coordinated movements of <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">Taijiquan</a></strong> can make the blood vessels more &quot;springy&quot; and the nerves steadier, thus more adaptable to changes in temperature and unexpected trauma. Not an intensive or aerobic <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">exercise</a></strong>, Taijiquan can decrease blood pressure so that its faithful practice can help prevent high <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">blood pressure</a></strong> and hardening of the arteries. Experiments have shown that constant intensive movement makes animals prone to high blood pressure, while gentle and moderate exercises can keep the blood pressure stable. Taijiquan is just such a moderate exercise. According to research, elderly people who practice Taijiquan on a regular basis enjoy normal blood pressure, a strong pulse and rarely suffer from <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">arteriosclerosis</a></strong>.

Beyond increasing depth of breathing, this exercise of the diaphragm also stimulates the movement of the bowels, thus enhancing digestion as well as blood circulation in the abdomen.

<br />Since the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">Taijiquan</a></strong> has received support from the highest levels of the Chinese government. In June 1952, Mao Zedong, chairman of the Central People's Government, issued a call to &quot;encourage all people who can to engage in exercises, ball games, running, mountain climbing, swimming and practicing Taijiquan.&quot; In 1978, Chinese Vice Premier Deng Xiaoping inscribed in his calligraphy the <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">Chinese characters</a></strong>: &quot;Taijiquan is wonderful&quot; (????). With the support of national leaders, Taijiquan thrived even in the early years of the People's Republic of China as well as in the difficult years after the &quot;cultural revolution.&quot; The State Martial Arts Administration established a <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">ranking system</a></strong> with corresponding instructional materials for evaluation of different levels of the martial arts. The month of May was set as National <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">Martial</a></strong> Arts Health month, a time during which Taijiquan is taught free to the public nationwide in China with celebrations and activities that have attracted thousands of amateur Taijiquan <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">practitioners</a></strong>. Since 1959, the martial arts – including Taijiquan -- have been included as a formal event in China's top national sports meet, held every four years where the martial arts events until today are the only ones not included in the venue of the Olympic Games.
<br /><br />Among all these activities, Taijiquan <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">competition</a></strong> has received the most attention, without a doubt. Throughout martial arts history, contests have been held to compare the &quot;<strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">gongfu</a></strong>&quot; or prowess of competitors that have allowed the most powerful competitor -- the champion -- to appear. Contests in Taijiquan also have been conducted through push-hands between two competitors, with the more skillful regarded as the winner. Following the listing of Taijiquan as a recognized national sport in China, competition in Taijiquan came to include, in addition to push-hands, the many forms or set routines of <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">Taijiquan</a></strong>.
<br /><br />At first, judges gave on-the-spot evaluations and accorded marks according to the display of individual skills. However, because traditional Taijiquan routines are rather long -- an average of 80-100 routine movements with many repetitions -- it takes at least 20 minutes to finish one form. This was hardly acceptable to the audience or event organizers of modern-day sports competitions. Besides, it is difficult to make a judgment about traditional Taijiquan because of the differences in standards and ways of practice among different regions, schools and masters. So to make Taijiquan suitable as a spectator sport, the rules for Taijiquan competition had to change -- and they have gone through several revisions.
<br /><br />In the 1960s and 1970s, specific rules were established for Taijiquan competition. A time limit was set at five or six minutes for each Taijiquan <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">routine</a></strong>. <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">Athletes</a></strong> could choose their own routines for competition, but the routine had to include four different kicks and six movements from different categories of movements. The rules included specific guidelines on technical requirements as well as movement categories. Meanwhile, five standards were set for evaluation of different competition routines selected by athletes themselves.

<br />In the 1990s, the Chinese Martial Arts Association established <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">competition guidelines</a></strong> for the five <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">major schools</a></strong> of Taijiquan -- Chen-style, Yang-style, Wu (?)-style, Sun-style, and Wu (?)-style Taijiquan, as well as for the combined-form of 42-step Taiiiquan and Taiji sword, that provided standardized forms to make <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">Taijiquan</a></strong> more suitable for competition.
<br /><br />In the 21 st century, more specific scoring system <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">rules</a></strong> have been added related to quality and degree of difficulty, improving Taijiquan sports competition by encouraging <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">performances</a></strong> that are both more elegant and up to date. The rules stipulate that judges must take into account these three aspects in their scoring: Quality of movement, performance ability and technical difficulty. These rules have made Taijiquan competition more exciting, focused and accurate.
<br /><br />Taijiquan competition today in China can be divided into three <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">kinds</a></strong>: Optional routines, compulsory routines, and routines that can have extra credit according to the levels of technical difficulties.
<br /><br />Among the myriad of competition routines, one stands out -- Simplified or 24-Step Taijiquan. (See Chapter VI) It appears everywhere, from grass roots com,, petitions to national Taijiquan conferences and competitions -- even at the Annual International Taijiquan Convention and Competition held in Wenxian County in Henan Province, the birthplace of traditional Taijiquan. Why has the modern 24- Step Taijiquan, one small flower in the garden of Taijiquan, attracted so much care and attention?
<br /><br />Not long after Mao Zedong issued a proclamation to promote <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">physical education</a></strong>, a national meet featuring Chinese sports was held where Taijiquan appeared at a national sports meet for the first time in the history of the People's Republic of China. During that gathering, Marshal He Long, director of the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission, urged extensive research into the traditional martial arts to make them more scientific with the hope that the martial arts might become a modern-day sport and as such play a bigger role in the physical fitness of the nation.
<br /><br />In response to this significant challenge, <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">Taijiquan</a></strong> lead the way. In 1956, a group of Taijiquan experts organized by the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission created the Simplified 24-Step Taijiquan based on Yang-style Taijiquan, making a complicated form simple and concise, and removing repetitions. The 24-Step Taijiquan then became the first set of martial arts material published by thenational government. It was an epoch-making event. From that moment, martial arts in China went beyond the bounds of the traditional way of teaching passed on by word of mouth from master to disciples. Instead, Taijiquan entered into schools, factories, hospitals and the daily life of the ordinary people-- truly carrying <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">Yaijiquan</a></strong> forward into modern times.
<br /><br />This was not welcomed in some conservative and sectarian martial arts circles where the new form was criticized as &quot;departing from tradition&quot; or for &quot;losing the nobility of tradition.&quot; However, Simplified 24-Step Taijiquan in fact neither changed the traditional ways of practice, nor did it lower the standards of Taijiquan. What it did do was provide a step for beginners to enter the door, leading many to continue to probe ever deeper as they constantly worked to improve their Taijiquan techniques. Many life-long followers of Taijiquan first began to know and love Taijiquan through the 24-Step form.
<br /><br />Today 24-Step Taijiquan has answered all its critics by becoming the most popular form of Taijiquan in China, and the world. Both Beijing and Shanghai have held 10,000-people <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">performances</a></strong> of 24-Step Taijiquan. It is among the required physical education classes at Beijing University and many other universities, and tens of thousands of students every year are practicing the simplified form of Taijiquan. It is estimated that the simplified Taijiquan has spread to more than 100 countries, and several hundred millions of people have practiced it. Take the Japanese Federation of Martial Arts and Taijiquan, for example, where some 90 percent of its 10 million registered members have practiced 24-Step Taijiquan. This simplified Taijiquan has played an enormous role in promoting Taijiquan, which is why this little flower is so treasured by so many people.
<br /><br />Mild reminder, taijiquan is loved by many people around the world, to learn more details, please click <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVGFpamkvaW5kZXguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">tcmtaiji</a></strong>.
