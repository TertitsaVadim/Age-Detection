Early in the bit, David reveals a recurring daydream: &quot;Sometimes I have a lot of these fantasies of just moving to a foreign country and coming back with a full curly hair. Or not even return! Make a new existence there with hair... Switch my name, just see what goes on. &quot;<br /><br />He notes that will his Curb character is actually &quot;my version of Superman. The character really is me, but I recently couldn't possibly behave like that. If I had my own druthers, that would be me on a regular basis, but you can't try this. We're always doing things we don't want to do, we never say that which you really feel, and so this can be an idealized version of how I have to be. As crazy since this person is, We could step into those shoes right now, but I would end up arrested or I'd end up hit or whatever. &quot;<br /><br />Other highlights and noteworthy items in the website (which also includes interviews while using the cast of Curb Your Enthusiasm, as well as David's ex-wife Laurie):<br /><br />David contends with Howard Stern, who found it shallow to go out with women who were drawn to his fame: &quot;Why as well would somebody approach everyone? Who's going up to a bald guy, an old bald guy? Nobody! If i wasn't on television, who's on the agenda to me? People would probably run from me, considering kidding? If I tried to flirt which has a woman and she didn't fully understand who I was, she would run away. &quot; Your dog pauses. &quot;And who's not necessarily shallow, by the approach? &quot;<br /><br />He feels that will his pre-Seinfeld stand-up occupation is unfinished business â?? together with he's currently writing material to get a return to the humourous clubs. &quot;I think it would be a great experience so as to go up and receive an audience of fans, &quot; he says. &quot;It would be very different for me, and it's whatever I've never experienced. &quot;<br /><br />David says he's unlikely to ever get hitched all over again. &quot;It would be a silly course of action, &quot; he says. &quot;Why would I it? Why would I'd prefer that contract? I have already kids. The best situation is a single parent. The best part about is that you purchase time off, too, because the kids are with their mom, so it's the most effective of both worlds. There's a lot to be said for it. You get married, you have kids â?? you must plan this from the beginning. We're going to get these kids, then we'll get hold of divorced when they're several. &quot;.<br /><br />Check out more here:<br /><br />thelarrydavidstory <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/mellow.gif" alt=":)" /> com<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy50aGVsYXJyeWRhdmlkc3RvcnkuY29tL2xhcnJ5X2RhdmlkX2Jpb2dyYXBoeV90aW1lbGluZS5odG1s" target="_blank">Larry David Curb Your Enthusiasm</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy50aGVsYXJyeWRhdmlkc3RvcnkuY29tL2xhcnJ5X2RhdmlkX21vdmllX3Byb2plY3QuaHRtbA__" target="_blank">Larry David Curb Your Enthusiasm</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy50aGVsYXJyeWRhdmlkc3RvcnkuY29t" target="_blank">Larry David Writer Book Biography</a>
