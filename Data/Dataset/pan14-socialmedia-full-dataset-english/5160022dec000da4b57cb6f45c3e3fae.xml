<br /><br />Little Johnny was 7 years old and like other boys his age rather
<br />curious.
<br /><br />He had been hearing quite a bit
<br />about 'making out'
<br />from the older boys, and he wondered
<br />what it was
<br />and how it was done.
<br /><br />One day he took his question to his
<br />mother, who
<br />became rather flustered. Instead of
<br />explainingthings to Johnny, she told him to hide
<br />behind the
<br />curtains one night and watch his older
<br />sister and
<br />her boyfriend.
<br /><br />This he did. The following morning,
<br />Johnny
<br />described EVERYTHING to his mother.
<br /><br />&quot;Sis and her boyfriend sat and talked for
<br />a while, then he turned off most of the lights.
<br /><br />Then he started kissing and hugging her.
<br />I figured 'Sis must be getting sick, because her 
<br />face started looking funny.
<br /><br />He must have thought so too, because he put his
<br />hand inside her blouse to feel her heart,
<br />just the way the doctor would. Except he's not as
<br />smart as the doctor because he seemed to have
<br />trouble finding her heart.
<br /><br />I guess he was getting sick too,
<br />because pretty soon both of them started
<br />panting and getting all out of breath.
<br /><br />His other hand must have been cold
<br />because he put it under her skirt.
<br /><br />About this time 'Sis got worse and began
<br />to moan and sigh and squirm around and slide
<br />down toward the end of the couch. 
<br /><br />This was when her fever started.
<br />I knew it was a fever, because Sis
<br />told him she felt really hot.
<br /><br />Finally, I found out what was making them so
<br />sick......-a big eel ;had gotten inside his pants
<br />somehow. It just jumped out of his pants and
<br />stood there, about 10 inches long, honest, anyway
<br />he grabbed it in one hand to keep it from getting
<br />away.
<br /><br />When Sis saw it, she got really scared-her eyes
<br />got big, and her mouth fell open, and
<br />she started calling out to God and stuff like that. 
<br />She said it was the biggest one she's ever seen; 
<br />I should tell her about the ones down at the lake by
<br />our house!
<br /><br />Anyway, Sis got brave and tried to kill the eel by
<br />biting its head off.The eel spit on her face
<br />a little bit and then, All of a sudden she grabbed it
<br />with both hands and held it tight while he
<br />took a muzzle out of his pocket and slipped it
<br />over the eel's head to keep it from biting again.
<br /><br />Sis lay back and spread her legs so she
<br />could get a scissor-lock on it and he helped by lying
<br />on top of the eel. The eel put up a hell of a fight.
<br /><br />Sis started groaning and squealing and her
<br />boyfriend almost upset the couch. I guess
<br />they wanted to kill the eel by squashing it
<br />between them.
<br /><br />After a while they both quit moving and gave a
<br />great sigh. Her boyfriend got up, and sure enough,
<br />they killed the eel. I knew because it just
<br />hung there, limp, and some of its insides were
<br />hanging out.
<br /><br />Sis and her boyfriend were a little tired from the
<br />battle, but they went back to courting anyway. 
<br />He started hugging and kissing her again. By
<br />golly, the eel wasn't dead! It jumped straight up
<br />and started to fight again.
<br /><br />I guess eels are like cats- they have nine lives or
<br />something. This time, Sis jumped up and
<br />tried to kill it by sitting on it. After about a 35
<br />minute struggle, they finally killed the eel. 
<br />I knew it was dead, because I saw Sis's boyfriend peel
<br />its skin off and flush it down the toilet.

<br />That make me understand
<br />The man who wants more
<br />When all is placed out for him
<br />Or the one that wants no-more
<br />Once all bases are reached
<br />The one you trust
<br />Just to watch them rip it
<br />at the seams
<br /><br />The father that says the will be there
<br />But never is
<br />Or the mother that will make a promise
<br />Just to watch it break
<br /><br />The close friend that you would
<br />take a bullet for
<br />But they would never do the same
<br />for you
<br /><br />The best friend you would
<br />offer the world to
<br />Just to watch them waste it
<br />The neighbour that will talk
<br />only when in need of something
<br />The mate that will sit by your side
<br />Just to laugh when your back is turned
<br />The new girl that is beautiful
<br />But is trapped by unfaithfull words
<br />The friend you hardly know
<br />I am in love just by thier smile
<br /><br />The saviour in your eyes
<br />That cares nothing about you
<br /><br />The people you could die for
<br />And theyd do the same for you
<br />You think its out of love
<br />But its only because they felt
<br />that had to
<br />The one you are in love with
<br />But will never say it back
<br />The hate printed on paper
<br />Only their to make you remember
<br />The man that will make you loose everything
<br />Will be the one I desire

<br />Even the most beautiful person, the one that has no flaws
<br />Just sits their knowing your heart will shatter
<br />but wont give a shit until its too late.
<br />I hate people like you
<br />You, the ones who think a girl has to be perfect
<br />The one that thinks age is the biggest deal in the world
<br />The one who says no, but still lets you do it.
<br />Those fucking assholes, everyone has had one.
<br />I cant hate you, I love you.
<br />But nothing I do will or could do, will be good enough
<br />for your stupid standards.
<br />Nothing I FUCKING DO will make you see
<br />Not every girl wears their armor and beauty on the outside
<br />Not every fucking girl likes it to be ripped apart at the seams
<br />I know I was the one who fucked it up, but baby, you inniciated it.
<br />You inniciated it from the word go, even tho it was ME who was unsure
<br />You took it too far, and now im left here, like this, a wreck.
<br />I hate you, I hate every guy
<br />your all the fucking same, you wont know what you have until you never get it offered again
<br />Your fucking pathetic, low life arrogant fucks, seriously.
<br />One thing is important to you, and when the oppurtunity arises for it
<br />This armor is not going to hold for the life of me.
<br /><br />I love you too much
<br /><br />Make me hate you, please
