Our <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5nYW1lZGV2ZWxvcG1lbnRpbmRpYS5jb20vZmFjZWJvb2stZ2FtZS1kZXZlbG9wbWVudC5odG1s" target="_blank"><strong>Facebook Game Development</strong></a> team works out game concepts with clear and simple objectives, well-suited to your brand image. Various levels and challenges make the game shareable within different social circles, ensuring virality. Consequently, brand stories around the Facebook Game are generated, giving it more visibility.    
<br /><br />Facebook Games are different from their console and desktop counterparts. It trades long sessions of game play for short, frequent interactions, and the game mechanics take advantage of new and existing social connections and weave them into the traditional goal and reward model that is at the heart of every game. This calls for radically different approach of development for Facebook games. You can't plug in any existing game in Facebook and call it one. 
<br /><strong>
<br />Why Facebook Gaming? </strong>
<br /><br />=&gt; Fairly simple to build compared to AAA games like World of Warcraft and the like. 
<br />=&gt; It’s not that hard to monetize through the sale of virtual goods and offers. 
<br />=&gt; Gaining user-base is immensely helped via Facebook’s social stream. 
<br />=&gt; Facebook is adding around a 100 million users every month (ever-growing potential user-pool). 
<br />=&gt; These games cannot be pirated. 
<br />=&gt; As a monetization platform, the iPhone undersells your applications whereas Facebook over-sells them. 
<br />=&gt; Facebook trumps the iPhone in terms of potential user-base by hundreds of millions of more users! 
<br /><br /><strong>What Technology Should I Use? </strong>
