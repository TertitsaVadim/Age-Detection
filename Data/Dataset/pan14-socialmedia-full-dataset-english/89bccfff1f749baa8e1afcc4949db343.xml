<br /><br />Beautiful Sunshine
<br /><br />She gets up on the wrong side of bed,
<br />the world is turned upside down on her
<br />everything is thrown into darkness.
<br /><br />The next day the same thing happenes
<br />her world is turned upside down on her
<br />she hates how her friends changed
<br /><br />She hates getting up in the morning
<br />because everyday its the wrong side of the bed
<br />her world is still turned upside down
<br /><br />One morning it becomes all different though
<br />she wakes up feeling the same but,
<br />one day that all changes.
<br /><br />The world turns right side up
<br />her life is no longer gloomy
<br />and she finally has something to live for.
<br /><br />This is the day she met him.

<br /><br />- Girl:
<br />Okay but only if you promise me that you will hold my hand while we're driving.
<br /><br />- Boy:
<br />I promise.
<br /><br />- Girl:
<br />Ok blind fold me...
<br /><br />So they drove off...........and then they stoped.
<br /><br />- Boy:
<br />Ok we're here!
<br /><br />-Girl:
<br />Where?
<br /><br />- Boy:

<br /><br />- Boy:
<br />Somewhere! (and gives a kiss to her on the lips)
<br /><br />- Girl:
<br />Baby!...
<br /><br />The boy walks her to the place.
<br /><br />- Boy:
<br />Ok...let me take the blind fold off.
<br /><br />- Girl:
<br />Where are we?
<br /><br />He takes it off her and she opens her eyes and sees the view of the city and at that same spot...that's where he first asked her to be his girlfriend....
<br /><br />- Girl:
<br />Omg...(tears come down)
<br /><br />- Boy:
<br />Why are you crying?
<br /><br />- Girl:
<br />This is where you first asked me out...
<br /><br />- Boy:
<br />What are you doing the rest of your life? (he asked on his knees and after he says that...behind him...in the air it says &quot;Will you marry me?&quot; in fireworks)
<br /><br />- Girl:
<br />(tears come down faster)
<br /><br />- Boy:
<br />I wasnt at work when you called me...I was planning this whole thing!
<br /><br />- Girl:
