<br />that Bey is supposedly delivering whatever it is she's carrying.Update: after 
<br />watching the video (and laughing my head off!), we decided to compare pics of 
<br />what a real pregnant woman looks like when she sits, compared to bumbling 
<br />Beyonce.First of all, do you see Beyonce's awful posture when she sits What 
<br />pregnant woman sits leaning so far forward with her head down at an almost 45 
<br />degree angle to her stomach Notice how she's not protecting her stomach when she

<br />Not just to win a minor trophy, but also to use the lead up to the World Cup to 
<br />catch the teams that are down men (Galaxy, RSL, Crew, and more). Seattle was not 
<br />weakened by the USA, New Zealand and others preparing for the biggest tournament 
<br />on the globe and so must pick up points now. A great run could produce 10 points 
<br />in four matches, but that would need to start with a win today.What are the keys 
<br />to earning that victory James Riley - Riley is going to be tasked with shutting 
<br />down the Bobby Convey. Both here at Sounder at Heart and over at 
<br />CenterLineSoccer Riley and Convey have gotten attention. The reason is pretty

<br />target=_blank&gt;&lt;B&gt;adidas predator 2011&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/A&gt; the site went down.The GoodIn this 
<br />case, was a Sounders win. An amazing VIP party where I couldn't recognize people 
<br />because it was too dark counts as well. Talking soccer with a Norwich City fan 
<br />who at one point sounded off with &quot;Kat, he knows Darren Huckerby. He knows 
<br />Norwich City.&quot; For some reason phrases like that always sound better with an 
<br />accent.Plus, we soccer fans are in a small club.Also good were Fishbone and 
<br />Split Attraction.Fishbone gives a great live show. It is an interactive 
<br />experience. They entered the crowd on several occasions, singing and dancing 
<br />with the people who love them. I highly recommend them as a show. They include 
<br />you in the experience and their music just makes you happy. A 
<br />reggae/rap/ska/rock fusion band is always fun and Fishbone are amongst the 
<br />earliest of the style.Split Attraction played the Roxy even though they were 
<br />probably in high school they rocked. A great mix of clean four piece sound that 
<br />should be hitting the airwaves soon. So new as a band I couldn't find a website, 
<br />but honestly, they have the sound and enough pull that they got in the Roxy 
<br />during the Sunset Strip Music Festival.Shiny Toy Guns was recommended by my 
<br />wife, as well as my partner at work. They had some solid energy and a very 
<br />different sound then most at the Festival. In fact they and Fishbone probably 
<br />didn't fit except that they were from the area. This band is highly recommended. 
<br />Their cover of Major Tom is both well-known and well-done.Again, the list &lt;/P&gt;

<br />lots of thought into this avalanche of a feature, and every time this post 
<br />appears the theme to Perfect Strangers heroically plays. As always, please 
<br />remember to be as irrational as possible when interacting with your fellow TBL 
<br />commenters.1. The NBA Finals TSH — After Dwyane Wade posed in front of the 
<br />Dallas bench like a member of a boy band, there was &lt;A 
<br />href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.soccercleatsfactory.com%2F%26quot"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.soccercleatsfactory.com/&quot</a>; target=_blank&gt;&lt;B&gt;mercurial vapor 
<br />super&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/A&gt; absolutely no outcome more preferred than a satisfying Mavs 
<br />comeback capped by a dramatic Dirk Nowitzki game winner.CRM — I am in complete 
<br />shock over the Heat meltdown from last night. LeBron and Wade have to attack the 
<br />rim to close out games, not run down the clock and settle for desperation 
<br />heaves. Dirk was the best player on the court for the last 7 minutes of the 
<br />game. It was the first time Dirk was the best player on the court and the Mavs 
<br />rolled. I still think the Heat win this series, but I now believe the Mavs have 
<br />at least a chance.2. Farewell, Shaq TSH — Of all the things that happened 
<br />throughout Shaq's storied and quite lengthy career, the most stunning thing I 
<br />ever witnessed was Christian Laettner completely outplaying the Big Aristotle on 
<br />national television. I'd like to pretend that game never happened, and &lt;/P&gt;

<br />&lt;P style=&quot;TEXT-INDENT: 2em&quot;&gt;I'm sure Shaq would too, though there's no doubt his 
<br />collection of wonderfully shiny rings aid in easing the pain.CRM — Shaq has been 
<br />in the NBA since right around the time I started following the sport. He's been 
<br />semi-retired for a couple years now, but its still crazy that he's finally 
<br />walking/hobbling away. Rick Reilly would like to remind you that Shaq played in 
<br />three different decades. A year into the 2010?s, that really means something.3. 
<br />Farewell, Jim Tressel TSH — Part of me will miss this polarizing figure and his 
<br />signature sweater vest, and the other part doesn't really care. This dude smiled 
<br />less than Joe Torre, so hopefully he's spending his newfound free time like Tom 
<br />Brady and happily ‘weeeeeeeeeing' down water slides. &lt;A

<br />games Does Thorne even do hockey anymore His call on the Adam Jones catch was 
<br />phenomenal.CRM – Go Vancouver! Down with America USA Boston! 5. Winnipeg Has a

<br />EzraHendrickson When it was discovered today that Bobby Rhine passed 
<br />unexpectedly of a heart attack, it hit the greater MLS community fairly hard. 
<br />Rhine had played 10 years with Dallas and just recently entered the broadcasting 
<br />field as a rapidly rising star. Fans in Dallas are holding a memorial this 
<br />evening. His family is asking for donations made in his name to the FC Dallas 
<br />foundation.In a league with heavy player turnover it is rare for someone to 
<br />spend 10 seasons with one team, as Rhine did with the Dallas Burn/FC Dallas. On 
<br />the opposite end of that spectrum is Sounders Assistant Coach Ezra Hendickson 
<br />who played with 6 MLS and 3 lower league sides. Ezra only spent 2003 with the 
<br />Burn, but it was clear from talking to him today at practice that Rhine was able 
<br />to connect with people quickly and make an impression.&quot;He's a 35-year-old that 
<br />we all knew. It was very surprising to hear that [he passed]. I wish all the 
<br />best to his family. This is so very unfortunate.&quot;From his seasons with the 
<br />Hunts, he knows that they will do what they can to help Rhine's young family.&quot;I 
<br />know the Hunts. I played for them with two different teams, with Dallas and with 
<br />Columbus and I know they will do they best they can to make sure that everything 
<br />is in order.&quot;Hendrickson recognized that it will be difficult for the players 
<br />and coaches, as Rhine was so recently on the pitch and like most broadcasters 
<br />was at practice frequently.&quot;For the whole organization it will be like one of 
<br />the members of their family has passed .. It is never easy losing someone, who 
<br />is like a family member it must be really hard on them [the players]and for the 
<br />organization.&quot;Hendrickson ended the conversation with simple words, but there 
<br />are only so many that can be used in these circumstances. They recognize what is 
<br />now quite simply shock and sadness.&quot;It is very surprising. It is very hard to 
<br />suddenly lose &lt;/P&gt;
<br />&lt;P style=&quot;TEXT-INDENT: 2em&quot;&gt;someone like that.&quot;

<br />also in ways a homecoming for myself. While I did not travel, I have some Ohio 
<br />roots, but more importantly my MLS roots are with the Crew and Brian McBride. 
<br />During MLS 1.0 I followed Columbus on internet radio. I discovered the sport 
<br />through them playing at the Horseshoe of Ohio State University. My favorite MLS 
<br />memory was the opening of Crew Stadium, at least until Drew Carey walked into 
<br />the George &amp;amp; Dragon to &quot;pre-announce&quot; that Seattle would be joining the 
<br />league.So the Crew appeal to me in ways that no other team in the league ever 
<br />will.Currently the Crew control their destiny. Not only are they the likely team 
<br />for the Supporters Shield for second year, they must be favorites for the MLS 
<br />Cup, oh and they seem like they have a chance to come out of the Group stages of 
<br />the CCL. They, and Houston, are clearly the class of the league right &lt;A

<br />&lt;P style=&quot;TEXT-INDENT: 2em&quot;&gt;corners, 1 on a direct kick and another off of an 
<br />indirect. That is rather potent, Seattle only has only 5 goals on the Set.So 
<br />this isn't just a &quot;Seattle needs to score more&quot; statement, but a Seattle needs 
<br />to defend these better. I may even say that the outlet man should not be at the 
<br />center circle, but pulled back to about 25 yards. This puts them in position for 
<br />the short pass, or for the rebound. It offers just a touch of help so that the 
<br />Crew can't get a goal in these circumstances.Offensively, maybe Seattle should 
<br />shift their plan a bit. Have Riley take the kicks from the right side and Leo 
<br />from the left. Yes, those two are the safeties at this point hanging out in the 
<br />center circle with the oppositions &lt;A href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.hotsocceroutlet.com%2F%26quot"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.hotsocceroutlet.com/&quot</a>;

<br />method the other man in that would either be Brad Evans or Pete Vagenas - 
<br />whoever is on the pitch. This puts more offensive players into offensive 
<br />positions. Honestly, Seattle isn't going to win a header, so they might as well 
<br />have players that can score with their feet into the 18.Guillermo Barros 
<br />SchelottoYes, he's likley the best set-play man in the league. Even better than 
<br />the more famous DP with that modeling contract. Last year he was an assist 
<br />machine and won the MVP. This year he's been scoring, and could be the very rare 
<br />player that leads the league in assists one year and goals the next. Seattle 
<br />can't really defend him on the set though, so the key is to foul even less than 
<br />usual.Columbus runs a 4-4-1 with GBS having a floating role similar to Blanco. 
<br />He gets to go where he wants and when he wants to. A few months ago we would 
<br />have though that Alonso was the key to stopping him. Tonight I suggest something 
<br />different. Jhon Kennedy Hurtado has the footspeed on the positioning skills to 
<br />defend anyone in the league. He could mark GBS &lt;/P&gt;

<br />&lt;P style=&quot;TEXT-INDENT: 2em&quot;&gt;where ever he is. Deny the Argentine the ball. This 
<br />is truly a case of how one player can be the difference. Mark him tightly, 
<br />whether its Evans, Vagenas or Hurtado, GBS should never get the ball inside of 
<br />30 yards. That might still be too close...Statistically, GBS is the only player 
<br />(min 1000 minutes) on the Crew to have more than a .60 PP90. He's at a 1.54 with 
<br />Gaven and Ekpo at 0.51. Alejandro Moreno is at 0.54 as target forward.Intimate 
<br />KnowledgeSeattle has a small advantage here in that two coaches and the best 
<br />tactical player on the squad know the Crew better than you, I or maybe even 
<br />Robert Warzycha. More than almost any match this is a case of where the best 
<br />coach could and should win. On that charter plane that Seattle flew each player 
<br />should have been given video to review and study during the flight.But it isn't 
<br />just in the flight. There is so much opportunity to show the players how player 
<br />X prefers his left foot, or player Y hates to be pushed outside. The Seattle 
<br />players have to be their most coachable this week. No other opponent offers this 
<br />advantage like C-bus. Use it.NotesFriday's Galaxy v Fire match doesn't really 
<br />effect the Sounders chances. Either team is likely in the Playoffs already. I 
<br />guess you could hope for Fire win just so the Galaxy get knocked down a peg so 
<br />Seattle might sneak into the 2 seed in the West.Chivas @ DC and New England @ 
<br />Colorado though have huge impacts. Welcome to scoreboard watching. Ideally both

<br />&lt;P style=&quot;TEXT-INDENT: 2em&quot;&gt;about the helmets invention being testament to mans 
<br />stupidity: Why did we invent the helmet Well, because we were participating in 
<br />many activities that were cracking our heads. We looked at the situation. We 
<br />chose not to avoid these activities, but to just make little plastic hats so 
<br />that we can continue our head-cracking lifestyles. In football, that point may 
<br />be valid.Viewing American football compared to its progenitor, Rugby, and to its 
<br />cousins in other countries, you see two distinctions. First, American football 
<br />players wear a ton of padding and hard-shell helmets. Second, maximum impact 
<br />collisions are prevalent. The cousins are brutish. They have contact, but the 
<br />violence isnt reckless. Players dont become chiseled vectors hurtling into each 
<br />other at full speed. The two may be interrelated.If players were less protected, 
<br />they might take more measures to protect themselves. Joe Paterno has argued to 
<br />get rid of the face mask, because it encourages players to use their heads. Its 
<br />a weapon. Guys are fearless. Mike Ditka expressed similar sentiment two years 
<br />ago. If you want to change the game and get it back to where people arent 
<br />striking with the head and using the head as a weapon, take the mask off the 
<br />helmet.Removing the face mask would not be a panacea. It wouldnt solve the 
<br />trouble of sub-concussive blows, but it would be more of a deterrent than a 
<br />plausible fine.Legislating away the most egregious violence is a fruitless 
<br />errand. Football must change fundamentally to re-emphasize tackling and reduce 
<br />high-impact collisions. Players are being maimed and paralyzed. New revelations 
<br />about the brain trauma players are suffering is coming out weekly. Clearly, the 
<br />measures in place to protect those participating are inadequate.Eric LeGrands 
<br />injury was not a freak accident. It was a logical outcome of the game we 
<br />sanction. The sad fact is seeing a young kid paralyzed is not enough for us. It 
<br />will take a player dying on the field, in a high-profile game, to foreground 
<br />that point and inspire reform.[Photo &lt;/P&gt;

<br />because I'd already seen it.”There are many uncommitted players out there, and
