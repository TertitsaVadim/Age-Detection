<br /><br />A crushing void of emptiness fills the deepest abyss.
<br /><br />Searching for a sense of direction, a connection, the satisfaction found in recollection.
<br /><br />Discovery; completion, a wholeness brought by unity, the release, the peace, the stillness afforded by understanding.
<br /><br />Unquenchable thirst, infinite desire for reunion, my realisation of perfection, amplified, magnified by longing.

<br />My heart it called to thee
<br />With whispers of echoes of long gone times
<br />And when our love was free
<br />Divided now too long we've been
<br />And constant was our searching
<br />An age is gone since our faces seen
<br />But now are souls are pearching
<br />On the edge of impending bliss
<br />A reunion long in coming
<br />But when it does
<br />Our thrilling kiss will leave
<br />Our bodies humming.

<br />Teetering on the edge I knew it was inevitable
<br />I held on to everything but balance failed
<br />I failed, and so, I fell
<br />The never ending darkness
<br />Falling forever in to the abyss
<br />Crushing blackness surrounding me,
<br />Filling me, consuming me - then
<br />A pin prick
<br />Smaller even, but real
<br />The beginning of hope - I dared to wonder;
<br />not falling down but through?
<br />Yes, discernible glimmerings, I see them now
<br />They fight for purchase in the dark, finding it and
<br />Soon they are a beacon
<br />And I am getting closer, nearer to brightness
<br />Slowing
<br />Soon I am blinded, the terror comes again
<br />But as glare becomes glow,
<br />I see
<br />You; my love, my light and my salvation
<br />Calling me, guiding me home - again.

<br /><br />I have posted a couple of things, poems mainly, as part of the project13 thing, that is having it's very own website built as we speak.
<br /><br />I have been busy though. I got a boyfriend, moved to Cambridge, got a job(ish), got ill, got well(ish), saw the Buena Vista Social Club...
<br /><br />It's been a nuts couple of months if I'm honest, and I'm pretty tired and emotional about the whole thing. However, my birthday is fast approaching and I am planning a trip back up North to see the folks that matter, and its a busy time. I'm getting the GreenMeanie checked out this week so that I'm as safe as I can be driving up, not to mention trying to coordinate half a dozen different people so that I can try and see them all in the short time that I am going to have.
<br /><br />I love that people are excited to see me, I'm excited to see them too.  I just know that I'm going to speand the whole weekend in tears, good tears, but tears nonetheless. 
<br /><br />I have so much that I want to say but I'm not sure how to say it so I'm going to go away for a bit and post again later maybe...

Witness below a typical conversation between me and my allegedly 3 year old niece.  Names have been changed to protect the innocent.
<br /><br />Baby is using 2 of her new pencil crayons to drum on the table (as she has seen her drummer father do numerous times I'm sure)
<br /><br />Jo: Don't do that Baby, you'll break them.
<br />B: Why?
<br />Jo: Because the coloured bit is fragile and it will break if you bang it.
<br />B: Ok... Why?
<br />Jo: Erm, because it can't be any stonger than it is or you wouldn't be able to draw with it.
<br />B: Ok.  Why?
<br />Jo: (changing tack) Because your constant and incessant tapping is driving me insane.  How about we just draw with them instead and I'll see about getting you some drumsticks.
<br />[Baby's mother looks at me with horror]
<br /><br />So you see... in the hands of a philosopher 'Why?' can be the most liberating of questions to ask.  It allows the mind to roam free before it is confined to logic, and can prompt our finest minds into discoving the most amazing of things.
<br /><br />But... in the hands of a toddler it can be the atom bomb of manipulation.  I swear she knows that if she asks why for long enough someone will give up trying to explain and rationalise and give her a biscuit.
<br /><br />And so I ask... who is the greater mind?
<br /><br />You may have guessed I am way beyond tired and my mind is less than lucid this morning but it is my blog and I reserve the right to chat complete shite in it if I so choose.  So ner...

<br /><br />I've had an ongoing dispute with someone for quite a few years now about whether men want brains or beauty.  This all stems from a conversation with said person where the following statement was proffered:
<br />You're really quite pretty, and sometimes funny, but if you could just lose weight and smile more then men would like you better.
<br /><br />At this point I said - I'm sorry, what?
<br /><br />The reply came:
<br />Well, I know you're intelligent but men really don't want that, so you might want to act like you don't know things and giggle more, people will like you better that way.
<br /><br />I didn't speak to that person again for a while, I was fuming.  I have always prided myself on my ability to construct a reasonable and considered response to things like this, but I found myself at a loss.  Not only had my self esteem been attacked - I know I'm not as thin as I used to be but I don't need reminding at every available moment - but my intelligence and personal integrity had also come under attack, or at least my reluctance to compromise either.
<br /><br />So I ask... Should I play dumb, act stupid, simper and giggle and flirt and never challenge an egomaniacal misogynist, and spend the rest of my life with a man I want to stab to death whilst he's knocking out the zzz's or do I hang out for someone who appreciates me the way I am - often contrary, but ultimately kind, caring, genuine and loving?  Is there any point in pretending that I am anything other than the way I am in order to get a man, only to lose him at the first sign that I have more than three brain cells huddling together for warmth?

		<document id="ae19f498dbd325c966ab774c0d689704" url=""><![CDATA[I wish I was numb...<br/><br/>I hate today, in fact I'm going to loathe all this week, until next monday I reckon.  I'm not giong to share why with all and sundry, but I am going to use this space as a cathartic process that will allow me talk without having to listen to people trying to sympathise and make me feel better.  There are probably only 3 people on the planet that can do that, they know who they are and they are already doing their best.  
<br /><br />I wish I could feel numb.  Other years I have managed it, so why not this year.  I'm not sure if it's my refusal to get drunk off my box and go to work instead which is causing the ridiculous amounts of heartache or whether it's just that I'm tired and stressed out about other things in my life, so my reserves of 'holding my shit togetherness' are running out.  Either way, I've spent the last 2 days in floods of tears and have found it increasingly difficult not to crumble into a million pieces every time somebody says 'good morning, how are you today?'  I don't know if I would fare better if people were rude.  Maybe I could coast along on the waves of righteous indignation and ride out this week on the tide of anger that ebbs and flows as the level of bad manners and indifference rises and falls.
<br /><br />I feel like I am moments away from tears all the time, and the effort of holding them in is exhausting.  Unfortunately, I can't go blubbing on plies of invoices so I'm going have to stow it for another time.  I pity the person who is around when I finally let go of it all and just cry.  It will be a full blown session, tears and snot and gurning and sniffing and shaking uncontrollably and the lot.  There's a lot that I'm having to hold in right now, for the sake of those people around me who don't need to know and probably wouldn't care if they did.
<br /><br />It's a difficult time of year and no mistake.

<br /><br />It's a wierd time of year for me right now, what with all the reminders and everything, and I was thinking how our memories can play tricks on us.  How our emotions can be triggered by the strangest of things.  It's like, I don't think about my mum all the time, I couldn't, I'd be a basket case, but certain things make me remember her.  The smell of slightly overdone toast, certain songs on the radio, timberland boots.  I was thinking though, about other stuf, the house we lived in for my first 16 years, right up to when she died.  I was tring to remember the house, the details, trying to work out how much I could really remember.  I can almost see the kitchen, it's nearly there in my head, and the bathroom, that too, but I definately remember the stairs.  Green carpet, old bobbly wallpaper that we always said we'd replace, and honesty in a green bottle onthe windowsill.  Honesty isn't something you really see any more, and it's kind of hard to explain if you've never seen it.  But nevertheless it was there.  And it is what made me cry tonight.  Sitting here in the dark, remembering the little things, those things that are lost and gone for good, never to be seen again and one day, maybe soon to be forgotten.  
<br />I had to go through some boxes the other day, boxes of things I've not seen in years, with good reason too, I thought I'd dealt with a lot of things, but it has become obvoius to me over the past few weeks that I haven't.  I found a card that my friends at college sent me when my mum died.  I'm ashamed and horrified at myself that I can't reember a single one of those people.  I just don't remember them.  I wouldn't know them if I fell over them in the street.  Those people, those souls that I have so easily dismissed from my memory.  I'm disgusted that I can forget them.  
<br />I cried too, because I found a card that had my mum's handwriting in it.  I cried not because I had forgotten it, but because I remembered it, and that because sometimes, I write like her.  Without even thinking about it.
<br /><br />I'm rambling now, I'm going away, but I don't think I'll stop feeling sad for a while.  Not unless something happens to take my mind off things.  I'm dwelling at the moment, and I don't seem to be able to stop.  Must snap out of it.  Stiff upper lip and all that.  I'm sick of not being able to not cry when somebody asks me am I ok, it's embarrasing!!

It's making me feel sick. I‚Äôm holding it all down for the sake of work. It's making me dizzy. I wasn't even this bad on Monday, and you would think I'd be worse on the day she died, rather than her birthday. 
<br /><br />It's so frustrating having to fight to keep a lid on it. I just want to run to the bathrooms and sob but I don't want to have to explain.
<br />I'm sat here, trapped in an office, being forced to listen to the radio. Every 20 minutes or so there is a five minute ad break packed tight with adverts for restaurants, gifts, cards, events for mothers day. 
<br />The people at work won't shut up about it. Every two seconds... oh how tedious and effortful it will be to have to go and buy gifts and presents for their mothers. I'm having to work exhaustibly hard to not get up and smack someone. I've gone past being sad. Now I feel sick with anger that people begrudge that little bit of effort that commercialism demands. Like its too much of a bother. At least they have a mother. How dare they complain at having to honour her presence, their very existence is down to her. How dare they be so complacent. I miss her more today than I did on Monday. I'm going nuts here, I really do feel like I'm going to snap horribly at someone. It won't be their fault, they don't know about my past, they are not doing it deliberately. Oh‚Ä¶ but how it hurts.
<br />I don‚Äôt think I can take much more of this.  I have to keep disappearing off places to get away from the radio.  It‚Äôs not just the adverts, it‚Äôs the songs, it‚Äôs the music itself.  Everything is a stark reminder of how she‚Äôs not here and just how much I miss her.

		<document id="6a96c20ad0794076ecb4818c4b805c19" url=""><![CDATA[Emotional overload...<br/><br/>I knew there were a good many reasons that I shut myself off from things.  Now I wonder if I should have left myself that way.  When you open yourself to one thing, all the other things that have been patiently waiting in the wings sneak in and tear you to shreds.
<br />I try to be compassionate.   I care about people and how they feel.  I had to learn the hard way that people often do not extend the same courtesy.
<br />I know that I can't fix everything, and that there is little I can personally do about the state of the planet and humanity.  It is to this end that I stopped watching the news.  I had trained myself to be able to sit in a room with the news on and not have the pain and anguish on the screen affect me too badly.  Recently, those walls, those carefully constructed layers of emotional defence had been chipped away at, and now it seems I have been left open, standing alone, to face all the pain and gut wrenching sorrow all over again. 
<br />I've cried today already.  Not for myself, and the very personal pain I have been experiencing recently, but the pain of others.  Over the weekend, 9 teenagers have had their lives snatched from them.  9 families destroyed by anger and rage.  The pain and suffering caused by those acts is exponential.  The ripples of anguish spreading out across lives like someone dropping a pebble in a lake, affecting not just the surface, but what lies beneath.  The NSPCC have come under fire for what is being described as a controversial advertising campaign.  They published a leaflet that looked like a baby names book, but inside were the names of babies and children who had been murdered and abused by their parents.  On one hand, it is an emotive and possibly inappropriate method of asking people to donate to their cause.  On the other, a stark and harsh reality thrust into the limelight in a way that cannot be ignored.  Children deserve our protection.  We have the ability to shape a life, to nurture a soul to fruition, to lead by example and show the next generation of human beings the way, to allow them to become all they can be and more, for the benefit of everyone.  Yet we do not.  We have neglected our youth.  We are becoming indifferent to their suffering.  We are allowing them to be forgotten.  We give children with Asperger‚Äôs Syndrome ASBO‚Äôs because we are too caught up to listen to them, to find out how they feel, to look deeper into their behaviour and understand them.  We have written off scores of children as ‚Äònaughty‚Äô.   They deserve better.  Personal experience has taught me that children and young adults branded as uncontrollable and unresponsive have simply been approached in the wrong way, their subtle signals ignored, their behaviours dismissed as trouble making as disruption, rather than a sign that they are becoming disheartened and disengaged because nobody is listening to them.
<br />We are failing, in so many ways.  We no longer look for the beauty in people.  We do not see the wonder of their existence.  We expect the worst and are not disappointed.  We take no joys from the little things, we have forgotten our manners, we have neglected our duty to act like decent human beings and we blame everyone but ourselves.  
<br />Some might say that I think too much, that I worry and let things get to me, but I would rather that than become indifferent.  When watching the news makes me feel physically sick, when sitting in a lecture about child protection, I have to politely excuse myself and sit in the bathroom for half an hour until the nausea and tears subside, on seeing a child otherwise dismissed as a nightmare produce the most beautiful piece of written work I think I have ever seen, I have to hold back the tears ‚Äì does this make me over emotional, or just connected to an emotional level that other people choose to ignore because to let it in would be more than they could take.
<br />I have issues with controlling this connection, I have to find the balance where I can make it through a day without letting the swirl of a cloud or the sun on a leaf move me so much I can‚Äôt breathe, but I can‚Äôt help wondering if the world would be a nicer place to live if just for a while a few others were so moved.

It continues.  I've just heard on the radio that 2 teenagers gave a toddler an hand gun to play with and then laughed and recorded on their mobile phone as she put it in her mouth and pretended to pull the trigger.  Thank the stars that the thing wasn't loaded.  I feel sick. In fact I think I'm going to be sick.  My heart is breaking for the young lives that think that this kind of thing is funny, something to be laughed at and joked around with.  What are we doing?  How has it come to this?  I'm physically shaking at the thought of what could have happened to that poor innocent soul.  
<br />Where are her parents?
<br />Who left her in the care of other children?
<br />Where on earth did they get a hand gun from in the first place?
<br />What on earth has this toddler been exposed to that might have encouraged her, planted the idea to place a gun in her mouth?
<br /><br />Oh, I feel like my soul is screaming. I don't belong here.  I don't understand.  Why, how can something like this be allowed to happen.  We are failing.  All of us.  There is no excuse.

<br />The Vagina Monologues
<br />Waiting for Godot
<br />Habeus Corpus
<br />Cigarettes and Chocolate
<br />The Vets Review 2004
<br />The list goes on but I've forgotten the rest!!  I enjoyed myself on every single one, despite the last minute demands of directors and the unfortunate need for actors :O)
<br /><br />And so I ask... what is your favourite theatre production and why?  Other techies here feel free to share anecdotes.  If you've never been to the theatre, do you have a favourite film version...

<br /><br />Sadly, my reasons are not exciting, thrilling or in any way debauched.  
<br /><br />Staying up all night talking on the phone, chatting on the intenet or entertaining company face to face is often a highly pleasurable way to spend a sleepless night.  However, when the reason for your forced insomnia is a cat that doesn't shut up with her incessant scratching, crying, headbutting of the door, and general noisiness, then the ensuing mild confusion and general inability to muster the enthusiam to move is not so gladly welcomed.
<br /><br />If a repeat performance occurs this evening, she may find herself more usefully employed as an attractive hat.
<br /><br />Grrrr

<br /><br />I don't own it either, which is silly, I shall make it a thing to do - note to self: when less skint, buy Chocolat on DVD <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />If you've not seen it, I can recommend it.  Ooh that's just given me an idea for another blog, but not right now <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" />

<br /><br />It's been ages since I've felt this happy, if in fact I ever have been this happy at all, and so, in honour of my new found skippyness, I declare today 'Lurved up to the point of manic stupidity day'.  Anyone who wants to come and celebrate with me is more than welcome.  Anyone who doesn't feel free to bitch - I shall simply wish you luck, and hopr that you too find someone to smile away your lonley bitterness with :O)
<br /><br />Ciao for now!

<br /><br />I tend to take the rough with the smooth, ride the waves, take the knocks and come out ok the other end, but just lately I can't help feeling that I've been life swapped with someone far luckier than me.
<br />Those of you who know me will know that I haven't had the easiest of decades thus far, but things seem to be taking slight upturn.  My job still sucks, and I am poor as a dandelion picker in december but I am blissfully in love with a beautiful man and he seems (for some reason) to love me back, which as far as I can tell is way beyond excellent.
<br />I have been skipping around like a first class nutter since the weekend when an unexpected and amazing act of random kindness allowed us to be together for 3 wonderful nights.
<br />Anyone who sniffs, scoffs or otherwise belittles internet romances beware, you shall find no comfort here.
<br /><br />So I shall say thank you pan.netfka facebox - you brought us together.  Its not quite time to go picking out your hat, but as far as star crossed lovers are concerned, you played a blinder this time and you should be majorly chuffed and filled with smugness at your matchmaking ability <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" />
