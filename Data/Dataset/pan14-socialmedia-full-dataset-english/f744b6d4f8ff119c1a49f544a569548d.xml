Such is the case with &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.uggisboots.com.au%2F%26quot%3B%26gt%3BUgg"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.uggisboots.com.au/&quot;&gt;Ugg</a> boots&lt;/a&gt;, which have been a popular style of boots for over a decade now. Though there origins are in dispute, we do know that they were developed in either Australia or New Zealand. In fact, manufactures of Ugg-style boots from both countries were embroiled in bitter disputes with an American company that owned the trademark to the name Ugg. The locals claimed that &quot;Ugg&quot; was a generic term and therefore was ineligible for trademark protection. Who was right? Let us take a moment to examine the puzzling history of &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.uggisboots.com.au%2F%26quot%3B%26gt%3BUggs%26lt%3B%2Fa%26gt%3B"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.uggisboots.com.au/&quot;&gt;Uggs&lt;/a&gt;</a>. 
<br /><br />If you want to trace the history of anything, it is often best to start with its etymology. What are the origins of the word Ugg? While some surmise that it is simply a shorter, catchier way to say ugly, there is ample evidence that Ugg boots were once called fug boots. Worn by aviators during the First World War, flyboys called them &quot;flying Ugg boots,&quot; or &quot;uggs,&quot; for short.
<br /><br />While the exact origins are in doubt, we do know the name of the man who was responsible for taking Uggs global. In 1979, Brian Smith established Ugg Holdings, Inc. in the United States. The former Australian surfer had been using Uggs for years, as they were a popular form of footwear with surfers Down Under. &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fblog.ebizer.org%2F%26quot%3B%26gt%3BB2C%26lt%3B%2Fa%26gt"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://blog.ebizer.org/&quot;&gt;B2C&lt;/a&gt</a>; | &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fblog.ebizer.org%2F%26quot%3B%26gt%3BB2B2C%26lt%3B%2Fa%26gt"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://blog.ebizer.org/&quot;&gt;B2B2C&lt;/a&gt</a>;

The 100% merino sheepskin &lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;ugg boots&lt;/a&gt; were once considered by native people as &quot;ug&quot;, short for &quot;ugly&quot; for nearly 200 years. Till 1970s, there were several sheepskin boot manufacturing plants gathering around the Australia city of Perth.
<br /><br />As there were popular surfing beaches near this city, these &lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;uggs&lt;/a&gt; were favored by surfers there for year-round use. Because the insulating prosperities of merino fleece keep feet warm in winter and cool in winter, the ugg boots provided sock-like comfort while walking over the rough or slipperier terrain. 
<br /><br />In the present, the ugg way that once considered being dowdy because of its bulk and shape is reviewed as sexy and fashionable. The ugg boots become a household name across the globe. But since the Australia sheepskin boot had lost the right to use the name of ugg, there is a huge loss to them. 
<br /><br />Yet it seems that the public is more concerned on the availability and selection of additional, authentic ugg Australia products. Although today the uggs still have a great share in the market, many native Australia boot companies have been raised to fight with ugg. The competition can never be ignored. But the ugg way is always on the trend.  &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fblog.ebizer.org%2F%26quot%3B%26gt%3BB2C%26lt%3B%2Fa%26gt"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://blog.ebizer.org/&quot;&gt;B2C&lt;/a&gt</a>; | &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fblog.ebizer.org%2F%26quot%3B%26gt%3BB2B2C%26lt%3B%2Fa%26gt"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://blog.ebizer.org/&quot;&gt;B2B2C&lt;/a&gt</a>;

I have always been an admirer of more sleek classic lines in both footwear and clothing. 
<br /><br />I attended a charity event in New York City called the posh sale. If you are a New Yorker you are probably familiar with this fantastic sale. One of my purchases at this event was a pair of classic short Uggs pink. I was still not sold on the look of the &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.uggisboots.com.au%2F%26quot%3B%26gt%3Buggs%26lt%3B%2Fa%26gt%3B"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.uggisboots.com.au/&quot;&gt;uggs&lt;/a&gt;</a>, but I was curious. My thinking at the time was &quot;this charity is for a good cause and I can always just wear them to walk my dog.&quot; 
<br /><br />My attitude changed after slipping on these rather odd ice cream colored ugg boots. The merino sheepskin and supple suede were not only soft, but incredibly light weight. These were definitely the most comfortable shoes I had ever worn. I quickly found that I could walk the streets of New York for hours in complete comfort. No more hailing a taxi because my shoes were hurting my feet. 
<br /><br />Finally the world's obsession with uggs made sense to me. I soon found that Ugg Australia offered an extensive line of boots and shoes. I quickly became enamored with the quirky Ugg names such as UGG classic short boots. &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fblog.ebizer.org%2F%26quot%3B%26gt%3BB2C%26lt%3B%2Fa%26gt"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://blog.ebizer.org/&quot;&gt;B2C&lt;/a&gt</a>; | &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fblog.ebizer.org%2F%26quot%3B%26gt%3BB2B2C%26lt%3B%2Fa%26gt"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://blog.ebizer.org/&quot;&gt;B2B2C&lt;/a&gt</a>;
