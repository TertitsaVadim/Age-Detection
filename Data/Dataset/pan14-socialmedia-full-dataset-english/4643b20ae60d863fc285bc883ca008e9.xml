<br /><br />I know way too many really beautiful girls who think they don't look good... It hurts... because it's our fault, guys I mean. We make girls feel like they have to be perfect. You know what I mean, flat stomach, big boobs, round booty, long legs, sexy lips, and on top of all that, they have to dress like a whore, and be one as well... nobody can measure up to that... and its not fair... because nobody should have to. Girls prefer being called beautiful instead of hott or sexy. The little imperfections are what make people special. If everyone was perfect the world would be so boring, variety is what makes life interesting. So guys, stop making girls have to live up to your, I'm sorry, our... deluded fantasy visions of perfection. Stop acting like boys and start being men... realize that women don't exist to fulfill our sexual desires. Stop talking to them solely to get with them, be nice to them because you want to be their friend, not because you want to hook up with them. Say nice things about them not to flatter them in hopes that you'll get some, but because its true and you know they like to hear them. In short... we need to grow up and stop acting like freaking retarded little boys.

<br /><br />I am only 8 inches long
<br /><br />but I have all my organs.
<br /><br />I love the sound of your voice.
<br /><br />Every time I hear it
<br /><br />I wave my arms and legs.
<br /><br />The sound of your heart beat
<br /><br />is my favorite lullaby.
<br /><br />Month Two
<br /><br />Mommy
<br /><br />today I learned how to suck my thumb.
<br /><br />If you could see me
<br /><br />you could definitely tell that I am a baby.
<br /><br />I'm not big enough to survive outside my home though.
<br /><br />It is so nice and warm in here.
<br /><br />Month Three
<br /><br />You know what Mommy
<br /><br />I'm a boy!!
<br /><br />I hope that makes you happy.
<br /><br />I always want you to be happy.
<br /><br />I don't like it when you cry.
<br /><br />You sound so sad.
<br /><br />It makes me sad too
<br /><br />and I cry with you even though
<br /><br />you can't hear me.
<br /><br />Month Four
<br /><br />Mommy
<br /><br />my hair is starting to grow.
<br /><br />It is very short and fine
<br /><br />but I will have a lot of it.
<br /><br />I spend a lot of my time exercising.
<br /><br />I can turn my head and curl my fingers and toes
<br /><br />and stretch my arms and legs.
<br /><br />I am becoming quite good at it too.
<br /><br />Month Five
<br /><br />You went to the doctor today.
<br /><br />Mommy, he lied to you.
<br /><br />He said that I'm not a baby.
<br /><br />I am a baby Mommy, your baby.
<br /><br />I think and feel.
<br /><br />Mommy, what's abortion?
<br /><br />Month Six
<br /><br />I can hear that doctor again.
<br /><br />I don't like him.
<br /><br />He seems cold and heartless.
<br /><br />Something is intruding my home.
<br /><br />The doctor called it a needle.
<br /><br />Mommy what is it? It burns!
<br /><br />Please make him stop!
<br /><br />I can't get away from it!
<br /><br />Mommy! HELP me!
<br /><br />Month Seven
<br /><br />Mommy
<br /><br />I am okay.
<br /><br />I am in Jesus's arms.
<br /><br />He is holding me.
<br /><br />He told me about abortion.
<br /><br />Why didn't you want me Mommy?
<br /><br />Every Abortion Is Just . . .
<br /><br />One more heart that was stopped.
<br /><br />Two more eyes that will never see.
<br /><br />Two more hands that will never touch.
<br /><br />Two more legs that will never run.
<br /><br />One more mouth that will never speak.

<br />sick one day.  Having an urgent problem with one of the main computers, 
<br />he dialed the employee's home phone number and was greeted with a 
<br />child's whisper. 
<br /><br />&quot;Hello.&quot; 
<br /><br />&quot;Is your daddy home?&quot; he asked. 
<br /><br />&quot;Yes,&quot; whispered the small voice. 
<br /><br />May I talk with him?&quot; 
<br /><br />The child whispered, &quot;No.&quot; 
<br /><br />Surprised and wanting to talk with an adult, the boss asked, 
<br />&quot;Is your Mommy there?&quot; 
<br /><br />&quot;Yes.&quot; 
<br /><br />&quot;May I talk with her?&quot; 
<br /><br />Again the small voice whispered, &quot;No.&quot; 
<br /><br />Hoping there was somebody with whom he could leave a message, the boss 
<br />asked, &quot;Is anybody else there?&quot; 
<br /><br />&quot;Yes,&quot; whispered the child, &quot;a policeman&quot; 
<br /><br />Wondering what a cop would be doing at his employee's home, the boss 
<br />asked, 
<br />&quot;May I speak with the policeman?&quot; 
<br /><br />&quot;No, he's busy&quot;, whispered the child. 
<br /><br />&quot;Busy doing what?&quot; 
<br /><br />&quot;Talking to Daddy and Mommy and the Fireman,&quot; came the whispered answer. 
<br />Growing more worried as he heard what sounded like a helicopter through 
<br />the earpiece on the phone, the boss asked, &quot;What is that noise?&quot; 
<br /><br />&quot;A helicopter&quot; answered the whispering voice. 
<br /><br />&quot;What is going on there?&quot; demanded the boss, now truly apprehensive. 
<br /><br />Again, whispering, the child answered, &quot;The search team just landed the 
<br />helicopter.&quot; 
<br /><br />Alarmed, concerned and a little frustrated the boss asked, &quot;What are 
<br />they searching for?&quot; 
<br /><br />Still whispering, the young voice replied with a muffled giggle: 
<br /><br />&quot;ME.&quot;

<br />cussing.&quot; 
<br />The 4 year old nods his head in approval. The 6 year old continues, &quot;When we go downstairs for breakfast, I'm gonna say something with hell and you say something with ass.&quot; The 4 year old agrees with enthusiasm. 
<br />When the mother walks into the kitchen and asks the 6 year old what he wants for breakfast, he replies, &quot;Aw, hell Mom, I guess I'll have some 
<br />Cheerios.&quot; 
<br />WHACK! 
<br /><br />He flies out of his chair, tumbles across the kitchen floor, gets up, and runs upstairs crying his eyes out, with his mother in hot pursuit, slapping his rear with every step. His Mom locks him in his room and shouts, &quot;You can stay there until I let you out!&quot; 
<br />She then comes back downstairs, looks at the 4 year old and asks with a stern voice, &quot;And what do YOU want for breakfast, young man?&quot; 
<br />&quot;I don't know,&quot; he blubbers, &quot;but you can bet your fat ass it won't be 
<br />Cheerios.&quot;

<br /><br />This was written by a guy... it's pretty smart.
<br /><br />I never quite figured out why the sexual urge of men and
<br />women differ so much. And I never have figured out the whole Venus and
<br />Mars thing.
<br /><br />I have never figured out why men think with their head and
<br />women with their heart.
<br /><br />FOR EXAMPLE:
<br /><br />One evening! Last week, my girlfriend and I were getting into
<br />bed.
<br />Well, the passion starts to heat up, and she eventually says,
<br />&quot;I don't feel like it, I just want you to hold me.&quot;
<br /><br />I said, &quot;WHAT??!! What was that?!&quot;
<br /><br />So she says the words that every boyfriend on the
<br />planet dreads to hear...
<br /><br />&quot;You're just not in touch with my emotional needs as a woman
<br />enough fo me to satisfy your physical needs as a man.&quot;
<br /><br />She responded to my puzzled look by saying, &quot;Can't you just
<br />love me for who I am and not what I do for you in the bedroom?&quot;
<br /><br />Realizing that nothing was going to happen that night, I went
<br />to sleep.
<br /><br />The very next day I opted to take the day off of work to
<br />spend time with her.
<br /><br />We went out to a nice lunch and then went shopping at a
<br />big unnamed department store. I walked around with her while
<br />she tried on several different very expensive outfits. She couldn't
<br />decide which one to take, so I told her we'd just buy them all. She wanted
<br />new shoes to compliment her new clothes, so I said, &quot;Lets get a pair
<br />for each outfit.&quot;
<br /><br />We went on to the jewelry department where she picked out a
<br />pair of diamond earrings. Let me tell you... she was so excited. She
<br />must have thought I was one wave short of a shipwreck. I started to
<br />think she was testing me because she asked for a tennis bracelet when she
<br />doesn't even know how to play tennis.
<br /><br />I think I threw her for a loop when I said, &quot;That's fine,
<br />honey.&quot; She was almost nearing sexual satisfaction from all of the
<br />excitement.
<br /><br />Smiling with excited anticipation, she finally said, &quot;I think
<br />this is all dear, let's go to the cashier.&quot;
<br /><br />I could hardly contain myself when I blurted out, &quot;No, honey,
<br />I don't feel like it.&quot;
<br /><br />Her face just went completely blank as her jaw dropped with a
<br />baffled, &quot;WHAT?&quot;
<br /><br />I then said, &quot;Honey! I just want you to HOLD this stuff for a
<br />while. You're just not In touch with my financial needs as a man
<br />enough for me to satisfy your shopping needs as a woman.&quot;
<br /><br />And just when she had this look like she was going to kill
<br />me, I added,&quot; Why can't you just love me for who I am and not for the
<br />things I buy you?&quot;
<br /><br />Apparently I'm not having sex tonight either....but at least
<br />that bitch knows I'm smarter than her!
<br /><br />All right girls. Forward this on if you agree. Hell even if
<br />you disagree, forward it on.
<br /><br />Men, forward this on, because you have balls.

<br /><br />1- First Important Lesson - Cleaning Lady. 
<br /><br />During my second month of college, our professor 
<br />gave us a pop quiz. I was a conscientious student 
<br />and had breezed through the questions until I read 
<br />the last one: 
<br /><br />&quot;What is the first 
<br />name of the woman who cleans the school?&quot; 
<br /><br />Surely this was some kind of joke. I had seen the 
<br />cleaning woman several times. She was tall, 
<br />dark-haired and in her 50's, but how would I know her name? 
<br /><br />I handed in my paper, leaving the last question 
<br />blank. Just before class ended, one student asked if 
<br />the last question would count toward our quiz grade. 
<br /><br />&quot;Absolutely, &quot; said the professor. &quot;In your careers, 
<br />you will meet many people. All are significant. They 
<br />deserve your attention and care, even if all you do is 
<br />smile and say &quot;hello.&quot; 
<br /><br />I've never forgotten that lesson. I also learned her 
<br />name was Dorothy. 
<br /><br />2- Second Important Lesson - Pickup in the Rain 
<br /><br />One night, at 11:30 p.m., an older African American 
<br />woman was standing on the side of an Alabamahighway 
<br />trying to endure a lashing rain storm. Her car had 
<br />broken down and she desperately needed a ride. 
<br /><br />Soaking wet, she decided to flag down the next car. 
<br />A young white man stopped to help her, generally 
<br />unheard of in those conflict-filled 1960's. The man 
<br />took her to safety, helped her get assistance and put her into a 
<br />taxicab. 
<br /><br />She seemed to be in a big hurry, but wrote down his 
<br />address and thanked him. Seven days went by and a 
<br />knock came on the man's door. To his surprise, a 
<br />giant console color TV was delivered to his home. A 
<br />special note was attached. 
<br /><br />It read: 
<br />&quot;Thank you so much for assisting me on the highway 
<br />the other night. The rain drenched not only my 
<br />clothes, but also my spirits. Then you came along. 
<br />Because of you, I was able to make it to my dying 
<br />husband's bedside just before he passed away... God 
<br />bless you for helping me and unselfishly serving 
<br />others.&quot; 
<br /><br />Sincerely, 
<br />Mrs. Nat King Cole. 
<br /><br />3- Third Important Lesson - Always remember those 
<br />who serve. 
<br /><br />In the days when an ice cream sundae cost much less, 
<br />a 10-year-old boy entered a hotel coffee shop and 
<br />sat at a table. A waitress put a glass of water in 
<br />front of him. 
<br /><br />&quot;How much is an ice cream sundae?&quot; he asked. 
<br />&quot;Fifty cents,&quot; replied the waitress. 
<br /><br />The little boy pulled is hand out of his pocket and 
<br />studied the coins in it. 
<br /><br />&quot;Well, how much is a plain dish of ice cream?&quot; he inquired. 
<br /><br />By now more people were waiting for a table and the 
<br />waitress was growing impatient. 
<br /><br />&quot;Thirty-five cents,&quot; she brusquely replied. 
<br /><br />The little boy again counted his coins. 
<br /><br />&quot;I'll have the plain ice cream,&quot; he said. 
<br /><br />The waitress brought the ice cream, put the bill on 
<br />the table and walked away The boy finished the ice 
<br />cream, paid the cashier and left. When the waitress 
<br />came back, she began to cry as she wiped down the 
<br />table. There, placed neatly beside the empty dish, 
<br />were two nickels and five pennies.. 
<br /><br />You see, he couldn't have the sundae, because he had 
<br />to have enough left to leave her a tip. 
<br /><br />4- Fourth Important Lesson. - The obstacle in Our Path. 
<br /><br />In ancient times, a King had a boulder placed on a 
<br />roadway. Then he hid himself and watched to see if 
<br />anyone would remove the huge rock. Some of the 
<br />king's wealthiest merchants and courtiers came by 
<br />and simply walked around it. Many loudly blamed the 
<br />King for not keeping the roads clear, but none did 
<br />anything about getting the stone out of the way. 
<br /><br />Then a peasant came along carrying a load of 
<br />vegetables. Upon approaching the boulder, the 
<br />peasant laid down his burden and tried to move the 
<br />stone to the side of the road. After much pushing 
<br />and straining, he finally succeeded. After the 
<br />peasant picked up his load of vegetables, he noticed 
<br />a purse lying in the road where the boulder had 
<br />been. The purse contained many gold coins and a note 
<br />from the King indicating that the gold was for the 
<br />person who removed the boulder from the roadway. The

<br /><br />Every obstacle presents an opportunity to improve 
<br />our condition. 
<br /><br />5- Fifth Important Lesson - Giving When it Counts... 
<br /><br />Many years ago, when I worked as a volunteer at a 
<br />hospital, I got to know a little girl named Liz who 
<br />was suffering from a rare &amp; serious disease. Her only 
<br />chance of recovery appeared to be a blood 
<br />transfusion from her 5-year old brother, who had 
<br />miraculously survived the same disease and had 
<br />developed the antibodies needed to combat the 
<br />illness. The doctor explained the situation to her 
<br />little brother, and asked the little boy if he would 
<br />be willing to give his blood to his sister. 
<br /><br />I saw him hesitate for only a moment before taking a 
<br />deep breath and saying, &quot;Yes I'll do it if it will save 
<br />her.&quot; As the transfusion progressed, he lay in bed 
<br />next to his sister and smiled, as we all did, seeing 
<br />the color returning to her cheek. Then his face 
<br />grew pale and his smile faded. 
<br /><br />He looked up at the doctor and asked with a 
<br />trembling voice, &quot;Will I start to die right away&quot;. 
<br /><br />Being young, the little boy had misunderstood the 
<br />doctor; he thought he was going to have to give his 
<br />sister all of his blood in order to save her. 
<br /><br />Most importantly.................. 
<br />&quot;Work like you don't need the money, love like 
<br />you've never been hurt, and 
<br />dance like you do when nobody's watching.&quot;

<br />Put him twelve thousand miles from home.
<br />Empty his heart of all but blood,
<br />Make him live in sand, in mud.
<br />This is the life I have to live,
<br />This the soul to God I give.
<br />You have your parties and drink your beer,
<br />While young men are dying over here.
<br />Play your poilitics and have your fun,
<br />Then refuse to use a gun.
<br />There's nothing else for you to do,
<br />Then I'm supposed to die for you?
<br />There is one thing that you should know;
<br />And that's where I think you should go!
<br />I'm already here and it's too late.
<br />I've traded all my love for all this hate.
<br />I'll hate you till the day I die.
<br />You made me hear my buddy cry.
<br />I saw his leg and his blood shed,
<br />Then I heard them say, &quot;This one's dead&quot;.
<br />It was a large price for him to pay,
<br />To let you live another day.
<br />He had the guts to fight and die,
<br />To keep the freedom you live by.
<br />By his dying, your life he buys,
<br />But who cares if a soldier dies!
