<br />Ahoy, I’ve written quite a bit so far on my various voyages and the many things I’ve learned. I’ve tried my hand at various jobs, gone exploring for treasure, battled pirates, and engaged in trade. During my turn building ships and preparing to make for the New World, I’ve also dabbled in the diverse experience that is crafting. One of the more expansive systems to be involved in there are several avenues of getting your hands dirty and making items for your own benefit or for sale to others. Taking a cue from what I’ve seen other voyagers accomplish and my own experimenting, I found that crafting can be rewarding not only in building items I might otherwise have to search town after town for. Crafting is also a lucrative way to make some money while I’m in port on shore leave.
<br /><br />To begin with there are several forms of crafting, from simple food production to the making of weapons, clothing, cannons, figureheads, and of course general items. While in the beginning, the items might not be noteworthy or really profitable. With persistence and determination, you can achieve levels of skill to begin making some decent and eventually really good gear. Even at the start, making food might not be profitable, it certainly helps to keep your Vigour replenished so you can continue to craft and level your crafting skills.
<br /><br />Crafting is broken down into the following skills, each having their own required materials, trade goods, and recipes. They are Cooking, Storage, Sewing, Casting, Handicrafts, and Alchemy. Cooking as I mentioned is all about making food, which as your level grows and you gain more advanced recipes, the amount of Vigour restored by consuming the food increases. Cooking is pretty straight forward, as you gain the ingredients by purchasing them from various towns and obtain recipes you can really start making some quality food that is both useful but also profitable when sold compared to the pricing in the Taverns. Storage is somewhat related to this as it converts fish into storage food which is handy to have on hand. Storage also lowers the chances of having items stolen should you lose a battle or the loss of durability on inactive items in your inventory.
<br /><br />Sewing, of course is the production of clothing, ranging from the early hats, tops, bottoms, shoes and so on, but also sewing is useful with the right recipes to craft new sail equipment. Building the right sails which are then added to your ship can increase the speed and turning performance, again at a lower cost than buying them directly as the ship yard. You can eventually make special clothing or sail attachments that might night not otherwise find in stores through obtained levels and recipes.
<br /><br /><span class="textAlign textAlignCenter"><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/138564553_11061521_46378157.jpg" /></span>
<br /><br /><span class="textAlign textAlignCenter"><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/138564553_9417441_46378160.jpg" /></span>
<br /><br /><span class="textAlign textAlignCenter"><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/138564553_11632031_46378171.jpg" /></span>
<br /><br />Likewise, Casting is all about the crafting of weapons, such as swords, guns, throwing knives and so on. But also the crafting of cannons, which as you progress allows you to make better and better weapons and cannons, and for cannons, larger sets of one type or another. Really good Casters are always in demand as they might be producing weapons or cannons that are not readily available for some players, which can in turn generate some good money for the Casters. Casting also produces stern-castles and other combat related ship parts.
<br /><br />Handicrafts, is more of a utility type of crafting, creating things ranging from items like deck brushes, to figureheads for your ships, furniture for your residence, and as a Handicrafter grows, they can discover new and interesting avenues of creation, such as Gem cutting and more. There are several possible uses for a Handicrafter and while they may not overly profitable, there is still money to be made.
<br /><br />Lastly is Alchemy, which is a more complex type of crafting in which special and rare equipment is produced. While Alchemy is a lucrative skill to pursue, it is by no means an easy one and is not a beginning skill to be sought after as it is suited for higher level voyagers and not available until later levels of both skills and job category.
<br /><br />All in all there is much to be made and an enterprising crafter can find new and interesting items and gear to create, plan out routes to obtain the required items and always be on the look out for recipes that will bring in even bigger and better crafting options. I’ve found if I am going to actively pursue crafting I may continue to focus on casting or sewing as equipment will be much more important and expensive later on in levels.

		<document id="c3b2602d9c1cddca4f23415cbc811852" url=""><![CDATA[Guide to a Spanish Trader<br/><br/><em>So you want to play UWO here is a guide to help you begin your adventures as a trader. its very important to have money early in this game so you can spend it later if your doing adventuring you wont be spending much but doing battle can be very costly. a typical Spanish trader can make his own cannons and armor so its very ideal to start as a trader.</em>
<br /><br /><strong>A path to Money Trader</strong>
<br /><br />As explained in the current Spanish situation in the world, we have advantages for cannon casting, firearm and gold trading.
<br /><br />Political merchant favors all those skills (precious metal trading, casting firearm trading) but doesn't favor account and the lvl requirement is high. So, at this step we will aim for money trader class that favors metal trading and casting which is enough for us to start making gold bars in Habana.
<br /><br />This is just one way of playing UWO but let's say you are out of newbies Spanish once you are a money trader and can cast gold dusts into bars with reasonable firearm trading to bring firearms to carib.
<br /><br /><strong>Milestone goals</strong>
<br /><br />- Casting R12+1
<br />- handcrafting R5
<br />- metal trading rank 4+5
<br />- firearm trading R6+3
<br />- wares trading R5
<br />- mineral trading R6+3
<br />- luxury trading R5
<br />- account R6+4
<br />- sociability R5+3
<br />- frugality R6
<br />- caution R6
<br /><br /><strong>optional </strong>(helps increase profits while training core skills)
<br />- weapon trading R3
<br />- craft trading R3
<br />- Spice trading
<br />- alcohol trading R4
<br /><br />Now lets break them down to 10 steps.
<br /><br />1. Aim for 10/7/7
<br /><br />10/7/7 is the requirement for dhow. fastest ship until you get yourself a Sambuk (16/22/16) You will be doing a lot of schooling. Schooling is mostly about sailing, so save your time with ship.
<br /><br />2. Graduate adv school
<br /><br />with dhow, you can easily graduate adv school so finish with it. you probably should get yourself adv lwww. galley for better trading after this. I personally think geography/recognition path is easiest. (tho it gives less long term benefits.)
<br /><br />3. Aim for merchant lvl of 16 (graduate merchant school)
<br /><br />dhow and galley should help you with most of merchant schooling.
<br /><br />this lvl is for a transport galley. Very nice ship for short distance trading until you move onto Arabian galley. (need to learn rowing)
<br /><br />keywords: dhow (10/7/7)
<br /><br />4. Aim for lv 22 merchant as you rank up casting/mineral/wares on mineral trader class in Oslo, Plymouth, Amsterdam, Hamburg.===
<br /><br />Here we start moving toward the goal. this stage is kind of hard until you get to casting R5. Your casting should be around R10 by the time you get to lv22.
<br /><br />Get yourself an aide too.
<br /><br />keywords: casting+1 hammer, mineral+2 earrings
<br /><br />5. Graduate maritime school and continue MT until lwww.
<br /><br />Continue with maritime until lwww.. You should be able to get permits to India if you do storyline.
<br /><br />keywords: transport carrack(5/17/5) nice PC made cannons, mining laying
<br /><br />learn about maritime
<br /><br />6. Chandler on Arabian galley around Barcelona until casting R12
<br /><br />Now, you should meet the requirements for the Arabian galley. awesome awesome ship for any purpose. You will love it so much. (its kind of hard to buy from the PC market. you might have to camp in Hormuz)
<br /><br />Become chandler and work on trading skills (especially firearm) and brash up ur casting to R12 here. (probably be lv28 merchant lvl too)
<br /><br />if you get to rank12 before you get to lvl.
<br /><br />you can optionally go India to learn spice trading before you start this step if spice is something you want for good.
<br /><br />The key item: firearm+2 earring (4m Hormuz), Arabian galley
<br /><br />7. Merchant lv28 then become money trader.
<br /><br />first become accountant to learn metal trading and luxury trading(if you haven't learned) Buy metal trading+2 boosts.
<br /><br />you get the quest with metal trading R5 requirement in Santo Domingo to get the card money trader. (maybe keep it)
<br /><br />keywords: gold armor, gold earring (from Zanzibar)
<br /><br />8. Handcraft rank5
<br /><br />this step should be really easy if you have come so far.
<br /><br />9. Optional step: get gem trading.
<br /><br />if you have some to help u get the quest in India. Having gem trading help you loading agates to protects markets for selling golds better. done! just become a money trader and keep casting gold from dusts in Carib to sell in EU. Oh, don't forget to invest 1m to unlock the recipe at craftsman in Habana.
<br /><br />keywords: big transport carrack
<br /><br />In my opinion, you don't need Xebec for Caribbean trading (combination of trading galleon and Arabian galley will do it better.)
<br /><br />Join our Spanish gold casting union to share information about ports to sell gold bars!
<br /><br />Bon voyage!

I always wondered where they got the name of the place.  And what sort of place it is its a dangerous place to get too but curiosity gets the best of me all the time.</em>
<br /><br /><span class="textAlign textAlignCenter"><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/138564553_13857518_46432062.jpg" /></span>
<br /><br />Istanbul (Turkish: ?stanbul), historically known as Constantinople it is the largest city in Turkey and 5th largest city proper in the world , also making it the second largest metropolitan area in Europe by population, and the largest metropolitan city proper. stanbul is also a megacity, as well as the cultural, economic, and financial centre of Turkey. The city covers 39 districts of the Istanbul province. It is located on the Bosphorus Strait and encompasses the natural harbour known as the Golden Horn, in the northwest of the country.
<br /><br /><span class="textAlign textAlignCenter"><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/138564553_1658463_46432067.jpg" /></span>
<br /><br />It extends both on the European (Thrace) and on the Asian (Anatolia) sides of the Bosphorus, and is thereby the only metropolis in the world that is situated on two continents. Istanbul is a designated alpha world city.
<br /><br />By the 19th century, the city had acquired a number of names used by either foreigners or Turks. Europeans often used Stamboul alongside Constantinople to refer to the whole of the city, but Turks used the former name only to describe the historic peninsula between the Golden Horn and the Sea of Marmara. Pera was used to describe the area between the Golden Horn and the Bosphorus, but Turks also used the name Beyo?lu, which is still in use today. However, with the Turkish Postal Service Law of 28 March 1930, the Turkish authorities formally requested foreigners to adopt ?stanbul, a name in existence since the 10th century, as the sole name of the city within their own languages.
<br /><br /><span class="textAlign textAlignCenter"><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/138564553_201395_46432072.jpg" /></span>
<br /><br />Born in Karaman he travelled to ?stanbul to study in the medrese founded by Mahmut Pasha. Later on, he worked as a teacher in the medrese. Being a man of letters, in various occasions he acted as a consultant to sultan. He contributed to the kanunname of Mehmet II, a series of laws regularizing the Ottoman Empire. He also helped the sultan in writing letters of high literary value to Akkoyunlu sultan Uzun Hasan.
<br /><br />The skills that can be learned from Kara Mehmet are.

<br /><br />The Süleymaniye Mosque (Turkish: Süleymaniye Camii) is an Ottoman imperial mosque located on the second Hill of Istanbul, Turkey. It is the second largest mosque in the city, and one of the best-known sights of Istanbul.
<br /><br />The Süleymaniye Mosque was built on the order of Sultan Süleyman (Süleyman the Magnificent) &quot;was fortunate to be able to draw on the talents of the architectural genius of Sinan Pasha&quot; (481 Traditions and Encounters: Brief Global History). The construction work began in 1550 and the mosque was finished in 1558.
<br />This &quot;vast religious complex called the Süleymaniye...blended Islamic and Byzantine architectural elements. It combines tall, slender minarets with large domed buildings supported by half domes in the style of the Byzantine church Hagia Sofia (which the Ottomans converted into the mosque of Aya Sofya)&quot; (481 Traditions and Encounters: Brief Global History).
<br /><br /><span class="textAlign textAlignCenter"><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/138564553_14617677_46432125.jpg" /></span>
<br /><br />The design of the Süleymaniye also plays on Suleyman's self-conscious representation of himself as a 'second Solomon.' It references the Dome of the Rock, which was built on the site of the Temple of Solomon, as well as Justinian's boast upon the completion of the Hagia Sophia: &quot;Solomon, I have surpassed thee!&quot; The Süleymaniye, similar in magnificence to the preceding structures, asserts Suleyman's historical importance. The structure is nevertheless smaller in size than its older archetype, the Hagia Sophia.
<br /><br />The Süleymaniye was ravaged by a fire in 1660 and was restored by Sultan Mehmed IV. Part of the dome collapsed again during the earthquake of 1766. Subsequent repairs damaged what was left of the original decoration of Sinan (recent cleaning has shown that Sinan experimented first with blue, before turning red the dominant color of the dome).
<br /><br />During World War I the courtyard was used as a weapons depot, and when some of the ammunition ignited, the mosque suffered another fire. Not until 1956 was it fully restored again.

<br /></em></span>
<br /><br /><strong>Evasion/repair/rescue/firstaide</strong> -
<br /><br />(assuming we have S.America permit)
<br /><br />you get proficiencies on evasion when you dodge shots with evasion on. So the conditions to maximize the efficiencies will be...
<br /><br />1. more enemy ships
<br />2. enemy shots are low in accuracy (no skill + low speed cannons)
<br />3. You boost evasion
<br />4. put cannon evasion figureheads
<br />5. enemy shots shooting against the wind direction. (you can dodge more this way)
<br /><br />the best condition to meet 1 and 2 is considered to be a quest from Rio. The enemies are 10 galleys without any cannon skills with fire cannons. (fire cannons have lower speed which is accuracy)
<br /><br />for 3, you should be able to boost 2 at least.
<br /><br />for 4, you need to buy tons of them from Calicut. To reduce the damage on your figurehead, you should have cheap armors and cannons (like cedar plate + falcon( 8 )
<br /><br />for 5, you need to see the wind direction when the battle starts and position yourself on the edge of the battlefield and continuously getting hit without killing any enemies. The best ship for this is galleon. (T.Galleon or B.galleon or adv galleon any will do) You should only load lumbers to repair yourself while doing this.
<br /><br />The best class for doing this is body guard.
<br /><br />This is a sample data for someone who did this for 17 hours in Rio.
<br /><br />Evasion?4 (750) &gt; 13(10991)
<br />Rescue?4 (1550) &gt; 7(136)
<br />First Aide?8 (1250) &gt; 11(1938)
<br />Repair 11 (800) &gt; 12(7244)
<br /><br />During this time, you will get this in 9 hours or less if you have 30% prof up.

<br /><br /><em>Part.2 of the power leveling skill guide by master Dary</em>
<br /><br />I'm putting off penetration for one reason from here. 
<br /><br />accuracy/reload/ballistics gain proficiencies based on number of cannon (slot) you hit whereas penetration gains based on damages you are dealing.
<br /><br />So, penetration is harder to power level compared to other 3. It is said to be more efficient to rank up 3 which ranks up with the same conditions, then rank up penetration with high accuracy/reload or high accuracy/ballistics with good cannons.
<br /><br />The quest you want for this is 104k quest from Tunis (requires R5 gunnery so get someone to help you introduce you the quest if you do not have R5 gunnery). We just want enemies with higher armor so we can keep shooting them without finishing the battle. (+ their shots are week and week in melee so you can reduce their numbers if you want.)
<br /><br />The ship you want will be adv galleon or B.Galleon or T.Galleon. You just need falcon( 8 ) or falcon(2) b/c falcons have high reload and speed (which is accuracy of your shots to give you more proficiencies) and low damage (so you won't kill your precious enemies).
<br /><br />The ideal class is certainly canoneer. If you are not lvl 28 yet then you should get there as quick as possible before you start doing this.
<br /><br /><strong>Trading skills -</strong>
<br /><br />Im not going to talk much details here but this is a good time to training your trading skills at loss. Like you can trade between Jamaica and Santiago for gold dusts continuously without bothering to bring them back to EU. 
<br /><br />This is also a good time to train account skills so better to do more short-distance tradings than long-distance tradings.

<br />Greetings voyagers! I’m taking a respite from traveling the oceans to reminisce about some of the people I’ve met on my travels. You see within the world everyone has a story and on a grander scale, every nation has a story. Highlighted by various personalities that you interact with, it provides a diversion from the trials and tribulations found out in the wide world. Working for your nation is rewarding in many ways, and you can encounter some interesting situations as you interact with some of the prominent figures in your nation’s capital and beyond.
<br /><br />Many of these encounters cover a broad range of activities and will provide experience in various areas, from battle to exploring and so on. In my case, meeting with the nobles of Venice, I’ve gone on to explore and find a new discovery, I’ve battled the Turks, and I’ve traveled to Africa and beyond. There were times when my skills were tested, and times when it was simply running from place to place to find someone or deliver something.
<br /><br />These activities can be challenging or simply a nice diversion from the leveling to make a side trip to a distant port. The rewards however are worth taking the time to pursue them. Ranging from experience, fame, money, and even maps or recipes, the time put in eventually leads to the Imperial Quests as well as opening up the world to greater and grander adventures.
<br /><br />Even during the course of some of these adventures I’ve gained or heard of other voyagers gaining special nation specific clothing or items that enhance or add to the experience gained from completing the tasks placed upon them by the personalities they encounter. The break from completing guild quests, or traveling from port to port selling your trade items, even sinking all those dratted pirates make the effort well worth it, and the compensation even for the smallest of tasks can be very rewarding.
<br /><br />So get out there and explore not only the world by your nation’s capital, you might come across someone in need of your help that will lead you to experience something new and different in the course of your adventures. You can always track your progress, or figure out where you are go next by checking your adventure journal under “Events”. Even the greatest of explorers can be lost or go in the wrong direction and need some assistance in finding the next port of call. Overall all get out there and explore and discover what waits in the service of your nation, or to simply help a possible patron noble!

<br /><br />Basic Profit Exp = {(profit + merchant lv + 1) / (merchant + 1) / 100 }
<br /><br />Gloss exp =
<br /><br />- Basic Profit Exp * 4 (if over 100k)
<br /><br />- Basic Profit Exp * 2 (if over 10k but less than 100k)
<br /><br />- Basic Profit Exp * 1 (if less than 10k)

<br /><br />Specialty combo bonus exp = { (Gloss exp + total of specialty exp ) * (number of specialty goods over 50 quantity -1) / 5% }
<br /><br />Net merchant exp = Gloss Exp + total of Specialty exp + Specialty combo bonus exp
<br /><br />So...
<br /><br />Getting over 10k is your first goal.
<br /><br />Then getting over 100k is your next goal.
<br /><br />selling over 50 quantity of specialty is good. if you have only 45 then get 5 more somehow for specialty combo bonus.
<br /><br />Confusing huh well give it a try! whiskey, pepper, Ruby combo in a Spanish port and see what happens or you can bring muskets and sherry to the Caribbean

<br />February 10th, 1495

<br /><br />The oceans of the world are vast, but even when there is no one on the horizon, we do not sail alone. There is a plethora of ways to communicate with other voyagers as we make our ways through the adventures, trials, and discoveries within the world. Look over them, there are many to be used and perhaps a few that would be good to have additionally. Taking a closer look is the theme of this entry, for even though we might spend our days at sea alone moving towards our own goals and achieving our own fame.
<br /><br />The primary method of communication is the chat, within which are several different modes. First of course is to simply speak or “Say”. This talks to those in the immediate vicinity to you and is a great way to communicate, greet, and start up conversations with other voyagers in your close proximity. It is commonly used in the taverns or when you’re standing/sailing close by someone else. While it’s not private, it is of course the first mode of the chat, which is standard with any game.
<br /><br />Next is the “Party” mode which when you’re in a Fleet with other players, working towards completing a quest or simply taking a journey together. Party mode allows players who are Fleeted together to chat, discuss plans of attack, compare notes, or simply enjoy each other’s company as they sail out into the unknown. It’s a great way to keep your team members current on plans and to build a tighter group as you travel and adventure together.
<br /><br />“Tells” are fairly simple and straight forward of course. They are straight whispers between voyagers, a secure way for one person to speak to another about anything they want. Following that is “Shout” which is really the opposite of “Tells” in that it will reach out to players within the area on a larger scale than normal “Say”. For instance if I have something of vital importance to say to the citizens of Venice whom are in town I can shout out to them and they will all see what I have to say. Mind you it’s very public and not really something to be used for casual conversation it is great ways to get the word out about something; or to look for more Fleet members and even recruit Company members.
<br /><br />This brings me to Company chat, which of course is for members of the same company to talk and discuss anything and everything related to life, the seas, and of course company business. This mode reaches all company members regardless of where in the world they might be at any given time. The last regular mode is “Chat Rooms” that you can create and invite other voyagers into for a lively discussion without the fuss of having to form a Fleet. It provides a secure way to have a private conversation with other players no matter where they happen to be and can be expanded or shrank as the room creator desires.
<br /><br />There is a special chat mode that is exclusive to new players and lasts until a certain point following finishing the school quests. This is the “School’ mode, which allows players from all nations to discuss and share their tips, discoveries or ask questions from other players who are further along in the game then they happen to be at that moment. It can only hold 200 people at any given time, but it’s a great forum for players regardless of nation to discuss anything that comes to mind as they move through the world and learn about the trials the oceans hold.
<br /><br />Missing from this, which I truly believe is something that would be very useful is a “Nation” mode which would allow voyagers to discuss and chat with all the other people within their nation. It would be great for times of war, help with taking over ports through investments and building on the new colonies available in the new world. Another addition that would be good to see is perhaps a “Jobs” mode that would allow people to join and discuss the finer points of being either in the Adventurer, Trade, or Battle jobs that are available in the game. This would be a good extension of the School channel for voyagers who might find themselves stuck on a problem and need to reach out to others whom might know the answer to their job or quest related questions.
<br /><br />A part of the chat system, though separate is the Friend’s list which allows you to build up a list of select other voyagers you regularly talk to, fleet with, or may one day form a company with. You invite players to your friends list and can use it to invite those same people to one of your chat rooms. You can also send mail via your friends list so that if one of your friends happens to be off on shore leave and not around to talk to, you can send them a letter for them to collect later.
<br /><br />All in all there are many ways to reach out and communicate with other voyagers, and allow you to build up good friendships through random encounters, Fleeting, Companies, or simply during the school phase of play. A few more options would always be handy and we can hope that they might one day be added, until then…

(Part.11) Capt.Aki's to<br/><br/>Captain-Aki-Chan hasn't had much adventure these days because she is currently gaining battle level just enough for her to get her Xebec license unknowingly leveling-up in Stockholm would be a grand adventure when 3 pirates planned to attack her.
<br /><br /><span class="textAlign textAlignCenter"><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/138564553_9731523_46730950.jpg" /></span>
<br /><br />We all know what happened when Captain-Aki-Chan decided to bully someone.  She ended up being a pirate and wasn't too pleased with it. She even warned other players what would happen if you decide to be one and have such a low battle level. 
<br /><br />So there I was by my lonesome self being all bored and sinking vikings and privateers one by one and resupplying in Stockholm . Then suddenly by the side shores or Stockholm as I left town there were two pirates. Oh nos! they attacked captain Aki-chan! but since she was close to town she ran back &gt;.&lt;&quot; with two pirates and a decent battle level of 20-30 Captain-Aki-Chans level 18 battle was just enough to defend herself and flee!
<br /><br />And so staring out of Stockholm harbor I waited for them to go away with another dutch player. all he kept saying was dangerous.... dangerous..... Hmmm O.K I will just wait for them to go away but they didn't so I tried to move away from town bit they reacted!. ooops! seems they aren't going to go anywhere soon. So I waited some more.....
<br /><br />then suddenly one of them PMed me. his name was Franky
<br /><br />Franky&gt; Tell your armada friends that they want a taste of EIC ships (Or something like that Blah Blah!)
<br />Aika&gt; O.K pls wait
<br /><br />(there were a few more exchange in words and stuff I dont remember I was so sleepy it was 1AM)
<br /><br />So the real fun begins Aelita only the greatest pirate player in the game she can even kick Jacksons butt yay!
<br /><br />Aelita&gt; Im OMW
<br /><br />Aika&gt; O.K he says hes in Danzig
<br /><br />after a few min waiting and PMing Franky we finally caught up with him in Danzig. Alita was able to see him outside and attacked him! but he ran away!. and Aelita was blocked by NPC pirates Darn it!!. But there is no hiding from the greatest pirate since she had search skills  we cornered him in Visby he was all alone now so we had a nice chat about how it wasn't fare that he was only level 27 and Aelita was 50 hmmm I was only 18 when they attacked me &gt;.&lt;&quot; and so I said O.K 3 of you can tag-team. Aelita said for me to go out of the town. Unknowingly he did plan to attack with his other buddies since they were already outside waiting as I left town. Hmm so that's were all the fun began!!!
<br /><br />Soon after leaving the town we moved a bit to open seas we waited for them to approach!
<br /><br /><span class="textAlign textAlignCenter"><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/138564553_16212890_46730967.jpg" /></span>
<br /><span class="textAlign textAlignCenter"><em>Yup its three against two and me being the lowest level</em></span>
<br /><br />The battle begun! we planted mines then suddenly Aelita dashes! forward ignoring the enemy's cannons
<br /><br /><span class="textAlign textAlignCenter"><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/138564553_7478430_46730982.jpg" /></span>
<br /><span class="textAlign textAlignCenter"><em>errr I took pictures <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/biggrin.gif" alt=":)" /></em>
<br /></span>
<br /><br />I less than a minute two of them were sunk!
<br /><br /><span class="textAlign textAlignCenter"><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/138564553_2535842_46730990.jpg" /></span>
<br /><span class="textAlign textAlignCenter">The Ice melted and the Shark broke his teeth against Aelita's burning fury!</span>
<br /><br />Aelita made sure she personally meet Franky on his ship but he ran away. So she decided to just blow him away
<br /><br /><span class="textAlign textAlignCenter"><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/138564553_14545822_46731057.jpg" /></span>
<br /><br />It all ended in less than 5 minutes but was a tremendous amount of fun! I'm not angry with the EIC or MTC for shooting me at the rear and trying to sink me I guess these three were acting on their own.
<br /><br />But to make the same mistake will only unleash Armada Fury! Aelita is a member of the Spanish Armada and currently the Number 1 pirate ^^, we have other strong members too but they prefer not to be pirates
<br /><br />Before leaving them I left then an important message
<br /><br />Be good now!
<br /><br />It's fun to make friends and dangerous to make enemies
<br /><br />Capt-Aki-Chan!
<br /><br />So Franky and me are friends now ^_^

<br /><br />February 15th, 1495</em>
<br /><br />As you progress through world, encountering the dangers at sea, making great discoveries, or becoming a trading power house, it isn’t a feat you should manage alone. Certainly you can travel with a Company or a Fleet, but also as you attain certain Milestones, you can hire Aides to assist you in your adventures. They can back you up in various roles, with their support skills, or just to keep you company as you travel. They can play a beneficial role in your travels as they develop their support skills you can focus your attention on building your own skills.
<br /><br /><span class="textAlign textAlignCenter"><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/138564553_11224764_46886782.jpg" /></span>
<br /><br />Once you reach level 20 in Adventure, Trade, or Maritime, you can hire your first Aide. Choosing one is of course a matter of what needs you have skill wise and which alternate ones you could use. Aides have different jobs so their skill development is based on their background, plus what role you place them in on your ship. The roles available for an Aide to fill are:
<br />Chief Navigator
<br />Lookout
<br />Accountant
<br />Store Keeper
<br />Lieutenant
<br />Ship’s Doctor.
<br /> These roles will provide a boost to your aide’s levelling in one or two categories from Adventure, Trade, or Maritime. Levelling up these will open the door to more skills and improve the usefulness of your aides.
<br /><br />You can hire up to 4 aides, however you can only bring 1 with you until you reach level 40 in a category. Then you will be able to bring 2 aides with you at a time, while the other two will remain waiting for you in your quarters. Aides are hired in the taverns of certain cities, these cities are: Seville, Lisbon, Venetia, Marseille, Amsterdam, London, Naples, Geneva, Tunis, Alexandria, Athens, Istanbul, Calicut, Portobello, Rio de janeiro, and Jakarta. You might want to shop around to find the right Aide for you as they each have unique skills, characteristics and a language skill(s).
<br /><br /><span class="textAlign textAlignCenter"><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/138564553_4596622_46886788.jpg" />
<br /></span>
<br />Additionally, you can give your Aide(s) equipment which can boost their effectiveness and make them even further useful. I’ve found that giving them complementary equipment can offer even better opportunities to put their skills to full use as they develop. Having a couple of mates to travel and pitch in with essential skills has helped me seek better opportunities for growth, profit, and completing quests. While the initial cost of hiring an Aide is 100,000, and they have a daily wage, their eventual usefulness more than pays for the cost of brining them on board and investing in their growth. Every captain needs a solid crew to make the most of the opportunities found out in the world’s oceans. So get out there, find a good crew of aides to back you up and build your name, glory, and fame on the high seas.

		<document id="32c7502537d6d5744584140be44da3b2" url=""><![CDATA[The Noob Adventurers Handbook to XP<br/><br/><em>Adventure is the hardest class to lvl in UWO both in any stage of the game and is usually the last to be maximized by expert players because it is very time consuming and there is no way to speed the process if you are playing alone.</em>
<br /><br />This guide was original made by starcrossed I did not follow it but it is very useful and correct.
<br /><br />How to gain quick experience and fame as a beginning Adventurer:
<br /><br />This can be done solo but has better results in a group as you get nearly twice the fame if you all turn in the quests at once.
<br /><br /><strong>Step One - Getting to Athens:</strong>
<br /><em>Prerequisites:</em>
<br /><br /><em>Quests/Jobs:</em>
<br /><br />All three Intermediate schools complete so that you have the three Adventure job permits
<br />500 adventure fame, which you should get from the schools.
<br /><br />Helms person for skills.
<br /><br /><strong>Skills:</strong>
<br /><br />Recognition
<br /><br />Geography
<br /><br />Spanish
<br /><br />Portuguese
<br /><br />Once you have the prerequisites, you will need to take a trip to Seville so you can begin what many of us call the 588-91. This refers to the quest rewards that the quests give, 58,800 ducats and 9,100 ducats respectively. You will need to go to the Adventure’s guild and speak to the Mediator to begin one of these quests.
<br /><br /><strong>588 - The Middle of the Atlantic</strong>
<br />This quest gives a reward of 58,800 ducats. All it requires is sailing west from Seville until you find an island chain that consists of three small islands known as the Azores. Once you are amongst them, you use recognition to ‘discover’ the islands. You then return to Seville and turn the quest in, netting a few hundred exp and fame as well as 58,800 Ducats.
<br /><br /><strong>91 - The Tip of the Iberian Peninsula</strong>
<br />Because you cannot repeat a quest, you need a filler quest after you do 588. This quest is normally a quest to Faro for 9,100 ducats known as the Tip of the Iberian Peninsula. It is quick and will allow you to start 588 again quickly. However, if this quest is not available any quick quest to Malaga or Lisbon also works to speed up the process. You will need to do this until you reach 2,000 adventure fame.
<br /><br /><strong>Step Two - Raising Archeology</strong>
<br /><em>Prerequisites:</em>
<br /><br /><em>Quests/Jobs:</em>
<br /><br />Excavator
<br /><br /><strong>Skills:</strong>
<br /><br />Archeology
<br /><br />Unlock
<br /><br />For step three, level 4 Archeology is required. The quickest way to do this is to head to Genoa. In Genoa there is a level 1 geography quest that takes you to Naples to speak to the scholar and then find an item in the Naples melee combat zone. Once that is done, you can turn the quest in at the Tavern and pick up an Archeology quest that sends you back to Genoa to speak to the Scholar there. This quest sends you back to Naples to dig another item. You will need to repeat this process till you have level 4 Archeology.
<br /><br />To maximize this process, you should be in a group. Pick a person to go first to discover the item. Everyone else stands back far enough that they cannot discover the item yet. This person with get between 20-40 proficiency. You then allow a second person to come dig while the original person stays in place. The second person and the first person obtain 20-40 proficiency, allowing the first to now collect 40-80 proficiency in one trip. You do this until everyone has discovered, then next time allow someone else in the group to go first. Take turns, work together.
<br /><br />An alternate way to do this step is to reach level 2 Archeology, then repeat the Archeology school quest to Tunis repeatedly in a group until you reach level four. This, however, requires you almost be finished with Advanced Adventure school.
<br /><br /><strong>Step 3 - Arriving in Athens:</strong>
<br /><em>Prerequisites:</em>
<br /><br /><em>Quests/Jobs:</em>
<br /><br />2,000 Fame
<br /><br /><strong>Skills:</strong>
<br /><br />Arabic - Can learn in Genoa Merchant GM
<br /><br />Greek - Can learn in Naples Merchant GM
<br /><br />Treasure Appraisal - Can learn in Lisbon Adventure GM
<br /><br />Unlock - Should have learned when switching to Excavator
<br /><br />This is the final step in fame farming for beginners. With this quest line, in a group, you can easily obtain 10,000-15,000 fame in just a few days of constant, determined farming. Possibly even 500-1000 an hour if you do it right.
<br /><br />You will need to go to Athens. In Athens you will need to pick up the quest the Sultans. This quest will send you to Beirut where you must speak to the Scholar. The Scholar will send you into the Alexandria wilds to discover something. Turn this quest in at the Alexandria Tavern and pick up Mourning a Greek Tragedy quest which takes you back to Athens to speak to the Scholar and discover something in the Athens wilds. You can run these two quests repeatedly and make possibly 100,000 ducats every 30-60 minutes while gaining massive fame and experience.
<br /><br />Edit: Sultans requires Appraisal level 4, Unlock level 2. If you do not want to level that you can alternately get Town Dedicated to Love from Athens to Famagusta.
<br /><br /><strong>Things to note:</strong>
<br /><br />Any nation can do this.
<br /><br />Quests that send you to a scholar normally require you to read a book.
<br /><br />This method may not be for everyone as they may get bored repeating the quest lines

<br /><br /><strong>Captain Anjel's Log                               
<br />by David &quot;AnjelusX&quot; Slauenwhite</strong>
<br /><br />February 15th, 1495
<br /><br />Ahoy mates, another entry for another week, one that takes me off the oceans for a bit of rest and enjoyment. While there’s always sailing to be done, there are times when you need to come off the ship and find a place to relax with your mates or stash some of your booty. Surely the bank vault is a helpful place for storing items of great importance, but we all know you can’t stash everything in there. Not only is it costly to switch out your gear or place your most precious of items. This is where buying some housing comes in, which you can also purchase from the bank in your home town for 5 million ducats. Even the free room you get at the dormitory has some small cubby space to put some of your loot it’s when you lay down some of your hard earned ducats to upgrade to normal housing that it begins to open up storage for several kinds of gear.
<br /><br />You can store the following types and numbers of items in your Rank 1 housing.
<br /><br />- Equipment - 2
<br />   - Documents - 2
<br />   - Reserve Aides - 1
<br />   - Ship Parts/Hardwares - 2
<br />   - Trade Goods - 2
<br />   - Mannequin - 1
<br />   - Consumables - 2
<br />   - Skill Books - 0 (Requires a Book shelf/Case)
<br />   - Display Ornaments – 1
<br /><br />Of course when you upgrade the ranks of your housing it will open up more spaces for storing the various types of items. This is always handy as you progress through your travels collecting Fame and Ranks. You also have to spend some money and have some items on hand to complete the redesign, but this makes for extra spaces when your inventory is full and you need to save some important items that might not value enough for the vault yet keep them somewhere relatively safe.
<br /><br />An additional way to increase the space you have for storage in your home is to buy or craft furniture that you can place in your home. Different pieces of furniture affect which spaces you add to, and with the case of bookshelves/case, you open the door to allow for the storage of skill books rather than having to carry them around with you all the time. Furniture can be bought from other players whom have crafted them or acquired them from quests/discoveries or during special events. How you place them of course is a matter of taste and while you might not plan to use your home as anything more than an additional storage unit, you don’t want to clutter things up either. My old captain always told me neatness might not make money but it keeps the rats off the ship.
<br /><br />Finally, aside from giving your reserve aides somewhere to rest their weary heads and a place for you and 4 visitors to meet in some measure of privacy, perhaps for a rousing game of cards or just to trade old sea stories. You might find the need to protect the fruits of your labours, you might trust your friends but you never know with some of the old salty sea dogs out there. You can, with the appropriate trapping skill, set traps to protect your treasures, to defend your home from any blighters who might want to make off with your hard earned, fought, or pillaged loot. You never know about some of them pirate blokes out there in the world, better to be prepared and have a good trap ready to snap than to lose something you might rather not. Either way, save up your money and buy yourself a place to rest your weary bones and store your precious booty.

<br /><br />February 28th, 1495
<br /><br />Good day fellow voyagers, after some much needed time spent resting and spinning old sea tales with mates who came to call it’s time to put back out to sea. While I’ve covered many parts that make the voyages and travels around the seas, I’m going to take a moment to talk about one of the prime parts of ship’s defence. There’s something quite exciting and moving to the roar of cannons fired in the heat of battle, taking it ship to ship might be more daring, but the manoeuvres of movement to get a good bearing on an enemy before blasting away at them has its own charm and appeal.
<br /><br />The main way to really score with your cannon fire is to get into a position of maximum damage, targeting and hitting the enemy’s bow or stern for critical damage. Position is a key to battles at sea, both for doing the most damage to the enemy as well as protecting yourself from the same. However, I’ve discussed this before, so for this entry I want to talk a bit about the actual tools rather than the methods. Let’s take a look at the cannons that are available to you as you progress through your travels, trials, and tribulations! Cannons come with their set of stats and found in bundles of 2 to 16, with more cannons per bundles their damage increases.
<br /><br />There are several types which I will talk about momentarily; firstly, cannons all have a set of stats, with only one major change between them depending on how many are in one particular bundle. These are:
<br /><br />Durability - Cannons break down over time and damage, much like regular weapons, equipment, and other parts.
<br />    Piercing Power - which is the amount of piercing damage shots will do to enemy vessels and armour) (*The numbers goes up or down depending on how many cannons are in the bundle, more cannons means more power).
<br />    Range – the maximum distance shots from the cannon will travel outwards from your ship
<br />    Speed – which is the speed at which shots will travel once fired to the enemy, useful in timing your shots to hit the enemy at the most effective points.
<br />    Burst Range - which is the amount of spread damage, will do on impact.
<br />    Loading speed – the rate at which cannons reload and are prepared to fire again.
<br /><br />All of these factors need to be taken into account when you are shopping for which cannons you wish to equip on your ship, coupled with the cannon type that appeals to you the most. Normal type cannons are your good old fashion cannons that fire a round ball to impact on the enemy vessel. Double shot on the other hand, fires two rounds in rapid succession. Grapeshot is specifically designed to be used to attack the enemy ship’s crew, full of pellets that will kill enemy sailors. Chain shot is a type of shot used to attack the sails and masts of the enemy to cut down on their speed and ability to manoeuvre. Incendiary shot is especially vicious in that its primary use is to set the enemy ship ablaze with fire doing damage over the course of time as the ship burns. Last but not least is Smoke shot which is used prior to conducting ship to ship melee combat., Smoke will cause confusion and provide your with an advantage when taking the battle to the enemy ship’s deck.
<br /><br />There are plenty of options and as you upgrade vessels you can always mix and match to suit your play style. Trying to line up range and speed even between different types can be effective to do a barrage of fire that can damage and cause disorder amongst your enemies. For myself I have a love for incendiary cannons though I couple them with standard cannons so I can provide good damage while taking the chance to inflict even more damage with a good fire. Choose your cannons well and may you find victory out on the oceans my friends.
<br /><br />Fair Breezes and Safe Seas,
<br />Captain Anjelus Xavier Infiniti

<br /><br /><span class="textAlign textAlignCenter"><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/138564553_6343605_47670084.jpg" /></span>
<br /><br />Short distance trade with handicrafts/cooking/sewing/casting for beginner profits (exp/fame not first priority)
<br /><br />1. Very good trade route is Antwerp-Den Helder.
<br />You need at least level 3 cooking and level 3 handicrafts and level 1 sewing.
<br />Let's say we start at Helder, buy all chicken - pluck feathers (sewing1, Fabric Secrets - Hardwares book, bought in Amsterdam for 5000D), buy all sheep - make lamb (cooking3, Livestock secrets - Sheep book, 8000D Amsterdam), sell lamb to market keeper (profit of 40-60k in couple of minutes). Even better if you have cooking level 5 and can make sausages (level 5 recipe from the sheep book). Then make sausages and sell to market keeper - even better profit. After doing that sail to Antwerp, sell feathers (or you can sell feathers in Calais nearby for better exp/fame), buy all wheat and pork (if you have level 5 cooking - then buy pork).
<br />Make Akvavit from wheat ( handicrafts 3, book Brewery Secrets from Hamburg for 10000D) and sausages from pork (cooking 5, book Livestock secrets - Pigs, 8000D from Porto). Sail back to Helder and sell everything. Repeat <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" /> It's quite good early money, can make several 100 000's per hour this way. But it gets boring quickly.
<br /><br />2. Bergen - Oslo if you have Historical Crafts Guide book.
<br />Bergen has Rye and Lumber, while Oslo - Wool and Lumber.
<br />Go to Bergen, buy Rye and Lumber, make Vodka (handicrafts 3, brewery secrets book) or Whiskey (handicrafts 4, same book), and make Wooden figures from Lumber (handicrafts 3, Historical Crafts Guide book, 400000D investment in Cairo). Now sail to Oslo, sell everything there (can make some 80-150k profit easily), buy Lumber and Wool in Oslo (Lumber-&gt;Wooden figures). Make woolen cloth (sewing 3, book Fabric secrets - Cloth, 10000D Antwerp/Helder) or knitted cloth (sewing 4, same book), even better flannel (sewing7, Fabric Secrets - Fine Cloth, 240000D invest + 100000D price) or tweed (sewing8, same as flannel).
<br /><br /><span class="textAlign textAlignCenter"><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/138564553_16118374_47670095.jpg" /></span>
<br /><br />Mid distance trading
<br /><br />1. Spare rudders/Spare sails.
<br />All you need is Casting level 2 (book Shipwright Basics, 10000D Antwerp) and Sewing 2 (Shipwright Basics, 10000D Antwerp).
<br />Sail to Amsterdam, make 400 spare sails(can take up to 5-6 trips to Amsterdam, can sail to Helder, make feathers, lamb, sausages etc for quick profits too as mentioned earlier) - 200 in inventory and 200 in store. Then sail to Oslo (more lumber on sale than Bergen), make 400 Spare rudders.
<br />Now the problem is that in North Sea area the price for these has fallen a lot. So you'd need to sail to Lisbon to sell sails (1.5-1.6 ea, 350-400k profit, but no exp), and search for a place to sell rudders (don't really know in Europe as I always sell my rudders in Luanda when going to India or so. Can sell sails here too). So all in all you can make 700-800k profit easily, but will get no exp for it.
<br /><br />2. Velvet to Northern Europe. Basically buy all velvet in Genoa/Pisa (now sells it too), max price would be 4000-4500 per unit, the lower the better.
<br />In NE you can sell it for ~5500-6000, so it is a profit of 1000-2500 per unit. Usually if I can't buy it for 4000ea I don't bother.
<br /><br />3. Diamonds/Gold/Ivory to Northern Europe. You can buy these in West Africa, after some investment. Problem is these sell in small amounts, 4-6 in each market with no trading skills. So metal/gem trading is a must for it to be really effective route. For example you can buy diamonds for 2.5-3.5k in Luanda and sell them for 9-10k in Northern Europe. Great profit. Cons: need West Africa permit, which is 6000-8000 fame depending on nation
<br /><br />4. Silver/Gold dust/Caribbean specialties/Ginger to Northern Europe. Need port permits of course.
<br />This is the route I am experimenting right now with, as going to India takes 3 hours of sailing there and back.
<br />Silver is attractive as you can buy it for 1.2-1.5k in Santo Domingo, and sell for around 4000 in Northern Europe. Also with precious metal trading skill you can load it up quite quickly with sailing to San Juan and back.
<br />Another great commodity is Ginger, can buy it for 250 or so in Jamaica, sells for 2000-2500.
<br />Also every specialty except peanuts can get you around 1000-1500 profit per item, good exp and fame. Thats cacao, tobacco, tequila, pineapples.
<br />There is also expensive dye in Jamaica, thyrian purple or something, can get around 3000 profit per item (buy for 4000 sell for 7000).
<br />With trade job I get around 5000-6000 exp per route, and it takes only 1.5-2 hrs at most, earning 1-2m profit (largely depends on goods transported).
<br />Bring Northern Europe specialties to Caribs, or just Dutch Calico for max profits (sells for 1500 profit per item or so).
<br /><br />5. Antique art/Damask fabric/Turkish carpets to Northern Europe.
<br />If you can buy these for good prices (till 110-115%), can sell for 2-3k profit per item in Northern Europe.
<br />The problem is that sailing to Beirut from Amsterdam takes a lot of time, Caribbean is a better choice imo.
<br /><br /><span class="textAlign textAlignCenter"><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/138564553_2483051_47670109.jpg" /></span>
<br /><br />Long distance trade
<br /><br />One word - India <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />The ultimate trade route, takes ages, but profit is too attractive to resist.
<br />When sailing to India, you can earn around 1-1.5m with Europe-&gt;India trip.
<br />When going back, the profits are insane.
<br />For example sold Ruby/Sapphire for 15k ea in Antwerp yesterday. Can buy these for 3-5k in Ceylon.
<br />Other great goods: Cat's eye, Cinnamon, Cardamom, Pepper, Aventurine.
<br />Gem trading is very helpful, also spice trading would help too.
<br />Need lots of fame to get permits though.
