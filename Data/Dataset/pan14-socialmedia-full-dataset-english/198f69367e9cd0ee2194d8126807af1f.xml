High intake of hydrogen peroxide (bleach) tend to make these people more susceptible to adverse after-effects of alcohol. Pregnant women should also avoid bleaching products. <br /><br />If you have sensitive teeth then you might like to have a soft tooth-brush and then a medicated tooth-paste after getting gone through teeth whitening to reduce the pain and tenderness to its minimum.

If you need smaller improvements, the toothpaste and mouth rinse may very well be their best choice as they contain smaller amounts of the active ingredients. This means you will find there's smaller risk of side effects like weakened sensitive teeth. This usually occurs in people who had sensitive teeth in the beginning. <br />.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2plZmZyZXliZXJuYTcxNy53ZWJzaXRld2l6YXJkLmNvbS9jb3NtZXRpYy1kZW50aXN0cnktYS1ib29uLXRvLWRlbnRhbC1zY2llbmNlLmh0bWw_" target="_blank">Cosmetic Dentistry - A Boon to Dental Science</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2plZmZyZXliZXJuYTcxNy5kbXVzaWMubmV0L2pvdXJuYWwvMTc0NjU4" target="_blank">Cosmetic Dentistry</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/AileeacnheFbalower/blog/blogid=7202649" target="_blank">Cosmetic Dentistry - A Boon to Dental Science</a>
