		<document id="f4fd31303ac86e31cc12bb36ea2387ab" url=""><![CDATA[I was thinking<br/><br/>I was recently thinking about several things, one of which is time, Some people say that time is a circle, others a figure eight. I on the other hand, see time as a dot. The main basis for my theory is that When something happens in time. It changes everything, all at once. Something that is happening twenty years from now, Is happening right now, in another time. Most of you out there wont understand this, but some of you will.
<br /><br />I also figured out something nifty, Should a person actually build a time machine, They would only be able to travel back or forwards by a count of years, (There would be no specific date setting, only today however many years ago.) The reason for this is that, should a person travel backwards through time, they are not traveling through space as well, So a person would come out in the exact same location in the universe as they were when they left their own time. The Earth however, will not be in the same spot. You might end up in space, or stuck in a mountain, or something equally unpleasant.
<br /><br />Something Cool about 3.
<br />Did you know that any three consecutive numbers, when strung together to make one number, the resulting number is divisable by three. Also, If you start at the number two, and count by three's the average of the three numbers you counted is divisable by three. 
<br /><br />Another thing I thought about recently is Underwater/Space construction. Would it be possable to build an underwater facility? Imagine, a large field just fifteen feet below the surface of the ocean, Plants could be grown there, they would not take up any &quot;Land&quot; and they would get sunlight. Should a ship need to pass over that part of the ocean, the underwater field could be lowered into the sea to allow for it.
<br />You could also theoreticly do the same thing in space, with plants getting full time sun,  
<br /><br />Have you ever thought about the robot suits you see in some movies? or like Gundam Wing?  Here's my thought on those. Should the US military decide, they could hire toy companies to build these things....I mean, I've seen some of those toys they've got. Pre-tt-y fancy.

<br /><br />We don't care if you talk to other guys.
<br /><br />We don't care if you're friends with other guys.
<br /><br />But when you're sitting next to us, and some random guy walks into the room and you jump up and tackle him, without even introducing us, yeah, it pisses us off.
<br /><br />It doesn't help if you sit there and talk to him for ten minutes without even acknowledging the fact that we're still there.
<br /><br />We don't care if a guy calls you, but at 2 in the morning we do get a little concerned. Nothing is that important at 2 a.m. that it can't wait till the morning.

<br />Also, when we tell you you're pretty/ beautiful/ gorgeous/ cute/ stunning, we freaking mean it.
<br /><br />Don't tell us we're wrong.
<br /><br />We'll stop trying to convince you.
<br /><br />The sexiest thing about a girl is confidence.
<br />__________________________
<br />___________________
<br /><br />_______
<br />Yeah, you can quote me.
<br /><br />Push us down on the couch and make a move once in a while. We like that aggressiveness about you and we like the unexpected. When we know you're really happy, it makes us happy too.
<br /><br />You always want us to show you our affection, but it works both ways. Don't wait for us to grab your hand or put our arms around you (although we should do this anyway), make the first move every once in a while, that way we know you care about us as much as we care about you.
<br />__________________________

<br />Don't be mad when we hold the door open.
<br />Take Advantage of the mood im in.
<br /><br />LET US PAY FOR YOU!
<br /><br />DON'T &quot;FEEL BAD&quot;
<br /><br />We enjoy doing it (Paying for you).
<br /><br />It's expected.
<br /><br />Smile and say &quot;thank you.&quot;
<br />__________________________

<br />Kiss us when no one's watching.
<br /><br />If you kiss us when you know nobody's looking we'll be more impressed.

<br /><br />_______
<br />You don't have to get dressed up for us.
<br /><br />If we're going out with you in the first place, you don't have to feel the need to wear the shortest skirt you have or put on every kind of makeup you own.
<br /><br />We like you for WHO you are and not WHAT you are.
<br /><br />honestly, i think a girl looks more beautiful when she's just in her pj's. or my tshirt and boxers, not all dolled up
<br /><br />__________________________

<br />Don't take everything we say seriously.
<br /><br />Sarcasm is a beautiful thing. See the beauty in it.

<br />Whatever happened to the word &quot;handsome&quot;/&quot;beautiful&quot;
<br /><br />I'd be utterly stunned by a girl who greeted me with &quot;Hey
<br />handsome!&quot; instead of &quot;Hey baby/ stud/ cutie/ sexy&quot; or whatever else you can think of.
<br /><br />on the other hand im not saying I wouldn't like it either ; )

<br /><br />Someone who will honor your morals.
<br /><br />Someone who will make you smile when you're at your lowest.
<br /><br />Someone who will care for you even when you make mistakes.
<br /><br />ENJOY A GOOD MAN...THEY ARE HARD TO COME BY IN A DAY AND AGE AS WE LIVE IN WHERE PEOPLE DON'T GIVE A SHIT....LONESTAR
<br /><br />Someone who will love you, no matter how bad you make them feel.
<br /><br />Someone who will stop what theyre doing just to look you in the

<br /><br />....AND ACTUALLY MEAN IT!
<br /><br />Give the nice guys a chance!!!!!!

<br />Pain is something that comes and goes like the ebbs of the tide of time, Pulsing and fading as rapidly as does the dawn.
<br /><br />Like a fresh show fallen, it melts away, only to be replaced by an even harder freeze. Like a coating of ice upon the heart, or upon the mind, it suffocates, while numbing from the cold. So pain is there, but you must remember, it always fades away, to be replaced by the cold light of day,  Or the warmth of a summer breeze
