The bulk our rainfall usually falls in Jamuary and February. There is a front, that brought a nice cool down, moving through the area now. Some parts of the county did get some light drizzle but all I noticed here was virga and not much of that. Sun came and went most of the day. I managed to get the front yard mowed. I also finished the first installment of rain collection system. The greenhouse is now set up to collect 220 gallons of rain from the north side roof gutter. When I set up the south side system it is prelimed so the collected water flows directly into the greenhouse. When that side is set up I will run another line to tie in the north side system. I did not have time to test the system for leaks but decided the rain water is free and if it does leak it is better to lose that than the pricey treated tap water. The places it might leak are the bungs that screw into the barrel. One of the bungs has a pipe thread I screwed a pipe thread 3/4" shedule 40 pvc to slip connector. I did use teflon tape on the threads where it screwed into the barrel and the threads on the connector that screwed into the bung. I had to drill out the bung hole where it threaded in to allow water to flow from the barrel to a manifold. The manifold connects the four barrels and should allow water to seek its own level and fill all four barrels from one downspout hole. I put hardware cloth in the downspout opening and modified the downspout to dump into a flower pot. I cut out a hole in the end barrel to place the flower pot into and lined the bottom with a coffee filter to help catch debris. I drilled a vent hole in each barrel to help them fill. There is a hose bib connector at the west end of the manifold to allow a hose hookup to drain the barrels. Susie likes the blend of green colors against the dark green greenhouse frame. It is not like a fancy system but for 18 bucks a barrel, some sweat equity in putting the manifold together, pvc ipe and connectors and some ingenuity with an idea or two plagerized from fellow gardeners on the web it is a nice system. It should save us some on water allowing us to continue gardening and the soft rain water should be good for the plants. We do filter the city water and the system does take out some very unwanted chemicals and chlorine but the water is still hard and does not meet federal soft water standards. I also managed to get the oranamentals a fall shot of fertilizer. The gallardia I had hoped would be a blaze of autumn colors is struggling. I was misinformed the plant only needed spring fertilizing but learned it is a heavy feader. It is recovering some and I hope by the time I switch them out the day after Thanskgiving they will be nice. I replace those at that time with poinsettias. I managed to save two reds and a golden one and the leaves look the best they have in years. Last year they looked fair but did not turn red until after Christmas. I am hoping they turn the colors they are supposed so they will look good after Thanksgiving and get better and better for Christmas. Next year I hope to repot them from plastic to very nice containers. The plan is to put all the display plants in nicer pots.

A few minutes later the shower became a downpour sufficient to cause run off into the gutters. The system officially began to collect rain water at 1:30 PM. I do not know how much was collected but there was a small stream into the barrel. The improvised debris filter did not fill up or overflow. I also noticed some of the rain on top of the barrels was allowing the standing water to drain into the barrels as well. The water is not potable but should work better than tap water for the plants and seedlings. Some of the leaves will add minerals to the soft rain water that should be beneficial to the plants and to the vermiposting redworms.I was reminded many of our Pacific storms bring driving rain from the south, southwest making the west side of the barn ideal for a gutter catchment system. I have plans for a water barrel silo in the future. In the meantime I should be able to place four barrels along the north side to collect 220 gallons collected off the barn. Building the greenhouse with gutter systems opened the door to catch rain from the house, the barn shed and the greenhouse. When fully implemented any rain should allow a good number of usable gallons of rainwater to allow our gardening efforts, the butterfly and bird sancturary and the water gardens to be practical and far less expensive than if we have to purchase city water. The city announced yesterday they would not pass the rising water costs to the consumer as we had expected from earlier plans. Eventually, I am sure they will and pass even higher costs along. Water in San Diego is expensive and not always of the highest quality. Today we took our first baby steps toward reducing the costs of our efforts to help the Monarch butterfly and grow our own organic vegetables, meat and eggs.

The rain barrels did collect a trace but not enough to even fill the manifold much less fill all four barrels. The chicks did fine. The got on their roost and moved under the covered portion. Then they got down and started foraging. I managed to finish the new perennial bed on the east side of the barn. Got all the sod removed and the edging blocks in place. I will start planting echinacea next spring afer I germinate some seed in the greenhouse. I will put them in those peat pots and plant the entire root ball pot and all. The next project is to dig out the plumbago roots on the west side of the barn. I want to mix butterfly bushes and milkweed along that section. Once the plumbago I am goin got keep for bird refuge and butterfly hosts I will start taking down the plumbago on the east bank. I want to put in a retaining wall on the east bank then let that hedge grow back. Part of that area will be storage for larger planting pots and a few more rain barrels. It was a nice day for chores between showers. I did crank up the convection oven to bake mini cornbread muffins to go with the 15 bean soup. Tommorrow I am making barley soup with veggies It wil likely warm back up but the autumnal weather was very welcome in our house.

Now that is is dried up, I can see no evidence of drips or leaks of anykind. I put some 1/4" hardware cloth below the spout to help screen large debris. It has been a couple of days since I opened the greenhouse doors due to the cold front. The vents opened anyway but the fan did not come on one day. Today I put two yesterday, today and tommorrow plants I had in containers in the ground on the east side of the barn. Yesterday, I finished the perrenial bed in preparation to putting in mixed echinacea plants. Sweet alyssum will be planted for a ground cover in the bed. I decided to put lantana on the west side of the house for butterfly magnet, heat and drought tolerant plants. They should look good along the entry walk accessing the middle yard. One the west side of the barn. I intend to add milkweed and butterfly bushes with alyssum as a ground cover That should smell nice and be attractive to guests coming in for parties or to visit the butterfly preserve and bird sanctuary. At the south end of the barn the plumbago to the top of the canyon drop will be kept trimmed to about four feet more or less for butterfly host and bird refuge. It should look really nice most of the year. I tried bark for a path but neighborhood cats like to use it for a litter box so I am either going to pave it or use river rock. I would like to get the new stock tank set up soon to give the water plenty of time to balance before I add fish. I also am eager to install the new windmill. I am still trying to decide which weathervane to purchase. i like one that has a butterfly and windspeed cups but I also like the traditional farm rooster. We don't plan to keep a rooster so that would be a nice touch. I am looking at two large terra cotta garden statues. One is a rooster and one is a hen. City Farmer nursery has them on display but I have not yet gotten the price. If I get the terra cotta rooster I will get the butterfly weather vane. The pullets did fine in their first rain. We have had heavy fog while they were in their coop but this is the first rain. The pullets got undercover for the hardest shower. The lighter showers they just kept right on foraging. I got some great photos in the canyon of a sunset. One looking back to the middle yard was really great of the barn, greenhouse reflecting sunset colors and the bank of blooming nectar plants below. I liked them so well I made a slideshow for the computer background. I had used webshots but they are now called smile and it is not working for me. It is free for now but as soon as their introduction is over they are going to charge some fee. I decided to take photos of Sucrhisto with the seasonal decorations and to use our own photos for backgrounds and screen savers. And all that costs is sweat equity. We already have a digital camera with the means to transfer photos from the disk to the laptop and elsewhere. Granted they are not as good as some professionals but they are ours and not all that bad.

I kept the house closed so it stayed comfortable without having to run the air. Turned the fans on late afternoon and had the house open befor 6 PM. I hung a barbed wire wreath on the barn front and addes some faux fall leaves. The barbed wire was part of a perimeter fence on one of Susie's sisters property in Texas. They sold the place but lived for a few years near the small town of Hawkins north of the I20 north of Tyler. I salvaged the wire when a change was made in the fence, It hung for years on the old windmill but may have found a permanent home as barn decor. Fred, the semi retired scarecrowl moved to a new home on the side of the barn to give us a little more pleasure while we enjoy the butterflies, birds, shade and view on a nice autumn day. I basically spent more time inside updating pan.netwith the photos and comments of our fall decorations. Webshots changed to something that is not working for us so I put our own photos on our computer backgrounds and screensavers. I put the same photos on pan.net Our football team plays on Monday night football this week but I did keep up with a few of the games while I rested. Buddy took a few sun baths in front of the barn. High pressure areas generally treat us kinder in the fall as the days are shorter and it usually cools down before dark so things are more pleasant. This year butterflies are very active. Monarchs are migrating but we still have some flitting about the yard. Gulf Fritillaries are still visiting. This year is the first year we had those and the Swallowtail Catepillars of both were found the last few days of summer so we anticipate a better year next year and in the years folling. An edible passionfruit wlll be added to the trellis by the chicken coop.rabbitry and more perennial nectar and host plants will be added. I will attempt to root the butterfly bush and germinate the California fascicularis milkweed for planting. All of the milkweed in containers are going in the ground. We are hoping some of the seed we scattered in the bottom of the canyon will germinate and self seed too.

I will put the tarp on the greenhouse early in the morning. Tommorrow, I will have to get moving to get the tarp on before the vent on the greenhouse opens. I will have to leave shortly afer for an early dental appointment. Today Buddy and i got out before the heat arrived and made a visit to the loal Wal Mart. We found some clip on decorations that will work great in the Flex and the Ranger at the rear view mirrors. I did not find the hoiiday lights in that store we were seeking so we drove on over to the nearby Home Depot. We had an interest in two of their lights but they were not LED so we looked at some edging stone options to build the bed at the foundation of the rain collection system on the north side of the greenhouse. We did not buy any but did get a few ideas. We went on the Grossmont Wal Mart and bought all of the lights we were seeking except a nativity scene. We want to put that on the west wall of the barn with a nativity star on the stem part of the gambrell roof. Passerbys in cars and on foot on Lynn will be able to see that well at night. We wanted to replace some of these last year and the year before but no one locally offered them. By the time we looked on the internet they were sold out or did not have enough for the sets we wanted. I tested a third of them to make sure they work before storing them. Buddy took a sunbath in front of the barn while i worked in the shade making hangers for the last two gold fish plants in black kettle pots. I got that task completed, the pots wiped down with auto trim detailer that we use on the Ranger and Flex and got them hung. The same treatment was given to the large cauldren that replaced the fuschia on the bench below the dining windows. The task was finished when I took photos to share with my sister and put on PAN. I decided it was too warm to crank up the grill for bison hot dogs. Decided a BLT on 3 seed Oatnut bread was just the ticket for dinner. Susie bought some Hawaiian Lua Barbque chips we both. I have the bacon done and draining, lettuce washed and tomatoes slice all ready to put the sandwhich together. Everyone is mad a me for predicting the lousy outcome of the Charger-Denver Monday night football game. I was gloating all day as it I have not like Norv Turner as much as others and have steadily grown to dislike AJ Smith every second he stays here. I do not like his drafts nor his trades nor his coaches. An elite football team has gone steadily downhill ever since the two of them came here.

Susie or I or we both tried to make that an annual event. The year we came on those they had one with a butterfly, one with a hummingbird and one with a rooster. With the idea some day we would have the Tuff Shed and a chicken coop I got those three. Granted the hose bibs from Home Depot eventually do patina to near the green on these they are nearly as classy. The Rooster lived in the front yard until it developed a slow drip that could not be repaired. When we got the Rain Soft system we removed the rooster and eliminated that outside bib for one controlled from inside the garage. At that time vandals were plaguing the neighborhood by turning hose and hose bibs on and allowing them to run and waste water. The hit the folks with no one at home in the daytime the hardest and the seniors that were not as active a lot. My neighbors were not as senior then but got hit one day when they went out to the doctors. I noticed water running out of his gravel he had replaced his lawn with. I shut it off and informed him when they got back. He said some of the neighbors had had the hose stuffed into the mailboxes and water flooded their living rooms. The original mail setups were flap covered slots through the front living room wall allowing mail pickup without going outdoors. My neighbor's solution was to remove his hose bib control handle to his shed. I decide to eliminate mine and operate another valve from the softer water from inside the garage that is locked or at least closed when no one is present in the front yard. I saved the bib thinking I might someday figure out how to repair it. A similar control with the butterfly handle was installed on the hose bib in the middle yard. A hummingbird was on the control that replaced the valve in the canyon. When I installed the hose bib outside the greenhouse it had a plain Home Depot valve that patinaed so did not look too bad. I got the bright idea to replace that with the hummingbird in the canyon and put it there and use that hose bib for the valve from another rain collection system when I add 220 gallons for the barn. I will use the rooster handle control in the canyon. I turn off that entire section when not in for various reasons so the slow drip will not waste water as I plan to plant some cannas that would benefit greatly with needing to ever water them. Now to make the time to do that. Another quick project is to move the hanging hook for the front living room window geranium. When the arbor was there the hanging basket had to be located closer to the street. We could see it but Susie will be able to enjoy the basket from the chair she likes to use in the living room. That window catches a breeze often in the summer and has a nice whiff of the night blooming jasmine on occasion when it blooms. Those geraniums do well even though the west side heat is one of the highest of all the microclimates on our property. I have been working on some peppermint ivy geraniums to rotate in Christmas season. I am trying to find a true orange geranium for fall. They are now available but the local nurseries are on waiting lists trying to get them. My name has not yet been called. Hopefully two baskets of peppermint ones will be ready this season for the dining room windows. Eventually I will get cuttings rooted for the west side hangings too. The peppermint ones have a history. A friend of ours, Johm Lum, was an elder at La Mesa Church of Christ and a very successful inventor. As one of his retirement projects he salvaged planter boxes being discarded by the Jack in the Box chain for an area at the church. He planted them with the peppermint geraniums. I am not sure if they were new at that time or he just liked them or he got them cheap. The rest of that story is I took a cutting of them when I first moved to this property because I could not afford many plants at the time. Now John has gone on to his reward but is still remembered as I work with those plants. I nearly lost them all at one time but managed to save a small plant. That plant is doing welll and so is another one I got to thrive this summer. It is ready to be a mother plant so I am hoping to trim it back and get a start or two rooted in the greenhouse over he winter. Hopefully next year five of them will be in great form for the winter season display. The can hang through Valentines Day. Along about Easter the salmon pink ones look fine with the plastic Easter egg hidden in plain sight with those season decorations. Seasonal decorations have become a year round passion of mine. The Christmas offerings were upgraded today after the recession years stripped most of the stores in this area of the lights we like to use. Today Walmart provided two Santa faces, A Merry Christmas sign, two double bell lights, two window christmas tree lights, two angels, and two nativity stars. I only need one star but got a spare at the price they were offered. I plan to display that on the wet steep slope of the gambrel room on the barn over a lighted wall display on the west wall of a nativity scene. I also got a candy cane path marker light set of four and snowman path marker light set of four.They are of higher quality than some of the ones we are using and some of the ones they are replacing had failed altogether. I am going to move the large lighted soldier to the back and leave the plant bench under the dining windows. The snowmen will go in front of the planter while the angel goes between the two dining windows. To put he soldier on guard where he normal sentinals from would require all the plants to be moved. Small poinsettias will allow the summer and fall plants to rotate for replacement or reconditioning. Some will be permanently removed to the patio with other plants to replace them next spring. I am hoping to do some bulb offerings after the poinsettias rotate to there rest area. I want to repot them into higher quality containers when they are cut back for next years growth.

I had to go early to a dental appointment but had time to get the metalized tarp on the greenhouse. I decided to grow some veggies in the unit over winter. I needed another table for the rotated fuschias so I moved one from the greenhouse. It was not one of the three that match the unit. It works really well behind the barn. That site is shaded in the winter. It doesn't matter in the summer as those plants hang on the patio and or on display in front. It was hot by the time I got out of the dentist office making me very glad I left Buddy at home this time. I took some time to play with him before I moved the fuschias to the relocated plant shelving. I spent part of the day misting the greenhouse and adjusting as it was getting near 100 degrees. It was some cooler in there so I took a few minutes to repot some cactus. I finally caved in and decided it is just too hot a fall day for me but managed to get to Rooster aluminum hanging hooks mounted on either side of the barn doors. I got the bright idea after seeing a nice Christmas swag in Home Depot that would be a neat thing to do with our barn. It is a really narrow space so I decided to make my own. I will start with a fall offering. I know there is a pine cone garland I hated to throw out but not longer used that might be just the ticket hanging on those rooster hooks. It is six foot long at least so I figured to cut it in half. It has factor loops o a red rope connecting the cones so they would just slip right on the hooks making it easy to put up and take down. I have some similar hooks of a sunflower I decided would be good on the back of the barn to hang the hanging wires that need to be removed so the pots fit easily on the three shelves of the bench being used for them. If we had a hard freeze I can move them easily to the greenhouse for a few days then put them back to get them in prime condition to display. It is suppose to cool down tommorrow then maybe drizzle Friday. The first 220 gallon rain collection system is complete and has been tested for leaks waiting for rains to collect water. I decided to build out the bank on the south west corner of the greenhouse and put four barrels on that side. I decide the barrels would shade that vent and venturi effect of air passing the barrels should help cool the greenhouse on hot days. Might try filling that side with water to see if it will help regulate the greenhouse temps.

It was a bit muggy for some of the day but felt less and less so as the day progressed. Never did see the sun.It was a high of 80 but never was really uncomfortble. I did perspire a lot mowing and edging the front lawn but was so thankful it was not 100 degrees it was not bad at all. I did some minor trimming in the front and middle yards and ended up putting four green recycle bins to the curb for pick up tommorrow. The problem neighbor created another incident with a dog off leash I called the police and got a royal run around. I just flat out told them to forget it I would take the vigilante action the animal control depeartment suggested and they could arrest me after I was through. Forty minutes later they called to say they were sending officers. Almost two hours later two fellows did show up..hear my rant..decided I had a legitimate beef as they had to wait long periods to get assistance from animal control. The did talk to one of men involved in the off leash incident and advised him he best clean up the trash on city property or be fined. They reported back to me later they did not expect compliance as he fellow has a "drug" problem. After they left, I moved the hanging hook and chain used to display geraniums on the west side. It now allows Susie to enjoy the blooms from her favorite glider rocker near that window. The day after Thanksgiving I can rotate those out for the peppermint Ivy geraniums that can go through Valentine's Day. I will try to root at least two more in the greenhouse for next season to hang in front of the dining room windows. I am trying to aquire a true orange to use for fall if it is anywhere near the hue of photos I have seen. I have been looking for a board to make a Suchristo sign. I have had one all along. I took some walking closet shelves out to put in a closet organizer and saved the shelf board. I found letters at Michael's that are reasonably priced for the wording. I plan to burn our brand on one side and shape the board to hang in front with an address number. Eventually we hope to bring folks here who are interested in our butterfly efforts to share thoughts and ideas.

My friend Sammy, the metal junk man was back in the hood picking up a refrigerator. I had tried to talk to my neigjbor about a washer he had sitting out. I did catch his wife but she could not tell me if was alright for Sam to pick it up if no one was home. He came in late last night so we never got to talk. Her car was gone early but he did not answer the door. Sam tried and left his number so I went back to my task on the west access. I am taking down the overgrown kukuya grass hoping the wild sunflowers will sprout when the rains start. They look nice over on the access until spring rains stop. I found some long wisteria runners that make nice wreaths. I took a brake from the grass abatement and made two wreaths for the barn. I used aluminum sunflower hanging hooks for the wreaths. I had gotten some fall berries and leaves at Michaels to decoreate the barb wire wreath that now hang on the front of the barn. Some of that was left over so I put a few sprigs on each wreath. They look nice enough the way they. I will add some poinsettias or holly leaves and berries for the Christmas offerings. The rest of the year they will look fine bare. Buddy would not come out and help so I am taking some time after lunch to spend time with him. I think he got upset when I left him inside to bring in the green recycle bins. I tried some roottone on a peppermint ivy geranium to make the basket a little nicer for Christmas. Maybe it will root and maybe it won't. If it does I will be ahead of the game trying to root two more hanging baskets for next year. I want to get white baskets to repot them in next year. The dark green ones are looking tired and so far I have not found true green to replace them. My birthday dinner is tommorrow. A few friends are coming over here to ride to the Red Sails Inn. I am hoping to show them the progress made on the farm since the last time they were here. That was August 8 when they helped put the greenhouse top on the sidewalls. I had the chicken coop installed but the chickens were not here until August 11. The Tuff Shed was not yet installed and the plumbago hedge was not even trimmed back much less taken all the way to the ground. My green recycle bins are empty again so I might go ahead and take the rest of the hedge down. A winter type storm up north is supposed to bring a chance of drizzle the next few days. Maybe it will drip enough to collect some rain in the barrels.

I was out front looking for Susie's car when I saw my neighbor drive up. He definately wants Sammy to come and get the appliance. He found he note I left on his door and said he would call right away. I decided to put away the tools and get ready to kick off the weekend. I finished the bulk of the fall cleanup on the west side. I am going to wait a little longer for the wisteria leaves to yellow and dry a little more before I strip it for the winter. I decided to put the rooster aluminun hooks on the west side of the barn and hang the three wisteria wreaths there. I am going to get those Martha Stewart Christmas swags at Home Depot for the east side. I will use the toy soldier on the east side when the scarecrow comes down. I am also going to put the candy canes in the new perrenial bed I just built. Tommorrow some friends are coming over to ride with us in the Flex to Red Sails Inn. Christopher and I will celebrate our birthdays. His is October 12 and mine is the 28th. I am hoping the possible drizzle is a little more than a misty fog. There is a storm front bring rain, cold and snow to Washinton and Oregon. It is supposed to dip down and affect our weather. I am more than ready for nice cool autumn air. I have barley soup all ready to go for the weekend.

Early this morning there was a tiny bit of drizzle but not enough to really wet the ground or catch any water in the rain collection system. I decided to take it easy and putter since we are going out later for a birthday dinner for Chris and for me. He celebrates his birth day October 13 and I am a almost Halloween baby on the 28. I used the last three rooster aluminum hanging hooks on the west side of the barn. The wisteria wreaths look good on that side. I hung similar hooks of sunflowers on the east side of the barn yesterday. I will hang two more of those on the south side or back later. They will be useful there for a place to hang the pot hanging devices when I remove them to put the baskets on a three tier plant staging bench. That is a nice shady spot to winter fuschias and to place impatiens. Later the impatiens go in the greenhouse for the winter. Fuschias love cool and need cold to get them ready for next year. The hooks on the east side of the barn will get tear drop or swag arrangements. I like some Martha Stewart Chirstmas swags Home Depot is offering. Big Lots just put some autumn tear drops on sale I want to look at. I did not find any at Michael's I liked but i am going back and look again. I need something narrow for the front of the barn . I have a pine cone garland I have not been using anywhere I think can be cut in half and be perfect fro the front of the barn. It is supposed to be cooler and chance of rain the next few days. I have to get som plastic and aluminun and glass recycling in to a center. As soon as Buddy and I get that chore done we will start work on the last part of the plumbago hedge. Over the rest of fall and winter we will dig out the plumbago roots from the south corner of the barn to the butterfly bush. The section from the front edge of the barn to the top of the canyon will be allowed to grow back and kept pruned to four feet to act as a bird refuge and butterfly host plus a privacey screen of the downhill neighbor. I found a windmill I can afford that is functional to areate small ponds. Buddy and I will visit a feed store in Santee that carries the rubbermaid stock tanks. I think we will get a 300 gallon with automatic fill for a fish pond. As soon as my social security kicks in and I can budget for the windmill we will add that then start to put in path access material..Might even cement the path in sections. I can mix small batches and finish with patterns. I have hummingbird and butterfly molds might be just the ticket with color added for interest and variety.

It has also been breezy, not quite blustery, but not calm by any means. I has not been over 67 degrees at any point. As I puttered with the wreaths and a few other odd tasks I noticed the greenhouse vents partially opened.Checking inside, I immediately noticed it was much warmer than outside. The thermometer told me it was 82 degrees. I noticed no drafts from the partially open lower vent. While inside I watered the Santa Claus fuschia that is in recovery from the last heat wave beating it took. When I water fuschias I use a water soluble fertilizer about half strength and feed them at almost every watering. Being heavy feeders they seem to stay looking nicer and bloom better with that method. Later Susie wanted to put out bath mats she had washed to dry. I suggested she hang them in greenhouse to dry faster and prevent birds and bird see or blowing dust getting on them. We are going to grow summer vegatbles like patty pan squash in there too. I can make two half barrel planters for ten bucks each using the same green barrels I used for the rain collection system. I will use white barrels for behind the barn. I like the green color for half barrel planters too. They are much lighter than the wooden ones making it easier to get them on and off the truck cut in half and moved to the canyon or to the greenhouse.Another advantage is they do not rot, rust or put splinters in my hands if I forget to put on gloves. I still have a lot to learn for greenhouse growing but I am sure excited to see how warm it stays even on cool days like today. That tells me we should have far greater success germinating seeds. By the time most folks around here plant for last frost date we will have strong plants to go into the ground. We like summer squash in a lot of our favored meals so it will be advantageous to grow them year round. I have the tomatos in a fifteen gallon pot and they are booming. All because of the even tempeartures and filtered sunlight protecting them through the heat wave, cold snap, another heat wave and now cold again. Plus I do not have to go into the house if I get chilled and let valuable furnace heat out of the house. I still enjoy a burn barrel where I use the short scraps of limbs and lumber to burn in a washer tub. We also use the tub on camping trips for a firepit. Some folks in these parts refer to them as volcano pits The flickering firelight dances around the specators watching as the light goes through the small holes in the tub . Nice entertainment at night when enjoying the company of good friends or each other.

The section of freeway where it started is known for Cal Trans rain bird sprinkers overspraying onto the roadway so I was not sure at first. By the time we traveled the connector to 94 east it was wetting the highway.By the time we got home and greeted Buddy and got into our lounging clothes I checked the rain barrels and there had not been enough drizzle to start collection. This morning, I slept in a little bit and checked for the morning paper. It was not there but everything was wet and about the same amount of drizzle was occuring. I had breakfast and took a look at the barrels. Water was dripping slowly from the gutter downpout into the system. Every little drop will help. The prediction is to have drizzle and light showers today and for the next couple of days. Even this small amount is going to help the lawn and hedges and a few or the ornamentals. I have not seen any catepillars but I am still a novice when it comes to knowldege of when they do what. I still see Gulf Frittillaries and Monarchs in the yard. There are others but I don;t chekc on or photograph them. They are here every year. I did discover the cabbage white has been hosting on the nasturtiums and they have incresed in numbers. I have some nasturtium nearly year round. Others reseed and come in the rainy months. When I get to it, one project is to install a border to create a bed for jewel nasturtiums at the foot of the rain collection system. One to host bytterlies, two for eye appeal and three to screen the support blocks and manifold of the rain collection sytem.The nasurtiums should do well in that partially shaded spot in the poor soil that is not always well watered. Our idea to put the bath mats in the greenhouse to dry paid off. They were not dry when we left for the party. If we left them out they would have been wet in the drizzle. And added benefit we never considered when we were looking at reasons to justify the expense of the luxury of a greenhouse.

The official recording says .06 since midnight. I looked in the hole where I cut out for a one gallon container to be used as a filter and saw the bottom of the first barrel is indeed covered completely about an inch or more deep. That means the manifold is also full and each of the other three barrels should have that amount as water sought its own level. It almost got sunny so the greenhouse warmed and the vents began to creep open to regulate the temp. I also came up with an idea to use the damaged gutter parts without sending off and paying for new ones. Long story why they did not want to replace them but bottom line is I am not real happy with their gutter system anyway. I am going to try to JB Weld them. The downpipes and downspouts are okay. The hangers are okay and so are the clamps so it should look even better than the one installed now. I will build out where the bank drops off so I can have four barrels on the south side. That side should get more rain as a lot of our winter rains blow in from the south and west. I decided to go ahead an place a barrel in front of the bottom louver vent as it will shade the vent and theroetically pull cooler air into the greenhouse on super hot days. And breeze should venturi effect around the barrel allowing plenty of fresh air to enter the greenhouse. If it does not work it is easy enough to take that barrel out. When I tie that side in to the prelimed pipe that feeds the hose bib inside I will also tie in the north side system to provide a possible 440 gallons of collected water to be used. So far the pros of this greenhouse outway the negatives so I am generally pleased with it. It has opened the door of my mind about capturing rainwater so we have the potentional to collect a lot of basically free water. The low cost of the collection system should be recovere in a month or two of buying city water then after the payback it is basically free water. And I have plans for a good filter to assure clean rain water for the chickens and rabbits to drink. This will reduce the cost of producitn free range organic high Omega 3 eggs and rabbit meat and pelts. With the functional windmill our cost of the ornamental fish pond will be reduced in we will not buy as much electricity, if any, to aerate the pond. I still hope to use gray water filtered through water hyacinths to produce very clean water for our water features. One of our friends at my, and Christopher's birthday celebration last night, commented : "The worlds best chicken" when told we had Rhode Island Red pullets on the farm. He hails from that neck of the woods and has seen the museum and statue honoring a well respected fowl developed in their part of the United States. It was very enjoyable visiting one of the oldest eateries in our city plus I got a nice gift card for Home Depot. I wanted to get some paint to match the barn to paint the handles of some of my tired garden tools and make them look matched to our theme. I also want to get some cement mix to lock the bottom two garden steps in place so i do not have to keep releveling them after each rainy season. The stairs were made from repurposed broken concrete and blocks salvaged from here and there. If there is enough I may get a few edging blocks and build that nasturtium bed I want to hide the rain collection manifold pipes and support blocks. I am pleased we collected any amount of water considering the small amount of rain we have received. And we are getting a slow soaking making it very beneficial to the lawn and flower beds The garden is mostly summer vegetables at the end of their production but the rain certainly cannot hurt. The chickens huddled on the steps of their nesting boxes as their daytime roost was wet with some of the drizzle blowing in where they like to sit. As soon as the drizzle stopped they were on the ground scratching and foraging. The Peanuts Christmas windsock we ordered from Current was on the porch when we arrived home. Also two stacking chair covers. I was even happier with the ones they sent. We had a price far less than any we saw locally and the ones they sent are reversible. One side is dark green almost the same shade of the greenhouse. The other side is that geen and white stripes..Could not have for a better quality or deal at that price. I was going to get one earlier in the year and did not. When I returned the next day it was spld and the store never got any more in. I never found nay locally until Current put these on sale at the end of the season. We got two so we can add four more stacking chairs next season. I would like to get the middle yard finished to have some cookouts. One of our friends suggested a barn warming. All I had to say was I should have thought of that myself.

I filled out a form I had inventoried all the parts when I had damaged parts to finish the greenhouse roof. Rion shipped two incorrect base sections as well. Both parts were marked correctly but proved to be the shorter sections mislabeled. Distributor sent the wrong sections to replace the ones in errror. The third try they got it right. One of the roof parts was defective and would not fit. It finally broke. The new part was correct and installed easily. By the time I got the roof onto the sidewalls i had to drop off the completion to finish other deadlines. When I got back to install the rain gutters the down spout connector on gutter connector parts were found to be damaged. I was not about to buy the parts and decided to do what I am very good at and cobble them together. Today, I used salvage stainless steel screws and assembled the main gutter at the eaves for the south side of the greenhouse. I had to do some grade work to allow space for a fourth barrel so most of that was done. I also had some grading problems causing slip/trip hazards along the east side of the unit. That area is the east access to the greenhouse and to the garden steps going to the canyon portion of the yard. I still have more work to do but the hazard has been removed. As soon as I set the cement blocks I will be ready to assemble the system. I have to get four pvc male thread to female slip at Home Depot. I also need anotehr elbow and a ten foot section of pvc. While I am out I am going to drop by Barrels and totes and purchase two more green barrels to finish the job. That will give us the potental to collect 440 plus gallons from the greenhouse. I am going to use similar white barrels for the barn system. That system will also serve as plant staging shelves for fuschias and impatiens at time of rotation. That system needs locally aquired gutter and downpout parts and eight cement blocks puls the tees/elbows and pipe. I wiill do both sides with the anticipation of collecting most of the runoff from storm blowing in from the south west. I believe the first storm would have collected water from the greenhouse if I had the south gutters and barrels on at that time. The side I had connected did not collect much as it was on the protected side on one cell that came through. The last system definately collected water but would have collected at least twice as much if that other side had been finished. I expect the big collector to be the house and patio but that is at least a year away. It was a nice cool, almost blustery day with some sunshine peeking through. The greenhouse was nice and warm and the fan did come on in mid afternoon. The vents opened mid morning. I did see a Monarch butterfly flitting about. Some of the milkweed is blooming. Some that had been munched on are recovering nicely. I am hoping some of the seed I put in the canyon will sprout in these early rains and establish another patch in the floor of the canyon. When I get the rain collection system finished on the south side of the greenhouse I want to border a plant on the north side. I may do a raised bed on the south side. I am thinking that may be a better spot for the bed i made from the old picnic table than where I put it while trying to decide a good place for it. I want to do sunflowers and that hot dry spot up by the greenhouse may be a good location. Easy to get to to tend and plant but out of the way so any butterfly caterpillars would be protected. A high pressure system is predicted bringing a warm up over the weekend. I held off covering the air conditioners for the winter. It is predicted to be in the 90's. I have had enough of warm. I loved the last few days of drizzle and clouds. I wore shorts but had on a tshirt too. I do not mind jeans, flannel and maybe even my denim western jacket.

When I go back I will glue the elbows on each of the four male thread to female slip adapters. All four of these get a tee so one end can connect to the line coming from the other side and that can connect to the pipe I prelimed to the hose bib inside the greenhouse. I have another hose bib to connect to the downspout end to allow a hose connect do put water in some of the barrels at the bottom of the canyon steps. I think the rain gutters will not leak but to be sure, since one side is cobbled together I will get a tube of silicone designed specifically for sealing/cementing plastic gutter connections. I will put a five inch gutter on the barn eaves since part of that roof is so steep I do not want to lose rain on a hard storm spilling over the gutter. I have seen four inch gutters here overflow. My preferance is to put on six inch gutters and I will do that on the house since it will be largest runoff contributor of all my systems. The systems so far look good even with them in plain site. I hung the new Christmas swags on the barn so Susie can get a preview when she gets home. I think they look great there and will give holiday cheer for out seasonal get togethers. The totes and barrels supplier moved about two weeks ago but are actually easier to get into, better parking off street. have a better system to shop and all the barrels are inside in a warehouse type buidling. They have a lot more in stock and new offerings. I can pull into their, load and leave without having to risk a uturn in the street. The new location is closer to the house and that never hurts at todays fuel prices. Hopefully I can have this system done, tied together with the first half before the heat builds again over the weekend. It is supposed to be windy and high eighties to nineties Friday, Saturday, Sunday and starting to abate Monday..September and October are known to be our two hottest months.

When I purchased the can of C65 primer/cleaner it was found to be half full. If that can had the correct amount stated on the can I could have finished. I helped a neighbor put a new light assembly in his Chevy and cooked Susie's second favorite dish of spaghetti squash lasagna. Bu the time I got all that finished and started on the rain barrel connections I realized I did not have enough to finish the project. I never go out this late in the day due to crowds and traffic and Susie will be home soon for dinner. I will go out early tommorrow and try to finish before the high pressure moves in. It is supposed to be warm Friday, breezy and hot Saturday and warm Sunday. I fed the pullets some of the spaghetti squash and seeds. They ate of lot of both. Squash seeds should be good for them for general health. I am going to start artificial light for them the first week of December. The first week they get an hour of light. I will increase the light until they get the full amount of light needed to help them lay eggs.

Buddy and I were going to Home Depot but I decided he half can of purple primer would work. I wanted the clear primer on the north side as that is the side seen from the yard and patio. The south side usually has ground cover, geraniums or lantana blocking the view of the manifold pipes from the lower canuon portion of the yard. I was careful in using the purple cleaner so it does not show much anyway. I gpt the four barrels tied together. To tie in to the pipe I buried that is leading into the greenhouse hose bib will take some jostling of the pipes to connect I decided to let the glue dry really well to reduce any risk of having leaks. No chance of rain for the next four or five days anyway. A high pressure area is moving in. It is not hot yet but it is a lot warmer than yesterday and the wind has been higher than usual all morning. This is a true Santa Anna in their are winds with it. My defensible space  exceeds the reccommended but I do not like the wild fires nor the smoke that clogs up filters in the house and vehicles. My doctors alwasy urge me to wear a mask that I find uncomfortable  to wear. I decided to take down some more of the plumbago hedge. It will be grown back by the time the butterflies that use it for a host need it. We usually have a lot of birds use it in spring and early summer but it has to be done and now is a good time. The rains should help it recover fast and look good for a few years. There is no rush in digging out the roots on the twelve plus feet that I do not want to grow back. I will take some butterfly bush cuttings next spring and hope to have californica fascicularis seeds germinated to plant in gallon pots sometime next year. Once I start the flats of Omega 3 forage in the geenhouse I can put the flats on top of the south side rain barrels in the full sun for fast growth. In the cold months I can stage them in the greenhouse. Most of the year I do not have to be concerned by too fast of growth as I should be able to keep four flats growing to be ready to feed to the chickens. As I move one to the coop I can take the started flat out of the greenhouse and replace it. There will be a learning curve to see how fast the two chickens destroy a flat before the next one has to go in. When I put the baby chicks in August 11 there was some stalks of millet and a few cannas I left in after the construction. As the chicks grew they scratched and pecked at that greenery until it is now all gone. They also try to get to any grass through the wire they think they can reach. I put mowed clipping in two or three times a week in the summer and about once a week in the slower growing season. I also feed them them trimmed squash, tomatoes etc from cooking and a few millet seed heads from places it self sowed from the bird feeders. The tomato that volunteered from one of the previous years plants is blooming already in the greenhouse. II have about a month to extend electricity to the coop for light to extend daylight. I will suspend a green extension cord for until I run the permanent installation to the unit. I have an orange extension suspended from the patio through the elm to a lavatara to the arbor into the greenhouse now. That is temporary. With the way gopher damaged my watering systems and plants and yard I am not going to put regular romex underground or plastic conduit. It will cost more but I won't lose the power to gopher chews then have to dig things up to find where they chewed.

Techinically this is my second greenhouse, Susie's first, but I paid for but never got delivery or set up the first one. That is a story I shall not go into here. It was over thirty years ago but I never gave up dreaming. What is will write here is you have had dreams taken away, for what ever reason, do not give up. Not to say I did not try several times to drop it now I am happy to report I am most happy I did not. Every day since this greenhouse arrived I have gloated. And now that is actually in service with a lot more extras than the first one I bought I continue to thrill. Today took out one of the summer squash to use the plant cage for the tomato in the greenhouse. I think the jostling of putting it in the container the two tomato plants are in will be suffiecient to help pollinate. Both plants are blooming but I cannot tell if the fruits are setting. Not being sure the oscillating fan is enough &quot;wind&quot; to polinate it and fairly sure no bees are going through the open doors or vents I am going to use the home gardener indoor method of &quot;bumping the cage as I pass through or am doing other chores inside the greenhouse. I am going to try using repurpose food jars for airtight seed storage. I use some of the natural small peanut butter jars for assorted hardward storage in the barn and in the garage. I started out years ago with baby food jars made of glass. As times and technology changed I switched to the plastic for their lighter weight and for safety. I dropped one or two of the baby food jars along the way and some of them shattered. I have yet to shatter a plastic one. Anyway, this morning I came up with the idea to reuse the jars for seed storage as I have now built and excess again after setting up new storage in the barn. I use various size jars for different things. When we got our current motorhome we searched for food canisters for its petite galley counter. I finall discovered the plaxtic rectangular mayonaise and miracle whip jars were perfect. A set for quinoa, barley, oats and grits set perfecty behind the range top and with slight pressure wedge between the top and the wall. The motorhome rides on air but we have hit a few rough spots along the highways and byways. A ceramic lightouse that sits above the entry door moved forward about two inches on an I20 stretch about the middle of Jackson, Missisippi west bound in 2006. In 2008, detouring around swollen rivers at Illinoise.Indiana borders that close I 80 on both direction I dropped into a hole crossing railroad tracks on the Lincoln Highway trying to find a detour to get back on the path we chose to get to Midland Michigan. I hit so hard I thought I had tipped off a front leveling jack and done undercarriage damage. Things on the counter rattled but nothing moved out of the spots they set in. And I found no damage at all underneath when I checked. It was the worst jolt we have had in this rig. But the subject is greenhouse gardening and related issues. I have a rolling gardening unit that transforms into a cart, potting bench and small weight dolly I am using for miscellanous things. But I am looking for a container to sit the jars in that will allow all of them to be moved as needed or one of two jars can be taken out.I found the perfect plastic containers for storing vermiculite, perlite, seed starting soils, ironite, sul po mag etc. The are so close a green match to the color of the greenhouse frame most eyes cannot tell any shading difference. And they are affordable. The problems is if Totes and barrels will get enough to meet my needs. I have one in use already. Those containers not only help give things a neat and organized look they are functional with their screw on tops to prevent anything from getting wet or ruined when the misting for cooling or watering drips occur. Later today I will finish tieing in the south side rain collection system to the pipe I installed during installation of the greenhouse. Those last connections will allow water retrieval via hose or from the hose bib to fill buckets or watering containers from inside the greenhouse. All water collected can be drained from all the barrels due to the bibs being lower than all the barrels. Time will tell if my experiment to grow tomatoes in the greenhouse is going to work. I saved some bell pepper seeds I want to try in the greenhouse as well. There are ladybugs developed especially for greenhouses to control the greenhouse whitefly. I have not noticed any whiteflys anywhere in the city farm but I have sources to get them just in case. I am also eager to get the chicken forage flats going soon. The chicks should start laying eggs late December or early January and I would like to have them on the Omega 3 forage before they start. The pullets are clucking more and more and getting bigger. They now eat out of my hand and do not protest when I am doing chores in the coop. Buddy checks on them several times a day. I figure Cindy LouWho will peck him on his nose one of these days. She has pecked the camera lens, my boots, my hand and me several times. I figure she will be the very one to peck that nose when Buddy presses it against the wire. I have told him what might happen but he still likes to get a close look at the situation..and I figure is she pecks him on the snoz he will still go back to check on things. such is life.

The last step will be to insert the hose bib in the adapter outside the greenhouse. Plastic drill debris and saw debris did wash out on the flush. I might have clogged the hose bib shutoff but might not have. I plugged the pipes to put enough water in for the flush and did not see any leaks. While waiting for the last flush water to drip out and the pipes to dry I set a half cement block to give some protection to the plastic pipes going into the ground. Unless some drastic unforseen happens, I should have the second part of the rain collection system online by the end of the day.The two sides have the potential to collect 440 gallons of rain water. At the water rates we currently pay the system will pay back in one season or less. Every year after that is collecting free water. The entire system cost under $180 dollars. Other places would be cheaper with sumilar barrels available for free or about five bucks a barrel. I am happy to have found a source of food grade barrels close to the house that sells them for 18 dollars plus tax if two or more are purchased at one time. They have three colors available white, blue and green in the style I got. All have the same two bungs with one being very easy to convert for pvc pipe connection.For thirty dollars they have fifty five gallon terra cotta collored drunks that look similar to giant jars. Screw on lids make it easy to reach inside for a slighty different variation or connections to assembly collection sysgems. I do want to use some of those for the patio east side that will also double as help to hold the bank in case of record rains. Water in those barrels in rainy season would work well as a weighted wall. When the bank is dry it does not slip. In 2005, we had our third most wet winter and that banks slipped onto the patio slab. I had to remove over 18 feet of dirt when it dried out enough to work. I knew folks who hired engineers to advise and were blled thousands of dollars. More thousands of dollars were spent hiring city approved contractors to remove or replace the slides. Some homes were condemmed in some very posh neighborhoods. I made a call and was told it would take four months just to talk to someone much less anyone come out.  I will let all the glue connections dry overnight and add just enough water to test the hose bib inside and let it sit through the hot, dry weekend to do a real good test for leaks. It is 9% humidty now. As soon as I connect the last ppipe and dress up the work site I need to water the south canyon on soaker hose to compensate for the low humidity.

We have the potential to collect 440 gallons in the eight barrels. Each barrel should collect very close to the fiftyfive gallons they are designed to hold. Plus the manifolds that connect the barrels should hold a bit more. The south side can be drained from a hose bib near the west end of the greenhouse or from a hose bib inside the greenhouse. While making the connections, tests and other tasks related to the project I could not help but notice two Monarch butterflies visiting the nectar plants and milkweed in various spots in the garden. I also managed to feed the hanging plants in the front and west side, the plants on the bench in front of the dining room windows and the gallardia displayed in the autumn pots. The plants on the patio got fed as well as the plants staging behind the barn. Tommorrow I will feed the canyon geraniums, milkweed and a few other plants. I also staked the greenhouse tomatoes. I have two volunteers in a fifteen gallon pot that came up from seeds from last years plants. I transplanted them a couple of weeks ago and they have already surpassed the ones I had in the garden early. It was so cool back then it took a long time to get them going. The greenhouse experiment is very exciting at the growth rate and how strong those plants look. Some wind goes in the end doors that are left open to help cool on warmer days. An oscilatting fan may also help but I jostle the cage from time to time when I am inside the greenhouse or passing through. Green tomatoes should be showing in a few days if the efforts to pollinate are working. Besides finishing the rain collection system I also did some improvements on the hose bib used to hook up the seeper hoses that water a lot of the east bank in the canyon and some of the south bank plus west runs to the street. Before I complete those improvements I will make it easier to get to the manifold with the shutoffs to control all of the runs connected to it. The system works good but I am now required to get down on my knees to operate the valves. When I finish the valves will be higher and easier to access. They will also be numbered and instruction put on a flash drive on which valves to operate and how long they need to seep in case my son or someone else has to take charge of the watering. All in all it was a very productive day. The project being completed now are now as obvious as the greenhouse being built or the barn but they are very satisfying to the long term plans for Suchristo Farms.

It has now jumped up to 81 degrees. Got the greenhouse open and the main house closed. Barn is still cool inside with the doors closed. I tidied up the pipe and fittings and put away the pipe thread tape. I have the pvc pipe and fittings to do the barn collection system on hand. I will start with installing a rain gutter on the west side soon. Probably will go with the five inch plastic gutter system. Have to buy two sections for that side since they come in ten foot lengths.  Likely I will put up two six foot sections with the splice in the middle, one end cap and one downpout to fill the barrels at the back of the barn. If I can figure a way to safely simulate a silo with three barrels stacked atop one another I will collect rain from the east side too. If not I am using four white barrels on blocks at the north end or back side of the barn. The blocks will sit on the old clothesline section of slab that was poured when the house was built in 1950. I am going to use the barrel tops for fuschia staging when not being displayed. The greenhouse is too warm for the fuschias most of the time. If we have an extreme cold spell they can easily move inside the greenhouse. The location behind the barn gets good airflow and sun protection in the shade cast by the barn. I can also stage impatiens there to get them in prime condition to hang on the patio or display for public viewing at the front of the house. I want to start working on the electric runs to serve the barn, windmill area, chicken coop/rbbitry and the greenhouse. I want to install outdoor protected GFI receptacles for seasonal lights and other uses. Future plans are to string seasonal lights on the windmill tower as it can be seen by our cross canyon neighbors and folks at the canyon mouth. Also pedestrians and vehicles using Lynn street off Streamview can see the windmill. I decided the angle is not that good to display a nativity scene and plants will eventually go in the area where the plumago hedge is being removed. I am displaying wistera wreaths with seasonal addendums now. I may use the led spotlights on timer or solar lights but that is a future project. The big push now is to  finish the plumbago hedge. The part I am cutting now will be take to the ground but I do not have to be as ruthless with shearing as much off as I can without digging. Some of the part that is going to be allowed to grow back is already starting to show green. I am hoping the hedge will be recovred enough by summer to allow refuge for some of the birds that use it in spring and summer. As it grows back I can concentrate on removing the roots of the section that will be totally removed.  Monarchs are using the milkweed in containers on the east side of the barn. I will some of the seeds sprouting in those containers in the ground if they survive the transplant shock. I have some narrow leaf milkweed seeds in the refrigerator getting their three months of cold stratification. Hopefully some of those will germinate to go in the ground to reseed themselves into a thick stand for the Monarchs. I am now sure we have more than one variety the Painted Lady clan..I am not sure which ones they are but the ones I am seeing are definately not Gulf Frittillaries and are not exactly like the Painted Lady photos I am looking at. Some might be West Coast Ladies but I need to get some photos if I can and try to study them to be sure. Same with our Swallowtails. I am almost sure we have more than one variety but which ones I am not  able to say for certain. I found what I belive are milkweed plants that self seeded in two of the five gallon tropical milkweed pots. I managed to get a dozen plants into jiffy pots. If just have of these grow I will have a great start for the stand I want to establish on the west side of the barn. I want to broadcast sweet alyyssum as a ground cover that smells nice plus attracts lady beetles and butterflies too. The California native milkweed is just about ready to plant. Some seeds are getting cold stratification in the refridgertor. When the three months has passed I plan to try and germinate them in the greenhouse in jiffy pots for planting later next year. I also made a pvc tool for when the metalized shade has to be used on the greenhouse. It will be real handy to help adjust the tarp as the roof vent opens. I was using the downpout and end cap for the gutter system but they are now installed and in use as part of the rain collection system. I am slowing but surely getting things organized for full scale operation of the greenhouse. I want to have lavels made   for applying to plants I want to give as gifts or sell in neighborhood yard sales. If may also package a few worms for sharing or sale. One of my future projects is to make  block letter sign to hang in the front and another one for the front of the barn.

Yesterday did get to 90 but the humidty was only 7% making it feel much, much cooler. And it got down nice and cool last night. I am taking it easy because it is my 66th birthday. I did grind out one half cement block. That needed to be done to  allow  3/4&quot; PVC  manifold pipe from the south greenhouse rain collection system into the greenhouse. I have a city water hose bib standoff in that same spot. The old redwood fence post I was using to protect the standoff rotted away. The part that was left went into the burn pile for the volcano pit that I use on blustery days to warm my hands or get rid of scrap bits of limbs and constructuon wood. The half cement blocks look good next to the foundation blocks for the rain system and protect the pvc pipe with small rocks gathered around the yard piled in around the pipes. I decided next time I get to Home Depot to purchase one more half block unless I can scrounge one before then. The first block I installed did not require any grinding as I dug it into the soil to clear the manifold pipe. The block I installed this morning had to be ground and chipped out about two inches deep and enough to fit the pipe so the second half block with sit and fit square with the first one. The next block can slip over the hose bib and that project will be finished. As I come across small rocks while building the new flower beds or digging out the plumbago roots I will deposit them at the base of the hose bib to help keep the soli from washing downhill. I will also deposit spoil dirt there to prevent the rain collection sytem from eroding away until the area is stablilized with time and plant roots. The local football team is going to try and redeem its embarrassing loss before their bye. I will watch as I half expect them to lose to a less talented team. I have zero confidence in this team and coaches AJ Smith has assembled..In short I do not like the man and have begged the owners to fire him long ago..The coach would be better if the general manager did not inisist on getting rid of key players to get less talented ones and pay them less. You do get what you pay for..Very few exceptions. to that rule. The pullets were scratching and foraging and clucking as they watched me work in their sight. All in all I am enjoying one of my best birthdays ever. The greenhouse, chickens and barn have given me great satisfaction. I also used some tools I slowly replaced after most of my good tools were stolen from me years ago. Well technically it was called a divorce but theft is theft and betrayal is betrayal. It took me awhile byt as I go into the final sretch things are looking better and better around Suchristo Farms.
