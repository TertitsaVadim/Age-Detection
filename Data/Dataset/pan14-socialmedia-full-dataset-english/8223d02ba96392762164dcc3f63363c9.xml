They sell, hire, and buy new and used shipping containers. They also offer containers that can be used for storage and portable cabins. At their self storage facility in Southampton, they use these same containers to provide storage units for individuals. You can hire a container, and they have a variety of sizes available, to store your personal items. <br /><br />What follows is a few examples of how you can use their self storage Southampton services. <br /><br />Cars and Vehicles<br /><br />Shipping containers are the perfect option when it comes to storing cars and other vehicles. Most of these containers are seven to eight feet wide, providing more than enough room for even wide vehicles. You can even find containers that are long enough to house more than one vehicle. The longest containers are typically forty feet in length. Smaller containers come in eight-foot, ten-foot, and twenty-foot sizes. <br /><br />For example, do you have a vintage car or perhaps a convertible? You probably only use these cars periodically, maybe during the summer months, and the rest of the year, they likely sit unused, covered at your home. Instead of having these cars take up space at your home while you are not using them, you can store them at Willbox’s self storage Southampton facility. This option keeps them safe from the elements and from possible theft or other types of damage. <br /><br />Files, Decorations, and Other Items<br /><br />Businesses can also benefit from this self storage facility. For example, these containers can be used to store files, seasonal decorations, and more. Even someone who works from home can use these containers to store old files. Instead of having these rarely used items take up space at the office, for a small fee, you can store them somewhere safe. Willbox will even provide containers with shelving to help you keep things organised. <br /><br />Too Much Stuff, Not Enough Space<br /><br />You can use Willbox’s self storage Southampton facility if you simply have too much stuff and not enough space. This can happen for a variety of reasons. For example, you sell your deceased parent’s home, and as a result, you end up with a number of items including furniture and keepsakes. You do not want to get rid of these items, but you currently do not really have the room for them. Self storage can provide you with the storage solution you need. For example, you can keep the furniture in storage until your children are older. At some point they will live in flats or purchase their own homes, and they will need furniture of their own. <br /><br />At Willbox’s self storage Southampton location, you can rest assured that your items are secure. At this site, they have secure fencing as 24 hour closed circuit television. They also offer self storage facilities in other locations in the UK. If you are interested in learning more about the self storage Southampton services that Willbox provides, you should contact them today. <br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy50ZXN0ZWQuY29tL3Byb2ZpbGUvZWxpZXRyb2Vsc2VuNDkvYmxvZ3MvMjE5NTU4Lw__" target="_blank">The Different Ways You Can Use Self Storage Southampton</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5zdXBlcm5vdmEuY29tL01hdWt0ekxvdHlpYm5uZS9ibG9nLzM4ODE1Nw__" target="_blank">The Different Ways You Can Use Self Storage Southampton</a>

At their self storage facility in Southampton, they use these same containers to provide storage units for individuals. You can hire a container, and they have a variety of sizes available, to store your personal items. <br /><br />What follows is a few examples of how you can use their self storage Southampton services. <br /><br />Cars and Vehicles<br /><br />Shipping containers are the perfect option when it comes to storing cars and other vehicles. Most of these containers are seven to eight feet wide, providing more than enough room for even wide vehicles. You can even find containers that are long enough to house more than one vehicle. The longest containers are typically forty feet in length. Smaller containers come in eight-foot, ten-foot, and twenty-foot sizes. <br /><br />For example, do you have a vintage car or perhaps a convertible? You probably only use these cars periodically, maybe during the summer months, and the rest of the year, they likely sit unused, covered at your home. Instead of having these cars take up space at your home while you are not using them, you can store them at Willbox’s self storage Southampton facility. This option keeps them safe from the elements and from possible theft or other types of damage. <br /><br />Files, Decorations, and Other Items<br /><br />Businesses can also benefit from this self storage facility. For example, these containers can be used to store files, seasonal decorations, and more. Even someone who works from home can use these containers to store old files. Instead of having these rarely used items take up space at the office, for a small fee, you can store them somewhere safe. Willbox will even provide containers with shelving to help you keep things organised. <br /><br />Too Much Stuff, Not Enough Space<br /><br />You can use Willbox’s self storage Southampton facility if you simply have too much stuff and not enough space. This can happen for a variety of reasons. For example, you sell your deceased parent’s home, and as a result, you end up with a number of items including furniture and keepsakes. You do not want to get rid of these items, but you currently do not really have the room for them. Self storage can provide you with the storage solution you need. For example, you can keep the furniture in storage until your children are older. At some point they will live in flats or purchase their own homes, and they will need furniture of their own. <br /><br />At Willbox’s self storage Southampton location, you can rest assured that your items are secure. At this site, they have secure fencing as 24 hour closed circuit television. They also offer self storage facilities in other locations in the UK. If you are interested in learning more about the self storage Southampton services that Willbox provides, you should contact them today. <br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy4xMWFsaXZlLmNvbS9saWZlL2NvbW11bml0eS9wZXJzb25hLmFzcHg/VT0yNjBlZmIwYzE1NDQ0MjJiODBmMmY0NDVmNjExMjJmYSZhbXA7cGxja1BlcnNvbmFQYWdlPUJsb2dWaWV3UG9zdCZhbXA7cGxja1VzZXJJZD0yNjBlZmIwYzE1NDQ0MjJiODBmMmY0NDVmNjExMjJmYSZhbXA7cGxja1Bvc3RJZD1CbG9nJTNhMjYwZWZiMGMxNTQ0NDIyYjgwZjJmNDQ1ZjYxMTIyZmFQb3N0JTNhZjc3YTRhZTctOGIzOC00Y2VkLWEzZGYtNzQ1ZTY0YmJkMDU5" target="_blank">The Different Ways You Can Use Self Storage Southampton</a>

They sell, hire, and buy new and used shipping containers. They also offer containers that can be used for storage and portable cabins. At their self storage facility in Southampton, they use these same containers to provide storage units for individuals. You can hire a container, and they have a variety of sizes available, to store your personal items. <br /><br />What follows is a few examples of how you can use their self storage Southampton services. <br /><br />Cars and Vehicles<br /><br />Shipping containers are the perfect option when it comes to storing cars and other vehicles. Most of these containers are seven to eight feet wide, providing more than enough room for even wide vehicles. You can even find containers that are long enough to house more than one vehicle. The longest containers are typically forty feet in length. Smaller containers come in eight-foot, ten-foot, and twenty-foot sizes. <br /><br />For example, do you have a vintage car or perhaps a convertible? You probably only use these cars periodically, maybe during the summer months, and the rest of the year, they likely sit unused, covered at your home. Instead of having these cars take up space at your home while you are not using them, you can store them at Willbox’s self storage Southampton facility. This option keeps them safe from the elements and from possible theft or other types of damage. <br /><br />Files, Decorations, and Other Items<br /><br />Businesses can also benefit from this self storage facility. For example, these containers can be used to store files, seasonal decorations, and more. Even someone who works from home can use these containers to store old files. Instead of having these rarely used items take up space at the office, for a small fee, you can store them somewhere safe. Willbox will even provide containers with shelving to help you keep things organised. <br /><br />Too Much Stuff, Not Enough Space<br /><br />You can use Willbox’s self storage Southampton facility if you simply have too much stuff and not enough space. This can happen for a variety of reasons. For example, you sell your deceased parent’s home, and as a result, you end up with a number of items including furniture and keepsakes. You do not want to get rid of these items, but you currently do not really have the room for them. Self storage can provide you with the storage solution you need. For example, you can keep the furniture in storage until your children are older. At some point they will live in flats or purchase their own homes, and they will need furniture of their own. <br /><br />At Willbox’s self storage Southampton location, you can rest assured that your items are secure. At this site, they have secure fencing as 24 hour closed circuit television. They also offer self storage facilities in other locations in the UK. If you are interested in learning more about the self storage Southampton services that Willbox provides, you should contact them today. <br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2VsaWV0cm9lbHNlbjQ5LnBvc3Rlcm91cy5jb20vdGhlLWRpZmZlcmVudC13YXlzLXlvdS1jYW4tdXNlLXNlbGYtc3RvcmFnZS1zLTgwNzk0" target="_blank">The Different Ways You Can Use Self Storage Southampton</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWdlbnRlLmNvbS95b3VyX3BhZ2UvYmxvZy92aWV3X3Bvc3RpbmcuaHRtbD9waWQ9MzIzNDEzMiZhbXA7cHJvZmlsZV9pZD03NTY4MTkzJmFtcDtwcm9maWxlX25hbWU9ZWxpZXRyb2Vsc2VuNDkmYW1wO3VzZXJfaWQ9NzU2ODE5MyZhbXA7dXNlcm5hbWU9ZWxpZXRyb2Vsc2VuNDk_" target="_blank">The Different Ways You Can Use Self Storage Southampton</a>
