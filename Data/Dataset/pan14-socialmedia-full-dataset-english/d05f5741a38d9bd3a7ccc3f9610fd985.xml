<br />1)New York City has 11 letters
<br /><br />2) Afghanistan has 11 letters.
<br /><br />3) Ramsin Yuseb (The terrorist who threatened to destroy the Twin Towers in 1993) has 11 letters.
<br /><br />4) George W Bush has 11 letters.
<br /><br />5) The two twin towers make an &quot;11&quot;
<br /><br />This could be a mere coincidence, but this gets more interesting:
<br /><br />1) New York is the 11th state.
<br /><br />2) The first plane crashing against the Twin Towers was flight number
<br /><br />11.
<br /><br />3) Flight 11 was carrying 92 passengers. 9 + 2 = 11
<br /><br />4) Flight 77 which also hit Twin Towers, was carrying 65 passengers.
<br /><br />6+5 = 11
<br /><br />5) The tragedy was on September 11, or 9/11 as it is now known. 9 + 1+ 1 = 11
<br /><br />6) The date is equal to the US emergency services telephone number 911.
<br /><br />9 + 1 + 1 = 11.
<br /><br />Sheer coincidence..?! Read on and make up your own mind:
<br />1) The total number of victims inside all the hi-jacked planes was 254. &gt;2 + 5 + 4 = 11.
<br /><br />2) September 11 is day number 254 of the calendar year.
<br /><br />Again 2 + 5 + 4 = 11.
<br /><br />3) The Madrid bombing took place on 3/11/2004. 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 4 = 11.
<br /><br />4) The tragedy of Madrid happened 911 days after the Twin Towers
<br /><br />incident.
<br /><br />Sheer coincidence..?! Read on and make up your own mind:
<br />Now this is where things get totally eerie:
<br /><br />The most recognised symbol for the US, after the Stars &amp; Stripes, is the Eagle. The following verse is taken from the Quran, the Islamic
<br /><br />holy book:
<br /><br />&quot;For it is written that a son of Arabia would awaken a fearsome Eagle. The wrath of the Eagle would be felt throughout the lands of Allah and lo, while some of the people trembled in despair still more rejoiced: for the wrath of the Eagle cleansed the lands of Allah and there was peace.&quot;
<br /><br />That verse is number 9.11 of the Quran.
<br /><br />Still uncovinced about all of this..?! Try this and see how you feel afterwards, it made my hair stand on end:
<br /><br />Open Microsoft Word and do the following (TRY THIS FOR REAL)
<br /><br />1. Type in capitals Q33 NY. This is the flight number of the first
<br /><br />plane to hit one of the Twin Towers.
<br /><br />2. Highlight the Q33 NY.
<br /><br />3. Change the font size to 48.
<br /><br />4. Change the actual font to the WINGDINGS
<br /><br />scary huh??
<br /><br />NOW REPOST THIS WITHIN 911 SECONDS WITH THE TITLE &quot;Weird 9/11 facts &quot; OR YOUR FAMILY'S NEXT PLANE TRIP WILL BE SHORTER THAN EXPECTED

<br /><br />A drunk man in an Oldsmobile
<br />They said had run the light
<br />That caused the six-car pileup
<br />On 109 that night.
<br />When broken bodies lay about
<br />'And blood was everywhere,'
<br />'The sirens screamed out eulogies,'
<br />For death was in the air.
<br />'A mother, trapped inside her car,'
<br />Was heard above the noise;
<br />Her plaintive plea near split the air:
<br />'Oh, God, please spare my boys!'
<br />She fought to loose her pinned hands;
<br />'She struggled to get free,'
<br />But mangled metal held her fast
<br />In grim captivity.
<br />Her frightened eyes then focused
<br />'On where the back seat once had been,'
<br />But all she saw was broken glass and
<br />Two children's seats crushed in.
<br />Her twins were nowhere to be seen;
<br />'She did not hear them cry, '
<br />'And then she prayed they'd been thrown free, '
<br />'Oh, God, don't let them die! '
<br />'Then firemen came and cut her loose, '
<br />'But when they searched the back, '
<br />'They found therein no little boys, '
<br />But the seat belts were intact.
<br />They thought the woman had gone mad
<br />'And was traveling alone, '
<br />'But when they turned to question her, '
<br />They discovered she was gone.
<br />Policemen saw her running wild
<br />And screaming above the noise
<br />'In beseeching supplication, '
<br />Please help me find my boys!
<br />They're four years old and wear blue shirts;
<br />'Their jeans are blue to match.''
<br />'One cop spoke up, ''They're in my car, '
<br />And they don't have a scratch.
<br />They said their daddy put them there
<br />'And gave them each a cone, '
<br />Then told them both to wait for Mom
<br />To come and take them home.
<br />'I've searched the area high and low, '
<br />But I can't find their dad.
<br />'He must have fled the scene, '
<br />'I guess, and that is very bad.'
<br />'The mother hugged the twins and said, '
<br />'While wiping at a tear, '
<br />'He could not flee the scene, you see, '
<br />'For he's been dead a year.'
<br />'The cop just looked confused and asked, '
<br />'Now, how can that be true? '
<br />'The boys said, ''Mommy, Daddy came '
<br />'And left a kiss for you.'' '
<br />He told us not to worry
<br />'And that you would be all right, '
<br />And then he put us in this car with
<br />'The pretty, flashing light. '
<br />'We wanted him to stay with us, '
<br />'Because we miss him so, '
<br />'But Mommy, he just hugged us tight '
<br />And said he had to go.
<br />He said someday we'd understand
<br />'And told us not to fuss, '
<br />'And he said to tell you, Mommy, '
<br />'He's watching over us.'
<br />The mother knew without a doubt
<br />'That what they spoke was true, '
<br />'For she recalled their dad's last words, ' ' I will watch over you.'
<br />The firemen's notes could not explain
<br />'The twisted, mangled car, '
<br />And how the three of them escaped
<br />Without a single scar.
<br />'But on the cop's report was scribed, '
<br />'In print so very fine, '
<br />An angel walked the beat tonight on Highway 109.
<br />'The 7 Second Prayer, Just repeat this phrase and see how God moves.
<br />'Lord, I love you and I need you, come into my heart, and bless my
<br />family, my home, my friends, and me. Amen. '
<br />Repost it!!!
<br />You will receive a miracle tomorrow.
<br />He who has a thousand friends has not a friend to spare.
<br />This morning when the Lord opened a window to Heaven, He saw me,
<br />and
<br />He asked: 'My child, what is your greatest wish for today?' I responded:
<br />'Lord please, take care of the person
<br />who is reading this message, their family a and their special
<br />friends.
<br />They deserve it and I love them very much.
<br />' The love of God is like the ocean, you can see its beginning,
<br />but not its end. This message works on the day you receive it.
<br />Let us see if it is true.
<br />ANGELS EXIST but some times, since they don't all have wings,
<br />We call them FRIENDS.
<br />Repost this so all your friends can read it~
<br />Something good will happen to you at 11:11 in the evening;
<br />Something that you have been waiting to hear.
<br />Do not break this prayer; Repost it as &quot; a poem that will give you goosebumps
