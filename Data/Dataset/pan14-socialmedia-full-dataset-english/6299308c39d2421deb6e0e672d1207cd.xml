In Castlevania, Simon Belmot would regularly find entire roasted chickens inside of walls and somehow get healed from devouring them (vegetarian or not, eating random meat discovered in an old wall is not a wise decision).<br /><br />How did we let things get so far out of our control? Games regularly send us off on adventures that require us to kill animals to proceed. How many Final Fantasy titles have you played where all forms of wildlife approach you, only to be blasted with Firaga? The game tasks you with tromping through obscure forests, their natural habitats, then rewards you with chump alter for hacking them apart.<br /><br />Oddly enough, some of the very best examples of &quot;vegetarian friendly&quot; games tend to be ones where there either isn't a story at all, like Tetris, or ones which you wouldn't even think of as video games, like Farmville. Somehow we've hit a point exactly where Farmville is standing as a positive example of an animal-friendly world whereas Call of Duty regularly has you snapping dogs' necks. Issues get even more complicated if you are vegan, leaving you with fairly much Pong or maybe Nintendogs. And Tetris. Thankfully we always have Tetris (that L block is totally vegan, as if it wasn't obvious).<br /><br />Surprisingly, most likely probably the most positive example of a game character living a vegetarian lifestyle is Super Meat Boy, a platformer regarded as &quot;Nintendo Hard&quot; by the very best gamers exactly where you run around as a chunk of meat trying to get his girlfriend back.

Spending several hours every day playing video games<br /><br />?? Becoming defensive concerning the amount of time spend playing games, if confronted<br /><br />?? Staying home from work to invest more time playing games<br /><br />?? Neglecting friends, family, and significant other people to play video games<br /><br />The negative behavior related with gaming bleeds over many other aspects of an individual's life. Psychologist Laura Walker says, &quot;Video games are associated with negative behavior across the board, so the much more people play video games, the more most likely they were to drink, use drugs, engage in risky sex. They had lowered levels of self-worth, lower levels of social acceptance, and lower relationship quality with friends and parents.&quot;<br /><br />One aspect that is hurt most by video game addiction is a person's social interaction and their individual relationships. As the globe of video games turn out to be much more detailed and expansive, an individual becomes so invested in this new globe that it holds their focus, causing them to play longer. However, there is a direct correlation between the time spent gaming and the high quality of peer relationships. These relationships consist of buddies, family, and significant others.<br /><br />Video game addiction occurs more often in males than it does in females. This leaves many girlfriends and wives feeling neglected when their significant other is focused on their virtual adventures. Many ladies feel that gaming, particularly big amounts of it, take away from the quality time that the couple could be spending together. Other people become annoyed as their substantial others are distracted by their virtual globe towards the point that they forget about chores that need to be completed, bills that have to be paid, and appointments that need to be kept. With these tensions growing, it is not surprising that 20% women have left relationships over excessive gaming; nearly 70% of ladies admit that video games have caused tension in a personal relationship.<br /><br />People who are really addicted to video games may need to receive counseling for their addiction, or other help to regain their focus on the actual world. But before you chuck your substantial other's Xbox 360 or specialty gaming keyboard out the window, and sign him (or her!) up for counseling, take a minute to assess what you are able to work on together. Address the problem at house, and appear for solutions there.<br /><br />?? Speak to your significant other about their gaming addiction. Let them know that you feel that they spend too much time focused on the games, and you would like to spend time focused on each other.<br /><br />?? Attempt setting aside a time of the day when the gamer can unleash. Does your significant other's WoW guild schedule their big raid every Thursday night? Set aside a block of time on Thursdays! Work with your partner to reach a compromise that makes everyone pleased.<br /><br />?? Try playing with them! Certain, you may have no interest in playing an Undead Healer running through instances until the ultimate battle with Deathwing the Destroyer in World of Warcraft: Cataclysm (but), but your significant other might appreciate the effort. An effort on your part might be just what your significant other needs to reciprocate.<br /><br />You don't have to let video gaming addiction harm your relationship, your self, or your substantial other. You are able to buy high-end models so you can save other files also.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fjamalwebb1128.xanga.com%2F754936174%2Fa-guide-to-buying-videogames%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://jamalwebb1128.xanga.com/754936174/a-guide-to-buying-videogames/</a>
