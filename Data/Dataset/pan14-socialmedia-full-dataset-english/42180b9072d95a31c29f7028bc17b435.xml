<br /><br />Depending on your situation and where you're going, many unexpected problems can derail vacation plans – a medical emergency, a natural disaster or even a political upheaval.
<br /><br />In those cases, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3VzdXJlLmhrL3BhZ2UvdHJhdmVsLWluc3VyYW5jZS5hc3B4" target="_blank">travel insurance</a> can be worth considering. But Consumer Reports cautions it isn't always a great deal.
<br /><br />Bill Nugent has benefited from travel insurance on two different occasions.
<br /><br />&quot;Once we had a death in the family. I had to cancel a trip three days before, and the second time, I injured my leg and had to cancel it, maybe two to three weeks before,&quot; he said.
<br /><br />The good news for Bill: he bought <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3VzdXJlLmhrL3BhZ2UvdHJhdmVsLWluc3VyYW5jZS5hc3B4" target="_blank">travel insurance</a> for both trips. He got back most of the nearly $12,000 he had paid in advance.
<br /><br />&quot;Travel insurance is a two billion dollar a year industry, covering everything from natural disasters to personal medical emergencies,&quot; said Greg Daugherty of Consumer Reports.
<br /><br />But the question is – do you really need travel Insurance? Consumer Reports says maybe, but buy wisely.
<br /><br />For instance, don't buy insurance that covers small losses, such as lost luggage.
<br /><br />And, if like many people, you really are worried about dying in a plane crash, still skip flight insurance. Instead, consider term life insurance that covers you no matter what the cause of death.
<br /><br />&quot;Before you buy <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy51c3VyZS5oaw__" target="_blank">travel insurance</a>, first check the insurance you already have. Medical emergencies may be covered by your health insurance, a fender bender by your credit card,&quot; Daugherty said.
<br /><br />If you're traveling overseas, be aware that additional health insurance could be needed in the event of a health emergency. So, Consumer Reports says to consider medical travel insurance, but be careful where you buy that insurance.
<br /><br />&quot;If you do decide you want <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy51c3VyZS5oaw__" target="_blank">travel insurance</a>, it's better not to buy it from a travel agent who may be more swayed by high commissions than what the best policy is for you,&quot; Daugherty said.
<br /><br />Consumer Reports also advises thinking twice before buying insurance from a tour operator or cruise line because the coverage might prove worthless if the company goes bankrupt.
<br /><br />One option is to go to an online broker like InsureMyTrip.com, which sells coverage from 21 different carriers, including CSA Travel Protection, Med-Jet Assist and Travelex.
<br /><br />Because, as Bill Nugent found out firsthand, considering all the effort and money we put into our vacations, a little insurance could go a long way when those plans don't go as planned.

If you are planning for an overseas trip, then you should make sure that you buy such a policy for proper coverage of risks. If you do not know about various kinds of policies available, then you should go for an online search.
<br /><br />Searching for an insurance policy is not a very tough task now with the help of online resources. There numerous websites, which not only offers valuable information about policies, but also offer comparison services, so that you can find the best policy as well as quality services. A standard policy for travel comprise of baggage loss coverage. You should also check the payouts of various policies before making your pick. When it comes to the coverage of baggage loss, you should also find out which items are actually covered by the policy and which are not. In this way, you can find out whether the coverage is appropriate for you or not.
<br /><br />The best way of finding a suitable travel <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3VzdXJlLmhr" target="_blank">insurance</a> policy is to go for an online search, as you can compare policies from different underwriters online. Even though standard coverage is offered by most of the policies, but different companies offer many other added features. Whether you are a student going abroad for studies or a traveler going overseas for work, you will gain a lot from Travel Insurance. You can easily find policies offering low premium rates as well as coverage for items like accidental death, trip cancellation, mandatory evacuation, passport theft, natural disaster or hurricane, and many other things.
<br /><br />It is better to find out about the kind of coverage that your policy is offering. If you want different kinds of coverage combined in one plan, then you can easily find such a policy, which covers interruptions, evacuations and medical emergencies simultaneously. To find the best policy, you can request for a quote online and then compare the features and coverage offered. When you check the coverage of a policy, make sure that you also go through the reason of trip cancellation, which the policy approves of.
<br /><br />There is another kind of policy, which also include coverage for collision of rental car, when you are on a vacation. If you opt for a package plan, then you will not have to evaluate each type of coverage, as you get an ideal blend of all. If you are ready to spend more money on covering the risks related to your travel, then you can go for premium plans. Even though these policies cost more, but they also offer better coverage as compared to basic and standard policies. However, if you are on a limited budget, then a basic plan will work for you. Make sure to invest in a plan, which offers you the best protection.

<br /><br />Now, with the August Bank Holiday approaching, plenty more could be thinking of taking a long weekend away somewhere.
<br /><br />If you're one of the lucky ones heading for sunnier climes, check you have <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy51c3VyZS5oaw__" target="_blank">travel insurance</a> before you go. It might sound obvious, but in the excitement of arranging a holiday, it's something that can be overlooked.
<br /><br />If you do have <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy51c3VyZS5oaw__" target="_blank">travel insurance</a>, you should make sure it's the right kind of policy. You could check with your insurance provider what your policy covers. Are you covered for everything you need? And is everyone travelling with you covered too?
<br /><br />Different policies cover different kinds of events and offer different levels of insurance for things that could go wrong. You may have read stories in the paper of hotels or travel companies going bust. There are policies that could refund you if that happened - but there may be certain criteria for a valid claim.
<br /><br />Many people find their <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy51c3VyZS5oaw__" target="_blank">travel insurance</a> gives them peace of mind, especially if you consider how you would cope if you, or one of your companions, were taken ill or injured while abroad.
<br /><br />No one can predict the future - but when you're on holiday, you don't want to worry about things like this, so take the time to look at your insurance before you go.

Think of this: the cost of cancelled and missed flights, the inconvenience and expense caused by delay and the huge financial outlay of a whole package if a travel company goes bust. There also is the chance that you personally will have to cancel your trip, perhaps due to a death in the family or some other unforeseen event. You should cover yourself for that. After all, you never know, and that is exactly why insurance was invented.
<br /><br />It covers you for both errors on your part and errors on the part of others. Not everything is covered (those famous &quot;Acts of God,&quot; for example), so check the small print. But now the real question, who should you get it from?
<br /><br />Jill Papworth, writing in the UK's The Guardian newspaper gives these great tips on how to buy the right insurance, her main advice being never, never, never buy insurance from airlines, travel agents or tour operators. Instead rely on private companies, such as InsureMyTrip.com, to compare numerous insurance sites to get you the best deal; its online and telephone agents will be able to give you unbiased help. LifeTips.com is another fantastic resource with a host of information, from the aforementioned Acts of God and travel insurance to advice on securing the services of a low-cost trip cancellation provider.
<br /><br />Also note, insurance coverage should also be upped depending on your locale and itinerary, as there is no one-size-fits-all approach. If you are going whitewater rafting in Nepal, then you should specifically mention this to your insurer, while if your trip is a week on Cape May, New Jersey relaxing on the beach, perhaps not. Yes, your daredevil vacation will put a few more dollars on your payment, but it will still be far cheaper than the considerable cost of an emergency evacuation helicopter.
<br /><br />Lastly look to see if you have some or full coverage from sources that might not be at first immediately obvious. I recently learned this for myself. I am a scuba diver, and I decided to purchase insurance from Divers Alert Network, more usually known as DAN. I  mistakenly thought it was just there if you get into trouble diving, but upon further digging, I realized that it covers all medical emergencies. You might have a host of cards or memberships that either completely or partially cover you, just be sure to check.
<br /><br />Some credit cards may even cover your travels and health, with the general rule being the more powerful your credit card is, and probably the more it costs you to have it per year, the more coverage it will provide. If you do not have all the bells and whistles on your credit card, then you need to top up, so to speak.

<br /><br />The film is based on the one-day Flying with Confidence course run by the airline and is presented by course leader and pilot captain Steve Allright.
<br /><br />Flying and travelling abroad can be worrying to many but taking out <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy51c3VyZS5oaw__" target="_blank">travel insurance</a> can help give passengers peace of mind.
<br /><br />The video sees captain Allright take potential passengers through the operations of an aircraft, offering explanations on the technical side of flying and occurrences such as turbulence. Also included in the video are relaxation techniques from clinical psychologists that will help with feelings of panic.
<br /><br />Customers can view a clip from the film on British Airway's YouTube site, but the full version will be available on the airline's in-flight entertainment service.
<br /><br />Captain Allright said: &quot;The British Airways Flying with Confidence course has helped more than 45,000 people over the past 25 years.
<br /><br />&quot;I really hope that we can reach, and help, even more people with this video - whether they're flying for business or for their holidays.&quot;

		<document id="3d2cca37730ec13a24d43bb5cd2c4605" url=""><![CDATA[Travel insurance policies may not cover worried travelers<br/><br/>With the emission of radiation from the nuclear plant of Japan that exploded, travelers are questioning insurers if cancellation of trips due to the radiation contamination in a certain area will be covered by their insurance policies.
<br /><br />Several insurers say that there are various outcomes to this question, but they stand at a common ground. For travelers who cancel their trips because they are worried that they will encounter radiation or other similar problems, their trip deposits and other expenses will not be reimbursed to them. The denial of coverage is mainly due to insurance policies cover the events that happen, not the state of mind of the traveler because of what happened.
<br /><br />Experts say that radiation-related events are not generally covered by insurance policies. However, for events wherein a hotel is closed because people were told to evacuate because of radiation concerns, then there is a chance for the policy owner to make a claim on their travel insurance or as  some refer to as trip interruption insurance.
<br /><br />Carol Mueller, the spokeswoman of the Travel Guard North America says that to her knowledge, there are no <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3VzdXJlLmhr" target="_blank">travel insurance</a> plans wherein radiation or nuclear meltdown is a valid ground for cancellation of a trip. Travel Guard is an insurance company that is located in Stevens Point, Wisconsin. For Kathy Townend of CSA Travel Protection, she says that the same reason that is stated above is excluded in their policies. She further says that the company is still in the process of deciding what actions to do should claims be made for this reason.
<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3VzdXJlLmhr" target="_blank">Travel insurance</a>  policies cover natural disasters which in the case of the damaged nuclear reactions in Japan were caused by the earthquake and the tsunami. MH Ross Travel Insurance Services, Inc. senior vice president Sheri Machat says that for her company, radiation-related claims will be considered, since these are byproducts of the disasters.
<br /><br />Industry experts agree, that everyone’s situation is different and must be reviewed on an individual basis to determine coverage. The only way to truly determine if a claim is covered is to submit it to your company.

Freedom from monotony and boredom of daily routine is nothing but a kind of emergency oxygen. A different environment, different kinds of programs and a life free from the one which is tied to the scheduled programs and to the must be done tasks provide immense energy to the persons who move away for a travel. Holiday travel insurance helps in maintaining peace of mind of the persons concerned.
<br /><br />It should be borne in mind that the globe has become more disturbed than ever. Life of humans is more wrapped with uncertainty than it was ever. Uncertainty is not only caused by natural calamities or diseases. Communal riots to terrorist attacks and accidents to frequent battles have engulfed the earth undesirably. Against the above-mentioned perspective, holiday travel insurance is of great help for the travelers, because their fiscal risk is attempted to be guarded.
<br /><br />Holiday<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3VzdXJlLmhr" target="_blank">travel insurance</a> is available to provide varieties of benefits some of which have been submitted in the following lines.

		<document id="30164d636845b902c66be64b2df1c5f6" url=""><![CDATA[Travel Insurance for 2012<br/><br/>Don't forget to consider <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3VzdXJlLmhr" target="_blank">travel insurance</a> when you plan your 2012 travels: Decide if you need it and figure the cost into your budgeting. Chances are it won't be a budget-buster, but failure to buy the right coverage could, in fact, bust your budget beyond any expectations.
<br /><br />When do you need <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3VzdXJlLmhr" target="_blank">travel insurance</a>? I suggest that you consider two important coverages:
<br /><br />-- You need trip cancellation (TCI) any time you have large prepayments -- either nonrefundable or carrying cancellation penalties -- that are more than you can afford to walk away from if you unexpectedly have to cancel a trip.
<br /><br />-- You probably need medical insurance if your regular health insurance doesn't cover you adequately when you're out of the United States. That includes everybody on Medicare and many others.
<br /><br />John Cook, President of Quotewright, a leading online travel insurance agency (<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.quotewright.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.quotewright.com</a>), recently distributed his checklist of travel insurance &quot;resolutions&quot; for 2012, which I find generally appropriate. In sum, Cook says (with a few of my personal tweaks):
<br /><br />-- Make sure that you buy your insurance early enough to get a &quot;waiver for pre-existing medical conditions.&quot; That waiver generally avoids hassles about whether or not an ongoing medical problem qualifies for coverage; typically, you have to buy the insurance within 10 days or so of the time you make your first payments.
<br /><br />-- Shop around for the best deal -- you can find 300 percent differences among policies with essentially the same coverage.
<br /><br />-- Make sure you understand the fine print. Most TCI policies cover only &quot;perils&quot; that are specifically &quot;named&quot; in the fine print, and often events like civil unrest are not covered. Specifically, most policies no not cover cancellation unless and until a named peril actually occurs: You can't cancel just because you anticipate a problem or feel uneasy about a destination.
<br /><br />-- Avoid &quot;opt out&quot; insurance that a tour operator, cruise line, or airline may offer, don't automatically accept the first policy that a travel agent offers, and don't accept &quot;waivers&quot; instead of real insurance. You could well overpay or face inadequate coverage. Instead, see &quot;shop around,&quot; above.
<br /><br />To those sound recommendations, I add four of my own:
<br /><br />-- If you don't have expensive prepayments that are nonrefundable or carry a big cancellation penalty, you probably don't need TCI, so buying it is probably a waste of money. As long as you can get your money back, you don't need to insure it -- especially since any insurer will demand you get all available refunds before they pay anything.
<br /><br />-- Unless the price is prohibitive, buy TCI that includes a &quot;cancel for any reason&quot; provision. If a more typical policy doesn't specify &quot;civil unrest&quot; as a &quot;named peril,&quot; for example, the policy wouldn't cover you if you decided to cancel a trip to Greece because you're worried about street demonstrations. &quot;Any reason&quot; coverage means you make the go/no go decision, not an insurance company bean counter.
<br /><br />-- If you need medical insurance, get a policy that provides primary coverage. Primary means the insurance company pays all the costs, up front, not just what you can't first recover from your other medical insurance. Even travelers with regular health insurance often buy primary travel medical to avoid the problem of having to pay a big bill on the spot, then go through a drawn-out claims process after they return.
<br /><br />-- Consider minor coverages -- personal property, lost baggage, delayed baggage, delay expenses, and such -- as a plus when they're included in a good bundled TCI or medical program. But they often duplicate coverages you have from other sources so don't pay extra for them.

<br /><br />The Asian country headed the list of 100 popular cities beating off competition from the likes of Singapore, Bangkok and New York City. London was knocked off the top spot of Euromonitor International's popular city list and sat in a respectable third spot.
<br /><br />Whilst the English capital is still the most popular European destination it failed to claim the world prize after its volume growth for 2009/2010 stagnated at 2.6 per cent compared to Hong Kong's and Singapore's rate of 18 per cent and 16 per cent respectively.
<br /><br />Caroline Bremner, head of travel and tourism research at the organisation, said: &quot;Asia is booming with increased urbanisation driving income generation and hence driving demand for outbound travel. Key Asian destinations such as Hong Kong, Singapore and Thailand are benefiting from the growing middle classes.&quot;
<br /><br />Skiing holidays are becoming increasingly popular for UK holidaymakers but research by Santander found that 17 per cent of Brits took to the slopes with no prior training.

		<document id="7147678fd653e9eec4d255ecad694d31" url=""><![CDATA[Top 10 reasons that travel insurance claims are declined<br/><br/>1) Not declaring medical conditions correctly – it really is important to make a full and accurate disclosure of medical conditions when asked for by the insurer.
<br /><br />2) Buying a policy that doesn’t cover what the customer needs – Customers look at the price rather than the cover and only discover that cancellation, baggage or pre-existing medical conditions are not covered later on. This happens much more when buying from price comparison websites. Remember: You can use confused.com to compare what policies cover, not just how much they cost!
<br /><br />3) Not having a police report for a theft – You must have some evidence that you lost the items you’re claiming for.
<br /><br />4) Not having any evidence of ownership – You also need to prove you own an item in order to prove it’s been lost or stolen.
<br /><br />5) Taking part in (legal!) activities that are not covered by your insurance – Such as water-skiing, sky diving, riding a moped, or even jumping from a balcony (it does happen). You can get cover for such activities (well, not balcony jumping) but you will need to state beforehand to get it added to your insurance, or maybe get a separate policy for the activity.
<br /><br />6) Alcohol and substance abuse – Unsurprisingly insurers won’t pay out for anything that happens while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.
<br /><br />7) Consequential losses – For example, an insurer may pay out for lost keys, because they are covered, but not changing the locks. Or they might pay out for medical bills and repatriation after an accident, but not loss of earnings once you are back home but cannot work.
<br /><br />8) Loss of enjoyment – No, this doesn’t mean getting compensation because going on holiday with your in-laws was a mistake. If people fall ill while on holiday and end up spending a large part of their vacation in a hospital they might try to reclaim the cost of the holiday. Insurers will pay for the medical treatment, but won’t refund the cost of the holiday itself because it wasn’t fun.
<br /><br />9) Fighting – Often a side effect of 6) so unsurprisingly insurers don’t pay out. Getting drunk and fighting doesn’t sound like much of a holiday, it’s hardly relaxing! However, you may be able to claim if you can prove you were only defending yourself.
<br /><br />10) Terrorism – if anything happens on your holiday that disturbs it in some way (such as cancellation or delays) as a result of terrorism it is not covered. The only exception is emergency medical treatment and getting you home.
<br /><br />So there you have it: the top reasons people make claims and the top reasons insurers might not pay out when they do. Hopefully all your holidays will be the perfect getaways you dream of and you will never, ever, need this information. But, just in case, when you next book a holiday don’t forget to check the details of the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3VzdXJlLmhr" target="_blank">travel insurance</a> policy.

		<document id="736a7b3d51a572da25be7a1ece57552" url=""><![CDATA[Top 10 tips for getting the best travel insurance<br/><br/> Want to maximise your chances of a <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3VzdXJlLmhr" target="_blank">travel insurance</a> payout with minimum hassle? Then choose your insurer, and your policy carefully -- our top ten tips will help!
<br />1. Buy online, direct from the insurer
<br /><br />It's reasonably well known that travel agents and airlines get staggeringly large commissions from insurers for selling policies -- but a lot of people still buy a policy from a travel agent because they trust the agent's advice. This can be a costly mistake.
<br /><br />For example, this fine print in Qantas' QBE <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3VzdXJlLmhr" target="_blank">travel insurance</a> makes clear just how much extra you're paying to buy it via Qantas: &quot;Qantas receives commission from QBE Insurance … the rate ranges up to 53% and is payable to Qantas by QBE Insurance for each policy issued.&quot;
<br />2. Two insurers, same policy?
<br /><br />Don't make the mistake of thinking two insurers offering Allianz policies are offering the same thing!
<br /><br />If you're shopping around for <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3VzdXJlLmhr" target="_blank">travel insurance</a>, you'll notice that while there are a lot of different brands, they're always underwritten by one of a few big insurers, such as Allianz, QBE, American Home Assurance Company, Lloyds, Mutual Community General Insurance and others.
<br /><br />The key thing to know here is that while two insurers might offer policies branded Allianz, for example, and they might look similar on first glance, they will almost certainly not be the same. Each insurer negotiates a particular policy that is priced up and sold to them by the underwriter -- and they choose what to include or exclude based on how much they want to sell the policy to the public for.
<br />3. Don't ignore government warnings
<br /><br />A favourite trick used by travel insurers to get out of paying claims is to exclude coverage for countries where the Australian government has issued a travel warning. For example,few <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3VzdXJlLmhr" target="_blank">travel insurance</a> companies will cover you for travel to any of these countries, which the Australian Government has issued &quot;do not travel&quot; advice for.
<br /><br />Even insurers that offer apparently broad coverage may leave wiggle-room to get out of claims if you've been warned by the government. For example, one policy we looked at confirmed  policyholders are covered for: &quot;unforeseen strike, riot or civil commotion, hijack or government action causing cancellation or curtailment of scheduled public services.&quot; However, where an Australian Government &quot;do not travel&quot; warning has been issued, the insurer could certainly argue that the risk was foreseen and you were warned.
<br />4. Reading insurance policies is boring?
<br /><br />Yes, reading page after page of fine print in insurance policies is boring (and insurers would certainly prefer you to pay attention to the slick marketing write-up of the policy on their homepage). But when it comes to claiming on the policy and discovering what you're not covered for, you certainly won't be bored -- more likely, you'll be highly stressed.
<br /><br />Do read the entire insurance policy booklet carefully before signing up, because <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3VzdXJlLmhr" target="_blank">travel insurance</a> policies are notorious for their endless exclusions and loopholes.
<br /><br />For example, one policy we looked at appeared to have reasonably generous coverage for electronic goods -- but included this nasty exclusion: &quot; We won’t pay for: scratching or breaking of fragile or brittle articles. This includes photographic equipment, spectacles, musical instruments, electronic equipment and display screens.&quot; So much for that generous coverage.
<br />5. Covering your laptop
<br /><br />Your <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3VzdXJlLmhr" target="_blank">travel insurance</a> policy might offer you $10,000 worth of baggage cover, but don't forget to check the per-item sub-limits, which are often hidden in fine print. Many insurers limit claims on frequently stolen electronic items (including laptops) to low amounts like $500 -- and after your excess is taken out, you might not see much more than $250 for your laptop worth several thousand dollars.
<br /><br />A much better way to insure your laptop and other expensive electronic goods is to contact your home contents insurer and get them insured as portable valuable goods. Generally, this costs about $5 per $1,000 insured, per month, and covers you worldwide for loss/theft/damage to the goods. Some insurers offer a lower claim excess (e.g. $100) for listed portable items too.
<br /><br />When you do contact your home insurer, make sure the portable items coverage is worldwide, not just Australia/New Zealand.
<br /><br />Some home contents insurers also offer unlisted portable items add-ons to their policies -- for example, up to $4,000 coverage for any portable item, with a $1,000 per item limit. This can be a useful type of coverage for mobile phones and expensive electronic car keys when travelling.
<br />6. Check the exclusions
<br /><br />Like all insurance, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3VzdXJlLmhr" target="_blank">travel insurance</a> is a game of risk; the insurers price their policies based on how likely things are to happen. As a result, to keep policy prices low, they exclude things that are more likely to happen. The trouble is, travellers often expect that they will be covered for the most likely things, and only discover they are not when they try to make a claim.
<br /><br />Common things that insurers often exclude are:
<br /><br />severe weather conditions or natural disasters
<br />    acts of god
<br />    acts of war, terrorism, uprising, civil commotion
<br />    a travel provider going out of business (though you might be eligible to claim from the Travel Compensation Fund, an organisation set up specifically to reimburse people when travel providers go out of business.)
<br /><br />These things all sound like pretty unlikely events, but when you consider a volcano is considered an act of god (think millions of travellers stranded by Icelandic volcanic ash that could have gummed up jet engines), and a protest around an airport is a civil commotion or insurrection (think peaceful occupation of the Bangkok Airport by protestors in 2008) those exclusions can have very real impacts.
<br /><br />Obviously, choose a <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3VzdXJlLmhr" target="_blank">travel insurance</a> policy with the least exclusions, and pay real attention to them when reading an insurance policy.
<br />7. Got receipts?
<br /><br />While many types of insurance (like home contents) will cover you for stuff you own but don't have receipts for any more, travel insurers are well known for knocking back claims if you can't stump up an original purchase receipt for the item you're claiming.
<br /><br />Most insurers make this clear in their policy, too. For example, one policy we looked at said, &quot;Full particulars, original receipts, original accounts and reports, including your original passenger tickets, are required to support your claim. Proof of ownership and value of items claimed will be required. When purchasing items during your travel, you must keep receipts separate from goods purchased.&quot;
<br /><br />So, if you're taking anything valuable overseas, make sure you know where the original purchase receipt for it is, otherwise consider it uninsured. An insurer might accept a valuation certificate for jewellery or other items, but be sure to check in advance, and get it in writing from them.
<br />8. Medical exclusions
<br /><br />The old adage, &quot;if you can't afford <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3VzdXJlLmhr" target="_blank">travel insurance</a>, you can't afford to travel&quot; truly applies here.
<br /><br />In some countries, particularly the US, it can be diabolically expensive to get treatment -- a visit to a GP can cost you $300, drugs can be hundreds of dollars, while something serious that keeps you in hospital for a couple of weeks can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars.
<br /><br />In developing countries where things are generally cheap, high quality medical care can cost many thousands of dollars a day in private hospitals set up for expatriates. If you need to be put on a med-evac flight to Australia or a nearby country where adequate medical care can be offered, the cost can be $50,000 - $250,000.
<br /><br />Because the costs of medical care can be shockingly high, insurers limit the risk that they'll have to pay out by excluding any condition that you were aware of before you travelled (and even conditions that develop that can be linked back to a pre-existing condition.)
<br /><br />As a result, if you had a heart attack 10 years ago, you won't be able to get any <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3VzdXJlLmhr" target="_blank">travel insurance</a> for further heart attacks or anything related to coronary artery disease overseas -- which is a huge risk for you and your family to bear.
<br /><br />Some insurers will provide medical coverage for some very common, relatively low risk medical conditions that you might already have such as asthma, diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol without history of heart disease, arthritis or early pregnancy -- but you have to apply for special coverage and an extra fee applies. Make sure you also get proof of coverage in writing from them -- don't take a policy with a company that says you only have to tell them about pre-existing conditions if you need to claim. In that scenario, you're leaving the 'finding out' to the wrong end of the process.
<br /><br />Some insurers brazenly say they won't pay for any treatment relating to an illness you and your doctor didn't even know you had before you left. Insurers that drop this fine print into their policies are best avoided.
<br /><br />Some insurers won't give you medical coverage if you've been drinking or taking drugs -- even if they can't prove the medical condition was directly related to either.
<br /><br />If you're travelling to the United Kingdom, Finland, Ireland, Italy, Malta, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway and Sweden, the good news is that the Australian Government has established reciprocal healthcare agreements with government public health systems in, giving you free healthcare in public hospitals, as long as you can show your Australian passport and a valid Medicare card -- so don't leave it at home!
<br /><br />Some insurers exclude all medical coverage for countries where the World Health Organisation has declared a global phase 4 alert (risk of human to human infection from a pandemic). This meant that from 29th April 2009, when the WHO announced a worldwide phase 5 alert, all medical coverage worldwide ceased with insurers that had this clause for a time, until the WHO eased the pandemic alert.
<br /><br />There are many, many &quot;gotchas&quot; in the fine print of the medical section of <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3VzdXJlLmhr" target="_blank">travel insurance</a> policies, so read, and re-read this section carefully before committing to a policy.
<br />9. They said on the phone…
<br /><br />Most travel insurers outsource their 24 hour help-lines to third-party companies like Mondial Assistance. Although these outsourced centres can be easy-to-reach and helpful, they may not be able to make any decisions until they can get in touch with your insurer. If you get sick on Friday night Australian time, you may not get an answer about medical coverage until Monday morning or afternoon, Australian time. Meanwhile, you'll have to find the money yourself to cover the cost of urgent medical treatment if you need it. Despite this, some insurers say in their policies they will not reimburse medical claims over a certain amount if you have not got authorisation from them first.
<br /><br />Another catch is that even if your insurer looks generous by accepting reverse charge calls from you while overseas, you might find that the high cost of these calls is deducted from the amount the insurer pays out in the end. This cautionary tale from a user Whirlpool.net.au: &quot;A few years ago, while overseas, our car was broken into and two bags stolen. Fortunately it occurred near the end of our trip. At that time we were with Covermore insurance and were rather pleased how they responded to our phone calls from overseas, including accepting reverse charges. [However] after submitting our claim and receiving a refund, we found that the reverse calls were charged at $50 a call and some of the brand new items purchased overseas and receipts provided, were refunded at half value.&quot;
<br />10. Cars, bikes and things with wheels
<br /><br />If you're hiring a car in Australia or overseas, don't just pay the extra fee that the car rental company charges to waive the outrageous excess on the car insurance (often $3000 - $6000). The fee with most car rental companies is usually $20 a day to have the excess reduced to something reasonable or waived altogether -- but it's almost always cheaper to buy <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3VzdXJlLmhr" target="_blank">travel insurance</a> that will pay out the excess on the car rental insurance if you do damage the car.
<br /><br />That's the positive aspect of <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3VzdXJlLmhr" target="_blank">travel insurance</a>. Now for a &quot;gotcha&quot; relating to things on wheels.
<br /><br />In a lot of countries, motorbike, scooter or &quot;tuk-tuk&quot; transport is common. However, don't assume you'll be medically covered if you have an accident on one of these. If the driver is not a licensed motorbike rider in their country, most insurers won’t cover you. If you ride one yourself, you won't be covered, even if your policy specifically covers you for riding motorbikes, unless you have an Australian motorbike licence.
<br />If all else fails…
<br /><br />If you're unhappy with how your travel insurer has handled your claim, you can go to the independent Financial Ombudsman Service. Just because an insurer has told you that you've misunderstood the policy or certain wording in the policy implies something, it doesn't mean they're legally in the the right. If there's a 'grey area' in a policy, it's common for the ombudsman to find in favour of the insured party, not the insurer.

<br /><br />However, while many Canadians put careful thought into planning their trips, the same cannot always be said when purchasing <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3VzdXJlLmhr" target="_blank">travel insurance</a>.
<br /><br />&quot;Often times, travel insurance is an afterthought,&quot; says Elaine Elson, a Canadian Accredited Insurance Broker and insurance services manager at Envision's Chilliwack City insurance office.
<br /><br />&quot;Most people don't leave for a trip thinking they're going to end up getting injured or in a hospital, but it happens more often than you think and the resulting bill can make staying at a five-star hotel seem like a bargain. We always encourage people to purchase travel insurance any time they go away - it gives great peace of mind knowing you're protected if anything happens.&quot;
<br /><br />Elson cautions that not all travel medical insurance is created equal. Here are her suggestions on how to navigate through the many options out there and choose the package that's right for you:
<br /><br />MAKE SURE TO DETERMINE YOUR LENGTH-OF-COVERAGE NEEDS
<br /><br />&quot;Travellers need to determine whether it is most beneficial to buy single-trip coverage or longer term insurance,&quot; says Elson.
<br /><br />&quot;It all depends on the types of vacations you go on. If you take one big trip a year, single trip coverage is your best option. But if you're someone who takes multiple trips a year, you may want to consider getting an annual policy that covers all the travel you plan to do in one calendar year.&quot;
<br /><br />DON'T FORGET TO READ THE FINE PRINT
<br /><br />&quot;When buying travel insurance, many people just think about the costs of the premiums - opting to choose the ones with the lowest price tag,&quot; explains Elson.
<br /><br />&quot;Of course ensuring you get a good price is important, but you need to make sure the amount and type of coverage you buy is appropriate and sufficient to cover off any potential claim you may need to make during your trip.
<br /><br />For example, if you're going to be taking part in anything that may be considered a high-risk activity, such as scuba diving or skydiving, you'll want to make sure your insurance covers that.&quot;
<br /><br />OUT-OF-PROVINCE TRAVEL STILL NEEDS TO BE INSURED
<br /><br />&quot;Generally speaking, we see most people buying <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3VzdXJlLmhr" target="_blank">travel insurance</a> for out-of-country travel,&quot; says Elson.
<br /><br />&quot;But travellers need to be aware that provincial health-care coverage differs in each province.
<br /><br />&quot;Even if you're travelling within Canada, you should make sure you're protected by purchasing <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3VzdXJlLmhr" target="_blank">travel insurance</a> to bridge any potential gaps.&quot;

<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3VzdXJlLmhr" target="_blank">Travel insurance</a> can reimburse you for otherwise non-refundable transactions if your trip is cancelled or interrupted, but rarely does one type of insurance cover everything, and the ones that do are usually too expensive to warrant an investment. 
<br /><br />By comparing a few different types of travel insurance, you can discover which one suits your needs best. This will bring you peace of mind so you can appreciate all the joys of exploring the world.
<br /><br />Trip cancellation
<br /><br />If you cannot go on your vacation, trip cancellation insurance will reimburse you. You will often need to provide an explanation, but if you are cancelling your trip, you most likely have a good one. This is one of the most common kinds of travel insurance. Often when people refer to travel insurance, they mean trip cancellation insurance.
<br /><br />Trip interruption
<br /><br />This is very similar to trip cancellation insurance. The difference is that this kind of insurance will cover all expenses incurred if your trip is interrupted and you need to head home early.
<br /><br />Medical insurance
<br /><br />This will cover your medical expenses while out of the country. But before you put down your money, you should research your current benefits with your domestic insurance provider. They may cover your medical expenses internationally.
<br /><br />Baggage insurance
<br /><br />If your luggage is lost or stolen, this insurance will compensate for your loss. If you are transporting items of great value to you, either financially or personally, this would be a good investment. However, if you travel light and only pack the bare necessities, you should sidestep this coverage.
<br /><br />Travel delay insurance
<br /><br />This insurance will reimburse you for any scheduled events you miss due to transportation delays. This comes in handy when you are traveling for business. But if you are simply heading out of town for relaxation, it is probably unnecessary.
<br /><br />Flight insurance
<br /><br />You could call this type of coverage life insurance in an airplane, but considering how unlikely a plane crash is, statistically this insurance is not worth the investment. Many times, insurance companies will provide packages that mix various types of coverage, so you will probably be better off exploring your options. Research various carriers and find out what appears to be a sound investment for you and your loved ones.

		<document id="f88294a2f053787c1c6c61eda5b53e17" url=""><![CDATA[What to look out for when buying travel insurance<br/><br/>There are so many <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3VzdXJlLmhr" target="_blank">travel insurance</a> sites around, all offering what looks like very similar products that it is easy to get confused. After all, I get cover through my bank account/credit card/household insurance anyway, so why bother?
<br /><br />Well it is true that you may already have the cover you need and if so, well done, you need read no further! But before being too complacent, just take a moment to check the cover that you have and make sure it does what you need it to do.
<br /><br />For example, if you are taking a grown up or a student gap year, most insurance policies only cover travellers who spend up to 70 days away from home, so it’s no go if at the age of 55 you suddenly decide to take off for 12 months to see the world! So check the small print.
<br /><br />And what happens if you do have a backpacker or gap year policy, but half way through your travels, brother/sister decide to get married, or granddad decides to fall off his perch? You have to come back, you have no choice, but it comes as a surprise to many that for most insurance policies, the cover ends the moment you set foot back in the UK, even though you may bought a 12 month policy.
<br /><br />And what about bungy jumping? When you left the country, the thought of leaving your fate to some bloke in New Zealand and trusting him to pick the right bit of elastic for the job, so you do bounce right back up there, was probably the last thing on your mind. That was then! But in the last 5 months, you’ve done Everest base camp, swum with dolphins, bought one of those South American knitted hats that they wear in Cuzco and sell for 3 times the price at Camden market and now a bungy holds no fear. Well that’s fine, but if your insurance doesn’t cover you for adventurous activities, then you could be stuffed if that bit of elastic breaks. And even if you get a rush of blood to the head and check the small print the night before, a phone call to your insurance company back home may not be enough to get you cover as a lot of companies won’t let you change once you are abroad.
<br /><br />But even if you just travel once or twice a year, you should still make sure you get the best <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3VzdXJlLmhr" target="_blank">travel insurance</a>  for your trip. Work out how many times a year you travel and see if it makes more sense to take out an annual multi-trip policy, which saves you money and means that you are covered for those last minute trips, when the next door neighbours offer you a chance to stay at their Spanish villa for a week or Uncle Fred gives you the keys to his pile in Tuscany.
<br /><br />Travel insurance doesn’t have to be a chore. The True Traveller adventuretravelinsurance.co.uk has a range of policies to suit travellers, heading off for any time from 4 days to 12 months and beyond, but wherever you buy your <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3VzdXJlLmhr" target="_blank">travel insurance</a>, just make sure it’s the right one.

		<document id="ce03e7d19e0efc2e1e8d8503da93b644" url=""><![CDATA[Travel insurance not a luxury expense<br/><br/>Another question that I’m frequently asked deals with <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3VzdXJlLmhr" target="_blank">travel insurance</a>. To many folks it is just another extra expense and they frequently brush it off with a comment like “I never get sick!”
<br /><br />My textbook answer is “How much will you lose if you cancel your trip the day of departure? What will it cost you if you have to fly back to the states from your European tour due to a medical emergency?”
<br /><br />There are hundreds of circumstances that could cause you to cancel your trip, return home early or force you to seek emergency medical treatment while traveling.
<br /><br />To demonstrate the importance of purchasing travel insurance, and emergency travel services, here are 10 common examples of what could go wrong.
<br /><br />It’s 10 p.m. and you and your immediate family arrive at the airport for a connecting flight, only to find that your flight has been cancelled. Who can assist you with finding new flights to get everyone home?
<br /><br />Your bag was lost with your insulin inside. You need help to locate your bag as soon as possible and have your emergency prescription filled. Who do you call?
<br /><br />Your first visit to Europe, and your passport and wallet are stolen. Where do you turn for emergency cash, and how will you get your passport replaced?
<br /><br />You’re involved in an accident and adequate medical treatment is not available. Who will help arrange and pay for a medical evacuation?
<br /><br />If your sister-in-law becomes seriously ill and you must cancel your trip, what happens to your non-refundable deposits or pre-payments?
<br /><br />You arrive in Jamaica and your luggage doesn’t. If it’s lost, who will help you find it? If it’s delayed, who will pay for your necessities? If it’s stolen, who will pay to replace it?
<br /><br />Your cruise line, airline or tour operator goes bankrupt. Who will pay for your non-refundable expenses? Who will help get you to your destination?
<br /><br />You’re walking down a street in Istanbul and a car backs into you, twisting your ankle. Who can help you find an English-speaking physician?
<br /><br />Three weeks before your scheduled arrival, a terrorist incident occurs in the city to which you are planning to visit. Who will pay if you want to cancel your trip?
<br /><br />You are at a beach resort in North Carolina, and you are forced to evacuate due to an approaching hurricane. Who will help you evacuate and who will reimburse your lost vacation investment?
<br /><br />Discussing some of these travel occurrences generally gets people’s attention. The conversation regarding insurance coverage becomes important and more focused. Many people are confused with how much coverage to purchase and a knowledgeable travel agent will be able to come up with a valid quote.
<br /><br />Another huge issue is the pre-existing conditions clause! This is an insurer’s get out of paying your claim tactic but if you follow a few basic and simple rules you can get the clause waived.
<br /><br />Timing counts here! You have to purchase travel insurance within the insurer’s deadline window for these three important types of coverage: (1) waiver of pre-existing conditions, (2) cancel-for-any-reason protection, and (3) travel supplier bankruptcy/default coverage. I always suggest that the best time to purchase this coverage is at the time when you make the trip deposit.
<br /><br />If you’re still not ready to buy insurance, most insurers typically allot between seven to 21 days after the initial trip deposit for you to still buy insurance with these protections. It varies by insurer.
<br /><br />Agents can tackle general policy features and pricing. But I recommend that you the traveler contact the insurer’s customer service department for any specific questions before you purchase the insurance coverage. You need to understand policy definitions and what each specific type of coverage entails.
<br /><br />Armed with this data you can then make an informed buying decision. If you opt out of buying insurance there’s a good chance that you’ll have to sign a release form stating that you were offered the option to purchase travel insurance and declined.
<br /><br />Here’s another benefit of working with a live agent. They can advise on the ins and outs of this very complex product. Yes most if not all on-line booking sources offer travel insurance but can they discuss your trip and specific needs? Doubtful!
<br /><br />Again I would like to repeat my automatic response to the insurance question “How much of your money can you really afford to lose? An investment in travel protection can give you the peace of mind that you really need to enjoy your vacation!”

That may be why, unlike car, health and life insurance, which most people investigate thoroughly before choosing a provider - consulting with friends and experts, comparing prices, even (shudder) reading the policies - <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3VzdXJlLmhr" target="_blank">travel insurance</a> is usually a last-minute affair, arranged in between packing your bags and checking the weather forecast at your destination.
<br /><br />Another reason people take <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3VzdXJlLmhr" target="_blank">travel insurance</a> so casually could be that it's relatively inexpensive. Somebody offers you a policy with your ticket, or you get it through your credit card. Roughly half the travel insurance policies in Israel are issued by the country's health maintenance organizations, the kupot holim, according to estimates by industry insiders. Most of the rest are from credit card companies and travel agencies, while actual insurance agents are believed to control only 10% of the market. 
<br /><br />The price differences among these sources are negligible. But when it comes to coverage the differences are significant, making it important for travelers to do a little homework before setting out for the airport.
<br /><br />1 Don't make do with the free coverage provided by your credit card issuer. It may not cover the cost of hospitalization.
<br /><br />The credit card companies do not charge customers for basic travel coverage, and in some cases it is automatic; the customer doesn't even need to contact the company for it to kick in. The problem is that free policies tend to have more constraints and limitations than policies you pay for. Any serious injury or illness requiring surgery or protracted hospitalization will probably leave the policy holder owing huge sums to the overseas hospital.
<br /><br />That's because they do not provide for full reimbursement. Free policies issued by the credit card companies set a cap on daily hospitalization and other costs, while policies that cost money generally cover more.
<br /><br />For instance, the Visa Cal credit card company will pay up to $450,000 for hospitalization and other medical costs, but has a $2,000-per-day limit on hospitalization reimbursement. If your medical care costs more per day (or in total ), you are responsible for the balance. Isracard has the same daily cap. Leumi Card's is lower, at $1,350 a day. Sources in the insurance sector say hospitals in Europe and the United States charge at least $3,000 a day.
<br /><br />The credit card companies do offer policy upgrades - for a fee, of course.
<br /><br />2 Do you have high blood pressure, heart disease or some other preexisting condition, chronic or otherwise? You may need special coverage as part of your <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3VzdXJlLmhr" target="_blank">travel insurance</a>.
<br /><br />A preexisting medical condition is a &quot;medical condition for which the policy holder received drug treatment, medical care or hospitalization in the six months before the trip,&quot; says Michal Weiner, head of the medical-insurance and personal accident department at AIG Israel. If you travel abroad without coverage for a preexisting medical condition that causes you trouble you will wind up footing the entire cost of care yourself, she warns.
<br /><br />The credit card companies' basic, free policies do not provide this coverage; you can get it, but you have to pay.
<br /><br />Anyone with a chronic condition such as asthma, slipped disc, heart disease or diabetes - even if the condition is stable - should think about this carefully.
<br /><br />Of the kupot holim, Leumit and Maccabi each offers a one-size-fits-all <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3VzdXJlLmhr" target="_blank">travel insurance</a> policy that cover preexisting conditions. Clalit and Meuhedet both offer riders, supplemental insurance, at a reasonable per diem rate.
<br /><br />3 Even if you bought an insurance policy through your health care fund, it isn't the actual insurer, and the actual insurance company won't be aware of your medical condition. You should advise your insurance agent accordingly.
<br /><br />A few months ago the insurance commissioner at the Finance Ministry, Oded Sarig, issued a draft clarification on medical insurance policies sold by insurance agents, which for the purposes of this article include the health-care funds.
<br /><br />One of the reasons for his paper was that, as Sarig noted, a health-care fund member could mistakenly think that when they purchase <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3VzdXJlLmhr" target="_blank">travel insurance</a> from their health care provider, the policy is tailored to their medical profile. That's a big mistake.
<br /><br />&quot;The policy holder figures the health-care provider knows them thoroughly and checked their medical records before offering the policy, but it isn't so,&quot; says Yaron Baron, sales manager at the DavidShield insurance agency. &quot;The kupat holim is serving as a marketing channel. Clal Insurance or Harel is providing the actual insurance.&quot;
<br /><br />4 Usually a $500,000 policy is adequate. All travel insurance policies have a coverage ceiling of between $500,000 to $1 million; the truth is that the number usually doesn't matter much.
<br /><br />&quot;In most cases the coverage offered by medical and hospitalization policies is high enough,&quot; says Baron, even though his agency offers PassportCard, with coverage of up to a million dollars. He thinks the number is mainly a marketing gimmick: He says he cannot recall a single case of a traveler needing more than $500,000, the lowest ceiling of any Israel travel insurance policy.
<br /><br />That does not mean that such cases do not exist, of course. Gabi Nakibly, VP marketing and sales at Clal Health Insurance, recalls the case of a customer who collapsed while in the United States and ended up in the hospital for 10 weeks. The bills came to $2 million. &quot;Since we have working relations with hospitals, we managed to get the bill reduced,&quot; Nakibly says, adding, &quot;But that was an extreme case.&quot;
<br /><br />5 Tailor your policy to your trip. If you're going to spend your vacation mountain-biking on single-track trails skirting deep gorges, white-water rafting or doing some other extreme sport, do mention it to your insurance agent so you can purchase appropriate coverage. If you're taking along expensive equipment mention that too, and find out how to get it insured as well.
<br /><br />Note that standard baggage insurance also has a cap, usually $1,000 per piece but sometimes as much as $3,000.
<br /><br />If you're taking expensive items, such as a laptop, gold jewelry or a smartphone, you'll need extended coverage.
<br /><br />6 Make sure your travel insurance picks up the cost of flying you back to Israel for medical care, if necessary. It will raise your premium for your entire trip by about $15 at Meuhedet, for instance.
<br /><br />7 No matter what insurance policy you buy, there will be co-payments: You will pay part of the bill. How much depends on the policy and the issuer.
<br /><br />And one other thing. Make sure to hold onto all your receipts; without them your insurer won't reimburse a single cent.

<br /><br />If you're planning to be overseas for more than 90 days then you need long stay <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3VzdXJlLmhr" target="_blank">travel insurance</a>. Find out more about what you need to know about getting the right cover for your trip.
<br /><br />Why do I need long stay travel insurance?
<br /><br />If you're travelling for more that ninety days then long stay <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3VzdXJlLmhr" target="_blank">travel insurance</a> is the most economical choice. You can compare deals online and prices will vary depending on the options you choose in your policy.
<br /><br />If you're going travelling or taking a long holiday then you will probably have invested quite a lot of money into your trip. If you don't take insurance out that covers you for contingencies such as a flight cancellation then you could lose thousands of pounds.
<br /><br />What should my insurance cover?
<br /><br />If you want to go for the most basic option then make sure you include insurance for medical emergencies, cancellations or delays when you're travelling, legal costs and loss of property.
<br /><br />If you're going travelling and are planning to take part in any activities that could be dangerous, such as scuba diving, bungee jumping or skiing, then make sure you let your insurer know or they may not be liable to pay out if you have an accident while doing this type of 'high-risk' activity.
<br /><br />How can I find the best long stay <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3VzdXJlLmhr" target="_blank">travel insurance</a> policy?
<br /><br />Making sure you choose the right insurance can be confusing but if you follow a few simple steps you can make things a lot easier.
<br /><br />The best way to get a good idea of the deals on offer is to shop around online. You'll find lots of insurers that are offering special deals that can't be found on the high-street. Many insurance companies offer discounts if you make your purchase online too.
<br /><br />You can try increasing the excess on your policy to reduce the price but don't forget that this could lead to problems if you actually need to pay out.
<br /><br />Can I use my insurance for more than one trip?
<br /><br />If you have family overseas or make regular business trips abroad then long stay travel insurance is a great option for you. Many insurers offer annual policies that will cover you for any trips you make abroad which can be a much cheaper and more convenient option than buying individual insurance policies each time you go away.
<br /><br />Whether you are retired, a student, a business person or have family overseas, long stay travel insurance is the best option if you're planning to go away for more than 90 days or if you will be making several trips abroad throughout the year.

Check, check and check.
<br /><br />Foreign currency? Oh, I will sort out that when I arrive.
<br /><br />When it comes to purchasing holiday cash, many of us leave this till the last moment and sometimes completely ignore it until we have arrived at the airport.
<br /><br />According to a YouGov survey, the most popular choices for consumers looking to buy their holiday spending money before they went away included visiting the local high street, such as a travel agent, or alternatively visiting the Post Office.
<br /><br />But going to your local bank, visiting the Post Office or using your card abroad is not always the most cost-effective way of purchasing your holiday spending money.
<br /><br />Just as you will look for the best deals on hotels and flights, you should do the same when it comes to purchasing foreign currency.
<br /><br />It is a commodity which is often lumbered with poor exchange rates and high transaction fees.
<br />'Most expensive'
<br /><br />Whatever you do, if you are looking to get the best rate then do not consider buying your holiday cash at the airport as it is the most expensive way.

<br />“Start Quote
<br /><br />Knowing where the rates are heading is not an exact science”
<br /><br />Timing is a key issue and you would be wise to start thinking about currency at least a month before you fly off.
<br /><br />As a first step, taking a look at the exchange rates would be a good start as you want to maximise how much local currency you can get for your pound.
<br /><br />Looking at the euro, until relatively recently the single currency had maintained its strength.
<br /><br />We have recommended that customers purchase their euros as soon as possible whenever they saw the pound make gains against the single currency.
<br /><br />However, while writing this article, sterling has performed more positively against the single currency.
<br /><br />Consequently, holidaymakers do not need to rush out and buy their euros now.
<br /><br />We see the single currency continuing to decline and as a result we think sterling will appreciate throughout 2012.
<br /><br />In contrast, if you are looking to head out to the United States, you would be wise to purchase your dollars sooner rather than later.
<br /><br />At the moment, the pound is performing well against the dollar but that is not expected to last.
<br /><br />Knowing where the rates are heading is not an exact science.

		<document id="1f0b1d1eab68ee7163f50d7506aa1f5f" url=""><![CDATA[Travel insurance can ease financial pain of medical emergenc<br/><br/>“Insurance is for pessimists” seems to be the attitude of many people planning a vacation overseas.
<br /><br />No one wants to dwell on the mishaps that might land you in a foreign hospital or, worse, require an emergency air evacuation from your dream vacation.
<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3VzdXJlLmhr" target="_blank">Travel insurance</a> is worth considering, however. For a relatively modest outlay, you can buy coverage that protects you if you have to cancel before or during your trip because you, your traveling companions or even a family member not traveling with you becomes ill and requires care. (These policies also cover cancellations for non-health-related reasons, such as a weather-caused flight delay that makes you miss a cruise launch.)
<br /><br />The policies cover prepaid, nonrefundable trip expenses that an airline, hotel, cruise line or other travel vendor doesn't refund if you must cancel. They typically also provide emergency medical/evacuation coverage in case you get seriously ill while traveling, and a hotline to English-speaking physicians and facilities that can best handle your medical problem.
<br /><br />Coverage is usually available either for a set annual fee or on a per-trip basis, generally about 5 to 7 percent of the price of a trip.
<br /><br />Travelers can also buy stripped-down policies that provide only medical coverage and medical evacuation services.
<br /><br />“The driving force of a (comprehensive) plan is the cancellation coverage,” says Damian Tysdal, a travel insurance agent in Hingham, Mass. “You can get a good travel medical plan for $2 to $4 per day.”
<br /><br />Although it's highly unlikely that you'll need to be airlifted out of a country and returned home, it can be a devastating expense, often running $50,000 or more, say experts.
<br /><br />Less-dramatic emergencies that don't require evacuation can still send you to the hospital and ruin your trip. In 2009 Robert Brucato took one misstep in the ancient town of Egmort, in southern France, and ended up in a hospital with a broken thigh bone.
<br /><br />Following surgery and five days in the hospital, he and his wife, Margaret, were flown home to Tucson first class by way of Montpellier, Paris and Dallas.
<br /><br />Their <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3VzdXJlLmhr" target="_blank">Travel insurance</a> company, HTH Worldwide, oversaw all the medical and travel details. When Margaret, now 60, had questions, she called the customer service representative assigned to their case.
<br /><br />“They knew more about Robert's status than I did,” she says.
<br /><br />Robert, 71, needed a wheelchair to get through the airports. A company representative met them at each stop and escorted them to the gate.
<br /><br />The Brucatos, who are retired, take two or three overseas trips a year. Their comprehensive travel insurance policy costs $350 annually for the two of them.
<br /><br />Is it worth it? Robert can't say how much they might have had to pay out of pocket for his medical care and their flights home if they hadn't had travel insurance because, he says, “we never got a bill for any of this.”
<br /><br />Many people think that their regular health insurance policy will cover them if they get into medical trouble overseas. Don't bet on it.
<br /><br />Some plans, such as those under the Blue Cross Blue Shield umbrella, give their members access to networks of hospitals and physicians around the world. But a domestic health insurance plan generally covers only emergency care overseas, say experts. In addition, members often have to pay upfront if the local medical provider doesn't recognize their plan.
<br /><br />Traditional Medicare doesn't cover care overseas, either, though some Medicare supplemental plans do. People in private Medicare Advantage plans may have access to some services outside the United States; it depends on the plan.
<br /><br />Before you travel or buy travel insurance, find out what you can expect from your existing plan if you need medical care on a trip.
<br /><br />Although <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3VzdXJlLmhr" target="_blank">Travel insurance</a> can fill many of the gaps in coverage left by domestic health plans, there's one big problem area that is the source of many complaints: pre-existing medical conditions.
<br /><br />Travel insurance plans typically don't cover care or reimburse expenses for a canceled trip if the problem is related to a medical condition you or your family members already suffer from. However, you can sidestep this problem, if you're on your toes.
<br /><br />“Most policies, if you purchase them within a set amount of time after booking your trip, will cover pre-existing conditions, provided they're under control,” says Linda Kundell, a spokeswoman for the US Travel Insurance Association.
<br /><br />The time frame varies. Travelers who buy one of Travel Guard's core retail plans, for example, are eligible for coverage of pre-existing conditions if they buy insurance within 15 days of making their initial trip deposit, says Carol Mueller, a vice president at the company.
<br /><br />The pre-existing condition coverage applies not only to the traveler but also to family members at home who might become ill and need care.
<br /><br />For example, let's say a traveler's mother has heart trouble and suffers a heart attack while her son is on vacation: A travel insurance policy would cover trip cancellation costs so he could go home and care for her if he had purchased the pre-existing condition coverage in the designated time frame. If not, the traveler would have to absorb any lost deposits and additional airfare charges.
<br /><br />When in doubt, call the insurer or a broker before you buy a plan and discuss your concerns.

<br /><br />The promotional commercial sparked claims of discrimination against obesity and was pulled from its television slot by the Advertising Standards Bureau (AS<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cool.gif" alt=":)" /> in late 2011.
<br /><br />The advertisement depicts holiday-maker Eugene Wild being hampered by a large man (‘Big Risk’) and a dwarf (‘Little Risk’) during his travels.
<br /><br />Compare Travel spokesperson said the campaign created immense controversy and some complaints among viewers.
<br /><br />“The original ‘Save Yourself the Risk’ campaign received a great response; some were amused, others not so much,” the spokesperson said.
<br /><br />“It was disappointing to learn that the ad had been banned - we wanted to entertain not offend”.
<br />A scene portraying Eugene and ‘Big Risk’ being massaged by a somewhat unwilling masseuse was deemed offensive and demeaning toward overweight individuals.
<br /><br />“The majority of the board determined that the overall tone of the advertisement was light-hearted, slapstick humour - we want to uphold the ad’s original intention,” the spokesperson added.
<br /><br />The new, edited version sees the massage scenes replaced with half-naked, roller skating females.

Luckily, cruise ships were not affected as much.  In some cases, when extreme weather affects road and air travel, you could miss your cruise ship departing. If this happens, you can’t do anything about it unless you purchase insurance or bought the air from the cruise line.  The cruise lines have commented that they have not had a lot of people missing their departures even though there were thousands of flights cancelled over the past weeks.
<br /><br />Vance Gulliksen, a Carnival spokesman, said, “Those who booked their air transportation through Carnival are being provided a future cruise credit for anyone who misses a cruise due to the storm.  For those who booked their air on their own, Carnival’s normal cancellation penalties apply.”
<br /><br />The cruise line suggests guests purchase <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy51c3VyZS5oaw__" target="_blank">travel insurance</a>. These policies can provide coverage in the case of missing your cruise departure. Travel insurance can also provide other benefits that can happen as a result of delayed or cancelled trips that are not related to the weather.
<br /><br />Deborah Deming of Frosch Classic Cruise &amp; Travel in Woodland Hills, CA recommends that you fly in the day before to avoid missing your cruise’s departure time.  She said, “This will usually guarantee that they will not be on pins and needles should they experience any delays, weather related or mechanical. “  For the travelers that did miss their cruise launch, if they had purchased travel cancellation/interruption insurance, they would be eligible for full refunds.

		<document id="43a6833c51a7b9db4aa8927ba630cdc8" url=""><![CDATA[Why you need travel insurance<br/><br/>More than 25 million items of luggage were delayed, damaged or lost at the world’s airports last year, which is around one bag for every 100 passengers.
<br /><br />An analysis by Flight Centre of the SITA’s eighth annual Baggage Report has found that an average of 496,153 bags per week, which translates to 70,684 bags per day, was mishandled globally every day in 2011.
<br /><br />Despite advances in bag tagging and technologies, the report outlines that the majority of all mishandled bags (85.6 percent) were delayed at the point of baggage handling.
<br /><br />More than half of these delayed bags were lost when passengers and their luggage transferred from one aircraft to another, while ticketing errors and failure to load bags were other common contributory factors.
<br /><br />In total, misplaced baggage cost the aviation industry an estimated $US2.58billion during 2011.
<br /><br />Flight Centre’s Marketing Manager Deanne Grove said while the statistics showed that most misplaced luggage was located within a 48-hour period, even relatively short delays could create headaches for travellers.
<br /><br />“For every Boeing 737 aircraft, carrying around 189 passengers, approximately two people aboard will lose an item of luggage,” Ms Grove said.
<br /><br />“Even though most people will find their luggage at the carousel, it is important to take precautions for those rare instances when something goes wrong,” Ms Grove said.
<br /><br />“If you are without your luggage for any length of time, even for just two days, the chances are you will incur extra costs during your holiday or your work trip.
<br /><br />“Replacing basic items like clothes and toiletries takes time and can place added strain on a travel budget.
<br /><br />“In these situations, travel insurance can prove a valuable investment.”
<br /><br />Grove said when buying travel insurance, it was important to read the policy carefully and make sure adequate provisions were made for lost or misplaced luggage.
<br /><br />“The financial support that may be available under your policy can be crucial even if your luggage is lost for a relatively short period of time,” she said.
<br /><br />LOST LUGGAGE FACTS:
<br /><br />- 25.8 million items of luggage were mishandled globally in 2011, an average of 496,153 bags per week and 70,684 bags per day
<br /><br />Of the bags that were mishandled 85.6 percent bags were delayed, 11.9 percent were damaged and 2.5 percent were lost or stolen
<br /><br />- 53 percent of the mishandled luggage was linked transfers, while 15 percent failed to load and 13 percent were incorrectly ticketed.
<br /><br />- Total cost to the aviation industry was $US2.58 billion in 2011
<br /><br />- Nearly a quarter of the world’s airlines offer bag-tag printing at kiosks which is expected to reach 64 percent by the end of 2014.
<br /><br />- Where does unclaimed luggage end up? In Scottsboro, Alabama at the Unclaimed Baggage Center. From here they get auctioned, donated, recycled or repurposed.
