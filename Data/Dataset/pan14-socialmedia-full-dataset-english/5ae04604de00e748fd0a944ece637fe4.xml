Although my sanity has already been stolen, I am insane. I miss my pet spider monkey, he was cute. I wish I could go back to my dream and steal him from there. It's fun to run around like an idiot, why do you think I do it all the time? It makes it even more fun if you make cool little noises, like you're on a mission or something.I am a ninja in training. No I'm not, but that would be cool. I stutter because I try to think of everything I say before I talk  so I won't sound like an idiot, but I end up sounding even more idiotic. I have a twitch, my nose twitches. People try to mock me, but they're not cool enough to do my twitch. I have a random personality, but that just makes it even more awesome. You envy my awesomeness. I believe I have A.D.D. and that I'm bi-polar. Don't we all. I yell till I can't speak when nobody's around. I sing at the top of my lungs when nobody is home so no one can hear how much I suck. I want to climb down my bluff, but I'm too much of a wimp. I eplore my woods and often get lost looking for Harvey, my baby. You just wasted two minutes reading this stupid pointless blog.haha

<br />If you're ugly, stop acting like you don't know it. The captions under you picture that says &quot;top model pose&quot; doesn't convince anyone. 
<br /><br />2. 
<br />To the people who have like 25,098 friends, are you serious? Nobody in this universe has that many friends. You're stupid.  Go slap yourself.
<br /><br />3. 
<br />Don't ever post pictures and say &quot;OMG, I'm so ugly&quot; because if you were, you wouldn't post them. 
<br /><br />4. 
<br />Nobody cares about threats over the internet. Don't try to act hardcore with the keyboard. Fighting online is like running in the special olympics; even if you win, you're still retarded. 
<br /><br />5. 
<br />Making 20 bulletins a day about how you have new pictures and begging people to comment on them is pathetic. Make the bulletin once if you have to, and those who actually care about you will comment on your pics. 
<br /><br />6. 
<br />If all your pictures look the same, don't post them all. Please put some variety in your pics. Nobody wants to see your face 8 different ways. 
<br /><br />7. 
<br />Who really gives a rat's butt if I don't accept you as a friend? MOVE ON. Don't send me another request or message asking &quot;what's up with you not adding me?&quot; I don't want you as a friend; that's what's up! 
<br /><br />8. 
<br />Little 6th, 7th, and 8th graders who have MySpace and look like sluts, go somewhere else because nobody wants you here. 
<br /><br />9.
<br />Guys 20 years older than the girls send them messages like; &quot;Do you wanna hot chat?&quot; or stuff like that.. What's wrong with u ppl!?
<br /><br />10. 
<br />If you have decided to read this, you are a true MySpace Friend. Real friends read their bulletins. 
<br /><br />11. 
<br />I say you go and pass this on and maybe it will finally get through people's brains (if they have them). 
<br /><br />12. 
<br />And if you open a bulletin and it says something like &quot;you will die in 10 days if you dont repost this,&quot; IT'S NOT REAL! QUIT BEING A  BABY! 
<br /><br />13.
<br />if u can't stand it anymore, just delete ur membership..!
<br /><br />This is a test to see how many people in your friends list 
<br />actually pay attention to you.

<br />that 
<br />three Brazilian solders were killed in Iraq. To everyone's 
<br />amazement, all 
<br />the color drained from Bush's face, then he collapsed onto his desk, 
<br />head 
<br />in 
<br />hands, visibly shaken, almost in tears. 
<br />Finally, he composed himself and asked Rumsfeld, &quot;Just exactly how 
<br />many 
<br />is a brazilian?&quot;

I woke up @ 8 sumthin Saturday mornin &amp; packed my stuff in the car &amp; went to sleep. I woke up four hours later &amp; we stopped at a gas station to get some drinks and let the dog go pee. We got Monsters and went on. We saw this kool huge water twirly slide in Ottumwa &amp; I think it went into a lake,or it was by a lake.Anywho, we finally got there about an hour later, and Courtney wasn't there yet, so we had to wait about another hour for her to get there.There was this car show &amp; my dad looked at the cars while me &amp; brit walked around with Simon(the dog who has many names). And she got there &amp; I had to take ALL the stuff(bcoz brit was bein lazy and only took up some things two times)And we took showers and talked for a while. Later on we got ready and all and went to The Depo,this really kool restaraunt that's by train tracks, and we basically played musical chairs. The first booth we picked, the sun was in mom&amp;dads eyes,so we moved to those tables that have the tall seats, and we didn't have enough room for all our food, so once again we moved to this other place. The table was against the wall/window thing , so we were in a line &amp; couldn't really see anyone, so when the sun went down some more, we moved BACk to where we first were. We had spinach dip &amp; this bread stuff(i forget what it's called) and we ate our food, which i was like super stuffed,but it was good. And after that Courtney told us a &quot;shortcut&quot; to get to Ed &amp; Nancy's(pple who run a B&amp;B &amp; shes a nanny for). And we are driving down this road, and it's long and has curves &amp; u have to drive slow , and it's by this really pretty lake, and it's like a camp site, and we drove down it(it was really beautiful,bcoz the sun was setting so u could see it's reflection in the lake surrounding the trees &amp; it was orange and pink &amp; it was pretty)Anywho, we drive all the way down, and the gate is closed. And there's this park ranger person &amp; he said he couldn't open it bcoz there's &quot;highschoolers who cruise down it, so we normally close the gate at 8&quot; and so we had to go ALL the way back and then go to Ed's. And we go there and we go on a boat ride.And I had to go pee so stinken badly before we even went on it, and it was cold, so that made it worse, but it was like an hour and a half long, and we saw pple shoot off fireworks, and we went through the &quot;mousehole&quot; as Ed calls it, and we stayed around there and talked and then we finally went back, I took a pee.(lol) and talked to Ed a lil bit &amp; then we left. And I got to see my &quot;crop circle&quot; that day. Okay,it wasn't really a crop circle, BUT it was a circle with a large V in it touching the edges. It was the &quot;V Farm&quot; as Courtney told me, so they put that, but it's close enough to a crop circle,right? Anyways, we got back to Courtney's place and she had popcicles that were freezer burnt, but she had good stuff 2, and i had this fruit bars, and the dogs were humpin eachother, and dad got sick from somethin and he threw up. And I made my little pad. And we watched the dogs.lol. My dog, Simon(he's the male) had not humped a real dog before, he has his little stuffed animals, and so he was humpin Foxy(female,Courtney's dog) and he was humpin her head and was pokin her ear and stuff. And then she'd pin him down and start humpin him,lol. It was amusing. And Simon would just sit down and hump nothing. And me,Brit,and Courtney went outside and walked the dogs, they talked to their boyfriends on their cell phones, and there had been a wedding that day, and they had just got done with the reception and we were over infront of the courthouse (or whatever it is) sittin in the grass, and these guys are yelling across the streets, drunk of course, and bein really stupid and Foxy was barkin at them and this guy was like &quot;shut up you stupid little weiner dog!&quot; and was laffin &amp; Courtney gave him this look and he was like &quot;nah nah i'm just kiddin&quot; . And then this guy she knows came over and sat down, and he was talkin to me and Court(really he was talkin to the dogs) and you could really smell his breathe and it stunk and he was talkin to Simon and was callin him a little turdball,lol, and playin around with him,and then he left and when he got up he tripped over his foot,lol, and then he was walkin sideways &amp; then he went over to this other bar with his friends. OH yeah,sry, and earlier, Me, Court &amp; Brit went to this tatoo/peircing place &amp; Court got her nose pierced &amp; Josh(the guy that did it) was putting this cleaning stuff on her nose &amp; she was like &quot;hold on,  hold on! are you doing it? is that the needle?!&quot; and he's like &quot;No,courtney, this is the q-tip&quot; lol. And then he was doin it &amp; Court had my hand &amp; Brit was laffin outside the room, and she got her nose peirced. And Britney was going to get hers done, but Dad would have freaked. OKay,back to the drunk guy thing. and we went bak up and then went to sleep, I slept in Courtneys room on the floor,her on her bed. And mom and Brit were on the air mattress, and dad was on the couch. And Britney came in Courtney's room @ 3 bcoz the air mattress was flat ( it had gotted unplugged somehow) and she took up my space. And I woke up to see that and moved closer to the bed. : SUNDAY : Courtney woke me up at 8 and told me we were going to go to the late service, and she went to the bathroom and I stole her bed, and she just took the floor, and I woke up later and her and mom were makin breakfast. I went into the living room and watched what dad was watching(guess it...news) and I tried to sleep on the air mattress,but it was flat, and dad aired it up,which that felt a lot better. And I couldn't sleep bcoz I felt blah. And then we ate and got dressed and went to her church. We were a little late, but there was only like 16 pple there. And this guy in the community had somehow managed to hang himself with towels, and he hung himself in a funeral home upstairs bcoz his problems were being put in the front page, which that WOULD really suck for everyone to know your problems. And after church, I got this kool hiliter,lol. And we met these pple at the church. And then we went back to Courtney's place. And we got stuff for our picnic thingy at the park. And we met Courtney's boyfriend there, Stan. And Dad got along with him, talked about construction and that stuff. And then we went back to Courtney's place and got the rest of our stuff and then left. We drove her old car back, and westopped at a gas station and took some snacks from our van, from mom and Brit and we got drinks there and then we went back home. We unloaded stuff and now I am here writing this,yes i know, long blog. Hopefully, it entertained you. Anyways, have a good week! Byees,

<br /><br />1. Take shopping carts for the express purpose of filling them 
<br />and stranding them at strategic locations. 
<br /><br />2. Ride those little electronic cars at the front of the store. 
<br /><br />3. Set all the alarm clocks to go off at ten-minute intervals 
<br />throughout the day. 
<br /><br />4. Don't bother doing your own shopping. Simply find someone with a full trolley containing roughly the items you need, and when they are not looking take it and go pay for it at the checkout. (this is not stealing, they did not own the items yet, they were simply 'moving them around') 
<br /><br />5. Contaminate the entire auto department by sampling all the 
<br />spray air fresheners. 
<br /><br />6. Challenge other customers to duels with tubes of gift-wrap. 
<br /><br />7. Leave cryptic messages on the typewriters. 
<br /><br />8. Re-dress the mannequins as you see fit, then arrange them into erotic poses. (be creative with the gift-wrap tubes used in point 6). 
<br /><br />9. When there are people behind you, walk really slowly, 
<br />especially in thin aisles. 
<br /><br />10. Walk up to an employee and tell him in an official tone, &quot;Code 3 in housewares,&quot; and see what happens. 
<br /><br />11. Turn all the radios to polka stations; then turn them off 
<br />and turn the volume up to full blast. 
<br /><br />12. Re-enact a fatal incident involving the automatic doors. 
<br /><br />13. Walk up to complete strangers and say, &quot;Hi. I haven't seen 
<br />you in so long.&quot; etc. See if they play along. Insist on calling them 'Bob', and if they protest, get angry about it (violent if necissary). 
<br /><br />14. While walking through the clothing department, ask yourself 
<br />loud enough for all to hear, &quot;Who buys this crap anyway?!&quot; 
<br /><br />15. When you leave the store, try your car keys in the door of every car in the car park until you get to your own. Then drive off as if this is perfectly normal. (Note- if you don't actually own a car and walked to the store, attempt the above by substituting car keys with your house keys). 
<br /><br />16. Ride a display bicycle through the store; claim you are 
<br />taking it for a test drive. 
<br /><br />17. Follow people through the aisles, staying about 5 feet 
<br />behind them. Do this until they leave the store. 
<br /><br />18. Ask if you can test some super-glue before buying it, then walk around the store gluing random items to other items/customers/staff. For added fun: See how many cashiers you can glue to each-other before any of them notice. 
<br /><br />19. As the cashier runs your purchase over the scanner say &quot;BEEP&quot; in a loud voice. Repeat this for every item, and for other customers items. If the cashier protests, kill them. 
<br /><br />20. Take off your shoes and tell them you want to return it and 
<br />when they say you didn't buy it there say &quot;The customer is always right dammit!!&quot; Make a scene. 
<br /><br />21. Move &quot;Caution : Wet Floor&quot; signs to carpeted areas. 
<br /><br />22. Set up a tent in the camping department; tell others you 
<br />will only invite them in if they bring pillows from the bedding department. 
<br /><br />23. Test the fishing rods and see what you can catch from other 
<br />aisles. 
<br /><br />24. Ask other customers if they have any Grey Poupon. 
<br /><br />25. Drape a blanket around your shoulders and run around saying, 
<br />&quot;I'm Batman. Come Robin, to the Batcave.&quot; 
<br /><br />26. Climb things. 
<br /><br />27. Randomly throw things over into neighboring aisles. 
<br /><br />28. Play with the calculators so that they all spell &quot;hello&quot; 
<br />upside down. Once you have mastered this, progress to &quot;boobs&quot;. 
<br /><br />29. When someone asks you if you need help, begin to cry and 
<br />say, &quot;Why won't you people just leave me alone?&quot; 
<br /><br />30. When 2 or 3 people are walking ahead of you, run between 
<br />them yelling &quot;Red Rover.&quot; 
<br /><br />31. Make up nonsense products and ask employees if there are any 
<br />in stock. (i.e.: Shnerples). Do a vague hand-mime of what a 'Shnerple' looks like to assist them. 
<br /><br />32. Take up an entire aisle in toys 
<br /><br />33.Hold people up with a toy gun and see how much you make
<br /><br />34.Play hide-and-go-seek 
<br /><br />35.Have a scavenger hunt in wal-mart
<br /><br />36:Go to the clothing department and stand next to someone and say loudly &quot;who buys this crap&quot;
<br /><br />37: Get 24 boxes of condoms and randomly put them in people's carts when they aren't looking. 
<br /><br />38. Set all the alarm clocks in Housewares to go off at 5-minute intervals. 
<br /><br />39. Make a trail of tomato juice on the floor leading to the rest rooms. 
<br /><br />40. Go the Service Desk and ask to put a bag of M&amp;M's on lay away. 
<br /><br />41. Move a 'CAUTION - WET FLOOR' sign to a carpeted area. 
<br /><br />42. When a clerk asks if they can help you, begin to cry and ask, 
<br />&quot;Why can't you people just leave me alone?&quot; 
<br /><br />43. Look right into the security camera &amp; use it as a mirror, and pick your nose. 
<br /><br />44. While handling guns in the hunting department, ask the clerk if he knows where the anti - depressants are. 
<br /><br />45. Dart around the store suspiciously loudly humming the &quot;Mission Impossible&quot; theme. 
<br /><br />46. In the auto department, practice your &quot;Madonna look&quot; using different size funnels. 
<br /><br />47. Hide in a clothing rack and when people browse through, 
<br />say &quot;PICK ME!&quot; &quot;PICK ME!&quot; 
<br /><br />48. When an announcement comes over the loud speaker, assume the fetal position and scream.. 
<br />&quot;NO! NO! It's those voices again!!!!&quot; 
<br /><br />49. Go into a fitting room and shut the door and wait a while and then yell, very loudly, &quot;There is no toilet paper in here! 
<br /><br />50. Get several bouncy balls and throw them down an aisle shouting &quot;go, pikachu, go!&quot;

I absolutely love them, they r awesome &amp; sooo xtremely talented, they all can play like 3 different instruments. &amp; JEREMY CAMP is going 2 b there 2!!!!HE IS SOOOOOO HOTT!!!(he's in my pics) And some other people who I have not heard of b4 are going 2 b there.I am getting my Camp MCMI shirt signed, I already have Toby Mac &amp; Building 429 &amp; this really kool drummer on the shirt &amp; other random people who preformed w/ Toby.

I was able to sleep in til 2:50, but i stayed up til 6 am. &amp; I had my last piano lesson til school starts(yess!)&amp; then I went 2 church &amp; was askt 2 fill in 4 Josh,the drummer,&amp; I was like freakin out,lol, bcoz I haven't messed around with any of the songs we did &amp; I practiced w/ them ,but we practice once, &amp; when we actually played 4 worship, I messed up @ a really major part! I played sumthin like a measure or whatever 2 early &amp; Cody,the stupid pansy, was laffin w/ Ashton &amp; pointin @ me &amp; makin lil hand thingies like &quot;choke&quot; &amp; all &amp; bein stupid. &amp; It was sooo hott where I was, I was sweatin so much! But, I got thru it! I was prayin as I was walkin up 2 the stage that I'd b alrite! my goodness. &amp; after worship David ,he's a uth sponsor, he said somthin like &quot; did everybody hear our new drummer on the block&quot; or sumthin like that &amp; he was like &quot; you did great! give her a hand&quot; lol, I was like eh, I sucked,lol. I'm glad ty wasn't there bcoz he would've been buggin me about it the whole nite. &amp; if Josh(the stupid-head) heard me he would have been critisizin me. I can not stand him. He likes my sister Brit, but she's goin out w/ Jason &amp; they're reallly 'serious' &amp; Josh was gonna ask her out,but was 2 late bcoz Jason, &amp; so he's mad about that, but he still flirts w/ Brit &amp; its just a lil pansy. &amp; Jason plays drums 2, he is GOOD!!! He can show up Josh, he is like a 10 compared to Josh who's a 6 maybe. Well neways, I really don't know when this lil 'drama' &amp; stuff happened btween me &amp; Josh. WEll neways, o ya, I had  2 fill in 4 Josh bcoz he &amp; his family({uth}Pastor Dave,30-sum,Wendy{plays keyboard,30-sum} Ty{sings,was suppose 2 sing 2nite,13} &amp; KJ{10?}) r in indiana,where theyre from, &amp; Josh was supposed 2 b on drums 2nite, &amp; our other drummer Jay,(who is reallly good,waay better than Josh) was workin, so they knew I played drums &amp; askt me 2. Yea,that's it for now,lol.Well I hope you all have a wonderful day,byees
