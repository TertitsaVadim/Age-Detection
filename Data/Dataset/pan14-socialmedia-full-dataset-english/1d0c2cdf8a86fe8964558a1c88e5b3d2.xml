<br /><br />Nickelback
<br /><br />Figured You Out
<br /><br />I like your pants around your feet
<br /><br />I like the dirt that's on your knees
<br /><br />I like the way you still say please
<br /><br />While you're looking up at me
<br /><br />You're like my favourite damn disease
<br /><br />And I love the places that we go
<br /><br />I love the people that you know
<br /><br />I love the way you can't say no
<br /><br />Too many long lines in a row
<br /><br />I love the power on your nose
<br /><br />And now I know who you are
<br /><br />It wasn't that hard
<br /><br />Just figured you out
<br /><br />And now I know who you are
<br /><br />It wasn't that hard
<br /><br />Just figured you out
<br /><br />I like the freckles on your chest
<br /><br />I like the way you like me best
<br /><br />I like the way you're not impressed
<br /><br />While you put me to the test
<br /><br />I like the white stains on your dress
<br /><br />I love the way you pass the check
<br /><br />I love the good times that you wreck
<br /><br />I love your lack of self respect
<br /><br />While you're passed out on the deck
<br /><br />I love my hands around your neck
<br /><br />And now I know who you are
<br /><br />It wasn't that hard
<br /><br />Just figured you out
<br /><br />And now I know who you are
<br /><br />It wasn't that hard
<br /><br />Just figured you out
<br /><br />I like your pants around your feet
<br /><br />I like the dirt that's on your knees
<br /><br />I like the way you still say please
<br /><br />While you're looking up at
<br /><br />You're like my favourite damn disease

<br />It's delightfully twisted &lt;3
<br /><br />[Intro]
<br />A beautiful monotonous system
<br />of words that which I've heard
<br />through deadly transits from
<br />life to life.
<br />Never ending trains carry
<br />the wheel of fortune guiding
<br />the destiny of one self.
<br /><br />[Bridge]
<br />Die hard and live long
<br />through the skies eye
<br />we fly. 
<br /><br />[chorus]
<br />Into drowning oceans 
<br />the ropes have been broken
<br />holding our necks to the 
<br />wall.
<br />Fighting these battles that 
<br />rage on inside us
<br />There are so many that 
<br />fall. 
<br /><br />[verse 1]
<br />Lie is center of believe 
<br />this is what some many think
<br />therefore it must be no it
<br />can't be
<br />There is no difference 
<br />between dark and light
<br />only the gray area
<br />between
<br />but without light triumphing
<br />the dark the gray cannot 
<br />be seen
<br />Just look up at the cosmos there's nothing 
<br />in the skies
<br />If it was all a big bang
<br />then who lit the fuse?
<br /><br />[Bridge]
<br />White skies, dark sparks 
<br />are flashing
<br />swords and horns are 
<br />clashing.
<br /><br />[chorus]
<br /><br />[verse 2]
<br />It's all lies, it's all lies
<br />mankind all despise 
<br />you.
<br />If you're so much better
<br />then why is your dark 
<br />voice so obscure to society?
<br />The torture you endure
<br />you still seem so sure
<br />about the choice you 
<br />make.
<br />Through the choices I make 
<br />cause me torture to intake
<br />it's better than the guilt
<br />that I'd have you with.
<br /><br />[Bridge]
<br />Tough change to embark
<br />from dark to light though 
<br />impossible it may seem.
<br /><br />[chorus]
<br /><br />[verse 3]
<br />you're wrong you're wrong
<br />everything you know is 
<br />wrong.
<br />How can you be so positive 
<br />though it may destroy me.
<br />If it's true who you serve then 
<br />it will be just what you deserve.
<br />I'll stick to my way that was 
<br />laid before me.
<br /><br />[bridge]
<br />Die hard and live long
<br />through the skies eye
<br />I fly.
<br /><br />i like it alot...

<br /><br />I like this guy (this is not the OMG part) But the weird thing is I have yet to see a picture of him (i am sure my imagnation is not making him look as good as he really does), He lives in a different town, I have yet to hear his voice (karlee says he wants to talk to me but he keeps losing his phone), and last but not least he is 20...Yea i said it he is 20, but you know what it doesn't bother me at all. My mom is even ok with it... WEIRD i know.... this is a first for me... Yea i have liked older guys but come on not 4 years older...OMG... you want to know something crazy karlee says that me and him have the same freaking B-day....AAHH yeah its F-ing crazy....OMG i need a cookie....HEHEHE this supose to be a secret but it is too cute not to talk about... He got me a ring with my Birth stone in it...AAHH.... I mean come on.... most guys don't even remeber there girlfriends birthday.... And we are not even dating and he knew me birthday.... This is so wrong... I don't really know him, i don't know forsure WHAT he looks like, but here i am telling you all about how crazy i am about him... See i must be pathatic (sp) Thats how i feel.... Pathatic.... I am like a love struck puppy dog, but its just the things karlee says that he says about me... Its so sweet, adorable and cute. No guy that i have dated has ever said some of the things he says... OR even remebered my Birthday or got me a ring with my birth stone... I dated this one guy Josh(PRICK) for 6 1/2 months the only thing he cared about was his Little(hehehe this is mean but i can't help it he was a jurk) Package... thats all that mattered to him.. not me... I did things for him, because i taught he loved me, but no not really...GRR.... I wish i never even went out with him.... The reason we brock up is because he wanted another girl, and didn't want me anymore.... (WHAT AN ASS) Ok i am going to get off that subject because i want to kill him for the things he did to me... and i don't like thinking about things like that... it makes me feel like a bad person.... 
<br /><br />I feel so bad Karlee came into my room last night crying her friend Jake is in the hospital again.. After she stop crying and went to bed.. I started crying... I never cry(i hate to cry in front of peole i think it is a sign of weakness I had to be strong for my sister) I cried myself to sleep.. i don't even really now the guy... its just i have been in the hospital.. i was rushed to the ER because of my stomach and come to find out if i tried to tuff it out all night i would have died... Here i go again crying.... Mmm.. You see i always try to tuff it out.. i don't like asking for help, I don't like needing help, and i don't like looking like i need help... I looked like crap that night i was screaming bloody murder and throwing up every where that was one of the worst nights of my life... and karlee my pour little sister was there for  all of it... me screaming, throwing up, and even when the doctor said i could die if they didn't take out my appendix thingy.... She was in tears i wish she never heard any of that.... She was shaking and really pail..Grr i don't want to thing about it anymore it is over and done with
<br /><br />I have suffered nothing like Jake has...so i sould not make such a big deal about it.....
<br /><br />Love always

<br />Just keeps holding onto dreams that will never come true.
<br />It holds on to the fear.
<br />The love.
<br />The Hate. 
<br />The Passion.
<br />The envy.
<br />The Lust.
<br />There all sitting deep down in my soul.
<br />Waiting to rip me to pieces.
<br />Waiting to devour every fragment of light left.
