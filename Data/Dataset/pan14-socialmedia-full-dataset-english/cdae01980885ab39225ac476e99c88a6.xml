<br /><br />Look for some advices from the past romantic time.. 
<br /><br />Looking for advices for a broken heart drowning in a blackish rag of life.. 
<br /><br />Happy from the outside .. shattering from the inside.. 
<br /><br />All the book was talking about is sweet love and how beautiful it could be.. 
<br /><br />I took a gasp.. held my pen tight .. flip the pages and wrote.. 
<br /><br />Dear my old antique book of love .. what do u know?.. 
<br /><br />Where’ there’s love there’s always suffering .. 
<br /><br />And where there’s suffering there’s always miserable souls.. swimming in a dark pool of bleeding hearts.. shattered to the bone .. seeking for solitude .. 
<br /><br />But .. the image of the first love will always hunt  those souls.. eating their mind.. ripping them alive.. 
<br /><br />Where’ there’s love there’s always suffering .. 
<br /><br />But what do u know old antique book..!? 
<br /><br />U were the mirror of other people souls.. 
<br /><br />People who find love and find it great .. 
<br /><br />But little did they know that love is just a portal to the black shadow aisle full of bleeding hearts from all times.. 
<br /><br />There will always be this gap .. this emptiness inside the heart.. 
<br /><br />And no matter how much we try to forget o’ old book of past time .. 
<br /><br />We can’t .. coz there will always be a place in our heart for the love that didn’t survive .. 
<br /><br />There will always be a gap .. no matter how much we try to forget we will just find our self sunk in the dark lake of love.. 
<br /><br />Where’ there’s love there’s always suffering !!!...

<br /><br />Empty.. hollow .. searching for the gate.. 
<br /><br />The gate that will lead me to salvation .. 
<br /><br />I’m still looking hard for the mirror of my soul.. 
<br /><br />For my whole.. 
<br /><br />I’m in so much pain .. but i must find the way .. 
<br /><br />There’s a rage in my heart that’s gonna eat me .. 
<br /><br />Inside out I’m melting.. seeking for the truth .. 
<br /><br />For my peace .. and yet for some place in my head.. 
<br /><br />My life is slippin right before me. And I’m dieing .. 
<br /><br />Diein of all the lies, the war and the fact that I’m locked inside my head .. 
<br /><br />I’n the twirl of time .. here I am again I’m searching.. 
<br /><br />For some answers about the real me .. about the world I’m living in.. 
<br /><br />Levitating in a shallow state.. with an empty body motivated by an empty heart locked in an empty head by an empty soul.. 
<br /><br />What’s going on with me .. why have I turned to be so hallow.. 
<br /><br />I won’t let that feeling consume me .. eating the lift shreds of my soul.. 
<br /><br />I gotta hold together .. and find my way .. 
<br /><br />For the sake of those I love .. 
<br /><br />I gotta find the little light that will lead me back to my life.. 
<br /><br />The life I once had .. once enjoyed .. 
<br /><br />And to the twirl of time I traveled .. 
<br /><br />Packed what’s left of me and flew .. 
<br /><br />To search for the answers .. 
<br /><br />That will lead me back home ..

<br /><br />Staring at house and apartments in my way.. 
<br /><br />wandering..thinking ... 
<br /><br />About the ppl who live inside .. 
<br /><br />Are they all happy .. or are they sad .. 
<br /><br />Maybe they're cryin for losing someone dear..

<br /><br />Why have we all became what we are .. 
<br /><br />Living among war .. 
<br /><br />Knowing very well that we are next in turn .. 
<br /><br />Doing nothing.. 
<br /><br />For money is all what we think about !! 
<br /><br />Celebrations moments had changed .. everything has changed.. 
<br /><br />Why are we living in a world so cruel .. what happened 2 all the kindness. the goodness 
<br /><br />Wandering.. Thinking.. 
<br /><br />What is behind these walls ..  
<br /><br />What secrets to be told..

<br />Waiting.. Wondering.. 
<br />The rain just stopped and the beautiful breathtaking rainbow cut the sky in half.. Making it full of life and joy.. Such a beautiful view .. 
<br />And yet I’m listing to music of my heart.. Music that keeps playing in my head .. Tackling my soul .. I wonder where he is .. I wonder what’s he doing now .. Is he happy or is he sad ?.. Oo how I miss him .. I wish that he was here with me today to see that view of the sky .. Everything around me is beautiful and I wonder why .. The birds are singing and for the fist time I think I can understand what they’re singing .. I think it’s a love song .. The wind is blowing so softly and gently tickling the leafs of the big trees inviting them to a day full of magic and surprises  .. What a view ..The big brown rock is standing in the middle of the field secretly challenging the wind to beat it.. And the eye of the sky just wake of its sleep showing it self proudly after hiding form the rain.. Blue sky with colorful rainbows . I wonder why I never notice all these things b4.. Was I so blind ?.. I can see a shadow and it’s coming by . Oo god it’s u.. I was waiting for this moment since forever .. I can see Ur steps being carved in the wet sand .. One step after the other and here u are .. Next to me .. But can’t u see me ? I’m right here .. Touching u .. Whispering to Ur ear.. Whispering the love words u always wanted me to say .. Can’t u listen to me ..I love u .. Ur name is craved in my heart.. Can’t u listen to me .. What are u looking for .. Why do I see these tears forcing to come out of Ur eyes ?.. I’m here next to u .. Can’t u see me ? 
<br />Why are u feeling that rock ? Why are u sobbing in pain ? I’m here.. Hugging u.. 
<br />Can’t u feel me sweeping Ur tears? Feeling Ur face with my hands ? God how I miss u .. How I miss playing with u .. Walking with u by the river .. Sharing all my secrets with u .. Don’t u remember when we first met under this apple tree.. I still can remember everything about that day .. the blue fluffy sky and how u and I were sitting under the tree on that green grass playing who could do the best shape out of the cloud? ..Laughing on each others funny faces.. Sharing our deepest secrets. Giving each other advices.. then holding hands and watch the sun set in peace as if it’s telling us good buy smiling to us wishing us good day.. And then when the moon shows its face .. We just sit in peace.. Adoring the view of the black rag of sky full of shiny little stars .. As if they salute us .. Giving us the perfect view .. Blessing our pure love.. And how the proud moon light upon our head as if setting us to the mood and the perfect spot to dance under it.. Ohhh what a beautiful day it was .. 
<br /> I’d do anything just to come back and have all these feelings .. But I guess once Ur dead u can’t do much but wishing Ur beloved to live a happy life.. How I wish  that I told u I love u b4 I die .. U were my hero and u’ll always be .. Go ahead and live Ur life.. And don’t worry about me .. I’m sure that someday I’ll be able to touch u one more .. And meet u up there in heaven .. God bless u

Their achievements and their lives..But have we ever stopped and think about those who live among us!! Those who we called the low-class? if u want to read about history u head to the library and all u find there is stories about famous ppl and their lives .. But have u ever came across a single book about a poor man!! or a worker-class man !! Have u ever think about their role in makin us living better? About their part of helping those great ppl to become what they are!! 
<br />Well I am.. I think about them every day.. One of those great (allow me to call him great) ppl is a man who sells water!! Yes a poor man whom I saw every time i go to the mall.. If u think deep he's working hard under the burning sun and all he do is just selling water for those who stops by the traffic light.. But have u ever stopped for a moment and think how he helped so many ppl in the open road!! He never moans or asks for tips!! but for the money u will give him in exchange for the water and that money is really few considering the other jobs!!.. I call him great because he's working and because many times he had helped me in someway!! Helped me to be the person i am today.. Helped me to think about his class.. Helped me to help him.. to buy from him every time i pass him by.. Helped me to overcome my fear of failure.. And that no matter what i will do in this life i will always have something for ppl to remember me for.. It’s not the job title that defines us.. It’s that person who lives among us.. The power of being great not by ppls eyes but in our eyes..The power to satisfy for what we do just because we want to do it.. Not because we want thanks!! The power to get inspired by the spirit of that great guy ... thank u mister great guy for in someway u were a great help.. u taught me something and for sure mister great guy I’ll always miss u for u were my teacher in this life <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" />

		<document id="a2fa74fd6ef2adf1b62481e0e8bd8968" url=""><![CDATA[Kids!!<br/><br/>I’ve been sitting alone in one of the coffee shops in my hometown .. When an idea hits me .. It was somehow a strange idea I agree but it does makes sense in many ways !!.. having to look at all the mom's and dad's and kids around the place makes me feels some kind of happy and pleased .. Kids are the light of our life .. They are the power to our pain .. The engine to our soul .. Then it came to me .. While I was sitting there staring happily at all the kids running, playing, screaming and maybe reading in that place .. I thought of what would our world be if kids have to rule us for one day ? Will there be any wars ? Will we have so many problems with our life that we hope we were never born!!? Will we think of money the way we do now ? And will we and we and we .. Hundred of thousands of questions pops into my mind .. I couldn't find an answer but instead I had these delightful moments of dreaming and living splendid what-seems-to-be hours of dreaming .. I saw my self as a child again.. Living in a world where adults happened to be peaceful and harmless mostly powerless .. I saw kids running towns and cities and it was so good that I really wished that it could be true.. I saw peace everywhere ..Entertainment centers and houses built of chocolate and candy everywhere .. words like hate, beat, war, slap, guns, harmful, grudge, envy, rubbery and all those harmful words we know in our realm are no where to be found on the city-hall library or at any dictionary I lay my hands on when I was traveling with my thoughts ..Schools are fond for the purpose of learning and nothing but learning.. I looked farther in my dream and reached the governor he seems to be 10 years old .. Very kind and good in heart .. He was having a conference about what more could be done to make the city more worth living for all kind of creator.. I saw the innocent look in his face .. That look that define every child on our planet .. Rich or poor .. Good or bad .. Smart or dumb.. Healthy or weak . There’s always the look .. I walked more and more till I reached a play ground were kids my age (12) were playing .. I had this argue about something I don't remember and then I played and played and played till I was tired of playing .. No roles no nothing .. Just a bunch of kids running the city making it as great as it is .. Money isn't a big issue in this little world I created in my mind .. For it's only used for purpose and that's to buy foods and drinks and maybe to do little shopping .. But if Ur poor u can always check with the helping houses scattered around the town and which'll always register some quick money for u.. So in this world Poorness does not exist everyone is equal in rights and smart kids are to be held in higher positions .. And so on .. 
<br />I had to get back to reality for its 2 good to be true.. When I got back to my reality I stare at every kid I could lay my eyes on .. They are all pretty and so very innocent .. And although they might to be a lot different than us when we were their ages, there will always be that look that all the children on earth share.. If Ur sad or down just look at a kids face.. They are so peaceful that when u smiles to some of them they just beautifully smile back .. Some feels shy and hides behind their parents back..If u need an honest opinion about something or a feedback there's no one better than a kid to tell u the truth and right to Ur face..  Some are just so curious that they could stare at u and Ur things if they can ..But beneath them they're always kids .. And they are there to make us live better .. Coz a life without a kid is a life without a light, laughter and Peace !!.. In this world I’m living kids are found to be a trouble makers .. Some are killer from an early age, some are ill but inside of them they remain kids .. There is always a light in their heats that is fighting 4 its way .. What made our kids act the way they do is that community they live in .. Where war and rubbery and homicides and the top topics in news papers and the internet .. We barged into our kids’ world .. Kills that innocence in them .. Exposed them to a world much more bigger than what their small hearts could take .. But yet some are always managed to find the way .. The path and to be honest and true .. I’m not saying that they are not mean and rude .. But they do remain kids .. We could kill anyway for the sake of our kids .. And when they get in a fight we always stay on their sides even when we know they're mistaken .. They are the joy of our heart the reason we're doing most of chores in this life .. A life without a smile is a dull life .. But a life without a kid is a dead life !!

<br />And after we bared him my new adventure with life has just begun. Why did he leave me alone slapping the waves of life? He was everything to me.. He was my life and my soul he was the air I breathe..
<br />It was a black day when we decided to have this ride over the motorcycle .. He said it would only take 15mins I didn't feel ok that day and I told him to leave it for another time but he insisted.. I rode the motorcycle with him we had  the most greatest 11 mins we ever had in our life until we saw it .. This big truck heading toward us . it wouldn't slow down and we couldn't do anything .. I didn’t realize it when he gave me his helmets and toss me out the road .. All what I remember then is his body floating up high and slammed the floor so hard .. 
<br />I couldn't take it so I fainted .. Up to this moment I still feel of him as if he's here with me.. I almost see his smile in each little kid smile. I see his face in each man pass in the little narrow path to my house .. Shades of him are everywhere as if it’s protecting me from me. I hear him whisper to me through the wind asking me to be strong and alive .. I went to the ocean and stood by the tree where we both spent the most beautiful days of our life.. The same tree where he carved my name inside a heart he drew .. Such a wonderful guy he was I couldn’t help my self but to cry .. Cry over the days and years we spent together..Why would the ppl we love the most have leave us.. Why can't we continue our life normally without having this missing thing in our life which will always remind us of the person we love .. U’ll always be in my heart, and my soul.. Coz u've been the only one who ever visited me in my dreams..

<br />I was shaking to the bone..
<br />Hallow. I felt the dark swept into my heart..
<br />Some ppl just pass into our life and leave a great effect that we never forget..
<br />Some might do us a favor even if they just pass on to our life..
<br />Some might hit the darkest spot of our life .. 
<br />Some ppl we meet at the road or library or even the cab but they leave a great influence into our life .. 
<br />Today I heard a news that shivers me inside out .. 
<br />Although I didn’t know the lady close enough to weep .. 
<br />She affected me somehow .. 
<br />The way she acts, her voice , her dress are all sticked to my mind.. 
<br />I once heard about a girl in my school who passed out just few weeks after I saw her .. And her image is still hunting me out..
<br />But what I heard today affected me even more coz  I know my teacher for a quite sometime.. 
<br />I knew her sisters.. And although I didn’t know her that well she was always in my mind .. Coz just whenever one closed the door in my face she was the one who opened that little window for the light to crawl in .. 
<br />May u rest in peace my teacher.. U’ll always be in my heart .. U’ll always hunt my dreams .. It was a shock to know that u pass out .. But it’s life.. And we’re all going to have the same fate someday… ill always pray for u .. And may Ur grave be filled with light for all the good deeds u did to me and the other kids back then..
<br />And if I went to heaven someday I’ll look u out and I’ll thank u .. 
<br />Coz I never had the chance to do so when I was just near u .. 
<br />This has taught me a lesson.. A lesson that took me 25 years old to learn .. 
<br />No matter how mean ppl were to me I will always be there for them no matter what .. Coz when I die I want ppl to remember me by my good deeds.. To pray for me just as I’m doing for all the ppl who passes through my mind .. 
<br />Death is a hard thing to deal with . But it’s our fate .. It’s our fate .. 
<br />Wish my words could reach u to Ur grave .. I want to thank u for everything u did to me..
<br />Thank u my great teacher Aseel .. May god rest ur soul in peace..
<br /><br />* A Dedication to my late teacher allah yr7amha who passed away last Ramadhan..

Her life<br/><br/>i'm having this story of a girl who lived in an ordinary world .. she's different than any other girls i ever met in my life.. For she kinda lived a miserable life.. no one ever loved her in school .. well maybe coz she was living in a different society since she wasn't really belong to the country she was living at .. any way each time anyone find out about where were she born or where does she really came from they start to tease her .. as a little girl she had nothing to do but to turn into her parents and consultation in school .. but they were all not really helpful for she always missed the feeling of being safe .. and although her mom really loved her she has been beating really hard by her father .. sometimes for a good reason and sometimes just to teach her a lesson or so .. times carried on and our girl grow she's now in intermediate school.. moving to a new school made her think that she will meet different better girls but the truth was they are all the same .. and as they know where she really came from they also start teasing her... as a revenge she had to steal !! she started to steal things from her classmate and never stopped she seems to enjoy it coz it was her only way to revenge !!.. somehow and in this particular day her teacher finds out about her and unfortunately she had to punish her in front of her friends .. u can imagine how this can affect in a 12 years old girl .. so for the rest of her 4 years at this school no one trusted her and they were all so mean to her and no one actually loved her!! ... despite the fact that she really loves her father he was still beating her.. maybe coz she was the elder of her siblings she should take the blame .. and again time has pass our girl now is in high school just when she thought that all her problem would be solved when she went to that new school in the area .. something came up .. the girls who used to study with her in the same old school are with her now and i think they are starting to gossip.. but as a lady she didn't act as she used to she just ignored them and try to search among all these girls of someone who's really nice .. someone who really doesn't care about her past .. she's a big lady now and she had learned from her mistake.. she never wanted to do the same mistake ever again .. so when she went to that school she was known by her kindness and hyperness.. she was the school road runner and she never hated any one .. even those who really hurted her in the past .. so she made it through her life .. her father is getting better coz i think that he finally realize that she's a big lady now and that she needs another kind of treatment.. it's the last year few days separate from the graduation .. she wanted to became a doctor to help those in need. but of course life is tough and sometimes what we wish for the most is what we lose .. she couldn't go to the univ coz she wasn't (.......) and becoz at the place were she's been living for almost her whole life foreigner are not accepted .. she was shocked so her father presuded her to study in some local institute .. and although she hated it she has to accept the offer coz there was no other choice and becoz of some circumstances her father had to leave work so he couldn't send her out!! so our girl spent 2 years in that institute she tried to enter this univ out side the country were she was living but they kicked her in a really far place so her mom got worried and didn't allowed her .. from here she stared to act diff she was more like a girl who hates to go out or hang out with any one coz all her friends got to college while she has to stay home .. but something good came out of it .. coz she spent her time reading and reading .. she red lot's of books on self helping which made her kinda wise for a girl in her age . i mean being 19 and understand much about life is something rare for a girl in our days .. coz everybody else is thinking of where to spend the night and what to ware for this party and so on .. she was only staying home with this power within .. the power of dream.. she never give up about anything .. at first she didn't really knew what she wanted to do in her life but as time passed she had a big image she want to have her own school one day and she want to become a writer coz she believes that one day she'll be able to help hundred of broken souls living among us <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" />.. and teach them how to deal with life in a perfect way and how to overcome all the sadness within .. don't hate anyone or get angry .. always tell the ppl u love how much u care about them . life is short and bad ..if we know the right way to deal with it we'll have no problem at all .. remember that good will always be by ur side so pray alot for him..
<br /><br />* this story is from my imagination and if it has any resembling to someone's life then it's all by coincidence ..

<br />A w, h and y even the word got a why within it.. A wise man asked me if I get an exam paper with only a WHY in it what would I answer? .. at  first idea’s burst into my mind. why? Simple little word with a great meaning.. a word that could have change the world if used properly,, how many times in our life have we used the word!! But have we think of why as a why? .. 
<br />One would wonder why was I born !! ? other might say why am I poor or rich !! ? thousands if not millions of questions has passed through our mind and before we know the word why have become a part of our life.. 
<br />How would  I life without a why would be ?.. I wonder .. if we didn’t have the why we wouldn’t have all the great stuff in our life.. we wouldn’t learn about the moon or about the past life or even the future.. 
<br />A why.. has opened a lot of doors before our eyes .. has giving us the power to discover and to act..
<br />A why has a major role in freeing slaves for if a single guy havn’t thinks of a why!! Who would know how things will be now..  we would have a dull life with no action .. we would have no life at all !! 
<br />It’s a weapon a great one indeed. A weapon of revealing new things in our life.. in changing a lot of what have to be changed.. in giving the power and strength to someone in need.. 
<br />Why is the portal to other questions.. a portal to know the answers of some if not all the questions we eager to know, to seek.. and then of course it’s our way to why not !!!

<br />Light is fighting through the way,
<br />Looking for the little gap to escape,
<br />Seeking ur heart.. 
<br />Seeking ur soul,
<br />Longing to fill it with light,
<br />But the way to ur heart is blocked.. 
<br />Locked by the darkness within..
<br />What’s going on .. 
<br />Zombies are fighting in ur head.. 
<br />Making u do bad stuff .. bad stuff..
<br />U need to fight it all .. 
<br />The darkness.. the blackness locking ur heart and soul.. 
<br />U need to fight it all .. 
<br />Till u find ur way .. 
<br />Search hard for the gap .. 
<br />Look inside u .. 
<br />If u didn't find it .. then look more .. 
<br />Till u find the way .. 
<br />And the light finally over come ur fears .. 
<br />Overcome the hate,the rage and the vengeance.. 
<br />Till it defeat that darkness within u .. 
<br />And finally find ur way to a better life .. 
<br />Better soul .. better start .. 
<br />My boy ..
