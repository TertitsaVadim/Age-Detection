<br /><br />Walking In The Rain Lyrics by A1 | My Music<br />Sitting by the window singing songs of love<br />Wishing you were here because the memory's not enough<br />Wear my mask in silence pretending I'm alright<br />If you could see then you would be here standing by my side<br /><br />It may be hard to believe<br />But girl you're the only one I need<br />It may be hard along the way<br />It's this feeling that I get when blue skies turn to gray<br /><br />Feels like I'm walking in the rain<br />I find myself trying to wash away the pain<br />'Cause I need you to give me some shelter<br />'Cause I'm fading away and baby, I'm walking in the rain, oh oh<br /><br />Every single hour of every single day<br />I need to cry, my eyes are dry, I've cried my tears away<br />Can't help but remember how you made me feel<br />You dressed my soul and made me whole, you made my life complete<br /><br />It may be hard to believe<br />But girl you're the only one I need<br />It may be hard along the way<br />It's this feeling that I get when blue skies turn to gray<br /><br />Feels like I'm walking in the rain<br />I find myself trying to

<br /><br />Day after day, I must face a world of strangers<br />Where I don't belong, I'm not that strong<br />It's nice to know that there's someone I can turn to<br />Who will always care, you're always there<br /><br />When there's no getting over that rainbow<br />When my smallest of dreams won't come true<br />I can take all the madness the world has to give<br />But, I won't last a day without you<br /><br />So, many times when the city seems to be<br />Without a friendly face, a lonely place<br />It's nice to know that you'll be there if I need you<br />And you'll always smile, it's all worthwhile<br /><br />When there's no getting over that rainbow<br />When my smallest of dreams won't come true<br />I can take all the madness the world has to give<br />But I won't last a day without you<br /><br />Touch me and I end up singing<br />Trouble seems to up and disappear<br />You touch me with the love you're bringing<br />I can't really lose when you're near<br />When you're near, my love<br /><br />If all my friends have forgotten half their promises<br />They're not unkind, just hard to find<br />One look at you and I know<br />That
