When that happens, we may blame and criticize ourselves or just give up or tell ourselves we don't genuinely care anyway. We begin to feel hopeless, helpless, and powerless.<br /><br />It is Not Just You<br /><br />In his book, &quot;Alter or Die&quot; Alan Deutschman cites research showing that even when patients are faced with death if they do not make changes (such as stop smoking, workout, eat healthier) only 1 in TEN is in a position to make the essential modifications. That is when the decision is alter or die!<br /><br />So, if you have been unsuccessful in creating changes in your life, you are not alone. No need to beat oneself up you are just being human! Many studies and our own private experiences tell us that facts, worry, &quot;shoulds&quot; and &quot;ought to's&quot; don't support folks change.<br /><br />What does aid?

I've criticized myself as lacking discipline and persistence.<br /><br />But perhaps I just haven't identified the appropriate (for me) teacher and method of instruction that would give me the belief I could succeed, the encouragement and guidance as I learned new expertise, and the new view of myself as a piano player.<br /><br />Here's an instance of success I've had with the three keys.
