Because it must synthesize one kind of compound similar to the natural multi-peptide, also must connect each kind of optical rotation amino acid to certain length the peptide chain according to certain order, when needed to combine  one kind of amino acid the carboxyl group and another kind of amino acid amino, must prevent to combine identical kind of amino acid mutually, therefore, in synthesis , it must protect certain aminos or the carboxyl group,In order to react in the way which is required to carry on.
<br /><br />24424-99-5 is one well capable protecting agent for amino acid , utilized specially in the amino acid amino protection, widely applied in the medicine, the protein and the multi-peptide synthesis, biochemistry food, the cosmetics and many kinds of product synthesis.In. Compared with the traditional amino acid protecting agent like chloro-carbonic acid animal pen ester, the chloro-carbonic acid - P wu formic acid, it has the following merit: 
<br />1.Competitive price 
<br />2.No intense irritant flavor, no harm to human body, but may cause skin allergy if contact the skin directly, and may strip with water. 
<br />3.Using this product to synthesize the multi-peptides, the remove condition of this protection gene is temperate, and it is easier to separate the responded product compared with using other types of amino acid protecting agent. 
<br />4.Has the ignitability, but does not belong to flammable explosive
<br /><br />Here are some basic information about <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5qaW5jaGVtaWNhbC5jb20vZW5nL3Byb2R1Y3RTaG93LTk1Lmh0bWw_" target="_blank">24424-99-5</a>

Because to synthetize a kind of compound same as natural polypeptide, must take all kinds of optical rotation amino acids sequentially connected to a certain length of polypeptide chains,when combine this carboxyl with that amino between two kinds of amino acid, should prevent the same amino acid molecules combined with each other.So, when synthesis, must get certain amino or carboxyl groups protected, so that the reaction can carry out as the requirements. This product is just a kind of amino acid protective agent with good performance, especially for amino protection, widely used in medicine, protein and peptide synthesis, biochemistry food, cosmetics and other products synthesis.
<br /><br />At present, in the domestic market,quality difference of boc is very big. Although main content from some manufacturers can reach to 99%,the contents of impurity, solvents and heavy metals are still very high, and the quality is unstable. These quality grades generally only can be used for non medical or for the low quality requirements.
<br />For some pharmaceutical enterprises, who have high quality requirements, the main content is at least up to 99.5%. However, the manufacturers can be numbered that purity up to 99.5%,and never use solvents prohibited by FDA,then get heavy metals or compound impurities.
<br /><br />In recent years,through refined research about process,repeated tests, use the solvents totally meet the USA FDA scope, Jinxiang chemical had produced high quality  of 24424-99-5,which not contain isopropyl and sec-butyl group, no heavy metal impurities. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5qaW5jaGVtaWNhbC5jb20vZW5nL3Byb2R1Y3RTaG93LTk1Lmh0bWw_" target="_blank">24424-99-5</a> from Jinxiang had been approved by the international well-known pharmaceutical companies and formed a strategic cooperation supplier.
