<br /><br />Girl is on the couch making out with a hot guy, her cellphone rings... 
<br /><br />Girl:Hey babe, I'll be right back. I need to take this call. 
<br /><br />Boy: Yeah okay. Sure. 
<br /><br />She walks into the next room. 
<br /><br />Girl: Hey! What's up? 
<br /><br />Guy [on her cellphone]: Nothing, hey hun, do you think we could go do something later tonight? What are the chances my boss let me get out early. 
<br /><br />Girl: Yeah, sounds great! 
<br /><br />Guy [on her cellphone]: Okay. I'm right by your house, I'll come to get you now. 
<br /><br />Girl: That's not such a good idea... 
<br /><br />Guy [on her cellphone]: Why not? 
<br /><br />Girl: I'm busy right now... sorry. 
<br /><br />Guy [on her cellphone]: With what? It's our anniversary! You didn't make any other plans did you...? 
<br />In her head she yells, CRAP! Throws clothes back on quickly. 
<br /><br />Girl: No No... I was just eating... with the family. 
<br /><br />Guy [on her cellphone]: But I thought you said your family was away this weekend, up at your resort? 
<br /><br />The guy walks into her house, turns the corner into the hallway. Goes downstairs, and finds his best friend on her couch, half un-dressed, trying to pull his pants back on and his girlfriend pulling her shirt over her head. 
<br /><br />Guy: What the heck is going on?! 
<br /><br />Girl: I can explain! Please listen to me! 
<br /><br />Guy: Benny? How could you do this to me! Rachel! I thought you loved me! And yet, your sleeping with MY BEST FRIEND!!!! 
<br /><br />Girl: John...! 
<br /><br />John with tears in his eyes, he rushes out of room, and slams the door. 
<br /><br />Benny climbs out of the window, starts his car, and drives off down the street. 
<br /><br />Girl runs after her boyfriend. Yelling.... 
<br /><br />Girl: NOOOO! Please!! Come back John!! Pleeeeeasssse????!! She falls down and cries. 
<br /><br />John turns around, looks straight at his girlfriend in tears. 
<br /><br />John: Why? Rachel, why? I loved you! Oh my God, I'm in love with a whore. Does this mean I have to pay you now?! 
<br />Here take this as the cash. He drops a ring box on her lap. 
<br /><br />She opens the ring box. Her jaw drops... Before her eyes is a diamond wedding ring. 
<br /><br />Girl: You were going to propose? 
<br /><br />Guy: Yeah... how dumb was I? And as he slowly walked back to his car, his headlights faded... And she was in despair. 
<br /><br />Later that night, the girl got a phone call from the police saying he had died of an overdose of drugs and when they found him he had a picture of him and her in his hands

<br /><br />...But when I call you coon, jiggaboo, Kike, sand nigger, rag head ,Towelhead, WOP, Camel Jockey, Gook, nigger, slant eyes or Chink you call me a racist. 
<br /><br />-You say that whites commit a lot of violence against you, so why are the ghettos the most dangerous places to live? 
<br /><br />-You have the United Negro College Fund. 
<br /><br />-You have Martin Luther King Day.

<br /><br />Isnt it funny you can change your music taste to impress someone but when it comes to a person who likes thier own music and her own style, you give her a mouthful? 
<br /><br />Isnt it funny that a guy can get away with being a gangsta but the emo gets a mouthful from everyone 
<br /><br />are you laughing? 
<br /><br />Isnt it funny an emo can be quiet all through the week but gets more shit from everyone than the girl who sleeps around and sells her virginity? 
<br /><br />Isnt it funny that you dont mind your friends drinking, smoking but the minute someone mentions emo music you can give them a lecture on melodramatic teenage outcasts? 
<br /><br />im not laughing 
<br /><br />Its so funny that you and your friends can make a persons life hell and not know anything about the silent battle they might be fighting. 
<br /><br />Isnt it funny that you can call emos, punks, goths the retards but still manage to get through your day without an inch of guilt in your heart. 
<br /><br />HOW YOU CAN CALL SOMEONE A POSER, HOW CAN YOU SAY &quot;YOUR NOT EMO&quot; OR &quot;ATTENTION SEEKER&quot; WITHOUT SPENDING A SECOND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHY THERE ARE CUTS ON HER WRISTS AND WHY THEY SPENDS THEIR LUNCHTIMES CRYING INSTEAD OR LAUGHING WITH THEIR FRIENDS 
<br /><br />keep on laughing 
<br /><br />Isnt it funny you can say and do all this without any idea of what is going on in this persons life 
<br />without knowing her situation with her friends 
<br />or their family 
<br />or their LIFE 
<br /><br />BRAVE ISNT GOING UP ON STAGE AND STRIPPING 
<br />BRAVE IS NOT SAYING A SPEECH 
<br /><br />BRAVE IS 
<br />GOING TO SCHOOL ON MUFTI DAY AND NOT FOR A SECOND CARE WHAT THE IDIOTS AROUND YOU ARE SAYING ABOUT YOUR CLOTHES 
<br />ITS LISTENING TO YOUR OWN MUSIC AND BEING PROUD OF IT 
<br />ITS GOING THROUGH EVERY DAY WITH THE THINGS PEOPLE SAY TO YOUR FACE AND BEHIND YOUR BACK AND YOU STILL KEEP QUIET 
<br />ITS KNOWING WHAT YOUR &quot;FRIENDS&quot; ARE SAYING ABOUT YOU AND STILL CALLING THEM YOUR FRIENDS 
<br />BRAVE IS KNOWING THAT TOMOROW ISNT A BRIGHT AND HAPPY FUTURE 
<br />ITS ANOTHER DAY OF BITCHING AND DODGING RUMORS 
<br /><br />keep on laughing

<br />how could she be dead
<br />they all said
<br /><br />A friend stepped forward
<br />looked at everyone
<br />said &quot;shame on all of you
<br /><br />Can't you see
<br />she's dead because
<br />of all of you
<br /><br />She called me often
<br />crying her beautiful green eyes out
<br />telling me how each of you hurt her in some way
<br /><br />She alway put a fake smile
<br />to please all of you
<br />a laugh when really she wanted to cry
<br /><br />But most of all die
<br />thank you all for killing her
<br />she was my best friend
<br /><br />I hope you're all happy now
<br />i know she is
<br />and that God is holding her
<br /><br />In his strong arms
<br />bringing her back to life
<br />so he can help her stand up there with Him
<br /><br />She just wanted to be loved
<br />and cared for 
<br />she trusted everyone of you
<br /><br />But you disappointed her
<br />made her grieve
<br />stepped on her shattered heart
<br /><br />Thank-you 
<br />if only you had really seen her
<br />like i did you'd understand
<br /><br />But you didn't
<br />she needed all of you
<br />she loved all of you
<br /><br />This is how you repay her.&quot;

Well he gave me his number to call him the next day so we could talk more, but I told him to call me instead because I was too nervous to call him so i gave him my number. The next morning at 10:00am he called me cause it was a saturday, we talked for like 10minutes then I had to go eat, so I told him I'd call him back after I got done eating. And I did, we talk just about the whole day, and we had some pretty kool conversions, that I enjoyed a lot. Well after a few days he asked me to be his girlfriend and I told him yes. We talked everynight sometime from 9:00pm until 6:00am when iI had to go to skool. I always hated saying goodbye, but a lot of the time I didn't have to because he'd sing me to sleep...my favorite song Truly Madly Deeply.... Then Christmas came and he didn't have anyone to spend it with because he was living with his friend because his dad kicked him out and his mom &quot;didn't have room for him&quot; so I asked my grandpa if it'sd be okay if he came over to our house and he said it'd be fine. I got sooooooooo happy because I'd see him for the first time. So I asked my mom if she'd go get him and she said she would, I was sooooo excided that the night before we were going to get him I couldn't sleep at all! So we stayed up all night talking, but about 5:30am i finally fell asleep then at 6:00am my mom came in my room to wake me up so we could go get him. Oh my gosh I was tired, but i got dressed and we left. It was about a 3hour drive, partly because my mom got us a little lost, but we finally got there, I was so nervous when we got into Port Orange, but we pulled into the gas station to wait for him, my mom went in to use the &quot;little ladies room&quot; so i was left out in the car by myself. After a minute I see a person walking down the street heading for the gas station, that made me way way nervous, cuz I knew it was him. So he came up to my car and I got out and it felt a little weird, because I didn't know if he was going to hug me or kiss me, we just stood there for a second so I finally just huged him, I felt so safe and comforted...it was unbelievable...
<br /><br />well that's all i wanna say.....I'm starting to get a little emotional just thinking about him...because we broke up and he won't talk to me...so yeah...

<br /><br />It's your first time. 
<br /><br />As you lie back your muscles tighten. 
<br /><br />You put him off for a while searching for an excuse, 
<br /><br />but he refuses to be swayed as he approaches you. 
<br /><br />He asks if you're afraid and you shake your head bravely. 
<br /><br />He has had more experience, 
<br /><br />but it's the first time his finger has found the right place. 
<br /><br />He probes deeply and you shiver; 
<br /><br />your body tenses; 
<br /><br />but he's gentle like he promised he'd be. 
<br /><br />He looks deeply within your eyes and tells you to trust him- 
<br /><br />he's done this many times before. 
<br /><br />His cool smile relaxes you 
<br /><br />and you open wider to give him more room for an easy entrance. 
<br /><br />You begin to plead and beg him to hurry, 
<br /><br />but he slowly takes his time, 
<br /><br />wanting to cause you as little pain as possible. 
<br /><br />As he presses closer, 
<br /><br />going deeper, 
<br /><br />you feel the tissue give way, 
<br /><br />pain surges throughout your body 
<br /><br />and you feel the slight trickle of blood as he continues. 
<br /><br />He looks at you concerned and asks you if it's too painful. 
<br /><br />Your eyes are filled with tears 
<br /><br />but you shake your head and nod for him to go on. 
<br /><br />He begins going in and out 
<br /><br />with skill but you are now too numb to feel him within you. 
<br /><br />After a few moments, 
<br /><br />you feel something bursting within you 
<br /><br />and he pulls it out of you, 
<br /><br />you lay panting, 
<br /><br />glad to have it over. 
<br /><br />He looks at you and smiling warmly, 
<br /><br />tells you, 
<br /><br />with a chuckle, 
<br /><br />that you have been his most stubborn 
<br /><br />yet most rewarding experience. 
<br /><br />You smile and thank your dentist. 
<br /><br />After all, 
<br /><br />it was your first time to have a tooth pulled.

<br />Saying something and wishing you hadn't? or saying nothing and wishing you had? I guess the most important things are the hardest  things to say. Don't be afraid to tell someone you love them. If you do, they might break your heart...if you don't, you might break theirs. Have you ever decided not to become a  couple because you were so afraid  of losing what you already had with that person? Your heart decides whom it likes and  whom it doesn't. You can't tell your heart  what to do. 
<br />It does it on its own....when you least suspect it, or even when you don't want it  to. Have you ever wanted to love someone with everything you had, but that other  person was too afraid to let you? 
<br />Too many of us stay walled up because we are too afraid to care too  much...for fear that the other person does not care as much, or even at  all. Have you ever denied your feelings for someone because your fear of rejection was too hard to handle? We tell lies when we are afraid... afraid of what we don't know, afraid of what others will  think, afraid of what will be found out about us. But every  time  we tell a lie, the thing we fear grows  stronger. Life is all about risks and it requires you to jump. Don't be a person who has to look back and wonder  what they would have done, or could  have  had. * What would you do if every time you fell in love you had to say  good-bye? *What would you do if every time you wanted someone they would never be  there? *What would you do if your best friend died tomorrow and you never got to tell them how you felt? (even if it is that you don't care  anymore)*What would you do if you loved someone more than ever and you couldn't have them? *What would you do  if you never got the chance  to  say I am friends with all of my family and they know I love them?* People live, but people die. 
<br />And I want to tell you that you are a  friend. If you died tomorrow , you would be in my heart!!! Would I be in yours? If you care about me as much as I  care about you, you will send this back. You might be best friends one year, pretty good friends the next year, don't talk that often the next, and don't want to talk at all the year after that. So, I just wanted to say, even if I never talk to you again  in my life, you are special to me and you have made a difference in my life,look up to you, respect you, and truly cherish you. Send this to all your friends, no matter how often you talk, or how close you are, and send it to the person who sent  it to you if you consider them a friend as well. Let old friends know you haven't forgotten them, and tell new friends  you never will. Remember, everyone needs a friend, 
<br />someday you might feel like  you have NO FRIENDS at all, just remember this e-mail and take comfort in knowing somebody out  there cares about you and .. always will.. I LOVE YOU!!!! 
<br />Send this to all the friends that you have...all the friends  that you've lost...and to all the friends you've lost touch with...just to let  them know that you care.. 
<br /><br />If you got this email, it means that the person who sent it  to you loves you  and always will, no matter what.

<br />In memory of little London Marie, i thought id start a little forward.. 
<br />Jessica had a message that i want every one to know.. 
<br /><br />This is what Jessica said: 
<br /><br />&quot;If anyone has kids, make sure that you keep them with you the whole time. Don't give then to anyone that you don't trust. Trust me, I thought that I trusted Josh. But now as of December 4, 2007 at 2:29 AM, she is gone. My one &amp; only baby . &amp; He is going to pay FOREVER, even if he gets out of jail scott free, he will be dead no matter what. &amp; To all my friends that know London, I am very angry &amp; upset that I lost the love of my life, my babygirl. She died on her three month birthday . London had six fractured ribs, both of her legs were fracture, &amp; her brain was so damaged that if she were to live she would be a vegetable. 
<br /><br />So I did what was right &amp; what was best for her &amp; took her off life support 
<br /><br />That's what you call Shaken Baby Sydrome [SBS]&quot; 
<br /><br />For those of you who dont know what Shaken Baby Syndrome check out the facts ; 
<br /><br />-Shaking, jerking and jolting can cause blood vessels in the head to tear or burst.Shaken Baby Syndrome is the shaking of an infant or child by the arms, legs, or shoulders with or without impact of the head. 
<br /><br />This trauma can result in bleeding and brain injury with no outward signs of abuse 
<br /><br />Often frustrated caregivers feel that shaking a baby or small child is a harmless way to make the child stop crying. However, a baby's brain and blood vessels are vulnerable to whiplash motions, such as shaking, jerking, jolting, and impact. 
<br /><br />The neck muscles of an infant or small child are weak, so the child's head is relatively heavy and the neck cannot support the stress of shaking or impact 
<br /><br />-Shaking a very young child, with or without impact of the head, can cause irreversible brain damage, blindness, cerebral palsy, hearing loss, spinal cord injury, seizures, learning disabilities, and even death. 
<br /><br />It is tragic that healthy, intelligent babies are suffering these disabilities simply because their caregivers don't know about the dangers associated with Shaken Baby Syndrome 
<br /><br />An estimated 1,200 to 1,400 cases of Shaken Baby Syndrome (SBS) occur each year in the United States 
<br /><br />Only 1 out of 4 babies dies of Shaken Baby Syndrome 
<br /><br />HOWEVER, the other three babies will need ongoing medical attention for the rest of their short lifespans
