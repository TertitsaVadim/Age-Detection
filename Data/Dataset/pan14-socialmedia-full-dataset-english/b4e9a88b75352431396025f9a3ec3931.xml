Having a full figure doesn’t mean you can’t have the wedding dress of your dreams. In today’s bridal market, you can find a <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5tbHRhaWxvci5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcmllcy93ZWRkaW5nLWFwcGFyZWwvd2VkZGluZy1kcmVzc2VzL3BsdXMtc2l6ZS13ZWRkaW5nLWRyZXNzZXMv" target="_blank">plus size wedding dress</a>with all the features of a misses’ size. Enjoy your big day even more when you are wearing a dress in which you feel beautiful and confident.
<br /><br />Instructions
<br />•Take accurate measurements before you head out to the bridal shop to look for a plus size wedding dress. You can supply the sales clerk with this information, which may help identify those dresses which can be made in larger sizes to fit your bust, waist and hip measurements.
<br />•Wear the kind of supportive undergarments you might wear on the day of your wedding when you shop for plus size wedding gowns. You should also wear them for all of your fittings to ensure accurate alterations in the dress you buy.
<br />•Shop for a dress that will de-emphasize your problem areas while bring attention to your best features. This will involve becoming familiar with the variety of silhouettes available in the bridal gown market.
<br />•Seek out slim A-line dresses if you have a pear-shaped figure. These draw attention to your bust and shoulders while minimizing the appearance of your waist and hips.
<br />•Find a princess-cut dress if you want to show off your longer torso and slimmer waist. These dresses have the bodice and skirt cut in one, providing the body with a slimming, long line from shoulder to just below the waist, where the skirt can be cut into an A-line, hiding wider hips and rear.
<br />•Shop for a cover-up to wear with your strapless or tank-style gown. Since strapless  bridal gowns continue to be popular in bridal fashion, you can use this option to cover up problem areas in your arms and shoulders without having to have a sleeved gown custom-made.
<br />•Buy a dress with a heavier-weight fabric. Since bias-cut and knit fabrics tend to cling to every curve, they should be avoided in favor of heavy-weight fabrics which help shape your body.
<br />•Buy your dress at least 6 months in advance of your wedding date to allow plenty of time for construction and delivery. Most <strong>plus size dresses </strong>can’t be bought straight off the rack.
<br />Tips &amp; Warnings
<br />Avoid satin and other shiny fabrics, which reflect light and make you look larger. Opt for lace or other textured fabrics.
<br />Keep in mind that most sample wedding dresses come in the equivalent of a size 6 in sportswear. Phone the bridal shop in advance to ask for larger sizes to be made available for your appointment.

<br />Michelle Williams – Hot Off the Spring 2012 Runway
<br />Paris Fashion Week just finished last week, but next season’s gowns are already hitting the red carpet. If you were curious as to how the bevy of sheer, boudoir-inspired gowns would translate from the runway, look to Michelle Williams for a lovely, slightly more modest take. For the New York premiere of her upcoming Marilyn Monroe biopic My Week With Marilyn, Michelle chose the seafoam green chiffon gown from Dior’s Spring ’12 collection. She added a slip, the belt from the show, and a cocktail ring. Michelle kept her makeup minimal, going for dewy skin. We love the fresh, glowing, elegant look.

<br />Last night, many celebs and New Yorkers attended the L’Oreal Paris Legends Gala to benefit the Ovarian Cancer Research Fund (OCRF). In the picture below, Kerry Washington, Taraji P. Henson and Michael Michele (Gossip Girl) came together and dressed to the nines. Let’s have a look at their celebrity dresses!
<br />The belles of the ball each took a different approach to evening glamour to arrive at the dinner program held at the American Museum of Natural History. Kerry Washington joined the ranks of her fellow L’Oreal spokeswomen Juliana Margulies (the evening’s host) and Andie MacDowell, and shined in a stunning long-sleeved Ralph Lauren evening gown. The warm, bronzy creation really complemented her skin tone and she played up the overall glow with Lorraine Schwartz and Ralph Lauren necklaces, a smoky eye and soft waves.
<br />Meanwhile, Taraji and Michael both stood out in bright blue. Michael’s off-the shoulder Alberta Ferretti gown featured a playful bow detailing in the back and she matched the dress with jewel drop earrings. Taraji went for a sexy mid-calf Herve Leroux dress paired with strappy Jimmy Choo heels.
<br />The most fab detail of the evening: the fete—which included a silent auction produced by Harper’s Bazaar, Marie Claire, Town &amp; Country and Veranda magazines. The night raised $2.1 million dollars for the cause. Over the last 14 years, L’Oreal Paris has helped raise more than $19 million for OCRF.

Jennifer Love Hewitt has taken it to the extreme with her love of the bandage dress. Now, let’s look at her <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5tbHRhaWxvci5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcmllcy9zcGVjaWFsLW9jY2FzaW9uLWRyZXNzZXMvY2VsZWJyaXR5LWRyZXNzZXMv" target="_blank">celebrity dresses</a>.
<br /><br />The 32-year-old unveiled her latest acquisition outside her Toluca Lake home on November 3rd (evening); a black bandage dress clothing with a front gold zip.
<br /><br />The actress was heading to the premiere of Leonardo DiCaprio’s new film J. Edgar and brought some glamour to her quiet suburban neighborhood.
<br />Showing off her fantastic curves Jennifer jumped into her limousine and arrived shortly afterwards at Grauman’s Chinese Theatre in Hollywood, California.

<br />Last week she wore a similar dress to the premiere of Like Crazy and teamed the navy blue outfit with a pair of grey Louboutins.
<br /><br />The pint-sized star is suited to these dresses as her weight often fluctuates. Last year she was noticeably thinner when she opted for a sky blue bandage dress.
<br />She now appears to have a bigger bust and a more soft and voluptuous figure, in contrast to the trim shape she previously favored.

The Bride Show has some unexpected answers to that question! The annual wedding event, comprising The Bride Show Abu Dhabi and The Bride Show Dubai, has just revealed the results of its survey. Let’s sneak a peek at the findings!
<br />The survey, which included over 700 ladies, discovered that brides in the region clearly prefer classic fashion to celebrity fads. Think Kate Middleton over Kim Kardashian!
<br /><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/170048051_2811591_46621088.jpg" />
<br />Out of the total number of women who participated, just under half said that they preferred a traditional wedding look, like the Sarah Burton for Alexander McQueen dress worn by the Duchess of Cambridge at her wedding to Prince William in April 2011.
<br />The actual demand for Kate-style <strong>wedding gowns</strong> was high in the region too. Joumana Al Hayek, Owner and Head Designer at Dar Sara revealed, “The British royal wedding had a huge impact on our clients’ tastes. Over the past few months we’ve been asked to copy Catherine’s dress, or to design something equally as elegant. It is interesting to me that her dress was quite close to the Arabic tradition, which favors a covered, graceful and luxurious style.”
<br /><br />Scoring much lower on the wedding dress popularity charts in the survey was Kim Kardashian. Less than a third of the survey respondents said that they wanted to copy the style of a celeb like the reality TV star, whose marriage to Kris Humphries lasted just 72 days. Kim had three wedding dresses, all designed by Vera Wang, when she married Kris in August 2011.
<br />Elaborate couture was the next leading pick in the survey, with 27 per cent of brides choosing it for themselves. Bohemian style did the worst, with just about 4 per cent of the women surveyed choosing it.
<br />And as a bride-to-be, what kind of wedding dress do you want?

<br />Charlize Theron visited “The Tonight Show with Jay Leno” to promote her latest movie, ‘Young Adult’, earlier this week. She wore a Christian Dior Resort 2012 maxi dress. Her polka-dot long-sleeve dress, with a necktie and pendant dangling from the waist tie, was worn with a black Stella McCartney blazer to prevent the look from feeling too casual.
<br />Charlize styled her wavy locks into a chic updo and accessorized with Melinda Maria bangles and gold-hooped earrings. Snakeskin crisscross Reed Krakoff ‘Boxer’ sandals completed her look. Gals, take Charlize Theron’s lead. It looked great.

Yes, Britney Spears and Jason Trawick just got engaged. And we are wondering about the wedding. What type of <strong>wedding dress</strong> will she wear? Where in the world will she tie the knot? Who will be invited?
<br /><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/170048051_14817082_46844797.jpg" />
<br />Longtime boyfriend and former agent Jason Trawick reportedly proposed to the singer on Thursday night, while the couple was celebrating his 40th birthday.
<br />A source tells US Weekly magazine, “This is something they’ve both wanted for a long time.”
<br />Trawick and Spears are planning to celebrate the big news with family and friends on Friday night (16Dec11) at Planet Hollywood in Las Vegas, according to the publication.
<br />And Spears appears to have confirmed the news in a Friday morning tweet, writing: “OMG. Last night Jason surprised me with the one gift I’ve been waiting for. Can’t wait to show you! SO SO SO excited!!!!”
<br />The couple met in 2006 when Trawick began representing Spears while she was still married to Kevin Federline. They became an item in 2009.
