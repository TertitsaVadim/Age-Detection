<br />Love is like a war, easy to begin, hard to end
<br />Girls are forever, guys are whatever. 
<br />When worst comes to worst, MY GIRLS COME FIRST
<br />Craddle to the Grave!!!!
<br /><br />People will always lie but true love will never die!!
<br /> Through rain or snow, love will always flow 
<br />No matter what you fear, always keep your true love near!
<br />illness can think what it pleases,But love will cure all diseases.
<br />Love will always stay pure!!!

Friendship means the world to me if I have a goodgood friend and they brake that friendship I will de devistated.......... I never have had very many tight friendships becasue when I get a tigth freindship the person moves away I am crushed cause they move so far that when I want to call them it is long distance.....Like one of my friends I was tight with her,, her name was Angelique and her brothers name was Nick and I was tight with them untill they decided to move all the way to Texas and I ahven't seen them since but we keep in touch through emails and letters.. When I move I will tell my close buddies that I will call tehm at least once a week and maybe see them once or twice a month at the least.........I wish no one has to go through a tight friend moving away.......

<br /><br />Your on the edge
<br /><br />A single push could throw you over
<br /><br />But you hold your balance
<br /><br />And you hang in as long as you can
<br /><br />What if you fall
<br /><br />What awaits you
<br /><br />Know one else knows 
<br /><br />Not even you
<br /><br />Keep secrets to yourself
<br /><br />Know one can get under your skin
<br /><br />But you suddenly fall into the water 
<br /><br />And you see comming toward you a fin
<br /><br />What if you fall
<br /><br />What awaits you
<br /><br />But now you know 
<br /><br />So what are you gonna do 
<br /><br />You swim for your life
<br /><br />But you already know its hopeless
<br /><br />You turn around to fight it
<br /><br />But its to late
<br /><br />What if you fall
<br /><br />What awaits you
<br /><br />But now you Know
<br /><br />So what are you gonna do
<br /><br />You never thought of a plan
<br /><br />For if you fall
<br /><br />But now its to late for you
<br /><br />So long, nice knowing you
<br /><br />What if you fall
<br /><br />What awaits you
<br /><br />Know one else knows 
<br /><br />Not even you
<br /><br />Not even you
<br /><br />Not even you 
<br /><br />Not even 
<br /><br />YOU

<br /><br />I face nature
<br /><br />I do it alone 
<br /><br />Know ones kind enough
<br /><br />To lend me a helping hand
<br /><br />The rains falls down 
<br /><br />It falls all around
<br /><br />Into the nooks and crannies
<br /><br />The rain comes down 
<br /><br />I face nature 
<br /><br />I do it alone
<br /><br />Know ones kind enough
<br /><br />To lend me a helping hand
<br /><br />When you face the rain
<br /><br />Or mother nature
<br /><br />Prepare to face the pain
<br /><br />From mother nature 
<br /><br />I face nature 
<br /><br />I do it alone 
<br /><br />Know ones kind enough
<br /><br />To lend me a helping hand
<br /><br />I travel the world
<br /><br />Avoiding what nature throws at me
<br /><br />If i don't
<br /><br />It could become a life or death situation
<br /><br />I face nature
<br /><br />I do it alone
<br /><br />Know ones kind enough
<br /><br />To lend me a helping hand
