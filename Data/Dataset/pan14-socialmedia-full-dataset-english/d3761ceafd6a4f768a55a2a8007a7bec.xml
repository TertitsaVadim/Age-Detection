And some friction.
<br /><br />The appointment of the first government of Jean-Marc Ayrault had already caused some heartburn,<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5rYXJlbm1pbGxlbi1tYWxsdWsuY29t" target="_blank"><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.karenmillen-malluk.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.karenmillen-malluk.com</a></a>especially among socialist senators. Francois Hollande not count on a lot of followers, who have actively contributed to the preparation of his campaign, the organization of its networks and its rise to power. They have also enabled her to win the primary in his camp and <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5rYXJlbm1pbGxlbi1tYWxsdWsuY29t" target="_blank">karen millen</a>then to carry it to victory in the presidential election.
<br /><br />His fellow senators felt somewhat &quot;forgotten&quot;. Nicole Bricq only appeared in the first government. In the balance last minute, several &quot;potential ministers&quot; out of the pond of the Luxembourg Palace were sacrificed. Starting with the group's boss, François Rebsamen,<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5rYXJlbm1pbGxlbi1tYWxsdWsuY29t" target="_blank">karen millen dresses</a>forced to grin and cons heart. Or others, such as Didier Guillaume, Thierry André Vallini or Repentin.
<br /><br />SERIES jolts
<br /><br />At the first meeting of the Socialist Group in the Senate held between the presidential and legislative elections, in the presence of Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault, Alain Vidal, karen millen the minister responsible for relations with Parliament, and Jean Bel-Pierre, President of the Senate, several elected officials have sent the message. The second government Ayrault then saw the arrival of three new ministers from the Senate.
<br /><br />The installation of the new National Assembly was accompanied by a series of jolts. The election of the PS candidate for the presidency of the Palais Bourbon revealed some enemies, including Segolene Royal - if she had been barred by his constituents - would certainly have paid the price. More surprising still, the head of government is not able to convince his Minister Marylise Lebranchu be a candidate, she was so unsure that the operation was successful. Claude Bartolone has cleverly his own way.
<br /><br />The new leader of the socialist deputies, Bruno Le Roux, karen millen outlet will have to manage both a group and deeply renewed relations with partners, already, are showing signs of a bad mood. The rebuff he was sentenced by his troops on the award of a standing committee chair to ecologists shows that the group is not &quot;orders&quot;. Although no one challenged him on his election as head of the group, he will have some time to reach its mark.
<br /><br />MAJORITY DISPERSED IN FOUR GROUPS
<br /><br />Especially since the pressure will not fail. And that the dispersion of the majority in four groups will not make things easier. The PS would have gladly excused from having to contend with the radical left, a fourth thief. He could not avoid it. Empowering MPs PRG is not in itself good news for him.
<br /><br />With environmentalists and the Left Front, the distribution of posts of responsibility resulted from the outset to some tensions. Unhappy to see them escape the presidency of the Committee on Sustainable Development, the first refused, Tuesday, June 26, Claude Bartolone vote for the presidency of the Assembly. Warning toll.
<br /><br />The next day, karen millen dresses the president of the Democratic and Republican Left group, Chassaigne Andre, who found &quot;particularly objectionable&quot; the refusal of the PS group to assign to his vice-presidency or a committee chairmanships. &quot;This decision reflects a political stance that will not, tomorrow, a real change, says Mr. Chassaigne. If these guidelines are confirmed, I doubt that we can express a favorable vote&quot; to the question of confidence that will pose the first Minister, Tuesday, July 3, after his policy statement.

<br /><br />&quot;THE TIME IS NOT THE LONELY TRAIL TOURS&quot;
<br /><br />Wauquiez goes further than just support by encouraging Mr. Cope to step aside to make way for former Prime Minister: &quot;In the last period before us, we can not afford the luxury of fighting sterile.

<br /><br />Mr. Wauquiez is considered as a long-standing support of the new deputy of Paris. He specifically made several criticisms of the way the member and mayor of Meaux manages the party with the methods he considers &quot;clan&quot;. He had, during the campaign shied away himself a candidate. A hypothesis that farm today. &quot;I could shake me too my candidacy, he says, but I think the time is not the solitary laps. My obsession is that wars do not break our egos political family. Everyone must make an effort in putting aside his own ambitions. &quot;

<br /><br />But the new president karen millen did not count on a majority in parliament to support his proposed reforms. Bills remained iconic and blocked for four years, foremost among them the tax reform. The tax burden remains the lowest in the hemisphere, there is no tax on personal income, and the agro-exporter, accounting for 30% of GDP, contributing 0.3% of tax revenue! Despite these difficulties, it can claim a substantial adjustment in the culture of corruption of public institutions, a marked expansion of social programs and the introduction of free universal health care, and a change clear perception of the image of Paraguay in the world. Witness, the acceptance in 2009 by Brazil of the renegotiation of the Treaty of Itaipu hydroelectric dam, which led to a doubling of royalties received by the country, an increase of nearly 3% of GDP.
<br /><br />The reaction of Latin American countries, karen millen dresses meeting within the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) and the Organization of American States (OAS), is clear in this regard. They denounced the failure of the democratic order summarily draped constitutional legitimacy and refuse to recognize the government formed by the former vice president, including cables filtered by Wikileaks show that this cherished goal since 2009. Mercosur, comprising Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay, has already suspended the participation of Paraguay, who was chairman pro tempore of the trade bloc, of any decision process, and several countries (Argentina, Ecuador, Venezuela, Uruguay, Chile, Colombia and Brazil) have withdrawn or recalled their ambassadors for consultations in Paraguay.
<br /><br />It is important that France and the European Union, support the democratic process and Paraguay do not rush to recognize an illegitimate government, as some countries have already done unfortunately. The position of President of Uruguay, Jose Mujica, seems a reasonable course of action. Aware of the difficulty in restoring the presidency of Fernando Lugo in the current domestic political context, he asks the rapid achievement of new elections to form a legitimate government, karen millen outlet as the team claims to hold in place until the end of term Lugo in August 2013. This position is likely to be one on which countries will converge in the region. France must firmly support the process of representative political bodies in Latin America face of what constitutes a fatal step backwards in the history of this continent and a new punishment for a people too long a victim of the rapacity of a political class of another age.

Despite these difficulties, it can claim a substantial adjustment in the culture of corruption of public institutions, a marked expansion of social programs and the introduction of free universal health care, and a change clear perception of the image of Paraguay in the world. Witness, the acceptance in 2009 by Brazil of the renegotiation of the Treaty of Itaipu hydroelectric dam, which led to a doubling of royalties received by the country, an increase of nearly 3% of GDP.
<br /><br />The reaction of Latin American countries, karen millen dresses meeting within the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) and the Organization of American States (OAS), is clear in this regard. They denounced the failure of the democratic order summarily draped constitutional legitimacy and refuse to recognize the government formed by the former vice president, including cables filtered by Wikileaks show that this cherished goal since 2009. Mercosur, comprising Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay, has already suspended the participation of Paraguay, who was chairman pro tempore of the trade bloc, of any decision process, and several countries (Argentina, Ecuador, Venezuela, Uruguay, Chile, Colombia and Brazil) have withdrawn or recalled their ambassadors for consultations in Paraguay.
<br /><br />It is important that France and the European Union, support the democratic process and Paraguay do not rush to recognize an illegitimate government, as some countries have already done unfortunately. The position of President of Uruguay, Jose Mujica, seems a reasonable course of action. Aware of the difficulty in restoring the presidency of Fernando Lugo in the current domestic political context, he asks the rapid achievement of new elections to form a legitimate government, karen millen outlet as the team claims to hold in place until the end of term Lugo in August 2013. This position is likely to be one on which countries will converge in the region. France must firmly support the process of representative political bodies in Latin America face of what constitutes a fatal step backwards in the history of this continent and a new punishment for a people too long a victim of the rapacity of a political class of another age.

This increase in injuries and losses (87 killed since 2001, including 25 last year), a scale forgotten since the 1990s, has forced the army to rethink support military families during deployment and return.
<br /><br />&quot;There was a mass effect,<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5rYXJlbm1pbGxlbi1tYWxsdWsuY29t" target="_blank"><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.karenmillen-malluk.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.karenmillen-malluk.com</a></a>said Lt. Col. Maloux, who directs the cell to assist the wounded of the Army (Cabat). Many have serious injuries caused by IEDs [&quot; Improvised Explosive Devices &quot;, frequently placed roadside bombs along the road, one of the leading causes of death of NATO troops in Afghanistan]. They suffer from complex fractures,<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5rYXJlbm1pbGxlbi1tYWxsdWsuY29t" target="_blank">karen millen dresses</a>are burn victims, paraplegic or quadriplegic ... Wives are involved therapeutically, they help the rehabilitation of memory and regaining consciousness by the time their presence in the rooms. &quot;
<br /><br />The army had to adapt its long-term accommodation for relatives who remain with the wounded, often companions, do not isolate themselves completely with going back and forth from hospital to a hotel room. A &quot;family home&quot; to open in December 2013 at the Percy Hospital in Clamart (Hauts-de-Seine),<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5rYXJlbm1pbGxlbi1tYWxsdWsuY29t" target="_blank">karen millen outlet</a>which are processed 70% of serious injuries and long hospitalizations. The place must have 2 apartments and 3 rooms, providing access to a social worker, a lawyer, a psychologist and help recreate the sidelines of the hospital, a social life.
<br /><br />&quot;REDIAL A FAMILY RELATIONSHIP EXTREMELY INSECURE&quot;
<br /><br />Last year, karen millen outlet the Cabat received almost 320 000 euros of the association Terre brotherhood, an organization created in 2005 and revived in 2008 by a former Chief of Staff of the Army, General Bernard Thorette .

But when she leaves this part, when she comes to see the wounded three times, takes a room hotel to be near him, the administration can not do, &quot;said General Thorette.
<br /><br />This is especially true in the case of separated families and stepfamilies, who now represent nearly 40% of cases treated by Cabat. &quot;Faced with these family ties more loose, we should treat people who are often isolated. We need help reconstruct family ties extremely precarious,&quot; says Lt. Col. Maloux.
<br /><br />In recent years, karen millen particularly under the pressure of the Afghan war, the army has also institutionalized its relations with the families of soldiers deployed on operations abroad. Cells to help families provide access to social workers and lawyers. &quot;It is primarily a matter of common sense: when a wife or a spouse needs assistance to complete a tax return, when the washing machine or the car breaks down, we can send to a colleague families and to link with a professional, &quot;said Colonel Francis Contamin, commanding officer of the 31st Engineer Regiment Castelsarrasin (Tarn-et-Garonne), which includes permanently a small number of troops in Afghanistan since 2008.
<br /><br />&quot;IT'S AFRAID BUT IT IS BETTER THEY SAY WE&quot;
<br /><br />Before departure, and then more or less regularly, regiments families gather to describe the terrain and conditions of deployment, show some films and photographs taken by soldiers and remember these contacts. &quot;We understand that the door is open,&quot; said Colonel Francis Contamin, even though we know that what will really work, it will be the links between the families themselves. &quot;Thus, the cell has not received a one call on June 9, after the announcement of the death of four French soldiers in Afghanistan. Wives have just watched television and were telephoned.
<br /><br />&quot;A few days before the return we have gathered to tell us what condition our men could go, says Alison, karen millen dresses wife of a Corporal of the 2nd Marine Infantry Regiment (RIMA) Le Mans. You are told that we saw husbands to hide under the table on July 14, some woke up at night to hide their wives in the closet because they were afraid that the Taliban come to kill.

<br /><br />BEFORE THE RIGHTS OF KNOWLEDGE
<br /><br />This reform follows the will of the Prime Minister, David Cameron.

He denounces a test &quot;less practical&quot; and &quot;most historic&quot;.

And, already, one in three migrants the failed in 2009, according to BBC.

<br /><br />The document goes further. For the euro area, it draws the outlines of a common banking and budget. This is the right direction. As soon as firm commitments are in this sense, a part of the debt - only part - should be pooled.
<br /><br />Berlin must make this gesture of solidarity. But Paris is wrong to show so much reluctance to address what must necessarily be the counterpart of solidarity: karen millen a common budgetary supervision.
<br /><br />In search of a positive compromise, responsibility weighs as much about France than about Germany. Berlin and Paris must take risks to get out of a deadly status quo.

<br />The euro area does not come out of a debt <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5rYXJlbm1pbGxlbi1tYWxsdWsuY29t" target="_blank">karen millen</a>crisis largely caused by the tsunami left Wall Street in 2008. She has avoided any effects of contagion from one country to another or the transposition of evil banking crisis.
<br /><br />With each eruption market skittishness here or there -<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5rYXJlbm1pbGxlbi1tYWxsdWsuY29t" target="_blank">karen millen dresses</a>it has now visited all of Southern Europe - the 17 concocted half measures. Which then had to be subjected to lengthy periods of parliamentary ratifications, no legislature deeming useful to trigger emergency procedures ...
<br /><br />The 17 clog. They plumbing emergency,<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5rYXJlbm1pbGxlbi1tYWxsdWsuY29t" target="_blank">karen millen outlet</a>should be reviewed when all the piping. So far they have managed the crisis of the euro - as well say that the future of the European project - as if it were a negotiation on agricultural prices. A bargain which the defense of national interests in the short term of one another has always won on the ambition to come out on top of a crisis that should never have taken such a scale. The karen millen dresses story could be severe for those involved in the psychodrama of the euro.
<br /><br />But perhaps he had reached a high point in the ongoing drama that Europeans perceive the brink of collapse. They are. And, for the first time, they have on the table a comprehensive plan that looks like a partial solution. We must adopt in Brussels on Friday, and even go further.
<br /><br />Prepared as a framework for discussion by four figures of bodies Brussels (Le Monde, 27 June), karen millen outlet the plan includes two types of emergency. Some are intended to give a boost to growth. Others are intended to ease the functioning of European relief fund. They are coming to the aid of countries like Spain or Italy, are always attacked by the markets as they undertake bold reforms.
<br /><br />The document goes further. For the euro area, it draws the outlines of a common banking and budget. This is the right direction. As soon as firm commitments are in this sense, a part of the debt - only part - should be pooled.
<br /><br />Berlin must make this gesture of solidarity. But Paris is wrong to show so much reluctance to address what must necessarily be the counterpart of solidarity: karen millen a common budgetary supervision.
<br /><br />In search of a positive compromise, responsibility weighs as much about France than about Germany. Berlin and Paris must take risks to get out of a deadly status quo.
