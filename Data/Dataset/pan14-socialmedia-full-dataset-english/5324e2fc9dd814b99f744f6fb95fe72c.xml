<br />i only wanna be part of your breakdown
<br />she got caught by the four on the floor
<br />i picked her up
<br />and she'll never get let down
<br /><br />and now i can't stop
<br />thinking about it
<br />all YOU people at the top
<br />don't know nothing about it
<br /><br />we don't give a shit what the price is
<br />so just leave us to our own devices 
<br />and we'll leave you alone
<br /><br />i'll be there when your heart stops beating
<br />i'll be there when your last breath's taken away
<br />in the dark when there's no one listening 
<br />in the times when we both get carried away
<br />when we both get carried away
<br /><br />she says it all without a thought in her head
<br />she says it all as she's pressed up against me
<br />a little something just to take off the edge
<br />a little more and i'll fall off the planet entirely
<br /><br />i'll be there when your heart stops beating
<br />i'll be there when your last breath's taken away
<br />in the dark when there's no one listening 
<br />in the times when we both get carried away
<br />when we both get carried away
<br /><br />i'll be there when your heart stops beating
<br />i'll be there when your last breath's taken away
<br />in the dark when there's no one listening 
<br />in the times when we both get carried away
<br /><br />when we both get carried away
<br />when we both get carried away
<br />(i'll be there when your heart stops beating)
<br />when we both get carried away
<br />(in the dark when there's no one listening)
<br />when we both get carried away
<br /><br />very cool song, think the drummer is really cool too!!!

<br />I've tried to understand,
<br />That certain feeling,
<br />Called by another sound,
<br />But it's too late to hesitate,
<br />We can't keep on living like this.
<br /><br />Leave no track,
<br />Don't look back.
<br /><br />All I desire (temptation)
<br />Keep climbing higher and higher (temptation)
<br />Adorable creatures (temptation)
<br />With unacceptable features (temptation)
<br />And Trouble is coming (temptation)
<br />It's just a high cost of lovin(temptation)
<br />And you can take it or leave it (temptation)
<br />But you better believe it.
<br /><br />You've got to make me an offer,
<br />That cannot be ignored,
<br />So lets head for home now,
<br />Everything I have is yours,
<br />Step by step and day by day,
<br />Every second counts I can't break away.
<br /><br />Leave no trace,
<br />On your face.
<br /><br />All I desire (temptation)
<br />Keep climbing higher and higher (temptation)
<br />And you can take it or leave it (temptation)
<br />But you better believe it. (yeah)
<br /><br />Step by step and day by day,
<br />Every second counts I can't break away.
<br />(keep us from temptation, Keep us from temptation, Keep us from temptation, lead us right to temptation)
<br /><br />Trying to find it (temptation)
<br />You've got to get up behind it (temptation)
<br />But you've turned into heart slots(temptation)
<br />But it's a million to one shots (temptation)
<br />That fit you right now (temptation)
<br />You've got to fake it tonight now (temptation)
<br />But don't give me a breakdown (temptation)
<br />Because it's life or a shakedown 
<br />Temptation (x16)
<br /><br />this is such a cool song and now been made so much better by cradle of filth, whats everyone think?

<br /><br />&quot;Dance, Dance&quot;
<br /><br />She says she's no good with words but I'm worse
<br />Barely stuttered out
<br />&quot;A joke of a romantic&quot; or stuck to my tongue
<br />Weighed down with words too over-dramatic
<br />Tonight it's &quot;it can't get much worse&quot;
<br />Vs. &quot;no one should ever feel like..&quot;
<br /><br />I'm two quarters and a heart down
<br />And I don't want to forget how your voice sounds
<br />These words are all I have so I'll write them
<br />So you need them just to get by
<br /><br />[Whispered:] We're going into D-Minor
<br /><br />Dance, Dance
<br />We're falling apart to half time
<br />Dance, Dance
<br />And these are the lives you'd love to lead
<br />Dance, this is the way they'd love
<br />If they knew how misery loved me
<br /><br />You always fold just before you're found out
<br />Drink up its last call
<br />Last resort
<br />But only the first mistake and I...
<br /><br />I'm two quarters and a heart down
<br />And I don't want to forget how your voice sounds
<br />These words are all I have so I'll write them
<br />So you need them just to get by
<br /><br />Why don't you show me the little bit of spine
<br />You've been saving for his mattress, love
<br /><br />Dance, Dance
<br />We're falling apart to half time
<br />Dance, Dance
<br />And these are the lives you'd love to lead
<br />Dance, this is the way they'd love
<br />If they knew how misery loved me
<br /><br />Why don't you show me the little bit of spine
<br />You've been saving for his mattress (mattress, mattress)
<br />I only want sympathy in the form of you crawling into bed with me
<br /><br />Dance, Dance
<br />We're falling apart to half time
<br />Dance, Dance
<br />And these are the lives you'd love to lead
<br /><br />Dance this is the way they'd love (way they'd love)
<br />Dance this is the way they'd love (way they'd love)
<br />Dance this is the way they'd love
<br />If they knew how misery loved me
<br /><br />Dance, Dance
<br />Dance, Dance
<br />Dance, Dance
<br />Dance, Dance

<br />50 thousand tears I've cried
<br />Screaming, deceiving and bleeding for you
<br />And you still won't hear me
<br />(I'm Going Under)
<br />Don't want your hand this time, I'll save myself
<br />Maybe I'll wake up for once (wake up for once)
<br />Not tormented daily, defeated by you
<br />Just when I thought I reached the bottom
<br />I dive again
<br /><br />I'm going under
<br />Drowning you
<br />I'm falling forever
<br />I've got to break through
<br />I'm going under
<br /><br />Blurring and stirring the truth and the lies
<br />*Whispering* (So I don't know whats real and whats not,
<br />So I don't know what's real and what's not
<br />*whispering* (whats real and whats not)
<br />Always confusing the thoughts in my head
<br />So I can't trust myself anymore
<br />I die again
<br /><br />I'm going under
<br />Drowning in you
<br />I'm falling forever
<br />I've got to break through
<br /><br />So go on and scream
<br />Scream at me I'm so far away
<br />I won't be broken again
<br />I've got to breathe I can't keep going under
<br /><br />I dive again
<br /><br />I'm going under
<br />Drowning in you
<br />I'm falling forever
<br />I've got to break through
<br />I'm going under
<br />Going under
<br />I'm going under
<br />Drowning in you...

<br /><br />I am an arms dealer
<br />Fitting you with weapons in the form of words
<br />And don't really care which side wins
<br />As long as the room keeps singing
<br />That's just the business I'm in
<br /><br />This ain't a scene, it's a god damn arms race
<br />This ain't a scene, it's a god damn arms race
<br />This ain't a scene, it's a god damn arms race
<br />I'm not a shoulder to cry on
<br />But, I digress
<br /><br />I'm a leading man
<br />And the lies I weave are oh-so intricate, oh-so intricate [x2]
<br /><br />I wrote the gospel on giving up
<br />(You look pretty sinking)
<br />But the real bombshells have already sunk
<br />(Prima-donnas of the gutter)
<br />At night we're painting your trash gold while you sleep
<br />Crashing not like hips or cars,
<br />No, more like p-p-p-parties
<br /><br />This ain't a scene, it's a god damn arms race
<br />This ain't a scene, it's a god damn arms race
<br />This ain't a scene, it's a god damn arms race
<br />Bandwagon's full
<br />Please, catch another
<br /><br />I'm a leading man
<br />And the lies I weave are oh-so intricate, oh-so intricate [x2]
<br /><br />All the boys who the dance floor didn't love
<br />And all the girls whose lips couldn't move fast enough
<br />Sing, until your lungs give out
<br /><br />This ain't a scene, it's a god damn arms race
<br />This ain't a scene, it's a god damn arms race
<br />(Now you)
<br />This ain't a scene, it's a god damn arms race
<br />(Wear out the groove)
<br />This ain't a scene, it's a god damn arms race
<br />(Sing out loud)
<br />This ain't a scene, it's a god damn arms race
<br />(Oh, oh)

<br />READ THIS:
<br /><br />Isnt it funny that when you go to the shops with your friends you look down at the girl with black jeans and studs but smile at the girl wearing a a mini with a tshirt that barely cover anything?
<br /><br />Isnt it funny you can change your music taste to impress a guy but when it comes to a girl who likes her own music and her own style, you give her a mouthful?
<br /><br />ISNT IT FUNNY that a guy can get away with being a gangsta but the emo gets a mouthful from everyone
<br /><br />are you laughing?
<br /><br />Isnt it funny a emo can be quiet all through the week but gets more shit from everyone than the girl who sleeps around and sells her virginity?
<br /><br />ISNT IT FUNNY that you dont mind your friends drinking, smoking but the minute someone mentions emo music you can give them a lecture on melodramatic teenage outcasts?
<br /><br />im not laughing.
<br /><br />ITS SO FUNNY that you and your friends can make a girls life hell and not know anything about the silent battle she might be fighting.
<br /><br />ISNT IT FUNNY that you can call emos, punks, goths the retards but still manage to get through your day without an inch of guilt in your heart.
<br /><br />HOW YOU CAN CALL A GIRL A POSER, HOW CAN YOU SAY &quot;YOUR NOT EMO&quot; OR &quot;ATTENTION SEEKER&quot; WITHOUT SPENDING A SECOND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHY THERE ARE CUTS ON HER WRISTS AND WHY SHE SPENDS HER LUNCHTIMES CRYING INSTEAD OR LAUGHING WITH HER FRIENDS
<br /><br />KEEP ON LAUGHING
<br /><br />isnt it funny you can say and do all this without any idea of what is going on in this persons life
<br /><br />without knowing her situation with her friends
<br /><br />or her family
<br /><br />or her LIFE
<br /><br />BRAVE ISNT GOING UP ON STAGE AND STRIPPING
<br /><br />BRAVE IS NOT SAYING A SPEECH
<br /><br />OR DUMPING YOUR BOYFRIEND
<br /><br />BRAVE IS
<br /><br />GOING TO SCHOOL ON MUFTI DAY AND NOT FOR A SECOND CARE WHAT THE WHORES AROUND YOU ARE SAYING ABOUT YOUR CLOTHES
<br /><br />ITS LISTENING TO YOUR OWN MUSIC AND BEING PROUD OF IT
<br /><br />ITS GOING THROUGH EVERY DAY WITH THE THINGS PEOPLE SAY TO YOUR FACE AND BEHIND YOUR BACK AND YOU STILL KEEP QUIET
<br /><br />ITS KNOWING WHAT YOUR &quot;FRIENDS&quot; ARE SAYING ABOUT YOU AND STILL CALLING THEM YOUR FRIENDS
<br /><br />BRAVE IS KNOWING THAT TOMOROW ISNT A BRIGHT AND HAPPY FUTURE
<br /><br />ITS ANOTHER DAY OF BITCHING AND DODGING RUMORS
<br /><br />KEEP ON LAUGHING.
<br /><br />if you agree put this on ur page
<br /><br />how do you feel now! if you feel like absolute FUCKING SHIT then GOOD!
