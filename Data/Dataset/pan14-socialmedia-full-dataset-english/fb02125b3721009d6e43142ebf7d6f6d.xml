Of course Darin himself, like almost everyone who uses email regularly, must have made his own e-mail mistakes - perhaps a wrong attachment, a wrong e-mail address (autofill is a convenience, but you really have to pay attention!), unintentional use of 'reply all', or indiscreet contents that might be regretted only nanoseconds after clicking the 'send' button. But even though his mistakes may not have experienced the same degree of consequences as his red-handed friend's, they were enough to inspire Darin to do something about the problem, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5vZmZpY2lhbHRpZmZhbnljb3Nob3AuY29t" target="_blank">Tiffany Jewelry outlet</a> and that is how he came up with the idea for BigString.<br /><br />BigString Corporation now offers BigString 3.0, a web-based e-mail service that gives the user control over sent mail - even once the mail is delivered to the recipient. BigString.com webmail service will be the Tiffany Jewelry outlet only service that offers this. This type of feature is already familiar to users of certain e mail services, such as AOL mail. In AOL, however - as in any other mail system - this can only be done within the AOL network (i.e. if the recipient is also using an AOL address) and only if the email is not opened. However, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.officialtiffanycoshop.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.officialtiffanycoshop.com</a> the idea that you could reach out to a different server and snatch back your errant emails at any time, from any place, is a function that was not available until now. <br /><br />The name 'BigString' deliberately evokes an image of a long string, attached to your sent emails, that you can pull on to yank back an e mail that you should never have sent. Of course this is a transparent process - composing and sending an e mail is just like doing so in, say, Yahoo Mail or Gmail,  except that the sender can also choose different security options. Tiffany Jewelry outlet Also like its well-known competitors, BigString 3.0 includes traditional email features, such as: Sticky Notes, Automatic Message Highlighting, Calendar, Advanced Message Sorting and Advanced Spam and Virus Filtering. Under the covers, though, it's actually more like sending out the end of the string, while you keep the e-mail contents, retaining the ability to cut the string and remove access to any safe material from the outside world. <br /><br />BigString has clearly given some thought to the various ways that this technology might be used. One option is to have an e-mail 'self-destruct' (along with your choice of visual effects, such as a little bonfire) after a certain amount of time, or after having been read a certain number of times. Or, you can specify that the e mail is non-forwardable, non-printable, or non-savable. This can help ensure that the embarrassing video you sent to a friend doesn't end up posted on YouTube. You can make he e mail trackable, so you know if and when it been opened and forwarded. And most intriguing of all, you can edit mail after it has been sent, or substitute one attachment for another. This feature is especially useful for emails that have time-sensitive price quotes, company offers or dated legal material.<br /><br />Free of charge video email is another offering on BigString.com's long list of great free features. Bigstring.com offers all of its users a free of charge video e mail forum where people can send out audio/visual greetings and messages to anyone and any webmail service throughout the planet. This is a fun feature that is also hard to come by for totally free.<br /><br />Secure e-mail is a natural Tiffany Jewelry outlet feature for BigString to offer. &quot;Our customers, both consumer and businesses alike, have told us that they want even greater email security and control for their sensitive correspondence,&quot; says Darin. &quot;With our Three Layer Secure e mail, we are enabling the sender to have that additional control and security. Now users can freely communicate via email with their lawyers, accountants, stockbrokers or anyone they want to send sensitive, personal or proprietary information without the worry that it will be seen or forwarded to anyone but the intended recipient. Their confidential emails will stay confidential.&quot;<br /><br />BigString, like many webmail services, provides its users with a free of charge e-mail account and a free of charge e mail address, including a generous 4 Gb of storage . It also provides the ability to send free embedded video emails up to 10 minutes in length, a feature not available with most other free of charge email services. In addition, there are certain premium services targeted at small organization and more demanding users. For a low monthly fee, BigString offers users the ability to increase their Video E mail capabilities and storage capacity. Small businesses can set up their own email system (10 e-mail accounts and up) using the BigString e-mail service, which is POP3 compatible to allow its use with email clients such as Outlook. Tiffany Jewelry outlet Premium customers can also add video e mail marketing tools.<br /><br />Darin's inspiration to protect himself from indiscretions (like the one that tripped up his friend with the marital infidelity problem) has yielded a product that will be useful to  anyone who values privacy, security, and freedom from one more of modern life's worries.<br /><br />Related Post: <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2xvY2tpbmd0b25tamVyc2Uuc2t5cm9jay5jb20vMzA3NjI5Mjg3My1CaWdTdHJpbmctY29tLVdpbGwtYmUtdGhlLVRpZmZhbnktSmV3ZWxyeS1vdXRsZXQtQ29vbGVzdC1FLW1haWwtSW4tdGhlLmh0bWw_" target="_blank">BigString.com Could be the Tiffany Jewelry outlet Coolest E-mail Within the Planet</a>

Of course these can be stretched varied and thrown out altogether, but not until you're an expert at writing content-rich articles. One key component of a clear article is, of course, the lead paragraph. Second in importance only to the headline itself, the lead graf (paragraph for short) has to be engaging, informative and lead the reader to believe you're the one with all of the great advice they've been looking for.<br /><br />Write a good lead-in and your readers will be anxious tiffany outlet to act on whatever advice you share in the article itself and if they do find value in your advice in the article ?they'll be very hungry for me of your expertise. Hence, more sign-ups to your e-mail newsletter ?or better yet, ,more sales of your products and services.<br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5vZmZpY2lhbHRpZmZhbnljb3N0b3JlLmNvbQ__" target="_blank">Tiffany Outlet</a><br />So here are a few ideas for writing engaging lead paragraphs for your target audience:<br /><br />A problem: Try to identify with a huge challenge or issue your audience is facing. Most likely you're facing it too. So expose your experiences with this problem. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.officialtiffanycoshop.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.officialtiffanycoshop.com</a> You'll endear yourself to your audience, cementing your status as the authority in your industry. Here's an example of a problem lead:<br /><br />Mistakes. We all make them and no one wants to admit to them. We're all faced with the question, how do we recover after we make the occasional slip-up' When it comes to tiffany outlet e-mail marketing there's a huge debate over whether to 'fess up or to make like an ostrich and stick our heads in the sand. I'll offer my solution in four words: Own up to it.<br /><br />A statistic: You'll have to check your specific industry publications for these stats. Even if you see something in the mainstream news, you can always put a twist on it that relates specifically to your industry. Here's an example of this kind of lead/identifier paragraph:<br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5vZmZpY2lhbHRpZmZhbnljb3N0b3JlLmNvbQ__" target="_blank">Tiffany Outlet</a><br />What's that sound' You know - that slipping sound you keep hearing. If you're still writing your marketing pieces in-house, you're hearing the sound of market share slowly tiffany outlet slipping away from your business. Here's why: A recent survey shows 72% of your col leagues outsource so that they can focus on serving their customers and reducing costs.<br /><br />The news: You can tailor national and even international news to meet your needs with your identifier paragraph. For instance, I just used the SARS epidemic to display the benefits of teleseminars. Too much of a stretch' You be the judge:<br /><br />Picture this: The task of setting up a conference has fallen to two marketing managers in Beijing. One tests the market and discovers his company's client base is ready for teleseminars. Our other marketing manager decides to follow the same road as the many managers before her and sets up a live conference at a hotel in downtown Beijing. The story of the SARS epidemic breaks just days before their events. Which manager gets to keep his or her job'<br /><br />Note: In the example above I also used another extremely tiffany outlet effective writing technique called &quot;painting the picture.&quot; This is used throughout writing whether it's commercial or creative. Setting a scene for your readers is a wonderful tool for persuasion. You're in control, you can paint the option most beneficial to you as the best option and the one that isn't so beneficial as the worst option.<br /><br />Your readers will think you're great because you're not telling them what to do, you're just presenting them with information they can use. But in the end you've persuaded them to use your products or services - if you paint the picture correctly.<br /><br />Related Post: <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3NpZ3RsamluZ3BvZ2dpLmZyZWV3ZWIubWUvaW5kZXgucGhwP25ld3MmYW1wO25pZD00MA__" target="_blank">Knockout Content-Rich Article Techniques tiffany outlet For Writing Must-Read Lead Paragraphs</a>
