<br />The one that makes me scream&quot; she said 
<br />The one that makes me laugh&quot; she said 
<br />And threw her arms around my neck 
<br />Show me how you do it 
<br />And I promise you I promise that 
<br />I'll run away with you 
<br />I'll run away with you&quot; 
<br /><br />Spinning on that dizzy edge 
<br />I kissed her face and kissed her head 
<br />And dreamed of all the different ways I had 
<br />To make her glow 
<br />Why are you so far away?&quot; she said 
<br />Why won't you ever know that I'm in love with you 
<br />That I'm in love with you&quot; 
<br /><br />You 
<br />Soft and only 
<br />You 
<br />Lost and lonely 
<br />You 
<br />Strange as angels 
<br />Dancing in the deepest oceans 
<br />Twisting in the water 
<br />You're just like a dream 
<br /><br />Daylight licked me into shape 
<br />I must have been asleep for days 
<br />And moving lips to breathe her name 
<br />I opened up my eyes 
<br />And found myself alone alone 
<br />Alone above a raging sea 
<br />That stole the only girl I loved 
<br />And drowned her deep inside of me 
<br /><br />You 
<br />Soft and only 
<br />You 
<br />Lost and lonely 
<br />You 
<br />Just like heaven

<br />The fire burning in her eyes
<br />The chaos that controlled my mind
<br />Whispered goodbye and she got on a plane
<br />Never to return again
<br />But always in my heart
<br /><br />This love has taken it’s toll on me
<br />She said goodbye too many times before
<br />And her heart is breaking in front of me
<br />I have no choice cause I won’t say goodbye anymore
<br /><br />I tried my best to feed her appetite
<br />Keep her coming every night
<br />So hard to keep her satisfied
<br />Kept playing love like it was just a game
<br />Pretending to feel the same
<br />Then turn around and leave again
<br /><br />This love has taken it’s toll on me
<br />She said goodbye too many times before
<br />And her heart is breaking in front of me
<br />I have no choice cause I won’t say goodbye anymore
<br /><br />I’ll fix these broken things
<br />Repair your broken wings
<br />And make sure everything’s alright
<br />My pressure on her hips
<br />Sinking my fingertips
<br />Into every inch of you
<br />Cause I know that’s what you want me to do

<br />we come from the land of the ice and snow 
<br />from the midnight sun where the hot springs flow. 
<br />the hammer of the gods 
<br />will drive our ships to new lands 
<br />to fight the horde singing and crying: 
<br />valhalla i am coming! 
<br />on we sweep with threshing oar 
<br />our only goal will be the western shore. 
<br />ah ah 
<br />we come from the land of the ice and snow 
<br />from the midnight sun where the hot springs flow. 
<br />how soft your fields so green, 
<br />can whisper tales of gore, 
<br />of how we calmed the tides of war. 
<br />we are your overlords. 
<br />on we sweep with threshing oar, 
<br />our only goal will be the western shore. 
<br />so now you'd better stop and rebuild all your ruins, 
<br />for peace and trust can win the day 
<br />despite of all your losing.

<br />You know that i would be a liar
<br />If i was to say to you
<br />Girl, we couldn't get much higher
<br />Come on baby, light my fire
<br />Come on baby, light my fire
<br />Try to set the night on fire
<br /><br />Time to hesitate is through

<br /><br />Yeah! come on!
<br />Come on!
<br /><br />Woaouh! yeah!
<br /><br />It was the greatest night of my life.
<br />Although i still had not found a wife
<br />I had my friends
<br />Right there beside me.
<br />We were close together.
<br />We tripped the wall, we scaled the graveyard
<br />Ancient shapes were all around us.
<br />The wet dew felt fresh beside the fog.
<br />Two made love in an ancient spot
<br />One chased a rabbit into the dark
<br />A girl got drunk and balled the dead
<br />And i gave empty sermons to my head.
<br />Cemetary, cool and quiet
<br />Hate to leave your sacred lay
<br />Dread the milky coming of the day.
<br /><br />Ah, ah, ah, ah!
<br />Ah, ah, ah, ah!
<br />Ah, ah, ah, ah!
<br />Ah, ah, ah, ah!
<br />Ah, ah, ah, ah!
<br />Ah, ah, ah, ah!
<br />Ah, ah, ah, ah!
<br />Aah, aah, aah, aah, aah
<br />Aah, aah, aah, aaah!
<br /><br />Time to hesitate is through
<br />No time to wallow in the mire
<br />Try now we can only lose
<br />And our love become a funeral pyre
<br /><br />Come on baby, light my fire
<br />Come on baby, light my fire
<br />Try to set the night on fire
<br /><br />Know that it would be untrue
<br />You know that i would be a liar
<br />If i was to say to you
<br />Girl, we couldn't get much higher
<br /><br />Come on baby, light my fire
<br />Come on baby, light my fire
<br />Try to set the night on fire
<br />Try to set the night on fire
<br />Try to set the night on fire
<br />Try to set the night on fire!

<br />Ha, no, you're not there
<br />And though I reached out for you,
<br />Wouldn't lend a hand
<br /><br />Through the darkest hour,
<br />grace did not shine on me
<br />Feels so cold, very cold,
<br />No one cares for me
<br /><br />Did you ever think I get lonely?
<br />Did you ever think that I needed love?
<br />Did you ever think, stop thinking
<br />You're the only one that I'm thinking of?
<br /><br />You'll never know how hard I tried
<br />To find my space and satisfy you too
<br /><br />Things will be better when I'm dead and gone

<br />Still you'd turn away
<br />Now, as I die for you,
<br />My flesh still crawls as I breathe your name
<br />All these years,I thought I was wrong,
<br />Now I know it was you
<br />Raise you head, raise your face, your eyes,
<br />Tell me who you think you are?
<br /><br />I walk, I walk alone
<br />To the promised land
<br />There's a better place for me
<br />But it's far, far away
<br /><br />Everlasting life for me
<br />In a perfect world
<br />But I gotta die first,
<br />Please god send me on my way
<br /><br />Time has a way of taking time
<br />Loneliness is not only felt by fools
<br />Alone, I call to ease the pain,
<br />Yearning to be held by you
<br />Alone, so alone, I'm lost,
<br />Consumed by the pain
<br />The pain, the pain, the pain
<br />Won't you hold me again
<br />You just laughed, ha-ha, bitch
<br />My whole life is work built on the past,
<br />The time has come when all things shall pass,
<br />This good thing passed away
