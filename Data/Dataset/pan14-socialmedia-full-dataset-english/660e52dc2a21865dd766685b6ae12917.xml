<br />But knew they didn't care?
<br />Have You ever felt like crying
<br />But Knew you'd get no where?
<br /><br />Have you ever looked into their eyes 
<br />And said a little prayer?
<br />Have you ever looked into their hearts
<br />And wished that you were there?
<br /><br />Have you ever felt their heartbeat,
<br />When the lights were turned down low?
<br />Have you ever whispered &quot;God, I love You&quot;
<br />But you'll never let me show?
<br /><br />Love is grand, yet it hurts so much.
<br />The price you pay is high.
<br />If I could choose between Love and Death,
<br />I'd rather choose to die.
<br /><br />So do not fall in love, my friend,
<br />It doesn't pay a dime.
<br />It only causes broken hearts,
<br />Yet it happens all the time.
<br /><br />So do not fall in love, my friend,
<br />You'll hurt before it's through.
<br />I ought to know, my friend -
<br />I fell in love with you.

<br /><br />2. No man or woman is worth your tears, and the one who is, won't make you cry. 
<br /><br />3. Just because someone doesn't love you the way you want them to doesn't mean they don't love you with all they have. 
<br /><br />4. A true friend is someone who reaches for your hand and touches your heart. 
<br /><br />5. The worst way to miss someone is to be sitting right beside them knowing you can't have them. 
<br /><br />6. Never frown, even when you are sad, because you never know who is falling in love with your smile. 
<br /><br />7. To the world you may be one person, but to one person you may be the world. 
<br /><br />8. Don't waste your time on a man/woman, who isn't willing to waste their time on you. 
<br /><br />9. Maybe God wants us to meet a few wrong people before meeting the right one, so that when we finally meet the person, we will know how to be grateful. 
<br /><br />10. Don't cry because it is over, smile because it happened. 
<br /><br />11. There's always going to be people that hurt you so what you have to do is keep on trusting and just be more careful about who you trust next time around 
<br /><br />12. Make yourself a better person and know who you are before you try and know someone else and expect them to know you. 
<br /><br />13. Don't try so hard, the best things come when you least expect them to. 
<br /><br />REMEMBER: WHATEVER HAPPENS, HAPPENS FOR A REASON.

<br /><br />&gt; the kitchen listening to her young son playing with 
<br /><br />&gt; his new electric train in the living room. She heard 
<br /><br />&gt; the train stop and her son said, &quot;All of you sons of 
<br /><br />&gt; bitches who want off, get the hell off now, cause 
<br /><br />&gt; this 
<br /><br />&gt; is the last stop! And all of you sons of bitches who 
<br /><br />&gt; are getting on, get your asses in the train, cause 
<br /><br />&gt; were going down the tracks.&quot; 
<br /><br />&gt; 
<br /><br />&gt; The mother went nuts and told her son, &quot;We dont use 
<br /><br />&gt; that kind of language in this house. Now I want you 
<br /><br />&gt; to 
<br /><br />&gt; go to your room and you are to stay there for TWO 
<br /><br />&gt; HOURS. When you come out, you may play with your 
<br /><br />&gt; train, but I want you to use nice language.&quot; 
<br /><br />&gt; 
<br /><br />&gt; Two hours later, the son comes out of the bedroom 
<br /><br />&gt; and 
<br /><br />&gt; resumes playing with his train. Soon the train 
<br /><br />&gt; stopped 
<br /><br />&gt; and the mother heard her son say, &quot;All passengers 
<br /><br />&gt; who 
<br /><br />&gt; are disembarking from the train, please remember to 
<br /><br />&gt; take all of your belongings with you. We thank you 
<br /><br />&gt; for 
<br /><br />&gt; riding with us today and hope your trip was a 
<br /><br />&gt; pleasant 
<br /><br />&gt; one. We hope you will ride with us again soon.&quot; She 
<br /><br />&gt; hears the little boy continue, &quot;For those of you 
<br /><br />&gt; just 
<br /><br />&gt; boarding, we ask you to stow all of your hand 
<br /><br />&gt; luggage 
<br /><br />&gt; under your seat. Remember, there is no smoking on 
<br /><br />&gt; the 
<br /><br />&gt; train. We hope you will have a pleasant and relaxing 
<br /><br />&gt; journey with us today.&quot; 
<br /><br />&gt; 
<br /><br />&gt; As the mother began to smile, the child added, &quot;For 
<br /><br />&gt; those of you who are pissed off about the TWO HOUR 
<br /><br />&gt; delay, please see the bitch in the kitchen.&quot;

<br />You would see yourself there with me,
<br />Carressing your skin with my soft touch,
<br />Embracing eachother in this fantasy
<br /><br />Waking up in the morning with you,
<br />Placing a flower in your hair,
<br />Taking in your breathtaking beauty,
<br />Nothing in this world could compare
<br /><br />Building a home and a life together,
<br />That is simply based on our love,
<br />Filling each room of the house,
<br />With little blessings from up above
<br /><br />Knowing how to make eachother happy,
<br />And the kind of dreams we want to live,
<br />I could think of no other woman,
<br />To which my love I could ever give
<br /><br />Spending all of our time together,
<br />Both hating being so far apart,
<br />It seems that the beginning of forever,
<br />Is the day you meet my heart

<br /><br />My vision clears as a tear leaves my eye
<br /><br />Just laying here thinking, 1,000 thoughts in my head 
<br /><br />I want to get up but I stay here instead
<br /><br />My mind feels heavy and so does my chest
<br /><br />You've broken my heart, just like all the rest
<br /><br />I thought you were different but I was so wrong
<br /><br />You set up the games while I played along
<br /><br />Now I'm so hurt inside
<br /><br />Maybe I'll just choose to die
<br /><br />Maybe I'll slit my wrists right here
<br /><br />I blink again, a silent tear
<br /><br />In my mind I know I shouldn't cry
<br /><br />But still I do and here I lie
<br /><br />Staring up, wondering where we went wrong
<br /><br />How could you break me, I thought I was strong
<br /><br />My body feels cold now, more clouds float by
<br /><br />My breath has slowed, I don't want to try
<br /><br />I don't want to stop what I've already done
<br /><br />I've just finished your work, you've probably won
<br /><br />You've broken my spirit, my heart, my soul
<br /><br />And now I'm dying and no one knows
<br /><br />I did it myself but I hope they blame you
<br /><br />Don't tell them there was nothing you could do
<br /><br />Don't say I was unhappy, &quot;She's in a better place now.&quot;
<br /><br />Cause you did this to me and I know someday, somehow
<br /><br />Someone will do to you what you did to me
<br /><br />And they'll break your heart, you wait and see
<br /><br />Maybe you'll know why I acted that way
<br /><br />Why I was so &quot;bitchy&quot; and cried everyday
<br /><br />The reason I yelled and got all upset
<br /><br />The things I knew but inside I kept
<br /><br />After she hurts you and breaks your heart
<br /><br />The pain you feel will be a start
<br /><br />But it won't even compare to what you did to me
<br /><br />And now there's no way to make you see
<br /><br />You could have saved me, you should know not its true
<br /><br />Its all the little things you needed to do
<br /><br />You couls have told me how you felt
<br /><br />Tried a little harder to make my heart melt
<br /><br />Or surprised me with something I didn't expect
<br /><br />You should have shown me a little respect
<br /><br />Instead of yelling at me, making me number two
<br /><br />You could have saved me from what I chose to do
<br /><br />You didn't even care that you were killing me inside
<br /><br />I couldn't take it anymore and so here I lie
<br /><br />It hurts now to breathe, every breath is like work
<br /><br />I think to myself, &quot;I'll show this jerk,
<br /><br />When everyone blames him for me being dead
<br /><br />He wont get to laugh, but cry instead.&quot;
<br /><br />You probably wont but maybe you will
<br /><br />The sky is darkening, I'm lying so still
<br /><br />My arms and legs are frozen, I can't move at all
<br /><br />A tiny breeze starts blowing, an indication of fall
<br /><br />My mind wanders to my family, I should have said goodbye
<br /><br />But it wasn't their fault that today I chose to die
<br /><br />I know it will hurt them a lot to see me go
<br /><br />But I've just got things on my mind that they can never know
<br /><br />I think it's over now, I cannot hear my breath
<br /><br />My heart is not beating, no movement in my chest
<br /><br />I just hope that you tell them what you did to me
<br /><br />Let them know the kind of guy you are, the way it used to be
<br /><br />Don't leave out the part where I was a month and a half late
<br /><br />And you said it was just too much to have apon your plate
<br /><br />So instead of being happy, you said to go to hell
<br /><br />You beat me in your bedroom, I kicked and screamed and yelled
<br /><br />No one else was home, which made you think it was okay
<br /><br />Tell them all the reasons why I'm lying here today
<br /><br />There's no way that I could have done it all alone
<br /><br />No baby should be born into a broken home
<br /><br />I told you that we would figure out how to make it work
<br /><br />But you just kept on yelling and acting like a jerk
<br /><br />I said we could abort it, but that just made you mad
<br /><br />You hated my suggestions, you said that they were bad
<br /><br />So now it's all over, we don't have to worry about it anymore
<br /><br />My heart feels so free, it's no lobger sore
<br /><br />No you don't scare me, I'm just not afraid
<br /><br />Because I am safe here, right where I lay.

<br />As my eyes fill with tears.
<br />My mind goes blank.
<br />As I realize my fears.
<br /><br />Too many scars on my skin.
<br />My heart breaks into thousands of shards.
<br />This is a war I cannot win.
<br />As the devil lays out his cards.
<br /><br />So call me a psycho, call me an outcast.
<br />Tell me I'm nothing.
<br />Cause I know my life will not last.
<br /><br />So preach to me.
<br />Try to make me one of you.
<br />I know what I am.
<br />And to myself I am true.
<br /><br />Try to break me.
<br />And tell me lies.
<br />Try to change me.
<br />And make me see everything through your eyes.
<br /><br />I know what is right.
<br />I know what is wrong.
<br />I have done nothing to you.
<br />So why do you say I don't belong?
<br /><br />I try to stand so I can talk to you.
<br />But my knees are weak and your words are not true.
<br />Don't change me from what I am.
<br />I have done nothing worng, so this is my last stand.
<br /><br />The razor gleams so brilliantly bright.
<br />I know my last heart break was tonight.
<br />So I take my life out of gods hands.
<br />Into my own, while you refuse to understand.
<br /><br />I did this for me, and for you.
<br />Call me selfish, and anything but one of you.

<br />But what of suicide?
<br />Yes. That surely was my fate.

<br />They said had run the light
<br />That caused the six-car pileup
<br />On 109 that night.
<br /><br />When broken bodies lay about
<br />And blood was everywhere,
<br />The sirens screamed out eulogies,
<br />For death was in the air.
<br /><br />A mother trapped inside her car,
<br />Was heard above the noise;
<br />Her plaintive plea near split the air:
<br />&quot;Oh, God, please spare my boys!&quot;
<br /><br />She fought to loose her pinned hands;
<br />She struggled to get free,
<br />But mangled metal held her fast
<br />In grim captivity.
<br /><br />Her frightened eyes then focused
<br />On where the back seat once had been,
<br />But all she saw was broken glass and
<br />Two children's seats crushed in.
<br /><br />Her twins were nowhere to be seen;
<br />She did not hear them cry, 
<br />And then she prayed they'd been thrown free, 
<br />&quot;Oh, God, don't let them die!&quot;
<br /><br />Then firemen came and cut her loose, 
<br />But when they searched the back, 
<br />They found there were no little boys, 
<br />But the seat belts were intact.
<br /><br />They thought the woman had gone mad
<br />And was traveling alone, 
<br />But when they turned to question her, 
<br />They discovered she was gone.
<br /><br />Policemen saw her running wild
<br />And screaming above the noise
<br />In beseeching supplication, 
<br />&quot;Please help me find my boys!&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;They're four years old and wear blue shirts;
<br />Their jeans are blue to match.&quot;
<br /><br />One cop spoke up, ''They're in my car, 
<br />And they don't have a scratch.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;They said their daddy put them there
<br />And gave them each a cone, 
<br />Then told them both to wait for Mom
<br />To come and take them home.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;I've searched the area high and low, 
<br />But I can't find their dad.
<br />He must have fled the scene, 
<br />I guess, and that is very bad.&quot;
<br /><br />The mother hugged the twins and said, 
<br />While wiping at a tear, 
<br />&quot;He could not flee the scene, you see, 
<br />For he's been dead a year.&quot;
<br /><br />The cop just looked confused and asked, 
<br />&quot;Now, how can that be true? &quot;
<br /><br />The boys said, ''Mommy, Daddy came 
<br />And left a kiss for you.'' 
<br /><br />&quot;He told us not to worry
<br />And that you would be all right, 
<br />And then he put us in this car with
<br />The pretty, flashing light. &quot;
<br /><br />&quot;We wanted him to stay with us, 
<br />Because we miss him so, 
<br />But Mommy, he just hugged us tight 
<br />And said he had to go.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;He said someday we'd understand
<br />And told us not to fuss, 
<br />And he said to tell you, Mommy, 
<br />He's watching over us.&quot;
<br /><br />The mother knew without a doubt
<br />That what they spoke was true, 
<br />For she recalled their dad's last words, ' ' I will watch over you.&quot;
<br /><br />The firemen's notes could not explain
<br />The twisted, mangled car, 
<br />And how the three of them escaped
<br />Without a single scar.
<br />But on the cop's report was scribed, 
<br />In print so very fine, 
<br /><br />&quot;An angel walked the beat tonight on Highway 109.&quot;
<br /><br />The 7 Second Prayer; Just repeat this phrase and see how God moves.
<br /><br />&quot;Lord, I love you and I need you, come into my heart, and bless my family, my home, my friends, and me.&quot; Amen. '
<br /><br />Repost it!
<br /><br />You will receive a miracle tomorrow.
<br /><br />He who has a thousand friends has not a friend to spare.
<br /><br />This morning when the Lord opened a window to Heaven, He saw me,
<br />and He asked: 
<br />'My child, what is your greatest wish for today?' 
<br />I responded:
<br /><br />'Lord please, take care of the person who is reading this message, their family a and their special friends. They deserve it and I love them very much.
<br /><br />' The love of God is like the ocean, you can see its beginning,
<br />but not its end. This message works on the day you receive it.
<br /><br />Let us see if it is true.
<br /><br />ANGELS EXIST but some times, since they don't all have wings, we
<br />call them FRIENDS.
<br /><br />Repost this so all your friends can read it~
<br /><br />Something good will happen to you at 11:11 in the evening;
<br />something that you have been waiting to hear.
<br /><br />Do not break this prayer; Repost it as &quot; a poem that will give you goose bumps&quot;
