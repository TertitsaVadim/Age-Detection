If Kristen goes up alone the crowd reaction will be astonishing. Fans have bought into the romance on and off screen so she could be in for a horrible night."Earlier this week R-Patz, who reportedly moved out of the couple's home after pictures of Kristen with Rupert emerged, returned to the spotlight for a series of media appearances, including a chat on US programme The Daily Show.While he dodged host Jon Stewart's questions about his relationship, it has been reported that he was "devastated" when he discovered that Kristen had cheated on him.The actress has also kept a low profile after admitting to her fling with her Snow White And The Huntsman director, which she referred to as a "momentary indiscretion" in a statement apologising for her actions.Read more: http://www.homecomingdressescheap.com

		<document id="855f4242622cc02b5c63ebbfc3caae41" url=""><![CDATA[Robert Pattinson Bonds With Jon Stewart Over Ice Cream<br/><br/><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/184835511_15006043_50177878.jpg" />As Robert Pattinson continues to cope with the fallout from Kristen Stewart having cheated on him, he gave his first TV interview since the two's very public split to &quot;The Daily Show&quot; and received breakup ice cream from host Jon Stewart.
<br /><br />Pattinson has kept a low profile since learning last month that his girlfriend and &quot;Twilight&quot; co-star had had an affair with married movie director Rupert Sanders. The 26-year-old actor made no direct mention of Stewart in his Monday visit to &quot;The Daily Show&quot; but did talk about the messy breakup.
<br /><br />&quot;My biggest problem in my life is that I'm cheap, and I didn't hire a publicist,&quot; said Pattinson.
<br /><br />Jon Stewart offered Pattinson Ben &amp; Jerry's ice cream and jokingly said they were &quot;just two gals catching up.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;Listen, the last time I had a bad breakup, Ben and Jerry got me through. So I thought you and I could bond over this and talk about, 'Boy, you are better off. Kick her to the curb!'&quot; Stewart joked with Pattinson.
<br /><br />The conversation eventually turned to Pattinson's new film, &quot;Cosmopolis,&quot; which premiered Monday night in New York.
<br /><br />Tune into &quot;Good Morning America&quot; TOMORROW starting at 7:00 a.m., ET, to watch an exclusive live interview with Robert Pattinson.
<br /><br />&quot;If any 'Twilight' fans have tuned in, I genuinely want to make 'Cosmopolis' have a higher opening weekend than 'The Dark Knight [Rises],'&quot; said Pattinson. &quot;But the problem is, it's only opening in six cinemas. It's going to be a challenge. Just buy eight tickets.&quot;
<br /><br />Pattinson is set to appear on &quot;Good Morning America&quot; Wednesday. &quot;Cosmopolis,&quot; a thriller based on a Don DeLillo novel, opens Friday.
<br /><br />Continuing his promotion of the film today, Pattinson rung the New York Stock exchange opening bell this morning. In &quot;Cosmopolis,&quot; he plays a 28-year-old financial prodigy.
<br /><br />Monday night, Stewart ended the interview with some encouraging words for the young actor: &quot;Here's my wish for you. I know you're going through some weird business. Get a handle on your business in private. I wish you all the best. You're a nice guy.&quot;
<br /><br />Kristen Stewart publicly apologized to Pattinson last month after US Weekly published photos of her and the &quot;Snow White and the Huntsman&quot; director kissing in public.
<br /><br />&quot;I'm deeply sorry for the hurt and embarrassment I've caused to those close to me and everyone this has affected,&quot; she said in a statement to People. &quot;This momentary indiscretion has jeopardized the most important thing in my life, the person I love and respect the most, Rob. I love him, I love him. I'm so sorry.&quot;
<br /><br />Sanders, a father of two, also issued a public apology. &quot;I am utterly distraught about the pain I have caused my family,&quot; he said. &quot;My beautiful wife and heavenly children are all I have in this world. I love them with all my heart. I am praying that we can get through this together.&quot;
<br /><br />Following the affair, Pattinson packed up and moved out of the couple's Los Angeles home. Pattinson and Stewart, 22, had fueled the frenzy over the &quot;Twilight&quot; movie series with their real-life romance. &quot;The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2,&quot; the final film in the &quot;Twilight&quot; franchise, is slated for a U.S. release Nov. 16.

<br /><br />However, Khan was as terrified as she was excited about her first assignment on this medium. “I was getting to be myself on camera, which is liberating, but I was also exposing myself in the process,” she adds.

But swap the lavish dresses and tuxes for guns and the all-night parties for the dangerous world of poaching. Then pop in The Dark Knight Rises' Darth Vader-esque villain, and you've got yourself quite the movie.
<br />While that rather bizarre combination isn't likely to arrive in a cinema near you anytime soon, Leonardo DiCaprio, Tobey Maguire and Tom Hardy will be teaming up for a new movie at Warner Bros., claims The Hollywood Reporter.
<br />Hardy came up with the idea for the still-untitled film, which will center on poaching and animal trafficking, assumingly predominately from an anti-poaching perspective (the original idea was inspired by friends of the actor who went from Special Forces operatives to fighting for animals).
<br />Are Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert Pattinson planning a boys weekend?
<br />According to THR, the movie will be inspired by Steven Soderbergh's Traffic, as a &quot;multistory take on the various impacts of the war on drugs. In this case, the story would look at everything from the ground war on poachers in the African savanna to how animal material ends up in the fashion houses of Paris.&quot;
<br />Hardy, Maguire and DiCaprio (who has long been an animal-rights activist, even becoming spokesperson for the International Fund for Animal Welfare) will all produce the movie, but no decision has been announced as to whether they'll appear in the movie as well.
<br />We're thinking this brand of drama will be too much for them to turn away, though.

<br />Sporty Spice (aka Melanie Chisholm) has divulged details of a fight between the two feisty girls, which happened when they were drunk.
<br />&quot;Me and Melanie had a fight once. We were too drunk. We got a bit pushy, shovey and Geri stepped in the middle to break it up and ended up getting punched in the face. Then Melanie went off to be sick, and because she'd been drinking too much port she accused me of making her bleed!&quot;
<br />But the two put their differences behind them, reuniting with the rest of the Spice crew for a hugely successful Olympic Closing Ceremony performance.
<br />Was it so good that they'll get back together?
<br />‘No,’ Mel told the Daily Mail.

<br />It's not her: A commercial for Old Navy featured Melissa Molinaro.
<br />Kardashian sued over the spot in July 2011, claiming the company's use of a model who looked like her might confuse consumers about her actual endorsements, which include a clothing store and shoe line.
<br />No details about the settlement were filed with the court.
<br />&quot;The lawsuit was resolved to the mutual satisfaction of the parties,&quot; the two sides said in a joint statement.
<br />The lawsuit was over a commercial titled &quot;Super C-U-T-E,&quot; which featured Canadian singer-model Melissa Molinaro. The ad began airing in February 2011 and was still being used in some of the company's promotions months later, Kardashian's lawsuit stated.
<br />An attorney for Old Navy said at a January hearing that Molinaro was famous in her own right and her appearance in the ad wasn't intended to draw similarities to the reality TV starlet.
<br />Kardashian's attorney Gary Hecker contended that some news outlets and Twitter users noted similarities in the women's appearances.
<br />Kardashian, 31, was seeking unspecified damages and an order barring Old Navy from using a lookalike model again.

<br />Standing with her hand on her hip and showing off a lot of side-boob, Binky revealed a suspect pale patch which suggested she had missed a spot whilst fake tanning.
<br />Clinging onto a matching orange clutch bag, the star revealed her chest was starkly contrasting the rest of her skin tone.
<br />Her attempt to achieve side-boob definitely worked a source tells us she even took a second to glance down herself.
<br />Holding her head high, Binks pouted for snaps on the red carpet which she hit with fellow MIC stars.

<br />The 31-year-old was spotted on a shopping trip with her rapper beau in New York City's Soho yesterday afternoon, and while Kanye was paying her the utmost attention, she seemed a little preoccupied trying to fix her outfit.
<br />Attempting to be fashion-forward, Kim wore a sleeveless suit dress which showed off her ample clevage in a plunging neckline, however, it may have been a little too revealing as the button holding the dress together kept popping open.
<br />The pair were enjoying a relaxing day after attending the 'Made In America' music festival the day before, where Kanye performed alongside the event's organiser Jay-Z.
<br />Jay-Z and his wife Beyonce were said to have kept their distance from Kim as they are furious with her for supposedly making harsh comments about Jay's Roc Nation artist, Rita Ora.

<br />The designer, who has also dressed stars such as Jennifer Lopez and Demi Moore, said it was flattering to see the sisters in her creations.
<br />She was speaking at the launch of her Somerset collection at John Lewis in central London.
<br />She said: &quot;Awareness is good for any brand and they're wonderful girls to dress and wonderful girls to be around, so I think it's all flattering.
<br />&quot;It's just as flattering though to see somebody walking down the street in something as well.
<br />&quot;For me, it's really about people looking good and enjoying the clothes no matter who they are,&quot; she said.
<br />Temperley designed the decadent gown Kate wore to the premiere of the War Horse film earlier this year, with pictures of the elegant Duchess beamed around the world.
<br />The Duchess's sister was in the front row of Temperley's London Fashion Week show last September and was dressed by the designer for the evening reception of the royal wedding.
<br />On her collection for this year's London Fashion Week later this month, Temperley said it would be &quot;chic, elegant and quite minimal&quot;.
<br />The opening of Temperley's John Lewis collection attracted a number of fashion fans, with a queue of about 70 people stretching around the outside of the store on Oxford Street.

<br />A source at the Made in America Festival in Philadelphia, where both Beyonce and Kardashian were supporting their musical men, tells us, “Kim and Beyonce barely spoke to each other.” Adding, “They were on opposite sides of the stage. Beyonce didn’t even acknowledge [Kardashian] was there until the concert was almost over.”
<br />The situation was made extra awkward since Kanye West, Kardashian’s fling of nearly five months, and Jay-Z are best pals. West was even a surprise performer during Hova’s set that night.
<br />But we hear it wasn’t just Beyonce giving the cold shoulder this time around. “(Kardashian) didn’t make any efforts to go speak to Beyonce either,” the source says. Instead, she spent her time hanging out with best friend Jonathan Cheban and West, when he wasn’t performing.
<br />Eventually, the women “made small talk in the dressing room, but you could tell Kim was uncomfortable. She clung onto Kanye the entire time and didn’t say much,” according to a second source.
<br />“(Kardashian) was talking to Jonathan, and Kanye was talking to Jay-Z and Beyonce,” the insider says, adding that Kardashian did tell Jay-Z how much she loved his show.
<br />Despite the quiet cattiness, Kardashian and Beyonce could have bonded over the fact that both ladies are watching their waistlines.
<br />As Confidential recently reported, Kardashian is trying to downsize her famous derriere to fit into West’s fashion line. The insider says Beyonce had chef Anthony DiRienzo from STARR Restaurants, whose eateries Buddakkan and Morimoto had a VIP tent for celebrities at the show, prepare a dairy-free meal for her, including a chicken quesadilla with no cheese and watermelon tomato salad. Jay-Z and Beyonce were such fans of the grub, they asked for a doggy bag to take aboard their private jet Sunday.
<br />Jason Segel and girlfriend Michelle Williams and her daughter, Matilda, went wild over the holiday weekend. The trio took a trip to the Bronx Zoo, where they checked out giraffes, gorillas and the Madagascar exhibit.
<br />“They were really cute together,” says an observer. “Jason was very attentive to Matilda and was teaching her about the animals.”
<br />Segel and Williams reunited on the East Coast after spending time in L.A. together last week. According to our source, the trip to the zoo was Segel’s idea and it went over well with 6-year-old Matilda, whose father, actor Heath Ledger, died when she was 2. “She was so comfortable with [Segel],” says our source, adding, “She was thrilled to be there and see all the animals.”

<br />The reality star, 31, donned a daring, and rather revealing, monochrome dress to attend a magazine launch party in New York. 
<br />Kim had squeezed her ample chest into the plunging backless dress, which boasted cut out detail around the straps and sides, ensuring plenty of flesh was on show.
<br />The Keeping Up With The Kardashians’ star had her raven locks pulled back into a pony tail to further highlight the unusual and striking detail of her outfit. 
<br />It wasn’t just her chest on display, the white skirt of the dress also cupped her famous derriere and she finished off the look with a pair of strappy black heels. 
<br />Kim stepped out without her beau Kanye West and attended the bash with her best friend Jonathan Cheban instead. 
<br />The duo joined the hosts of the bash Jason Binn, Christy Turlington Burns and Bruce Weber at Capitale in the Big Apple.

<br />In one picture the reality star is seen nestled between Jonathan and Rachel Roy and Kim is seen pouting into the camera. 
<br />Yesterday Kim revealed that she believes her rapper boyfriend Kanye is her ‘perfect match’ and she admitted she wants children.
<br />Speaking on The View she said: 'In a perfect world you know when you find someone that you really think is your perfect match.'
<br />The 31-year-old was instantly asked, 'is he?' to which a blushing Kim replied, 'I think so.'
<br />'I definitely think anything I'd be in now is a permanent relationship,' she said. 
<br />Kim even alluded to the two starting a family. 'Kids is definitely something I want,' she said. 'I think I wanted that before.'
<br />While Kim is looking to the future Kanye has been referencing the past and he mentions the sex tape that made Kim famous in a new track. 
<br />The song - which was leaked to website TMZ and will feature on his album Cruel Summer - includes the line: 'Eat breakfast at Gucci. My girl a superstar all from a home movie.'

		<document id="6e8a7ac94fdbb6c6655687661226228c" url=""><![CDATA[Kristen Stewart barefoot and headstrong at 'On The Road'<br/><br/>When Kristen Stewart emerged from a large black car Thursday night in front of Toronto's Ryerson Theatre for the North American premiere of her new movie, &quot;On the Road,&quot; the big-screen adaptation of Jack Kerouac’s classic Beat generation novel, flashbulbs popped, cellphones were raised, and then, in a moment of silence, one sound landed with a crashing thud.
<br /><br />A single boo.<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5ob21lY29taW5nZHJlc3Nlc2NoZWFwLmNvbS9sYS1mZW1tZS1kcmVzcy0xNjM2OC1wdXJwbGUtc3RyYXBsZXNzLW1pbmktZHJlc3MtZm9yLWhvbWVjb21pbmctcC0xNDMuaHRtbA__" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/184835511_14912348_50377496.jpg" /></a>
<br /><br />It was an instant -- yet the seemingly only-- acknowledgment of the actress' recent role in the tabloids, where she's been a near constant fixture since news broke of a late-summer cheating scandal involving Stewart and filmmaker Rupert Sanders. The &quot;On the Road&quot; premiere was billed as her first public appearance since reports of her affair with the director of her film &quot;Snow White and the Huntsman&quot; emerged in July, sullying her relationship with her &quot;Twilight&quot; saga costar Robert Pattinson.
<br /><br />Stewart and her &quot;On the Road&quot; costars Garrett Hedlund and Kirsten Dunst stayed on the festival's red carpet for what seemed an eternity, moving back and forth between professional photographers on one side and fans on the other. Stewart, in a slinky sequined sheath, eventually kicked off her high heels and signed autographs in her bare feet.
<br /><br />When the program finally got started a full hour behind schedule, the festival's director and chief executive, Piers Handling, spoke of the novel “On the Road,” saying “poetry, sex and drugs was its currency.” He introduced director Walter Salles by noting that having previously made “The Motorcycle Diaries,” “he has the road in his blood.”
<br /><br />&quot;On the Road&quot; had received mixed reviews following its unveiling earlier this year at the Cannes Film Festival and has since been trimmed by some 15-20 minutes.
<br /><br />Stewart is first seen in the film lying topless on a dingy mattress, and throughout she displays, by turns, raw sexuality and more troubled reserve. The strength of her performance as Marylou -- and equally strong turns from Dunst, Amy Adams and Elisabeth Moss in small roles supporting Hedlund's Dean Moriarty and Sam Riley's Sal Paradise -- gives Salles' &quot;On the Road&quot; an oddly feminist bent.
<br /><br />After the screening, Salles recalled reading the book as a youth in Brazil -- it “embodied for me the possibility to invent a new future where all freedom was possible,” he said.
<br /><br />Stewart, who donned a pair of leather high-top basketball sneakers for the Q&amp;A session, briefly noted the nudity required for the role, but quickly pivoted to speaking about her research into the real-life counterpart for her character, LuAnne Henderson. The first wife of Neal Cassady (Kerouac's inspiration for Dean Moriarty), Henderson, Stewart said, “even now she’d be this really incredible person.”
<br /><br />Perhaps tellingly, Stewart added that Henderson's relationship with Cassady was “not something she ever sold, not something she ever capitalized on. It was her first love.”
<br /><br />She praised Salles and Hedlund for always being there for her during filming, but she said all she really ever needed to do was think of Henderson and “look up. She was so … there for me.”

Victoria is then seen going to another show at Milk Studios.
<br />For someone who is only 14 months old, little Harper Beckham is quite the fashionista. 
<br />And the little one was back at New York Fashion Week with her father David Beckham as her mother Victoria showcased her Spring/Summer 2013 collection. 
<br />While Victoria kept it simple in black, her cute daughter looked angelic in a white dress, hair bow and black shoes. 
<br />The show, which was at the New York Public Library, marked Harper’s third fashion week appearance – her first being when she only a few weeks old. 
<br />Following the show, the trio headed off to Soho restaurant Balthazar to celebrate.

<br /><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/184835511_1086904_50408319.jpg" />The designer has partnered with Google to showcase the abilities of 'Glass', the internet giant's latest venture - an augmented reality head-mounted display.
<br />The neat pair of glasses consists of a small camera which allows the wearer to film and photograph their viewpoint whilst also interacting with the digital world in a similar way to a smart phone.
<br />&quot;Beauty, style and comfort are as important to Glass as the latest technology&quot; said Google co-founder Sergey Brin. &quot;We are delighted to bring Glass to the runway together with DVF.&quot;
<br /><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/184835511_1290432_50408326.jpg" />The Belgian designer, as well as members of her design and production team and some of her catwalk models, have been sporting Glass for the past week in order to capture the creative process behind the latest collection and catwalk show for a documentary entitled 'DVF through Glass', which will be screened on the label's Goggle+ page and Google's YouTube page this coming Thursday.
<br />&quot;I am so excited to introduce Glass to the fashion world and use this revolutionary technology to give everyone a unique perspective into fashion,&quot; said Diane von Furstenberg of the project.
<br /><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/184835511_13361325_50408334.jpg" />Actress Sarah Jessica Parker tried out the specs after yesterday's show, as did Rupert Murdoch.
<br />It is the first time the glasses have been used by anyone outside of Google, although there are rumours that the headset will soon be available to the public.

<br />But &quot;Harry Potter&quot; star Emma Watson suffered her first public exposure when she attended the premiere of her new movie, &quot;The Perks of Being a Wallflower&quot;.
<br />Watson appeared regal in her backless lace dress as she glided down the red carpet at the ArcLight Cinerama Dome in Los Angeles. Her make-up was flawless - red lipstick and dark eyeliner, all complimented by her slicked back hairdo.
<br />But she was undone by one little boob - her left breast slipped out of her dress.
<br />In the coming-of-age film, based on the best-selling novel by Stephen Chbosky, Watson plays the free-spirited Sam, whom the main character falls for.

<br />The television presenter was back to her best as she took centre stage on the front row of the Philip Treacy catwalk show, on Sunday.
<br />The 32-year-old looked like a true star as she partly concealed her curves under the lace dress and became the real focus of the show at The Royal Courts Of Justice, in London.
<br />Kelly showed off plenty of skin in the dress as she kept her body covered in a cream underlining.
<br />The fashionista kept her make-up simple as she pulled back her hair into a simple ponytail and accessorised with a pair of plain black heels and a leopard print clutch.
<br />Kelly was over the moon to be attending the show and tweeted ahead of it: LFW Day 3 : Philip Treacy Tonight So excited! True Artist and first show in years !
<br />After taking her seat next to musician Bryan Ferry, she sipped on a cocktail just before the models appeared on the runway.
<br />Kelly's drink wasn't just for the party atmosphere at the show, however, as she was trying desperately to calm her nerves before a very special guest turned up.
<br />Word had spread that international superstar Lady Gaga was to attend the show and the venue was a buzz with anticipation.
<br />With the excitement surrounding Lady Gaga dying down, the actual show finally began and was well received by all.
<br />Burlesque star Dita Von Teese complimented the ostentatious display and Miss Brook shared the sentiments by retweeting: The @PhilipTreacy1 show featuring Michael Jackson's wardrobe was brilliant!
<br />Upon leaving The Royal Courts Of Justice Kelly found it hilarious when her security guard jumped into a taxi and almost left her behind.
<br />The beautiful brunette saw the funny side of things as she was left standing on the roadside moments before the security guard realised he had left her and stopped the car.

<br />But Jessica Lowndes manages just that as she dressed in a stunning silver dress as she filmed perfomance scenes at the Hollywood Bowl today.
<br />Her character on the hit teen show Adrianna Tate-Duncan is a singer, and it seems she will be playing the gig of her life in the forthcoming series of the show.
<br />Her cast mates Jessica Stroup and AnnaLynne McCord were both spotted at the iconic Los Angeles venue as the sequences were filmed today.
<br />But all eyes were on Jessica, who looked stunning in her silver and black short dress, high heels and brushed back hair.
<br />The 23-year-old seemed to be having a fantastic time as she strutted her stuff while surrounded by backing dancers in front of the cameras. 
<br />She is of course a singer in real life, and scored a number one hit in the Heatseekers chart last year with Undone.
<br />While she carried the day with her commanding stage presence, he co-stars still managed to look as good as ever.
<br />Jessica Stroup looked magnificent in a red dress, and was seen cheering enthusiastically as her friend tread the boards.

<br />The singer showed off her new curves in the bottomless corset with strapless neckline, matching the look with meat booties.
<br />It’s not the first time the singer has donned an outfit made entirely out of animal product - Gaga's infamous meat dress raised more than a few eyebrows at the VMA's last year - it also caught the disapproving eye of PETA, who commented, &quot;The stunt is bringing lots of people to PETA.org to download a copy of our vegetarian/vegan starter kit, so I guess we should be glad.&quot;
<br />Gaga defended her decision to wear the dress by saying it was merely a representation of free will. &quot;As you know, I am the most judgement-free human being on the earth,&quot; said the singer. &quot;If we don't stand up for what we believe in and don't stand up for our rights, pretty soon we're going to have as much rights as the meat on our bones.&quot;
<br />Several media outlets have also slammed Gaga’s new fuller figure, with the Daily Mail commenting, “the singer - who apparently used to starve herself to fit into her costumes - seemed to be in need of a little more cover around her derrière, with the tight-fitting outfit proving unflattering.”
<br />On the flipside, commented celebs.com, “Gaga's fuller figure could send a positive message to young girls that you don't have to look like a bag of bones to be beautiful.”
<br />It seems Gaga could care less about the controversy however, with the singer recently opening the Philip Treacy show at New York Fashion Week, where she showed off a floral-adorned, helmet-style headpiece.
<br />“Philip Treacy is the greatest milliner in the world,” said the singer.

<br /><br />Speaking about the duchess - who was previously known as Kate Middleton - a source told the Daily Star newspaper: &quot;Kanye has been urging Kim to tone down her make-up and style her hair in a more conservative style, like Kate.
<br /><br />&quot;And it's not just Kate's regal look that Kanye wants Kim to mimic. He's also told her that she could learn a thing or two about poise and sophistication from Kate.&quot;
<br /><br />Kim recently revealed Kanye has managed to convince her to live her life at a slower pace and focus less on her work and more on her personal life.
<br /><br />She said: &quot;I've slowed down a little bit and for the better. It was a good lesson learned. I now make it a priority to take time out for myself and have private vacations.
<br /><br />&quot;To be in a happy, healthy relationship means everything. It's everything when you want to share your life with someone.&quot;
