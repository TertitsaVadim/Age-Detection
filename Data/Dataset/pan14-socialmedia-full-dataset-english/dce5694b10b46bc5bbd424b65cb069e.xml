<br /><br />Here's 1 4 u...
<br /><br />If a certain sum1 worked out a way 2 make cold fussion who would he tell? If a certain sum1 worked out a way 2 compress rf on itself till it collapses and creates mass from energy who would that person trust with that information? If a certain person believed this machine could create gravity and be used 2 travel space in an instant then who would this certain person ask 4 the $mil dollar development dollars??? hahahahahahahahaha.... Brain bust that 1 ya freaks of nature!

I have come up with so many inventions over my life and I will never patent 1 of them I am sure. So to prove I am not interested in money I am going to post one of my inventions here 4 u all 2 steal. I aint worrying about a patent cuz this belongs 2 the world... Not me... Mother nature gave me the idea. I was just listening when she spoke. lol. This is 1 of my simplest inventions but it will work in a back yard or on an industrial scale...
<br /><br />Patrecable waste is something we generate tonnes of on a daily basis. Anywhere there are humans there is waste. Patrecable waste breaks down quickly and as it does releases two interesting events. The first effect we find with patrecable waste breaking down is the heat it generates. Compost heaps have been known to &quot;self combust&quot; when their internal heat reaches the point of ignition. Along with this another reaction occurs... Methane gas is created by the break down as it is with human and animal waste. These two energies can be used more  efficiently than anyone ever imagined if applied correctly. I propose this...
<br />One silo is drilled into the ground. The depth and size of this silo is reliant on the energy you need to create. Drilled along side this silo is a &quot;U&quot; shaped tunnel. This tunnel has an entry point and an exit point and runs along side the &quot;silo&quot;. In the &quot;updraft&quot; or exit side of the U shaped tunnel is placed a wind turbine generator. Depending on the difference in potential and length of the tunnel you could place many turbines.
<br />The silo you drilled must now be capped. This is the tricky part. This silo must have a pressure release valve as it will be fluctuating in temperature and gas will be building in it. At the bottom of the silo there are metal bars that run from its interior through the ground and into the foot of the second tunnel. This coils up at the bottom of the &quot;updraft&quot; tunnel and will be used for thermal dynamics. It will transfer the heat from the silo to where it is required.
<br />At the top of the silo where it is capped a pipe is tapped off that runs down the interior wall of the U shaped tunnel and at the bottom it exits 2 a valve.
<br />Here's how it works:
<br />In the silo we pack as much patrecable waste as we can. Once the silo is half full you cap it. As the reaction begins in the silo the heat will increase in it's interior. This heat will transfer through the conductor rods and into the tunnel. As the temperature of the tunnel rises at the bottom it will begin to &quot;suck&quot; air in through the &quot;down draft&quot; tunnel and the hot air will rise up the &quot;up draft&quot; tunnel. To gain an increase in the difference of potential and heat the air at the bottom harder you then ignite the valve that is carrying the methane from the silo to the base of the tunnel. Now the heat increases massively and the updraft in turn.
<br />If you can't see where the power comes from there as the up draft turns the turbines then you like totally missed it.... <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/wink.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />Open to discussion on this or any other idea u have <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" />

Well I am making 1 2day 4 $5 hahahahahaha.... So I sussed out this... Get a magnifying glass n hold it about 30cm away from a 17&quot; screen. Put u'r hand in front and move it back and forth till it focuses... Woot! How cool is that?... So If u put another magnifying glass in front of that one the picture will flip back around and by adjusting the 2 lenses u can get the right size!... Ok so I am off to get some stuff 2 make a more permanent version. Message me if ya wanna ask what the hell I am talk'n bout <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/tongue.gif" alt=":)" />

<br /><br />Update on yesterdays post. Data projector made and works. Only one magnifying glass needed and a mirror in the end. If u wanna see pics chat me @ <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.pingshack.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.pingshack.com</a> or email me from here.
<br /><br />Ok problem…
<br />I have made what, not only myself but others around me believe, are some interesting correlations between magnetic activity and weather events on our planet. I have also formulated a new model for the universe based on the fact I believe we may not be expanding as always thought by scientists.
<br />My theories are just that… Theories. I do not even claim to be a scientist. I am an “observational” scientist. I have predicted a number of large quakes now and believe I have made some ground breaking discoveries.
<br />Here’s the thing…
<br /><br />I have emailed press hungry scientists like Dr Carl (an Australian science personality), I have emailed NASA, I have emailed American Science Magazine, I have posted science forums…. Do you think ANY of these RUDE people have replied to any of my emails?... Is it not reasonable to assume that even if your theory was incorrect that these “men of science” would want to help you understand why you may be wrong? Is the aim of science not to gain and impart our knowledge?
<br />It seems that the only science these people are interested in is the science of their own voice and the science of money. I bet you if I emailed the rude pricks and said “I have $1 million to donate to your scientific project” the ass holes would be back to you within the hour…. Hmmmmm?... Might try that 1…. Lol. Is it that hard to reply to a madman and say “Sorry dude you are mad”?...
<br /><br />So in the absence of any of these people having the decency to reply (If you can’t keep up with your in coming mail don’t advertise the email address you morons!! Simple science!!) I am going to ask people who would like to discuss my theories, their theories or anyone with data on any subject to forward it to me. I am in the process of setting up a “science database”. I would like information on any subject matter and any data on these. 
<br />I will keep you all posted on how it is going and I will also publish the address when it begins to take shape.
<br /><br />I am concerned that, following my observational science and past track record, we are about to experience an earth quake like no other. All the indications so far are leading me to believe we are on the cusp of “The Big One”. What I currently REALLY NEED is data on animal behavior globally. Anyone that is interested in helping triangulate the next hit please forward on any information relating to the following:
<br /><br />-	Unusual animal activity or migration. Are animals in your area on the move or re locating?
<br />-	Marine mammal information. Whale beaching or un usual migratory paths. Dolphins moved out of the bay and headed to sea?
<br />-	Missing pets. Have the pet columns in your local papers increased in size dramatically? I am not looking for small changes. I am looking for changes of at least a 100% increase in lost animals listings.
<br />-	Any other unusual events you may have noticed in the animal kingdom. Are the crickets not chirping @ night like they usually do?... Is there  a distinct lack of animal activity?
<br />-	Do you own a cat fish? If your cat fish begins to have fits in which they tumble or twist it is an important indicator of an immanent quake. If this is happening then prepare to leave your area but email me first! Lol
<br /><br />So that is what I am interested in right now but all data and ideas are welcome. Also may be an advantage to apply for access to our clan “The Global Underground” if you would like to stay abreast of our activities.
<br /><br />Till my next blogg ya mad kids! xx

<br />While you are wishing someone a merry Christmas are you endeavoring to make it a happy Christmas for them?... While you preach the birth of, possibly, the most charitable man ever born are you celebrating his charity and birth or are you celebrating what you have and propagating a worship of possessions as you spoil your children with things that other children, and adults for that matter, can only ever dream of owning?...
<br />Do you teach your children to want and need or to give and love at this time of the year?
<br />I do not believe in a fictitious deity, invented by Middle Eastern men to keep their, out of hand, population in check 2,000 years ago.
<br />What I do believe is the human race is driven by greed, lust and envy and Christmas only enhances this disease. As we help our children compete for the best present and as the poor kids are teased in the playground for having less have you truly considered what you say?...
<br />You all should be ashamed of yourselves!
<br />I am no Christian but I challenge ANY Christian to show me they live a more righteous and charitable life.
<br />Every day we hear of Pastors preaching fidelity and humanity while they are arrested for child molestation, rape and even murder! We have massive churches that house tens of thousands of people on a daily basis and they spend millions on building bigger and better churches. They spend millions each year in making their church the coolest one to go to and the evangelists stand on stages constructed with multi million dollar lighting and sound equipment…
<br />While these fucking ass holes stand there and preach to you that you should donate your money and you should spread the word do you ever consider the hypocracy of the belief you follow? Do you ask why millions of dollars have paid to build such a grand church? Do you ever consider what the millions of dollars the church spends on self promotion and its vanity could achieve in a third world country?
<br />Does God smile upon you more for having a grand church with all the bells and whistles while the old drunk in the alley dies with no1 caring?
<br />Or would your God smile more upon you as you kneeled by this man and gave him a feed and hope for Christmas?
<br />You are all fucked in the head!
<br /><br />I am not here for what you can give me... I am not here for what I can take... I am not here to give you false hope or promises...
<br /><br />I am here to treat you as I would be treated. I am here to give to my fellow human race and to help my brother stand and walk.
<br /><br />What are you here for? What does this time of year mean to you? Do you ever ponder what this time of year means to those who have no family?...
<br /><br />When you say Merry Christmas to someone this year don't wish it upon them!...
<br />Make it happen for them!

<br /><br />Dear Friend,
<br /><br />As a general rule, I have not involved myself in Christmas for some years now. I have found the whole hypocrisy of the event tiresome and, it would appear, the message of Christmas was lost long ago. The meaningless forwarded messages and e-cards that make it easier for us to practice the hypocrisy I have come to know as “Christmas” has soured, what I believe to be, the true message we should be extending. So this year I decided to tell my friends how I feel and extend my own message to you all. I have also emailed this link to the people I consider “not so friendly” because my true message would be lost on the people I already know and love.
<br /><br />So here goes…
<br /><br />•	To those people that have loved me for who I am and who truly make an effort to understand me.
<br />•	To all those people that have been there for me, in hard times and good.
<br />•	To those of you that have supported my business venture, that have shown sincere interest and actively supported my endeavors.
<br />•	To those that have believed in me unconditionally and without faltering, at times holding my arm as I stumble.
<br />•	To the people that understand my bizarre way of thinking and who have looked beyond the madness in an attempt to understand the mind that madness hides.
<br />•	To those that have been truthful with me, who have not deceived me, who have not used my short comings as a disguise for their own faltering.
<br />•	To those that laugh at my jokes and cry at my tragedies….
<br /><br />In short… To the people who have loved me, accepted me, supported me, been there for and with me I say this:
<br /><br />You people (and I KNOW you know who you are) are the air I breathe. Your love and support has made getting up every day what motivates me to push myself and challenge my own short comings every day. Your hearts and your minds are worth more than their weight in gold and I would trade you for no other thing in the universe. There is a special place in my heart for each and every one of you.
<br />Rather than say a hollow “Merry Christmas” this year I wanted you to truly know that there is someone in the world whos life is enriched and enlightened every day I know you. For those of you who are not family you can consider yourself that to me as, at times, you have well exceeded the expectations I would place on a family member.
<br />This Christmas message is just to say that, those of you who truly care are known to me and loved deeply. This Christmas day my thoughts are with you and be happy in the knowledge that the best Christmas present I can give you this year is a life time of loyal friendship and the best friend you could ever hope to have. 
<br />Have a fantastic Christmas and I look forward to sharing more of lifes adventures with you in the new year xxx
<br /><br />If the message above didn’t sound as though it was directed at you, for what ever reason, or you are a random that happened across the page surfing then the following is my Christmas message for you:
<br /><br />This last 6 years in my life has taught me some of the hardest lessons I have ever had to learn. I have learned that people base their happiness around money, as I once did. I learned that a large percentage of people will lie and deliberately place someone else in harms way to lessen the blow to themselves, even when the person using you as a human shield may have been at fault.
<br />I have learned that blood is not thicker than water. You can always choose your friends but you can’t always choose your relatives. I hear people every day tell others how important family is and how you should love them. I ponder the love a son or daughter has for his or her rapists’ father or murdering mother in jail? … Family, Friends, acquaintances… It is not runs through our veins that make you the man or the woman you are on this day. What makes you a man or a woman of substance is not the hollow merry Christmas once a year or the card you send…
<br />What makes you stand out is your actions… Not your wishes.
<br />On Christmas Day I want you to think of what you have done to make some ones Christmas “Merry”… Not how many you have wished it upon.
<br />I am not talking about materialistic gifts and cards…
<br /><br />•	When did you last to stop and buy a bum a coffee?
<br />•	When did you last take the time to write a real email and show some interest in some ones life, rather than forward that meaningless joke?
<br />•	When did you last take the time to evaluate yourself and what you stand for? Do you even know what you stand for?
<br />•	When did you last smile at a random and say “Hi, how are you”? (and mean it)
<br />•	When you tell someone you understand them do you really?
<br />•	How often do you smile in some ones face while you run back and gossip with friends about their short comings?
<br />•	When was the last time you told the most important people you loved them and, more so, when was the last time you showed them that love?
<br />•	When you wrote “Happy Christmas and all the best for the New Year” on that card you sent out to everyone did you consider the question? Did you truly comprehend what you were writing? Did you contemplate the fact that 90% of people write the same thing on Christmas cards as a duty more than a desire?
<br /><br />The answers to these questions are that that only you can answer.
<br /><br />What I want you people to know is that, although you think you fool people with your hypocrisy there are those of us that, through being hurt time and again, have made a life out of reading you. It is something many of you will never understand but once you have seen intent in some ones eyes you recognize that look for all time again. Your eyes are truly the windows to your soul and through your eyes I see your shallow and hypocritical lies as you speak them. Even when you do not intend to lie you do as you say “Merry Christmas” to that shop keeper and then leave thinking of that beer you are going to the pub for. You are so self absorbed you do not even know that you are so transparent.
<br />This Christmas I say to you “Sunday Christians” who practice your charity once a year…
<br />Your actions speak louder than your words and your eyes tell the true story. To get the love you crave you have to give it!...
<br /><br />Although I am in no way religious I have one message for you this Christmas that was said by a man far greater in wisdom than myself, should he exist…
<br /><br />“Treat others as you would be treated”…
<br /><br />I will not send hollow Christmas wishes this year but I will send true love to those that deserve it… Do you?

Soon to be published on my web site, this is the sneak preview of what I believe mother nature has in store for us. Believe it or not. This is my theory and I'm sticking to it. Hit me back with your thoughts and if you concur then please warn everyone you can...
<br /><br />Chapter 1
<br />General Relativity:
<br /><br />The most disturbing thing about these observations is that science backs them up with some of the greatest discoveries of our generation. The theory of general relativity being the strongest ally of this, more encompassing, theory.
<br /> In order for me to understand how everything related to my way of thinking I had to return to the beginning. I returned to the studies of Galileo, Newton, Einstein and Hawking. As I read I was most attracted by Einstein’s theory of General Relativity.
<br />In order to comprehend the actions of the universe you have to understand the clockwork behind it. In doing this you must answer a question that has plagued physicists till this day. A question that we still have no definitive answer for. I had to answer this question for myself. The missing part of the puzzle that will explain everything else I was trying to prove.
<br />So being that this question has not been, definitively, proven by some of sciences greatest minds I really had little hope.
<br />Having very limited mathematics skills the ability to model the universe I perceive, with math, was not an option. My theory had to rely on equations already known and then I added the one ingredient that most great discoveries are seeded on…. “Imagination”.
<br />As I placed the scientific jigsaw together some great men before me had laid a lot of pieces out in order for me. The gaps that I saw were the same gaps these men before me saw. To equate my theory I had to fill this puzzle with my, perceived, pieces. These pieces are based on “circumstantial” evidence, provided by science. I once heard a police officer say, and I quote: “while circumstantial evidence is not going to solve a case it tells a very compelling story”.
<br />Armed with these words I will now lay out my “jigsaw” for you. I will explain, in this first chapter, why I believe the universe is collapsing and the evidence that has led me to this way of thinking.
<br />To understand the theory of general relativity I will explain it to you in laymen terms. Let’s equate the universe, and its flying debris, to general household equipment.
<br />To start with you have to understand the Space Time Continuum (STC). The STC is an invisible layer that all the planets and stars in the universe rest on. Einstein theorized that the weight of each object on the STC governed its effect on the surrounding space and the speed at which the object moved. If a smaller object happens into a larger objects “divot” then the smaller object begins a conical orbit in sympathy with the indentation created on the STC. This is where Einstein’s theory ends and I a gap appears before Stephen Hawking ads his piece years later. Here is where I became creative with the old “imagine the STC as a stretched out piece of plastic” explanation. To complete the puzzle I added my own piece and it fit with all the other pieces. To best explain it I will go through my “modified” STC experiment.
<br /><br />Imagine the STC is a piece of household plastic wrap. Take a 1 meter piece of plastic film and hold it out taught at four corners. This is your STC.
<br />Down the center of the film we place a “magnetic flux”. The flux is the invisible force that emanates from a magnet. 
<br />Magnetic flux governs all we see. From what is visible to the invisible. Electrons revolve around an invisible magnetic force as do planets and solar systems. This begs the question of where that force comes from and why we all appear to move in sympathy with that one same force.
<br />So you now have an outstretched film that has a North South pole of magnetic flux through its center. At this stage you scatter varied size ball bearings over the film. 
<br />The action transpires quickly but you will see the universal model appear before your eyes.
<br />As the bearings make a natural journey to the center field on the film you will see:
<br /><br />•	Each bearing applies a different size indentation to the film, dependant on its mass and weight.
<br />•	Although all bearings are heading toward the center pole they begin to conduct the magnetic flux through their own core and in turn become their own, revolving, magnetic force.
<br />•	The smaller bearing begin to orbit larger bearings as they all journey toward the center.
<br />•	When the weight of the bearings, collecting in the center becomes too much we see the first of my theory demonstrated…. What I now equate to the big bang!
<br /><br />The Universe is collapsing. It has happened before and it will happen again.
<br /><br />We know that when a band of magnetic field “snaps” on the sun we get a massive amount of energy released. These are, usually, seen as sun spots. The energy released from this solar flare is so powerful it disrupts our own magnetic field and has shut down entire cities. So it stood to reason with me that when a magnetic field as large as the STC breaking, there would be an amount of energy released like that which no living thing in the universe could live to speak of.
<br />I hear the scientists cry “the universe is expanding” in unison.
<br />This is where my theory fell over every time I modeled it. The universe expanding does not fit with any model…. Everything was working for me except the small problem that science was telling me the universe was expanding when everything else they told me would lead you to the conclusion that the universe was collapsing.
<br />To understand mother natures greatest optical illusion ever I had to use my “imagination”. To see the action I placed myself on one of the ball bearings making the journey across the film.
<br />I looked around and I was on a planet the same as earth and I looked out at the other bearings across the film as if they were other planets joining me in my suicide run to the center of the universal film.
<br />It all became clear when I observed what I thought… It was pure physics at its absolute best. An optical illusion of smoke and mirrors that any man, through history, could be forgiven for not seeing! As humans we have one downfall in that we believe our eyes and if they are deceived then our mind is usually close behind.
<br />As I looked out across the film I noted bearings that appeared to be moving away from me as some appeared to be moving closer…
<br />The same action we see in our own universe.
<br />It became clear. As we all move on our journey across the STC we are heading there in a conical orbit and in those conical orbits we have smaller orbits generated by the smaller weights. If you picture yourself as standing on a bearing on this journey and look back at another bearing traveling the same vortex but higher up the cone you will begin to see the action I describe. 
<br />As you head down a funnel or conical shaped orbit two things happen:
<br /><br />1.	Your orbit becomes exponentially faster and accelerates as your orbit tightens
<br />2.	Your center alignment switches sides depending on which part of the inward plain you are traveling. 
<br /><br />If you look back up the cone, at the bearing that is following your orbit it will “appear” to be moving away from you. The reason for this?
<br />You ARE accelerating away from it! It is NOT accelerating away from you!
<br />The speed of the trailing bearing is picking up as it travels down the cone as is ours. The illusion is generated by the fact that our orbits speed is increasing as we travel less area to arrive at the final destination. As this speed increases “exponentially” it exceeds the speed of the following bearing. Thus giving the trailing bearing the “illusion” of accelerating away from you.
<br />This explained the reason science had no explanation for the poles of our planets “wobbling” on their axis. Why the poles move in their own circular motion…
<br />Is this the reason science can not explain why some galaxies and stars appear to be heading toward us while others appear to be moving away?
<br />This is where the math is required to make the equation but I was satisfied that this presented a valid and workable model of the universe.
<br />In completion of this chapter I named this theory the “dbenn action” after an amazing man that once passed through my life and taught me the most amazing things about our universe. His enthusiasm for the planets and galaxies amazing life inspired me and was the catalyst for my next “self professed” discovery.
<br /><br />Chapter 2
<br />A Map of Planetary evolution:
<br /><br />After my observations, that lead me to the dbenn theory, I turned my attention to our solar system. I was looking for the correlation between the dbenn theory and the solar system as this would make the action easier for me to prove and more visible to all I tried to show.
<br />I was now looking harder at the action of precession. I had observed the action of precession in the bearings as the increasing weight forced random others to join its dance to the end.
<br />After reading the facts and understanding the current way of thinking among the scientific community I began to see the same hole as I saw with the “expanding universe” theory. Something wasn’t right…
<br />The speculation was that our planets were all different entities and formed in their own way over their own period of time. Rocks that were left over from the big bang, billions of years ago… The list of explanations went on as I took a picture of the solar system, printed it and stuck it up on my wall.
<br />I stared at this “map” of the solar system many times as I pondered the true explanation for why the planets formed the way they did.
<br />If I was right and the big bang has transpired on more than one occasion for the reasons I profess then the current understanding of the solar system is more limited than I imagined. All things being equal then I imagine the universe to be one big perpetual motion. If the big bang is a recurring event then there is a “clockwork” or pattern to this chaos! There is no random creation of planets. The clock can not turn without a path to follow that is a solid and set movement for accuracy. This “clockwork accuracy” of the universe, although appearing chaotic, is completely in order and the map of the galaxy suddenly demonstrated that to me… The map of our solar system presented a guide to creating a planet and here my next theory came to life.
<br />To best understand the theory of planetary creation it is a good idea to do as I did and print out a picture of the solar system.
<br />Looking at the map you will see our outer most object (poor Pluto was downgraded and is no longer seen as a planet but I know it will have its comeback and prove that move incorrect). The last and largest object on the map, moving inward to the center of the orbit is our star… The sun.
<br />The sun is the object that all planets in the solar system are heading toward. Our planet Earth is caught in its rip tide as are the rest of the helpless lumps of ice and rock. As we progress down our conical orbit toward the sun, as explained in chapter one on a universal scale, the sun builds our planet.
<br />Beginning with Pluto we see a massive block of ice that is too far away from the sun to be effected by its generated heat. Pluto sits on the outer edge of our solar system and represents the first, in many stages, of a planets creation.
<br />Neptune and Uranus follow Pluto closely in composition but we see some very distinct changes that show Neptune and Uranus more closely related than Pluto… For how long?
<br />As you move from Plutos orbit to Neptunes orbit something happens to poor old Pluto…
<br />Picture Pluto moving into the orbit of Neptune. It has now moved closer to the sun. The heat on the planets surface has increased. Now we see that big ball of ice begin to vapourise. The ice begins to break and fracture as we see on both Neptune and Uranus and gases begin to form. Because the planets or “ice blocks” are so dense the gases they are releasing, as they evaporate, are caught in its orbit. As the planet begins to melt inside it begins to collapse on itself under its own weight. As it does this we see small energy rings released that are the signature of an implosion.
<br />So now poor Pluto has begun to evaporate and break down into a gas. It has moved through a Neptune orbit during this process and then through the Uranus cycle it continues to soften and evaporate. This would explain the difference in size and mass of Neptune and Uranus. Now Pluto is Uranus a paradox forms. The exterior of the planet is boiling, melting and wanting to expand but the sheer mass of the planet is pulling the gas and vapor back into the center. At this point the core has not become super compressed enough to become a super conductor but it is at that point. This would easily explain the “erratic” wobbles and orbits of the three ice planets as their poles are not formed into the super conductor poles we find on the hard surface planets. The reason for this is about to become apparent.
<br />As the pressure on Uranus reaches critical point it has a MASSIVE collapse in terms of its previous shudders. This collapse happens as Uranus moves into the orbital band we now see Saturn in. Saturn displays the consequences of this collapse very well and demonstrates the difference in force of the collapse in this phase as opposed from it’s previous, smaller collapses. The rings that emanate around Saturn are the left over rubble from a phase shift, combined with the forming of a new magnetic pole.
<br />In this virgin state the exterior of the planet still appears to be a gas and mostly is. What has happened though is the first core layer of a planet has been brought to life.
<br />Deep within Saturns core is a molten layer of rock and iron. As the ice melted and vaporized through its last few phases the water expanded and could not be compressed. This, effectively, filtered the water. It forced the water to the outer part of the planet while the solids moved to the center where they became hyper compressed. This hyper compression causes the molecules to not stick together as they are to pressurized. So they turn and boil in a vortex of compression and friction that creates the beginnings of a core.
<br />As asteroids pass within the magnetic pull of the planet (dictated by the weight of its mass on the STC) they are sucked into the planet and are processed through a crushing system till they add their solids to the core and their vapor to the atmosphere. On phase shift the planet collapsed in an implosion as the temperature and constants it had grown to know were changed.
<br />In Saturn’s orbit or phase the new second layer of the planet has started its life. Saturn will drag all the shrapnel and debris in its rings toward it as it forms its new layer. The core is now so dense that it is a saturation level. It not only shifts to a super conductor as the pressure is too high to provide any resistance to the flux, but it also begins to vortex and crunch the outer level and moves into the phase of Jupiter. In the Jupiter phase we really begin to see the magnetic forces and vortexes at work. While the inner core spins inside the gas exterior, violent magnetic storms thrash the planet. The atmosphere here is beginning to lend itself to an exponential self induction. As sulfurs and chlorides are pumped into the atmosphere the planets structure becomes more conductive. As the temperature rises every degree the planets conductivity increases by 1.9%
<br />The gases become highly charged in the atmosphere and map out the magnetic activity, visually, for us.
<br />When Jupiter switches phase again it will go through a second collapse that will send debris flying in all directions and is probably the phase that is responsible for the most destruction to the internal planets of our solar system.
<br />Left behind from this collapse is a different signature to Saturn. The van Allen belt is probably debris left over from the collapse of Mars.
<br />When Jupiter reaches the Mars phase it has collapsed and in its new orbit the suns intensity has formed a solid outer crust.
<br />Here is where Mother Nature puts the car in reverse and the planet is about to embark on using the energy it has stored up all those years in implosions.
<br />The planet has a new problem in this phase. The outer crust has hardened and the inside of the planet is still expanding. The heat from the sun is causing the inside of the planet to boil from the inside out. Like a microwave oven.
<br />Now the water that has been trapped in the collapse is being heated and expanding. As the water and core heat and expand they meet resistance from the newly formed outer crust. As water can not be compressed it has to escape and we begin to see ice caps form as the water is forced out of the center of Mars and it follows the line of flux. Exiting at the 2 extreme poles, North and South. We see this now on Mars.
<br />While Mars appears stagnant at this point in time it is about to burst into life. We see evidence of massive volcanoes in the past on Mars and these scars have been left over from the last phase as the last of the molten rock forced its way out of the planet before hardening and moving into its Earth phase.
<br />As Mars slides into the Earths solar orbit the heat inside the planet begins to erupt again and forces water and molten rock up from inside the planet. Water can not be compressed and is forced out in hot springs and works its way up through the rock as it is forced to the top. In the same way, molten rock, is punched out weak points in the crust. The filtered water has pooled on the outside of the planet and formed oceans. The salt content of these massive fresh water lakes quickly becomes salt. The secret behind the water turning to salt lays in the brine lakes and erupting volcanoes way below the ocean. The water became polluted over millennia with sulfur and chlorides. Here is where the next action begins with earth and what structured an environment that could support life.
<br />As the volcanoes boil (to this day) and as the sulfur and chloride spew into the ocean and the air they propagate the global warming phenomenon. As we have seen in every other example of a planets formative stages, the vapor and gases can not escape the gravitational force of the planet. As this pollution streams into the air the ozone particles become “charged” by our magnetosphere. Linking together as they are all highly charged they began to form a barrier that contained our air and held out the harmful radiation that can damage all life on the planet.
<br />This Earth phase now falls into a new flow. An outer layer has, again, formed. As with all the other phases we have created a new layer around our planet. In the last phase of Earth stage the planet begins to breathe in an attempt to level itself out and fall into order with physics rules. As the barometric pressure rises and the forces being applied to our “bubble” reach saturation point a new phenomena occurs. The ozone layer and magnetosphere fracture!
<br />When pressure in the atmosphere reaches critical point the planet is obliged to release the excess pressure.
<br />Now before scientists argue with me and give me the old “hot air rising, cold air falling” excuse we must remember that, simply by design, that theory breaks the rules of science and can not possibly hold true in the lab. If pressure in our atmosphere built and built and was never released in a “blow off” fashion then I ask science why we are not crushed?
<br />The more atmospheric pressure applied the heavier the atmosphere becomes. With no relief valve the building pressure would, eventually, crush us.
<br />So I prefer to believe my model and will go on to explain the action that is causing our cyclones and tornadoes.
<br />As the micro tear forms in the atmosphere, to relieve the atmospheric pressure, there is a massive amount of energy released in a very short space of time. The reason for this is purely physics based and relies on difference in potential.
<br />As the hot air of the atmosphere hits the cold air of space a vortex forms in the same way one forms in the sink when you pull the plug. In order for this to happen there must be a number of other actions occur. The vortex we see is the “outline” of a magnetic storm. The air and water becomes so charged electrically that we see the storm visually as it takes the form of the flux. Being a magnetic induced vortex it requires a good low resistance earth to form. We find this in the areas of tornadoes and cyclones easily. To make water or earth more conductive we only need to either raise the temperature or add salt (sulfur and chlorides contain sodium). The areas where this phenomenon occurs are places of high salt content and temperature. No tornado or cyclone forms in the absence of both these features and this ads weight to my theory.
<br />The discussion on Earth can go on for ages as I describe the collaborations I have found in our planet and others but we are holding up the progression.
<br />So as Earth blows off its excess vapor it begins to dry out. This process will go on and on as we progress closer to the sun and, although man has greatly accelerated the process, it was bound to transpire in the fashion it has naturally. The map now becomes obvious and needs no more explaining I feel. Once we reach Earth phase we are in the “swan song” of the planet. This is the planets greatest hour in terms of its life long performance.
<br />From here our planet dries out and becomes Venus. Dried out, too hot to support life as we know it and a very hostile environment.
<br />The story finished there for me till a recent European mission to Venus discovered something interesting.
<br />25 years ago we discovered that Venus had two magnetic poles at the North. Recently a European mission discovered those poles mirrored on the lower part of the planet. This indicated to me that is was now being influenced by two magnetic fields. The suns field and something else… The greater force… The density at the center of the universe we are all headed for.
<br />I looked further and found that the Sun had recently performed a polarity shift! A shift in which its North pole went South and vice versa…
<br />This led me to the discovery that finally inspired me to put this all down in writing. ..
<br />The Earth is about to switch phase and it may be the most awesomely devastating act of mother nature we have ever witnessed.
<br /><br />This leads to chapter three.
<br /><br />Chapter 3
<br />Earth is about to phase switch:
<br /><br />After forming my opinions and theories I was mentally exhausted. I had, along the way, made many other great revelations in my own mind. The discovery I believe I stumbled across here was by far my most urgent. This discovery requires action by humanity as a race of one person. The reason I post here before, what I considered to be my lifes work is complete is because I believe I have discovered what could possibly be the end of the planet as we know it.
<br />I have never been a dooms day sayer and prefer to base my beliefs on what science has to offer me in evidence as well as what I observe myself.
<br />The true founding fathers of our sciences did not have books to refer to and had to use the talent of observation to come to the conclusions we base our ideas on in this day and age. For this reason I place little faith in the educated scientist who refers to the writings of others and place more faith in those that actively pursue their chosen scientific following.
<br />This being my belief it seems only fair I do the same. So instead of basing my knowledge on what one persons opinion is I have sought many. I have traveled to many continents and seen life standing on different ground and gazing at a different sky. My life experiences have given me the advantage over some of being able to “touch and feel” what others only read about. It has given me the ability to compare… North and South, East and West… Not only cultural offerings but the offerings of mother nature differ greatly and inspire more questions. These questions lead you on more fact finding missions as you endeavor to source answers to the never ending questions that occur.
<br />This latest concept could be the most outrageous but the most important one I have ever voiced.
<br />Once I had seen the dual flux poles on Venus I realized that there was definitely to forces at work here. Because the sheer density of the planet, Venus is unable to give up its pole so it must split the pole in order to remain within the laws of physics.
<br />So you have to ask what force is so powerful that it will fight the sun for control?
<br />Now I began to contemplate what happened when two magnets fought for control over an object that was sympathetic to conducting magnetic flux? The object would begin to take on the characteristics of magnetic flux “a” and then when finally forced out of that flux by the pull of “b” the pole would then have to change polarity to match its new orbit.
<br />This caused me to ask if it possible that planets suffer the same fate as they move through the phases of the solar system?
<br />Could it be possible that a planets magnetic pole switches from north south to south north as it tumbles into the next elliptical orbit?
<br />It turns out that all the evidence points to this being an occurrence that has happened many times throughout our planetary history. Scientists have observed geologic evidence of the Earth having reverse poles!
<br />This brings me to the point of this entire site.
<br />While I am in no way sure of this event, unable to predict the exact consequences of the event or be able to give you any good mathematic evidence of my claim I believe that, in the event I am correct, then there is no time for me to learn that required to present this paper followed by initials behind my name.
<br />If my observations have been correct and the scientific data presented on web sites, documentaries and in literature is valid then I am of the opinion that we may have already run out of time to avert disaster.
<br />Contained in the bibliography is a plethora of links that will indicate the data required but the way I have decided on a date follows this time line:
<br /><br />I correlated charts taken from ice drilling that showed the peaks and troughs in our atmospheric temperature and Co2 content over the last 450,000 years. These graphs showed very fast and dramatic corrections to the temperature and Co2 levels in the atmosphere. The chart indicates that we have stalled in a high temperature and extremely high Co2 saturation. Now although these findings do not show a stall like this in the past (more than likely the peak in Co2 is due to mans occupation and the industrial revolution) it does show something else! As fast as the temperature and Co2 levels peak they drop. Our generation is living in a small gap of Earths time and currently living in a temperature peak. This peak will have to be exhausted by the planets natural renewal cycle and I firmly believe that this cycle transpires on a pole reversal.
<br />This pole reversal is mother natures way of shedding the un needed Co2 and to level the growing temperature at its core by cooling itself. I have observed Paleomagnetism findings that show our earths pole has been reversed in the past. The way they show this is by observing the tiny iron particles that have dried in volcanic magma flows (among other ways). When the molten rock leaves the volcano is pliable and the iron filings act, much like, a compass. The iron particles point like a compass in the direction of the pole of the earth at the time it solidifies. Scientists have found evidence of these particles forming in reverse to the Earths magnetic pole. This indicates that, possibly, some time in the past the planets magnetic polarity was reversed.
<br />Not only that it may have but that it may have on many occasions.
<br />So with a peak in Co2 and Temperature that the Earth has CONSISTANTLY relieved herself of in the past like clockwork and all the paleo records pointing toward us being due for a pole reversal I looked for a possible date that this could transpire and this date may just be D Day for the human race.
<br /><br />December 21 2012
<br /><br />The significance of this date over all others?
<br />It is the final Equinox in our solar calendar. On this date the sun would have completed its orbit of the galaxy. This is the 13th and final sign of the calendar and in the Gregorian calendar the years “long count” is Long Count: 13.0.0.0.0 as well as the Julian calendar counting Long Count: 13.0.0.0.13
<br />The calendar resets and we return to the beginning. This is the time the solar system moves through its phase shift and renews itself.
<br />I honestly believe this date signifies something that ice age man was the last to see. Something that may explain the missing link?
<br />Something that may explain mass extinction?
<br />While the evidence is there to support a polar shift while man has been present on the planet I do not believe we have suffered a phase shift as is approaching.
<br />With the Earth losing 10-15% of its magnetic field over the last 150 years and the fact that it has dramatically accelerated in the last few decades shows the field is in decay. My experience with magnets tells me that a pole does not have to lose 100% of its polarity to become unstable around another flux field.
<br />All I ask is that you refer to the bibliography page contained on this site and look at the Facts as well as what may be myths and make up your own mind.
<br />While I have no religious beliefs and do not adhere to any belief I must point out a number of things that stand out to me in scientific fact that destabilized my thinking there was no such thing as a God. One interesting thing I discovered was that at the same time Jesus walked the planet (according to the bible) the Earths flux was at its highest peak, being 35% saturation. So if it wasn’t Jesus then something powerful was in our neighborhood at his time… God?... Maybe…
<br />I also noted that 2012 seems to be an important date for many Christians who appear to associate this with a possible return of Christ.
<br />Again please refer to the bibliography and form an opinion for yourself but the information is quite compelling if nothing else.

<br />So....
<br /><br />Dear Bec,
<br /><br />Yes! That’s right! I used your name. Not scared now <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />I wanted to tell you this amazing thing that happened to me so I thought I would write u a letter.
<br /><br />A long time ago the sun here disappeared. Where I am from the clouds rolled in and blocked the sun and there it stayed till now...
<br />At first it was a scary place to be. It was cold and dark and very lonely. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/sad.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />Occasionally there would be a break in the cloud and a little ray of light would push through for the briefest moment. I got to learn, in time, that this never lasted long... The darkness always won and I was back there again.
<br />So I got used to it. It wasn't that bad.
<br />Soon the darkness became my only true constant. The only thing I could guarantee when I woke in the morning that it was going to be another day in darkness.
<br />On the odd occasion the little rays still tried to push through but I got to a point where I ignored them...
<br />Much like a shooting star, they were always there but I seldom paid them any attention.
<br />Recently I was sitting in the darkness like so many days and years before. I was doing nothing out of the ordinary when something out of the ordinary happened!
<br />It started as a small ray breaking through and, as usual, I gave it but a glance. I continued on my way when, as if, out of nowhere the darkness was gone and I was blinded!
<br />At first I was scared because I had become so used to the place I lived that I forgot what the light was like <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/sad.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />I put the old beaten up sunnies I had saved in my pocket, years before, in case the day ever came that was upon me now.
<br />With my sunnies on I looked up and saw something more beautiful than I had ever seen before...
<br /><br />Just as I was focusing on what I could see the scariest thing happened!!
<br />The ground underneath just fell out from under me :O
<br />I started to fall and I have been since...
<br /><br />I wanted to tell you that and to give you this message:
<br /><br />I am falling faster than I ever have before and I am going to land hard so you better FUCKING BE THERE TO CATCH ME!!
<br /><br />xx

<br />You know when an airplane de pressurises at height and all the oxygen runs out of the fueselage? If you don't get your oxygen mask on fast you begin to suffer oxygen hypoxia.
<br />In this state you begin to not give a dam what is happening around you and no matter the tradgedy everything &quot;seems&quot; fantastic...
<br />Hmmmmm...
<br />I think this is where I am?
<br />I started falling and the oxygen thinned out... I started breathing something else... Or did I start breathing &quot;somebody&quot;?
<br />Whatever it is I am on I don't want it to stop.
<br />So whoever you are doing this to me.... Keep going!! (I'm talking about u Bec, before u ask!!) xxxx

Yeah well due to legal reasons we will not be able to release the &quot;B&quot; side of the tape as SOMEONE WHO SHALL REMAIN NAMELESS BECKY!!
<br /><br /><a href="http://en.facebox.com/Sweet_Cabbage/blog/blogid=326457" target="_blank">http://en.facebox.com/Sweet_Cabbage/blog/blogid...</a>
<br /><br />Bootlegged my album and released it before I could <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/sad.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />So seeing as the love of my life stole my album I have to think of a new way to tell her I love her... Any ideas?... There are only so many ways you can tell someone that they consume and envelop thier being... Only so many ways you can tell someone they are everything you dreamed the girl of your dreams would be...
<br />Only so many ways you can tell someone how deeply they touch you with every word they speak and only so many ways you can tell someone how many butterflies they let loose in your tummy every time they say your name...
<br />I'm lost for words... All help appreciated right now hahahahahahahaha
<br />I LOVE YOU BECKY MY ANGEL XXX <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/wub.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/love.gif" alt=":)" />

<br />So we resolved the case. I released side &quot;a&quot; and that &quot;woman&quot; released side &quot;b&quot; as seperate albums.
<br />Currently I am working on Vol 2 so stay tuned for that exciting, world shattering album to be released by &quot;BackWard Technologies&quot; on vinyl LP! Woot...
<br />Anyway that blog is coming later.. This blog is to tell everyone I am way, way, way in love with Becky and to tell you this:
<br />Becky and I came here to make friends and along the way we found each other. While I am flattered by chicks telling me how &quot;handsome&quot; I am and I am sure she is flattered by all the wankers that want to &quot;cam 2 cam&quot; we are not interested ok?...
<br />If you would like to post us for friendship then please feel free cuz we r ultra friendly peeps <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />So the real message is that I love Becky and some of you do not understand that so I decided to make sure YOU ALL UNDERSTAND!
<br />Please refer to your chosen language below:
<br /><br />English - I Love Becky
<br />Arabic - ??? ????
<br />Chinese - ???? 
<br />French - J'aime Becky
<br />German - Ich liebe Becky
<br />Italian - Amo Becky
<br />Japanese - ??Becky????
<br />Korean - ?? Becky? ????
<br />Portuguese - Eu amo Becky 
<br />Russian - ? ????? ?????
<br />Spanish - Amo a Becky
<br /><br />...... Ok if you do not get the message now you never will!!
<br />All for you my princess Cabbage xxxxxxxxxxxxx

<br /><br />We have had a couple of tears over issues we have to get past but I wanted to tell you this VERY IMPORTANT THING:
<br /><br />I love you, and because I love you, I would sooner have you hate me for telling you the truth than adore me for telling you lies.
<br /><br />I'll always tell you what I think and how I feel... Deal with it and know I love you for so many reasons that well outweigh any dissagreement we may ever have <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" />

<br /><br />* Lets a million butterflies loose in your tummy every time they say your name?
<br /><br />* Can't tell you that they love you enough?
<br /><br />* Makes you long to be close to them so much it hurts?
<br /><br />* Causes you to lose sleep if you can't hear them breathing when you lay down for bed?
<br /><br />* Says everything right and can make you feel like you are flying with promises of eternal love?
<br /><br />* Makes your heart skip a beat when you hear thier voice?
<br /><br />* Could save you from yourself?
<br /><br />* You truly trust, loves you so deeply, that no matter what, you just have to return that love and trust because your heart compells you?
<br /><br />I never had. Didn't think that person existed... The One?... I believe in my heart she might be...
<br /><br />I love you Becky with everything that I am and all that you make me!

<br /><br />I was just contemplating how your life can change so dramaticaly in such a short space of time.
<br /><br />Here I was notating the demise of our planet... I spent my days working on my web site in an effort to earn money doing what I love (being a nerd). I have books, images and models of inventions I have worked on for the last 10 years... 
<br />I have designed a new wing for aircraft to gain 40% more lift... I modeled a marine engine that uses no props or impellas and draws 10% of the energy, currently required, to move a marine vehicle with as much power as conventional motors... I have nearly completed my thesis on my, theoritcal design, for collapsing magnetic flux and, in turn, creating a new energy source... I am also close to completing my thesis on the planets polarity shift, to transpire in 2012, and the devastating effects it will have on life as we know it...
<br /><br />Invention and discovery has been my life for as long as I can remember. I have never had anything in my life that has distracted me from my goals. The only thing that drove me on a daily basis was the need to make the world a better place.
<br />All my inventions, my models, my thesis... Nothing matters anymore.
<br />While I wasn't looking I did not see planet Becky move into my orbit and nor did I predict the collision that would occur and the aftermath....
<br />I collided with something wonderfull and who would have EVER THOUGHT that, in the ruin and devastation of such an impact, something so beautiful could happen?
<br />I relate it back now to my prediction of Earths &quot;flip&quot; and I see why...
<br />In my thesis where I note the planets polarity change and its effect on life I noted:
<br />This is a way for the planet to &quot;even itself out&quot;... A renewal it does regularly.
<br />The polarity change of Earth is a chance for mother nature to renew and cleanse. It is the time that mother nature puts everything right.
<br />I predicted that, after this switch, the planet would begin its new cycle and, with all the polution and its polluters gone, the planet would take on a fresh face and, once again, be beautiful.
<br /><br />This is exaclty what has happened in my life!
<br />After colliding with Becky, and the dust had all settled, the most beautiful planet emerged... A planet of &quot;us&quot;.
<br />I am no longer one lonely rock, floating out in space... I have been re born and the only person I have to thank for that is YOU Becky!
<br />Thankyou for coming into my life and smashing into me so hard! You awoke me from a deep sleep and the combination of &quot;us&quot; is the most beautiful thing I have ever seen in my life! Nothing matters now and I do not have any desire to make the world a better place with my mad science... It doesn't need to be beautified now!... In my eyes everything is beautiful and it is due to one thing!
<br /><br />THE ONE!
<br /><br />You are my &quot;One&quot; and I love you for it <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/inlove.gif" alt=":)" /> 
<br /><br />P.S. Thanks so much for the poem Tonto! It was way cool m8 <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/biggrin.gif" alt=":)" />

If not then it is basicaly about a guy and a girl. Everything in the world seems to be going wrong for them. In amongst the hustle and bustle they both make a connection... A wierd connection... They start drawing on this poster in a train station as their, respective, days go on all crappy like. Right at the end of the music vid these two bump into each other and it is the first time they meet and the smile gives away what they suspect... &quot;perfect&quot;
<br /><br />Well meeting Becky was kinda like that... Bumped into her, had no intention of it but I smiled that smile.
<br />I had a bad day today Becky but wanted you to know that hearing your voice made me smile again <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />Love you all the way to the bottom of the jar <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/inlove.gif" alt=":)" />
