<br /><br />[&quot;This show was always meant to have a beginning, a middle and, finally, an end,&quot; executive producers Ronald Moore and David Eick said in a statement.] 
<br /><br />Were you not aware of this? I wasn't....until today. And I guess it is good that they are wrapping it up on a HIGH note. I mean, season three has been a bit of a let down, until the episode 20 where we discovered new Cylons. You have to admit that. Hardcore fan like myself losing interest!!!! What happened to the mystery and action? The deception?
<br /><br />Here's hoping the fourth series blows the first three out of the water!

I've heard the critics hated it and yet is a worldwide smash hit, number one in every country that sells CDs. Well, can't argue with the voice of the people and sales receipts.
<br /><br />The rest of the review is at my community review site, which you can find at the following  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fthereviewer.editboard.com%2FMusic-c3%2FRock-Metal-Hard-Core-f15%2F-p146.htm%23146"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://thereviewer.editboard.com/Music-c3/Rock-Metal-Hard-Core-f15/-p146.htm#146</a>

<br /><br />1.You can wake up during an earthquake and think that it's just the wind that's shaking your house.
<br />2.You can say &quot;Wellington is full of ferries&quot; and not be considered homophobic.
<br />3.You can recognise half the city's population when walking down the street.
<br />4.You can afford a $1000 suit but still flat in a house that requires 3 sets of clothing and two dehumidifiers to stay warm.
<br />5.You see someone travelling 100kph on the motorway and you complain how fast people travel these days.
<br />6.You walk from the Railway Station to Willis Street without ever checking for traffic.
<br />7.&quot;Just turn left at the first StarMart, walk down the street till you get to the third StarMart, turn right, go 3 StarMarts up and you're there.&quot;
<br />8.Seeing the Brooklyn Wind Turbine not turning is a newsworthy event.
<br />9.It takes you 20 minutes to drive around the block in peak traffic due to the 'one way system'.
<br /><br />10.Boarding a Stagecoach bus is a hazardous activity.
<br />11.You take a bodyguard down Courtenay Place in case you bump into a drunk politician.
<br />12.The centre line is negotiable, especially on the Brooklyn &amp; Hataitai hills where parked cars can take up 80% of the road.
<br />13.You get altitude sickness going from your car to your front door.
<br />14.You have to leave the city to do your shopping.
<br />15.Any wind that doesn't threaten to take your roof off is just a 'bit of a  breeze   
<br />16.You can detect 27 different shades of black suits.
<br />17.When an earthquake hits, instead of hiding under your desk, you hold a bet with your workmates on the force, focus and epicentre.
<br />18.When giving directions to tourists, you point up.
<br />19.You go out for your $5 coffee with friends and complain how expensive Auckland is.
<br /><br />You know when you're from THE HUTT when...
<br /><br />1.You can wake up thinking it's an earthquake but it's just a subwoofer.
<br /> 2.You can say &quot;Wellington is full of ferries&quot; because you are homophobic.
<br /> 3.You can recognise half your city's population in the drink-drive notices.
<br /> 4.You can't afford a $1000 suit.
<br /> 5.You see someone travelling 100kph on the motorway and drive right up their backside until you can pass them on the inside (and give them the goat sign salute).
<br /> 6.You walk from the Railway Station to Willis Street because you can't afford the bus.
<br />7.&quot;Just turn left at the first StarMart, walk down the street till you get to the third StarMart, turn right, go 3 StarMarts and you've bought your family's shopping for the week: 18 pinky bars, 6 meat pies, 47 chuppa chups.&quot;
<br />8.Seeing the Brooklyn Wind Turbine is just too freaky.
<br />9. It takes you 20 minutes to drive from Wellington to Masterton.
<br />10.Boarding a Stagecoach bus is too complicated.
<br /><br />11.You take a bodyguard to the supermarket.
<br /><br />12. The centre line is negotiable.
<br />13. You get morning sickness most Mondays.
<br />14. You have to wait til the neighbours are out to do your Christmas shopping.
<br />15. Any wind that doesn't threaten to take your roof off is just another P lab exploding.
<br />16. You can detect 27 different shades of black jeans.
<br />17. When an earthquake hits, instead of hiding under your desk, you hold a bet with the other people in the dole line on the force, focus and epicentre.
<br />18. When giving directions to tourists, you point up and then try and nick their wallet while they're looking up.
<br />19. You go out for your $5 on the pokies and complain how expensive ciggies are.
<br /><br />And the icing on the cake: You know when you're from PORIRUA when...
<br />1. You can wake up thinking it's an earthquake but realise it's just Hemi, Junior and Rua sharing your single bed.
<br />2. You can't say &quot;Wellington is full of ferries&quot; cause you've never been further than Porirua Train Station.
<br />3. You can recognise half of Porirua city's population because they're your relations.
<br />4. You can't afford a $1000 suit so you steal some shoes instead.
<br />5. You've never seen the motorway because Porirua has everything you've ever needed.
<br />6. You walk from Titahi Bay to Porirua Station, hang out for a bit, then go to NorthCity? Fah! Haven't been there since yesterday.
<br />7. &quot;Just turn left at the first KFC? No, wait, just stop in at KFC for a feed.&quot;
<br />8. Seeing the Brooklyn Wind Turbine is not an option.
<br />9. It takes you 20 minutes to drive from the mall to your house. KFC was calling your name.
<br />10. Boarding a Stagecoach bus is betrayal to your uncle who works for Mana Coach services.
<br />11. You never need a bodyguard because everyone you know could 'smash dem' anyway.
<br />12. The centre line is only worth crossing if Maccas or KFC is on the other side.
<br />13. You're only sick if you got too drunk last night.
<br />14. Christmas shopping is not necessary, it's easier to steal from The Warehouse.
<br />15. Wind is not a top priority for things getting ruined/stolen at your house.
<br />16. You can detect 27 different shades of skin colour at the mall.
<br />17. When an earthquake hits? Aw, nah, was just Hemi and them again.
<br />18. You don't get tourists.
<br />19. Anyone got 5 bucks for a pie, aw?

<br /><br />I didn't change much, only the front page and the background image that page links to. The flash story is still there on the main page, I decided not to change it yet as I have received several nice comments about it (and a couple of people who emailed me and said I was sick. YAY).

		<document id="4786a41bd38d61f4c59c766a4d15d53d" url=""><![CDATA[This works<br/><br/>Thanks to my bro for sending it:
<br /><br />&gt;&gt;  DON'T CHEAT BY SCROLLING DOWN FIRST!
<br /><br />&gt;&gt;
<br /><br />&gt;&gt;  It takes less than a minute.
<br /><br />&gt;&gt;
<br /><br />&gt;&gt;  Work this out as you read ..
<br /><br />&gt;&gt;
<br /><br />&gt;&gt;  Be sure you don't read the bottom until you've worked it out!
<br /><br />&gt;&gt;
<br /><br />&gt;&gt;  This is not one of those waste of time things, it's fun.
<br /><br />&gt;&gt;
<br /><br />&gt;&gt;
<br /><br />&gt;&gt;
<br /><br />&gt;&gt;
<br /><br />&gt;&gt;
<br /><br />&gt;&gt;
<br /><br />&gt;&gt;
<br /><br />&gt;&gt;  1. First of all, pick the number of times a day that you would like to
<br /><br />&gt;&gt;
<br /><br />&gt;&gt;  have sex
<br /><br />&gt;&gt;
<br /><br />&gt;&gt;  (more than once but less than 10)
<br /><br />&gt;&gt;
<br /><br />&gt;&gt;
<br /><br />&gt;&gt;
<br /><br />&gt;&gt;
<br /><br />&gt;&gt;  2. Multiply this number by 2 (just to be bold)
<br /><br />&gt;&gt;
<br /><br />&gt;
<br /><br />&gt;&gt;
<br /><br />&gt;&gt;
<br /><br />&gt;&gt;  3. Add 5
<br /><br />&gt;&gt;
<br /><br />&gt;&gt;
<br /><br />&gt;&gt;  4. Multiply it by 50 -- I'll wait while you get the calculator
<br /><br />&gt;&gt;
<br /><br />&gt;&gt;
<br /><br />&gt;&gt;
<br /><br />&gt;&gt;
<br /><br />&gt;&gt;  5. If you have already had your birthday this year add 1757 ....
<br /><br />&gt;&gt;
<br /><br />&gt;&gt;  If you haven't, add 1756.
<br /><br />&gt;&gt;
<br /><br />&gt;&gt;
<br /><br />&gt;&gt;
<br /><br />&gt;&gt;  6. Now subtract the four digit year that you were born.
<br /><br />&gt;&gt;
<br /><br />&gt;&gt;
<br /><br />&gt;&gt;
<br /><br />&gt;&gt;
<br /><br />&gt;&gt;
<br /><br />&gt;&gt;  You should have a three digit number
<br /><br />&gt;&gt;
<br /><br />&gt;&gt;
<br /><br />&gt;&gt;
<br /><br />&gt;&gt;  The first digit of this was your original number
<br /><br />&gt;&gt;
<br /><br />&gt;&gt;  (i.e., how many times you want to have sex each day.)
<br /><br />&gt;&gt;
<br /><br />&gt;&gt;
<br /><br />&gt;&gt;  The next two numbers are
<br /><br />&gt;&gt;
<br /><br />&gt;&gt;
<br /><br />&gt;&gt;
<br /><br />&gt;&gt;
<br /><br />&gt;&gt;
<br /><br />&gt;&gt;  YOUR AGE! (Oh YES, it is!!!!!)
<br /><br />&gt;&gt;
<br /><br />&gt;&gt;
<br /><br />&gt;&gt;
<br /><br />&gt;&gt;
<br /><br />&gt;&gt;
<br /><br />&gt;&gt;
<br /><br />&gt;&gt;
<br /><br />&gt;&gt;THIS IS THE ONLY YEAR (2007) IT WILL EVER WORK, SO SPREAD IT AROUND WHILE
<br /><br />&gt;&gt;IT LASTS.

I am thankful it hit now and not a few days from now as it would suck heading to Japan, London and Shanghai carrying the flu. Not much of a holiday.
<br /><br />I've been hitting the gym hard for the past 3 months. I've gone from 120 KG to 97 KG and my wife can finally wrap her arms around me. She's happy. I feel I still have a way to go, but I won't make it before the trip. I also have a shape starting to form from all the weights I lift and full contact martial arts is hardening my body as well.
<br /><br />Everyday I go to the gym and burn around 800-900 calories only on the fitness machines (I've had to run faster and peddle faster just to keep the calories in the same numbers) sometimes I am brimming with energy and almost hit 1000 in 90 minutes. Not much but I'm impressed with the results. It will increase. I remember being impressed with 400 and amazed when I hit 600.
<br /><br />After training I can wring sweat out of my T-Shirt!!!!!!!!! LOL
<br /><br />I think all the training has lowered my defenses against flus, colds and fuck-heads not covering their mouth when they cough, but the results are worth it. It's very unusual for me to catch a cold, and the only thing that has changed is my diet and training.  So I point to them as the culprits. Being sick sucks.
<br /><br />I wonder how many words I'll get written on The Black Tower today?

		<document id="e002143be9fa84ade293a735b2958df0" url=""><![CDATA[book back up<br/><br/>This has happened to me once, then I learnt to back up my work manually.
<br />But sometimes (if in a hurry) I usually think, it'll be okay and then do
<br />whatever I need to do.
<br /><br />Today I came across this software and purchased it instantly.
<br />It back up your work in several versions if you set it up that way.
<br />Currently I back up onto a flash drive (aka USB Pen Drive / Data Stick),
<br />email it, and have two back ups on the computer (one in Word Format and
<br />the other in Power Writer format), but I only back up when I've finished
<br />writing for the day.
<br /><br />This software automatically backs up your work at regular intervals.
<br /><br />From the website &lt;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bookbackup.com%2F%3Fafl%3D10063%26gt"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.bookbackup.com/?afl=10063&gt</a>; :
<br /><br />So, what EXACTLY is Book Backup?
<br /><br />Book Backup is a brand new software tool that automatically backs up all
<br />of your important documents at regular intervals.
<br /><br />It can backup all your important documents and folders to a zip file, it
<br />can send them to an e-mail address, it can back them up somewhere else
<br />on your hard disk, or to another computer. It can even send your files
<br />across the Internet via e-mail or FTP.
<br /><br />It's the EASIEST (and most THOROUGH) backup tool currently available
<br />– and it's SPECIFICALLY designed for writers!
<br /><br />You can schedule Book Backup to automatically perform backups every
<br />hour, every day, every week, or every month – ensuring you NEVER
<br />lose any work. It's SIMPLE. And you only have to configure it ONCE.
<br /><br />Book Back Up &lt;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bookbackup.com%2F%3Fafl%3D10063%26gt"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.bookbackup.com/?afl=10063&gt</a>;
