In fact, our prayer should be &quot;God, please make me the perfect woman/man for the person you have for me&quot;, and not to pray for a perfect partner for you...
<br /><br />When we pray, we must always seek to work on our self first and foremost, and allow God's plan to work in our life...
<br /><br />When we commit and surrender everything to God,we are allowing God's blessings to unfold in our lives, and God's gift of TRUE LOVE that one person you can spend the rest of your earthly life with, may come unexpectedly and bring forth joy beyond our wildest imagination...

<br /><br />One of the reasons why people get so sentimental….It’s because memories are the only things that don’t change…When everything else does…These are things in life you can’t hold on forever No matter how much you fight for it. Sometimes destiny isn’t always good, it becomes playful. When you met someone you learned to love, you thought that it was destiny who made your paths cross. But what if making your paths cross is just a part of the game that the playful destiny create Making you realize in the end that the person you thought that were destined to make you feel  love and leave you when you’ve already fallen. It’s not easy to state a reason when you decide to leave your love. Some might think it’s just an  excuse…some might not actually believe… some will blame you…some might even be mad at you… what they don’t see is the fact that it hurts you even more to hurt someone who doesn’t deserve to be hurt especially when you can’t actually state the reason why you have to leave. You can never own something that was never yours…. So let’s stop gripping on the things we expect to last forever Nothing lasts FOREVER, FOREVER is a lie.
<br />Everything is TRANSITORY. So while you have something in your hand, put in mind that it’s just borrowed….So that someday when it’s gone, it won’t take you eternity just to let it go…
<br />When your FEELINGS GET STRONG FOR SOMEONE, its always WISE to stop for a while and give your heart… A TIME TO BREATHE.A time to use your mind to WEIGH the situation based on REASON not on EMOTION. Because the saddest thing that can happen is when ONE FALL IN LOVE while the other WANTS NOTHING  MORE THAN FRIENDSHIP.LOVE can sometimes be MAGIC but magic can sometimes be an ILLUSION. There are times when I wish that I was limited to certain emotions so that I’ll never have to experience pain, never feel betrayed or disappointed, , and never get my FRAGILE HEART BROKEN. But the same thing means that I’ll  never know how it feels TO LOVE AND BE LOVED in return… the thought of it kind of SCARES ME. To have a HEART that’s whole but NUMB… or a heart that’s BROKEN but REAL. Someday , we’ll all be looking back to those days we learned to LOVE, GET HURT, CRY, and FIGHT. Maybe  when that time comes, we’ll be laughing at our old dumb selves.. realizing how stupid we were to stand up for things we knew we ‘rent really meant for  us. But  I guess LEARNING TAKES TIME, and MISTAKES make one’s JOURNEY FUN. Life is what we make it LOVE makes the world go around, so let’s LIVE, LOVE and TAKE whatever pain it brings… though it’s HARD TO WAIT around for something that I know will NEVER HAPPEN. It’s harder to stop when I know it’s everything I’ve always WANTED but you know what I’M GLAD it HAPPENED…WE’RE GOOD FRIENDS and I’m thankful for that… take care always my dear FRIEND… I’M JUST HERE!!!!

<br />for everyone 
<br /><br />Here are a few reasons  why guys like girls: 
<br /><br />1. 
<br />They will always smell good 
<br />even if its just shampoo 
<br /><br />2. 
<br />The way their heads always 
<br />find the right spot on our shoulder 
<br /><br />3. 
<br />How cute they look when they sleep 
<br /><br />4. 
<br />The ease in which they fit into our arms 
<br /><br />5. 
<br />The way they kiss you and 
<br />all of a sudden everything 
<br />is right in the world 
<br /><br />6. 
<br />How cute they are when they eat 
<br /><br />7. 
<br />The way they take hours 
<br />to get dressed 
<br />but in the end 
<br />it makes it all worth while 
<br /><br />8. 
<br />Because they are always 
<br />warm even when its minus 30 outside 
<br /><br />9. 
<br />The way they look good 
<br />no matter what they wear 
<br /><br />10. 
<br />The way they fish for compliments 
<br />even though you both know that you 
<br />think she's the most 
<br />beautiful thing on this earth 
<br /><br />11. 
<br />How cute they are when they argue 
<br /><br />12. 
<br />The way her hand always finds yours 
<br /><br />13. 
<br />The way they smile 
<br /><br />14. 
<br />The way you feel 
<br />when you see their name 
<br />on the call ID 
<br />after you just had a big fight 
<br /><br />15. 
<br />The way she says 
<br />&quot;lets not fight anymore&quot; 
<br />even though you know that 
<br />an hour later.... 
<br /><br />16. 
<br />The way they kiss when 
<br />you do something nice for them 
<br /><br />17. 
<br />The way they kiss you 
<br />when you say 
<br />&quot;I love you&quot; 
<br /><br />18. 
<br />Actually ... 
<br />just the way they kiss you... 
<br /><br />19. 
<br />The way they fall into your arms 
<br />when they cry 
<br /><br />20. 
<br />Then the way they apologize 
<br />for crying over something that silly 
<br /><br />21. 
<br />The way they hit you 
<br />and expect it to hurt 
<br /><br />22. 
<br />Then the way they apologize 
<br />when it does hurt. 
<br />(even though we don't admit it)! 
<br /><br />23. 
<br />The way they say 
<br />&quot;I miss you&quot; 
<br /><br />24. 
<br />The way you miss them 
<br /><br />25. 
<br />The way their tears 
<br />make you want to 
<br />change the world 
<br />so that it 
<br />doesn't hurt her anymore..... 
<br />Yet regardless 
<br />if you love them, 
<br />hate them, 
<br />wish they would die 
<br />or 
<br />know that you would die 
<br />without them ... 
<br />it matters not. 
<br />Because once in your life, 
<br />whatever they were to the world 
<br />they become everything to you. 
<br />When you look them in the eyes, 
<br />traveling to 
<br />the depths of their souls 
<br />and 
<br />yo! u say a million things 
<br />without trace of a sound, 
<br />you know that your own life 
<br />is inevitable consumed 
<br />within the rhythmic beatings 
<br />of her very heart. 
<br />We love them for a million reasons, 
<br />No paper would do it justice. 
<br />It is a thing not of the mind 
<br />but of the heart. 
<br />A feeling. 
<br />Only felt.

<br />they
<br />have sex with them!
<br />(oh yeah..you're not &quot;popular&quot; if
<br />you've slept with more than 6
<br />guys..you're a HOE)
<br /><br />?Guys may be flirting around all day
<br />but before they go to sleep, they
<br />always think about the girl they truly
<br />love
<br /><br />?Guys hate it when you talk about
<br />your ex-boyfriend or ex love-interest.
<br /><br />?Boyfriends need to be reassured
<br />often that they're still loved.
<br /><br />?Don't talk about your guy friends to
<br />your boyfriend.
<br /><br />?Guys get jealous easily.
<br /><br />?Guys are more emotional than they'd
<br />like people to think.
<br /><br />?Giving a guy a hanging message
<br />like &quot;You know
<br />what?!..uh...nevermind..&quot; would make
<br />him jump to a conclusion that is far
<br />from what you are thinking. And he'll
<br />assume he did something wrong and
<br />he'll obsess about it trying to figure
<br />it out.
<br /><br />?Guys are good flatterers when
<br />courting but they usually stammer when
<br />they talk to a girl they really like.
<br /><br />?A usual act that proves that the guy
<br />likes you is when he teases you.
<br /><br />?Guys love you more than you love
<br />them if they are serious in your
<br />relationships.
<br /><br />?Guys think WAY too much. One small
<br />thing a girl does, even if she doesn't
<br />notice it can make the guy think about
<br />it for hours, trying to figure out
<br />what it meant.
<br /><br />?Guys seek for advice from girls not
<br />other guys. Because most guys think
<br />alike, so if one guy's confused, then
<br />we're all confused.
<br /><br />?When a guy asks you to leave him
<br />alone, he's just actually
<br />saying, &quot;Please come and listen to me.&quot;
<br /><br />?If a guy starts to talk seriously,
<br />listen to him. It doesn't happen that
<br />often, so when it does, you know
<br />something's up.
<br /><br />?If your best guy friend seems to
<br />avoid you or is never around when
<br />you're with your boyfriend, he's
<br />probably jealous and likes you.
<br /><br />?When a guy tells you that you are
<br />beautiful, don't say you aren't. It
<br />makes them want to stop telling you
<br />because they don't want you to
<br />disagree with them.
<br /><br />?When a guy looks at you for longer
<br />than a second, he's definitely
<br />thinking something.
<br /><br />?Guys don't like girls who punch
<br />harder than they do.
<br /><br />?A guy has more problems than you can
<br />see with your naked eyes.
<br /><br />?Don't be a snob. Guys can be
<br />intimidated and give up easily.
<br /><br />?Guys talk about girls more than
<br />girls talk about guys.
<br /><br />?Guys hate rejection, but they hate
<br />being led on even more.
<br /><br />?If you are going to reject a guy,
<br />just do it. Don't say they are like a
<br />brother or just good friends, it just
<br />hurts even more. Tell them that you
<br />aren't interested in a relationship
<br />and they will respect you.
<br /><br />?Guys really think that girls are
<br />strange and have unpredictable
<br />decisions and are MAD confusing but
<br />somehow are drawn even more to them.
<br /><br />?When a guy sacrifices his sleep and
<br />health just to be with you, he really
<br />likes you and wants to be with you as
<br />much as possible.
