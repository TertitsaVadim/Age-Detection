(Use the Silence room in DH for this!)Q: We know that we should not think about the past and that we have toput a full stop to the past but those thoughts still continue to come– why?Ego stops us from applying a full stop. Whatever actions wehave performed in the past was through the body (in bodyconsciousness) and so when I let ego come, those events of the pastemerge and pull me. Deepen the experience and stage of soulconsciousness then you will feel the pull from Baba and not the past.Have the habit to become detached and look at the self. To stay insoul consciousness means to have a kingdom. Baba becomes present andother things won’t enter or touch me. Mama used to stay in incognitotapasya all the time. She would talk very little even when doingservice. She would inspire through her example.Q: we keep making efforts and we see the progress and changes but inthe test of 1 second there isn’t success. What specific effort isneeded to be successful in this?Don’t have this doubt that you will failKeep making elevated efforts -like Brahma Baba didKeep in mind that whatever I do, others will follow and sobe an example------There are bad omens and obstacles. Follow shrimat and there won’t beeither of them. Bad omens don’t allow the soul to move forward. Thesoul feels ‘stuck’. Always pay attention to two things to keep goodomens on your side: (1) not to disobey any of Baba’s directions and(2) to always be aware that “whatever I do, others will follow me”.People and situations become obstacles in front of us. To remove them,pay attention to 3 things: to your stage, to doing accurate service(keep the Father’s honour and gain the trust of others) and of keepinggood relationships with others. Create a powerful gathering in thisway and obstacles will not have the courage to come in front of you.

<br />‘I want to do what Baba is asking me to do’
<br />In the last 12 days how much transformation has happened within yourselves?  I can tell you of my transformation.  Transform from deep within so that your feet are not touching the ground and you are dancing with happiness in the awareness of who you are and who belongs to you…and give others this same experience.  Wherever I go everyone is good and becoming better.  Keep an elevated stage and have no burdens of service. 
<br />In the plane (from the US), there was a lot of turbulence yet the pilot did his job comfortably and easily.  We may find ourselves in all sorts of situations and we just need to keep the realisation that these will come and go and  we will arrive at our destination.  The plane is between the sky and earth and goes above the clouds.  We too go above the clouds.  The clouds do the work of showering the rain yet we stay with Baba doing our work.  Where do we live?  Above the clouds we cannot see what is going on beneath, on the ground.  Dadi had very good yoga during this scene.
<br />Every murli is great.  Let us go above and above and go to Baba beyond.  People ask Dadi how does she carry on?  Well how do the stars carry on?  Baba says we are stars of hope, stars of success, the shining stars.  We do not ask the stars what kind of stars they are…they just shine.
<br />When Dadi sees the mature sisters very happy, she feels this  is Baba’s honour.  Those with grey hair have shining faces ,more than those with black hair!.  Let each one be a shining star.  Who are you…a star of hope, a star of success or a shining star. 
<br />All of us need to learn to remain alert and ask the question: Who am I?  I have to fulfil Baba’s hopes, this is my job…because Baba has hope in the child.  No one should ask How?  Baba says ‘You are my star of hope and you can do it’.  Fulfilling Baba’s hopes is  our aim.  I can see now there is a huge amount of success.  What ever service we engage in we do not waste a thought or moment.    Success has become our wonderful companion.  Baba says that such children who become the shining stars, draw everyone’s attention up above. 
<br />In TV interviews (in US) everyone was asking what is going to happen in 2012. Dadi says don’t worry just think about what you are doing now.  We say,we understand what we are destined to do.  In the US Dadi told the BK’s to prepare such scientists that they say they will prepare such palaces for the future, whilst we are up above.  All things will be finished and burn’t away and there will be no job of cleaning because burning cleans.  The reclaimed land will merge - Bombay, Singapore and Hong Kong will all merge.
<br />Everyone knows that Dadi was in Pakistan to show them what they need to do, and to do it now.  In this Place of Tapasya where we had so much experience, other souls need to have experiences too. All over the world souls emerge to allow service to happen.  Many have done a lot of deep service from their bones thus are now unshakeable and immoveable. 
<br />Whenver we ask Dadi Gulzar for a trans message from Baba, she says that when Baba calls her she will go…We used to wonder why she couldn’t just go……Dadi now understands this.  In the US, whilst offering bhog, Dadi was totally pulled into such a powerful experience and really feels that everyone needs to experience this.  Experience is a good thing as it pulls the soul and makes the soul dance.   
<br />We must become alert.  Whatever thought we have we can do right now.  Have the thought that I want to do what Baba is asking me to do; rid the self of any ‘babyish’ stage and become mature.  Baba is in the stage of retirement and the children must be the same.
<br />It is a discipline to always go directly to Baba’s room on arrival and departure.  This is regard.
<br />OM SHANTI
<br />*******************
<br />Dadi Janki - 11th June, 2010, before Morning Class – Anubhuti
<br />The Supreme Soul is the Father of all souls, yet the people of the world don’t know Him. Through Father Brahma’s mouth, Baba says, “Child” to all souls, but each of us should feel that He is talking personally to me. When we listen to God’s voice, our faces blossom, because that voice takes us away from all the attractions of the world and pulls us up there to Him. At the Confluence Age, Baba comes into sound to take us beyond sound. There’s so much sound in this world, we’ve ended up no longer being able to properly hear or see anything. Baba takes us up above. If we stay up there and then look at the scenes down below, in that stage we can see how everything down below is in sorrow. When we stay up above, with our elevated attitude we can create a different vibration and atmosphere down below. But first we need an attitude of renunciation, then the attitude of being a trustee, and then the attitude of going beyond and staying up there.
<br />The people of America have tried to hold the world in their hands, but the world has become even more divided. Now those of you in the whole of America must do the work of creating heaven on earth. Surrender yourself to God and commit to once again creating the Golden Age, to finding Baba’s special children. Why else have you come here? Baba has mentioned many times that you all originally belonged to Baba but have taken birth in this land just in this last birth so that you can once again establish the kingdom in Bharat. You have the intoxication that you are residents of Bharat, don’t you? Bharatwassis are unique in this world because they have a natural gift of staying beyond the consciousness of the body and being loved by God. In the last few public programs Dadi has come across special souls. Give them the donation of life and sustain them so well that they become Baba’s heirs and ‘mikes’ for Baba. They should come running to meet Baba in October. You all are instruments for this.
<br />Just before Brahma Baba left the body, he gave us the mantra to become egoless, viceless, and humble. He also reminded us that the one who defames me is my friend. When I arrived for his last rites and looked at him, I thought, you created your memorial, what should I do now? I’ve always followed your directions. Internally I felt him respond, “You create your memorial too”. I was a heart patient at that time. I never imagined that I would still be alive 40 years after Baba became avyakt. Baba created his memorial by making himself a tower of knowledge, peace, purity, power and love. We also have to become towers in all these respects.
<br />Sisters and brothers of America, don’t consider your body, mind, wealth, relationships, and time as your own.  Consider that whatever you have is for Baba. Baba is making us move forward, so surrender yourself totally, just as Brahma Baba did. Don’t keep anything in your heart except the Comforter of Hearts. Once someone asked me if I am married. I replied that my husband is the Comforter of Hearts and my children are happiness and peace. If you want to have a life like mine, don’t look or listen to anyone else but Baba. In this study, the earning is instant and our guru is taking us with him. If you’re a teacher, speak; otherwise stay in silence. Create a group of two or three souls who are better than you.
<br />Om shanti.

<br />Courage &amp; Compassion: Public Programme at Sacramento, Tuesday 8th June, 2010
<br />This was a well-attended  programme at the Christ Unity Church which featured along with Dadi Janki, singer Ann Roach and the following panelists: Rev. Christine, Senior Minister of Worship, Sacramento Spiritual Life Centre; Susanne Dupree, Organizational Development Consultant and Board Member, Visions for a Better World Foundation; Dr. Rajiv Pathak, Surat, India, MBBS, MD, neurologist, leader of the Sacramento Gujarati Samaj.
<br />Dadi Janki: What is compassion? I remember the words from the scriptures ‘Compassion is the root of all religion and ego is the root of all sin.’ How much ego do you have inside? - Not the type of ego where you’re trying to prove something externally, but the subtle type where you feel ‘there should be some kind of mention of me’, or, ‘how can I tolerate this insult?’ Some say “I have a lot of compassion, but I feel a lot of sorrow; I don’t know what to do.” Those who feel compassion but also take on the sorrow of those in distress in fact have subtle ego. You have to leave ego aside and keep courage. Even though we have compassion, we also need courage.
<br />Along with courage and compassion, you have to take power from God to become truthful and honest. Even though you have courage you still need deep trust and that only comes when you are always honest and truthful. Then in your heart and mind you’ll develop the deep trust that whatever is to happen is already ordained, because truth and honesty enable this clarity.
<br />Compassion helps to stop us doing wrong things based on ego. Ego makes you have greed, attachment and anger. Compassion brings the deep realisation that you want to be free from these and instead act with courage and trust. So to live with courage and compassion you need honesty and trust.
<br />Rev. Christine: How can we work together to build more cooperation?
<br />Dadi Janki: With courage and compassion comes cooperation. It’s said that a yogi is one who gives cooperation. Being a yogi doesn’t mean you close your eyes and just sit in meditation. From the heart, through their attitude and vision, a yogi keeps spreading vibrations of pure feelings and good wishes. Pure feelings and good wishes work wonders. Never let there be ill feelings for others or even for yourself. Never feel bad about anyone or anything. Our feelings for everyone should be filled with compassion, mercy, love and honesty. God gives us help to make our hearts like this. He gives us so much cooperation; all we need is to keep the aim.
<br />You need to have a merciful heart, an honest heart, a big heart and a strong heart. Even if you have to face many tests, such as illness or money concerns – and these tests will come - by having a big, merciful heart over a long period of time, everything will be okay. You need a merciful heart, honest heart, big heart in order to always be helping others. Relationships are such that one day you say “this one is my friend, brother, sister” and the next day they’re not around. You need a strong heart to take all of that. You need such a state of mind in which everything is so clear there are no questions or doubts. Doubts prevent you from doing anything. Questions make you wait for answers. My task is to bring everyone into unity and give love to everyone. If someone doesn’t give me love, it doesn’t matter. To give is my duty, to ask is not my duty.
<br />Susanne Dupree: What advice can you share about how to remain stable in a world of turmoil?
<br />Dadi Janki: Once you’re able to take power from God internally, you are able to serve with very elevated and pure thoughts. When you stay in silence internally, you’re able to use your time in a worthwhile way. In our gatherings there’s so much love and peace. All over world, people like yourself are connected to us in subtle ways and they draw these vibrations to themselves. The nature of human beings is very sensitive. If something bad happens, it instantly spreads like an infection. The same occurs with something good;it has a good impact, as if someone is regaining consciousness. Those very far away need these vibrations.
<br />When in every moment we keep serving through our mind in this way, God always helps us internally in this. He gives a lot of help, when He knows that you are an obedient, faithful honest child who doesn’t waste time in wasteful things. You need the subtle effort of constantly keeping the awareness ‘I’m a child of the Supreme Soul, and I study the teachings He gives us.’ Study means not just with the brain; it means imbibing the teachings into the heart.
<br />Let me be a practical example for others so they think “I too can become like this.” Become an instrument with the feelings of just being an instrument. The one who makes an instrument and the one who plays it are different, but the sound that emerges is beautiful. The sound that we’re making today should reach everywhere.
<br />Dr. Rajiv Pathak: How did you achieve such a stable, calm and peaceful mind? What is the process to make a mind stable and calm like yours?
<br />Dadi Janki: The brain and mind are separate. The brain is physical, but the mind is not; the mind is part of the soul. When the soul is in body, the heart and head reveal what’s in the soul. The heart and head are connected. If the heart is happy and the head is cool, my nature is very easy. If the head is hot, words of frustration emerge.
<br />When the mind is peaceless, it keeps stumbling around, wandering here and there and far away from any sense of peace. Even if you tell it to sit quietly, it won’t. To learn meditation properly you have to make the mind very quiet. The sense organs are very mischievous in preventing this through their seeing what’s happening, listening to it or talking about it. Once the mind becomes quiet, the intellect begins to work in the right way. Otherwise, although the intellect knows what is right or wrong, true or false, and so on, because the mind is under the influence of the sense organs so much, the intellect doesn’t have the strength to do what is right or to refrain from doing what’s wrong.
<br />The intellect should understand in such a way that it’s able to make the mind peaceful and connect the mind with God so that you can get power. The strength of this link between the intellect and God is what makes the mind peaceful.
<br />Even more subtle than that is your attitude. It’s very deep and it holds things from long ago. This is why you say “my attitude is not good”. So internally, one’s attitude of mind also has to be very clean. When the intellect realises, it is able to cleanse the attitude so that you’re not remembering the old useless things but are remembering the good things. This is called the stage of manmanabhav, in which the head and heart work properly. So the mind, intellect, attitude, remembrance, awareness - all of these things are inter-connected. When you understand them properly, you’re able to bring to an end all the ill feelings inside and imbibe good things in your life.
<br />Humans want to bring many good things into their lives but they don’t finish off the bad internally. It’s very subtle. Three things that happen are that people get confused, nervous, and fearful. They wonder how something will happen and when it will happen. However, if you’ve developed faith and trust internally you’ll feel nothing can happen. So make your attitude elevated and then you’ll be able to create a very powerful atmosphere through that attitude. Then no negative and waste thoughts will emerge.
<br />People’s faces are not always cheerful because we keep suppressing things in our minds, and 99% of us suppress something. You hold back from saying something but by suppressing and keeping anything in your heart that someone has said, you make your own heart heavy. God never says, “This one is like this, or like that.” With great love He makes us belong to Him. So there’s a very deep connection between the heart and mind. When you suppress anything it’s in the heart.
<br />Audience member: What spiritual practice is best used to build faith or trust?
<br />Dadi Janki: First understand deeply what Dadi has been sharing about the heart, mind, and intellect and bring it practically into your life. Have the pure feeling to bring these things into your life and that will help. Then you’ll not just say “I heard about this” but you will understand and you’ll share with others at that powerful level.
<br />Another audience member: Could you speak on the topic of forgiveness and letting go?
<br />Dadi Janki: When we start walking on the spiritual path, just as you have to have compassion, you also need to have feelings of forgiveness. First there’s compassion, then a merciful heart and then you can do something. But you also need feelings of forgiveness. Letting go means that you have not only forgiven but have also forgotten. If you’ve not done this, you’ll not be able to let go. You’ll hold on to whatever has happened, and then you’ll experience neither compassion nor mercy.
<br />Along with compassion and mercy, if someone has forgiveness, they’ll never have hatred for anyone. If you have feelings of hatred or look at anyone with that vision, it means you have ego. Some say “I’ve forgiven that one, but still he doesn’t improve” but it is ego to think in this way. If you have compassion, mercy and forgiveness, your vision towards others will always be of bringing benefit. You’ll never hurt others but also you’ll not let others hurt you. Let there be genuine feelings of friendship. This is what it means to let go, and to truly forgive.
<br />Courage and Compassion: Public Program at Anubhuti, Wednesday, 9th June, 2010
<br />There was standing room only for this variety program featuring award-winning composer/producer Gary Malkin; former world champion athlete, university professor and author Dan Millman (The Way of the Peaceful Warrior); award winning producer, director, musician and composer, Emmanuel Vaughn-Lee, Founder and Director of the Global Oneness Project; and Dadi Janki.
<br />Essence of remarks by Dan Millman: We strive to live with a peaceful heart, but it takes courage to live in this world. We all have to overcome hardships in life and we develop compassion having gone through them. However we don’t have to look for adversity in order to grow. There are many other means to achieve personal growth such as spirituality, self insight, and self enquiry that help us to focus on our inner world. The assumption is that by thinking kind, compassionate or good thoughts, we can acquire peace, love and happiness inside, and then we can live well. But feelings can change all the time, like the passing weather. Heroes and cowards feel the same fear, they just respond differently. So my focus is on what we do. Behave with courage. Be kind, loving, peaceful, compassionate, irrespective of how we may feel. After all, we have more control over what we do than what we say, or over what we think and feel. Let us focus on what we do moment to moment: ‘how can I bring a little more kindness and compassion to this moment?’
<br />Essence of remarks by Emmanual Vaughn-Lee: How do those living in challenging circumstances deal with those challenges? How does that differ from how we might deal with them? Whilst challenges can differ depending on where we live, we can still learn from each other. In our interconnected world, alternative media plays a vital role in presenting people with ideas and images that help them think about alternative ways of living in this world. Although I don’t tell people what to do, through film I encourage people to change the ways they relate to the world, to be true to themselves, and to integrate that truth in their lives.
<br />Address by Dadi Janki
<br />People ask how at my age I remain so light. They don’t understand it is the might from the Almighty that makes me light.
<br />In 1978 I went to the Caribbean. They had put up a banner which read, ‘The Star of Hope comes to town.’ I did not know what ‘star of hope’ meant and I had to stand up in front of a big gathering as a star of hope. What should I say to them? So I thought to myself the soul is a star in centre of forehead. I’m the one who makes this body move. The eyes, nose, hands have their own places; and the soul also has its own place here in the forehead. So I am a star, a shining star.
<br />Where does a star get its sparkle from? During the day when the sun is bright, stars are hidden, but at night when the moon comes out they start to sparkle. But where do they get their light from? The sun is like a father; the moon is like a mother. The sun spreads its rays over the whole world. It is 24 hours on service. The moon and the stars also serve for just as long. The Earth rotates and the sun spreads its rays The sun removes the darkness. But the moon and stars that you see shining up there also draw their light and power from the sun. The stars are numberwise where those that shine the brightest are said to be the ones that remove bad omens.
<br />Then there are film stars. In the world everyone is an actor, but what kind of actor are you? Who is the creator, who is the director, and what’s the main signal that the director is giving? First we have to be stars of hope. God, the Supreme Soul, has given the understanding that we are stars and He keeps great hope for us. What are God’s hopes for His children? His hopes for us are that we don’t engage our mind and intellect in just ordinary things here and there but that we constantly remain above it all like the sparkling stars. Don’t have attraction to anything, or confusion about anything. Then your time and energy are saved and you can become a star of success.
<br />Throughout my life I’ve had the desire to fulfil whatever hopes God has for me. There are many kinds of desire. A low form of desire is like a craving. It’s such that even as a person grows old, the craving, “I want this, I want this” gets stronger. A second type of desire is to wish for something. People, no matter to which religion they belong, usually pray to fulfil a wish. A third type of desire is the desire to meet God, to have a connection, relationship, communication with Him.
<br />Whatever God wants to do through you, there’s success in that. Success is your birthright. God says, “You do this and I’m with you”. See your duty as just remaining egoless and viceless. Then ‘I’ becomes ‘we’, and ‘we’ becomes ‘one’. We are one family, brothers and sisters. ‘We’ means that, even if we have to fight, we all together will fight with our collective energy. No one will fight alone by themselves. In same way, if we’re going to spread peace in the world we have to do it together. Then success will follow and you’ll be able to talk with confidence about courage and compassion.
<br />If you don’t have courage, what can you do with just compassion? Likewise, if you have courage and don’t have compassion, how can we live as one? A human being can’t take even one step without courage. If someone has pain they lose the courage to get up and walk. You may feel compassion for that person but you can’t really do anything for them because they themselves don’t have the courage to take a step.
<br />You don’t have courage when you’re caught up in your own pain and suffering. When you’re free of pain or the awareness of it, then you can do something. But then you need understanding. You should not do anything to cause sorrow and peacelessness, so you need to do something other than what most people of the world are doing.
<br />At this time what is needed is the power to forget all the past things that people have done or that I have done - otherwise there will be no newness and no unity. When you hold on to the old, there can be no oneness or newness. The recipe for newness and oneness is to let all the things of the past finish completely. Let there be no trace of the old whatsoever, because you’ll experience something new only when the old is completely finished. In terms of global oneness, if there’s newness there’ll be oneness. Even though I keep the whole world in front of me, first there should be newness in myself. What newness can I bring in my personal life? Deep love brings newness.
<br />Fire is such that it burns so that nothing visible remains. There are different types of fire: The first is the fire of love. Deep, intense love internally finishes everything old in my mind, in my work. Then I’m able to bring peace. This is what the world needs. Another type of fire is the fire of truth.  Stay very, very peaceful and let this fire remove any alloy so that falsehood finishes and only truth remains. You need very strong fire to remove the alloy of past sins or wrong actions that have been committed.
<br />It’s the way of the world that the soul leaves the body and goes. For a long time I’ve been making effort such that I leave my body peacefully. The things of the outside should not penetrate me, and whatever God is sharing within me should extend outward. When one is very clean and peaceful inside, then one’s thoughts are very elevated and whatever is to happen, happens. This state of being is a form of co-operation that also enables other souls to leave their bodies peacefully.
<br />If the heart is happy the head will be cool. Even when I’m upset about something, my face shouldn’t reveal it and my nature should be very easy. If I have to live in this body, this is how I need to live. And if I have to leave the body, I should leave with a lot of happiness, not wanting this, wanting that.
<br />Make intense effort to free yourself from anger, because if you get angry, others will take six months to forget it. Others feel pain or sorrow because of our actions. To help avoid this, serve the world in such a way, that there’s no attachment to the result. It’s good medicine not to take sorrow and to forget any source of sorrow from the past. Forgive and let go. Forgive and let go and you will stay cheerful and will never have any tears. Some hold on to situations or some situations hold on to us. Who has this illness? Be free of it from today. Replace being careless with being carefree.
<br />Become stars of hope, stars of success, sparkling stars. This is my vision for you. God’s vision is that there should be examples like this so that people can see the wonder of God. So first point your finger inwards towards yourself, then point it upwards towards God. With every breath let there be the awareness of God and love for everyone. Everyone’s eyes should open, their intellects should go towards God and they should be able to change. The time is now if we are to achieve this.

<br /><br />My True mama and papa are calling me home
<br />I’ve been playing and playing and my clothes are all dirty
<br />But my mother and father both sit on a throne
<br />I’ve had many friends along the way some very flirty
<br />But its getting late,the sun is setting, my intellect has turned too stone
<br />Like the Greek hero Jason, I have been enchanted by the Medussa for long enough
<br />Now revelation and freedom are beckoning, times are getting tough
<br /><br />Can you not hear the Clarion call of the Arch Angel Gabriel
<br />The ratatattat of the golden bugle calling all souls too return home
<br />My Mama and Papa are calling me home too the world of silence
<br />Though my playmates want too keep playing out in the cold in defiance
<br />The playground is going too be rebuilt, with all new swings and slippery dips
<br />And all the grounds are being reseeded with new grass and flowers
<br />And all of Gods children will be given a gift of 8 powers
<br /><br />So I’ll be off soon please don’t stay out too late
<br />My parents have been calling they are impatient they cannot wait
<br />My home is of sweet silence and is decorated Golden Red colour
<br />And I look like a bright star in the evening sky twinkling in Peace
<br />So whether you are Christian,or Buddhist or Athiest whatever your belief
<br />We all come from the same world, the same stock, a true United Nations
<br />Though we play different parts, like a play at the theatre
<br />Some are lead roles, some just create litter
<br /><br />My Mama and papa are a callin so I’ll be of now
<br />See you again in the future when the playground is rebuilt
<br />We can play Cowboys and Indians and have a Pow Wow
<br />Or shoot em up bank robbers with pistols going pow pow

<br />Practical Spirituality
<br /><br />Too be truly Spiritual you need a Practical Stage of spirituality,one that can stand up under any circumstance or obstacles, and under the scrutiny of any person on this planet.So it can’t be dependant on external rituals,beliefs, environment and yet a conducive environment will be created too support your objectives and attitudes. This is the law of karma working in your favour. This is called being bodiless, that is not being affected by your body or subservient too the 5 senses. The 3 powers of the soul are mind, intellect and subconscious mind, these can also be the 3 enemies of the soul and rob us of our power and self respect, like a crazy person.But if they are operating correctly, smoothly like a well oiled machine, they will produce results, and quickly, like a production line. Though the fuel the soul needs is Pure energy (or thought), pure actions (for world benefit) and the main one, a pure attitude(honest clean heart) too correctly operate. Then you will see miracles of transformations in yourself and in the world. This would be called being like an Angel, always living in the present, and looking towards the future, with no attachment and eventually no thought of the old past.

<br /><br />Here they come moaning, groaning, with souless eyes looking for brains too drain
<br />They smell of rotten flesh, an acrid sulphurous stench, always gurgling in pain
<br />There clothes are shredded there skin oozing and pulsating puss and blood
<br />I am trying too escape them in my ute running some over with a thud
<br />There intellects are dead, some are midgets, they cannot grow`
<br />If you saw them you would scream in terror or have heart failure
<br />They are mindless minions spawned from hell where they are going I do not know
<br />Ho ho ho there intellects are so dull
<br /><br />I don’t want too be caught up in that scene I say with a scream
<br />My intellect is becoming like a diamond worthy of multi-millions
<br />My soul is en-lightened and awakened , I am becoming free
<br />I connect too God every morning in meditation changing from a Zombie too a bee
<br />A busy bee collecting nectar from Gods garden and taking it back too the hive
<br />Wow I am so feeling alive, so feeling alive
<br />Maybe I can raise souls from the dead like Lazarus did
<br />And make them smell fragrant and clean
<br />You know what I mean, you know what I mean
<br /><br />So all you Zombies out there be aware be very aware
<br />Your time is now limited, no more devilish acts
<br />No more brain- drains or pain, oh the pain
<br />The gates to Heaven are opening soon, very soon
<br />And everything will be recycled for compost for the new world
<br />Yahoo yahoo Death too the Zombies and too brain-suckers

Whatever you love in life your mind and intellect will automatically follow suite. A typical example is if you have a lover or beloved, no matter what work you are doing your minds-eye will be constantly moving towards that person. Hence the term 'Lost in love' or 'Head over heels in love' or even 'Love sick'. So when we try too discipline the mind in things such as mediation or positive thinking 9 out 10 times were fighting a losing battle (i.e in losing weight), because the mind cannot be controlled nor the heart for that matter. The mind can be compared too a screen where you watch movies or type up script, this is its job, the change that souls are really seeking is in the intellect and the attitude coming from there outlook. So true spiritua;ity and change occurs when we deepen our outlook and broaden our horizons, this occurs in the subconscious. So the key too this is tapping into my original nature before I came onto this planet when I was just a point of light, a soul. And when I begin too experience new feelings and attitudes then the soul begins too fly, and my love changes from mundane things too God and world service and meditation. Try it out on this video

No it is very subtle and sublime, positive spin doctors use it alot in there seminars, If you read books like The Secret, you'll see it bantered around alot. But we actually deal with it and live by it every day, every moment of our waking lives, and it even haunts us in our dreams. Its like talking about subatomic particles (quarks) in science. It is even deeper than thoughts, its is the influencing force behind thoughts, it is like the gene pool of the soul. It guides us like a flock of migrating geese, makes us choose our parents and our enemies and friends. It is also the place in our heart where we experience accumulated burden and sin from our unresolved karmic accounts. It is the launching pad for the soul too fly or too sink into the depths of hell. The only way too clean it and lighten it is through direct contact with God in meditation or through great pain and tragedy such as an Apocolypse. Have you seen the movie Apocolypto it gives a good sense of the weight of such a tragedy. So I suggest you take the road less travelled and try some meditation in your life<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" /> Om Shanti

<br />Om Shanti, Om Mandalay, Om Padme omomom
<br />The milky Way, Alpha Centauri, The Full moon, All Lights and backdrops too this unlimited Drama
<br />Have you seen God in the tapestry of life, in a chirping cricket, or a silky winged butterfly emerging from a Crysalis?
<br />Have you seen God in an Atomic Bomb leveling all that stands before it, in a Tsunami washing away the coast line, in a starving child swollen with pain and impending death.
<br />Have you heard God speak in the whispering of the wind through the pines or the tinkling of a waterfall of a steep ravine, or the call of the Eagle on wings on high
<br />It Appears God is everywhere and nowhere but in fact he is right here now
<br />He resides in the Abode of Silence, the Golden red world of  Souls, dormant until he is invoked

<br /><br />Question: Why is there praise of “The procession of Shiva”? 
<br /><br />Answer: Because when Shiv Baba goes back, the whole swarm of souls run after Him. In the supreme region it is as though the souls are in a beehive formation. You children who become pure go back with the Father. There is praise of the procession because of His company. 
<br /><br />Essence for dharna: 
<br /><br />1. Become pure in your thoughts, words and deeds and charge the battery of your soul. Become a firm Brahmin. 
<br /><br />2. Renounce following the dictates of your own mind and those of other human beings. Follow the directions of the one Father and make yourself elevated. Become satopradhan and fly home with the Father. 
<br /><br />Blessing: May you be an elevated effort-maker who uses the word “effort” in an accurate way and moves constantly forward. 
<br /><br />Sometimes the word “effort” becomes a very good shield when you are defeated or when you fail. When a mistake happens you simply say, “I am just an effort-maker.” However, a true effort-maker can never be defeated because the real meaning of the word “effort” is to do something for the sake of the self, that is, to move along considering the self to be a soul. Effort-makers who remain stable in the soul-conscious stage move constantly forward while keeping their destination in front of them. They never come to a standstill nor do they let go of their courage and enthusiasm. 
<br /><br />Slogan: Stay in the awareness of being a master almighty authority. This brings you the awareness of being a master.

		<document id="8c491733f44cfb664ad705d5ca747be3" url=""><![CDATA[Values<br/><br/>Human beings have original qualities that are values which define our human and spiritual nature. The original qualities of each person are similar. The only difference is to be found in the intensity with which they are expressed. There are seven intrinsic qualities in human nature: peace, love, purity, happiness, power, bliss and truth.
<br /><br />These qualities, that we all possess, are expressed in our life, relationships and activities in the form of different virtues. Any virtue that we express in our life and day-to-day interactions is not usually a unique quality; normally these virtues are a variety of qualities (listed above) that work together and express themselves. If we blend some primary colours, we get a wide range of colours. While we are expressing these original qualities in action, they mix together and become virtues. 
<br /><br />For example, patience is not an original quality of the self, but it is an important virtue, necessary for keeping calm in today's world. Patience possesses a little of the quality of love, wisdom and peace. If these original qualities are missing, in the sense that we have lost our contact with them, then impatience and irritability will arise. The virtue of tolerance requires inner strength, love and peace. 
<br /><br />From the moment we are born, we are subject to many negative influences from our family, society, religion, education, the media, culture, social class and ethnic background, that tarnish our basic values and often restrict our ability to express them in the form of different virtues in our daily actions and interactions. Spirituality helps us to revive these basic values.

Therefore, tell the people of all religions the praise of Bharat, the pilgrimage place. Give everyone the message. Question: By making which effort will your final thoughts lead you to your destination and make you conquerors of sleep? Answer: Before you go to sleep at night, first of all remember the Father and your inheritance and continue to spin the discus of self-realisation. When you feel sleepy, go to sleep and your final thoughts will lead you to your destination. When you wake up in the morning you will continue to remember those points. By practising this, you will become conquerors of sleep. Those who do something will receive the reward of it. The activity of those who do this will become very well known. Song: The rain of knowledge is for those who are with the Beloved. Blessing: May you be an embodiment of power and sacrifice all your weaknesses out of love. The sign of love is sacrifice. When there is something difficult or impossible, it is experienced to be possible and easy when you make a sacrifice out of love. With the blessing of being an embodiment of power, sacrifice all weaknesses, not out of compulsion, but with your heart, because only the truth is accepted by the true Father. So, do not just sing songs of love for the Father, but become one with an avyakt stage, the same as the Father so that everyone sings your praise. Slogan: When there is remembrance of the one Comforter of Hearts in your thoughts and dreams you will then be said to be a true tapaswi soul.

What parameters are we using to define success in our lives?  If our success levels are based on external appearances then we are setting ourselves up for disappointment and defeat!
<br />When a huge organization like the Brahma Kumaris invites 200 delegates to a retreat in Mt Abu, they don’t define their success by the amount of donations received, or even the number of people served.  If one evaluates success using physical terms and variables, then today we will consider ourselves successful and tomorrow perhaps not as those variables fluctuate.  Success for the Brahma Kumaris is defined by the number of people who have been touched, leave with smiling faces and happy hearts, a vision of hope, a sense of purpose, a feeling of sharing, caring and compassion for humanity.
<br />Many children are pressured by parents and peers to ‘succeed’ in school.  Millions of dollars are spent on high-grade child education whereby parents attempt to provide a ‘sense of self-worth’, a ‘credible identity’, and a ‘status’ to the child.  But consider what message we are conveying - that a paper certificate can fix it all, open doors and guarantee you a lifetime of pay?  It’s important to encourage and draw out hidden potential but not to be fixated on degrees, titles, accolades and the likes.
<br />Is the gage of a child’s success that he goes on to construct a power plant later in his life even though he has no social skills to build harmonious relationships?  Or that a person is able to cure grade four cancers yet is unable to remain emotionally stable.  One may have conquered Mt Everest but have they conquered the hearts of those around them?
<br />When we begin to work on our soul we begin to work on the root layers of our confidence and self esteem.  Starting from this place makes us adept at learning what really matters – the ego is contained – and we are able to become balanced spirits.  Both right and left-brain are in synch.  We learn physical skills and also at the same time are able to better manage our emotional state.
<br />Success is not necessarily the destination; it is equally about the bumpy journey!  Learning to remain stable amidst crisis and chaos; to smile after a twenty-hour workday, to continue to give love despite someone’s jealousy, to be able to forgive those who criticize you, are all successes for a person on a spiritual journey.
<br />Each one of us has a spiritual ‘bank balance’.  The yogi (one who practices daily meditation) ensures that his balance is topped with love and blessings from all those around him.  If he is not winning hearts and minds whilst he crusades his way to inner, personal joy and happiness then something is amiss.  His progress cannot be deemed successful.
<br />The road to success is not necessarily one that is paved with gold.  Hardship and penance can sometimes be equally worth the ride.  It’s the small tests that we have to pass and the little things we need to do that bring smiles and miles in the relationship.  Sometimes we wait for big events to come along so that we can express our sentiments, but in fact there is no moment like the present.  Win the moment!  Win the heart in front of you right now!
<br /><br />Therefore success is not about arriving at a destination, but making the most of life on all levels at every moment.  If we are unable to live the moment, we will always be living in the future…”When I graduate… When I get my first car... When I buy my first house...” These thoughts actually perpetuate a lack in the soul and a pattern is indented whereby I will not be satisfied until I have met the goal (and perhaps also created another one to urge me on!)
<br />Be successful in this moment, with those around you.  Otherwise you may eventually look back on your life of goals attained and targets achieved, but wonder why you didn’t have a happy life or enjoy fulfilling, loving, caring relationships.
<br />At the end of the day, we won’t be remembered by those we love for our paper qualifications or our material attainments - we’ll be remembered for how much we loved, cared and made a difference to their lives.
<br />Learning to be patient, tolerant, more loving, kind and caring are the little successes we need to master in our lives even though we may come across as a ‘failure’ in the eyes of others.  The ego lives off worldly successes, such as physical power, possessions, prestige, pennies, position and pay, as that is the measure of success in worldly terms.  But now we need to create a new league of our own, one of total self-respect – this takes humility.
<br />Success based on self-respect is one in which I am totally focused on my innate qualities and virtues.  In fact the yogi is more worried about accumulating those positive traits than the above-mentioned p’s (which by the way are the result of the inner work).  There is a deep conviction that the virtues I exercise and the results that arise from that are what I the soul will carry with me and none of the physical p’s!
<br /><br />It’s time… to review how you rate your success – is it based on spiritual terms or physical terms?  Take out time to study for a ‘master’s’ degree in the area of soul development – knowing that whatever work I do on my soul will go with me eternally.  Don’t chase after the temporary as then you will surely be deceived when you next look at your soul bank balance!

If we are determined, positive, good humoured, the stimulus for this is latent in our soul. We come too our life having journeyed maybe for centuries in different lifetimes and experiences, thus reincarnating too where we are today. If we were a god fearing or god loving soul our sum outcome of who we are will be very good or easily made positive, if we did bad actions, today we will have alot of difficulties. Too change our omens we can either meditate alot on God now or succumb too lots of trials and tribulations thus settling our Karmic accounts the choice is yours, we all have a choice
