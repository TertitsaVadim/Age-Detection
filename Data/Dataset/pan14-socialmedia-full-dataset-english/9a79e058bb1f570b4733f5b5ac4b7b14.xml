<br /><br />Essentially it means &quot;selling&quot; the business to a new company promptly upon appointment of an Administrator, the preparation for sale being carried out prior to appointment. If the directors and shareholders from the new company are the same as with the previous company to prevent any abuse the sale needs additional scrutiny.
<br /><br />However , especially as the creditors don't get an opportunity to object, to prevent abuse, just before a company can use this method it must show it has used advice from a specialist. This way the company can continue to trade without interruption.
<br /><br />There are many reasons for not trading a company in administration which includes avoiding the administrators' costs and also the risks of trading a company in administration. It's often argued which key stakeholders such as customers, staff or suppliers will not remain loyal to a company in administration.
<br /><br />Administration involves the appointment of an insolvency specialist as administrator to take control of an insolvent business (from its directors) with the goal of administering it on the best interests of the creditors.
<br /><br />A pre-pack is just one type of administration. In normal administrations there are a number of possible results including return of the company to the control of the directors, such as following a restructuring or a Company Voluntary Arrangement, as well as administrator could sell the business as well as assets ahead of liquidation. In the pre-pack form resources are sold instantly on appointment of the administrator, who does not then trade the company.
<br /><br />The liabilities remain with the old business and include more than the outstanding financial obligations such as onerous or unwanted lease agreements. It's also possible to end employment contracts before the sale departing the liability behind although this is a specialist area as employees will also be protected by legislation called TUPE (transfer of undertaking protection of employment). Once the assets have been sold (liquidated) the old company is then normally wound up as a Creditors voluntary liquidation (CVL).
<br /><br />Pre-packs have got huge advantages in allowing the new company to trade without the hassles of the previous company's debt, almost without interruption keeping valued staff and equipment, contracts, relationships and clients.
<br /><br />However , to prevent abuse, especially as the creditors don't get a chance to object, just before a company can use this process it must show it has taken tips from an insolvency practitioner who must ensure the business and assets aren't sold below their value. The business and assets must therefore be independently valued. The administrator must exercise a considerably duty of care and should be capable to account for any sale and this is scrutinised when a sale is to previous owners or directors. The duty of care is set out in SIP 16 the Insolvency Practitioners' Guidelines.
<br /><br />The opportunity to end contracts implies that a pre-pack offers considerable scope for restructuring the company. That the company became insolvent shows a need for change to the business model, normally to reduce expenses to make it viable. A problem that can arise following a pre-pack is that that the brand new company then fails right after, usually because the opportunity to effect real change isn't utilized.
<br /><br />Finally, funding pre-packs can be a problem. A pre-pack involves the purchase of business and resources which requires cash although much of the finance might be provided by the bank which is essentially funding the new company to purchase out its loan to the old one. Funding required for the new company includes not only financing for the purchase but also for working capital to trade when suppliers who as creditors of the old business are likely to be wary about providing credit to the brand new one.
<br /><br />HMRC is another funding issue as the Revenue is often left with a large unsecured claim within the old company. HMRC can demand a deposit against future PAYE and VAT debts, for up to six months of payments and increasingly are invoking this right when the directors of the brand new and old companies are exactly the same.
<br /><br />While a pre-pack is often regarded as controversial since the creditors are faced with a done deal, the counter argument is the fact that a quick sale of the company assets is the best opportunity to preserve value and therefore ensure the best possible return for the creditors who also might otherwise get nothing or very little.
<br /><br />Putting a failing business into administration without a pre-pack risks a dramatic decrease in its value as a result of disruption and loss of sales during the administration.
<br /><br />Pre-packs enable a fundamentally good and viable business concept to be preserved, retaining clients, suppliers and goodwill, without all the start-up costs normally associated with a new business.

Exactly What You Can Do<br/><br/>Insolvency is if a business or an individual entity is not able to manage their financial debt payments with their current income and being not able to pay for debt when bills are due. This is an extremely hard road to go down, but is completely necessary in a lot of cases. It is to declare yourself unable to achieve the assets required to cover you or the businesses financial requirements. When you are in this situation, you better get a <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2J1c2luZXNzZnJhbWUuYmxvZ3Nwb3QuY29tLzIwMTIvMDgvaG93LXRvLXByZS1wYWNrLXlvdXItc21hbGwtY29tcGFueS5odG1s" target="_blank">pre pack insolvency</a> as soon as possible. There are many different things to consider. Consequently, every case is bespoke.
<br /><br />Insolvency is usually confused with bankruptcy. Although not the same and the two should not be confused - both concepts are not actually that dissimilar.
<br /><br />Insolvency can result from numerous factors, causing your expenses to be higher than those of your earnings. It is an assessment of your financial condition, while bankruptcy is passed through legal finding. It is a declaration of considerable financial hardship as a means of seeking debt and tax liability relief.
<br /><br />Furthermore - insolvency proceedings can happen when legal action is then taken against the insolvent company or individual. As mentioned above - It's not a lawful process, therefore it is important to realize you are not required to contribute.
<br /><br />Bankruptcy is normally reserved for individuals, rather than businesses in the United Kingdom. UK bankruptcy law follows different principles. Insolvency Advice for cash tight businesses is the quite recent mode of consultancy that caters to all manners of businesses and individuals that are experiencing deep problems. Insolvency does not always mean that a business should be stopped, closed down and disbanded. Almost everything depends on whether or not continuing of trade enables the company to come out the other side of insolvency and continue to boost its position for creditors.
<br /><br />Insolvency practitioners not just present a thorough working knowledge of insolvency law - they must additionally understand accountancy, tax legislation, business / employment law and litigation matters. These consultants use all of these skills to advise within the complex world of insolvency. This particular understanding is essential to tailor each situation, as information and resources can often be thin on the ground. To pass any Insolvency exam, you must demonstrate a firm understanding of the above and in addition, that you are capable of acting in a professional manner.

With the constriction of credit and the falling off of order books, many small businesses are now becoming nonviable, particularly if they have carried debt into the current economic crisis.
<br /><br />There are a variety of services to those looking to close their business. For many it will be a straight forward creditors' voluntary liquidation, which may or might not be accompanied by a <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2J1c2luZXNzZnJhbWUuYmxvZ3Nwb3QuY29tLzIwMTIvMDkvcHJlLXBhY2stYWRtaW5pc3RyYXRpb25zLW9wcG9ydHVuaXR5Lmh0bWw_" target="_blank">pre pack administration</a> sale of the assets and contracts of that business to another entity, either owned by the existing directors, or to a party introduced by all of them.
<br /><br />If you have any partnership, an adviser can also close that down for you, once again, utilizing a liquidation procedure, but in this case, it might be that also an adviser will offer the partners individual voluntary arrangements, which will help manage their own personal and company liabilities.
<br /><br />If business is not to close completely and there is a chance that the business can be a saved in whole or even in part, a professional can suggest on Company or Partnership voluntary arrangements, or administrations.
<br /><br />Therefore, if you wish to close your business due to economic hardship you ought to take professional advice as soon as practically possible. If the delay happens and the company undergoes greater losses it is possible that the directors can be held personally responsible for the additional loss.
<br /><br />Its clear from the latest insolvency statistics that close to 5, 000 businesses per quarter will close, in some way or another. Of course many of these will re-start, but the point to take on board is the fact that, closing a business, does not mean that you have been unsuccessful. Global influences, now affect every facet of individual economies and no-one can be shielded from the effects. The key is to realize, when you need to take advice, and at that point to act decisively.

By far nearly all Administration Orders that are granted by the legal courts are made in favour of companies. Indeed the last few years has seen a huge rise in the usage of this insolvency procedure, since government gave a signal that it wished to see a rescue culture in the UK as opposed to one that buried a company.
<br /><br />Because of this an administration can be used to buy the administrator time while he looks to see what the best answer would be for the company in question.
<br /><br />When a specialist looks at a Corporate Administration they look to see, if by doing it they will provide a better return for creditors than will be the case if the company simply went into liquidation. In most cases this primary reason for considering an Administration can be made out, as a <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2J1c2luZXNzY3ljbGUudHVtYmxyLmNvbS9wb3N0LzMxMzExODYwNjE4L2hvdy1hbi1pbnNvbHZlbmN5LXByYWN0aXRpb25lci1jYW4tdXNlLWFkbWluaXN0cmF0aW9u" target="_blank">pre pack administration</a> sale or even a pre-pack will produce a better price tag than a sale within a liquidation, when any goodwill and ongoing business has been lost.
<br /><br />An Insolvency Practitioner will look to see if its possible to do a Company Voluntary Arrangement, or CVA. This is when the company continues to trade, with it's old debts ring fenced, and regular monthly contributions made to satisfy those old debtors.
<br /><br />Finally an insolvency expert would look to see if there is any other reason why an administration might work. In the current recession, the news reports are filled with high street brands entering administration, and this is because they can carry on and trade this way, whilst giving potential suitors the opportunity to price up the value of the business before making an offer.
<br /><br />An Insolvency Practitioner will be able to tell you if your insolvent company is right for a corporate administration. If you have a potential insolvency situation make certain you take professional tips as soon as possible.

<br /><br />A winding up is the last option for a director who may well have been having difficulties for some time to turn around the fortunes of the company. Analysis shows many companies which have to close have been technically insolvent for a number of months. They have in the main really been kept afloat by directors not using their own benefits, or even worse, putting their own loans into the business to help keep it going, whilst they hope for that one order which can make them enough money to clear almost everything off. Of course , that golden egg rarely gets there and the director's own assets soon run out.
<br /><br />With nowhere else to turn the directors are left with very little option but to call in the liquidator. A big concern for company directors at this stage should be the query or wrongful trading. If the loses have increased as a result of this continued trading, the directors could be personally liable for those extra loses.
<br /><br />Of course it could all be so different, when the director had spoken to a professional advisor some months before, they would have informed him against putting that money into the insolvent business, and instead suggested him that if the company was viable, to use that investment to buy out the potentially lucrative elements from the company and re-start. This is known as the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2J1c2luZXNzZnJhbWUuYmxvZ3Nwb3QuY29tLzIwMTIvMDkvd2hhdC1pcy1jb21wYW55LXZvbHVudGFyeS1saXF1aWRhdGlvbi5odG1s" target="_blank">pre pack liquidation</a>.
<br /><br />With the &quot;business&quot; rather than the limited company shell effectively saved the IP would then have shut down the insolvent company, having advised its creditors what we had done and why. If there's a dividend to pay, this will be paid for after costs of the liquidation happen to be taken.
<br /><br />Its predicted that up to 1.5% of the company register can become insolvent this year. That could mean 40, 000 companies face an insolvency issue of some kind. Many of these will be able to save something from the business if they take advice earlier enough.

		<document id="6d5b5bff98422095f526666acfa1c1f4" url=""><![CDATA[I Need Assistance To Liquidate My Own Business<br/><br/>At this time of year Insolvency practitioners are often faced with calls from directors who need help who liquidate their companies. Some directors are quite clued up with the process, either having been through the procedure once before or perhaps having read extensively about what happens on the net. Others simply haven't got a clue. This can easily be done by using a <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2J1c2luZXNzZnJhbWUuYmxvZ3Nwb3QuY29tLzIwMTIvMDkvYnVzaW5lc3MtcmVzY3VlLWFuZC1yZXN0b3JhdGlvbi5odG1s" target="_blank">pre pack administration</a> which does a great deal for your business. All they know is that they cannot pay what they are due to various creditors therefore need to close the doors on the business.
<br /><br />It matters not to an insolvency specialist the level of knowledge that you come to them with they will direct you through the procedure from beginning to end. It obviously helps the Insolvency Specialist, if he can be provided all the financial information the business has from this he will produce the statement of affairs which goes out to the creditors with all the notice informing them of the meeting of creditors. It's the statement of affairs which testifies to the creditors that the business is insolvent and underneath the Insolvency legislation should be shut down. It must be remembered that the Directors of an insolvent business carries a duty to stop trading and incurring any further loses and take steps to formally close the business.
<br /><br />This year in England and Wales there will be over 20,000 Liquidations and about 4,000 Administrations and 700 CVA's. It's possible to see thus that there are a large number of companies each week that close down or re-structure through insolvency.
<br /><br />An insolvency specialist or expert insolvency solicitor is the ideal place to take initial suggestions about how you can close your business, the expenses involved along with the time scales and how you can re-start a business again out of the ashes from the old company.
<br /><br />Getting a new business from the old business is called a phoenix, or even a pre-pack in some circumstances, and as long as fair value is paid for any assets or contracts is generally the ideal way to preserve jobs and continuation of business.
<br /><br />As with any insolvency, it's always best to begin the process as soon as problems begin to manifest themselves as this reduces losses to creditors and maximises the probability of a successful recover in one guise or another.

<br /><br />Business insolvency figures are generally up 25% on this time last year according to the Insolvency Service (Feb 2009). These businesses clearly did not make moves to prevent such things. They could have done a <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2J1c2luZXNzZnJhbWUuYmxvZ3Nwb3QuY29tLzIwMTIvMDkvd2hhdC1pcy1jb21wYW55LXZvbHVudGFyeS1saXF1aWRhdGlvbi5odG1s" target="_blank">pre pack liquidation</a> or administration just to be on the safe side. The lack of available credit is causing immense problems to small and medium sized firms, who require funds to grow in some cases, and to re-finance expensive credit in others.
<br /><br />Cash flow problems are one indication that a business may be struggling and need assistance, but this is definitely not saying that a business cannot be saved. Since 2002 we have had a culture of 'enterprise' that has meant that the emphasis has been on saving the business, not necessarily the shell in which its housed. Therefore there is an acknowledgment that a limited company can be closed but the trade and assets from that company can be sold (often pre-appointment) to a brand new entity set up for the purpose of taking on the employees and contracts of the insolvent business.
<br /><br />The benefit of saving the good parts of a company as well as saying goodbye to the bad parts is that the whole business can be rescued. The new company will rise phoenix-like from the ashes (hence the phrase 'phoenix company' which is frequently used in such cases) and the new entity will be much leaner and healthier, with the old bits that were gradually strangling it trimmed down.
<br /><br />The advantages are many: directors will retain their salaries and the owners and shareholders will still have their incomes and, if appropriate, they can still draw their payouts. Moreover, employees and staff will still enjoy their incomes (for the most part at least, as several restructuring may involve redundancies or the selling off of divisions or departments where necessary and possibly a curtailing of things like bonuses and overtime). Suppliers will not miss out either, and this is important considering that all of us understand that business are co-existent on each other, even to a global degree.
<br /><br />In a nutshell you are able to move from business insolvency to new debt free trading with a clean balance sheet and a tighter business overnight.
<br /><br />Literally 100s of companies have benefited from this approach. A large number of employees have kept their jobs because of the assistance to the wealth creating directors that such things as positive phoenix companies, CVLs and pre-pack administrations have achieved; it is good for everybody: move forward and grow again.
<br /><br />Don't let the economic situation get you despondent. Know that help and assistance is at hand and that a decision made today can see you starting afresh within the week. Business insolvency may also be a new release.

We consider the budget you can incorporate for children living in your own home.
<br /><br />If you have children of school age who are living with you at home, when you are completing your bankruptcy application you must incorporate a sensible amount in your monthly expenditure budget to pay for their living expenses. This consists of a specific budget for housekeeping, clothing, meals at school along with a certain budget for school outings.
<br /><br />You should be comfortable that the amount you incorporate is sufficient to cover what you spend each month. However , this should also be reasonable.
<br /><br />To gauge what is sensible, the Official Receiver (OR) will compare your expenditure to a list of agreed recommendations. As long as your expenditure budgets fit within these, there ought to be no issue.
<br /><br />However , if the budget you require exceeds these, you may have to justify this and accept a lower budget if the OR doesn't accept your arguments. Clearly if you are necessary to pay maintenance for children not living with you, this should be included in your budget.
<br /><br />Children Above School Age
<br /><br />If you have kids or other people living with you who are above school age, then whether you'll be able to incorporate a living expenditure budget for them will depend on the specific situations.
<br /><br />If a child is living with you but working and providing you with money towards the housekeeping, you will need to include this form of income on your application form. It will then be reasonable to include a budget for them within your housekeeping expenditure.
<br /><br />In these circumstances, extra cash for clothing would probably not be allowed as they would be expected to pay for these things on their own.
<br /><br />Of course , if while you're bankrupt or paying an income payment order, a child you are supporting leaves home, then you will need to tell the Official Receiver.
<br /><br />Overall the effects on your income and expenditure budget should be relatively minimal as your expenses would fall but simultaneously so would your income assuming that any money you obtained from this child would cease.
<br /><br />Children Who Are Not Working
<br /><br />If children of above school age reside with you but aren't working, they may well still be depending on you. As such you may well feel that its necessary to include money in your own housekeeping budget to support them.
<br /><br />However, the Official Receiver will look at the scenario carefully. It is possible that the OR might argue that it isn't reasonable for you to continue to support your kids unless they can be seen to be doing an effort to help the household income.
<br /><br />If you have kids in higher education who you are supporting, then you should include an appropriate budget for this. Again you will have to be prepared to justify the expenditure you include. The OR will consider this in the context of your overall financial situation and may need evidence of any other income that these children receive.
<br /><br />Expenses Must Be Justifiable
<br /><br />If you are going through the bankruptcy process, you will require to submit earnings and expenditure budget so the official receiver can determine whether you can afford to contribute towards your creditors.
<br /><br />Your expenditure budget should reflect the fact that you might have dependent children living with you or you pay maintenance for children living somewhere else. If you have children living with you who are above school age, given that they are contributing to the household income, including a housekeeping budget for them shouldn't be a problem.
<br /><br />However , if they are not contributing financially, you will need to show they are still dependent on you prior to an allowance for them in your expenditure budget will be allowed.
<br /><br />Our vibrant forum provides free access to industry experts and others who have suffered with debt problems.

If something has been planned but it hasn't been prepared for, it is more likely to not do well. So, when facing such things like bankruptcy, it is always essential to be ready. Get a <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2J1c2luZXNzZnJhbWUuYmxvZ3Nwb3QuY29tLzIwMTIvMDkvY29tcGFueS1hZG1pbmlzdHJhdGlvbi1wcmVmZXJyZWQuaHRtbA__" target="_blank">pre pack administration</a>, liquidation or insolvency when possible. Having said that , if something has been planned and prepared for dutifully but there aren't enough capable and able heads and hands to bring it to success, then it is most likely to end up going down the drain.
<br /><br />The above situations are most likely some of the few reasons why companies fail and later go bankrupt. These companies simply didn't prepare any sort of pre packs and that is why they failed. So, it is important to be prepared with a <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2J1c2luZXNzZnJhbWV3b3JrLndvcmRwcmVzcy5jb20vMjAxMi8xMC8xNS91c2luZy1hLXByZS1wYWNrLWxpcXVpZGF0aW9uLw__" target="_blank">pre pack liquidation</a> as soon as possible. For a company to work and be successful, there are numerous factors that contribute to this. The list could include detailed preparation, careful planning, capable leadership, efficient workers, enough clientele, proper funding, the right creditors, and good business. Quite often, if these aspects aren't complete or if one of these factors is actually missing, then the company will possibly start spiraling down or, worse even, file bankruptcy.
<br /><br />Bankrupt companies are those companies or organizations that have filed for bankruptcy in court and were given bankruptcy protection. When a company has bankruptcy protection, it is more or less free from many kinds of financial lawsuits and problems. Of course , it has the duty to pay back its creditors, but paying them back will not necessarily mean that they would have to pay in full since they are already having a hard time with their finances. Just how much a bankrupt company will pay back to their creditors depends on the court's judgment.
<br /><br />Either way, many investors think that hoping their luck with bankrupt companies will prove to be worthwhile. They often think that buying some shares and stocks or even the whole company itself (which, of course , would be very inexpensive) will give them the chance to get richer somehow. These individuals somehow think that they can turn the luck of bankrupt companies around, pay off their debts, and make it profitable once more.
