<br />many questions about love can not be answered simply as &quot;yes&quot;or &quot;no&quot;, that is the myth of love, the fantasy of love, the pain of love. 
<br />but anyway we grow up with all kinds of love. 
<br />true love, can never catch for, someday it may catch you................

<br />And now I'm all alone again
<br />Nowhere to turn, no one to go to.
<br />Without a home, without a friend
<br />without a face to say hello to
<br />But now the night is near 
<br />And I can make-believe he's here
<br /><br />Sometimes I walk alone at night
<br />When everybody else is sleeping
<br />I think of him and then I'm happy
<br />With the company I'm keeping
<br />The city goes to bed
<br />And I can live inside my head
<br /><br />On my own
<br />Pretending he's beside me
<br />All alone
<br />I walk with him 'til morning
<br />Without him, I feel his arms around me
<br />And when I lose my way, I close my eyes and he has found me
<br /><br />In the rain
<br />The pavement shines like silver
<br />All the lights are misty in the river
<br />In the darkness, the trees are full of starlight
<br />And all I see is him and me forever and forever
<br /><br />And I know it's only in my mind
<br />That I'm talking to myself and not to him
<br />And although I know that he is blind
<br />Still I say there's a way for us
<br /><br />I love him
<br />But when the night is over
<br />He is gone
<br />The river's just a river
<br />Without him, the world around me changes
<br />The trees are bare and everywhere the streets are full of strangers
<br /><br />I love him
<br />But every day I'm lonely
<br />All my life I've only been pretending
<br />Without me, his world will go on turning
<br />The world is full of happiness that I have never known
<br /><br />I love him
<br />I love him
<br />I love him...
<br />But only on my own...

<br /><br />I think someting from scratch, 
<br />Traversed to the time, 
<br />Life's debris, designated for the physical and psychological injuries, 
<br />I look forward to be a stronger, 
<br />And we all live, 
<br />Let every day bright, happy to share. 
<br />I think something from scratch, 
<br />What would be tomorrow, 
<br />It may be difficult, there will be hope, 
<br />I won't  cry. 
<br />My mind is the sun, 
<br />Bit by bit happy, gave me strength.

<br /><br />She hated everyone, except her loving boyfriend. He was always there for her. 
<br /><br />She told her boyfriend, 'If I could only see the world, I will marry 
<br />you.'
<br /><br />One day, someone donated a pair of eyes to her. When the bandages came off, she was able to see everything, including her boyfriend.
<br /><br />He asked her,'Now that you can see the world, will you marry me?'
<br /><br />The girl looked at her boyfriend and saw that he was blind. The sight of his closed eyelids shocked her. She hadn't expected that. The thought of looking at 
<br />them the rest of her life led her to refuse to marry him.
<br /><br />Her boyfriend left her in tears and days later wrote a note to her saying: 'Take good care of your eyes, my dear, for before they were yours, they were mine.' 
<br /><br />This is how the human brain often works when our status changes.
<br />Only a very few remember what life was like before, and who was always by their side in the most painful situations. 
<br /><br />Life Is a Gift 
<br /><br />Today before you say an unkind word - 
<br />Think of someone who can't speak.
<br /><br />Before you complain about the taste of your food - Think of someone who has nothing to eat.
<br /><br />Before you complain about your husband or wife - Think of someone who's crying out to GOD for a companion. 
<br /><br />Today before you complain about life -
<br />Think of someone who went too early to heaven.
<br /><br />Before you complain about your children - 
<br />Think of someone who desires children but they're barren. 
<br /><br />Before you argue about your dirty house someone didn't clean or sweep - 
<br />Think of the people who are living in the streets.
<br /><br />Before whining about the distance you drive 
<br />Think of someone who walks the same distance with their feet.
<br /><br />And when you are tired and complain about your job - 
<br />Think of the unemployed, the disabled, and those who wish they had your job. 
<br /><br />But before you think of pointing the finger or condemning another -
<br />Remember that not one of us is without sin and we all answer to one MAKER.
<br /><br />And when depressing thoughts seem to get you down - 
<br />Put a smile on your face and thank GOD you're alive and still around.

He was 18 years old and he could die anytime. All his life, he was stuck in his house being taken cared by his mother. He never went outside but he was sick of staying home and wanted to go out for once. So he asked his mother and she gave him permission.
<br /><br />He walked down his block and found a lot of stores. He passed a CD store and looked through the front door for a second as he walked. He stopped and went back to look into the store. He saw a beautiful girl about his age and he knew it was love at first sight. He opened the door and walked in, not looking at anything else but her. He walked closer and closer until he was finally at the front desk where she sat.
<br /><br />She looked up and asked, &quot;Can I help you?&quot;
<br /><br />She smiled and he thought it was the most beautiful smile he has ever seen before and wanted to kiss her right there.
<br /><br />He said, &quot;Uh... Yeah... Umm... I would like to buy a CD.&quot;
<br /><br />He picked one out and gave her money for it.
<br /><br />&quot;Would you like me to wrap it for you?&quot; she asked, smiling her cute smile again.
<br /><br />He nodded and she went to the back. She came back with the wrapped CD and gave it to him. He took it and walked out of the store.
<br />He went home and from then on, he went to that store every day and bought a CD, and she wrapped it for him. He took the CD home and put it in his closet. He was still too shy to ask her out and he really wanted to but he couldn’t. His mother found out about this and told him to just ask her. So the next day, he took all his courage and went to the store as usual. He bought a CD like he did every day and once again she went to the back of the store and came back with it wrapped. He took it and when she wasn’t looking, he left his phone number on the desk and ran out...
<br /><br />RRRRRING!!!
<br /><br />One day the phone rang, and the mother picked it up and said, &quot;Hello?&quot;
<br /><br />It was the girl!!! The mother started to cry and said, &quot;You don’t know? He passed away yesterday...&quot;
<br /><br />The line was quiet except for the cries of the boy’s mother. Later in the day, the mother went into the boy’s room because she wanted to remember him. She thought she would start by looking at his clothes. So she opened the closet.
<br /><br />She was face to face with piles and piles and piles of unopened CDs. She was surprised to find all these CDs and she picked one up and sat down on the bed and she started to open one. Inside, there was a CD and as she took it out of the wrapper, out fell a piece of paper. The mother picked it up and started to read it. It said: Hi... I think U R really cute. Do u wanna go out with me? Love, Jocelyn.
<br /><br />The mother was deeply moved and opened another CD...
<br /><br />Again there was a piece of paper. It said: Hi... I think U R really cute. Do u wanna go out with me? Love, Jocelyn.
<br /><br />Love is... when you’ve had a huge fight but then decide to put aside your egos, hold hands and say, &quot;I Love You.&quot;

For many months he had admired a beautiful sports car in a dealer's showroom, and knowing his father could well afford it, he told him that was all he wanted.
<br /><br />As Graduation Day approached, the young man awaited signs that his father had purchased the car. Finally, on the morning of his graduation, his father called him into his private study. His father told him how proud he was to have such a fine son, and told him how much he loved him. He handed his son a beautiful wrapped gift box. Curious, but somewhat disappointed, the young man opened the box and found a lovely, leather-bound Bible, with the young man's name embossed in gold.
<br /><br />Angrily, he raised his voice to his father and said, &quot;With all your money you give me a Bible?&quot; He then stormed out of the house, leaving the Bible.
<br /><br />Many years passed and the young man was very successful in business. He had a beautiful home and a wonderful family, but realizing his father was very old, he thought perhaps he should go to see him. He had not seen him since that graduation day. Before he could make the arrangements, he received a telegram telling him his father had passed away, and willed all of his possessions to his son. He needed to come home immediately and take care of things.
<br /><br />When he arrived at his father's house, sudden sadness and regret filled his heart. He began to search through his father's important papers and saw the still new Bible, just as he had left it years ago.
<br /><br />With tears, he opened the Bible and began to turn the pages. As he was reading, a car key dropped from the back of the Bible. It had a tag with the dealer's name, the same dealer who had the sports car he had desired. On the tag was the date of his graduation, and the words… &quot;PAID IN FULL&quot;.
<br /><br />How many times do we miss blessings because they are not packaged as we expected? I trust you enjoyed this. Do not spoil what you have by desiring what you have not; but remember that what you now have was once among the things you only hoped for. Sometimes we don't realize the good fortune we have or we could have because we expect &quot;the packaging&quot; to be different. What may appear as bad fortune may in fact be the door that is just waiting to be opened.

One man was allowed to sit up in his bed for an hour each afternoon to help drain the fluid from his lungs. His bed was next to the room‘s only window. The other man had to spend all his time flat on his back. The men talked for hours on end.
<br /><br />They spoke of their wives and families, their homes, their jobs, their involvement in the military service, where they had been on vacation. And every afternoon when the man in the bed by the window could sit up, he would pass the time by describing to his roommate all the things he could see outside the window. The man in the other bed began to live for those one-hour periods where his world would be broadened and enlivened by all the activity and color of the world outside.
<br /><br />The window overlooked a park with a lovely lake. Ducks and swans played on the water while children sailed their model boats. Young lovers walked arm in arm amidst flowers of every color of the rainbow. Grand old trees graced the landscape, and a fine view of the city skyline could be seen in the distance. As the man by the window described all this in exquisite detail, the man on the other side of the room would close his eyes and imagine the picturesque scene.
<br /><br />One warm afternoon the man by the window described a parade passing by. Although the other man couldn‘t hear the band - he could see it in his mind‘s eye as the gentleman by the window portrayed it with descriptive words.
<br /><br />Days and weeks passed. One morning, the day nurse arrived to bring water for their baths only to find the lifeless body of the man by the window, who had died peacefully in his sleep. She was saddened and called the hospital attendants to take the body away. 
<br /><br />As soon as it seemed appropriate, the other man asked if he could be moved next to the window. The nurse was happy to make the switch, and after making sure he was comfortable, she left him alone. Slowly and painfully, he propped himself up on one elbow to take his first look at the world outside. Finally, he would have the joy of seeing it for himself. He strained to slowly turn to look out the window beside the bed. It faced a blank wall.
<br /><br />The man asked the nurse what could have compelled his deceased roommate who had described such wonderful things outside this window. The nurse responded that the man was blind and could not even see the wall. She said, &quot;Perhaps he just wanted to encourage you.&quot;

In fact, we don’t have to wait for anniversaries to thank the ones closet to us—the ones so easily overlooked. If I have learned anything about giving thanks, it is this: give it now! while your feeling of appreciation is alive and sincere, act on it. Saying thanks is such an easy way to add to the world’s happiness.
<br /><br />Saying thanks not only brightens someone else’s world, it brightens yours. If you’re feeling left out, unloved or unappreciated, try reaching out to others. It may be just the medicine you need.
<br /><br />Of course, there are times when you can’t express gratitude immediately. In that case don’t let embarrassment sink you into silence-speak up the first time you have the chance.
<br /><br />Once a young minister, Mark Brian, was sent to a remote parish of Kwakiutl Indians in British Columbia. The Indians, he had been told, did not have a word for thank you. But Brian soon found that these people had exceptional generosity. Instead of saying thanks, it is their custom to return every favor with a favor of their own, and every kindness with an equal or superior kindness. They do their thanks.
<br /><br />I wonder if we had no words in our vocabulary for thank you, would we do a better job of communicating our gratitude? Would we be more responsive, more sensitive, more caring?
<br /><br />Thankfulness sets in motion a chain reaction that transforms people all around us—including ourselves. For no one ever misunderstands the melody of a grateful heart. Its message is universal; its lyrics transcend all earthly barriers; its music touches the heavens.

What are they doing when I call them, this is what I   want to know most. I had supper at 5 o’clock in the dining room. There is no need for me to cook by myself, no need to wash the dishes. However, now it is the busiest time for my parents. Dad has night shift every day, he works from seven o'clock  in the morning to nine o'clock in the evening. Therefore, all the housework is left to my mum, besides her own job, she also has to work the vineyard. 
<br /><br />Every day she gets up at 4 o’clock in the morning, then works till dark. One day I called her at 7:30 in the evening, she told me that she was still in the vineyard and hadn’t had supper yet. My tears ran down from my cheeks, I was filled with worry. I promise her to study hard in the university, because I am her hope. I promise her to take care of myself, because I am important to her. I promise her to lose weight because she says nice figure is an important factor in future’s competition. I promise her so much and I just want her to promise me that she can take care of herself and dad because they are just like the blood in my body.I cannot live without them.
<br /><br />In my family, everyone is common. We are willing to earn our living by our own hands. We are very happy to have the meal together on the New Year’s Eve. My mother has ever said that everyone in the family is important, no one can be absent.
<br /><br />Mum has ever said that the happiest time for Dad and her is when my sister and I come back home.
<br /><br />We play cards in the room,watch TV,do anything we like,with dad and mum preparing delicious food in the kitchen.It is also the happiest time for me.
<br /><br />At that moment,I could forget all the difficulties and unhappiness.The only thing I would like to do is to enjoy the time with my parents.
<br /><br />Love,sometimes,doesn't need much words.Love your parents like they love us.Give them a call,tell them you miss them...

<br /><br />One morning,a young monk gets up to clean up the courtyard and sees the fallen leaves from the ancient banyan are everywhere,he can't help worrying and look at the tree to sigh.
<br /><br />For his sorrow is on the toppest,he throws down the broom and rushes to his master's room ,then he knocks on the door to plea for interview.
<br /><br />His master hears it and opens the door,when he sees the disciple's worried look,he thinks something takes place,so he hurries to ask him:&quot; My disciple, what does you worry about so much in the early morning? &quot;
<br /><br />The young disciple is full of doubt and tells him:&quot;Master, you persuades us to be diligent to cultivate our moral character and grasp the truth day and night,but, even I learn them well ,it is hard to avoid to die.Till that time,so-called me, so-called Dao, aren't they just like the defoliation in autumn or the deadwood in winter? and they will be buried by a heap of loess?&quot;
<br /><br />After hearing it ,the old monk points at the ancient banyan and says to the young monk:&quot; My disciple ,you don't need to worry about this.In fact, the defoliation in autumn and the deadwood in winter will climb back to the trees silently and become the flowers in spring and grow up into the leaves in summer at the time of autumnal winds is blowing strongliest and the snow falls down most heavily.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;Why don't I see it?&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;It is the reason that there isn't any view in your heart, so you can't see the bloom .&quot;
<br /><br />Facing the withering defoliations and imaging they will be in bud,it needs to have an immortal of spring heart, an optimism of heart.
<br /><br />There are always some miseries you will meet in your whole life and strike you when you are unprepared, but we don't need to worry day after day for the arrival of this day, and feel sorry to yourself.
<br /><br />Treating the life with the attitude of the optimism, it can not only dissolve the agony and misfortune , but also bring a kind of pleased mood to you everyday and make your life bright and flourishing .
<br /><br />As long as the view is in the heart,aren't the paths full of fragrance of flowers everywhere?

<br /><br />I got below nice story from my friend and now I forward to you as I really lose my mom after her death. It is true that the love of a mom could not be substituted by any things of the world. So when you are still having your mom now, please be kind enough to her or you will regret like I did.
<br /><br />EIGHT LIES OF A MOTHER
<br /><br />This story begins when I was a child: I was born poor. Often we hadn't enough to eat. Whenever we had some food, Mother often gave me her portion of rice. While she was transferring her rice into my bowl, she would say 'Eat this rice, son! I'm not hungry.'
<br />This was Mother's First Lie.
<br /><br />As I grew, Mother gave up her spare time to fish in a river near our house; she hoped that from the fish she caught, she could give me a little bit more nutritious food for my growth. Once she had caught just two fish, she would make fish soup. While I was eating the soup, mother would sit beside me and eat what was still left on the bone of the fish I had eaten; My heart was touched when I saw it. Once I gave the other fish to her on my chopstick but she immediately refused it and said, 'Eat this fish, son! I don't really like fish.'
<br />This was Mother's Second Lie.
<br /><br />Then, in order to fund my education, Mother went to a Match Factory to bring home some used matchboxes which she filled with fresh matchsticks. This helped her get some money to cover our needs. One wintry night I awoke to find Mother filling the matchboxes by candlelight. So I said, 'Mother, go to sleep; it's late: you can continue working tomorrow morning.' Mother smiled and said 'Go to sleep, son! I'm not tired.'
<br />This was Mother's Third Lie !
<br /><br />When I had to sit my Final Examination, Mother accompanied me. After dawn, Mother waited for me for hours in the heat of the sun. When the bell rang, I ran to meet her. Mother embraced me and poured me a glass of tea that she had prepared in a thermos. The tea was not as strong as my Mother's love, Seeing Mother covered with perspiration; I at once gave her my glass and asked her to drink too. Mother said 'Drink, son! I'm not thirsty! 
<br />This was Mother's Fourth Lie.
<br /><br />After Father's death, Mother had to play the role of a single parent. She held on to her former job; she had to fund our needs alone. Our family's life was more complicated. We suffered from starvation. Seeing our family's condition worsening, my kind Uncle who lived near my house came to help us solve our problems big and small. Our other neighbors saw that we were poverty stricken so they often advised my mother to marry again. But Mother refused to remarry saying 'I don't need love.'
<br />This was Mother's Fifth Lie. 
<br /><br />After I had finished my studies and gotten a job, it was time for my old Mother to retire but she carried on going to the market every morning just to sell a few vegetables. I kept sending her money but she was steadfast and even sent the money back to me. She said, 'I have enough money.' 
<br />That was Mother's Sixth Lie.
<br /><br />I continued my part-time studies for my Master's Degree. Funded by the American Corporation for which I worked, I succeeded in my studies. With a big jump in my salary, I decided to bring Mother to enjoy life in America but Mother didn't want to bother her son; she said to me 'I'm not used to high living.'
<br />That was Mother's Seventh Lie!
<br /><br />In her dotage, Mother was attacked by cancer and had to be hospitalized. Now living far across the ocean, I went home to visit Mother who was bedridden after an operation. Mother tried to smile but I was heartbroken because she was so thin and feeble but Mother said, 'Don't cry, son! I'm not in pain.'
<br />That was Mother's Eighth Lie.
<br /><br />Telling me this, her eighth lie, she died. 
<br />YES, MOTHER WAS AN ANGEL!
<br /><br />M - O - T - H - E - R
<br />'M' is for the Million things she gave me, 
<br />'O' means Only that she's growing old, 
<br />'T' is for the Tears she shed to save me, 
<br />'H' is for her Heart of gold, 
<br />'E' is for her Eyes with love-light shining in them, 
<br />'R' means Right, and right she'll always be, 
<br />Put them all together, they spell 'MOTHER' a word that means the world to me.
<br /><br />For those of you who are lucky to be still blessed with your Mom's presence on Earth, this story is beautiful. For those who aren't so blessed, this is even more beautiful.

<br />Actually, before I thought that I need create my happy life by myself only. 
<br />And I would like to put all burden on my shoulders. 
<br />I made myself crazy and cant breath freely. 
<br />I made the heart space more and more smaller. 
<br />I thought only myself to meet the bad things which one was coming in my life. 
<br />At last, I found my dear family stand on my backside to support me. 
<br />Only they can stand my bad temper. 
<br />Only they can contain my headiness. 
<br />Only they can give me the self-giving love. 
<br />That is the true love and the forever love for me. 
<br />That is big power for me. 
<br />Although, i always forget it. 
<br />I promisesd mango to be a confident?happy?independence girl at the beginning of this year. 
<br />That is a forever promises for mango life. 
<br />From now on, My goal  is to making a big house for my family in the near future. 
<br />Any boring thing coming just take it easy and cheer up. 
<br />That is not a big deal. 
<br />That is Mango style. 
<br />I believe that we can finish it perfectly. 
<br />Just because  if you smiling to life, she also give you a nice smiling. 
<br />Mango, come on.~ ~
