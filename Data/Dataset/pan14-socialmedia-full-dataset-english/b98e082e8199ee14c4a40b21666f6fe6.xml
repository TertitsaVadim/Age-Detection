<br /> A Romantic Epic on the Escape of the Devastation of the Soul
<br />                       by Ihrenes
<br /><br />Prelude to the Book of Love   
<br /><br />The Book of Love was written long ago.
<br />The Book of Love was written by someone,
<br />Who wished Never to be alone.
<br /><br />The Book of love was written by The One.
<br />At the beginning of Time.
<br />Someone who despite All thought,
<br />Who despite All wrote.
<br />And thought and thought and wrote even more.
<br /><br />The Book of love was the original confession.
<br />The first of All.
<br />A sole conversation.
<br /><br />The Book of Love was the First monologue.
<br />When the Only One looked around and felt the Void.
<br /><br />The Book of Love was written by the One
<br />Who with his thousand eyes saw it All.
<br />Who understood the meaning of things.
<br />Who fought the emptiness on its own.
<br />Who faced the Universe in its unique vastness.
<br /><br />The Book of Love was written despite 
<br />the surrounding void.
<br /><br />He then created Love.
<br /><br />Out of the song of Creation and interweed the texture of SpaceTime.
<br /><br />The book of Love is still being written by those who don’t who believe in Love.
<br />(to be continued..)

<br /> &quot;The Stars missed the Earth
<br /> upon which they were meant to shine
<br />onto endless Nights 
<br /> of the purest skies
<br /> Blue and White
<br /> Silver and Dark
<br /> so pure was their Search
<br /> and so it would remain 
<br /> until the very Time himself 
<br />             STOPPED
<br /> and yet Then
<br />It shall be timeless
<br />As a photon which sits on top
<br />of the nascent Universe
<br />and starts it All over again.
<br />Once more
<br />in an Endless passionate Dance
<br />forever More.
<br /> &quot;I want more&quot;, they all once shouted
<br />and the Sun gave them the Earth.
<br />&quot;I want more!!&quot;, they this time in unison cried
<br />and the Skies gave them their glow.
<br />&quot;We don’t have enough !!&quot;, and the Universe gave
<br />them your Eyes.
<br />Then they stood
<br />	    STILL 
<br />          as if for all Time.
<br />In the vastness of Space
<br /> Shining bright
<br />as if contempt... 
<br />as if satisfied.
<br />For there were no other eyes as precious as
<br />yours.&quot;
<br />	Fragment from
<br />&quot;The Book Of Love” ,by Ihrenes.

<br /><br />I have just started to represent (helping my father) the worlds best

The jets are SEXY and beautifully designed and can also be custom decorated for the client, they are super fuel efficient as well as emission efficient (better than conventional ones in terms of global warming CO2 emissions). These are the absolute LATEST in jets!!
<br />(We can also arrange for immaculate condition previously used jets).
<br /><br />If you or anybody you know is interested in one of the airplanes, Piaggio p180 Avanti II, please let me know and I we will provide all the specific information for your client.
