Taking tough and straightforward questions from Chinese students, and solicted from across China via the internet, the President discussed everything from Taiwan to the role of women in society to open government. Read through all of the exchanges in the full transcript.
<br /><br />In his extensive and probing opening remarks, the President related America's history, triumphing over tragedy and difficulty, to China's own story:
<br /><br />Of course, the story of our nation is not without its difficult chapters. In many ways -- over many years -- we have struggled to advance the promise of these principles to all of our people, and to forge a more perfect union. We fought a very painful civil war, and freed a portion of our population from slavery. It took time for women to be extended the right to vote, workers to win the right to organize, and for immigrants from different corners of the globe to be fully embraced. Even after they were freed, African Americans persevered through conditions that were separate and not equal, before winning full and equal rights.
<br /><br />None of this was easy. But we made progress because of our belief in those core principles, which have served as our compass through the darkest of storms. That is why Lincoln could stand up in the midst of civil war and declare it a struggle to see whether any nation, conceived in liberty, and &quot;dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal&quot; could long endure. That is why Dr. Martin Luther King could stand on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial and ask that our nation live out the true meaning of its creed. That's why immigrants from China to Kenya could find a home on our shores; why opportunity is available to all who would work for it; and why someone like me, who less than 50 years ago would have had trouble voting in some parts of America, is now able to serve as its President.
<br /><br />And that is why America will always speak out for these core principles around the world. We do not seek to impose any system of government on any other nation, but we also don't believe that the principles that we stand for are unique to our nation. These freedoms of expression and worship -- of access to information and political participation -- we believe are universal rights. They should be available to all people, including ethnic and religious minorities -- whether they are in the United States, China, or any nation. Indeed, it is that respect for universal rights that guides America's openness to other countries; our respect for different cultures; our commitment to international law; and our faith in the future.
<br /><br />These are all things that you should know about America. I also know that we have much to learn about China. Looking around at this magnificent city -- and looking around this room -- I do believe that our nations hold something important in common, and that is a belief in the future. Neither the United States nor China is content to rest on our achievements. For while China is an ancient nation, you are also clearly looking ahead with confidence, ambition, and a commitment to see that tomorrow's generation can do better than today's.
<br /><br />In addition to your growing economy, we admire China's extraordinary commitment to science and research -- a commitment borne out in everything from the infrastructure you build to the technology you use. China is now the world's largest Internet user -- which is why we were so pleased to include the Internet as a part of today's event. This country now has the world's largest mobile phone network, and it is investing in the new forms of energy that can both sustain growth and combat climate change -- and I'm looking forward to deepening the partnership between the United States and China in this critical area tomorrow. But above all, I see China's future in you -- young people whose talent and dedication and dreams will do so much to help shape the 21st century.
<br /><br />I've said many times that I believe that our world is now fundamentally interconnected. The jobs we do, the prosperity we build, the environment we protect, the security that we seek -- all of these things are shared. And given that interconnection, power in the 21st century is no longer a zero-sum game; one country's success need not come at the expense of another. And that is why the United States insists we do not seek to contain China's rise. On the contrary, we welcome China as a strong and prosperous and successful member of the community of nations -- a China that draws on the rights, strengths, and creativity of individual Chinese like you.
<br /><br />To return to the proverb -- consider the past. We know that more is to be gained when great powers cooperate than when they collide. That is a lesson that human beings have learned time and again, and that is the example of the history between our nations. And I believe strongly that cooperation must go beyond our government. It must be rooted in our people -- in the studies we share, the business that we do, the knowledge that we gain, and even in the sports that we play. And these bridges must be built by young men and women just like you and your counterparts in America.

<br />. we visited here and talked with elderlies. the vision in home of elderly made us feel very surperised. In my imagine I think there are many people go there to visit these elderlies and government will pay lots of money to make the life of these elderlies better. In fact there are two small buildings in this home of elderly and you must go through a long dark street. No one can find these two building easily. The rooms in these two building are very dark and dirty. In the rooms there is a very strong stink and there is a little people take care of the elderlies and many elderlies' child can't afford elderlies to live with them or don't want to pay attention to elderlies. It scared me. Finally we played with elderlies and listened they sing to made they feel happy. I will visit there again. Second I joined in dancing show after school to conduct a new phone of No. I'm very happy I can help other and da these valuable things. I also do many volunteer work for my dancing club. This time I also invite GCA 10-B Antony dancing with me. This work not very hard but we need to spend lots of time on it. Because we need to dance for three times. Although we only need to dance for 10mintes and play a small game with supporter. we still need to stay there for a whole day. We arrived the stage at 10:30. 30 mintes later we needed to have the first dancing show. after we eat  lunch at KFC which near the stage. The second show is at 1 pm. The last show is at 4 pm. Between these three time we are very stressed and have nothing todo but we use this time to help the admins of Nanjing Library clean up the floor. When we dance on the stage there were so many people watch us. It makes Antony felt very nervous and made some mistake. But we didn't let this feeling had bad effect on us. We learn lots of things and get a very useful experience. It looks very easy. In fact we practise for it show for 5 days. These are the most of my volunteer work. Thank you for your attention.

<br />In the beginning I go there with my classmate Robert. At first we plan to help clerk to sale the medicine or help them to bring the medicine which is the customer wants. But in fact we didn’t know only the people who have health certificate from hospital can stand behind the medicine-chest or touch the medicine. So we only can do some easy things for clerks such as swap the floor and help clerk to admit the customers. It is not hard but I can learn many things. At first there are two different kinds of medicine in drug store. One is OTC the other one is prescribed drug. OTC can sale without the prescription from the doctor because this kind of medicine is harmless. But prescribed drug is harmful if patients don’t take care of them will have a big side effect. Sometimes people will use a card to pay money. They have no need to use cash. The name of this kind of card is Vitale. This card can divide into three part government pay one-third company you work for pay one-third and you pay one third. But this card can’t pay for every kind of medicine. You only can buy the medicine in the scope of medical insurance. Goods in the drug shop can be divided into 5 different varieties. Medical apparatus &amp; instruments, health products, birth control drug and medicine. People often know the name of the medicine they want to buy. Sometimes also will meet the people don’t know which kind of medicine they want to buy so we will ask them some question and give some important information to clerk. Because we don’t have enough time and energy to remember all the name of medicine it is impossible. I could only remember Amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium dispersible tablets. It is a famous medicine and the Chinese name of this medicine is shorter than the English name of this medicine so I can remember this name.
<br />It is a very useful experience in my life I get lots of information about medicine and I can know the Medicare of China. It is necessary.

<br />The parents meeting was start from 12:30 to 4:00 on April 28th. Because I am not the member of leadership. I only can help teacher to explain some easy things and asked parent where they should go to. This work sounds very easy but it takes all the volunteers almost 5 hours to do it. Every teacher has a translator to explain what they said in Chinese. But some parent will ask some easy question such as &quot;What is Planning Class?&quot; &quot;What does teacher teach in Social Study?&quot; because there are 140 teacher in Grade 10 but only almost 15 teacher in Grade 10. Each parent only has 15 minutes to talk with parent. It is waste the time of parent and teacher. So my duty is explain those kinds of questions to parents. It is also a hard work. Sometimes I need to explain again and again to one parent after this parent other parents want to ask the same question to me. It makes me feel very boring and tired. It is a challenge to my patience. But I control myself to be patient because I know teachers are more tired than me. After the first meeting some parents need to go to the second meeting because there are too many parents. The teacher divides the parents into two groups. I need to ask parent where they should go. I went to do another work when the last parents meeting have been open for 30min. Then some parents arrived here and asked me where they should go. I also need to bring the water or coffee to teachers it is so busy.
<br />Those things are very common in our daily work time. It is a very important working experience. I hope I can have more chance to do this kind of work.

But I spend the most of my time into dancing club. I use to be the leader of Dancing Club before it is merged. I really love dancing.
<br />There are many public events in this school. So I often have chance to perform on the stage. Every time the clapping from audience support me to continue this hobby. Especial we perform on the Art Festival we do a very good job. The clapping from audience makes me feel more brave. This time I am the organizer of a perform named Beauty and the Beast. This time I will put the singing and dancing together. It is a very big challenge for me. But I know it is also a chance for me It is my first time to direct performing. I need to take care to some things I have never pay attention. I need to worried about the perform costume, lights and music. I just practice dancing before but this time I need to do more things. The most difficult thing is the relation between two performers is very bad. It makes them feel bad so I must talk with them one by one. I must make sure every performers practice hard and arrange their work fairly. It is a challenge for me. I won’t give up. I will prove I also can be a good director.
<br />There is the most important part in Dancing Club. Although this performing not perform yet I still think it will get a success.

It is a very famous American restaurant in Nanjing. Because all the people from American think the taste of food in this restaurant is the most like the American food. 
<br />This Henry’s home is on the Hua Qiao road.. There is no very far away from my home. So we went there on foot. This is not a very big restaurant only can fit almost 25 people. So I chose a seat near the wall to have this big meal. In fact I have American food for many times I really love this kind of food. But this time I order a bowl of soup and a steak. My mother asked ice-cream and a plate of shara. I think it is important to eat the food from other country. Because food can relict the sprit of one country’s culture. If I want to learn the American I must know the culture of American. If I want to know the culture of American I need to know the food, clothes and other some daily things of American. Food is a very important part in these things. I can learn many things I by this time. First I know which kind of food American love. Second I can know some  courtesy in the big meal. How to use some special  tableware such as knife. Although I have American food many times I still don’t know how to use knife well. I only could use spoon very well.
<br />It is necessary for me to have food from other country. I wish I could go there at least 10 times.

There are many kinds of hiphop dancing style. I like popping and breaking best.. Also when I have class outside I always ride bike to there.
<br />Hiphop is a very interesting things you should learn. I have a really time when I practise my dacing skill. I used to learned hiphop in a dancing club called 1808. It is one of the most famous dancing clubs. But now I join in another dancing club called Crazy Tempo. Because popping is my favourite dancing skill and CT has the best popping group in Nanjing. Popping not very dangerous. You don’t need to worry about injuring. Opposite you need to do more work if you want to do a job on popping. Everyday you need to do the same boring practise action. The practise actions not cool. But you have to do these actions for 1 hour a day.In order to make my dancing more attractive, I try to learn another dancing style called breaking. These two different dancing style need a very strong body. So I need to do many exercise everyday, such as push-up, handstand and sit-up. These kinds of exercise often makes my very tired. But when I have done I feel the power in my body almost be burned. There are many difficult actions in Breaking. Some of actions are a little dangerous. Such as If you can’t be very carefully when you practise freeze. You body will foutre par terre. You need to keep the balance of your body. 
<br />I think the most physical activities times are spend on riding bicycle. Everyday I rided bike to class. It is a very good chance for me to do exercise. The only disadvantage is Nanjing is so hot in summer. It won’t takes me lots of time everyday. But the total time of riding bike in summer is 20 hours. This result makes me feel very energetic
