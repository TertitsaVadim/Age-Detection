<br /><br />He made man in his own image 
<br />and provided him with all the good things of life.
<br />The birds of the skies, the animals in the wild,
<br />The water in the ocean and the plants on the land, 
<br />He created them all, all in favour of man.
<br /><br />When man was naked, he gave him food,
<br />Yet he forgot how good God is.
<br />The birds in the sky, the fishes in the oceans,
<br />The animals on the land, the living and the non-living 
<br />All give praises to God, yet men forgot his good deeds.
<br /><br />The one that understands the Geography of the earth,
<br />And other heavenly bodies made the sky blue to suit men.
<br />The sun rise, shine and sets, the moon takes over from the sun
<br />We sleep and we wake, yet we think all is a coincidence.
<br />I’m about to set right one of the greatest mistakes man has made.
<br />This will be by asking simple questions, and I will answer them as best as I can.
<br /><br /><span class="textAlign textAlignCenter">The theory of Evolution Explained……</span>
<br />Why do men die????
<br /><br />This is not one of the hardest things to do and it’s not the easiest thing either, because the ability of man is limited and this can give the answer to the whole mystery.
<br />For the people who don’t believe there is God, there is a supernatural being that resides somewhere men cannot figure out. He’s in control of everything that goes on, he even knows the number of the sands on earth, the stars in the sky and the hair on your head if you’ve got any.
<br />That’s kind of funny u will say, but back to the main point, 
<br />?	If truly men evolved from prokaryotes (a cell without a nucleus) where did the eukaryotic cell gets its nucleus????
<br />?	If the big bang story was true, who made the hydrogen and helium atoms????
<br />If truly men evolved, we shouldn’t really die, we should be able to transform.
<br />Death is inevitable, even to the man that doesn’t believe God exists.
<br /><br />To be contd.
<br />                                                                                                                        Kelvin.oba

<br />You can look into my eyes to tell me you love me.
<br />You touch my heart like the dews touches the lily
<br />Even more than the rain touches the ground
<br /><br />My heart beats for you and long for you.
<br />When you are around, my world gets lively
<br />But when u are gone, it’s like a night
<br />Without a moon and a life with no air
<br /><br />The sun aiin’t the only thing shining,
<br />You are brighter compared to a star.
<br />Your pretty look and your kind gesture
<br />Brings jealousy to my world
<br /><br />You are like a treasure in my treasury bank,
<br />Yet diamonds can’t be compared to you.
<br />You are priceless and colourful like the rainbow
<br />And living without you seems impossible.
<br /><br />The colour of your eyes is so colourful
<br />like d feathers of a peacock, so outstanding
<br />And I can proudly say you are the finest and the sweetest.
<br />I’ve been through a lot, but no one is like you
<br /><br />Your sweet melodies and
<br />The sweet memories you imposed on my life will 
<br />Never fade away
<br />even till eternity comes
<br /><br />I should have seen this coming, 
<br />but I was blinded from the start. 
<br />You knocked me off the ground &amp; picked me up with a new hope
<br /><br />You gave me a new beginning and as the days goes by, 
<br />I love u more
<br />And now that you are mine,
<br />I’m gonna keep you forever.

<br />Thinking about what he’s done to himself.
<br />His heart is heavy and tears roll down his cheek.
<br />Its like his life is over and he’s left alone,
<br />Not even with any air to survive.
<br /><br />Even in this critical condition,
<br />The thought about her still rules his mind.
<br />Been unable to rule these thoughts out
<br />Ruins his mind and he chokes even more.
<br />Taking deep breath every seconds, that’s how he rolled.
<br /><br />His whole life seems messed up
<br />And it’s like nowhere to go
<br />Up, down, north, south is all about her
<br />Everywhere they went together brings the thought of her
<br />The clock is ticking, yet it doesn’t look like he will survive.
<br /><br />Life is like a mess even though the time to flex is less
<br />And still, he’s struggling maybe he will survive
<br />This shouldn’t have happened if only he knew about life.
<br />The love, trust and care that he has for her is what brought him here.
<br /><br />Only now that the time is gone and death is near
<br />Is when he realised what it takes to survive.
<br />He realised just one thing, the truth about life
<br />The truth is even though you love,
<br />Don’t trust anyone because that’s the secret to live long.

<br />Accepted with love and care by strangers.
<br />The strangers that accepted you became your first love
<br />They loved you more than anything you can ever think of.
<br />You became their pride, fame and source of joy.
<br /><br />You loved them the same way they loved you,
<br />Until another stranger came your way
<br />Just to take all the love and the only heart you have
<br />Your heart was stolen by this irresistible stranger.
<br />As time went by, the stranger became a part of you.
<br /><br />You were born as a stranger into a strange world
<br />And the irresistible stranger that stole your heart away
<br />Became your second love
<br />A love you somehow fancy,
<br />Even more than your first love.
<br /><br />The excitement of the world made you so forgetful,
<br />You forgot that you are  just a stranger in this world
<br />You felt so comfortable and did all you could,
<br />But in your ignorance,
<br />You called your home a strange place.
<br /><br />But Lo and behold,
<br />here comes another stranger,
<br />A stranger you love to hate.
<br />An inevitable one,
<br />That will take everyone
<br />To where they truly belong.

<br />i dunno why the world will never change. they wait for you to die and even people that dnt know u will come out den and tell how much they luv u and miss you. if you really appreciate someone, do you have to wait till they are no more??? Trust me, when sum1 is dead your love will no longer mean anything to them. Where were all this people mouning MJJ when he was been prosecuted?
<br />where were they when his heart was heavily broken and it was like he's loosing his mind???
<br />whete were they when he was been ridiculed by the media???
<br />I'm sure if they all showed him this kinda love and support, MJJ will still be leaving today(If God wish) cos when you are happy, you have the chances of living longer.
<br /><br />Neways, i didnt write this just cos i felt like writting a long message.
<br />I wrote it to let you know that if we love someone or care about them, we should express to them how we feel cos it will go a long way.
<br />Don't wait till people are dead before you show them love. Spread the word and share the love.......Bless u

<br />You will forgive everyone that offended you,
<br />and ask everyone you might have offended for forgiveness.
<br />You will go to places you've never been and do the things you've never done.
<br /><br />If it was your last day on earth,
<br />I’m sure you will show someone you just met some unconditional love.
<br />You will tell your life history to your loved ones &amp; friend
<br />and tell them how much they mean to you.
<br /><br />If it was your last day on the land of the living,you will be full of pity,
<br />both for yourself and the ones that are less privilege.
<br />You will wish you can turn back the hands of time, 
<br />just to right the wrongs you did and live the best moments of your life again.
<br /><br />But if it’s indeed your last day on earth,                                                                                                                
<br />it will be too late to ask everyone you have offended for forgiveness.
<br />Telling someone you love them might not be as easy                                                                                     
<br />cos you know you have limited time to be there for them.
<br /><br />It will be too late to make a difference to someone’s life 
<br />cos you will have too much on your plate than you can chew.
<br />Visiting places you've never been wouldn’t be your best option,
<br />cos the most you will b able to do is get ready to die.
<br /><br />To avoid discomfort on your last day,
<br />Love God with all your earth and tell someone you dunno that you care.
<br />Appreciate the people around you and tell em how much they mean to you.
<br />Make a difference day by day.
<br /><br />Share what you know and be full of kindness to everyone.
<br />Don’t let the up's and down of this world drown you.
<br />And like a pay as you go sim , live your life to the fullest as you go through life.
<br />And by so doing, you will be less worried about when you will die.
<br />No matter who you are, you won’t know when ur last day will be,
<br />and even if u know, it will be too late to make amends.

<br />My heart is heavier
<br />My breath is deeper
<br />I talk slowly and I watch what I say
<br />I take time to do everything
<br />Just because I don’t wanna hurt you
<br /><br />The time goes by,
<br />And its like the world is coming to an end.
<br />The sun rise and set,
<br />The day increases in number,
<br />Yet, its like things are not changing
<br /><br />The world is moving so fast without a destination,
<br />But I have a determination
<br />That will soon become a manifestation
<br />Because I’m reaching out for your heart.
<br />All I need is your love, trust, kindness and care.
<br /><br />The tides of the ocean
<br />Cant be compared to how 
<br />Deeply touched I am 
<br />By your love baby.
<br />I hope u cn feel what I feel.
<br /><br />Will you ever love me?
<br />Or at least show me 
<br />That you care
<br />Because all I want is your love.
<br />You are the only one that can wipe away this blue tears..

<br />Unto whom should you feel sorry for?
<br />The earth, the sea, the moon and the sun,
<br />Every living and non living hears the voice of God.
<br /><br />The humans with sight see his wondrous works
<br />And there mouths are filled with testimony.
<br />Life is a mystery,
<br />Yet he made some secrets known to us.
<br /><br />The wise fears the lord
<br />And keep his commandments.
<br />The unwise are destroyed by lack of wisdom.
<br />Who is the ungrateful one???
<br /><br />As big as the body is,
<br />The only way we get information 
<br />is by seeing or hearing.
<br />Yet, God reveal things to the deaf and the blind.
<br /><br />He loads us daily with his benefits,
<br />And add more beauty to our life.
<br />In times of joy and sorrow, he remains faithful.
<br />Though weeping might endures for a night,
<br />He gives us  joy in the morning.
<br /><br />He decided to bless men above all creatures,
<br />So he made us in his own image
<br />And gave us dominion over all things.
<br />Who is the ungrateful one?
<br />A soul that says there is no God is ungrateful.
