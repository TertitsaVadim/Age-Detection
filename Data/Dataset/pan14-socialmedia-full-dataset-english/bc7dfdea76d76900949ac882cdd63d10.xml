Of course, you don't need to push the limits for kids in the &quot;Farm&quot; league (age 7 to eight), and a shorter bat of 26 to 27 inches will do just fine.  Junior Minors (age 8 to 9) should strive bats from 27 to 29 inches in length.  Senior Minors (age 9 to 12) do properly with 28 to 31-inch bats, and Majors (age 10 to 12) can simply swing a 29 to 32-inch bat. <br /><br />In the end, it's not in regards to the type of bat, or wallop at the plate. Kids having enjoyable is what counts most.
