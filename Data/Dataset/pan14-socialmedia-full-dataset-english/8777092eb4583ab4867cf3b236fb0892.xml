<br /><br />Happiness is ultimately what we seek. No matter what we do, we actually at the most basic want to be happy and be loved. If you think you don't have enough time, money, or whatever to do what makes you happy. Consider using the 80/20 rule to make yourself happier on the job and off. Spend more time doing what you love and getting paid for it.

<br /><br />The most challenging may be meditation.  Most of us pray and know we “should” meditate yet find it weird, confusing or requiring too much spiritual discipline.  What a relief to now have hard science to tell us we can’t do it wrong.  There are many paths to that mindful connection with our inner selves…and the right one is the way we are drawn to go.<br /><br />Read more: <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fhappierthanever.com%2Fmeditation-you-cant-do-it-wrong%2F%23ixzz210nuetGl"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://happierthanever.com/meditation-you-cant-do-it-wrong/#ixzz210nuetGl</a>

<br /><br />The evidence keeps mounting up that we are not imagining the benefits of meditation.<br /><br />Researchers at the University of Oregon have released a study showing only four weeks of meditation yielded measurable increases in “gray matter” within our brains.<br /><br />Yi-Yuan Tang and Michael Posner reported improved mood changes as well in  the Early Edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. <br /><br />Read more: <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fhappierthanever.com%2Fmore-proof-meditation-improves-brain-function%2F%23ixzz210oJUsba"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://happierthanever.com/more-proof-meditation-improves-brain-function/#ixzz210oJUsba</a>

<br /><br />You may have heard of Pareto’s Law. Whatever you are doing, approximately 80% of the benefit comes from 20% of the effort. A business earns 80% of its sales from 20% of its customers. You call 20% of your friends 80% of the time.<br /><br />It applies to clutter, too. You use 20% of your possessions 80% of the time. This makes it a lot easier to zero in on unnecessary items and their natural collecting point….closets. After all, you can always shove in more and forget it.<br /><br />Read more: <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fhappierthanever.com%2Fhow-to-clear-clutter-the-8020-way%2F%23ixzz22p7oXXXy"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://happierthanever.com/how-to-clear-clutter-the-8020-way/#ixzz22p7oXXXy</a>

<br /><br />What Makes You Happy?<br /> Are you doing it?  If not, why not?<br /> If you’re like me, you could come up with endless stories and &quot;good&quot; reasons that seem to make sense...as long as you accept the premise that we don’t get to do what we want…or have to wait for “some day” which by definition cannot ever arrive and become today.

<br /><br />What is happiness? It's an inner state, the way we feel right now, no matter is what is happening around us. It's independent of what are people are doing. It's the way are are on earth and he way we experience everything around us.

<br /><br />The first step in Free Travel Karma is collecting airline miles and learning how to use them for maximum value. Airline miles have become an alternative currency since the launch of American AAdvantage in 1981. The program was an immediate success and copied within a week by rival United Airlines MileagePlus.

<br /><br />You can earn miles by signing IF you sign up a credit card with one or more of the member programs and use that same credit card to pay at a member restaurant. Base rate is 3 miles/dollar and 5 miles/diollar after 12 annual transactions in the same program.  Priority Club and Hilton Hotels award 5 points/dollar and 8 points/dollar at the 12-dine level.

<br /><br />A lactic acid peel is alpha hydroxy (AHA) in various concentrations applied to clean skin for up to seven minutes. I recommend starting with a mild 40% solution which is quickly washed off, the skin is normalized with a Ph Prep solution and left fresh, glowing and free or dead cells and minor sun damage.

<br /><br />One thing at a time is all you can get done! That includes the things you used to do, things you truly must do and things you definitely should do…and they are all fighting with the new things you started that seemed such a good idea at the time.<br /><br />You have too much to do, literally, and spend more time rewriting endless lists than doing any of them.  You’re stressed, confused and probably not sleeping enough, thinking that will help.  But it doesn’t.  You get further and further behind.

<br /><br />Long before Norman Vincent Peale wrote about The Power of Positive Thinking or The Secret told us we can have anything we can imagine, Florence Scovel Shinn self-published the classic “The Game of Life and How to Play It” in 1925.<br /><br />Shinn was a pioneer of motivational thinking who took the universal truths in the Bible and translated them into her inspiring work, “The Game of Life and How to Play It.”<br /><br />What is The Game of Life?  Shinn tells us, ”Jesus Christ taught that it was a great game of Giving and Receiving.”<br /><br />Read more: <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fhappierthanever.com%2Fhow-to-play-the-game-of-life%2F%23ixzz28Oq7feb7"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://happierthanever.com/how-to-play-the-game-of-life/#ixzz28Oq7feb7</a>

<br /><br />A miracle is a gift, the gift of the unexpected, the gift you did not create or deserve. A miracle arrives – quite predictably – when you are ready to receive it. The Universe is a a marvelous open air market, matching givers with receivers every day. You can create the space for miracles to happen by living in the Miracle Zone, a place where anything can happen – and does! Be ready to receive, and your giver will appear.<br /><br />Read more: <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fhappierthanever.com%2Fchoose-miracles%2F%23ixzz28OqhWtCS"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://happierthanever.com/choose-miracles/#ixzz28OqhWtCS</a>

<br /><br />I completely understand, and I need money, too! I wish I could tell you to imagine dollar bills falling on your head! Or write $10,000 checks to yourself. Or pay for lots of programs to hypnotize yourself into believing cash will come pouring in the door. There's nothing wrong with doing any of those things. It can all feel very good! But if you want ANYTHING in life to happen, you already know that you have to take action.
