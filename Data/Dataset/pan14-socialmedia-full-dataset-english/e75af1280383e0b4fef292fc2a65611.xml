I am eager to find a new way to continue my life. The weather is strange in this season in Chengdu. It's cloudy on the morning,  rains at noon and a shining sunshine in the afternoon. Someone says it is the weather of the earthquake, so many bad news are around us,  we can do nothing but forget them by enjoying those wonderful things.

<br />There are two videos, one is about a lady and the other is about a small boy,  their voices touched me too much.

Personally, I love this kind of weather. I love rain very much, especially the eve of the storm. The sky is dark, leaves of the tree are swing just like struggle to flee from the control of the big wind. But it is no good for the crops, I worry about at the end of this year if we can gain for the enough food and vegetable.
<br />Anyhow, there is still something let me feel good as follows. I planted this flower for two years. Every summer it will devote the elegant flower to me . It is common in Chengdu, and many places of the south in China.

You just do everything you like even it is boresome, you must do it without distraction. &quot; I tried. He is right,  I feel better when I play a simple game on the computer and nothing can let me distracted. The feeling is great. I think we need relaxation, but sometime I forgot.

But I don't know why there are some lines of the poem of when I m dead, my dearest appear in my brain. I loved this poem few years ago. Christina Georgina Rossetti was my favorit poet. Tonight I read this poem again and come back those days in campus.
<br /><br /><strong>When I am Dead,My Dearest</strong>¬——by Christina Georgina Rossetti 
<br />When I am dead,my dearest,
<br />Sing no sad songs for me;
<br />Plant thou no roses at my head,
<br />Nor shady cypress tree: 
<br />Be the green grass above me 
<br />With showers and dewdrops wet,
<br />And if thou wilt, remember, 
<br />And if thou wilt, forget.
<br /><br />I shall not see the shadows, 
<br />I shall not feel the rain; 
<br />I shall not hear the nightingale 
<br />Sing on, as if in pain: 
<br />And dreaming through the twilight 
<br />That doth not rise nor set, 
<br />Haply I may remember, 
<br />And haply may forget.
