<br /><br />To all you players out there..
<br /><br />Just because we act like we're okay means we are!
<br />Just because we don't cry in front of you it doesn't mean we don't cry!
<br />Just because we smile next time we see you, it doesn't mean we want to!
<br />Just because your friends thought it was cool, means that it is!
<br />Just because you have a reputation to keep, means you have to keep it!
<br />Just because a girl seems easy means she has no feelings!
<br />Just because you pressure a nice girl in to something means she wanted to!
<br />Just because you don't feel anything for her, means that she felt nothing for you!
<br />Just because another girl is flirting with you, means you have to leave your girlfriend!
<br />Just because she's intelligent it doesn't mean she's a bitch who deserves all she gets!
<br /><br />so heres some final words for you...
<br />Being a player isn't cool. Making a girl feel like an idiot isn't fun. And ruining a girls reputation and trust in guys for laughs is not funny. I hope you are proud of yourself for all your achievments!
<br /><br />So if you hate being played send this to as many people as you can under the title &quot;I hate being played!&quot;. If you hate playing do the same, but under the title &quot;I hate playing girls!&quot;
<br /><br />I am a girl who hate's being played!

<br /><br />• When she says she's ok dont believe it talk with her
<br /><br />•Never cheat on her because 10 yrs later she'll remember you
<br /><br />• Call her at 12:00am on her birthday to tell her you love her
<br /><br />• Call her before you sleep and after you wake up
<br /><br />• Treat her like a person and not something to show off for
<br /><br />• Tease her and let her tease you back.
<br /><br />• Stay up all night with her when she's sick.
<br /><br />• Watch her favorite movie with her.
<br /><br />• Give her the world.
<br /><br />• Let her wear your clothes.
<br /><br />• When she's bored and sad, hang out with her.
<br /><br />• Let her know she's important.
<br /><br />• Kiss her in the pouring rain.
<br /><br />• When she runs up at you crying, the first thing you say is;
<br />&quot;Who's ass am I kicking babe?&quot;
<br /><br />If you do post this in the next four minutes the one you love will :

<br /><br />she ended up staying longer than
<br /><br />planned,
<br /><br />and
<br /><br />had to walk home alone. She wasn't
<br /><br />afraid
<br /><br />because it was a small town and she lived
<br /><br />only
<br /><br />a
<br /><br />few blocks away.
<br /><br />As she walked along under the tall elm
<br /><br />trees,
<br /><br />Diane asked God to keep her safe from
<br /><br />harm
<br /><br />and
<br /><br />danger.
<br /><br />When she reached the alley, which was a
<br /><br />short
<br /><br />cut to her house, she decided to take it.
<br /><br />However, halfway down the alley she
<br /><br />noticed
<br /><br />a
<br /><br />man standing at the end as though he
<br /><br />were
<br /><br />waiting
<br /><br />for her.
<br /><br />She became uneasy and began to pray,
<br /><br />asking
<br /><br />for
<br /><br />God's protection.
<br /><br />Instantly a comforting feeling of quietness
<br /><br />and
<br /><br />security wrapped round her, she felt as
<br /><br />though
<br /><br />someone was walking with her.
<br /><br />When she reached the end of the alley,
<br /><br />she
<br /><br />walked right past the man and arrived
<br /><br />home
<br /><br />safely.
<br /><br />The following day, she read in the
<br /><br />newspaper
<br /><br />that
<br /><br />a young girl had been raped in the same
<br /><br />alley
<br /><br />just
<br /><br />twenty minutes after she had been there.
<br /><br />Feeling overwhelmed by this tragedy and
<br /><br />the
<br /><br />fact
<br /><br />that it could have been her, she began to
<br /><br />weep.
<br /><br />Thanking the Lord for her safety and to
<br /><br />help
<br /><br />this
<br /><br />young woman, she decided to go to the
<br /><br />police
<br /><br />station.
<br /><br />She felt she could recognize the man, so
<br /><br />she
<br /><br />told
<br /><br />them her story.
<br /><br />The police asked her if she would be
<br /><br />willing to
<br /><br />look
<br /><br />at a lineup to see if she could identify
<br /><br />him.
<br /><br />She agreed and immediately pointed out
<br /><br />the
<br /><br />man
<br /><br />she had seen in the alley the night
<br /><br />before.
<br /><br />When the man was told he had been
<br /><br />identified,
<br /><br />he
<br /><br />immediately broke down and confessed.
<br /><br />The officer thanked Diane for her bravery
<br /><br />and
<br /><br />asked if there was anything they could do
<br /><br />for
<br /><br />her.
<br /><br />She asked if they would ask the man one
<br /><br />question.
<br /><br />Diane was curious as to why he had not
<br /><br />attacked
<br /><br />her.
<br /><br />When the policeman asked him, he
<br /><br />answered, &quot;Because she wasn't alone.
<br /><br />She
<br /><br />had
<br /><br />two tall men walking on either side of
<br /><br />her.&quot;
<br /><br />Amazingly, whether you believe or not,
<br /><br />you're
<br /><br />never alone. Did you know that 98% of
<br /><br />teenagers
<br /><br />will not stand up for God?

<br />up
<br />to the top bunk.
<br />As you
<br />might expect things start to heat up.
<br /><br />The guy remembers that his little brother
<br />is
<br />sleeping below so he tells

<br />it
<br />harder and &quot;tomato&quot; if
<br />she
<br />wants a new position.
<br /><br />Lettuce!!!
<br /><br />Tomato!!!

<br /><br />Tomato!!!
<br /><br />Whoa!!!
<br /><br />PULL IT OUT!!!
<br /><br />PULL IT OUT NOW!!!

<br />why am i the one who holds back at first...but falls so hard when you tell me your lies?
<br />why do i always try to make things perfect...try to be perfect..because i feel that there is no one in the world more perfect than you?
<br />why do i feel like you deserve so much more... when i am the one that is trying so damn hard?
<br />why am i the person who makes all the arrangements... all the first steps towards any form of communication.... and then feels bad that i might be stealing you away from others?
<br />Why am i the one who starts out being afraid of how i feel.... and then once i embrace it...it all turns out to be false?
<br />why do i sit at home questioning whats happening..... when it is you that knows?
<br />why am i the one asking all the questions....... when the person that could answer them doesn't even care?
<br />why do i feel bad for pouring out my feelings.... just in case you read it and feel bad.... feel down on yourself... when i've felt bad about myself most of the night?
<br />Why am i the one who is afraid to hurt you...even though you find it so easy to hurt me..?
<br />why am i waiting for false promises...or actions to prove what you say... when if your words meant anything you would have already shown them?
<br />Why is it me who is left confused?
