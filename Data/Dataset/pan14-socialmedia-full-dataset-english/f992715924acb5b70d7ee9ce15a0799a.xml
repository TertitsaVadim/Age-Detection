Direct marketing will expand across Europe as it offers the opportunity to target and segment consumer groups.  Established US multinationals such as Readers' Digest and Xerox are successfully using a worldwide network, regional production bases, and national fulfillment points.  They use a single global positioning message and then tailor themselves to local markets.  The Franklin Mint uses nationals steeped in local culture to help distinguish differences in taste among European countries.  A database of 6 million names in Europe is used for targeting.  Some brands such as Sony and IBM are desired all over the world, but there is no agreement on standardizing features of products.  Financial services seem to be naturals for expansion in Europe through direct marketing.  Satellite television and interactive teleshopping are emerging direct marketing strategies.<br /><br />Full text: Marketing, Nov 3, 1988<br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.internetmarketingtoolshq.com%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.internetmarketingtoolshq.com/</a>

Whenever packaged goods companies have used direct marketing, they have relied on heavy saturation as a way of dropping coupons.  Despite the amount of business generated by coupons, their effect often is only transitory.  Packaged goods companies are seeking to develop brand commitment among consumers.  While print and broadcast advertising creates a positive image, it does not speak to consumers on a one-to-one basis.  To fill that void, many large packaged goods firms are looking to direct marketing.  For example, General Foods has designed the LightStyle Club, a direct mail club, for its Crystal Light product.  As packaged goods companies become more involved in direct marketing, they may look to outside databases to help develop new customers.  Retailers may be the greatest source for consumer information.<br /><br />Full text: Target Marketing, Oct 1988<br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.internetmarketingtoolshq.com%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.internetmarketingtoolshq.com/</a>

Print and electronic advertising are being fine tuned to sell affinity cards, card enhancements, special-event sponsorship, and premium cards.  National card issuers increased their radio, print, and television spending from $195 million in 1986 to $217 million in 1987.  Visa has focused on special-event marketing, helping sponsor such events as tennis matches and the Olympics.  Citicorp (New York City) is using television ads to promote a toll-free line number which can be used to provide emergency help to its cardholders.<br /><br />Full text: Credit Card Management, Jul 1988<br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.internetmarketingtoolshq.com%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.internetmarketingtoolshq.com/</a>

The use of such statements should be reduced but not eliminated because they often are needed.  When copywriters use unidentified authority statements, they are trying to have speculation masquerade as fact.  However, copywriters should not use unidentified authority statements if an identifiable authority or fact exists.  Nevertheless, when direct response writers must claim superiority without supporting evidence, an unidentified authority statement may be the best approach.  Any other use of the statement is an admission of creative defeat.  Writers should be careful to ensure that using the unidentified authority statement will not result in attributing an opinion or fact to the wrong source.<br /><br />Full text: Direct Marketing, Feb 1988<br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.internetmarketingtoolshq.com%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.internetmarketingtoolshq.com/</a>

Whereas both disciplines are similar in approach (objective, analytical, using similar design methods) the direct marketer is more of a tactician, while the market researcher provides needed illumination of data results.  Research can enable direct marketers to define target markets more accurately, suggest more successful ways for direct marketers to position new products, and improve upon pricing and packaging techniques.<br /><br />Full text: Bank Marketing, Nov 1987<br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.internetmarketingtoolshq.com%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.internetmarketingtoolshq.com/</a>
