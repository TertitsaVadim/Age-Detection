<br />The one thing I'm sure about,
<br /><br />Is how I feel about you in my heart,
<br />For several years we have been stout,
<br />Even when we have been apart.
<br /><br />Something happened or something changed,
<br />I gave you reason to turn away,
<br />Of this I'm sure that I must be deranged,
<br />To let the most beautiful flower turn and fray.
<br />Please give me just one more chance,
<br /><br />My heart is empty because we're apart,
<br />I have just one wish,
<br />That you take my heart,
<br />I know our love would be a swish.
<br /><br />I know that I have hurt you much,
<br />And hurt our love in such a way,
<br />A love that I thought none could touch,
<br />Yet I can't believe we can not stay.
<br /><br />We brought together two of the same parts,
<br />In such a very special way,
<br />As I remember the time we've spent sharing our hearts,
<br />It hurts so much this last time I replay.
<br /><br />I try to think of only the good time we played,
<br />Then I see the last bad day,
<br />My heart hurts so much when I see what we've made,
<br />We cant let our special love go - I say nay.
<br />Please give me just one more chance,
<br /><br />Rarely do two people find a soul mate,
<br />One to share everything with,
<br />The good and the bad are just some bait,
<br />It is the hard core essence which to most is a myth.
<br />Please give me just one more chance,
<br /><br />You are the love of my life my thoughts and my dreams,
<br />From morning to night,
<br />All I can think about is how good it seems,
<br />If you can find it in your heart to love me - it's right.
<br /><br />I lay awake all night lying in bed,
<br />Recanting all of the time we have been in love,
<br />So many things swim in my head,
<br />Yet all I can wish for is you, my perfect fit, my glove.
<br /><br />I have tears in my eyes,
<br />I want to lay down with my strife,
<br />I don't know how I can survive,
<br />Without you as the love of my life.
<br /><br />Please give me just one more chance,
<br />To prove to you how good our love can be,
<br />I feel so strongly I must take a stance,
<br />We were meant for each other - that is my plea.
<br /><br />Please here my cry and need for your heart,
<br />When we are together I am happy as can be,
<br />I can't stand to live another day apart,
<br />When we are so close and I am madly in love with you
<br />Please give me just one more chance,

<br /><br />Hi guys and grils
<br />This is a love story that u will never forget...
<br />He met her on a party. She was so outstanding, many guys chasing after her
<br />,
<br />while he was so normal, nobody paid attention to him. At the end of the
<br />party, he invited her to have coffee with him, she was surprised, but 
<br />due to
<br />being polite, she promised.
<br />They sat in a nice coffee shop, he was too nervous to say anything, she 
<br />felt
<br />uncomfortable, she thought, please, let me go home.. suddenly he asked 
<br />the
<br />waiter: &quot;would you please give me some salt? I'd like to put it in my
<br />coffee.&quot;
<br />Everybody stared at him, so strange! His face turned red, but, still, 
<br />he put
<br />the salt in his coffee and drank it. She asked him curiously: why you 
<br />have
<br />this hobby?
<br />He replied: &quot;when I was a little boy, I was living near the sea,
<br />I liked playing in the sea, I could feel the taste of the sea , just 
<br />like
<br />the taste of the salty coffee. Now every time I have the salty coffee, 
<br />I
<br />always think of my childhood, think of my hometown, I miss my hometown 
<br />so
<br />much, I miss my parents who are still living there&quot;. While saying that
<br />tears filled his eyes. She was deeply touched.
<br />That's his true feeling, from the bottom of his heart. A man who can 
<br />tell
<br />out his homesickness, he must be a man who loves home, cares about 
<br />home, has
<br />responsibility of home.. Then she also started to speak, spoke about 
<br />her
<br />faraway hometown, her childhood, her family. That was a really nice 
<br />talk,
<br />also a beautiful beginning of their story.
<br />They continued to date. She found that actually he was a man who meets 
<br />all
<br />her demands; he had tolerance, was kind hearted, warm, careful. He was 
<br />such
<br />a good person but she almost missed him! Thanks to his salty coffee! 
<br />Then
<br />the story was just like every beautiful love story, the princess 
<br />married to
<br />the prince, then they were living the happy life... And, every time she 
<br />made
<br />coffee for him, she put some salt in the coffee, as she knew that's the 
<br />way
<br />he liked it.
<br />After 40 years, he passed away, left her a letter which said: &quot;My 
<br />dearest,
<br />please forgive me, forgive my whole life lie. This was the only lie I 
<br />said
<br />to you---the salty coffee. Remember the first time we dated? I was so
<br />nervous at that time, actually I wanted some sugar, but I said salt It 
<br />was
<br />hard for me to change so I just went ahead. I never thought that could 
<br />be
<br />the start of our communication!
<br />I tried to tell you the truth many times in my life, but I was too 
<br />afraid to
<br />do that, as I have promised not to lie to you for anything.. Now I'm 
<br />dying,
<br />I afraid of nothing so I tell you the truth: I don't like the salty 
<br />coffee,
<br />what a strange bad taste.. But I have had the salty coffee for my whole
<br />life! Since I knew you, I never feel sorry for anything I do for you. 
<br />Having
<br />you with me is my biggest happiness for my whole life. If I can live 
<br />for the
<br />second time, still want to know you and have you for my whole life, 
<br />even
<br />though I have to drink the salty coffee again&quot;.
<br />Her tears made the letter totally wet.
<br />Someday, someone asked her: what's the taste of salty coffee?
<br />It's sweet. She replied.
<br />Pass this 2 everyone coz
<br />love is not 2 forget
<br />but 2 forgive
<br />not 2 c but understand
<br />not 2 hear but 2 listen
<br />not 2 let go but HOLD ON !!!!
<br />Love begins with a smile, grows with a kiss and ends with a tear.
<br />&quot;The glory of Success is in bouncing high every time you 
<br />hit the bottom!!&quot;
<br />“Love is not selfish so Love is not being happy it is to make happy whom you love even if you are unhappy with it.” </span></strong>

<br />When hope was high,
<br />And life worth living
<br />I dreamed that love would never die
<br />I dreamed that God would be forgiving.
<br /><br />Then I was young and unafraid
<br />When dreams were made and used,
<br />And wasted
<br />There was no ransom to be paid
<br />No song unsung,
<br />No wine untasted.
<br /><br />But the tigers come at night
<br />With their voices soft as thunder
<br />As they tear your hopes apart
<br />As they turn your dreams to shame.
<br /><br />And still I dream he'll come to me
<br />And we will live our lives together
<br />But there are dreams that cannot be
<br />And there are storms
<br />We cannot weather...
<br /><br />I had a dream my life would be

<br />So different now from what it seems
