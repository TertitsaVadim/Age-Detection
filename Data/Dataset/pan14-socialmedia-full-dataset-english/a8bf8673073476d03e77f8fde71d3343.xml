<br />thought id write in here again.. no real reason.. im just bored. i am absolutely wrecked at the moment, mostly coz of the things iv dun over yesterday and 2day. Yesterday, i had 2 get up rly early 2 go 2 swimmin trainin.(im sposed 2 do trainin 9 times a week coz im in the state squad). we did only 4km that morning, but when u add that to the 4km i did later that arvo, then that prty much stuffed me. today, i went down to the cricket nets with a mate and we stayed down ther in the 35 degree heat for like 3 hours, me goin prty much non stop bowling. thats all iv dun.. i know not much, but when uv dun nuthin 4 the last 2 months, small things get the better of u. 
<br />newayz, leave me comments and messages often, and hope 2 talk 2 yaz all soon
