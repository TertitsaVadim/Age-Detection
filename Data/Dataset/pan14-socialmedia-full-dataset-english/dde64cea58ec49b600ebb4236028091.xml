The wedding has gotton a great deal attention around the world because the illustrious family background and bridal reputation in the entertainment circle.
<br />As result that many celebrities including Carine Roitfeld, Franca Sozzani, Charlotte Olympia Dellal, Mario Testino, Suzy Menkes, Derek Blasbergn.Fabiola Beracasa and other public celebrities attended her special wedding.What the spotlight in this celebrity wedding is always the bridal wedding dresses. There is no disappointment to public that <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wZXJzdW5kcmVzc2VzLmNvbS93ZWRkaW5nLWRyZXNzZXMtYzg1L3NleHktbzN2MzUw" target="_blank">sexy wedding dress</a> designed by Giambattista Valli.are gorgeous and eye-catching.
<br /><br />Actually, she wore two version wedding gowns, one in white for the ceremony, and one in blush pink for the reception.The long-sleeved creations were made of Missoni silk and organza and embellished with embroideries and flower appliquÃ©s. She wore her hair up with a tiara and veil in the church, before letting it down and adding a floral headpiece for the celebrations, which took place in the grounds of her mother, Angela Missoni's, house.
<br /><br />Bridesmaids included Tatiana Santo Domingo, Eugenie Niarchos and Margherita's sister Teresa. In true free-spirited gypsy fashion, they did not wear matching dresses, but instead wore an array of bridesmaid dresses 2012 and skirts in pretty floral prints with headdresses made out of fresh flowers that matched Margherita's colorful bouquet.We can't help but missing Chyler Leigh's long brown locks, but at least the new 'do makes her appearance less like her Grey's Anatomy character Lexie Grey -- we can finally look at Chy without erratically bursting into tears.
<br /><br />Although we're attracted by that flawless glow she's rocking, we can't help but thinking of the pain Mark Sloan (Eric Dane) will go through when Season 9 returns. Then again, Chyler revealed to TV Guide last week, &quot;Will Mark go on? Absolutely, He'll move right along. That's just what Mark Sloan does. But initially I hope there will be a devastation.&quot;
<br /><br />After the date is set and the venue chosen, many brides begin the task of selecting dresses for the bridesmaids. Along with choosing shades that look good on the bridesmaids, the color of the bridesmaid dresses should complement the overall color scheme of the wedding and help to establish a wedding theme.
<br /><br />While purple or pink was traditionally color of bridesmaid dresses, more and more brides are selecting trendy black and white color for their bridesmaidsâEUR(TM) dresses. Black and white bridesmaid dresses tend to complement all skin tones, are flattering to the shapes and sizes of most women, and have a powerful slimming effect.

But warm weather means more than just fun in the sun; it means it’s time to think about changing your skin care and makeup regimen for the warmer months to come.
<br /><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/182343318_972035_49856673.jpg" />
<br />The best place to start looking for inspiration for your new style is the spring runways, which have featured very feminine and demure designs this year and paired those designs skillfully with soft, natural looks. Spring and summer makeup this year is going to be very subdued, with plenty of earthy blushes and natural flesh tones of shell, taupe and caramel. These colors paired with nude and cream colored lips and a modern matte finish create a very natural look that is flattering on almost every skin type. Remember to complement your style with a colorful and feminine <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wZXJzdW5kcmVzc2VzLmNvbS93ZWRkaW5nLWRyZXNzZXMtYzg1" target="_blank">wedding dresses 2012</a>.
<br /><br />If you are feeling particularly bold one warm sunny day there are plenty of more daring statements to be made as well. For example neons are back with bright orange and tangerine colors leading the way. This color is perfect on the lips if you have a darker complexion or can be used for truly dramatic effect around the eyes. But remember that you have to make a choice, go heavy on the neons in both places and you’re only a bad perm away from looking like you fell out of an 80’s movie!
<br /><br />As always good skincare is a must in summer, and don’t forget to protect yourself with a good SPF if you plan on being out in the sun for long periods of time. Whichever look you decide to go with remember to stay away from the heavier products when makeup shopping this spring, thicker products tend to have much more grease which will crease and melt in the heat, not to mention wreak havoc on your pores.
<br /><br />And always remember spring and summer are about youth and natural beauty, so let be sure to accent your best features and remember that sometimes in fashion less is more.
<br /><br />'Tis the season to experiment with pops of color — and we’re not talking about just your nails. So toss the dark shadows and be bold (literally) by playing up your eyes, cheeks, and lips. Try on these makeup ideas in our free Instant Makeup Makeover tool.

But it is a little pity that there is wrinkle on your beloved prom dress during long-distance delivery.
<br /><br />As we all know, prom dresses are generally made of materials, such as tencel, satin, lace and so on, that cannot be ironed or put in the dryer. So when the abnormal “ruching” is found in your chiffon or satin prom dresses, it would be embarrassed. This means that when these dresses become wrinkled, it can be difficult to remove the wrinkles at home.
<br /><br />The best way to get wrinkles of delicate prom dresses is to steam them. If taking the dress to a tailor or dry cleaner to be professionally steamed is out of the question, the dress can be steamed in the bathroom at home. This method won’t necessarily release set-in or deep wrinkles, but it will straighten out a dress that has been slightly crumpled.
<br /><br />Hang your prom dress on a plastic hanger and hook it onto the robe hook or high towel bar in the bathroom. Make sure the dress is not touching the ground. The skirt needs to hang freely to rid itself of wrinkles.
<br /><br />Start up the shower using only hot water. Make sure to close the curtain so that the steam can escape and fill the room, but the water won’t hit the dress. Shut the bathroom door and run the shower for about 5 minutes, or until the bathroom is steamy.
<br /><br />Shut off the shower. Keeping the bathroom door closed, allow the dress to hang in the steam-filled room for 20 to 30 minutes. The steam will loosen the wrinkles in the dress.
<br /><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/182343318_6555243_49938449.jpg" />
<br />Inspect the hanging dress, smoothing any areas that still appear wrinkled. Repeat the steam treatment, if necessary. Hang the wrinkle-free dress in a place where it won’t get crushed or drag on the ground, such as in a fairly empty closet or on the back of a door.
<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wZXJzdW5kcmVzc2VzLmNvbS9ob21lY29taW5nLWRyZXNzZXMtYzgxL2N1dGUtbzN2NDE3" target="_blank">Cute homecoming dresses</a> is not all about white.
