<br /><br />Francis Npong, Wa
<br /><br />Things have fallen apart within the North Ghana Mission of the Seventh-Day Adventists Church (SDA) as the indigenous members of the church from the three northern regions have threatened terrible action against the leadership if they failed within two weeks to remove the president of the North Ghana mission Mr. Adu Sampa. 
<br />The indigenous members who accused the leadership of Ghana Union Conference of SDA led by Dr. Samuel Adama Lamie of imposing a corrupt, and ungodly leader on them threaten to pull out or withdraw their membership if he and his cronies were not immediately removed from the mission. 
<br />“We are calling for a shake up in the North Ghana Mission to correct the rot in there. A new president should be appointed from the North to manage the affairs of the Mission, we believed that it is time we (Northerners) also be given the chance to manage our own affairs”, they demanded. 
<br /> In a petition signed by fifty-one (51) indigenous members of Seventh-Day Adventists Church (SDA) from the Upper West, Upper East and Northern Regions and addressed to the Secretary of Ghana Union Conference and copied to the Treasurer of the Union, legal team and all field presidents of Union in Ghana and seen by the Enquirer accused the president of the North Ghana Mission of the church, Pastor Adu Sampa of corrupt practices, conflict of interest, impropriety and demanded for his immediate removal from office. 
<br />The members alleged in a three page protest letter dated 27th September 2010 that their investigations on their spiritual head indicated that he was involved in American Visa Lottery game, dealer in cars and laptops and conducted his activities as a business man rather than a spiritual leaders and should be relieved of his post to enable him conduct his business well. 
<br />“The president travel to America every three months at the expense of the mission, uses the church funds to conduct his businesses, engaged in car and laptop dealing, he is indulged in conflict of interest”, they stated. 
<br />The contended that “the North Ghana Mission president Pastor Adu Sampa has come to the north to do business and not to serve the Lord. He has succeeded in turning North Ghana Mission into a “Business Empire” and has since been granting car loans from the mission’s coffers to some of his members. Ironically he (Asampa, the president) also served as car dealer and supplies cars to those he granted loans to which indicates conflict of interest”, the members pointed out. The members also accused the president for breaching the rule of engagement of church when he alleged to have single-handedly appointed un-ordained pastor one Mr. Badu Peter as acting Executive secretary after clandestinely asked the substantive executive secretary to process on leave raising unfounded financial impropriety against him.  
<br />Some of the elders in Bolga, and Wa who spoke to this reporter however observed that Mr. Adu Sampa was not a God fearing man and that his activities since taking office has caused more harm than good to the church in the regions and recommended his removal and be replaced by God fearing, selfless and dedication person. The sources also claimed the leadership of the Ghana Union Conference failed to act on the matter because some of them were benefiting from his activities as an America visa lottery specialist, car and laptop dealer. They also alleged he travels to America to visit his family every three month which is done at the expense of the mission. 
<br />The church the Enquirer sources indicated is in leadership crisis which has affected the membership derive saying the church is near collapse in the region if things are not addressed within a shortest possible time. The protest of the members follows the suspension of the executive secretary of the mission Pastor Philemon Nsor Aboungo who alleged raised red flag over profligate spending and misappropriation of church money meant for development projects by the top officials within the mission. This had provoked the president and his cohorts to raise untrue allegation of double claim of financial benefit for one of his sons.
<br />The suspension of the executive secretary was choreographed by the spiritual head of the mission Mr. Adu Sampa and the Treasurer Mr. Solomon Annan, and their cronies to cover up their criminal activities, the elders said. 
<br />The members in a protest letter are demanding for the re-instatement of the “suspended” executive sectary Pastor Philemon Nsor Aboungo, removal of some key personnel namely the president, treasurer and others from the mission and described the action of the leadership of church to the pastor and his family and northerners at large as unfair and unjustified treatment. 
<br />“Why will the people who preached love starve a colleague member and his family for whatever reason, why can’t he be forgiven for whatever wrongs? Elder quizzed. The members warned that if after two weeks their concern is not acted on or failure to do so would inform their next line of action that would have what they termed “terrible effects” on the church in Ghana. 
<br />Currently the Enquirer can report without fears that the leadership of the church which remained divided over the administration of the mission is locked up in a “cold war” and trading in accusations of witchcrafts and blaming recent car accident by some pastors of the mission on evil works another pastor (more soon that). “My brother, see while the executive secretary of the church was still at post the president appointed non ordained pastor Mr. Badu Peter to act as executive secretary when he was travelling to America for fear of being exposed of his profligate spending and unholy dealings in the church. There is a mafia working in the mission so anybody who opposes their actions particularly on how the mission money is spent the person automatically becomes an enemy. This is happening right here within the SDA church-the House God”, the source stressed.
<br />When the Enquirer reached Pastor Adu Sampa on phone, he confirmed to be assisting people to processing America Visa lottery insisting that the process was not dubious. He also indicated that he had released the outstanding salaries of the suspended secretary but refused to explain what led to the suspension of the secretary saying executive committee took the decision which was internal and could not be made public.
<br />He said he was ready to pack out of the region if the church says so but deneied allegations that he granted loans to his cronies. On the appointment of un-ordained pastor Mr. Badu Peter as acting executive secretary which contravened the rules of the church the president debunked claim that he took the decision alone and that if members of the church think his activities was causing more harm than good he was prepared to pack out of the region.
<br />But in what looked a like disgraceful happening in the house of God the president of Ghana Union Conference of SDA, Ghana Dr. Samuel Adama Lamie pleaded with the Enquirer to drop the story saying it was an internal issue and that his outfit is setting an investigative committee to look into the matter when reached on phone.
<br />He said publishing the story would break relationships among the members of the church and pleaded with this reporter drop it. He confirmed to the Enquirer the writers of the protest letter were genuine members of the church and that his administration would initiate investigations into the matter to bring back unity. Meanwhile the suspended executive secretary Pastor Philemon Nsor Aboungo refused to comment on the issue when contacted on phone. Stay tune as we bring to you current state of SDA church in northern regions, immorality among elders, who does what, when and where and with whom.

<br /><br />The Tamale Metropolitan Assembly has issued a strong warning to members of Non Governmental Organizations (NGOs) working within peri-urban communities in the metropolis to desist from partisan politics or be blacklisted or ban from operating in the area.
<br /><br />According to the authorities of the assembly, it has come to their notice that some members of Non Governmental Organizations operating within the Metropolis and parts of northern region were inciting community members against the government and her agencies. “Some owners of NGOs operating in the metropolis were influencing community members with their donor funding projects and inciting these community members against the government, this is unacceptable”, he said.
<br /><br />This he said was contrary to terms and conditions of non governmental organizations and that the assembly was on the look out for such scrupulous individuals to deal with them to deter others from doing same.
<br />Speaking to the Enquirer in an exclusive interview during a training workshop on water  and sanitation  held at Gilbert center here  the Tamale Metropolitan Coordinating Director  (MCD) Mr. John B. Atogiba who issued this warning on behalf of the assembly observed that the activities of some of these mushroom NGOs were frustrating the efforts of not only the assembly but also the government and her agencies at large.   
<br />He disclosed that the authorities of the assembly were on the look out for such scrupulous individuals or organizations who were making the government and her agencies unpopular within the peri-urban communities in Tamale metro, warning that any organization or individual caught would be blacklisted and ban from operating in the area aside prosecution.
<br /><br />He said most NGOs were going contrary to the lay down procedures of the assembly some which resulted in duplication of activities. The Director said that this however do not help in resource management and utilization and called for what he termed the “frame work or working plan” to avoid duplication of activities by the assembly and NGOs.
<br />Mr. Atogiba stressed that the assembly has taken steps to regularize the activities of NGOs to ensure coordination; cooperation and effective partnership that would help improve the livelihoods of the people.
<br />He advised members of NGOs to desist from inciting communities against the government or her agencies and rather concentrated on developing the communities to enhance their living conditions.
<br />Earlier Mr. Atogiba admonished Ghanaians to limit what he called “talk shops” and rather adopt implementable action plans kept in books shelf during workshops to help achieve the desire result in poverty reduction, disease control, provision of water and sanitation and development to the people.

<br /><br />The newly appointed Vice Chancellor for the University for Development Studies (UDS) Prof. Haruna Yakubu has promised to change the academic leadership of the University to help transform socio-economic conditions in Northern Ghana.
<br /><br />He said the establishment of a university should not only be to give higher education to people but also to contribute to the socio-economic transformation of people in order to enhance the living standards of the society.
<br /><br />The UDS he explained under his leadership would ensure total transformation of the northern economy through what he called practical oriented, community based problem solving programmes. He said the programmes would be gender sensitive and community interactive and would seek to integrate the university research findings to districts and community development plans.
<br /><br />Speaking during a press soiree organized by the university, the Vice chancellor said the university was a community problem solving institution and that under its Third Trimester Field Practical Programme (TTFPP), a community interface programme which is the combination of academic and field practical working experience, the university under his leadership would redefine the programme to include direct support communities and improve on their living standards.
<br /><br />The VC said the university would refocus on interdisciplinary research that promotes joint research projects with district assemblies and private industries to fulfill the mandate of the university as a community development oriented institution.
<br /><br />Prof. Yakubu indicated that the university would also create opportunities for more graduate students to enroll in masters and PHD degrees to help the institution make the desired impact in the community development processes.
<br /><br />The TTFPP programme initiated by the university covers a trimester in each academic year for three consecutive years and cuts across all faculties that ensure that students live and work closely in communities to identify, plan and formulate specific interventions to address specific challenges of each community in the region.
<br /><br />The University for Development Studies (UDS) which was established during the previous NDC government under the leadership of former president JJ Rawlings to give the people of the north opportunity to higher learning still faced infrastructural problems.
<br /><br />Since taken over power in 2000, the former president J.A. Kufour had never set his foot at the campuses of the university and had also failed woefully to release the seed money it promised the university.
<br />However the NDC government the Enquirer can report has taken steps to release the said seed money promise the university six years ago to them to enable the university to provide some lecture halls for students.
<br />This would end the frustrations the university authorities have been going through in attempts to claim or access the seed money promised them by the then NPP government.

<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL25wb25nMmZyYW5jby5ibG9nc3BvdC5jb20_" target="_blank">The Enquirer</a>  has been honored among other seven organizations, institutions and individuals by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for outstanding environmental reporting in the region during the 2010 Northern Regional World Environment Day celebration held at Duuyin a surburb of Tamale Metropolis.
<br />Reading the citation, the Northern Regional Director of EPA Mr. Abu Iddrisu said the Enquirer has been instrumental on environmental issues and has since published many environmental stories particularly those related to the Ghana Environmental Management Project (GEMP) aimed at reversing the desertification and drought in the region. The EPA Boss praised the Enquirer for what he called responsible environmental journalism and consistently reporting on environmental issues that affect livelihood in the region over the last three years. This he said however distinguished the paper from others  
<br />The publications he said had helped community sensitization and education on the environmental management and a wider population in the region. 
<br />This is the second award the Enquirer has received within the year in the region for the outstanding performances and accurate reportage on issues of the region. Other media organizations honored include Daily Graphic, Rural Media Network (RUMNET) publishers of Northern Advocate and Radio Justice and Duuyin and Zaazi communities in Tamale Metropolis and Savelugu/Nanton District, Tamale branch of Voluntary Workcamps Association, and individuals who played a crucial role in environmental issues in the region.
<br />According to environmental experts, about 35% of the total land mass of the country has already been swallowed by the advancing desert and the three northern regions, Upper East, West and Northern, which together constitute about 40% of the total land mass of the country are the worst affected area.
<br />Though desertification was arguably the first environmental issue to be recognized as taking place on global scale Africans countries has placed their focuses on physical infrastructural development to the detriment of environment which is now catching up with them. Land degradation, through sand wining, tree felling, bush burning and construction has turned the vegetation cover in Northern Ghana into waste and semi-desert land aggravating poverty, hunger and starvation, diseases, and youth migration, armed robbery among other social vices.
<br />It is against this background that the government of Ghana has initiated Ghana Environmental Management Project (GEMP) as part of efforts to reverse desertification and drought.
<br /> According to the Northern Regional Director of EPA Mr. Abu Iddrisu, the rampant and uncontrollable bush burning for the purpose of either farming or hunting has been a constant culture of the people in these parts of the country and this he pointed out had destroyed the limited organic matter suitable for crop production hence food scarcity, hunger and starvation and increased in poverty level among the people.
<br />The Director explained that GEMP currently being supported by the Canadian Government through the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) to the tune of 7.2 million dollars was not only to reverse desertification but also as climate adaptation and mitigation.
<br />The deputy Northern regional Minister Mr. San Nasamo Asabgi A sizeable number of trees are felt every day for the purposes of charcoal burning or firewood and construction works have also aided the speedy advance of desertification and deforestation in the north.
<br />The effects of desert encroachment in the Northern Ghana are alarming. Changes of rainfall patterns and climate in recent times have devastated the lands leaving several kilometers of scorched farmlands, leaner livestock, dried dams, and rivers ad impoverishing the population.

<br /><br />Twenty-three suspects have been arrested at Gushiegu and Kpatinga by the northern regional police patrol team in connection with the murder of three people including a sub-chief Gushiegu and Kpatinga during the 2008 elections.
<br />The suspects include six namely; Mohammed Alidu, 25; Abukari Alidu, 26; Sulemana Alidu, 30; Alhassan Mohammed, 26; Mohammed Imoro, 41, and Alidu Abdulai, 42 who were formerly arrested, charged but were subsequently released for lack of evidence.
<br />The suspects who are currently in custody of Tamale police would undergo thorough screening exercise and those found culpable are arraigned to stand trial.
<br />The Northern Regional Police Public Relations Officer (PRO) Chief Inspector Ebenezer Tetteh who confirmed this to the Enquirer said the suspects were picked up by police upon advice from the Attorney General Department.
<br /><br />He explained that the arrest was in connection with the 2008 disturbances that occurred in Gushiegu and Kpatinga in which three people were killed and several houses burnt and property destroyed valued thousands of Ghana cedis. According to the police officer, the suspects include six who were formerly arrested and charged by were subsequently released for lack of evidence that could lead to their prosecution.
<br />It could be remembered that six persons were arrested after the Gushiegu and Kpatinga clashes and flown to Accra on the orders of the former Interior Minister Mr. Kwame Addo Kufour.
<br />The suspects were subsequently released for lack of evidence, an action that sparked emotions among the people who blamed the former NPP administration for failure to prosecute the suspects because they were allegedly flirting with party which was then in power.
<br />The arrest which followed the Yendi dawn security swoop was part of efforts the NDC government’s efforts to find justice to the victims of Yendi and Gushiegu killing incidents.
<br />The violence at Gushiegu was a spill over from an earlier clash between supporters of the New Patriotic Party (NPP) and the National Democratic Congress (NDC) at Kpatinga, near Gushiegu, on August 31, 2008. 
<br />The NPP supporters were returning home after erecting a party shed, while their NDC NDC counterparts were also on their way home after attending a rally in the same locality clashed. The situation further degenerated into serious violent when the supporters of both parties met in Gushiegu township, leading to the mayhem that was visited on the town in the morning of Monday, September 1, 2008 in which three persons were officially reported killed, several properties destroyed, while a number of people sustained various degrees of injury in the ensuing violence. 
<br />However while members of the two political parties were still enjoying their field days the victims of the violence were left to fence their odds alone while the suspects were still walking freely in the area.

<br /><br />The Northern Regional Minister Mr. Moses Bukari Mabengba has stated that the NDC government was still committed to implementation of social interventions under the social democratic principles that seek to improve lives.
<br />He said the NDC government which has citizens at heart would continue to develop and implement what he called “pro-poor” and social interventions to improve the well being of the people.
<br />The Minister said this when he visited National Health Insurance Scheme mass registration centers in Tamale.
<br />The visit was to encourage people to patronize the scheme and create awareness on the important of NHIS to people particularly pregnant women, children and aged in society.
<br />The minister who dispelled notions that the NDC government was not interested in the implementation of NHIS said the NDC in 2001 piloted 68 health schemes in the country.
<br />The minister reassured Ghanaians that the government of the NDC was not only continuing the implementation of the scheme but would perfect its implementation process. According to the minister aside onetime premium that takes effect next year, the NDC government was also reducing the waiting period for card issuance from six months to one month to enable people benefit from the scheme to improve on their health.
<br />The minister further stressed that NHIS was the brainchild of NDC and that the NPP inherited the scheme when they lost power in 2001and could not have initiated it.
<br />“The NHIS is part of our social interventions that is why it was introduced by the party in 2001 to give many Ghanaians opportunity to improve their health”, he said.
<br />Mr. Mabengba who was accompanied by some officials of the scheme encouraged people to take advantage of the scheme to improve on their health conditions. He also admonished Ghanaians to ignored perceptions that the NDC government would stop implementing NHIS saying they were coming to perfect the operations of the scheme to benefit as many as ordinary Ghanaian.
<br />He also urged people to stop politicizing with the scheme to encourage people to register with it to enjoy the benefits attach to the NHIS. The Deputy Director of operations of the NHIS Mr. Anthony Gingong, explained to journalists that the mass registration exercise was part of their initiative to reach more Ghanaians who would otherwise not have time to visit their offices to register with the scheme. He said the NHIS was taking it services to the doorsteps of the people to ensure a sizable number of Ghanaians register with the scheme.
<br />The Director also explained that exercise was designed to ensure that more people registered for the NHIS to enable them access quality health care at affordable cost.
<br />He said it was also to fast track the registration of people. Mr. Gingong said the NHIS as at now was not indebted to any service provider.

<br /><br />The Members of the Parliamentary Committee on Employment, Social Welfare and State Enterprises are under fire for snubbing some communities affected by flood in Central Gonja District of the Northern Region.
<br />The Committee led by Mr. Prince Hayibor, Chairman of the Parliamentary Committee on Employment, Social Welfare and State Enterprises and the ranking member of the Committee, Mrs. Akosua Frema Opare were in a four-day official working visit to areas under the Savannah Accelerated Development Authority (SADA) and affected by recent floods to solicit first hand information and assess the impact of flood situation on their lives.
<br />Speaking in an exclusive interview with the Enquirer some community members who castigated the MPs expressed their disappointment in the law makers saying “they were already not prepared for the visit looking at the way some of them were even dressed”. 
<br />The MPs came under criticism when they declined to sail in canoes brought by community members to move them into communities under water to assess the impact of the flood on the lives of these poor and vulnerable people.
<br /><br />“Though we were happy to meet them but we are wondering what information they will put across on our behalf since they refused to sit in the canoes to be taken to communities actually affected by floods. They declined to go with us claiming we did not have live jackets so it was risky for them”, they said.
<br />This, the members said was an insult to them and that the MPs were not there because of them but probably their own advantage.
<br /><br />These members who were unhappy expressed their disappointment on the MPs for what they called the deliberate refusal to sail with them, to experience for themselves their plights to prompt them to take immediate action.
<br />“We mobilized canoes to carry them to we are current living but upon reaching shore the MPs declined to go with them though they came because of our condition.
<br /><br />The Enquirer can report without fears or favours that the MPs who were supposed to sail to the communities under water declined to so grounds that the canoes brought by the community members to carry them across were without life jackets.
<br /><br />“One of the MPs, were in high heels with her beautiful ladies’ bag and nice clothing, was, as expected, not ready to get dirty not to talk of sitting in a wooden canoe or get closer to the water banks” a member bemoaned.
<br /><br />The MPs, were supposed to travel in boats to visit a community in the Central Gonja district which had been inundated by flood waters from the White Volta to as they put it assess the impact of perennial floods on the lives of the people in the area declined when they saw the water for fears of drowning.
<br /><br />This visit would have enabled them to see for themselves, the destruction caused by the floods to be well informed about the plights of the people to make proper recommendations.
<br /><br />However, some of the MPs resisted the use of the boats and said there were no life jackets to guarantee their safety, the paper can report.
<br />Some community members, who spoke to the Enquirer, said they could not fathom why the MPs undertook such a tour without adequate preparation.
<br /><br />the MPs were supposed to collect information on floods impact to communities to provide ideas for tackling development challenges to SADA achieve the needed political consensus to help transform northern region.

<br /><br />These members who were unhappy expressed their disappointment on the MPs for what they called the deliberate refusal to sail with them, to experience for themselves their plights to prompt them to take immediate action.
<br />“We mobilized canoes to carry them to we are current living but upon reaching shore the MPs declined to go with them though they came because of our condition.
<br /><br />The Enquirer can report without fears or favours that the MPs who were supposed to sail to the communities under water declined to so grounds that the canoes brought by the community members to carry them across were without life jackets.
<br /><br />“One of the MPs, were in high heels with her beautiful ladies’ bag and nice clothing, was, as expected, not ready to get dirty not to talk of sitting in a wooden canoe or get closer to the water banks” a member bemoaned.
<br /><br />The MPs, were supposed to travel in boats to visit a community in the Central Gonja district which had been inundated by flood waters from the White Volta to as they put it assess the impact of perennial floods on the lives of the people in the area declined when they saw the water for fears of drowning.
<br /><br />This visit would have enabled them to see for themselves, the destruction caused by the floods to be well informed about the plights of the people to make proper recommendations.
<br /><br />However, some of the MPs resisted the use of the boats and said there were no life jackets to guarantee their safety, the paper can report.
<br />Some community members, who spoke to the Enquirer, said they could not fathom why the MPs undertook such a tour without adequate preparation.
<br /><br />the MPs were supposed to collect information on floods impact to communities to provide ideas for tackling development challenges to SADA achieve the needed political consensus to help transform northern region.

<br /><br />“Education they say is key to success” but the pupils in the Gulinkpegu primary school in the Mion Constituency under the Yendi Municipality would have this dream dashed because of the failure of the Yendi Municipal Assembly to provide them with decent classroom block after a rainstorm has destroyed the classroom block four (4) years ago.This however compelled the children to have their classes under trees after several appeals to the Assembly to quickly rush to rescue these children failed. Currently, about 200 school pupils in Kulinpkpegu primary sit under trees to learn, a situation according to community opinion leaders impedes quality teaching and learning.
<br />“Since the school was destroyed four years ago, authorities in the Yendi Municipality remained silence and unconcerned as children attend school under trees and were exposed to an open environment that obstruct effective teaching and learning”, community members asserted. The situation they said also encouraged child delinquency and absenteeism among children in the community which deprive them their rights to quality, affordable education.
<br />The educational condition if not corrected would have negative repercussion on the children as they grow older.The blackboards of the school are currently nailed on trees, high that pupils could not practice practical writing on the board during normal classes’ hours. Some of the children too did not have school uniforms, while others walk in bear foot and wore tattered clothes to school. The classes often end abruptly when there is rain, heavy wind or scorched sun because trees do not provide enough cover for the children’s safety against these natural phenomena. With dusty “classrooms” the pupils look dirty and un-admirable and sympathetic to say the least. 
<br /><br />Speaking to the Enquirer in an interview opinion leaders in Gulinkpegu community complained bitterly of neglect and that their appeal to the assembly for support has not yielded any result.
<br /><br />The condition at Bulinkpegu community does not depict the NDC government led by Prof. Atta Mills’s educational policy to end “school-under-trees” phenomenon.  
<br />The Chairman of the Parent Teacher Association (PTA) of the school Mr. Mohammed Iddi said for almost four years now the children have been learning under trees. He said the performance of the pupils have reduced drastically since the destruction took place. He however made a passionate appeal to the government, NGOs to come to their aid adding that the government, NGOs and philanthropists are now their last hope to rescue their children from hash weather to enhance academic work in the school.
<br />The Yendi Municipal Coordinating Director (DCD) Alhaji Shehu Abdul-Kadiri when reached on phone disclosed that about four basic schools in the Yendi Municipality were in deplorable conditions. He said under the GETfund assistance a 6-unit classroom block has been awarded on contract to address the situation at Gulinkpegu.
<br />The Member of Parliament (MP) for Mion Constituency Dr. Alhassan Ahmed Yakubu told this reporter during interaction in Tamale that he was concerned about the situation. He was happy that GETfund had come to the aid of the constituency adding that GETfund is constructing 6-unit classroom block in Gulinkpegu, 3-unit classroom block at Zakpalsi and hope that GETfund would also take onboard Nagbale primary school which is in deplorable condition and needed a complete new block. This he said would solve the under trees schooling that exposed children to an open environment that obstruct effective teaching and learning. The contractor the DCD could not named is said to have took the contract but failed to report to site claiming that the area which is fairly accessible was not motorable, the Enquirer has learnt. However upon hearing that a Journalist was tracing the contract deal relating to Gulinkpegu primary the contractor quickly resurfaced and took one trip of sea sand to the site though he earlier claimed the area was not accessible.

According to the Coordinator, the lack of rural banks particularly in northern region was impeding the progress of NRGP and other government agricultural initiatives aimed to empower local farmers and therefore called on MMDAs in the region to make frantic efforts to facilitate the establishment of rural banks in each district to help empower farmers to increase crop production. Mr. Ayariga made the called when he briefed the Enquirer on the progress of NRGP since its inception two years ago. “Unlike Upper East where almost every district has a rural bank supporting farmers, with exception of only two districts there are no rural banks in northern region and this is hindering the progress of NRGP”, he said. The Coordinator also appealed to the national banks not to shy away from financing agricultural activities which he said is the backbone of the economy of this country.  Northern Rural Growth Programme (NRGP),is a $104-million agricultural support project funded by the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), African Development Bank (AD<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/4210//smilies/cool.gif" alt=":)" /> and the Government of Ghana and aimed to reduce poverty among farmers in the three northern regions.

<br />The women who are constantly being threaten of deaths by community members are also being accused of earmarking another eight other young people to kill. One of three young men suffering from the alleged spiritual attack died, leaving two others one with a bloated stomach and other with choked oesophagus or neck vain who is unable to gulp anything in a critical conditions, they explained.
<br />The women, whose names have been withheld, are now under hostage have been dragged to Dakpema palace Naa Mohammed Dawuni. The palace source who confirmed the story said the women have been billed to appear before a fetish priest to determine whether or not they have hand in the plights of these young guys.
<br />The Enquirer sources within the community indicated that though the alleged victims were not sent to the hospital to verify the kind of sicknesses they were suffering from rather vet their frustrations on the five old women.
<br /> “They are forcing them to admit that they really have hands in the cases of the guys which is unfortunate”, the source said. The women, are likely to be banished from the community should the fetish priest of the proposed shrine they are threatening to take them to found them guilty aside horrible maltreatment.
<br />The entire drama began last week when two close friends fell almost at the same period in which one has already died. A third person, who identity is also yet to be revealed, has also fallen ill
<br />and has been unable to take in any food or water. On Tuesday, when the youth could no more tolerate the situation, they massed
<br />up and marched to the palace of the Dakpema, a traditional leader in Tamale,
<br />to protest against the strange calamity that had struck the youth of their
<br />community, according to Graphic report.

<br />some action to intervene and halt this strange phenomenon, claiming that any
<br />of them could be the next victim.

<br /><br />The Assembly women aspirants in culturally-torn or segregated society particularly in northern region where women play “shadow role” or neglected and deny opportunity to take part in decision making process and in development are being prepared to face a unique challenges during the upcoming district assemblies’ elections as they face their male counterparts.
<br />With funding support from European Union (EU), under the “Support for Women in Elections, (SWOPE)”, Ghana Developing Communities Association (GDCA), a gender and development sensitive Non-governmental organization has organized ground-breaking community platforms for some women aspirants in the Yendi Municipality not only to disabuse community minds about women in leadership but also to showcase their talents and achievements. The assembly women aspirants in the region are faced with various challenges including financial, socio-cultural and transportation difficulties that impede the campaign activities. 
<br />Speaking to the Enquirer in an interview after a durbar of chiefs and people of Gulinkpegu Electoral Area in the Mion Constituency, the field officer of GDCA-SWOPE programme Madam Alhassan Faidatu pointed out that women face unique socio-cultural challenges that prevent them from taking part in decision making processes in society. Women she said are spite in male dominated society of the region, a situation that needs a lot of time, energy, and resource to correct to pave way for women with leadership potentials to vie for both local and national leadership positions.  
<br />“Socio-cultural factors particularly in northern region put off women potentials because women are not allowed to practice their ideas gear towards transformation of society. They are barred by socio-cultural norms to take up leadership positions or to participate development programmes. This however affected physical and spiritual development of women in north Ghana”, she stressed.
<br />Madam Faidatu indicated that women are good and influential leaders and could support the development of the nation when given the chance to participate in decision making processes at local and national levels. The discrimination, marginalization and exclusion of women in local and national platforms were partly responsible for the lack of development in the country, she argued. She said it was against this background that GDCA in collaboration with SWOPE is supporting the course of women and advocating for increase number of assembly women for equal representation of gender in decision making processes saying the disparities in leadership in Ghana was too wide and needed to be closed.
<br />The Yendi Municipal Director of National Commission for Civic Education (NCCE) Alhaji Alhassan Sulemana appealed to chiefs and people to desist from criminalizing and attacking women who aspire for a position. He observed that the situation was not encouraging girl child education and women development. He however urged community members to support women to aspire higher position because women were sensitive to development and would be able to move the development of the community forwards when given the chance. The Assembly woman aspirant for Gulinkpegu Electoral Area Ms Adam Habiba who complained of physical and verbal attacks and various accusations that put fears in them promised to champion.
<br />She pleaded with community leaders to ensure a fair play ground for all aspirants including women to the forthcoming district assemblies’ elections. She said the constant intimidation, harassment and physical and verbal attacks from her male counterparts do not promote democracy where respect, responsibility, accountability and community interest is key.
<br />She thanked GDCA for the support and urged her colleagues women not to be deterred by the threats and accusations to declare their interest in the forthcoming district assemblies elections.

<br />As climate change continued sweeping through continents and impoverishing livelihoods, some multi-nationals companies whose medus operandi is profit-making are busily destroying the African’s vegetation with pretext of large scale farming which is done at the peril of the people.
<br />Such multi-nationals companies in Ghana are Biofuel Africa and Tamale Integrated Fruits companies (ITFC). The two companies had taken due advantage of the poverty situation in Northern and Volta Regions of Ghana to destroy large truck of farmlands including medicinal and economic trees that had for a long period now supported local economy and livelihoods.
<br />Though the government of Ghana was aware of the negative activities of these companies she continues to support them in securing large truck of farmlands for the cultivation of cash crops which replaces food crops, worsening food situation in Ghana. 
<br />While these companies continue to exploit Africa countries to enrich their various economies, they also supported food crops productions in their countries to feed the nation.
<br />Realizing the negative impact the activities of these companies have on their livelihoods, the chief and people of Kusawgu in the Central Gonja District of the Northern region have rejected proposal by Biofuel Africa to establish a 33, 000 hectare jatropha plantation in the area.
<br />The communities after losing 260 hectares of their farmlands and important economic trees to the company rejected plans by the company to further clear 32,740 hectares of land to make up the proposed 33, 000 hectares to establish jatropha plantation to the detriment of food crops.
<br />The activities of Biofuel Africa and Tamale Integrated Fruits companies (ITFC) are said to be putting at risk the livelihoods of the rural folks and needs to be regulated.
<br />A painstaking investigations conducted by the Enquirer into the activities of Biofuel Africa and Tamale Integrated Fruits companies (ITFC) in northern region has discovered the hush-hush manner these companies were grabbing farmlands from local farmers with unfavourable terms of contracts.
<br />The companies have individuals including top government officials who influence chiefs and landowners who could not read and write into thump printing unfavourable terms of agreement or contracts’.
<br />It was alleged that at the time the Biofuel cleared the 260 hectares of land at Kusawgu the company was not having planning permit from the Central Gonja District Assembly nor Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 
<br />It was learnt at the Kusawgu chief palace by the Enquirer that top officials of the Biofuel Africa, in the company of their lawyer and court interpreter whose names were not available approached the chief with a document which title was not clear and asked him to thumbprint it without briefing him what the document entails but he declined and demanded the full involvement of the whole community and other stakeholders.     
<br />The paper also discovered that the same Biofuel Africa had acquired 1,000 hectares of land at Kpacha a community near Tamale and had already cleared 389 hectares and planted jatropha plants depriving the community of farmland to plant food crops while economic trees such as dawadawa and shear trees have been cut down.
<br />The activities of Biofuel Africa are said to be depriving communities of their livelihoods and needs to be regulated. The same can be said of ITFC which operates at Savelugu and its environs which had destroyed thousands of farmland to establish mango plantation. The company had persuaded local farmers who used their farmlands to cultivate mango plantations with logistical support from the company. In this situation the company had put it interest top of its activities discouraging crop cultivation. The company hoped to achieve its target of mass fruits cultivation in ten years.
<br />Some communities’ members who spoke to this reporter called on the government to stop the multinational companies from taking over their farmlands leaving nothing but pieces of infertile lands that do not support the growth of food crops. The northern regional Director of EPA Mr. Iddrisu Abu confirmed that his outfit have stopped the Biofuel Africa from further clearing land at Kusawgu because the company had entered the area illegal.

He said nursery attendants and volunteers have also been given training to manage the nurseries and to help create awareness on environmental issues at their respective communities. Mr. Iddrisu said plans are advanced to reduce or stop indiscriminate bush burning, tree felling in the region for the successful implementation of GEMP.

<br />Ghana stands the chance of becoming energy hub in the gulf of Guinea if comprehensive strategies and policies are formulated to safeguard oil and gas exploitation. The Executive Director of Integrated Social Development Centre (ISODEC), Bishop Akologo who said this in an interview with the Enquirer in Tamale said the local content policies on oil and gas are urgently needed to ensure effective local participation in oil and gas exploration.
<br />This, he said would give Ghanaians fair representation oil deal including exploration and marketing.
<br /> Mr. Akologo who led a day’s regional consultative forum on oil and gas organised by ISODEC in collaboration with Ghana Developing Communities Association (GDCA) held in Tamale said with the oil find, Ghana is in threshold to be an energy hub in the whole of the Gulf of Guinea. The country he observed is also likely to achieve middle income status by 2015 if the proceeds of the oil and gas are properly utilized to benefit Ghanaians.
<br />The forum was part of series of consultative oil and gas fora aimed to collate views and opinions from Ghanaian nationals to help formulate oil and gas policies and programmes that would allow Ghanaians to own and benefit the chunk of oil proceeds.
<br /> It was also to seek views on how to formulate oil policies that would take onboard Ghanaians in all sectors of exploration and marketing, training and technology transfer.
<br />Mr. Akologo explained that it is only when the local participation is effective that Ghana stands the chance of benefiting from the oil and gas extraction and that there was the need to protect the interest of Ghanaians through stringent oil and gas, and environmental laws and local ownership.
<br />Mr. Akologo said until the government provides an enabling environment and opportunities for Ghanaians to benefit from the economic wealth that emanates from the activities in the oil and gas industry through participation and ownership, operations and control and management, the country’s fortunes would not be improved as expected.
<br />He warned the leadership of the country against mismanagement and misappropriation of the proceeds of oil and gas saying failure of the government to provide opportunities for the citizens would provoke them to take the laws into their hands as happened in other countries.
<br />“There is the need for fair and equal distribution of oil wealth among the citizens and failure to do so will provoke the people who will found other means of getting what they expected or wanted”, he said.
<br />According to him, Ghana could achieve the middle income status pretty soon if policies and programmes on oil and gas are strengthened. He also suggested the formulation of policies and programmes which could be integrated into the school curricula to help build strong and quality human resources for oil sector. This, he said would help boost the local economy and improve living conditions of the people. Mr. Akologo urged the government to go back to the drawing board and adopt policies that would enable training of economists, and technocrats to help push the nation forwards.
<br />The national coordinator of Civil Society on oil and gas, Mr. Mohammed Amin Adam expressed his reservation on the draft policy framework on Ghana petroleum revenue management saying the policy has vested more powers to the minister of finance and is likely to be abused. He suggested the constitution of independent body to manage the revenue to avoid the system where the money is given to party cronies. The participants who were drawn from civil society organisations from Upper East, West and Northern region feared the oil and gas exploration might spark social unrest in Ghana and should be managed with care.

<br />In their quest to facilitate development in their communities the chiefs and opinion leaders in Lamakra and Wurishegu in the Tamale metropolis have embraced women aspiring assembly member positions.
<br />They were of the view that they have completely lost trust in men leadership who after voting them into power do not concentrate in communities development but rather join political wagon to insult and attack opponents to the detriment of the communities.
<br />According to them, men over the years failed to influence development projects to benefit their communities and that they were now seeking alternative leadership through women to influence some form of development into their communities.
<br />The acceptance of Muslim women to lead role or assume leadership positions in Muslim dominated communities in Tamale came at the time Muslim women in Ghana called on their male counterparts to allow them to decide when and who to marry and not bamboozled with religious laws or culture to marry at early ages. 
<br />“We have been voting for men over the years now but there has not been any changed in development. We do not have trust in men as leaders again, it looks like men are greedy, incapable so we will like to tried a woman this time round”, an opinion leaders told the Enquirer in an interview at Wurishegu.

<br />The programme she stressed was not only to introduce women aspirants into the community members but was also to showcase their potentials in leadership. “we are targeting 30% increase of women in district assemblies, GDCA-SWOPE is working harder to ensure that the target is achieved during December assemblies elections”, she said.
<br />The Director in charge of public education at the National Commission on Civic Education (NCCE) Mr. MacMathew Chancellor appealed to people to support women aspiring leadership positions adding that this would however encourage the girl child education.

They are Dr. Kwame Nkrumah, Mr. Obetsebi_lamptey, Mr. Ako Adjei, Mr. Edward Akuffo-Addo, Dr. J.B. Danquah and Mr. William Ofori Atta.
<br /> These were the brave men and leaders of the United Gold Coast Convention (U.G.C.C.) who were arrested and detained under the Emergency Regulation in 1948 during disturbances in the Gold Coast. These are gallant men, who spearheaded the transition of Ghana from colonialism to Independence on that memorable day the 6th of March, 1957.
<br />Their story is that of flabbergasting and painful. They were selflessly dedicated to the service of mankind, the warriors of black liberty and freedom-History.
<br />It was a happy day and will go down into the Guinness Book of Records, no history of my ownself having met with these men and taking picture with them in Tamale. These men were part of many dedicated Ghanaians who thronged to Tamale to take part in the opening ceremony of the National Festival of Arts and Culture (NAFAC 2010). 
<br />What was the driving force that led them to fight for Ghana’s independence prematurely? The first question I posed to them as they stood under a dawadawa tree brainstorming issues of the nation and probably remembering each other on that painful day-the day they were thrown into dark cells by the long pointed nose man. They were charged with causing people to riot and disturbance under Emergence Regulation in 1948. That was long, long time ago hmm.
<br />But they could still remember every bite of what happened as they raced me from various meetings, petitions, telegrams they have sent to the foreigner power at the time. They came into the country with wine, the bible, the gun with intention to steal and rob. Yes, they succeeded. Our gold is stolen away, the cocoa farmers deeply exploited, stolen our workforce through slave trade and left the blacks nothing but poverty, hatred, weapons to kill, messed up the social set up of the people crashing their heads together (sorry not about Abudus and Andanis over Yendi Chieftaincy dispute).
<br /> “If we could still rule or take leadership positions, we would have decided to either give back the country to the colonial masters or abolished politics and reformed the chieftaincy institution to take charge of the helm of the nation’s affairs.
<br />Eeeh! What an old thinking, “Toufiakwa” I will not allow myself to be ruled by any foreign power-not anymore of the blacks race! I exclaimed.
<br />Eeh young man! It would be far better to seek alternative leadership than to allow own criminals to ruin the nation. See engineers, agriculturists, home science students, doctors and nurses (Not Dr, Frimpong) have all abandoned their professions and jumped into politics were their expertise is not needed?
<br />They are there looting and stealing, breaking society and impoverishing the people, the system, my son is now worser than our days. Yes it true oo my Friend Dawuni not Mohammen Nurudeen Salifu who recently completed agric engineering and jumped into politics now ride a flashy car (4 wheel drive) but I am still trotting on the ground and rely heavily on tax services for my movement.
<br />If agric engineers vacated their positions, if doctors left OPDs the country would have to rely on foreign expertise to grow food, or Cuba doctors to treat our ill people-what is more of this- direct rule because the foreigners control key sectors of our econmy.
<br />The Ghana they told me is moving from bad to worse and would need total reforms, transformation and frameworks to get the black back to the spot the big were dreaming of.
