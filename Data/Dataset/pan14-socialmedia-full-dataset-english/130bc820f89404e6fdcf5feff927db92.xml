Trout are much smarter than many people believe, and catching them isn't as easy as many are led to believe. Trout are very suspicious of bait, and they won't take it if a variety of factors aren't in place. The type of bait you use, your positioning, and even the scent from your hands can determine whether you catch the big one or not. That's a major reason why the difference between average anglers and great ones is so small. With further ado, here are the top 10 best trout fishing tips.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;1. Go lightweight.&lt;/b&gt;<br /><br />The first item on our list of 10 trout fishing tips, and one of the most important, is to use lightweight tackle. This includes a rod, fishing line, and hooks. If your tackle is visible to trout, they won't bite. Lightweight fishing line is particularly important because you need to find line that is lightweight enough to be invisible to trout, yet strong enough to reel them in. Between 2 and 6 pound test is recommended. Similarly, if trout can see a hook, they won't be interested in grabbing your bait. Hooks around size 10 are usually suitable for most types of trout.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;2. Wear dull clothing.&lt;/b&gt;<br /><br />Camouflage is a great choice of fishing clothing because it makes it easy to blend in with your surroundings. While some fish don't notice what's going on above water, trout do. They will notice you if you are wearing bright clothing, and they won't bite.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;3. Go natural.&lt;/b&gt;<br /><br />Your bait should be naturally presented. This means PowerBait is generally out, but worms and minnows are in. You should also present your bait as naturally as possible with a gang hook. This type of hook is disguised and will make the bait look like a floating treat for trout.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;4. Rub dirt on your hands.&lt;/b&gt;<br /><br />If you don't think smell is important to trout, you're simply wrong. Trout won't bite an item that has an artificial smell. By rubbing dirt on your hands prior to touching any bait, you can get rid of scents that trout find unattractive.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;5. Don't grease the leader.&lt;/b&gt;<br /><br />When <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy50cm91dGZpc2hpbmdyZXZpZXcuY29tLw__" target="_blank">trout fishing</a>, don't grease the leader. It won't sink far enough to cause problems when picking the line and lure. However, if it is allowed the float, it could create a shadow that will spook the trout.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;6. Make the first cast a great one.&lt;/b&gt;<br /><br />Your first cast should be in shallow water, preferably near a boulder or fallen tree. Trout love these areas, and they are particularly likely to jump on new bait here. You can secure a quick catch by picking the right spot and working your way upstream.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;7. Get near the bottom.&lt;/b&gt;<br /><br />Trout tend to swim near the bottom of rivers and streams, so be sure to present your bait in this area. A natural bait that appears to bob up and down from the ground is most attractive to trout.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;8. Carry bait bags.&lt;/b&gt;<br /><br />By having your bait ready to be cast, you can maximize time in the water. Trout will still bite on bait that has been in the water, so the easiest way to catch one is to make sure your bait isn't on land too often. Bait bags can increase fishing efficiency.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;9. Fish early.&lt;/b&gt;<br /><br />Trout are hungriest and most likely to bite in the morning. You will be more likely to catch one prior to 10 a.m. than any other time.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;10. Get your license.&lt;/b&gt;<br /><br />Fishing without a license is illegal and could lead to a huge fine. It's worth it to plunk down the cash and fish for trout legally.

Fishing for trout might seem pretty straightforward, but there are a variety of things you can do to greatly enhance your chances of bringing in the big one. Read on for the 10 best trout fishing tips.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;1. Don't make noise.&lt;/b&gt;<br /><br />Trout are very smart and they know a lot about what is going on above water. If you are fishing in an area that has been fished before, the trout will be very suspicious of all bait. If they hear you moving around or yelling above water, they won't bite.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;2. Don't cast a shadow.&lt;/b&gt;<br /><br />This might seem like a small tip, but it's really one of the most important of these 10 <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy50cm91dGZpc2hpbmdyZXZpZXcuY29tLw__" target="_blank">trout fishing</a> tips. If possible, choose a spot where the sun is in front of you so you don't cast a shadow over the water. If trout see your shadow, they won't take the bait.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;3. Blend in.&lt;/b&gt;<br /><br />Wear brown, green, and other natural colors to make sure the trout do not see you from underwater. Camo is always a good choice.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;4. Fish with the current.&lt;/b&gt;<br /><br />Trout are smart and won't hit on bait that looks dead. To maximize your chances of bringing one in, make sure you fish upstream. This will allow your bait to slowly move toward you, giving the appearance it is alive. If you fish downstream, the bait will stay in one general area, and the trout will be less likely to bite.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;5. Use natural bait.&lt;/b&gt;<br /><br />In addition to making your bait look natural underwater, you also want it to simply be natural. Trout love worms and minnows, so these make great choices for bait. Stay away from Powerbait and other artificial bait types if possible.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;6. Use small lures if necessary.&lt;/b&gt;<br /><br />At times, lures are acceptable in place of natural bait. Specifically, lures can work in areas where trout are inactive. Lures provide natural movement to bait, so they can attract trout that are less than thrilled to bite. When fishing with a lure, make sure it is small.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;7. Rub dirt on your hands.&lt;/b&gt;<br /><br />Trout have an awesome sense of smell, so be sure to rid your hands of scents. When you get to the fishing spot, rub dirt on your hands. If you transfer the smell of your hands to the bait, trout will smell it and probably won't bite. This tip is particularly true for smokers or those who chew tobacco. The smell of tobacco is strong and drives trout away.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;8. Use light tackle.&lt;/b&gt;<br /><br />Trout can see hooks and lines rather easily, and they will get spooked if they notice them. Be sure to use small hooks and lightweight fishing line. Anything between 2-6 pound test is great. Don't go too light, however, as your line needs to hold up when fishing upstream.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;9. Maximize time in the water.&lt;/b&gt;<br /><br />Don't reel in too much when fishing for trout. The longer your bait is in the water, the more likely you will be to catch a trout. Consider carrying bait bags on you so that you can quickly and efficiently bait your hooks when they aren't in the water. The only time you should reel in is when you lose your bait or have a big trout on the other end.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;10. Make sure you have your license.&lt;/b&gt;<br /><br />Finally, always fish with a license. There are big fines imposed for those who fish without a license. Licenses aren't very expensive, so it certainly isn't worth the risk.

There are a number of trout fishing tactics out there, all of them designed to deceive the fish into thinking the bait you provide them is something natural. There is a lot that goes into the process, though, and the best trout anglers do all the little things to reel in the big one.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;1. Know that trout are very intelligent.&lt;/b&gt;<br /><br />The most important aspect of trout fishing is realizing the fish are very smart. You can't simply cast out bait, worrying about nothing else, and expect to catch a trout. Instead, you'll need to perform a variety of tasks to present a natural appearance to get trout to bite.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;2. Use natural bait.&lt;/b&gt;<br /><br />One of the easiest ways to present a natural appearance is simply to use natural bait. Worms, insects, and minnows are all perfect choices for trout. The line exception is if trout are very inactive in a specific area. In this instance, using a lure is acceptable to try to get them to bite.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;3. Cast upstream.&lt;/b&gt;<br /><br />To increase the natural appearance of bait even more, cast upstream. This way, the bait will naturally float downstream, bobbing up and down just as trout like. If you cast downstream, the bait will remain in one area and not look alive to trout.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;4. Use gang hooks.&lt;/b&gt;<br /><br />Finally, using gang hooks can increase the realistic look of bait. Smaller gang hooks aren't visible to trout, providing the appearance that bait is floating or moving on its own.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;5. Fish early.&lt;/b&gt;<br /><br />If you want to get trout when they are their most active, you better be an early riser. Trout are most likely to bite early in the morning, from about 6 a.m. to 10 a.m.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;6. Cast near objects.&lt;/b&gt;<br /><br />Boulders and fallen trees are hot spots for trout. The fish love to swim around them, so casting in the area where the water flows around these objects is a smart move. If you start just above the object and allow your bait to flow downstream, it will create a natural appearance that's likely to attract trout.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;7. Get rid of artificial smell.&lt;/b&gt;<br /><br />Trout have a sensational sense of smell, and if they sense something artificial on your bait, they won't bite. When you get to your fishing spot, rub some dirt on your hands prior to touching any bait. This will remove artificial scents and increase the odds of <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy50cm91dGZpc2hpbmdyZXZpZXcuY29tLw__" target="_blank">trout finding</a> your bait enticing.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;8. Bring options.&lt;/b&gt;<br /><br />If you want to increase your chances of catching trout, be versatile. Bring various types of fishing line, hooks, lures, and bait. Trout in certain areas or water depths might prefer specific types of bait or be attracted to certain lures, so you'll want to be prepared to accommodate them.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;9. Be light on your feet.&lt;/b&gt;<br /><br />This tip is two-fold. First, be sure to walk around lightly. Trout know a lot about what is going on above water, and they won't bite if they hear excessive noise. Secondly, use lightweight fishing tackle. Lightweight fishing line in particular is important because it needs to be invisible to trout. Be sure not to go too thin, however, as your line needs to be strong enough to reel in all the trout you desire.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;10. Don't fish in the rain.&lt;/b&gt;<br /><br />Some fish don't mind hitting on bait in the rain, but trout require a calm water surface to bite. Fishing during times when the sky is calm and clear is preferred over overcast days with rain.

		<document id="4bb9d651488660dbb99c572d4be83c6f" url=""><![CDATA[Arkansas Trout Fishing Regulations<br/><br/>When people think about <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy50cm91dGZpc2hpbmdyZXZpZXcuY29tLw__" target="_blank">trout fishing</a>, Arkansas does not usually come to mind. However, the state of Arkansas offers some of the best trout fishing in the United States. The White River is one of the top trout rivers in the nation. Beginning from the Missouri border and winding its way through the Ozarks of northwest Arkansas, the White River has about 150 miles of cold water that is perfect for trout. The Spring River, which is located in the north to northeast area of the state, is good trout water as well. In central Arkansas, the Little Red River is another place for the trout fisherman to enjoy.<br /><br />To fish for any species in Arkansas, one must acquire a fishing license from the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission. A license for residents of the state is $10.50. A special permit for trout must also be purchased for $5.00. Nonresidents of Arkansas can buy an annual fishing license for $40.00, although there are also limited licenses for 3, 7, and 14-day trips. A non-resident trout permit costs $12.00. Children under 16 years of age are not required to hold a license and seniors over the age of 65 can purchase a one-time license that is good for the remainder of their life. A non-expiring lifetime license that is all-inclusive for fishing and hunting can be purchased for $1,000. Arkansas has reciprocal agreements with Missouri, Mississippi and Tennessee, in which each state honors each other’s fishing licenses and permits on waters along the borders.<br /><br />There are four species of trout in Arkansas, including Rainbow, Brown, Brook and Cutthroat. The daily limit for all trout combined is five, although some areas have specific regulations limiting certain species to less than the daily limit. The daily limit of trout is also in conjunction with the overall daily limit of 75 fish of any species combined within a 24-hour period. Many areas in Arkansas have regulations pertaining to length limits of trout. There is usually a minimum length as well as a maximum length of fish that can be kept. Certain areas have a protected length limit, in which fish within a certain range must be released. Some areas near fisheries and nurseries have strict catch and release guidelines. These areas also usually only allow artificial lures or flies that have only one barb-less hook.<br /><br />There are some general regulations that apply to all fishing as well as trout fishing. No person is allowed to fish within 100 yards downstream from a dam, for safety purposes. Some areas below dams do allow fishing from the shore within this area. A major rule that is strictly enforced on trout waters is the ban on cleaning fish where they are caught. It is illegal and will draw heavy fines if one is in possession of a fish without a head or tail or fully cleaned filets. This rule is designed to support the different length and slot limit regulations.

There are hundreds, if not thousands, of Atlantic salmon fly tying materials that have been used in the creation of these flies. It would take a lifetime to master all the many salmon fly tying materials and Atlantic salmon fly tying designs. However, there are some tried and true patterns and materials that beginning Atlantic salmon fly tying learners can easily make to land some of these delicious fish. Follow this guide to five simple Atlantic salmon flies and the fly tying materials needed to construct them.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;The Rolled Muddler&lt;/b&gt;<br /><br />This amazing little fly is incredibly versatile. It will work to catch salmon in almost any weather and water conditions. It combines deer hide and mallard wing as the body and wing of the fly. These two fly tying materials come together to create a fly that is one of the most consistent salmon attractions in the fly fishing world. This fly should be moved steadily though the water to create motion that will be irresistible to salmon.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;Lady in Red&lt;/b&gt;<br /><br />An Atlantic salmon fly that is particularly beautiful, the Lady in Red is also very good at getting the salmon to bite. This fly uses deer hair for the body and pheasant or crow feathers died brightly red for the wings. Fishermen using this for the first time will be amazed how quickly it gets bitten. Many times it seems almost impossible to toss this fly in the water without getting an instant bite.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;Jock Scott&lt;/b&gt;<br /><br />The Jock Scott is perhaps the most colorful fly in the world. This fly can be constructed from many different salmon fly tying materials. The method used to make this fly is to take the most colorful fly tying materials available to create a fly that looks like a rainbow. Make the body from two different contrasting colors of animal fur. Make the wings from as many different color feathers as possible. The end result seems like it would scare away the salmon, but they consistently bite it with relish.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;Green Squirrel&lt;/b&gt;<br /><br />This colorfully named fly is made by wrapping some squirrel fur dyed bright green around the body of the hook. The green squirrel fur creates the body of the fly. The wings are made with oriole feathers. The orange of the feathers contrasts with the green fur to create a striking look that really attracts the notice of the salmon.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;The Golden Red&lt;/b&gt;<br /><br />A classic salmon fly that should be in any Atlantic salmon fisherman’s tackle box, the Golden Red is a hit with salmon all year-round. The body of the fly is constructed with fox fur if it is available, or with animal fur that is dyed red if it is not. The wings are constructed with golden pheasant feathers. The brilliant color of these feathers will attract salmon in the murkiest of water, and this is the go-to fly for fishermen in bad water visibility.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy50cm91dGZpc2hpbmdyZXZpZXcuY29tLw__" target="_blank">Trout Fishing</a>

		<document id="6f005de1b81872502bc3eac4c4940ade" url=""><![CDATA[Basic Trout Fishing Tactics for All Anglers<br/><br/>Trout fishing can be intimidating for amateurs who do not know much about it, but those who have learned to fish for trout often find doing so to be a fun and rewarding experience. While fishing for trout may seem like an incomprehensible mystery for those who never seem to catch anything, following a few basic tips will help turn a floundering fisherman into an apt angler. Those who wish to find out how to learn basic trout fishing tactics should take a few things to heart not only when fishing, but before casting in the first line.<br /><br />Before setting out on a trout fishing expedition, anglers should learn basic trout fishing tips. For example, choosing a location in which to fish is an important part of trout fishing. Many parks have free maps that outline rivers and streams and may even advise where the best fishing spots are located. Proper equipment is also important; having the wrong trout fishing equipment can doom an angler before he or she ever puts the worm in the water. Trout fishing equipment should be lightweight and slight rather than heavy and bulky because some trout are light sensitive enough to sense bulky fishing equipment.<br /><br />Selecting the proper bait and tackle is also part of knowing basic <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy50cm91dGZpc2hpbmdyZXZpZXcuY29tLw__" target="_blank">trout fishing</a> tactics. Experienced and successful fisherman usually have their own preferences and secrets in regards to baits and lures, but amateur fishermen using basic bait and tackle can be just as successful. An ultra light spinning rod between four and five feet long rigged up with four to six pound tested line is an acceptable rod, and #10 to #14 regular shank hooks plus a few small split shot are quality additions to the line. Nightcrawlers are regarded by many to be superior bait for basic trout fishing, although others swear by larvae or flies. Some trout fishermen also use spinners and jigs to imitate minnows; each angler needs to discover what works best for his or her own personal trout fishing style.<br /><br />How to cast and how to move in water are other important trout fishing tactics. Anglers should hook the nightcrawler just twice, once on each end; they should approach from downstream, moving as quietly as possible so as not to alert the trout. The angler should then cast upstream, allowing the nightcrawler to drift downstream naturally. Patience and accurate casting are important trout fishing techniques and should be practiced by all would-be trout anglers. Different types of trout are attracted to different locations and depths within a stream, so trout fisherman should familiarize themselves with the types of trout present in the stream in which they have chosen to fish.<br /><br />Fishing at the right time is also an important facet of trout fishing. Experts recommend fishing in the afternoon during the spring but getting out into the water by early morning during the summertime. Fish often do not like the extreme heat, so trout, like any other fish, are more likely to be active and feeding when it is not exceedingly hot.<br /><br />Basic trout fishing is an enjoyable activity, particularly for novices just starting their angling careers. Fly fishing is a more advanced form of trout fishing, but mastering basic trout fishing tips will help anglers work up to the skill that is necessary for fly fishing. Trout anglers should also be conscious of and knowledgeable about the rules of fishing particular locations; some places require fishing licenses before anglers may fish. Other places may have rules about the dates and times at which anglers may fish as well as rules about food.

Towering trees along winding roads through rolling hills makes the Beavers Bend area seem more like a trek through New England than what is usually envisioned when thinking about Oklahoma.<br /><br />Beavers Bend is a wonderful spot for a solo or group fishing trip or a family fishing vacation. Unlike much of the waters in the state, which are cloudy, Broken Bow Lake and the Mountain Fork River run clean and clear due to the lack of sedimentary runoff. Being up in the mountains the waters stay cool and well oxygenated, allowing many trout to survive to a ripe old age and grow to more than respectable lengths. The entire area is so pristine and provides a perfect habitat for trout that it is often referred to as “the gem of Oklahoma.”<br /><br />Part of designated “Trout Area 12,” Broken Bow Lake and the Mountain Fork River which drains it holds some of the best trout fishing in Oklahoma. To keep fish populations high, and anglers grinning, the area receives a generous stocking of rainbows every other week throughout the year-long trout fishing season.<br /><br />Most areas around Beavers Bend produce good action on wet flies and spinning lures, whereas the deep waters of Broken Bow Lake take well to trolling. When the insects are hatching, dry flies can be amazingly productive along the Mountain Fork, with both rainbows and brown trout of over 20 inches leaping through the air.<br /><br />Special regulations exist for many sections of the Mountain Fork River, and while the trout season stays open all year, creel and possession limits vary by location and some sections of the river allow only barbless hooks and imitation lures. Nonresidents face special possession limits when leaving the state with fish, so check current regulations before heading out.<br /><br />A state park of the same name, Beavers Bend State Park offers good access to the river as well as campsites and cabin rentals. The park also operates a 40-room lodge that overlooks Broken Bow Lake with suites and stone fireplace in the great room. Beavers Bend Marina on Broken Bow Lake provides tackle and boat rentals and several area fishing guides offer float trips down the river. Access the Beavers Bend area by traveling north on U.S. Hwy 59 or east on State Road 3 from the city of Broken Bow, Oklahoma. <br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy50cm91dGZpc2hpbmdyZXZpZXcuY29tLw__" target="_blank">Trout Fishing</a>

The location is actually fed by one spring (Bennett Spring), and is the third-largest spring in Missouri. Bennett Springs State Park was acquired by the state of Missouri in 1924, and is host to numerous activities, including camping, picnic areas and hiking trails. However, Bennett Springs is most well-known for its trout fishing because of its massive size and outstanding fish.<br /><br />Bennett Springs trout fishing is among the best in the Midwest, and especially Missouri. Located in the Lake of the Ozarks area, there are numerous stream branches that are ideal for catching trout. The 100,000,000 gallons of clear, pristine water that feeds through the stream is any fisherman's dream. Over 3,000 acres welcome nature enthusiasts and provide outstanding opportunities for fly fishermen to cast a line and catch some trout.<br /><br />There are a number of different trout species that are in the streams of Bennett Springs. Many people are excited to bring out good sized rainbow and brown trout, and brook trout are also common. The stream is stocked on a daily basis, so there is never a shortage of fish to catch. The average length of a rainbow trout in a Bennett Springs stream is approximately 12 inches, and many weigh over three pounds, larger than most stocked trout streams.<br /><br />Some people decide to instead run spinners through the streams, such as Rooster Tails or Panther Martins. Most fishermen that go to Bennett Springs prefer to fly fish, typically using nymphs. The majority of fishermen that are the most satisfied with their experience in Bennett Springs tend to fly fish, as the streams are set up nicely to cast with a fly rod.<br /><br />Bennett Springs gives fishermen the opportunity to get out into nature and catch some outstanding fish in Missouri. Many people travel from Kansas City or St. Louis to embark on outdoor fishing adventures in southern Missouri. It is a quick drive for many that want to catch some trout without having a ton of people around. With great nature scenes, a lot of woods and such a large plot of land, the state run park is a great destination for anyone. Add in the outstanding fishing areas, streams and pools, not to mention the large rainbow trout in comparison to some neighboring areas, and anyone - experienced or inexperienced - would be pleased with Bennett Springs <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy50cm91dGZpc2hpbmdyZXZpZXcuY29tLw__" target="_blank">trout fishing</a>.

Choose a cold, blustery Saturday in February or March when trout fishermen start dreaming of opening day. Find a comfortable stool in a local bar, buy a few rounds of beer, and when the time is right, just ask about the best local streams. Pay close attention to the answers because all of them will be bald-faced lies. You can ask the same question in church, and a trout fisherman will lie to you without feeling any remorse or guilt, even if he's a priest. Trout fishing is nearly another form of religion in Pennsylvania.<br /><br />It's easy to find the most popular trout fisheries in the state. Some of the best-known are:<br />Spring Creek in Centre County<br />Little Juniata in Perry County<br />Penns Creek in Snyder and Union Counties<br />Black Moshannon Creek in Centre County<br />Yellow Breeches Creek in Cumberland County<br /><br />Try to find a county in Pennsylvania that doesn't have a trout stream! Here are a few lesser known ones:<br />East Hickory Creek in Forest County<br />Little Shenango in Mercer County<br />Sandy Creek in Mercer County<br />Loyalhanna Creek in Westmoreland County<br />Four Mile Run in Westmoreland County<br />Laurel Hill Creek in Somerset County<br /><br />If you want to find that special, secret fishing spot away from the shoulder-to-shoulder crowds of opening day, you'll have to do a little detective work. There are streams that hold breeding populations of native trout. They're never stocked and they get little fishing pressure. Crowds of trout fishermen are non-existent.<br /><br />Get a topographic map from the US Geological Survey or a county map from the county courthouse. The USGS maps show things like old railroad right-of-ways that allow easy hiking, and both maps show every significant stream. Look for small streams that feed into existing, well-known trout waters. If there are road crossings, be a bridge peeper. Stop the car, get out, and take a good look at the water. Even a small stream you might step across can hold trout where it scours deep holes.<br /><br />Some of these streams are obvious when you look at a map. There are places in the Allegheny National Forest, for instance, that have miles of gorgeous trout water, but you'll have to walk for miles and possibly camp overnight to reach them.<br /><br />The other way to avoid the crowds is to avoid fishing on weekends. Go during the week when everyone else is at work. You might have a spot all to yourself that is packed elbow-to-elbow on weekends. And if there's a place to avoid, possibly because the locals insist it has hungry bears, do not go there -- ever. Trout fishermen never lie about bears. Well, hardly ever.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy50cm91dGZpc2hpbmdyZXZpZXcuY29tLw__" target="_blank">Trout Fishing</a>

Check out this guide to the top trout fishing locations in the world.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;Tusket River&lt;/b&gt;<br /><br />This river tucked deep in the northern woods of Nova Scotia requires anglers to hike back into the woods to reach it. This is wilderness that is plenty wild. In addition to the great trout in the river, the woods are full of bears and moose. Anglers should definitely hire a guide to head into the woods. Not only will a guide know all the best fishing spots, but he will keep anglers from getting lost in this intimidating wilderness.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;Sutherland, Scotland&lt;/b&gt;<br /><br />This trout fisherman’s paradise is the perfect place to get away from civilization and lose oneself in the pleasures of fishing. The brooks in the hills surrounding this town are stocked full of some of the most delicious trout in the world. The scenery of the hills and the heather is absolutely breathtaking. Camping here with a fresh caught trout roasting in a pan over the campfire is as close to perfection as it gets.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;River Lochy&lt;/b&gt;<br /><br />This remote river in Queensland, Australia is home to some of the biggest brown and rainbow trout in the world. This is one of the most challenging <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy50cm91dGZpc2hpbmdyZXZpZXcuY29tLw__" target="_blank">trout fishing</a> excursions in the world. The river can only be reached by helicopter or boat, and it seems like the fish in it are the smartest in the world. A local guide is essential for anglers who want to come home with a mess of trout.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;Rio Grande&lt;/b&gt;<br /><br />Located at Tierra del Fuego in Argentina, this is one of the most remote fishing spots in the world. Most of the rainbow trout here have never even seen a fisherman’s hook. This is a costly trip that requires a private plane ride, guides, supplies and expensive permits, not to mention the expense of traveling to Argentina. However, those that make the trip will come home with stories that will put almost any other fisherman’s tales to shame.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;Montana&lt;/b&gt;<br /><br />This is the most legendary trout fishing spot in the world. The setting of the bible of trout fishing, “A River Runs Through It,” Montana has a wealth of fishing opportunities available. Every single corner of the state has rivers that are loaded with brown and rainbow trout. The two best areas to make a home base during a trout fishing excursion are Missoula and West Yellowstone.<br /><br />These towns are the perfect spots to load up on supplies, get advice from the locals and head out to explore this fishing paradise. These are both in the southern area of the state, where the most famous rivers like Yellowstone, Madison, Blackfoot and Bitterroot are. Those who head to northern Montana can find rivers stocked with trout and free of other fishermen.

The amazing beauty of the mountains of West Virginia provides the perfect backdrop for the fishing action. The streams in these mountains are packed with brook, brown and rainbow trout. There is a lot of country to explore for West Virginia trout fishermen, so follow this guide to have the best possible experience.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;Trout Fishing Spots&lt;/b&gt;<br /><br />In the mountains of West Virginia fishermen will find three of the most famous trout sighing streams in the entire world. Shaver’s Fork, Elk River and Cranberry River are the perfect trout fishing streams. The water in these mountain streams is as clear as glass and icy cold. The water tumbles and pools over the large boulders found in the streams, which creates perfect pockets that trout love to stay in.<br /><br />These large pockets of water can grow fish of incredible size. This is one of the principal draws of trout fishing in West Virginia. Fishermen here can be rewarded with some of the biggest trout in the world. It just takes patience and a little guidance.<br /><br />Two other rivers that feature good trout fishing in West Virginia are the southern part of the Potomac River and the northern part of the South Branch River. These two spots are very excellent for fly fishermen in particular.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;What to Catch&lt;/b&gt;<br /><br />The rainbow trout are the most prevalent species of trout in the state. West Virginia also has sizeable populations of brown and brook trout. One of the most unique parts of trout fishing in West Virginia is the population of steelhead trout.<br /><br />Steelhead trout are rainbow trout that have adapted to live in both saltwater and freshwater. This means that steelhead trout can go out to the open ocean where they have room to grow to a much larger size than freshwater trout. They then come back into the inland streams of West Virginia and provide some of the biggest trophy trout imaginable.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;Go with a Guide&lt;/b&gt;<br /><br />The best way to go trout fishing in West Virginia is with an experienced guide. The vast nature of the West Virginia wilderness means that there are many hidden trout streams located throughout the mountains. The only way to find these steams is to go with a guide that knows their locations.<br /><br />Not only can a guide take fishermen to hidden trout spots, but they also know the best techniques to catch the fish. The conditions of the water, the weather and the time of year can all make a huge difference on what the fish will bite on. Without a guide oftentimes fishermen will struggle to find the right technique to land the trout.<br /><br />The experienced nature of these guides allows them to know precisely what the fish will bite on at all times. This saves a lot of time and effort during a fishing trip, which increases the odds of coming home with the West Virginia daily limit of six trout.
