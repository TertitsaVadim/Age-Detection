<br />Why do we love the ones we are not aloud to?
<br />Tortured and Ridiculed
<br />I just want to be happy .. is that so wrong?
<br /><br />This love is so wrong .. but it feels so right
<br />I want the pain to end
<br />Even if i must die to do so
<br />Forbidden and hated
<br /><br />I love a man who loves me back 
<br />Why can't you be happy for me?
<br />The pain I feel is unimaginable
<br />All because I love someone who is hated
<br /><br />I want to be with him more than anything
<br />My own family won't allow it
<br />Why can't I be with the only man i'll ever love?
<br /><br />Forbidden and hated
<br />Tortured and ridiculed
<br />Bleeding and screaming
<br />This is what I have become
<br /><br />All because I love someone who is hated

<br />They both go together 
<br />I love him more then anything 
<br /><br />Why do you hate him?
<br />What's the point anymore?
<br />I see none..
<br /><br />Bleeding .. is what I do everytime you mock him 
<br />Screaming .. is what I do because I love him .. and you hate him
<br />Hated .. is what he has become
<br />Death .. is what I pray for
<br /><br />No matter what you say I know you'll always hate him
<br />No matter what he does it's always wrong .. even if it's right
<br />No matter how much I beg and how much I cry .. you will never care
<br />No matter how many times I try .. I just can't die .. why?
<br /><br />I love him more then life itself 
<br />More then I love me
<br />More then I love .. anything
<br /><br />Why can't I be happy?
<br />Do you always want me to cry?
<br />Over something that you made..
<br />Why must you make my life miserable?
<br /><br />I want to love and be loved .. is that too much to ask for?
<br />Even if you don't want it to be .. we will be together .. somehow .. someday
<br />Will I never be alive?
<br />Do you want me to be dead forever?
<br /><br />All I want is him ..

<br />Death is what I pray for 
<br />You know I love him yet you hold firm on what you believe about him
<br />He's not that bad .. he's actually very sweet
<br /><br />I love him but you hate him .. why must you torture us?
<br />I want love not pain
<br />Why can't I ever be happy?
<br /><br />I tried to achieve death once .. don't think it's impossible I won't try because of you 
<br />Because it is
<br />I'll never fully heal
<br />No matter what the doctors say
<br /><br />My heart still bleeds
<br />For it is broken to the extent that it's impossible to mend
<br />The only time I am ever truly happy is when i'm with him
<br /><br />When I bring him up 
<br />I'm happy
<br />You mock and laugh at him
<br />I die a little inside
<br /><br />Some say he's cute .. I think he's AMAZING
<br />Some say he's adorable .. It's true .. he is
<br />Some say he's ugly .. Never will I think that
<br />Some think he's absolutely gorgeous .. it's true
<br /><br />Love is torture .. and I like it

<br />Love is what I want to feel
<br />Happiness has been taken away from me long ago
<br /><br />I found love
<br />And hate found it
<br />Pain and blood pour from my arm and wrist 
<br />Why do you hate the love I have?
<br /><br />Red stained sheets 
<br />A rusty razor blade clutched in my crimson stained hand
<br />Pain fills my soul .. as my life fades
<br />You got what you asked for
<br /><br />My life flashes and I cry
<br />No one will be able to tell him i'm gone
<br />When he finds out I fear what will happen 
<br />Will he cry?
<br /><br />Tears of blood streak down my face
<br />As I lay dieing I pray that he still loves me .. even in death
<br />Will he always love me?
<br />Or has it all been a lie?
<br /><br />Will you finally see what you are doing to me?
<br />If you don't then all is lost
<br />My love for him will always be there
<br />Even in despair
<br /><br />I love him .. even through death

<br />Why must we go through this everyday?
<br />I love him and you hate it .. why?
<br />Do you want me to be happy .. or sad?
<br /><br />I love his smile and his laugh 
<br />I love the way he talks and the way he walks 
<br />I love the way he loves me 
<br />How can you hate this?
<br /><br />The love songs I hear only makes me think of him more
<br />No matter what they are always talking about him
<br />The pain is so unreal
<br />It's real .. but you don't care
<br /><br />I lie here clutching a tiny razor blade in my crimson painted hand
<br />my life slowly fades .. it's hue a very pretty red colour
<br />I cry knowing i'll never see him again .. never hold him again
<br />My vision fades ..
<br /><br />The pain is so unreal .. see what you have done to me?

<br />It yearns for the love it once held
<br />Before it was painfully ripped away
<br /><br />My heart bleeds
<br />It's shattered remains lay on the floor
<br />Along with fresh tears and blood
<br /><br />'Go to the kitchen and get them!'
<br />My mind screams
<br />I comply
<br /><br />I lay on my bed and cry
<br />Tears of love , pain and hate
<br />The deed done
<br /><br />grabbing my razor I angrily slash my wrists
<br />Blood splatters everywhere
<br />The floor , along with my arm , covered in it
<br /><br />My body twitches as the pills take effect
<br />With my last ounce of energy I sob Loudly
<br />Then fall to the floor
<br />My body writhering in pain and agony
<br /><br />Blood streaks over my face
<br />As though i'm crying tears of blood
<br /><br />My vision fades as I die
<br />The last words I speak a whisper 
<br />&quot;..I Love You..&quot;
<br /><br />This is my beautiful suicide

<br />I smile at my reflection
<br />I see all the cuts
<br />The new and the old

<br />And put on a sweater
<br />So my mother won't know
<br /><br />I lay in bed and think
<br />What have I done?
<br />Why am I doing this?
<br />Why?
<br /><br />I start to cry
<br />But no one knows .. no one hears
<br />I'm alone .. all alone
<br /><br />No one knows my secret
<br />I don't want them to

<br /><br />It started out small
<br />But it soon became large
<br />I couldn't stop myself
<br />I had to do it
<br /><br />Everyone thinks i'm very happy
<br />Content really
<br />I'm not
