In summer holidays, I searched for ferries to France and took a convenient ferry travel to reach Dunkerque and from there headed to Louvre by Car. This museum is belonging to the medieval time castle and slowly, over time turned into Museum collecting huge antique and also adding activities with thematic trails of all possible times. The visited building is at Louvre; in fact is the residence of Kings and the Emperors of France. The Palais du Louvre, which houses one of the most stunning collections of artworks in the world, is known first and foremost as a museum. Yet for almost seven hundred years the buildings constituted one of the foremost residences of the kings and Emperors of France. 
<br /><br />Down from ages for both the artists and for the epic writers Lion has been the expression as a source of strength, courage and valour and these thematic trail designs which I had seen at museum have the same footprints of the past which were written and rewritten in the bible and the mythological stories. The mythological stories always proclaimed Lion as a creature that is most radiant and fierce to be battled and when fails to win over fight to a man, then the slain lion adds a feature to the cap of the killer. Lion as I could understand is considered in the medieval times as the guardian to the eternal sleep to the death. On the other hand, these sculptures have also at places shown Lion attacking non-carnivorous animals and for these animals lions become fearsome enemies. It is all the artistic temperament that portrays in these creatures into good ‘n’ evil. Here at Paris De Louvre you can find a whole style of artistic antiques depicting all cultures and class of societies i.e. Gothic, Roman Renaissance, Mannerist, classical, baroque, and Romantic. The hunt for these carnivorous animals can be found at Napoleon hall as I headed for Richelieu wing. These photographs are analogous to the medieval period art works.
