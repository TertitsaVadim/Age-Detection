<br />driving home from the movies. The 
<br />boy sensed there was 
<br />something wrong because of the painful 
<br />silence they shared between the 
<br />that night. The girl then asked the boy to pull over 
<br />because she wanted to talk. She told him that her 
<br />feelings had changed &amp; that it was time to move on. 
<br />A silent tear slid down his cheek as he 
<br />slowly reached into his pocket &amp; passed her a folded note. 
<br />At that moment, a drunk driver was speeding down 
<br />that very same street. He swerved 
<br />right into the drivers seat, killing the boy. 
<br />Miraculously, the girl survived. Remembering the note, she 
<br />pulled it out &amp; read it. 
<br />&quot;Without your love, I would die.&quot;

<br /><br />It says..... 
<br /><br />Erika, 
<br /><br />U probably already know that im leaving, i knew this would be better if i wrote a letter explaining tha truth about how much i care about you. The truth is, is that i never loved you, i hated you so much, u are my bitch and dont u ever forget that. I never cared about you, and never wanted to talk to you, and be around u. U really have no clue how much i hate you. Now that im leaving i thought u should know that i hate you bitch, u never did tha right thing, and u were never there. I didnt think i could hate someone as much as i hate you. And i never want to see you, for the rest of my life, i will never miss kissing you like before, i never want to cuddle up, how we used to. I will not miss you and thats a promise. U never had my love, and i want you to remember that. Bitch u keep this letter bcuz this may be tha last thing u have from me. I hate you so much. i will not talk to you soon bitch.... Goodbye 
<br />- Kyle 
<br /><br />[ erika begins to cry, she throws tha paper in tha garbage &amp; crys for hours ]

<br /><br />Friend: how are u feeling? 
<br /><br />Girl: i just cant believe this happend i thought he loved me. 
<br /><br />Friend: o, about that. Kyle left me a msg. A few days ago. He told me to tell u to look in ur jacket pocket or something... 
<br /><br />Girl: ummm ok 
<br /><br />[She finds a piece of paper in tha jacket, It says...] 
<br /><br />Baby i hope u find this before u read my letter. I knew ur dad might read it, so i switched a few words... 
<br /><br />Hate = Love 
<br /><br />Never = Alwayz 
<br /><br />Bitch = Baby 
<br /><br />Will not= will 
<br /><br />........ I hope u didnt take that seriously because i love you with all my heart, and it was so hard to let you go thats y i wanted u to run away with me... 
<br /><br />-Kyle

<br /><br />girl meets a boy on a messenger 
<br /><br />crazy1 86: hey baby!!! 
<br /><br />h0tNsPiCy91: who is this??? 
<br /><br />crazy1 86: ur secret admirer!!!!! 
<br /><br />h0tNsPiCy91: oh really.... quit lyin! who is this??? 
<br /><br />crazy1 86: i loved u the first time a stared in your eyes... 
<br /><br />crazy1 86: i think about u everyday... you are my dream come true. 
<br /><br />crazy1 86: we met once! i dont think u remember tho. 
<br /><br />crazy1 86: i cut myself because the pain takes away my feelings of u. 
<br /><br />crazy1 86: u will see me sometime tonight.... 
<br /><br />h0tNsPiCy91: ..WHO IS THIS!?!?!? 
<br /><br />crazy1 86ont worry.... ill take very good care of you... 
<br /><br />crazy1 86 had signed off. 
<br /><br />The girl was so scared she locked all her doors and windows. She made sure her room was secured. She wasn't sure if it was a joke or for real. She didn't know when he was going to come. The girl was so frightened she decided to sleep with her little sister. The girl dozed off quickly. 
<br /><br />Then she heard a knock on the window. The girl slowly walked to the window. It started knocking louder. The girl looked through the windows and saw nothing... just some of the tree branches. The girl went back to bed with her sister. The bed was wet and had a pretty horrid smell. Maybe her sister wet the bed... the girl checked and found blood everywhere. The girl panicked. She didn't know what to do. She ran and hid in the closet in case the killer was there for her. While looking through the cracks of the closet the girl saw a shadow. It was dark, so she couldn't figure out who it was. She started to get more frightened. The shadow crept closer to the closet. The girl closed her eyes as if it was a dream. Then suddenly he opened the closet door and pulled her out. 
<br /><br />Her parents found her dead the next morning. She was completely skinned and hanging in her sister's closet. The younger sister was also found skinned and dead. 
<br /><br />PART 2... 
<br /><br />Two years after the Smith sisters deaths, the parents had a baby boy. The girl's room became a guest room and the little sister's room where the murder took place became the baby's room. The baby grew up to be a successful kid. 
<br /><br />One night he was on the computer and received an instant message. 
<br /><br />h0tNsPiCy91: Hey lil bro!!! 
<br /><br />2seXay4u: Who the eff is this? 
<br /><br />h0tNsPiCy91: It's your big sis. 
<br /><br />2seXay4u: I never had a sister. I'm an only child. 
<br /><br />2seXay4u: This is some kinda joke, huh? 
<br /><br />h0tNsPiCy91: Mom and dad never told you? 
<br /><br />h0tNsPiCy91: I died 15 years ago with your other older sister. 
<br /><br />h0tNsPiCy91: We were murdered in your room which was once my little sister's room. She was killed in bed when I was sleeping. I was killed in the closet and skinned to death. 
<br /><br />2seXay4u: Quit lying. I never had a sister. If I did my parents would have told me. Whatever. Your stupid. 
<br /><br />h0tNsPiCy91: You don't believe me? Well if you wanna look in your closet floor. 
<br /><br />h0tNsPiCy91: I carved my name and the time and date I was being murdered. Then I carved my little sister's name. 
<br /><br />h0tNsPiCy91: If you don't believe me little brother check the internet. Google on ''Smith sisters murdered anonymously''. 
<br /><br />h0tNsPiCy91: I gtg little brother. I love you and mom and dad soo much. I can't believe they kept us a secret from you. They should burn in hell. 
<br /><br />The boy checked the closet. He saw the carvings. Was it true? He surfed the internet and information was there about the anonymous murder in the house. The next morning the boy went downstairs. It was so quiet. Maybe his parents were sleeping. Hours later the boy found his parents in their closet skinned and hanged. Then he found more carvings on the ground. They said ''I TOLD YOU I WASN'T LYING LITTLE BROTHER, I LOVED MOM AND DAD.... BUT THEY KEPT ME A SECRET. I CAN'T BELIEVE IT. WELL I'M FREE FROM THIS COLD WORLD, I WON'T HURT YOU LIKE I HURT THEM. I LOVE YOU!&quot;
