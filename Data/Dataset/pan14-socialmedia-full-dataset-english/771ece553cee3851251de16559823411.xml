<br /><br />Okay, so, while it's still fresh, and despite the whole exhausted thing, let's try to get this down.
<br /><br />Friday's first, of course. So, Friday. Friday we got up ridiculously early, left a half-hour after anticipated leaving time, and still made it to Wichita before 10. By 11, had collected the female portion of the roommates, and as we were coming back from storing her stuff in my truck, found both the males. So, went back after the stuff. Hauled up to room. Was immediately offered Cocaine, which tastes rather like cherry pop rocks and jalepenos. It hadn't chilled yet, so there was the whole warm drink thing to add to that, but it was pretty tasty.
<br /><br />Within five minutes, the boys were offering to look into a ball gag for the kid. I told them to go for it. I still have no ball gag. Later, after I learn how to use the Windows Movie Maker (or whatever editing program this computer came with) I will post one of the panels we were at, and you will understand my disappointment. Er, post on YouTube, I expect. (it is posted there, somewhere)
<br /><br />Sadly, the underwear video, which I was also invited to join, did not happen. I'm blaming the kid, (and all females) because by the time we got done with bathroom breaks and arranging our stuff &amp; whatever the hell else we were doing, Darrk got bored and was the first one out the door. Why he didn't do it later, I don't know. Oh well. Oh, I think I was waiting to see if there were details to my involvement, since I said maybe.
<br /><br />Um... what the hell did we do after that? No idea, really, but we eventually wound up in line to get our badges. Stepped into a couple of the panels, but not more than a few minutes each, except for the Remembering Toonami panel, discovered the one I was actually interested in was either canceled or so non-attended that they quit early, watched some anime (Tiger and Bunny familiar to anyone<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/4185//smilies/unsure.gif" alt=":)" />, then followed Darrk to the party room. Twister and Melee ensued. Kid got hungry, we left to eat, and I wound up trapped in the room because he fell asleep.
<br /><br />Then, we started Saturday. Saturday started entirely too early in the day for my day off! Except, you know, it was con, and therefore we weren't up early enough. Er, well, most of us weren't. Boytoy came in about 4 am? Yeah, about then, to do costume change #2. I failed to mention that we walked in on costume change #1 on Friday. Honestly, I saw that boy in nothing but his skivvies entirely too many times over the weekend.
<br /><br />*listens to crickets chirping*
<br /><br />*rereads*
<br /><br />You are indeed correct, but since one of his cosplays of Snow had him half-dressed more often than not... *snorts* Okay, okay, the eyecandy was appreciated. Hence, the nickname Boytoy, since he was constantly between costumes. Where was I? Anyway, Darrk passed out by the cage and slept under the Yugi_Oh! dueling table. I saw Boytoy mostly when he was stripping - I mean switching! - switching costumes between Snow and Ishida, and Darrk just after he woke me up. *nods* He excelled at coming in just after we girls were comfy and starting to snore. Sometimes, he brought friends, but we'll maybe get to that eventually, because I've lost where I was again. Right. Boytoy, stripping, 4am.
<br /><br />Eventually, we were all up and conning. Hit the Opening Ceremony, 2 Samuri Dan panels... or was it 3? We hit most of his panels. Watched a bit more anime. Caught the tail end of Salia's concert, and all of Eyeshine's. They're fucking awesome. Someone hollered for them to play &quot;Freebird&quot; and when he finished cussing, Johnny said, &quot;Okay, this next song is called 'Freebird'&quot;, and made up lyrics as he went along. He's very good at improvising songs - both sets that I saw the band do, he was making shit up. If you don't know Eyeshine, look 'em up. What you have is an ex-Power Ranger/Soul Reaper/somebody from Code Geass fronting a band, a Japanese boy who needs the band recognized so they won't cancel his work visa, and the drummer... *thinks hard* who is the sexiest of the bunch, and about whom nothing much was mentioned.
<br /><br />Hit up the non-formal dance, aka rave. Which was vastly fun, because for once I decided that I could get into and enjoy the music, despite being Rick-rolled. One song required spinning, so I spun. Except, I should have stayed spinning in one direction, because spinning in the other lead to a misstep that sent me closer to the wall than planned, and the end result was me examining the spinning ceiling instead of the spinning carpet. Somebody did come over to help up after my third attempt to find the wall again, and got me as far as my knees before the floor insisted that it still loved me, so I crawled over to the wall. The next song wanted headbanging, which I can and did do. Lost an earring and my glasses. Found the glasses. Kid found the earring. Oddly, was still twitching to the music whilst on my knees, and had apparently chased the spinning dizzies out with headbanging, because I could stand up after that. Found the earring back (in a room lit by colored flashing strobes, in the dark corner. go me!). Finished out the rave, went back to party room, watched some more twister, and took the kid back for feeding.
<br /><br />Sunday dawned rather like Saturday did. Something kinda interesting about waking up to the sight of cute guy skinning out of his clothes while trying to be quiet and stealthy so as not to wake everyone up. Wait, must add the . There it is. Checkout was noon. Con got over... at 6pm. Darrk arrived to tell us we needed out by noon about the same time Snow finished packing up his stuff. Darrk collected his stuff and left, taking Boytoy along with him. Kuro left a bit later, and promptly vanished.
<br /><br />Bitty and I took a bit longer, since I was trying to ensure we had all our stuff (yes) and set the room up for a chance to win the cleanest room contest. Found roomie's things, texted and arranged return of said stuff, and confirmed that the garage was gonna be open at six so that I wouldn't need the room key to leave. Gave Darrk the key so I didn't have to worry about it.
<br /><br />Hit up another one of Dan's panels (from which, I believe, the video comes, because it was the 2nd time the kid got into an insult exchange with him!), watched some more anime, read some manga, hit up another panel, fed the kid, hit the awards &amp; closing ceremonies. Eyeshine came up to say bye, because they had to take off to make their flight.
<br /><br />They were still stuck in the lobby waiting on the shuttle by the time I'd got the truck to the front door after closing ceremony. Sent the kid over to see if they'd sign his Eyeshine sticker, and after getting the bags, went to collect the kid. The poor guys were trying to write on the sticker with normal pens - which bumper sticker style stickers hate. A Sharpie was eventually discovered, and Bitty got his sticker signed. They were kind enough to sign my badge. The shuttle arrived moments later, and they were out the door.
<br /><br />Bitty got hold of the luggage cart in the spirit of helpfulness, and managed to get it stuck in the revolving door. He insisted I was shoving it against him. The valet/desk clerk/helpful employed type guy got him untangled and explained that he'd been pushing it backwards. That, my dears, was the start of the comedy of errors that led to our return home.
<br /><br />By the the time we got home, I'd managed to make two wrong turns (thankfully still in the direction of HOME!), and nearly run out of gas. Gas station #1 was credit/debit card only. I had $2 (tops) on my card. The 2nd gas station was COMPLETELY OUT OF GAS. The third was also credit card only, but by then I had no choice but to put in what I could, and hope it would get us to an open station with gas that accepted cash. *facepalm* Scanned card. Started pump. Waited for it to click. Realized it wasn't clicking, and was WAY over what I had in the bank. Stopped at $25, and hoped like fuck it would get us home. Stopped for drinks and icecream to combat excessive heat when we eventually reached a Dairy Queen. The gas light came on about 20-25 miles from home, and we coasted into the next gas station on the tail end of the remaining fumes. Eight miles later, we were home.
<br /><br />Where we discovered that Bitty's autographed Eyeshine sticker had vanished. I'm not sure if it was at the gas station in Peabody, where we tried to get directions to a gas station that actually had gas and didn't require a card, or at Emporia's Dairy Queen. Those were the two places we both got out of the truck... but I'm betting on Emporia, because it's the only place the electronics bag came out too - and Bitty said the ticket was in the middle of the seat, which is where the bag was. (I WILL UPDATE if it gets found.)
<br /><br />So, anyhow, it is now basically bedtime. Maybe I'll find the autographed Eyeshine sticker when the sun is up and I don't have to rely on a flashlight to look under the truck... but... yeah. (Sticker never found. We cleaned out the truck.)

Though, considering that I got 25 votes, and the winners got 220 &amp; 197 respectively, I didn't do too horribly awful. It was 23 more votes than I knew I was getting, and 21 more than I figured I could expect. (6 candidates, btw)

Mornings, I'll be homeschooling, and nights, I'll be working. Be much better for the family, waiting to see what that does to my pocketbook! Course, there's a minimum number of required hours, instead of being bounced around and never knowing how many I'd get, and a pretty well set schedule (day wise, still waiting to see which hour plan of the three options I get), so I'm expecting it will only pinch while I'm catching up from only being scheduled 2 days a week the last 4 weeks. (That job almost NEVER does that, so I was appalled, and then, sad to say, happy when someone got fired, because it gave me the full-time option)

<br /><br />Tuesday, we started out the day fishing. Mind, this is me, both my boys, and my nieces. Eldest son is out chest deep in the water, lure fishing (he lost 3, and he thinks it was to the same mean fish) when he wasn't splashing in to get another lure or another bug to put on when he gave up on lures, youngest son is attempting to cast (2 good ones out of all his tries) and usually going KERTHWUNK about 2 feet from shore, elder niece swimming, and younger niece alternating with casting and splashing. Totally expected to catch nothing whatsoever, in spite of the fact that I'm watching one fish about 3 feet out from shore (after the youngest gave up and went swimming) eating the bugs and the eldest complaining about losing lures.
<br /><br />I catched a fish! Absolutely no clue what it was... goldy-green scales and yellow mouth. Younger niece says, &quot;Daddy calls these yellow-mouths, they're good to eat.&quot; So, plunked it in the keeper and soaked up some sun whilst the older boy kept fishing and everyone else went swimming. Didn't catch anything else.
<br /><br />Youngest niece gutted the thing (she soooo takes after her daddy in the hunting/fishing dept.). We wrapped it up in tinfoil and tossed it on the grill. And since 3 of 4 kids yelled &quot;I'm not eating fish!&quot;, made hamburgers whilst it cooked. Personally, I think it tasted like a cross between chicken and tuna. Not bad, little bit chewy.
<br /><br />Then we played kickball. At least, until the sky went from blue to &quot;EEEK! RAIN!&quot; (about that fast, too!) and we all headed for the tents - only to discover the big one leaked and the rain flap for the smaller one was missing - and then to the van. *grins* It had ac and tunes, so all was well.
<br /><br />Weather report called for even more rain... sky promptly cleared up, wind picked up, and everything dried out. Pretty rainbow - a double with the second barely visible. After checking in with Sis &amp; Mum, we wound up packing at 9pm (grrr!) and heading on home. And don't it figure that it didn't start clouding up again until after I got to work Wednesday afternoon?
<br /><br />Still! I caught a fish! And so did the older boy, the second time they went fishing at the other fishing hole. So, all in all, a good trip. (He did catch and release - said it was too little to keep.)
<br /><br />Guy at work said I probably caught a carp. Okay, whatever... tasty still! Will post a pic as soon as I get it downloaded from the camera and uploaded to the computer.

It represents a dream, that bag. One that got shot to shit several years ago, but I suppose I must still be hoping, seeing as I still have that wedding dress I only wore in the fitting room.
<br /><br />*sighs*
<br />Grabbed some more of my stuff from my dad's place and brought it home. Hence, the dress now hanging by my bed.

Came home with some useful infos, and some possible contacts, and have Twittered myself. *frowns* Not entirely certain I'm going to like being twittered at.. tweeted, whatever. Lingo is yet to be twitted.
<br /><br />And yes, my wits are fried. I've been awake over 48 hours now, and I'd be asleep if it wasn't for the fact that I wake up if I lay down. *contemplates sleeping in her chair, then all the stuff she'd hit falling out of it* Ow.
<br /><br />Oh, and if the wind picks up much more, the tree between my house and garage will crunch one, the other, or both.

<br /><br />Coming home from getting groceries the other day, Jazz tells me, &quot;I can read a book without the book.&quot; Me: *blinkblink* &quot;What? How do you read a book without having the book?&quot; He proceeded to recite the book he'd checked out from the school library two days before. The entire thing. Not that it was all that long, it's something called Ride the Thunderbolt, but it was FEEBLE.
<br /><br />Now mind, I'm thrilled that he was able to memorize and recite the thing. It's just that this book was in the &quot;age and class&quot; level of reading for first grade, and it sounded like something a Mum would read to her toddler! Her just starting to toddle toddler. Meh! He's reciting the thing, and I'm going &quot;Teletubbies! He's reciting a Teletubbies episode. Again, again!&quot; The brat just finished a chapter book called The Wishing Well that was published in the back then days (read, my mom was a kid) that was first or second grade level reading back then. It had real words, full sentences, paragraphs, and plot! (okay, so you could say Ride's plot is about riding a roller coaster, if you force the issue)
<br /><br />And then I get a call from his teacher today, to let me know that he peed on the bathroom floor yesterday. Why? The toilet was looking at him. He was assured this was not the case, because toilets don't have eyes. He then told the teacher it would take pictures of him peeing. She told him there aren't cameras on the toilets either. Which he still didn't believe, and pointed to the eyeball camera to prove it. Apparently the urinals are equipped with the sensors that auto-flush when little boys finish using them. The toilets apparently are still &quot;flush 'em yourself&quot;, so he was still in trouble for peeing on the floor instead of using one of them. He got to stay with the janitor and help clean up his pee.
<br /><br />I now must wonder if there are hidden cameras in some bathroom sensors... and yes, I am currently unhappily paranoid about self-flushing toilets with red eyeballs that watch me use the pot.

<br /><br />well, just helped one of the bishies with a wax job. Now he's in the shower finishing up with shaving cream and a razor since we ran out of wax strips. No way in hell I am ever going to wax my legs. Wax someone else again, maybe. But, I am sadistic like that. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/4185//smilies/tongue.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />soon's he's out, I'm off to see what's going on out in the lobby. Everyone's starting to show up to check in before we all register at 1.

		<document id="c6ce48d5bcddc5a71d076117faa4753e" url=""><![CDATA[Con, and after<br/><br/> Alrighty. Lemme open Facebook up, since I know that I stuck a couple updates there....
<br /><br />Y-con was a blast! So...
<br /><br />According to Facebook, I posted I was leaving at 4:16 am on Thursday. Was at the airport and discovered they had free wifi before 7:40am (next Facebook post). Was watching anime whilst I waited to be able to board the flight. My flight had no headwinds and LOTS of tailwind: we got to the airport a whole hour ahead of schedule! 'twas great!
<br /><br />Nikki had also arrived, and we texted back &amp; forth trying to figure out where each other was. Finally determined we were in different buildings, and I called the hotel to check for sure where the shuttle would pick us up. Then proceeded to text Nikki the info - just in time for her to board the shuttle that was about to pull away. Mine was the next stop, and lucky me!, she'd saved me a seat. Ride highly uneventful, aside from the hovering jets. It was really weird, looking out the window to see that the airplanes WERE NOT MOVING. They were hovering. (yes, I know the technicalities, still looked like they weren't moving). So we had fun with &quot;But that's only supposed to happen in Sci-fi!&quot;
<br /><br />Hotel desk said they didn't have us registered as having a room. Insta &quot;OH SHIT&quot; fit, but they sent us down to the room that Ginia and Pixelgoddess were in, where we discovered that in the back and forth emails of the setting up of the room, some information had gotten mislaid, and certain full names had been losted. Still, Ginia had snagged our keycards for us, so all was well.
<br /><br />Showered off the evil that was travel and insane work schedule, and headed out for sightseeing. Met up with Angel, Dana, &amp; PK, along with a bunch of others, but those were the three who wound up with me &amp; Nikki on the BART. My first subway-type ride! Got directions from a guy in a wheelchair to clarify our written directions, and caught the bus to Japantown. Picked up munchies, kimono, &amp; a desperate need for more spending money next year there, and returned back to the hotel. Our shuttle home was f'ing LATE, and poor PK got half-froze waiting on it.
<br /><br />On to the hot tub, where we met a certain blond for the first time - he was leaving, so more on him later. Tub was great... much goodness to be had. Then a nap for the insanity that was to begin the next day: The official first day of Yaoi-Con!
<br /><br />I'd actually expected to spend more time at con with Ginia and Pixelgoddess, and kinda feel like I ought to apologize to them for barely saying &quot;hi&quot; or &quot;bye&quot; through most of con. However, I am unfortunately easily swayed by pretty boys who demand my company, and Rufus Shin-Ra was my prince for the majority of con. Hey, I'm the Prince's Jewel, and he is the Prince of Shin-Ra, Inc., so it makes perfect sense! Anyhow...
<br /><br />We get up: we're STARVING. Must go get food. Ate breakfast at The Grill with Ginia and Pixel (shorter to type, kill me not!), and headed back to the hotel. Go back. Went wandering the hotel lobby, and met up with the lovely Rufus, whom we soon discovered was the blond from the hot tub the night before. Rufus and Reno were promptly suckered into a photo session with the cosplay.com photographer guy. Wander around a bit waiting for registration to start, meet up with AD&amp;PK and haul them and Rufus to The Grill for lunch, and get back in time to get our numbers for registration.
<br /><br />Now, after this, things start getting blurry due to the utter lack of sleep I've had up to this point, and my memory wanting to go &quot;tell them this! tell them this!&quot; out of order. Also, I could be wrong, and the above photo session could have been Saturday. Except I'm sure I was only Hojo on Friday. Wasn't I? I don't remember. So, henceforth are highlights!
<br /><br />Waxing. PK needed help waxing his legs before he put on his costume. Well, I've never waxed mine, and he asked me to help him anyway. So, I did. We ran out of wax strips before he ran out of hair, so he wound up in my shower, using my shaving gel and razor to get the rest of it. Me, I figure I will NEVER EVER wax my own legs, but I will help if asked again.
<br /><br />Copious photoshoots. Regardless of costume, our darling is a camera slut. Of the 535 photos &amp; videos I took during con, 387 included him as Rufus Shin-Ra, Cloud Strife, or Dante. Himself is referred to hereafter by whatever costume he had on. There was also a FFVII photoshoot... so maybe I was Hojo on Saturday, too? Nikki said that shoot was Saturday. Anyhow, lots of cameras flashing.
<br /><br />Cypher suckered us (Nikki, Rufus &amp; me) into volunteering to helping set up the swapmeet, since we were lounging in the courtyard when they started setting it up. We figure that ended up working in our favor, since we got to pick up official volunteer cards and ribbons and goodie bags and certificates and will get to use the volunteer discount next year. Two hours of rearranging tables and keeping people out until they had everything more or less where it was supposed to be - most of that waiting for hotel staff to come move the umbrellas - which they never did. Those fuckers were HEAVY!
<br /><br />Snagged some Bleach and Ruroni Kenshin manga at the swap meet, but didn't find anything I was actually looking for. Hit up the fan dealer room and both dealer's rooms, too. Got the posters I'd meant to go home with last year, lamented the lack of lollipop condoms (snagged some regular ones because I'd promised someone he'd get some), and couldn't find what I was looking for. Did buy a collar and chain when with Reno &amp; Dante, and got myself chained to Dante for a little bit. FINALLY found a Sado poster for my eldest brat for his birthday, on the very last day about an hour before the fan dealer room closed.
<br /><br />The charity auction went pretty well, I think. Rufus bid on something in &quot;true Rufus style&quot;. He had this little half-smirk going every time he raised his bid, and he was just lounging in his seat. Yeah, he won. The bishie auction? That didnt' go so well. The economy shat on con this year. It was estimated that attendance was down 20-30%... and the bishie auction proved the brokeness of the attendees. My darling Emory went for far less than he did last year - Ginia &amp; Pixel got him. The great Lestat, he who usually goes well over a $1000, went for a measly $850 - and he was the most expensive. Jareth, the Goblin King, was second at $600, and he didn't even need to take anything off! Makes me wonder if he had if he would have surpassed Lestat. Anyhow, Cloud and Reno both fell asleep during the auction. They were sooo cute! I has pictures!
<br /><br />I only hit one of the two forums I'd wanted to see, got caught up in a photoshoot during the second. Hopefully, I didn't miss much. The forums were... sparse on interest-grabbing this year. My interest, anyhow. As was, the forum I went to became the pre-show for the bishie auction, and may very well become a part of the viewing during registration next year. Hope so, 'cause Cid and Lestat did an excellent job putting it together.
<br /><br />Bishie Brunch turned out to be me, Nikki-Reno, Rufus, and his Reno (yeah, two Reno's) instead of me, Nikki, Ginia, &amp; Pixel because his Reno makes a plot bunny with a sugar-high on crack seem tame. Um, let's see. I don't much remember the opening ceremony. Pretty sure we were with Rufus then, too, though. Basically, once we found him, we became his. *shrugs* I am not complaining. I spent the majority of my convention snuggled next to a pretty Brit who loves attention, and have no problems with that whatsoever!
<br /><br />The dance... went with Cloud. We got fed up with the DJ and left, went to do some more pictures and soak in the hot tub. It really does look like a Mako pool if you can get the camera set right.
<br /><br />Bishie Bingo: we came so close time after time! I still owe Rufus a forfeit for not winning, even in the drawing. *pouts* I had over 35 entries, so I'm peeved I losted.
<br /><br />What else, what else... heh. I think the only thing left is Closing Ceremony. Rufus bought $100 worth of raffle tickets. I bought $10, and the three of us (add Nikki) each earned two tickets, and his Reno earned one. So between us we were trying to keep up with 139 tickets. Rufus won the first call, and then again 4 more times, and Nikki won once. The first and second times Rufus went up, he took Nikki-Reno with him. The last three, he took both of them because his had rejoined us. (Oh, she was his because they knew each other from previous cons and were roommates.) 'twas great fun.
<br /><br />After that, we met up with Aki, who became Yazoo, and did more photos (complete with Rufus becoming Cloud) until hunger became demanding, then we had a mini pizza-party in the lobby. 1/2 Hawaiian (for Cloud &amp; I), and 1/2 meatlovers for everyone else. Pizza went *poof* very quickly. Then we retreated to the hot tub again, and for the first time ever, were chased out by the hotel staff for being out there after hours. *snorts* We'd been out there every night of con, and only once during acceptable hours, so it was really annoying they finally decided to enforce the get out time. So, we went to Cloud &amp; Reno's room after being run out, and just hung out until ridiculous hours considering when Nikki had to be up to leave for her plane.
<br /><br />Made my flight in plenty of time, had tailwinds all the way back, got there early, called my ride to tell them so, and discovered they were stuck in 2mph traffic because everyone was getting off work or something. But, I did finally get home!
<br /><br />So, on the way home from con, I'd stopped at work. Discovered, to my utter dismay, that I was not getting any recovery time. Compliments of traffic, I was getting home a lot later than I'd expected, and while I'd known I had to work the next morning, I usually have Tuesday afternoons off. Nu-uh. I was scheduled for the next three nights, meaning after a fairly well sleepless con, I was working from 8:45am-11:15pm between both jobs for the next 3 days. Was well beyond loopy by Wednesday night, and managed to make a money error (in the store's favor) of $20, which meant when I came in even more tired on Thursday, the first thing that happened was me getting written up. Bad night went to shit... and more shit just kept piling on. Crap that ran out, crap that wasn't attached properly and therefore seemed to still be out, crap that wouldn't enter in the computer correctly, etc., and me be absolutely paranoid about who was giving me how much and how much I was giving back... but luckily my lovely boy was there to help out with another ex-co-worker, and once I'd finally stopped crying (I hate crying at work).
<br /><br />It also helped that he came in saying &quot;Mint &amp; Cherry!&quot; which I heard as Minty Cherries, and had a &quot;He started reading stuff on Y-Gallery when?&quot; moment, until he explained the condoms I'd given him were mint and cherry flavored, and that someone had offered him $200 for the mint one because no one had ever seen a mint-flavored one before. I had to laugh in spite of the stress, because that was just too funny.
<br /><br />Incidentally, thanks to my schedule, I missed out on voting. Totally lost track that it was Tuesday... *sigh*

<br /><br />At con, the group I was hanging out with was pretty much the same. The youngest was 18, and the oldest 29. The pretty Brit boy I got to cuddle was 26. My roommates were 29, 49 &amp; 50.
<br /><br />If I go and check MySpace, the people I've friended for something other than games range from 23-50 (and most are from the con group above!)
<br /><br />Facebook, non-relative, non-gaming types... I can add two teenagers (15 &amp; 16), three ex-school mates (30's), and three ex-coworkers (20,  30something, &amp; 40something).
<br /><br />Again, the same applies at LiveJournal, Hi5, IMVU, OK Cupid, Deviant Art, Twitter, and YouTube. What? Oh, right. I missed Flixter, which I hate with a passion, but love my wallpaper; Veoh Network, My RealAge (as I have no friends there, and hate the age they keep giving me), and a couple others that I have and never go to, so have no contacts at yet. Me? A social butterfly? Absolutely not. I merely live online, and attempt to survive reality.  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/4185//smilies/tongue.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />I associate most with the 26 &amp; under set. More intersection of interests, more messages or photos exchanged, more likely to know my legal stats &amp; shit like that. Aside from the 49 &amp; 50 year old mentioned as roommates at con, I don't believe I actually chat regularly with anyone over 30 who isn't related to me.
<br /><br />My usual style of dress is sloppy casual, when I'm not borrowing heavily from 80's glam crossed with Visual Kei. And even at work, elements of those can be found in headbands, gloves, and jewelry, and when I can get away with it, hairstyles/colors. I like anime, and get the fact that anime and cartoons are not the same thing. I like rock music, regardless of what country it's from, or what religion the band happens to be part of (Yes, that means I like Stryper, Danzig, Gackt, Miyavi, Rammstein, and a slew of others!), provided the music is good and not crap. Rap is generally crap, but I can think of one particular song and two artists in that genre that I do rather like because they don't utterly suck. I also usually utterly fail to act anywhere near my chronological age.
<br /><br />Perhaps this is why I don't get the old people who cannot think outside the box. The damn thing has flaps that open up to the world, after all.

<br /><br />from entry dated 11/12/09
<br />I guess con's just... out. Much fun as it is, the hassle afterwards is too much of a pain in the ass. Too much stress, afterwards. Mebbe a local con instead... and the RenFest. Then again, those might be out, too, if I can't work enough to affo... Y'no, there's a definite problem w/the typical American outlook. Work is not supposed to be the beginning and the end, and definitely not the all.
<br /><br />excerpt from 12/7/09, entry 1
<br />Sooo... if I got rid of the van &amp; paid off the credit cards... i conceivably could pay the bills on one income. However, less than 35 hours a week makes the SRS unhappy, so would most likely lose food stamps. This would increase grocery outlay... but I can make bread and we can grow veggies. If the garden is tended, because people are home to tend it, it should produce more. We can also go to Help House once a month, and get commodities.
<br />... ... ... But, really, what's more important, hey?
<br /><br />12/7/2009 entry, almost entire
<br />Responsibility. That's... two little boys. Well, one not so little anymore, and showing the proof of a lack of parenting. Why? Because there is no father in the family, and the mother has been &quot;must bring in the money&quot; more years than she's been &quot;raise the children&quot;.
<br /><br />In other words, she looked more towards the financial responsibility, and less at the parenting responsibility. The elder child went through 6 daycares/sitters, one related sitter, and several years of public school. the younger had two sitters, one related sitter, and a couple years of school. The lack of constancy shows.
<br /><br />So, what must the mother do, at this apparently late date, to fix the problems that have risen from focusing too much on financial responsibility? Note that financical responsibility can also be viewd as provision of food, shelter, clothing, etc. These, the children have. However, they do not understand the concept of familial responsibility, personal accountability, or self-discipline. Actually, discipline may be a foreign concept, as it has been sporadic and of less than adequate levels.
<br /><br />How can she make these &quot;new&quot; concepts a part of their lives? Her children often call their grandmother &quot;Mom&quot; because she was around, while their mother was working. Now, she is still working. Now, she is working only one part-time job with set, stable hours. Before, she worked two or more jobs with variable hours, often working 60 hours a week, and being too exhausted to deal with anything when she was not at work.
<br /><br />Yet, there are still bills to pay. The job she has doesn't cover them all. If she cuts back on absolutely everything, she'll have just enough to make do. There will be no extras. No (edit 12/13 bought) presents for birthdays and Christmas. No new clothes unless she makes them - with material on hand, because buying more will be iffy at best. No eating out, no ordering pizza, no soda pop, no candies. And, she'll have no vehicle, when the nearest grocery and doctor are 8 miles away. The boys won't be able to play sports (edit 12/13 unless it is budgeted well in advance).
<br /><br />If she looks for and succeeds in finding another job, the children are &quot;second best&quot; yet again, because the responsibility to the job that must be had for the income comes before them.
<br /><br />An' I don't wanna do that no more. My dreams never included not being the one raising my kids. (Course, they never included the financial end, or being a single mom.) It's not like I can't make do on around $600 a month, either. I've done it before, on $400. It's not like I can't raise a garden, some rabbits in the backyard, or a couple chickens on the front porch. It's not like I've never gone everywhere I need to go on foot or a bicycle, either, even with the kids.
<br /><br />Sure, my credit rating will get pissed on, badly. It's already shitty, so I suppose that wouldn't matter all that much. Frankly, i don't want another job. I like the one I have. I like that I've had time to clean the house. I like that I've had time to spend with the kids. I work in the town I live in: I'm not going to missing having a vehicle all that much. And if I do get a bike (and new trailer), it's not like I can't get out of town. Plus, no gas expense or car insurance, and a lot more healthy exercise. I've got time to cook, to bake. And I like that.
<br /><br />So, yeah, I'll have to give up some stuff. But in the end, which is more important? Stuff or the kids? That be the kids. My primary responsibility. It's well past time I treated 'em that way.
<br /><br />12/13/09
<br />Today's lesson at Sunday School was Luke 12:13-34.
<br /><br />And, I realized something. I've been praying for time for my family. I've got that, now. So, I'm wondering if God has granted that, but the payment for time is the van I won't need nearly so much as I would working out of town.
<br /><br />Thoughts?

True, the financial setback did have a couple unwelcome repercussions, but physically, I've been feeling better.
<br /><br />So I'm in pure pout mode that I woke up this morning to discover my hands (left worse than right) have decided to swell up. They were hurty last night, now it looks like the left is trying to imitate some kind of bizarre sausage ball with sausage rolls, and the right is just puffy.
<br /><br />I can type okay, but attempting to make a fist? Oh, noes. Likewise for fully extending and stretching fingers. Seriously annoying, and hasn't happened for .... *stares off into space* Yeah, it hasn't happened since about a month after I lost that job, which makes it just over a year.
<br /><br />Utterly unfair. And, I got no chocolates for Chocolate Day (aka Valentine's Day or Single's Awareness Day). I am deprived.

The major difference between since I lost that job to what happened just prior to the ballooning? Pop. Non-clear pop. First time I'd bought myself any in over a year, and lemme tell ya, ain't doin' that again! Which sucks, because I happen to like soda on occasion. Howsomever, since I'm still waiting for the last of the swelling to go down, screw the soda. I like non-sausage roll fingers better.
<br /><br />The weather is... spastic. Day before yesterday, it was 70+ degrees, so I did laundry and hung it out before I took myself off to work.
<br /><br />Yesterday? High 60's, low 70's. Cleared out the big garden, got the boys to clear their plots, started the tilling, grilled hotdogs, more laundry, and just generally outdoor worked.
<br /><br />This morning? Cloudy, cool. Low 60's, I'm guessing. Finished up the laundry and the tilling of the big garden. Finished raking out the garlic patch and tilled part of it up. Vampires are probably going to avoid my back yard for the next couple days! Oh, I need to go collect the bulbs I dug up, oops! Cleaned the cultivator up and stuck it back in the shed, got the grill going, started a couple meatloafs, and got the burgers on the grill.
<br /><br />AH! MEATLOAF! *hustles to make sure the covered, cooling one has not been catified* Okay, it's safe in the freezer now. Pumpkin left it alone. Where was I? Right! Marked out the walking paths for the garden - it's divided out into 4' wide very long runs, and I'll see about making those into proper raised beds later.
<br /><br />Still waiting to hear from the city about Kiddo's request to have chickens for 4H. Idiots on the council a couple years back decided our dinky little town couldn't have chickens in the back yard anymore. It's an election year. I intend to talk to a few of the people who have &quot;So &amp; So for City Council&quot; signs. *grins* Two of 'em can't get away - they've got 'em posted on their businesses! And I'll have a better idea of who I actually want to vote for. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/4185//smilies/tongue.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />Anyway, the burgers came off the grill just as it started to sprinkle, and I'm putting the temperature at 40something right now. BLETCH. It's supposed to snow Monday.
<br /><br />Weather is so weird.

Made the little one pretty for his class pictures - sadly, I guess Mom did not get the shot I sent of him before I got his hair done. Swept the floor, made a tablecloth, prettied up the table with said new tablecloth, started more laundry to hang on the line, and was attacked by clouds. They went in the dryer. Naturally, about halfway through the cycle, the clouds went away. Checked the weather. Reasonably decent. Added more laundry to washer. Tried to kill myself with a boiled egg in there somewhere.
<br /><br />Went outside, grabbed garden rake. Proceeded to arrange tomato cages where I decided to have tomatos, and plant the peas in the other cages (they work well as trellises). Scraped the ground a little more and tossed in some radish (2 kinds) and turnip seeds. Proceeded, having finished with that section, to work on trying to get the stupid walkway lined up properly. It's better than it was, and the beds are starting to look more like the raised beds I meant for them to be. Finishing the fix of paths will now have to wait until tomorrow afternoon, weather permitting, since it will require the help of a chibi, and I am getting ready to fix something to eat and go to work.

<br /><br />Anyways, I packed up and got to the lake just after noon on Friday. If chibi hadn't had a swimming lesson, we'd've been out there by 5 on Thursday, but whatever. Set up camp at the very best site closest to the bathrooms and the free drinking water. We got one with a fire pit, a grill, and the cooking counter along with the obligatory picnic table. Much joy!
<br /><br />Then, kid blew up the inflatable raft that is nearly as old as he is. Went down to the water, got in, kid insisted on rowing. Me, I have no problem with that. I have learned that I hate inflatable rowboats, but he adored the silly thing. So, we get out there, and I catch a fish! No idea what it was, but it was shiny iridescent silvery white.
<br /><br />Of course, we got caught by the current and the wind, and the boat springs a leak. This was unhappy-izing, and the fact that I have learnt cuss words became quite obvious. Kiddo finally got us close enough to shore that he could jump out and pull the boat, walking, because I'd lost my balance and was busy trying not to fall out the back or lose my glasses trying to get myself back upright. I need to snag me some of those glasses holders...
<br /><br />Anyway, did some swimming, collected a bit of wood, hauled butt back to the camp, and set up the grill for cooking the fish. Naturally, this is when I discover I forgot to bring knives. This necessitated a trip to the nearby bait shop, which had a bait knife that doubled as a scaling knife, but no fillet knife. Since I also realized I had failed to bring bread, we headed for the convenience store down the highway a bit.
<br /><br /><img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/4185//smilies/backstage/bigsmile.gif" alt=":)" /> They had the mini pecan pies and chocolate pudding. I snagged some. Plus what I'd gone there to get. Went back to camp, scaled the fish, gutted the sucker, got it wrapped in tinfoil and lit the grill. Then... waited... for... it... to... cook. And waited, and waited, turning it now and then to assure doneness and whimpering because it was LOOKING at me. I hate fish with heads on, and will figure out how to get the head off next time. But, when the coals finally died, the fish was still not done. It was, in fact, COLD in the middle, and it had been over the grill on a 100+ degree day with 110+ heat index.
<br /><br />We ate potted meat sandwiches &amp; some other stuff because the back up hamburger plan fell through. It was still frozen solid in the cooler. That stuff didn't finish defrosting until after the Harvest Moon was well up in the sky, and I'd taken it out around 7!
<br /><br />Had the bonfire going when Tim stopped by for awhile. He took the boys down to the old bridge for an hour and a half of fishing while I cleaned up the supper mess. They didn't even get nibbles, so the chibis went to bed (in their own tents!) disappointed. Kid spent the night in his tent, Bitty wound up in mine by morning. He wants to be a big boy so bad, but he hates sleeping by himself! First thing he said was &quot;Happy birthday, Mommy!&quot;
<br /><br />We started with Gerber rice cereal for breakfast, and the boys had an egg each, with coffee, not too long after the sun came up. Then we went fishing, but it didn't take long for it to be too hot where we were, so we all traipsed back to the camp.
<br /><br />Kid remembered to tell me &quot;happy birthday&quot;, and we celebrated with the little pecan pies. Kid then realized it was computer time, and proceeded to run down his battery while Bitty and I went back down to the lake. Bitty swam, I watched fish feed and splash all around my bobbers. Didn't get a nibble!
<br /><br />Then we sat around and just kinda did the dozing in the shade thing until we decided we were hungry and needed lunch. Hamburgers! Applesauce. Chocolate pudding. Something else that is slipping through my memory. Then clean up and more dozing until we all decided to go swimming again. I took the pole, stood out in water up to my shoulders, and fished there! No nibblies, still.
<br /><br />Hunted for wood, didn't find much, but the people who'd been swimming with us had offered to bring by some pallets. They did, and we burnt one of them up for our bonfire after a Hamburgery supper. This time, the boys slept in the back of the truck, and I slept in my tent.
<br /><br />What is it about camping that kinda demands that when the sun comes up, you can no longer sleep? So, got up at sunrise (with the pictures to prove it on my camera), and started breakfast. Sugarless coffee is nasty. Sugarless rice cereal is just as bad! Kids used up all the sugar before I got to the table!
<br /><br />Packing up took awhile, even though the boys had taken down their tents the night before. We made it back home just as everyone was pulling out of the church driveway, so we missed the service I thought we'd make. All we unloaded was food and dirty clothes, then we hit Gma's AC.
<br /><br />And that was the birthday trip.

I'm kinda excited though, seems like I might possibly be able to get net at home! But, you know, got to wait another couple weeks to find out for sure. Of course then I'll never sleep (again!), and I'll be chronically tired and cranky (wait, that's different from normal HOW<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/4185//smilies/unsure.gif" alt=":)" />, but fun! I hope.
<br /><br />Meh, we'll see. Hi to everyone!

It's the first time I'll have been to this one - it's only about a hundred miles away, so I'm really wondering why I only first heard about it year before last? yeah. Anyway, going!
<br /><br />Not so thrilled about 6 peoples (all strangers) in one hotel room, but it's a shared $35, so that's okay.

Then loverly things happened: 1) I found out I'd be able to afford a one day pass; my state refund came in; and Mom suggested I spend the entire weekend at Kon - kid free because she was volunteering to watch them.
<br /><br />And, from previous facebook posts, everyone knows it took me a whopping day to find a hotel room, and a few more hours after that to snag a ride. Adam was a lovely child, drove out of his way to pick me up and take me home. Angel's gramma is to be blessed for providing the hotel room, and Jasper for shuttling between hotel and con.
<br /><br />Next year, though, I'm getting my own room, due to the fact that after I got home, both kids demanded to know why they'd been left behind (even though the older one had said he didn't want to go!). And I'm not getting anyplace on the wrong side of Metcalf - there is no way I'm crossing that thing at 2am. We'll be at the Sheraton attached to the convention center, or as close as possible to it. Considering how nice the staff was, I'm opting for the Sheraton. Which I think I'm spelling wrong.
<br /><br />Ah, yes. This means I will require a different vehicular object. Right. I'll find one.
<br /><br />Anyhow! Back to the con, lemme see. Got registered to late to hit the mask making panel, which sucked because it meant I wouldn't be able to go to the masquerade. However, Angel had a spare and loaned it to me, so I went! I can now do the box step part of the waltz quite well, but I'm not good at turning and can't do the fancy steps without tripping over myself. Danced with two staff ladies, two staff gentlemen, and about five other gentlemen. Managed to get my dance card filled, but didn't get drawn to be Princess or Queen. Also missed the BLOOD STAIN CHILD concert due to being in line for registration.
<br /><br />There was nothing after the waltz but the Dance Party (more commonly referred to as the Rave), which I wandered in and out of, because while I don't mind techno, I object to not being able to easily tell when the song changes. Several hours of the same Energizer Bunny beat with rare appearances of lyrics isn't much fun for me.
<br /><br />Then, back to the hotel. 8 peoples in my room, and I had a bed to myself. Oddly, I didn't mind that much. There were 6 girls, 2 boys the first night, and dropped a girl the second night.
<br /><br />Day 2. Let's see, woke up, ate hotel's continental breakfast that included make-em'yourself waffles, piled into the car. Where's my sheet? Ah. Missed the guest signings and BJD:WTF? panels in order to go shopping - found a corset! see photos! Dropped in on the Music &amp; Fashion, got bored, left, decided the bags were heavy, called a cab, took them to the hotel, found out that having her take me back could have been a $20 ride because it was technically two trips and it was $10 minimum for any rides under 5 miles (she charged me for one trip), did the DYOD, did some more shopping, went to the Vampires DON'T Sparkle panel (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!) and got pulled out of it because my lunch showed up (at 5:30 or so), and ate it fast so I could hit the DNAngel fan panel.
<br /><br />Dark wound up co-hosting (see pics, (these are on facebook right now, I'll get them here later) he was so sweet!), and then the Jasper hunt began. Went back to the hotel to change clothes because loverly corset was of the ow by then, got back and was trying to decide between panels (the fun ones were starting) but found out that the Bleach panel and English VA signings had been switched, and that you had to sit through the panel to get the autographs, so parked my behind in a seat. I got Quinton to do me a Reno bit on video, and he signed my badge. (Bleach forum, but he's the English VA for Reno from FFVII and Axel of Kingdom Hearts II). I know it was an hour from the time the gal next to me asked &quot;how much longer do you think it will take&quot; to the time that we made it up to the signing table, and we'd been waiting probably an hour by then.
<br /><br />Rave for a bit, hotel.
<br /><br />Day 3... missed the BLOOD STAINED CHILD photoshoot/signing, both VA panels, and the Lolita Tea because we didn't manage to get out of the hotel until just before noon when we had to check out. This is partly because of how long it took to get the corset fastened and tightened, but me and the girl who tightened it... L? they called her L the whole time... were ready to go by 10:30. We expected to be at the con shortly thereafter, but we were not of the having of personal vehicles, and were at the mercy of those who did. Taxi was considered, but rejected due to the fact that by the time the cab would have arrived, the drivers would appear in the lobby.
<br /><br />Bags were then checked at the Sheraton (I am spelling that wrong) Shereton? Sheriton? Huh. Dunno. Anyhow, checked the bags there - I told you the staff was nice! - and split for the con. Made it in time to do Quinton's Q&amp;A. Incidentally, he did get asked why he signs autographs with Lucifer, and he solemnly swore that it said Quinton, because if he could sign 'Lucifer' he'd have the power to make us do all kinds of stuff. (It looks like Lucifer.)
<br /><br />The Death Note fan panel was next, but I didn't stay for all of it. Went and watched some of the animes on offer instead, did some more shopping, managed to pick up a wizard and made him an honorary member of my court (which won't make sense to anyone who is related to me, but that's probably for the best), dropped the bags off with the rest of my luggage, found a cheeseburger, hit the closing ceremony, and got ready to come home. In my con clothes.
<br /><br />And honestly, I expected a lot more comments on the last post I made from con on facebook, considering I said I wouldn't be back online until I was wearing non-con clothes.
