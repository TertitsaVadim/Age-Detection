<br />People are unreasonable,illogical and selfcentered.
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/love.gif" alt=":)" /> LOVE THEM ANYWAY.
<br />If you do good,people will accuse you of selfish ulterior motives.
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" /> DO GOOD ANYWAY.
<br />If you are successful,you will win false friends and true enemies.
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" />SUCCEED ANYWAY. 
<br />Honesty and frankness make you vulnerable.
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" /> BE HONEST AND FRANK ANYWAY.
<br />The good you do today will be forgotten tomorrow.
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" />DO GOOD ANYWAY.
<br />The biggest people with the biggest ideas can be shot
<br /> down by the smallest people with the smallest minds. 
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/thumbsup.gif" alt=":)" /> THINK BIG ANYWAY.
<br />People favor underdogs but follow only top dogs.
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" />FIGHT FOR SOME UNDERDOGS ANYWAYS.
<br />What you spent years building may be destroyed overnight.
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" /> BUILD ANYWAY.

<br />with tears for us to mend.
<br /><br />I brought my broken dreams to God,
<br />because He was my friend.
<br /><br />But then,instead of leaving Him
<br />in peace to work alone,
<br /><br />I hung around and tried to help
<br />with ways that were my own.
<br /><br />At last I snatched them back and cried,
<br />&quot;How can you be so slow?&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;My child,&quot; He said,&quot;What could I do?
<br />You never did let go.&quot;

<br />To weep is to risk appearing sentimental.
<br />To reach for another is to risk involvement.
<br />To expose your feelings is to risk exposing your true self.
<br />To place your ideas,your dreams,before a crowd is to risk their loss.
<br />To love is to risk not being loved in return.
<br />To live is to risk dying.
<br />To believe is to risk despair.
<br />To try is to risk failure.
<br />But risks must be taken,because the greatest hazard i life is to risk nothing.
<br />The people who risk nothing,do nothing,have nothing,are nothing.
<br />They may avoid suffering and sorrow,but they cannot learn,feel,change,grow.love.live.
<br />Chained by their attitudes they are slaves,they have forfeited their freedom.
<br />Only a person who risks and takes up responsibility is free.
<br /><br />So when faced with a problem....
<br />DARE to try.
<br />Dare to love.So when faced with a problem....
<br />DARE to try.
<br />Dare to love.
<br />Dare to make a commitment.
<br />Dare to take a risk .
<br />If u don't dare to take a risk,you'll never get ahead.
<br />You'll never solve ur your problems.
<br />Dare to make a commitment.
<br />Dare to take a risk .
<br />If u don't dare to take a risk,you'll never get ahead.
<br />You'll never solve ur your problems.

<br />Nobody is a total failure if he dares to try to do something worthwhile.
<br />Never let a problem become an excuse.
<br />God's delays are not God's denials.
<br />Today's decisions are tomorrow's realities.
<br />The one battle most people lose is the battle over the fear of failure...
<br />                try...
<br />                start...
<br />                 begin...
<br />and you'll be assured ,you won the first round.
