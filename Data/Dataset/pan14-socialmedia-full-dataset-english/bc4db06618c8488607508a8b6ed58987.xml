<br /><br />PART ONE: (THE DISOBEDIENT)
<br />On the third day of the sixth month two thousand and twelve was I EKINI Sixtus O. the least in a vision when His Excellency-Jesus Christ the KING of kings and LORD of lords, did took me to a visit to the lake of fire He opened my eyes and I saw a man who killed innocent people while he was on earth,
<br />In a pity condition was he alone in that burning lake of flame crying for
<br />1. Mercy 
<br />And 
<br />2. Forgiveness 
<br />With all plead yet his cry was not heard for he had opportunities to hear God word and to be converted but he let go such a golden opportunities through his disobedient before he died. 
<br /><br />PART TWO: (AGENT OF DARKNESS)
<br />A woman in her car went to one of his brother who was a pastor on earth, she’s an agent of darkness from the pit of hell, her mission was to entice the pastor so that he should destroy innocent lives.
<br />While the woman was yet speaking with the pastor the man in lake called him so the pastor went some steps off from her car, the man told him how he is suffering in the burning flame in the lake, just because of  his disobedient and bad conduct while he was on earth, these man speaks a Yoruba’s local language. 
<br />Though these pastor did not see that his brother while he was speaking to him from the burning flame in the lake of fire but he was hearing his voice and he knew that it was his late brother speaking to him, but the man in the lake of fire was perceiving the events that was going-on by then on the earth, he told the pastor not to listen to that woman. 
<br /><br />PART THREE: (YOU CANT OVER RUN GOD)
<br />When the pastor came back to the woman he said “excuse me I was reflecting” he began to ask her what she was saying before? She was stammering to answer him, he asked her where is your husband? Yet stammering , he should have been with you but you let him suffer in anguish! Replied pastor. What do you think can happen to you? He asked her, she became so confused yet stammering, to go crazy and run around the streets! The pastor replied, After some shocking questions the pastor asked her instead of asking God for pardon and turn away from her wicked way she drove away from the pastor with fear, I lifted up my eyes and saw her pursuing people on the street as do the crazy people. 
<br /><br />PART FOUR: (THE FALSE PROPHET)
<br />He was mislead and he also mislead many, those he mislead was busy going through pang of  conscience which can not make any change for them to come out of that eternal damnation, 
<br />The false prophet was so busy to repent from his evil ways then he suddenly found himself in the burning flame in the lake of fire, and before him was bones of people he destroyed, he also begin to ask for 
<br />1.Mercy 
<br />And 
<br />2.Forgivess
<br />In the burning flame in the lake of fire, but no sign of answer to him, it not a place to dream of staying not even for a second in your live because no miracle that will get you out of there! Once there forever there, no mercy nor forgiveness for those that stays there
<br /><br />PART FIVE: (THE IGNORANT )
<br />I saw a young beautiful lady pleading for 
<br />1.Mercy 
<br />And 
<br />2.Forgiveness 
<br />in the burning flame, not long I saw her on earth as if God allowed her to come back on earth to correct her past error.
<br />when she appeared some where along the street she was standing before a list of  a certain group of people that she wronged and destroyed before her departure on earth, then instead of  asking Jesus to forgive her when she got that little opportunity to come back on earth, she was staring at those lists  before her in sorrow of what she did.
<br /><br />I saw her in a best suite but not long hell appeared up with those burning flame which I saw and two black strong force dragged her back into the burning flame in hell and she was saying as they were dragging her I want to ask for forgiveness she replied, she was repeating the same word as they dragged her with them but none paid her any attention.
<br /><br />The LORD is ready to forgive you now if you can ask Him to forgive you and to save you from your sins today.
<br />I implore the mercies and the forgiveness of  God upon you

<br />by Ekini Sixtus on Monday, May 21, 2012 at 10:43am ·
<br /><br />THE VOICE OF TVCW:
<br /><br />&amp;quot;Though the below sentences does not match enough my experience while i was creating our Christian Association TVCW/LVCD N° 0832&amp;quot;
<br /><br />There was a young volunteer named (EKINI Sixtus Ogubuike) who took a live journey of human help, the journey was long enough out of his imagination, he has been so helpful to humanity to the extent of giving even his last widow’s mite.
<br /><br />The journey led him to a land of no habitation in a lost desert while seeking for those to help,
<br /><br />Those that pass by in the desert looking for help got it from him, he share’s his properties with them his bread and water did he not refrain from them, he became
<br /><br />1.Homeless while seeking for the homeless,
<br /><br />2.Hunger while seeking for the hunger to feed,
<br /><br />3.Hopeless while seeking for the hopeless,
<br /><br />4.Destitude while seeking for the destitude.
<br /><br />some of his best friends was the hot sun and hot sands including the mighty wild winds,no water to quench his thirst, food became once in a dream, his clothe became the desert rag tore-up all over, he became lost in the lost desert those that pass by do not recognize who he was for he became like one of those that dweels in the desert but no home for him,
<br /><br />dangerous animal almost caught him time without number.
<br /><br />Ooh who can help the good child in the lost desert?
<br /><br />Ooh who can help him still accomplish his good service of human help?
<br /><br />The world need some one like him who can give all their best just to rescue other, it not yet late for you to be a good volunteer for it must take you something before you have something, get involve and volunteer yourself  a human help service pass the message to other near &amp;amp; far.

<br /><br />*dad and mom will not be brought to judgement for your sin every one will be judged according to his/her did, so if you are depending on dad's salvation push it off and ask dad to show you the way how he made it then after that both of you will walk collectively the heavenly race,
