Dont get me wrong im not an alcholic but i do love a gud drink it seems to numb the sadness in my life that is until the morning after. Y is it that when u drunk u havent got a care in the world but the nxt day i feel like shit regret wat i did n said to some ppl ( i can be quite rude to ppl when im drunk so im told!)
<br />Thing that gets me is the state some ppl dress when they go out have they not got good friends who tell them they like hideous n shouldnt wear that short top with all the rolls on show! Im not a nasty person but me n my m8s r honest with each other if we dont look right we tell each other coz other ppl r bound notice coz i do!
<br />Men can i ask u a question? Y on earth do some of u deem it fit to wear WHITE socks! My god its a major no no! If me n my m8s notice any1 wearin white socks im sorry but we abuse them as they r twat socks! Especially if they r worn under trousers which if we honest r too short n need to go in the bin! 
<br />God im far frm perfect but wat i ensure is that i look as gud as i can n have a gr8 night with the best bunch of m8s any girl cud ask 4! Ilove them all loads x

Theres no way i was kissin with mornin breath God no way! pls remember i had been clubbin so was dressed in those clothes....... denim skirt (short) tights black tight top n fuck where were my boots! eventually we got up n i had to walk downstairs (still no boots!) he lives in a terrace 2  so the stairs arent friendly 2 some1 who is still pissed. i opened the door at the bottom of the stairs n the smell of a fry up hit me .... fuck me i felt sick! Thats not the worse of it his m8 n gf were sittin there glarin at me (prob coz i woke them up shuting in my sleep) wat do u say to them..... me i just asked if they had seen my boots! lol.

I mean its not like when u buy a pair of shoes u try them on n if they fit u buy them! Then again now i think about it its probably right that finding the right 1 is like buyin a pair of shoes especially my type of men i fall 4! i h8 the comfy pair of slippers the good old dependable pair that r always there i like the pair of shoes that need to be broken in. At 1st they give u blisters but after a while u know they will be right but then they get to comfy n u have to replace them!
<br />C i was thinkin that my way of thinkin will never really help me as i get through too many pairs of shoes n 1 day i will throw away the wrong pair. 
<br />HOW DO U KNOW!
