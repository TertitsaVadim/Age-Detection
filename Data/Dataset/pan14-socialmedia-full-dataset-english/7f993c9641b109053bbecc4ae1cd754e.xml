<br /><br />I was an onion before Christ set me free.
<br />Layers upon layers of iniquity.
<br />An ugly old onion whose fragrance was strong;
<br />That my Jesus bought and loved all along.
<br /><br />Unknown to me what He was going to do.
<br />Of what He was planning, I had not a clue.
<br />Pulling each layer off one by one.
<br />In order to make me more like Jesus the Son.
<br /><br />The first layer wasn't so bad.
<br />I saw all the sins that I knew I had.
<br />They were easy to fix, just change the way I talk.
<br />And learn more of how He wanted me to walk.
<br /><br />Reading His Word, and learning again;
<br />How to put aside my life of sin.
<br />But the next layer was pulled which hurt more.
<br />He was getting closer to the core.
<br /><br />Unknown what He would find there.
<br />I simply gave it to Him in prayer.
<br />As another layer was removed, He started to cry;
<br />Pulling this layer brought pain to my Father on High.
<br /><br />And I was crying over the sadness I felt;
<br />The brokenness and all of the guilt.
<br />Past memories that I thought were gone;
<br />They were buried under layers disguised in a fragrance so strong.
<br /><br />As onions peel more and more;
<br />And they put tears in our eyes as we get close to the core;
<br />So my father wept over my pain;
<br />Giving me a balm of comfort and strength to sustain.
<br /><br />&quot;NO MORE LAYERS.&quot; I would scream.
<br />As he continued to peel them off of me.
<br />&quot;I'll have nothing left my Lord, what will I do?
<br />I'll be nothing but a worthless core to you. &quot;
<br /><br />But He just said &quot;Trust me,&quot; and continued to peel
<br />I was sure He was blinded to my pain that was so real.
<br />Year after year I shrunk more and more;
<br />Until all that was left of this onion was a core.
<br /><br />It was then that I began to understand;
<br />As the Lord embraced me in His loving hand.
<br />He said, now and only now can you be;
<br />The creation that will minister before me.
<br /><br />Clothed with the righteousness only from above;
<br />Gone are your layers of self so you can be filled with my love.
<br />He took my layers of sin, hurt and pain;
<br />And clothed me with love, truth and mercy in His name.
<br /><br />Yes, we are all onions, learning with each day;
<br />How to overcome as each layer is taken away.
<br />Some layers tear and pull at our heart;
<br />While others grieve us to our innermost part.
<br /><br />But we are nothing but an ugly onion without Christ.
<br />Layers upon layers of pride, sin and strife.
<br />Only God can take those layers away.
<br />And clothe us with His righteousness in that final day.

<br /><br />God's Boxes
<br /><br />I have in my hands two boxes, 
<br />Which God gave me to hold. 
<br />He said, &quot;Put all your sorrows in the black box, 
<br />And all your joys in the gold.&quot;
<br /><br />I heeded His words, and in the two boxes, 
<br />Both my joys and sorrows I stored, 
<br />But though the gold became heavier each day, 
<br />The black was as light as before. 
<br /><br />With curiosity, I opened the black, 
<br />I wanted to find out why, 
<br />And I saw, in the base of the box, a hole, 
<br />Which my sorrows had fallen out by. 
<br /><br />I showed the hole to God, and mused, 
<br />&quot;I wonder where my sorrows could be!&quot; 
<br />He smiled a gentle smile and said, 
<br />&quot;My child, they're all here with me..&quot; 
<br /><br />I asked God, why He gave me the boxes, 
<br />Why the gold and the black with the hole? 
<br />&quot;My child, the gold is for you to count your blessings, 
<br />The black is for you to let go.&quot; 
<br /><br />We should consider all of our friends a blessing. 
<br />Send this to a friend today just to let them know you 
<br />are thinking of them and that they are a joy in your life. 
<br /><br />A ball is a circle, no beginning, no end. 
<br />It keeps us together like our Circle of Friends. 
<br />But the treasure inside for you to see, 
<br />Is the treasure of friendship you've granted to me. 
<br /><br />Today I share the friendship ball to you. 
<br />share to someone who is a friend to you...

<br /><br />Once upon a time, there was an island where all the feelings lived: Happiness, Sadness, Knowledge, and all of the others are including Love. One day it was announced to the feelings that the island would sink, so all repaired their boats and left.
<br /><br />Love wanted to persevere until the last possible moment. When the island was almost sinking, Love decided to ask for help. Richness was passing by Love in a grand boat. Love said, &quot;Richness, can you take me with you?&quot; Richness answered, &quot;No, I can't. There is a lot of gold and silver in my boat. There is no place here for you.
<br /><br />Love decided to ask Vanity who was also passing by in a beautiful vessel, &quot;Vanity, please help me!&quot; &quot;I can't help you Love. You are all wet and might damage my boat.&quot; Vanity answered.
<br /><br />Sadness was close by so Love asked for help, &quot;Sadness, let me go with you.&quot; &quot;Oh....Love, I am so sad that I need to be by myself!&quot;
<br /><br />Happiness passed by Love too, but he was so happy that she did not even hear when Love called her!
<br /><br />Suddenly, there was a voice, &quot;Come Love, I will take you.&quot; It was an elder. Love felt so blessed and overjoyed that he even forgot to ask the elder his name. When they arrived at dry land, the elder went his own way.
<br /><br />Love realizing how much he owed the elder and asked Knowledge, another elder, &quot;Who helped me?&quot; &quot;It was Time,&quot; Knowledge answered. &quot;Time?&quot; asked Love. &quot;But why did Time help me?&quot; Knowledge smiled with deep wisdom and answered, &quot;Because, only Time is capable of understanding how great Love is.&quot;

<br /><br />Many years ago in a small Indian village,
<br /><br />A farmer had the misfortune Of owing a large sum of money to a village moneylender. 
<br /><br />The Moneylender, who was old and ugly, fancied the farmer's beautiful Daughter. So he proposed a bargain.
<br /><br />He said he would forgo the farmer's debt if he could marry his Daughter. Both the farmer and his daughter were horrified by the Proposal.
<br /><br />So the cunning money-lender suggested that they let Providence decide the matter. 
<br /><br />He told them that he would put a black Pebble and a white pebble into an empty money bag. Then the girl would Have to pick one pebble from the bag.
<br /><br />1) If she picked the black pebble, she would become his wife and her father's debt would be forgiven.
<br /><br />2) If she picked the white pebble she need not marry him and her father's debt would still be forgiven.
<br /><br />3) But if she refused to pick a pebble, her father would be thrown into Jail.
<br /><br />They were standing on a pebble strewn path in the farmer's field. As They talked, the moneylender bent over to pick up two pebbles. As he Picked them up, the sharp-eyed girl noticed that he had picked up two Black pebbles and put  them into the bag.
<br /><br />He then asked the girl to pick A pebble from the bag.
<br /><br />Now, imagine that you were standing in the field. What would you have Done if you were the girl? If you had to advise her, what would you Have told her?
<br /><br />Careful analysis would produce three possibilities:
<br /><br />1. The girl should refuse to take a pebble.
<br /><br />2. The girl should show that there were two black pebbles in the bag And expose the money-lender as a cheat.
<br /><br />3. The girl should pick a black pebble and sacrifice herself in order To save her father from his debt and imprisonment.
<br /><br />Take a moment to ponder over the story. The above story is used with The hope that it will make us appreciate the difference between lateral And logical thinking.
<br /><br />The girl's dilemma cannot be solved with Traditional logical thinking. Think of the consequences if she chooses
<br /><br />The above logical answers.
<br /><br />What would you recommend to the Girl to do?
<br /><br />Well, here is what she did ....
<br /><br />The girl put her hand into the moneybag and drew out a pebble. Without Looking at it, she fumbled and let it fall onto the pebble-strewn path Where it immediately became lost among all the other pebbles.
<br /><br />&quot;Oh, how clumsy of me,&quot; she said. &quot;But never mind, if you look into the Bag for the one that is left, you will be able to tell which pebble I Picked.&quot;
<br /><br />Since the remaining pebble is black, it must be assumed that she had Picked the white one. And since the money-lender dared not admit his Dishonesty, the girl changed what seemed an impossible situation into An extremely advantageous one.
<br /><br />MORAL OF THE STORY:
<br /><br />Most complex problems do have a solution. It is only that we don't Attempt to think.

<br /><br />I ask God to take away a habit.
<br />God said, No.
<br /><br />It is not for me to take away, but for you to give it up.
<br /><br />I ask God to make my handicapped child whole.
<br /><br />God said, No.
<br />His spirit is whole, his body is only temporary
<br /><br />I asked God to grant me patience.
<br />God said, No.
<br />Patience is  a by product of tribulations;
<br />it isn’t granted, it is learned..
<br />I asked God to give me happiness.
<br />God said, No.
<br />I give you blessing; Happiness is up to you.
<br /><br />I asked God to spare me pain.

<br />Suffering draws you apart from worldly cares

But the other four balls – family, health, friends and spirit – are made of glass. If you drop one of these, they will be irrevocably scuffed, marked, nicked, damaged or even shattered. They will never be the same. You must understand that – and strive for balance in your life. How?
<br />?	Don’t undermine your worth by comparing your self with others. It is because we are different that each of us is special.
<br />?	Don’t set your goals by what other people deem important. Only you know what is best for you.
<br />?	Don’t take for granted the things closest to your heart. Cling to them as you would your life, for without them, life is meaning-less.
<br />?	Don’t let your life slip through your fingers by living in the past or for the future. By living your life one day at a time, you live ALL the days of your life.
<br />?	Don’t give up when you still have something to give. Nothing is really over until the moment you stop trying.
<br />?	Don’t be afraid to admit that you are less than perfect. It is this fragile thread that binds us to each other.
<br />?	Don’t be afraid to encounter risks.
<br />?	The quickest way to receive love is to give; the fastest way to lose love is to hold it too tightly; and the best way to keep love is to give it wings.
<br />?	 Don’t run through life so fast that you forget riot only where you’ve been, but also where you are going.
<br />?	Don’t forget, a person’s greatest emotional need is to feel appreciated.
<br />?	Don’t be afraid to learn. Knowledge is weightless, a treasure you can always carry easily.
<br />?	Don’t use time or words carelessly. Neither can be retrieved.
<br />?	Life is not a race, but a journey to be savored each step of the way.
<br />?	Yesterday is History, Tomorrow is a Mystery and Today is a gift: that’s why we call it The Present.”
<br />?	Have A nice Day… Jesus Love’s You c”,)

<br /><br />Sometimes when I feel the life , 
<br />At the brink of my throat
<br />Overwhelming, I feel my vision blur
<br />As I curse the curs
<br />Deep within, that in the guise, 
<br />Of love as wealth
<br />Tore my soul, From myself
<br />And crumble my mumbling health
<br />Turned sober from life?
<br />I beg to differ
<br />Life rammed itself into
<br />My stomach, Teeter
<br />Makes me feel like an, Old drunk
<br />These days you don't need a bottle
<br />To vomit, Or a syringe
<br />To feel withdrawal
<br />Sometimes life Is more than

<br /><br />The preacher, in his Sunday sermon, 
<br /><br />used &quot;Forgive Your Enemies&quot; as his subject.
<br /><br />After a long sermon, he asked how many were willing to forgive their enemies.
<br /><br />About half held up their hands. 
<br /><br />Not satisfied, he harangued for another twenty minutes and repeated his question. 
<br />This time he received a response of eighty percent.
<br /><br />Still unsatisfied, he lectured for fifteen minutes and repeated his question.
<br /><br />With thoughts of Sunday dinner, all responded except one old gentleman in the rear.
<br /><br />Mr. Jones, are you not willing to forgive your enemies?&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;I don't have any.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;Mr. Jones, that is very unusual. How old are you?&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;Eighty-six.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;Mr. Jones, please come down in front and tell the congregation how 
<br /><br />a man can live to be 86 and not have an enemy in the world.&quot;
<br /><br />The old man teetered down the aisle and slowly turned around. 
<br /><br />&quot;It's easy. I out lived 'em!&quot;

<br /><br />A flower grows from beneath a blanket
<br />Of fine and purest white
<br />It reaches toward the sun for warmth,
<br />For heat and for the light
<br /><br />My love for you grows stronger still,
<br />Despite the surrounding cold
<br />My heart is yours, bartered gone
<br />For yours has it been sold
<br /><br />Its petals shine from morning dew
<br />Its stem grows stiff and strong
<br />It stands strong through the freezing cold
<br />It stands the winter long
<br /><br />I long for you, for your soft touch
<br />I miss the way you smile
<br />The longer that we stay apart
<br />The longer every mile
<br /><br />The flower stretches through the snow
<br />It reaches toward the sun
<br />And now without you the color is gone
<br />The flower's petals, dun
<br /><br />But as we talk, and as we learn
<br />The flower comes back to life
<br />The snow now melts and goes away
<br />As you take away my strife
<br /><br />Spring is here and growth abounds
<br />As you and I are one
<br />We are together, we are in love
<br />The snow for now is done
<br /><br />I see the future, in dreams I have
<br />Of our life, long and true
<br />I see the times where all I need
<br />Are comforting words from you
<br /><br />I see the times when winter comes
<br />As winter tends to do
<br />But we still love, and we still live
<br />And I do still love you
<br /><br />And so we live, with children ours
<br />And a life of much to see
<br />With love we live, to live we love
<br />Happy together are we
<br /><br />I see the flower, older now,
<br />But still strong with fresh new leaves
<br />I see it growing, tall and strong
<br />Reaching to the eaves
<br /><br />We are now old, as years have passed
<br />But old together are we
<br />And strong our love still today
<br />As strong as it can be

<br />&quot;Death can not stop true love, it can only delay it for a little while.&quot;
<br />&quot;You attract people by the qualities you display. You keep them by the qualities you possess.&quot;
<br />&quot;Love can make you do things that you never thought possible!&quot;
<br />&quot;The best thing about loving and being hurt is that you get to know what true love really is. For as gold is tested in fire, and so will love be perfected in pain.&quot;
<br />&quot;True love can blind you but at the same time if you let it, it can also open your eyes.&quot;
<br />&quot;Love, an emotion so strong that you would give up everything. To just feel it once, to know that you are part of something special. To know that you can feel what love really is; to know, to feel, to love.&quot;
<br />&quot;No matter how ugly you think you are, that special someone that loves you believes you are the most beautiful and irresistable thing on earth and nothing can ever change that.&quot;
<br />&quot;Love and electricity are one in the same, my dear. If you do not feel the jolt in your soul every time a kiss is shared, a whisper is spoken, a touch is felt, then your not really in love at all.&quot;
<br />&quot;To love someone is to understand each other, to laugh together, to smile with your heart and to trust one another. One important thing is to let each other go if you can't do this.&quot;
<br /><br />If you have the courage to love, you have the courage to suffer.&quot;
<br />&quot;True love is just like rain; it touches us all.&quot;
<br />&quot;This kind of certainty comes, but once in a lifetime.&quot;
<br />&quot;True love is a wonder that has no end or beginning.&quot;
<br />&quot;In the arithmetic of love, one plus one equals everything, and two minus one equals nothing.&quot;
<br />&quot;Dans l'amour vrai c'est l'ame qui embrasse le corps.&quot;
<br />Translation: In true love it is the soul that embraces the body.
<br />&quot;If I don't know what true love is, how will I ever find it?&quot;
<br />&quot;Take away love and the earth is a tomb.&quot;
<br />&quot;True love is indescribable, yet self-explanatory.&quot;
<br />&quot;I do, cherish you, from the depths of my soul, it's beyond my control, I've waited so long, to say this to you, if you're asking do I love you this much, I do.&quot;
<br />&quot;If my love for you were water, it would be as vast as an ocean.&quot;
<br />&quot;This is true love. Do you think this happens everyday?&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;I've loved you all my life. Even before there was you there was the promise of you, and now that we've met, I'll never be the same!&quot;
<br />&quot;If it is not mutual it isn't love.&quot;
<br />&quot;True love doesn't just fill your heart, it overflows into your whole body and soul.&quot;
<br />&quot;Forever is not a word...rather a place where two lovers go when true love takes them there.&quot;
<br />&quot;True love cannot be found where it does not exist, nor can it be denied where it does.&quot;
<br />&quot;This is destiny so why pretend
<br />Close your eye's and kiss me once again.
<br />I'll always be the only one you'll need.
<br />So go where your deepest longing leads.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;True love doesn't have a happy ending because true love doesn't end.&quot;
<br />&quot;The purity and trueness of love through an Internet relationship far passes that of one based on physical contact.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;I want to stare into your eyes and never look away; I want you to hold me in your arms and tell me it's okay; I want to kiss with a passion that only we can share, and when it all falls down I want you to be there.&quot;
<br />&quot;When you're soaring through the air, I'll be your solid ground. Take every chance you dare, I'll still be there when you come back down.&quot;
<br />&quot;There is one pain I often feel, which you will never know. It's caused by the absence of you.&quot;
<br />&quot;I am thinking of you, In my sleepless solitude tonight. If it's wrong to love you, then my heart just won't let me be right. 'Cause I'm drowned in you, And I won't pull through, without you by my side.&quot;
<br />&quot;Remember that the truest love, is one where your love for each other is greater than your need for each other.&quot;
<br />&quot;Last night I looked up at the stars and matched each one with a reason why I love you. I was doing great until I ran out of stars.&quot;
<br />&quot;Love isn't love until you give it away, so give it wings and let it go, if it's meant to be it will fly right back to you!&quot;
<br />&quot;No matter how hard things seem, true love will aide you through it.&quot;
<br />&quot;When during sad times an angel should come to you, open your eyes and see who that angel is, for that is your one true love.&quot;
<br />&quot;Never underestimate the power because love can do miracles which you never thought possible.&quot;
<br />&quot;Love comes to those who wait for it, trust it and don't question it when it does finally come.&quot;
<br />&quot;Baby, I know we are miles and miles away from one another, but I always believed that as long as our souls are connected to each other, the flame of our love will burn forever. Only souls can resist death, our physical connection is meaningless.&quot;
<br />&quot;If you are willing to trust in a person when all others tell you to go against it, if you are willing to risk getting your heart broken because you believe in that other person, Then that is true love.&quot;
<br />&quot;Time has no meaning when your in love.&quot;
<br />&quot;You have found true love the day you realize that you want to wake up beside your boyfriend/girlfriend, every morning, even though you have your differences.&quot;
<br />&quot;True love knows no boundaries. It is the people involved who create them.&quot;
<br />&quot;One in love fears no storm he fears only the death of love.&quot;
<br />I never thought love could be so magnificent until I saw the sincere look in your eyes, telling me that this time...I would never shed another tear.&quot;
<br />&quot;To truely love something, you must first give it a chance to fail. If it survives, it is going to be stronger than ever. Distance is pure proof of this, and forever we will love if we survive.&quot;
<br />&quot;True love is what I feel for you, for you have my soul, heart and passion, those can only be felt again when I desire you.&quot;
<br />&quot;All the world's riches would never be enough to trade my love for him, because he is and always will be priceless.&quot;
<br />&quot;A day in the heaven is a year on earth. A second of waiting for my love to return is a lifetime of torture.&quot;
<br />&quot;I never knew what love was until I met you, then when distance pulled us apart, I found out what true love is.&quot;
<br />&quot;True love is like ghosts, which everyone talks about but few have seen.&quot;
<br />&quot;You know when your guy is perfect when you walk into a room dressed in sweats, make-up, and tears running down your face and the first thing that he says to you is, 'Baby, you look beautiful.'&quot;
<br />&quot;True love only comes once in a lifetime, so take it as it goes and enjoy every bit of it.&quot;
<br />&quot;True love is worth waiting for even if it takes a lifetime. Then in return a lifetime of love will be waiting for you.&quot;
<br />&quot;It is a fool who looks for logic in the chambers of the human heart.&quot;
<br />&quot;If loving you is wrong, I never want to be right again.&quot;

<br /><br />To live in not only to passively receive existence; one goes on making it day by day, because – as Unamuno said – “One is not born with soul; it is necessary to make it each day.”
<br /><br />“To make the soul ourselves” is “to save the soul”. This does not mean to to heaven after this life, but to give sense and delight to our life: to be happy.
<br /><br />To Become a Person
<br /><br />I am a person and I have to go on becoming a person. Being person is not only to receive and to live existence passively, but also to build it actively. Being person is “to become a person.”
<br /><br />To Relate With Other
<br /><br />And, in turn, becoming person consists fundamentally in relating with others. To relate oneself with God and with others persons – in the form of acceptance or rejection; and to relate oneself with nature, with the environment, with things – in the form of dominion or alienation.
<br /><br />To Know Oneself. To Accept Oneself. To Give Oneself.
<br /><br />Being a person is to know oneself, to accept oneself, and to give oneself.
<br /><br />To know oneself: To distinguish in me the improvable from the immutable. To accept oneself: to stimulate in me the good desires, but fighting against useless anxieties. And to give oneself: to choose to become a person, in liberty, for love.
<br /><br />The problem that each one of us has is, for one thing, what we believe ourselves to be; another is what we want to be; and another, finally, is what we are. To try to give unity to these three levels, until these are made to coincide into a single one, is the task of making oneself a person.
<br /><br />To know oneself
<br /><br />And one has to assume one’s own life without fear, individualizing it, because the life of each one is unrepeatable and non- transferable.
<br /><br />Neither are we God, nor are we the others. And it is necessary to know not only what I am, but also who I am. Because the “who” is what constitutes the authentic personality of each one.
<br /><br />Therefore, neither are we to deceive ourselves, wanting to be what in reality we are not; nor to anesthetize ourselves, for fear of knowing what we are in reality; not even to get depressed.
<br /><br />To know oneself supposes, in the first place, to know what is positive in me, and not only what is negative. Because what is positive, and not your defects, is what you can place at he service of others. And what is why, one of our obligations is to give thanks, to praise God, for all that He has given to us.
<br /><br />Because He has given us what we are: our being, our temperament and, most of all, our capabilities and our potentials – which are marvelous.
<br /><br />And it is important to know what is positive in each one because, with certain masochism, we tend to see before and larger, what is negative – the defects. Because, curiously, what is more positive that we have is usually what we value less. Perhaps because it is the more instinctive and we do not know how to perceive it.
<br /><br />It is a constant of the history of culture – that great persons have had this curious capability to deceive themselves. In the history of literature, Becquer, a very great poet, wanted in reality to be a playwright. In the history of music, what Chapi valued were his “serious” works, and not exactly the farces, in which he really stood out.
<br /><br />We all tend to despite. To be ignorant of, to forget the positive that we have and to miss, to yearn for, to project ourselves, in what we lack. We all tend to see the more negative that there is in us that the positive that we can be.
<br /><br />In the second place, to know oneself means to know the interrelationship that there is between the positive and the negative – that is, the observe and the reverse of my structure as person. To know, not only my isolated symptoms, but also my global and coherent diagnosis.
<br /><br />One thus will I know how to be an integrated person. I will know that my qualities usually go inevitably united to my defects. And only thus will I be able to accept myself and to accept my limitations – not for themselves, because it is impossible to love the negative; but for the qualities to which they are necessarily united.
<br /><br />To know oneself, therefore, is to know to integrate my defects and my limitations in such a way that they do not continue to be – perpetually, in my life – a pure hindrance, an annoying obstacle.
<br /><br />To know oneself, in the third place, supposes to know my peculiarity, the more significant in my personality. To know that this is what fundamentally differentiates me from others. To know, therefore, what are those that I have to insist on, in which I can strengthen myself. Those with whom I can serve others better, more positively, more easily.
<br /><br />To accept oneself
<br /><br />It is no enough just to know oneself. It is not enough to have only a precise, global diagnosis of the structure of your person. What is more important for your life is to accept yourself.
<br /><br />To give that cordial, positive “yes” to your person. Because a person who does not accept oneself will always be, fundamentally, an insecure person, who will go through life with the high defense, as though waiting to be attacked at any moment. An insecure person is an aggressive person.
<br /><br />When we see in a group some person’s aggressiveness, we always tend to react with toughness; we tend to react by not allowing them to dominate us. Until one day when we understand that those aggressive persons are fundamentally insecure persons and that one’s aggressiveness is nothing more than a manner to defend oneself. On that way we begin to feel sorry for them, we begin to understand them – that day, perhaps, that aggressiveness would no longer be so offensive for us.
<br /><br />But nobody accepts oneself without feeling accepted by others first. It is not a matter of tightening the fists and saying: “Form this morning I have to begin to accept myself: “I cannot accept myself alone, if I don not feel accepted by someone before.
<br />That is why marriage is sacrament. Because each spouse, when feeling accepted radically, seriously, and forever by the other, feels – although it be implicitly – accepted by God.
<br /><br />From there is the importance of a good community in which we feel accepted. Because it helps us to grow as persons, accepting ourselves. What is terrible is a community that rejects someone systematically, because it condemns that person not to accept oneself – to die, like a child, infantilized, and without maturing. 
<br /><br />Deep down, only God accepts us completely in His Son: it is the mystery of the Resurrection. But the acceptance of others prepare us and  makes it easy to accept ourselves and to feel accepted by God.
<br /><br />To Give Oneself
<br /><br />Being person does not consist only in being known and in being accepted; this is important and difficult. As a Christian, being person means, to give oneself.
<br /><br />As we accept ourselves, we become capable of truly accepting others. Our mature love leads us to give. And we give it, until the sacrifice, until death, takes us to happiness, to the resurrection.
<br /><br />That is why our greater service, the greater service that we can do for others, is not to works, but to make persons: to help persons to become persons. And to a person “who is made”, one is accepting it. To make one grow by means of our acceptance.
<br /><br />True love always tends to give oneself. The “I” always tends to an authentic “you”.
<br /><br />To give oneself is a sign of maturity; it is the typical passage of adolescence, where one until then has been always receiving, always depending… to the relative maturity of adulthood, that needs to give oneself to another.
<br /><br />And thus, knowing ourselves, accepting ourselves and giving ourselves, we go on growing as person. And thus we may find, not only sense, but delight in our life. And thus we can know, not only “how” we have to live, but also “why” we live.
