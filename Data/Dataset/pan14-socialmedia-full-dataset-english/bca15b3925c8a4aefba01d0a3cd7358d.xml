The early 19th century, the development of oil, during the two world wars, ships, boilers, aircraft manufacturing after World War II thermal power boilers, manufacturing, chemical industries and oil and gas drilling and transportation, have a strong impetus to the steel industry in the variety, yield and quality development. 
<br />Steel is not only used to transport fluid and powdered solid, the exchange energy, manufacturing, machine parts and containers, it is an economic steel. Building with steel pipe [1] grid structure, pillars and mechanical support, can reduce weight and save 20 ~ 40% metal, and the mechanization of factory construction can be realized. (Tianjin Pipe Company processing plant as a steel grid structure used, the actual saving of steel up to 42.9%), with steel manufacturers can not only save steel highway bridge, simplified construction, and protective layer coating can greatly reduce the area of investment and maintenance cost savings . So, any other type of steel can not completely replace the pipe, but you can substitute some of the steel sections and bars. Steel on the national economic development and improve the quality of human life, great relationships, much better than the other steel. From people's daily utensils, furniture, water supply and drainage, gas supply, ventilation and heating facilities to manufacture a variety of agricultural equipment, underground resources development, defense and space used guns, bullets, missiles, rockets and so inseparable from the pipe. 
<br />Precisely because of steel and human life and production activities are inseparable, not only the steel industry, the rapid development of production technology, and innovation, steel production in the steel industry occupies an irreplaceable position.

<br />A, nominal size: the name is specified in the standard size, is the users and producers want to be the ideal size, but also the order specified in the contract size. 
<br />B, actual size: the production obtained during the actual size, the size is always greater than or less than the nominal size. This is greater than or less than the nominal size of the phenomenon is known as bias. 
<br />Deviations and tolerances 
<br />A, deviation: in the production process, because the actual size is difficult to achieve nominal size requirement that is often greater than or less than the nominal size, so the standard set forth in the actual size and nominal size to allow a difference between. Difference is called positive bias, the difference is negative is called the negative bias. 
<br />B, Tolerance: standard is required, and the absolute value of negative deviation is called tolerance, also called &quot;tolerance.&quot; 
<br />Bias is directional, that is &quot;positive&quot; or &quot;negative&quot; means; tolerance is not directional, so the deviation is called &quot;positive tolerance&quot; or &quot;negative tolerance&quot;, it is called is wrong. 
<br />Delivery length 
<br />Delivery length or the length of the contract, also known as the length of user requirements. Standard delivery length of the following provisions: 
<br />A, usually the length (also called non-definite length): Where the length of the length specified in the standard range of requirements and no fixed length, are called the usual length. Standard requirements such as structural pipe: hot rolled (extrusion, expansion) steel 3000mm ~ 12000mm; cold drawn (rolled) steel 2000mmm ~ 10500mm. 
<br />B, Length Length: length length should be within the usual length is required in the contract of a fixed length size. However, the actual operation of the absolute length in both the length of cut is unlikely, therefore, the provisions of the standard length of the allowable length positive deviation value. 
<br />Structural tube standards: 
<br />Production of definite length tube length of pipe than the finished product rate is usually decreased greatly, the production company for fare increase request is reasonable. The rate of increase of the enterprises are not the same, generally based on the basic price increase about 10%. 
<br />C, double length: double length should be within the usual length of the contract should specify a single double length and constitute a multiple of the total length (for example, 3000mm × 3, ie 3 times 3000mm total length of 9000mm). In practice, the total length should be allowed together on the basis of positive deviation 20mm, plus a single double length of each incision should be left margin. Structural tube, for example, left incision margin requirement: ? 159mm diameter is 5 ~ 10mm; diameter&gt; 159mm for the 10 ~ 15mm. 
<br />If no double length standard deviation and the cutting margin requirements should be negotiated between supply and demand in the contract. Times as long as the length scale of the same length, will produce a significant reduction in finished product rate enterprises, so producers proposed fee increases are reasonable, the rate of increase of its rate of increase with the length of the same length. 
<br />D, length range: the range within the length of the usual length when a fixed range of user requirements including length, to be specified in the contract. 
<br />For example: normally a length of 3000 ~ 12000mm, while the range of length of length 6000 ~ 8000mm or 8000 ~ 10000mm. 
<br />Visible range of the length and double length than the length requirements of loose, but tightening than the usual length of a lot of enterprises will become useful to the production rates. So manufacturers fare increase is justified, and its rate of increase in the base price on the increase generally about 4%. 
<br />Uneven thickness 
<br />Pipe wall thickness can not be everywhere the same, in its cross-sectional and longitudinal tube wall thickness varies, on an objective phenomenon, namely uniform wall thickness. To control this heterogeneity, in some steel standard provides uniform wall thickness allowed indicators, the general wall thickness tolerance shall not exceed 80% (after consultation by the implementation of supply and demand sides). 
<br />Ellipticity 
<br />In the circular cross section of pipe diameter, ranging from the existence of the phenomenon, that there is not necessarily the largest diameter perpendicular to each other and the minimum diameter, the maximum diameter and minimum diameter is the difference between the ellipticity (or not roundness). In order to control the ellipticity, and some steel standard specifies the allowable ellipticity index, usually defined as diameter tolerance of not more than 80% (after consultation by the implementation of supply and demand sides). 
<br />Curvature 
<br />Length of pipe in the direction of a curve-shaped, with figures that show the degree of its curve is called curvature. Curvature specified in the standard are generally divided into the following two: 
<br />A, the local curvature: with a meter-long ruler by the largest amount of bend in the pipe, measured chord (mm), is the local curvature values, in units of mm / m, said methods such as 2.5mm / m . This method also applies to the end of the curved pipe. 
<br />B, the total length of bending: with a string, tighten the two ends of the tube, measuring the maximum chord pipe bend (mm), and degree of conversion growth (in meters) of the percentage, is the pipe length The total length of bending. 
<br />For example: pipe length is 8m, the measured maximum chord height 30mm, the bending of the tube length should be: 
<br />0.03 ÷ 8m × 100% = 0.375% 
<br />Size tolerance 
<br />Size tolerance or call size beyond the standard deviations. Here the &quot;size&quot; mainly refers to the pipe diameter and wall thickness. It was the size tolerance is usually used to call &quot;tolerance excess&quot;, which equate to bias and tolerance is not rigorous, it is called, should be called the &quot;bias out of line.&quot; Deviation here may be &quot;positive&quot;, it could be &quot;negative&quot;, and rarely in the same batch of steel in a &quot;positive and negative&quot; deviation overstepped the bounds of the phenomenon.
<br />The Geologic drilling seamless steel pipe we manufacture are widely applied in many industries such as chemical, boiler, geologic, construction, auto, engine, oil etc.The products have good precision sizes; uniform thickness; glabrous surface and good linearity.

The shape of a seamless steel tube can be round, square or rectangular or as per the requirement of manufacturing a particular application. A 1 inch of round tube has 1 inch outside diameter whereas, a 1 inch round pipe has 1 inch inside diameter. The reason behind this is that the external parts of the tubes are important in building structures and the internal parts of the pipes are important in the flow of fluid.
<br />There are mainly two primary types of steel tubing: seamless and welded. The latter begins as a flat strip whereas, the former starts in a melting furnace.
<br />1. Seamless: Primarily the manufacture process of a seamless tubing starts from an electric arc furnace. The steel is later cast in an ingot or cast repeatedly as a bloom. The latter is then rolled in a billet which later on becomes a tube by being drawn over a piercing tool with the help of two external rollers. These rollers are set at an angle to each other which help to move the billet. This is the point when a &quot;rough&quot; tube is formed. Then it is put in an elongator, inside which, with the help of three rollers and an internal mandrel the tube is given a final outside diameter and wall thickness.
<br />2. Welded: This type of steel tubing is made out of either hot-rolled or cold-rolled steel which is poured in the tubing manufacturer in coils. If required the coil may be processed to remove unwanted scale and improve finish. Then the coil is passed through grooved rollers till the shape is formed and the free edges are properly shaped for welding. The external and sometimes the internal welding residue are removed after the edges of the tube are butt welded together. After all this procedure the tube is made to go through two semicircular rollers that help to bring the tube to its final required dimension.
