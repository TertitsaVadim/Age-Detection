Mathew and Luke used Mark's work as a basis for their own, which explains the similarities.  Matthew's gospel contains 90% of Mark's work.  Luke's gospel contains 50% of Mark's work.  This would likely mean that Mark was the commonality of this work.   
<br /><br />But how about the other ten percent of Matthew's gospel and the other fifty percent of Luke's gospel that didn't derive its information from the Marcan Source (Mark's gospel)?  Scholars have postulated that there is a 2nd source that Matthew and Luke used to get the material to write their gospels. The basis is a hypothetical document called &quot;Q.&quot;  &quot;Q&quot; is the abbreviated form of the German word &quot;Quelle&quot; and means &quot;source.&quot;  
<br /><br />There are only two narratives in Q: (1) Jesus' struggle with the devil (Luke 4.2-13; Matthew 4.1-11); and (2) the healing of the centurion's slave (Luke 7.2-3, 6-10; Matthew 8.5-13). But even both of these stories focus more on Jesus' words, than on the events concerned. 
<br /><br />If this concept is given some weight, then much of Q has a social context, showing a better way of living than the early Christians knew in their own lives. As we know from Paul's later letters, by around the year sixty-five, Christians started wondering if Jesus would come back as many had predicted. This makes a date for Q of later than sixty-five yrs. less likely. Some think that the story of the fight with the devil in Q is talking about an incident in 39 when there was a mass demonstration against the putting up of a statue of the Emperor Caligula in Jerusalem [1]. If that's what it is, the Q material likely was created after that time.
<br /><br />The Q material in Matthew and Luke is set in differing contexts, but in roughly the same order. This is a strong argument against those who (like Michael Goulder [2]) have decided that there was no Q source and that Matthew and Luke either came from this material from elsewhere or wrote it themselves. The very similar sequence strengthen the conclusion that Luke and Matthew weren't using unique sources, but the same one.
<br /><br />One example is:
<br /><br />So also Mark 8.34-35 is used in Matthew 16.24-25 and Luke 9.23-24. A Q version also shows up in Matthew 10.38-39 and Luke 14.27 &amp; 17.33.
<br /><br />Overall, many suggest that Luke's version of Q better represents the original more accurately than Matthew's. The conclusion that Q has been as a lost to time written source of some sayings of Jesus has stood firm after more than a century of testing with amazing strength. 
<br /><br />If one accepts that Q is a now-lost written record of &quot;what Jesus really said&quot;, then 'Q' can be considered as a long-missing record of the words that Jesus supposedly said.
<br /><br />·We must also accept the process used to analyze the gospel texts. We know about Q largely because many hundreds of scholars have torn the gospels apart down to their bare bones. The specifics have been and will continue to be discussed. But the overall approach has lasted the test of time. 
<br /><br />A number of further assumptions can be validly drawn from the evidence [4]: 
<br /><br />·The material within Q indicates that it had high status in the early Jewish-Christian communities centered around Northern Galilee. They turned to it for guidance in life-issues.
<br /><br />·Each of the four gospels (excluding Thomas) were designed to get across a particular theological theme. Q is not like that. It is a collection lacking coherence. It lacks literary plan and is fundamentally un-edited.
<br /><br />·Those who are not familiar with the scholarly work of the past 20 years may react to Q with some unhappiness. This makes sense.  We have, in the gospels, not a magically-created hand-me-down from God via an undefinable process of revelation, but a truly human impression (rather than a record) compiled in a normal way for those times.  
<br /><br />Our knowledge today about Jesus is therefore subject to all the strengths and limitations of normal human processes by which information is conveyed from person to person.

<br /><br />To pay attention to what comes naturally. 
<br /><br />·Trust that you'll be provided with what is necessary for you to perform your &quot;business.&quot; 
<br /><br />·Love others even as God has loved you. Love they neighbor as thyself. What these sayings teach is that your main mission in this life is to perfect the ability to love. 
<br /><br />Unfortunately, humans tend to try to make things much more convoluted than that. Most of us have at least 4 simple ideas about what we tend to think of as &quot;life missions.&quot;
<br /><br />Our unique purpose in life or our mission exists somewhere &quot;out there&quot; and is just awaiting our discovery of it. 
<br /><br />Most feel that we probably need to do &quot;something&quot; to change ourselves in order to find our mission, or to become deserving of accomplishing our life mission. 
<br /><br />Our original goal, known as our Birth Vision, is why we are searching in the 1st place. 
<br /><br />One experiences a sense of intuition as those brief &quot;gut-feelings&quot; or vague hunches. As we consider these feelings or sensings more seriously, we become familiar with them, and we are able to grasp the nature of these intuitions more clearly, and to see how they very often guide us. 
<br /><br />Your Internal Motivation 
<br /><br />The 1st step is to recognize that your mission exists within you in the form of your natural inclinations, instincts, desires and what encourages you. Reading, playing hopscotch, writing, coloring, etc. 
<br /><br />Just for fun, take a piece of paper and write down all the activities that you did as a child or that now brings you pleasure as you think of them. For instance, if you liked doing crossword puzzles, take it one step further. Ask yourself what it is about crossword puzzles that you find so much fun that you'd spend your days doing them. Was it because you worked them by yourself in a quiet environment, giving you plenty of time to ponder and to look words up in a dictionary?  Perhaps you have a terrific memory, or have an amazing ability to choose the right word. Or maybe you get a real sense of joy and accomplishment, a feeling of closure when you complete a puzzle. All these things are motivating factors making this activity deeply worthwhile to you then, and maybe even now. 
<br /><br />One does not need to &quot;wait&quot; to find your life's purpose.  As you look, so shall you discover.
<br /><br />The future is still to come, and while we can plan for it, we do so with the understanding that we really do not know what it will bring, or if there is even a future!

<br /> 
<br /> 
<br />Today's discourse reviews the concept of forgiveness.  I am going to discuss seven awareness exercises to help you in getting rid of the old anger, the pain, and the distraction that carrying around a grudge can do.  
<br /><br /> 
<br />The 1st technique is an 'awareness' exercise.
<br /> 
<br />1. Think about what gave you the discomfort.  Was it something said, something you or someone else did to you, one thing not mentioned, not completed, not felt, what?  What was it that lit the fuse?
<br /> 
<br />Two. The next thing is to ask of your inner self WHY it brings about in you pain.  Was a confidence betrayed?  Had you been rejected on some levels?  Have your hopes been dashed?  Consider the way that hurt shows itself.
<br /> 
<br />3.  Think about or let your emotions to go in the direction of the person who ‘did‘ this. From where was it coming?  What buttons had been pushed on his/her end?  Why did it happen?
<br /> 
<br />Four. Imagine yourself in that particular person's shoes. Have you ever actually done anything at all similar?  Could you possibly picture, allowing for what you already know of their life, at any time doing something equivalent?  Are you capable of, without condoning what they've done, maybe recognize it a little?  Have you actually cut another person off on the road? Have you previously spoken without considering your words or stated a thing that were uttered not as intended?
<br /> 
<br />5. Ask yourself what your role in the predicament was. Might you have been reacting out of some of one's personal emotional wounds?  Might there have been a thing you mentioned or did that possibly induced the other human being's hurt?  Would you have done something in a different way if you'd identified the outcome?
<br /> 
<br />Six. Take accountability for your individual role.  Would it be wise to apologize?  Are you able to forgive yourself?  Take a seat, close your eyes and envision a soap bubble in front of you. Put your discomfort inside the bubble – all of it – and encourage it to float out of your space.  When it's away from your immediate space, destroy it.
<br /> 
<br />Seven. Pray for The Divine Force to help you.  Invite The Divine Force to shine a golden ray of forgiveness onto you and also the other people included.
<br /> 
<br />Your job this week is to check out the parts in your everyday life in which you're withholding forgiveness.
<br /> 
<br />Do the activities to discharge your grudges and give yourself the reward of forgiveness through this &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulcseminaryprogram.blogspot.com%26quot%3B%26gt%3BSpirit"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.ulcseminaryprogram.blogspot.com&quot;&gt;Spirit</a> Quest&lt;/a&gt;.
<br /> 
<br />Treat yourself well all week.
<br /> 
<br />And most importantly bear in mind:
<br /> 
<br />You area perfect being.
<br /> 
<br />God Loves You.
<br /> 
<br />You were created
<br /> 
<br />in perfection,
<br /> 
<br />by perfection,
<br /> 
<br />for perfection.
<br /> 
<br />Your success is guaranteed.

<br /> 
<br />In the process of determing the help needed of your heart-broken loved one, it helps to comprehend the circumstances surrounding the death.  You can find gigantic contrasts within the grieving manner that greatly depends upon the age of theperson who died, the manner of death.  (For example, was it a unexpected death, or did it come after a lengthy sickness<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/unsure.gif" alt=":)" />  
<br /> 
<br />Avoid Clichés
<br /> 
<br />&quot;He is out of pain now,&quot; &quot;It was her time,&quot; and &quot;All things always work out for the higher good,&quot; are aren't helpful.  Keep in mind, there are no prepared phrases which will remove the emotional discomfort of the loss.
<br /> 
<br />Phrases To Avoid:
<br /> 
<br />&quot;Time heals all wounds.&quot;  (Time by itself does not make everything better, though it can help.  Those who are grieving do need time, but at the same time they need to experience the various stages of grief.
<br /> 
<br />&quot;Be gladyou've got another child.&quot; (This minimizes the importance of the one who died.)
<br /> 
<br />Good Things to Say:
<br /> 
<br />&quot;You must have been very close to him.&quot;  (The bereaved can then share about the relationship.)
<br /> 
<br />Don't Think That You Are Expected To Have &quot;Something to Say.&quot;
<br /> 
<br />Your presence is enough.  Especially with new grief, a hug, your touch and your genuine compassion are all that the mourner may possibly need. Make it a point to call or visit the survivor, regardless of how much time has passed since the death.  Your caring will be greatly appreciated.
<br /> 
<br />Take the Initiative
<br /> 
<br />Don't merely say, &quot;If there's anything at all I can do, you can always ask.&quot; Make suggestions as well as specific things you can do.  As an example, you might say, &quot;I would like to tend to your yard next Sunday morning at (pick a time.  Would that be a good time for you?&quot; or &quot;May I go grocery shopping together with you the first time out?&quot;  Each thoughtful gesture reminds the bereaved he or she is not alone and keeps him/her from having to continually reach out for assistance. It also lets your friend know you believe he or she continues to be important. Our self-esteem can be often low during the early months of the grieving process, as well as feeling that someone is caring enough to help does good things for the morale.
<br /> 
<br /><br /> 
<br />Offer To Help With the Kids
<br /> 
<br />If children are involved, they would appreciate it if you would send them special notes now and again and invite them on trips along with your family.  Children really should also deal with their grief, but sometimes they need a break from the sadness at home, while their parents may appreciate some time for grieving privately.  Show your caring along with support and ask them to share their ideas as well as their emotions.  They need excellent listeners, also. Do not make the assumption that a person who seems calmness is fine.
<br /> 
<br /><br /> 
<br />Enable the Expression of Guilt Feelings
<br /> 
<br />A healthy reaction to hearing someone express grief can be to respond with by saying, &quot;It's not your fault.  There was nothing you could've done.&quot;  Don't try to rescuepeople from their guilt emotions, because are healthy and normal when people are grieving.  (What most people feel is likely regret.  Guilt implies they did something on purpose to cause injury; we more likely feel regret when we wish we might somehow been able to adjust things.)
<br /> 
<br />Permit the Survivor to Grieve In His/Her Own Way
<br /> 
<br />Avoid pushing the mourner to &quot;get over&quot; the loss.  If he needs to work out at the gym or lift weights to let go of penty up energy and tension, let him.  If she needs to to go through old photos or read every book on grieving he can locate, allow her.  
<br /> 
<br />Allow For Mood Swings
<br /> 
<br />Assume good days and bad days for quite awhile. These highs along with lows are a normal part of the process.  These feelings have been described as waves that sweep in uncontrollably. 
<br /><br />Step by step the very good days turn out to be a lot more frequent, but bad days will occur as much as a year or more after the passing of a loved one.
<br /> 
<br />Remember That Recovery Takes Time
<br /> 
<br />Don't make the assumption that the mourning person to be &quot;over it&quot; within a couple of weeks.  Great waves of emotion may well pour through for several months and then, slowly, progressively, the emotional storm subsides.  It doesn't happen a immediately after the &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulcseminaryprogram.blogspot.com%26quot%3B%26gt%3Bmemorial"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.ulcseminaryprogram.blogspot.com&quot;&gt;memorial</a> service&lt;/a&gt; or even 2 months after it, as many individuals think. 
<br /> 
<br />Talk Openly About the Deceased
<br /> 
<br />During the first several months after a death, there's a tendency to focus on those left behind, while the survivors themselves are putting attention on the person who died.  By Sharing your memories about the deceased, you're giving a special gift to the mourning person.  Your caring and your concern are clear in not only by the things that share, but in the fact that you simply took the time to do so.

<br /> 
<br />The nearest I came to discovering an answer talked about being a Christian and all that has to it.  But, being a Christian is only a very small part of what it means to be spiritually awake.  One site talked about the attributes of a spiritually awake person in a paper titled &quot;The Purpose of Life is &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulcseminary.net%26quot%3B%26gt%3BSpiritual"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.ulcseminary.net&quot;&gt;Spiritual</a> Growth&lt;/a&gt;&quot;.  I can agree with this statement but still it is only a title to a paper.  The paper talks about the fact that there are 2 types of people in this world.  
<br /><br />How many of you would describe yourself as being a materialistic person with all the characteristic of that kind of a person?  Very few of you I'm sure, but do you not display those kinds of attributes from time to time?  You could say, &quot;I'm only normal&quot; and you are.  We all present to the world both kinds of mannerisms and we are both materialistic and spiritual people. Some of us believe that we are more spiritual than the other, and that's OK.
<br /> 
<br />Now, what can we do to become totally spiritually awake? Well, I think that the description above of the spiritual-minded person tells all.  We can be that kind, generous and loving person we claim to be 24/7.  It only takes a little mindfulness to make it so.  Keeping in mind those attribute that make us a spiritual person.
<br /> 
<br />I want to be a totally awakened spiritual person and I want you to awaken also.  We can change this world from being totally materialistic to be spiritually oriented world in 2012.  2012 will be a year of change, a transitional world into the higher aspects of the spiritual life.  You and I can be a part of that.  We only have to make up our minds to be so by promoting to the world that we are indeed a spiritually awaken person. 
<br /><br />All of the above questions about spirituality have their answers in a positive &quot;yes&quot;.  True spirituality has its place in everything we do, day in and day out. We are all spiritual beings here on this earth and it is one of our goals to find God and practice his teaching in the best way we know how. We are here to search the &quot;scriptures&quot; to find the teachings that best express our spiritual understanding and to evolve spiritually. 
<br /><br />Throughout the history of Man, there have been a number of men and women who have come into this world to show humanity that there is a better path. A better way to look at our life: and a better way to solve our problems so that we understand them and act accordingly.
<br /><br />&lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulcseminary.net%26quot%3B%26gt%3BSpirituality%26lt%3B%2Fa%26gt"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.ulcseminary.net&quot;&gt;Spirituality&lt;/a&gt</a>;  is something that is being discussed about throughout the world. It is a very big part of people's conversations. It is talked about on radio and television. It is written about in articles, books, magazines and newspapers. Spirituality is something that is a bit of a mystery for us because we don't have anyone to show us how to be spiritual. Being spiritual is within us. No-one can show us what it is. We all experience it in our own way and it shows up in our lives. I know that I have not solved the question for some of you, but the fact is spirituality is in the ways we practice our faith and belief in the God.  –Rev. Ron Koch

<br /> 
<br /> 
<br />This lesson is about forgiveness.  I'm going to discuss 7 awareness exercises to aide you in clearing out the anger, the pain, and the distraction that carrying around a grudge can do.  
<br /><br /> 
<br />The first skill is an 'awareness' drill.
<br /> 
<br />One. Give some thought to what gave you the hurt.  Was it words, something you or someone else did to you, something not said, not performed, not felt, what?  What was it that lit the fuse?
<br /> 
<br />2. The next thing is to ask of yourself WHY it brings about in you pain.  Was a confidence betrayed?  Were you rejected on some level?  Had your hopes been dashed?  Contemplate how that discomfort manifests.
<br /> 
<br />3.  Think about or allow your emotions to go in the direction of the individual who ‘did‘ this. Exactly from where was it coming?  What buttons had been pushed on his/her part?  Why did it take place?
<br /> 
<br />4. Put yourself in that person's situation. Maybe you have previously done something similar to that?  Could you perhaps envision, allowing for the things you know of their life, at any time doing something comparable?  Are you capable of, without agreeing to what they've done, maybe recognize it a little?  Maybe you have ever cut another person off on the road? Maybe you have previously run off at the mouth or said anything that came out wrong?
<br /> 
<br />5. Inquire your self what your role in the scenario was. Were you reacting out of some of one's personal pain?  Might there have been anything you claimed or did that understandably brought about one other person's pain?  Could you have done anything in a different way if you'd known the outcome?
<br /> 
<br />Six. Take on accountability for your personal function.  Do you need to apologize?  Are you able to forgive yourself?  Find a quiet place, shut your eyes and picture a soap bubble in front of you. Place your discomfort inside the bubble – all of it – and allow it to float out of your space.  When it's away from your immediate space, explode it.
<br /> 
<br />Seven. Request from God to help you.  Invite The Divine Force to shine a golden ray of forgiveness onto you plus the other individuals involved.
<br /> 
<br />Your job this week is to check out the areas inside your life where that you are withholding forgiveness.
<br /> 
<br />Do the drills to release your grudges and give yourself the reward of forgiveness through this &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.onlineseminary.net%26quot%3B%26gt%3BSpirit"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.onlineseminary.net&quot;&gt;Spirit</a> Quest&lt;/a&gt;.
<br /> 
<br />Be good to yourself all week.
<br /> 
<br />And most importantly bear in mind:
<br /> 
<br />You area perfect being.
<br /> 
<br />God Loves You.
<br /> 
<br />You were created
<br />

Spirituality is something that takes place within us and it shows in our life. We can't help showing how our love for God, Allah, Buddha, Jesus affects us. It is something that really cannot be explained, but must be &quot;experienced&quot; to comprehend. It shows in the face of a person who literally &quot;glows&quot; saying, I'm a believer.  –Rev. Ron Koch

<br /><br />Unfortunately, humans tend to try to make things much more involved than that. Most of us have at least 4 common ideas about what we tend to think of as &quot;life missions.&quot;
<br /><br />Life's purpose is something very specific – a namable job or thing for us to do. 
<br /><br />Because of the uncertainty of this named occupation or idea of what we are supposed to be doing, we end up saying, &quot;I'm so confused. I've no idea what my life mission is (or supposed to be).  I simply don't know what I'm good at; I'm only a (insert current job here) and that does not have any real importance. 
<br /><br />What this searching is all about is trying to recall our original intention or our Birth Vision. 
<br /><br />Suddenly our focus changed to the afterlife dimension, and here we could see clearly that our goal the whole time was not merely to create a New Earth, but a New Heaven as well. (The Tenth Insight) 
<br /><br />Your Internal Motivation 
<br /><br />Start by looking at those things you love to do. What things to do you that bring you your joy and satisfaction?  What did you do for hours on end when you were a child? Reading, playing hopscotch, writing, coloring, etc. 
<br /><br />As an experiment, take a sheet of paper and jot down all the activities that you did as a child or that now you enjoy as they occur to you. Do this exercise with each interest and talent you have and look at why you like it so much! If you work in alignment with these motivations you realize that you are living a part of your life purpose. You may not want to make your living solving crossword puzzles, but the some part of that activity – words and their meanings are something that you are inherently attracted to. Study how your ability can translate into something you can bring outward and into your daily life. Watch carefully to what and where your attention is drawn. 
<br /><br />Discovering and &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.onlineseminary.net%26quot%3B%26gt%3BLiving"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.onlineseminary.net&quot;&gt;Living</a> Your Purpose&lt;/a&gt; as a Process. 
<br /><br />The next step is in understanding that purpose is a namable occupation. Generally, the majority of people think that our purpose will be based on a career, such as becoming a teacher, a doctor, a real estate agent, a dental hygienist, the vice-presidency of marketing, a social worker, &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulcceremonies.com%26quot%3B%26gt%3Bbecoming"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.ulcceremonies.com&quot;&gt;becoming</a> a ULC minister&lt;/a&gt;, or an interior designer. You might wish to consider that your purpose is really to learn to be more caring in your reaction to all beings. Perhaps your purpose is to mentor one special child, to create an industry, or to be the Rock of Gibraltar to your family or others who are in your life. By understanding that your life purpose is revealed over the course of your entire life journey, your world can be opened to welcoming all that comes to you as a part of your purpose, not just your day-to-day job and stuff that gets you through your day. Another area in comprehending your life purpose is to realize that you may have more than a single &quot;life purpose&quot; over the course of your entire life, as the circumstances of your life change, or things and people in your life grow over time.
<br /><br />For some reason, a lot of us are under the impression that until we discover our life purpose that life is on hold or is insignificant. The present moment is actually the only moment you have to fully touch and to be touched by life. The past is gone, and while we can change the effects of our past on our current and future life, we cannot change or redo any of the actions we did or neglected to do.

<br /> 
<br />The closest I came to finding an answer talked about being a Christian and all that has to it.  But, being a Christian is only a very small part of what it means to be spiritually awake.  One website talked about the attributes of a spiritually awake person in a paper titled &quot;The Purpose of Life is &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.weddingwordsandmore.com%26quot%3B%26gt%3BSpiritual"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.weddingwordsandmore.com&quot;&gt;Spiritual</a> Growth&lt;/a&gt;&quot;.  I can agree with this statement but still it is only a title to a paper.  Within the paper it gives a statement about the fact that there are two types of people in this world.  
<br /><br />How many of you would describe yourself as being a materialistic person with all the characteristic of that kind of a person?  Very few of you I'm sure, but do you not display those kinds of attributes from time to time?  You could say, &quot;I'm only normal&quot; and you are.  We all present to the world both kinds of mannerisms and we are both materialistic and spiritual people. Some of us believe that we are more spiritual than the other, and that's OK.
<br /> 
<br />Now, what can we do to become totally spiritually awake? Well, I think that the description above of the spiritual-minded person tells all.  We can be that kind, generous and loving person we claim to be 24/7.  It only takes a little mindfulness to make it so.  Keeping in mind those attribute that make us a spiritual person.
<br /> 
<br />What is it that constitutes true spirituality?  Is it sitting in a church service saying nothing – just being quiet and observant? Is it praying constantly to the God of your understanding 24/7?  Perhaps, it is nothing more than just being me/you or, maybe working behind the scenes to bring about a better way of life for others? 
<br /><br />All of the above questions about spirituality have their answers in a positive &quot;yes&quot;.  True spirituality has its place in everything we do, day in and day out. We are all spiritual beings here on this earth and it is one of our goals to find God and practice his teaching in the best way we know how. We are here to search the &quot;scriptures&quot; to find the teachings that best express our spiritual understanding and to evolve spiritually. 
<br /><br />Throughout the history of Man, there have been a number of men and women who have come into this world to show humanity that there is a better path. A better way to look at our life: and a better way to solve our problems so that we understand them and act accordingly.
<br /><br />&lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulcseminary.net%26quot%3B%26gt%3BSpirituality%26lt%3B%2Fa%26gt"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.ulcseminary.net&quot;&gt;Spirituality&lt;/a&gt</a>; is practicing our belief in God, and practicing our belief in Jesus and his teachings. Spirituality is something that takes place within us and it shows in our life. We can't help showing how our love for God, Allah, Buddha, Jesus affects us. It is something that really cannot be explained, but must be &quot;experienced&quot; to comprehend. It shows in the face of a person who literally &quot;glows&quot; saying, I'm a believer.  –Rev. Ron Koch

		<document id="f2598d26eab07c254901ab3d71871f1f" url=""><![CDATA[What Exactly Is the Q Source and How Does It Relate To The G<br/><br/>When we look at the gospels of Matthew and Luke the parallels are abundantly clear.  That is due to the fact that Matthew and Luke drew upon Mark for most of their gospels.  Matthew's gospel contains ninety percent of Mark's work.  Luke's gospel contains 50% of Mark's work.  This would likely mean that Mark was the commonality of this work.   
<br /><br />But how about the other ten percent of Matthew's gospel and the other 50% of Luke's gospel that didn't derive its information from the Marcan Source (Mark's gospel)?  Bear in mind that the Q source is a hypothetical document that has been discovered by scholars weaving together the similarities between the gospel accounts of Matthew and Luke that cannot be credited to Mark.  Scholars have meticulously resurrected this work as a unique source attributing the accounts that Matthew and Luke use outside the Marcan source.  
<br /><br />There are only two narratives in Q: (1) Jesus' struggle with Satan (Luke 4.2-13; Matthew 4.1-11); and (2) the healing of the centurion's slave (Luke 7.2-3, 6-10; Matthew 8.5-13). But even both of these stories focus more on what Jesus said, than on the events concerned. 
<br /><br />The four main gospels seem to think less about Jesus coming again, and more about what they call the &quot;Kingdom of God&quot;. There is a well-supported argument for assuming that by &quot;Kingdom&quot; they meant letting God's sovereign rule be the guidelines in their thinking about life and the context of the times when they lived. As we are aware from Paul's later letters, by roughly the year sixty-five, Christians had begun to wonder if Jesus would come back as some had predicted. This makes a date for Q of later than sixty-five years less likely. Some believe that the story of the fight with Satan in Q refers to a situation in 39 when there was a huge demonstration against the putting up of a statue of the Emperor Caligula in Jerusalem [1]. If true, the Q material likely came into being after that date.
<br /><br />Mark's Gospel has no Q material but is used as an obvious reference by both Luke and Matthew. Strikingly, it appears that the source represented in Mark's gospel is the same Q version used by both Matthew as well as Luke.
<br /><br />One example is:
<br /><br />Mark 4.25 is used in Matthew 13.12 and Luke 8.18. A similar version from Q also occurs in Matthew 25.29 and Luke 19.26.
<br /><br />Overall, many suggest that Luke's interpretation of Q preserves the original more accurately than Matthew's. Some reasons why the discovery of Q is so important should be summarized in the conservative light of those who question the accuracy of the information we have about Jesus, and the fundamentalists who believe each written word as ‘gospel' so to speak. 
<br /><br />If one agrees that Q is a now-lost written record of &quot;what Jesus really said&quot;, then 'Q' should be considered as a long-missing record of the things that Jesus actually said.
<br /><br />·We must additionally accept the process used to analyze the gospel texts. We know about Q exactly because many 100's of scholars have torn the gospels apart down to their bare bones. The specifics have been and will continue to be argued. But the overall approach has endured the test of time. 
<br /><br />Several other assumptions can be validly drawn from the evidence [4]: 
<br /><br />·The material within Q indicates that it had measurable status in the early Jewish-Christian communities centered around Northern Galilee. They turned to it for guidance in life-issues.
<br /><br />·Q wasn't written as a single piece. Rather, it was a collection which was added to over time. Some changes could've been made by later, non-Galilean sources - though the proof for this is not that strong.
<br /><br />·Because Q is a collection, any signs we can pick up from it about the conditions and concerns of the community which originated it are likely to closely reflect what was happening socially within the Q community.  
<br /><br />What we know at this time about Jesus is therefore subject to all the strengths and weaknesses of normal human processes by which information is conveyed from person to person.

<br /><br />As you begin every day, your purpose becomes more clear. Keep in mind that you are perfect the way you are in this moment and that your destiny will reveal itself to you.  You are the only one who can find what that purpose is. That Guidance lies within you and is working at this very moment. Your job is to:

<br /><br />Our original goal, known as our Birth Vision, is why we're looking in the first place. 
<br /><br />As you discover yourself wondering what your life purpose is, start to pay more attention to your intuitions and taking them more seriously. In everyday life, when our phone rings we answer it and get a message. When our intuition &quot;rings&quot; we should also &quot;answer&quot; it by taking it seriously.

		<document id="abc742750f121c72ffdf0c4587a0c597" url=""><![CDATA[Follow These 7 Suggestions For Finding Forgiveness<br/><br/>How To Remove Your Pain
<br /> 
<br /> 
<br />Today's lesson is about forgiveness.  I'll be discussing 7 mental exercises to increase your awareness and to help you in getting rid of the old anger, the pain, and the distraction that lugging around a grudge can do.  
<br /><br /> 
<br />The primary method is an 'awareness' drill.
<br /> 
<br />1. Give some consideration to what gave you the pain.  Was it a conversation with someone, deeds done, a thing not said, not done, not felt, what?  What was the thing that set off?
<br /> 
<br />Two. The next thing is to ask of yourself WHY it causes you discomfort.  Was a trust betrayed?  Had you been rejected on some level?  Had your hopes been crushed?   how that pain manifests.
<br /> 
<br />3.  Give some consideration or permit your emotions to go in the direction of the person who ‘did‘ this. From where was it coming?  What buttons had been pushed on his/her end?  Why did it take place?
<br /> 
<br />Four. Imagine yourself in that person's situation. Have you ever before done anything at all like that?  Could you perhaps envision, given the things you already know of their life, ever doing anything like that?  Are you capable of, without agreeing to what they've done, possibly realize it a little?  Have you ever at any time cut another person off on the road? Perhaps you have ever run off at the mouth or said anything that came out not as intended?
<br /> 
<br />Five. Inquire your self what your position in the position was. Had you been reacting from some of your respective unique hot buttons?  Might there have been one thing you said or did that probably brought on one other human being's hurt?  Would you have carried out anything otherwise if you'd identified the outcome?
<br /> 
<br />Six. Take accountability for your own position.  Should you apologize?  Are you willing to forgive yourself?  Take a moment to, shut your eyes and picture a soap bubble in front of you. Place your pain in the bubble – all of it – and encourage it to float away.  When it's away from your immediate space, pop it.
<br /> 
<br />Seven. Request from The Supreme Being to assist you.  Invite The Supreme Being to shine a golden light of forgiveness onto you plus the others concerned.
<br /> 
<br />Your job this week is to take a look at the areas in your own existence where you might be withholding forgiveness.
<br /> 
<br />Do the exercises to let go of your grudges and give yourself the gift of forgiveness through this &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.weddingwordsandmore.com%26quot%3B%26gt%3BSpirit"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.weddingwordsandmore.com&quot;&gt;Spirit</a> Quest&lt;/a&gt;.
<br /> 
<br />Be good to yourself all week.
<br /> 
<br />And most importantly bear in mind:
<br /> 
<br />You'rean ideal being.
<br /> 
<br />God Loves You.
<br /> 
<br />You were created
<br /> 
<br />in perfection,
<br /> 
<br />by perfection,
<br /> 
<br />for perfection.
<br /> 
<br />Your success is guaranteed.

<br /><br />But how about the other ten percent of Matthew's gospel and the other 50% of Luke's gospel that didn't get its information from the Marcan Source (Mark's gospel)?  Scholars have considered that there is a 2nd source that Matthew and Luke used to get the information to compose their gospels. The source is a hypothetical document called &quot;Q.&quot;  &quot;Q&quot; is the shortened form of the German word &quot;Quelle&quot; which means &quot;source.&quot;  
<br /><br />The Q community was focused on what they believed would be the coming of the Messiah in power and glory to set things right. As we know from Paul's letters, early Christians felt that God communicated to them through prophecy. This was, in turn, evidence that they were God's selected group who would triumph when Jesus returned in the final days. 
<br /><br />The four main gospels seem to think less about Jesus coming again, and more about what they call the &quot;Kingdom of God&quot;. There is a healthy argument for supposing that by &quot;Kingdom&quot; they meant allowing God's sovereign rule be the guidelines in how they thought about life and the context of the times in which they lived.

<br /><br />This is another strong confirmation that Q was just one source and that it was used by both Matthew and Luke independently of Mark. Some reasons why the discovery of Q is so important bear summarizing in the conservative light of those who debate the accuracy of the information we have about Jesus, and the fundamentalists who believe each written word as ‘gospel' so to speak. 
<br /><br />If one agrees that Q is a now-lost written record of &quot;what Jesus really said&quot;, then 'Q' should be regarded as a long-missing record of the words that Jesus supposedly said.
<br /><br />·The Q material can be validly made separate from the gospel text. 
<br /><br />A number of further assumptions can be validly drawn from the facts presented [4]: 
<br /><br />·Not only was Q originally a written source, but it was composed in Greek. Attempts to find Aramaic in the text have failed.
<br /><br />·Each of the 4 gospels (excluding Thomas) were designed to convey a specific theological theme. Q isn't like that. It is a collection without coherence. It fails to show literary design and is fundamentally un-edited.
<br /><br />·Because Q is a collection, any signs found from it regarding the conditions and concerns of the community which originated it are likely to closely reflect the social context of the Q community.  
<br /><br />What we know today about Jesus is therefore subject to all the strengths and weaknesses of ordinary human processes by which knowledge is shared from person to person.

<br /> 
<br /> 
<br />Today's lesson discusses forgiveness.  I'll be discussing 7 mental exercises to increase your awareness and to help you in ridding yourself of the anger, the pain, and the distraction that lugging around a grudge can do.  
<br /><br /> 
<br />The initial method is an 'awareness' drill.
<br /> 
<br />1. Think about what gave you the hurt.  Was it something said, something done to you or someone you love, one thing not said, not accomplished, not felt, what?  What was the thing that set off?
<br /> 
<br />Two. The next thing is to ask of your inner self WHY it causes you discomfort.  Had a trust been betrayed?  Did you feel rejected on some level?  Have your hopes been dashed?   the way that discomfort manifests.
<br /> 
<br />3.  Give some attention to or allow your emotions to go towards the individual who ‘did‘ this. Exactly from where was it coming?  What buttons have been pushed on his/her part?  Why did it occur?
<br /> 
<br />4. Imagine yourself in that particular person's situation. Maybe you have at any time done something similar?  Could you quite possibly picture, provided the things you understand of their life, at any time doing anything equivalent?  Are you able to, without condoning what they've done, perhaps comprehend that person's behavior a bit?  Have you ever ever cut someone off on the road? Maybe you have ever spoken without thinking or stated words that came out wrong?
<br /> 
<br />Five. Inquire yourself what your position in the position was. Might you have been reacting from some of the own hot buttons?  Was there some thing you claimed or did that probably brought about the other human being's discomfort?  Might you have  accomplished something otherwise in the event you'd known the outcome?
<br /> 
<br />6. Take on accountability for your very own function.  Ought you to apologize?  Can you forgive yourself?  Sit down, shut your eyes and visualize a soap bubble in front of you. Put your pain inside the bubble – all of it – and allow it to float out of your space.  When it's out of your immediate area, pop it.
<br /> 
<br />Seven. Request from The Divine Force to aid you.  Invite God to shine a golden ray of forgiveness onto you and the others included.
<br /> 
<br />Your job this week is to have a look at the parts within your existence in which you're withholding forgiveness.
<br /> 
<br />Do the drills to let go of your grudges and give yourself the reward of forgiveness through this &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulcseminaryprogram.blogspot.com%26quot%3B%26gt%3BSpirit"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.ulcseminaryprogram.blogspot.com&quot;&gt;Spirit</a> Quest&lt;/a&gt;.

Mathew and Luke used Mark's work as a basis for their own, which explains the similarities.  Matthew's gospel contains ninety percent of Mark's work.  Luke's gospel contains fifty percent of Mark's work.  This seems to hint that Mark was their common source.   
<br /><br />But how about the other 10% of Matthew's gospel and the other fifty percent of Luke's gospel that is totally unique from Mark?  Matthew and Luke are consistent word for word.  How can this be?  There has to be another source to explain this.  
<br /><br />There are only 2 narratives in Q: (1) Jesus' struggle with Satan (Luke 4.2-13; Matthew 4.1-11); and (2) the healing of the centurion's slave (Luke 7.2-3, 6-10; Matthew 8.5-13). But even both of these accounts focus more on what Jesus said, than on the events surrounding them. 
<br /><br />The 4 main gospels seem to think less about Jesus coming again, and more about what they call the &quot;Kingdom of God&quot;. There is a well-supported argument for supposing that by &quot;Kingdom&quot; they meant allowing God's sovereign rule reign in their thinking about life and the context of the times in which they lived. As we are aware from Paul's later writings, by roughly the year 65, Christians started wondering if Jesus would return as some had thought. This makes a date for Q of later than sixty-five yrs. less likely. Some think that the story of the fight with Satan in Q is talking about a situation in 39 when there was a huge demonstration against the erection of a statue of the Emperor Caligula in Jerusalem [1]. If that's what it is, the Q material likely was created after that date.
<br /><br />Mark's Gospel has no Q material but is used as a source by both Luke and Matthew. Amazingly, it appears that the source represented in Mark's gospel is the same Q version used by both Matthew as well as Luke.
<br /><br />One example is:
<br /><br />Mark 4.25 is used in Matthew 13.12 and Luke 8.18. A similar version from Q also occurs in Matthew 25.29 and Luke 19.26.
<br /><br />This is another strong confirmation that Q was just one source and that it was utilized by both Matthew and Luke independently of Mark. Scholars still come from the woodwork with reasons to dismiss it. But their reasons are usually weak. 
<br /><br />If one accepts that Q is a now-lost written record of &quot;what Jesus really said&quot;, then 'Q' can be considered as a long-missing record of the words that Jesus perhaps said.
<br /><br />·The Q material can be validly made separate from the gospel text. 
<br /><br />A number of further assumptions can be reasonably drawn from the evidence [4]: 
<br /><br />·Not only was Q originally a written source, but it was composed in Greek. Attempts to find Aramaic in the text have failed.
<br /><br />·Each of the 4 gospels (excluding Thomas) were designed to convey a specific theological theme. Q isn't like that. It's a collection lacking coherence. It fails to show literary plan and is basically un-edited.
<br /><br />·Because Q is a collection, any indications we can pick up within it about the conditions and concerns of the community which gave birth to it are likely to mirror what was happening socially within the Q community.  
<br /><br />What we know today about Jesus is therefore subject to all the strengths and weaknesses of ordinary human processes by which knowledge is conveyed from person to person.

Mathew and Luke used Mark's work as a basis for their own, which explains the similarities.  Matthew's gospel contains 90% of Mark's work.  Luke's gospel contains 50% of Mark's work.  This would likely mean that Mark was the commonality of this work.   
<br /><br />But how about the other 10% of Matthew's gospel and the other 50% of Luke's gospel that did not get its information from the Marcan Source (Mark's gospel)?  Matthew and Luke agree word for word.  How is this possible?  There must be another source to explain this.  
<br /><br />The Q community was focused on what they felt would be the coming of the Messiah in power and glory to set things as they should be. As we learned from Paul's letters, early Christians felt that God spoke to them through prophecy. This was, in turn, evidence that they were God's selected group who would emerge triumphant when Jesus returned in the final days. 
<br /><br />The 4 main gospels seem to think less about Jesus coming again, and more about what they call the &quot;Kingdom of God&quot;. There is a well-supported argument for assuming that by &quot;Kingdom&quot; they meant letting God's sovereign rule reign in how they thought about life and the context of the time period in which they lived. As we are aware from Paul's later writings, by around the year sixty-five, Christians started wondering if Jesus would return as many had predicted. This makes a date for Q of more than 65 years less likely. Some think that the story of the fight with Satan in Q is talking about an incident in 39 when there was a mass demonstration against the putting up of a statue of the Emperor Caligula in Jerusalem [1]. If true, the Q material likely was created after that time.
<br /><br />The high percentage of verbal similarities between Luke and Matthew, and some specific word formations, make many people think that Q was a written source now long-lost, rather than an oral tradition. They think it unlikely that two oral traditions, one utilized by Matthew and the other used by Luke, could've sustained such near perfect verbal similarity.
<br /><br />One example is:
<br /><br />Mark 4.25 is used in Matthew 13.12 and Luke 8.18. A similar version from Q also occurs in Matthew 25.29 and Luke 19.26.
<br /><br />This is another firm confirmation that Q was a single source and that it was utilized by both Matthew and Luke independently of Mark. Some reasons why the discovery of Q is so essential bear summarizing in the light both of conservatives continuing skepticism about the correctness of the information we have about Jesus, and of fundamentalist ideas asserted that all things in the Bible actually happened just as it's written there. 
<br /><br />If one accepts that Q is a now-lost written record of &quot;what Jesus really said&quot;, then 'Q' should be considered as a long-missing record of the words that Jesus perhaps said.
<br /><br />·The Q collection can be correctly made separate from the gospel text. 
<br /><br />A number of further assumptions can be validly drawn from the facts presented [4]: 
<br /><br />·The content of Q indicates that it had high status in the early Jewish-Christian communities based in Northern Galilee. They looked to it for guidance in life-issues.
<br /><br />·Each of the 4 gospels (not including Thomas) were designed to convey a specific theological theme. Q isn't like that. It is a collection lacking coherence. It lacks literary design and is fundamentally un-edited.
<br /><br />·Because Q is a collection, any indications we can pick up within it regarding the what was going on in the community which birthed it are likely to mirror the social context of the Q community.

<br /> 
<br /> 
<br />Today's discourse reviews the concept of forgiveness.  I'm going to discuss seven mental exercises to increase your awareness and to help you in clearing out the anger, the pain, and the distraction that lugging around a grudge can do.  
<br /><br /> 
<br />The first method is an 'awareness' exercise.
<br /> 
<br />One. Give some thought to what gave you the pain.  Was it something said, deeds done, anything not stated, not accomplished, not felt, what?  What was the thing that set off?
<br /> 
<br />Two. The next thing is to ask of your inner self WHY it brings about in you discomfort.  Had a confidence been betrayed?  Did you feel rejected on some level?  Have your hopes been dashed?   the way that hurt shows itself.
<br /> 
<br />3.  Give some thought or let your feelings to go towards the person who ‘did‘ this. Exactly from where was it coming?  What buttons were pushed on his/her part?  Why did it take place?
<br /> 
<br />4. Imagine yourself in that individual's shoes. Maybe you have ever done anything at all similar to that?  Could you probably imagine, given the things you understand of their life experience, at any time doing anything comparable?  Can you, without condoning what they've done, maybe grasp it a bit?  Perhaps you have at any time cut someone off on the freeway? Have you ever ever spoken without considering your words or said words that were uttered not as intended?
<br /> 
<br />5. Request your self what your position in the circumstances was. Were you reacting from some of your personal hurt?  Was there some thing you mentioned or did that possibly triggered one other individual's discomfort?  Would you have performed some thing otherwise if you'd known the outcome?
<br /> 
<br />Six. Take accountability for your own personal role.  Should you apologize?  Can you forgive yourself?  Take a seat, shut your eyes and envision a soap bubble in front of you. Put your hurt within the bubble – all of it – and let it float away.  When it's away from your immediate area, pop it.
<br /> 
<br />7. Ask God to aid you.  Invite The Divine Force to shine a golden ray of forgiveness onto you along with the other individuals included.
<br /> 
<br />Your job this week is to have a look at the areas in your everyday life in which you're withholding forgiveness.
<br /> 
<br />Do the exercises to let go of your grudges and give yourself the reward of forgiveness through this &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ministersupplies.com%26quot%3B%26gt%3BSpirit"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.ministersupplies.com&quot;&gt;Spirit</a> Quest Course&lt;/a&gt;.
<br /> 
<br />Treat yourself well all week.
<br /> 
<br />And most importantly remember:
<br /> 
<br />You'rea perfect being.
<br /> 
<br />God Loves You.
<br /> 
<br />You were created
<br /> 
<br />in perfection,
<br /> 
<br />by perfection,
<br /> 
<br />for perfection.
<br /> 
<br />Your success is guaranteed.

That is because Matthew and Luke drew upon Mark for most of their gospels.  Matthew's gospel contains ninety percent of Mark's work.  Luke's gospel contains fifty percent of Mark's work.  This seems to hint that Mark was their common source.   
<br /><br />But how about the other ten percent of Matthew's gospel and the other fifty percent of Luke's gospel that is completely unique from Mark?  Matthew and Luke agree word for word.  How is this possible?  There must be some other source to explain this.  
<br /><br />Instead of identifying Q sayings by verses in both Matthew and Luke, (because the sayings in Q are direct parallels to Matthew and Luke) scholars identify the sayings with Luke only because Luke appears to preserve the order of the &quot;original&quot; document.  In other words, identifying Q sayings with Luke makes more sense. 
<br /><br />But care needs to be taken to avoid projecting current ideas onto these anxient texts. Just because we think in terms of early apocalyptic literature doesn't mean that it actually happened that way, or that early Christians thought in exactly those terms. As we are aware from Paul's later letters, by around the year 65, Christians had begun to wonder if Jesus would return as some had predicted. This makes a date for Q of more than sixty-five yrs. less likely. Some think that the story of the fight with the devil in Q makes reference to a situation in 39 when there was a huge demonstration against the erection of a statue of the Emperor Caligula in Jerusalem [1]. If true, the Q material likely was created after that date.
<br /><br />The high percentage of verbal similarities between Luke and Matthew, and some specific word formations, make many people think that Q was written long ago, then lost to time, rather than an oral tradition. They believe it unlikely that two oral traditions, one used by Matthew and the other used by Luke, could've maintained such near perfect verbal similarity.
<br /><br />One example is:
<br /><br />So also Mark 8.34-35 is used in Matthew 16.24-25 and Luke 9.23-24. A Q version also appears in Matthew 10.38-39 and Luke 14.27 &amp; 17.33.
<br /><br />Overall, many suggest that Luke's interpretation of Q better represents the original better than Matthew's. The determination that Q was as a lost to time written source of some sayings of Jesus has stood firm after more than a century of testing with amazing strength. 
<br /><br />If one agrees that Q is a now-lost written record of &quot;what Jesus really said&quot;, then 'Q' should be considered as a long-missing record of the words that Jesus perhaps said.
<br /><br />·The Q material can be correctly separated from the gospel text. 
<br /><br />Several other assumptions can be reasonably drawn from the evidence [4]: 
<br /><br />·The material within Q indicates that it had measurable status in the early Jewish-Christian communities based in Northern Galilee. The people looked to it for guidance in life-issues.
<br /><br />·Q was not written as a single piece. Instead, it was several separate documents which was added to from time to time. Some changes may have been made by later, non-Galilean sources - though the proof for this is fairly weak.
<br /><br />·Those who are not familiar with the scholarly work of the previous twenty years may react to Q with some dismay. This is understandable.  We have, represented by the gospels, not a channeled hand-me-down from God via an undefinable process of revelation, but a truly human impression (instead of a record) compiled in a normal way for those times.  
<br /><br />What we know at this time about Jesus is therefore subject to all the strengths and weaknesses of normal human processes by which information is shared from person to person.

<br /> 
<br />Since its early beginnings, the program has been expanded to assist people in dealing with all life challenges from a spiritual perspective. At any given time, you can find meetings happening for every life issue that you can think of. Like with the &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulcseminary.com%26quot%3B%26gt%3BUniversal"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.ulcseminary.com&quot;&gt;Universal</a> Life Church&lt;/a&gt;, the sun never sets on the twelve-step program.
<br /> 
<br />There have been many books written that are focused upon the spiritual importance of living a life using the 12-Steps. Since the steps have a spiritual base, anyone who is intent on learning new ways to improve one's spirituality can utilize these amazing tools.
<br /> 
<br />The 12 Steps offer a tailored approach, customized in design, allowing for leverage in terms of one's spiritual beliefs, and validating our individual spiritual journeys.
<br /> 
<br />The program was based on the idea that when we are going through spiritual bankruptcy, our lives will most likely be unmanageable.
<br /> 
<br />When lacking a connection with God, we are in disarray, unhappy and out of control. In this state of sad emptiness, we're lost and moving in darkness, which inhibits our capacity to enjoy life in positive ways, and keeps us moving in little more than a zombie-like state. It is a bad place to be, and fortunately it is temporary.
<br /> 
<br />The 12-step program also leaves room for anyone who wishes to use these steps as a part of your particular religious belief system. They are flexible to a point, and that is part of the unique beauty of this program.
<br /> 
<br />As ministers, it is so helpful to learn about other belief systems and how they can be utilized and applied to our lives and the lives of those who seek our help as ministers.
<br /> 
<br />The 12-Step Spiritual Program was first started by two alcoholics who were imprisoned in the clutches of pain and suffering and whose lives were a living hell.
<br /> 
<br />The two founders, Dr. Bob and Bill W. were spiritual seekers in their own right, desperately searching for ways to exit their personal hells. After much searching, they determined that self-dependence was an illusion, and that it was absolutely necessary to have a belief in a power stronger than themselves to begin the healing process.
<br /> 
<br />They also discovered that helping others was vital to success. Without reaching out and sharing experience, strength and hope, success was transient.
<br /> 
<br />Their experience shows that the human spirit, when driven to the depths of despair, can rise from the ashes, like the phoenix, and create miracles.
<br /> 
<br />&quot;If you WANT a miracle, then you must first BE the miracle.&quot;
<br /> 
<br />The challenge in life involves learning from the pain, frustration and void in our lives and our hearts so it can be turned around and used to create miracles.
<br /> 
<br />One of the famous sayings in the program explains this eloquently:
<br /> 
<br />&quot;When life gives you lemons, learn to make lemonade.&quot;

Ananda asked, &quot;Is it because women do not experience the same potential as men to achieve enlightenment?&quot;
<br /><br />Buddha disagreed.  &quot;Women have as much ability as men to become enlightened&quot;
<br /><br />Having said that, in more than a few Asian countries, it is a strongly-held belief that only men are able to become enlightened.  In the more restricted areas, Buddhist women can only practice Buddhism devoutly then hope that they're reborn as men thier next lifetime. 
<br /><br />Words of Advice Given To Laywomen
<br /><br />In the Anguttara Nikaya, a Buddhist scripture, the following advice has been bestowed upon laywomen: 
<br /><br />· Be capable at your work.
<br /><br />· Work with diligence and skill.
<br /><br />· Be even-handed and/or skillful when managing your domestic help, if applicable.
<br /><br />· Perform household chores with efficiency.
<br /><br />· Be a hospitable host to the friends and family of one's husband.
<br /><br />· Be faithful to one's husband; protect and/or invest family earnings.
<br /><br />· Discharge your responsibilities with love and conscientiously.
<br /><br />· Practice the five precepts as well as become morally disciplined.
<br /><br />· Practice generosity (cultivate a mind free of stinginess or avarice; delight in charity, giving and sharing).
<br /><br />· Seek wisdom and recognize that absolutely nothing is ever permanent.
<br /><br />The Bhikkuni Sangha
<br /><br />An ordained Buddhist nun is referred to as a bhikkuni.  
<br /><br />Mahapajapati and her band of five hundred women of noble birth became the basis of the first bhikkuni order.
<br /><br />Two hundred years later, when Emperor Ashoka sent his son to Sri Lanka to be a Buddhist Missionary, he learned of a princess who wished to join the sangha.  But in order for it to be established, both bhikkus and bhikkunis were needed.  Additionally, it was essential that a minimum of 5 bhikkunis be a part of the core of the order.   To start the sangha, the Emperor Ashoka's daughter, already a Buddhist nun, requested to be sent to Sri Lanka.  Upon Sanghamitta's arrival in Sri Lanka, she was joined by hundreds of other women who were anxious to join as well.  With the beginning of this new Bhikkuni Sanghi, the first outside of India, Buddhist Women rejoiced the huge step forward.
<br /><br />The Bhikkuni order was thriving until the attack on their country during the year 1017.   War became the greatest downfall of many other Bhikkuni orders all throughout the world.  The Bhikkuni lineage has been broken for more than a thousand years throughout Thailand, Tibet as well as many other southeast Asian countries.     In 2007, Buddhist leaders of all traditions met in Germany at the International Congress on Buddhist Women's Role in the Sangha to re-establish the bhikkuni ordination.  It became a great success, with the Dalai Lama's support of the re-establishment, and all of the delegates unanimously agreed the bhikkuni ordination needs to be re-established.   But many of the details are still being worked out.  His Holiness, the Dalai Lama, said, &quot;If Buddha were with us now, I'm sure he would grant his permission for bhikkuni ordination.  But Buddha is not with us, so I can't act as Buddha.&quot;
<br /><br />So where does that leave Buddhist women of today?  Not surprisingly, most of the world will find bhikkunis treated as lesser than bhikkus.  Regardless of whether any of the misogynistic quotes or stories we found are real reflections of historical events, or fabrications understandably woven over the years by men born into a patriarchal system, the fact of the matter is that they still exist.  They are there for any person to read, so whether or not the Buddha intended for men to have more power, they do   That is especially relevant in patriarchal countries such as Thailand, where there's no bhikkuni ordination, and where women who were ordained in Sri Lanka are not recognized as bhikkunis by the Thai sangha.

Ananda asked, &quot;Are you thinking women to be less able to reach enlightenment?&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;No Ananda,&quot; Buddha answered.  &quot;The potential of women to become enlightened is in all ways the same as men.&quot;
<br /><br />However, in some Asian countries, it's believed that only men are able to find enlightenment.  In these areas, Buddhist women can only study Buddhism devoutly then hope that they are reborn as men thier next lifetime. 
<br /><br />Laywomen
<br /><br />The following guidelines have been given to laywomen through the Buddhist writings, Anguttara Nikaya: 
<br /><br />· Be good at your work.
<br /><br />· Work Work skillfully and diligently.
<br /><br />· Handle domestic help adeptly (when relevant) and always treat them reasonably.
<br /><br />· Perform domestic duties efficiently.
<br /><br />· Be a gracious host to the friends and family of your husband.
<br /><br />· Show faithfulness to your husband as well as be frugal with the family's earnings.
<br /><br />· Be faithful so that you will reach enlightenment.
<br /><br />· Practice the 5 precepts as well as practice moral discipline.
<br /><br />· Give with a happy heart and be joyful in charity.
<br /><br />· Learn wisdom (be aware of of the impermanence of everything.)
<br /><br />The Bhikkuni Sangha
<br /><br />A bhikkuni is an a Buddhist nun who is ordained.  
<br /><br />Mahapajapati started the 1st bhikkuni order with a group of five hundred royal women.
<br /><br />Two hundred yrs. later, Emperor Ashoka's son went to Sri Lanki, in the capacity of a Buddhist Missionary, and heard-tell of a princess who desired to join the sangha.  To make that happen though, both bhikkus and bhikkunis were essential.  Additionally, it was necessary for at least 5 bhikkunis be part of the core for the order.   At her personal insistence, Emperor Ashoka's daughter, a devoted Buddhist nun, had been sent to Sri Lanka to create the sangha there.  Hundreds of women in Sri Lanka, enthusiastic about joining Ashoka's daughter Sanghamitta, met up with her right away upon her arrival.  This new Bhikkuni Sanghi, the 1st established outside of India, became a huge victory for Buddhist Women everywhere.
<br /><br />The Bhikkuni order had been thriving until the attack on their country in 1017.   War became the greatest downfall of many other Bhikkuni orders all over the world.  For more than a thousand yrs., the Bhikkuni lineage continues to be broken in countries like Tibet, Thailand and many other Asian countries.     In 2007, Buddhist leaders of every tradition met in Germany at the International Congress on Buddhist Women's Role in the Sangha to re-establish the bhikkuni ordination.  The meeting had been completely successful – the Dalai Lama gave his total support and all of the delegates had been in complete agreement to re-establish the bhikkuni ordination.   However, details are still being worked out.  The Dalai Lama once said that if Buddha were present, he would likely agree, but since he isn't, he (the Dalai Lama) can't act as Buddha.
<br /><br />So where does that leave Buddhist women today?  Throughout most of the world, bhikkunis continue to be subservient to bhikkus.  It is hard to say if the misogynistic quotes or stories really occurred that way or had been merely created by men in a patriarchal system, but the stories affect individuals's attitudes regardless.  Those people who seek power will find it where they can, so Buddha's true intentions may never be known, regarding the subjugation of women.   In more patriarchal (read: oppressive) countries, like Thailand, where bhkkuni ordination does not exist, nor is even acknowledged, that is particularly relevant.

		<document id="212baffd83291a165772d05e5eff66a1" url=""><![CDATA[A Spiritualism Course Review Through the ULC<br/><br/>I would like to start my course review by 1st stating that I have never been big on reading, let alone a person who likes studying information from books.  My insights are from my own personal experiences, research and discovery. What I believe is that we can only understand information that our soul is ready for- if we are not ready for it, then we won't be able to absorb it in this particular lifetime.
<br /><br /> Mature and old souls are much more aware of their spirituality, while younger souls are scarcely able to comprehend such things.  It should then be of no surprise to learn that an overwhelming majority of souls currently on this planet are younger souls.  Souls may get trapped in ego, never following their guidance and learn their life's lesson, so they recycle and repeat until they learn what they need to learn to move forward
<br /><br />Part of the process of the final transitioning is the gradual disconnect from humanity, as we prepare to move forward into the next evolutionary state.
<br /><br />ARmed with this information, I began the Defining Spiritualism course.
<br />      
<br />After completion, I came away with mixed feelings about the course, mainly because of disagreements with the author.  While he says at the end that he never tried to be objective, it truly showed through a number of comments he makes throughout the course.  
<br /><br />However, from a historical overview perspective on philosophy, I liked the course.  I didn't aree with some of the author's personal conclusions.  
<br /><br />Here are a few of those disagreements that I discovered during the &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulcseminary.net%26quot%3B%26gt%3BULC%26lt%3B%2Fa%26gt"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.ulcseminary.net&quot;&gt;ULC&lt;/a&gt</a>; course, which is based upon my own perception of what was written – right or wrong. 
<br /><br />·        The author feels that ‘thought' can't ever answer the question about spiritual truth.  
<br /><br />How can intuition be followed, if you are not able to understand or trust the intuition through thought?  Words may be a limiting factor, but again, if you're ready, information will be decoded enough for you to understand.  Yet, some of the things I have come to learn, even I cannot put them into words… but then again, this information was for me on my path, not meant for everyone else.  
<br /><br />Synchronistic events are what I consider to be thought-related guidance.  While some events may be intuitive, the vast majority are things that occur which are meant to make us ‘think' about what they mean.  They help us to question, ponder, and dig deeper for information within ourselves.  Truly, when you can achieve trust in combined mental, emotional and intuitive guidance, you will begin to understand everything on a much deeper level.
<br /><br />·        The author also made personal statements sounding like fact such as, &quot;Help the people you minister to by encouraging social interaction.  This is such a necessary part of the human condition…&quot;
<br /><br />I can personally tell you that this is not true.  That is the problem with many people, they teach in terms of absolute fact based upon their own personal beliefs and assumptions, that they leave those who don't fit that mold, feeling like there is something wrong with them.  While people around us are excited about events or traveling, etc… we just have a sense that we've already gone through it, so why bother doing it again?  It's easy to become frustrated and even more withdrawn during this time, because so many people think there is something wrong with us, because we're not behaving like everyone else.  The fact is, we're just aware of so much more than those around us, that forcing ourselves to act like them feels pointless.
<br /><br />I believe ministers or anyone for that matter, on a profound spiritual journey, would do well to avoid seeing in personal absolutes when it comes to teaching others.
<br /><br />      In closing my review of this &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulcceremonies.com%26quot%3B%26gt%3BUniversal"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.ulcceremonies.com&quot;&gt;Universal</a> Life Church Seminary&lt;/a&gt; course, I would like to add my favorite Buddhist quote, &quot;Don't believe something, only because I've said it.&quot;  I tell this to everyone I talk to about what I've learned.  Therefore, I tell you now, don't accept what I've told you and do not believe what you read or hear, believe -- only that which you experience yourself, directly.  The answers lie within, not outside of you.

<br /> 
<br />The closest I came to discovering an answer talked about being a Christian and all that has to it.  But, being a Christian is only a very small part of what it means to be spiritually awake.  One site talked about the attributes of a spiritually awake person in a paper titled &quot;The Purpose of Life is &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulcseminary.net%26quot%3B%26gt%3BSpiritual"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.ulcseminary.net&quot;&gt;Spiritual</a> Growth&lt;/a&gt;&quot;.  I can agree with this statement but still it is only a title to a paper.  The paper talks about the fact that there are 2 types of people in this world.  
<br /><br />One is the materialist-minded person and the other is the spiritually-minded person.  The paper says that a person with a &quot;materialistic mind is greedy, selfish, competitive, cold hearted, deceitful, unintelligent, close-minded, ill mannered, unfriendly, easily addicted, overly emotional, easily angered, revengeful, vicious, barbaric, inhumane and war like.  They are destructive through their thoughts, words and actions&quot;.  The paper goes on to describe the &quot;spiritually-minded person as being generous, kind, helpful, cooperative, loving, forgiving, caring, considerate, compassionate, patient, calm, honest, intelligent, logical, open-minded, friendly and peaceful.  They are constructive through their thoughts, words and actions&quot;.
<br /> 
<br />Ok, you are a spiritual person, so what do you do to prove it?  Do you work with the sick and dying?  Do you go to church and pray for all the needy people in this world?  Maybe there are other things you do that you believe proves that you are a spiritually-awakened person.  Or, maybe you just think about all that without doing anything… Maybe…
<br /> 
<br />I want to be a totally awakened spiritual person and I want you to awaken also.  We can change this world from being totally materialistic to be spiritually oriented world in 2012.  2012 will be a year of change, a transitional world into the higher aspects of the spiritual life.  You and I can be a part of that.  We only have to make up our minds to be so by promoting to the world that we are indeed a spiritually awaken person. 
<br /><br />All of the above questions about spirituality have their answers in a positive &quot;yes&quot;.  True spirituality has its place in everything we do, day in and day out. We are all spiritual beings here on this earth and it is one of our goals to find God and practice his teaching in the best way we know how. We are here to search the &quot;scriptures&quot; to find the teachings that best express our spiritual understanding and to evolve spiritually. 
<br />Throughout the history of Man, there have been a number of men and women who have come into this world to show humanity that there is a better path. A better way to look at our life: and a better way to solve our problems so that we understand them and act accordingly. 
<br />&lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulcseminary.net%26quot%3B%26gt%3BSpirituality%26lt%3B%2Fa%26gt"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.ulcseminary.net&quot;&gt;Spirituality&lt;/a&gt</a>; is practicing our belief in God, and practicing our belief in Jesus and his teachings. Spirituality is something that takes place within us and it shows in our life. We can't help showing how our love for God, Allah, Buddha, Jesus affects us. It is something that really cannot be explained, but must be &quot;experienced&quot; to comprehend. It shows in the face of a person who literally &quot;glows&quot; saying, I'm a believer.  –Rev. Ron Koch

<br />The nearest I came to finding an answer talked about being a Christian and all that has to it.  But, being a Christian is only a very small part of what it means to be spiritually awake.  One website talked about the attributes of a spiritually awake person in a paper titled &quot;The Purpose of Life is &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulcceremonies.com%26quot%3B%26gt%3BSpiritual"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.ulcceremonies.com&quot;&gt;Spiritual</a> Growth&lt;/a&gt;&quot;.  I can agree with this statement but still it is only a title to a paper.  Within the paper it gives a statement about the fact that there are two types of people in this world.  
<br /><br />One is the materialist-minded person and the other is the spiritually-minded person.  The paper says that a person with a &quot;materialistic mind is greedy, selfish, competitive, cold hearted, deceitful, unintelligent, close-minded, ill mannered, unfriendly, easily addicted, overly emotional, easily angered, revengeful, vicious, barbaric, inhumane and war like.  They're destructive through their thoughts, words and actions&quot;.  The paper goes on to describe the &quot;spiritually-minded person as being generous, kind, helpful, cooperative, loving, forgiving, caring, considerate, compassionate, patient, calm, honest, intelligent, logical, open-minded, friendly and peaceful.  They are constructive through their thoughts, words and actions&quot;.
<br /> 
<br />Now, what can we do to become totally spiritually awake? Well, I think that the description above of the spiritual-minded person tells all.  We can be that kind, generous and loving person we claim to be 24/7.  It only takes a little mindfulness to make it so.  Keeping in mind those attribute that make us a spiritual person.
<br /> 
<br />I want to be a totally awakened spiritual person and I want you to awaken also.  We can change this world from being totally materialistic to be spiritually oriented world in 2012.  2012 will be a year of change, a transitional world into the higher aspects of the spiritual life.  You and I can be a part of that.  We only have to make up our minds to be so by promoting to the world that we are indeed a spiritually awaken person.

We are here to search the &quot;scriptures&quot; to find the teachings that best express our spiritual understanding and to evolve spiritually. 
<br />The other day, I went to a gathering of people of like mind and we talked about John Paul II, the former Pope of the Roman Catholic Church. One man talked about how John Paul came to him in a dream and healed him of his illness. It was a very moving experience for the man because he was still emotional as he told us about his experience. How can anyone really know if a dream is real or not? I cannot answer that question because it just happens even though there are billions of people in this world who have had similar dreams. The skeptic would scoff at the idea of a dead man coming to a person in his dream and healing them. Many other people wish that something like that would happen to them. 
<br />&lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.onlineseminary.net%26quot%3B%26gt%3BSpirituality%26lt%3B%2Fa%26gt"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.onlineseminary.net&quot;&gt;Spirituality&lt;/a&gt</a>;  is something that is being discussed about throughout the world. It is a very big part of people's conversations. It is talked about on radio and television. It is written about in articles, books, magazines and newspapers. Spirituality is something that is a bit of a mystery for us because we don't have anyone to show us how to be spiritual. Being spiritual is within us. No-one can show us what it is. We all experience it in our own way and it shows up in our lives. I know that I have not solved the question for some of you, but the fact is spirituality is in the ways we practice our faith and belief in the God.  –Rev. Ron Koch
