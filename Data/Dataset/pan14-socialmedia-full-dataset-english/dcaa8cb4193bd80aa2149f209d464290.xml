<br />Heavy with worry
<br />My friends pasted
<br />Troubled and with unpleasant memories
<br />I feel nothing but joy and happiness
<br />At the sound of her voice
<br />My mending heart
<br />Mended for a time.
<br />My heart lifted high at the thought of seeing her once again
<br />Hoping my voice helps her feel the same as I
<br />Then without warning come silence
<br />Not knowing the fate of the other
<br />Has my caring heart said something wrong or frightened her
<br />Do I just need more patients? 
<br />Does she need more time?
<br />Wishing my presents can help her feel many things
<br />It would bring me joy 
<br />And help me feel hole again
<br />To bring her feelings of
<br />Joy and laughter
<br />Warmth and security 
<br />To become a true friend
<br />To know that our time together warms my heart
<br />To the building of a lasting friendship
<br />That will stand all tests ahead of us
<br />I sit by the phone
<br />Waiting for my heart to be lifted high once again
<br />I pray she will call me back

<br />by Crystal Holtz and edited my myself.   
<br /><br />I will never forget the days we once had
<br />The days when you were everything to me
<br />My mind used to tell me we'd be together forever
<br />But now I realize that was all a big dream
<br />The feelings I have for you will never go
<br />I wish I could take back that one regretful day
<br />The day when I let you slide from my arms
<br />Never did I think of the astonishing pain of regrets
<br />That I am having to live through
<br />The thought of you in someone else's arms
<br />Makes my heart shatter into a million pieces
<br />I sometimes wonder if you still think of me
<br />Or if to you, I'm just becoming a face in the crowd
<br />But for now, I'll sit here silently
<br />Remembering all the memories we once shared
<br />Hoping that one day I will feel love again
<br />And put back the pieces of my broken heart
<br /><br />To my best friend &quot;JO&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;YOU WERE THERE FOR ME&quot;
<br />© Erin Porter 
<br /><br />Words escape me 
<br />at this moment 
<br />that seems like the end 
<br />yet it is only the beginning 
<br />when friendships are close 
<br />and dreams are far 
<br />you were there for me. 
<br />Tears fill me 
<br />with memories of both good and bad 
<br />some nearly forgetton 
<br />yet all dear to the heart 
<br />you were there for me. 
<br />In times of trouble 
<br />and in times of thanks 
<br />you stood by my side 
<br />and held me up. 
<br />Through your ever-patient ears 
<br />to your comforting hugs 
<br />you were there for me. 
<br />From that first day 
<br />when I saw you and knew 
<br />that you would love me for who I was 
<br />you were there for me. 
<br />And until the day 
<br />when we are old and gray 
<br />I will always know that 
<br />you are there for me.

Illness, injury, love, lost moments of true greatness and sheer stupidity all occur to test the limits of your soul. Without these small tests, if they be events, illnesses or relationships, life would be like a smoothly paved, straight, flat road to nowhere. 
<br />If someone hurts you, betrays you , or breaks you heart, forgive them. For they have helped you learn about trust and the importance of being cautious to who you open your heart to.
<br /><br />If someone loves you, love them back unconditionally, not only because they love you, but because they are teaching you to love and opening your heart and eyes to things you would have never seen or felt without them.
<br /><br />Make every day count. Appreciate every moment and take from it everything that you possibly can, for you may never be able to experience it again. 
<br /><br />Talk to people you have never talked to before, and actually listen. Hold your head up because you have every right to. Tell yourself you are a great individual and believe in yourself, for if you don't believe in yourself, no one else will believe in you either.
<br /><br />You can make of your life anything you wish. Create your own life and then go out and live it.

<br /><br />© Nick Rausse
<br /><br />Lost in ones own feelings
<br />Emotions thought to have been lost
<br />Now surface in no sense of order
<br />Angry and Confused
<br />Alone and Afraid
<br />Lost in the search for hope
<br />The world small to the view around
<br />The world overwhelming to the mind
<br />Wishing one could turn the mind off 
<br />Even for a moment in time
<br />Time to discover ones self again

<br /><br />Boxed into a corner
<br />Foreboding message taken serious
<br />Secluded from a friendship because of compassion
<br />The thought of loosing one whose heart knows no limits
<br />Tears at the soul like a whirlwind 
<br />Angel of kindness follow your heart
<br />Let me go if you must
<br />Cherished memories will never be lost
<br />Our lives forever entwined together
<br />Life the soil surrounding the roots of a rose
<br />One cannot live without the other
<br />Yet apart the rose is still beautiful

<br />What is seen hurt one to see
<br />A friend in need of comfort but out of reach
<br />If only the one they love could see
<br />The heart of a person that loves without being loved back
<br />Deserving of affection and trust
<br />Having been faithful and honest
<br />Yet stands accused of doing what hasn’t even been thought of
<br />Freedom to associate chosen people revoked
<br />We look in hoping they can feel the love that surrounds them.

There is no way I'm going to miss that... So Thursday I'm leaving the Gibsons, BC the go to a dance with my Kira. Then I'm going to spend the weekend with my kids as well. Things have not been going well for me in the emotions area... be they say there is light at the end of the tunnel. I miss some of my friends but the ones that are true friends I know they always will be. The rest I feel sorry for as in order to know what a true friend is... one must first know what a friend is. So for those people that have never had a true friend I feel for you. It can be a very lonely world for you. For those of you who have true friend... I hope the best for you and hope you never loss them. My friend know that even when I'm far away from them that they are all dear to me and always will be. My best friends are my kids by far... and I'll never let them down. Have a good week all. I am back to work tomorrow for a few days till I go to see the kids. I miss them immensely.
