<br /><br />Phillips Sonicare Diamond Head Electric Toothbrush<br /><br />I use and recommend the Phillips Sonicare Diamond Head Electric Toothbrush.  I see a tremendous improvement in the overall health of my client’s gums in a very short period of time.  It has a new design that fits into the hand very easily.  I, personally  found the older design a bit on the bulky side.  It has a nice matte finish that makes it easy to grip and cleanup is just a few seconds under the tap and there it sits slick, charged and ready to go for three weeks.<br /><br />Speaking of three weeks… The Phillips Sonicare Diamond Head Electric Toothbrush has a carrying case that is a charger with a USB connection to hook directly  to your computer  when you are out of the country.  I have had countless clients explode their electric appliances on trips overseas.   This is truly a unique feature and one my clients embrace.  They now feel confident taking their toothbrush on holidays.  We all experience a better tooth cleaning experience w

<br /><br />Oral Cancer is the forgotten disease in medicine.  It is becoming high risk in young adults.  HPV and oral sex are being linked as factors in our youth.  he prevalence of Oral Cancer is three times the rate of cervical cancer.<br /><br />Someone in the Americas is diagnosed with this disease every hour of every day. If caught early there is an 80% survival rate. 25% of the patients presenting with this disease have no risk factors, an example being, a non smoker, non drinker under 40.The mortality rate has not decreased in 30 years.<br /><br />Have a look in your mouth in the bathroom mirror.

<br /><br />Do you know the difference?<br /><br />Are you ready to make the switch to Real Food Supplements?<br /><br />What is Really in the Vitamin and Mineral Bottles?<br /><br />THIRD GENERATION: Currently, efforts are underway to increase the levels of vitamins and minerals in plants to meet (RDA) nutritional needs. Certain plants soak up minerals at an astounding rate. Our industry uses this technology to grow these plants in water saturated with minerals. The plant absorbs  nutrients through the roots, wraps them in a plant matrix making them three dimensional.  This configuration allows our body recognizes phyto chemicals as food! They meet the RDA as they are standardized.<br /><br />SECOND GENERATION: Second generation supplements include fruits and vegetable extracts from Aloe, for example. Plants bond minerals to many combination’s of amino acids, fats, sugars and phytochemicals making them available to the body. Keep in mind, a single plant cannot supply all the RDA requirements needed to power up our bodies. The

<br /><br />Have you ever wondered what is happening when your gums bleed with brushing and flossing?     Do Your Gums Bleed when your dental health professional does a routine probing?<br /><br />The following step is called probing. I do a complete charting of the pocket depths around each of the teeth.    For the purpose of this blog post, I will discuss only the probing results relating to bleeding gums.<br /><br />The probe measures the depth of the pocket or turtleneck around each tooth in millimeters. Ideal is 0-3 without bleeding, with bleeding, gingivitis. I call this stage 1. Early Periodontists is 4-5, stage 2, and above 6 is Advanced Periodontists stage3. Each stage had a different treatment plan.<br /><br />Keep in mind the body is 37 degrees. Imagine, if you will, what you have eaten since the last time you flossed. Imagine a beach in Hawaii, spread out  a banquet table near the ocean.  Now, watch what happens with the temperature being 37 degrees and 100% humidity. Decomposition is taking place under the gums

<br /><br />Personal Development for Tomorrow’s Success<br /><br />Life for some of us is a Lifelong learning process with personal development being upfront especially if you are starting a home business.<br />Personal Development Is A Life Long Process<br /><br />Personal Development Is A Life Long Process<br /><br />It is easy to go to seminars and listen to the speakers motivate us into action but that motivation soon ends when we get back home to real life.  We purchase all the books and marketing materials to motivate us to change.  We may have read them over once or twice but now, without gentle reminders they soon fade to gray as the materials are float away out of sight out of mind to somewhere.<br /><br />I had the pleasure to meet John Maxwell and highly respect his work around personal development and the HABITS that are required to become the Leader you want to be.  First and foremost you need to lead yourself before you can lead anyone else.<br /><br />Today I pulled out two of his books to remind myself of the principals and practi

<br /><br />Personal Development Opens The Mind Like A Parachute<br /><br />Personal DevelopmentThe winds of wisdom gently maneuver the parachute to and fro as the information taken in is diffused and stored in the brain. To me, this is the basics for growth and development, the cornerstone in personal development, the key successful people embrace for life.<br /><br />When I was much younger I went to a seminar on personal growth and development in the Dental Industry. I still remember the one statement that has stayed with me all these years. “Winners get ahead in the time losers waste.”<br />Personal Development Comes In All Forms.<br /><br />Continuing Education Classes online or in a classroom setting.<br />    Ballroom dancing, to keep one active physically and mentally.<br />    Wine tasting, to develop the palate for the nuances of fine aromas and flavors in the wine.<br />    Taking up a new hobby, from Bridge to Cooking, keeps the mind active and connected to people of like interests.<br />    I also believe volunteering in the commu

<br /><br />Keywords are words or phrases typed into the search bar to narrow down what one may be searching for online.<br /><br />My story –  I am in a MLM (multi-level marketing company) here in Calgary, Alberta.   I often get calls from people searching for my MLM product in Calgary.  In my keywords for my company blog I put my name and where I live in the first sentence along with the MLM name.<br /><br />By doing the keyword research and listing my keywords correctly; I get traffic.  I ask how they found me and time and time again they typed in the MLM and Calgary.<br /><br />The reason I show up is because I have modified the keywords in the introduction on the company blog to reflect I live in Calgary.  It is specific to my area so people searching for the MLM feel confident in placing orders close to their home.  I also have my cell phone on my company blog so they can also call or email me with any questions they may have around the product.<br /><br />Another example is that I am trained in health and wellness.

<br /><br />Wikipedia definition | traditional article marketing <br /><br />Article Marketing<br /><br />Article Marketing<br /><br />“Article marketing has been used by professionals for nearly as long as mass print has been available. A business provides content to a newspaper, possibly on a timely topic such as an article on tax audits during tax season, and the newspaper may use the article and include the business’s name and contact information. Newspapers and other traditional media have limited budgets for gathering content and these articles may be used in the business section of the newspaper.<br /><br />Internet Article Marketing<br /><br />Internet article marketing is used to promote products and services online via article directories.
