Our main attraction was Shaniwar wada and in those days Nava Pul. Meaning new bridge. Even in those days river was dry under the bridge. Our another attraction was cycling, as soon as we got opportunity we used to ride on bicycles like hungry vultures. We used to running from one end of Laxmi road to another. In Alka chowk we relaxed and ate ice-creams. Those  were the days my friends, I thought they would never end etc etc. Deccan Gymkhana was taking shape in those days. We had wonder and awe of the  buildings there. Within next few years we graduated to Good Luck and Lucky restaurants and soon were enjoying the juke box there. As the youth advanced we spent most of our time on Deccan Gymkhana. The blooming girls on Laxmi road and Deccan Gymkhana caught our attention and our evenings were mostly spent there.
<br /><br />Now everything  stands changed in this Metropolis. Yes, Pune is fast becoming a metropolis. It is becoming a city of sky-scrapers, it is becoming a city of crime and at the same time, it is becoming a centre of education. We Marathi people have a soft corner for Pune, as the seat of our erstwhile empire and our capital. Somewhere in our hearts we are proud of this city for it has shown us our glorious past and our valiant roots. But changing culture of this city makes my heart tremble. However this future is inevitable in the case of many burgeonings our nation is safe and sound.

<br />                     A very happy happy and prosperous Gudi Padwa to all Indian friends. This year's Padwa has addded significance since we have won world cup in cricket. In 1983 also we had won world cup under the leadership of Kapil Dev but this time the the hue and cry is more espcially by media. Kapil Dev's act was definitely superior to Dhoni but the hype is louder in case of Dhoni, why? Sheer numbers or powerful media? Many will give credit to powerful and ever louder media which does not lose chance for commeical exploitation of any event. They will do the moutain out of a mole hill. Even die-hard cricket haters like me were in the grip of cricket fever by media propoganda. Switch on any channel of TV at any hour of the day and you get cricket, Dhoni brigade, Sachin, Sahwag or Gautam Gambhir, blah blah blah. It is same the propaganda for nearly a month now. Agreed, we have won the world cup after a gap of 28 years but how long this harrassement?
<br />For the first time in my life, i and my wife enjoyed world cup matches thouroghly friends. Sometimes my wife was hysteric and sometimes she virtually danced. Some of her remarks were really amusing. Pakistani cricketers looked cruel to her and Sri Lankan crikerters were cunnning. Like all Indians she had taken more interest in India-Pakistan cricket match and yes, she learned more about cricket in the same match. Lately i have lost interest in cricket only bexause of media. Why can't Indian media treat crikcet like any other sports? One thing is sure, in this year's matches there was no case of match fixing despite big stakes.

<br />                 Rama’s marriage lasted for 15 days. His all brothers were married at the same time. So there was lot of merry making and feasts. Everyday processions were taken out in Ayodhya. At that time, there  was great fireworks in the sky and people rejoiced. One bad person makes other person mad. Manthara was maid servant for queen Kaikai. She said that Bharat should be prince, why Rama? Once this poison was into her head, Kaikai was mad with envy. She reminded king Dashratha of two boons he had promised her. The king agreed and Kaikai said that by first boon Bharata should be made prince and by the second boon Rama should be sent to forest for fourteen years.
<br />Rama was favorite son of the king. So Dashratha was very sad. But he had to agree to boons. The king had been sick and dying. Rama said that he was too glad to obey Kaikai’s orders. She was also a mother of him. To obey a mother’s orders was his duty. So saying he began to prepare for his journey to forest. Sita said that she would also with him. And Laxmana said that he would go too. When Bharat learned of Rama’s exile, he was very unhappy. He too wanted to go with Rama as Rama was dear to him. All his brothers loved Rama very much and they were ready to do any sacrifice for him. All the citizens were lost in despair. Rama’s mother was very unhappy and second mother Sumitra also was not less unhappy. But Rama had decided to go into exile for 14 years only to keep his father’s word. Rama was a model son to his parents. Jai Shri Rama.

<br />entity, easily available commodity and also ran personality. One should not mind children, they automatically learn and grow, that was the feeling. Our childhood was sans photographs so childhood memories absent. We have no proofs of our childhood. In our childhood a birthday was announced like this, “He has grown like a horse these nine years but look at him squirming in his bed like donkey.” On this background birthdays today are celebrated with great fanfare. How lucky children are of today! Our Aarush’s first birthday was celebrated with great festivity recently in big hotel but the poor fellow was wondering all through the function what is the brouhaha  about. His pictures are lovely as usual, especially his mom feeding him.
<br />                  Two news items  of Kolhapur are eye catching. One is about cleaning of Panchganga river. This river supplying water to the whole city had become dirty. Sakal organized clean Panchganga campaign and it was overwhelmingly supported by young men and women of Kolhapur. Thousands youth flocked to Panchganga with their implements and helped clean the river. It is  a noble work on the part of youth of Kolhapur. On the background of this another news item is very disgracing to police force. It is about sex scandal, 71 lady constables are sent to Kolhapur for training. The surprising thing is even the senior officers are involved in sex scandal.  11 of the ladies are found to be pregnant. One head constable was implicated in the affair. But everyone knew it is the handiwork of all.
<br />Isn’t it a juxtaposition of two opposite news items?

<br />                        Month of May happens to be a month of holidays, carefree leisure and going to somewhere outstation.  Month of May also happens to be a month of overcast skies, mind-boggling mangoes and summer camps for children. Swimming, horse riding, trekking and hobby classes abound in this season. In this rat-race a lay man  does not want his ward to lag behind. Time is precious but children have the problem of time passing these days and that is the crux of the matter. Those, who cannot join such classes or go to outstation, search some ponds to cool themselves in the sweltering heat. And around Mumbai many such ponds thanks to developmental work such as Metro or mines. Many people prefer to go to sea-shores for swimming. Many times these novices drown in the ponds or sea and that these tragedies become inevitable.
<br />                       Nearly 50% of young Indian women marry below the age of 18, a study has shown. Perhaps this is the reason of our population explosion.  First of all, if they marry then that is the decision of their parents and not their own decision. Parents are in a hurry to marry off their daughters in their caste or Biradari, many in their own relations. The caste is very angry if anybody dares to marry his daughter outside the caste. Caste takes revenge in many cases by killing the couple. Such killings are called as honor killings. Supreme court  has said that the culprits of such honor killings should be hanged or death penalty for them. Another important news item is about Kolhapur sex scandal. The 71 lady candidates are now sent to Nagpur for training. All of them were medically examined and it was found only two of are pregnant. Out of them one is married and another unmarried. It is the unmarried girl who has complained about rape and the culprit is apprehended and behind bars. It is said that home minister’s sigh of relief was heard all over Vidhan Bhawan. IG, DGP and the senior police officer have gone to Shirdi for Darshan. Thank you God for saving our police department from the onslaught of media

<br />It is my birthday today, but I spent the morning in viewing photos of Kashmira astonished. Small children make pleasant countenances while observing people. Normally I do not attach very special significance to my  birthday.
<br />In my childhood it was  funny to have a birthday, then it was romantic and then monotonous. Romantic because you were the hero for the day and sometimes monotonous, because of the same false assumptions of being an hero. This year a strange prophecy shadows my birthday, that the world is coming to an end on 21st May 2011. This prophecy is made by world famous  TV  that is broadcast in 65 countries. That means it is a dooms day for many people. I don’t know how many people passed their nights in needless anxiety on19 and 20th May. In fact this prophecy is made every year by some person or a group of persons. Sometimes it is in the form of scientific prophecy, some sky lab was being doomed. A friend of mine wrote to me that sky-lab was destined to fall on us and as such they had organized a party. One striking thing is I have actually attended one such party in which liquor freely flowed and nobody was in senses. Next morning when everyone came to his senses, he heard the shrill voice of his wife instead of the melodious voices of Angels in heaven.
<br />My birthday is a definitely not a pleasant affair friends. See no, the blighters choose only the month of May to spread  rumor of end of the universe. Perhaps they must be getting enough time, since it is the season of holidays, to spread such rumors. God knows, but my birthday is the time of such hilarious celebrations of Dooms Days. One advantage is, it is time of Alphonso mangoes. So sweet loving people enjoy the mangoes pourie and puri. A delicacy enjoyed by Indian common man. It need not be said that I enjoy the same delicacy year in and year out.

<br />Rama and Laxmana were living in Panchwati. They were living in a jungle as per the wish of their of mother. Laxmana had insulted Shurpnakha. She had complained to Rawana, who was a mighty king of Srilanka. He had decided to teach Rama and Laxmana a lesson. Around Rama’s hut was the dense forest of Panchwati.

At that time Wali told Sugriva to take care of his kingdom and wife lest anything should  happen to him. Fighting they entered the cave and for ten days nothing was heard of them. Thinking that both killed one another, after ten days Sugriva came back to Kishkindha and assumed the throne. He married Tara and began to rule the capital. On the twelfth night Wali emerged from the cave. He had killed the rakshas and won the battle. When he learned that Sugriva had become the king and married his wife, he became very angry.

But he had art of flying in the air and very good knowledge of herbal medicines. Maruti and Sugriva got together. They had heard the mighty king Rama had come to Panchwati. They decided to get help of Rama and Laxmana in securing of Kishkingdha.

<br />The most cool boy in our clan, the more methodical lad in our family and the more soft spoken young man in our clan is weded to equally beautiful lass of Dixit clan. With this marriage, the second generation list of marriages among boys has been exhausted. Now all  boys are well married off to suitable brides and their families are well settled. God is in his Heaven and everything is well with the world. Of course, the final marriage will be that of Supriya, our youngest and most darling of the children. After that it will be curtain on the marriages in Dharmadhikari clan.
<br />It started with a pleasant drive to Shagun hall in the early morning, with our Siddhesh. As we entered the marriage hall melodious notes of Shahanai greeted us. The Dixits had made elaborate arrangement of the ceremony in most appropriate manner. The steady trickle of guests continued and hall management was hurrying to see that they are comfortable in every respect. Since the day was extra hot, cold drinks were making rounds and the guests quenched their thirst endlessly. The remarkable fact of ceremony was that the priests were reminding the parties concerned that time is precious. They organized the religious ceremony most efficiently. The entry of bridegroom was  announced by bell and bride was ushered in traditional Doly. It gave a royal touch to the ceremony.  I found the idea very romantic. The hall was jam packed by honorable dignitaries. All our near and dear guests  showed up and graced the occasion. The master of ceremony were Dattu-kaka and Sudhir-kaka and they left no stone unturned to make the ceremony a resounding success.  In this manner most beautiful daughter of Dixits became the daughter-in law of Dharmadhikaris. All is well that ends well, has said Shakespeare. In spite of harsh weather, the satisfaction of attending an impeccable ceremony was writ large on every body’s face. The ceremony ended exactly on dot at four o’clock. But memories of an exquisite ceremony lingered for long time.

He has guided crores of people in his Yoga classes all over the world. He himself has taught and while doing so he has joked, done caricatures. The secret of Ramdeo is his ability to laugh and his gay personality. He is sometimes in India and sometimes in America. He doesn’t believe in appointing his disciples to teach yoga to thousands of novices.  Yoga training he must himself impart may it be to disciples in America or Europe or for that matter to disciples in Asia-Pacific region. On everybody’s TV screen his pleasant personality is seen every morning toiling with thousands of disciples. His popular Kapal Bhati has become a key word in the exercise in the yoga.
<br />including cancer with his Ayurvedic medicines, he says. He has a big factory of Ayurvedic medicines there in his home state, Haryana. He commands amazing energy to handle all this business. My hats off to Baba.
<br />                  Now such a Baba is jumping in the turbulent sea of politics. Baba Ramdeo is a millionere, we can say an honest millioner. Such a man jumps in ongoing war against government and declares to go on fast for the cause of black money. Even Anna Hazare has declared his full support to Baba. It appears that all the bad planets in the horoscope of government are going strong. Soon these people are going to make politics an unwelcome business. Now politics is a roaring business because of corruption. But Anna and Ramdeo Baba are hell bent on corruption to end. My independent opinion is that corruption will stay and Baba and Anna will be defeated. In this game of thief and police, police are defeated in India. If police wins so much the better. Till then let us wish Baba all the luck.

<br />Rawana had decided to teach Rama a lesson as Rama had insulted his sister Shurpanakha. Rawana had a magician friend, Maricha with whom he had come to Panchwati. Every evening the couple Rama and Sita went for a walk in nearby jungle. That time Sita collected some vegetables for evening meal. It was pleasant sojourn enjoyed by Sita as she had for company only  Srirama. One day while walking she saw a golden deer very beautiful,  in the forest. She liked the deer so much that she told Rama to get for her. Sita said that the golden skin of the deer would make a lovely blouse for her. Rama went after the deer without thinking. It was actually the wily Maricha, who had taken form of golden deer. Laxmana was following them at a distance. He told Sita to return to ashrama. He was confident Rama would fetch the deer. Rama went deep in the forest running after the deer. When Rama shot an arrow the deer fell on the ground. But Maricha shouted loudly Laxmana run I am dying. Sita was waiting for Rama anxiously. She thought Rama was in danger. She told Laxmana to run to Rama and help him. But he knew it was impossible. This must be a trick. At last he was ready to go and help Rama. But he  drew a line on the ground before the hut. He warned Sita not to go beyond that line while talking to strangers. That line is known as Laxmana rekha.
<br />                        After sometime a sanyasi or beggar came to the hut. Rawana had taken form of a beggar. He begged for eatables  to Sita. Sita gave him some fruits but not by crossing the line. He refused to take it saying that she must cross the line. At last she crossed the line and offered him the fruits. Rawana lifted her and put her in the chariot hidden in the forest.
<br />The chariot went up in air flew to Srilanaka. In this way Rawana forcibly took Sita with him. Poor Sita cried for Rama but in vain. She managed to throw her ornaments out in hope that Rama and Laxmana would find what had happened.

<br />Dashrath was a dreaded criminal  in our part of  Mumbai city. He had tremendous strength-physical strength- that no one matched. He was a slovenly fellow otherwise had become good gangster. The slum where he was staying was on that east side of railway while we stayed on west of railways. Dashrath was called Dash lovingly by his people. Even police were afraid to confront him alone, since he was not involved in major crime he was ignored by police. I had my empire on the west side. I had many joints of country liquor and drugs etc. and I had complete rapport with the police. I sent lot of materials to Mumbai at that time by local trains and many knew that but no one dared to complain. Naturally there was enmity between Dash and my gang. We never confronted each other and I am sure if he saw me, he would have definitely killed me. Police wanted that to happen so they were deliberately spreading rumors. Then the news came that Dash had joined Mukund’s gang.
<br />              Now this Dash had weakness for women which ultimately lead to his death, he had raped many juicy damsels in his part and nobody complained because of his fear. It so happened that he was drunk and he wanted to rape the comely girl. She was weeping but he was determined to ravish her. He lifted her in his hands and brought in his hut, fully drunk but fully in control of his senses. He undressed her and fell on her and ravished her as he pleased. Dash raped her two or three times before falling asleep in deep sleep. The damsel took her clothes and ran away from him.
<br />It is said that in dead of night some 4/5 people came and murdered Dash as he lay in his slumber. They cut his organs and placed them on his heart. In the morning police found the pathetic sight. Dash had become victim of raping the innocent girl. Sinners do not die before their appointed hour, it is very true folks.

<br />This is an attempt to answer Amol’s query ‘what proof you have about the existence God’. You know that man’s life is complicated and more complicated is his body. In his body there are thousands of different bones and muscles and innumerable glands and their functions. If one of the function is disturbed or in case of system’s failure it can cause man insufferable pain, okay? You may explain it on basis of science but can you explain this please------------
<br />In the recent blasts a small girl miraculously escaped unhurt. Or a small baby who fell from thirteenth floor of tower in Mumbai was caught by a woman and saved, that too miraculously. Similarly in the train accidents many people are killed whereas many others are saved. We say they are miraculously saved, but can you explain these miracles? So my friend, there are many things in this universe that has no explanation on scientific basis. Not a single leaf of a plant moves without the permission of God. There is no exaggeration in this statement my friend. There is some power which controls the movements of this universe. It is of couse beyond the comprehension of the  man. Those who understand the decree of God are called as Sages. You may shun the existing religious practice as going to temple or church but you can not deny the existence of God. God is there and God is omnipresent. God is not a man nor he/she is woman. God is all pervasive entity that is in every man and woman. So as long as we say that miracles do happen, we cannot deny the existence of God.
<br />God is great, God is omnipresent and God is all powerful. So my friend showing disrespect to God is an unpardonable mistake.
<br />                   God is merciful and God is great!

<br /> God’s presence must never be doubted by anybody. I know there is lot of suffering in this world. Hundreds of children are going hungry and many people are having hardships. But you know Karma theory, by that theory everything can be explained and everything falls in line. As man sows so he must reaps. It is as simple as  that. Jews suffered in second world war because of their doing. But Karma theory assumes the rebirth of man and according to me rebirth is total fallacy. On scientific theory it is proved that rebirth of man is not possible. You know matter can not be made nor it can be destroyed by any means. It is universally accepted truth. We know that population of India has grown by leaps and bounds. From where these large no people have emerged? One explanation for this phenomenon is as follows-----they have destroyed an equal numbers of plants. You know plants have been cut on large scale paving road for large population. So everything is there, everything gets a rebirth according to decree of God and everybody has to suffer his misdeeds and atones for his sins.
<br />I believe that man has no rebirth for reasons given above. Or he has rebirth on some other planet, or galaxy other than Earth. Karma theory is not helpful in that context. It is beyond the explanation of man. Man has to learn many secrets of God. So I entreat you, have faith in God. Spare some  15 mins after your bath for God.  Pray with your heart aleast remember Him with full concentration. Who knows, your devotion may register at God’s pulpit. If not anything you will get satisfaction that you worship Him. Your mom will  get the solace that her son finally bowed before God. Have faith that God is there, even a diehard person like me has faith in God then why not you. Whatever our arguments with God, we can complain at the time of our meeting with God in our daily meetings, isn’t it? God is supreme.

<br />My most favorite hero of yester years, my darling boy of Hindi screen and a man of true grit, has died on August 14th in Mumbai. It is unfortunate that the popular hero was suffering from kidney trouble. A man who had given scores of people pure joy had to suffer dialysis in the end. But God is great because he was relieved of his pain soon and he breathed his last peacefully. Shammi had to struggle in initial years in film industry. I remember when I was in 8th grade, I saw for first the time his movie and it was Tumasa Nahi Dekha. To tell you the truth, we were mesmerized by his charm, his romance and his personality. Overnight he became our hero. Those were the days of Raj Kapoor, Dilip Kumar and Deo Anand. These three heroes were ruling supreme on the minds of film goers. Shammi came, he saw and he conquered hands down.
<br />The most melodious songs were picturised on Shammi. His Brahmachari, Kashimir Ki Kali, Dil Deke Dekho, Tisari Manzil, Prince, An Evening In Paris, Manoranjan and of corse Tumasa Nahi Dekha has given heavenly joy to Hindi music lovers. In an era when Hindi film music was on the waning, his films have given the most memorable songs to lovers of film music. He worked with most of popular heroines of his era, including Nutan, Sadhana, Rajashri, Mala Sinha, Hema Mallini, Sharmila Tagore and Tanuja. Shammi also played some comedy roles like Dil Tera Diwana in which he played havoc with Mehmood. His other popular movie is China Town in which he played a double role. The music of China Town is land mark in Hindi film industry with song Mera Nam Chin Cho. The versatile actor passed away is shocking thing to many of his fans like me. I liked his personality and charm very much as Elvia Prestley. May his soul rest in peace. God bless his soul.

<br />The show down between Anna’s team and the government is on 16th August at New Delhi. Anna declared his intention to go an indefinite fast against corruption in the country. He says that appointment of Lokpal in centre and states, under whose preview even a prime minister and judiciary will be brought, must check the rampant corruption in the country. That is why the gentleman and his scores of followers have been agitating for several months now. He has a large following in the nation especially of youth and ladies. In India corruption is a gigantic problem. It is all pervasive and all encompassing. Right from a small time peon to central minister even the central cabinet is corrupt, he alleges. Because of corruption there is inflation and the prices are rising. To nip in the bud this corruption is next to impossible, but with appointment of Lokpal it can be effectively contained.
<br />The common man believes in the integrity of Anna and his team. They are in agreement with Anna that  70% corruption can be curtailed by Lokpal bill. Now there are two Lokpal bills, one  presented by Anna team and the another  government. Govt’s bill is called by Anna as a Jokepal bill. Whereas government is adamant on pushing its own bill which is not in confirmation to what Anna’s team desires. Yesterday on 15th August, on our independence  day, Anna Hajare had organized a press meet in which he declared his determination to fight the corrupt government unto death. He announced that the agitation will be by peaceful method. If arrested he appealed to common man that he will continue the fast in jail. Annna is detained today along with his trusted comrades’ like Kiran Bedi and Arwind Kejariwal. So another Sue Keye is in making by our ruling party-UPA.

<br />In the whole handling of Anna Hazare’s case the lack of maturity on the part of Delhi police is evident. The lack of feelings on the part of government is discernible. See the whole chain events that to led to arrest-
<br />1.	At 6.30—Mayura Ganj ANNA woke up and prayed. At that time Anna’s  party did not know, but they had an inkling as to  what lay in store for them.
<br />2.	7,00  Police arrived on the scene and Anna was taken in custody and apparently taken to CS PARK. But he was actually taken to police mess where he was detained for two hours. Meanwhile the mob of his supporters was increasing. They were shouting slogans at top of their voices.
<br />3.	12.00  Anna was moved to magistrate’s office. A mob of 5k was already there shouting Bharat Mata Ki jay. In spite of the fact that  rule 144 is proclaimed the mob was increasing by the throngs. People were gathering almost anywhere on the streets of Delhi. The whole nation is wakened to the call. There was feeling that something untoward is happening. There was anger and frustration in the minds of people. There was a feeling that government is doing injustice to Anna. The participation of youth and ladies is the most surprising fact of the proceedings. Thousands of young men and women had voluntarily participated in the agitation. They were donning the caps bearing Anna’s name. right from Mumbai and New Delhi to small hamlet like Ralegan Siddhi, thousands of youth in procession took out a march. It was a rare show of strength and wonderful show of solidarity.
<br />4.	3.00 Anna Hazare is officially arrested under section 151 of IPC. And taken to Tihar jail. Where he is lodged with Kalamdi, what a juxtaposition.

<br />The millions of youth in this country never asked this question. They accepted his leadership unquestionably, unequivocally. Anna Hazare first came into limelight in 1985 when he agitated for his village Ralegan Siddhi. He made many reforms in his village absolutely not relying on the government help. Anna provided the villagers employment and taught them the habits of cleanliness and good housekeeping. His reforms became  the talk of the town. During this period he agitated with local and state governments several times. Because of his agitations some of the ministers had lost their cabinet births in state assembly, in Maharashtra. Anna shot into national politics with the issue of Lokayaukta bill. He needs an ombudsman on corruption. He is a man of great integrity and honesty. He believes that corruption has corroded all walk of life in INDIA. And this belief is now ingrained in the minds of millions of Indians especially youth.  This is the success of  this great leader. He has given the clarion call to millions of Indians to do or die.
<br />Of late many cases corruption got publicity including Bofors, Adarsha, Two G scam, Sand mafia, drug mafia etc. add to this corruption in common man’s life. Go for any document such as a domicile certificate, thousands of rupees in bribe you have to pay. Public is suffering in all this cases. You pay the bribe and still lot of procrastination on the part of government clerks. This is all infuriating to common man or Am Aadami.
<br /> Because of the corruption there is price rise. So this all encompassing corruption must be nipped in bud, Anna says. The call of Anna Hazre is supported by  millions of his followers all over the country, from students to villagers and urbanites.

<br />On the 10th day of his fast Anna gave a speech on Ramlila ground before thousands of his followers. Now Anna fast is entering 12th day and he is showing terrible resilience in his fasting. He told his followers many things from his past experiences of the government handling of farmers’ grievances and corruption. The people in this country are sovereign not the parliament. Anna forcefully said that the idea is a mistake that parliament is sovereign. The elected members of parliament are servants of public. The people in this country are plagued by corruption and this is the main issue now. Corruption is a all pervasive devil which has  corroded life at all levels. It is at the level of a peon as well as in high places. The common man is really harassed by this corruption. He remembered  that when he was a youth of 18 years, how he belabored a cop for demanding bribe from a poor farmer. Anna decided there and then to fight corruption in life and ever since he has made it the mission of life. He lives in temple and sleeps in the temple, he has not married in life. But this 74 years feeble man is rock solid in his determination to fight corruption at all levels. Now the people are saying that parliamentary  procedures are slow and that debate has to be made in parliament on various points before any law could be made. However Anna has made three main demands to government. They are a strong Lokpal at the centre with power to punish and imprison the corrupt officers. Secondly prime minister, parliamentarians and CBI in lokpal’s ambit and thirdly citiens charter should be drawn and published. Anna is shrewd man. He said that the governemtn has many times deceived him and he will not be deceived this time. Now government is ready to table the Janlokpal bill before the parliament and BJP also decided to support it. If that happens, let us hope that Anna’s fast ends on happier note.
<br />Annna Hazare ended his fast as a victory of people on 8/28.

<br />The first day of Diwali is called Narak- Chaturdashi. All festivals in India are religion based. It is called Narak Chaturdashi because it is fourteenth day. On this day Naraksur, a great evil giant was killed by Lord Krishna and thousands of girls were freed from his captivity.  Indian girls give special treatment to men. Married girls give to their husbands or unmarried girls give to their brothers. My wife awakened me early morning. She massaged me with perfumed oil and Utane—special powder of various herbs. She made me sit on a special seat and massaged my hair, head and whole body carefully. She painstakingly rubbed my limbs and neck. I was very  much indebted to her for this royal treatment. Even the bath room was decorated for the royal bath. My wife took me to bath room and gave me a thorough bath of warm water and using expensive soap. She had taken complete charge of my bath, she was rubbing my different parts and pouring soothing water and I was enjoying this royal bath immensely. As if a deity was giving me royal bath and I was her disciple. She was giving me the instructions and I was mechanically moving my parts to her. So wonderful was the experience that we both were lost in it. After the royal bath, she made me wear new clothes. Then she treated me to royal feast of Laddoo, Gilebi, chiwada, chakali, sev and halwa. After the sumptuous meal, she gave a glass of warm kesar milk to drink. Thus it was singular morning of Narak chaturdashi. O God let my wife love me like this for years to come.

<br />                               My grand son—my daughter’s first child, Aarush came to us in 
<br />           summer vacation of 2012. The moment he set foot in our home, he perused
<br />           every face carefully. Then he went around our home and observed all
<br />           things. He then picked up two brooms in his two hands and brandishing as 
<br />           if he is a warrior, he began cleaning things assiduously. We laughed but he 
<br />           ignored us  and continued till both the brooms were snatched. Then all
<br />           around introductions were made. This your Grandpa, this is your Grandma
<br />           this your aunt etc. which he bored stoically, his activities of knowing things
<br />           continued unabated. He is such a darling boy that everybody wanted to
<br />           touch him or kiss him. But he resisted and indulged in handling every thing
<br />           new. Very exuberant and happy the boy is, he never tires of exploring new    
<br />           corners in the house. He runs faster than a lightening from one corner to
<br />           another. He will pick up anything most unusual and throw around or just keep 
<br />           in his hand. Or if thing is like a stick, he brandishes it like a warrior waging
<br />           war. Aarush is a very cute boy. He immediately became the darling of entire
<br />           household.
<br />           his favorite pass-time is his laptop. He plays with it for hours together.
<br />           Another good thing is his eating habits. He eats whatever food his mum
<br />           feeds him and occasionally drinks water from his bottle. If his daddy scolds
<br />           he would keep his two hands on his ears. As if he is not listening to his daddy
<br />           or saving himself from the punishment. My first meeting with Aarush was a 
<br />           hypnotizing memorable experience. Aarush has completed two years last
<br />           month.

<br />                            When I was in Berreili, I was just a toddler. But my memories are very vivid. I still remember a wide expanse with rain falling. The rain was in sheet of water falling incessantly. The whole atmosphere was drenched and wet with torrential rains. We friends standing in a corner and playing in the rain. The whole green expanse was blurred due to torrential rains. It was the most happy period of my life. In the scuffle in rain, our clothes becoming dirty. But we were not worried. Spanking was the standard punishment given by our mums but we suffered it. The joy of playing in the rains and the rain water pools was extremely hilarious. I see vividly those big trees on the green ground becoming slippery. Every leaf of the tree dripping and swaying in the wind. The sheet after sheet of rain falling and whole expanse engulfed in the atmosphere, what a beautiful scene! Our minds were full of joy and we never knew what to do.
<br />                  Sometimes when the lightening danced and made the scene horrifying, our mums would shout and order us to return to the safety of our homes. But even then I would stand in the window, savoring the whole scene. When force of the rain gradually diminished in the evening, we again gathered on the ground for playing our rainy season games. But the rains would give us little respite and again it started drizzling. We had to go to shelter but that does not dampen our spirits. There also we found something for merry making. Young as we were and always happy in every situation. Those were the days my friend------.do you remember the song?
