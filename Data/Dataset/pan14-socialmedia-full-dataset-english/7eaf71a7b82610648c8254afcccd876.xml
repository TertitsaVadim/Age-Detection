The government has the power to take away your freedom for the remainder of your life. A very complex process starts to operate the moment that you are arrested by the police. It truly is daunting and overwelming. <br />            Nevertheless, these are generalities only. The actual answer will depend on the sort of crime you were arrested for, the circumstances surrounding it, the county you are in, etc. Only those who understand the criminal law process, and know how to make it work, will be able to genuinely let you know what you should expect in your particular case. This is definitely one area of the law you do not ever want to handle without any help. <br />            Experienced  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.asianave.com%2Fyour_page%2Fblog%2Fview_posting.html%3Fpid%3D4338523%26amp%3Bprofile_id%3D35717581%26amp%3Bprofile_name%3Denolabvallecillo%26amp%3Buser_id%3D35717581%26amp%3Busername%3Denolabvallecillo"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.asianave.com/your_page/blog/view_posting.html?pid=4338523&amp;profile_id=35717581&amp;profile_name=enolabvallecillo&amp;user_id=35717581&amp;username=enolabvallecillo</a>   <br />            A good criminal defense attorney will usually provide a no charge consultation to any individual charged with a crime. You should take advantage of that no cost consultation asap. Having an experienced criminal defense lawyer is extremely important to successfully getting through the criminal process. Get a free preliminary consultation by calling a Lawyer In Houston TX right now, round the clock, 365 days a year.  <br />            Listed here are the steps you may expect to happen, and what each step within the process means to you:  <br /><br />Stop and Arrest <br />            The whole process begins with a stop or an arrest by the authorities. A stop  is not really  as formal as an arrest. A law enforcement officer will stop you to make inquiries. They cannot stop you unless they have a reasonable belief you violated what the law states. What is defined as a valid &amp;ldquo;reasonable suspicion&amp;rdquo;? There are a million cases answering that question and a Lawyer Houston TX is going to be capable of giving you a great many examples during your no charge consultation. <br />            Nevertheless, remember that you always have the right to remain silent, even if you are just stopped and questioned. You do&amp;nbsp;not&amp;nbsp;have to respond to any questions from law enforcement at any time. In reality, everyone should realize their constitutional rights regarding criminal law.  <br />            If you are in a vehicle, the law enforcement officer may very well ask to search it. The authorities cannot search your vehicle unless they have &amp;ldquo;probable cause&amp;rdquo;, or if you consent. Some might seek your consent because they do not quite have &amp;ldquo;probable cause.&amp;rdquo; You do not have to provide your consent to a search of your car. They may search your car later, however your lawyer will be able to then challenge the probable cause the police asserted as a reason to search the vehicle. Should you give your consent, law enforcement do not need any other reason to search your car, and your lawyer will have substantially less to challenge in court. <br />            &amp;ldquo;Probable cause&amp;rdquo; is more serious than &amp;ldquo;reasonable suspicion&amp;rdquo;, however there are a million cases explaining it too and a Houston Lawyer will give an explanation of those during your consultation. You cannot challenge a law enforcement officer's assertion of probable cause until afterwards, in the courtroom. Once again, let your attorney deal with that question later. <br />            Frequently, a police officer might charge you should they have probable cause to believe you committed a criminal offense, or if there is a warrant out for your arrest. In cases where a stop and search bring about an arrest, you ought to in no way resist it. If it isn't  valid, you will want to do so, nevertheless you cannot legally challenge it until later. Resisting arrest can be a crime  alone . The most appropriate advice if you are arrested is to be calm, always be silent, and demand an attorney before they ask you any type of questions.  <br />            Booking <br />            After being arrested, the officer will &amp;ldquo;book&amp;rdquo; you. This is the process where they take your fingerprints, get your mug shot, do a background check, and ask you questions. Remember, you have the right to remain silent and the right to demand a lawyer. You do definitely not have to respond to questions. They aren't going to let you out of jail even in the event you respond to virtually all their questions. Just be calm, always be silent, and let your attorney deal with things later. That is certainly the best you can do. <br />            Charging <br /><br />The charge originates from the prosecutor, absolutely not law enforcement. The victim does not get to charge you, and contrary to popular belief, they don&amp;rsquo;t get to drop the charges either. The prosecutor will often take into consideration the wishes of the victim, but they do not have to. You are in the hands of the state after being arrested. They cannot hold you forever, however. You must be arrested for a crime within a certain limited amount of time or they have got to release you. <br />            Arraignment <br />            This is where the Judge or Magistrate will formally read your charges and tell you your legal rights. You should have asserted your right to a lawyer before now. If not, do so at this time. If you are asked how to plea, and you do not have a Houston lawyer, you ought to  say &amp;ldquo;not guilty.&amp;rdquo; <br />            The Magistrate will decide whether or not you ought to be released, and if so, how much your bail should be. Bail is the amount of cash you, or another person else, has to post with the court so they can be sure you will reappear. If you do not, your bond will be forfeited, and the county gets it. <br />            If bail is set, someone needs to post it for you or hire a bail bondsman to accomplish this. In the event you hire a bail bondsman, and you run off, the bondsman loses the bail money to the court. If that happens, they send someone after you &amp;ndash; a bounty hunter. Additionally, there will be a warrant out for your arrest. Sometimes you will be released on your own &amp;ldquo;recognizance&amp;rdquo;, which just means there is no bail. But you are currently in the system and definitely will have to appear for further proceedings. <br />            Discovery <br />            Discovery is known as a pre-trial process where the prosecutor must give certain details to your Houston Lawyer. Your Lawyer In Houston TX gets to see all the evidence against you some time before trial. There are no secret, last minute witnesses allowed. <br />            Pre-Trial Motions <br />            This is the very best reason to remain silent, not give your consent to a search, and demand an attorney in the event you are arrested. Your Houston TX Lawyer may prepare any number of pre-trial motions. They commonly ask the Court to exclude certain evidence from trial if it was obtained in an illegal or impermissible manner. It is difficult to suppress evidence if you spoke voluntarily or had given consent to a search.             <br />            Plea Bargaining <br />            This is known as a fancy word for negotiations.  If the two sides reach an agreement, you will generally have to plead guilty to one or more of the criminal charges to acquire the deal which has been reached. This involves going to court, answering several questions from the Judge, and indicating to the court on the record that you are guilty to the charge agreed upon by your Lawyer In Houston TX and the prosecutor. <br />            Trial <br />            If the prosecutor and your Houston TX Lawyer cannot reach an agreement on a plea bargain, you will typically go to trial. Trial is where the government needs to put on evidence that you committed a crime, generally including producing witnesses live in court to testify. You do not need to testify. You do not have to put on any evidence whatsoever. The government needs to prove its case, and it must prove it beyond a reasonable doubt. <br />            Sentencing <br />            If you are found guilty, or should you enter a plea of guilty based on a plea bargain, you will undoubtedly be sentenced by the Court. The Judge will make a decision on the appropriate punishment. This can end up being anything from probation to active jail time. There are guidelines that apply and give the Judge a general range of punishment choices. <br />            An skilled Houston Criminal Lawyer can certainly do a lot for you at sentencing, including ensuring that all the procedures are followed, arguing for lesser guidelines, and arguing circumstances that would allow the Judge to sentence you to less than that called for within the guidelines. Also, a criminal defense lawyer might help you prior to sentencing by letting you know what measures you can take to make the Judge more likely to be lenient on you. For instance, if you are arrested for drunk driving, and take a class or go to rehab, the Judge may take that into consideration when sentencing you. <br />            Aggressive Lawyer Houston TX <br />            I have attempted to provide a useful overview of the criminal process, with a few tips on how best to handle important things at every stage. Nevertheless I must repeat my very first and most important advice here: call  your Houston Lawyer the moment a criminal charge is made against you. It is no joke, and you could lose your protection under the law, your cash, and your independence. <br />            Remember, an experienced  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2F.posterous.com%2FHouston-Lawyer%3A-You"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://.posterous.com/Houston-Lawyer:-You</a>'ve-Been-Charged-With-Burglary.-Now-What?  provides a free consultation for any individual arrested for a criminal offense.

Don't take chances. A Cocaine charge won't merely disappear. It is very important to have an experienced criminal defense lawyer who has an in-depth knowledge of what the law states, dedication to you, as well as a familiarity with the county prosecutor's policies. Should you have been arrested for a drug related crime, get in touch with The Leading    right now for aggressive, knowledgeable help.<br />What Is Cocaine?<br />Cocaine is extracted from the leaves of the coca bush.  Cocaine and Crack Cocaine are powerful and particularly addictive illegal drugs. Cocaine is mainly grown in Columbia, Peru and Bolivia South America and it is classified as a Schedule II drug, which means it has an exceedingly high potential for misuse and dependency. You will find two primary varieties of Cocaine. The first is the powdery kind. It is used for snorting up the nasal area. The second is freebase, also known as Crack Cocaine, used for smoking. A smaller portion of Cocaine addiction is carried out intravenously. When Cocaine is snorted, the  powder is inhaled  into the nasal area where it is readily absorbed into the bloodstream. Once Cocaine reaches the brain, dopamine is released, stirring pleasurable feelings. Because it is a stimulant, Cocaine has usually been a popular party drug. Cocaine is easily dealt on the streets due to the fact that it's sold in small packets. <br />What is Crack Cocaine? <br />Crack Cocaine, known as Crack, is a term for the smokable type of Cocaine. Crack is a slang name given for the type of Cocaine which has been prepared into a smokable substance. Smoking Crack Cocaine delivers large amounts of the substance into the lungs, creating an immediate and powerful euphoric feeling. The rush, or high, is normally quite intense, yet doesn't  last very long. The Crack Cocaine rocks are ignited in a Crack pipe and the  vapors are then deeply inhaled. Crack Cocaine has emerged as a major drug of abuse in the past twenty to twenty-five years. The term Crack refers to the popping sound heard when it's heated. <br />Hire The  Top Houston Criminal Lawyers <br />What are the Effects of Cocaine Abuse? <br />Cocaine addiction or Crack Cocaine addiction is often identified with a individual who is compulsively looking for and using Cocaine or Crack Cocaine, in spite of the negative consequences. The physical signs of Cocaine abuse can vary, depending on the person. For one, Cocaine acts as an appetite suppressant so Cocaine abusers quite often aren't hungry and end up losing large quantities of weight. Cocaine addicts often go on binges, in some cases for many days. The road to Cocaine addiction can start with occasional use only at parties. Over time, a person's ability to decide not to take the drug gradually erodes. Cocaine or Crack Cocaine addiction becomes compulsive and addictive mainly because of the ensuing enjoyable feelings. <br />The effects of Cocaine use consist of heart attacks, respiratory failure, strokes, and seizures. Large amounts can trigger bizarre and violent behavior. In exceptional instances, sudden death can happen on the first use of Cocaine or unexpectedly thereafter. The short-term physiological consequences of Cocaine include constricted blood vessels; dilated pupils; and increased temperature, heart rate, and blood pressure. Large amounts (several hundred milligrams or more) intensify the user's high, but could possibly also lead to bizarre, erratic, and violent behavior. These users may experience tremors, vertigo, muscle twitches, paranoia, or, with repeated doses, a toxic reaction closely similar to amphetamine poisoning. Some users of Cocaine report feelings of restlessness, irritability, and anxiety. Cocaine-related deaths are quite often a result of cardiac arrest or seizures followed by respiratory arrest. Use of Cocaine in a binge, during which the drug is taken repeatedly and at increasingly increased doses, leads to a state of growing irritability, restlessness, and paranoia. This may very well lead to a full-blown paranoid psychosis, in which the individual loses touch with reality and encounters auditory hallucinations. <br />Street Names<br />Cocaine goes by the street names of coke, snow, flake, blow and many others. Cocaine slang words are in no short supply, no matter where you go. Because the authorities agencies work as hard as they do to stop the sale and distribution of Cocaine, users and dealers have incorporated tag words to identify the drug or the utilization of the drug without any  having to mention it by name.<br />Penalties <br />Being charged with Cocaine offenses are extremely severe in Texas and carry state and federal mandatory minimum sentences, in certain cases. There's been much controversy surrounding this law, that makes it much worse to be convicted of criminal charges associated with Crack Cocaine than regular Cocaine. The controversy lies within the fact that both illegal drugs contain the same exact active ingredient and most say that the disparity in sentencing is unfair. <br />Twenty-five years ago Congress enacted serious mandatory minimum sentences, condemning thousands of largely low-level, mostly nonviolent drug offenders to years, in some cases decades in jail. In part because of these and similar &amp;quot;sentencing guideline&amp;quot; penalties, the United States today is experiencing an incarceration rate unmatched in our country's history or any other.<br />Although Congress voted last year to substantially reduce -- although not eliminate -- the sentencing disparities between Crack and powder Cocaine, Crack still earns  substantially additional time than powder. And this verdict clarifies that those stronger penalties apply to freebase and coca paste, as well as Crack. <br />In the majority of places, prosecutors do not file charges for a small quantity of Cocaine, though not in Houston. Each and every narcotics possession, even a tiny quantity of Cocaine, can mean a charge and conviction - and that means a criminal background. Because it is classified as a narcotic drug under Texas law, the criminal charges filed by the prosecution in a Crack Cocaine or Cocaine base criminal offense may possibly consist of possession of a narcotic drug, sale of a narcotic drug, transportation of a narcotic drug and possession for sale of a narcotic drug. <br />Defense for a Cocaine Charge<br />The sooner you contact The Leading  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Ftibetrailway.org%2Fforum%2Fprofile.php%3Fmode%3Dviewprofile%26amp%3Bu%3D443827"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://tibetrailway.org/forum/profile.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=443827</a> , the more options there may well be to reduce the consequences.

Marijuana is a Schedule I substance under the Controlled Substances Act, classified as having a high potential for abuse. Street names for marijuana include grass, pot, weed, Mary Jane, dope, indo, and hydro. Marijuana possession laws can certainly impose strict penalties under specific situations.<br />              Possession of marijuana (sometimes often called simple possession) is regarded as the common drug criminal offenses within the United States. Regarded as a misdemeanor in a majority of states, marijuana possession penalties include fines, probation, and/or community service. Criminal possession of marijuana is the next level up in marijuana possession crimes and consists of possession of marijuana in a public place where it is either burning or in open public view in quantities of more than two ounces but less eight oz .. Criminal possession of marijuana is also a misdemeanor but the repercussions increase along with the chance of prison time.<br /><br />Theoretically, under federal drug law, the possession of marijuana, in any amount, is punishable by up to one year in jail including a minimum fine of $1,000 for a first conviction. Additional convictions and larger amounts result in much stiffer penalties. Fairly few marijuana possession court cases give rise to a felony level crime. Marijuana distribution, however, is always a felony under federal law. The sale of under 50 kilograms of marijuana (the smallest amount category) is punishable by 5 years in jail along with a $250,000 fine.<br />Marijuana is generally consumed in its organic state, the plant  on its own used in various ways to produce a hallucinogenic effect on the user. Abuse and use of the cannabis plant as a means for getting high dates back to biblical times. The advent of laws criminalizing the use of the drug occurred sometime during the 20th century, with battles to legalize the use of marijuana argued ever since, its use among Native Americans in religious ceremonies and the use of the drug by cancer patients to alleviate nausea being the most recurrent arguments used for its legalization, including a significant change in the marijuana possession laws.<br />              Marijuana production's principal supply is Mexico. Nearly all foreign-produced marijuana accessible within the United States is smuggled into the country from Mexico over the Mexico border by criminal groups. Mexican criminal groups control nearly all of wholesale marijuana distribution in the U.S., with Asian criminal groups that bring in the product over the Canadian border running a close second. The potency of Canadian marijuana being deemed finer quality than the Mexican version has resulted in an increase in Asian control of marijuana production and distribution. According to the National Drug Threat Assessment 2007, high potency Canada-based smuggling, distribution and production groups are increasing, giving rise to large-scale cannabis cultivation in large outdoor sites by both Mexican and Asian groups. Moreover, in an effort to stay competitive in the higher potency marijuana distribution trade, Asian groups have begun operating indoor grow sites in homes throughout the Pacific Northwest and California. The trend is to purchase or rent a house, customize the house for the purpose of producing two to four crops of cannabis and walking away from the property after the crops are harvested.              <br />              Challenges to existing marijuana production and distribution laws are ongoing, with a number of states decriminalizing certain marijuana usage for specific health conditions. Nevertheless , in United States v. Oakland Cannabis Club, the United States Supreme Court ruled that marijuana has no medical value as determined by Congress. The court&amp;rsquo;s opinion stated that: &amp;ldquo;In the case of the Controlled Substances Act, the statue reflects a determination that marijuana doesn't have any medical benefits worthy of an exception beyond the confines of government-approved research projects.&amp;rdquo;<br />In 2002, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit issued a ruling that upheld the Drug Enforcement Act&amp;rsquo;s determination that marijuana should remain a Schedule I controlled substance, the most restrictive schedule under the Controlled Substance Act. The marijuana debate and court battles will certainly continue to occasionally appear in the United States Court system for years to come.<br />              Defenses for those guilty of breaking marijuana possession laws, and distribution of marijuana laws, often revolve around the misuse of law enforcement power to search and seize property. Unlawful search and seizure, illegal surveillance, and entrapment are the primary means of defending an arrest of marijuana possession or marijuana distribution.<br />              Houston Marijuana Possession Defense Lawyer: Hire the Most Effective  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ziki.com%2Fen%2Fwoodrow-estes-3%2B375413%2Fpost%2FBest-Attorneys-In-Houston%3A-Defenses-For-Drug-Violations"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.ziki.com/en/woodrow-estes-3+375413/post/Best-Attorneys-In-Houston:-Defenses-For-Drug-Violations</a>?|Effective-Defenses-For-Drug-Offenses+12997719 <br />Texas courts consider marijuana possession charges very seriously, and so should you.

More U.S. counties (48%) report that methamphetamine is the main illegal drug problem in the country - more than cocaine (22%), marijuana (22%) and heroin (3%) put together.  Meth lab seizures have increased 577 percent nationally since 1995.  Methamphetamine, or &amp;quot;speed,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;crank,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;chalk,&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;ice&amp;quot; among many others, has been addicting individuals for years. But illegal production and use of the highly addictive stimulant have exploded in the last couple of years, spawning what some professionals call America's first rural drug epidemic.  Methamphetamine is a powerful stimulant that can cause a high that will last from six to 24 hours. Once favored largely by West Coast bike gangs, methamphetamine is now spreading country wide. Based on US government surveys, treatment for Methamphetamine addiction has more than quadrupled since 1993. More than Twelve million individuals above the age of Twelve have tried meth, including 1 out of 10 adolescents (according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention).<br />What is Methamphetamine?<br />Meth is a highly addictive stimulant that instantly has an effect on the pleasure centers within the brain. With recurrent use of methamphetamine, it turns off the brain's capacity to produce dopamine which simply leaves the users of the drug unable to enjoy anything else except more meth.  Meth can be smoked, injected intravenously, snorted, as well as ingested orally. The drug alters mood differently, dependent on how it is utilized.<br />Methamphetamine is recognized to raise the user's heart rate, blood pressure, temperature, and respiratory rate, a loss of appetite, sleep, reaction time, and lung function.  Long term use of methamphetamine will result in a wide range of conditions such as &amp;quot;meth mouth&amp;quot;, depression, amphetamine psychosis, obsessive scratching, anorexia, unwanted social behavior, every sort of child neglect, neglect of hygiene and property, prenatal exposure, high risk sexual behavior associated with the spread of HIV as well as STD's, aggressive behavior, criminal tendencies, and death through the collapse of the cardiovascular system and/or bleeding of the brain, cardiac arrest or hypothermia. In addition, there are various side affects associated with overdose including death, brain damage, feelings of flesh crawling bugs connected with compulsive picking and infecting sores, muscle breakdown producing kidney failure, hallucinations, delusions, along with paranoia.  These unpleasant conditions linked to methamphetamine don't even include the many accidents and deaths that could occur throughout the cooking procedure as a result of fires, explosions, and getting into contact with extremely dangerous chemical substances typically while the user is high.<br />Forms of Meth<br />Methamphetamine is a central nervous system stimulant with a significant potential for abuse and dependence. A synthetic drug, Methamphetamine is similar chemically to amphetamine, however produces greater effects on the central nervous system. The drug's euphoric effects are very similar to, but last longer than those associated with cocaine. The drug usually comes in 3 forms:<br />Powder: a white, odorless, and bitter-tasting crystalline powder, readily soluble in water or alcohol. <br /> <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.houstoncriminallawyers.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.houstoncriminallawyers.com</a> <br />Crystal: Users smoke chunks of a particularly pure form of crystalline Methamphetamine known as &amp;quot;Ice&amp;quot;. <br /> <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.houstonlawyer.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.houstonlawyer.com</a> <br />Rock: Big chunks of the drug, generally found in yellow, usually are consumed by mouth.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.houstonlawyer.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.houstonlawyer.com</a> <br />Indications of Meth Addiction<br />Individuals can become hooked the very first time they take meth, and the dependency  is just about the most difficult to cure. Individuals that take meth can become aggressive and paranoid, and the drug can cause heart attacks and death.<br />Addicts are chronic methamphetamine users completely centered on preventing the &amp;quot;crash &amp;quot;, a period of low energy and serious depression occurring after the individual stops taking the drug. Throughout the crash, an individual frequently sleeps, even as much as several days at a time, leaving kids unsupervised.<br />Meth addiction is rapid, and so is the devastation within the user 's family and lifestyle. Drug tolerance to methamphetamine evolves quickly, and the user often continues his impairment by abusing other alcohol or drugs, a process known as &amp;quot;tweaking &amp;quot;, to ease the highly unpleasant feeling at the end of the binge. The tweaker is usually paranoid and experiences a period of delusions as well as hallucinations when violent reactions to otherwise innocent stimuli are typical. Often times, it is children who are in the way. <br />The horror of meth abuse just cannot be overstated. <br />Methamphetamine abuse consumes the quality of life and destroys people. In the group of photos below, the woman portrayed was 38 years old when she died. Extremely, she is actually still living in the last photograph. Each photograph represents about 11 months.<br /> <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.houstoncriminallawyers.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.houstoncriminallawyers.com</a> <br />History of Meth<br />Methamphetamine was initially synthesized in Germany in 1887, but not for the recreational use that we see currently. The drug was produced to help remedy various types of depression, weight control (obesity), narcolepsy, and alcoholism. In the Second World War, Meth was frequently used by Nazi soldiers.  Hitler's troops, pilots, and tank crews were given chocolate laced with Meth frequently. Following the war, through the 1970's, the drug was frequently used mainly for medicinal purposes and one could very well acquire a legal prescription for Methamphetamine. It was not until the 1980's that we began to see Methamphetamine being manufactured for recreational purposes. By the mid- 1980's we started to notice methamphetamine being produced illicitly in Texas, and since that time, the illicit production of meth has spread like wildfire. <br />Law Enforcement Challenges<br />The addictive aspect of methamphetamine produces numerous issues for law enforcement officials. Individuals typically become hooked after a single use of the drug and discover it extremely hard to subsequently cease using meth. Users, dealers and traffickers often target young teenagers to begin using methamphetamine.   The DEA has discovered evidence of this from the increase in availability of flavored methamphetamine. Flavors including strawberry or &amp;quot;strawberry quick,&amp;quot; cola, and chocolate flavored methamphetamine have been found by authorities in California, Nevada, Washington, Idaho, Texas, New Mexico, Missouri, and Minnesota. <br />Safety is also an enormous impediment for the police when they happen to find a clandestine meth laboratory. It is a typical practice for small meth lab operators to surround their laboratories with booby traps, designed to seriously harm intruders. Several of these booby traps consist of rigged shot firearms behind doors and appliances, traps that release harmful fumes, as well as dangerous snakes. <br />People who violate the law by making, possessing, or distributing methamphetamine frequently break the law in various other ways also - due to or in support of their methamphetamine habit. Several law enforcement agencies will point to a connection between meth manufacturers and methamphetamine addicts and crimes including: murder, domestic abuse, illegal possession of firearms, theft and identity theft.<br />Methamphetamine Defense: Hire the Finest Houston Criminal Lawyers<br />Whatever illegal drug charges you are defending, it is very important for you to hire The Recommended Houston Criminal Defense Attorneys who will fight to prevent the serious penalties that are the result of a drug-related conviction.

Various states deal with the issue of illegal drugs in various ways, while the federal government has a tendency to have the most stringent drug sentencing regulations. However drug possession defenses are rather standard across state lines. A few defenses challenge the stated basic facts, testimony or evidence within the case, whilst others focus on procedural mistakes , frequently search and seizure infractions.<br />The following are several defenses to drug possession criminal charges, several much more typical than others:<br />Illegal Search and Seizure<br />The 4th Amendment of the United States Constitution guarantees the privilege to due process of law, such as legal search and seizure methods leading up to a charge. Search and seizure challenges are very typical in drug possession cases. Illegal drugs discovered in &amp;quot;plain view,&amp;quot; including a auto's dash panel following a legal traffic stop, might be seized and utilized as evidence. Nevertheless illegal drugs discovered within the trunk of a vehicle after prying it open with a crowbar, presuming the suspect didn't provide authorization, can't be put into evidence. In the event the accused's 4th Amendment rights had been breached, then the illegal drugs can't be utilized at trial and the criminal charges usually are dismissed.<br />Illegal Drugs Belong to Another Individual<br />A typical defense to any type of criminal offense arrest would be to merely proclaim that you did not do it. The drug possession equivalent would be to assert that the illegal drugs are not yours or that you simply had no idea they had been inside your apartment, for instance. The Top Houston Criminal Defense Lawyer will compel prosecutors to establish that the marijuana cigarette discovered within the automobile really belonged to their client rather than another individual within the automobile.<br />Crime Lab Assessment<br />Merely because it appears to be crack or Heroin does not necessarily mean that it is. The prosecution needs to establish that a seized material is actually the illegal drug it claims it is by submitting the evidence for crime lab analysis. The crime lab analyst then needs to testify at trial in order for the prosecution to prove its case.<br />Missing Illegal Drugs<br />The Finest Houston Criminal Defense Attorney will make certain prosecutors have the ability to provide the actual illegal drugs for which their client has been arrested. Comparable to the requirement for analysis by a crime lab, prosecutors who misplace or otherwise don't have the actual drugs risk getting their case dismissed. Seized drugs frequently are transferred a number of times prior to ending up within the evidence locker, therefore it should by no means be presumed that the evidence continues to exists throughout the trial.<br />Illegal Drugs Had Been Planted<br />This might be challenging to establish, because a law enforcement officer's sworn testimony carries a great deal of weight within the courtroom. Moreover, other police officers might hesitate to blow the whistle on a fellow police officer. Nevertheless, The Recommended Houston Criminal Defense Attorney might file a motion that, if authorized by the judge, demands the department to produce the complaint file of the given police officer. This file references the names and contact details of those that produced the complaints, who might then be interviewed by the lawyer or his private detective.<br />Entrapment<br />While authorities are free to operate sting operations, entrapment happens when police officers or informants cause a suspect to commit a criminal offense this individual otherwise might not have committed. If the informant pressures a suspect into giving illegal drugs to a 3rd party, for instance, then this might be regarded as entrapment. Typically, entrapment happens when the state offers the illegal drugs involved.<br />Do I Need A Criminal Attorney?<br />If you're arrested for any type of of these or some other drug related criminal offense you should get in touch with The Finest Houston Criminal Attorney as soon as you possibly can.   The consequences of carrying out a drug offense may be very harsh, such as actual jail time, in some cases for several years in significant high profile drug cases. Being found guilty for a drug-related crime could not just harm your personal and professional stature, but may lead to actual termination from a good job or even the suspension or revocation of one's professional licenses. It is not whether or not you'll acquire an experienced lawyer, rather, it is who you'll find to handle your case at your most susceptible time.<br />Do not let drug charges spoil your future.

A stop  isn't really as formal as a charge. A law enforcement officer will stop you to make inquiries. They cannot stop you unless they have a reasonable belief that you violated what the law states. What is defined as a valid &amp;ldquo;reasonable suspicion&amp;rdquo;? There are a million court cases answering that question and Houston Criminal Lawyers are going to be capable of giving you a great many examples during your<strong> no charge consultation</strong>.&lt;/p&gt; <br />            &lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, understand that an individual always has the right to remain silent, even if you are merely stopped and questioned. You do&amp;nbsp;<strong>not</strong>&amp;nbsp;have to respond to questions from the authorities at any time. The truth is, everyone ought to realize their constitutional rights relating to criminal law. &lt;/p&gt; <br />            &lt;p&gt;If you are in an automobile, the law enforcement officer may possibly ask to search it. Law enforcement cannot search your automobile unless they have &amp;ldquo;probable cause&amp;rdquo;, or if you consent. Some may seek your consent mainly because they do not quite have &amp;ldquo;probable cause.&amp;rdquo; You do not have to provide your consent to a search of your vehicle. They can search your automobile later, nevertheless your attorney will be able to then challenge the probable cause the authorities asserted as being a reason to search the vehicle. Should you give your consent, law enforcement do not need any other reason to search your automobile, and your attorney will have substantially less to challenge in the courtroom.&lt;/p&gt; <br />            &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Probable cause&amp;rdquo; is more serious than &amp;ldquo;reasonable suspicion&amp;rdquo;, nevertheless there are a million court cases explaining it too and the Attorneys In Houston will clarify those during your consultation. You cannot challenge a law enforcement officer's assertion of probable cause until afterwards, in the courtroom. Once again, let your attorney deal with that question later.&lt;/p&gt; <br />            &lt;p&gt;Frequently, a law enforcement officer will be able to charge you should they have probable cause to believe you committed a criminal offense, or if there is a warrant out for your arrest. If the stop and search bring about an arrest, you ought to in no way resist it. If it isn't  valid, you may wish to do so, nevertheless you cannot legally challenge it until later. Resisting arrest can be a criminal offense  on its own. <strong>The most desirable advice in the event you are arrested is to always be calm, always be silent, and demand an attorney before they ask you any type of questions</strong>. &lt;/p&gt; <br />            &lt;h2&gt;Booking[/b]&lt;/h2&gt; <br />            &lt;p&gt;After being arrested, the police officer will &amp;ldquo;book&amp;rdquo; you. This is the process where they take your fingerprints, get your mug shot, do a background check, and ask you questions. <strong>Remember, you have the right to remain silent and the right to demand a lawyer. You do in no way need to respond to questions. They aren't going to let you out of jail even in the event you respond to virtually all their questions. Just always be calm, always be silent, and let your attorney deal with things later. That's the very best you might do.</strong>&lt;/p&gt; <br />            &lt;h2&gt;Charging&lt;/h2&gt; <br />            &lt;p&gt;The charge originates from the prosecutor, definitely not the authorities. The victim doesn't  get to charge you, and <strong>contrary to popular belief, they don&amp;rsquo;t get to drop the criminal charges either</strong>. The prosecutor will quite often take into consideration the wishes of the victim, nevertheless they do not have to. You are within the hands of the state subsequent to being arrested. They can't hold you forever, however. You must be arrested for a criminal offense within a specific limited amount of time or they have to release you.&lt;/p&gt; <br />            &lt;h2&gt;Arraignment&lt;/h2&gt; <br />            &lt;p&gt;This is where the Judge or Magistrate will formally read your criminal charges and let you know your legal rights. You should have asserted your priviledge to an attorney before now. If not, do so now. In the event you are asked how to plea, and you do not have a Houston criminal defense attorney, it is best to  say &amp;ldquo;not guilty.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; <br />            &lt;p&gt;The Magistrate will decide whether or not you ought to be released, and if so, how much your bail ought to be. Bail is the amount of cash you, or another person else, needs to post with the court so they can be sure you will reappear. In the event you do not, your bond is going to be forfeited, and the county retains it.&lt;/p&gt; <br />            &lt;p&gt;If bail is set, another person has to post it for you or hire a bail bondsman to accomplish this. In the event you hire a bail bondsman, and you run off, the bondsman loses the bail money to the court. In the event that occurs, they send another person after you &amp;ndash; a bounty hunter. Additionally, there will undoubtedly be a warrant out for your arrest. In some instances you might be released on your own &amp;ldquo;recognizance&amp;rdquo;, which simply means there is absolutely no bail. Nevertheless you are currently in the system and definitely will be required to appear for additional proceedings.&lt;/p&gt; <br />            &lt;h2&gt;Discovery&lt;/h2&gt; <br />            &lt;p&gt;Discovery is known as a pre-trial process where the prosecutor needs to give certain details to your <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2dvcmRvbmpyaW5jYW4zLmxpdmVqb3VybmFsLmNvbS8xNjk1Lmh0bWw_" target="_blank">Houston Criminal Defense Attorneys</a>. Your Houston Criminal Lawyers get to see all of the evidence against you some time before trial. There won't be any secret, last minute witnesses permitted.&lt;/p&gt; <br />            &lt;h2&gt;Pre-Trial Motions&lt;/h2&gt; <br />            &lt;p&gt;This is the right reason to remain silent, not provide your consent to a search, and demand an experienced criminal defense lawyer in the event you are arrested. Your Houston Attorneys may prepare any number of pre-trial motions. They commonly ask the Court to exclude certain evidence from trial if it was obtained in an unlawful or impermissible fashion. It is challenging to suppress evidence if you spoke voluntarily or had given consent to a search.            &lt;/p&gt; <br />            &lt;h2&gt;Plea Bargaining&lt;/h2&gt; <br />            &lt;p&gt;This is known as a fancy word for negotiations.  If the two sides reach an agreement, you will commonly need to plead guilty to one or more of the criminal charges to acquire the deal that has been reached. This involves going to court, responding to several questions from the Judge, and indicating to the court on the record that you are guilty to the charge agreed upon by your Houston Attorneys and the prosecutor.&lt;/p&gt; <br />            &lt;h2&gt;Trial&lt;/h2&gt; <br />            &lt;p&gt;If the prosecutor and your Houston Lawyers could not arrive at an agreement on a plea bargain, you will commonly go to trial. Trial is where the government needs to put on evidence that you committed a transgression, ordinarily including producing witnesses live in the courtroom to testify. You do not need to testify. You do not need to put on any sort of evidence whatsoever. The government has to establish its case, and it needs to establish it beyond a reasonable doubt.&lt;/p&gt; <br />            &lt;h2&gt;Sentencing&lt;/h2&gt; <br />            &lt;p&gt;If you are found guilty, or in the event you enter a plea of guilty primarily based on a plea bargain, you will likely be sentenced by the Court. The Judge will make a decision on the appropriate punishment. This may end up being anything from probation to active prison time. There are guidelines that apply and allow the Judge a general range of punishment choices.&lt;/p&gt; <br />            &lt;p&gt;Skilled Attorneys Houston can certainly do a lot on your behalf at sentencing, such as ensuring that all the procedures are followed, arguing for lesser guidelines, and arguing circumstances that would allow the Judge to sentence you to lower than that called for within the guidelines. Also, an experienced criminal defense lawyer is able to help you prior to sentencing by informing you what steps you might take to make the Judge more likely to be lenient on you. For example, in the event you are arrested for drunk driving, and take a class or go to rehab, the Judge <strong>might</strong> take that into consideration when sentencing you.&lt;/p&gt; <br />            &lt;h2&gt;Aggressive Lawyers Houston&lt;/h2&gt; <br />            &lt;p&gt;I have attempted to provide you with a useful overview of the criminal process, with a few great tips on how best to deal with important things at every stage.

No<br/><br/>&lt;p&gt;<strong>Theft/larceny</strong> is typically defined as the taking of nearly anything at all of value without the consent of the owner, with the intent to permanently deprive him or her of the value of the asset taken. Most states acknowledge degrees of theft, like &quot;grand&quot; or &quot;petty,&quot; which generally relate to the value of the property taken.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;<strong>Burglary</strong> is typically defined as the unlawful entry into almost any structure (not just a house or business) with the intent to commit any crime inside (not just theft/larceny). No physical breaking and entering is needed; the offender may simply trespass through an open door. In contrast to robbery, which entails use of force or fear to obtain another person's property, there is usually no victim present throughout a burglary. &lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;Many states define <strong>robbery</strong> as theft/larceny of property or cash via the offender's use of physical force or fear against a victim. Where a deadly weapon like a gun is utilized or the victim suffers injury, the robbery might be charged as &quot;armed&quot; or &quot;aggravated.&quot; In contrast to burglary, the crime of robbery nearly always requires the presence of a victim who suffers actual injury, or is threatened with injury.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;h2&gt;Houston Theft, Burglary &amp;amp; Robbery Defense: Hire the Most Effective Lawyer Houston TX!&lt;/h2&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;There are few crimes that look worse on an employment application than theft.

Now What?</a> as you determine how to fight the charges.  Although the specific meaning of Assault varies by jurisdiction, it is commonly viewed as the act of putting another person in fear of harm or offensive contact by the use of force or the threat of force. Some jurisdictions also consider an intentional injury to be an &lt;i&gt;Assault&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What Exactly Is Assault?&lt;/h2&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;Assault is an attempt to hurt someone physically; it is also the threat of force or use of force, making the victim apprehensive of harmful or offensive contact. If the &lt;b&gt;Assault&lt;/b&gt; takes place while the defendant is utilizing a deadly weapon or attempting to commit a serious crime, it is an aggravated Assault. As this is a more serious crime than simple <strong>Assault</strong>, the punishment is usually more severe. Battery, alternatively, is commonly defined as the actual touching of the victim in a harmful or offensive manner. &lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt; Some jurisdictions define &lt;b&gt;Assault&lt;/b&gt; and battery differently than others; the Leading Houston Lawyers can assist you with the precise definitions and associated defenses. Remember: Injury does not necessarily have to take place for the crime to be aggravated Assault.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;h2&gt;Is <strong>Assault</strong> a Misdemeanor or a Felony?&lt;/h2&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;Assault can be charged and prosecuted as either a misdemeanor or a &lt;b&gt;felony&lt;/b&gt;. Both misdemeanor and felony charges &lt;b&gt; ought to be taken seriously&lt;/b&gt;, as both could have long-term consequences. The prosecutor in the case will ultimately decide how to charge the defendant. It depends on the circumstances of the alleged crime and the specific laws of jurisdiction in which the event occurred. &lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;h2&gt;What Are Possible Defenses to <strong>Assault</strong> Charges?&lt;/h2&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;The defense of property may be a viable defense to a charge of Assault. In other cases, the alleged &lt;i&gt;Assault&lt;/i&gt; may have been unintentional, or perhaps the accuser may have misinterpreted the defendant's actions. &lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;This also may apply when the person was defending another individual against the danger of physical harm. &lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;If a reasonable person would have felt it necessary to use force to avoid a danger of being hurt, and reasonable force was used, then there may be a plausible self-defense argument. Finally, mitigating circumstances may help reduce the defendant's responsibility as well.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;h1&gt;Hire the Best Houston Lawyers! &lt;/h1&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;If you or your loved one has been arrested for Assault, it is important to speak with legal counsel who understands the law and procedure of your jurisdiction.

Both Cocaine and Crack Cocaine are powerful and particularly addictive drugs. Cocaine is primarily harvested in Columbia, Peru and Bolivia South America and it is classified as a Schedule II drug, meaning it has an exceedingly high potential for misuse and addiction. There are 2 principal varieties of Cocaine. One is a powdery type. It's used for snorting up the nasal area. Second is freebase, also known as Crack Cocaine, utilized for smoking. A smaller percentage of Cocaine addiction is carried out intravenously. When Cocaine is snorted, the Cocaine powder is inhaled  into the nose where it's immediately absorbed into the bloodstream. As soon as Cocaine reaches the brain, dopamine gets released, stirring pleasant feelings. Because it is known as a stimulant, Cocaine has always been a popular social gathering drug. Cocaine is easily traded on the streets because it's sold in compact packets. &lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;h2&gt;What is Crack Cocaine? &lt;/h2&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;Crack Cocaine, recognized as Crack, is a term for the smokable form of Cocaine. Crack is the street name given to the form of Cocaine that has been prepared into a smokable substance. Smoking Crack Cocaine delivers significant amounts of the substance into the lungs, creating an immediate and intense euphoric feeling. The rush, or high, is typically very intense, yet  doesn't necessarily last for a long time. The rocks of Crack Cocaine are ignited in a Crack pipe and the  vapors get deeply inhaled. Crack Cocaine has emerged as a major drug of abuse in the previous twenty to twenty-five years. The term Crack refers to the popping sound heard when it's heated. &lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;h2&gt;Hire The  Finest Houston Lawyers &lt;/h2&gt;<br />&lt;h2&gt;What are the Effects of Cocaine Abuse? &lt;/h2&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;Cocaine addiction or Crack Cocaine addiction is ordinarily identified with a person who's compulsively looking for and using Cocaine or Crack Cocaine, in spite of the negative consequences. The physical signs of Cocaine abuse can differ, dependent upon the person. For one, Cocaine acts as an appetite suppressant so Cocaine abusers often aren't hungry and end up losing substantial amounts of weight. Cocaine addicts often go on binges, in some instances for a number of days. The road to Cocaine addiction can start with occasional use at parties. Over time, a person's capability to choose not to take the drug gradually erodes. Cocaine or Crack Cocaine addiction becomes compulsive and addictive because of the ensuing enjoyable feelings. &lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;The consequences of Cocaine use consist of heart attacks, respiratory failure, strokes, and seizures. Large amounts can cause bizarre and violent behavior. In exceptional instances, sudden death can occur on the initial use of Cocaine or unexpectedly thereafter. The short-term physiological consequences of Cocaine consist of constricted blood vessels; dilated pupils; and elevated temperature, heart rate, and blood pressure. Large amounts (several hundred milligrams or more) intensify the user's high, yet could possibly also result in bizarre, erratic, and violent behavior. These users may very well experience tremors, vertigo, muscle twitches, paranoia, or, with repeated doses, a toxic reaction closely resembling amphetamine poisoning. Some users of Cocaine report feelings of restlessness, irritability, and anxiety. Cocaine-related deaths are quite often a result of cardiac arrest or seizures followed by respiratory arrest. Use of Cocaine in a binge, during which the drug is taken repeatedly and at increasingly higher doses, leads to a state of growing irritability, restlessness, and paranoia. This may possibly result in a full-blown paranoid psychosis, in which the person loses touch with reality and experiences auditory hallucinations. &lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;h2&gt;Street Names&lt;/h2&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;Cocaine goes by the street names of coke, snow, flake, blow and many others. Cocaine slang words are in no short supply, no matter where you go. Considering the fact that law enforcement officials agencies work as hard as they do to stop the sale and distribution of Cocaine, users and dealers have incorporated tag words to identify the drug or the use of the drug  without having  having to mention it by name.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;h2&gt;Penalties &lt;/h2&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;Being arrested for Cocaine offenses are incredibly severe in Texas and carry federal and state required minimum sentences, in many instances. There's been a great deal of debate surrounding this law, that makes it much more serious to be convicted of criminal charges related to Crack Cocaine than standard Cocaine. The controversy lies within the reality that both illegal drugs contain the exact same active component and many say the disparity in sentencing is not fair. &lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;Twenty-five years ago Congress enacted significant mandatory minimum sentences, condemning thousands of mainly low-level, generally nonviolent drug offenders to years, in some instances decades in jail. In part because of these and other &amp;quot;sentencing guideline&amp;quot; penalties, the U.S. now suffers from an incarceration rate unprecedented in our country's history or any other.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;Although Congress voted last year to substantially decrease -- but not eliminate -- the sentencing disparities between Crack and powder Cocaine, Crack still earns you significantly more time than powder. And this ruling clarifies that those stronger penalties apply to freebase and coca paste, as well as Crack. &lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;In the majority of places, prosecutors don't file charges for a modest amount of Cocaine, but not in Houston. Every narcotics possession, even a tiny amount of Cocaine, can mean a charge and conviction - and that means a criminal background. Mainly because it's classified as a narcotic drug under Texas law, the criminal charges filed by the prosecution in a Crack Cocaine or Cocaine base criminal offense may very well include possession of a narcotic drug, sale of a narcotic drug, transportation of a narcotic drug and possession for sale of a narcotic drug. &lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;h2&gt;Defense for a Cocaine Charge&lt;/h2&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;The sooner you speak to The Best <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy50aG91Z2h0cy5jb20vam9uYXRoYW5jb2hlNDEwLy1ob3VzdG9uLXNleC1jcmltZXMtYXR0b3JuZXktYXJyZXN0ZWQtZm9yLWEtc2V4LW9mZmVuc2UtZGlzY292ZXItcmVjb21tZW5kYXRpb25zLW9uLWhvdy10by1iZWF0LWl0" target="_blank">Houston Attorneys</a>, the more opportunities there may well be to minimize the consequences.

Seek the counsel of an experienced attorney in Houston, Texas as you determine how to fight the charges.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;Being convicted of Assault could bring significant penalties including jail or prison time, fines and probation.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt; Although the specific meaning of &lt;i&gt;Assault&lt;/i&gt; may differ by jurisdiction, it is usually viewed as the act of putting another individual in fear of harm or offensive contact by the use of force or the threat of force. Some jurisdictions also consider an intentional injury to be an <strong>Assault</strong>.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What Is &lt;b&gt;Assault&lt;/b&gt;?&lt;/h2&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;Assault is an attempt to injure someone physically; it is also the threat of force or use of force, making the victim apprehensive of harmful or offensive contact. If the <strong>Assault</strong> occurs while the defendant is using a deadly weapon or attempting to commit a serious crime, it is an aggravated Assault. Because this is a far more serious crime than simple <strong>Assault</strong>, the punishment is generally more severe. Battery, alternatively, is typically defined as the actual touching of the victim in a harmful or offensive manner. &lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt; Some jurisdictions define Assault and battery differently than others; the Most Qualified Lawyer In Houston TX will help you with the specific definitions and associated defenses. Remember: Injury does not necessarily need to take place for the crime to be aggravated &lt;i&gt;Assault&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;h2&gt;Is &lt;i&gt;Assault&lt;/i&gt; a Misdemeanor or a Felony?&lt;/h2&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;Assault can be charged and prosecuted as either a &lt;b&gt;misdemeanor&lt;/b&gt; or even a &lt;i&gt;felony&lt;/i&gt;. Both misdemeanor and felony charges &lt;b&gt; should be taken seriously&lt;/b&gt;, as both may have long-term consequences. The prosecutor in the case will ultimately decide how to charge the defendant. It depends on the circumstances of the alleged crime and the specific laws of jurisdiction where the event occurred. &lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;h2&gt;What Are Possible Defenses to <strong>Assault</strong> Charges?&lt;/h2&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;The defense of property can be a viable defense to a charge of <strong>Assault</strong>. In other cases, the alleged Assault might have been unintentional, or perhaps the accuser could have misinterpreted the defendant's actions. This also may apply when the person was defending someone else against the real danger of physical harm. If a reasonable person would have felt it necessary to use force to avoid a danger of being injured, and reasonable force was used, then there may be a plausible self-defense argument. Lastly, mitigating circumstances may help lessen the defendant's responsibility as well.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;h1&gt;Hire the Most Respected Lawyer Houston TX! &lt;/h1&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;If you or your loved one has been charged with <strong>Assault</strong>, it is important to speak with a legal professional who understands the law and procedure of your jurisdiction. Conviction for <strong>Assault</strong> can lead to imprisonment, fines, probation or parole, the inability to hold certain jobs and the loss of the right to possess a firearm.

A stop isn't  as formal as a charge. A law enforcement officer will stop you to make inquiries. They cannot stop you unless they have a reasonable belief that you violated the law. What is known as a valid &amp;ldquo;reasonable suspicion&amp;rdquo;? There are a million cases answering that question and a Lawyer Houston TX is going to be capable of giving you a great many examples during your<strong> complimentary consultation</strong>.&lt;/p&gt; <br />            &lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, understand that an individual always has the right to remain silent, even if you are simply stopped and questioned. You do&amp;nbsp;<strong>not</strong>&amp;nbsp;have to respond to any questions from the police at any time. The truth is, everyone ought to know their constitutional rights relating to criminal law. &lt;/p&gt; <br />            &lt;p&gt;If you are in a vehicle, the law enforcement officer may possibly ask to search it. The authorities cannot search your vehicle unless they have &amp;ldquo;probable cause&amp;rdquo;, or if you consent. Some may seek your consent mainly because they do not quite have &amp;ldquo;probable cause.&amp;rdquo; You do not have to provide your consent to a search of your vehicle. They may search your automobile later, nevertheless your lawyer can then challenge the probable cause the police asserted as being a reason to search the automobile. In the event you give your consent, the police do not need any other reason to search your car, and your attorney will have substantially less to challenge in court.&lt;/p&gt; <br />            &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Probable cause&amp;rdquo; is more serious than &amp;ldquo;reasonable suspicion&amp;rdquo;, but there are a million court cases explaining it too and a Lawyer Houston TX will explain those during your consultation. You cannot challenge a police officer's assertion of probable cause until later, in the courtroom. Once again, let your attorney deal with that question later.&lt;/p&gt; <br />            &lt;p&gt;Frequently, a law enforcement officer might charge you if they have probable cause to believe you committed a criminal offense, or if there is a warrant out for your arrest. If the stop and search bring about an arrest, you must in no way resist it. If it  is not really  valid, you will want to do so, however you cannot legally challenge it until later. Resisting arrest is a crime  on its own. <strong>The optimum advice if you are arrested is to always be calm, always be silent, and demand an attorney before they ask you any questions</strong>. &lt;/p&gt; <br />            &lt;h2&gt;Booking[/b]&lt;/h2&gt; <br />            &lt;p&gt;After being arrested, the police officer will &amp;ldquo;book&amp;rdquo; you. This is the process where they take your fingerprints, get your mug shot, do a background check, and ask you questions. <strong>Remember, you have the right to remain silent and the right to demand a lawyer. You do in no way need to answer questions. They are not going to let you out of jail even should you answer all their questions. Just be calm, be silent, and let your attorney deal with things later. That is the very best you might do.</strong>&lt;/p&gt; <br />            &lt;h2&gt;Charging&lt;/h2&gt; <br />            &lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt; <br />              The charge originates from the prosecutor, not police officers. The victim doesn't  get to charge you, and <strong>contrary to popular belief, they don&amp;rsquo;t get to drop the charges either</strong>. The prosecutor will often take into account the wishes of the victim, but they do not have to. You are within the hands of the state subsequent to being arrested. They can't hold you indefinitely, however. You must be charged with a criminal offense within a specific limited amount of time or they have to release you.&lt;/p&gt; <br />            &lt;h2&gt;Arraignment&lt;/h2&gt; <br />            &lt;p&gt;This is where the Judge or Magistrate will formally read your charges and tell you your rights. You should have asserted your right to an attorney before now. If not, do so now. In the event you are asked how to plea, and you do not have a Houston attorney, you should  say &amp;ldquo;not guilty.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; <br />            &lt;p&gt;The Magistrate will decide on whether or not you should be released, and if so, how much your bail should be. Bail is the amount of cash you, or another person else, has to post with the court so they can be sure you will reappear. If you do not, your bond is going to be forfeited, and the county retains it.&lt;/p&gt; <br />            &lt;p&gt;If bail is set, another person must post it for you or hire a bail bondsman to do so. In the event you hire a bail bondsman, and you run off, the bondsman loses the bail money to the court. If that occurs, they send another person after you &amp;ndash; a bounty hunter. Plus, there will be a warrant out for your arrest. In some instances you will be released on your own &amp;ldquo;recognizance&amp;rdquo;, which just means there is absolutely no bail. But you are now in the system and will have to appear for additional proceedings.&lt;/p&gt; <br />            &lt;h2&gt;Discovery&lt;/h2&gt; <br />            &lt;p&gt;Discovery is known as a pre-trial process where the prosecutor must give certain details to your Lawyer Houston TX. Your Houston Lawyer gets to see all of the evidence against you well before trial. There won't be any secret, last minute witnesses permitted.&lt;/p&gt; <br />            &lt;h2&gt;Pre-Trial Motions&lt;/h2&gt; <br />            &lt;p&gt;This is the preferred reason to remain silent, not give your consent to a search, and demand an attorney in the event you are arrested. Your Houston TX Lawyer can certainly prepare any number of pre-trial motions. They generally ask the Court to exclude certain evidence from trial if it was acquired in an unlawful or impermissible fashion. It is challenging to suppress evidence if you spoke voluntarily or had given consent to a search.            &lt;/p&gt; <br />            &lt;h2&gt;Plea Bargaining&lt;/h2&gt; <br />            &lt;p&gt;This is a fancy word for negotiations.  If the two sides reach an agreement, you will often need to plead guilty to one or more of the criminal charges to get the deal that has been reached. This involves going to court, answering several questions from the Judge, and telling the court on the record that you are guilty to the charge agreed upon by your Lawyer In Houston TX and the prosecutor.&lt;/p&gt; <br />            &lt;h2&gt;Trial&lt;/h2&gt; <br />            &lt;p&gt;If the prosecutor and your Lawyer Houston TX could not arrive at an agreement on a plea bargain, you will generally go to trial. Trial is where the government needs to put on evidence that you committed a criminal offense, normally including producing witnesses live in court to testify. You do not have to testify. You do not have to put on any evidence whatsoever. The government has to establish its case, and it has to prove it beyond a reasonable doubt.&lt;/p&gt; <br />            &lt;h2&gt;Sentencing&lt;/h2&gt; <br />            &lt;p&gt;If you are found guilty, or should you enter a plea of guilty based on a plea bargain, you will probably be sentenced by the Court. The Judge will make a decision on the proper punishment. This might end up being anything from probation to active jail time. There are guidelines that apply and give the Judge a general range of punishment alternatives.&lt;/p&gt; <br />            &lt;p&gt;An experienced Houston Criminal Lawyer will be able to do a lot on your behalf at sentencing, including making sure that all the procedures are followed, arguing for lesser guidelines, and arguing circumstances which would allow the Judge to sentence you to lower than that called for in the guidelines. Also, a criminal defense lawyer is able to help you before sentencing by telling you what measures you can take to make the Judge more likely to be lenient on you. For instance, in the event you are charged with drunk driving, and take a class or go to rehab, the Judge <strong>may</strong> take that into consideration when sentencing you.&lt;/p&gt; <br />            &lt;h2&gt;Aggressive Houston TX Lawyer&lt;/h2&gt; <br />            &lt;p&gt;I have attempted to offer you a good overview of the criminal process, with some great tips on how best to deal with matters at every stage.

A stop  is not really  as formal as an arrest. A police officer will stop you to ask questions. They cannot stop you unless they have a reasonable belief you violated the law. What is known as a valid &amp;ldquo;reasonable suspicion&amp;rdquo;? There are a million court cases answering that question and a Lawyer Houston TX will be capable of giving you a great many examples during your<strong> no charge consultation</strong>.&lt;/p&gt; <br />            &lt;p&gt;However, keep in mind that you always have the right to remain silent, even if you are just stopped and questioned. You do&amp;nbsp;<strong>not</strong>&amp;nbsp;have to respond to questions from police officers at any time. In reality, everyone should know their constitutional rights relating to criminal law. &lt;/p&gt; <br />            &lt;p&gt;If you are in a vehicle, the police officer could possibly ask to search it. Law enforcement cannot search your vehicle unless they have &amp;ldquo;probable cause&amp;rdquo;, or you consent. Some might seek your consent due to the fact that they do not quite have &amp;ldquo;probable cause.&amp;rdquo; You do not have to give your consent to a search of your vehicle. Some might search your car later, nevertheless your lawyer will be able to then challenge the probable cause the police asserted as being a reason to search the car. If you give your consent, the police do not need any other reason to search your vehicle, and your lawyer will have substantially less to challenge in court.&lt;/p&gt; <br />            &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Probable cause&amp;rdquo; is more serious than &amp;ldquo;reasonable suspicion&amp;rdquo;, however there are a million court cases explaining it too and a Lawyer In Houston TX will give an explanation of those during your consultation. You cannot challenge a police officer's assertion of probable cause until later on, in the courtroom. Once again, let your attorney handle that question later.&lt;/p&gt; <br />            &lt;p&gt;Generally, a law enforcement officer will be able to arrest you if they have probable cause to believe you committed a criminal offense, or if there is a warrant out for your arrest. If a stop and search bring about an arrest, you ought to not resist it. If it isn't  valid, you will want to do so, however you cannot legally challenge it until later. Resisting arrest is a crime by itself . <strong>The recommended advice if you are arrested is to be calm, always be silent, and demand a lawyer before they ask you any sort of questions</strong>. &lt;/p&gt; <br />            &lt;h2&gt;Booking[/b]&lt;/h2&gt; <br />            &lt;p&gt;After being arrested, the officer will &amp;ldquo;book&amp;rdquo; you. This is the process where they take your fingerprints, get your mug shot, do a background check, and ask you questions. <strong>Remember, you have the right to remain silent and the right to demand a lawyer. You do not need to respond to questions. They are not going to let you out of jail even if you respond to all their questions. Just be calm, always be silent, and let your attorney deal with things later. That's the best you can do.</strong>&lt;/p&gt; <br />            &lt;h2&gt;Charging&lt;/h2&gt; <br />            &lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt; <br />              The charge comes from the prosecutor, in no way police officers. The victim does not get to charge you, and <strong>contrary to popular belief, they don&amp;rsquo;t get to drop the criminal charges either</strong>. The prosecutor will quite often take into consideration the wishes of the victim, but they do not have to. You are in the hands of the state subsequent to being arrested. They cannot hold you indefinitely, however. You must be charged with a criminal offense within a specific limited amount of time or they have got to release you.&lt;/p&gt; <br />            &lt;h2&gt;Arraignment&lt;/h2&gt; <br />            &lt;p&gt;This is where the Judge or Magistrate will formally read your criminal charges and let you know your legal rights. You should have asserted your priviledge to a lawyer before now. If not, do so right now. If you are asked how to plea, and you do not have a Houston criminal defense lawyer, it is best to  say &amp;ldquo;not guilty.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; <br />            &lt;p&gt;The Magistrate will decide on whether or not you ought to be released, and if so, how much your bail should be. Bail is the amount of cash you, or someone else, needs to post with the court so they can be sure you will reappear. In the event you do not, your bond will be forfeited, and the county gets it.&lt;/p&gt; <br />            &lt;p&gt;If bail is set, someone needs to post it for you or hire a bail bondsman to do this. Should you hire a bail bondsman, and you run off, the bondsman loses the bail money to the court. In the event that occurs, they send someone after you &amp;ndash; a bounty hunter. Plus, there will undoubtedly be a warrant out for your arrest. Sometimes you might be released on your own &amp;ldquo;recognizance&amp;rdquo;, which just means there's no bail. However you are currently in the system and definitely will be required to appear for additional proceedings.&lt;/p&gt; <br />            &lt;h2&gt;Discovery&lt;/h2&gt; <br />            &lt;p&gt;Discovery is a pre-trial process where the prosecutor has to give certain information and facts to your Lawyer In Houston TX. Your Lawyer Houston TX gets to see all of the evidence against you some time before trial. There won't be any secret, last minute witnesses allowed.&lt;/p&gt; <br />            &lt;h2&gt;Pre-Trial Motions&lt;/h2&gt; <br />            &lt;p&gt;This is the recommended reason to remain silent, not provide your consent to a search, and demand an experienced criminal defense attorney if you are arrested. Your Lawyer In Houston TX can make any number of pre-trial motions. They often ask the Court to exclude certain evidence from trial if it was gained in an unlawful or impermissible manner. It is difficult to suppress evidence if you spoke voluntarily or had given consent to a search.            &lt;/p&gt; <br />            &lt;h2&gt;Plea Bargaining&lt;/h2&gt; <br />            &lt;p&gt;This is known as a fancy word for negotiations.  If the two sides reach an agreement, you will ordinarily need to plead guilty to one or more of the criminal charges to acquire the deal which has been reached. This involves going to court, responding to some questions from the Judge, and telling the court on the record that you are guilty to the charge agreed upon by your Houston Lawyer and the prosecutor.&lt;/p&gt; <br />            &lt;h2&gt;Trial&lt;/h2&gt; <br />            &lt;p&gt;If the prosecutor and your Houston TX Lawyer are unable to arrive at an agreement on a plea bargain, you will generally go to trial. Trial is where the government must put on evidence that you committed a criminal offense, often including producing witnesses live in court to testify. You do not have to testify. You do not have to put on any type of evidence whatsoever. The government must demonstrate its case, and it needs to prove it beyond a reasonable doubt.&lt;/p&gt; <br />            &lt;h2&gt;Sentencing&lt;/h2&gt; <br />            &lt;p&gt;If you are found guilty, or in the event you enter a plea of guilty primarily based on a plea bargain, you will undoubtedly be sentenced by the Court. The Judge will make a decision on the proper punishment. This might end up being anything from probation to active prison time. There are guidelines that apply and give the Judge a general range of punishment choices.&lt;/p&gt; <br />            &lt;p&gt;An skilled Houston Criminal Attorney is able to do a lot on your behalf at sentencing, this includes making sure that all the procedures are followed, arguing for lesser guidelines, and arguing circumstances that would allow the Judge to sentence you to less than that called for in the guidelines. Also, a criminal defense attorney is able to help you before sentencing by explaining to you what steps you can take to make the Judge more likely to be lenient on you. For example, in the event you are charged with drunk driving, and take a class or go to rehab, the Judge <strong>might</strong> take that into consideration when sentencing you.&lt;/p&gt; <br />            &lt;h2&gt;Aggressive Lawyer In Houston TX&lt;/h2&gt; <br />            &lt;p&gt;I have tried to offer you a good overview of the criminal process, with a few recommendations on how best to deal with matters at every stage. But I have to repeat my earliest and most important advice here: <strong>call  your Lawyer Houston TX anytime a criminal charge is made against you.

&lt;/li&gt;<br />  &lt;li&gt; Do not wear sunglasses unless you have a condition that's medically shown to hurt your eyes in light. &lt;/li&gt;<br />  &lt;li&gt; Remain in attendance until excused. All individuals seated before the bar shall stay there throughout every session and return right after recess. Parties and counsel ought to stay in attendance during jury deliberations; absence waives the right to attend the return of the judgment. &lt;/li&gt;<br />  &lt;li&gt; Dress with pride. &lt;/li&gt;<br />  &lt;li&gt; Address other individuals only by their titles and surnames, including lawyers, witnesses, and court personnel. &lt;/li&gt;<br />  &lt;li&gt; Steer clear of approaching the bench. Counsel should anticipate the need for rulings and examine them once the jury isn't seated. Whenever a bench conference is inevitable, obtain permission first. &lt;/li&gt;<br />  &lt;li&gt; Hand to the clerk, not the judge or reporter, all things for examination by the judge. &lt;/li&gt;<br />  &lt;li&gt; Stand when the judge or jury enters or leaves the courtroom. &lt;/li&gt;<br />  &lt;li&gt; Conduct no experiment or demonstration without permission. &lt;/li&gt;<br />  &lt;li&gt; Make no side-bar remarks. &lt;/li&gt;<br />  &lt;li&gt; Request the use of easels, light boxes, and other equipment far ahead of time so that they can be set up while the Court isn't in session. &lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;/ul&gt;<br /><br />&lt;p&gt;Following these basic simple rules and procedures, you greatly increase your chances of being successful in the courtroom.&amp;nbsp; These are unwritten guidelines, however over the years men and women appear to have forgotten them.

What To Do Now?</a> can decide which defenses might pertain to your case should you be arrested for possession of illegal drugs, either for individual use or with intent to sell, in the event you plead not guilty. Various states deal with the issue of unlawful drugs in various ways, while the federal government has a tendency to have the most stringent drug sentencing regulations. However drug possession defenses are rather standard across state lines. A few defenses challenge the stated basic facts, testimony or evidence within the case, whilst others focus on procedural mistakes , frequently search and seizure infractions.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;The following are several defenses to drug possession criminal charges, several much more typical than others:&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;<strong>Illegal Search and Seizure</strong>&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;The 4th Amendment of the United States Constitution guarantees the privilege to due process of law, such as legal search and seizure methods leading up to a charge. Search and seizure challenges are very typical in drug possession cases. Illegal drugs discovered in &amp;quot;plain view,&amp;quot; including a auto's dash panel following a legal traffic stop, might be seized and utilized as evidence. Nevertheless illegal drugs discovered within the trunk of a vehicle after prying it open with a crowbar, presuming the suspect didn't provide authorization, can't be put into evidence. In the event the accused's 4th Amendment rights had been breached, then the illegal drugs can't be utilized at trial and the criminal charges usually are dismissed.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;<strong>Illegal Drugs Belong to Another Individual</strong>&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;A typical defense to any type of criminal offense arrest would be to merely proclaim that you did not do it. The drug possession equivalent would be to assert that the illegal drugs are not yours or that you simply had no idea they had been inside your apartment, for instance. The Best Houston Criminal Attorney will compel prosecutors to establish that the marijuana cigarette discovered within the automobile really belonged to their client rather than another individual within the automobile.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;<strong>Crime Lab Assessment</strong>&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;Merely because it appears to be crack or Heroin does not necessarily mean that it is. The prosecution needs to establish that a seized material is actually the illegal drug it claims it is by submitting the evidence for crime lab analysis. The crime lab analyst then needs to testify at trial in order for the prosecution to prove its case.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;<strong>Missing Illegal Drugs</strong>&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;The Recommended Houston Criminal Attorney will make certain prosecutors have the ability to provide the actual illegal drugs for which their client has been arrested. Comparable to the requirement for analysis by a crime lab, prosecutors who misplace or otherwise don't have the actual drugs risk getting their case dismissed. Seized drugs frequently are transferred a number of times prior to ending up within the evidence locker, therefore it should by no means be presumed that the evidence continues to exists throughout the trial.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;<strong>Illegal Drugs Had Been Planted</strong>&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;This might be challenging to establish, because a law enforcement officer's sworn testimony carries a great deal of weight within the courtroom. Moreover, other police officers might hesitate to blow the whistle on a fellow police officer. Nevertheless, The Finest Houston Criminal Attorney may file a motion that, if authorized by the judge, demands the department to produce the complaint file of the given police officer. This file references the names and contact details of those that produced the complaints, who might then be interviewed by the lawyer or his private detective.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;<strong>Entrapment</strong>&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;While authorities are free to put together sting operations, entrapment happens when police officers or informants cause a suspect to commit a criminal offense this individual otherwise might not have committed. If the informant pressures a suspect into giving illegal drugs to a 3rd party, for instance, then this might be regarded as entrapment. Usually, entrapment happens when the state offers the illegal drugs involved.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;<strong>Do I Need A Criminal Attorney?</strong>&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;If you're arrested for any type of of these or some other drug related criminal offense you should get in touch with The Best Houston Criminal Defense Lawyer as soon as you possibly can.   The consequences of carrying out a drug offense may be very harsh, such as actual jail time, in some cases for several years in significant high profile drug cases.

It is not whether or not you'll acquire an experienced lawyer, rather, it is who you'll find to handle your case at your most susceptible time.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;Do not let drug charges spoil your future.

A stop  is not really  as formal as a charge. A law enforcement officer will stop you to make inquiries. They cannot stop you unless they have a reasonable belief that you violated what the law states. What is known as a valid &amp;ldquo;reasonable suspicion&amp;rdquo;? There are a million court cases answering that question and Houston Criminal Attorneys are going to be capable of giving you a great many examples during your<strong> no charge consultation</strong>.&lt;/p&gt; <br />            &lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, remember that an individual always has the right to remain silent, even if you are merely stopped and questioned. You do&amp;nbsp;<strong>not</strong>&amp;nbsp;have to respond to questions from law enforcement at any time. The truth is, everyone ought to realize their constitutional rights relating to criminal law. &lt;/p&gt; <br />            &lt;p&gt;If you are in an automobile, the law enforcement officer may perhaps ask to search it. Law enforcement cannot search your automobile unless they have &amp;ldquo;probable cause&amp;rdquo;, or if you consent. They can seek your consent mainly because they do not quite have &amp;ldquo;probable cause.&amp;rdquo; You do not have to provide your consent to a search of your automobile. Some might search your vehicle later, however your attorney will be able to then challenge the probable cause law enforcement asserted as being a reason to search the vehicle. In the event you give your consent, the authorities do not need any other reason to search your automobile, and your attorney will have significantly less to challenge in the courtroom.&lt;/p&gt; <br />            &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Probable cause&amp;rdquo; is more serious than &amp;ldquo;reasonable suspicion&amp;rdquo;, however there are a million court cases explaining it too and the Houston Attorneys will give an explanation of those during your consultation. You cannot challenge a law enforcement officer's assertion of probable cause until afterwards, in the courtroom. Once again, let your attorney deal with that question later.&lt;/p&gt; <br />            &lt;p&gt;Typically, a law enforcement officer is able to charge you should they have probable cause to believe you committed a criminal offense, or if there is a warrant out for your arrest. If the stop and search bring about an arrest, you ought to in no way resist it. If it  is not really  valid, you may wish to do so, nevertheless you cannot legally challenge it until later. Resisting arrest can be a criminal offense  on its own. <strong>The top advice in the event you are arrested is to always be calm, always be silent, and demand an attorney before they ask you any sort of questions</strong>. &lt;/p&gt; <br />            &lt;h2&gt;Booking[/b]&lt;/h2&gt; <br />            &lt;p&gt;After being arrested, the police officer will &amp;ldquo;book&amp;rdquo; you. This is the process where they take your fingerprints, get your mug shot, do a background check, and ask you questions. <strong>Remember, you have the right to remain silent and the right to demand a lawyer. You do definitely not need to respond to questions. They aren't going to let you out of jail even should you respond to virtually all their questions.

That's the very best you can certainly do.</strong>&lt;/p&gt; <br />            &lt;h2&gt;Charging&lt;/h2&gt; <br />            &lt;p&gt;The charge originates from the prosecutor, absolutely not law enforcement. The victim  doesn't necessarily get to charge you, and <strong>contrary to popular belief, they don&amp;rsquo;t get to drop the criminal charges either</strong>. The prosecutor will quite often take into consideration the wishes of the victim, however they do not have to. You are within the hands of the state subsequent to being arrested. They can't hold you forever, however. You must be arrested for a criminal offense within a specific limited amount of time or they have got to release you.&lt;/p&gt; <br />            &lt;h2&gt;Arraignment&lt;/h2&gt; <br />            &lt;p&gt;This is where the Judge or Magistrate will formally read your criminal charges and tell you your legal rights. You should have asserted your priviledge to an attorney before now. If not, do so right now. In the event you are asked how to plea, and you do not have an experienced Houston criminal defense attorney, you ought to  say &amp;ldquo;not guilty.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; <br />            &lt;p&gt;The Magistrate will decide whether or not you ought to be released, and if so, how much your bail ought to be. Bail is the amount of cash you, or another person else, has to post with the court so they can be sure you will reappear. In the event you do not, your bond will undoubtedly be forfeited, and the county retains it.&lt;/p&gt; <br />            &lt;p&gt;If bail is set, another person needs to post it for you or hire a bail bondsman to do this. In the event you hire a bail bondsman, and you run off, the bondsman loses the bail money to the court. In the event that occurs, they send another person after you &amp;ndash; a bounty hunter. Additionally, there will undoubtedly be a warrant out for your arrest. In some cases you might be released on your own &amp;ldquo;recognizance&amp;rdquo;, which simply means there's no bail. However you are currently in the system and definitely will need to appear for additional proceedings.&lt;/p&gt; <br />            &lt;h2&gt;Discovery&lt;/h2&gt; <br />            &lt;p&gt;Discovery is known as a pre-trial process where the prosecutor needs to give certain information and facts to your <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5ob3VzdG9uY3JpbWluYWxsYXd5ZXJzLmNvbS9ob3VzdG9uLWNyaW1pbmFsLWxhd3llci9kcnVncy1uYXJjb3RpY3Mtb2ZmZW5zZXMv" target="_blank">Top Houston Criminal Lawyers</a>. Your Houston Criminal Attorneys get to see all of the evidence against you before trial. There aren't any secret, last minute witnesses permitted.&lt;/p&gt; <br />            &lt;h2&gt;Pre-Trial Motions&lt;/h2&gt; <br />            &lt;p&gt;This is the preferred reason to remain silent, not provide your consent to a search, and demand a criminal defense lawyer in the event you are arrested. Your Houston Criminal Defense Attorneys will be able to prepare any number of pre-trial motions. They generally ask the Court to exclude certain evidence from trial if it was obtained in an unlawful or impermissible fashion. It is difficult to suppress evidence if you spoke voluntarily or had given consent to a search.            &lt;/p&gt; <br />            &lt;h2&gt;Plea Bargaining&lt;/h2&gt; <br />            &lt;p&gt;This is known as a fancy word for negotiations.  If the two sides reach an agreement, you will normally need to plead guilty to one or more of the criminal charges to acquire the deal that has been reached. This involves going to court, responding to a few questions from the Judge, and indicating to the court on the record that you are guilty to the charge agreed upon by your Attorneys In Houston and the prosecutor.&lt;/p&gt; <br />            &lt;h2&gt;Trial&lt;/h2&gt; <br />            &lt;p&gt;If the prosecutor and your Houston Criminal Attorneys could not arrive at an agreement on a plea bargain, you will frequently go to trial. Trial is where the government has to put on evidence that you committed a criminal offense, typically including producing witnesses live in the courtroom to testify. You do not need to testify. You do not need to put on any sort of evidence whatsoever. The government has to establish its case, and it needs to demonstrate it beyond a reasonable doubt.&lt;/p&gt; <br />            &lt;h2&gt;Sentencing&lt;/h2&gt; <br />            &lt;p&gt;If you are found guilty, or should you enter a plea of guilty primarily based on a plea bargain, you will undoubtedly be sentenced by the Court. The Judge will make a decision on the appropriate punishment. This might end up being anything from probation to active prison time. There are guidelines that apply and offer the Judge a general range of punishment choices.&lt;/p&gt; <br />            &lt;p&gt;Knowledgeable Houston Lawyers will be able to do a lot on your behalf at sentencing, this includes ensuring that all the procedures are followed, arguing for lesser guidelines, and arguing circumstances that would allow the Judge to sentence you to lower than that called for within the guidelines. Also, a criminal defense attorney may help you prior to sentencing by letting you know what measures you might take to make the Judge more likely to be lenient on you. As an illustration, should you are arrested for drunk driving, and take a class or go to rehab, the Judge <strong>might</strong> take that into consideration when sentencing you.&lt;/p&gt; <br />            &lt;h2&gt;Aggressive Houston Criminal Defense Lawyers&lt;/h2&gt; <br />            &lt;p&gt;I have attempted to offer you a useful overview of the criminal process, with a few great tips on how best to deal with matters at every stage.

As an illustration, should you are arrested for drunk driving, and take a class or go to rehab, the Judge <strong>might</strong> take that into consideration when sentencing you.&lt;/p&gt; <br />            &lt;h2&gt;Aggressive Houston Attorneys&lt;/h2&gt; <br />            &lt;p&gt;I have attempted to offer you a useful overview of the criminal process, with a few recommendations on how best to deal with matters at every stage.

Texas has some of the strictest drug laws in the nation, and the authorities and prosecutors associated with your criminal case aren't going to let you off easy. By working with a lawyer who has substantial knowledge, ability, and practice of this type of criminal law, your chances of resolving your case effectively increase immensely. &lt;br&gt;<br />&lt;br&gt;<br />  Methamphetamine is the illegal drug with the fastest growing rate of abuse in the United States.  More U.S. counties (48%) report that methamphetamine could be the main drug issue in the country - more than cocaine (22%), marijuana (22%) and heroin (3%) combined.  Methamphetamine laboratory seizures have increased 577 percent nationwide since 1995.  Meth, or &amp;quot;speed,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;crank,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;chalk,&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;ice&amp;quot; among many others, has been addicting men and women for years. But illegal production and use of the highly addictive stimulant have increased in the last couple of years, spawning what some authorities call America's first rural drug epidemic.  Methamphetamine is a potent stimulant that can cause a high that will last from 6 to 24 hours. Once preferred largely by West Coast motorcycle gangs, methamphetamine is now spreading across the country. Based on US government surveys, treatment for Methamphetamine addiction has quadrupled since 1993. Greater than Twelve million people above the age of Twelve have tried meth, including one out of ten juveniles (according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention).&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;h2&gt;What exactly is Methamphetamine?&lt;/h2&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;Methamphetamine is a very addictive stimulant that instantly affects the pleasure centers of the brain. With recurrent use of methamphetamine, it turns off the brain's capacity to generate dopamine which leaves the users of the drug incapable of enjoying anything else except more meth.  Methamphetamine is usually smoked, injected intravenously, snorted, or ingested orally. The substance alters mood differently, depending on how it is consumed.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;Methamphetamine is known to raise the user's heart rate, blood pressure, temperature, and respiratory rate, a decrease in appetite, sleep, reaction time, and lung function.  Extended use of methamphetamine can lead to a number of conditions such as &amp;quot;meth mouth&amp;quot;, depression, amphetamine psychosis, obsessive scratching, anorexia, unfavorable social behavior, every type of child neglect, neglect of hygiene and property, prenatal exposure, risky sexual tendencies associated with the spread of HIV and also STD's, aggressive behavior, criminal conduct, and death through the collapse of the cardiovascular system and/or bleeding in the brain, cardiac arrest or hypothermia. Additionally, there are numerous side affects connected with overdose including death, brain damage, feelings of flesh crawling bugs associated with compulsive picking and infecting lesions, muscle breakdown resulting in kidney failure, hallucinations, delusions, and also paranoia.  These horrible conditions connected with meth do not even include the many mishaps and deaths that could occur throughout the cooking procedure as a result of fires, explosions, and coming into contact with highly dangerous chemical compounds usually while the user is high.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;h2&gt;Forms of Methamphetamine&lt;/h2&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;Methamphetamine is known as a central nervous system stimulant with a high potential for abuse and dependence. A synthetic drug, Methamphetamine is similar chemically to amphetamine, but creates increased effects on the central nervous system. The drug's euphoric effects are very similar to, but last longer than those associated with cocaine. The drug generally comes in 3 forms:&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;<strong>Powder:</strong> a white, odorless, and bitter-tasting crystalline powder, readily soluble in alcohol or water. &lt;/p&gt;<br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5ob3VzdG9ubGF3eWVyLmNvbQ__" target="_blank">&lt;img alt=&quot;Top Houston Criminal Lawyer&quot; title=&quot;Hire the Leading Houston Lawyer&quot; src=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.houstonlawyer.com%2Fimages%2Fmeth-powder.jpg%26quot"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.houstonlawyer.com/images/meth-powder.jpg&quot</a>; align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;padding:5px;border:groove;border-color:black;margin:9px&quot; width=&quot;298&quot; /&gt;</a><br />&lt;p&gt;<strong>Crystal:</strong> Users will smoke chunks of a very pure form of crystalline Methamphetamine called &amp;quot;Ice&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;<br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5ob3VzdG9ubGF3eWVyLmNvbQ__" target="_blank">&lt;img alt=&quot;Finest Houston Criminal Defense Attorney&quot; title=&quot;Hire the Recommended Houston Lawyer&quot; src=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.houstonlawyer.com%2Fimages%2Fmeth-crystal.jpg%26quot"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.houstonlawyer.com/images/meth-crystal.jpg&quot</a>; align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;padding:5px;border:groove;border-color:black;margin:10px&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;</a><br />&lt;p&gt;<strong>Rock: </strong>Large chunks of the drug, usually found in yellow, are usually consumed by mouth.&lt;br&gt;<br />  &lt;br&gt;<br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5ob3VzdG9ubGF3eWVyLmNvbQ__" target="_blank">&lt;img alt=&quot;Leading Houston Criminal Lawyer&quot; title=&quot;Hire the Recommended Houston Criminal Attorney&quot; src=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.houstonlawyer.com%2Fimages%2Fmeth-rock.jpg%26quot"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.houstonlawyer.com/images/meth-rock.jpg&quot</a>; align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;padding:5px;border:groove;border-color:black;margin:8px&quot; width=&quot;298&quot; /&gt;</a><br />&lt;h2&gt;Indications of Methamphetamine Addiction&lt;/h2&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;Individuals can become addicted the very first time they take meth, and the dependency  is just about the most challenging to treat. Individuals that take meth can become aggressive and paranoid, and the drug may cause heart attacks and death.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;Addicts are chronic methamphetamine abusers completely focused on avoiding the &amp;quot;crash &amp;quot;, a period of low energy and serious depression that develops as soon as the user stops taking the drug. Throughout the crash, the user often sleeps, even up to a few days at a time, leaving kids unsupervised.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;Meth dependency is rapid, as is the destruction of the user 's family and way of life. Drug tolerance to meth evolves quickly, and the user usually continues his impairment from abusing other alcohol or drugs, a process referred to as &amp;quot;tweaking &amp;quot;, to alleviate the extremely unpleasant feeling after a binge. The tweaker is usually paranoid and experiences a period of delusions and hallucinations during which violent reactions to normally harmless stimuli are normal. All too often, it is children who are in the way. &lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;<strong>The horror of meth abuse just cannot be over-stated. </strong>&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;Methamphetamine abuse consumes the quality of life and ruins people. In the group of photos below, the woman depicted was 38 years old when she died. Amazingly, she is  still living in the last photograph. Each transition represents about 11 months.&lt;/p&gt;<br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5ob3VzdG9ubGF3eWVyLmNvbQ__" target="_blank">&lt;img alt=&quot;Best Houston Criminal Lawyer&quot; title=&quot;Hire the Leading Houston Criminal Lawyer&quot; src=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.houstonlawyer.com%2Fimages%2Ftweaker.jpg%26quot"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.houstonlawyer.com/images/tweaker.jpg&quot</a>; align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;padding:5px;border:groove;border-color:black;margin:10px&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;</a><br />&lt;h2&gt;History of Methamphetamine&lt;/h2&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;Meth was initially synthesized in Germany in 1887, but not for the recreational use that we see currently. The drug was synthesized to treat various kinds of depression, weight control (obesity), narcolepsy, and alcoholism. In the Second World War, Methamphetamine was frequently used by Nazi soldiers.  Hitler's soldiers, aviators, and tank crews received chocolate laced with Methamphetamine on a regular basis. After the war, through the 1970's, the drug was frequently used primarily for medical purposes and one could acquire a legal prescription for Meth. It wasn't until the 1980's that we started to see Methamphetamine being manufactured for recreational purposes. By the mid- 1980's we began to notice meth being produced illicitly in Texas, and since then, the illicit manufacturing of meth has spread like wildfire. &lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;h2&gt;Challenges for Law Enforcement&lt;/h2&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;The addictive character of meth results in numerous challenges for law enforcement officials. Individuals generally become hooked from a single use of the drug and find it extremely hard to later cease using meth. Users, dealers and traffickers often target young teenagers to start using methamphetamine.   The DEA has discovered evidence of this from the increase in availability of flavored meth. Flavors such as strawberry or &amp;quot;strawberry quick,&amp;quot; cola, and chocolate flavored meth have been discovered by authorities in California, Nevada, Washington, Idaho, Texas, New Mexico, Missouri, and Minnesota. &lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;Safety is also an enormous impediment for the police when they happen to find a covert methamphetamine laboratory. It is a widespread practice for small meth lab operators to surround their laboratories with booby traps, designed to severely harm intruders. Several booby traps consist of rigged shot firearms behind doors and appliances, traps that release harmful fumes, and even poisonous snakes. &lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;Folks who violate the law by manufacturing, possessing, or distributing methamphetamine typically break the law in various other ways also - because of or in support of their meth addiction. Many law enforcement agencies will point to a connection between meth manufacturers and methamphetamine addicts and criminal acts including: homicide, domestic abuse, illegal possession of handguns, theft and identity fraud.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;h2&gt;Methamphetamine Defense: Hire the Top Houston Criminal Defense Attorney&lt;/h2&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;Whatever drug charges you are defending, it is very important that you retain the services of The Leading Houston Criminal Attorney who will battle to prevent the extreme penalties that are the result of a drug-related conviction.

Unfortunately, it's all-too-easy to move drugs along the interstate freeway system in all directions. In particular within the Houston area, our police officers have noticed patterns when looking for drug traffickers. It is typical for vehicles to be stopped along northbound interstates and for large amounts of drugs to be found. When suspect vehicles are stopped heading southbound, big amounts of currency are occasionally found. Whether the criminal arrest will be sale, distribution, or drug trafficking will depend upon the kind and also the amount of drugs in question. However the difference you face in penalties is substantial.&lt;br /&gt;<br />A first degree felony drug conviction typically results in a minimum five-year prison term, but in large-scale drug manufacturing or drug distribution cases, jail terms can certainly jump to a minimum of Fifteen years.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;If excessively large sums of United States currency are found inside your vehicle (or a vehicle you are riding in), you may encounter  charges of money laundering.

No case is too big or complex for their firm to handle.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;h3&gt;Seizure of Assets&lt;/h3&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;Law enforcement officers doing drug interdiction work have the legal right to seize assets that were utilized in furtherance of a criminal offense or bought with the proceeds of criminal activity. This indicates they not just confiscate drugs; they also seize money, cars, boats, other personal  property and assets and even real estate. The police or law enforcement agency can then sell the assets  and keep the proceeds or just keep the assets  altogether for their own uses.  This can be particularly common with vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;Asset forfeiture sometimes goes too far, with the police taking property that doesn't belong to anybody charged with the criminal offense, assets  that actually belongs to totally innocent family members or third parties. The Top Houston Criminal Defense Attorney handles asset forfeiture cases, helping clients battle to recover seized assets . &lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;h3&gt;Building Your Drug Manufacture Defense&lt;/h3&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;Most drug manufacturing charges, whether they involve marijuana or methamphetamines, are heard in state court.
