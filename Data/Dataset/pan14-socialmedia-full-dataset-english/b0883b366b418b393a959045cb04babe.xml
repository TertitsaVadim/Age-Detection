Then I saw the Saga Gold Oprah remy weave and knew that I found the one that I wanted to get.<br /><br />Our mother paid for our Saga Gold remy weaves and then took us to the hair salon so that Joyce, our hair stylist, could sew them in for us.  Instead of having one of us wait until the other one was finished, Joyce suggested that we allow one of the other hair stylists to help.  Before my sister or I could say anything, our mother said that is would be fine and the two hair stylists got started sewing in our very different Saga Gold remy weaves.  It was interesting because we could see each other’s weave being attached better than we could see our own.  I was amazed at how different my twin sister looked with long, straight hair.  She must have been equally amazed at my deeply curled transformation because I could see it in her eyes.  After the closure pieces were attached and a few finishing touches were made, we simultaneously stood up and turned toward a big mirror on the wall.  We both looked absolutely gorgeous with our Saga Gold remy weaves.  More importantly, we looked very different from each other and there would be no mistaking which of us was which once we told everyone at the Homecoming Dance that she had the long, straight hair and I had the shorter, curly hair.  We hugged and thanked our mother for purchasing our Saga Gold remy weaves and for agreeing that we could have them look entirely different.<br /><br />When it was time to go to the Homecoming Dance, we also wore completely different looking dresses.  Our mother commented that she would miss the way that we always used to look identical, but she realized that wearing different looking Saga Gold remy weaves was the first step on our journey to eventually marrying and having our own individual lives.<br /><br />Have you ever seen someone whose hair style did not do anything for them?  Even wearing a high quality, gorgeous Saga Gold remy weave does not guarantee that the person will look sensational, unless it is the right one for them.  It is important to choose the right Saga Gold remy weave in order to have a weave style that compliments and even enhances the person’s natural features.  Some people simply choose a Saga Gold remy weave that looks great on the model on the package or on someone that they know personally, but that is not a wise way to choose a weave and it will probably not look so great on them.<br /><br />The main reason that a Saga Gold remy weave looks great on one person and not another is the fact that people have different shaped faces.  There are some aspects about the facial shape that can be greatly influenced by the way that the hair is worn.  For example, if a person has a very long, narrow shaped face, wearing a Saga Gold remy weave that is shoulder length and full of curls on the sides, such as the Spiral Roll, will give the person the appearance of having a fuller face and their face will not look as long and thin.  That could actually add up to quite a bit of money, even if the inferior weaves only cost around twenty dollars per package.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.videojug.com%2Fuser%2Flindseymoreno37%2Fprofile"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.videojug.com/user/lindseymoreno37/profile</a>

She always commented about the beauty of the ones that my sister wore.  My sister made arrangements to purchase the Saga Gold remy weave and have it installed the following Saturday.  I had no idea how to help my daughter take care of a Saga Gold remy weave, but my sister explained everything and told me that she would make sure that my daughter understood the instructions, too.<br /><br />The following Friday, my sister took my daughter to the beauty supply store in a nearby mall so that they could purchase her Saga Gold remy weave and have it ready for the appointment at the hair salon the next morning.  They showed it to me when they got back.  My daughter had two packages and the name on both of them was Water Deep.  I told my daughter that the model in the picture looked really cute with all of those curls and I knew that she would, too.  On Saturday, my sister picked up all three of my girls early in the morning because she told me that getting the Saga Gold remy weave attached to my oldest daughter’s head would take at least half of the day and the other two wanted to see how it was done.<br /><br />Around two in the afternoon, they came back to my house and I could not believe how wonderful the Saga Gold remy weave looked on my daughter.  As she walked toward the front door, I could see that she was more than happy with her new hair.  I could also hear that her sisters were talking about how they could not wait until they were old enough to get their first Saga Gold remy weaves sewn in.  All three of my daughters started telling me all about the process of having a Saga Gold remy weave sewn in.  I listened intently to the details of how the hair stylist put my oldest daughter’s natural hair in tiny braids close to her scalp and then proceeded to use a curved needle and some thick thread to literally sew the Saga Gold remy weave to the braids.  I thanked my sister for giving my girls the opportunity to thoroughly express their feminine virtues.  I was surprised when I saw that my sister had tears forming in her eyes.  When I asked her what was wrong, she told me that she was the one that should be thanking me because she really enjoyed having my young girls to share her beauty tips and be excited about things that excited her.<br /><br />All Saga Gold remy weaves are made to last a long time due to the high quality of the hair that is used to make them.  These curls are not just light, dangling curls, either.  They are made upward and outward so that they are very full and add quite a bit of width to the face.  I really like this because I have a very long, narrow face and the beautiful curls of the Aksent Curve Saga Gold remy weave give my face the much needed look of width to counter its length.<br /><br />Even if I did not have a very long, narrow face, I think that I would still like wearing the Aksent Curve Saga Gold remy weave.  It is a very fun looking hair style that fits in well no matter what I am doing.  My husband likes the fact that I do not have to fuss with this weave the way that I did with most of the inferior weaves that I wore years ago.  The curls in this weave stay fluffy and bouncy all day long, no matter what I am involved in.  One day, I went from a work day full of business meetings to an evening in our hot tub and my Aksent Curve Saga Gold remy weave looked great throughout the whole day without me combing it or touching up the curls.  It is so easy to care for throughout the day that I often forget that I am even wearing a weave.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.folkd.com%2Fdetail%2Fwww.blackhairspray.com%252Fbrands%252Fsaga.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.folkd.com/detail/www.blackhairspray.com%2Fbrands%2Fsaga.html</a>

There are some aspects about the facial shape that can be greatly influenced by the way that the hair is worn.  For example, if a person has a very long, narrow shaped face, wearing a Saga Gold remy weave that is shoulder length and full of curls on the sides, such as the Spiral Roll, will give the person the appearance of having a fuller face and their face will not look as long and thin.  In contrast, if the same person were to wear a Saga Gold remy weave that is long and straight like the Remy Yaky, their face would look even more long and drawn out than it usually did.  The same circumstances work for all of the various main facial shapes such as square, triangular, heart, and round.  The only people that have an easy facial shape to work with are those with oval faces because they can wear almost any Saga Gold remy weave and still look great.<br /><br />Another thing that people need to pay attention to when they are choosing a Saga Gold remy weave for them self is the color of the strands of hair.  Of course, if the intention of wearing the Saga Gold remy weave is to attract attention, then any offered color will do.  However, the majority of people that wear a Saga Gold remy weave are trying to do it discreetly and really need their new hair to closely resemble their natural hair so that no one will notice the change.  Using a color chart to match their natural hair color might be too difficult for some people to handle.  Most beauty supply stores will have a ring of sample hair colors available for their customers to use in choosing their new Saga Gold remy weave color.  These hair color rings can also be found at some hair salons because they are used when customers are interested in having their hair stylist change the color of their natural hair.  Holding the colors close to the natural hair makes it very easy to see determine which color is the closest match.  If a hair color ring cannot be found, it is perfectly acceptable to ask either the hair stylist or the employees at the beauty supply store for some assistance in finding the right color.<br /><br />The length of the Saga Gold remy weave can also make a difference in how the person appears, although making the above decisions greatly eliminates the need to look closely at the length of the weaves that are being considered.  If necessary, the length of the weave hair can be altered by a hair stylist after it has been installed.  That could actually add up to quite a bit of money, even if the inferior weaves only cost around twenty dollars per package.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.empireonline.com%2Fmyempire%2Fp_default.asp%3F411991"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.empireonline.com/myempire/p_default.asp?411991</a>

When I asked her what was wrong, she told me that she was the one that should be thanking me because she really enjoyed having my young girls to share her beauty tips and be excited about things that excited her.<br /><br />All Saga Gold remy weaves are made to last a long time due to the high quality of the hair that is used to make them.  However, if you do not take proper care of your Saga Gold remy weave while you are wearing it or during a storage period, it will deteriorate much quicker than expected and will need to be replaced long before it should.  Along with taking care of the strands of hair in your Saga Gold remy weave, you must also be sure that you are paying attention to the care of your natural hair even though it is not exposed to the detrimental effects of your surroundings.<br /><br />Proper cleaning is the key to keeping your Saga Gold remy weave looking great and lasting longer than most other brands of weaves.  Even though your Saga Gold remy weave is made entirely of human hair, you should not just jump in the shower and wash it as you would your natural hair.  You need to be sure that you are not going to cause any damage to it.  The best way to know that is to consult with your hair stylist when you have your Saga Gold remy weave installed.  He or she will tell you if there are any actions that you should avoid while cleaning your weave or if there are certain things that you need to be sure that you do during the cleaning process.  Once you have the specifics about caring for your particular Saga Gold remy weave according to the method that was used to install it, you can begin properly caring for it without any worries of ruining it.<br /><br />Although all of the Saga Gold remy weaves are made with exceptional hair strands and not prone to tangling, it is important that you always make sure that there are no tangles in your Saga Gold remy weave before you begin to wash it.  When detangling, you should always start at the bottom and comb through just a few inches of hair at a time, slowly working your way up to the crown of your head.  Starting at the tips and working slowly is important because if there were an unseen tangle in your Saga Gold remy weave and you started pulling your comb through from the top, the tangle would only get worse and you might even end up pulling out some of your weave hair.<br /><br />Once the tangles are removed, you can proceed to use mild shampoo to carefully wash the strands of hair in your weave.  It is important that you do it carefully and not rub it in such a way that you cause tangles to form.  This helps ensure that the strands of hair are in perfect condition when they are collected so that the Saga Gold remy weave will remain looking and feeling great long after other brands of weaves have been discarded and replaced.<br /><br />All of these remy weaves are really great, but it is the style of the Saga Gold Aksent Curve remy weave that I really like.  Unlike some others, this gorgeous remy weave can only be found in a single length which is twelve inches, but that is all that it needs to be beautiful.  The Aksent Curve Saga Gold remy weave has beautiful curls that start a little below the top of the head and barely reach the shoulders, depending of course on the person’s body structure.  It is so easy to care for throughout the day that I often forget that I am even wearing a weave.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ikeepbookmarks.com%2Fbrowse.asp%3Ffolder%3D3143365%26amp%3Brefresh%3Dtrue%3Frefresh%3Dtrue%26amp%3Bt%3D10%252F11%252F2011%2B1%253A05%253A03%2BAM%26amp%3BclientWidth%3D0"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.ikeepbookmarks.com/browse.asp?folder=3143365&amp;refresh=true?refresh=true&amp;t=10%2F11%2F2011+1%3A05%3A03+AM&amp;clientWidth=0</a>

My sister and I both shook our heads and told our mother that we preferred to choose our own Saga Gold remy weaves and they would most likely be very different.  Having identical facial features was something that we could not control, but we both thought that it would be better if we could have hair styles that made it easier for people to see that we were individuals.<br /><br />About a week before the Homecoming Dance, our mother took us to the beauty supply store at the mall and said that we were allowed to choose whichever Saga Gold remy weave we wanted.  My sister and I had discussed our options and she decided that she wanted to try a Saga Gold remy weave that was not as wavy as our natural hair, whereas I wanted to go even curlier because I liked it when I used a curling iron to put deep curls in my natural hair.  She chose to get a sixteen inch long Remy Yaky Saga Gold weave.  It was the straightest looking weave that she could find.  It was a little more difficult for me to find the curly styled Saga Gold remy weave that I thought would be best for me to wear.  I could see that our mother was looking at my sister’s weave choice and considering asking me to simply choose the Remy Yaky, too.  I did not want to go that route, but I could see that she was getting impatient.  Then I saw the Saga Gold Oprah remy weave and knew that I found the one that I wanted to get.<br /><br />Our mother paid for our Saga Gold remy weaves and then took us to the hair salon so that Joyce, our hair stylist, could sew them in for us.  Instead of having one of us wait until the other one was finished, Joyce suggested that we allow one of the other hair stylists to help.  Before my sister or I could say anything, our mother said that is would be fine and the two hair stylists got started sewing in our very different Saga Gold remy weaves.  It was interesting because we could see each other’s weave being attached better than we could see our own.  I was amazed at how different my twin sister looked with long, straight hair.  Even if the person thinks that they thoroughly washed and dried their Saga Gold remy weave, there is always the possibility that something could still go wrong and one day they open the box to find a stinky, fuzzy wad of hair.  One thing that could go wrong even though the strands of hair in the weave might have been thoroughly washed and dried, is that the container itself might have still had a bit of dampness or even a few drops of water that went unnoticed.  Periodically checking on the ones being stored will prevent the possibility of ruining the stored Saga Gold remy weaves like that.<br /><br />Most people that start wearing Saga Gold remy weaves do not turn to another brand later.  These high quality weaves are reasonably priced considering the option of reusing the same one several times.  That could actually add up to quite a bit of money, even if the inferior weaves only cost around twenty dollars per package.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fcinesourcemagazine.com%2Findex.php%3F%2Fmember%2F132147%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://cinesourcemagazine.com/index.php?/member/132147/</a>

When our children were still quite young, my sister and I agreed that she would introduce my daughters to the fashion world, while I helped her boys practice sports.  This was very easy to accomplish because our houses are actually in the same neighborhood.<br /><br />When my oldest daughter turned fourteen, my sister asked if I would agree to her getting a Saga Gold remy weave sewn in.  I did not hesitate to reply that if my daughter was really interested in getting the Saga Gold remy weave, then it was fine with me.

I listened intently to the details of how the hair stylist put my oldest daughter’s natural hair in tiny braids close to her scalp and then proceeded to use a curved needle and some thick thread to literally sew the Saga Gold remy weave to the braids.  I thanked my sister for giving my girls the opportunity to thoroughly express their feminine virtues.  If it was attached using liquid bonding glue or any other type of bonding product it is best that you are careful not to apply any heated tools near the points of attachment and to avoid using the blow dryer all together.  For bonded hair, it is best to just allow it to air dry.  When your weave hair is completely dry, you can style it as you wish as long as you do not go against anything that your hair stylist told you not to do.<br /><br />If you are looking for a nice looking remy weave that has a bit of spirit to it, I think that you should consider the Aksent Curve Saga Gold remy weave.  I purchased my first one several years ago and have not worn anything else since then.  My friend tried to get me to try some of the other Saga Gold remy weaves, but I thought that it was silly to try out something else when I was more than pleased with the one that I had.  The idea was even sillier when I remembered that she was the one that first introduced me to the Aksent Curve Saga Gold remy weave.<br /><br />The Aksent Curve Saga Gold remy weave is made by Milky Way, which is one of the leading companies in the hair enhancement industry.  All of their products are made from only the best strands of hair in the business.  Milky Way collects the hair from healthy, young people located in various countries around the world.  These people are contracted years in advance and have to maintain their physical health as well as the health of their hair as it grows long enough to be collected and made into any Saga Gold remy weave.  They cannot use any type of harsh chemicals to color or perm their hair at all.  This helps ensure that the strands of hair are in perfect condition when they are collected so that the Saga Gold remy weave will remain looking and feeling great long after other brands of weaves have been discarded and replaced.<br /><br />All of these remy weaves are really great, but it is the style of the Saga Gold Aksent Curve remy weave that I really like.  Unlike some others, this gorgeous remy weave can only be found in a single length which is twelve inches, but that is all that it needs to be beautiful.  The Aksent Curve Saga Gold remy weave has beautiful curls that start a little below the top of the head and barely reach the shoulders, depending of course on the person’s body structure.  This Saga Gold remy weave is great for anyone that does not like a lot of height on the crown of their head, but needs the fullness of the curls on the sides of their head.  These curls are not just light, dangling curls, either.  They are made upward and outward so that they are very full and add quite a bit of width to the face.  I really like this because I have a very long, narrow face and the beautiful curls of the Aksent Curve Saga Gold remy weave give my face the much needed look of width to counter its length.<br /><br />Even if I did not have a very long, narrow face, I think that I would still like wearing the Aksent Curve Saga Gold remy weave.  It is a very fun looking hair style that fits in well no matter what I am doing.  My husband likes the fact that I do not have to fuss with this weave the way that I did with most of the inferior weaves that I wore years ago.  It is so easy to care for throughout the day that I often forget that I am even wearing a weave.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.stumbleupon.com%2Furl%2Fwww.blackhairspray.com%2Fbrands%2Fsaga.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.stumbleupon.com/url/www.blackhairspray.com/brands/saga.html</a>

All three of my daughters started telling me all about the process of having a Saga Gold remy weave sewn in.  I listened intently to the details of how the hair stylist put my oldest daughter’s natural hair in tiny braids close to her scalp and then proceeded to use a curved needle and some thick thread to literally sew the Saga Gold remy weave to the braids.  I thanked my sister for giving my girls the opportunity to thoroughly express their feminine virtues.  I was surprised when I saw that my sister had tears forming in her eyes.  When I asked her what was wrong, she told me that she was the one that should be thanking me because she really enjoyed having my young girls to share her beauty tips and be excited about things that excited her.<br /><br />All Saga Gold remy weaves are made to last a long time due to the high quality of the hair that is used to make them.  However, if you do not take proper care of your Saga Gold remy weave while you are wearing it or during a storage period, it will deteriorate much quicker than expected and will need to be replaced long before it should.  Along with taking care of the strands of hair in your Saga Gold remy weave, you must also be sure that you are paying attention to the care of your natural hair even though it is not exposed to the detrimental effects of your surroundings.<br /><br />Proper cleaning is the key to keeping your Saga Gold remy weave looking great and lasting longer than most other brands of weaves.  Even though your Saga Gold remy weave is made entirely of human hair, you should not just jump in the shower and wash it as you would your natural hair.  You need to be sure that you are not going to cause any damage to it.  The best way to know that is to consult with your hair stylist when you have your Saga Gold remy weave installed.  He or she will tell you if there are any actions that you should avoid while cleaning your weave or if there are certain things that you need to be sure that you do during the cleaning process.  Once you have the specifics about caring for your particular Saga Gold remy weave according to the method that was used to install it, you can begin properly caring for it without any worries of ruining it.<br /><br />Although all of the Saga Gold remy weaves are made with exceptional hair strands and not prone to tangling, it is important that you always make sure that there are no tangles in your Saga Gold remy weave before you begin to wash it.  When detangling, you should always start at the bottom and comb through just a few inches of hair at a time, slowly working your way up to the crown of your head.  Starting at the tips and working slowly is important because if there were an unseen tangle in your Saga Gold remy weave and you started pulling your comb through from the top, the tangle would only get worse and you might even end up pulling out some of your weave hair.<br /><br />Once the tangles are removed, you can proceed to use mild shampoo to carefully wash the strands of hair in your weave.  It is important that you do it carefully and not rub it in such a way that you cause tangles to form.  When you have thoroughly washed your Saga Gold remy weave and worked some of the shampoo down to your natural hair to clean it, you can rinse away the lather and follow up with a quality conditioner.  Then, rinse again, and squeeze out any water that you can before using a towel to gently pat the hair dry.  It is so easy to care for throughout the day that I often forget that I am even wearing a weave.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.socialn.net%2Fusers%2F101345%2FLindseydea%2F1.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.socialn.net/users/101345/Lindseydea/1.html</a>

Instead of having one of us wait until the other one was finished, Joyce suggested that we allow one of the other hair stylists to help.  Before my sister or I could say anything, our mother said that is would be fine and the two hair stylists got started sewing in our very different Saga Gold remy weaves.  It was interesting because we could see each other’s weave being attached better than we could see our own.  I was amazed at how different my twin sister looked with long, straight hair.  She must have been equally amazed at my deeply curled transformation because I could see it in her eyes.  After the closure pieces were attached and a few finishing touches were made, we simultaneously stood up and turned toward a big mirror on the wall.  We both looked absolutely gorgeous with our Saga Gold remy weaves.  More importantly, we looked very different from each other and there would be no mistaking which of us was which once we told everyone at the Homecoming Dance that she had the long, straight hair and I had the shorter, curly hair.  We hugged and thanked our mother for purchasing our Saga Gold remy weaves and for agreeing that we could have them look entirely different.<br /><br />When it was time to go to the Homecoming Dance, we also wore completely different looking dresses.

Even wearing a high quality, gorgeous Saga Gold remy weave does not guarantee that the person will look sensational, unless it is the right one for them.  It is important to choose the right Saga Gold remy weave in order to have a weave style that compliments and even enhances the person’s natural features.  Some people simply choose a Saga Gold remy weave that looks great on the model on the package or on someone that they know personally, but that is not a wise way to choose a weave and it will probably not look so great on them.<br /><br />The main reason that a Saga Gold remy weave looks great on one person and not another is the fact that people have different shaped faces.  That could actually add up to quite a bit of money, even if the inferior weaves only cost around twenty dollars per package.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.howcast.com%2Fusers%2Flindseymoreno37"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.howcast.com/users/lindseymoreno37</a>

My sister and I both shook our heads and told our mother that we preferred to choose our own Saga Gold remy weaves and they would most likely be very different.  Having identical facial features was something that we could not control, but we both thought that it would be better if we could have hair styles that made it easier for people to see that we were individuals.<br /><br />About a week before the Homecoming Dance, our mother took us to the beauty supply store at the mall and said that we were allowed to choose whichever Saga Gold remy weave we wanted.  My sister and I had discussed our options and she decided that she wanted to try a Saga Gold remy weave that was not as wavy as our natural hair, whereas I wanted to go even curlier because I liked it when I used a curling iron to put deep curls in my natural hair.  She chose to get a sixteen inch long Remy Yaky Saga Gold weave.  It was the straightest looking weave that she could find.  It was a little more difficult for me to find the curly styled Saga Gold remy weave that I thought would be best for me to wear.  I could see that our mother was looking at my sister’s weave choice and considering asking me to simply choose the Remy Yaky, too.  I did not want to go that route, but I could see that she was getting impatient.  Then I saw the Saga Gold Oprah remy weave and knew that I found the one that I wanted to get.<br /><br />Our mother paid for our Saga Gold remy weaves and then took us to the hair salon so that Joyce, our hair stylist, could sew them in for us.

Before my sister or I could say anything, our mother said that is would be fine and the two hair stylists got started sewing in our very different Saga Gold remy weaves.  These hair color rings can also be found at some hair salons because they are used when customers are interested in having their hair stylist change the color of their natural hair.  Holding the colors close to the natural hair makes it very easy to see determine which color is the closest match.  If a hair color ring cannot be found, it is perfectly acceptable to ask either the hair stylist or the employees at the beauty supply store for some assistance in finding the right color.<br /><br />The length of the Saga Gold remy weave can also make a difference in how the person appears, although making the above decisions greatly eliminates the need to look closely at the length of the weaves that are being considered.  If necessary, the length of the weave hair can be altered by a hair stylist after it has been installed.  That could actually add up to quite a bit of money, even if the inferior weaves only cost around twenty dollars per package.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy53b21lbnNwb3N0LmNhL3VzZXJzL2xpbmRzZXltb3Jlbm8zNw__" target="_blank">saga gold</a>
