Recognized as seaweed, this ocean’s vegetable has several advantages in boosting health.
<br /><br /><strong>Seaweed: Powerhouse of mineral</strong>
<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5mdWVsdGhlbWluZC5jb20vaGVhbHRoL251dHJpdGlvbi9udXRyaXRpb25fYXJ0aWNsZXMvYmVuZWZpdHNfb2Zfc2Vhd2VlZF9udXRyaXRpb25fYXJ0aWNsZS5odG1s" target="_blank">Seaweed nutrition</a> is recognized as ancient super food and reason behind ancestor’s health and longevity. Seaweed pulls outstanding wealth of mineral elements from the sea that can accounts to 36% of its dry mass. This sea vegetable stores iodine, calcium, magnesium, iron, vitamins C and A, protein, vitamins B, fiber and, alpha linoleic acid, EPA, and so much more. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5mdWVsdGhlbWluZC5jb20vaGVhbHRoL251dHJpdGlvbi9udXRyaXRpb25fYXJ0aWNsZXMvYmVuZWZpdHNfb2Zfc2Vhd2VlZF9udXRyaXRpb25fYXJ0aWNsZS5odG1s" target="_blank">Seaweed benefits</a> master over the advantages in fruits and vegetables, as it contain more vitamins. It has plenty of dietary fiber.
<br /><br /><strong>Seaweed benefits in raw or sun dried form:</strong>
<br /><br />•High protein content: from 20% in green algae to 70% in spirulina.
<br /><br />•High mineral content such as iodine, calcium, iron, magnesium.
<br /><br />•More vitamin C than oranges.
<br /><br />•Natural iodine for healthy thyroid function.
<br /><br />•Anti-viral, anti-bacterial, anti-inflammatory properties
<br /><br />•Offer enormous calcium
<br /><br />•Seaweed nutrition prevents degenerative diseases including cardiovascular and diabetes 2. It also releases feel-good chemicals in the brain, heightens liver function and stabilizes blood sugar. 
<br /><br />•Studies have shown that sufficient levels of folic acid in the diet are required to prevent certain birth defects, including spina bifida. Folic acid is also helpful in breaking down an intermediate dangerous chemical called homocysteine. The chemical Homocysteine can ruin blood vessel walls, and high levels of this chemical are linked with increased risk of cardiovascular disease and stroke. But consumption of seaweed lowers down all these health deficits.
<br /><br />•Seaweed is beneficial in stressful situations by supplying not just magnesium, but pantothenic acid and riboflavin--two B-vitamins are highly vital for energy production. Pantothenic acid is good for the health of the adrenal glands. The adrenals control several body functions and offer resistance to stress. When supplies of vital nutrients like pantothenic acids are insufficient stressful times can lead to depletion of the adrenal glands make human body suffer chronic fatigue, lower resistance to allergies and infection. 
<br /><br /><strong>Seaweed benefits are blessing to human</strong>
<br /><br />Scientists have concluded that sea vegetables lend broadest range of minerals of any food located on earth. Western cultures are beginning to explore the nutritional value of sea vegetables but have they have great recognition in Japanese diet for centuries. In fact, sea vegetables are equipped with the nutrients found in the ocean and very same minerals found in human blood.

Any family history of increased blood sugar level or heredity have great role to play for making you prone towards this disease. Diabetes can be defined as disorder in blood sugar control due to inadequate generation of insulin or the cells have become insulin resistance.
<br /><br /><strong>Diabetes control vital for other organs</strong>
<br /><br />Ineffective diabetic management or inefficient diabetes control can invite fatal complications that can have huge impact on kidneys, liver, heart, eyes, and the nerves. Carelessness towards the diabetes, regardless of their types-Type 1 diabetes and Type 2 diabetes will make it incurable disease. According to scientists, there are several genes that influence your sensitivity to Diabetes.
<br /><br />Diabetes, if unchecked can be root cause for several other issues in human body. Hence, pay heed towards the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wZW9wbGVzLWhlYWx0aC5jb20vZGlhYmV0ZXMuaHRt" target="_blank">diabetes symptoms</a> .
<br /><br />Let us learn about the new researches being conducted in two type of diabetes
<br /><br />• The HLA region accommodates several genes that actively participate in immune system functions. These genes are responsible for manufacturing proteins for the immune cells. Immune system cells make use of these proteins to locate encroachers like bacteria and viruses and also body's own cells. If this entire identifying process is ruined then the immune cells combat the cells in the body that are generated from the pancreas and this process is called as autoimmune reaction. Basically, two genes from the HLA region decide individual's risk of attaining Type 1 diabetes from his or her parents. These genes are named as DR and DQ genes. The DR gene has 40-50% probability of attaining diabetes.
<br /><br />• The insulin gene is a part of the DNA that secretes insulin. Any alteration around the insulin gene has impact on person's predisposition to Type 1 diabetes.
<br /><br />• Researchers are exploring that Beta3-adrenergic receptor gene has strong influence in case of Type 2 Diabetes. The gene is aimed for locating the amount of calories burnt while resting. Changes or mutations in this gene rust out the burning process of fats and calories and increases chance of an individual to grow obese. Besides, there are many other genes involved in Type 2 diabetes. But researchers are now involved in finding the specific gene mutations that have direct influence on diabetes.
<br /><br />It is true that genes have strong influence on making person prone to diabetes but diabetes symptoms are also found in the individuals with poor eating habits and sedentary lifestyle. These aforementioned factors coupled with genetic risk factor boosts person’s susceptibility to this disease. Family member with diabetes might put you at risk due to faulty genes, but healthy lifestyle alters blood sugar level and discourages the risk of being diabetic.

<br /><br />•	Acute or chronic leukemia: This one spreads fast and person easily falls sick. 
<br />•	Lymphocytic or myelogenous. Both affect white blood cells. 
<br /><br />Adults are known from suffering chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and acute myelogenous leukemia. However, in children, leukemia is acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Childhood leukemias might also incorporate acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and other myeloid leukemias, including chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML).
