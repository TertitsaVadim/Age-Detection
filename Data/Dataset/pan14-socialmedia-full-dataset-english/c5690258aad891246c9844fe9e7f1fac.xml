<br />The history of Whitby is both varied and fascinating. The forerunner of Whitby Abbey was a wooden church structure, built on the top of the  East Cliff  in  AD 656, little is known about Whitby prior to this period. In the Roman period there was a lighthouse most likely located at the same site which gave rise to the Saxon name of Streonshalh (lighhouse bay). There could possibly have been a Roman settlement here but the only indication  of such is a couple of coins found here and the close proximity of the Roman Roads. There have been many Roman Settlements in the immediate area, and indeed, in some of the moorland villages there is evidence of such settlements.
<br /><br />St. Hilda  founded the Abbey in  AD 656 and lived there until her death in AD 680. She was a remarkable woman, very knowledgeable and wise and much respected by the various Kings  .  A famous early English poet, named Caedmon, was a lowly herdsman when Hilda inspired him to write down his dreams. The abbey location of the  Synod of Whitby  in AD 664, was chosen by King Oswiu of Northumbria, to calculate the date of Easter in line with the customs of Rome. Legend  has it that St. Hilda  drove a plague of snakes off the end of the cliff and these turned to stone. The stone like fossils called ammonites are, in fact, called hildoceras after St. Hilda. Many years ago snakes heads were carved onto the ammonites and sold as souvenirs. Three ammonites are on the plaque of Whitby Town.
<br /><br />After the death of St. Hilda, the wooden monastery was replaced by a 40 cell stone building later to be wrecked by the Danes circa AD 866. The  Abbey you see right now, started to be built around 1078, after laying derelict for 200 years. The town was given its modern name of Whitby  (white-town), around this time. In 1334 a gale blew down the nave walls, again it was rebuilt. Whitby Abbey was detroyed in 1539, by Hentry VIII, with the Dissolution of the Monastries.  The building stood until 1711 but then in 1736 the south transept collapsed and the nave fell in 1794. In 1830 the central tower crumbled and storms damaged the choir in 1839. It was shelled by the Germans on December 14th, 1914.
<br /><br />When the present day  Abbey was rebuilt in about 1078, the town flourished and the inhabitants grew from only a few homes on the cliffs near the Abbey to  numerous  properties on both sides of the river. In 1128 King Henry VIII granted permission for a fair in honour of St. Hilda on August 25th and  a second fair in November.
<br /><br />Around the period of Elizabeth 1st, (1558-1603) Whitby was an recognized  fishing port  with an expanding population. Thomas Chaloner of York travelled to Italy, at the end of the 1500's, and visited some alum works. He started an alum industry in the Whitby area, and this broke the monopoly that Italy had  in supplying England  with alum. The alum was used to fix of dyes in cloth and in the curing of leather. Aum production increased greatly the existing commerce in the port of Whitby.
<br /><br />In the the middle of the  18th century  there was an expansion of the port's fishing to include whaling. Between 1753 and 1837 there were 577 whaling expeditions, between 1753 and 1837.  The most well-known of the whaling captains was  Captain William  Scoresby  (1760-1829) who invented the crow's nest in 1807. With the decline of the whaling industry, the last ship The Camden made its last whaling voyage in 1837.
<br /><br />Captain James Cook (1728 - 1779) was a extremely famous Whitby resident. He was born in  Marton, later he moved to Great Ayton, where he attended the local school (now a museum). At the age of 16 he moved to Staithes to become an apprentice to a grocer. The love of the sea, however, saw him to move to Whitby after 18 months to live with the Walker family,  a local shipbuilders. After serving a three year  apprenticeship he then sailed with the merchant navy rising through the ranks. In 1755 he joined the Royal Navy and  in 1768 he commanded  HMS  Endeavour  which  was  hired by the Royal Society to record the transit of venus  across the sun. He sailed to the Pacific where the observations were to be made then continued to map out New Zealand and later The coastline of Australia. In Grape Lane on Whitby's East Side there is The Captain Cook Museum which is, in fact, the original house he lived in at the time of his apprenticeship. A Statue of Captain Cook stands on the West Cliff, standing over six feet tall looking out to sea. It was presented to Whitby by the MP Sir Gervase Becket MP  in 1912.
<br /><br />In 1839 George Hudson  built the Whitby  to Pickering Railway which greatly increased the popularity of Whitby  as a tourist  location. Hudson also built many of the buildings in the West Cliff area, many of which are big houses and &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wonderfulwhitby.co.uk%2Fwonderfulwhitbyblog%2Fwhitby-accommodation-whitby-hotels-whitby-holiday-cottages-whitby-bs%2F%26quot%3B%26gt%3BWhitby"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.wonderfulwhitby.co.uk/wonderfulwhitbyblog/whitby-accommodation-whitby-hotels-whitby-holiday-cottages-whitby-bs/&quot;&gt;Whitby</a> Hotels&lt;/a&gt;. Since the Victorian times onwards, Whitby has gone from strength to strength  with regard to tourism. There is now a wide variety of guest houses, hotels, self-catering establishments and restaurants. Growth continues with the introduction of even more tourist related properties and  attractions.

This historic town with its seafaring traditions, has seen a rise in tourism over the last few decades.
<br /><br />This town of two parts, the east and the west, divided by the harbour and annexed by the old Swing Bridge has much to offer the potential visitor.  Its geography and  natural harbour setting combined  with three different beaches, makes this an ideal destination for both families and adults alike.  Increasingly popular, it is no longer only known for the typical summer holidays but for many weekends and short breaks.
<br /><br />The accommodation choice available over the last years has increased tremendously, ranging from hotels to campsites.   Increasingly popular is the &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wonderfulwhitby.co.uk%2Fcottages.html%26quot%3B%26gt%3BWhitby"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.wonderfulwhitby.co.uk/cottages.html&quot;&gt;Whitby</a> Cottages &lt;/a&gt; accommodation option.
<br /><br />Because of its history and fishing traditions, there are many ‘fisherman's cottages' renovated and transformed into holiday accommodation.    Many of these cottages are to be found around the harbour area on both the east and west sides of the town. 
<br /><br />The updated ‘fishermen's cottages along with the many other types of self-catering establishments offer a high level or decoration and services.  Many of the &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wonderfulwhitby.co.uk%2Fcottages.html%26quot%3B%26gt%3BWhitby"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.wonderfulwhitby.co.uk/cottages.html&quot;&gt;Whitby</a> Cottages &lt;/a&gt; are registered with either the local tourist office or  holiday letting agents.   Both of these sources are in association with the English Tourist Board This offers a degree of certainty with regard to the standards of the accommodation. The English Tourist Board sets certain standards which must be adhered to.  They give graded levels similar to that of hotels. This grading gives the potential visitor a degree of certainty with regard to standards expected by each establishment. Many styles of cottages etc are available to cater for the different choices, ranging from the contemporary ultra modern to the quaint old world style.   There are a wide range of publications available to advertise and promote the cottages i.e. holiday guides and brochures.  With the advent of the internet, increasing number of visitors can view and book  their intended holiday accommodation online.
<br /><br />Various types of holiday cottage accommodation can be found in and around the town and  on the outskirts of Whitby.   Those slightly out of the centre  are more likely to have  private parking.  One of the main advantages of the self-catering holiday cottages is the freedom allowed to the visitor.  No need to worry about breakfast and evening meal times,  no need to vacate the premises early morning and no curfew of an evening!   As budgets for holidays vary between one family and another so to do the prices for holiday accommodation.  Because there is such a wide degree of choice available, there are properties to suit all pockets.
<br /><br />As previously stated, over the last decades the holiday trade has increased immensely resulting in large investments  in the town.  To complement the holiday cottage trade, there has been a knock on effect on the number of restaurants and cafes opening for business. Media attention through television and newspaper articles has led to larger numbers of the population being aware this ‘jewel' of a holiday destination.Events such as the Goths Weekend in the spring and the autumn together with the timetable events on the North Yorkshire Moors Railway have extended the season from just the summer months.  No longer does the town ‘close' for the winter, but rather it continues all year round thanks to the accommodation providers catering to the demand.
<br /><br />There is no doubt that the holiday cottage accommodation providers will continue to cater for the tourists in the coming years giving a high level of service and a commitment to ensuring that their accommodation is well kept and good value for money.

Possibly as early as Roman times (there is evidence of a Roman lighthouse on the East Side cliff top) the port of Whitby has been host to a wide range of craft from traders to whalers and even invaders!
<br /><br />Captain James Cook is certainly &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wonderfulwhitby.co.uk%26quot%3B%26gt%3BWhitby"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.wonderfulwhitby.co.uk&quot;&gt;Whitby</a> UK&lt;/a&gt; 's most famous seafaring connection After an apprenticeship in Whitby, Cook left to enroll in the Royal Navy, and embarked on his well known career. The  Endeavour with which he is synonymously linked with the charting of the coastline of Australia was, in reality, a Whitby cat (a coal vessel).
<br /><br />With the increase in the whaling industry another Whitby son, Sir William Scoresby along with his son, became well-known Whaling Captains. The crow's nest was the idea of Sir William Scoresby which allowed the easier visibility of the location of schools of whales. It was adopted by many other sorts of sailing vessels for the purpose of both lookout for pirates and hazardous rocks. A structure of a crow's nest dedicated to Sir William Scoresby is situated alongside Whitby Harbour close  to the Tourist Information Centre.
<br /><br />The past few years has seen a decrease in the amount of commercial trade carried out at &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wonderfulwhitby.co.uk%26quot%3B%26gt%3BWhitby"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.wonderfulwhitby.co.uk&quot;&gt;Whitby</a> UK&lt;/a&gt;  Harbour. The unloading of freight and storage at Dock End has all but ceased together with  the work of the Custom men.
<br /><br />Nowadays the harbour continues to be vibrant, but this is largely due to tourism. There are still a few boatbuilders and repairers, further upriver, and the few remaining full-time fishermen, who struggle to make a living with the current economic climate and legislation.
<br /><br />A colourful sight in the harbour these days, are the boat trips and pleasure trips to sea each day. The calls of the boatmen attracting attention to the various boats available, the shriek of the seagulls swooping above the harbour looking for titbits and leftovers left by the visitors and the constant hum of engines beating like hearts in the engine holds, ensure that Whitby Harbour remains alive and continues to provide both income and pleasure to the townsfolk and the ever increasing visitors.
<br /><br />There are many different boat trips to pick from. These include a mini replica of Captain Cooks Endeavour, and the Mary Anne Hepworth, Whitby's Old Lifeboat. There are bigger craft that take lengthier excursions, including sunset cruises and whale watching trips.

<br /><br />Due to its location, it is particularly popular with visitors from the immediate area such as Cleveland, Northumberland and the East and West Ridings of Yorkshire. Over the past couple of decades, however, the visitors have travelled from further afield including the south of England, Wales, Scotland, Ireland and many from overseas.
<br /><br />As its popularity has increased, so too has the  number of  accommodation  providers.The &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wonderfulwhitby.co.uk%2Fwonderfulwhitbyblog%2Fwhitby-accommodation-whitby-hotels-whitby-holiday-cottages-whitby-bs%2F%26quot%3B%26gt%3BWhitby"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.wonderfulwhitby.co.uk/wonderfulwhitbyblog/whitby-accommodation-whitby-hotels-whitby-holiday-cottages-whitby-bs/&quot;&gt;Whitby</a> Hotels&lt;/a&gt; sector, in particular, has been quick to realise the potential income from the vast numbers of  people not only staying for a break-away but also for their annual summer holiday. More and more ‘special events' are added to the yearly calendar making a steady increase in the numbers of people requiring accommodation at various times of the year.
<br /><br />Christmas and the New Year has seen numbers increasing and the hotels and restaurants have risen to the demands at that time. The advent of the Gothic Weekends and other events  during the spring and autumn have seen numbers swell to quite often full capacity across the board from the smallest of b &amp; bs to the guest houses, hotels and self catering accommodation.
<br /><br />Large buildings on the West Cliff area near to the Royal Crescent built by the railway magnate Sir George Hudson, have been easily converted to hotels and in the last couple of decades have adapted to the en-suite requirement of many of todays visitors. In the Victorian days and those early decades of the 1990s, the bathroom facilities consisted of a washbowl and jug in the bedrooms with a small number of water closets shared between many bedrooms. Towards the latter end of the century, washbasins in the bedrooms  were more often than not the norm with a number of toilets shared between perhaps three or four rooms.  The twenty-first century, however, has seen the boundaries pushed even higher with full en-suite facilities a basic essential.
<br /><br />As more &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wonderfulwhitby.co.uk%2Fwonderfulwhitbyblog%2Fwhitby-accommodation-whitby-hotels-whitby-holiday-cottages-whitby-bs%2F%26quot%3B%26gt%3BWhitby"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.wonderfulwhitby.co.uk/wonderfulwhitbyblog/whitby-accommodation-whitby-hotels-whitby-holiday-cottages-whitby-bs/&quot;&gt;Whitby</a> Hotels&lt;/a&gt; are added to the increasing list available, so too has the high levels of expectation  increased with regard to services, décor and menu choices. Many of the hotels in Whitby are now offering ‘themed' accommodation in addition to their standard rooms.    A quick look on the internet will show a plethora of differing décor encompassing Gothic, Vintage, Victorian, Scottish, boudoir, boutique, ultra modern and romantic styles.
<br /><br />The English Tourist Board have certain criteria and standards across the board for the whole of England and this is reflected in the number of  stars credited to each particular establishment. Obviously, the higher the number of stars, the more luxurious and wide ranging  facilities  are available.   
<br /><br />Not only are the hotels situated on the West Cliff but a few are dotted around the town and a handful are a little way out of town but still easily accessible. Included in these are one or two higher bracket establishments dating from bygone ages and there is a project underway for a very exclusive hotel just out of town to cater for the higher earning bracket of potential visitor.  Extravagant perhaps but at least there is a choice across a full range of tariffs on offer.   
<br /><br />Whitby can boast that in relation to its size it is well able to offer a full range of accommodation and hotel choice available to welcome visitors into the twenty-first century.

This ancient seaside town renowned for its seafaring traditions and unique character is rising progressively in popularity over recent years.
<br /><br />This rise in tourism has somewhat shifted the pattern of the local shops to cater more and more with the increasing amount of vacationers.  Although, as one would certainly expect there are the ‘touristy' shops, there are an ever increasing quantity of the more upmarket establishments which in turn ensures that Whitby can offer almost anything to everyone.
<br /><br />The East side of Whitby has the reputation of being the ‘older' side of town due to its historical connections, and it has, over-all, more &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wonderfulwhitby.co.uk%2Fwheretoshop.html%26quot%3B%26gt%3BShops"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.wonderfulwhitby.co.uk/wheretoshop.html&quot;&gt;Shops</a> in Whitby&lt;/a&gt; dedicated to the sale of Whitby memorabilia, in particular, Whitby Jet.  This world renowned commodity is collected and carved in the local region which makes it  one of the oldest industries in Whitby.  All styles of Whitby jet and Whitby jet jewellery are on sale here as well as various other precious stones.  There are the traditional jewellers on this side, along with a number of shops selling costume and ‘fun' jewellery.  As one would be expecting, there are a selection of outlets dedicated to tourism, selling postcards, ornaments, bric a brac etc.  A wide range of clothing retailers give the opportunity to purchase the more traditional ladies clothing, gothic and punk outfits, designer label, outdoor pursuits and trendy young fashions.
<br /><br />There are a selection of cafes and restaurants, alongside the other retail businesses including book shops, a post office, gift shops selling a multitude of novelties and sculptures and some with a fascinating choice of fossils, quartz and other semi-precious stones. There is a  fishing tackle shop, a craft shop and model shop to cater for people that have various hobbies.  Wholefood and health food shops alongside sweet and rock shops make for an evenly balanced diet!!  Toy shops are a particular draw for the youngsters as too are the ice-cream retailers.  You will find, of course the more ordinary day to day shop varieties geared  more for the local population but all make for a large base for shopping for locals and visitors.
<br /><br />Whitby's West Side shops cater also for the vacation population with an intrinsic choice of gift shops and memorabilia, but these are interspersed with the necessities  of town life including banks and building societies.   Clothing shops and shoe shops abound on the main two parallel streets of Flowergate and Baxtergate also giving a range of apparel aimed at the young and not so young.   Towards the top end of Flowergate is Skinner Street, a lively street with cafes, restaurants, a chemist, health food and book shop.  Along here, as well as the other streets are the charity shops, which it can be said, cater to the holiday population as visitors like to browse and ‘bag a bargain'.  It is on this side of the river that the major food shopping is found, greengrocers and butchers and not forgetting, the delicious freshly baked cakes and pies filling the air with delicious aromas. A large supermarket with easy access car park for the bigger food shopping is located near to the Railway Station and a few stores through which to browse which seem to sell most things in the non-food line are more or less on the other side of the main road.
<br /><br />There are in all probability far too many &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wonderfulwhitby.co.uk%2Fwheretoshop.html%26quot%3B%26gt%3BShops"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.wonderfulwhitby.co.uk/wheretoshop.html&quot;&gt;Shops</a> in Whitby&lt;/a&gt; to list separately but it is safe to say that there are probably enough shopping outlets available to cater for most people's needs and most certainly those of the holidaymaker and visitor.

		<document id="74480dd45edc7982fb6848786a5cdf9d" url=""><![CDATA[The wonderful 3 day event of Whitby Regatta 2011<br/><br/>Whitby Regatta this year was a very unforgettable experience for plenty of people over the weekend of the 13th, 141th and 15th August 2011. The weather was very kind throughout and the sun shone wonderfully on the Regatta Monday.
<br /><br />This year was the 171st Whitby Regatta and it is one of the oldest regattas in this country.Primarily originating from the racing of local fishermen and their fishing boats, it has evolved into its current day format. This comprises not only  the amateur rowing teams but various things to do on the West Cliff and West Cliff beach alongside the fair on Whitby West Pier and the magnificent firework display, which brings the three day event to a close.
<br /><br />A team of volunteers, and the Whitby Regatta Committee, work exceptionally hard to organise  the events. Any contributions gathered from the public are used for events the following year.
<br /><br />This year large crowds all along the harbour and piers, cheered on the rowing races.  The teams of rowers comprising of girls, boys, ladies and men all of varying ages, are testament to the dedication of the rowing club's organisers' commitment to the youth of Whitby.
<br /><br />For the three day event on Whitby's  West Cliff there were numerous attractions ranging from the glamorous grandmothers competition and the beautiful baby contest to a motorbike and quad gymkhana on the beach. Beautiful vintage cars were on display alongside their proud owners on the grassy banks and on the opposite side of the road, tractors, motorbikes and scooters gleamed in the Royal Crescent Gardens, near the &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wonderfulwhitby.co.uk%2Fwonderfulwhitbyblog%2Fwhitby-accommodation-whitby-hotels-whitby-holiday-cottages-whitby-bs%2F%26quot%3B%26gt%3BWhitby"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.wonderfulwhitby.co.uk/wonderfulwhitbyblog/whitby-accommodation-whitby-hotels-whitby-holiday-cottages-whitby-bs/&quot;&gt;Whitby</a> Hotels&lt;/a&gt;.
<br />The army, navy and airforce ‘roadshows'  were there as in previous years. However this year, an obstacle course was provided free by the army, much to the delight of the youngsters (and those not so young). A dog show attracted a number of entrants and, keeping on the animal theme, there were birds of prey, owls and reptiles on display. Pig racing, was  a new novelty this year, viewed with much amusement by the crowds.
<br /><br />A mountain bike display, a fun-run, the annuual tug-of-war, bouncy castles, dodgems, pick-a-pen, trampolines, sweet stalls a ‘witch', punch and judy, face-painting and many more activities added to the atmosphere on the Whitby's West Cliff over the weekend.
<br /><br />In addition to the rowing races out to sea and in the harbour, there was the added amusement of the annual raft race. The lifeboat led the yachts into the harbour for the sailpast adding to the maritime feel.
<br /><br />Miss Regatta led the parade on Regatta Monday. This was followed closely by 16 men pulling the old lifeboat, the William Riley, (no mean feat when considering at one point the parade marched uphill on Khyber Pass). Two jazz bands marched with musical accompaniment, the glamorous granny winner rode in a pony and trap and a charabanc and minature steam train were all in the procession in addition to some original and colourful floats (mechanical and walking). The absolute stars of the parade were undoubtedly the fancy-dress entrants. In total there were 92 children in the parade in some stunning costumes which had obviously taken a great deal of time in the making. There were some truly original and comical characters displayed and it must have been extremely difficult for the judges to award the prizes.
<br /><br />The team of the Red Arrows thrilled and delighted the audience on the West Cliff.  Significant crowds waited in anticipation for the arrival of the nine Red Arrow acrobatic team in their traditional red hawk jets.  Although perhaps not the clearest of skies, the visual impact of the jets and their trademark coloured vapour trails held the crown in awe and suspense.  As they performed their acrobatic display there were audible cheers and applause making this one of the most memorable aspects of the regatta for many of the crowd.  Sadly, nearly a week later, one of the Red Arrow's team crashed in Dorset.  Our sympathies are with the family, friends and colleagues of the pilot involved.
<br /><br />The fair on Regatta Monday which stretched along Pier Road and to the end of Whitby West Pier was, as always, a mixture of rides, stalls, thrills and spills.  The crowds were milling around from dawn to dusk enjoying the ‘fun of the fair'.
<br /><br />The conclusion of the three day Whitby Regatta was the explosive firework display on Monday evening on the East Pier.  To the joy of the crowd they were treated to a impressive pyrotechnic event.  This year's display was particularly spellbinding and  a fitting finale to the 171st Whitby Regatta, a festival on land, sea and air.

		<document id="c96e365e3e64462ac03870bc55959875" url=""><![CDATA[On a holiday to Whitby, check out one of the towns extremely<br/><br/>Frequently mentioned in the national newspapers and highlighted in various television programmes, it has gone from strength to strength in the tourist stakes.   Although tourism has played a major role in the economy of the town since the Victorian era, it has only recently become favourable for the short breaks and the occasional weekend away in addition to the annual weekly holiday.  This could be partly due to the increase in accommodation available but also the availability of  a wider range of restaurants operating  throughout the year offering a high standard of cuisine.
<br /><br />International cuisine has made a further appearance with the recent opening of the Thai restaurant  to complement the already existing Chinese and Indian restaurants. Beautifully decorated in the traditional Asian style, with  a contemporary feel, these restaurants are very easy on the eye.
<br /><br />Continental cuisine is well represented in the form of a number of Italian &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wonderfulwhitby.co.uk%2Frestaurants.html%26quot%3B%26gt%3BWhitby"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.wonderfulwhitby.co.uk/restaurants.html&quot;&gt;Whitby</a> Restaurants &lt;/a&gt; catering to the locals and visitors alike.  As yet there are no individual French or Spanish but it is probably only a matter to time for them appear in the town. 
<br /><br />Traditional English restaurants have been well established in Whitby for some time.  Ever popular with the local population and well known to the regular visitor, they enjoy a good reputation and year round clientele.   At the present time they are busy advertising their establishments for the Festive season, i.e. Xmas parties and the Xmas Day lunch menu in the local press.  It seems that more and more families are opting out to have their Christmas day meals prepared, cooked and served to them.Obviously, of course, those on vacation will need the provision of meals at this festive time, but for the many full-time working mothers, it can be a real luxury for them. 
<br /><br />Whitby, traditionally known for its association with the fishing industry, has a number of Seafood Restaurants, who, in the past, were able to source their ingredients directly from the local catch by way of the local fish market.   Sadly, the decline in the economic viability of such an industry has meant the closure of the local fish market (hopefully to reopen at some point) with the result that much  of the fish and shellfish has to be purchased from other nearby ports. There is little difference in the quality of freshness, however, the local restaurants are as excellent as ever. 
<br /><br />As yet in the town, there is little evidence of a fast food &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wonderfulwhitby.co.uk%2Fwheretoeat.html%26quot%3B%26gt%3BPlaces"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.wonderfulwhitby.co.uk/wheretoeat.html&quot;&gt;Places</a> to Eat in Whitby&lt;/a&gt;, this may be perhaps that the town's size and location make it not suitably viable for the fast food chains.  It can be said that with the variety of all the other restaurants available, they are not particularly missed!
<br /><br />Whitby can boast some well-known restaurants which have featured in the media over the last few years.  Celebrity chefs from the new wave of reality television cookery programmes have visited various restaurants for promotion purposes advertising, perhaps, a particular food festival or indeed to showcase their culinary skills.   Whatever the event, this has not only showcased the event but also drawn attention to the wider public the scope of restaurants available and also the charm of the picturesque town of Whitby, giving viewers a snapshot of the area and perhaps encouraging them to visit.

Whitby, in the county of North Yorkshire is well able to satisfy that need with its amazing amount of quality café establishments around the town. 
<br /><br />The two main areas where the majority of the &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wonderfulwhitby.co.uk%2Fcafes.html%26quot%3B%26gt%3Bwhitby"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.wonderfulwhitby.co.uk/cafes.html&quot;&gt;whitby</a> cafes &lt;/a&gt; are to be found are on the East side area and the West side. As the town is divided by the River Esk as it makes its way out to the North Sea, there is Whitby's Old Swing Bridge which unites both sides.
<br /><br />The oldest part of the town is the East side with its cobbled streets and narrow gunnels.  The Abbey on the headland dates from the mid 600s AD.   The sense of history is apparent when walking along Church Street, Sandgate, Grape Lane and the Market Square.   Within each of these areas there are to be found &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wonderfulwhitby.co.uk%2Fwheretoeat.html%26quot%3B%26gt%3BPlaces"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.wonderfulwhitby.co.uk/wheretoeat.html&quot;&gt;Places</a> to Eat in Whitby&lt;/a&gt;  offering light refreshments and also substantial meals.   The numbers of such establishments have increased year on year offering quality beverages and food choices.  The styles of these cafes are varied in as much as alongside the traditional tea rooms there has been the introduction of the contemporary café offering the modern interior more commonplace in the larger towns and cities of this country. Such an increase  in new proprietors coming into the town, has ensured that competition is alive and well and thereby creates increased standards of establishments and also greater quality and choice of menus.
<br /><br />The West side of the town in comparison has the more modern amenities by way of the Bus and Railway Station  and the coach drop off point.  It is on this side that the coach parties stop for their passengers to alight and it is, therefore, this side of the river which caters to the 'bus trip' customers only too eager to avail themselves of the chance for a drink after their journey.  That is not to say that the quality of these cafes is any the less than the other establishments.
<br /><br />As to be expected in a seaside town of Whitby, there are an abundance of fish and chip shop cafes.  Not surprisingly, Whitby is synonymous with ‘cod and chips' as is evidenced by the number of blackboards proudly displaying such a menu. . It is not only the fish and chip shop cafes which offer such a menu, many of the other cafes offer this traditional dish in addition to their standard menu.   The Magpie café on Pier Road is a hugely successful café which has built its reputation on the quality of its fish dishes.    Whitby scampi too is a hugely popular dish served both in Whitby town but also the rest of Great Britain.   
<br /><br />Some of the latest additions to Whitby's list of cafes specialise in one particular food or another.  Milk shakes and smoothies are one particular choice, chocolate and chocolate fountains are another delight to tempt the taste-buds.  One or two cafes are dedicated to the ice-cream aficianado whilst others are dedicated to the humble sandwich.
<br /><br />In this day and age of economic uncertainty it is refreshing to note that the humble and not so humble cafes in Whitby are able to make a living from both the visitor and the local population the whole of the year round and not just in the expected holiday season.The local council has strict guidelines of cleanliness and hygiene for all food related establishments.  Reports are published in the local press and this ensures that standards are maintained across the board and is, indeed, a great incentive to proprietors to make sure that their premises are well maintained and meet the levels of cleanliness expected.

This years Boxing Day was uncommonly sunny and mild and the milder weather brought out a large number of spectators to witness the event. Nearby the bandstand, huge crowds gathered to watch to arrival of the participants, some in fancy dress, as they made their way down the slipway to the West Cliff Beach.
<br /><br />Everyone from Children to old age pensioners joined in, all with the aim of raising as much money as possible for the Whitby Lions who donate to many local charities. Most participants had individual sponsorship but the large crowd of onlookers were able to contribute and, in fact, the overall amount raised is said to be in excess of £780.00.
<br /><br />After lining up for the commencement of the Boxing day Dip 2011, the enthusiastic participants ran en masse down to seashore bravely defying the cool temperatures of the North Sea in their determination to raise funds for charity. Although shivering, there was clearly a good natured atmosphere amongst all of them and the crowd of approximately 3,000 watched intently as they splashed and even swam in the cool waters.
<br /><br />It was a long chilly walk back for the ‘dippers' as they made their way back from the sea shore. Nonetheless, theycould congratulate themselves on their achievement and be proud of their participation in the Boxing Day Dip, 2011.
<br /><br />John Freeman, the Whitby Mayor judged the Fancy Dress Costumes and it must be said that a great deal of thought and time had been taken with some of the costumes.  With such an number of differing outfits, it must have been extremely difficult to choose the winners. The winning childrens' entries were a reindeer and a christmas box, the men and ladies winners were an Elvis Impersonator and a Masked ballgown lady, whilst the team winners were the film ‘Cool runnings' bobsleigh team.
<br /><br />Well done and congratulations to all who took part in the Boxing Day Dip 2011. It was a memorable performance for all concerned most likely made a little more comfortable by the milder weather.

Although many are occupied by local residents, there are a number for rental as holiday accommodation.  This very old cobbled street has quite an interesting history.  Named after Henrietta Cholmley, it was formerly home to nearly a thousand inhabitants but in 1787 a large landslip saw a great many houses fall into the sea and a succession of further landslips has now seen the number of cottages decreased to present day numbers.  The seaward side of the street does have access to the golden sands of Tate Hill Beach from whence looking up towards St. Mary's Churchyard, the cottages are seen to be nestling into the Cliffside, the seagulls are more often than not swooping and screeching and on a fine day there are plenty of children playing in the sand. Nowadays though, the smoke has largely been replaced by smokeless fuels or gas or electricity.
<br /><br />Beautiful and quaint as they may be on Henrietta Street, they are not by any means the only holiday cottages for rental in Whitby.  The cobbled streets and flagstones of Church Street are also home to a large number of holiday cottages in the same quaint design.  Moving southwards from the bottom of the 199 steps along Church Street there are many narrow alleyways and yards many of which are home to some rather quaint and unusual holiday homes.   It was along these streets and alleyways that the local male population would evade the press gangs and custom men of the 1790's.  Today, however, a more peaceful atmosphere prevails.
<br /><br />As Church Street winds its way along to the bottom of Green Lane there can be found numerous holiday cottages.  In fact, the streets behind here leading uphill contain many cottages, the majority are homes to the local population but, of course, there are some for rental too.   When viewing from the other side of the river, it would appear that the buildings are perched one on top of another affording fabulous views of the harbour and fishing boats.  
<br /><br />The other side of the river in &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wonderfulwhitby.co.uk%26quot%3B%26gt%3BWhitby"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.wonderfulwhitby.co.uk&quot;&gt;Whitby</a> UK&lt;/a&gt;,  commonly known as the West Side has its fair share of holiday cottage accommodation, the familiar ‘fishermens' cottages  are to be found around the Swing Bridge area including Baxtergate and Flowergate and the alleyways and yards leading from there.  By observation of their situation it is possible to obtain an insight into the close community spirit that existed in the previous centuries.   Conveniently situated for all the amenities, close to the railway and bus stations together with the local shops and five minutes walk from the beaches these cosy cottages are perfect for a relaxing holiday. 
<br /><br />The term Whitby Cottages does not necessarily mean that they are, in fact, cottages.  The name covers a huge selection of varying types of buildings when viewed in the context of a holiday rental.  They may, in fact, be bungalows, houses, flats or apartments.   Sizes range from the small  buildings accommodating couples up to the larger establishments which can accommodate fifteen or sixteen individuals.  Many rental ‘cottages' are situated all around the town on both the East and the West side.
<br /><br />Although some of the 'cottages' are privately let, the majority are run via letting agencies who have strict codes of conduct and standards. Each one of the letting agency cottages are inspected and graded by the English Tourist Board or their representative ensuring that establishments are kept in good condition  and of a standard expected by the paying  visitor.

It really is a essential engineering science in  present-day world with regards to a number of things for example building structures and brand new inventions. In order to become a mechanical engineer, there are a number of &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mechanical-engineering-requirements.com%2F%26quot%3B%26gt%3BMechanical"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.mechanical-engineering-requirements.com/&quot;&gt;Mechanical</a> Engineering Requirements&lt;/a&gt;
<br /><br />The Way It Has Advanced
<br /><br />From the ancient Greek creation of the steam engine, to the old Chinese water clock, mechanical engineering can easily be found in a lot of historical places. Mechanical engineering reached the forefront of contemporary society throughout the Industrial Revolution and has a lot of practical applications nowadays.
<br /><br />Mechanical engineering has gone through some fantastic innovations in its progression. And, as mechanical engineering covers a fantastic deal of mechanical structures and gadgets, it is tough to keep an eye on the sheer volume of mechanical objects that can be found on earth currently. You'll find many topics covered in the broad spectrum of mechanical engineering for example kinematics. Mechanics is yet another area within the broader one.
<br /><br />Learning about physics in school helps you to comprehend mechanical engineering, even so, it is basically not hard to pick up the basic skills and information necessary to comprehend the subject.
<br /><br />Engines
<br /><br />The engine is a device, the most notable in mechanical engineering, and is one that uses heat energy to produce kinetic power. For example, the steam engine is the Very First main use of a form of engine in the developing world. Not just did this steam engine affect the way which we think about kinematics and mechanics, but it also helped us, as a society, to create lots of more objects off the back of its advancement.
<br /><br />Steam engines advanced travel on the whole and resulted in understanding all the ways engines might help with locomotion.
<br /><br />As a result of the steam engine's advancement, many more kinds of engines have been produced. The most notable engines in use currently, are those that use fuel, such as petroleum and diesel, to produce the heat needed to power the engine itself. The engine in a automobile or truck is a perfect example of a modern day engine.
<br /><br />Progress &amp; Moving Ahead
<br /><br />But engines aren't the only area mechanical engineering has helped progress. Mechanical engineering really is an incredibly broad subject. Mechanical engineering truly helps us grasp just how a lot of structures and devices operate and function.
<br /><br />As a result of the progression of contemporary mechanical engineering, such practices as kinematics, thermodynamics and robotics have all spawned into use into modern contemporary society.
<br /><br />Robotics
<br /><br />One of the more modern technological areas is robotics. Lots of individuals consider robotics as the application of mechanical engineering into robots which appear to be human beings or animals. Even so, numerous individuals also didn't recognise the fact which robotics really extends into far more practical applications, like robotics in machines and the production systems for companies. Quite a few companies rely on robotics for automation which keeps the company ready to go.
<br /><br />Creating a robot needs a working understanding of mechanics and circuitry. Electronic engineering is needed with the circuitry of the robot. Nevertheless, whenever all the physical, moving parts of the robots are being designed and put together into 1 machine, mechanical engineering plays a huge part in making certain it all goes efficiently. This makes mechanical engineering skills essential to robotics.
<br /><br />Looking In To The Foreseeable Future
<br /><br />Mechanical engineering has played an essential part of progression in almost every contemporary society found in the past. It has brought us everything from robotics to steam engines. But it can also help determine the future.
<br /><br />One area which shows genuine promise is nanotechnology. Both the electronic and physical world are will be greatly influenced by nanotechnology. Not just will nanotechnology open up doors to a far more varied future, with regards to physical applications and advancement, but it'll also enable mechanical engineering to grow and prosper together with the times.
<br /><br />Our world currently would simply not operate if it weren't for mechanical engineering.

After the jingling in the tills at Christmas time, the shops in Whitby are thinking about what the New Year will bring.  What will it bring by way of tourism, will the economic situation in this country and the rest of Europe make a difference to the spending power of the local population and the expectant tourist sector?

Year upon year as the seasons pass, there does, in fact, seem to be an increase in the variety and style of shops opening their doors for business.  As would be expected in a town which is considered to be a seaside holiday resort, there are a number of the tourist shops which are almost mandatory when considering that the town does actually rely on tourism for its economic survival.  Many of the 'touristy' shops are concentrated around the harbour area on both sides of the River.  Linking the two sides of Whitby, The East Side and The West Side, is the Old Whitby Swing Bridge which spans the River Esk.  The harbour was instrumental in years gone by for the livelihood of a large proportion of the workforce by way of whaling, fishing and boatbuilding. Over the last century this has gradually been eroded away.   There is still boatbuilding at the shipyard upriver but it is only one company and they are commissioned for new fishing vessels from Scotland and other parts of the United Kingdom as the fishing industry from &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wonderfulwhitby.co.uk%26quot%3B%26gt%3BWhitby"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.wonderfulwhitby.co.uk&quot;&gt;Whitby</a> UK&lt;/a&gt; is almost finished.  Whaling ceased many years ago!!  
<br /><br />The tourist shops fill a vital role in that of the sale of souvenirs and confectionery.  Visitors love to browse the stores in search of a memento of their stay or perhaps to pick up a little 'bargain' to take home or even to purchase something directly connected with the town, for instance Whitby Jet.   The jet mined from the local seams along the North East Coast, was made famous by Queen Victoria whilst in mourning for her beloved Prince Albert. Fashioned in both gold and silver, Whitby Jet Jewellery is renowned  for its quality throughout this country. 
<br /><br />The retailers now connected to tourism, are situated all around the town and, are, to a large extent, dependent on the local population to sustain their businesses.  Many Whitby folk, especially the older generation, have shopped for years in their hometown and rarely venture afield.   The younger generation, however, are happy to drive for twenty or thirty miles to do their weekly shopping or to buy other commodities such as clothing and furniture.  Visitors, throughout the year, are also supplementing the income for these business by the sale of newspapers and magazines, also the visitors in self serviced accommodation purchase food from the local supermarkets and other independent retailers such as fruiterers and bakers.

Currently the pharmacist can easily play a critical role in getting immediate help for problems involving modern medicine. They may also have to manage  scenarios  where individual sufferers have responded severely to a medication, even though numerous other patients will have used it with success. In order to become a pharmacist there are a number of &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.pharmacist-requirements.com%2F%26quot%3B%26gt%3BPharmacist"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.pharmacist-requirements.com/&quot;&gt;Pharmacist</a> Requirements&lt;/a&gt; that need to be met.
<br /><br />A pharmacist has 2 very diverse roles. The conventional role of dispensing medicines to the area as an independent business is the 1 role we are most acquainted with often times. The other form of pharmacist is the 1 who works in a healthcare facility. This is the role which is far more likely to need knowledge of the way to take care of emergency circumstances , as there are apt to be people in  conditions where treatment methods are needed quickly. No matter which position you're in as a pharmacist you need training and formal education along with a total understanding of medicines and just how they work.
<br /><br />Pharmacists in a hospital situation can make a important difference to the care an individual receives, which is why their job is often termed pharmaceutical care. They can help sufferers to stay on the medication and routine and they prevent mistakes involving prescribing medications. Whenever an individual takes medicine they have to take the proper kind for the length of time necessary for it to work properly. The pharmacist can also keep a closer watch on the side effects the patient might exhibit whilst they are receiving care, taking the pressure off physicians who are over-worked. 
<br /><br />With additional training there are also areas which can be a niche field in the area of pharmaceuticals. People who develop the highest knowledge of  medicines and the effect they can have can easily often be given advisory roles where they are in direct connection with people. These sufferers may be about to leave the medical facility after a long period of care, and will need very careful training on how to manage their drug therapies and things to look for to see if there are any negative effects. They can give advice regarding signs and symptoms of potential unwanted side effects.
<br /><br />Because pharmacists are highly trained operatives with the need for a serious knowledge of their topic, they have to have been properly trained in a formal setting. A college or university education is now absolutely essential for admission to this job, and this always entails a large sacrifice of time and cash. The pharmacy course itself lasts for four years, and to even be eligible for that you'll need to have completed undergraduate studies. In the past these courses were generally taken at a residential university but with technological developments which has evolved somewhat. For information about pharmacy school, visit &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.pharmacist-requirements.com%2Far%2Fpharmacist-school.php%26quot%3B%26gt%3BPharmacist"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.pharmacist-requirements.com/ar/pharmacist-school.php&quot;&gt;Pharmacist</a> School&lt;/a&gt;
<br /><br />Currently it's possible to obtain a degree by taking an on-line course. Lots of traditional colleges now provide this approach as well as schools dedicated only to online learning. This will permit you to continue earning in your present career whilst you study, and takes lots of the pressure off. Online study is different than classroom study so you need to be able to be disciplined enough to keep to the course. On-line support offered by the schools can help with this. Make sure you have a peaceful spot to study where you won't be sidetracked. The very qualities that make you a great prospect for a home study course are the ones that will benefit you in a career as a pharmacist.
