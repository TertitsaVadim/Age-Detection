<br />NO MORE PAIN OR FEAR FOR YOU

<br />IF YOU COME WITH YOUR HEAD HELD HIGH
<br />THE KINGDOM YOU WILL SEE

<br />THE PAIN KEEPS COMING BACK
<br />FEARSOM THINGS LIVE DOWN THERE 
<br />THE FORGOTTEN OR YET UNKNOWN
<br />EVIL THINGS VILE AND ROT
<br />WHERE EVER YOUR EYES ROAM
<br />TWISTED MEMORIES
<br />FORGOTTEN HURTS AND LIES SURROUND
<br />RUSHING TO THE FORFRONT

<br />WHERE OUR BROTHERS SEEM TO DIE
<br />70 THEY SAY IT’S OK 
<br />LOOK AT THE GOOD WE’VE DONE
<br />6 YEARS AND ON WITH NO END IN SIGHT 
<br />THERE STILL RUNNING THROUGH THE AFGAN BLIGHT
<br />THEY CHASE SHADOWS IN THE MOUNTAINS

<br />LET THEM DO THEIR JOB
<br />GO WHER EVER THEY NEED TO BE

<br />FOR YEARS AND YEARS TO COME
<br />THEY WILL KEEP ON COMING
<br />AS LONG AS WE ARE THERE
<br />IT’S NOT A WAR THAT’S GOING ON 
<br />IT’S A WAY OF LIFE WE HAVE TO FIGHT

YOU DON’T KNOW WHAT IT REALLY MEANS FROM THE SHADOWS I HIDE IN. RECOGNITION OF ANY KIND IS HARD TO TAKE. SO MOST OF THE TIME I TRY VERY HARD TO AVOID IT. BUT IN THE NAMELESS. FACELESS ARENA OF THE INTERNET
<br />(ALTHOUGH THE NAME AND FACE HERE ARE MINE) I’VE FOUND A VOICE FOR MY THOUGHTS. SOME HAVE SAID I SHOULD SEEK HELP, WELL I HAVE AND THE ANSWER I GOT WAS TO WRITE. PUT IT DOWN ON PAPER AND CLOSE THE BOOK. AND FOR A WHILE IT WILL LOSE ITS POWER, AND IT DOES. THANK YOU BOTH FOR YOUR ENCOURAGEMENT, KIND WORDS AND POSITIVE CRITICISM BUT ALSO FOR THE LESS THAN ENCOURAGING AND SOME WHAT HARSHER WORDS. ALL COMBINED HAVE HELPED ME FIND MY MENTAL VOICE. THE LESS POWER I GIVE THESE THOUGHTS THE MORE I AM ABLE TO COPE WITH THE DAY TO DAY ISSUES THAT COME UP. I KNOW MY POETRY IS NOT THE BEST, BUT IT IS HONEST. THESE ARE THE THOUGHTS I BATTLE CONSTANTLY. DAILY FROM ONE MOMENT TO THE NEXT. ONCE AGAIN THANK YOU I TRULY APPRECIATE IT.
