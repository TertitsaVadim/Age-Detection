<br /><br />A true crowd controller and compare, Switch is resident at Turbulence (Newcastle) and regularly performs across Europe and is now supporting Goldie (with Goldie's resident MC, Low Qui) and has a new residency at Therapy Sessions, Manchester. 
<br /><br />Having established his reputation through residencies at many of the seminal events across the Northwest (Sophonic Sessions, Metropolis, Spellbound, Gutterfunk, Rollin' Soundz) Switch has mastered the art of controling the crowd and complementing the beats. 
<br /><br />Having gained the respect of his fellow peers, Switch is currently working on music productions with the likes of Roughshod, Riley and Durrant (Ministry Of Sound / Galaxy FM), Mak and Octane and DJ Deval. 
<br /><br />&quot;Let the sounds take over your mind, your body and your soul&quot;

<br /><br />For all those who have been involved knowingly or unknowlingly, please read this... and maybe you will understand the truth and understand me (as a person) that little bit better.
<br /><br />If - Rudyard Kipling
<br /><br />If you can keep your head when all about you 
<br />Are losing theirs and blaming it on you; 
<br />If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you, 
<br />But make allowance for their doubting too; 
<br />If you can wait and not be tired by waiting, 
<br />Or, being lied about, don't deal in lies, 
<br />Or, being hated, don't give way to hating, 
<br />And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise; 
<br /><br />If you can dream - and not make dreams your master; 
<br />If you can think - and not make thoughts your aim; 
<br />If you can meet with triumph and disaster 
<br />And treat those two imposters just the same; 
<br />If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken 
<br />Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools, 
<br />Or watch the things you gave your life to broken, 
<br />And stoop and build 'em up with wornout tools; 
<br /><br />If you can make one heap of all your winnings 
<br />And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss, 
<br />And lose, and start again at your beginnings 
<br />And never breath a word about your loss; 
<br />If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew 
<br />To serve your turn long after they are gone, 
<br />And so hold on when there is nothing in you 
<br />Except the Will which says to them: &quot;Hold on&quot;; 
<br /><br />If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue, 
<br />Or walk with kings - nor lose the common touch; 
<br />If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you; 
<br />If all men count with you, but none too much; 
<br />If you can fill the unforgiving minute 
<br />With sixty seconds' worth of distance run - 
<br />Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it, 
<br />And - which is more - you'll be a Man my son!

<br />Well, it has taken a while to put together but the DnB mixtape Vol 1 is 'nearly' ready to drop. After the final session, I am waiting for the master and then it is straight to the copying house. It's not necessarily a Mixtape as it will be on CD and you will also be able to download it, but you know what I mean. Heres some blurb from the back cover:
<br />&quot;The DnB Mixtape Vol 1 represents more than just another DJ mix - It presents to you the past, the present and the future of Drum &amp; Bass music. Mixed by DJ Deval, this selection features over 30 timeless tracks... a true reflection of dancefloors across the globe! Shouts to everyone that has every helped or hindered the progress of the artists featured on this, the DnB Mixtape Vol 1.&quot;
