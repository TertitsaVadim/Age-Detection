It was an extra special wedding as I grew up with John &amp; Aimee so had to pull out all the stops!

I wanted to put as much bright colour in and incorporate pattern too. To achieve a vibrant eye catching style<br /><br />One of my favourite artists of today is Banksy so I added a small feature along his style, a little girl silhouette stencil with the red balloon.<br /><br />The mural is yet to be finished and doubt it ever will be as I am going to then keep adding to it with graffiti I think and extra multi media add on’s J<br /><br />‘It’s fun, bright and cheerful just what we all need on these dull gloomy days we’ve been having.’<br /><br />I photographed throughout Meg Hawkins Photography Studio Mural 2012<br /><br />Keep a look out for the extras when added…<br /><br />[url=]natural wedding photography[/url]

Well until coral pointed out my jewellery was missing, swarovski crystals seemed the perfect choice, Otazu earrings, bracelet and necklace were all carefully adorned, instantly picking  up the struggling sunshine through the threatening clouds, and the crowning glory a tiara loaded with more Swarovski bling, also from the fabulous Hayley J, Shrewsbury.<br /><br />Shoes were slipped onto my feet Hard hearted Harlet seemed the perfect choice to achieve a few extra inches, but also difficult to cross country run in when I heard Meg Hawkins shout on 3 RUN!<br /><br />And thus the shot was created<br /><br />Thank you to all involved Liz Bell Make up Meg Hawkins Creative director and Photographer, Coral Hawkins Assistant who made this happen<br /><br />Thea xx<br /><br />It was such a great day although Cold we all shivered through and the sun broke through<br /><br />More to come soon…..<br /><br />[url=]natural wedding photography[/url]

The style of wedding photography depends on the type of photographer your wedding photographer is. Is he someone who visualizes through his camera in the traditional way or someone who does creative shots. There is a growing movement  towards an unobtrusive method of catching moments of the wedding day which is more natural in its approach. It captures the wedding day as it unfolds. There will be less of the usual gathering of the couple and guests to pose for photographs. The photographer is almost invisible to the family and friends and simply capture the moments as they happen.<br /><br />This style of wedding photography creates a narrative and more natural style, each photograph will help tell a comprehensive story of your wedding day. It starts with how the bride prepares for her special day, and ends with the party that comes after. The whole idea of documentary wedding photography is to capture moments in a chronological order as it happens during your wedding day. The photographer keeps an eye on everything that happens and try to capture the defining moments of the wedding. The duty of the wedding photographer is to produce photographs that will remain special for both the groom and the bride as they will recreate their wedding day through pictures.<br /><br />What is exceptional with this style of wedding photography, is that the day can commence without any disturbance usually caused by people having to pose for pictures. The groom and bride can focus on what really matters on their wedding day which is to show their love for each other.<br /><br />This style of natural wedding photography creates a story which will unfold as the day progresses. All the pictures will help recreate the wedding day as it happened and hopefully will tell a good story. Remember your wedding is a special day. Details such as how the food tasted, how the cake looked, how the guests enjoyed the party pale in comparison to how the wedding photographs will turn out, not only should it be good but exceptional. After all once the day is over, it is the photographs that will remind you how special was your wedding day.<br /><br />When you are ready to decide on who will be your wedding photographer, here are some tips that will help you decide who to hire as your wedding photographer. You should get someone who is the best in his craft, someone who can deliver the best photographs and also someone who can offer different wedding photography packages. It is also important to hire someone who is adept in handling the technicalities behind good wedding photography. If for example you are living in a place where there is a grand amount of natural light, make sure you hire a photographer who knows how to manage different lighting conditions.<br /><br />Ask for samples of the photographer's work. Remember the saying &quot;A picture is worth a thousand words&quot;, the photographer's work will speak for itself. By their work you can judge if he is the right &lt;a target=&quot;_new&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot; href=&quot;]natural wedding photographer[/url] for you. Ask for honest feedback from couples who have worked with this photographer. Lastly ask about the wedding packages your wedding photographer offers. In the end you may want to get all the photos taken. There may be photos that you would feel a personal connection to regardless what the wedding photographer may think about it. Remember your wedding day is personal and sometimes no matter how some photos may lack in artistic value in the eyes of the wedding photographer they may be the very photographs that will remind you how special your wedding day was and without them will not complete your wedding story.<br /><br />[url=]natural wedding photography[/url]

I first met Rob and Lou’s through a mutual friend who  I did her post wedding shots , she mention that her friends were getting married and were having a Glastonbury themed wedding, wow I said that would be amazing all the colour and festival feeling. As I was not disappointed, Rob &amp; Lou booked me almost instantly thanks to the lovely comments Sabrina gave me.<br /><br />I think you’ll agree the images speak for themselves on how much fun and laughter was created form the day.<br /><br />I asked Lou’s if she would give us some background on how they met as I thought it was lovely and makes there wedding so brilliantly romantic!<br /><br />Photography by Meg Hawkins<br /><br /><a href="/go/messages/send/receiver=me@meghawkins.co.uk">me@meghawkins.co.uk</a><br /><br />01746 787 153<br /><br />07811  672 460<br /><br />Lou &amp; Rob Glastonbury Wedding<br /><br />‘Our eyes met across the crowded field, our hearts stopped and from that moment we were inseparable…. Well that’s how I like to think that Rob and I met at Glastonbury 2004, but it couldn’t be further from the truth. He staggered into our campsite with a crate of Carlsberg over his head shouting “milky milky” at the top of his voice and proceeded to put up his tent. Inside out. Maybe not the most auspicious of starts…<br /><br />At the Soulmates speed dating tent the next day it seemed that the stars were still plotting against us. Rob was matched up with nobody and I was matched up with… his best friend. After deciding that Dave and I had nothing more in common than our mutual love of Morrissey I ditched him and hoped that Rob was still inside on his lonesome. (Dave wasn’t too bitter; he did end up as our Best Man.)<br /><br />As luck would have it Rob was still alone and from then on we were pretty much inseparable (apart from my day long stint at the front of the Pyramid Stage waiting for Morrissey.)  I even said that if Rob and I did get together it wouldn’t just be for a short fling, but even I didn’t expect us to be walking up the aisle seven years later.<br /><br />As we met at Glastonbury it seemed fitting to incorporate as many festival elements as we could into our day. We both wanted a traditional church wedding so it was at our reception that our ideas really came to life (although I did walk down the aisle in a pair of custom made Converse…)! 130m of homemade bunting; 120 VIP lanyards; 150 cotton shopping bags (made by the same company that make the Glastonbury bags); 20 hand painted Wellington boot centre pieces (complete with Glastonbury stage names) and 90 mini campervans later and we’d created the festival atmosphere we were after.<br /><br />We rocked up to our reception at The Bear Inn and Hotel in the Peak District in a beautifully restored 1968 split screen VW campervan. Half way to the reception we also stopped off for an amazing private photo-shoot with our photographer Meg Hawkins where we got some of the most special pictures of our day. Throw in an extra shoot for myself and my bridesmaids bedecked in wellies and we couldn’t have asked for more. Our cake, made by Lady Jayne’s Cakes was a tower of cupcakes that included a bespoke Glastonboozy cider flavour that went down a treat with our guests. So much so that Rob and I didn’t get any! Our band (The Flange) covered songs from our favourite bands and artists and the dance floor resembled the front of the Pyramid Stage for the entire night.<br /><br />The day totally exceeded our expectations.  We have never laughed and smiled so much and the same could be said for all our guests too. At Glastonbury 2004 a band I’d never heard of (and haven’t heard of since) called the Ralph Myerz and the Jack Herren Band told us to “Put your hands in the air and something special happens!” On 30th July 2011 we did put our hands in the air. And something special truly happened. ‘<br /><br />And that’s that pure Joy!<br /><br />Meg<br /><br /><a href="http:///blog/here-comes-glastonbury-well-rob-lous-version/" target="_blank">themed wedding photographers</a>

I first met Rob and Lou’s through a mutual friend who  I did her post wedding shots , she mention that her friends were getting married and were having a Glastonbury themed wedding, wow I said that would be amazing all the colour and festival feeling. As I was not disappointed, Rob &amp;amp; Lou booked me almost instantly thanks to the lovely comments Sabrina gave me.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;]I think you’ll agree the images speak for themselves on how much fun and laughter was created form the day.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;]I asked Lou’s if she would give us some background on how they met as I thought it was lovely and makes there wedding so brilliantly romantic!&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;]<strong>Photography by Meg Hawkins </strong>&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;][url=]<strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.meghawkins.co.uk"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.meghawkins.co.uk</a></strong>[/url]<strong></strong>&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;][url=mailto:<a href="/go/messages/send/receiver=me@meghawkins.co.uk">me@meghawkins.co.uk</a>]<strong><a href="/go/messages/send/receiver=me@meghawkins.co.uk">me@meghawkins.co.uk</a></strong>[/url]<strong></strong>&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;]<strong>01746 787 153 </strong>&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;]<strong>07811  672 460</strong>&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;]Lou &amp;amp; Rob Glastonbury Wedding&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;]‘Our eyes met across the crowded field, our hearts stopped and from that moment we were inseparable…. Well that’s how I like to think that Rob and I met at Glastonbury 2004, but it couldn’t be further from the truth. He staggered into our campsite with a crate of Carlsberg over his head shouting “milky milky” at the top of his voice and proceeded to put up his tent. Inside out. Maybe not the most auspicious of starts…&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;]At the Soulmates speed dating tent the next day it seemed that the stars were still plotting against us. Rob was matched up with nobody and I was matched up with… his best friend. After deciding that Dave and I had nothing more in common than our mutual love of Morrissey I ditched him and hoped that Rob was still inside on his lonesome. (Dave wasn’t too bitter; he did end up as our Best Man.)&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;]As luck would have it Rob was still alone and from then on we were pretty much inseparable (apart from my day long stint at the front of the Pyramid Stage waiting for Morrissey.)  I even said that if Rob and I did get together it wouldn’t just be for a short fling, but even I didn’t expect us to be walking up the aisle seven years later.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;]As we met at Glastonbury it seemed fitting to incorporate as many festival elements as we could into our day. We both wanted a traditional church wedding so it was at our reception that our ideas really came to life (although I did walk down the aisle in a pair of custom made Converse…)! 130m of homemade bunting; 120 VIP lanyards; 150 cotton shopping bags (made by the same company that make the Glastonbury bags); 20 hand painted Wellington boot centre pieces (complete with Glastonbury stage names) and 90 mini campervans later and we’d created the festival atmosphere we were after.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;]We rocked up to our reception at The Bear Inn and Hotel in the Peak District in a beautifully restored 1968 split screen VW campervan. Half way to the reception we also stopped off for an amazing private photo-shoot with our photographer Meg Hawkins where we got some of the most special pictures of our day. Throw in an extra shoot for myself and my bridesmaids bedecked in wellies and we couldn’t have asked for more. Our cake, made by Lady Jayne’s Cakes was a tower of cupcakes that included a bespoke Glastonboozy cider flavour that went down a treat with our guests. So much so that Rob and I didn’t get any! Our band (The Flange) covered songs from our favourite bands and artists and the dance floor resembled the front of the Pyramid Stage for the entire night.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;]The day totally exceeded our expectations.  We have never laughed and smiled so much and the same could be said for all our guests too. At Glastonbury 2004 a band I’d never heard of (and haven’t heard of since) called the Ralph Myerz and the Jack Herren Band told us to “Put your hands in the air and something special happens!” On 30&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; July 2011 we did put our hands in the air. And something special truly happened. ‘&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;]And that’s that pure Joy!&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;]Meg&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;]&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-1484&quot; title=&quot;Meg Hawkins Photography1&quot; src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;1304&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;]&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-1485&quot; title=&quot;Meg Hawkins Photography2&quot; src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/2a.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;1828&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;]&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-1486&quot; title=&quot;Meg Hawkins Photography 3&quot; src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;1098&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;]&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-1487&quot; title=&quot;Meg Hawkins Photography4&quot; src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;1240&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;]&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-1488&quot; title=&quot;Meg Hawkins Photography5&quot; src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;1547&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;]&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-1489&quot; title=&quot;Meg Hawkins Photography6&quot; src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/6.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;1178&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;]&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-1490&quot; title=&quot;Meg Hawkins Photography7&quot; src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/7.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;1111&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;]&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-1491&quot; title=&quot;Meg Hawkins Photography8&quot; src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/8.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;]&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-1492&quot; title=&quot;9Meg Hawkins Photography&quot; src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/9.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;1165&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;]&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-1493&quot; title=&quot;Meg Hawkins Photography10&quot; src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/10.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;846&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;]&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-1494&quot; title=&quot;Meg Hawkins Photography11&quot; src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/11.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;1310&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;]&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-1495&quot; title=&quot;Meg Hawkins Photography12&quot; src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/12.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;1816&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;]&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-1496&quot; title=&quot;Meg Hawkins Photography14&quot; src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;1178&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;<br /><br /><a href="/blog/here-comes-glastonbury-well-rob-lous-version/" target="_blank">themed wedding photography</a>
