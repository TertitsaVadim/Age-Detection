<br />When I write you another love letter,
<br />I let out my cries,
<br />Never saying our goodbyes,
<br />Then slip it in the pocket of your sweater.
<br /><br />I tell you my fears,
<br />That bring me salted tears,
<br />I wipe the pressure away,
<br />In this short essay,
<br />As bliss forms and reappears.
<br /><br />As the pencil rapidly flows,
<br />I try to explain and compose,
<br />The way I feel,
<br />Is too good to be real,
<br />Better than a red red rose.
<br /><br />Telling you my dreams,
<br />Letting out all my screams,
<br />Showing you I care,
<br />And this relationship can go somewhere,
<br />Is filling the sky with god?s gleams.
<br /><br />You do something to me,
<br />You let me fly and set me free,
<br />Your simple touch,
<br />Is way too much,
<br />For even god to see.
<br /><br />I keep on writing like before,
<br />But this time it?s so much more,
<br />About your eyes that makes me melt,
<br />It?s something that I?ve never felt,
<br />It?s your soul I deeply implore.
<br /><br />I will stand by you,
<br />Until the earth?s core turns a pale blue,
<br />I?ll indicate the love I share,
<br />Make it unable for anyone to compare,
<br />And keep the hope I have, true.
<br /><br />Times that hurt and make you mad,
<br />I?ll cheer you up to make you glad,
<br />I?ll offer you my support,
<br />I?ll even give you the news report,
<br />And remind you of the times we?ve had.
<br /><br />Believe in me for I?m the one,
<br />That shows you how to have some fun,
<br />My quest to write this simple letter,
<br />Can make things for us so much better,
<br />Now our life together has just begun.

On the way there we began freaking people out and making crazy gestures which kept retarded people away <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/4210//smilies/tongue.gif" alt=":)" />. Smoking a few cigs on the way, half asleep we walked until the cops came and asked for our IDs and we had no IDs! so we juss ran for it like bitches lmao <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/4210//smilies/wacko.gif" alt=":)" /> , one hellava night up till now lol <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/4210//smilies/w00t.gif" alt=":)" />. 
<br /><br />Later Malek came up with this idea that one of us should wrap the bandage Zaid had on his head all around his face to make people thing we're some sort of gang, and the guys kept running towards random people making them freak the fuck out! 
<br /><br />eventually we got to a pack of indian cleaners lol, but this time I had bandages all over my face, fucking freaky...we ran up to the pack and the indians were so scared! they kept stuttering, and i kept freakin them out...ill upload the pictures later, seriously this is a day we wont forget anytime soon

<br />But one date and a kiss on the cheek lit our flame.
<br />Once only friends, we showed no care,
<br />We were looking for someone, who was always there.
<br /><br />If i could I'd whisk you away to a far off land,
<br />We'd go to the beach and make love in the warmth of the sand.
<br />If I could I'd give you the heavens above,
<br />We would shine the light of the world with our love.
<br /><br />As the days go by, I am only complete with your kiss,
<br />Should we part, the beauty you give my world I would miss
<br />So light up my life with your smile and your laugh,
<br />Tell me this is real and it will forever last.

Shit, if I built an elevator, every wall (and the doors) would be huge skull-and-crossbones signs warning people that these elevators were superfast and efficient. Limbs might be lost but I guarantee you would make your meeting on time. 
<br /><br />People whose hatreds are really prosaic, like &quot;I hate SUVs.&quot; When I interview people for stuff, I sometimes ask &quot;what are things that annoy you?&quot; Some people get so excited and proceed to rant about stuff, and you can imagine the fine talks we have. But other people are so boring like, &quot;Oh I dunno...I try not to be negative...maybe popup ads.&quot; WOW THANKS
<br /><br />One of the most irritating types of people are people who are always SKEPTICAL. 
<br /><br />You: &quot;Hey, we should go out to this restaurant. It's really good&quot;
<br />Them: &quot;Realllllly? Are you sure? I mean, it doesn't sound that good&quot;
<br /><br />You: &quot;Hey, do you want to meet this girl? I think you'd like her&quot;
<br />Them: &quot;I mean, really? What? Why? What does she do? What does she look like? Is she the most amazing woman on the planet with exactly my physical, psychological, and spiritual requirements? If not....I mean...are you sure?&quot;
<br /><br />You: &quot;Hey, cool quote. Did you know that it originally came from Sophocles?&quot;
<br />Them: &quot;I don't think so&quot;
<br />You: &quot;I STUDIED THIS FOR 10 YEARS IN GRADUATE SCHOOL--I'M PRETTY SURE I KNOW&quot;
<br />Them: &quot;I still, just, I don't think so!&quot;
<br /><br />WHERE IS MY CANE TO BEAT THESE PEOPLE WITH
<br /><br />Along the same lines of moronic skeptical people, I once was at a group interview and met this guy from University of Arizona. We introduced ourselves to each other and he asked where I went, so I told him, and he immediately had this huge chip on his shoulder. WTF? I didn't say anything against him, but ok, I just dealt with it. He was saying things like &quot;Well, I hear it's overrated. I mean, the athletics are pretty good but I hear the East coast schools are better.&quot; I'm thinking, ok, thank you sir for your insightful comments, but I just let them go. THEN he asks me (very competitively and antagonistically) what I study at school, so I told him technology and psychology. 
<br /><br />This idiot wrinkles his nose like he just ate 4-month-old tomatoes and says &quot;TECHNOLOGY AND PSYCHOLOGY? What is THAT?!&quot; Can I please take a small break to say that just because you haven't encountered something before does not automatically disqualify it from being credible. GOD I WISH I HAD SAID EXACTLY THAT TO THIS GUY. Anyway, I tried to explain a little, very comfortable in my knowledge that this person was a moron for questioning something he knew NOTHING ABOUT YET I HAD STUDIED FOR A LONG TIME. I love his ending, though: &quot;Well, I guess you can study that...but I really wonder where it will get you.&quot; Remember, we had just met 3 minutes before this! I really appreciated his life advice.
<br /><br />When companies advertise that you could &quot;Save up to 25% or more!!&quot; Oh, ok, so basically you're telling me that I can save anywhere between 0 and infinity. Thank you

Yes, yes I did. IT'S JUST A COMPARISON. TAKE THE MAIN POINT AND MOVE ON
<br /><br />Rappers who hit me with so much of the same thing (saying &quot;hit me&quot; sounds cool, huh):
<br /><br />Male rappers: &quot;I have hos, cristal, and thongs dropping all over the place&quot;
<br />Female rappers: &quot;Your girl can't do it like i can, I'm so hot i reject guys left and right, don't you want me&quot;
<br /><br />Frankly, my hip-hop brethren, these claims are so tired and old that when I hear them, I just want to take a nap in a rocking chair with a piece of straw in my mouth. Please. Give me something new. Tell me your business plan. Tell me your favorite breakfast restaurant. Tell me something!!!!
<br /><br />Video games because they're not fun any more. Ooh, MPGs!! Ooh FPS games!! Wow, I can spend 4893895231952 hours trying to figure out how to open this door! Please give me a god damned break and let me jump on some turtles' heads. The last fun game: Super Mario Kart on SNES
<br /><br />CALTRAIN I HATE YOU SO MUCH. What kind of POS transportation system has the most CONFUSING schedule on earth, a web page that obfuscates its own times, and trains that sporadically don't run at normal hourly times? Now I am an educated man, but one look at their schedule here made me question the dozens of years I have spent and thousands of dollars I have spent learning how to read. Is this a personal story? MAYBE LIKE LAST THURSDAY NIGHT WHEN I WAS STUCK IN SF THANKS TO THIS HORRIFICALLY POORLY RUN SERVICE
<br /><br />When you go to a restaurant and try to pour the crushed red pepper on your pizza, only the stupid bottle doesn't pour more than one flake out at a time. This means that I have to spend about 15 minutes furiously pouring the red pepper, while burning about 72,000 calories. I sincerely wish there was a dump truck full of crushed red pepper that unloaded its glorious cargo whenever I snapped my fingers. It's these moderate dreams that get me through the day.
<br /><br />Bagels. I don't how stupid Americans started liking bagels in the late 90s, but allow me to mock you and condemn the ABSURD ACT OF EATING PLAIN BREAD WITH NO TOPPING OR TOASTING. My favorite bagels are the 12-for-$2 bagels that you get in the grocery store--the ones you actually TOAST and put cream cheese on. Yet unbelievable amounts of people will go order plain bagels (or sesame, or whatever) and just EAT THEM PLAIN!!!!! Perhaps I'm blowing this out of proportion but I can't remember ever seeing someone walk into a Safeway, buy a loaf of bread, then casually eat it while walking around on the street, hands in pockets, whistling, all the while moaning in pleasure for how &quot;mmmmmm good&quot; it is. I hate you, bagels.
<br /><br />Registrars. What is it that draws the meanest, most anti-social people to this position--at any school? Or perhaps the position actually creates disgruntled, socially awkward people. Whatever the case, I will welcome the day when this job is offshored or computerized.
<br /><br />Puzzles, Sudoku, and any other &quot;games&quot; that are not fun
<br /><br />Waiters who ask, &quot;Would you like to hear our specials?&quot; and then proceed to list about 62 DIFFERENT SPECIALS WITHOUT STOPPING TO SEE IF WE CARE ANYMORE. How many times have you been at a table when this horrific monologue started, and you and your friends are just looking at each other embarrassedly? &quot;Please stop,&quot; I whimper to myself. &quot;Please stop.&quot; If I were a waiter and I saw 4 of my customers looking down at the table, inspecting the nearest fleck of microscopic dust, and slowly reaching for a screwdriver with which to kill themselves--aka NOBODY WAS LISTENING TO ME--I would probably stop, leave, and send free drinks for everyone to atone for my mortal error. Quick tip: If it looks like someone is going through the pain of giving birth while listening to you, you can safely assume TO STOP TALKING RIGHT NOW.
<br /><br />That stupid Josh Groban song, &quot;You Raised Me Up,&quot; which every aspiring singer on TV apparently must try to reproduce. This is like me trying out for a cooking show and making an entire meal around Spam. Why not at least pick something good to copy?
<br /><br />People who go on Elimidate and then get sanctimonious about others' behavior. IT'S ELIMIDATE, NOT TRAINING FOR A NUNNERY. Girls will be like, &quot;Ugh (rolling eyes), I can't believe she did that. That slut!&quot; Dude, she's here to win and you are here to gain other female approval. Stop wasting my time. My favorite time was when an Indian girl went on Elimidate (&quot;Indian girl&quot; and &quot;Elimidate&quot; have never been uttered together before) and was the most prudish of all...of course. WHY DID SHE GO ON!? And the best part was that she said, &quot;My parents and grandparents will be watching this.&quot; This is exactly the same reason why I would never go on TV to play in the World Series, NBA finals, Superbowl, or any other athletic event.
<br /><br />Anachronistic ad agencies. I will short you all
<br /><br />When you get into bed and are all comfortable, but then realize you're on TOP of the sheet, so you have to get up and readjust yourself. This is so nitpicky that it's a surprise I haven't had a heart attack yet.
<br /><br />The moronic tendency of people to pre-judge a jury verdict before it comes out. &quot;Oh, I know OJ is guilty,&quot; many people said, to which I replied: Are you out of your god damned mind? How on earth do people purport to know (1) whether someone really did it and (2) what a jury will say when (a) THEY ARE NOT IN THE TRIAL, (<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/4210//smilies/cool.gif" alt=":)" /> THEY DIDN'T WATCH ANY OF THE TRIAL, and (c) EVEN IF YOU DID YOU STILL COULDN'T PREDICT IT WITH CERTAINTY. Yet these people will nod reassuringly and essentially pat themselves on the back, &quot;knowing&quot; that they know the right outcome. Will they ever be held accountable? No. Will they ignore disconfirming evidence if they're wrong? Yes.
<br /><br />People who get overly serious about recycling stuff:
<br />Me: &quot;Hey, where's the garbage can?&quot; (Btw this is at a party where everyone is having fun)
<br />Friend: &quot;Oh, it's right over there.&quot;
<br />Me: (Walks over to throw my coke can away)
<br />Friend: PHYSICALLY STOPS ME AND LOOKS OUTRAGED. &quot;Aren't you going to recycle?&quot; he says in the same tone as if he'd found a body in the trunk of my car
<br />Me: (Stares at friend, blinks)
<br /><br />Props to my brother for suggesting this one. Now, I'm all for saving the environment when it takes a few minutes of my time, but perhaps we can stop the global war on putting ONE COKE CAN IN THE GARBAGE CAN.

It means that we know no one is perfect including ourselves so we look beyond someones imperfections and concentrate on their perfections and our happiest shines thru. As long as one's HEART is in the right place and is perfect for your liking then everything else that is near perfect or perfect about them is a bonus and everything else .. secondary, they don't matter. Always be happy and stay blessed .. don't find perfection ... stay happy and stay blessed Keep smiling.</strong>

<br /><br />I gazed in your eyes,
<br />Such a beautiful blue;
<br />My heart whispered to me,
<br />And that’s right when I knew;
<br />The waves had ceased crashing,
<br />On the sand at our feet;
<br />Time had stopped passing,
<br />My search was complete;
<br />I finally discovered,
<br />What I'd known all along;
<br />A mystery uncovered,
<br />That just couldn't be wrong;
<br />It wasn't our first kiss,
<br />Nor' the day that we met;
<br />But I realized something,
<br />I will never forget;
<br />With the stars shining brightly,
<br />From high up above;
<br />I'd one word to describe it,
<br />That word, is love.
<br />I knew then these feelings,
<br />For my sweetheart were true;
<br />The man of my dreams,
<br />And my soulmate, is you.
<br />I think of it every time,
<br />That I look at the stars;
<br />This memory is mine,
<br />But that moment was
<br />OURS. 
<br />My gift for my love, Casandra

Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness, that most frightens us. Your playing small does not serve the world. There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure around you. We are all meant to shine as children do. It's not just in some of us; it is in everyone. And as we let our own lights shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others. 
<br /><br />Some times we never notice that watching any movie or dramma or character or person can give us inspirational thoughts in words and they usually do .. You can find good in any thing.

<br />this isolation that I am
<br />I can only look to me

<br />this confusion, constant
<br />hunger for something more than this
<br />I strive to find this being
<br />that I envision, yet seem to miss.
<br />Could it be that I am empty-
<br />or maybe a little lost?
<br />Could it be that I am lonely,
<br />or seek happiness at any cost?
<br />This never-ending Something
<br />that I am living deep inside,
<br />depicts the illusion of myself
<br />and all I have to hide.
