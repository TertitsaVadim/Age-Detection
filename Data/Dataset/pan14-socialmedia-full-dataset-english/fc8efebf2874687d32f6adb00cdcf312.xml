<br />OK here's the rules of Adoption.... ;
<br />If your a guy u must pick a girl, if your a girl u must pick a guy.
<br />Put in the subject &quot;I'm up for adoption&quot; and see who wants to adopt you.
<br /><br />The first person to send u a message saying &quot;I adopted you&quot; owns you.=]
<br />It's that simple...
<br /><br />P.S. re-post cause it is funny and surprising to see who gets you first

<br />--Guys hate sluts even though they have sex with them!
<br />(oh yeah..you're not &quot;popular&quot; if you've slept with more than 5 guys. you’re a HOE!!!)
<br /><br />--&quot;Hey, are you busy?&quot; or &quot;Are you doing something?&quot; ~ two phrases guys open with to stop from stammering on the phone.
<br /><br />--Guys may be flirting around all day but before they go to sleep, they always think about the girl they truly care about.
<br /><br />--Before they call, guys try to plan out a little about what they're gonna say so there aren't awkward pauses, but once he's on the phone he forgets it all and makes it up as he goes.
<br /><br />--Guys go crazy over a girl's smile.
<br /><br />--Guys will do anything just to get you to notice him.
<br /><br />--Guys hate it when you talk about your ex-boyfriend or ex love-interest. Unless they're goin for the let-her-complain-to-you-and-then-have-her-realize-- - - - - how-wonderful-and-nice-you-a remethod
<br /><br />--A guy who likes you wants to be the only guy you talk to.
<br /><br />--Boyfriends need to be reassured often that they're still loved.
<br /><br />--Don't talk about your guy friends to your boyfriend.
<br /><br />--Guys get jealous easily.
<br /><br />--Guys are more emotional than they'd like people to think.
<br /><br />--Giving a guy a hanging message like &quot;You know what?!..uh...nevermind..&quot; would make him jump to a conclusion that is far from what you are thinking. And he'll assume he did something wrong and he'll obsess about it trying to figure it out.
<br /><br />--Guys are good flatterers when courting but they usually stammer when they talk to a girl they really like.
<br /><br />--Guys hate asking parents for money to buy girls presents. So they come up with ideas like saving their lunch money for a week. But it never works because guys are always hungry so they end up asking the parents for money anyway.
<br /><br />--Girls are guys' weaknesses.
<br /><br />--Guys are very open about themselves.
<br /><br />--It's good to test a guy first before you trust him. But don't let him wait too long.
<br /><br />--Your best friend, whom your boyfriend seeks help from about his problems with you may end up being admired by your boyfriend.
<br /><br />--If a guy tells you about his problems, he just needs someone to listen to him. You don't need to give advice.
<br /><br />--A usual act that proves that the guy likes you is when he teases you.
<br /><br />--Guys love you more than you love them if they are serious in your relationships.
<br /><br />--Guys will brag about anything.
<br /><br />--Guys use words like hot or cute to describe girls. We rarely use beautiful. If a guy uses that, he likes you a whole hell of a lot.
<br /><br />--Guys think WAY too much. One small thing a girl does, even if she doesn't notice it can make the guy think about it for hours, trying to figure out what it meant.
<br /><br />--Guys seek for advice from girls not other guys. Because most guys think alike, so if one guy's confused, then we're all confused.
<br /><br />--Any guy could write out a rulebook or advice book for flirting, but no guy can write out a book about relationships.
<br /><br />--Try to be as straightforward as possible.
<br /><br />--A guy has to experience rejection, because if he's too-good-never-been-busted, never been in love and hurt, he won't be mature and grown up.
<br /><br />--If the guy does something stupid in front of the girl, he will think about it for the next couple days or until the next time he spends time with the girl.
<br /><br />--No matter how much guys talk about asses and boobs, personality is key.
<br /><br />--Guys learn from experience not from the romance books that girls read and take as their basis of experience.
<br /><br />--Guys worry about the thin line between being compassionate and being whipped.
<br /><br />--If a guy looks unusually calm and laid back, he's probably faking it and is spazzing inside.
<br /><br />--When a guy says he is going crazy about the girl, he really is. Guys rarely say that.
<br /><br />--When a guy asks you to leave him alone, he's just actually saying, &quot;Please come and listen to me.&quot;
<br /><br />--Guys don't really have final decisions.
<br /><br />--If a guy starts to talk seriously, listen to him. It doesn't happen that often, so when it does, you know something's up.
<br /><br />--If your best guy friend seems to avoid you or is never around when you're with your boyfriend, he's probably jealous and likes you.
<br /><br />--When a guy tells you that you are beautiful, don't say you aren't. It makes them want to stop telling you because they don't want you to disagree with them.
<br /><br />--When a guy looks at you for longer than a second, he's definitely thinking something.
<br /><br />--Guys like femininity not feebleness.
<br /><br />--Guys don't like girls who punch harder than they do.
<br /><br />--A guy has more problems than you can see with your naked eyes.
<br /><br />--Don't be a snob. Guys can be intimidated and give up easily.
<br /><br />--Everything in moderation. Put on makeup, wear perfume. Just not too much.
<br /><br />--Guys talk about girls more than girls talk about guys.
<br /><br />--Guys hate rejection, but they hate being led on even more.
<br /><br />--If you are going to reject a guy, just do it. Don't say they are like a brother or just good friends, it just hurts even more. Tell them that you aren't interested in a relationship and they will respect you.
<br /><br />--Guys really think that girls are strange and have unpredictable decisions and are MAD confusing but somehow are drawn even more to them.
<br /><br />--A guy would give his left nut to be able to read a girl's mind for a day.
<br /><br />--No guy can handle all his problems on his own. He's just too stubborn to admit it.
<br /><br />--Not all guys are assholes. Just because ONE is a jackass doesnt mean he represents ALL of us.
<br /><br />--We don't like girls who are too skinny.
<br /><br />--We love it when girls talk about there boobs.
<br /><br />--Always make sure you know what kind of stuff your getting into before making out with a guy ...like wheather it's a one time deal or not ....
<br /><br />--Believe it or not shy guys are the most easiest to talk to..it may not seem right but trust me they will start opening up like books after you just ask them questions about their lives and unoticable tell them about yours...
<br /><br />--When a guy hits your butt it means that he wants you sexually
<br /><br />--Even if they refuse it all guys are ticklish on the ribs..
<br /><br />--Guys love neck rubs and if he lets you keep doing it ..it means that he really likes you or his neck really hurts...
<br /><br />--Guys will test the waters to see how far they can get with you. Even if he doesn't intend to it will happen. Know how far it is you want to let him go and he will respect that...after you let him know a couple times.
<br /><br />--When a guy sacrifices his sleep and health just to be with you, he really likes you and wants to be with you as much as possible.
<br /><br />---Girls, if u don't repost this within 1 hr then you will lose the guy of your life
<br /><br />---Guys if you don't repost this in one hr then you will lose the girl of your life.

The Austin paper recently indicated that prices could go as high as $5 per gallon later this year... In April 1997, there was a &quot;gas out&quot; conducted Nationwide in protest of gas prices. Gasoline prices dropped 30 cents a gallon overnight. On May 15th, 2008, we would like to ask all that internet users not to go to a gas station in protest of high gas prices. Gas is now over $3.00 a gallon in most places.
<br /><br />There are 73,000,000! American members currently on the internet network, and the average car takes about 30 to 50 dollars to fill up. If all users did not go to the pump on the 15th, it would take $2,292,000,000.00 (that's almost 3 BILLION) out of the oil companies' pockets for just one day, so please do not go to the gas station on May 15th and lets try to put a dent in the Middle Eastern oil industry for at least one day.
<br /><br />If you agree (which I can't see why you wouldn't) resend this to all of your friends with it saying, ‘‘don’t pump gas on May 15th”
<br /><br />HOPE ALL OF YOU SEE THE IMPORTANCE AND DO THE SAME!!

<br />of Washington chemistry mid-term. The answer by one student was so
<br />&quot;profound&quot; that the professor shared it with colleagues, via the
<br />Internet, which is, of course, why we now have the pleasure of
<br />enjoying it as well.
<br /><br />BONUS QUESTION: IS HELL EXOTHERMIC (GIVES OFF HEAT) OR ENDOTHERMIC (ABSORBS HEAT)?
<br /><br />Most of the students wrote proofs of their beliefs using Boyle's law (gas cools off when it expands and heats up when it is compressed), or some variant. One student, however, wrote the following:
<br />_______________________
<br /><br />First, we need to know how the mass of Hell is changing in time. So we need to know the rate that souls are moving into Hell and the rate they are leaving. I think that we can safely assume that once a soul goes to Hell, it will not leave. Therefore, no souls are leaving.
<br /><br />As for how many souls are entering Hell, let's look at the different religions that exist in the world today. Some of these religions state that if you are not a member of their religion, you will go to Hell. Since there are more than one of these religions and since people do not belong to more than one religion, we can project that all souls go to Hell.
<br /><br />With birth and death rates as they are, we can expect the number of souls in Hell to increase exponentially.
<br /><br />Now, we look at the rate of change of the volume in Hell because Boyle's Law states that in order for the temperature and pressure in Hell to stay the same, the volume of Hell has to expand as souls are added.
<br />This gives two possibilities:
<br /><br />1. If Hell is expanding at a slower rate than the rate at which souls enter Hell, then the temperature and pressure in Hell will increase until all Hell breaks loose.
<br /><br />2. If Hell is expanding at a rate faster than the increase of souls in Hell, then the temperature and pressure will drop until Hell freezes over.
<br /><br />So which is it?
<br /><br />If we accept the postulate given to me by Teresa during my Freshman year that, &quot;it will be a cold day in Hell before I sleep with you, and take into account the fact that I slept with her last night, then number 2 must be true, and thus I am sure that Hell is exothermic and has already frozen over. The corollary of this theory is that since Hell has frozen over, it follows that it is not accepting any more souls and is therefore, extinct...leaving only Heaven thereby proving the existence of a divine being which explains why, last night, Teresa kept shouting &quot;Oh my God.&quot;
<br /><br />This was the only student with an A.
