Despite intense feuds between the likes of Tito Ortiz and Ken Shamrock or Rampage Jackson and Wanderlei Silva, there is one that stands head-and-shoulders above the rest: Anderson Silva vs. Chael Sonnen. Although Silva has been regarded as the top fighter in the world for some time now, until his first battle with Sonnen, it was hard to keep the champion motivated for fights. Never was that more evident than his UFC 112 &quot;fight&quot; against Demian Maia, in which the champion intentionally avoided contact for most of the final two rounds. When challenger Chael Sonnen decided   <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2pvcmRhbnNob2VzZm9yc2FsZXMuYmxpbmt3ZWIuY29tLw__" target="_blank"><strong>jordan shoes for sale</strong></a>    to use his legendary mouth to defame, defile and degrade &quot;The Spider&quot; and his homeland of Brazil, it was clear that Silva had found something more than just another opponent. He had found an enemy. The legendary first fight saw Sonnen outstrike Silva at a ratio of 5-to-1, however the champion would pull off the greatest come-from-behind victory in MMA history by securing a combination triangle choke/armbar to score a tapout in the final stanza. Who could have predicted that Sonnen would fare so well against the dominant champion? After all, the Oregonian badass had put   <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2FpcmpvcmRhbnNob2VzLmJsaW5rd2ViLmNvbS8_" target="_blank"><strong>air jordan shoes</strong></a>    together a paltry 4-3 record in the UFC prior to challenging for the belt. Courtesy of MMAFighting So what happened to make the rivalry so intense the second time around? There are some theories, but I attribute the problem to one incident. Sonnen's penchant for verbal jabs may have gone a tiny bit too far in October, when he decided to direct his attention to another member of the Silva household. Via ESPN: You tell Anderson Silva I'm coming over and I'm kicking down his backdoor and patting his little lady on the [butt], and I'm telling her to make me a steak, medium-rare, just how I like it. Perhaps he was inspired by his loudmouth challenger. Maybe he is tired of losing the war of the words, I'm not sure. But when Silva finally decided to speak out, his ultra-violent threats were shocking, to say the least. Via MMAFighting.com: Chael is a criminal. He's been convicted of crimes. He doesn't deserve to be in the Octagon. When the time is right, I'm going to knock all of his teeth out. I am going to make him eat these words he has said about me and about the UFC. This is the end of the jokes, no more talking. What I'm going to do inside the Octagon is something that's going to change the image of the sport. I'm going to beat his ass like he's  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2NoZWFwYWlyam9yZGFuc3MuYmxpbmt3ZWIuY29tLw__" target="_blank"><strong>cheap air jordans</strong></a>     never been beaten before. I'm going to make sure that every one of his teeth are broken, his arms are broken, his legs will be broken. He's not going to be able to walk out of the octagon by himself. I'm going to beat him maybe the way his parents should have beat him to teach him some manners… I'm going to beat him up like he's never been beat before. He can say whatever he wants,   <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2NoZWFwam9yZGFuc2hvZXMuYmxpbmt3ZWIuY29tLw__" target="_blank"><strong>Cheap Jordan Shoes</strong></a>    but I'm not playing any more. It's not often that you find two men—with so much mutual disdain—who can challenge each other on both the verbal and physical battlefields. However, that seems to be the magical paradigm that these middleweights have stumbled upon. The heat of battle can make men do some crazy things. How crazy will things get when the greatest rivalry in MMA history comes to a head tomorrow night at UFC 148? Don't miss out on the most anticipated battle that the sport has ever seen.

However, the C's may end up needing extra help in the front court,  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2FpcmpvcmRhbnNob2VzLmJsaW5rd2ViLmNvbS8_" target="_blank"><strong>air jordan shoes</strong></a>     as Chris Forsberg of ESPN reports that Greg Stiemsma is garnering a lot of interest from theMinnesota Timberwolves. Although the Celtics would like to hold on to the promising center, they can only match offers that fit into the salary cap restrictions, which means they will be unable to match any offer above the bi-annual exception. However, the Celtics may be in luck,   <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2NoZWFwam9yZGFuc2hvZXMuYmxpbmt3ZWIuY29tLw__" target="_blank"><strong>Cheap Jordan Shoes</strong></a>    as they still own the Bird Rights for center Nenad Krstic, who they received along with Jeff Green in the Kendrick Perkins trade with the Oklahoma City Thunder. Krstic didn't stay with the team long—as he signed overseas during the lockout—but he did hold an option to terminate his contract with CSKA Moscow. Chris Forsberg highlighted thatCarchia of Redazione Sportanda in Russia has reported that  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2NoZWFwbmlrZWpvcmRhbnMuYmxpbmt3ZWIuY29tLw__" target="_blank"><strong>cheap nike jordans</strong></a>    Krstic will not be returning to CSKA Moscow next year, and he plans to terminate his current contract. There hasn't yet been much U.S. news about the possibility of Krstic returning to the NBA, but a translated report from Sportska Centralatitled &amp;quot;Krstic on the Verge of Returning to Boston&amp;quot; expresses that Krstic plans to return to the NBA and has interest in joining Milwaukee, Brooklyn, or Boston. However, the Celtics hold the exclusive Bird Rights for Krstic and therefore can sign <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2NoZWFwbmlrZWpvcmRhbnMuYmxpbmt3ZWIuY29tLw__" target="_blank"><strong>cheap nike jordans</strong></a>     him to a larger contract than most other teams by going over the salary cap to pay his salary. Although Krstic only played in 24 games with the Celtics, he actually put together solid performances by averaging 9.1 points on 53.7 percent shooting as well as 5.4 rebounds per game. Boston could still use depth in the frontcourt—especially if Stiemsma leaves—and Krstic would give the team another 7-footer that can make mid-range shots and is a capable defender in the paint. The added depth at the center position that Krstic provides would allow Kevin Garnett the rest he needs to make it through the season, as well as provide another player that can provide the rebounding that the C's were missing last season. It isn't clear how interested Krstic is in returning to Boston, or if the team  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2NoZWFwam9yZGFuc3MuYmxpbmt3ZWIuY29tLw__" target="_blank"><strong>cheap jordans</strong></a>     has even reached out to him and considered making an offer. Yet the move would make sense for both Krstic and the Celtics, especially now that Boston has room below the luxury tax cap due to the loss of Ray Allen. Although it is not a perfect solution to the Celtics' needs at center, it will greatly improve the overall performance of the team and help to provide the size Boston has been missing.

We already know the expectations of draft picks Jared Sullinger, Fab Melo and Kris Joseph. We know that second year Purdue products E'Twaun Moore and <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2NoZWFwbmlrZWpvcmRhbnMuYmxpbmt3ZWIuY29tLw__" target="_blank"><strong>cheap nike jordans</strong></a>     JaJuan Johnson are fighting for bench roles for the 2012-2013 season. We even remember the signing of Sean Williams late last season in a desperate attempt to add depth at the center position. What we don't know—or at least not yet—is that 25-year-old Dionte Christmas is <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2pvcmRhbnNob2VzZm9yc2FsZS5ibGlua3dlYi5jb20v" target="_blank"><strong>jordan shoes for sale</strong></a>     intent on earning a spot on the Celtics' roster. Christmas is a former Temple Owl who, during his college career, was a multiple time Atlantic 10 All-Conference player and led his team in scoring from his sophomoreyear on. Despite going undrafted, Christmas has had opportunities to make an NBA squad in the past, including stints with the 76ers, Clippers, Kings   <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2NoZWFwYWlyam9yZGFuLmJsaW5rd2ViLmNvbS8_" target="_blank"><strong>Cheap Air Jordan</strong></a>    and Rockets organizations. After failing to hold down a spot on any of theaforementioned teams, he played professionally overseas for teams in both the Czech Republic and Greece. With all of the questions surrounding the Boston Celtics frontcourt options this offseason, Danny Ainge invited Christmas to the C's summer league roster. Christmas is slated to only play for the Orlando   <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2pvcmRhbnNob2VzZm9yY2hlYXAuYmxpbmt3ZWIuY29tLw__" target="_blank"><strong>jordan shoes for cheap</strong></a>   tournament for one reason or another. However, after today's performance, the Boston front office may want to reconsider how long his stay in green will be. Christmas played the most of any player on the roster, totaling nearly 30 minutes of on-court action. During his play, Christmas showed the ability to play a quality combo-guard role, getting open on the wing, crashing the boards and evendistributingthe ball to open players. He was the only Celtic toachievea double-double. He totaled 10 points, 10 boards and even produced 4 assists. I'm not suggesting that Christmas is the answer to Boston's bench woes, but he was able to produce in the summer league opener and is  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2NoZWFwam9yZGFuc3MuYmxpbmt3ZWIuY29tLw__" target="_blank"><strong>cheap jordans</strong></a>     clearly hungry for a chance to contribute to an NBA team. He is someone that Celtic fans should keep an eye on because, if he continues to produce the way he did today, he could be having a longer tenure in a green jersey than just the five games of the Orlando summer league tournament.

		<document id="8fe7da3661eebfe8df03dd0a5259afdc" url=""><![CDATA[jordan shoes for sale- 2012 Summer Olympic Games Preview - C<br/><br/>Philadelphia, PA – There are 18 medal events for cycling at the 2012 Olympics, between the road, track, mountain and BMX. Each event needs a   <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2NoZWFwam9yZGFuc2hvZXMuYmxpbmt3ZWIuY29tLw__" target="_blank"><strong>Cheap Jordan Shoes</strong></a>    slightly different incarnation of the sport's talent.
<br /><br />The Olympic road race will be determined by the course, as much as the riders themselves. The start/finish line will be at The Mall in central  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2pvcmRhbnNob2VzZm9yc2FsZXMuYmxpbmt3ZWIuY29tLw__" target="_blank"><strong>jordan shoes for sale</strong></a>     London, and the course takes riders southwest through the city and through six boroughs.
<br /><br />The biggest feature is the Box Hill loop in the Surrey section of the route. It's not the hardest climb nor the longest, but it can wear down a rider's legs with enough repetitions. It may also inject some unpredictability into the race. Countries  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2NoZWFwYWlyam9yZGFuc3MuYmxpbmt3ZWIuY29tLw__" target="_blank"><strong>cheap air jordans</strong></a>     hoping for a sprint finish will try to control the race over Box Hill to keep breakaways from being established, but it can still provide chances for clever and strong riders to make a move.
<br /><br />The men's race will be 250 kilometers long with nine circuits of the Box Hill loop, while women will race 140km and go up Box Hill twice. Because each team is fairly small, the race is difficult to control and could become unpredictable.
<br /><br />MEN'S ROAD RACE
<br /><br />Host country Great Britain will line up a strong team, and it will be hoping for a repeat of last year's world championships. A superstar British lineup held the race together for a sprint finish, in which Mark Cavendish took over Australian Matt Goss in a crafty sprint. Cavendish has been the world's top sprinter for the last five years, and is hard to beat in a drag race.
<br /><br />Cavendish will have support from Tour de France contender Bradley Wiggins, who began his cycling career on the track but has successfully transitioned to the road. The British team also includes Davis Millar, who had once been banned from Olympic competition by the British Olympic Association because he admitted to doping. However, that ban was overturned earlier this year.
<br /><br />Several other countries will have strong lineups and riders.
<br /><br />Belgium features Tom Boonen, who has been in incredible form this season. He won a handful of one-day spring classics races, including the prestigious Tour of Flanders and Paris-Roubaix, as well as his national road race. Boonen is strong in breakaways and is perhaps the best rider in a sprint at the end of a hard race, and has set his sights on winning. He skipped the Tour de France specifically to train for London.
<br /><br />The United States has a squad that can compete in several types of races.
<br /><br />Tyler Farrar, 28, has won stages in all three grand tours and can mix it up in a sprint finish. Additionally, young stars Taylor Phinney and Tejay van Garderen, American national champion Timothy Duggan and veteran Chris Horner will give the U.S. more cards to play.
<br /><br />Horner, 40, will be heading to his first Olympics and can act as the team's captain on the road, while the 29-year-old Duggan is a workhorse and won the U.S. national championship in May.
<br /><br />Van Garderen, 24, is a strong all-around talent and blossoming stage race contender. Phinney -- the 22-year-old son of former Olympic medalists Connie Carpenter and Davis Phinney -- competed for the U.S. at the 2008 Olympics on the track, in the individual pursuit. But because that event was removed from the Olympic program, he's available to help the road team as a strong rider with a lot of endurance and a decent sprint.
<br /><br />Other strong riders include Switzerland's powerhouse, Fabian Cancellara, 22- year-old Slovak Peter Sagan, Goss, and 2011 Tour de France winner Cadel Evans.
<br /><br />Canada will be represented in the road race by Ryder Hesjedal, who earned the biggest win of his career in May at the Giro d'Italia.
<br /><br />Another factor may be the Tour de France, which <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2J1eWpvcmRhbi5ibGlua3dlYi5jb20v" target="_blank"><strong>buy jordan</strong></a>    ends a mere six days before the men's road race occurs Saturday, July 28.
<br /><br />WOMEN'S ROAD RACE
<br /><br />Discussions about women's cycling these days rarely take place without a mention of Dutch superstar Marianne Vos, a world champion in multiple cycling disciplines.
<br /><br />In 2006 at the age of 19, Vos won world titles in cyclocross and the women's road race. Two years later in Beijing, she took gold in the women's points race on the track. In the years since, Vos has only affirmed her dominance while racking up dozens of wins. She broke her collarbone in May, but has proven her recovery by winning this month's Giro Donne, a prestigious women's road race.
<br /><br />The British and American teams also feature strong rosters.
<br /><br />The U.S. team features Evelyn Stevens, who has emerged as a star since taking up the sport just four years ago. She left her Wall Street job a year later and won consecutive national time trial championships in 2010 and '11. Stevens picked up her biggest victories this year, beating Vos in an uphill sprint to win Fleche Wallonne in April and winning the overall title at the Exergy Tour in late May.
<br /><br />The 29-year-old Stevens has a lot of power and talent, capable of solo attacks, but the team's best hope in a sprint is likely Shelley Olds. The 31- year-old, who comes from a track background, recently won a stage at the Giro Donne and can compete with the world's best in a big finish.
<br /><br />Also on the American team are veterans Kristin Armstrong and Amber Neben. Armstrong won gold in the time trial at the Beijing Olympics, and won two world championships in the discipline. She is coming back from a collarbone break in May.
<br /><br />Neben, who won the world time trial title in 2008, finished second to Stevens at the Exergy Tour and could be a powerful rider for the U.S.
<br /><br />The British squad is highlighted by defending Olympic champion Nicole Cooke, and she's joined by a trio of riders that give the host nation multiple options for gold.
<br /><br />Lizzie Armitstead is a top-class sprinter who can also win out of a breakaway, while Emma Pooley is a strong climber who can pull off solo   <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2FpcmpvcmRhbnNob2VzLmJsaW5rd2ViLmNvbS8_" target="_blank"><strong>air jordan shoes</strong></a>    attacks. Lucy Martin will offer support for however the race unfolds.
<br /><br />A few weeks ago at the British national championships, Armistead and Pooley finished second and third behind their trade teammate Sharon Laws -- who was left off the Olympic squad.
<br /><br />Among the other strong riders to watch is Swede Emma Johansson, who took the silver medal in '08. Two-time defending world champion Giorgia Bronzini highlights an Italian team that also includes '08 bronze medalist Tatiana Guderzo. Clara Hughes, a former Olympic medalist in cycling and speedskating, headlines the Canadian team.
<br /><br />The women's road race takes place Sunday, July 29.
<br /><br />TIME TRIAL
<br /><br />Cancellara is the returning men's Olympic champion, and has been a dominant time trial rider in recent years, winning four world championships since 2006. But he was unseated last year by Tony Martin, a 27-year-old German who figures to be the biggest obstacle for Cancellara repeating.
<br /><br />Wiggins, who finished second at last year's world championships, will be Britain's biggest hope. Phinney will be the lone American in the time trial, and will likely be competitive. He won the U.S. time trial title two years ago, and earned the victory at the opening time trial at the Giro in May. Hesjedal will be Canada's lone entry in the men's time trial.
<br /><br />Armstrong has her sights set on repeating as women's champion, while Neben will also contest the

German Judith Arndt and Pooley, the last two world time trial champions, should also contend for medals with Hughes  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2pvcmRhbnNob2VzZm9yc2FsZXMuYmxpbmt3ZWIuY29tLw__" target="_blank"><strong>jordan shoes for sale</strong></a>     and New Zealand's Linda Villumsen.
<br /><br />Competitors in the men's time trial will race 44 kilometers, while the women's course is 29 kilometers long. Both events take place August 1.
<br /><br />TRACK
<br /><br />Great Britain cleaned up in track  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2J1eWpvcmRhbi5ibGlua3dlYi5jb20v" target="_blank"><strong>buy jordan</strong></a>    at the 2008 Olympics, winning gold in seven of 10 events, as well as 12 of 30 medals overall.
<br /><br />But if the 2012 track cycling world championships in Melbourne are any indicator, the Great Britain team will face a big challenge from Australia at the Olympics. The Brits won 13 medals there, while the host Aussies took 15, with both countries winning an equal amount of gold medals (six).
<br /><br />Those two countries also dominated the Olympic events at track worlds, winning eight of 10.
<br /><br />The track program has changed since 2008, when there were seven men's events and three for women. Now there are five for each -- the keirin, sprint, team sprint, team pursuit and omnium.
<br /><br />The sprint and team sprint events are essentially head-to-head races between two competitors. With the sprint, riders compete in a 200-meter time trial to determine rankings for a 16-rider tournament. The team sprint event begins with a qualifying  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2FpcmpvcmRhbnNob2VzLmJsaW5rd2ViLmNvbS8_" target="_blank"><strong>air jordan shoes</strong></a>     round, with the best eight teams advancing.
<br /><br />In the keirin, an eight-lap race, cyclists contest a sprint after following a motorbike, which leaves the track with 2 1/2 laps to go (600 meters). The best 12 riders from a series of heats advance to the second round, from which six riders go through to the medal round.
<br /><br />The team pursuit pits squads of riders against each other, starting on opposite sides of the track and ending when one team comes within one meter of the other. If neither does, whoever finishes the race distance quickest wins. Men have teams of four and race 4 kilometers, while women have teams of three and race 3 km.
<br /><br />The omnium is comprised of six events -- the flying lap, points race, elimination race, individual pursuit, scratch race, and time trial -- that require a variety of skill, as they range from short sprints to endurance events. In each event, the winner gets one point, the second-place rider gets two, etc. The rider with the lowest point total at the end wins.
<br /><br />Among the top riders to watch will be Great Britain's Sir Chris Hoy, who won three gold medals in Beijing -- in the sprint, keirin and team sprint. He was the first Briton since 1908 to win three gold medals in a single Olympic Games.
<br /><br />An 11-time world champion, the 36-year-old Hoy returns as part of the sprinting team. He finished behind France's Gregory Bauge and countryman Jason Kenny in the sprint at this year's worlds, but won a world title in the keirin.
<br /><br />Both of Great Britain's team pursuit squads set world records at this year's worlds, edging the Australian teams each time.
<br /><br />Additionally for Britain, Victoria Pendleton  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2NoZWFwYWlyam9yZGFuLmJsaW5rd2ViLmNvbS8_" target="_blank"><strong>Cheap Air Jordan</strong></a>      <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2NoZWFwYWlyam9yZGFuLmJsaW5rd2ViLmNvbS8_" target="_blank"><strong>Cheap Air Jordan</strong></a>    is back to defend her gold medal in the women's sprint. She won the world title in April.
<br /><br />Sprinter Anna Meares, a three-time Olympic medalist and multiple world champion, leads the Australian track team. She is the reigning keirin world titlist.
<br /><br />The United States is sending six riders, including Sarah Hammer, who won a bronze medal in the women's omnium at this year's worlds. Hammer will race the omnium, and be joined by Dotsie Bausch, Jennie Reed and Lauren Tamayo in the women's team pursuit. The team took silver in the event at the 2001 world championships.
<br /><br />On the men's side, Bobby Lea will contest the omnium and Jimmy Watkins is competing in the men's sprint.
<br /><br />Canada will send seven cyclists, including Tara Whitten, who has won two world titles in the omnium. Zach Bell, who won world championship silver in the men's omnium in April, will also compete for Canada.
<br /><br />Track events get underway Thursday, August 2, when medals will be awarded for the team sprint, and men's team pursuit gets underway. The final track medals will be awarded August 7.
<br /><br />MOUNTAIN BIKE
<br /><br />There are only two mountain bike events -- a cross-country mountain bike race for men and women. The fields are fairly exclusive. Just 50 men will be competing, and only 30 women.
<br /><br />France's Julien Absalon is the two-time defending gold medal winner in the men's race, while German Sabine Spitz will defend her gold in the women's race.
<br /><br />The United States' Georgia Gould earned an automatic selection because she ranked inside the top 10 in the individual world cup rankings, and will be  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2pvcmRhbnNob2VzZm9yc2FsZS5ibGlua3dlYi5jb20v" target="_blank"><strong>jordan shoes for sale</strong></a>     joined by Lea Davison in the women's race. Samuel Schultz and Todd Wells will race for the U.S. in the men's competition.
<br /><br />Canada will have strong medal hopes in the women's race with two-time world champion Catharine Pendrel, who will be joined by young star Emily Batty. For the men's race, veteran Geoff Kabush will appear in his third Olympics, alongside Max Plaxton, the reigning two-time Canadian national champion.
<br /><br />BMX
<br /><br />This will be just the second Olympic appearance for BMX, which was won by Latvia's Maris Strombergs and France's Anne-Caroline Chausson in Beijing.
<br /><br />The United States will send five riders to London for the discipline.
<br /><br />Connor Fields won the Olympic Trials in June, defeating Beijing silver medalist Mike Day to earn his spot. He's currently the second-ranked rider in the world being world champion Sam Willoughby of Australia. Fields will be joined by automatic   <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2NoZWFwbmlrZWpvcmRhbnMuYmxpbmt3ZWIuY29tLw__" target="_blank"><strong>cheap nike jordans</strong></a>    qualifier David Herman and discretionary pick Nic Long.
<br /><br />Arielle Martin and Alise Post will compete in the women's BMX event for the U.S.
<br /><br />France's Magalie Pottier is the current women's world champion and top-ranked rider.

<br /><br />Cowan batted for five-and-a-half hours on a tricky pitch, facing 268 balls including a six and 12 fours, and shared a fourth-wicket partnership of 104 with New Zealand's Hamish Marshall.
<br /><br />Resuming on his overnight score of 51 not out, Cowan added just 31 from 100 balls during an attritional morning session.
<br /><br />But Cowan moved swiftly to three figures after lunch, straight-driving seamer Reece Topley for four and then easing a full-length ball from David Masters through the covers in the next over to register his maiden championship hundred.

So was the fact that the contract would be a mammoth one: Elliotte Friedman of CBC Sports reported on June 9 that the average annual salary would be in the  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2NoZWFwbmlrZWpvcmRhbnMuYmxpbmt3ZWIuY29tLw__" target="_blank"><strong>cheap nike jordans</strong></a>     neighborhood of $9 million per season, up from $8.7 million in his current deal that ends next summer.
<br /><br />On Thursday, Darren Dreger of TSN reported that Crosby's new contract will be formally announced on Sunday.
<br /><br />The Penguins confirmed the details later in  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2pvcmRhbnNob2VzZm9yY2hlYXAuYmxpbmt3ZWIuY29tLw__" target="_blank"><strong>jordan shoes for cheap</strong></a>     the day: $104.4 million over 12 years.

<br /><br />&amp;quot;I don't blame him. We're all optimistic.   <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2FpcmpvcmRhbnNob2VzLmJsaW5rd2ViLmNvbS8_" target="_blank"><strong>air jordan shoes</strong></a>    f you're Shane Doan, would you sign?&amp;quot; said Maloney at last weekend's NHL Draft in Pittsburgh.
<br /><br />Seeing as how that ownership situation won't be settled by July 1, it should come as no surprise that Doan will become a UFA this summer. As Maloney told NHL Live on Tuesday, he expects the veteran forward will field some offers from the competition:
<br /><br />&amp;quot;We feel confident we can re-sign him.  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2pvcmRhbnNob2VzZm9yc2FsZXMuYmxpbmt3ZWIuY29tLw__" target="_blank"><strong>jordan shoes for sale</strong></a>     It's just a matter of getting a little more clarity, hopefully when Greg Jamison's group may be able to take over the team.
<br /><br />&amp;quot;Unfortunately, it doesn't look like it'll happen by July 1, so now you run the risk of going to July 1 and some of my good friends in the general managers seats saying 'Let me just see if I can make it more expensive for the Coyotes' or make a legitimate offer.&amp;quot;
<br /><br />Does this mean Doan's gone? No, and   <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2NoZWFwbmlrZWpvcmRhbnMuYmxpbmt3ZWIuY29tLw__" target="_blank"><strong>cheap nike jordans</strong></a>    Maloney believes &amp;quot;he wants to be back in Phoenix.&amp;quot; But the ownership situation remains unsettled, and a recent court ruling could extend that uncertainty all the way to a public referendum on the team's arena lease deal.
<br /><br />Plus, the 16-year NHL veteran — who started with the Winnipeg Jets in 1995, before moving to Phoenix the following season — is an elite power forward. He's a leader, a playoff warrior and a player that's good for 60-70 points and quality two-way  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2NoZWFwam9yZGFuc3MuYmxpbmt3ZWIuY29tLw__" target="_blank"><strong>cheap jordans</strong></a>     hockey. He made $4.55 million against the cap last season. He would be coveted … if he decides to move on from Phoenix.

<br /><br />• Live updates from APBA Gold Cup
<br /><br />David?s team filed an appeal after the race, saying Villwock had chopped him on the third lap of the event, causing him to lose   <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2FpcmpvcmRhbnNob2VzLmJsaW5rd2ViLmNvbS8_" target="_blank"><strong>air jordan shoes</strong></a>    momentum. Mike Noonan, chief race referee, dismissed the appeal later and upheld Villwock?s victory.
<br /><br />J. Michael Kelly in the U-37 Miss Beacon Plumbing unlimited finished third in a race that was delayed 90 minutes by lumpy water and a stiff wind.
<br /><br />Villwock?s victory was his fifth Gold Cup win in a row, while David has now finished runner-up six times in the race.
<br /><br />It was also Villwock?s 67th unlimited victory. The only driver to have more Gold Cup victories is the legendary Chip Hanauer, who won the race 11 times.
<br /><br />?It?s unbelievable ? unbelievable,? said Villwock on the finger dock after climbing from the cockpit of his boat. ?The guys (crew) did a great job with the boat.?
<br /><br />Villwock knew his wing had been damaged but was not certain where and when.

<br /><br />Was it his best Gold Cup victory?
<br /><br />?That was a good one,? he said.
<br /><br />Villwock said he was pumped to win his 10th Gold Cup.
<br /><br />?It?s un unbelievable feeling to get into double digits,? he said.
<br /><br />Villwock agreed it takes aggression to win the Gold Cup on a river that is at times unforgiving.
<br /><br />?It?s all or nothing on the Detroit River,? he said. ?There wasn?t much left on the table. I used it up. I just keep pressing. That was a great ride. That was fun.?
<br /><br />David thought Villwock cut him off on Lap 3 after he?d led Villwock early.
<br /><br />?We were having a heck of a boat race and he took me out of the race,? said David. ?We had him on acceleration and he had us at the very end of the straightaway. It was going to be anybody?s race. I didn?t think I was going to finish second.?
<br /><br />David said the incident upset his momentum.
<br /><br />?It got me out of mindset ? it changed my rhythm,? said David. ?You need a good second to recover.?

<br /><br />Stafford is nine years younger and not nearly as accomplished as the Super Bowl-champion Brees, but the two share an agent in Tom Condon,  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2FpcmpvcmRhbnNob2VzLmJsaW5rd2ViLmNvbS8_" target="_blank"><strong>air jordan shoes</strong></a>     a spot in the record book as two of four quarterbacks in NFL history with 5,000-yard passing seasons, and Stafford is unquestionably the Lions' signal caller of the future.
<br /><br />Stafford has two years left on the rookie contract he signed as the first pick in the 2009 draft, so the Lions are a long way from the franchise showdown that netted Brees his mega-deal.
<br /><br />But after converting the bulk of his base pay to signing bonuses the last two years, he does have cumbersome salary-cap numbers of $20 million in 2013 and $19 million in 2014 that could prompt the Lions to try signing him to a long-term extension next off-season (like they did with Calvin Johnson when his cap number became too big this spring).
<br /><br />According to NFL Players Association records, the Lions have 51 players currently under contract for 2013 at a cap value of $121 million, about the projected cap. That doesn't include potential unrestricted free agents Cliff Avril, Corey Williams, Justin  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2NoZWFwam9yZGFuc2hvZXMuYmxpbmt3ZWIuY29tLw__" target="_blank"><strong>Cheap Jordan Shoes</strong></a>     Durant, DeAndre Levy, Chris Houston, Louis Delmas and Gosder Cherilus -- all starters.
<br /><br />Two player-side cap analysts said the 24-year-old Stafford, with another standout season this fall, likely will command guaranteed money on his next contract similar to what the 33-year-old Brees got Friday. According to reports, Brees'   <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2NoZWFwam9yZGFuc3MuYmxpbmt3ZWIuY29tLw__" target="_blank"><strong>cheap jordans</strong></a>    deal includes a $37-million signing bonus and $55 million in the first two years.
<br /><br />If Stafford and the Lions wait on an extension, the sides will have more deals at their disposal that could affect negotiations. Joe Flacco (this year), Matt Ryan (2013), Jay Cutler (2013), Aaron Rodgers (2014) and Tom Brady (2014) are among the  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2NoZWFwbmlrZWpvcmRhbnMuYmxpbmt3ZWIuY29tLw__" target="_blank"><strong>cheap nike jordans</strong></a>     quarterbacks whose contracts expire before or at the same time as Stafford's. And the new league TV contracts should begin affecting the salary cap in 2015.

<br /><br />In the past week, or since a July 4 holiday that saw Ryan Suter and Zach Parise pick Minnesota and Matt Carle go to Tampa Bay, there've been few signings of significance.
<br /><br />Only four players have been signed to   <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2NoZWFwYWlyam9yZGFuLmJsaW5rd2ViLmNvbS8_" target="_blank"><strong>Cheap Air Jordan</strong></a>    contracts averaging more than $1 million per season since July 5 -- and the biggest name among that group was Teemu Selanne, who agreed Thursday to a $4.5-million, one-year deal with Anaheim, and he wasn't pursued by any other clubs since Selanne had made it known   <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2pvcmRhbnNob2VzZm9yc2FsZS5ibGlua3dlYi5jb20v" target="_blank"><strong>jordan shoes for sale</strong></a>    he'd either return to the Ducks or retire.
<br /><br />The Wings remain in contact with the agent for unrestricted free-agent forward Shane Doan, but Doan is talking to the Coyotes, too, and odds all along have been that he stays in Phoenix. Alexander Semin remains available, but teams are wary of a forward high on skill but low on production and lax in attitude.
<br /><br />The Wings have weaknesses to address, but that's basically a league-wide problem. They'd like to improve their defense, but there's no one particularly attractive on the market, and trades aren't easy to make. And the Wings aren't the only ones seeking help on the blue line: St. Louis needs a top-four guy; Philadelphia needs two after losing Carle to free agency and Chris Pronger to a concussion.
<br /><br />Holland left Wednesday for his off-season <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2pvcmRhbnNob2VzZm9yY2hlYXAuYmxpbmt3ZWIuY29tLw__" target="_blank"><strong>jordan shoes for cheap</strong></a>     home in Western Canada, where he'll continue to conduct business.
<br /><br />But the Wings aren't going to spend money just for the sake of doing so; if they can't get value for their money, they'll keep it and look to make a  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2NoZWFwam9yZGFuc3MuYmxpbmt3ZWIuY29tLw__" target="_blank"><strong>cheap jordans</strong></a>     trade around the deadline.

<br /><br />That's no less true this year. Redistricting required by the 2012 census means voting boundaries were reconfigured for U.S. House and Michigan House districts, in a process led by the Republican-controlled Legislature. In many cases, the newly drawn  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2pvcmRhbnNob2VzZm9yc2FsZXMuYmxpbmt3ZWIuY29tLw__" target="_blank"><strong>jordan shoes for sale</strong></a>     districts are even more tightly controlled by one party or the other. When additional voters show up in November for the general election, they may bemoan the decisions made on Aug. 7, but unless they live in a handful of swing districts, they won't really have much choice about who represents them.
<br /><br />It would be wonderful to break the low turnout pattern  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2NoZWFwYWlyam9yZGFuc3MuYmxpbmt3ZWIuY29tLw__" target="_blank"><strong>cheap air jordans</strong></a>     this year, given the range of candidates and ballot issues. Highlights include a statewide GOP primary for the right to challenge U.S. Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., in November, and spirited -- or at least unusual -- primaries in three congressional districts in metro Detroit. Democratic primary voters will have the ultimate say in at least two of those congressional districts, and on both sides of the ballot, many contests will be settled Aug. 7 for the state House and county commissions, which also went through redistricting.

<br /><br />On Wednesday, the state Senate is expected to take up the bill -- backed by Gov. Rick Snyder -- that would require current and retired  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2FpcmpvcmRhbnNob2VzLmJsaW5rd2ViLmNvbS8_" target="_blank"><strong>air jordan shoes</strong></a>     school employees to dig deeper into their pockets to keep their benefits. Some employees would get reduced benefits.
<br /><br />• Database: How much school districts could save if their retirement costs were lowered 
<br />• How much would retirement bill affect Michigan teachers? A few examples
<br /><br />Supporters say the bill, already approved by the House by a 57-47 vote largely along party lines, would help address a $45-billion unfunded liability in the Michigan Public School Employees Retirement System. Some Republicans believe it doesn't go far enough -- they want to end the pension system altogether for new employees, an extremely costly option the Snyder administration wants to study more.
<br /><br />The bill is hotly opposed by groups representing current and retired school employees.
<br /><br />&quot;There has to be some middle ground,&quot; said Kristi Barel, a teacher in Utica Community Schools. &quot;I know times are tough, but it shouldn't just be put on teachers and educators. That's not going to solve the problem.&quot;
<br /><br />But state Sen. Roger Kahn, R-Saginaw Township, says the bill will ensure teachers like Barel have the benefits they've earned.
<br /><br />&quot;Their benefits are threatened by the amount of   <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2NoZWFwam9yZGFuc3MuYmxpbmt3ZWIuY29tLw__" target="_blank"><strong>cheap jordans</strong></a>    unfunded liability that is present within the system,&quot; said Kahn, the lead sponsor of the bill.Democrats in the House and Senate have been opposed to the bills.
<br /><br />&quot;What's in front of us right now is still just another blatant attack on teachers,&quot; said Robert McCann, spokesman for Senate Democrats.
<br /><br />Part of a trend across country
<br />Most of the employees covered by the system work in K-12 schools, though it also covers some university, community college and local library employees.
<br /><br />The efforts in Michigan are part of a national trend.
<br /><br />&quot;Everyone is trying to find their own way of reducing the overall costs,&quot; said Mike Griffith, senior policy analyst at the Education Commission of the States.
<br /><br />Some say the changes would bring what has been a generous benefit more in line with changes in the private sector, where many employers also have reduced benefits.
<br /><br />The percentage of payroll dollars going to pay for retirement costs has skyrocketed from 12.99% in the 2003-04 school year to 24.46% in 2011-12. That number is expected to rise to 27% this fiscal year, and an estimated 31% and 35% in subsequent years.
<br /><br />&quot;Districts just can't afford it,&quot; said Don Wotruba, deputy director of the Michigan Association of School Boards. &quot;We'll have too many districts in deficit, or we're going to be laying off to a point where students are going to be hurt.&quot;
<br /><br />The savings won't be a windfall for districts, but they will help. &quot;One of the things that we would do is bank a substantial amount of that savings,&quot;   <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2pvcmRhbnNob2VzZm9yY2hlYXAuYmxpbmt3ZWIuY29tLw__" target="_blank"><strong>jordan shoes for cheap</strong></a>    said Tom Wiseman, assistant superintendent of business and human resources for the Waterford School District.
<br /><br />School employees have traditionally had a generous retirement package with a pension that could pay a retired employee who made a salary of $50,000 a guaranteed annual pension of $22,500, along with retiree health insurance. About 40% of the state's 187,722 school retirees received pensions above $24,000 during the 2010-11 fiscal year.
<br /><br />Under the bill, current employees would either pay more to maintain their pension benefits, see reduced benefits or have their pensions frozen and move to a 401(k) plan. New employees would have the option of either a hybrid plan that combines a traditional pension with a 401(k) or just a 401(k). Health insurance for new hires would be eliminated, but employers would contribute matching funds to the 401(k).
<br /><br />Pensions for people who've already retired wouldn't be affected. However, retirees would be required to pay 20% for health insurance premiums if they're not receiving Medicare. Medicare recipients would pay 10%. Currently, a typical retiree pays about 10% of health insurance premiums.
<br /><br />The state would set aside money each year to fund future health care costs, rather than the current practice of covering the costs as they come. And the percentage of a district's payroll that would go toward retirement costs would be capped at 24.46% for this fiscal year. That would mean a savings of $2.1 million, for example, in the Waterford School District, $5 million for Utica Community Schools and $3 million in Plymouth-Canton Community Schools, based on data from the Michigan House Fiscal Agency, which assumed a 3.5% increase in payroll.
<br /><br />&quot;That would be significant,&quot; said Brodie Killian, executive director of business services for the Plymouth-Canton district.
<br /><br />STATE FACING TOUGH CHOICES
<br />Few dispute the need for reform. State Budget Director John Nixon said the goal of the Snyder administration is to stabilize the system, stop the unfunded liability from growing, ensure that benefits are there for current employees when they retire and provide relief to school districts. Changes in the bill would reduce the unfunded liability by more than $15 billion.
<br /><br />&quot;It's an unstable system and we're trying to bring some stability to it,&quot; Nixon said.
<br /><br />But it may mean some difficult times ahead for some employees. Mary Aldecoa, a Fowlerville teacher, said a pay cut and increased health care contributions already have reduced her salary by 10%. The proposed retirement changes would take more of a chunk out of her salary. She said she might lose her home.
<br /><br />&quot;I've barely hung on to it the last year,  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2NoZWFwYWlyam9yZGFuLmJsaW5rd2ViLmNvbS8_" target="_blank"><strong>Cheap Air Jordan</strong></a>    &quot; Aldecoa said.
<br /><br />Vivian Davis, who was a guidance counselor at Albion High School when she retired in 2011, said she and her husband were careful as they planned for their retirement. The increased health care costs, she said, will be difficult to absorb. She estimates she'll have to pay an additional $100 per month.
<br /><br />Davis said she might have to take on additional work, and luxuries -- including an occasional movie with her grandchildren -- might be out.
<br /><br />She is like many others who feel it's unfair for the state to change the rules for those who've already retired.
<br /><br />&quot;You do what you're supposed to do, you take care of business, and you should be able to live comfortably throughout retirement,&quot; Davis said.
<br /><br />At hearings this spring, lawmakers heard from many who said the changes would force some current teachers to take on second jobs and would particularly hurt people who had lower-paid support jobs and draw smaller pensions.

<br /><br />He and others lay some of the blame for the current state of the system on decisions made in the 1990s by elected leaders to stop pre-funding  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2pvcmRhbnNob2VzZm9yc2FsZS5ibGlua3dlYi5jb20v" target="_blank"><strong>jordan shoes for sale</strong></a>     health care and to shift most of the retirement costs onto school districts.
<br /><br />COMPLEX SET OF FACTORS IN PLAY
<br />There are numerous other problems. The number of current employees paying into the system has dwindled as statewide enrollment declines have forced layoffs, more districts privatize services and more charter schools open. Few charter operators or private companies running services such as busing opt to be part of the retirement system.
<br /><br />Meanwhile, the state's aging population, coupled with incentives that have enticed school employees to retire, is driving up the cost of retiree health care. The system also has lost &amp;quot;huge amounts of money&amp;quot; because of recent stock market losses, Nixon said.
<br /><br />The impact on districts has been severe. In Northville Public Schools, the district spent $9.3 million on retirement in the last school year, a figure that amounted to $1,273 per student, said Mike Zopf, assistant superintendent for finance and operations. That was a huge chunk of the district's per-pupil grant of $8,019. The state has provided some extra funds to school districts to offset the increased costs, but those haven't come near to addressing the problem.
<br /><br />And while retirement costs have risen steadily, per-pupil grants from the state have stagnated, which makes the retirement costs even more burdensome.
<br /><br />&amp;quot;We're really in a pinch,&amp;quot; Wiseman, from the Waterford district, said.
<br /><br />The savings expected in the current fiscal year would be welcome, but school administrators are more guarded about a provision in the bill  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2pvcmRhbnNob2VzZm9yY2hlYXAuYmxpbmt3ZWIuY29tLw__" target="_blank"><strong>jordan shoes for cheap</strong></a>     that would change the way the state determines how much school districts pay for retirement. It's now calculated based on a percentage of payroll costs; the bill would have it be calculated based on a percentage of a school district's current operating expenditures.
<br /><br />David Martell, executive director of the Michigan School Business Officials, said proponents see it as an attempt to spread the retirement costs more evenly. Right now, when school districts reduce staff, they end up paying less into the retirement system -- shifting more costs to other districts. If the state uses a district's operating expenditures, the costs are more evenly spread.
<br /><br />Whether or not that's a fair way of spreading the costs is open to debate, Martell said.
<br /><br />&amp;quot;It's a controversial piece of the bill. There are some districts that would just as soon not see that happen. But others think it's a good idea,&amp;quot; Martell said.
<br /><br />One concern, raised by some school administrators and union groups, is the impact the retirement changes would have on recruiting and maintaining employees.
<br /><br />Martell said the most sought-after teachers -- those teaching key subjects such as math and science -- are the ones who are getting paid below market for their type of degree.
<br /><br />&amp;quot;You could start losing your cream of the top to other industries,&amp;quot; Martell said.
<br /><br />The bill has gone through several rewrites. The current version of the bill passed in the House on June 14.
<br /><br />&amp;quot;We don't think the current version is the perfect solution,&amp;quot; said Wotruba, of the Michigan Association of School Boards, which supports the bill. &amp;quot;  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2NoZWFwbmlrZWpvcmRhbnMuYmxpbmt3ZWIuY29tLw__" target="_blank"><strong>cheap nike jordans</strong></a>    But it's better than the alternative of doing nothing.&amp;quot;

<br /><br />More Details: Bill's highlights
<br /><br />Pension changes
<br /><br />Current employees would have three options:
<br /><br />• Pay 4% or 7% of their salary -- depending on what year they were hired -- to maintain the benefits they have, up from the 4% to 5% employees pay now.
<br /><br />• Pay existing contribution amounts, but accept a reduced pension (the pension multiplier decreases to 1.25% from 1.5%.)
<br /><br />• Freeze the existing pension and  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2NoZWFwYWlyam9yZGFuLmJsaW5rd2ViLmNvbS8_" target="_blank"><strong>Cheap Air Jordan</strong></a>     move to a 401(k) with an employer contribution of 4%.
<br /><br />New hires would have a hybrid plan that would consist of a smaller pension and a plan similar to a 401(k). It would include an employer contribution of 3% if the employee contributes 6%. Employees could also choose a 401(k) only.

<br /><br />They finally got it right on the third try.

Hunter helped the Orioles beat the Twins 2-1.
<br /><br />Zach Britton walked six and didn't record an <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5qb3JkYW5zaG9lc2ZvcnNhbGVhLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"><strong>jordan shoes for sale</strong></a>    out in the fifth inning Tuesday. The day before, Chris Tillman gave up seven runs and got just two outs.
<br /><br />With the poor starts causing havoc in the bullpen, Hunter's strong outing was huge.
<br /><br />Hunter struck out just one -- coming late in his  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jaGVhcGpvcmRhbmxvb2t1cC5jb20_" target="_blank"><strong>jordans shoes for cheap</strong></a>   start -- but he used his fastball in the lower portion of the strike zone and allowed the defense to work for him.
<br /><br />In doing so, Hunter limited his pitch count, enabling <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5haXJqb3JkYW5zaG9lc3AuY29t" target="_blank"><strong>jordan shoes</strong></a>    him to go deeper into the game.

The Red Sox made the decision after Ortiz saw a doctor in Miami to get a second opinion. Although the diagnosis remained the same -- the tendon <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5qb3JkYW5yZXRyb3Nob2VzZS5jb20_" target="_blank"><strong>jordan retro shoes</strong></a>    is neither ruptured nor torn -- Ortiz is expected to be in a walking boot for the next week. As a result, he was unlikely to play for at least 10 days. He's eligible to be activated July 31. &quot;We'll give it a little extra time on the outside so that he's ready to go when he comes off,&quot; manager Bobby Valentine said. Ortiz was injured Monday night while rounding second base on Adrian Gonzalez's go-ahead homer.
<br /><br />--INF Mauro Gomez was recalled from Class AAA Pawtucket to fill the roster spot of injured DH David Ortiz. Gomez was batting .317 with 20 <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jaGVhcGpvcmRhbnNob2VzaG9tZS5jb20_" target="_blank"><strong>cheap air jordan shoes</strong></a>  homers for Pawtucket. He served as Boston's designated hitter Wednesday and went 1-for-4.
<br /><br />--1B Adrian Gonzalez left the July 8 game after only one at-bat because he felt ill. If he hadn't, he may have a 23-game hitting streak. Gonzalez went 3-for-4 with a solo homer and four RBI on Wednesday night, and he has hit safely in 22 of his last 23 games. During that span, Gonzalez is batting .404 (38-for-94), finally exhibiting the stroke that has been AWOL for so much of the season.
<br /><br />&quot;He's probably one of the hottest hitters in the game right now,&quot; RF Cody Ross said. &quot;It seems like he's got that confidence back and that swag back that I've seen for years playing against him. Every time he comes up, he's got a chance to do damage. He's just a fun hitter to watch when he's going good. He sprays the ball all over the place.&quot;
<br /><br />--LHP Felix Doubront has surprised even himself. Doubront became only the second 24-year-old Red Sox pitcher since 1987 to win at least 10 games in a season by tossing six solid innings against the White Sox on Wednesday night at Fenway Park.  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jaGVhcGpvcmRhbnNzZWFyY2guY29t" target="_blank"><strong>Cheap Jordan Shoes</strong></a>   &quot;Coming out of spring training,&quot; manager Bobby Valentine said, &quot;Vegas would have given you pretty good odds that he would not have been the first (pitcher) on our staff with 10 wins.&quot;
<br /><br />But Valentine says he knew better, insisting he saw the young lefty's success coming from his first bullpen session. Doubront's formula is simple: Throw his sinking fastball and watch opposing batters beat grounders into the dirt. Working on 11 days' rest in his first start since the All-Star break, Doubront gave up one run in the first inning, then cruised to the victory. It marked the 13th time in 18 starts that he gave up three earned runs or fewer. He's been so consistent, in fact, that he even has surprised himself.
<br /><br />&quot;A lot,&quot; Doubront said. &quot;But since I came to spring training, I was working so hard to be here to be in this spot, just working to get more wins. And whatever happens, I want to keep fighting to get more wins.&quot;
<br /><br />--CF Jacoby Ellsbury went 3-for-4 with a double and scored three runs Wednesday night, making him 11-for-27 (.407) in six games since returning from a partially dislocated right shoulder that sidelined him for 79 games. In other words, he looks to be back to the form that made him the AL MVP runner-up last season. &quot;Just having Jacoby and Carl (Crawford) back has been huge for us,&quot; RF Cody Ross said. &quot;Getting on base, creating havoc on the paths, and it's just nice to be able to have the table set.&quot;
<br /><br />--RHP Clay Buchholz won't face any pitch-count  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5qb3JkYW5zaG9lc2ZvcnNhbGVhLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"><strong>cheap air jordans</strong></a>   restrictions Thursday in his second start back from the disabled list, according to manager Bobby Valentine. Buchholz threw 87 pitches Saturday against the Rays after missing nearly a month while recovering from esophagitis, a condition that caused stomach bleeding and landed him in the hospital. Against the Rays, Buchholz cruised through six innings before running into trouble in the seventh. Valentine said he considered lifting Buchholz after the sixth, but Buchholz convinced him he felt strong enough to continue. Buchholz will face the White Sox on Thursday night in the finale of a four-game series.

The Rockies <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jaGVhcGFpcmpvcmRhbmxpdmUuY29t" target="_blank"><strong>Cheap Air Jordan</strong></a>   are 5-11 in rubber games overall and 3-5 at home.
<br /><br />--RHP Jhoulys Chacin could throw a three-inning simulated game Saturday at Triple-A Colorado Springs, one day earlier than originally scheduled. Manager Jim Tracy said the change would be made to help Chacin get acclimated to the four-man  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jaGVhcGpvcmRhbmxvb2t1cC5jb20_" target="_blank"><strong>cheap jordan shoes</strong></a>   rotation where starters pitch with three rather than four days of rest. Chacin, who pitched a two-inning simulated game Tuesday, last pitched for the Rockies on May 1. He is recovering from nerve irritation in one of his pectoral muscles.
<br /><br />--INF Chris Nelson (irregular heartbeat) is resting at home. He was admitted to the hospital Monday, and on Tuesday doctors shocked his heart back into rhythm. Manager Jim Tracy said Nelson was in the clubhouse during Tuesday night's game, but he didn't get a chance to speak with the 26-year-old infielder.
<br /><br />--The Rockies are 2-47 when trailing after  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jaGVhcGpvcmRhbnNob2VzZXMuY29t" target="_blank"><strong>Cheap Jordan Shoes</strong></a>   ix complete innings and 0-25 at home. They finished the season series 2-4 against the Pirates and lost two of three to the Pirates at Coors Field for the third straight year.
<br /><br />BY THE NUMBERS
<br />4 -- Home runs allowed by the Rockies, tying their season high. They also gave up four homers June 30 against the Padres, June 26 against the Nationals, June 12 against the A's and May 27 at the Reds.
<br /><br />QUOTE TO NOTE
<br />&amp;quot;He will get his money's worth, I promise  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5haXJqb3JkYW5zaG9lc3AuY29t" target="_blank"><strong>air jordan shoes</strong></a>   you that.&amp;quot; -- Manager Jim Tracy on the aggressive approach at the plate of OF Andrew Brown, who started his first game for the Rockies and went 3-for-5 with a double and two RBI but on his final at-bat struck out with runners on second and third.

Stevens, 25, landed that plum job a little more than two weeks ago when she became head coach of the Gallaudet women’s team. Gallaudet is an internationally recognized university for the deaf and hard of hearing, and Stevens became fully vested in the school’s mission as well as her  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jaGVhcGpvcmRhbnNob2VzY2x1YnMuY29t" target="_blank"><strong>2012 Jordans</strong></a>   players during her one season as a graduate assistant. “I was getting very teary because of what I wanted to do here,” Stevens said of her reaction to being hired. “I wanted to come back to Gallaudet, and that was the most important thing to me. Being a head coach, that’s just the cherry on top.” Stevens spent the year following her graduation from Cincinnati working at Gallaudet for Kevin Cook, its coach at the time. The two met via an introduction through Bearcats women’s basketball assistant Mark Ehlen, who is a friend of Cook’s and knew of Stevens’s deep involvement with the deaf and hard of hearing. The timing couldn’t have been more precise. Cook’s graduate assistant had completed her two seasons with the team, and he was seeking a replacement. With Stevens on <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jaGVhcGpvcmRhbmxvb2t1cC5jb20_" target="_blank"><strong>cheap jordan shoes</strong></a>    board, the Bison went 24-4, were ranked for more than a month and qualified for the Division III tournament for the first time since 1999. That same season, Gallaudet scrimmaged Maryland at Comcast Center, and Stevens got to know Maryland Coach Brenda Frese and her staff. Players from both teams interacted as well after the game, and Stevens recalled feeling completely comfortable in College Park. Stevens last year joined the Maryland women’s basketball staff as the coordinator of recruiting operations, working primarily with Tina Langley, Frese’s top assistant. “I think one of the things that will help her is she had an opportunity to view what goes on behind the scenes within a successful team,” Langley said. “She did a great job working hard and just fitting in and learning the environment. She has just a great passion for  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jaGVhcGFpcmpvcmRhbmxpdmUuY29t" target="_blank"><strong>Cheap Air Jordan</strong></a>   signing, and she talked about it all the time, so I think it’s neat that she can put her two passions together.” While she was at Maryland, Stevens stayed in touch with Gallaudet players, and when the head coaching position opened, starting guard Stephanie Weiss, among others, began lobbying for her to come back. Stevens “knows what she’s doing. She knows everything about basketball,” Weiss said. “She already has that experience as an assistant coach, and working with Brenda Frese and the University of Maryland, a Division I school, I knew that was her dream to go and experience that kind of level.” Part of Stevens’s development as a coach included learning when to be stern with her players. That assignment can become even more complicated on a team whose members all are either deaf or hard of hearing. So instead of raising her voice to show disapproval, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5haXJqb3JkYW5zaG9lc3AuY29t" target="_blank"><strong>air jordan shoes</strong></a>    Stevens uses more pronounced facial expressions or hand movements when she’s signing. She also must pick her spots when conveying strategy, because getting the attention of her players isn’t always possible when their backs are turned to the bench. “How we play the game is the same” as hearing teams, Stevens said. “It’s just that there needs to be eye contact all the time. As a language, [sign] is just so beautiful. It’s so amazing to me just how we can use our hands. I feel it’s easier to communicate not using your voice.”

It was important. I hit the ball fine, it was just some chips and some putts. If I clean that up, I’ll have about 10 extra points.” Wagner — the defending <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jaGVhcGpvcmRhbmxvb2t1cC5jb20_" target="_blank"><strong>cheap jordan</strong></a>    champion, two-time winner and the only non-professional athlete to have won the tournament in its 23rd year — had three birdies to offset two bogeys for his total of 22 points in the modified Stableford scoring system. “I think I had 40 putts. Normally, that’s the strength of my game,” said Wagner, who is one of four players who have played in every Tahoe event. “I hit it really  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jaGVhcGpvcmRhbnNob2VzY2x1YnMuY29t" target="_blank"><strong>Cheap Jordan Shoes</strong></a>   well. I didn’t make any putts.” Mulder, whose best finish in two previous tournaments was 14th in 2010, had four birdies to go with four bogeys. “I was killing my drives and had mid-irons into the par 5s, but this is not what I do for a living so I’m not that confident in my game,” Mulder said. “I’m trying to enjoy myself and not put so much pressur <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jaGVhcGFpcmpvcmRhbmxpdmUuY29t" target="_blank"><strong>Cheap Jordans</strong></a>   e on myself this year. I came into this week hitting the ball well.” Longwell was one point behind the leaders and Romo and Hull had 20 points. “Right now, as can you see by the leaderboard, nobody has come out of the pack,” Wagner said. “Nobody’s hot at all with the putter or  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5haXJqb3JkYW5zaG9lc3AuY29t" target="_blank"><strong>cheap jordan shoes</strong></a>   probably playing that great.” Copyright 2012 The Associated Press.
