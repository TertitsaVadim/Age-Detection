When we are talking about sending the same message to a number of people, we are talking about bulk email.<br /><br />Bulk email is the most important tool in sending newletters or notification about an event happening in your company to a large number of people. Unlike spam messages, sending bulk email is appropriate in hundred ways so you should not mistake it for spam.<br /><br />You can identify spam as unrequested, and they are always not related to the interest of the recipients. Actually, its a random adverstisement which are also randomly sent to people. Compare with spam messages, bulk emails are only sent to those who want it. People expect to receive messages that are of their interest when subscribing to bulk email.<br /><br />A free newsletter on how to make paper castle is a good example of bulk email. You offer a free website on making paper castles and offer a free subscription to an e-magazine on the subject. People will read and enjoy the messages that you sent them. You can advertised related products from time to time in your newsletters. Lets say you do reviews of different glues in your newsletters, and offer an option to order them from your website.<br /><br />To send bulk email, you need to use  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.macmassmailer.com%2Fbulk-email-software"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.macmassmailer.com/bulk-email-software</a>  that automates message delivery, subscription, unsubscription, bad address removal, and can personalize your messages. Using your regular email program for that is not a good idea, since doing so will require you add new new subscribers to your address book, remove those who wish to unsubscribe, and remove peope with bad adresses MANUALLY. Can you manually handle your email list once it grows to thousand of subscribers with hundreds of getting in and out everyday? Thats simply difficult!<br /><br />However if you use bulk email software, you wont have to even touch anything. And everytime there are new changes in your email list, it will be automatically updated so all you need to do is to compose and send your letters.<br /><br />You can have bulk email software for Mac OS X or bulk email sofware for Windows, depending on whether you use Mac or PC. I have two different software products at the same time since I am using both platforms.<br /><br />On my Mac Book Pro laptop, I am using Mac Mass Mailer and on my Windows desktop, I am using Advanced Emailer. In my opinion, these mass email software solutions are the best.<br /><br />Should you need much more information about Mac Mass Mailer, you might check out my site at:  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.macmassmailer.com%2Fbulk-email-software"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.macmassmailer.com/bulk-email-software</a> .

Different email software can be used for sending bulk email messages, including regular email clients such as Mac Mail, however specialized bulk email software for Mac performs this particular task much better.<br /><br />Email lists used in bulk emailing are never static; people come and go regularly, so this list has to be updated daily through the subscription and unsubscription process. On a large scale there can be literally thousands of new people subscribing and unsubscribing every single day, and millions of email messages can be sent every week.<br /><br />Just imagine yourself doing all this manually using Mac Mail, and you'll realize that without specialized bulk email software that automates everything, it's simply impossible.<br /><br />Can I get a better explanation why can't I send bulk email from Mac Mail?<br /><br />If you use a regular email program such as Mac Mail for sending mass email messages, you should keep all your subscribers in Apple Address Book, and then put a number of them in the &quot;To&quot; or &quot;BCC&quot; field of a new bulk email message, which is, basically, just a regular message. We'll not be talking about all the disadvantages of using a regular email client for sending bulk email messages here. To save time, I'll say it doesn't work.<br /><br />This used to work 10 years ago, and in fact, it was the main way to go, but due to abusive use and misuse, Internet and email providers started to limit the number of people that could be put in &quot;To&quot; and &quot;BCC&quot;. These days, all messages with 100 and more addresses in &quot;To&quot; or &quot;BCC&quot; are rejected by the majority email servers.<br /><br />This method was also a big privacy concern because once received, bulk email messages were disclosing other members of email lists. The situation was so bad, spammers were stealing email lists left and right, and people started to think twice before subscribing to any email newsletters.<br /><br />So how specialized bulk email software resolves these issues<br /><br />With the invention of bulk email software, things changed radically. Specialized  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.macmassmailer.com%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.macmassmailer.com/</a>  sends mass messages in quite a different way. It sends individual, personalized email message to each subscriber of the list. And it does it in such a way that the one who receives the message, can't even tell the difference (if this message was sent personally using Mac Mail or it was sent in bulk). And it's great!<br /><br />Bulk email software for Mac, also, offers a very good database system to keep and maintain email lists. As opposed to Apple Address Book, it's automated. If you use bulk email software for Mac, you usually update your recipient database with only one click of your mouse, however if you use Apple Address Book, you have to add new people and remove existing people manually, which is very inconvenient and time-consuming.<br /><br />Another thing I really like about bulk email software, which Mac Mail misses is email message personalization. Mac Mail simply does not let you use personal greeting like &quot;Hello, Mary&quot; and mention other personal details such as names of ordered products and birthdays in your bulk messages. But with bulk email software for Mac you can make a message template with place holders for personal details, and later use this template to generate millions of unique personalized messages based on the information you have in your database.<br /><br />You can even send invoices to thousands of your customers daily using just message templates alone, which is merely impossible if you use Mac Mail.<br /><br />When I was researching this subject, I tried a number of software products for sending bulk email messages including MacMassMailer, BulkMax Mailer and BULKmailer, and eventually chose MacMassMailer as the best possible option.<br /><br />MacMassMailer is a really good bulk email software for Mac<br /><br />It looks good, it works well, and it's native to Mac OS X both Intel and Power PC. Aside from its handiness, in terms of functionality, it gives me exactly what I need:<br /><br />100 % automated and easy to customize recipient database.<br />Auto subscribe, unsubscribe and bounce-back management.<br />Message templates and message individualization.<br />Extremely fast and reliable email message sending.<br />Multiple SMTP accounts with intelligent switching between them.<br />Import and export that works with 99% of all document types.<br /><br />Download MacMassMailer and try it for yourself<br /><br />Because it's:<br /><br />Easy to set up and use.<br />Automates every part of mass mailing.<br />Delivers a great functionality.<br /><br />MacMassMailer free 30-day trial can be downloaded from developer's website, which is very convenient. So, before paying a single cent, I tested it on my computer and made sure it did what I needed. Actually all the software products I mentioned earlier, which I tried, also came in 30-day trials.<br /><br />I really recommend you download MacMassMailer and try it free, if you wish to automate your bulk emailing.<br /><br />To download MacMassMailer, navigate to the link below:  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.macmassmailer.com%2Fbulk-email-software-for-mac"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.macmassmailer.com/bulk-email-software-for-mac</a> ,  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.macmassmailer.com%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.macmassmailer.com/</a> .

		<document id="b388c50184923ec07f3a50b283e191e5" url=""><![CDATA[The Most Effective Solution in Email Marketing<br/><br/>The function of mass emailing software is to send emails to a large number of people known as &quot;recipients&quot;. Before starting to send email messages to these recipients, they usually join your email list by using a subscription we form. At any moment, recipients may leave your email list by clicking on your unsubscribe link.<br /><br />You can absolutely use any email program including your regular email client such as Mac Mail or Microsoft Outlook in sending mass email, but there is no point in that, and Ill explain you why.<br /><br />Automating subscription, unsubscription, and removing of bad addresses are the other things that mass emailing software can do aside from sending mass messages. By using macros, it also lets you personal your messages, and reference recipient personal information, which can't be possible with regular email program.<br /><br />Standard Address Book which is built into the operating system can work with Mac Mail, Eudora, Microsoft Outlook, Windows Mail and other known email programs. Address Book has a limited functionality, and is not designed for holding millions of recipients with thousands coming in and out every day.<br /><br />As opposed to that, mass emailing software works with a high-performance database, and can easily handle even more than that. It also offers a much better import and export functionality so you can move your existing email lists in and out easier.<br /><br />There are a lot of different mass emailing software packages for sale on the Internet, but only a few of them actually work. So if you are looking for one, make sure it does what you need and does it well. These packages might be offering a 30-day trials, and you can thoroughly test the one you want to own before buying.<br /><br />Another thing to consider is operating system you use. There are mass emailing software products for Mac and for PC, and if you use both, you may need to get 2 different versions: one for Mac and another one for PC. I use 2 different mass emailing software packages at the same time because I own Mac Book Pro laptop with Mac OS on it, and my desktop computer is a PC with Windows.<br /><br />I am using Mac Mass Mailer for my Mac Book Pro laptop, and Advanced Emailer for my Windows desktop PC.  These products can manage doing the whole thing well, these are really fantastic products.<br /><br />In case you need more information regarding Mac Mass Mailer, take a look at our website at  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.macmassmailer.com%2Fmass-emailing-software"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.macmassmailer.com/mass-emailing-software</a> .

But before talking about how to do it, I would like to spend some time on explaining what bulk email is and what it isn't. Because, it looks like many people are mistaking bulk mail for spam.<br /><br />Differences between bulk email and spam<br /><br />To distinguish between spam and normal bulk email, you need to understand what spam is; spam is always an advertisement or a scam of some sort, it's always unsolicited, and you can't unsubscribe from it. As opposed to spam, normal bulk email is never sent without subscriber's consent. In case of a normal email list, people get on it and leave it by their choice. Very often, good bulk email messages do not use direct advertisement techniques. They are usually informative (e-magazines, e-courses, e-books, notifications, updates, newsletters and reports), or provide subscribers with special offers, discounts and money saving opportunities.<br /><br />Normal bulk email messages give benefits to both receivers and senders, and the receiver usually benefits the most. Spam is always beneficial for sender, and is most likely a trap for the receiver.<br /><br />Top 5 things to know about bulk email sending<br /><br />Now let's talk about how to send bulk email Mac offers 2 ways of sending bulk messages, you can send them using Mac Mail or a mass mailer for Mac. Before going ahead, pay attention to several extremely important things. You should:<br /><br />1. Keep your email list somewhere on your Mac system.<br />2. Add and remove subscribers from your mailing list regularly.<br />3. Have the ability to import your current customers to your mailing list.<br />4. Have the ability to send thousands of messages effectively.<br />5. Ensure you aren't disclosing all list users in your messages.<br /><br />No matter how you send your bulk email messages from your Mac, all 5 conditions must be met.<br /><br />Mac Mail as mass mailer to send bulk email<br /><br />The easiest, cheapest, and the most available way does not even require you to install anything on your Mac. If your list is not larger than several hundred subscribers, you can use Mac Mail to send bulk email. To do is, follow the steps below:<br /><br />1. Open up Address Book and import your existing mailing list by using File--Import menu item.<br />2. Create a group in Address Book for this mailing list by clicking on the [+] button which is below groups.<br />3. Select the Last Import group in Address Book, select all people there and move them to your new group.<br />4. Select the new group then add other people that were not in the file using the [+] button below the list of people.<br />5. Launch Mac Mail and create a new message by clicking on the New Message button.<br />6. Push the Address Book button located on the toolbar of the message editor that displays your new message.<br />7. In the Address Book picker, select the group in which you imported your list, and select all people in it.<br />8. Press the &quot;Bcc:&quot; button on the toolbar of the Address Book picker, to insert all selected people to the &quot;BCC&quot; list of the new message.<br />9. Compose your bulk message, and then click on the Send button in the message editor to send it out.<br />10. Almost instantly the message will be sent to your email server for delivery.<br /><br />To send bulk email Mac Mail uses the same mechanism as for sending a regular message, it just puts the message with email list &quot;as is&quot; on the mail server. It does not mean that the message will immediately pop up in mailboxes of your subscribers. The server may spend some time trying to create individual messages for all the people, and then sending them all out. This is how it works.<br /><br />Pros of Mac Mail:<br /><br />+ Totally free of charge.<br />+ Already ready to be used.<br />+ Do not need install anything.<br />+ Can be useful for small email lists.<br /><br />Cons of Mac Mail:<br /><br />- Hard to manage big email lists in Apple Address Book.<br />- Address Book import is not convenient and time-consuming.<br />- Subscription and unsubscription cannot be automated.<br />- Automatic elimination of faulty addresses is not possible.<br />- Can not work for large lists of over several hundred people.<br />- Bulk messages can't be personalized.<br />- Impossible to mention personal details in bulk messages.<br /><br />Sending bulk email with Mac Mass Mailer<br /><br />You can use any good mass mailer for Mac made by a third party to send bulk email. You will have to find a buy one that does the job well though. You can get a good mass mailer for less than $99, so, yes, it's inexpensive.<br /><br />I use Mac Mass Mailer to send bulk email Mac. In the past I tried other mass mailers, and after spending hours of my time on testing them all, I chose Mac Mass Mailer. So Mac Mass Mailer is my best choice.<br /><br />Sending bulk email with Mac Mass Mailer is easy, and here are the basic steps.<br /><br />1. Download and install Mac Mass Mailer from <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.macmassmailer.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.macmassmailer.com</a><br />2. Launch Mac Mass Mailer for the first time, and New Email List wizard will pop over.<br />3. Follow the steps of the New Email List wizard to produce a new  email list.<br />4. Enter a title of a new recipient group, your FROM name and FROM email address.<br />5. Add one email address to this group (it's fine to use your own address for testing).<br />6. Input other information this wizard asks for (refer to help for more details).<br />7. Compose your bulk email message.<br />8. Enter outbound SMTP options (exactly the same options you use in Mac Mail).<br />9. When New Email List wizard completes, you can import your current subscribers.<br />10. To import, click on the Import button, and follow the steps of Import wizard.<br />11. You can now click the Start button to send messages to your recipients.<br />12. It takes some time to deliver your messages, watch the progress bar.<br /><br />Pros of Mac Mass Mailer:<br /><br />+ Simple to install, set up and utilize.<br />+ Works very well for big and extra large email lists.<br />+ Straightforward to maintain large mailing lists of up to 1 million users each.<br />+ Superb Import that lets your import people from any software and files.<br />+ Subscription and unsubscription is fully automated.<br />+ Automatically removes bad addresses from your email lists.<br />+ Your bulk email messages can be easily personalized with templates.<br />+ You can reference any personal information in your bulk messages.<br />+ Email list files are portable, and you can bring them with you.<br />+ Multiple SMTP accounts are supported to boost the number of messages you can send daily.<br /><br />Cons of Mac Mass Mailer:<br /><br />- Costs $97, which is a bit steep (however usability compensates it).<br />- No other cons.<br /><br />Therefore if you need to send bulk email Mac Mass Mailer is the best choice, and you should seriously consider buying a copy of it for yourself, even if your list is still small. Mac Mail has severe restrictions, and your email list will soon outgrow its capacity, so buying Mac Mass Mailer in advance is a wise decision, it saves time and nerves.<br /><br />Mac Mail can be dangerous. One simple mistake can expose your entire mailing list, if you by chance press a wrong button (&quot;To&quot; or &quot;CC&quot; instead of &quot;BCC&quot<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/wink.gif" alt=":)" />. Be careful, and never press a wrong button! Because it's a major privacy violation.<br /><br />This won't happen, if you use Mac Mass Mailer. Mac Mass Mailer always sends individual messages with only one email address in &quot;To&quot;.<br /><br />With Mac Mail you have to manually add new people in Address Book when they subscribe to your list, and you have to manually remove the ones who wish to unsusceptible. Also, Address Book does not remove dead addresses automatically, so every time you get those, you have to manually delete them.<br /><br />Mac Mass Mailer does it automatically. You click on the (Un)Subscribe button, Mac Mass Mailer checks your website for subscribe and unsubscribe requests, and updates your email list automatically. And yes, it also removes faulty email addresses from your list automatically.<br /><br />So Mac Mass Mailer is a much better alternative to Mac Mail!<br /><br />Get Mac Mass Mailer by clicking on this link:  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.macmassmailer.com%2Fsend-bulk-email-mac"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.macmassmailer.com/send-bulk-email-mac</a> .

It can also help you save a small fortune (which may explain why it's among the finest methods to advertise)!  Mass email marketing has been utilized in the industry for enough time now to have become a fairly sophisticated communication tool. It can be used not just to generate sales, but even to promote web site traffic and grow your brand at the same time. When utilized in a sophisticated and ethical manner, the effects are generally incredible!<br />Among the sometimes overlooked benefits to  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.imacmailer.com%2Fcategory%2Fmarketing"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.imacmailer.com/category/marketing</a>  is clear understanding of your market.  You'll see when your lists are affected by a specific offer or presentation style, and that could mean dollars in the bank! Certain approaches and merchandise will produce more favorable results than others. Businesses pay a lot of money to find this kind of information...and you have it totally free!<br />As Im sure you would probably guess, effective marketing campaigns are all about the folks within your mailing list. Mass email marketing produces ideal results after you establish a rapport with your subscribers. People, on the whole, have to trust you before they purchase from your business. Yeah, ok. There's a tiny fraction of folks that actually buy from spammed offers.  But the number is very, very minimal. The more time you spend developing a relationship with your list, the more successful you'll be.<br />Because your list is important, it's essential to have fantastic mailing list software.  What would you do if you've a list of prospective buyers 50,000 people strong? Would you be in a position to manage every one of them effectively? Mailing list software is the &quot;bread and butter&quot; of mass email marketing. True, you might type your emails and send these to your lists employing a program like Thunderbird or Outlook (and a few people do). Utilizing your desktop email client, however, is similar to cutting the lawn with shears.  It will take lots of time (and time is money), but you just will most likely not get optimum results.<br />What, you maybe asking, is a list? It's, in essence, just a directory of information about people. Nothing heavy. Many lists consists of just a first name and current email address.   Mailing list software is what allows you to create these lists and manage the information they contain. People on the lists are called subscribers. There isn't any magic behind why they're called this... they enrolled in your list! <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" /><br />Ok. So you understand what a mailing list is. But have you figured out what good mailing software resembles? It's lightning quick, reliable, and can handle very long stretches with a heavy work load easily. ...a lot like Lance Armstrong! But without the neat bike. Or speedos.  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" /> Sincerely, though.<br />All decent mailing list software enables you to create, edit, and delete e-mail lists, as well as assign them names and categories. Along with these simple list management features, most mailing list software enables you to add or delete subscribers yourself, and even change their basic information.<br /> Great mailing list software possesses features much like the ability to merge and split lists, to find and remove duplicate entries, offers automated backups and advanced search features (like pattern matching), and supports the creation and use of macros (repetitive tasks that you tell the pc do on your behalf). Youll also find subscriber functions like automatic subscriber management, email validation and name normalization (which is just a ten-dollar word for saying that you can make all names in a list capitalized or lower-cased automatically).<br />These features may well not seem that important if youre only starting out or only have a subscriber list or two with a couple-dozen subscribers. But as your business, and your list, grows having quality mailing list software will become increasingly important. <br />Mass email marketing and mailing list software are closely related. Mass email marketing is the execution phase of the marketing plan, but its your mailing list software that truly makes your campaign possible to begin with.  Choosing to use quality mailing list software is the initial step towards your successful marketing strategy.

I'd like to dedicate some of my time to explaining what bulk email is and what it isn't. Because, it looks like many people are mistaking bulk mail for spam.<br /><br />Differences between bulk email and spam<br /><br />Well, first of all spam is always unsolicited, it does not let people to unsubscribe from it, and it always advertises something or offers some kind of scam. As opposed to spam, normal bulk email is never sent without subscriber's consent. In case of a normal email list, people get on it and leave it by their choice. Very often, good bulk email messages do not use direct advertisement techniques. Instead, they provide subscribers with useful information, and notify them about special offers, and discounts.<br /><br />Normal bulk email messages give benefits to both receivers and senders, and the receiver usually benefits the most. The sole beneficiary of spam is always the one who sends it; and for the receiver, it's always a fly trap.<br /><br />Top 5 things to know about bulk email sending<br /><br />To send bulk email Mac Mail application or any mass mailer made by a third party can be used. Consider several important things before going ahead. You must:<br /><br />1. Store mailing list somewhere on your Mac system.<br />2. Add and remove subscribers from your email list on a regular basis.<br />3. Have the ability to import your current customers to your mailing list.<br />4. Have the ability to send out thousands of emails effectively.<br />5. Ensure you aren't exposing all list members in your messages.<br /><br />All the 5 conditions have to be met , no matter which way to send bulk email messages you choose.<br /><br />Mac Mail as mass mailer to send bulk email<br /><br />This method is completely free, employs only the standard software that comes with Mac OS X, and does not require installation of any other software products. You can use Mac Mail to send bulk email to small lists of up to several hundred people. And here is how you can do it:<br /><br />1. Open Address Book and then import your existing mailing list using the File--Import menu item.<br />2. Create a group in Address Book for your email list by pressing the [+] button under groups.<br />3. Highlight the Last Import group in Address Book, select all people there and then drag&amp; drop them to the new group.<br />4. Highlight the new group then add other people that were not on file using the [+] button below the list of people.<br />5. Launch Mac Mail and compose a new message by pressing the New Message button.<br />6. Click on the Address Book button located on the toolbar of the message editor displaying your new message.<br />7. Within the Address Book picker, select the group where you imported your list, then select all people in it.<br />8. Click the &quot;Bcc:&quot; button on the toolbar of the Address Book picker, to insert all selected people to the &quot;BCC&quot; list of the new message.<br />9. Write your bulk message, and then press the Send button in the message editor to send it.<br />10. In no time the message will be sent to your email server for delivery.<br /><br />If you hit Send in the messages editor to send bulk email Mac Mail just transfers the entire message along with its email list to the mail server. Now, it's up to the server to actually deliver your messages to all people on the list, it's not instant. It will take a considerable amount of time on the server side to create separate messages and forward them to recipient's mailboxes. This is how it works.<br /><br />Pros of Mac Mail:<br /><br />+ Totally free of charge.<br />+ You already have it.<br />+ Do not need install anything.<br />+ Is helpful for small lists.<br /><br />Cons of Mac Mail:<br /><br />- Difficult to maintain large mailing lists in Apple Address Book.<br />- Address Book import is not convenient and time-consuming.<br />- Subscription and unsubscription can't be automated.<br />- Automatic elimination of bad addresses is not possible.<br />- Can not work for big lists greater than several hundred subscribers.<br />- Bulk messages can't be individualized.<br />- Not possible to mention personal details in bulk messages.<br /><br />Using Mac Mass Mailer for sending bulk email<br /><br />You can use any good mass mailer for Mac made by a third party to send bulk email. It will require you to buy a mass mailer that will do the job. Mass mailers are usually cheap, and you can get a good one for $69 - $99 bucks.<br /><br />To send bulk mail Mac Mass Mailer can be used quite successfully, and I use it every day. I've tried other options in the past and they didn't work as good as Mac Mass Mailer did. So the best choice is Mac Mass Mailer.<br /><br />Sending bulk email with Mac Mass Mailer is easy, and here are the basic steps.<br /><br />1. Download and install Mac Mass Mailer from <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.macmassmailer.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.macmassmailer.com</a><br />2. Start Mac Mass Mailer the first time, and New Email List wizard will pop over.<br />3. Go through the steps of the New Email List wizard to produce a new dummy email list.<br />4. Enter a name of a new recipient group, your FROM name and FROM email address.<br />5. Insert one email address to this group (it's fine to use your own address for testing).<br />6. Input other information this wizard requests (read help for more details).<br />7. Create your bulk email message.<br />8. Enter outbound SMTP settings (the same options you use in Mac Mail).<br />9. As soon as New Email List wizard finishes, you can import your existing subscribers.<br />10. To import, click the Import button, then follow the steps of Import wizard.<br />11. Now you can click the Start button to send messages to your recipients.<br />12. It's going to take some time to send your messages out, watch the progress bar.<br /><br />Pros of Mac Mass Mailer:<br /><br />+ Easy to install, set up and use.<br />+ Performs quite well for large and extra large email lists.<br />+ Easy to manage big mailing lists of up to 1 million people each.<br />+ Excellent Import that lets your import people from any software and files.<br />+ Subscription and unsubscription is totally automated.<br />+ Automatically removes bad addresses using bounce backs.<br />+ Your bulk messages can be easily individualized with templates.<br />+ It is possible to reference any personal details in your bulk messages.<br />+ Email list files are portable, and you can bring them with you.<br />+ Multiple SMTP accounts are supported to boost sending limits.<br /><br />Cons of Mac Mass Mailer:<br /><br />- The price is $97, which is a little bit steep (however functionality compensates it).<br />- No other cons.<br /><br />So the conclusion here is, if you need to send bulk email from your Mac, consider buying Mac Mass Mailer, even if your list is still small. You will have to buy it anyway later once your email list gets out of control, and believe me, sooner or later it will, and you'll have to export/import your list users again.<br /><br />It's dangerous to send bulk email using Mac Mail. If you put your recipients in the &quot;To&quot; or &quot;CC&quot; field of your message accidentally, you will expose your entire email list, and anyone receiving your message, will see all members of the list. You should never do that ever! Since exposing personal information is a violation of the privacy act.<br /><br />With Mac Mass Mailer, this won't happen. Mac Mass Mailer generates separate messages for your recipients, and every message has only one address in &quot;To&quot;.<br /><br />With Mac Mail you have to manually add new people in Address Book when they subscribe to your list, and you have to manually remove the ones who wish to unsusceptible. Also, Address Book does not remove dead addresses automatically, so every time you get those, you have to manually delete them.<br /><br />Mac Mass Mailer does it automatically. Mac Mass Mailer regularly checks your mailbox for new subscribers, and for requests to unsubscribe, then it automatically updates your email list. If Mac Mass Mailer also checks validity of email addresses while sending, and if it finds bad addresses, it deletes them automatically.<br /><br />So thumbs up for Mac Mass Mailer!<br /><br />Get Mac Mass Mailer by clicking on this link: .

Make sure that everything you send is related. If you can smoothly blend your sales information into your free newsletters, your readers may not even notice that you are already selling something to them. As a natural solution to their problems, they will accept our product or sevice and will be happy to pay.<br /><br />A good example of that is a free newsletter about photography, where a marketer gives his subscribers useful tips and tricks, and reviews various digital cameras.

It was very hard to find any mass mailer that would work on Mac up until recently, but now the situation changed. Now dozens of mass mailers for Mac OS platform is available in the market. Just like any other things, you can also find good and bad mass mailers, and you have to know how to identify which one is the best for you. But let us talk about mass email and how you use it with Mac.<br /><br />A message sent to a large group of people or also known as email list is called mass email. People will usually subscribe to your email list if they find it useful, and at any time may leave it by unsubscribing from it. Often mass email messages contain macros in addition to text in order to reference recipient personal information such as name, birthday, order number and so on. In order to send unique messages with the recipient's name and other personal details on it, Mac machine will fix the macros while it sends mass email.<br /><br />Sending the same message to all your recipients is also possible, but it will just be ignored by most people as it will look spammy. Hence you will increase open rate by referencing personal information in your messages.<br /><br />Obviously, you can't send thousands of personalized messages with a regular email program. Mass mailer is all you need to have, and you need to send mass email messages rather than email messages.<br /><br />With only one difference, mass email messages look like a regular message. Macros such as RECIPIENTNAME or ORDERNUMBER are used by Mass email message, that why it's frequently called message template. While sending mass email message Mac machine replaces these macros with real information taken from recipient database, and thats how mass email message turns into a unique regular message when it hits recipients mailbox.<br /><br />Mass email message (message template) looks like the following:<br /><br />[Hi] [RECIPIENT NAME]!<br /><br />Dear Mark!<br /> Thanks for purchasing iPhone on December 12, 2010.<br /> Regards Jordan.<br />Also, I want to point out that not many mass mailers for Mac support message templates. So your messages will just end up in Junk folders because most of them will just send the same messages to all recipients.<br /><br />I experienced using a few mass mailer for Mac and discovered Mac Mass Mailer that can support message templates, offers a versatile database, as well as automates subscription, unsubscription and removal of bad address.<br /><br />Mac Mass Mailer checks your website before sending mass email for:<br /><br />Another subscribers willing to sign up for your list.<br />Unsubscribe requests.<br />Bounce backs because of dead addresses.<br />It will update your database then, by adding new people and removing the dead addresses as well as those who requests for unsubscription. Only then Mac Mass Mailer sends mass email messages. This guarantees that only those who want and can receive your messages will receive them.<br /><br />You may also check-out my site  for a lot more suggestions and information about mass email mac <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fcommunity.atom.com%2FPost%2FTips-in-Sending-Mass-Mail-Using-Mac%2F03EFBFFFF0246BADC0008017125E3"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://community.atom.com/Post/Tips-in-Sending-Mass-Mail-Using-Mac/03EFBFFFF0246BADC0008017125E3</a> .

By filling up a subscription web form, these recipients can join your email list and after that you can start sending email messages to them. As soon as your recepients click your &quot;unsubscribe link&quot;, they automatically leave your email list.<br /><br />You can absolutely use any email program including your regular email client such as Mac Mail or Microsoft Outlook in sending mass email, but there is no point in that, and Ill explain you why.<br /><br />Automating subscription, unsubscription, and removing of bad addresses are the other things that mass emailing software can do aside from sending mass messages. Regular email program cannot allow you to personalize your messages, and reference recipient personal information through macros, unlike mass emailing software.<br /><br />Mac Mail, Eudora, Microsoft Outlook, Windows Mail and other known email programs work with the standard Address Book which is built into the operating system. It is not designed for holding millions of recipients with thousands coming in and out every day and it's address book has a limited functionality.<br /><br />Compared with your standard Address Book    can work with a high-performance database which you can easily handle as well. It also offers a much better import and export functionality so you can move your existing email lists in and out easier.<br /><br />Many Mass emailing software is for sale on the internet, but you can actually find them all as good products. And if you are looking for one, you have to make sure that it does what you need and does it well. Most of these packages exist in 30-day trials, and before buying, you can thoroughly test the one you want to own.<br /><br />Another thing to consider is operating system you use. If you use both Mac and PC, you may need to get 2 different versions: one for Mac and another one for PC Since I am owning Mac Book Pro laptop with Mac OS on it, and my desktop computer is a PC with Windows, I use 2 different mass emailing software packages at the same time.<br /><br />I am using Mac Mass Mailer for my Mac Book Pro laptop, and Advanced Emailer for my Windows desktop PC.

Its also merely happens to be among the kindest to your bottom line. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" /> Mass email marketing has been utilized in the industry long enough now to have become a fairly sophisticated communication tool. It can be employed not only to generate sales, but additionally to promote online traffic and improve your brand also. When done right, it can produce remarkable results!<br />Although the primary advantage of mass email marketing is sales and promotion, theres also an additional benefit of market analysis. As your mailing lists grow in both size and organization, you can start to discover patterns in your subscriber responses. Certain approaches and products will produce more favorable results than others. Insights into this information can be a proverbial goldmine (or possibly less than proverbial)!<br />As Im sure you will probably guess, effective marketing campaigns are all about the individuals on your subscriber list. Mass email marketing produces ideal results when you build a rapport with your subscribers. Folks don't want to give money to business or individuals who they neither know nor trust.  Sure, there's a small percentage of people who will buy some gizmo with a spammed email. But the proportion is very, very small. The greater the time you spend building a relationship with your list, the more successful you will end up.<br />With so much riding on the list, having great mailing list software is paramount.  What good is a large mailing list if youre not able to effectively manage your subscribers or the messages that youre sending directly to them? Successful marketing campaigns begin and end with your mailing list software! True, you can actually type your emails and send them to your lists utilizing a program like Thunderbird or Outlook (and a few people do). Utilizing your desktop email client, however, is a lot like cutting the lawn with shears.  It will take a lot of time (and time is money), and you still will most likely not get optimum results.<br />So what, exactly, is an electronic list? At its most basic, its only a list of contact information, usually in the form of an email address. Nowadays, legitimate e-mail lists are opt-in, meaning that an individual actually asks to get added to your list. Mailing list software is what lets you create these lists and manage the data they contain. The people who have opted-in to your list are known as subscribers becausewell, they've (hopefully) subscribed to your list!<br />And what, exactly,  does good mailing list software look like? Well, its powerful, fast, and versatile (kind of like Lance Armstrongwithout the cool sunglasses or sponsors). <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" /> Seriously, though.<br />All decent mailing list software will allow you to create, edit, and delete mailing lists, as well as assign them names and categories. Along with these simple list management features, virtually all mailing list software allows you to add or delete subscribers yourself, and also change their basic information.<br /> Quality mailing list software gives you considerably more robust capabilities like list merges and splits, duplicate entry removal, automatic back up, advanced search features, and macros (which are simply tasks you teach the software to accomplish on your behalf). Youll also find subscriber functions like automatic subscriber management, email validation and name normalization (which happens to be merely a ten-dollar word for saying that you can make all names in a list capitalized or lower-cased automatically).<br />The more advanced options probably won't look like a big deal to you... specifically if you are just beginning or only have a handful of subscribers. But as your business, and your list, grows having quality mailing list software will become increasingly important. If you've already got a list bigger than a couple hundred subscribers, than you really need to make sure that the tools you are using are sufficient; not just for now, but in the future!<br />Mass email marketing and mailing list software are closely related. Although mass email marketing is the tool that does the work, mailing list software is the fabric that you're handling. The higher quality the material, the greater result, right?  A little extra research and, possibly, some extra coin invested in quality mailing list software goes a very long way towards making your marketing strategy successful.
