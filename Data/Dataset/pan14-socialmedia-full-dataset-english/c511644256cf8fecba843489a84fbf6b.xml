<br /><br />Ok about two years ago i had an iriver and it was worth about 700$, well i left it in my bag down the end of the close while i was skating and my mate rocked up on a motorbike and i was really excited about riding it that i forgot it was there. Well as we rode off on the bike we seen this guy mitchell (which i thought was a friend but hes not) well he was walking his dog and he was heading the way to my close (street) the way he always walks his dog. Anyways when i got back my iriver was gone ( yes i know its fukn stupid to leave it in my bag on the street so dont comment on that) So later i confronted him and asked him if he stole it coz he has a reputation for stealin shit and h e said he didnt but i got a feeling sorta like womans intuition that it was him but i left it coz i had no proof that it was him. I even offered him money if he found out who took it.
<br /><br />Now Last week my friend hes a painter was at work and his workmate said his iriver broke. So kerrod my mate asked him what sorta shit he had on his iriver and he said family guy, porn and boondocks and heaps of nigga beats which  was exactley what was on my iriver. So kerrod said that sounds like tullys iriver and asked him were he got it and his workmate said off his mate scabbers (Mitchell)and he found it in a bag down the end of a street. So kerrod said yep thats definitley tullys (Me) so his mats gonna bring it to work this week to give to kerrod to give to me. 
<br /><br />If it is mine what do you think i should do 
<br />Bash him for lieing to my face and stealing my iriver worth 700$  but potentially get a criminal record if he gos to the cops for me bashing him 
<br /><br />or 
<br /><br />should i tell the cops and let them try sort it out which they wont be able to coz i have no proof its mine except my friends word
<br /><br />Tell me

<br /><br />If you are under the age of 12... you shouldn't even read this. ...and if you do, you should not repost this.
<br />Just because you were born in '97 doesn't mean you're a 90s kid.
<br /><br />It's not like you could remember the original Simpsons. I am sorry but three conscious years of the 90s just wont cut it.

<br /><br />When Cops &amp; Robbers was a daily activity.
<br /><br />When we played Tiggy, Safe, 40/40 and Hide &amp; Seek until our legs grew numb.
<br /><br />You used to listen to the radio all day long just to record your FAVORITE song of ALL time.

<br /><br />You remember boom boxes vs. CD players (and thinking that CDs would never make it in the future).

<br /><br />I never quite figured out why the sexual urge of men and women differ so much. And I never have figured out the whole Venus and Mars thing. I have never figured out why men think with their head and women with their heart.
<br /><br />FOR EXAMPLE:
<br /><br />One evening last week, my girlfriend and I were getting into bed.
<br /><br />Well, the passion starts to heat up, and she eventually says, &quot;I don't feel like it, I just want you to hold me.&quot;
<br /><br />I said, &quot;WHAT??!! What was that?!&quot;
<br /><br />So she says the words that every boyfriend on the planet dreads to hear...
<br /><br />&quot;You're just not in touch with my emotional needs as a woman enough for me to satisfy your physical needs as a man.&quot;
<br /><br />She responded to my puzzled look by saying, &quot;Can't you just love me for who I am and not what I do for you in the bedroom?&quot;
<br /><br />Realizing that nothing was going to happen that night, I went to sleep.
<br /><br />The very next day I opted to take the day off of work to spend time with her. We went out to a nice lunch and then went shopping at a big, big unnamed department store. I walked around with her while she tried on several different very expensive outfits. She couldn't decide which one to take, so I told her we'd just buy them all. She wanted new shoes to compliment her new clothes, so I said, &quot;Lets get a pair for each outfit.&quot;
<br /><br />We went on to the jewelry department where she picked out a pair of diamond earrings. Let me tell you... she was so excited. She must have thought I was one wave short of a shipwreck. I started to think she was testing me because she asked for a tennis bracelet when she doesn't even know how to play tennis.
<br /><br />I think I threw her for a loop when I said, &quot;That's fine, honey.&quot; She was almost nearing sexual satisfaction from all of the excitement. Smiling with excited anticipation, she finally said, &quot;I think this is all
<br />dear, let's go to the cashier.&quot;
<br /><br />I could hardly contain myself when I blurted out, &quot;No honey, I don't feel like it.&quot;
<br /><br />Her face just went completely blank as her jaw dropped with a baffled, &quot;WHAT?&quot;
<br /><br />I then said, &quot;Honey! I just want you to HOLD this stuff for a while. You're just not in touch with my financial needs as a man enough for me to satisfy your shopping needs as a woman.&quot;
<br /><br />And just when she had this look like she was going to kill me, I added, &quot;Why can't you just love me for who I am and not for the things I buy you?&quot;
<br /><br />Apparently I'm not having sex tonight either....but at least that bitch knows I'm smarter than her.
