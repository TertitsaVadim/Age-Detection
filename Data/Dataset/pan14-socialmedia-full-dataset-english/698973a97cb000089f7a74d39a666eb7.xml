<br /> TWO homes were broken by burglars while the residents were asleep.
<br />At Block 354 in Bukit Batok Street 31, a woman in her mid-70s reported that her handbag with her cellphone and $120 in her living room were stolen.
<br />She discovered them missing on Saturday at about 6.45am. The living room window was opened, and the sliding window panel lock had been tampered with.
<br />In another household in Mayflower Road, a woman in her late 40s left the balcony door open when she went to bed at about 11pm on Monday night. 
<br />In the middle of the night, her daughter, in her mid-20s, saw a big-built man in her room,she thought he was her father and went back to sleep.
<br />About seven hours later, the family discovered that house keys, car keys in the living room and cash and valuables worth more than $10,000 missing.

<br />A physically weak child, she missed out on most sports.
<br />Then she became wheelchair-bound after fracturing her thigh bone in August last year.
<br />She also felt faint during her Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) this year.
<br />But Jia Wei, 12, persevered. With the results out yesterday, she topped her school, Evergreen Primary. Her aggregate score of 278 was the highest among her school's Primary 6 cohort of 487 pupils.
<br />Jia Wei said: 'My teachers had high hopes for me and I did not want to disappoint them.'
<br />She also attributed her success to the strong support that she received from her family.
<br />When she missed school for a month in January after surgery to strengthen her spine, her form teacher, Madam Linden Ng, 41, visited her home once a week to help her with her schoolwork.
<br />Madam Ng said: 'She took pride in every task or project. She really pushed herself.'
<br />In August last year, Jia Wei's mother, Madam Loke Wai May, 44, left her job as a human resource officer in the civil service to take care of her only child.
<br />Because Jia Wei's motorised wheelchair does not fit into the family car, Madam Loke and her Filipino maid had to wheel her from their home in Woodlands Drive to her school at Woodlands Circle every day.
<br />Jia Wei's top PSLE result was all the sweeter since her medical condition made her tired after studying for more than an hour at a stretch.
<br />She said: 'If I write for too long, my hand gets tired.' Despite this, she completed over 20 assessment books.
<br />Jia Wei's father, Mr Loh Yap Song, 48, an executive in a label-printing company, was visibly delighted at his daughter's achievements.
<br />But he had one worry. He said: 'She wants to go to Raffles Girls' School which is some distance away. Her wheelchair will fit only in a London cab. Transport will cost over $1,000 a month.'
<br />Mr Loh can take heart.
<br />Aware of her potential and family circumstances, the Tan Chin Tuan Foundation (TCTF), a philanthropic organisation, is exploring ways to help Jia Wei and two other disabled PSLE pupils at her school, through scholarships funds or bursaries.
<br />TCTF CEO Eric Teng added that it will be setting aside funds to champion similar deserving causes that may arise in other schools.

Four others are still missing in the tragic accident, and police are widening the search circumference.
<br />The families of the five Singaporeans have also been contacted, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) said in a statement on Saturday. The MFA said it is assisting with arrangements for family members to travel to Cambodia.
<br />'The 17 Singaporeans who were rescued were treated for minor injuries, discharged and are now resting in their hotel rooms,' it said.
<br />Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said he was 'saddened' to learn of the boating accident and of the five missing team members, the Prime Minister's Office said in a statement on Saturday. 
<br />'I share the deep concerns of the families of the five Singaporeans. The Singapore Government will do all it can to provide the necessary assistance,' Mr Lee said.
<br />'The SAF will be deploying a team to help in the search and rescue efforts. Some members of the families will be departing for Phnom Penh this afternoon, where they will be given an update on the situation.'
<br />'I would also like to express my sincere appreciation to the Cambodian authorities for the help they have rendered in rescuing the 17 Singaporeans and in the ongoing search and rescue operations,' he said.
<br />The 22 Singaporean rowers were taking part in the traditional dragon boat race in Phnom Penh. The New Paper reported that as the boat reached the docking pier, the rowers asked that the towing boat be untied to let them row for leisure.
<br />The boat subsequently hit a pot of swirling current in the Tonle Sap river and capsized.
<br />The accident occurred on the first day of races, which draw millions of spectators to the capital Phnom Penh.

<br /><br />But 30-year-old Zheng Wei Dong, who stands accused of this 'unprovoked, frenzied and vicious attack', claims she cannot remember what happened during the incident.
<br /><br />She may even have been sleepwalking.
<br /><br />On Thursday, two psychiatrists told a Hong Kong court that in their opinion, Zheng was not conscious of her own actions during the attack, reported the South China Morning Post.
<br /><br />Zheng and the victim, known only as Ms Yang, are both prostitutes.
<br /><br />Zheng told the police that on 15 Dec last year, she went to MsYang's room to offer her a slice of pear, which the latter rejected.
<br /><br />Zheng claimed that right after that, she became unconscious.
<br /><br />When she came to, she found that she was aching all over, and her left hand was bleeding.
<br /><br />Ms Yang, who was covered in blood, was running out of the room
<br /><br />Dr Yuen Cheung Hang, chief of the Department of Forensic Psychiatry at Castle Peak Hospital, said that based on a review of the facts and interviews with Zheng, he believed she had been in a state of automatism - basically sleepwalking - during the attack.
<br /><br />Dr Yuen said: 'From the information I have received (automatism) is the only conclusion I can come to unless she... was faking this condition.'
<br /><br />HARD TO FAKE
<br /><br />Dr Yuen added that Zheng would need to have a very good knowledge of this condition to fake it convincingly.
<br /><br />He said that the accused had several sleepwalking episodes as a child.
<br /><br />Dr Yuen said he had not completely eliminated an epileptic seizure as a possible cause of her apparent automatism.
<br /><br />But there was too little evidence to indicate the source of the problem.
<br /><br />Former government forensic psychiatrist Peter Yu Wai-tak agreed with Dr Yuen's conclusions.
<br /><br />Dr Yu said: 'I believe Zheng is telling the truth. The only conclusion is that... the acts were without conscious control.'
<br /><br />OBVIOUS CONFUSION
<br /><br />He felt that Zheng's obvious confusion right after the attack was typical of someone waking from a sleepwalking state.
<br /><br />She had called 999 and reported that she and Ms Yang had been attacked, and did not embellish her story.
<br /><br />Dr Yu said that cases of people becoming violent when sleepwalking were very rare but not unknown to medical science.
<br /><br />Prosecutor Frederic Whitehouse said that sleepwalking normally occurred when people were actually asleep.
<br /><br />To this, Dr Yu replied: 'I suspect she dozed off very quickly, in a matter of seconds, while still standing and went into a state of sleepwalking. People can doze off while standing.'
<br /><br />Mr Whitehouse then asked why Zheng did not wake up during what was a very violent and prolonged struggle with Ms Yang.
<br /><br />Dr Yu told the court it was his belief that Zheng was acting out a violent dream.

<br /><br />They found the water calm enough and were confident even using a different kind of boat for the Cambodian water festival race.
<br /><br />So after a discussion, they decided that they would be able to paddle faster and better without their life jackets, Rear-Admiral (Retired) Kwek Siew Jin, president of the Singapore Dragon Boat Association, said yesterday.
<br /><br />'They felt that conditions were benign enough for them not to have to wear the life jackets,' he said.
<br /><br />Speaking to reporters here, he said that had he known, he would not have allowed them to discard their life jackets.
<br /><br />In Singapore, for sure, that would not have been allowed. But life jackets were optional in the Tonle Sap race, and the team went with their decision.
<br /><br />RADM Kwek stressed that the paddlers were all very experienced, had a good assessment of the situation and were all strong swimmers.
<br /><br />'I tell you, these people are very comfortable in the water, with several years of experience. Otherwise, they can't make the national team,' he said.
<br /><br />'Look at the size of the captain. All of them have been training for years. If they are not rowing, they are training on weights.'
<br /><br />He said there would be 'a very thorough investigation', less to find fault than to find out how the tragedy could have been averted.
<br /><br />One answer, he said, might be to insist that paddlers wear life jackets in all competitions in future, no matter where they race and what the rules of the competition are.
<br /><br />RADM Kwek said that the 22 team members represented the cream of the crop in the sport, chosen from different dragon boating squads in Singapore.
<br /><br />They had hoped to make next month's South-east Asian Games in Thailand in the traditional boat race event, but the Singapore National Olympic Council turned them down.
<br /><br />Among other things, athletes or teams aiming for selection were expected to better or equal the third-placed timing of the last SEA Games to qualify.
<br /><br />The senior vice-president of the dragon boat association, Member of Parliament Lam Pin Min, said yesterday that the paddlers were invited by the Cambodian government in September to take part in the Tonle Sap races.
<br /><br />He said the team would probably have gone to Tonle Sap even if they had been selected for the SEA Games as it would have given them additional exposure.
<br /><br />RADM Kwek said the national squad members shared a fierce love and dedication for the sport, and spent so much time practising or working out that many were hardly home.
<br /><br />So when five of the men went missing on Friday, the others were devastated.
<br /><br />'In dragon boating, especially, the team spirit is very strong,' said RADM Kwek.
<br /><br />The deaths had left the surviving paddlers too distraught to speak to the media, he said, explaining why team members had refused to say anything to reporters all weekend.
<br /><br />The team is scheduled to leave Phnom Penh for Singapore this morning.
<br /><br />'We initially wanted them to go home as early as possible, but they requested to stay on because they wanted to know the fate of their team members,' he said.
<br /><br />He said the deaths of the five men were a great loss not only to their families, but also the sport.
<br /><br />'We were building up the national team. We hoped in the next few years, they could be good enough to compete internationally. Now, we have lost the services of five really good sportsmen,' he said.
<br /><br />He said he did not know all of the dead men personally.
<br /><br />'I usually meet them as a team, and you know how they all look the same - all big-sized and all beautifully built.'

<br /><br />The funeral will be held at the Mandai Crematorium on Thursday at 12.45pm.
<br /><br />This arrangement was made at the request of family members, since the five paddlers share many friends and acquaintances.
<br /><br />At a joint media briefing held by the Singapore Sports Council (SSC), Singapore Dragon Boat Association (SDBA) and the Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports (MCYS) on Tuesday, the three bodies also announced that an independent inquiry committee will be set up within a week to look into the incident.
<br /><br />Among its duties, the committee will conduct interviews with all involved, including the family members.
<br /><br />The panel is expected to put out a preliminary report within two months and the final report within six months.
<br /><br />The SSC will also conduct a post-mortem on the Singapore team's preparations for overseas competition, including safety issues.
<br /><br />COMPULSORY LIFE VESTS
<br /><br />The SDBA also announced that the wearing of life vests will now be made compulsory for all Singapore rowers in competition or in training, both locally and overseas.
<br /><br />Currently, this is only a requirement for local events, but not for overseas races - leading some to pose what-if questions, since the entire 22-men team involved in Friday's accident were not wearing life jackets.
<br /><br />On Monday night, the bodies of the five rowers were brought home in a military aircraft which arrived at about 11.45pm at Paya Lebar Airbase.
<br /><br />Family members were given time to offer prayers to their loved ones before bringing them back to their respective homes.
<br /><br />Defence Minister Teo Chee Hean and Community Development, Youth and Sports Minister Vivian Balakrishnan were at the airbase to give support to the families.
<br /><br />On Tuesday and Wednesday nights, the survivors of the tragedy plan to attend the wakes of their teammates as a team.

<br /><br />Most were moved to tears during the emotional 45-minute service in an open area outside the Mandai Crematorium as family members and friends of the five paid tributes to the five young men and spoke of how they had touched the lives of many who have known them.
<br /><br />The families of Mr Chee Wei Cheng, 20,Mr Reuben Kee En Rui, 23, Mr Jeremy Goh Tze Xiong, 24, Mr Poh Boon San, 27, Mr Stephen Loh Soon Ann, 31, have asked for a combined memorial service as the five paddlers had common friends.
<br /><br />Among those who came for the service were friends, colleagues, school mates and rowing buddies of the paddlers who drowned last Friday after their dragon boat overturned on the Tonle Sap River, as they were trying to dock at the pontoon just after a race in the annual Cambodian water festival.
<br /><br />In cracked voices, speaker after speaker in their eulogies held up the five paddlers as role models, filial sons and true friends, who had inspired those around them.
<br /><br />They also remember the happy times spent together, and spoke of their deep passion for dragon boating - which claimed their lives at their prime.
<br /><br />The tearful father of Rueben, Mr Freddie Kee, 53, said his family was proud of his son's accomplishments in the 23 short years of his life.
<br /><br />'We are thankful to have him for 23 years. We now have 23 years of memories in our heart,' he said in a choked voice.
<br /><br />While comforted by words that Rueben has gone to heaven, Mr Kee, a volunteer at the Seventh-day Adventist Church, said his son would not want to be in heaven if he could see how sad and devastated his mother and sister were.
<br /><br />He asked all those to 'smile like Reuben' if they miss him.
<br /><br />The younger brother of Mr Stephen Loh, who was in charge of squash, track and field in National Junior College, read out a poem written by a group of students in honour of their teacher.
<br /><br />Mr Gideon Loh said Stephen was a source of inspiration for many and he often went out of his way to help others.
<br /><br />In his tribute to Jeremy Goh, his brother described him as the 'live-wire' of any group he was with and said his infectious sense of humour would lighten up any situation.
<br /><br />Calling out the names of the five rowers, his parting words were: 'All five of you will have to take care of each other from now on and live just like what you did before.'
<br /><br />Team captain Yeo Chin Hwei, who delivered the final tribute, said the five will 'forever remain in our hearts'.
<br /><br />The memorial service ended with the observance of a one-minute silence.
<br /><br />The families then proceeded to different halls for the cremation

<br />Singapore's Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority (AVA) said today it had revised the regulations on plants that could be brought from Peninsular Malaysia to improve current measures to safeguard the health of plants in the country and minimise the introduction of exotic pests and plant diseases.
<br />Effective tomorrow, travellers could bring in up to three plants without potting medium or 250gm seeds or both per person from Peninsular Malaysia without an import permit from AVA and a plant health certificate (phytosanitary certificate), it said in a statement.
<br />At present, travellers who bring in any plant or planting material from overseas must obtain a phytosanitary certificate from the country of origin to certify that the plant or plant product is pest free.
<br />However, travellers returning from Peninsular Malaysia are allowed to bring in up to three plants with or without potting medium or 250gm seeds or both per person without an AVA import permit and a phytosanitary certificate.
<br />The AVA said travellers bringing in plants from Peninsular Malaysia must ensure that the plants were free from potting medium such as soil, sphagnum moss, peat moss and potting mix (combination of potting medium) before they were brought into the country.
<br />It said potting medium, if not properly treated, could harbour injurious microscopic worms which could cause poor growth and even death to the plants.
<br />These worms could multiply very quickly and spread to other healthy plants and would thus be detrimental to the plant health status of Singapore, it added.
<br />The statement said travellers who brought in plants in excess of the quantity allowed must obtain an import permit as well as a phytosanitary certificate and those who violated the regulations would have their plants confiscated and destroyed

<br /><br />IN ANOTHER sign of its increasing prominence, the rising cost of living dominated a dialogue on Sunday between Simei residents and Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports Vivian Balakrishnan.
<br /><br />From the first person to stand up - who asked how the Government would help the lower income deal with rising costs - questions on inflation came thick and fast.
<br /><br />By the end of the one and a half hour session, nine of the 16 questions and comments raised were on the topic.
<br /><br />A resident told of self-employed drivers who had difficulty maintaining their livelihood, and of young couples who could not afford flats.
<br /><br />A second wanted the goods and services tax on essential items removed; a third wanted a minimum wage scheme, while a fourth asked if the public transportation concession for senior citizens could be extended to include peak hours.
<br /><br />Dr Balakrishnan responded to the questions with the guarantee: 'No Singaporean will go hungry, no matter what happens to inflation.'
<br /><br />Inflation hit a 16-year record of 3.6 per cent in October, according to official figures, and is projected to rise further to as much as 5 per cent next year. Food prices, in particular, are set to rise further as supply prices soar.
<br /><br />Addressing residents' concerns, Mr Balakrishnan pointed out that 'external factors' such as political stability in the Middle East and a drought in Australia had driven up the prices of fuel and food.
<br /><br />What Singapore needed to do was to make sure the economy grows, that jobs are created and wages go up, he said. The Government was also letting the Singapore dollar strengthen to fight imported inflation.
<br /><br />He also pledged to make more money available to Citizens' Consultative Committees, the umbrella body for constituency level grassroots organisations that now receive on average of $42,000 a year from MCYS.
<br /><br />He urged these to come up with 'more innovative' schemes to help the needy and to be more flexible in their approach.
<br /><br />'If we can do it this way, we can have a system in which we don't waste and we don't promote abuse. But at the same time, we can respond flexibly and quickly to urgent needs on the ground,' he said.
<br /><br />He pointed out that a 24-hour hotline has been set up on 1800-222-0000 to tell people where and how to get financial help

<br /><br />This was the response of former post-blast investigation section head of the police forensic laboratory DSP Muhammad Koey Abdullah to questions on explosives.
<br /><br />He said this after he was pressed to answer numerous questions on explosives at the trial into the murder of 28-year-old Mongolian woman Altantuya Shaariibuu which entered its 66th day yesterday.
<br /><br />Chief Inspector Azilah Hadri, 31, and Cpl Sirul Azhar, 36, of the police Special Action Unit, are charged with the murder which involved the use of explosives between 10pm on Oct 19 last year and 1am the following day in a secondary jungle in Bukit Raja.
<br /><br />Political analyst Abdul Razak Abdullah Baginda, 47, is charged with abetting them.
<br /><br />Muhammad Koey, 46, was earlier asked by Azilah's lawyer, Datuk Hazman Ahmad, how much explosive would be needed to blow up Altantuya's body to bits.
<br /><br />&quot;Based on the high amount of RDX found, it was high explosion. In humans, there are many layers of medium that make up the human body,&quot; said Muhammad Koey.
<br /><br />&quot;In this case, in view of the absence of a crater, the amount of explosive was not much. If large quantities were used, there would be a crater.&quot;
<br /><br />Muhammad Koey also told the court that a claymore mine was not used even though a claymore mine wire was found at the scene. The wire was probably used as an accessory, he said.
<br /><br />Had a claymore mine been used, a crater would have been formed and ball bearings would have been found at the blast site, he said.
<br /><br />He also disagreed with Hazman's suggestion that a crater could have been formed had the explosives been placed on the body because a human body was soft, brittle and contained liquid.
<br /><br />Earlier, Muhammad Koey said that personnel with the Bomb Disposal Unit, General Operations Force and Special Operations Forces were taught basic skills in handling bombs.
<br /><br />After undergoing basic and advanced courses, they were still required to follow strict procedures and bound by directives of their commanders in the use of explosives.
<br /><br />Asked about a rubber tube found at the murder scene, he said it was probably brought there by other people for catching birds.
<br /><br />The trial before High Court Judge Datuk Mohd Zaki Md Yasin continues on Monday.
<br /><br />He earlier allowed an application by Razak's lawyer, Wong Kian Kheong, to recall CyberSecurity Malaysia's Digital Forensic head Aswami Fadillah Mohd Ariffin and Maxis Communications Bhd's Information Services and Billing engineer Goh Peng Chew on TV3 newscaster Mohd Izwan Azir Mohad Saleh's phone number that was initially thought to belong to Razak. -- Bernama

<br /><br />And as many Taiwanese would tell you, nothing beats being your own boss, no matter how small the business.
<br /><br />Little wonder why Taiwan, where entrepreneurship is alive and thriving, is dubbed the 'boss' island.
<br /><br />A Taiwanese joke goes: If you throw a stone in the streets, you are likely to hit an entrepreneur.
<br /><br />There is some truth to it, judging by figures.
<br /><br />Taiwan has one of the highest concentrations of companies in the world. There are about 1.2 million registered in the island of 23 million, according to Taiwan's Ministry of Economic Affairs.
<br /><br />That works out to one for every 20 Taiwanese.
<br /><br />Of these companies, close to 98 per cent are privately-owned small and medium enterprises (SMEs).
<br /><br />And for Taiwanese who are not yet their own bosses, they could well be on their way to becoming one.
<br /><br />According to a survey by 1111 Job Bank, a major Taiwanese recruitment agency, about 85 per cent of respondents had already started businesses, or were thinking of doing so.
<br /><br />The survey, conducted this year, polled 1,174 Taiwanese aged between 20 and 49.
<br /><br />The figure has remained above 70 per cent for similar polls conducted by the agency in the past two years.
<br /><br />If you ask me, Taiwan's ubiquitous di tan, or roadside stalls, are a good - albeit nascent - example of the island's vibrant entrepreneurial culture.
<br /><br />Armed with suitcases packed with merchandise, these enterprising Taiwanese are ready to do business any time, anywhere.
<br /><br />Although these makeshift stalls are illegal, they offer a training ground for young budding entrepreneurs, such as Ms Kuo Yu-han, to hone their entrepreneurial skills.
<br /><br />If she is not attending classes, the architecture undergraduate is most likely selling scarves and handsewn pouches on the streets in Taipei's downtown shopping district.
<br /><br />The 23-year-old started her little business venture more than a year ago, with a startup capital of just NT$3,000 (S$134.40).
<br /><br />'This is a good way to experience what it is like to run a business. And the best thing is I don't need to fork out money to rent a shop,' she told The Sunday Times.
<br /><br />Mr Ryan Wu, vice-president of 1111 Job Bank, identified two groups of Taiwanese who are most likely to start a business.
<br /><br />'Either young people below 28 years old, or those aged above 40 who are making a mid-career switch.' he said.
<br /><br />What drives the strong entrepreneurial culture in Taiwan?
<br /><br />'To begin with, being your own boss is something to be proud of in Chinese societies,' said Professor Liu Chang-Yung of the National Sun Yat-sen University.
<br /><br />The phenomenon is further boosted by Taiwan's prevailing social conditions, including a respect for material wealth.
<br /><br />Moreover, resourceful Taiwanese are used to seeking out opportunities for themselves, not having the luxury of turning to the government for help.
<br /><br />'Taiwan has a turbulent political history, from the early days of colonial rule to the more recent regime change in 2000,' said Prof Liu who teaches at the department of business management.
<br /><br />The regime change he was referring to was the 2000 presidential race when the Democratic Progressive Party ended the Kuomintang's five-decade grip on power.
<br /><br />'People were left largely to fend for themselves and find ways to make a living,' the scholar told The Sunday Times.
<br /><br />'That in turn nurtured a spirit of risk-taking, a crucial ingredient for entrepreneurship.'
<br /><br />The appetite for risks perhaps explains why many Taiwanese are still raring to give entrepreneurship a shot, despite sobering statistics pointing to a high chance of failure.
<br /><br />According to official numbers, about 10 per cent of SMEs fail to survive more than a year. Some 40 per cent of such businesses fold up within five years.
<br /><br />Ms Lu Jing-ying, for one, was not afraid to take the plunge when she decided to set up an Internet business selling fresh milkfish, a staple in her hometown in southern Taiwan.
<br /><br />Not to mention that the 38-year-old housewife has not worked a single day since she got married 12 years ago.
<br /><br />After attending a brief entrepreneurship course organised by the government, she started her own business with about NT$100,000 of her savings.
<br /><br />'Many people laughed when I told them I was planning to sell fresh fish on the Internet. But I wasn't afraid of failure,' she said.
<br /><br />There are also others such as Mr Yao Pen-jun, 36, who gave up his job three years ago to venture into the pet grooming business.
<br /><br />'Besides the usual services, I wanted to offer special training, such as 'pet etiquette' courses. I believe there is a demand for such services,' said the pet lover, formerly a trainer at an insurance company.
<br /><br />The relatively low costs of starting a business in Taiwan have also encouraged budding entrepreneurs to give it a try.
<br /><br />For instance, one can purchase the rights to set up a franchise store for as little as NT$30,000.
<br /><br />Many also choose to invest in 'micro-enterprises' such a beverages and breakfast shops, which require less start-up capital than SMEs.
<br /><br />Some say Taiwan's economic downturn has somewhat dampened its entrepreneurial drive in recent years.
<br /><br />But others point out that it has given rise to a new breed of 'necessity entrepreneurs', who are pushed into starting their own businesses because of the lacklustre job market and low pay.
<br /><br />According to the survey by 1111 Job Bank, 'unsatisfactory pay' was cited by most respondents as the key reason for starting their own business.
<br /><br />The average income of Taiwanese has stayed stagnant or even declined over the past few years.
<br /><br />Recent official statistics showed that up to 77 per cent of Taiwanese companies did not increase their employees' pay last year - a trend which has persisted for the past five years.
<br /><br />'Some people may think: the economy is so bad. If I set up a small noodle stall, at least I won't starve to death,' said Mr Wu of 1111 Job Bank.
<br /><br />Fresh university graduates are especially hard hit.
<br /><br />Their average starting pay is about NT$26,000 a month - roughly the amount graduates were paid 10 years ago.
<br /><br />And even if they are willing to settle for less pay, they may not land a job.
<br /><br />In the first nine months of this year, the unemployment rate among Taiwanese aged between 15 and 29 was 7.6 per cent - almost twice the average jobless rate of 3.92 per cent.
<br /><br />That has driven many young Taiwanese such as Ms Heidi Huang into striking it out on their own.
<br /><br />Ms Huang, who studied design in the university, quit her magazine design assistant job three years ago to sell handmade dolls and accessories.
<br /><br />That decision has paid off for her. 'I used to draw about NT$30,000 in my previous job. Now I make three to four times more,' said the 26-year-old.
<br /><br />Observers noted that the profile of Taiwanese entrepreneur is getting younger, and more highly educated.
<br /><br />'In the past, graduates would prefer to join the civil service or big companies,' said Prof Liu.
<br /><br />'But nowadays, more and more graduates are choosing to become their own boss.'
<br /><br />Amid Taiwan's economic gloom, a vibrant entrepreneurial spirit remains a bright spot.
<br /><br />The island's economic growth has hovered around 4 per cent in recent years, trailing the other three Asian Tigers - Singapore, South Korea and Hong Kong.
<br /><br />Said Prof Liu: 'For Taiwan to repeat its economic success, it must transform itself into a truly entrepreneurial society.'

<br /><br />In a side-effect, the cloned cats glow in the dark when exposed to ultraviolet beams.
<br /><br />A team of scientists led by Kong Il Keun, a cloning expert at Gyeongsang National University, produced three cats possessing altered fluorescence protein (RFP) genes, the Ministry of Science and Technology said.
<br /><br />'It marked the first time in the world that cats with RFP genes have been cloned,' the ministry said in a statement.
<br /><br />'The ability to produce cloned cats with the manipulated genes is significant as it could be used for developing treatments for genetic diseases and for reproducing model (cloned) animals suffering from the same diseases as humans,' it added.
<br /><br />The cats were born in January and February. One was stillborn while two others grew to become adult Turkish Angoras, weighing 3kg and 3.5 kg.
<br /><br />'This technology can be applied to clone animals suffering from the same diseases as humans,' the leading scientist, Mr Kong, told reporters.
<br /><br />'It will also help develop stemcell treatments,' he said, noting that cats have some 250 kinds of genetic diseases that affect humans, too.
<br /><br />The technology can also help clone endangered animals like tigers, leopards and wildcats, Mr Kong said. -- AFP

<br /><br />This bad influence came from her father, an alcoholic of more than 20 years.
<br /><br />It was a dangerous hobby that has led Jane, now 17, down a path of alcoholism for six years.
<br /><br />She would drink daily at home and would even buy beer on the way home from school.
<br /><br />Sometimes, Jane (not her real name) drank in full view of her parents and family members, who didn't stop her.
<br /><br />Six years of incessant drinking soon took a toll on her health and her studies.
<br /><br />It also turned Jane into a problematic child who couldn't get along with her schoolmates and neighbours.
<br /><br />Luckily, her school counsellor found out about her problem and sent her to the Institute of Mental Health for treatment.
<br /><br />Since 2005, an average of about 400 people, including youths like Jane, seek help from IMH for alcoholism yearly, reported Lianhe Wanbao.
<br /><br />STARTING YOUNG
<br /><br />This year from April to September, there have been 322 people - of which 271 are men and 51 are women - who sought help.
<br /><br />If the figures continue their rise, it would beat last year's figure.
<br /><br />From April 2005 to March 2006, 475 people sought help and between April 2006 and March 2007, that figure was 416.
<br /><br />So far, the youngest this year was a 14-year-old boy, compared to a 17-year-old and a 15-year-old in 2005 and 2006 respectively.
<br /><br />Similar studies in other countries have shown a similar trend of youths becoming addicted drinkers.
<br /><br />A UK survey in September showed that 1 out of 10 children aged 11 to 13 years old are alcoholic.
<br /><br />In Thailand, about 1 million youths aged between 9 to 11 years old drink regularly.
<br /><br />Another alcoholic who sought help from IMH was Jack (not his real name).
<br /><br />The administrative executive, who began drinking at 16, was proud of his ability to hold his liquor well among his friends.
<br /><br />But the addiction soon got the better of him as the newly-wed found himself becoming more short-tempered.
<br /><br />FAMILY BREAKDOWN
<br /><br />His increasing expenditure on alcohol also upset his wife, who later separated from him.
<br /><br />As a result of his marital breakdown, Jack couldn't focus on his work, leading to his eventual dismissal.
<br /><br />The series of events woke him up from his stupor and Jack decided to seek help from IMH.
<br /><br />Young alcoholics are more at risk of developing alcohol-related illnesses because their body immune systems are not well developed yet, said a doctor from IMH.
<br /><br />Said the doctor: 'It's easier for youths than adults to become alcoholics.
<br /><br />'Some of them even mix alcohol with other substances such as sleeping pills, ketamine and glue.
<br /><br />'Without timely intervention from adults, these youths could become multi-substance alcoholics, who may find it harder to kick the addiction.'
<br /><br />Counsellors The New Paper spoke to say that they are aware that those drinking are getting younger.
<br /><br />Mrs Veronica Eng, 48, a counsellor at Fei Xiang Youthlink Services, said that the two main reasons are peer pressure and easy access to alcohol.
<br /><br />The youths tell her they want to try what others are indulging in and can buy the alcohol from convenience stores.
<br /><br />Some start from as young as 12, she said, and they buy these drinks before they watch football or during their barbecues at chalets.
<br /><br />Said Mrs Eng: 'Even if there is an age limit to buying drinks, they can get someone else to buy it.'
<br /><br />Once the youths satisfy their kicks from bottles they buy at the convenience stores - which usually have lower amounts of alcohol - they progress to harder stuff, she said.
<br /><br />POPULAR CULTURE
<br /><br />Ms Sheena Jebal, chief executive of Nulife Care &amp; Counselling Services, said the teens could also be influenced by popular culture.
<br /><br />Some youths think it is cool to drink because their screen idols drink in movies, she said.
<br /><br />One youth also shared with her about how he wanted to overcome his shyness and drank to become bolder while another decided to show off his drinking prowess by gulping down more than he should in front of his girlfriend.
<br /><br />She said: 'Parents have to lead by example. It is a modelling behaviour. Youths follow what they see, especially when parents don't have a close watch.'
<br /><br />What good is it if a parent drinks heavily and tells his child not to drink, she asked.
<br /><br />Added Ms Jebal: 'Whatever it is, parents should just learn to spend more time with their children, communicate effectively and draw boundaries.'
<br /><br />Agreeing with her is a father of two boys, Mr Rodney Tan, 53.
<br /><br />Mr Tan, whose sons are aged 17 and 20, said: 'We need to remind them that drinking is not about who can gulp down the most. That's immature. They have to know that it can be an intoxicating substance and it has to be handled responsibly.'
<br /><br />He said that when his older son turned 18, he allowed him to drink a little during a festive occasion and then educated him on ill-effects of over-drinking.

<br /><br />Ticketing officer Jamiah Sirat, 58, and Indonesians Ms Meilani Koesmadji, 43, and her mother Madam Yvonne Koesmadji, 61, were walking towards their car after shopping at Jaya Jusco Permas, near Pasir Gudang, when the robber struck.
<br /><br />He snatched Ms Meilani's handbag and dragged her along for over 10m before speeding off. She had scratches on her arms, abdomen and face.
<br /><br />The assistant manager of a real estate firm in Jakarta said yesterday: 'I was too shocked to feel anything. I knew only I was in trouble and wanted to go home as soon as possible.'
<br /><br />Besides her and her mother's passports and identity cards, she also lost $350, five million rupiah (S$770), two ATM cards, six credit cards, two mobile phones and a digital camera. She made a police report in Johor.
<br /><br />Her woes did not end there. The Indonesian consulate in JB was closed over the New Year holiday period. So she had to stay for three nights at the Johor home of Madam Jamiah's relative before she could get a temporary passport issued on Wednesday.
<br /><br />Madam Jamiah said she regretted suggesting the Johor trip to her friends of over 20 years, who were visiting after a decade.
<br /><br />'This was my first trip to JB in four years. I hadn't dared to go there after reading newspaper reports on the crime rate but braved myself,' she said. 'It was my Indonesian friends' first time to JB and this had to happen to us. We will never go there again.'

<br /><br />Eight days after a minister admitted that a sex DVD featured him, anti-spy electronic devices are being sold like hot cakes, especially to people in power.
<br /><br />Former health minister Datuk Seri Dr Chua Soi Lek's revelation that he and a woman had been secretly filmed while having sex has led to many trying to avoid a similar fate.
<br /><br />More than 1,000 such devices that can detect hidden CCTV cameras and handphones, have been sold here since news of Dr Chua's indiscretions made headlines.
<br /><br />It is learnt that several prominent businessmen and politicians who visit China regularly on work or on holiday have been using the device in their bedrooms.
<br /><br />Even a minister has bought a unit &quot;as it is very difficult to identify one's enemies, especially in politics&quot;.
<br /><br />&quot;People who are out to topple you in politics will resort to anything including recording or filming who you see and what you say,&quot; he said.
<br /><br />His RM160 unit will emit a beep if it detects electronic devices such as CCTV cameras and hidden handphone usage within a radius of 10 metres.
<br /><br />The minister, who did not want to be identified, said many were flocking to outlets selling electronic items to buy such devices.
<br /><br />The device which the minister uses to sweep a room is a little longer than a cigarette lighter and can detect any RF frequency device within 3GHz.
<br /><br />The person who sold the device to the minister said he had run out of stock due to overwhelming demand.
<br /><br />&quot;I do not have any more in stock due to heavy demand from people, including politicians, corporate figures and women,&quot; he said, adding that he was accepting orders for the device.
<br /><br />The device is also available at popular online auction websites like <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.lelong.com.my"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.lelong.com.my</a>.
<br /><br />A check by the New Straits Times revealed a number of people selling such devices in the past week.
<br /><br />One online seller using the pseudonym Eagle833 offered the device for RM120 each with the title, &quot;Spy Camera Detector -- HOT IN TOWN -- GET IT BEFORE (getting) TRAPPED!&quot;.
<br /><br />MCA public services and complaints department head Datuk Michael Chong, who bought a similar device on Sunday, said his first attempt to purchase one at a shop in Jalan Pasar failed.
<br /><br />&quot;I later got it through a friend who had the last one. Apparently, it's out of stock in most outlets.&quot;
<br /><br />The RM50 made-in-China unit that Chong bought can detect hidden CCTV cameras within a 50cm range.
<br /><br />&quot;I have to move around if I want to check if there is a hidden CCTV camera inside my room. If there is, it will emit a warning sound.&quot;
<br /><br />He said he has advised people, especially women, to buy such units &quot;as they can be filmed in the toilet or dressing room&quot;.
<br /><br />Chong said there were several brands on sale, from the lower-end type that he bought, to high-end models that cost several hundred ringgit.
<br /><br />Deputy Health Minister Datuk Dr Abdul Latiff Ahmad advised people to use the gadget to protect their privacy.
<br /><br />&quot;I won't buy it as I do not need it but people who feel threatened should get it.&quot;
<br /><br />Asli/Centre of Public Studies chairman Tan Sri Ramon Navaratnam said the authorities should step up efforts to counter invasion of privacy.
<br /><br />&quot;There is a basic fundamental right of privacy enjoyed by everyone.
<br /><br />&quot;Intrusion into privacy will actually undermine the safety and security not only of individuals, but also those in the public and private sectors.&quot;
<br /><br />He hoped the police will bring those responsible for the invasion of privacy in Dr Chua's case to book.
<br /><br />&quot;Given the deterioration of values in our society, I can understand why these camera detectors are becoming popular,&quot; said Navaratnam, who is also Transparency International chairman.

<br /><br />HE is afraid to go out for fear of being mistaken for wanted terrorist Mas Selamat Kastari.
<br /><br />He has been pointed at and stared at and, on one occasion, even surrounded by a group of men while they called the police.
<br /><br />His children have been asked if their father is the fugitive.
<br /><br />The 40-year-old man, who wanted to be known only as Mr Halim, said: 'Mas Selamat may have escaped, but now, because of him, it feels like I'm in prison.'
<br /><br />At first glance, Mr Halim's facial features resemble Mas Selamat's - based on the mugshots on posters all over Singapore - right down to the short, wavy hair.
<br /><br />The father of four, who does not walk with a limp, said he has been getting dirty looks from people.
<br /><br />Mr Halim said he and his family have decided to avoid going out unless necessary.
<br /><br />The construction foreman and his civil servant wife have three sons, aged 11, 10 and 8. The couple also have a 6-month-old daughter.
<br /><br />Mr Halim told The New Paper on Sunday in Malay: 'Now, our daily route is simply to go to work or school, and then go home.'
<br /><br />Even the family's regular weekend visits to the hypermarket for their groceries have been canned. For the time being.
<br /><br />'If we need to get something from the shops, my wife will do it while I wait for her in the car,' he said.
<br /><br />Mr Halim said that, thankfully, they have a family car.
<br /><br />'Otherwise, I dread to think what it will be like if we had to take public transport.'
<br /><br />The family's plans to visit his mother in Kuala Lumpur this week during the school holidays have also been shelved.
<br /><br />'I don't want to put my family and myself in a difficult spot,' he said. 'It is really ridiculous, even though we understand why people react this way.'
<br /><br />Mr Halim acknowledged that 'in some ways, it is good because it shows that Singaporeans are keeping their eyes open'.
<br /><br />But he hopes that the fugitive can be caught soon.
<br /><br />AWKWARD
<br /><br />Since Mas Selamat's escape on 27 Feb from Whitley Road Detention Centre, there have been at least six occasions when MrHalim have found himself in awkward situations.
<br /><br />Mostly, different groups of people would deliberately walk past or around him.
<br /><br />But last Sunday, a group of men cornered him and called the police.
<br /><br />This despite the fact that he's 1.69m tall and does not walk with a limp. Mas Selamat is 1.58m tall and walks with a limp.
<br /><br />Mr Halim was waiting for his wife and children outside Khatib MRT Station. He was dressed in a shirt with a collar and bermudas.
<br /><br />He recalled: 'A man approached me somewhat cautiously and asked for the time. I knew at once what was on his mind.'
<br /><br />As the man talked, Mr Halim noticed he was also gesturing to his friend, who stood about three arms' length behind them.
<br /><br />He said: 'It was clear that the man's friend was about to make a call.'
<br /><br />While Mr Halim tried to explain the misunderstanding, he realised that the man's other friends had positioned themselves at three different spots.
<br /><br />Two others came forward and one asked him bluntly: 'So, are you Mas Selamat?'
<br /><br />Just as Mr Halim produced his identity card to prove his innocence, his wife and children arrived.
<br /><br />He recalled: 'At the same time, two police officers also approached us. They were very professional and after verifying my particulars, we could go off.'
<br /><br />While Mr Halim appreciated the group's alertness, he admitted that he was also frustrated by the unfortunate resemblance.
<br /><br />He said: 'It's so awkward that I'm wondering if I should go for plastic surgery.'
<br /><br />Mr Halim refused to be photographed.
<br /><br />'We've been inconvenienced by the whole issue, I don't want it to get worse with more Singaporeans being 'alerted' to my face,' he said.
<br /><br />'It will upset my children further if people decide to put my photo side by side with the wanted man.'
<br /><br />One of the men who confronted him, 35-year-old retail manager Wylie Wee, said: 'We were quite shocked when we first saw him at the station.
<br /><br />'We thought, hey, that is Mas Selamat. But because we were not too certain, we observed him for a while.
<br /><br />'We noticed that other passers-by also did a double-take when they saw him.
<br /><br />'It turned out to be a misunderstanding. Well, the good thing is, we've now made another friend.'
<br /><br />A day after the incident, Mr Halim, his wife and his second son went shopping at Mustafa Centre and the stares continued.
<br /><br />His son overheard a woman mention 'Mas Selamat' to her companion when they were at the cashier.
<br /><br />The boy said: 'I knew without turning around that they were talking about my father.
<br /><br />'I was so 'malu' (embarrassed) and angry.'
<br /><br />He had to endure the same thing in school too.
<br /><br />The son said: 'Even schoolmates who see my father when he drops us off at school have told us that he looks like the wanted man.
<br /><br />'But my parents have told us not to be too upset and to explain it nicely to ourfriends.'
<br /><br />The boys have learnt to offer their schoolmates this reasoning: 'Our father has been around even before Mas Selamat escaped from the detention centre.'
<br /><br />Last Thursday, The New Paper had reported that the public had called the police after spotting Mr Md Iqbal Hussain near Mustafa Centre.
<br /><br />Mr Md Iqbal, 28, who walks with a limp, is from Bangladesh and is here to seek treatment for elephantiasis.
<br /><br />After the tip-off, the police conducted a door-to-door search for him at a block of flats in St George's Lane where he was staying with a Singaporean friend.
