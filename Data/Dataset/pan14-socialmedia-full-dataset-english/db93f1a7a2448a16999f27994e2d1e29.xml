The best and most effective way to treat flu is by preventing it in the first place. How?

<br /><br />An ideal facial cleanser feels silky smooth and leaves no residual traces after cleansing. It should also be anti-allergy and offers 100% cleansing power with zero agitation. It should be able to get rid of all facial dirt, aged cutins, sebaceous secretion, perspiration and makeup and give us clear unclogged pores to facilitate efficient absorption of skin-care nutrients. A cleanser with thick lather could be caused by the presence of excessive soap-base thickener which may have little nutritional content. So don't ever think &quot;the more lather, the better&quot;.

<br /><br />Colon, or colorectal, cancer is cancer that starts in the large intestine (colon) or the rectum (end of the colon). Most cases of colon cancer begin as small, noncancerous (benign) clumps of cells called adenomatous polyps. Over time some of these polyps become colon cancers. According to the American Cancer Society, colorectal cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths in the United States. The good news is, early diagnosis often leads to a complete cure. What are the risk factors and how do you reduce them?

<br /><br />Do you cook? What do you use to enhance the flavors or taste of your food? Salt? Oyster sauces? MSG? Gourmet powder is a common type of food flavouring that contains monosodium glutamate (more popularly known as MSG) as its main composition. Though MSG has long been classified as a safe food ingredient by the US Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA), its use and impact on the human health remains controversial. Jia Hor Seasoning is a formulation that is of 100% natural origin and does not contain any chemical additives. As such, in contrast to other food flavourings, it will never bring about such side-effects as thirst, headache, listlessness or hair loss.

Many of us put much trust in the FDA as a regulator of the safety and effectiveness of drugs in order that the people can confidently consume the drugs prescribed to them. However, events that have happened over the last few decades make this assumption not necessarily always true. So what option do we have?

<br /><br />My friend cancelled his lunch appointment with me. Why? Coz he's stuck in bed, sick with &quot;flu, sore throat and a bit of fever&quot;. Which triggered me to post this story.<br /><br />I have suffered from colds and flu many times over the years.  I would normally recover from my runny nose, fever and sore throat after a couple of weeks. But my cough would linger on and on and on, up to 2 months or more. <br /><br />I read that long-term consumption of Lingzhi and Pollen is very effective to enhance one's immune system so that one doesn't fall sick so often. And when one does, the recovery rate is much faster. Really?<br /><br />Well. It was put to test last week. This is an account of my shortest flu experience that I can ever remember.
