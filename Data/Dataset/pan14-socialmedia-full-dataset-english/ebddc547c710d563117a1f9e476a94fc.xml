Am I the only one that thinks that is totally stupid? (As the title clearly stated) When I see that I think: &quot;Hey, anyone can do it. Trust is based on a sms-ed number to Spain? and Why does it cost anything? and why are people doing it? COME ON PEOPLE! Do you really feel safeer with random cell phone owning, number texting, paying, people? I know I'm not. In fact those kind of people give me the hee-bee-gee-bees! That's my two cents, and I want it back!

<br /><br />I'm not bitter at my life, I just feel I should be doing more then what I feel comfortable doing. I've let myself get numb in the comforts, of being alone. I need not the warm of others, so I pass them by, unsure if I'm the only one they'll see today. Here today. 
<br />I am growing in God's grace, but the point is sharp to get me to move. Move. I'm moving to a new place, and growing up to a new place too. Moving requires me to change, I like what I'm becoming but I'm not there yet. It is much harder to trust and just do, then to be told exactly what I need to do, and do it. I wonder if I would, if I knew the whole picture. Knowing to much I might run away, staying in my comfortable living. Is that living? Living a life worth dying for. Easier typed then lived. It's late, I'll be reseting the cycle, sleep.

<br /><br />Schedules bordered by timelines. Time giving meaning to money. With an endless amount of time money would only replace thing we would not want to do, ever. But then what would we give people that were willing to do these things? Money? Who would take it? Or would the cycle instead be exchanges for things we never wanted to do? Our endless time would then be spent doing things other people hated to do, so that we could pay someone else to do something we hated to do. We would get stuck in a world of endless suffering to avoid a different suffering. Strangely this is not completely unlike our world now. We work to make money to buy food, clothing, and such. But what if we took the time instead to grow our own food, and make our own clothing. We spend time doing often abstract things, to get money to buy stuff. While some stuff we could never make ourselves, and it takes all the time other people have to make that stuff, so they can't grow or sew and make these things. So in a way, we work to make money to get things we can't make ourselves. So really the whole system we all are a part of relies heavily on the fact that we want things we can't make ourselves, and we are willing to do things we hate to avoid doing other things we would hate doing more. Bizzare.

I am looking for a cartoonish element in the works. I need surreal backgrounds &amp; environments, and characters; full body turn-arounds and facials. For a guide I am looking for generic people character in many outfits, surreal dream monsters, and depictions of the following: rogue news helicopters, ax wielding professors, concrete blocks for hands and feet, stuck in a giant gerbil ball, dimensionally unsound ninjas, living trees, defying gravity, dinosaurs in the city, slowing down time, medieval combat, and snowflakes the size of buildings. Since the game is based in a dream world almost all work is acceptable. Thank you; your help would be greatly appreciated.

Everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God. 8Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love. 9This is how God showed his love among us: He sent his one and only Son[b] into the world that we might live through him. 10This is love: not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son as an atoning sacrifice for<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/coolbox.gif" alt=":)" /> our sins. 11Dear friends, since God so loved us, we also ought to love one another. 12No one has ever seen God; but if we love one another, God lives in us and his love is made complete in us.
<br /><br />13We know that we live in him and he in us, because he has given us of his Spirit. 14And we have seen and testify that the Father has sent his Son to be the Savior of the world. 15If anyone acknowledges that Jesus is the Son of God, God lives in him and he in God. 16And so we know and rely on the love God has for us.
<br />      God is love. Whoever lives in love lives in God, and God in him. 17In this way, love is made complete among us so that we will have confidence on the day of judgment, because in this world we are like him. 18There is no fear in love. But perfect love drives out fear, because fear has to do with punishment. The one who fears is not made perfect in love.
<br /><br />19We love because he first loved us. 20If anyone says, &quot;I love God,&quot; yet hates his brother, he is a liar. For anyone who does not love his brother, whom he has seen, cannot love God, whom he has not seen. 21And he has given us this command: Whoever loves God must also love his brother.
<br />1 John 4:7-21

		<document id="83883bf2416cff60960795486ec7b7db" url=""><![CDATA[Worth reading.<br/><br/>More then just a verse. True story: I was at Living Hope Church, and the praise team leader was saying that even though it didn't fit with the sermon she felt lead to read part of Psalm 147 &quot;calls them each by name&quot;... then my dad went up to lead the prayer, and eariler was reading Psalm 147 but wasn't going to read it because it didn't fit with the sermon, but with the other's reading it felt lead to read it, and said &quot;I'm not sure who this is for, but God want's us to focus on this&quot; So, I bring it to you. Is God trying to tell YOU something?
<br /><br />Psalm 147
<br /><br />1 Praise the LORD. [a]
<br />How good it is to sing praises to our God,
<br />how pleasant and fitting to praise him!
<br /><br />2 The LORD builds up Jerusalem;
<br />he gathers the exiles of Israel.
<br /><br />3 He heals the brokenhearted
<br />and binds up their wounds.
<br /><br />4 He determines the number of the stars
<br />and calls them each by name.
<br /><br />5 Great is our Lord and mighty in power;
<br />his understanding has no limit.
<br /><br />6 The LORD sustains the humble
<br />but casts the wicked to the ground.
<br /><br />7 Sing to the LORD with thanksgiving;
<br />make music to our God on the harp.
<br /><br />8 He covers the sky with clouds;
<br />he supplies the earth with rain
<br />and makes grass grow on the hills.
<br /><br />9 He provides food for the cattle
<br />and for the young ravens when they call.
<br /><br />10 His pleasure is not in the strength of the horse,
<br />nor his delight in the legs of a man;
<br /><br />11 the LORD delights in those who fear him,
<br />who put their hope in his unfailing love.
<br /><br />12 Extol the LORD, O Jerusalem;
<br />praise your God, O Zion,
<br /><br />13 for he strengthens the bars of your gates
<br />and blesses your people within you.
<br /><br />14 He grants peace to your borders
<br />and satisfies you with the finest of wheat.
<br /><br />15 He sends his command to the earth;
<br />his word runs swiftly.
<br /><br />16 He spreads the snow like wool
<br />and scatters the frost like ashes.
<br /><br />17 He hurls down his hail like pebbles.
<br />Who can withstand his icy blast?
<br /><br />18 He sends his word and melts them;
<br />he stirs up his breezes, and the waters flow.
<br /><br />19 He has revealed his word to Jacob,
<br />his laws and decrees to Israel.
<br /><br />20 He has done this for no other nation;
<br />they do not know his laws.
<br />Praise the LORD.

<br />Idea number 1: the grammatically implications of &quot;I love you too&quot;. This is often used and accepted after someone states &quot;I love you&quot;. This of course is completely whack! (mmm, old slang) Stating &quot;I love you too&quot; would only work after the first person stated that they love themselves. Since the second person is adding their vote to the pot. You love you, and then &quot;I love you too&quot;. The &quot;too&quot; is what throws the whole thing off. Substitutable with &quot;as well&quot; too means a sort of tag on to the previous idea. However the first person stated that they loved you (or whoever) and then the second person is saying that they love the first person as well when the first person was not in the conversation at all. So, to wrap up &quot;I love you too&quot; should only be used after someone says &quot;I love me,&quot; otherwise it is out of place, and frankly just wrong. 
<br /><br />Thank you, this has been, mmmblog.

So, being a man of action figures, (they are not dolls!) I figured I would take some time out of my day to type up something worth reading. (It was a note to go buy some more bread, because I was out.) But this is just a blog. Blah-og. Just the same I think it will at the very lest do nothing, and at the very most give you all a sense of what I mean by, &quot;hello, please get off my shoe.&quot; What I mean of course is that 'you' is implied and that 'you' are on my shoe, and quite frankly making a mess of my sneakers, so push off, and be on your way. Or just step off my runners. In other news the same old thing is happening. Ironic to be sure. So there you have it, a blah-og. Now on to higher things. Clouds. White fluffy, push overs that don't stand for anything, and just move with the winds of time. Some look good. Some look dreadful, but all are by nature about to ruin your picnic. I think we both know clouds look a lot like many things, and many people. 
<br />With time passing by, it is high time I be off, and you be on the go. So I bid you ado, and goodbye. Until next time, look both ways before you tie your shoe.

		<document id="3f5d4062d16cedc70157dc59357e7b02" url=""><![CDATA[English 1 oh, 1<br/><br/>Two day we are going two explore the great mysteries of the English Language. 
<br /><br />First, the lack of English words that are phonetic. With this said do not get mispronunciation mixed with poor phonetic words. Example: “are” and “our” are not homophones; they are not pronounced the same. It is R, and ‘ow’-R. However hour, and our, are homophones, which means the “h” is silent (shhh, quiet.) [The “h” in hour would do well working in a library.] Along with silent “h” comes silent “k”. Interestingly this silent letter is used most often to bring variety in our written language. For example, knew &amp; new. “I knew that was new, I just didn’t know they had it now.” “No? Huh.”
<br /><br />Also, how did “gh” and “ph” make an “F” sound? (In case you are wondering it is an “F” not a “F” because the correct spelling of “F” starts with a vowel and is pronounced as a vowel. That magic silent “h” is working its stuff against other letters. And ‘ “I” before “E” except after “C” ’ is one of the worst grammatical ideas. (Wikipedia helped here: science, sufficient, agencies, financier, their, foreign, being, neither, weird, vein, seize.) 
<br /><br />Likewise, try to follow the phonetics of this: -t, -ti, -tio, -o, -on, -ion, -tion. 
<br />And then there was read. Turn to the closest person and read this next part to them and then have them read it to you, or if you are alone just yell it out loud several times. “I read the red book under the red tree by the reeds.” Or “I reed the read book under the read tree by the reads.” Or “I read the read book under the read tree by the reads.” 
<br /><br />Enough with the big words, here are some English words that I think are so poor they should be rewritten in the next dictionary (that series never seems to fail, what are they up to now, 78? and I mean the plot is still as bad as the first one.): Lamb, Wednesday, nation, and island. 
<br /><br />Here is an interesting thing you may not have known:
<br /><br />WRONG&gt;spitting image RIGHT&gt;spit and image MEANING&gt;The very spit of someone is an exact likeness. &quot;The spit and image&quot; or &quot;spit image&quot; emphasizes the exactness.

<br />Well now that that is over I can do something I had planned to do: Blab, and make a log of it= mmmblog, the “mmm” comes from the delicious aftertaste. So read on, and enjoy. 
<br />We live in a very zone based world. We have set up zones and allow certain behaviour in them, such that if the same behaviour was exhibited elsewhere it would be greatly shunned upon. (That said anything regarding privacy should be kept in its zone, I am speaking of public behaviours. So don’t go changing in the middle of the street, you’ll get hit or cause an accident.) Some of these zoned behaviours are: dancing, hugging strangers and singing aloud. 
<br />DANCING: 
<br /> NO- if you are the only one that can hear the music, and you’re not alone 
<br />	NO- If there is music playing that everyone can hear, but the light levels are high 
<br />	YES- If there is music playing that everyone can hear and the light levels are poor to blinding, interchangeably. Then the dancing zone is activated, otherwise moving to music is cause for awkward stares. I say we break this zone and dance regardless of light levels or available music. 
<br /><br />HUGGING STRANGERS: 
<br />	NO- on the street
<br />	NO-Waiting for a bus
<br />	YES- While watching “your” favourite team succeeds in some manner. Such that if you are in a sports bar during playoff season around other fans=OK, but if you are in a mall during Christmas season around other shoppers=NOT OK. 
<br /><br />SING ALOUD:
<br />	[If you are bad at singing all zones are void, (I am sorry to get your hopes up.)]
<br /><br />Word Time:
<br />While these words are not University level, they are interesting and full of meaning beyond their definitions: -STOMP– ZANY –TODAY –AWKWARD –PAIN –RIGHT –FAMOUS –OLD –FEAR –VOMIT –FOOD 
<br /><br />This mmmblog’s word is bissextile: relating to the extra day of the leap year.
<br /><br />Did everyone enjoy their bissextile day in 2004? I hope you did. 
<br /><br />Till later.
