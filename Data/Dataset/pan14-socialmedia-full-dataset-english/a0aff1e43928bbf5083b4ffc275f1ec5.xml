Of course Darin himself, like almost everyone who uses e-mail regularly, must have made his own email mistakes - perhaps a wrong attachment, a wrong email address (autofill is a convenience, but you really have to pay attention!), unintentional use of 'reply all', or indiscreet contents that might be regretted only nanoseconds after clicking the 'send' button. But even though his mistakes may not have experienced the same degree of consequences as his red-handed friend's, they were enough to inspire Darin to do something about the problem, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5vZmZpY2lhbHRpZmZhbnljb3Nob3AuY29t" target="_blank">Tiffany Jewelry outlet</a> and that is how he came up with the idea for BigString.<br /><br />BigString Corporation now offers BigString 3.0, a web-based e-mail service that gives the user control over sent mail - even once the mail is delivered to the recipient.
