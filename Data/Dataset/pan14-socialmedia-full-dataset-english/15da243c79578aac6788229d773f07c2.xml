In other words, creatine works well.<br /><br />With that being said, there is a lot of false information around creatine supplements and quite a few people find themselves lost with regards to how to take creatine.<br /><br />This short article can assist all such individuals by explaining them how to take creatine and get the most out of this great supplement. <br />Let’s start…<br /><br />How To Take Creatine: 5 Clear Steps<br /><br />1) Which form of creatine is ?<br />Creatine monohydrate is the best form of creatine and there is not a single study that shows any advanced kind of creatine to be better than the original form.<br /><br />Creatine monohydrate continues to be the best and all the “advanced forms” hype is merely created to advertise the high-priced goods.<br /><br />2) How much creatine should you consume?<br />Don’t fall for the those marketing campaigns that tell that you have to consume 10 grams of creatine daily to see the results. It is just a marketing hype that businesses are using to sell more goods.<br /><br />For most people 3 grams daily is adequate to completely saturate the muscles with creatine. To fulfill your requirements a little less than 1 teaspoon of creatine would be enough.<br /><br />3) When should I consume creatine?<br />There are 2 main recommendations you’ll hear on this one. Whilst there are some people who advise taking creatine prior to workouts, there are those who claim that it is better to take creatine after workouts. <br /><br />&lt;img width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fnaturalcreatine.files.wordpress.com%2F2011%2F07%2Fcreatine5.jpg%26quot"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://naturalcreatine.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/creatine5.jpg&quot</a>; /&gt;<br /><br />The reality is that it actually makes no significant difference when you consume it.<br /><br />It is a complete false impression that creatine has immediate effects; it does not. All you have to do is help your body in achieving full creatine saturation after which creatine will be readily available when your muscles require it. Therefore there is essentially no benefit in taking creatine just before workout.<br /><br />Furthermore, ultimately all the creatine will be absorbed in your body it doesn't matter when you take it. Taking creatine post-workout may allow for quicker absorption, but faster absorption doesn’t give any special benefits.<br /><br />At the end of the day, it’s not going to make any change. You only need to take 3 grams of creatine whenever you want it, regardless of whether it is in the morning, in the noon or in the night.<br /><br />4) What should creatine be mixed with?<br />The guideline that is usually adopted and appreciated about taking creatine is combining it with something high in sugar content. The idea here is to make use of the simple sugars to “spike&quot; your levels of insulin, which will then enhance the absorption of the creatine.<br /><br />But we have already mentioned it that faster absorption of creatine has no certain advantages. If you consume your creatine with 30 grams of simple sugar daily then you will consume around 840 calories in a week. You will end up with a lot of extra fat if you don't take care of tracking the carbs that you are consuming.<br /><br />&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2F1G8__LgFSHs%26quot"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/embed/1G8__LgFSHs&quot</a>; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;<br /><br />I mean that you can combine your creatine with whatever you want. Juice, tea, crystal lite, water, it really doesn’t make a difference.<br /><br />As you have seen, the question of how to take creatine is eventually rather straightforward. You just need to follow all the tips in this post to consume creatine in the correct way and get the most advantage out of it.<br /><br />To read more detailed details on <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2VsaXRlaW1wYWN0bGFicy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvaG93LXRha2UtY3JlYXRpbmUtNS1lYXN5LXN0ZXBz" target="_blank">how to take creatine</a> take a look at <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2VsaXRlaW1wYWN0bGFicy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvaG93LW1hbnktY2Fsb3JpZXMtZ2Fpbi1tdXNjbGU_" target="_blank">check out this page</a>
