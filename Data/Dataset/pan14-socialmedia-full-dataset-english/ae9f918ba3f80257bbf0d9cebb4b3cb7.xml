I sit alone and try not to cry becuase I feel like an ugly guy. No one around here will even give me a hug the damned bunch of emo punks. I hurt sometimes so deep it almost makes me weep. I really am a complex person and want to be near someone who will at least try to understand me and love.

I have for the most part been forced into isolation for my life and need to be out and about in the world or I know I am going to die of boredom. I feel a lot like plants that don't get a lot of light and water only my light is freedom and people where my water is experiences.

<br />with a broken wing,
<br />and not even know,
<br />simply because my,
<br />sense of touch went cold.
<br />So here I sit in the dark,
<br />unable to even see,
<br />whether or not the people,
<br />I know truly love me.
<br />Most people I know,
<br />refuse to even let me grow,
<br />to some of them I am a fool,
<br />but to all of them I am a tool.
<br />So I try to find a way out,
<br />to find a way to at least date,
<br />so I can feel better about myself,
<br />and get away from a town full of hate.
<br /><br />I finally got rid of my writers block and wrote this poem and no it does not apply to anyone online.

I wanted comfort but see so little except the ground beneath my feet and my head full of dreams, some of greatness and a world pure others just for me to at least feel loved. Not many people see the full me all the sides and pieces of this puzzle and labyranth that is Harold Micheal Thomas Audinwood. I try to hide my full complexities to show to only one the person who has earned my love. I am always lost and confused just one person would help so much to have a person in my corner to love me so and to know all there is to know. I hoped not to ask for to much but I have had enough.

Each and every person I know and care for my friends, family, coworkers, almost everyone. Yet not many people know even the most caring and uplifting spirit might need help of their own. I have spent my life watching the lives of others helping them with their problems but I have no one to sit back and make me feel warm and cozzy all over again. No one to fill me with the hope I need to help others and to lift even my hope up off of his feet. I would easily be able to do so many things only needing his presence. I have no talent for seeing the future but my dreams are big and I know this person would fit perfectly with me. I will end this on a particular note saying only sometimes a light goes out and needs to be relit.

		<document id="bdaa53e050aa74ade7d6c84fd50783bf" url=""><![CDATA[Labels get my head to hurting esp. involving me...<br/><br/>I have been under so much stress of late and been thinking over almost every single thing people have talked to me about involving me and who I am. I have never once dated anyone at all and I was trying to to think for some reason as to what type of role in a relationship i would play and it has been very confusing. I am extremely emotional (which is supposed to be a femi thing {as if there are some pretty strong women}), yet I won't give into pressure to do things I don't want to and could easily be stronger, I want to feel loved and would have trouble with even the littlest let down (mostly my life has felt like a let down one more might be too much), I trust people sometimes to easily, if I felt like I fell in love then my entire heart would be theirs, &amp; I get mad and am willing to scare the person who made me mad if not kill them. I have come to one conclusion and that is &quot;It doesn't matter what the label is I am who I am and that is it!&quot;

I have never felt so alone even with my family around but then agian not one of them listen to me so that shouldn't suprise me. I just get tired of never feeling loved in the least or anything of much of any sort (to anyone who thinks it I DON'T do drugs or alcohol or anything like that). It is just a huge family war with me being some shitty weapon to be used against the otehr members. I have no friends who treat me as a real friend they only enjoy getting money and presents from me. My family bashed my entire existence to me thinking very little of my self. I have also never had enough freedom to be able to date anyone. I just am getting so tired of existing yet not being enough to be human even though I have the biggest heart of enyone I know in person. I just need someone.

It makes me feel like I am a lot lighter then the american method.
<br />Also I moved recently so I should try to change that on here in just a bit but well I remembered something so I had to get that done first before I forgot.
