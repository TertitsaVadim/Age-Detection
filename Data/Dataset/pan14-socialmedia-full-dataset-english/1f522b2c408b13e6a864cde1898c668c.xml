<br /><br />Despite scandal and fraud charges, another Rob Dyrdek donation has resulted in the groundbreaking of a Street League-style skate park on the public dime.<br /><br />Erie, Colorado began construction on what it says will be the first “certified” public Street League course in the country. Street League is a for-profit skateboarding competition series that generates revenue for Rob Dyrdek and his affiliate corporations, like Monster Energy Drink and California Skateparks, a construction company run by Dyrdek’s Street League partner Joe Ciaglia. The Street League championships take place this weekend in Newark, NJ, with $200,000 in prize money, as well as a diamond-encrusted watch and ring set worth $100,000. Single tickets go for up to $169. <br /><br />The public funding of Erie’s $1.1 million Street League course saw opposition from its Board of Trustees, notably from Mark Gruber, earlier this year.

<br /><br />We previously wrote about the Swift-Cantrell Skatepark and a potential legal issue with California Skateparks. There have been a number of additional websites and blogs written since the time we originally wrote.  Many of the websites do not seem to provide factual basis for their allegations so we thought we would see if there is any truth to the claims that California Skateparks may have been less than forthcoming with some of their information to the City of Kennesaw.<br />On May 26, 2011, California Skateparks and Joseph Ciaglia Jr. submitted a formal bid for the Swift-Cantrell skatepark Bid and Proposal. On page 3 of the city’s RFQ, the standard line states: “d. Provide a list of litigations or arbitrations where claims have been brought against the contractor in the last 5 years and outcome of each.” Joe Ciaglia responded, “d.  No litigations or claims have been brought against our company in the last 5 years.” In fact, there were two lawsuits.

<br /><br />Internal correspondence recently circulated within the City of Los Angeles' Parks department reveals that the contract to build a skatepark in Kennesaw's Swift-Cantrell park may be in jeopardy over fraudulent business practices on behalf of California Skateparks, for which Rob Dyrdek serves as a front man.<br />In a letter from the general manager of the LA Parks Department to its board, a non-successful bidder seeks to have LA's contract with California Skateparks (CS) abandoned due to, among other things, CS's failure to disclose pending litigation as was required by the terms of the project's RFP.

<br /><br />Celeb skater Rob Dyrdek is under fire for an alleged laundry list of felonies related to the construction of skate plazas all across the country. Criminal complaints filed with authorities in Los Angeles contest a “series of ’sole source’ [contract] awards to California Skateparks,” a construction company run by Dyrdek’s business partner Joe Ciaglia. Allegations say the basis for L.A. giving Ciaglia contracts to build Street League-style skate plazas in public parks all over the city were “contingent offers of donations made [by] the Rob Dyrdek Foundation.” The two self-proclaimed friends are financial partners in Street League, a commercial series of skateboarding events. Not disclosing their financial interests to the city is a felony, say the charges.

<br /><br />After his copyright tiff with the Hells Angels, the last thing Rob Dyrdek needs is more legal woes. But according to Celebsleaze.com it looks like Rob's lawyers are going to have their hands full this year. Newly released Los Angeles city documents show that Dyrdek has been named in a criminal complaint case that alleges he and his business associate, Joe Ciaglia (of California Skateparks), have been linked to a number of felony crimes such as &quot;fraud, perjury, collusion and bid-rigging in the construction of skate parks all over the city&quot;.

<br /><br />When the city of Kennesaw selected California Skateparks during the bid process several years ago, many residents and taxpayers had concerns over this selection. The $50,000 donation from Rob Dyrdek seemed too good to be true and when asked, there was never any details about any future fundraising although most of his contract required that he be involved in bringing in money for the park. Well, it’s of no surprise then, that we saw articles about a “sham” foundation and business involving Rob Drydek. He’s being named in lawsuits.<br />Kennesaw Skatepark is named in allegations of multiple felonies against Pro Skateboarder Rob Dyrdek and his business associate Joe Caglia, president of a construction company, California Skateparks.

<br /><br />Bloggers in Kennesaw, Georgia have published what seems to be blatant fraud connected to Rob Dyrdek’s charitable donations. Evidence suggests illegality in construction bids from Dyrdek's partner Joe Ciaglia of California Skateparks. The Kennesaw skate plaza deal is typical of how the two have built around two dozen skate plazas across the country. In general, Dyrdek proposes to donate a design he says is worth $50,000, conditional to California getting the contract to build. Rob and Joe are financial partners in a number of skate-related ventures.<br /><br />In Ciaglia’s May 2011 bid for the $1.2 million Kennesaw contract, a standard line reads, “d. Provide a list of litigations or arbitrations where claims have been brought against the contractor in the last 5 years and outcome of each.” Ciaglia answered, “d. No litigations or claims have been brought against our company in the last 5 years.” In fact, two lawsuits have been found.
