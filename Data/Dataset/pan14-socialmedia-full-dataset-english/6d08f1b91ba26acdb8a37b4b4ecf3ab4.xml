In 2010-11, Pargo played in the Israel Premier League and averaged 10 points, 3.5 rebounds and 6.3 assists in 27.1 minutes.''Our approach remains consistent as we try to bring in young talent, create future opportunity with draft picks as potential assets, and maintain flexibility,'' Cavaliers general manager Chris Grant said. ''Jeremy adds depth to our backcourt. He is a young, aggressive, athletic guard who we feel fits well with our style of play, both defensively and offensively.''Kennedy appeared in two games for the Cavaliers last season and averaged six points, 3.5 rebounds and 1.5 assists.
<br /><br />The Minnesota Timberwolves are finalizing a two-year, $20 million contract with free-agent forward Andrei Kirilenko after helping facilitate a three-team trade that sent Phoenix’s Robin Lopez and Hakim Warrick to the New Orleans Hornets, league sources Lopez agreed to a three-year, $15.3 million contract in a sign-and-trade agreement with the Hornets, league sources.The second year of Kirilenko's contract will be a player option.The rest of the deal included the Timberwolves sending small forward Wesley Johnson and a lottery-protected first-round draft pick to the Suns, sources said. Brad Miller’s expiring contract goes to the Suns, while the T'wolves receive Jerome Dyson and two future second-round draft picks from New Orleans.Lopez,<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jbm1hbGw2Ni5jb20vcHJvZHVjdHMvTmlrZS1GcmVlLTUuMC1uMTE0N19wMS5odG1s" target="_blank">Nike Free 5.0</a> a restricted free agent, is returning soon from a vacation to take a physical for the Hornets.

He ruled out the Brooklyn Nets and Russian billionaire owner Mikhail Prokhorov on Tuesday because the Nets simply couldn’t pay him beyond the veteran’s minimum of $1.2 million, sources said.Minnesota signed another Russian, point guard Alexey Shved, to a free-agent contract.

<br /><br />Before their current strategy for lifestyle sneakers bloomed along with the rest of this now hugely significant portion of the market, Jordan Brand promoted many of their non-performance looks as pre- or postgame sneakers. So just as they’ve explicitly set aside models like the CMFT series for their casual benefits, the Jordan RCVR lets you know that these were designed for relaxation and recovery right in their name. The above pictured pair comes in one of the classic Jumpman standbys: a royal blue, black and white combo reminiscent of an original Air Jordan 1.  It’s a colorway that echoes the blue shade from that just-dropped Air Jordan X and more or less perfectly matches the preferred palette at Lexington, Kentucky’s Oneness. Warm weather in spring and summer is ideal for training,<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jbm1hbGw2Ni5jb20vdmlld3MvSm9yZGFuLVJDVlItNjYyNTMuaHRtbA__" target="_blank">Jordan RCVR Old  Royal</a> both for the sunny season sports and those you’ll be playing come wintertime.  Jordan Brand hopes to help with the former aspect, offering a casual cooldown sneaker whose quick slip-on appeal has quite a few applications for the active lifestyle. The Jordan RCVR is coming up later this month with a new Wolf Grey and Gym Red colorway that’s a bit more versatile in its matching potential than your average Chicago Bulls palette.

<br />China saw their bid to claim all the Diving gold medals ended last night when Russia's Ilya Zakharov pulled off a sensational victory in the men's 3m Springboard.But world champion Chen ensured normal service resumed again as she topped the score sheets with 392.35 ahead of tomorrow morning's semi-final.Malaysia's Pandelela Rinong Pamg was her nearest rival, some 43.35 points behind, but Chen still found reason to be disappointed.'I feel it's all right. Two dives, I feel, were not really under control - the second and the fourth,' she said.'Before every dive the whole routine goes through my mind.'Germany's Christin Steuer, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jbm1hbGw2Ni5jb20v" target="_blank">Nike Zoom Rookie</a> a last-minute inclusion for injured team-mate Nora Subschinski, was third ahead of Australians Brittany Broben and Melissa Wu.'I found out yesterday lunchtime I was competing,' Steuer said.'I was the reserve, and when Nora wasn't getting better, I just jumped in.'I got third place, so that's good. I didn't see the competition, I didn't even see my own dives. I was surprised to reach third position.'Australia's 16-year-old hopeful Broben said: 'I could have dived a lot better tonight but I'm hoping to save it for the final.'
<br />It doesn't feel like the Olympics but when I saw the big London 2012 on the bottom of the pool, that's when it hit me.'I suppose I would like to get a medal but there are a lot of strong competitors so I haven't really thought about it.'  The world number one had stormed through the opening rounds, and stopped her semi-final early with a convincing 19-7 victory over Lucija Zaninovic of Croatia.Yague Enrique, a three-time world champion herself, had come from behind in her semi-final with an amazing late rally against Chanatip Sonkham.The 31-year-old - who missed the Beijing 2008 Games through injury - soon trailed again,<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jbm1hbGw2Ni5jb20vcHJvZHVjdHMvS2V2aW4tRHVyYW50LU5ldy1LRC1JVi0tbjE0Nl9wMS5odG1s" target="_blank">Nike Zoom KD IV</a> as Wu opened up a 4-0 first-round lead.This time, there was no way back as the 25-year-old Chinese fighter closed out what was in the end a comfortable 8-1 victory.Thailand's Sonkham, who had beaten number two seed Shu Chun-Yang of Chinese Taipei in the quarter-final, claimed bronze with victory over repechage winner Elizabeth Zamora Gordillo of Guatemala, who had lost to Wu in the first round.Zaninovic - whose twin sister Ana fights at -57kg tomorrow - picked herself up to win the other bronze when she beat Mexican Jannet Alegria Pena on golden score.

<br />But once the hoopla and ''Beat L.A.!'' chants quieted down, two questions loomed in the building that honors the U.S. Constitution: Would Bynum put his John Hancock on a possible-five year contract extension; and how will his achy knees respond to treatment next month in Germany?Bynum is set to make $16.1 million this season in the final year of his deal. If he waits until after the season, Bynum can sign a five-year deal worth nearly $102 million. No other team could offer Bynum as many years or as much money.''I enjoy Philly,<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jbm1hbGw2Ni5jb20v" target="_blank">Air Max Penny 1</a> I'm from here, I don't see anything wrong,'' Bynum said. ''I don't see any problem why I wouldn't want to stay here.''Bynum is set to have injections of plasma-rich platelets that supposedly stimulate healing in arthritis-affected areas in both of his knees. Bryant, his former teammate, has credited the therapy with dramatic improvement in his own troublesome right knees and an injured left ankle.Sixers president Rod Thorn said Bynum and his surgically repaired knees checked out fine after a lengthy physical on Tuesday.''You've got to take calculated risks sometimes,'' Thorn said. ''Players of his level don't come on the market every day.''Bynum is coming off his best NBA season after averaging career highs with 18.7 points and 11.8 rebounds while making his first All-Star team, starting for the West. He was the NBA's third-leading rebounder and 20th-leading scorer, while also ranking sixth in the league with 1.93 blocked shots per game.
<br /><br />Bynum also avoided the injuries that have dogged him throughout a seven-year career since the Lakers made the New Jersey high schooler the youngest player ever drafted in 2005. Bynum played in 60 of the Lakers' 66 regular-season games, missing four due to suspension.Ah yes, that suspension.Bynum may be the best center in the East, but he brings a touch of baggage that shouldered him with a reputation as being a handful,<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jbm1hbGw2Ni5jb20vcHJvZHVjdHMvUGVubnktSGFyZGF3YXktSUlJLW4xNTM4X3AxLmh0bWw_" target="_blank">Penny Hardaway III</a> as well as a monster rebounder. He was busted three years ago partying at the Playboy Mansion posing with a girl on his shoulders during his rehab from a torn knee ligament.Bynum served a four-game suspension this season for his vicious fouls against J.J. Barea in the Lakers' final playoff game last spring.He's has declined to participate in certain team huddles, sitting down the bench by himself. He once slapped hands with opposing fans while taking a long time to leave the court after he was ejected from a game last season in Houston.''I think somewhere along the line, maybe he said a couple of immature things here and there, but everybody has,'' Sixers coach Doug Collins said. ''I'm sure he'd be the first one step up and say, 'Hey, I messed up.' The unfortunate thing in life, when you make a mistake like that, it's one video replay from living it again.''The Sixers would prefer more replays of Bynum's 30-rebound game like he had last season against San Antonio.Except for some minor tinkering with the deep bench players, the Sixers should be finished with their roster overhaul. They added Bynum, Richardson, Brown, Royal Ivey, Dorell Wright and Nick Young to a team counting on returners Evan Turner, Jrue Holiday and Thaddeus Young to help make that second-round exit the start of something big, not a one-season wonder. 
<br /><br />Penny Hardaway is one of the most popular athletes. Over the course of his career he wore some of the most popular Nike basketball models and had a very successful signature line. In his prime he was one of the best players in the NBA and a perennial All-Star. He is most famous for his time with the Orlando Magic and Phoenix Suns, but also played for the New York Knicks and Miami Heat. In the early days Penny wore shoes such as the Nike Air Go LWP and Nike Air Up.The Air Penny III was Anfernee &quot;Penny&quot; Hardaways third numbered signature shoe which he wore briefly during his Orlando Magic career. The Air Penny III which features a &quot;posite&quot; upper has a liquid look to them so, many have nicknamed them &quot;liquids&quot;. Unfortunately,<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jbm1hbGw2Ni5jb20vdmlld3MvUGVubnktSGFyZGF3YXktSUlJLVdoaXRlLUJsYWNrLTY2NjIyLmh0bWw_" target="_blank">Penny Hardaway III Silver Black</a> the Penny III saw very little court time due to the devastating left knee injury incurred early in the 1997-98 season. This pair of basketball shoes named Nike Penny Hardaway III(3) Shoes In Black/Silver, it belongs to Penny Hardaway III Shoes. And it was used the foamposite and stands for the top Nike technology. Penny Hardaway love Air Foamposite. It represents once a bright star. To the world of basketball shoes, its meaning increased again, more represents a memorable Penny Hardaway Shoes series.

McCoughtry and Meadors both added that the fourth-year guard's tired legs contributed to her not starting and playing only 20 minutes.Allene said McCoughtry was not at Philips Arena when players reported and was not in the building for Tuesday's game.McCoughtry and Meadors led Atlanta to the WNBA finals in each of the last two years,<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jbm1hbGw2Ni5jb20v" target="_blank">Nike Dunk</a> but the Dream were swept both times. The player and coach worked together earlier this month in London, helping the U.S. women's team win a gold medal.McCoughtry missed two games last week because of personal reasons. She did not start June 15 against Los Angeles for violating an unspecified team rule.McCoughtry, the No. 1 overall draft pick of 2009, is also the WNBA's leader in steals, averaging 2.9 per game.Williams worked Tuesday for the first time as a head coach since going 36-37 from 1999-2001 with the Utah Starzz. He had been on Meadors' staff since 2009.
<br /><br />Los Angeles Clippers forward Blake Griffin says he's healthy enough to play right now.&quot;If camp started tomorrow, I'd be ready to go,&quot; Griffin told ESPNLosAngeles. &quot;I could go now if I needed to.&quot;Griffin suffered a medial meniscus tear of his left knee on July 11 during Team USA's training camp in Las Vegas. He had arthroscopic surgery to repair the tear.Training camp doesn't start until Oct. 1, and Griffin says he'll be ready well before that.&quot;The surgery wasn't one of those things that took a long time (to recover from),&quot; Griffin said. &quot;It was just a matter of getting my strength back and we really took our time with it. I could have been back even earlier than that.&quot;I just needed to get the swelling out of the knee. That was the biggest battle. There's nothing that needs time to repair or heal. It was just reducing the swelling and getting the strength back in my leg and once I got that,<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jbm1hbGw2Ni5jb20vcHJvZHVjdHMvTmlrZS1EdW5rLUhpZ2gtbjE1M19wMS5odG1s" target="_blank">Nike Dunk High</a> I was out on the court every day.&quot;Although Griffin is ready to go, teammates Chris Paul and Chauncey Billups are still recovering from injuries. Paul had surgery last week to repair a torn ligament in his right thumb, and Billups had surgery in February to repair a torn left Achilles tendon.&quot;I talked with Chris yesterday and I think he'll be back for sure before the start of the season,&quot; Griffin told ESPNLosAngeles. &quot;Chauncey, I'm not sure. He looks great. He's been in working out and I've seen him the past couple days. He looks really good. He looks like he's ahead of schedule but at the same time, it's not worth it to rush it for him because we do have guys who can fill that void until he is 100 percent healthy.&quot;The regular season starts Oct. 31.

<br /><br />'When Sammy went down, we had one more point guard to go and that was it,'' Mercury coach Corey Gaines said. ''It's a lot of injuries. It's a tough one.''The Liberty scored the first 11 points of the game. The Mercury, who missed their first seven shots, didn't get on the scoreboard until Taurasi made two free throws with 5:41 to go in the opening quarter. Taurasi got their first field goal on a three-point play 25 seconds later to cut the deficit to 14-5.New York scored the next seven points to take a 16-point lead on Montgomery's jumper with 4:04 to go in the period. The Liberty were shooting 9 for 13 at that point, and the Mercury were 1 for 9.Hornbuckle had a bank shot and 3-pointer as Phoenix scored the final six points of the period to pull to 23-13.Powell and Pondexter hit back-to-back 3s as the Liberty scored the first 10 points of the second quarter,<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jbm1hbGw2Ni5jb20v" target="_blank">Lebron VIII</a> extending their lead to 20 with 7:16 to go in the half. A 7-0 run, capped by Powell's layup, increased the advantage to 45-20 a little more than 4 minutes later.''We just couldn't put the ball in the basket,'' Gaines said. ''We came in last night from the West Coast to the East Coast and we just were kind of sluggish, never kind of woke up.''Bonner made two free throws with 9 seconds to go in the first half to pull Phoenix to 51-29 at the break.
<br />Pierson had consecutive layups and Kara Braxton added one of her own to stretch New York's lead to 28 less than 2 1/2 minutes into the third. Montgomery, who had a career-high scoring total, hit a 3 and had a layup to make it 67-35 with less than 3 minutes left in the period for the Liberty's largest lead of the game.Phoenix got no closer than 26 the rest of the way.''We played great,'' Pierson said. ''We were aggressive; we came out and jumped on them early and the bench followed suit ... we played like a team.''Lindsey Harding scored 20 points and Angel McCoughtry came off the bench to add 15, leading the Atlanta Dream to a 71-64 win over the Indiana Fever on Wednesday night.Tiffany Hayes added 12 points and Sancho Lyttle 10 for Atlanta,<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jbm1hbGw2Ni5jb20vcHJvZHVjdHMvQWlyLU1heC1MZWJyb24tVklJSS1BQUEtbjEwNDFfcDEuaHRtbA__" target="_blank">Air Max Lebron VIII</a> which has won three straight under new coach Fred Williams as it tries to keep pace in the Eastern Conference.

<br /><br />The return of Milwaukee first baseman Corey Hart from a foot injury became more uncertain after he had a discouraging session Sunday morning running the bases.Hart, who has missed six consecutive games with a partially torn plantar fascia in his left foot, did OK running in a straight line but felt discomfort when making turns on the bases.&quot;Today was the first day I tried to run the bases, and it didn't go as planned,&quot; Hart said. &quot;It's tough because I want to play.&quot;I've played through a lot of injuries,<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jbm1hbGw2Ni5jb20v" target="_blank">Air Jordan</a> but it's one of those things where if I'm on first, I'm not going to be able to score on a double. If I'm on second, it's going to be iffy to score on anything. I feel like I wouldn't be able to do everything I need to do.&quot;Manager Ron Roenicke conceded that it's &quot;a possibility&quot; that Hart won't be able to return to action over the final 16 games. There has been talk of Hart receiving an injection in the foot, but Roenicke said it would be up to the medical staff to make that decision.&quot;We were hoping it would be a little better,&quot; Roenicke said. &quot;I still think we're still going to shoot for Tuesday.&quot;I know he sure wants to get out there. We'll see. We'll know a lot more on Tuesday or Wednesday, how long it's going to be.&quot;Travis Ishikawa has done a nice job filling in for Hart at first base, but Roenicke said it creates a trickle-down effect in the lineup when Hart doesn't bat fifth behind cleanup hitter Aramis Ramirez.&quot;It changes the look on the bottom part of the lineup,&quot; Roenicke said.
<br />It's been a long road back for Cleveland Indians third baseman Lonnie Chisenhall, and Sunday he took another big step by stroking the first walk-off hit of his major league career.Chisehnall's RBI single with one out in the bottom of the ninth inning lifted the Indians to a 7-6 win over the Detroit Tigers.Chisenhall spent two months on the disabled list earlier this season with a broken right forearm. He was hurt when he got hit by a pitch. The injury necessitated surgery, which necessitated an even longer recovery time for the 23-year-old left-handed hitter.He was placed on the disabled list June 30, and there was some question about whether he could beat the clock and return before the end of the season. Chisenhall made it,<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jbm1hbGw2Ni5jb20vcHJvZHVjdHMvSm9yZGFuLUZseS0yMy1uMTEyNV9wMS5odG1s" target="_blank">Jordan Fly 23</a>  as he was activated Sept. 9.Although the Indians are out of the race, these are important games and valuable at-bats for Chisenhall, who will also play winter ball in order to pick up the playing time he lost this year due to his injury. Chisenhall is still seen as the Indians' probably third baseman of the future, but he remains a work in progress.He began the season at Class AAA Columbus, and in 111 at-bats there, he hit .324 with four home runs and 17 RBI. He was recalled by the Indians, and in 24 games prior to his injury, he hit .278 with three homers and nine RBI.

<br />The flow of star players to European teams during the NHL lockout could distort national competitions, International Ice Hockey Federation president Rene Fasel said Thursday,Rene Fasel told The Associated Press that he balanced the increased attention for European hockey against potential damage to the integrity of leagues, especially if players return to North America midseason.''It's questionable how fair it is to the others (teams) and the whole league system,'' Fasel said by telephone from Tokyo, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jbm1hbGw2Ni5jb20v" target="_blank">Air Jordan</a> where the governing body has its congress next week.''The integrity of the game is, for us, something very important. It's not just business,'' the world hockey leader said. ''We play the game for the hockey fans, but sport should always be No. 1. Sport should also be about fairness to everybody.''Since the lockout started on Sunday, players have turned to Europe to find playing time and salaries until the stalemate between the league and NHL players' union is resolved.Fasel said it was good for fans to see stars come home, including two-time MVP Alex Ovechkin to Russian club Dynamo Moscow and New York Islanders captain Mark Streit with Switzerland's best-supported club, Bern.
<br />'That is very positive, there's no doubt,'' said Fasel, a former Swiss league referee. ''Mark Streit never played in Switzerland when he was a junior. Now he can come back and play for a top team as a big star - that's a great story.''Still, Fasel acknowledged mixed feelings.''You have to pay the insurance (for salaries) and we know most of the clubs have troubles with their budgets, so they should be careful,'' he said. ''There are some teams in Switzerland that will never be able to pay half a million and more to hire these guys.''Fasel said wealthy benefactors would help clubs in some cases ''as a present to the fans.''Swiss club Davos has been able to attract San Jose Sharks captain Joe Thornton and New York Rangers winger Rick Nash. Both played for the Alpine town team during the 2004-05 lockout.The players' return should boost interest in Davos. Officials there and in neighboring St. Moritz will ask local voters in March to support their effort to bid for the 2022 Winter Olympics.Just 17 months before the 2014 Sochi Games,<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jbm1hbGw2Ni5jb20vcHJvZHVjdHMvSm9yZGFuLTQtbjMzX3AxLmh0bWw_" target="_blank">Jordan 4</a>  NHL players are not certain to compete in the two-week tournament in Russia run by the IIHF.''Our door is wide open,'' said Fasel, an IOC board member who is unopposed to extend his 18-year IIHF presidency in Japan next week. ''We are planning as if they will be there. If they are not coming, we are going to play hockey anyway.''

<br /><br />Mark Jackson isn't making any playoff promises for the Golden State Warriors this season.Maybe it's a lesson learned for the point guard, preacher and boisterous broadcaster turned NBA head coach. Or maybe he's tempering expectations entering his second season considering, well, there actually are expectations with a reshaped roster built around rehabilitating center Andrew Bogut and point guard Stephen Curry.''I'm not going to say it,'' Jackson said Wednesday. ''Not because I don't believe it. But ultimately it comes to a point where, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jbm1hbGw2Ni5jb20v" target="_blank">Nike Zoom</a> enough of the talking, go out and do it.''That time is almost here.With training camp beginning next week, Jackson still made it clear that not making the postseason would be a major disappointment. He also recognizes the season outlook - and perhaps his own future - hinges largely on the surgically repaired ankles of Bogut and Curry, who have had repeated problems staying on the court throughout their young careers.Asked how confident he is both will return to form and stay healthy this season, Jackson quipped: ''I hope so. My family certainly hopes so.''Same goes for Warriors fans who have long waited for a winner.For a franchise that has made the playoffs once in the last 18 years, talking about the postseason at any time might seem strange, let alone before any exhibitions have been played. Looking at the roster - on paper, anyway - it's easy to see why the Warriors don't find that goal so silly.
<br />The Bogut-Curry combo, if healthy, would be teamed with power forward David Lee, second-year shooting guard Klay Thompson and either Brandon Rush or seventh overall pick Harrison Barnes of North Carolina at small forward. Golden State is deeper than in recent years, too, with Jarrett Jack, Carl Landry and Richard Jefferson complementing rookies Draymond Green and Festus Ezeli,<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jbm1hbGw2Ni5jb20vcHJvZHVjdHMvS2V2aW4tRHVyYW50LU5ldy1LRC1JVi0tbjE0Nl9wMS5odG1s" target="_blank">Nike Zoom KD IV</a> who both impressed enough during summer league and offseason workouts to be considered rotation players.Jackson also has had more time to prepare this season than last, when the labor lockout eliminated most of the offseason and training camp - not to mention limiting practice time during the crammed 66-game schedule. Injuries also decimated the roster, which has been quickly reconstructed under new general manager Bob Myers, and that has Jackson more optimistic than anything after going 23-43 last season.''What makes us better is not the timetable,'' Jackson said. ''It's the talent.''Bogut, the 2005 No. 1 overall pick and best center the franchise has had in at least a decade, fractured his left ankle Jan. 25 with Milwaukee and sat out the rest of the season when he was acquired in a trade for guard Monta Ellis. He isn't expected to be ready at the start of training camp Tuesday, but Jackson is hopeful Bogut will be in the starting lineup for the regular-season opener at Phoenix on Oct. 31.

<br />The Oklahoma City Thunder's first home game since the NBA Finals turned into a showcase for a handful of training camp invitees trying to earn the final roster spot.Andy Rautins scored 20 points, Serge Ibaka added 16 points and 10 rebounds and the Thunder beat the Charlotte Bobcats 120-98 in a preseason game on Tuesday night.''I think the main objective right now is to try to get better as a team. Wherever you fit in, you fit in,'' said Rautins,<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jbm1hbGw2Ni5jb20v" target="_blank">Nike Kobe</a> one of those trying to fill the 15th spot on the roster.''You just play your game and hope for the best outcome. I think collectively we had a solid effort tonight.''Starters Kendrick Perkins (left wrist surgery) and Thabo Sefolosha (left quad contusion) and Sixth Man of the Year James Harden (strained left groin) were among those who sat out.That left plenty of minutes for Rautins, DeAndre Liggins, Daniel Orton, Hollis Thompson and Walker Russell to eat up. Liggins started in place of Sefolosha and Orton, Thompson and Russell all got playing time for the first time in the preseason.''It's working out well. The chemistry on the team is good,'' Rautins said. ''Even though we've got 19-20 guys, I think everybody vibes well and whoever's on the floor is a cohesive unit. So, it's fun.''
<br /><br />Ben Gordon scored 21 points and Ramon Sessions chipped in 18 for the Bobcats, who gave Kemba Walker the night off.''We've got a whole new coaching staff, we've got five new players on the team. We're just trying to jell together,'' said ex-Thunder center Byron Mullens, who went 4 for 10 on 3-pointers and scored 16 points. ''We had summer league, but all the guys weren't there of course because it's summer league.''We're getting there. We had a really good first half. We've just got to put two together.''Three-time NBA scoring champion Kevin Durant scored 13 points in his most extensive playing time of the preseason,<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jbm1hbGw2Ni5jb20vcHJvZHVjdHMvTmlrZS1ab29tLUh5cGVyZnVzZS0yMDExLW4xMjMzX3AxLmh0bWw_" target="_blank">Nike Zoom Hyperfuse 2011</a> going 2 for 8 in the first half before hitting his first three shots as Oklahoma City pulled away after leading 57-53 at halftime.Durant and Russell Westbrook scored all the points during an 11-2 run midway through the third quarter that stretched Oklahoma City's lead to 72-59.Both were on the bench throughout the fourth quarter, when Brooks let the training camp invitees loose. Rautins showed off his shooting, Liggins his perimeter defense, Orton his inside skills and Russell his ability to lead the team from the point.''We definitely have a lot of good choices. We have guys that can do things that the other guys can't,'' Brooks said.
