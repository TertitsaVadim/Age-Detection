<br />And the funny thing is that the PAN staff seem to care little about it.
<br />It used to be that if you reported a fake profile or scammer, the profile was soon removed.
<br />Not anymore. The staff seem to have gone on vacation.
<br /><br />I get several &quot;friend&quot; requests every time I log on. I just ignore them all.
<br />If you want to make PAN a better place to hang out, I urge you to always
<br />report fake profiles and scammers. Let the PAN staff know the suck at their jobs.

<br />It started freezing rain last night and continued all night.
<br />I woke up this morning to no electricity (I'm writing this 
<br />while I'm running from a generator). Several very large
<br />branches have broken off from my trees and are laying
<br />in the yard and driveway. Now the temperature is getting
<br />colder (-8) and snow squalls are starting to come off the
<br />lake. We may get as much as 20 cm of snow later.
<br />I just hope the power crews get the lines fixed beofre I
<br />run out of gasoline!
<br /><br />Wish me luck...

<br />My Tree Swallows have finished their nests and have been mating.
<br />I guess there will soon be eggs for me to show off. Last years the two
<br />pairs laid five eggs each. They all hatched and fledged. I wonder how
<br />they will do this year?

<br />They lay one egg a day, early in the morning. I will check again in a couple of days to see if there are any more. In about three weeks I might have some babies to show.

<br />We knew which tree the nest was in but we were not able to find the nest.
<br />We did not want to just leave the baby to it’s fate so we got an unused planter and put some dry grass in the bottom and hung it up in a tree near the parents. After we left, the parents found the chick and went back to feeding it. We will keep an eye on it to make sure all is well.

<br /><br />My name is Min Zhu. My father is General De Zhu, the founding father of the Peoples Republic of China. I was born in Moscow, in the former Soviet Union, in the summer of 1926. The next year I was sent to China to be raised by my grandmother-in-law and maternal aunt. We lived in the eastern suburb of Chengdu City, located in southwest China. My aunt managed a large orchard there, which was a paradise for my cousin and myself. Under their watchful care, my childhood was full of happiness and peace. However, I never received any messages from my father and I had no memory of him. This lasted eight years until I saw a portrait of him posted in a park by his rival for a reward for the capture of the top Red Army leader. On July 7, 1937, the war of resistance against Japan broke out. My peaceful life was disrupted immediately. My father became concerned and began to try and find me. One day my Uncle Enlai Zhou and Aunt Yingchao Deng arrived in Chengdu. They were there to pick me up. But my grandmother thought it was much safer to stay with her, so I did not go with them. In 1940, the relationship between the Kuomindong (Nationalist Party) and the Gongchandong (Communist Party) further deteriorated. My status as the sole daughter of the supreme commander of the Red Amy caused us to be concerned for my safety. One day, my aunt was suddenly arrested and interrogated by the Kuomindong's policemen. Because she insisted that I was her own daughter, she was released after a couple of days. My grandma and aunt realized that I was in great danger, and should leave them as soon as possible. They did not wish for me to go. A few days later, my cousin and I started a long and arduous journey to a northern town, Yanan, which was the Gongchandong's base.

<br /><br />After careful planning by my Uncle Zhou Enlai and Aunt Deng
<br />Yingchao, my cousin and I started a long and dangerous journey
<br />from Chengdu to Yanan. We were disguised as battlefield
<br />nurses. First, we cautiously went through a Japanese occupied
<br />city, (Wuhan) and a Kuomindang occupied city (Xian) and then
<br />trudged over 150 kilometers of hilly land from Xian to Yanan at
<br />night. We finally arrived at Yanan by the end of 1940 after a 
<br />two-month journey. I was so excited and happy to finally meet my
<br />father since I had been away from him for fourteen years. My
<br />father and stepmother, Kang Keqing, gave me a warm reception.
<br />Father told me many stories, for example, his legendary
<br />experiences and his dream of a new government. On the third day,
<br />my Uncle Mao Zedong visited us.  Mao was the chairman of the Communist
<br />Party. A week later, my father left Yanan and went to the
<br />frontline to direct his army against the Japanese army. In the spring
<br />of 1941, my father and other leaders decided to send four children
<br />to Moscow for study at an international children's school. Among
<br />the four children sent were Mao's daughter, Li Min, and myself. We
<br />first arrived at Ulumuqi by flying in Soviet Airforce bomber.  We
<br />managed to evade the Koumindang's inspection at the air port by
<br />disguising ourselves as four pieces of luggage.  We then went to Moscow by
<br />train. In Moscow, the teachers from China took us to the
<br />international children's school, located in Ivanov City, 300
<br />kilometres outside of Moscow.

<br /><br />In Moscow, there were two international children's schools.  One
<br />was Ivanov School and the other was Monino School.  Here lived many
<br />of the international communist’s leaders children from over forty
<br />countries. Over 40 students from China were gathered in the
<br />Ivanov school. For reasons of security, I started to use a new name
<br />Ying Chi there. I enjoyed my studies and life in the first four
<br />months. Because of my heavy breathing disease, I was move to a 
<br />recuperation school in the suburb of Minsk City,
<br />located in Byelorussia. Upon arrival at the new school, I was surprised
<br />by its beauty and mild climate.
<br />However, the next day, June 22, 1941, the German troops
<br />suddenly invaded the Soviet Union on a large scale. Twenty-one
<br />students, together with our teacher, Ana, were quickly captured
<br />by the German troops. At first, we had to undergo strict inspection.
<br />Fortunately, I passed the strict inspection. I told
<br />them that I was the daughter of a Chinese doctor, and I was here
<br />for treating my illness. However, two little Jewish sisters were
<br />discovered by the shape of their heads, and cruelly killed right in front
<br />of us. We were locked up in an orphan compound. Orphans
<br />continuously died from hunger and disease. Although we worked
<br />hard to earn a little bit more food to help them, there was still
<br />no hope. Several children tried to escape from imprisonment, but they
<br />were either captured again or killed by German bombs. Those painful
<br />days have been deeply rooted in my memory.

<br /><br />In the first three months, the German troops made a long drive into
<br />the Soviet Union, and soon reached the city gates of Moscow. The
<br />great Soviet people united to withstand ferocious attacks from the
<br />German troops. Coincidentally, the coldest winter in 140 years
<br />covered Moscow, which heavily struck at the morale of the
<br />German troops. In July 1942, the legendary Stalingrad battle started.
<br />Through six-months of fighting, the Soviet people triumphed over the
<br />German army. This was the turning point in the Second World War.
<br />Unfortunately, before we saw the victory, all of the children
<br />over 14 years old were picked up and transported to a camp in eastern 
<br />Prussia, in the east of Germany. In the closed train on the way to
<br />Prussia, I became very sick and almost died because of a high fever.
<br />In the concentration camp, I was the only Chinese person. Upon arrival there,
<br />we were forced to disinfect by taking a shower. The guards
<br />confiscated everything except our clothing. I had a precious souvenir of 
<br />Lenin’s Badge, which I bravely saved under my tongue. The
<br />badge accompanied me for the rest of my life and often encouraged me to
<br />defeat deadly threats and overcome difficulty. At the same time, I
<br />found a lot of Jewish people were tricked there, and were
<br />secretly killed by poison gas when they took a shower. Although we
<br />were teenagers, we were not afraid of death. Hunger was the most
<br />unbearable thing for the children. We had to struggle with
<br />extreme hunger. We even searched for mildewed scraps of food in a
<br />swill bucket at night. From first hand experience, we realized the cold-blooded
<br />and capricious nature of the fascist.

<br /><br />Hundreds of children from over ten different countries were locked up in
<br />the concentration camp. We were forced to work every day for at least
<br />twelve hours a day in an ammunitions factory. Our work was to pack
<br />the bullets, manufactured in other workshops. Because of the
<br />long, hard work, our hands became rough, swollen and numb. The
<br />dormitory and factory districts were closely watched by the
<br />German soldiers. If somebody was found to have taken something (food in
<br />most cases) out from the factory at the gate, they would be
<br />heavily punished. One day, we were called together in a large
<br />playground by an ear-piercing whistle. A short Jewish man was caught
<br />because he was found to carry a picture frame. The brave man
<br />showed us his family picture, detached from the frame. He told us
<br />that his family had been secretly killed and their goods,
<br />including the frame, made of silver, were robbed and transported
<br />here. He was quickly shot dead in the front of us. When we heard
<br />that the bullets would not work if they were moistened, we
<br />often spat in the cartridge box to express our great hatred. One
<br />day, the right side of my neck became inflamed because of an infected
<br />lymph node. When the condition worsened, I was moved to the
<br />operating room, where I experienced the most uncivilized
<br />treatment, like an animal. During the operation, there was no
<br />anaesthetic used. Because of giant pain I fell unconscious.
<br />With the help of the sisters in the camp, I finally recovered. During
<br />the four-year imprisonment, I lost contact with my father, grandma
<br />and other relatives, and I almost forgot my native language,
<br />Chinese.

<br /><br />Since I left China in the spring 1941, the war of resistance
<br />against Japanese turned to the most difficult stage for China.
<br />Encouraged by the surprise attack by Germans on the Soviet Union,
<br />the Japanese troops started the wildest invasion. My father moved
<br />his headquarter to Taihang Mountain, a military hub, and directed
<br />his army to fight against the Japanese. Although my father was
<br />very busy, he always missed his daughter, not knowing what happened to her.
<br />In October 1943, he sent me a letter addressed to the Ivanov
<br />School. Two months later, the letter returned to him because
<br />the postal delivery was disconnected. Now, I always keep this letter with me.
<br />I regretted very much that I never wrote to him since I left China.
<br />We did not hear any news from each other for five years.
<br />Until the autumn 1944, we heard that the multinational
<br />troops conducted the famous landing in Normandy, and the Soviet
<br />army started to recover their lost territory. After the victory
<br />in defending Stalingrad, a list of missing, dead or
<br />slaughtered children from the International Children School was
<br />sent to Stalin. He ordered his army to do their best to search
<br />for those children. However, after they liberated all of the
<br />Soviet Union, they still could not find us. Nobody knew that we
<br />were in a German concentration camp. On February 15, 1944, my
<br />father's mother passed away. He and his friends were deeply
<br />grieved for the  loss a great mother. Although my father was an
<br />army man, he loved children very much. My parents always helped and
<br />raised many kids of their comrades-in-arms. In order to remove
<br />the anxiety of the officers and soldiers in the frontline, they
<br />established the second children care school in Yanan.

<br /><br />In January of 1945, we started to hear gunfire in the far distance.
<br />We knew that the Soviet army was fighting against the German
<br />troops into German territory. This lasted for half a month,
<br />but we still did not see the Red Army. The excitement was
<br />gradually replaced by the anxiety. One sunny morning, an
<br />incredible thing happened in our camp. The German guards magically
<br />disappeared overnight. After careful verification, the people
<br />rushed into a food storage room. I luckily picked up a large
<br />butter weighing about five pounds, which was very important to me in the
<br />following days. In the adjacent concentration camp for the
<br />prisoners of the war, we were shocked to find that they were all
<br />shot dead at night. We were so lucky! After discussing which
<br />direction to go with my close sisters, including two Czech
<br />sisters and two Ukrainian sisters, we decided to run to the
<br />east, towards the Soviet Union. The vagrant life was extremely
<br />arduous and dangerous. One night, we slept in a haystack. Unfortunately we
<br />were driven away when a fire broke out and we got lost from each other. A
<br />family from the Soviet Union took me in, and soon I met the Red Army.
<br />It was arranged for me to stay in a refugee camp. In May of 1945,
<br />Germany surrendered. Although the people celebrated the
<br />great victory and freedom, I cautiously kept my false status for
<br />security purposes. A Red Army officer noticed me and was
<br />curious about my real status since I was the only Chinese there.
<br />His kindness made me disclose my real identity. When he learnt that
<br />I was the daughter of the top leader of the Chinese communist
<br />army, he was extremely shocked and almost fell down from his
<br />chair. It was a real miracle for me to have escape from the German
<br />camp, in spite of my special status. He helped me to write to the
<br />International Children School. The letter was transferred to the
<br />Moscow Red Cross Society. Anying Mao, a son of Mao Zedong,
<br />happened to see this letter. Through his help, I finally
<br />contacted my father in China. In the early 1946, I returned to
<br />Moscow.

<br /><br />On January 30, 1946, I returned to Moscow, as if in a dream.
<br />After I returned to the International Children School in Ivanov, I
<br />received the first letter from my father. My tears had soaked the
<br />letter before I read through it. My goal was to continue my
<br />interrupted education and made up for the four-year loss. I finally
<br />graduated from high school in 1949, when I was almost
<br />twenty-three years old. When I prepared my enrolment examination
<br />for the Lenin Normal College, I learnt that the People's Republic of
<br />China would be founded soon. My father sent me a letter and hoped
<br />for me to go back to China to pursue my higher education there. After
<br />thinking it over carefully, I decided to stay in the Soviet Union. I
<br />chose a normal college because I wanted to be a teacher in the
<br />future. During the summer vacation of 1950, I finally returned to my
<br />motherland. I was surprised to find that I did not understand the
<br />language, what the people said. My home was located in Zhongnanhai
<br />in Beijing, where many top leaders lived. I was very excited to
<br />meet my father and stepmother again. Because I often talked to
<br />people in Russian, my father taught me Chinese every evening. One
<br />day, My parents accompanied my friends and myself to climb the famous
<br />Xiang Mountain near Beijing. My father loved sports. When he was
<br />young, he played basketball and organized the first basketball
<br />team in the journey of the Long March. When he was old, he
<br />preferred to climb mountains and play Chinese Chess with his
<br />friends Dehuai Peng and Xiaoping Deng. Through the two-month
<br />vacation, I got a lot. First, I met my relatives and friends.
<br />Second, I finally and completely cured my long-term disease, formed in the
<br />German concentration camp. Third, my grandmother-in-law aroused my
<br />desire to fall in love.

<br /><br />After I returned to Moscow, my classmates found that I had become
<br />a healthy, happy and active girl. Although I often had a good
<br />relationship with the Soviet young men, I was not willing to
<br />further develop the relationship beyond a friendship. In 1952, My
<br />stepmother visited Moscow as the leader of a multinational women’s
<br />delegation. Thus, I often accompanied my stepmother to
<br />participate in some of her activities, held in the Chinese Embassy in
<br />Moscow, where I fell in love with a young Chinese man, named
<br />Zheng Liu. In early 1953, we married in the Chinese Embassy.
<br />By the end of this year, I graduated from the Lenin Normal College
<br />and immediately returned to China with my husband. Upon arrival
<br />in Beijing, our first son was born. With my father's help,
<br />I got an honourable teaching position at the Beijing Normal University.
<br />Since my returned to China, I gradually got to know my father. He always
<br />treated and educated his children strictly. For example, he did
<br />not allow me to go up on the rostrum at Tian An Men Square on National
<br />Foundation Day (October 1).  In order to let me concentrate on my work, my
<br />parents looked after my son, and required me to live at the
<br />University dormitory from Monday through Saturday. He taught me
<br />how to manage my monthly salary for daily expenses. He always
<br />hoped for me to be an ordinary person without privileges. In 1955, my
<br />father was given the title of Marshal. However, he still led a
<br />thrifty and simple life. My parents treated our children in
<br />different styles, but they were always in harmony with one
<br />another. At the end of 1965,although I was not
<br />in good health, I requested to go to a difficult rural area to be their political
<br />representative. My parents supported my request. I spent half a
<br />year observing and learning the life in the countryside.
<br />Unfortunately, I lost the sight in my right eye as a result of a recurring 
<br />problem with high blood pressure. My father passed away on July 6,
<br />1976, and my stepmother passed away in 1992. They contributed
<br />their whole lives to the revolution and construction of a new China.
