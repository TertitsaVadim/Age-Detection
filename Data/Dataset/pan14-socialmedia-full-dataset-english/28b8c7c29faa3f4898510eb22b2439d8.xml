<br />one look puts the rhythm in my hand.
<br />Still I'll never understand why you hang around
<br />I see what's going down.
<br /><br />Cover up with make up in the mirror
<br />tell yourself it's never gonna happen again
<br />you cry alone and then he swears he loves you.
<br /><br />Do you feel like a man
<br />when you push her around?
<br />Do you feel better now as she falls to the ground?
<br />Well I'll tell you my friend, one day this world's going to end
<br />as your lies crumble down, a new life she has found.
<br /><br />A pebble in the water makes a ripple effect
<br />every action in this world will bear a consequence
<br />If you wade around forever you will surely drown
<br />I see what's going down.
<br /><br />I see the way you go and say your right again,
<br />say your right again
<br />heed my lecture
<br /><br />Do you feel like a man
<br />when you push her around?
<br />Do you feel better now as she falls to the ground?
<br />Well I'll tell you my friend, one day this world's going to end
<br />[Face Down Lyrics on <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.lyricsmania.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.lyricsmania.com</a>]
<br />as your lies crumble down a new life she has.
<br /><br />Face down in the dirt she says, this doesn't hurt she says I finally had enough..
<br /><br />Face down in the dirt she says, this doesn't hurt she says I finally had enough..
<br /><br />One day she will tell you that she has had enough
<br />its coming round again.
<br /><br />Do you feel like a man, when you push her around?
<br />Do you feel better now as she falls to the ground?
<br />Well I'll tell you my friend, one day this world's going to end
<br />as your lies crumble down, a new life she has.
<br /><br />Do you feel like a man, when you push her around?
<br />Do you feel better now as she falls to the ground?
<br />Well I'll tell you my friend, one day this world's going to end
<br />as your lies crumble down, a new life she has.
<br /><br />Face down in the dirt she says, this doesn't hurt she says I finally had enough..

<br />A silver lining sometimes isn't enough
<br />To make some wrongs seem right
<br />Whatever life brings
<br />I've been through everything
<br />And know I'm on my knees again
<br /><br />But I know I must go on
<br />Although I hurt I must be strong
<br />Because inside I know that many feel this way
<br /><br />Children don't stop dancing
<br />Believe you can fly
<br />Away...away
<br /><br />At times life's unfair and you know it's plain to see
<br />Hey God I know I'm just a dot in this world
<br />Have you forgot about me?
<br />Whatever life brings
<br />I've been through everything
<br />And know I'm on my knees again
<br /><br />But I know I must go on
<br />Although I hurt I must be strong
<br />Because inside I know that many feel this way
<br /><br />Am I hiding in the shadows?
<br />Forget the pain and forget the sorrows
<br /><br />But I know I must go on
<br />Although I hurt I must be strong
<br />Because inside I know that many feel this way
<br /><br />Children don't stop dancing
<br />Believe you can fly
<br />Away...away
<br /><br />Am I hiding in the shadows?
<br />Are we hiding in the shadows?

<br />this is mine
<br /><br />Leo symbolizes the consciousness wherein there is strength, creativity and virility, as well as a certain headstrong or willful nature in how you apply yourself in relationship with others. 
<br />  For instance, Nicole, reading biographical or historical novels about European royalty, daydreaming about the courts of Kings and Queens of modern Europe or ancient times and other grandeurs of the past may bring to your conscious mind memories of previous incarnations when you were at the forefront of things.  Hence to this very day there probably remains within you considerable inner strength along with a strong feeling for behind-the-scenes intrigues as well as a powerful sense of individualism.  These qualities are probably connected with your past life experiences involved -- directly and indirectly -- with leaders of society and government.  
<br />  You are also likely to have an above-average interest in the great artistic and spiritual accomplishments of the grand cathedrals and great churches of Britain and Europe, as well as the ancient temples of the Mediterranean world.

<br /><br />Isn't it funny you can change your music taste to impress someone but when it comes to a person who likes thier own music and thier own style, you give them a mouthful?
<br /><br />Isn't it funny that a guy can get away with being a gangsta, but the emo kid gets a mouthful from everyone?
<br /><br />Are you laughing?
<br /><br />Isn't it funny an emo kid can be quiet all through the week but gets more shit from everyone than the girl who sleeps around and sells her virginity?
<br /><br />Isn't it funny that the girl who sleeps around is a saint among teenagers? But the girl who respects herself is a &quot;snob&quot; or a &quot;stuck up bitch&quot;?
<br /><br />Isn't it funny that you dont mind your friends drinking or smoking, but the minute someone mentions emo music, you can give them a lecture on melodramatic teenage outcasts?
<br /><br />I'm not laughing.
<br /><br />It's so funny that you and your friends can make a persons life hell and not know anything about the silent battle they might be fighting.
<br /><br />Isn't it funny that you can call emos, punks, goths the retards but still manage to get through your day without an inch of guilt in your heart?
<br /><br />How can you call someone a poser?
<br />An emo kid?
<br />Or even a goth?
<br />Ridicule them for doing what they want to do, not what every expects them to do.
<br />Why try and make their lives hell, when you know nothing about them, why they do what they do or why they are the way they are.
<br /><br />Keep on laughing
<br /><br />Isnt it funny you can say and do all this without any idea of what is going on in this persons life? Without knowing her situation with thier friends, or their family, or their LIFE??
<br /><br />Brave isn't going up on stage and stripping
<br />Nor is it doing a speech infront of a large crowd.
<br /><br />Brave is going through life, not caring what the idiots around you say about your looks, clothes, style..
<br />Your music, your personality..
<br />Brave is getting through the day, dealing with anything and still being able to sleep quietly at night, and laugh the next morning.
<br /><br />Keep on laughing
<br />I'm not
<br /><br />If you agree put this as a blog.

<br /><br />Text for the cards that GLSEN'S Day of Silence participants pass out: 
<br /><br />Please understand my reasons for not speaking today. I support lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender rights. People who are silent today believe that laws and attitudes should be inclusive of people of all sexual orientations and gender identities. GLSEN'S Day of Silence is to draw attention to those who have been silenced by hatred, oppression, and prejudice. Think about the voices you are not hearing. What can you do to end the silence?  
<br /><br />all you have to do is not talk for a certin amount of time (8am-4pm) is how long im running mine for. all you have to do is not talk for that long, (typing, and writeing not included) think you can do it?? please dont do it if your not serious about it, im mean come one dont do it just so you dont have to participate in class or talk to people you dont like, do it because you support lesbians, bisexuals, and gay pride. help end the silence because you care, not because other people are doing it.

<br /><br />&quot;No, it's not that. This day is the worst of my life. First, I fall asleep, and I go late to my office. My boss, outrageous, fires me.

I get a cab to return home, and when I leave it, I remember I left my wallet and credit cards there. The cab driver just drives away.&quot;

<br /><br />This is quite possibly the best poem
<br />I have ever read.
<br /><br />Her hair was up in a pony tail,
<br /><br />her favorite dress tied with a bow.
<br /><br />Today was Daddy's Day at school,
<br /><br />and she couldn't wait to go.
<br /><br />But her mommy tried to tell her,
<br /><br />that she probably should stay home.
<br /><br />Why the kids might not understand,
<br /><br />if she went to school alone.
<br /><br />But she was not afraid; she knew just what to say.
<br /><br />What to tell her
<br /><br />classmates of why he wasn't there today.
<br /><br />But still her mother worried,
<br /><br />for her to face this day alone.
<br /><br />And that was why once again,
<br /><br />she tried to keep her daughter home.
<br /><br />But the little girl went to school
<br /><br />eager to tell them all.
<br /><br />About a dad she never sees;
<br /><br />a dad who never calls.
<br /><br />There were daddies along the wall in back, for everyone to meet.
<br /><br />Children squirming impatiently,
<br /><br />anxious in their seats
<br /><br />One by one the teacher called a student from the class.
<br /><br />To introduce
<br /><br />their daddy, as seconds slowly passed.
<br /><br />At last the teacher called her name,
<br /><br />every child turned to stare.
<br /><br />Each of them was searching,
<br /><br />for a man who wasn't there.
<br /><br />&quot;Where's her daddy at?&quot;
<br /><br />she heard a boy call out.
<br /><br />&quot;She probably doesn't have one,&quot;
<br /><br />another student dared to shout.
<br /><br />And from somewhere near the back,
<br /><br />she heard a daddy say,
<br /><br />&quot;Looks like another deadbeat dad,
<br /><br />too busy to waste his day.&quot;
<br /><br />The words did not offend her,
<br /><br />as she smiled up at her Mom.
<br /><br />And looked back at her teacher,
<br /><br />who told her to go on.
<br /><br />And with hands behind her back,
<br /><br />slowly she began to speak.
<br /><br />And out from the mouth of a child,
<br /><br />came words incredibly unique.
<br /><br />&quot;My Daddy couldn't be here,
<br /><br />because he lives so far away.
<br /><br />But I know he wishes he could be,
<br /><br />since this is such a special day.
<br /><br />And though you cannot meet him,
<br /><br />I wanted you to know.
<br /><br />All about my daddy,
<br /><br />and how much he loves me so.
<br /><br />He loved to tell me stories
<br /><br />he taught me to ride my bike.
<br /><br />He surprised me with pink roses,
<br /><br />and taught me to fly a kite.
<br /><br />We used to share fudge sundaes,
<br /><br />and ice cream in a cone.
<br /><br />And though you cannot see him.
<br /><br />I'm not standing here alone.
<br /><br />&quot;Cause my daddy's always with me,
<br /><br />even though we are apart
<br /><br />I know because he told me,
<br /><br />he'll forever be in my heart&quot;
<br /><br />With that, her little hand reached up,
<br /><br />and lay across her chest.
<br /><br />Feeling her own heartbeat,
<br /><br />beneath her favorite dress.
<br /><br />And from somewhere here in the crowd of dads,
<br /><br />her mother stood in tears.
<br /><br />Proudly watching her daughter,
<br /><br />who was wise beyond her years.
<br /><br />For she stood up for the love
<br /><br />of a man not in her life.
<br /><br />Doing what was best for her,
<br /><br />doing what was right.
<br /><br />And when she dropped her hand back down,
<br /><br />staring straight into the crowd.
<br /><br />She finished with a voice so soft,
<br /><br />but its message clear and loud.
<br /><br />&quot;I love my daddy very much,
<br /><br />he's my shining star.
<br /><br />And if he could, he'd be here,
<br /><br />but heaven's just too far
<br /><br />You see he was a firefighter
<br /><br />and died just this past year
<br /><br />When airplanes hit the towers
<br /><br />and taught Americans to fear.
<br /><br />But sometimes when I close my eyes,
<br /><br />it's like he never went away.&quot;
<br /><br />And then she closed her eyes,
<br /><br />and she saw him there that day.
<br /><br />And to her mothers amazement,
<br /><br />she witnessed with surprise
<br /><br />A room full of daddies and children,
<br /><br />all starting to close their eyes.
<br /><br />Who knows what they saw before them,
<br /><br />who knows what they felt inside.
<br /><br />Perhaps for merely a second,
<br /><br />they saw him at her side.
<br /><br />&quot;I know you're with me Daddy,&quot;
<br /><br />to the silence she called out.
<br /><br />And what happened next made believers,
<br /><br />of those once filled with doubt.
<br /><br />Not one in that room could explain it,
<br /><br />for each of their eyes had been closed.
<br /><br />But there on the desk beside her,
<br /><br />was a fragrant long-stemmed pink rose.
<br /><br />And a child was blessed, if only for a moment,
<br /><br />by the love of her shining star.
<br /><br />And given the gift of believing,
<br /><br />that heaven is never too far.
<br /><br />They say it takes a minute to find a special
<br /><br />person, an hour to appreciate them,
<br /><br />a day to love them, but then an entire
<br /><br />life to forget them.
<br /><br />REPOST THIS to SHOW APPRCIATION
<br /><br />for the people you'll never forget .
<br /><br />It's a short message to let them know
<br /><br />that you'll never forget them.
<br /><br />Take the time...to live and love.
<br /><br />Until eternity
<br /><br />Post this as &quot;Dad's poem&quot;

<br /><br />From Chariles bar.
<br /><br />I hear him curse
<br /><br />My name is called
<br /><br />I press myself
<br /><br />Against the wall
<br /><br />I try to hide
<br /><br />From his evil eyes
<br /><br />Im so afraid now
<br /><br />I'm starting to cry
<br /><br />He finds me weeping
<br /><br />Calls me ugly words,
<br /><br />He says its my fault
<br /><br />He suffers at work.
<br /><br />He slaps and hits me
<br /><br />And yells at me more,
<br /><br />I finally get free
<br /><br />And run to the door
<br /><br />Hes already locked it
<br /><br />And i start to bawl,
<br /><br />He takes me and throws me
<br /><br />Against the hard wall
<br /><br />I fall to the floor
<br /><br />With my bones nearly broken,
<br /><br />And my daddy continues
<br /><br />With more bad words spoken,
<br /><br />&quot;Im sorry!&quot;, I scream
<br /><br />But its now much to late
<br /><br />His face has been twisted
<br /><br />Into a unimaginable shape
<br /><br />The hurt and the pain
<br /><br />Again and again
<br /><br />O please God, have mercy!
<br /><br />O please let it end!
<br /><br />And he finally stops
<br /><br />And heads for the door
<br /><br />While i lay there motionless
<br /><br />Sprawled on the floor
<br /><br />My name is Chris
<br /><br />I am three,
<br /><br />Tonight my daddy
<br /><br />Murdered me
<br /><br />And you can help!
<br /><br />If you read this
<br /><br />and dont pass it on
<br /><br />I pray for your forgivness
<br /><br />Because you would have to be
<br /><br />One heartless person
<br /><br />To not be effected
<br /><br />By this Poem
<br /><br />And because u r effected,
<br /><br />Do something about it!
<br /><br />So all i ask you to do
<br /><br />Is pass this on!
<br /><br />IF YOU ARE AGAINST CHILD ABUSE!
<br /><br />PLEASE COPY AND PASTE THIS AND PASS IT ON !!
<br />REPOST THIS AS . No Kid Should Go Through This

<br /><br />I went down to the park
<br /><br />I saw them kiss
<br /><br />I ran home to cry on my bed
<br /><br />Not a word to my mother was said
<br /><br />Father came late at night
<br /><br />He looked at me from left to right
<br /><br />He saw me hanging from a rope
<br /><br />He took his knife out to cut me down
<br /><br />And on my dress a note was found:
<br /><br />Dig my grave
<br /><br />Dig it deep
<br /><br />Dig my grave
<br /><br />From head to feet
<br /><br />And on top put a dove
<br /><br />To show the world I died for love
<br /><br />Something good will happen at 11:36 PM
<br /><br />This is not a joke...
<br /><br />Someone will call you or talk to you online
<br /><br />And say that they love you.
<br /><br />Do not break this chain
<br /><br />Good luck with your true love
<br /><br />Girls, use the title &quot;I saw a girl on his lap <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/sad.gif" alt=":)" />&quot;
<br />Guys, use the I title &quot;saw her sitting on a guys lap <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/sad.gif" alt=":)" />&quot;

<br />at your window,
<br />urging,
<br />let me in. 
<br /><br />The night is black,
<br />no stars in sight,
<br />clouds are forming,
<br />you feel a fright. 
<br /><br />&quot;Tap&quot;
<br />&quot;Tap&quot;
<br />&quot;Tap&quot; 
<br /><br />Let me in.
<br />Let me in.
<br />I'll get wet.
<br />I am cold. 
<br /><br />Waiting,
<br />staring,
<br />you see the eyes,
<br />urging you to approach. 
<br /><br />Approaching the window,
<br />you feel a cold.
<br />Somthing is scary,
<br />but you are bold. 
<br /><br />Ulatching the window,
<br />you are rushed.
<br />Overcome,
<br />by a vampire's lust. 
<br /><br />Bitten swiftly,
<br />quick,
<br />and precise. 
<br /><br />A searing pain,
<br />pierces your throat.
<br />Your blood is draining,
<br />while the vampire gloat. 
<br /><br />As you think,
<br />&quot;I should feel pain.&quot;
<br />You realize,
<br />It's ecstasy
<br />for your blood
<br />to drain.
<br /><br />my best friend wrote that poem
<br /><br />and he likes this quote
<br /><br />&quot;Patient and silent while we live, our skeletons shout to heaven and posterity after we die.&quot;
