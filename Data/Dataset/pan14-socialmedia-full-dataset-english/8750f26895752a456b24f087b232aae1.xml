<br /><br />I'm doing a zip slide from the top of the Erskine Bridge Hotel on the 2nd of June....and I'm terrified of heights.

<br /><br />oh well...on to the next thing - it's got to be better <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" />

I missed the train I was meant to catch, and ended up on the wrong train.  Then, I ran from the train station, got lost in a housing estate, then got lost in the business park and finally got there 10 mins late.
<br /><br />I was told that the interview went well (it must have made up for the lateness <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/wacko.gif" alt=":)" /> ) and I start my new job on the 9th of July <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/biggrin.gif" alt=":)" />  And....its a permanent job, so the smelly yeller pages did me a favour <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/biggrin.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />I think I might have to go and drink a few beers.....need to calm down.......sadly everyone else is out :S......rubbish people....how can I celebrate? <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/wacko.gif" alt=":)" />

<br /><br />Anyway, I went to see it with Dave (boyfriend)'s mum and we had a good long chat. I think I finally have plans for new year - Dave's mum invited me over.  That just leaves Christmas now...I think I'm going to my parents' this year.  It's a shame I don't really get that much time off work, but then, someone has to keep the cogs turning in an international company I guess.
<br /><br />Oh, speaking of work, I think I should apply to a couple of places on the council...as much as I love working where I am, I really need to make some kind of step in the door to get towards a job in social work.
<br /><br />Anyway, I think I shall go and have some breakfast and finish watching the episode of Lost I was watching last night/this morning.

<br /><br />I'm getting to the stage where people who promised they'd be there if I ever needed anyone to talk to are turning their backs when I need them the most. I'm tired of the whole thing.  I think it's time I took a few hundred steps back because I'm obviously doing something wrong.
<br /><br />I'm tired of being the one who always gets picked up and thrown away like a rag doll.  From now on, things are going to be different.  I feel like I've already lost all the things that really matter to me, so I guess there's not much else for me to lose. I can't carry on being the one that people don't take very seriously, so here's the plan.  I'm not going to be nice to anyone who doesn't deserve it anymore.  Everyone gets one chance.  If they screw it up, then tough luck.  I don't have enough fight in me any more to keep up this stupid 'seeing the best in everyone' thing.
<br /><br />If you don't like me at the moment, then you have nothing to worry about.  In fact it's going to be pretty easy.
<br /><br />Boot on the other foot, if I screw it up, I'm going to appologise once.  If that isn't good enough, then neither is that person's friendship.  I'm not promising to be better with phoning, e-mailing, texting, or anything.  Just saying that my view of people has drastically changed.
<br /><br />NO MORE SUGAR COATING!

Sad as it is, that's all I really have to look forward to this weekend.  Might be going to see 'Borat' with Dave, but I don't think he's decided if he wants to go yet.  I think we're going to see his dad on Sunday...that should take the whole evening.
<br /><br />I was playing the Starwars game that I was given, but it just crashed for no apparent reason.   And I hadn't saved in a while.  I hate that. And somehow, it's only when I'm running windows....other O.S.s need to get sorted out so that they can run windows games...its so frustrating!
<br /><br />Oh well...I think I might jump on WOW for a wee while...Neil has completely overtaken me in levels...I used to be ten levels above him, and I think he's probably ten levels above me now... <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/blushing.gif" alt=":)" /> 
<br /><br />Anyway, I shall go and find something interesting to do until Dave comes home with Starwars 5....FUN!! <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/unsure.gif" alt=":)" />

<br /><br />I'm going to see a flat on tuesday - hopefully it'll be a nice one.  I've made just about all the other arrangements for moving.  Just this last little detail to sort out :S lol

It was my first class today, and I'm aching in loads of muscles that I never knew I had, but it was still great.  I was watching the more advanced people and it's so theatrical and looks amazing to watch.  The moves are more difficult than I thought they would be, but with practice, I'll have them learned.  I keep kicking with the wrong leg....so this week, I'm going to practice the two kicks we were shown.  That, and the cartwheels and handstands.  
<br /><br />I don't think I'll be able to walk in the morning....I think I'm going to go and lie down in a corner and fall asleep.  Will Write again soon. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/biggrin.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/ninja.gif" alt=":)" />

At least we're still friends I guess.  And to be honest, I think I could do with him as a friend right now...it leaves out all the extra complications.
<br /><br />It's the next bit that's going to be tough is getting over seeing each other with other people.  I'm sure it'll all work out ok, as long as we are both honest with each other about how things are going.
<br /><br />Anyway, I think I'm going to go and watch some TV and contemplate organising a night out for next week.  We shall see...

He's managed to arrange a rebound for Christmas....and I don't know how I feel about it.  I want to be ok with it, but I don't know how I'm going to react when I see her face to face.  Especially since she's been after him since before we broke up....four months or so I believe.
<br /><br />I guess I need to find a rebound...but I still feel really loyal to him...like I would be betraying him.  Weird...
<br /><br />I'll see how things go.  hopefully not too bad.

The nights out at my work truly are amazing!  tonight was the Xmas nite out and it was a James Bond 'Casino Royale' theme.  Everyone looked great, there was free booze and it was all at Hampden Park....not to mention they had an Austin Martin parked out front and bond girls inside directing the way.  Fantastic!
<br /><br />My ex-boyfriend/flatmate came with me and we had a good time.  A bit wierd not being able to be as affectionate as I'd like, but it was a good time none the less.
<br /><br />Anyway, I should probably head to bed now....feeling slightly tipsy and very tired.  Shame that one of the girls was leaving...even if it is on a round-the-world trip for 9 months.
<br /><br />Anyways, goodnight.

Apart from the fact that the venue wasn't as good as it could have been, the DJ was completely crap, and the drinks were overpriced.  But nonetheless, it was a good night.  I had to leave early cos I went with my flatmate (ex bf) and he had to work yesterday morning, and there was no way that I could afford to get a Taxi, especially since he was getting one back anyway.
<br /><br />Aparently I missed out on some drunken randomness, but I'm sure there'll be more of that another time.
<br /><br />I'm currently awaiting the arrival of some donner, chips and cheese....I hope it gets here soon!  so hungry!
<br /><br />Anyway, best go....stuff to do, games to play, etc. etc.

<br /><br />I'm going to my parents' for Christmas for the first time in years, and I think I'm almost ready.  Just need to get stuff organised and packed. :S
<br /><br />oh well....I guess I should start now <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/biggrin.gif" alt=":)" />

Things have been pretty difficult this year, but I feel like I'm turning a corner.  I think this year I'm going to focus on myself...making sure that I'm happy.  I feel like I need it.  hopefully I can get over all this stuff with my ex bf/flatmate, because all I've been doing is beating myself up about it and being miserable, especially since that girl came to stay and missed her flight home...that's been extremely difficult to deal with.
<br /><br />From now on, it doesn't matter.  All I really need is me and some good friends, I just need more faith in myself I guess.
<br /><br />New year, new me.... <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" />

<br /><br />waking up the flatmates at 4 in the morning may have been a bad move...but then again, they have been getting their own back today.  They woke me up at 8:45am.....so mean!! <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/sad.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />Anyway, I think I'm going to go and crawl into a dark corner and hide for the rest of the weekend...

		<document id="8b16e2fa162ade2ace8cea6d84273135" url=""><![CDATA[Why Valentines Day Sucks.....<br/><br/>And I'm not just saying that...it really does.  So what if someone's said it all before...I don't care.
<br /><br />Why is it, that any time the 14th of February comes around people start getting all stressed out?  'What should I get?' 'Will this be good enough?' 'I don't have enough money to buy anything' and all the other crap.  Why should we be forced to show someone how much we love them on one day of the year that probably wouldn't mean anything without all the corporate advertising?  Shouldn't we be more concerned about the days that actually mean something?  For example....an anniversary....a birthday...or on every other day of the year when you know that you love someone.
<br /><br />I'm not anti-romance here....just against being forced to be romantic.  And what about all the singletons?  beng forced to spend the evening alone, or with other singletons....just to stick the knife in that extra millimeter...  and all this blown up from a simple celebration....The feast of Saint Valentine.....who died standing up to the Romans.  A simple priest who didn't believe that men in the army should not be allowed to marry as it made them weak.
<br /><br />So we go from a guy who thought the men in the army should be allowed to get married if they want to......and end up at a place where if you're in a relationship, you have to sum it all up in one day.  and how?  By spending cash.....funny that, what with it being just after christmas.....no wonder so many people are dissappointed.  They either feel too pressurised, or they have expectations that are far too high on a day that doesn't mean anything to anyone.
<br /><br />and for the single people....they just have to sit back and wallow in their singledom.  Screw that!!
<br /><br />Forget about all the media....all the corporate advertising.  If you lov someone, and you feel like telling them....for F**k's sake, just tell them!  Life's too short to wait for the next Valentine's Day.
<br /><br />Every day is more important than the last....make the best of it.  And if you can't make the best of it, then at least try...regret is a pain worse than heartache.

The doctor coudn't see anything obvious, so I had to have blood tests to see if that shows anything up.  Here's hoping...
<br /><br />It doesn't make it any easier that I ended up sleeping through 3 alarm clocks this morning and ended up being late for work....Hopefully this can all get sorted out pretty quickly....I honestly thought I was going to get sacked this morning because of it. Thankfully they all knew I haven't been feeling too good, and they were more worried than angry. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/wacko.gif" alt=":)" /> 
<br /><br />It's really crap though, because I can't focus on anything and I've been living on sugar to stay awake...and passing out for a split second every couple of minutes isn't too good either.
<br /><br />well, I think I'm going to try to sleep or something.....need to find a way to get better.
