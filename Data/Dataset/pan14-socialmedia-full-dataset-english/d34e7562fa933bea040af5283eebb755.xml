It has been one of my favorite synthetic wig styles for a long time.  I love the way that it is so full of beautiful, thick curls and the length is close to that of my natural hair.<br />Here are some of the reasons that I like the Osso Top Lace Vanessa Wig.<br /><br />The main thing that I like about my Osso Top Lace Vanessa Wig is the fact that it looks so natural.  It is not shiny like some of the other brands of synthetic wigs I have worn in the past.  It also does not have that telltale plastic look that gives it away as being a synthetic wig.  Since the cap is made of sheer lace it gives the appearance of that the hairs are growing right out of my scalp and I can change the part without worrying about anyone seeing the cap.  I have been wearing an Osso Top Lace Vanessa Wig on and off for almost a year and no one can even tell that it is not my natural hair.<br /><br />In addition to it being virtually undetectable by others, my Osso Top Lace Vanessa Wig is extremely comfortable to wear that I barely even notice it as I go about my busy day.  The adjustable strap in the back allows me to fit it snug to the size of my head.  The combs located at the sides and back of this Vanessa Wig hold it securely in place no matter how long my day is or how active I am.  It is also very easy to put on my Osso Top Lace Vanessa Wig in the morning.  All that I need to do is put my natural hair up out of the way, position the combs and put it in place.<br /><br />I make sure that I take good care of my Osso Top Lace Vanessa Wig while I am wearing it and while it is stored on a wig stand between uses.  I wash it on a regular basis and I am always careful to be sure that I keep it from tangling.  After I am done rinsing out the shampoo, I use a conditioner to keep the synthetic hair fibers in great condition.  I only use a conditioner that is supposed to be rinsed out because I read in a magazine that the leave-in conditioners can actually damage the synthetic hair fibers over time and cause them to break off.<br /><br />I like the Vanessa Wig called Elana and I always have at least two of them in my personal wig collection at all times.  That way I know that I will be able to wear my favorite Vanessa Wig style even if I just washed one of them and it is still air drying.  This synthetic Vanessa Wig has beautiful, long flowing hair with just a bit of curl that starts about half way down the length.  The adhesive strips are often the type of product recommended for people that are new at using wigs that do not have combs to hold them in place.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fcurrent.com%2Fusers%2Fvanessabeck1230.htm"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://current.com/users/vanessabeck1230.htm</a>

Here are some recommendations for Vanessa Wig styles that will compliment the natural features of the five main facial shapes.<br /><br />You can wear just about any style of Vanessa Wig if your face is a general oval shape with the width a little smaller than the length.  All of the Vanessa Wig styles will accentuate the features and shape of your face.  For people with an oval face, the main concern is making sure that the color is appropriate for their skin tone.<br /><br />For a rectangular or oblong face, which is much longer than it is wide, you should stick with a style that is short or medium in length because the longer styles will make your face seem even lengthier.  Fringes or layers on the sides will help compensate for the length of your face by making it seem wider.  A great Vanessa Wig style for you might be the top lace wig called Tabon.<br /><br />When your facial shape looks similar to a circle, you need to avoid any wig styles that are curled on the sides of your face because they will make your face look fuller.  A great way to detract from the roundness of your face is to wear a you can wear just about any style of Vanessa Wig style that falls past your chin.  Another thing that will help is wearing a style that has increased volume at the crown which gives the appearance of a longer face.  The top lace Vanessa Wig called Henny gives you the length you need without the curls near the ears that can be found in styles such as Dona or Osso.<br /><br />A square shaped face is similar to a circular face but it has a distinct jaw line and hair line that gives it more of an angular look.  If your face is shaped in this way, a long straight wig style will probably not look good.  For this face shape, you need something that is more like the Vanessa Wig called Kola.  Its asymmetrical part and fullness at the crown will help your face appear longer and thinner.<br /><br />The final facial shape is the one that looks very much like a heart.  Often with this facial shape, people will have a pointed chin and a wide forehead with possibly a hairline that forms a downward point in the center.  When your face is heart- shaped, you want to avoid Vanessa Wig styles that end at or above the level of your chin because they tend to enhance the narrowness of the bottom of your face.  Instead, you should look for something like the Vanessa Wig called Elana.  This wig style breaks up the wide forehead with an asymmetrical part and adds the appearance of width for the chin.<br /><br />I have rather short natural hair and I think that wearing my Delly Vanessa Wig half wig is the best way to add lots of volume, length, and style to my natural hair.  I have always wanted to grow my natural hair long, but it is not very healthy and it tends to break off or get split ends long before it gets as long as I want my hair to grow.<br /><br />A friend of mine told me that she likes to wear a Vanessa Wig when she is having trouble growing out her natural hair.  I am definitely hooked on this style of Vanessa Wig half wig.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.scamsites.info%2Fstory.php%3Fid%3D1108194"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.scamsites.info/story.php?id=1108194</a>

A small amount of the liquid bonding glue is applied to the skin along the perimeter of the hair line and then the edge of the wig is pressed onto it until it firmly sticks in place.  In order to remove a wig that is secured with liquid bonding glue, the wearer needs to use a compatible glue remover to dissolve the adhesive.  It is important that none of the glue or glue remover be dripped on the synthetic hair fibers of the wig or it could cause damage to them.<br /><br />The other common type of product that you can use to secure your Vanessa Wig is adhesive strips that are made just for this job.

Since they are so easy and convenient to use, many people keep several different styles of Vanessa Wig half wigs on hand so that they can always have the perfect hair style for whatever they have planned for the day.

My natural hair is currently very short and styled in a pixie cut.  I used to have very long natural hair, but due to medical problems I lost my hair.  My natural hair is just starting to grow back and it will be quite a long time before it is back to the length that it used to be.  I am comfortable with my short pixie hair cut, but I really missed having my long, flowing natural hair.  Wearing my Elana Vanessa Wig allows me to feel and look similar to the way that I did before all of my natural hair was lost.<br /><br />My husband loves my Elana Vanessa Wig because he says that I seem to be much happier when I am wearing that style.  I never really paid attention to my mood while wearing any of the other Vanessa Wig styles, but since Elana is the closest style to my former natural hair I guess that it is only logical that it would make me seem happier to my husband.<br /><br />I think that I will probably continue to keep at least one Elana Vanessa Wig in my house even after my natural hair has reached its former length.  That way I can simply put on the Elana wig whenever I am having a bad hair day or running late and do not have time to fix up my natural hair.  No one will have any idea that I am wearing a wig because very few people even realize I am wearing one now.<br /><br />There are few things that are more embarrassing than having your wig slip out of place or come off in public.  There are several ways that you can secure your Vanessa Wig in order to avoid this embarrassing situation.  Your Vanessa Wig will most likely not be equipped with the combs that you might be used to using to securely hold your wigs in place.  However, there are products available that you can use to be sure that your Vanessa Wig will stay where it is supposed to be no matter how long your day is or how active you are while you are wearing it.<br /><br />One type of product that you can use to secure your Vanessa Wig is liquid bonding glue.  This specially formulated glue will not cause damage to your Vanessa Wig and does not usually cause any type of problems for the skin of the people that use it.  Of course, there is always the possibility of someone having an allergic reaction to the liquid bonding glue.  That is why it is very important to test these products on a small section of your skin before using them to secure your Vanessa Wig.  A small amount of the liquid bonding glue is applied to the skin along the perimeter of the hair line and then the edge of the wig is pressed onto it until it firmly sticks in place.  The adhesive strips are often the type of product recommended for people that are new at using wigs that do not have combs to hold them in place.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fvanessabeck1230.imagekind.com%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://vanessabeck1230.imagekind.com/</a>

Since the cap is made of sheer lace it gives the appearance of that the hairs are growing right out of my scalp and I can change the part without worrying about anyone seeing the cap.  I have been wearing an Osso Top Lace Vanessa Wig on and off for almost a year and no one can even tell that it is not my natural hair.<br /><br />In addition to it being virtually undetectable by others, my Osso Top Lace Vanessa Wig is extremely comfortable to wear that I barely even notice it as I go about my busy day.  The adjustable strap in the back allows me to fit it snug to the size of my head.  The combs located at the sides and back of this Vanessa Wig hold it securely in place no matter how long my day is or how active I am.  It is also very easy to put on my Osso Top Lace Vanessa Wig in the morning.  All that I need to do is put my natural hair up out of the way, position the combs and put it in place.<br /><br />I make sure that I take good care of my Osso Top Lace Vanessa Wig while I am wearing it and while it is stored on a wig stand between uses.  I wash it on a regular basis and I am always careful to be sure that I keep it from tangling.  After I am done rinsing out the shampoo, I use a conditioner to keep the synthetic hair fibers in great condition.  I only use a conditioner that is supposed to be rinsed out because I read in a magazine that the leave-in conditioners can actually damage the synthetic hair fibers over time and cause them to break off.<br /><br />I like the Vanessa Wig called Elana and I always have at least two of them in my personal wig collection at all times.  That way I know that I will be able to wear my favorite Vanessa Wig style even if I just washed one of them and it is still air drying.  This synthetic Vanessa Wig has beautiful, long flowing hair with just a bit of curl that starts about half way down the length.  I usually prefer to buy the hair color that closely matches my natural hair color, but sometimes I will go a couple shades darker or a couple shades lighter to give myself a different look.<br /><br />I have tried some of the other Vanessa Wig styles, but I finally decided that Elana is my favorite because I really like the way the long strands brush across my shoulders.
