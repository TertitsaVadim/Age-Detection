<br /><br />The soldier in a war zone dating scam has been around for a few years now but it’s surprising how many people dating online remain unaware of it.
<br /><br />Nigerian and Russian scammers have long used the old “I’m a civil engineer working in Nigeria or Russia …. oops I’ve been robbed/got sick/got a great business deal and need a financial loan” trick to scam money out of trusting people they meet online.
<br /><br />The serviceman scam stoops to an even deeper low, playing on people’s patriotism, sympathies and trust.
<br /><br />When it began the soldier scam usually said they were a soldier (from US or UK) serving in Iraq but as public popularity for the Iraq war dwindled Afghanistan became the war zone of choice.
<br /><br />This is how the scam works:
<br /><br />After registering with an online dating site the scammer uploads a photo of a soldier they have downloaded from a facebook page or army recruiting website and then copies and pastes a great profile writeup from a script.
<br /><br />They immediately send a short but friendly message to numerous women on the site introducing themselves and asking about the woman.
<br /><br />You reply, saying a little about yourself and asking about him.
<br /><br />When they respond they will give very little away about themselves, again responding to what you have told them and asking questions about you. They will also give an email or msn address where you can contact them offsite.
<br /><br />NB … the more you tell a stranger about yourself, particularly personal stories, the closer you feel to them because there is a bond of trust … scammers use this against you and the more you tell the more trust you show.
<br /><br />In their second or third email they will tell you they are a US or UK soldier serving in Afghanistan or Iraq … they say they hope that doesn’t scare you … and they have one child they are totally devoted to.
<br /><br />The story then varies depending on which script the scammer is working from …. either they are a widower or divorced …. sometimes their ex/deceased wife was a Nigerian, if so the child may have gone to stay with his ex/deceased wife’s mother in Nigeria while he is away at war, or else the child is with his own mother in UK or US while they are in Afghanistan (this depends wether they have contacts in the UK or US to channel the money through).
<br /><br />After they feel they have your trust and you are emotionally hooked (usually after declarations of love or commitment to a long term relationship) they will start to mention how worried they are because they’ve heard their child is sick. This can either be a gradual process or they will receive a call with the heartbreaking news while they are talking to you online or by phone.
<br /><br />Then the first request to borrow money will arrive to pay for emergency medical care for their child … obviously they can’t send money from Afghanistan, it’s a war zone but will pay you back as soon as they get home.
<br /><br />If you send money the requests will keep coming as their imaginary child gets sicker and the medical bills mount up … oh and don’t forget his dear old mother who has to stay in a hotel next to the hospital.
<br /><br />This scam is quite successful because you have a patriotic soldier putting life and limb on the line each day. One who has gone through heartbreak and tough times emotionally (showing his vulnerable side) and of course one that is totally committed to loving and caring for you for the rest of your life … they are exactly what you have been looking for, a real life knight in shining armour.
<br /><br />A professional woman in the UK was scammed out of £10,000 by this very type of scam …. please don’t fall for it.
<br /><br />My apologies to the genuine US soldier in the photo used in this article, I simply copied it from google images to show how easy it is and I hope the soldier in the picture (and his family) would understand my intention is simply to keep women safe by explaining how the soldier scam works.
<br /><br />Share and Enjoy:

Scammers try to work very fast in most cases and IM is much faster than conversating through emails and web site messages. 
<br /> Another reason scammers want to get you away from the site is to keep you from seeing any warnings that may be posted on the profiles. Check profiles very carefully and pay attention to how they are written as opposed to how they talk on instant messanger. 
<br /> Many times, when someone you meet gives you their email address, you can find them on other sites by doing a search on your favorite search engine site. They could already be listed on a few scammer awareness sites. 
<br /> scammers are not the &quot;nice guys&quot; they make themselves appear to be. When they don't get what they want from you, they can be very mean and many times threatening. Usually threats are their last attempt to try and intimidate you into sending them money. They will tell you they know where you are and have friends that can &quot;get you&quot; but don't believe it. 
<br />Scammers will tell you they have fallen in love with you within the first few messages or chats. They want to come be with you but all of a sudden, some crisis happens and they don't have the money, can't get to the money or for some other false reasons, you are the only person that can help them. 
<br /><br />Scammers net millions if not billions of dollars each year world wide. IC3 reports that in 2009, Americans lost almost 560 million dollars to scams. Scammers take advantage of honest, hard working people looking for people that are lonely or recently had a tragedy in their life and play with their emotions.

<br /><br />However, Nigerian dating scam (or romance scam), besides just asking for money for their studies, sick relatives, etc.. usually involves this scheme: the scammers upload fake attractive photos, in most cases of white people. They pretend to be the foreign specialists working in Nigeria or Ghana (usually originally from US and UK, but it may also be Canada, Australia or any other European country).
<br /><br />After they establish some lovely correspondence with you, fall in love and maybe even send a couple of cheap presents, they will either:
<br /><br />a) be almost on their way to meet you, but something will happen to them: they will get robbed, beaten, get into the hospital, or other misfortune will happen and of course you will be their only contact to ask for financial help, or:
<br /><br /><img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/4210//smilies/cool.gif" alt=":)" /> tell you that their employer pays them with Money Orders, and they can't cash them in Nigeria. They will send you the Money Orders and ask you to deposit them into your bank account and then wire the money to them via Western Union. Usually they say to keep some money for your trouble. Needless to say, those Money Orders are no good, and not even worth the paper they're printed on. If you cash them or deposit them into your account, Money Orders will come back after few weeks as fraudulent and you will be responsible for paying back the money to the bank and sometimes even charged for passing counterfeit instrument.
<br /><br />There is also a re-shipping scam, when they will ask you to re-ship goods for them. These goods are purchased with stolen credit cards. Never re-ship anything for strangers, especially to Africa. There is a reason why online merchants usually don't ship there.
<br /><br />There are also military scams (for God Sake, there are NO American Generals browsing dating sites and NO military man will EVER ask you for money. Then there is a recovery scam - a scammer recontacting you pretending to be FBI, EFCC or any other authority, telling he can help you recover your money... but for a fee, of course. And finaly there is a &quot;stuck parcel&quot; scam, when they supposedly sent you goods/gifts, but they got stuck somewhere on the way (for example, on the customs) and you have to pay to &quot;customs&quot;/bogus shipping company to get them. All types of scams are described in details on Romancescam. 
<br />  Email Address:
<br /><br />Example: <a href="/go/messages/send/receiver=joe@domain.com">joe@domain.com</a>
<br /><br />Please remember: white people in Nigeria or Ghana contacting you on the dating sites or socail networks are always 100% scam. No exceptions. There are no white engineers or female models stranded there. It is always scam. Once you stop giving it a benefit of doubt like newbies sometimes do, you will be safe.
<br /><br />When we say &quot;Nigerian scam&quot;, it doesn't mean it originates from Nigeria only. It may also originate from any other West African country, like Ghana, Ivory Coast, Senegal etc.. But recently Malaysia became a real hotspot for Nigerian scams. There is a huge Nigerian cell operating out of Malaysia, targeting mostly Asian women. Please keep in mind: all these white engineers supposedly from the UK, but appearing in Malaysia, with awful spelling are in reality Nigerian scammers.
<br /><br />Where do scammers get their photos from? Many of their photos are taken from the modeling sites, like focushawaii, modelmayhem, newfaces, etc... Female pictures are almost always of the Internet porn models. But with male pictures, recently they started shifting from modeling pictures and mostly send pictures of ordinary men: either of their ex-victims or stolen from social networks, like myspace, tagged or facebook. Please visit our new picture blog Scamdigger, to see if a pic in question has been known to be used in scams. 
<br /><br />You should always keep in mind: the photos you see on the scammers profiles ARE NOT the actual faces of people who are scamming you! It is very important to understand that you are NOT looking at the photos of scammers, those are photos of innocent people that scammers use, and in a way those people are victims too. To see how scammers look like in reality, please check our hall of shame, Scammers 4 real.
<br /><br />The scammers have many faces: not only they frequently change names, e-mails and photos, but they may list themselves on different dating sites as being of different gender, race, age, location and sexual orientation. Sometimes on the opposite: many scammers may simultaneously use the photos of the same person, like for example the images of this poor guy: looks like half of Nigeria is using his photos.

<br />A person registers at an online dating service and creates a profile. The profile will include information, and possibly a photograph, of the person along with a way for interested people to make contact.
<br /><br />In due course, a scammer contacts the person posing as someone interested in exploring a possible romantic relationship.
<br /><br />The victim responds and the pair begins corresponding regularly. They may soon bypass the dating service contact system and start communicating directly, usually via email.
<br /><br />Over time, the scammer will slowly earn the trust of the victim. He or she may discuss family, jobs and other details designed to make the correspondent seem like a real person who is genuinely interested in the victim. Photographs may be exchanged. However, the &amp;quot;person&amp;quot; that the victim thinks he or she is corresponding with, is likely to be purely an invention of the scammer. Photographs may not even show the real sender. The victim's apparent love interest may look completely different to the person in the photograph and, in reality, may not even be the same gender.
<br /><br />After the scammer has established the illusion of a genuine and meaningful relationship, he or she will begin asking the victim for money. For example. the scammer may claim that he or she wants to meet in person and ask the victim to send money for an airfare so that a meeting can take place. Or the scammer may claim that there has been a family medical emergency and request financial assistance. The scammer may use a variety of excuses to entice the victim to send funds.
<br /><br />If the victim complies and sends money, he or she will probably receive further such requests. With his or her judgement clouded by a burgeoning love for the scammer's imaginary character, he or she may continue to send money.
<br /><br />Finally, the victim will come to realize that he or she has been duped, perhaps after waiting fruitlessly at the airport for a &amp;quot;lover&amp;quot; who, will, of course, never arrive.
<br /><br />Meanwhile, the scammer pockets the money and moves on to the next victim. In fact, the scammer may be stringing along several victims simultaneously. 
<br />In many cases, the victim will not only have lost out financially, but will also be left broken-hearted and thoroughly disillusioned. These scammers tend to prey on victims that may be especially lonely, shy or isolated and therefore more vulnerable.
<br /><br />There are a number of variations on the same basic scam. In some cases the scammers may be the one to create a profile on a dating site and wait for a potential victim to contact them. Typically, the profile will include a photograph of a very attractive young woman who will have no trouble attracting would-be suitors.
<br /><br />In other cases, the scammers may simply send out random unsolicited emails professing a desire to begin a relationship in the hope that some gullible recipients will favourably respond. Alternatively, they may strike up a conversation with a potential victim via an Internet chat room.
<br /><br />In some variations of the scam, the fraudsters may not ask for money directly. Instead, they may ask their victim to cash money orders or cheques and wire them the proceeds. The money orders or cheques will turn out to be fake or stolen and the victim will be left out of pocket and possibly held responsible for receiving stolen funds. The scammers may also try to trick victims into revealing sensitive information such as credit card numbers.
<br /><br />If you begin corresponding with a person with a view to a possible romantic relationship, remain cautious even if the relationship seems to be progressing very well. These scammers are very skilled at building trust and know how to make vulnerable victims fall in love with them. Regardless of the strength of your feelings towards a correspondent, you should view any requests for money as highly suspicious. Internet dating scammers often used the same names, family details and cover stories in multiple dating scams. Therefore, you may be able to expose a scam by conducting Internet searches on the names used by the scammers or key phrases from their emails.
