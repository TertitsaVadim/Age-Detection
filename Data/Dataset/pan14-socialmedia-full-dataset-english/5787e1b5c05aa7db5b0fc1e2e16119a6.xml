Normally this causes no problems, but, there are circumstances when the fungus overgrows out of control, causing what we know as a yeast infection The basis for this is the lowering of your body's &quot;good bacteria&quot; below a critical level such that there isn't sufficient good bacteria to contain and manage the Candida.<br /><br />This can occur through a number of factors of which these are only a few; lowered immune system, diabetes, drugs, antibiotics, steroids (inhalers for example), bad diet, stress, illness, transfer from a sexual partner with the infection, etc.<br /><br />For male yeast infection look out for a red/inflamed penis head, crazy itching, pain when urinating, smelly discharge, dry/flaking skin. In the mouth you will find white/yellowish spots on your tongue and mucous membranes, white coating, bad breath. You might also have difficulty swallowing if it is in your throat.<br /><br />Your treatment is normally by topically applied medications which you buy over-the-counter, or, through prescription. They are largely drug-based and so depend on the efficacy of the drugs. However, as is well known, the Candida can and does build a resistance to them over time, and, they can have side-effects. There is also a body of opinion that believes that these normal medications treat only the symptoms, not the actual root cause. The outcome for many males and females is that the yeast infection either, is difficult and time consuming to eradicate completely, or, the yeast infection goes (or seems to go) but then comes back even worse than before.

I won't go into detail about why this is, but you should be aware that drugs only address the symptoms not the root causes of your infections.<br /><br />These underlying issues can be things like; having diabetes, overusing antibiotics, a lowered immune system, contraception, poor nutrition, a drug habit, steroids, stress, obesity, pregnancy, etc. So that the drugs you take for your infection aren't addressing anything like these.<br /><br />Now, this gets us back to why you keep getting a yeast infection after intercourse...<br /><br />Although intercourse or sex in any form cannot actually cause a yeast infection, it can definitely 'transfer' the infection back and forth between sexual partners. So let's say you have an infection and have sex with somebody who doesn't, you can pass the infection onto them, which will take some time to show up.<br /><br />Now let's say you take your drug-based meds and the 'symptoms' clear-up. As far as you're concerned your free of infection. But it's still in your system. And the next time you have sex with the partner, it will be transferred back to you, compounding the infection you already have. This is a vicious cycle that you need to break-out off.<br /><br />And the first step is to stop all sexual contact. I know it's tough, but we're talking about you and your partner(s)' health here. This is the first important step. The next is to discover which natural home remedies will work best for you in terms of actually curing your yeast infection. Now, there are many out there, too many to go over here, except to say they use things like herbs, diet, probiotics, homeopathy, supplements, and so on.<br /><br />But you don't have to spend weeks searching for these, you can get all the information you need in one downloadable report (see below) that thousands of women and men have successfully used to cure their yeast infections naturally, without expensive drugs with their horrible side effects. And they've stopped getting yeast infections after intercourse!<br /><br />Yeast infection can be a nuisance and cause a lot of discomfort to those who get the infection. It can be very frustrating when you have tried out several treatment methods but the infection does not seem to go away. It is caused by Candida ablicans, harmless fungi which is naturally found in our bodies. The nature of these micro organisms is to grow and increase their numbers, however if they multiply out of control they become harmful. Their population is therefore regulated by other harmless bacteria found in the body that feeds on yeast so as to keep it in control. Hormonal body changes such as pregnancy, menses and other health issues such as weak immune system or diabetes are among the triggers for the overgrowth of yeast bacteria.<br /><br />Natural yeast treatment methods have proven to be very effective in getting rid of yeast infection. They not only cure the infection but also have no side effects to your general health. One of the natural and home made treatments recommended is application of sugarless yoghurt to the infected area. Yoghurt contains bacteria that are very useful in fighting the yeast bacteria. Yeast thrive in conditions of high pH therefore yoghurt which is acidic lowers the pH discouraging yeast to grow. The bacteria feed on sugar hence the reason for sugarless yoghurt so as not to encourage yeast to grow.

Studies show that 70% of people will develop an infection at some point in their lives, so unfortunately if you are afflicted, you are not the only one suffering needlessly.<br /><br />In my personal quest for gathering as much information as I can about my own health I've read tons of books and the funny thing is that most of the time the ones on the best seller lists aren't nearly as good as the E-books you can find on the subject online. The following book I'm reviewing here is just one of those.<br /><br />The book entitled Yeast Infection No More is a nice E-book for both beginners and experienced individuals dealing with Candida Yeast Infections. The book covers quite a bit in it's full 200 pages of information. It's possibly the largest E-book I've ever read. I have quite a lot of experience with Candida myself and this book was still enlightening in a lot of ways. There were times though when I read through the book and was a little overwhelmed at the amount of information that the author Linda Allen was able to accumulate, a self proclaimed Candida recovery. She covers the basics explaining what Candida is, the diet restrictions and supplement regime. The book also explains a 12 hour protocol used to bring relief within that time frame.<br /><br />Knowing how hard it can be to find the RIGHT information on Candida cleansing it's nice to see that she has compiled everything from liver flushes to parasite cleanses in here as well, all in full detail as to how to complete them. Going from the most trivial to deep rooted infections, her methods of cleansing apply to all. Leaving nothing out she discusses the lifestyle changes an individual needs to make as well to accommodate a cleanse as well as preventing Candida from returning. There's so much information for someone to know who wants to do a cleanse like this that the information needs to flow easily and I feel she's done a pretty good job there as well. Overall I feel beginners to Candida cleansing may be quite surprised how much there is to it, but on the flip side she made sure to cover everything and left virtually nothing out.<br /><br />Outside of this book, I would recommend people battling candida yeast infections to research Dr. Hulda Clark and Bob Beck protocols. These two developed technology that can destroy parasites and fungal infections within the body using electrical frequencies.<br /><br />There's more to candida cleansing than some probiotics and anti-fungals, a good guide that comprises everything you need to know is a good start. On top of that she even offers her services as a nutritionist online. The program is 100% natural so you won't have to experience side effects. And because the cure is fast and permanent these people have been able to save a lot of money because they haven't needed to continually pay for more over-the-counter, and, prescription medications.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5mbGl4eWEuY29tL2Jsb2cvNDMwOTgyMi9odHRweWVhc3RpbmZlY3Rpb25ub21vcmVzY2FtYmxvZ3Nwb3Rjb20_" target="_blank">Yeast Cures - A Holistic Approach</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2pvZXlicm93bmluZzEyLmppZ3N5LmNvbS9lbnRyaWVzL2dlbmVyYWwvbXktaG9uZXN0LXllYXN0LWluZmVjdGlvbi1uby1tb3JlLXJldmlldw__" target="_blank">My Honest Yeast Infection No More Review</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy56aWtpLmNvbS9lbi9qb2V5LWJyb3duaW5nKzEwOTk2MDYvcG9zdC9odHRwOi8veWVhc3RpbmYrMTQyNzcxNjQ_" target="_blank"><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fyeastinfectionnomorescam.blogspot.com%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://yeastinfectionnomorescam.blogspot.com/</a></a>

Well it can look like many things, depending on where you have the yeast infection...<br /><br />In the mouth you will notice a thick white coating on the tongue, white / yellow raised spots on the tongue &amp;amp; mucous membranes, difficulty swallowing, some throat pain and bad breath.<br /><br />For the vagina, it's what the yeast infection 'feels like' rather than what it looks like. You have pain during intercourse, inability to have intercourse, inflammation / itching of vagina, vaginal odor, white vaginal discharge, pain when urinating, menstrual pain.<br /><br />The penis will show pain during intercourse, inability to have intercourse / impotence, head of penis is inflamed &amp;amp; can itch like crazy, red spots / blisters on the head, unusual discharge, pain when urinating, dry / cracked skin.<br /><br />There are other, quite surprising, signs of a yeast infection such as chronic rash, acne, irritability, mood swings, memory loss, depression, fatigue, aching or swelling joints, etc.<br /><br />So, that's what a yeast infection looks like, what can you do about it?...<br /><br />Your normal remedy is to use prescription drugs or over-the-counter drugs. But many people are finding that there can be side-effects with these, and, that although the signs of yeast infection may go away, they regularly come back. It is thought that this is due to the fact that the Candida becomes resistant to the drugs and the drugs may only be treating the symptoms not the root cause; Candida Albicans. And the result of nasty recurring yeast infections is that they can destroy your sense of well-being and even relationships.<br /><br />Because of this very many folks around the world (it's a huge problem worldwide, you're not alone) have found a fast, permanent cure using a 100% natural treatment regime, the details of which they found on the Internet. And because it's 100% natural there are no drugs, no bad side-effects and no recurring yeast infections. Further more, relief from their symptoms was being reported within 12 hours, a fantastic achievement.<br /><br />Before beginning to talk to you about yeast cures, let me first explain what is causing your yeast infection. Candida albicans is a yeast or fungus that inhabits the intestinal tract of 80% of humans. It sits there quite happily without any ill-effects, most of the time, its numbers controlled by other, similar, microorganisms which together make up the 'gut flora'.<br /><br />It is most frequently found that yeast infections are the second most common instigators of vaginal discharge, discomfort, itching and burning. Yeasts are found in the vagina of between 20% and 50% of healthy women, but a change of conditions in the vagina can cause the yeasts to multiply.<br /><br />The use of antibiotics and steroids is the most frequent reason for yeast overgrowth, but pregnancy, menstruation, sperm, diabetes, and birth control pills can also play a part in initiating a Candida infection, which become more common following the menopause.<br /><br />When we fall ill, we turn to our doctors for advice. You have nothing to lose but your?? infection because the eBook comes with a 60 days no questions asked money back guarantee.<br /><br />I also used to be a chronic candida infection sufferer. Yeast Infection No More gave me the knowledge to cure my condition.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2NvbW11bml0eS5hdG9tLmNvbS9Qb3N0L0EtWWVhc3QtSW5mZWN0aW9uLUxvb2tzLUxpa2UtV2hhdC8wM0VGQkZGRkYwMjc5MjM5QTAwMDgwMTlCOUJFMg__" target="_blank">Yeast Cures * A Holistic Approach</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2pvZXlicm93bmluZzEyNjI0LndlYnMuY29tL2FwcHMvYmxvZy9zaG93LzEzOTgxNzgyLXllYXN0aW5mZWN0aW9ubm9tb3Jlc2NhbS1ibG9nc3BvdC1jb20t" target="_blank">How for you to Use Boric Acid for Yeast Infection</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wdXJldm9sdW1lLmNvbS9qb2V5YnJvd25pbmcxMi9wb3N0cy8xMDc2MjU4L3llYXN0aW5mZWN0aW9ubm9tb3Jlc2NhbS5ibG9nc3BvdC5jb20_" target="_blank">How for you to Use Boric Acid with regard to Yeast Infection</a>

You'll find out exactly what a yeast infection looks like here, i.e. Yeast thrive in conditions of high pH therefore yoghurt which is acidic lowers the pH discouraging yeast to grow. The bacteria feed on sugar hence the reason for sugarless yoghurt so as not to encourage yeast to grow. Other forms of reliable natural treatment are vinegar, tea tree oil Gentian violet and garlic. The method is easier because you do not need to have a prescription and is available in homes. They can be taken orally as food or applied on the infected area.<br /><br />However there is over the counter or prescription for yeast infection treatment that are available. They can be applied as creams, sprayed or taken orally. They are very good for providing relief for the itching and discomfort that comes with yeast infection. Boric acid is a useful product for severe yeast infection treatment. This may happen after experiencing recurring yeast infection over and over without any successful form of treatment. As an acid it lowers the pH of the infected area whether on the vagina or penis, so as to discourage yeast growth and survival.<br /><br />It is available as capsules that are put boric acid in powder form.

You'll find out exactly what a yeast infection looks like here, i.e. what the symptoms of a yeast infection are, and, how to cure your yeast infection using a totally natural treatment without any drugs.<br /><br />First though, your yeast infection is caused by a fungus called Candida Albicans which resides in you naturally. Under normal conditions it doesn't cause you any problems because your body's good bacteria keeps it in check, at manageable levels. But, under abnormal circumstances it can &quot;overgrow&quot; into a more virulent state which causes the infection we know as a yeast infection.<br /><br />The sorts of things that can cause this overgrow are things like; diabetes, use of 'recreational drugs', overuse of antibiotics, overuse of steroids (e.g. inhalers), lowered immune system, unhealthy diet, stress, contraception, wearing damp / sweaty undergarments and many more.<br /><br />O.K. then, what does a yeast infection look like? Well it can look like many things, depending on where you have the yeast infection...<br /><br />In the mouth you will notice a thick white coating on the tongue, white / yellow raised spots on the tongue &amp;amp; mucous membranes, difficulty swallowing, some throat pain and bad breath.<br /><br />For the vagina, it's what the yeast infection 'feels like' rather than what it looks like. If diarrhoea is the most common after effect of using antibiotics then a yeast infection, or Thrush, is the second most common.<br /><br />Candida infections will commonly be found in areas that are warm and moist. These comprise the mouth, the armpits, the groin and genital area, beneath the breasts and in folds of skin on the lower body. Candida albicans can also cause a systemic infection by passing into the bloodstream. It does not simply offer another quick-fix remedy, this is a well researched and tested program that offers a holistic approach to the problem of yeast infection and, if the author's advice is followed, will completely rid you of your yeast infection for good.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3llYXN0aW5mZWN0aW9ubm9tb3Jlc2NhbS5ibG9nc3BvdC5jb20v" target="_blank">Why a Natural Cure For Yeast Infection - A Review</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wdXJldm9sdW1lLmNvbS9qb2V5YnJvd25pbmcxMi9wb3N0cy8xMDc2MzI0L01hbGUrWWVhc3QrSW5mZWN0aW9uK0V4cG9zZWQrYW5kK0N1cmVk" target="_blank"><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fyeastinfectionnomorescam.blogspot.com%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://yeastinfectionnomorescam.blogspot.com/</a></a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2NvbW11bml0eS5hdG9tLmNvbS9Qb3N0L3llYXN0aW5mZWN0aW9ubm9tb3Jlc2NhbWJsb2dzcG90Y29tLzAzRUZCRkZGRjAyNzkyMzlBMDAwODAxOUI5Q0Uy" target="_blank">yeastinfectionnomorescam.blogspot.com/</a>

Studies show that 70% of people will develop an infection at some point in their lives, so unfortunately if you are afflicted, you are not the only one suffering needlessly.<br /><br />Yeast infection can be a nuisance and cause a lot of discomfort to those who get the infection. It can be very frustrating when you have tried out several treatment methods but the infection does not seem to go away. It is caused by Candida ablicans, harmless fungi which is naturally found in our bodies. The nature of these micro organisms is to grow and increase their numbers, however if they multiply out of control they become harmful. Their population is therefore regulated by other harmless bacteria found in the body that feeds on yeast so as to keep it in control. Hormonal body changes such as pregnancy, menses and other health issues such as weak immune system or diabetes are among the triggers for the overgrowth of yeast bacteria.<br /><br />Natural yeast treatment methods have proven to be very effective in getting rid of yeast infection. They not only cure the infection but also have no side effects to your general health. One of the natural and home made treatments recommended is application of sugarless yoghurt to the infected area. Yoghurt contains bacteria that are very useful in fighting the yeast bacteria. Yeast thrive in conditions of high pH therefore yoghurt which is acidic lowers the pH discouraging yeast to grow. Expectant women should not use boric acid for treatment yeast infection. Boric acid can be used with other forms of natural treatment such as yoghurt and aloe Vera for efficient treatment. Boric acid should be kept away from an open wound or cut.<br /><br />Sex with a yeast infection is definitely not advised if you, or your partner, has a yeast infection. To continue would be to severely limit the possibility of a cure. Indeed to continue having sex with a yeast infection might mean that you never achieve a proper cure, and, that while the symptoms may disappear from time to time, the yeast infection just keeps returning. Here, you will discover what causes your infection, and, how to achieve a fast, permanent cure, so that you can resume your relationship free from yeast infection.<br /><br />The most important thing to understand about having sex with a yeast infection is that the infection can be transmitted from one partner to another, even although sex itself is not the underlying cause of yeast infection. By knowing this, and accepting it, you are halfway to eradicating your infection. The first step in the process is to cut-out sexual activity while proceeding with your treatment.

And as you cleanse your system to eliminate Candida you will fill more energized than ever.<br /><br />Supposedly every review must talk about the good and bad things of the product being reviewed. But I can't find anything wrong with Yeast Infection No More.?? Or maybe there is one thing and that is that this eBook is so inexpensive that a lot of people will buy it and never read it or take action on it.?? Believe it or not this happens, and more often than you think.<br /><br />Ok, so I hope this review has been helpful to you. If you are considering buying Yeast Infection No More you are in the right path. You have nothing to lose but your?? infection because the eBook comes with a 60 days no questions asked money back guarantee.<br /><br />I also used to be a chronic candida infection sufferer. I tried countless of medicines and methods that never really delivered lasting results until I understood that vaginal infections are the cause of an internal imbalance and until you resolve this imbalance you can't get rid of them. Yeast Infection No More gave me the knowledge to cure my condition.<br /><br />Yeast infection can be a nuisance and cause a lot of discomfort to those who get the infection. It can be very frustrating when you have tried out several treatment methods but the infection does not seem to go away. It is caused by Candida ablicans, harmless fungi which is naturally found in our bodies. The nature of these micro organisms is to grow and increase their numbers, however if they multiply out of control they become harmful. But, under abnormal circumstances it can &quot;overgrow&quot; into a more virulent state which causes the infection we know as a yeast infection.<br /><br />The sorts of things that can cause this overgrow are things like; diabetes, use of 'recreational drugs', overuse of antibiotics, overuse of steroids (e.g. inhalers), lowered immune system, unhealthy diet, stress, contraception, wearing damp / sweaty undergarments and many more.<br /><br />O.K. then, what does a yeast infection look like? Well it can look like many things, depending on where you have the yeast infection...<br /><br />In the mouth you will notice a thick white coating on the tongue, white / yellow raised spots on the tongue &amp;amp; mucous membranes, difficulty swallowing, some throat pain and bad breath.<br /><br />For the vagina, it's what the yeast infection 'feels like' rather than what it looks like. You have pain during intercourse, inability to have intercourse, inflammation / itching of vagina, vaginal odor, white vaginal discharge, pain when urinating, menstrual pain.<br /><br />The penis will show pain during intercourse, inability to have intercourse / impotence, head of penis is inflamed &amp;amp; can itch like crazy, red spots / blisters on the head, unusual discharge, pain when urinating, dry / cracked skin.<br /><br />There are other, quite surprising, signs of a yeast infection such as chronic rash, acne, irritability, mood swings, memory loss, depression, fatigue, aching or swelling joints, etc.<br /><br />So, that's what a yeast infection looks like, what can you do about it?...<br /><br />Your normal remedy is to use prescription drugs or over-the-counter drugs.

The Candida Albicans fungus which is the underlying cause of your yeast infection will eventually build-up a resistance to certain drugs.

It can be very frustrating when you have tried out several treatment methods but the infection does not seem to go away. It is caused by Candida ablicans, harmless fungi which is naturally found in our bodies. The nature of these micro organisms is to grow and increase their numbers, however if they multiply out of control they become harmful. Their population is therefore regulated by other harmless bacteria found in the body that feeds on yeast so as to keep it in control. Hormonal body changes such as pregnancy, menses and other health issues such as weak immune system or diabetes are among the triggers for the overgrowth of yeast bacteria.<br /><br />Natural yeast treatment methods have proven to be very effective in getting rid of yeast infection. They not only cure the infection but also have no side effects to your general health. One of the natural and home made treatments recommended is application of sugarless yoghurt to the infected area. Yoghurt contains bacteria that are very useful in fighting the yeast bacteria. Yeast thrive in conditions of high pH therefore yoghurt which is acidic lowers the pH discouraging yeast to grow. The bacteria feed on sugar hence the reason for sugarless yoghurt so as not to encourage yeast to grow. Other forms of reliable natural treatment are vinegar, tea tree oil Gentian violet and garlic. The method is easier because you do not need to have a prescription and is available in homes. They can be taken orally as food or applied on the infected area.<br /><br />However there is over the counter or prescription for yeast infection treatment that are available. They can be applied as creams, sprayed or taken orally. They are very good for providing relief for the itching and discomfort that comes with yeast infection. Boric acid is a useful product for severe yeast infection treatment. This may happen after experiencing recurring yeast infection over and over without any successful form of treatment.

Candida albicans is a yeast or fungus that inhabits the intestinal tract of 80% of humans. It sits there quite happily without any ill-effects, most of the time, its numbers controlled by other, similar, microorganisms which together make up the 'gut flora'.<br /><br />It is most frequently found that yeast infections are the second most common instigators of vaginal discharge, discomfort, itching and burning. Yeasts are found in the vagina of between 20% and 50% of healthy women, but a change of conditions in the vagina can cause the yeasts to multiply.<br /><br />The use of antibiotics and steroids is the most frequent reason for yeast overgrowth, but pregnancy, menstruation, sperm, diabetes, and birth control pills can also play a part in initiating a Candida infection, which become more common following the menopause.<br /><br />When we fall ill, we turn to our doctors for advice. If this results in a prescription for antibiotics or steroids we can be in danger of a Candida infection. The use of these medications can devastate the delicate balance of gut flora by killing off a huge proportion of the friendly bacteria which live in our gut. This leaves the way clear for Candida albicans to multiply out of control, leading to a yeast infection.<br /><br />Think for a moment, how many times have you experienced diarrhoea following a course of antibiotics? This is a direct result of the antibiotics killing off the friendly bacteria.

So let's say you have an infection and have sex with somebody who doesn't, you can pass the infection onto them, which will take some time to show up.<br /><br />Now let's say you take your drug-based meds and the 'symptoms' clear-up. As far as you're concerned your free of infection. She covers the basics explaining what Candida is, the diet restrictions and supplement regime. The book also explains a 12 hour protocol used to bring relief within that time frame.<br /><br />Knowing how hard it can be to find the RIGHT information on Candida cleansing it's nice to see that she has compiled everything from liver flushes to parasite cleanses in here as well, all in full detail as to how to complete them. Going from the most trivial to deep rooted infections, her methods of cleansing apply to all. Leaving nothing out she discusses the lifestyle changes an individual needs to make as well to accommodate a cleanse as well as preventing Candida from returning. There's so much information for someone to know who wants to do a cleanse like this that the information needs to flow easily and I feel she's done a pretty good job there as well. Overall I feel beginners to Candida cleansing may be quite surprised how much there is to it, but on the flip side she made sure to cover everything and left virtually nothing out.<br /><br />Outside of this book, I would recommend people battling candida yeast infections to research Dr. Hulda Clark and Bob Beck protocols. These two developed technology that can destroy parasites and fungal infections within the body using electrical frequencies.<br /><br />There's more to candida cleansing than some probiotics and anti-fungals, a good guide that comprises everything you need to know is a good start. On top of that she even offers her services as a nutritionist online. So if you get stuck in the cleanse or have any other nutritional questions she's there to help, and it's all free with the book.<br /><br />So overall I'm giving this book 4.5/5. A near perfect guide on how to cleanse yeast infections and candida.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;PROs:&lt;/b&gt;<br /><br />-Full of information on all aspects of candida cleansing<br /><br />-Information for those looking to get quick yeast infection relief, as well as long term relief.<br /><br />-Free online consultations with the creator of the book handles any other questions you may have.<br /><br />-The best source I've found so far on the topic of Yeast Infection Cleansing.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;CONs:&lt;/b&gt;<br /><br />-Those with A LOT of experience with Systemic Candida may find they know most of the information covered.<br /><br />Yeast infection can be a nuisance and cause a lot of discomfort to those who get the infection. It can be very frustrating when you have tried out several treatment methods but the infection does not seem to go away. It is caused by Candida ablicans, harmless fungi which is naturally found in our bodies. The nature of these micro organisms is to grow and increase their numbers, however if they multiply out of control they become harmful.
