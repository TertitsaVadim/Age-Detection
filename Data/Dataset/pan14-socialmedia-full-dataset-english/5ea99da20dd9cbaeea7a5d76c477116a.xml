<br />other boys
<br />his age rather
<br />curious.
<br /><br />He had been hearing quite a bit
<br />about 'making out'
<br />from the older boys, and he wondered
<br />what it was
<br />and how it was done.
<br /><br />One day he took his question to his
<br />mother, who
<br />became rather flustered. Instead of
<br />explaining
<br />things to Ramy, she told him to hide
<br />behind the
<br />curtains one night and watch his older
<br />sister and
<br />her boyfriend.
<br /><br />This he did. The following morning,
<br />RAMY
<br />described EVERYTHING to his mother.
<br /><br />&quot;Sis and her boyfriend sat and talked for
<br />a while,
<br />then he turned off most of the lights.
<br />Then he
<br />started kissing and hugging her. I
<br />figured 'Sis must
<br />be getting sick, because her face started
<br />looking
<br />funny.
<br /><br />He must have thought so too, because he
<br />put his
<br />hand inside her blouse to feel her heart,
<br />just the
<br />way the doctor would. Except he's not as
<br />smart as
<br />the doctor because he seemed to have
<br />trouble
<br />finding her heart. I guess he was getting
<br />sick too,
<br />because pretty soon both of them started
<br />panting
<br />and getting all out of breath.
<br /><br />His other hand must have been cold
<br />because he
<br />put it under her skirt.
<br /><br />About this time 'Sis got worse and began
<br />to moan
<br />and sigh and squirm around and slide
<br />down
<br />toward
<br />the end of the couch. This was when her
<br />fever
<br />started. I knew it was a fever, because Sis
<br />told him
<br />she felt really hot.
<br /><br />Finally, I found out what was making
<br />them so
<br />sick......-a big eel ;had gotten inside his
<br />pants
<br />somehow. It just jumped out of his pants
<br />and
<br />stood there, about 10 inches long,
<br />honest, anyway
<br />he grabbed it in one hand to keep it from
<br />getting
<br />away.
<br /><br />When Sis saw it, she got really scared-her
<br />eyes
<br />got big, and her mouth fell open, and
<br />she started
<br />calling out to God and stuff like that. She
<br />said it
<br />was the biggest one she's ever seen; I
<br />should tell
<br />her about the ones down at the lake by
<br />our house!
<br /><br />Anyway, Sis got brave and tried to kill the
<br />eel by
<br />biting its head off. All of a sudden she
<br />grabbed it
<br />with both hands and held it tight while he
<br />took a
<br />muzzle out of his pocket and slipped it
<br />over the
<br />eel's head to keep it from biting again.
<br /><br />Sis lay back and spread her legs so she
<br />could get
<br />a scissor-lock on it and he helped by lying
<br />on top
<br />of the eel. The eel put up a hell of a
<br />fight.
<br /><br />Sis started groaning and squealing and
<br />her
<br />boyfriend almost upset the couch. I guess
<br />they
<br />wanted to kill the eel by squashing it
<br />between
<br />them.
<br /><br />After a while they both quit moving and
<br />gave a
<br />great sigh. Her boyfriend got up, and sure
<br />enough,
<br />they killed the eel. I knew because it just
<br />hung
<br />there, limp, and some of its insides were
<br />hanging
<br />out.
<br /><br />Sis and her boyfriend were a little tired
<br />from the
<br />battle, but they went back to courting
<br />anyway. He
<br />started hugging and kissing her again. By
<br />golly,
<br />the eel wasn't dead! It jumped straight up
<br />and
<br />started to fight again.
<br /><br />I guess eels are like cats- they have nine
<br />lives or
<br />something. This time, Sis jumped up and
<br />tried to
<br />kill it by sitting on it. After about a 35
<br />minute
<br />struggle, they finally killed the eel. I knew
<br />it was
<br />dead, because I saw Sis's boyfriend peel
<br />its skin
<br />off and flush it down the toilet.
<br /><br />Now that you've read it, post it and u will
<br />have goodluck
<br />in &quot;gettin' sum&quot; forever...Ignore it, and U
<br />will
<br />have a

<br />It comes so soft, that it barely has a feeling.
<br />When it comes, your heart is at ease.
<br />And the only thing that is on your mind, is
<br />Now the agony can finally.
<br />Leave
<br /><br />As you gaze into the emptiness that fills the air.
<br />A Droplet tends to fall.
<br />While your memory races back to the time
<br />When you thought you had it all.
<br /><br />You try to hold in what is deeply within your soul.
<br />But the burning is so intense; that you just
<br />Can't help but to let it go.
<br /><br />During the night a stain is made.
<br />And at the same time all your pain is able to fade.
<br />The only true feeling that you feel, is the wetness of
<br />A drop that is left by a single tear.

<br />Night after Night,
<br /><br />The world moves as I stay still.
<br />Staring at my plain dark bedroom wall.
<br /><br />Mother knocks on my door, but I feel too numb to answer
<br />She cries, but I motionlessly don't answer.
<br /><br />I lie on my bed,
<br />Screaming in my head.
<br /><br />Pain forever with me never leaving.
<br />It goes with me everywhere.
<br /><br />Like my shadow,
<br />Constantly there.
<br /><br />Now my sister turning into darkness.
<br />She will before long be just like her brother.
<br /><br />And mother will soon give in.
<br />The echo of glass breaking,
<br /><br />The sound of my mother screaming,
<br />And me still emotionless as I lay.
<br /><br />The doors are slamming.
<br />More glasses breaking.
<br /><br />And me just falling,
<br />With no delay.
<br /><br />Now the house grows dark.
<br />Only the noise of the wind and the crickets grows.
<br /><br />And for me I have now been swallowed by the darkness.
<br />And all my fears have come true.

<br />in the delusion of my mind.
<br />I had a million eyes to give,
<br />but people still were blind.
<br />Things never would have gone so bad
<br />if it hadn't been for you.
<br />You took my normal, happy life
<br />and tore it right in two.
<br />Every day a living hell.
<br />To go on was a curse.
<br />And love and joy and happiness
<br />they only make it worse.
<br />I never saw my life.
<br />I watched it slowly fade away.
<br />But I saw the darkness
<br />as it came in for its stay.
<br />The darkness was you
<br />and the shadow you cast.
<br />Fear filled my soul
<br />now I'll never last.
<br />In the darkness of my mind
<br />hide the secrets of hell.
<br />And every other horrible thing
<br />where only demons dwell.
<br />But I also hide the secret
<br />of all the pain you caused.
<br />I didn't want the world to know
<br />who or what I was.
<br />You can't be saved.
<br />Your destiny's chosen
<br />Your path has been paved.
<br />No potions to save you
<br />nor magical spells.
<br />And I smile, and whisper
<br />I'll see you in hell.

<br />At the rate things are going, I'll never be a wife.
<br />I am always feeling sad and blue,

<br />mad at what I'm not sure,

<br />Girl: &quot;Can we do what?&quot;
<br />Guy: &quot;You know, can I be your first, finally?&quot;

<br />Guy: &quot;So, if you don't tell, I won' tell.&quot;
<br />Girl: &quot;Besides that, I'm waiting for someone special. Someone that I want to be with for the rest of my life to be my first.&quot;
<br />Guy: &quot;I'm not special to you?&quot;
<br />Girl: &quot;You're my friend. That's all.&quot;
<br />Guy looks forward and keeps driving. 5 minutes pass....... Guy starts to run his hand up the girl's thigh.
<br />Girl: moves his hand, &quot;Don't touch me!&quot;
<br />Guy: tries to kiss her.
<br />Girl: screams, &quot;Would you stop.&quot;
<br />Guy: continues trying.
<br />Girl: moves to the back seat
<br />Guy: parks on an abandoned street and gets in the backseat with the girl
<br />Starts to kiss her..
<br />Girl: pushes him off and scoots over, &quot;Please, don't do this.&quot;
<br />Guy: &quot;Don't do what, I know you want it, I can see it in your eyes.&quot;
<br />Moves over to her and starts to unbutton her pants.

<br />Girl: looks at him and says, &quot;Why?&quot; dreading the answer that she was sure to receive.
<br />Doctor: &quot;You are pregnant.&quot;
<br />Girl: faints.
<br /><br />The story gets out that she is pregnant, and people start looking to the guy. He claims that it isn't his because she was sleeping with every guy in the school(which was a lie). He goes to her and tells her, &quot;I'm telling you, if you lie to people and say that I raped you, I'll kill you.&quot;
<br /><br />The Girl is completely devastated. First, he took her virginity and got her pregnant....then he lied about it. So completely depressed......the girl commits suicide by drug overdose.......

<br /><br />Girl:Hey babe, I'll be right back. I need to take this call.
<br /><br />Boy: Yeah okay. Sure.
<br /><br />She walks into the next room.
<br /><br />Girl: Hey! What's up?
<br /><br />Guy [on her cellphone]: Nothing, hey hun, do you think we could go do something later tonight? What are the chances my boss let me get out early.
<br /><br />Girl: Yeah, sounds great!
<br /><br />Guy [on her cellphone]: Okay. I'm right by your house, I'll come to get you now.
<br /><br />Girl: That's not such a good idea...
<br /><br />Guy [on her cellphone]: Why not?
<br /><br />Girl: I'm busy right now... sorry.
<br /><br />Guy [on her cellphone]: With what? It's our anniversary! You didn't make any other plans did you...?
<br /><br />In her head she yells, SHIT! Throws clothes back on quickly.
<br />Girl: No No... I was just eating... with the family.
<br /><br />Guy [on her cellphone]: But I thought you said your family was away this weekend, up at your resort?
<br /><br />The guy walks into her house, turns the corner into the hallway. Goes downstairs, and finds his bestfriend on her couch, half un-dressed, trying to pull his pants back on and his girlfriend pulling her shirt over her head.
<br /><br />Guy: What the hell is going on?!
<br /><br />Girl: I can explain! Please listen to me!
<br /><br />Guy: Benny? How could you do this to me! Rachel! I thought you loved me! And yet, your sleeping with MY BEST FRIEND!!!!
<br /><br />Girl: John...!
<br /><br />John with tears in his eyes, he rushes out of room, and slams the door.
<br /><br />Benny climbs out of the window, starts his car, and drives off down the street.
<br /><br />Girl runs after her boyfriend. Yelling...
<br /><br />Girl: NOOOO! Please!! Come back John!! Pleeeeeasssse????!! She falls down and cries.
<br /><br />John turns around, looks straight at his girlfriend in tears.
<br /><br />John: Why? Rachel, why? I loved you! Oh my God, I'm in love with a whore. Does this mean I have to pay you now?!
<br />Here take this as the cash. He drops a ring box on her lap.
<br /><br />She opens the ring box. Her jaw drops... Before her eyes is a diamond wedding ring.
<br /><br />Girl: You were going to propose?
<br /><br />Guy: Yeah... how dumb was I? And as he slowly walked back to his car, his headlights faded... And she was in despair.
<br /><br />Later that night, the girl got a phone call from the police saying he just jumped off the bridge and killed himself.
<br /><br />If you love/like someone, and you want them in your life forever. Repost in 380 seconds as &quot;cheating hurts.&quot; Or your true love will walk away
