I guess they aren't that bad... I mean, sure! They smell really bad, but they are really fun to be around.
<br /><br />On a side note! I'm soo over some guy that I was kind of into... Not kind of. Like, waay into. Finally! And it's all because of a dream... How sad is that.

		<document id="dcf79086aa3a77e0fa0a09e7e26f92cf" url=""><![CDATA[Ohmycock.<br/><br/>Holy shit, holy shit. I broke my toe today! What a great time to do so too. Not only do I have to run every morning, because it's beautiful out... I also have my sixteenth to do. I believe the term, &quot;Eff-Em-Elle&quot; comes to mind. I guess it's not that bad though. I mean, I could have broken something else... Or caught a deadly virus.
<br /><br />On the plus side! I am starting a diary kind of story. It's based on the famous killer Countess Elizabeth Báthory. Probably the most prolific female serial killer in history, the Hungarian countess, also sometimes called the “Blood countess,” killed around 650 young girls. Over 300 witness accounts were collected during her trial. She killed these girls by torturing them in various ways, including burning, beating, mutilations, freezing, unnecessary surgery, starving her victims, and sometimes sexually abusing them. The fictional character Count Dracula is said to be partially based on her. Which is pretty bad ass. But man! Is the first diary entry twisted. I can't wait to finish it!

My step-mother just happens to be mad twenty-four seven... So that means that I get all the heat. Just because her daughter is an idiot, I have to get yelled at for the most trivial things. BUT! I have written the first entry for my story. I'll give you a sneaker.
<br /><br /><span class="textAlign textAlignCenter"><strong>Day One-</strong></span>
<br /><br />I can feel it. I feel it every time I watch a horror film. I feel it every time a small child cries out in pain. But... I don't know where it comes from. I wonder to myself when I'm alone. It just comes out of, what seems like, nowhere. I have been to about ten different physiologists now, and and they all say the same thing... I'm fine. I'm normal. I don't believe them because I can feel it now, more than ever. It is an insane desire that I have to fight to control. My newest therapist asked me to write in a “diary” everyday in order to get rid of the feeling. I know that he just wants to monitor me, to see if my parents are even taking care of me. They don't know what I feel, they just know about the drawings. The drawings that basically scream the desire.
<br /><br />I am proud of this. (:

It was really fun, and then I realized that while I was in the pool with my friends, we forgot to sing the Finding Nemo song that Dory sings. So, I just reminded my friend and we both were sad. But, we had a great night. Very tiring, but soo worth it. Except for the couple having sex in the pool! Oh my god, that was gross. Legit, they were just canoodling and there was pubic hair in the pool! Ugh...
<br /><br />But today, is just a vegging kind of day. As I'm writing, I'm watching All Dogs Go To Heaven because nothing else is on and I'm feeling cartoons. But, since the day is still happening I have nothing else to write besides the fact that I'mma marry Tim Urban from American Idol. Well, I used to have the biggest crush on somebody, but he's kind of a dick now. Well, not a legit dick. He just doesn't attract me anymore.

Because it's the day of birth and all, but it means that I'm getting on in my years. Damn it all... I hate being old. And I'm not even that old... I guess I'm just being a sourpuss about it. Oh well, I don't care.
<br /><br />On a side note, my nose stud fell out on Saturday! I'm not sure if I've stated this yet or not, but it makes me sad inside. I miss it, but on a more positive note... I'm getting my dermal this weekend! I'm soo excited for it, you have no idea.

I mean, it's been forever and a half. I really missed him and his awesome ways. I mean, sure... He's totally different than I am, but he's my friend. One of the best ever.

		<document id="8bcf47de76fe625b349ad4e7a7810817" url=""><![CDATA[Love.<br/><br/>You know, love sucks sometimes. Actually, most of the time. People generally overreact and then a great big futz happens. Like, seriously... Is it needed to be that overreacted all the time? But, whatever... Love is generally a great big pain Sometimes, it's as if the world is perfect. But, only in the first stages of it. Otherwise, it's just a giant zit ready to explode. I'm sure that some people's views on love is that it is the most pure feeling in the world. Good for them, they've found what others cannot obtain. I know, I know... It's a little down of me to think like that, but I've seriously had enough of it.
<br /><br />What I want is a simple relationship without any hidden meanings. If it turns into &quot;love&quot; after a long, long time then so be it. But, really. The most anybody ever feels is intense lust for the other person. And I know, I'm talking as if I've been an old woman for the better years of my life... But, I've been through the heartache. Yes, yes... That sounds very hypocritical of me, but I know for a fact that it wasn't actual &quot;love&quot; I was feeling. You know how people want what they can't have? Well, I guess that's how I was feeling... I don't know. The point is that I really have had enough.

Although, it stings at the moment it's totally worth it. AND! On a bonus the guy I have been waiting for to text me finally did. Like... Holy shit, man. Only took how long? Whatever, whatever. I really can't have a bad mood because of my dermal anchor! Yuss! Yee, yee son! Ballin'! AND! He wants to see it tomorrow. I'm soo excited and happy. Not only did I finally get it done, but he finally contacted me first! My, what a perfect day. A. Perfect. Day. Nothing could bring me down.

It's as if my body knows that it is made for me. My god, I do love this thing more than I loved my nose stud. Mostly because I didn't cry after I got it, and it doesn't hurt when things move. Goodness me... AND! Today, I get to show it off to all of those who said I wouldn't do it. Take that, twats! Peace out, hateeeers! ;D

I kind of had a huge crush on him, and his band is playing tomorrow. I kind of want to go and be like, &quot;Oh hey! I didn't know you were here.&quot; But that seems really lame now that I think about it... I think instead I'll just go with a bunch of friends and be that awesome. I already got somebody in on it, so I won't be alone at least. I think I have two now, so this is good! I can be there, and cheer people on and everything! Wow... How lame am I?

I mean, who gives a shit about having a positive environment, when you can have a negative one? I know I don't. Seriously, why doesn't she just leave if she's so upset about everything. And it was over something as stupid as that! C'mon! Really? Well, whatever... That's why I get out of the house, and keep to myself. Because, she yells at everything I do. Whatever, do what you will... I won't let you get me down.

		<document id="e8a1cd6c42cf4cb9288dfdc5adfb1c00" url=""><![CDATA[Devastation of the worst kind.<br/><br/>Like the title said, this is one of those blogs where I just happen to be writing it while I am devastated. No, I am not sad nor heartbroken. I way beyond those kind of weak words. It's such an idiot reason too... But, I can't help it. I'm sure it was innocent, but it hurts a lot. My heart hurts, I don't want to eat, I'm on the verge of tears, and I've given up. You want to know what the sad part is? The reason why I give up is because my best friend is waay prettier and waay more fun. She says she hates somebody, she cuddles with him. She ditches me in an Opera House by myself so she can talk to the guy I am, or was, deeply infatuated with. I left because I was tired of being alone and I wait outside. She walks out with <strong>his</strong> hat on. The hat that he said nobody could steal! Plus, my other best friend got dumped... Like, fcuk! Seriously.
<br /><br />Why can't I just be happy for once? The week was going so well, so fcuking well! And all because she decided to get dressed up for something in the dark, I basically go over the edge. This always happens. Well, I'm done competing. I'm done trying. I give up on everything that I ever wanted. She can have any guy she wants, I really don't care anymore. It's pointless to try and keep the guy's attention when she walks in. I'll just stay in the wings of the stage and watch as the performance goes on. I can't handle this again. My heart hurts, I just want to creep into a hole and die. Even then! Everything that seemed so minuscule will just enlarge and engulf me until there is nothing left.
<br /><br />But, I have a really good friend who gives awesome advice. Actually, she got it from a poem kind of thing. She allowed me to vent, and it's waaay stupid... But she said, <strong>You take a break on him for a bit, and maybe he'll come to you. That's how you'll know whether its worth it or not.</strong> It really did help, because she knows what she's talking about... I really hate talking about it, but it's best to just let it all out. It's good to vent, even if nobody hears it.

No seriously, she actually made me feel empty... Until I didn't because of today. That one moment today when everything just felt right. This is short, sorry!

		<document id="7db2092bc9e9a3a3e5a8fb2094a7acbe" url=""><![CDATA[There goes my baby, she knows how to rock 'n' roll.<br/><br/>So, I kind of have Crazy Little Thing Called Love stuck in my head, hence the title. I mean, I sing it really well... So, I'm sure nobody really cares about that part. But I really can't stand having it in my head for the past day now. I mean, really. Enough is enough. Let's just pretend that it's not there and sing something else! Tomorrow I get to practice Hey There Delilah with my friend, and I'm scared she'll butcher it.
<br /><br />Oh! Speaking of friends! My best friend and I had a huge misunderstanding... Well, I hope it was. She's gone after some other guy now, so it's all behind us. Which is good... Right? I hope so. But right now, I have the biggest headache and stomach ache of the century. So, I'm going to go have a nap.

Do you realize how sad that is? Well, I guess we all can't have an exciting life... So, basically I'm pretty sure that I'm bipolar. Yeah, pretty sure. That! And I have A.D.D. I swear. I like to rotate topics when I speak, and people get confused when I jump from one back to another and so on. Sure, it's probably not the case... But I say it is.
<br /><br />Today, I want to go to a friend's house. I'm thinking the friend that I cried over last week, so I should call her a a more reasonable time. Speaking of reasonable times! I can't sleep in on Saturday's. I've tried, but I always wake up at like, seven in the morning. It's starting to piss me off, but I won't let that affect my Sunday time. By the way, it's all rainy outside and I really want to jump into some puddles.

I have nothing to rant about, nothing to get off my chest... It's just nothing. Which sucks, because I really love to rant and rave. Sarcasm! I did buy some short shorts though, and they look good. But, it's freezing so I'm not pleased with them at the moment.

Not only is it depressing, but it just makes me feel as if nobody wants to be around me. In fact, all this week feels that way. I don't know... Maybe it's just me. But I really wish this feeling would pass. Like, seriously.

For example, I haven't been doing anything but drinking tea... I don't know, I guess ever since a certain time of  this week it's as if somebody turned off a switch to my attitude. I mean, I've been doing my school work. I just don't want to try with anything anymore. Gosh, I guess I need something to get me going.

Everything that makes up my person is gone, and I don't know what to do. I can't even finish a short blog post before quitting for a while. I really don't understand... But, I'll put on a brave front and pretend everything is alright. I cn't do this anymore, I need a break.

		<document id="e5c686e0e62e323f368fef8bfafff654" url=""><![CDATA[Blog!<br/><br/>Lookie, lookie!
<br />I wrote a short thinger, and it scares me. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />“What are you doing?” The image reflected in the mirror stared right back. Those endlessly blue orbs concentrated deeply on the pair outside of the image. The rising and falling of the broad chest reminded the male of what he had done, what he was going to do. Looking down at his hands, he could feel a shudder of emotion well up from his core. Glancing back up at the speculum in order to take in his milky complexion better, he began to really see himself.
<br /><br />His black tendrils of hair sat perfectly across his forehead, accenting the small flecks of red that had been dyed in a while back. His eyebrows were pushed together in a frown, which deepened his cobalt eyes to a dazzling sapphire. The high cheekbones underneath those orbs pushed upward when he relaxed his face to the usual expression he carried. His nose perched between the cheeks with a metallic object hanging between the nostrils. Underneath that object were a pair of pink lips. The bottom was thicker than the top, but stretched as he gave himself a toothless smile. The broad jaw was set in such a way that made him seem as if he knew what he was doing. He never did.
<br /><br />Trailing his gaze down to stare at his elongated neck, wide shoulders and capacious pectorals he found himself looking through all of this. Looking through the confident image of a sturdy, young male ready for the world. In fact, he looked directly past his inner self only to find what really lay beneath all of the glamor. What was really behind the mask that society wanted to see. What the male saw frightened him. Chilled him so much that he had to look away.
<br /><br />Shutting his eyes only to find himself staring at the image that made his heart ache, he snapped them open. Not meeting his own gaze, he stared behind him at a blank wall. Moving his gaze slowly to where his hands lay, the male took a deep breath of oxygen before holding a needle in front of his face. The coffee colored liquid flowed effortlessly inside of the transparent plastic tube, which made him watch it with an expression filled with wonder. Removing the cover for the tiny sliver of metal he took another breath. Maneuvering the needle without thought so his right hand could hold it properly, the male looked at himself once more in the mirror.
<br /><br />What he saw was a silent plea for him to stop. His beryl orbs held a terrified look that his face did not match. The expression on his face was a blank canvass ready for whatever lay ahead. Shutting his eyes as he positioned the needle, he took the plunge without a second thought. A sharp intake of breath came from his teeth as soon as the tip of the needle went through his skin. Chewing on his inner lip as he pushed the liquid into his bloodstream, the male opened his eyes to look down at his arm.
<br /><br />He had not prepared for this. A cloud of doubt flew across his face as he pulled out the sliver of metal and placed it carefully in the garbage. He was unsure what he had done. If he had even hit a vein. For one thing, he had not cut off the blood circulation to his forearm. Another was the fact that he had shut his eyes. Clenching his jaw tightly out of anger, he placed his head into his hands and shook. He shook out of anger, humiliation, fear.
<br /><br />Feeling a silent tear roll down his cheek and onto his leg, the male looked at himself once more. Pressing his lips together, he looked through himself. “What am I doing?”

Unfortunately for me, they keep coming back with more and more insults. If you don't like me, then don't waste your time on me. Simple as that. It's funny, some of them say, &quot;I love you&quot; some of them mean it and others...? Well, let's just say &quot;I love you&quot; to them is actually &quot;<strong>Show me your tits, or else I'll hate you forever</strong>&quot;. Those are the people I really enjoy. They get all upset over one little picture posted up on a public forum with nothing showing and they say, &quot;<strong>Oh! So you'll show off your</strong> [insert body part here] <strong>for all the creeps, but not me?</strong>&quot; Give it a rest! I don't fucking know you! You are a creep for even asking that. Well, that's all for my rant. (:
