Overlooking Olympia from outside is a kind of admiration, a desire and a guess. Overlooking from Olympia is a excitement like a dream and a tear-filled shock. In arena of Greek, the eyes of souls went through the time and space, the magnificent and resplendant of ancient Olympic Games 2000 years ago shows up vividly in front of the visitors at the time of the seethe with the excitment burning up when the torch is burning.10 News That Will Effect Decay to Your <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3BhbmRvcmF1ay5vcmc_" target="_blank">pandora uk</a>

Later, she lightened the holy torch in the hands of the athlete kneed down in front, which was the symbol of the beginning of the Olympic Games. The torch bearer stood up, truned around and ran to the tomb of Coubertin. This is the ceremony of Olympic flame collection every four years.

<br /><br />If it is not entirely surrounded with a rope, not placed the nameplate with photographs, I'm afraid many of us will miss one of the most holy places of Olympic Games. Apparently, it is built up by just a few small stones, only a few square meters wide, covered with green grass and white flowers, a totally piece of wasteland. Actually, it embraced the great beginning of Olympic Games. A few non-tall stones prostrate above the earth flatly, let the erosion of wind and rain and recount the long and drought-stricken vicissitudes past of Olympia silently.
<br /><br />The passionate and active life of the parthenon disappeared in history, but it was changed into other forms and continued. The deity-Hera might have not thought, after 2000 years, the two ancient civilizations which the most brilliant and have the longest history together by her side, however, they are passed on by the torchbearers one after another, towards the rising sun. &quot;If you want to be wise, run! If you want to be strong, run! If you want to be healthy, run!&quot; This is the fairly famous adage engraved on the cliff wall near the Eerfeisi river in Olympia, and it is also the most ancient and sacred motto in physical culture.
<br /><br />Although the glory of Olympia arena has waned, people can till see it somewhat and somewhere. The Olympia arena has the racing course with the capacity of 40 horses to race in, the Stadium with the perfect open-air straightaway, along with the training fields and palestra used for the training of athletes. Outside the gym, the echo wall is still standing there which can make the sound of order maker and bugler resound for seven times.
<br /><br />It is said that the Greece LOCOG planned to make here a compitation area for discus and javelin, but failed owing to lack of length. When in the absence of large-scale tours, the stadium is more of a venue than of a t lonely barren wilderness with slight embellishments. With the change of seasons, numerous miracles dissolved in the river of history, but there are always new ones erect on the remains, arising infinite praise of the future generation.

A Girl Isn't Able to Speak Her Mother Languag<br/><br/>In Croatia, a strange thing happened recently: a 13-year-old girl suddenly can not speak the language Croatian after waking up from a coma, can only talk to people in German. According to the girl's parents, their daughter had just started to learn German, and it was more strenuous for her to read German books, to watch German television programs to put it fluently before her coma. But when she came to herself, she had totally forgotten her mother tongue Croatian. She even refused to use this language and changed to use German to communicate with people fluently.Requisite Tricks that Deserve to Learn for Maintaining Your <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL215ZmFzaGlvbmpld2VsLmNvbQ__" target="_blank">wedding jewelry</a>

Fashion Trend in the Fall: <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3dlZGRpbmdkcmVzczRsb3ZlLmNvbQ__" target="_blank">weddings dress</a>  International definition of the mother tongue: mother tongue is the languages that people initially contact, learn and master. Mother language is usually touched and then used lastly to the youth or later; And in the family or normal education especially in the primary periods, most of them are transmitted by mother language. Human growth keeps pace with the development of mother tongue, and the impact of our mother tongue is deep-rooted and it is difficult for us to forget our mother languages.
<br /><br />It is learned that the girl is only in a coma for 24 hours, still can not determine the cause of this coma, doctors said it could be due to high fever. Now, the girl is in the hospital, and his family goes to see her every day. But what makes them embarrassed is that the girl could not understand the parents, the hospital has to arrange for an interpreter to help the girl to communicate with her family and doctors, and even her physician doctor is a doctor of German background arranged by the hospital. Abruptly forgetting the mother tongue has always been a baffling problem in the medical circle. The psychiatric expert, one of her attending doctors, Dr Mijo Milas was also shocked by it.
<br /><br />&quot;There was also an example at past that a seriously sicked or comatose patients woke up and suddenly spoken another language. In some case, the patient suddenly began to spoken the language which was used during the ancient Babylon and Egypt. In the earlier times, it could be referred to as a miracle by us. But now we believe that there should be a logical explanation which we have not found yet.&quot; British media said that there was such a case reported in the country. A British girl who has waked up from a car accident suddenly began to speak the Portuguese dialect in 17th century and forgot her own identity. And she insisted she was living in Portugal at 300 years ago. She also provide the name and address. After investigation, the police found that the every word the girl said was true, the name and the address could be matched. The medical community still hasn't worked out a convincing answer to such weird incidents so far, while civilian society has always owned these incidents to some supernatural power.

I don't know how the future will the film be in the condition of the director's present state, there is nothing worse than the negative publicity.&quot; He added. The 76-year-old Polanski was arrested in Zurich last month. The director of Chinatown has been sued several charges for having sex with a 13-year-old girl in 1977. He escaped to America in 1978. From then on, he spend most of the day in France.

<br /><br />Gunman is Polanski's new movie,whose leading actors are Pierce Brosnan and Ewan McGregor. The political thriller tells a story between British ex-Prime Minister and a shooter.

He is now dispatching orders in jail and giving instructions to the incidental music of the film. &quot;It will be a nightmare if he is still kept in the prison when the film hit the big screen.

If your wedding ceremony is relatively traditional, you`d better select a classical and large wedding dress.10 Reasons for You to Shop <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL215ZmFzaGlvbmpld2VsLmNvbQ__" target="_blank">wedding jewelry</a>  
<br /><br />Second, make enough preparation and collect some of the grande toilette pictures you like. Make marks on them about the style and plate of your grande toilette especially details such as the collar and waist. When you alternate with your dress consultant or designer, remember to bring your pictures, which can help you express your thoughts and opinions more clearly.
<br /><br />3.Have a good budget. The money you spend on dress and other accessories is considered suitable if it takes no more than 15% of the total cost of the wedding expenses. If the budget allows, you can customize a dress you feel most satisfied.
<br /><br />4. Select the location, there are so many wedding dress shops and photo studios. Where can you find the dream dress? In general, large professional wedding dress shop is complete about the style of dress, rich in designer's experience, and reliable production quality. You can also seek advice from your friends of colleagues who has had a wedding ceremony lately and pick 2 to 3 places from their recommendation.

<br /><br />8. The size should be appropriate. If your dress is not customized, you should focus on the dress` size. To be specific, the wedding dress` size should match the size of your parts that are most plump (like chest, waist, and huckle, etc.). Then see whether other parts are good. You may keep in mind that choose the clothes which are little bit large since you can change the large one into small one while it is impossible to change the little one into large one.
<br /><br />Ninth is listening to expert`s ideas. Since the designers have much experience, you would better listen to their opinions if you want to have the most suitable grande toilette.

Orang-utan means &quot;jungle people&quot; in Malay. These wisdom and shy orangered creatures are the biggest mammals on the tree in the world. They pick fruits in the forest in daytime, and build lair by branches and leaves at night. Once, appearance of orang-utans cover the Southeast Asia. However, the crazy destruction to forest by human brings out that the amount of orang-utan decreased from 315 thousands at the beginning of 20 century to 27 thousands in 1997.&lt;/P&gt;
<br />&lt;P&gt;Now, in order to make way for plantation, a large number of deforestation caused sharp decline of the number of orangutan. The latest survey shows that there are only 45,000 to 69,000 orangutans left in Borneo. There are only 70 thousands orang-utans in Sumatra. UNEP divides Borneo orang-utans as the endangered species, which means that they are facing the highest rate of the endangered. And orang-utans in Sumatra have been critially endangered. Now, what is the living status of the red apes? After Their survival jungle forests have been replaced by the oil palm plantations, they have nowhere to find food so that they have to eat oil palm seedlings. However, even such miserable as they were, these hungry orangutans were regarded by business owners as [pests&quot; which damage the interests of oil palm in the plantations, so they were killed by hired workers.&lt;/P&gt;
<br />&lt;P&gt;In accordance with data from Orang-utans Protection Centre, only in 2006, 1,500 orang-utans were killed by workers intentionally, and died miserably by losing living homeland. In 2008, when the distribution map of orangutans in Isle Gary was compared with the forest farm map of Indonesia's Sinar Mas Group, our investigators found that the Indonesia's Sinar Mas Group's forestry not only overlapped with orangutans habitat, And the deforestation by APP has already destroyed the habitation. There are at least 3 tree farms of APP 4 tree farms covering the habitation of orang-utans. The forest area are planted with oil-palms. The orangutan habitat around the Bukit Tigapuluh Angeles National Forest is the only place that reintroduce orangutan successfully.&lt;/P&gt;
<br />&lt;P&gt;Most of the time, these orangutans live in the forest near to the national park. However, this piece of the region is in the sight of Sinar Mas Group at any time. Destroying forest has ruined the homelands for orang-utans and many precious species and advances these endangered species to be extinct. The original dwellers who live in the rain forest from generation to generation have to uproot their homelands homelessly. Indonisia is the the country with furthest speed of forests dispearance in the world, and where tropical rainforests have been recored in the Guilnness World Lists with reducing speed of 20% every year. These orang-utans and rainforests need a &quot;breathing&quot; opportunity. Only if enough people can not tolerate their negative reaction to deforestation, more positive actions will be promoted on forest conservation.&lt;/P&gt;

		<document id="8572ac49e4ada666048de09e1eca1355" url=""><![CDATA[Microblog Promotes the Worth of Social Networking Services<br/><br/>&lt;P&gt;SNS, full name social networking service, specifically refers to the internet applicable service designed to help people build social networks. How I Use Evernote to Organize Everything (25) It also refers to popular and mature information carriers existed, such as SMS messaging service. Another common explanation of SNS: Social Network Site, ie the &quot;social Web&quot; or &quot;social net.&quot;The Reasons Why Drew Barrymore Want &lt;A title=&quot;diesel clothing&quot; href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fdieselclothinguk.com%26quot%3B%26gt%3Bdiesel"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://dieselclothinguk.com&quot;&gt;diesel</a> clothing&lt;/A&gt; &lt;/P&gt;
<br />&lt;P&gt;When ordinary people can have computing and communications resources which may compare to the web server by installing the SNS software, what will those Internet companies investing in a large number of servers do? What are their advantages? Will there be more new Internet companies, whose front end and background might not be present Google, EBAY or Sina model? Even the 3 million strong server clusters of which the operator like Shanda games is proud is the core competitiveness? When the machine in a cartoon's home can play his work through the SNS video device, does he need to go to manage a website? Probably a housewife does not know Html programming, doed not know the word site, but she can only use the SNS cookbook publishing program and a PC in the kitchen to help millions of people master her craft, and her stances on the stove is quite clear. What are you thinking at that time? In today's Internet now, we as the clients are like a dummy, do some slavery things only through the server, look at other people's sites, play other people's games, send emails, in addition to these, we have no freedom.&lt;/P&gt;
<br />&lt;P&gt;Now is the time to start a revolution! Central task of the revolution: how to let more than 10 million computers play their own roles, let users create and control their own information, without the company's servers manipulating us. Individual power is weak, the birth of the Internet makes syntaxis of individuals' and strange forces in a short time possible, while SNS makes the possibility become a reality. The ultimate significance of SNS is to integrate the scattered individuals in the Internet orderly and organicly, just like the silk thread strung pearls. The key is to make the pearls find the pearls and the fish balls find the fish balls. If an SNS always let the fishball fall into the pearl base, or vice versa, it is definitely a disaster.&lt;/P&gt;
<br />&lt;P&gt;To let the same type of individuals associate perfectly is the core application of SNS. Now almost all of the SNS take the webgame as the core applications for getting users together, which is obviously a departure from the basic value of SNS. SNS takes human relations as a basis. The user inevitably have the behaviour characteristics of participation, communication and sharing. This kind of behaviour spends a lot of time. Therefore, the core applications of SNS should invovle two basic characteristics of simple operation and high frequency property of participation. Internet application which now can meet the two characteristics is only the microblog.&lt;/P&gt;
<br />&lt;P&gt;Living the life from the days into the scripts is the inevitable result of the information age and the rapid urbanization, which is also the reason why microblog is highly regarded. Significance of microblog for the individual is not confiding but listening. Individuals will be more concerned about the content published by the objects followed, and associate by responses. This series of acts like release, attention, following, recovery, re-release form a virtuous communication cycle. Each man and followed object form a small circle, a number of which link together to form a SNS Network. Microblog makes SNS more valuable. Microblog can not be said to be the only core application of SNS, but the success of microblog definitely can promote the success of SNS, which is of course only the success on applications. From the time used, the mobile terminal has more potential than a computer to become the main platform of SNS. The successful commercial application must tie the other twin brother SMS. Microblog and text message are born to make a pair. Break down the boundaries between the two means not only to create a new network application, but to create a new business model. The key is how to merge the interests of the enterprise, microblog and the user into a harmonious business system.&lt;/P&gt;

At the beginning of the banquet,an old woman came to the entrance of the manor together with a girl who had a jar that looked delicate in her hand.&lt;A title=&quot;air conditioners&quot; href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fhvacairconditioners.net%26quot%3B%26gt%3Bair"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://hvacairconditioners.net&quot;&gt;air</a> conditioners&lt;/A&gt; are the First in the List of Most Wanted Most-Wanted Pieces in 2009&lt;/P&gt;
<br />&lt;P&gt;Anthony, a security guard staying at the entrance of the manor, stood barring their way. He said, &quot;Welcome both of you! Please show your invitation card, thank you!&quot; &quot;Invitation card? Sorry, we didn't receive the invitation. She wants to come, and I accompany her&quot;, the old woman said to Anthony, stroking the head of the little girl. &quot;I am sorry, but except staff, no one can go in without invitation.&quot; Anthony said.&quot;Why? Isn't this a charity dinner? We come to express our mind, can't we?&quot;Give Your Attention to 10 the Most Popular &lt;A title=&quot;diesel jeans&quot; href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fmydieseljeans.co.uk%26quot%3B%26gt%3Bdiesel"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://mydieseljeans.co.uk&quot;&gt;diesel</a> jeans&lt;/A&gt; as Gifts for Girlfriend This Year&lt;/P&gt;
<br />&lt;P&gt;&quot;My dear Lucy knew from TV about the event, to donate to the children in Africa. And she wants to do something for these kids, so she decided to give all her money in her cash box.&quot;said the old woman with a solemn expression. Anthony explained: yes, there be a charity dinner here. People invited were all important persons and they will help the Afican children with money generously. Anthony paused for a moment and said, &quot;very happy to see you that you come here with kindness, but I think this occasion is not suitable for you.&quot; &quot;But uncle, it's kindness that charity raises, instead of money, right?&quot; Lucy who had been silent asked Anthony, which stunned him.&quot;I know people who have been invited own a lot of money, and they will take out a lot of money, I do not have that much, but this is all the money I have, if I really can not enter, please help me to take this in!&quot; Afer said that, the little girl hand the money pot to Anthony.&lt;/P&gt;
<br />&lt;P&gt;Anthony did not know whether he should took this or not. When he was confused, suddenly someone said:&quot;Yes, child, you are right. Charity is not money. It is the heart. You can go inside, and all who caring people can go in.&quot; The speaker was an old man. He was smiling, standing beside the little Lucy. Then he stooped to say a few words to little Lucy. Then he straightened up and took out an invitation to Antony: [Can I bring her in?&quot; Anthony took over the invitation, opened it and hastily gave the old man a respect ceremony: &quot;Yes, of course, Mr. Buffett.&quot;&lt;/P&gt;
<br />&lt;P&gt;The main character in today`s charity evening banquet is not the proponent Annan, not Buffet who contributed 3000000 dollars, not Bill Gates who donated 8000000, but the little Lucy who donated only 30 dollar and 25 pence. And the slogan of the dinner becomes such a sentence:&quot; Charity is not money but the heart.&quot; The second day, major U.S. medias used this sentence as their titles to report this charity dinner. After seeing the reports, many ordinary Americans said that they would donate to those poor children in Africa.&lt;/P&gt;
