Some large supermarket chains in Bangkok, the edible oil imports on the shelves in addition to olive oil, the local people rare sight of palm oil used cooking oil, rapeseed oil, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jaHJpc3RpYW5sb3Vib3V0aW4tc2FsZXMuY29tLw__" target="_blank">Christian Louboutin Sale</a>,soybean oil has been largely out of stock. On the black market, the price of 1 liter of palm oil has risen more than 70 baht (1 U.S. dollar equals 30 baht), up nearly a month ago, more than doubled. 
<br /><br />Thailand is second only to Indonesia and Malaysia, the world's third largest producer of palm oil, palm oil shortage why it? Late last year, the event in Thailand floods, palm oil production decline, but this time the international market, palm oil prices. The Thai government announced that the official price per liter of palm oil to 38 baht from the original to increase to 47 baht. To price increases not only failed to inhibit the social demand, but increasing oil shortage on the market: on the one hand, merchants said the baht rise 9 international market prices did not keep pace; the other hand,<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jaHJpc3RpYW5sb3Vib3V0aW4tc2FsZXMuY29tL2NocmlzdGlhbi1sb3Vib3V0aW4tc2FuZGFsLWMtMi5odG1s" target="_blank">Christian Louboutin Sandals</a>, one for palm oil prices, prompting a large forced the government through the accumulation of oil price increases business. 
<br /><br />In addition, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jaHJpc3RpYW5sb3Vib3V0aW4tc2FsZXMuY29tL2NocmlzdGlhbi1sb3Vib3V0aW4tc2FuZGFsLWMtMi5odG1s" target="_blank">Christian Louboutin Boots</a>,palm oil is bio-energy, thus creating a car with people competing for oil. International crude oil prices in recent years,<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jaHJpc3RpYW5sb3Vib3V0aW4tc2FsZXMuY29tL2NocmlzdGlhbi1sb3Vib3V0aW4tcHVtcHMtYy0zLmh0bWw_" target="_blank">christian louboutin pumps</a>, the Thai government attention to bio-energy. From June 1, 2010, the Thai began to force the use of palm oil mixed with 2% B3 biodiesel, currently plans to gradually transition to the use of 5% palm oil mixed with diesel. Experts estimate that over the three into a Thai palm oil has been used for bio-diesel. It stands to reason, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jaHJpc3RpYW5sb3Vib3V0aW4tc2FsZXMuY29tL2NocmlzdGlhbi1sb3Vib3V0aW4tZXZlbmluZy1jLTYuaHRtbA__" target="_blank">Christian Louboutin Evening</a>,Thailand, the shortage of palm oil imports from the international market can be adjusted. But when the Thai government has decided to urgently import palm oil, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jaHJpc3RpYW5sb3Vib3V0aW4tc2FsZXMuY29tLw__" target="_blank">Christian Louboutin Online</a>,the other palm oil producing countries have to ensure that domestic demand in Indonesia, so that palm oil export tariffs soaring with the price increase. More importantly, due to import a longer period, the Thai market on the palm oil supply situation is yet to be fundamentally alleviated. 
<br /><br />Some experts have likened to a shallow grain market chassis, said plate is large, but shallow end of the supply a bit more to overflowing, they obviously feel a little less inadequate. This feature shows the vulnerability of the grain market. 
<br /><br />There are many examples of the same. Limit the export of wheat last year, gave Russia the international market has brought a shock effect. Again, due to higher overall price level in Thailand, Thai rice farmers planted recently asked the Government to guarantee the purchase price of rice by a 1 million baht per tonne to 1.4 million baht. Thailand is one of the world's major rice exporting countries, if the rice price increases, world grain market will be affected, while the dependence on imported rice in the Philippines and Indonesia, the country's food security will also be affected. 
<br /><br />Food security issues in the linkage effects between different countries is growing, the adjustment of a country's food policy in other countries often will affect the international market. Numerous examples show that the foundation of food security is to have a sound and stable food production and supply system.

This marks the Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Yunus and the conflict between the government led to Yunus's &quot;defeated&quot; a stop completely. 
<br /><br />Age question for the Government to Yunus, &quot;class&quot; 
<br /><br />Village Bank Chairman Viktor Hacker Muzha has been confirmed an order issued by the Government, said the never approved of Muhammad Yunus, 70 years old 60 years old to continue working after normal retirement age, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jaHJpc3RpYW5sb3Vib3V0aW4tc2FsZXMuY29tL2NocmlzdGlhbi1sb3Vib3V0aW4tc2FuZGFsLWMtMi5odG1s" target="_blank">Christian Louboutin Sandals</a>,so he was &quot;indefinitely&quot; as village banks general manager of &quot;illegal&quot; and demanded the &quot;immediate resignation.&quot; 
<br /><br />&quot;I think Yunus would be very smooth transfer of authority, his departure will not have any impact on the operation of banks.&quot; Huck said. 
<br /><br />Because the government owns 25% stake in Grameen Bank, so the post of chairman of the bank appointed by the government, and Huck, and Yunus has always been substandard. Huck day meeting of the Board formally read out the order,<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jaHJpc3RpYW5sb3Vib3V0aW4tc2FsZXMuY29tL2NocmlzdGlhbi1sb3Vib3V0aW4tc2FuZGFsLWMtMi5odG1s" target="_blank">Christian Louboutin Boots</a>, and Yunus was also present. 
<br /><br />80 years from the beginning of last century, Yunus's Grameen Bank started to poor small businesses to provide small loans to help them improve their lives. It made him known as the &quot;father of microcredit,&quot; and in 2006 won the Nobel Peace Prize. 
<br /><br />Were excluded from the conflict with the government 
<br /><br />The media pointed out that the reason for trouble Yunus, the real reason was his conflict with the government. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jaHJpc3RpYW5sb3Vib3V0aW4tc2FsZXMuY29tL2NocmlzdGlhbi1sb3Vib3V0aW4tcHVtcHMtYy0zLmh0bWw_" target="_blank">christian louboutin pumps</a>.
<br /><br />Yunus had proposed in 2007 to set up a political party, and frankly because that Party politics in Bangladesh has come to the right just to the point of making money and football. In the same year, a ruling coalition from Hasina's party officials to the court alleged slander Yunus. February 18, 2011, after a lapse of 4 years after the court formally summoned Yunus, and explained that the reason for such a long delay is &quot;because the judicial process requires careful investigation.&quot; 
<br /><br />In addition,<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jaHJpc3RpYW5sb3Vib3V0aW4tc2FsZXMuY29tL2NocmlzdGlhbi1sb3Vib3V0aW4tZXZlbmluZy1jLTYuaHRtbA__" target="_blank">Christian Louboutin Evening</a>, the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation (NRK) by the end of November last year, showing a documentary called the Grameen Bank had 90 the last century, the Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation to provide funds to an institution of their subordinates. Then the Norwegian International Development Minister Erik Solheim Agency for Development Cooperation requested to submit a report on the incident, but the end results are that Yunus did not misappropriate the money. 
<br /><br />However,<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jaHJpc3RpYW5sb3Vib3V0aW4tc2FsZXMuY29tLw__" target="_blank">Christian Louboutin Online</a>, two things led to the Government of Bangladesh Yunus's sharp criticism.

This is because the body's genetic material DNA synthesis and repair needs folic acid, vitamin B12, vitamin B6, vitamin C, vitamin E and other nutrients, and if lack of these nutrients can cause DNA damage can not be repaired, the consequences of radiation damage caused very similar, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jaHJpc3RpYW5sb3Vib3V0aW4tc2FsZXMuY29tLw__" target="_blank">Christian Louboutin Sale</a>,so do health care must eat snacks before.
<br /><br />People importance of vitamins, mainly because it can prevent scurvy, beriberi and other nutrient deficiencies. Recent studies have found that vitamin also has an important role in cancer prevention. Many surveys also show that when compared with good nutrition, lack of vitamin A, vitamin B2, vitamin C, vitamin E are more likely to develop cancer, including lung cancer, gastric cancer, breast cancer, cervical cancer and so on.
<br /><br />Human daily requirement of vitamins is very small, can not be felt by the appetite of vitamin deficiencies. With the accelerated pace of work and food rich in life are prone to vitamin deficiency. This is because most of the snacks, biscuits, potato chips, candy,<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jaHJpc3RpYW5sb3Vib3V0aW4tc2FsZXMuY29tL2NocmlzdGlhbi1sb3Vib3V0aW4tc2FuZGFsLWMtMi5odG1s" target="_blank">Christian Louboutin Sandals</a>, chocolate, sweet drinks and convenience foods contain vitamin are rare. However, many people do not have time to eat breakfast before work, morning and make do with biscuits, instant noodles for lunch, at night in order to solve the frozen food; munch on snacks when you are hungry, thirsty, and then turn to sweet drinks, the situation will inevitably cause vitamin deficiency. Especially the mental, the number of consumed more vitamins, more need to pay attention to timely supplement.
<br /><br />Birds &quot;wing tip&quot; also contain carcinogens.
<br /><br />Chickens, ducks, geese and other birds long tail parts of the upper buttocks, the scientific name &quot;bursa&quot; is a lymph node concentrated, because macrophages in the lymph nodes to be swallowed bacteria and viruses, even cancer-causing substances are also can be swallowed, but can not break down, so the bird, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jaHJpc3RpYW5sb3Vib3V0aW4tc2FsZXMuY29tL2NocmlzdGlhbi1sb3Vib3V0aW4tc2FuZGFsLWMtMi5odG1s" target="_blank">Christian Louboutin Boots</a>,&quot;wing tip&quot; is a filth of the &quot;warehouse.&quot;
<br /><br />You are the cancer susceptible population it? Daily to pigs, cattle, sheep and other meat-eating people, the proportion of colorectal cancer than those who suffer from eating only a few times a month a small amount of meat eaters is 2.5 times higher;
<br /><br />Needs special attention is that vitamin supplements can not completely replace the natural vitamins in food supply. Because the vitamin only in the natural foods and other health ingredients together, can play the most effective anti-cancer effect. Survey data has long proved that rarely eat vegetables, fruits and legumes were much greater chance of cancer. A lot of snacks and convenience foods, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jaHJpc3RpYW5sb3Vib3V0aW4tc2FsZXMuY29tL2NocmlzdGlhbi1sb3Vib3V0aW4tcHVtcHMtYy0zLmh0bWw_" target="_blank">christian louboutin pumps</a>,the vitamin tablets can not even play and eat natural food the same health effects.

<br /><br />Many people fear contamination, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jaHJpc3RpYW5sb3Vib3V0aW4tc2FsZXMuY29tL2NocmlzdGlhbi1sb3Vib3V0aW4tZXZlbmluZy1jLTYuaHRtbA__" target="_blank">Christian Louboutin Evening</a>,fear of color, fear of radiation, but do not know the wrong food choices is an important reason for causing cancer. Unhealthy food to bring the disease and suffering is easy to see, nutritional imbalance in the food the same disease and suffering will bring, but because the disease process is relatively slow, often easily overlooked.
