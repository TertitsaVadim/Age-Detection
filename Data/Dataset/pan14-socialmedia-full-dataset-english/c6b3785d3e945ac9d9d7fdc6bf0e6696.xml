<br />His house is in the village though,
<br />He will not see me stopping here,
<br />To watch his woods fill up with snow.
<br /><br />My little horse must think it queer,
<br />To stop without a farm house near,
<br />Between the woods and frozen lake,
<br />The darkest evening of the year.
<br /><br />He gives his harness bells a shake,
<br />To ask if there is some mistake,
<br />The only other sound is the sweep,
<br />Of easy wind and downy flake,
<br /><br />The woods are lovely dark and deep,
<br />But I have promises to keep,
<br />And miles to go before I sleep,
<br />And miles to go before I sleep.

<br /><br />God understood our desire and thirst for knowledge,
<br />And our need to be led by someone noble and wise,
<br />He needed a heart of compassion,encouragement and patience,
<br />Someone who would accept the challenge regardless of the opposition,
<br />Someone who could see potentials and believe in the best in others,
<br />Someone who could help in the achievement of goals and careers in their lives,
<br />So he made a teacher to shape them......!
<br />So he made a teacher to groom them......!
<br /><br />Happy Teacher's Day to all of you !

But not blue......until now ! Geneticists from Australia Florigene Limited,which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Japanese drinks manufacturer Suntory Limited had first cracked the code of creating &quot;Blue Roses&quot; in 2004.Since then they have been refining the process to the point where true blue roses can be sold to a public eager to possess the once &quot;Impossible Dream&quot;.By inserting genes from the common Pansy and Iris into Rose DNA while at the same time switching off a Rose gene that prevented the production of the blue pigment known as &quot;Delphinidin&quot;,the legendary flower of love will be able to synthesize and express a full range of hues from palest baby blue to deep navy !

<br />Not everything lasts
<br />I understand that now
<br />Everything changed
<br />When you walked away
<br />But I will survive somehow
<br /><br />Though I have regrets
<br />I will learn to forget
<br />And just keep moving on 
<br />Because when love is gone
<br />You have to be strong
<br /><br />Once touched by pain
<br />You are not the same
<br />But time can heal
<br />Your heart again
<br /><br />So let the clouds
<br />That bring you down
<br />Just fade away ! Away !

<br />But after a while
<br />The memories come back

<br />&quot;Where do broken hearts go ! Can they find their way home ?&quot; By Whitney Houston !
<br /><br />So true ! Here is an amazing voice of Whitney Houston.I love this song and love the picture used in this 
<br />clip.It feels nice to sing this song along with old time favourites !
<br /><br />When things break you never put them back together.Exactly the same way happens in case of heart ! And if the heart breaks too many times or the breakage is too great then where do unrepairable hearts go ?
<br /><br />It gets repaired but scar is always left behind ! A scar that tells a story ! A story that is always remembered !
<br /><br />This song is a stunner ! It expresses my emotional,hearty feelings to some extent ! And I just love this song !

<br />She watches as he wipes a tear from his eye and takes a sip of his Coffee.&quot;What is the matter dear ?&quot;she whispers as she steps into the room.&quot;Why are you down here at this time of night ?&quot;she asks him again.
<br />The husband looks up from his Coffee,&quot;I am just remembering when we met twenty years ago and started dating each other.You were only sixteen at that time.Do you rememember back then ?&quot;he says solemnly.
<br />The wife is touched to tears,thinking that her husband is so caring and so sensitive.&quot;Yes,I do !&quot;she replies.
<br />The husband pauses.The words were not coming easily.&quot;Do you remember when your father cought us in the back seat of my car ?&quot;
<br />&quot;Yes I remember !&quot;said the wife lowering herself into a chair beside him.
<br />The husband continues&quot;Do you remember when he showed the shotgun on my face and said either you marry my daughter or I will send you to jail for twenty years ?&quot;
<br />&quot;I remember that too !&quot;she replies softly.
<br />He wipes another tear from his face and says&quot;Had I taken the another option,I would have been out of jail  and led a life of freeman today !&quot;
