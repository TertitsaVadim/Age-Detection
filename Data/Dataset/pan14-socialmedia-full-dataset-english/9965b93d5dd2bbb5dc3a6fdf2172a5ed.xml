This emulsifies the suspended dirt and biomaterials.<br /><br />Subsequent they agitate the zones that acquire the most volume of foot targeted traffic. This serves to loosen the compacted filth.<br /><br />Right after agitation, they rinse the cleansing options used in Step three. This leaves the carpet fibers residue free.
