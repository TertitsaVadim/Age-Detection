Fosamax functions by reducing bone deterioration, a procedure referred to as “resorption.” Associated with natural bone-regulating chemical substances, the drug doesn't inhibit bone mineralization. For that reason, people can take alendronate sodium together with calcium and vitamin D supplements and see some bone mineralization. However, the body doesn't take in the drug well, and much of it is excreted through the kidneys.<br /><br />Fosamax was first identified and sold by pharmaceutical company Merck &amp; Co. They initially approved in September 1995, Merck’s patent expired in 2008, despite the pharmaceutical company’s appeals to block generic versions of the drug  from being available on the market. Now, Barr Pharmaceuticals manufactures the drug as well.<br /><br />Merck continues to sell Fosamax, and it also combines it with vitamin D, selling it as Fosamax+D.
