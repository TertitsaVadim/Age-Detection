<br />Life sometimes gives you surprises are unforgettable moments. They always remain in memory and in the heart like a movie.
<br />The movies sometimes end badly as well and sometimes in real life. But everything changes when the world of cinema is closer to one.

A feeling pure, perfect, special. A gift from God to us. Love for me is that. Something that occurs but asks nothing in return. Only love asks a person's love and true friendship.
<br /> Friendship  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/hug.gif" alt=":)" />  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/thumbs_up.gif" alt=":)" />to me is the best that life can give. It is support, trust company in good times and bad times.
<br />True friendship is very strong. You always have the support a person. Never leaves you alone in the world. It's something that we always have and we must fight and keep on our side and never lose in time.

I always felt what you were thinking ... because the force of love is great ... because the power of love is an illusion when it is actually getting better ... looking at the moon at night over the sea ... I see as they pass the stars and planets and your so far ... but the power of love is so important. Account only see you once more ... and just seconds ... one day there will come and say ... our friendship is strong.
<br />?One day I noticed with surprise that chance and dreams if they are real if you insist ... but always dreaming ... and never leave without knowing what really happens ... Every day that passes like a dream ... every day I lost in your eyes. Dreaming that you stay forever ... in my dreams I see you and I wake up thinking ... is true or a dream? ... But when I look out the window at the landscape ... I realize that is real and you are real ...
<br />?if your heart is for me ... I will not fail nor be mistaken ... an illusion that is real ... every day I have news for you ... nature tells me when you are alone and sad ... and when you're missing ... it will be for a little while ...
<br />? I say a thousand things ... but something tells me that is not the time yet ... you're everything to me ... I want to tell you ... you ... you are unique ... you're happy ... tender ... you are perfect ... my little world that the day goes so fast ... dreaming you return to speak again ... I would tell you how are you? ... music ... you're so so happy ... all for me ... perfect size for me ... my favorite person ... like the horizon full of mysteries ... see you getting away ...
<br />?You are as beautiful as nature ... you're like a dream in my life ... so special that sometimes I lose the horizon ... I love you even if they spend the years ... are so important that if one day you vaz ... could not think that would happen ... do not fence so again ... just ask you if you're going to fire you one day and tell me ... I will look for the promise always be in our way ... I have you like the music to the song ...
<br />?As an angel seeing in the distance ... You are an angel ... always thinking of you ... you talk to God, that all goes well tomorrow will be another day ... soon ... soon will be an evening more ... I will now forces me today I missing ... I need to think ... if I'm doing the right thing ... tomorrow will be another night and I'll calm ... another way of seeing things ... but today I need to think again ... tomorrow morning thinking about you too ... an angel of God will tell me the truth ... in many ways ...

<br /><br />I always think ... every day is a great opportunity for all we can do with the time given to us ... every day we see the beauty of life ... we can see that every day can be wonderful family, friends or pets ... every day we have the opportunity to say thank you, something we use, God or to anyone who supports ... But that very few people do ... so now every day we have to be more observant ... analyze situations better ... looks good as long as you have and know you can do much more than before ...
