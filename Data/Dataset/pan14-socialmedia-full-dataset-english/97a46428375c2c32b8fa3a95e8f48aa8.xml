They have been a mainstay in homes across America for generations. Due to this, various do-it-yourself warriors have come up with hundreds of different styles and modes of accomplishing the same task. Currently vintage style with a twist is all of the rage and refinishing your own coat rack is a great way to add this character to your home (without making permanent changes if the fad fades out) or breaking the bank.<br /><br />Your first step is to search flea markets, antique malls or online websites for coat racks. Explore your options, as <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wZWdhbmRyYWlsLmNvbS8_" target="_blank">coat racks</a><br /> are available in everything from the luxurious, ornate Victorian style to the height of minimalist furniture design in the 1960s. Either plastic or wood will work but if you find something in oak make sure you like the pattern of the wood grain. High quality oak has a very strong grain that will stand out under either paint or stain.<br /><br />Now that you're all set, here are some simple steps to having your perfect coat rack.<br /><br />1. Prepare your workspace: This is an often overlooked step but doing it properly will save you a headache in the end. Put down a plastic tarp or a few trash bags and make sure all materials are within easy reach.<br /><br />2. Clean: All wood products, no matter how they have been finished, love dirt. Even if it looks sparkly clean just assume that it is not. You will be surprised with what you can remove. Wipe plastic down with a wet paper towel.<br /><br />3. Sanding/Scoring: If your coat rack is wood it will need to be sanded down. In general, the more sanding the better as it will leave you with a cleaner and more precise work surface. Plastic will need to be scored (with sandpaper) lightly. This will give the primer something to hold and will prevent flaking.<br /><br />4. Staining/Painting: Carefully apply wood stain in your chosen color, and follow the directions on the can as specifically as possible. If you like a distressed look, brushing the stain on and quickly wiping it away with a rag looks excellent. For plastic, apply one or two coats of primer first. Allow this to dry before applying one or two coats of paint.<br /><br />5. Lacquer (Wood Only): Applying a clear lacquer is optional, but will provide a beautiful sheen to the wood. Ensure you leave it plenty of time to dry.<br /><br />It is important to note that while this method will work for changing an oak  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wZWdhbmRyYWlsLmNvbS9tb3VudGVkY29hdHJhY2suaHRtbA__" target="_blank"> wall coat racks</a> into looking like  maple, there is no reason not to be bold.

Oak looks beautiful under ebony and mahogany staining and adds drama to the preexisting grain.
