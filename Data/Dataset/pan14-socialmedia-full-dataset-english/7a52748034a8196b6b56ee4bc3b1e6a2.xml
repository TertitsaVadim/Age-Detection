When theye angry, do they darken, flash, seethe, or boil'  When theye excited, do they thicken or sear, experience lightning or rivers of fire'<br /><br />Talk about imagery and even writers roll back to their worst high school English class.  That unfortunate because there is no easier tool for characterization than using good consistent imagery.  How many of us have read something like this: His touch was like a hot brand against her skin.  , Her heart quivered with longing as he stabbed her with his arrow of luv.  Okay, maybe not that last one, but you get the idea.  Cliche imagery for cliche stories.<br /><br />So many romance novels end up with Ken and Barbie characters.  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.officialtiffanycoshop.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.officialtiffanycoshop.com</a> Physically theye perfect, emotionally theye perfectxcept for their one scar that is the focus of their arc.  Barbie needs to learn to trust because she been dumped before.  Ken lost his last girlfriend to a fire because he was a coma at the time therefore it was all his fault and he now has a protect the world from its own stupidity.  I making fun here, but romance readers know how the same emotional baggage in the hands of one author is farce in someone else.<br /><br />So how do you make your characters deeply emotional people with real problems instead of Ken in a coma'  Hard work.  Ha!  You thought I was going to say imagery.  tiffany outlet No, good imagery will not save a stupid book.  But consistent imagery will deepen your characters and ere the good  parteep your themes in your head from the beginning all the way through to the end of the book.  Yup.  Since writing is HARD WORK, anything that makes it EASIER WORK gets a thumbs up from me.<br /><br />Raise your hand if youe wondering what the heck I talking about.  Think of your heroine.  For this example, wel call her Better Than Barbie (BT<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cool.gif" alt=":)" />.  What her character arc'  What does she learn through the course of the book'  How does she change'  If you can answer that, sit down and think of an answer.  You can write a credible book without it.  Remember, the answer could be that she doesn change.  Despite everything, she remains rock solid in her beliefs.<br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5vZmZpY2lhbHRpZmZhbnljb3N0b3JlLmNvbQ__" target="_blank">Tiffany Outlet</a><br />Great, now BTB has a character arc.  Let say BTB needs to learn to forgive, not only herself for her bad choices but her Mother From Hell who set her up with the Fianc?from Hell complete with the Family from Hell.  Okay, what image best fits a woman who needs to learn forgiveness'<br /><br />Let start with the easy part: earth, air, fire, or water.  If she a religious character?ater.  You can use all that great baptism, washed clean, purified imagery.  tiffany outlet If she a stable character, grounded in her location or family or her jobhen go with an earth concept.  If BTB is quick tempered, someone who can either lash out or inspireo with fire.  Lastly, air.  I chose air for the dreamers, the mystics, the people who wander around in their brain rather than the world because theye either brilliant (genius academic) or lost in their imagination (airhead creative...ie, me).<br /><br />Let go with the airhead creative.  She an air person.  Therefore colors that work for her would be pastelsight blue, white fluffy clouds.  I make her a blonde with blue eyes that can grow really pale when she off day dreaming.  Her body type is ethereal, ephemeral, and when Not-Ken looks at her, he wonders if shel just be blown away by the troubles of the world.  She is the kind of person that all heroes want to protect.<br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5vZmZpY2lhbHRpZmZhbnljb3N0b3JlLmNvbQ__" target="_blank">Tiffany Jewelry</a><br />When BTB becomes passionate, her eyes darken to a mysterious midnight sky.  Her passion is surrounded by words like lightning, turbulence, and electric sensations will those things that are associated with weather.  Her happy laugh is light and brightens everything around her.  tiffany outlet Her ironic, snarky moments have a crisp snap to them.  Now all of a sudden whenever you write about BTB, you have a whole slew of words to latch onto.  Shel walk lightly instead of with a heavy tread.  Shel float through a room instead of cut or stomp or glide.<br /><br />Now think of her problem and start including words that demonstrate that.  First scenes will include one or two words that indicate her need to forgive: stagnant, stuffy, choking, distant, maybe even dizzy.  But as she moves through the bookspecially in moments that reveal change er imagery will change too.  Her words or clothing will flow, her touch will feel like a benediction or the sun finally coming out.  Learning to forgive will feel like a gentle spring rain that cleanses rather than punishes.<br /><br />Sadly, no one but another brilliant writer will notice your imagery set.  At least not on a conscious level.  It all subconscious, but it helps create a unified feel for your characters that will flow (or drift or root or burn) through your entire book.  And it helps you remember that BTB starts out as an air head but when hanging out with Not-Ken, she gets more grounded, and yet he appreciates the lightness to her spirit.  Maybe she cools his volcano fire.<br /><br />Related Post: <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2JhcmVya2plcnNleTg5MjY5NjMyLmJsb2cuaHIvMjAxMi8wMy8xNjMwMzcwNzQ5L2ltYWdpbmUtdGhpcy10aWZmYW55LW91dGxldC1wYXJ0LTEuaHRtbA__" target="_blank">Imagine This, tiffany outlet Part 1</a>

You have almost certainly heard that a million times but it really is genuine. That's why writing articles is one of the most utilized Internet marketing media these days. It's also among the most abused promoting methods.<br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uZmxicm9uY29zamVyc2V5cy5jb20vL2plZmYtY2FydGVyLWplcnNleXMtYy0xNC5odG1s" target="_blank">Jeff Carter Jersey</a> <br />The on the internet  marketing craze started choosing up with the introduction of FFA (Totally free For ALL) web sites. These web sites permitted you to submit your link or ad, which slowly rotated off the page as new backlinks have been submitted. Once this approach of advertising grew to become identified, scores of individuals rushed to FFA websites and began submitting their advertisements. Programmers invented techniques to automate the procedure of submitting links to countless internet sites within seconds, causing it to turn out to be an ineffective advertising alternative simply because with the scores of people who started <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nhlflyersjerseystore.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.nhlflyersjerseystore.com</a> making use of this method. Hyperlinks would rotate off the page inside of seconds and this ultimately led towards the downfall and reputation of them.<br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uZmxicm9uY29zamVyc2V5cy5jb20vL2plZmYtY2FydGVyLWplcnNleXMtYy0xNC5odG1s" target="_blank">Jeff Carter Jersey</a> <br />One more  advertising approach, which rapidly became ineffective, was banner marketing and exchanges.  Men and women covered their websites with banners, learned how you can cheat exchanges and surfers began to train their eyes to ignore them fully. Consequently, picture advertising also grew to become ineffective.<br /><br />Automated page creation was also an issue as  thousands of folks began to produce gateway pages as being a means to draw within the search engines like google with multiple pages stuffed with search phrases to  enhance their site's page rank. Gateway page generators automated the procedure of creating these pages and quickly they sprang up all above the net. At some point this fad also grew to become useless due to abuse as well as the introduction of smarter search engine spiders.<br /><br />The most recent moneymaking  craze is Google Adwords. The moment pay-per-click marketing grew in acceptance, webmasters found how simple it was to earn revenue by stuffing their web sites with useless content material to be able to profit from textual marketing.  The automation monster appeared yet again which makes it relatively easy to submit posts to countless subject material web sites by just clicking a few buttons.  <br /><br />In methods PLR membership web sites. PLR content articles, often known as Private Label Rights posts or public domain content articles, offer individuals who are also lazy to write their own subject material with a signifies to obtain backlinks back to their site and hopefully sell a number of their merchandise inside the process. <br /><br />Search engines like google have begun penalizing web sites for duplicate subject material.  In response, new programs are being created which randomize paragraphs and alter words inside an report to make them unique enough to bypass the duplicate material filters. So now we've automated article creation?<br /><br />Publishers are beginning to identify the diverse techniques of write-up abuse and it's becoming far more challenging to get content articles accepted. As editors commence tiring of wanting to retain up together with the massive influx of content articles which might be obviously written for the sole goal of gaining hyperlink reputation or to advertise affiliate links, we are going to see much more post directories shut down.<br /><br />Is automation genuinely the monster right here? I think not!<br /><br />Automated report submission is actually a great tool for submitting articles to a big amount of web sites offering it is utilized effectively. So what's the problem?<br /><br />Greed and laziness  plain and straightforward.  <br /><br />Automation allows writers to submit their posts to a lot of sites speedily and very easily, freeing up far more time to write original content material. The problem comes from those that are usually trying to find a shortcut to producing income, instead of to function for it. <br /><br />Write-up marketing abuse will quickly reach its peak just as FFA web sites, banner advertising and gateway pages did. Ultimately we are going to examine private label posts as another passing trend and online publishers will be able to provide their guests with good quality subject material when again.  For now, we are able to only wait until those hoping to get rich rapid find yet another advertising choice to automate and abuse.<br /><br />Related Post: <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3NjaWVuY2VzdGFnZS5jb20vZ3JvdXBfaG9tZS5waHA/Z2lkPTQ0MDI4NzY_" target="_blank">Post  Automation Rears An Ugly Head</a>

Can I use posts to promote my enterprise?<br />Signed, Eager VA<br /><br />Dear Eager VA,<br />Virtual Assistants are springing up all  round the net. It's a really viable company option and more perform at your home moms are jumping on the bandwagon every day. The genuine go-getters will whip up a business card' website straight away with their contact info, about me' data,  and their rates and solutions provided.<br />&lt;a <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nflbroncosjerseys.com%2F%2Fjaromir-jagr-jerseys-c-13.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.nflbroncosjerseys.com//jaromir-jagr-jerseys-c-13.html</a>]Jaromir Jagr Jersey[/url] <br />But, then that site sits and collects dust although they wait for the traffic to roll in. So,<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nhlflyersjerseystore.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.nhlflyersjerseystore.com</a>  what's a Virtual Assistant to perform to  make traffic to their internet site?<br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uZmxicm9uY29zamVyc2V5cy5jb20vL2plZmYtY2FydGVyLWplcnNleXMtYy0xNC5odG1s" target="_blank">Jeff Carter Jersey</a> <br />Oftentimes VAs overlook one from the very best approaches of promoting their websites  write-up writing. Virtual Assistants can write about all sorts of topics  the best way to organize emails, customer support, hiring or firing a VA, methods a VA can benefit a organization, or accounting amongst other items. Then, they're able to share the content articles, just like any other web site  owner to drive visitors to their websites and set up an expert standing within their area. <br /><br />If you're a VA who's new to write-up sharing, it's actually fairly easy. You publish a valuable write-up and incorporate your writer bio in the finish. (See the end of this short article as an illustration.) Then, you submit your write-up to Post Directories in which hungry website owners, weblog  owners and ezine publishers eagerly grab your write-up to publish it on their websites. <br /><br />Now, there is certainly stiff competition so it's not fairly that easy, but that's the gist of how report sharing operates. And, you understand it performs due to the fact you're reading my report that I've written and shared with article directories. There's my URL within the author bio and you've identified my write-up due to the fact somebody has published it on their web site, weblog or within their newsletter. If it operates for me, it can function to suit your needs, too.<br /><br />Write-up sharing is underutilized within the Virtual Assistant field and I hope to find out that change in the coming year. Go grab that cost-free traffic and develop your VA enterprise. Not simply will your VA company develop, but you'll be able to share this strategy of marketing with your consumers and blow them away together with your understanding of world wide web marketing. Finest wishes.<br /><br />Related Post: <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3NjaWVuY2VzdGFnZS5jb20vZ3JvdXBfaG9tZS5waHA/Z2lkPTQ0MDM1MDU_" target="_blank">Report Writing:  Can It Support My Virtual Assistant Business?</a>
