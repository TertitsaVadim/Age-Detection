(SuccessTech Academy) was shot up today cause one child was picked on in school. It looks like school districts love repeating such horrible histories. If people would just look out for the signs this wouldn't of happened. Its a shame people don't care until it happened to them. It takes an actual accident for someone to wake up and pay attention that some kids don't belong in school, they belong some where they can get help but do people notice the signs? No do they really care? There were never any security guards at that school nor where metal detectors. Anyone could of walked up in that school at anytime, theres rarely anyone at the desks. No one will understand what he was feeling, or what was going through his mind. Two teachers that taught me were shot today and I pray they are okay.
<br />Yes some haven't heard of it, its on CNN and action19news.com if you want the latest.

But any way, yes I'm a female gamer, I have every last console ever made, with working cords, remotes, and some games that still work. Some may say, &quot;damn, ole girl has no life&quot;. No, I do have a life, I just so happen to never throw my consoles away cause of my love for video games. I am a pro at what I do. I'm really into racing, shooting, stimulations, and fighting. I would be playing HALO 3 right now if I had someone to play, people don't give me their gamertags all because they know about or of me and know I will pwn you, some give me their gamertags believing I'm soft cause I'm a female. Don't let my gender fool you I have 18 years of gaming experience under my belt. Some that don't mean squat to but who is caring right now? Not me, its folks that has more gaming experience than me and I pwn'd them in Madden '08' and never played Madden in my life.

Others said what I got so far would make a really good book. So you tell me. The book will be called Asilee. Some say its bad luck to show people pieces of a book that isn't finished but I don't care. I'm not superstitious.
<br /><br />Chapter 1
<br />I didn’t ask for the life I have. I didn’t ask to have a mom who would rather hold a 40 oz. than her own daughter. As I sit here and listen to my grandmother tell me how my mother neglected me. At 10 months I was tiny and had cigarette burns on my legs where she fell asleep holding me with a cigarette lying on my leg. Then I was lying in a crib with a dirty diaper on, lying next to a broken window and it’s below-zero outside. She was downstairs at the bar, my grandmother told me. Or she was in the bed with her head cover with blankets while I freeze to death. “If it wasn’t for that man to bring you here to me that day, Ling, you would be dead right now”. As I sit there and let the feeling of reality sink in, I wonder how and why did I deserve such treatment. I got taken from hell to walk right back from what the man took me from. Living here with my grandmother isn’t no different from living with my mother.
<br />I sit here in my room crying, 10 yrs old, thinking why me, “Why me lord, why did you make me so ugly?” I wanted to die; my life was a living hell and I was only 10 yrs old, not even old enough to even have them type of feelings, but they were there, staring me dead in the face.
<br /><br />Chapter 2
<br />“Ling get your ass down here right now and finish the kitchen!” I get up mad as hell because it’s like my brother Dishon don’t have to do anything but eat, sleep, shit, run errands, and play Nintendo. It’s not fair. I wish my little sister were in my place so maybe I can sit in a crib and drink kool-aid from a bottle without a care in the world. I’m standing at the sink washing the dishes when my grandmother comes in the kitchen fussing as usual. “After you done, you can clean the rest of the kitchen.” I smacked my lips. Now I wished I hadn’t because she start yelling at me like I’m some dumb fucka off the streets. “Smack yo’ lips again and I’m going to smack you.” I turn my head and finish cleaning the dishes. “Why I got to be the one that get talked about all the time, I hear her all the time in her room talking to whoever about me and Dishon, and Putt like we some disgrace that she wish she didn’t have to deal with.” 
<br /><br />Then that’s when my mom comes in the house. She always drinking and talking to walls. Sometimes she scares me. When she does my hair she gets mad because my grandmother sent me down early in the morning so she can do it and when she do, she cussing me out and yanking all of my long hair out my head with a comb. I don’t think she like me much. Well I hope today she don’t get into an argument with granny, even though granny is a mean person sometimes, she has taken care of me and been there for me. Where was mom, I have no clue. Maybe this year she’ll remember to give me a birthday present. The last few birthdays had been fun because my mother wasn’t around to ruin it. hopefully this year would be different. I remember the pictures I saw, they were from my first birthday. It looked like I had fun I had friends and family. I looked happy, I looked like I was loved and wanted; now I don’t know. “Ling it don’t take that damn long to wash them little dishes, hurry yo’ ass up and finish the kitchen.”  I wish you would get in here and finish the kitchen, you made this mess.”

For example, females (most) always talking about another female just cause they can or they're jealous. What do females get out of that, I don't know. I wish I knew. Then they brag about all the haters they got, that shit is not cute. If you had so many &quot;haters&quot;, I wouldn't tell nobody that. I wouldn't want to be &quot;hated&quot;, like most females want to. Down inside though, they're miserable. Sometimes, its so great being a loner. Then we got those females who go after their best friend boyfriend, they fuck around and get caught and now, they wasted a lifetime friendship for a 5 minute affair. It's sad that most females like to refer to themselves as &quot;bitches&quot; why I don't know, but when a man call them a bitch they want to get hostile and start crying. Shit you asked for it. If you don't respect yourself, you're not gone get respected. Then we got these young ass girls that think their in love, fuck around and get pregnant, half the time the boyfriend leaves. So many females now lack any common sense, especially gold diggers, what do they get out of draining another person of what they got? What they  too damn sorry or lazy to get their own shit? Its fucking pitiful. They're the reason why men think all females are the same. 
<br /> Discuss if you want.

Did you get through your resolutions? Or did you just sit on your ass most of the year and did nothing? What are your plans for next year? What are you going to do differently? These questions are asked to me every year around this time of the year. Why I don't know. Next year, I'll learn how to drive and get my license, and start college which I should of been done. Don't let life pass you by. Time waits for no one. You're not promised the next second.

My brother learned that last night. He was set up by people we thought was friends. We helped them out when they need it. Then they just go and set my big brother up. I guess well I hope he has learned a lesson. You can't befriend everyone. Some people are just crooked and it sucks. You really can't trust anyone anymore. It hurts that they would do something like this to him. The world is a cruel place to live. Sometimes living is a whole lot harder than dying.

Instead of going by what you think Some dumb imbecile on here called me bitter. Where and how the hell he came up with that I have no clue. I'm not the one who got issues. He look like something who lives in the back of a corner store. But hey I'm just going on assumptions. When I do shit back to those who do it to me, they can't handle it. I'm very blunt and to the point, I don't have time for people like that. When I socialize with people on here, I want them to be on the same level I'm on. Or just don't add nor talk to me. I can find someone else to socialize on here. That's one of the things that piss me off with people in the E-world. They're so quick to say shit behind that monitor of theirs, they wouldn't say shit like that in person so they can miss me with that bullshit.

He can't he got blacklisted before he even had a chance...Niggas like him on this E-net, kills me where I almost bust a E-gut. Seeing them get so damn mad is so comical. This is just the net and yet he called me out my name all because this is just what it is, a website. The shit I said wouldn't of made him mad if I was in person with him. What's so different than that though?
<br />I love the little message I left him after he called me out my name.
<br /><br />&quot;wow like you must be hurt....you're calling me out my name...I must've hit a nerve..wow you're such a statistic....why would I talk to you...dumb fuck you added me...where was your motivation? There was none, I was just another pretty face. I'm crazy cause I'm real and blunt, be as it may then. I'll sleep better at night knowing you're such a dumb ass. &amp; you let me get under your skin. It looks like you have social issues...what is your dumb ass doing on a website like this if you let someone like me get under your skin?...Answer that...&amp; oh yea, I always get the last word&quot;.
<br /><br />&amp; With that, it was over, he didn't have anything else to say. Cause he just contradicted himself if anything else. He's the main reason why I bust a gut on here once a week. I love this website.
