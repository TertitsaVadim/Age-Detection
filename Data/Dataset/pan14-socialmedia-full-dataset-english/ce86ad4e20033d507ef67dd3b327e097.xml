<br />I hate you because you now hold it in your hand
<br />I hate you because you cloud my mind
<br />I hate you because you're there all the time
<br />I hate you because you brighten my soul
<br />I hate you because I now see how worthless my life would be without you
<br />And even after i say what I hate I still can't help but love you because you are everything I have ever wanted!!!

<br />When I stand up for those I love, they call me a BITCH.
<br />When i speak my mind, think my own thoughts or do things my way, they call me a BITCH.
<br />Being a BITCH means I won't compromise whats in my heart.
<br />It means I live life MY way.
<br />It means I won't allow anyone to step on me.
<br />When I refuse to tolerate injustice and speak against it I am defined as a BITCH.
<br />The same thing happens when I take time for myself instead of being everyone's maid, or when I act a little selfish.
<br />It means I have courage and strength to allow myself to be who I truly am and won't become anyone's idea of what they think I &quot;should&quot; be.
<br />I am outspoken, opinnionated and determined. I want what I want and there's nothin wrong with that!
<br />So try to stomp on me, try to douse my inner flame, try to squash every ounce of beauty iI hold within me.
<br />You won't succed. And if that makes me a BITCH, then so be it.
<br />I embrace the title ad am proud to bear it!

<br />I would do it just for you,
<br />And share with you it's beauty
<br />On the days you are feeling blue.
<br />If I could build a mountain
<br />You could call you very own,
<br />A place to find serenity,
<br />A place to be alone.
<br />If I could take your troubles
<br />I would toss them in the sea,
<br />But all these i'm finding 
<br />Are impossible for me.
<br />I cannot build a mountain,
<br />Or catch a rainbow fair,
<br />But let me be what I know best
<br />A friend who's always there.

<br /><br />I wouldn't have to hide away, the unhappiness and the pain. I wouldn't have to play the character, never ever again.
<br /><br />I could be the person, the one I want to be. Not the fake, the original. The one and only me.

<br />But go to a place that is something like home,
<br />Where they sleep the deep sleep, as quiet as stone,
<br />Until we can join them when our lives are done.
<br />Children who die are not really dead,
<br />My hart bleeds a little more every hour i spend away from you. 
<br />My sole crys more and more every minute it spends away from your's
<br />The light in my eyes darkens every second i dont get to see your face.
<br />My hearing fades every day I dont get to hear your voice.
<br />Every moment i spend away from you the more numb my body becomes.
<br />But i would give it all away just to be yours for one day

You kept hanging out with bad people, you were easily slipping away. And it all ended on this unfaithful day. For you went to a party and you drank and drank and drank. And you got into a car with a dirty skank. You turned the key in the ignition, put the pedal to the floor. You were going too fast, and now your here no more. Why did you drink and drive? Didn't your mother tell you it was bad? Didn't she tell you that if you did it would make everyone very sad? You killed yourself in that stupid car and now you're gone, you've gone too far. For I can't see your lovely smile or your beautiful face. I can't hear your wonderful voice, I can't feel no more grace. After the funeral I took the long way home, I walked so slow, I just wanted to be alone. Bad things were running through my head, I couldn't get you off my mind. Well I thought this is the end, i'm so selfish, so unkind. I took a knife into my room and slid it across my wrists, go out a photo of you and gave you a kiss. I laid there for hours, waiting to die, my friends is all i could think of and all I could do is cry. Oh My God! What have I done? I've left everyone! I tried to sit up tried to yell out to my mum. But it was too late, I was weak. This is my fate, i'm sorry mum, i'm sorry dad. Don't be sad, please don't be mad. My breathing got shorter as I held his picture tight, and laid there on my bed and died right there that night.

And everlasting love, HIs mind is always casting, Always rejected and lame. Not one flicker of flame. His mercury wish playing silent like a fish. An obsession with one girl. To him a beautiful pearl. In despair, he found her ribbon, gold. She was not to know the ribbon he would forever hold. She was cool, he was not. To her, he was not even rot. He was teased and poked, til one day he chocked. They found him hung, from the ribbon gold he was strung. He idol shed a tear. She imagined now how he lived in fear. His fault was to love. But to the side people would shove, the who didn't try to be cool. His peers, cold and cruel. The boy had done no wrong. They just didn't want him to belong.
