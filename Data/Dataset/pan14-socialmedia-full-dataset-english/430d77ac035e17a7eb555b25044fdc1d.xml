Our greed or lack of self control is our undoing.Psalm 119: talks abt how the words and law of God helps to keep us focus and train our heart to be God fearing.Following the law of God helps us to behave proper thereby avioding naughty mistakes of life.If you dont drink alchohol you 'll not be drunk,if u dont smoke you are not liable to die young,if you aviod premarital or extral marital affairs AIDS 'll be reduce.The devil has no say or authority over how you live and run your life,the power to choose is with you please CHOOSE RIGHT! Some mistakes are too costly to repair.PEACE.

Being one is protecting the family,s integrity and be ready to stick your neck out for your spouse when the need arise.Being one is not allowing ang body (friends,extended family members)to talk or look down at your spouse at your watch.The bible also emphasis that both were naked and were not ashame it simple means there should be no secret between spouse.Some people feel comfortable in sharing secrets with friends and extended family rather than their spouse,this should not be your spouse should be your best friend before any other person.Being one does not happen over the night it takes time,  continouse effort, knowledge and prayers. cheers.
