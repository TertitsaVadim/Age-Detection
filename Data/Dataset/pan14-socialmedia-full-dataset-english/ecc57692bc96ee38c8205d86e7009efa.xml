<br /><br />We saw the iPhone 4S launch in mid-October last year, which broke the traditional cycle of the June/July launches of previous iPhones, and the Cupertino-based firm could well be about to shake things up once again.
<br /><br />Chinese site Sina published a report that was picked up by analyst Brian White, of Topeka Capital Markets, predicting the sixth generation of iPhone would be launched in September but hinting that the end of August could also be a possible date.
<br />Possible battery issues
<br /><br />White went on to reveal that just 30% of batteries produced for Apple were meeting the firm's high standards, which he believes puts the August date in doubt.
<br /><br />&quot;If there is a battery challenge, we trust that Apple will be able to figure it out in time for a September launch,&quot; said White.
<br /><br />It's still unclear what Apple will pack into the iPhone 5, but we reckon a beefed up processor, bigger screen and NFC technology are highly likely.
<br /><br />We're not sure exactly where Sina.com is getting its information - possibly from one of the battery vendors concerned - so we recommend a pinch of salt be taken with it (as is ever the case with Apple rumours).
<br /><br />Apple's potential decision to launch the iPhone 5 in September may be in reaction to rumours surrounding the Samsung Galaxy Note 2 predicting a launch in the same month.

When functioning normally the battery gets fully charged whenever the charger is connected for a few hours. Over time, if the charger cable is connected and disconnected with the battery level at different levels each time, the status of the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5lYmF0dGVyeS5jb20uYXUvTGFwdG9wLWJhdHRlcmllcy5odG1s" target="_blank">laptop battery</a> can be affected. For example the computer may show the battery at 87 percent yet the battery charge may be actually be more or less than that. Calibrating the battery corrects this and allows the battery to once again be fully charged.
<br /><br />Unplug your laptop's charger cable and run the computer off of battery power until a warning appears advising that the battery is low.
<br /><br />Plug the charger cable back in and leave it plugged in until the battery charged status is at 100 percent. If after hours of being connected the charged status does not reach 100 percent, the battery may need to be re-calibrated.
<br /><br />Unplug the charger cable again and use the computer until the low <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5lYmF0dGVyeS5jb20uYXU_" target="_blank">laptop batteries</a> warning appears. Save any work and close any running programs. Continue to use the computer until it shuts off or goes to sleep on its own.
<br /><br />Leave the computer in this sleep/off state for at least five hours. A good method is to do this before you go to bed, this way by morning the computer will be ready for the next step.
<br /><br />Reconnect the charger cable and keep the charger connected until the battery indicator is at 100 percent. You can turn the computer back on and use it during this charging period. This will re-calibrate the battery.
<br /><br />Keep the laptop plugged into the charger cable when possible during use. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5lYmF0dGVyeS5jb20uYXUvb3V0c291cmNlL291dG1vZGVsLnBocC83OCtVbml2ZXJzYWwtRXh0ZXJuYWwtTGktSW9uLUxhcHRvcC1CYXR0ZXJ5Lmh0bQ__" target="_blank">External Laptop batteries</a> stop receiving a charge once the battery is full and the laptop will run off the power from a wall outlet.
<br /><br />Unplug the charger from time to time to allow the battery to be used. The battery needs to become partially drained from time to time.
<br /><br />Always use the appropriate battery designed for your laptop and the associated charger. Using a charger that does not go with your laptop or using the wrong battery can lead to laptop damage or even a fire risk.

You must charge your laptop to keep it operational. Most of these batteries can hold a charge for a few hours. Keep your <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5lYmF0dGVyeS5jb20uYXUvMWJyYW5kLnBocC9MYXB0b3AtYmF0dGVyaWVzLFNPTlksMSxTT05ZLmh0bQ__" target="_blank">Sony laptop battery</a> charged, and subsequently keep your laptop mobile, by charging your machine with the power adapter that came with it
<br /><br />Drain the laptop's battery as much as possible. Charging the battery when it is depleted will increase the the battery's load cycle consistency.
<br /><br />Connect the battery adapter into the laptop. The port to connect your adapter to the laptop is usually located on the back of the machine. This accessory will keep your computer on if in use and will subsequently charge the battery.
<br /><br />Wait for the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5lYmF0dGVyeS5jb20uYXUvMWJyYW5kLnBocC9MYXB0b3AtYmF0dGVyaWVzLElCTSwxLElCTS5odG0_" target="_blank">IBM laptop batteries</a> to fully charge. A battery icon located in the taskbar will show that the battery is charging. Hovering your mouse over this icon will show the charge percentage increasing as it is connected to a power source. Open up the laptop's manual that came with the laptop to determine the amount of time it will take to charge your battery.
<br /><br />Remove the battery adapter. This prevents the battery from overcharging and losing its maximum charge potential.

<br /><br />Current tax incentives for the emerging technology sector–much of which centers around supporting the burgeoning electric car business–are scheduled to be phased out as part of tax policy revisions recently approved by Gov. Rick Snyder and supported by Republicans in the legislature, who hold that the industry incentives are not paying off as automakers and supporters of the incentives once thought they would.
<br /><br />But state politicians speaking at Dearborn City Hall on Monday afternoon disagreed, maintaining that jobs are being created, and that more and clearer incentives to both businesses and individuals are needed.
<br /><br />“The advanced <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5lYmF0dGVyeS5jb20uYXUvTGFwdG9wLWJhdHRlcmllcy5odG1s" target="_blank">laptop battery</a> sector is a rapid-growing part of the high-tech sector, and Michigan is uniquely situated to be one of the great, integral parts of that,” said Sen. Morris Hood (D-Dearborn). “We want to make sure that we’re open for business and allow businesses to come right here and give them all the incentive packages that we can and give them all the help we can so they can locate right here in Michigan.”
<br /><br />Rep. George Darany (D-Dearborn) a Dearborn native and former Dearborn City Council member, added that he believes advanced battery technology is the way to allow metro Detroit to continue to be at the forefront of automotive technology advances.
<br /><br />“With Ford Motor Company, Dearborn was one of the first in the nation to get America on wheels,” he said Monday. “We need to continue that innovation that sets our community apart from others in the nation. That innovation can be found in the advanced <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5lYmF0dGVyeS5jb20uYXU_" target="_blank">laptop batteries</a> sector.”
<br /><br />The proposal, which legislators say they plan to introduce in the state House of Representatives as early as next week, includes several incentives:
<br /><br />* Tax credits for battery producers and manufacturers, including battery pack manufacturing, facilities construction and vehicle integration
<br />    * Income tax credits for people who buy an electric vehicle made in Michigan
<br />    * Tax credits for the purchase and installation of electric vehicle charging stations
<br />    * A $50-million economic gardening grant for electric vehicle and battery businesses, to come from the Michigan Economic Development Corporation
<br /><br />Dearborn Mayor Jack O’Reilly reaffirmed his support of electric vehicles earlier this year, boasting the city’s decision to add electric charging stations to a new parking garage in east Dearborn, located behind the Midwest Medical Center.
<br /><br />The advanced battery sector also has federal support, as evidenced by the more than $4 billion invested in the industry–including about $2 billion in Michigan.
<br /><br />But, added Congressman John Dingell on Monday, &quot;Michigan has to do something to make sure that the federal efforts are sustained by vigorous efforts at the state level.&quot;
<br /><br />Legislatures speaking in Dearborn on Monday said that the proposal already has major Democrat support in the House and Senate. The next step is proving to constituents that the advanced battery sector is spurring job creation and bolstering local and state economies.
<br /><br />Rep. Dian Slavens (D-Canton) says that the industry has already created 6,600 jobs and attracted $3 billion in new investments.
<br /><br />Examples include A123 Systems, which opened a lithium ion automotive <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5lYmF0dGVyeS5jb20uYXUvUG93ZXItVG9vbHMtYmF0dGVyaWVzLmh0bWw_" target="_blank">power tool battery</a> manufacturing plant in Livonia in 2010. And in July, the U.S. Council for Automotive Research awarded $9.62 million to Troy-based LG Chem Power for advanced battery development.
<br /><br />“These targeted incentives have created thousands of jobs and helped make Michigan a center for innovation and entrepreneurship,” Slavens said. “We cannot afford to stop nurturing and growing these industries.”

All laptops come with <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5lYmF0dGVyeS5jb20uYXUv" target="_blank">IBM thinkpad x61 batteries</a> which make it a portable gadget, these batteries usually fit into a slot on the underside of the laptop computer.
<br /><br />The battery of a laptop is one of its most important parts. Every laptop company has different batteries, and many laptop companies have different batteries for different models. They all vary by design, size, voltage, capacity, chemistry, and amperage, so the charger designed for one model will not work with any other model. Not only do chargers differ between brands, but they are not consistent with different models within that brand.
<br /><br />Battery chargers are also lightweight and compact in size as a result they will easily fit into your travel bag, or briefcase to take with you. A charger is just something that laptop computer owners should never be without. A laptop computer typically has two sources of power. The laptop power usually comes from a storage <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5lYmF0dGVyeS5jb20uYXUv" target="_blank">Lenovo thinkpad sl410 battery</a> source and there is also an AC adapter that provides power. Without this internal power supply unit, the portability of a laptop would be impossible, so it is very important to have a reliable laptop battery with excellent battery life.
<br /><br />As previously mentioned, laptop batteries come in many shapes and sizes, as well as different voltages and configurations. When purchasing a laptop computer, you should ensure that you buy a battery charger to match the precise model. When it comes to laptop computer batteries, a battery is not just a thing that you buy generically. Shopping for a replacement <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5lYmF0dGVyeS5jb20uYXUv" target="_blank">Sony VGP-BPS9A/B battery</a>, it is important to ensure that it is compatible with your specific model.

<br /><br /><strong>How To take care your HP HSTNN DB72 Laptop battery?</strong>
<br />When using a equipment as a desktop replacement the battery should not be left in for long periods of time. The equipment will over time discharge the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5lYmF0dGVyeS5jb20uYXUvMWJyYW5kLnBocC9MYXB0b3AtYmF0dGVyaWVzLEhQLDEsSFAuaHRt" target="_blank">HP Laptop battery</a>. Remove the battery, making sure that it is charged to 50% and store it in a dry, warm place. Ensure that it is wrapped protectively and nothing will be dropped on it. The battery should be re-installed every 3-4 weeks and allowed to fully discharge. Leaving a battery in storage for longer than this without using could cause the battery to fully discharge as the circuitry of the battery itself consumes power. Leaving a battery in a equipment while using an electrical outlet for long periods of time will keep the battery in a constant state of charging up and that will reduce the life cycle of the Laptop batteries.

According to Wedbush analyst Scott Sutherland, Apple is on its way to make monster record sales in the following quarters, up to at least the first half of 2012 based on its agenda of upcoming products.
<br /><br />There’s the iPhone 5 that could launch next month with the latest iOS 5 operating system and an LTE successor that could release first quarter, 2012. Which is also around when we expect to see the iPad 3 that has created so much interest.
<br /><br />Apple’s strength lies in its continuous evolution and launch of new products. iPhone 4 is already selling in millions across the globe and iPhone 5 will follow suit with the lower end iPhone geared towards emerging markets. iPad 2 and iPhone sales are going to help Apple sweep the floor this holiday season.
<br /><br />Apple will also update its Mac and iPod lineup soon, in keeping with tradition. And it may enter the connected TV space and leverage on the latest going technology. Apple is also strong in its global sales rollout, which will continue and expand to more countries in the coming year. Apple’s iCloud service will drive more app and media sales if it is executed in a proper way.
<br /><br />Right now, Apple is in a very good place and that’s not going to change any time soon. Sutherland estimates that Apple will ship 26 million iPhones in the first quarter of 2012, up from 23 million in 2011.

		<document id="ac1d718fbf5fb568da19a584cbb50f8c" url=""><![CDATA[Changing your iPhone battery part one<br/><br/>For the past few weeks, my old iPhone 3GS has been unable to hold a charge for more than an hour. Words cannot describe how frustrating it is to type a long email to my editor, only to have it disappear along with my iPhone’s power. 
<br /><br />There are three options to fix this.
<br /><br />1. Get a new phone
<br /><br />This solution, while fixing everything, is the most expensive. Though buying a new phone might be fun, you’ll also either have to pay around $500 for an unlocked phone or renew your contract with your current carrier. I plan on buying an iPhone 5 when it comes out (possibly next month), but I also need a phone for the time being that won’t break my budget.
<br /><br />2. Have Apple replace the battery.
<br /><br />Apple will replace the battery for you if the battery falls below 50 percent of its capacity a year after purchasing your iPhone (two years if you also bought AppleCare). This is great for others, but I bought my iPhone 3GS in April 2010. According to Apple’s help page, it will cost more than $80 when you include shipping. This option isn’t the most expensive, but you’re also shipping your phone to Apple — meaning you won’t have it for a week. As a college student, losing my iPhone for a week is not an option for me.
<br /><br />3. Replace the battery yourself
<br /><br />By doing this on my own, I’d be able to save more than 75 percent of the cost of letting Apple do the same process (the kits cost between $10 and $20), and I wouldn’t have to send my phone anywhere. Sounds great, right? In a perfect world, this would be the best option, however, the replacement process is a tough one.
<br /><br />For Android and Windows Phone 7 owners, replacing the battery is easy. Just buy a battery online, and then open the back component of the phone. But replacing it on the iPhone is a multi-step process. On an iPhone, the battery is located behind the screen, and the back of the phone doesn’t come off like it does on other phones. The only way to remove the battery is to remove the screen, which is dangerous because everything is intricately connected on the iPhone, and accidentally removing the wrong component can render the whole phone useless.
<br /><br />My dilemma now comes down to this: is it worth $20 to buy a replacement kit and fix my phone weeks before the iPhone 5 comes out?
<br /><br />Absolutely.
<br /><br />I ordered the iPhone 3GS battery kit from iFixit. When it arrives, I’ll take pictures and videos of how I replace it. Hopefully this will help you guys, since I hear the process is similar to how it’s done on the iPhone 4.

<br /><br />Battery life is terribly important, as any smartphone owner knows, and we wanted to make sure Apple's promises weren't just that. And now, the results are in, courtesy of Senior Editor Eric Franklin.
<br /><br />When used with Sprint's 3G EV-DO Rev. A network, we beat Apple's promised talk time of 8 hours by an additional hour and 18 minutes. That's our strongest iPhone battery test to date, surpassing each of the previous three iPhones that run on 3G (the first iPhone only supported EDGE).
<br /><br />Since carrier networks can affect performance, we'll repeat the process once we get AT&amp;T's and Verizon Wireless' 4S in house. But here's that we have so far. All times are in hours.
<br /><br />Model 	       iPhone 4S (Sprint) 	4 (Verizon) 	4 (AT&amp;T) 	3GS 	3G
<br />Talk time 	9.2 	                 7.08 	         7.76 	         5.36 	4.95
<br /><br />We're also running battery tests for music and video playback and we'll compare the download speeds on the 4S between all three carriers. We're still collecting data, but I'll report our findings here as they come in. And for everything you need to new about the newest iPhone, check our full review of the iPhone 4S.

<br /><br />Main computer battery does not fully charge.
<br />Solutions
<br /><br />Computer AC/DC cable is bad not allowing the computer battery to charge
<br /><br />Verify that the AC/DC cable is not bad by removing the battery from the laptop and seeing if the computer can power on without the battery.
<br /><br />Battery is bad or old
<br /><br />If the power plug is good it's likely that your <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5lYmF0dGVyeS5jb20uYXUvMWJyYW5kLnBocC9MYXB0b3AtYmF0dGVyaWVzLEhQLDEsSFAuaHRt" target="_blank">laptop battery for HP</a> is bad. If you're using a laptop with Microsoft Windows consider getting and installing BatteryCare on the computer to look at the total capacity of the battery.
<br /><br />Try leaving the laptop connected to the power with the battery inserted for at least two hours. If the battery still doesn't seem to charge, we suggest having the battery and the laptop serviced or repaired.
<br /><br />If the computer and battery is not in warranty we suggest replacing the battery as it's very likely that it is just a bad battery. Additional buying tips and information on buying a new battery can be found on our battery buying tips page.
<br /><br />Battery charger board is bad
<br /><br />If the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5lYmF0dGVyeS5jb20uYXUvMWJyYW5kLnBocC9MYXB0b3AtYmF0dGVyaWVzLEFQUExFLDEsQVBQTEUuaHRt" target="_blank">Apple macbook battery</a> has been replaced or an alternate battery from an alternate identical laptop does not work in the computer, it is likely that the power or charger board within the laptop is bad.

Laptop batteries should be calibrated to restore and maintain battery efficiency. Calibrating a battery involves draining or discharging the battery completely and then recharging it. Typically when using a laptop battery, you drain the battery only to a certain level; however most users shut off the laptop prior to the battery completely discharging. This process involves fully draining the battery. If you drain or discharge the battery, then recharge it, and the laptop won't reboot, it's likely that the battery may be dead or didn't recharge. Troubleshooting the battery and power adapter will help you determine the cause of the problem.
<br /><br />Turn off the laptop. Remove the power adapter.
<br /><br />Flip the laptop upside down. Slide the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5lYmF0dGVyeS5jb20uYXUvb2VtX2JhdHRlcmllcy5waHAvTGFwdG9wLWJhdHRlcmllcyxIUC1DT01QQVEsMTczNjMsMSwzODEzNzQtMDAxLmh0bQ__" target="_blank">381374-001 battery</a> latch, or press the battery release button, to release the mechanism that locks a battery in place. Lift the battery upward to remove.
<br /><br />Insert the power adapter into the side of the laptop. Turn the laptop on. If the laptop does not turn on, the problem is the power adapter. Ensure the power adapter is plugged into a working electrical outlet. If the electrical outlet is working, but the computer will not power on, the power adapter needs to be replaced. If the laptop powers on, the power adapter is working. Turn off the laptop and remove the power adapter.
<br /><br />Wipe a cotton swab dampened in rubbing alcohol on the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5lYmF0dGVyeS5jb20uYXUvcHJvX3Nob3cucGhwL0xhcHRvcC1iYXR0ZXJpZXMsSFAtQ09NUEFRLDY4OTI0MzYsMSxCdXNpbmVzcy1Ob3RlYm9vay1uYzgyMDAuaHRtbA__" target="_blank">HP Compaq NC8200 battery</a> contacts and contacts in the battery housing unit to remove dust and buildup. Buildup on the contacts can interfere with the charging process.
<br /><br />Place the laptop battery back into the battery housing unit. Press firmly down until the battery pops or snaps back into place.
<br /><br />Insert the power adapter into the side of the laptop. Allow the battery to charge uninterrupted for eight to twelve hours.
<br /><br />Remove the power adapter from the side of the laptop. Turn the laptop on. If the laptop won't turn on, the battery needs to be replaced.

Sometimes you have to go to abroad because of important projects. Moreover, you don’t have enough time to complete your important works over your desktop computers. At that time, you use laptop computers because you can complete your works on the way and anywhere you take rest or stay. It is a fact that laptop is the next evolution in computing. Every businessperson, students, teachers, tourists can take their important work with these computers without necessarily being limited. On the other hand, for laptop computer, laptop battery is considered as one of the greatest factors. It provides power to your laptop so that you can keep your important work continues over your laptop for a certain period of time.
<br /><br />Laptop battery provides power to your laptop between two to four hours, although power performance depends on the actual task being performed. It is a fact that more tasks need more power and in this way the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5lYmF0dGVyeS5jb20uYXUvb2VtX2JhdHRlcmllcy5waHAvTGFwdG9wLWJhdHRlcmllcyxBQ0VSLDU0Mzk3LDEsQVMwN0E1MS5odG0_" target="_blank">ACER AS07A51 battery</a> time will be less. Therefore it is always recommended that you are supposed to go with the same company that manufactured laptop to avoid compatibility problems. Although there are a number of manufacturers available in the market, you should purchase branded battery that should be full of latest power capacity. 
<br /><br />Laptop battery comes in different versions but now three kinds of batteries are being used widely and these are Nickel Metal Hydride batteries, Nickel Cadmium batteries, and Lithium Ion batteries. The main advantage of these batteries is that they are rechargeable, while you are in journey you can use them easily after recharge them. In fact among these <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5lYmF0dGVyeS5jb20uYXUvb2VtX2JhdHRlcmllcy5waHAvTGFwdG9wLWJhdHRlcmllcyxIUCw1ODc4OSwxLDQ0MTQyNS0wMDEuaHRt" target="_blank">HP 441425-001 batteries</a>, Lithium Ion (LiON) is considered as the most used battery; while it is costly compared to other types of batteries but it is efficient as well as reliable. According to experts nickel metal hydride battery has a shorter lifetime compared to a lithium ion battery.
<br /><br />It is noticed that people may often get confused when they want to buy a laptop battery as there are a number of manufacturers available in the market. Therefore, if you are going to purchase this kind of battery by yourself, then you are recommended to try for a brand name that has a permanent reputation to sustain its quality.

After a few uses, batteries may also fail to hold a charge as well as they did at first, and they may run low on power in less time than before. While these <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5lYmF0dGVyeS5jb20uYXUvb2VtX2JhdHRlcmllcy5waHAvQ2FtY29yZGVyLWJhdHRlcmllcyxTT05ZLDIxMjI1LDIsTlAtRjUzMC5odG0_" target="_blank">SONY NP-F530 camcorder batteries</a> can be replaced with new ones, over time this can be expensive. Certain steps can be taken to prevent battery depletion and extend the life of a camcorder battery.
<br /><br />Allow the battery to fully discharge. When a camcorder signals that the battery is low, the first reaction is to charge it right away. Not allowing a battery to fully discharge before it is recharged can actually shorten its lifespan.
<br /><br />Avoid overcharging the battery. Another common problem with battery life on a camcorder battery is that they are left on the charger for several hours at a time, often overnight. Overcharging batteries can actually make them weaker over time and lessen their ability to hold a charge.
<br /><br />Read the battery instructions. Most <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5lYmF0dGVyeS5jb20uYXUvcHJvX3Nob3cucGhwL0NhbWNvcmRlci1iYXR0ZXJpZXMsU09OWSwzMDE3LDIsRENSLVRSVjFWRS5odG1s" target="_blank">SONY DCR-TRV1VE camcorder batteries</a> come with instructions on proper charging. The owner's manual for a camcorder can also contain this information. It will indicate how long the battery will need to be charged for and the expected life of that battery.
<br /><br />Avoid extreme temperatures. Battery life will be longer if they are kept away from extreme heat or cold. Room temperature or approximately 72 degrees is the best temperature for batteries. While it may not always be possible to protect batteries from the elements, especially when traveling, it is best to keep them covered and in a spot where they will not be exposed to either heat or cold air.
<br /><br />Remove the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5lYmF0dGVyeS5jb20uYXUvcHJvX3Nob3cucGhwL0NhbWNvcmRlci1iYXR0ZXJpZXMsSlZDLDI5MzQ3LDIsR1otTUc1MC5odG1s" target="_blank">JVC GZ-MG50 battery</a> from the camcorder when not in use. Even though a device may not be on, keeping a battery inserted into the camcorder may cause it to run low. Separate the two and store them separately in the camera bag.

<br /><br />Laptop computers, without a doubt, are the lifeblood of many a businessperson today. Portable, convenient, they allow us to work on the run and do more business. Laptop batteries are essential to keep this resource working, as it should.
<br /><br />The precursor to the laptop as we know it today was introduced by IBM back in 1986 and was called &quot;The PC Convertible&quot;. It weighed five and a half kilograms and cost around $3500.00.
<br /><br />As laptop computers have evolved, so too have laptop batteries.
<br /><br />o The first type of battery used in laptops was Nickel- Cadmium (NiCad). These can still be found in some older laptops. Their lifespan between recharges is about two hours, however, this decreases with each recharge. Also, if a NiCad laptop battery is charged for too long it may explode.
<br /><br />o The next type of <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5lYmF0dGVyeS5jb20uYXUvb2VtX2JhdHRlcmllcy5waHAvTGFwdG9wLWJhdHRlcmllcyxBQ0VSLDcxNDI3LDEsQUsuMDA2QlQuMDIwLmh0bQ__" target="_blank">ACER AK.006BT.020 laptop battery</a> used was Nickel-Metal Hydride (NiMH). These laptop batteries last longer than NiCad batteries but their total lifespan is shorter.
<br /><br />o The current standard laptop battery is the Li-ion battery. As well as being light and having a long life span they can also be randomly charged and won't overheat if charged for too long. Being thinner, the Li-ion battery is ideal as a notebook battery and can last for between 950 and 1200 recharges.
<br /><br />Perhaps even more crucial to our business life as well as our personal life is the cell phone. There are also three different types of cell phone batteries:
<br /><br />o Lithium-ion <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5lYmF0dGVyeS5jb20uYXUvcHJvX3Nob3cucGhwL0xhcHRvcC1iYXR0ZXJpZXMsSFAtQ09NUEFRLDEwNDM1ODI3LDEsQlVTSU5FU1MtTk9URUJPT0stNjUxNUIuaHRtbA__" target="_blank">HP COMPAQ 6515b Batteries</a>: these are the newest type of cell phone battery and, while having certain advantages over the older NIMH and NICD batteries, care must still be taken to ensure they perform at their best. For example, a new lithium-ion battery should be &quot;conditioned&quot;. What this basically means is that for the battery's first three charge cycles, fully charge the battery overnight and allow it to fully discharge before charging it again. This will increase the life and effectiveness of the cell phone battery.
<br /><br />o NIMH Batteries: These batteries also should be conditioned in the same way as a Lithium-ion battery. It is important to remember
<br />that extensive overcharging (i.e.: on a battery charger for more than twenty-four hours) can damage these cell phone batteries.
<br /><br />o NICD Batteries: These are the oldest type of cell phone battery and, as is the case with the laptop computer, are less reliable than the newer types.
<br /><br />Okay, so we know we'd be sunk without our laptops and cell phones. But what about the car? Cars have batteries too. Perhaps you ride a Harley Davidson - not without a motorcycle battery! It's interesting to think where we'd be if the afore-mentioned &quot;zapping episode&quot; took place. We know that our forefathers coped without batteries but could we?
<br /><br />Here's a challenge: For one whole day leave everything containing a <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5lYmF0dGVyeS5jb20uYXUvcHJvX3Nob3cucGhwL0xhcHRvcC1iYXR0ZXJpZXMsVE9TSElCQSwxOTA1MTA3MCwxLFNhdGVsbGl0ZS1QMzAwLmh0bWw_" target="_blank">TOSHIBA Satellite P300 battery</a> alone. No driving or riding, no cell phone or computer, completely &quot;battery-bereft&quot;. At the end of the day you'll either feel tranquil and centred, at total peace with your surroundings or a nervous wreck, climbing the walls.

<br />Tablet notebooks are thin notebook computers that are only about the thickness of a paper notebook. These computers are easy to transport, as they are both small and lightweight. Basic maintenance and care should be applied to the tablet notebook, which will provide you with extended use of the item.
<br /><br />Turn off the notebook, and unplug it from any charging device.
<br /><br />Spray a can of air over the keyboard, which will remove loose dust that has settled inside of the keyboard. Start at either the left or right side of the keyboard, then spray to the opposite side. Repeat until you have sprayed the entire keyboard.
<br /><br />Moisten a microfiber cloth with rubbing alcohol, then use it to safely clean the entire notebook. Rub the damp cloth over the notebook screen, wiping in long, even strokes. This will remove smudges and fingerprints without harming the screen.
<br /><br />Wipe the moist cloth over the keyboard as well as the exterior of the notebook.
<br /><br />Dip a cotton swab into the rubbing alcohol, then wipe between the keys of the keyboard. This will allow you to reach areas that the cloth missed.
<br /><br />Always use your computer on a flat, sturdy surface. This will prevent tipping and accidents that could cause the notebook to fall, break or crack.

Novero, known for making expensive Bluetooth headsets, just rolled out a combination Windows 7/Android laptop/tablet. I spent some time with this strange hybrid here at MWC.
<br /><span class="textAlign textAlignCenter"><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/171150401_2517966_48233836.jpg" /></span>
<br />The Novero Solana is a glossy, piano-black laptop with silver trim that weighs 2.8 pounds. Flip up the 9.7-inch, 1024-by-768 screen to reveal a keyboard with full-sized black keys and it reveals a small, rather greasy trackpad. The laptop runs a touch-enabled version of Windows 7, and I could touch the screen or use the trackpad interchangeably. The capacitive touchscreen was very responsive.
<br /><br />Now here comes the weird part. Push on the screen and it literally twirls in its magnesium frame. Woah! You can flip the screen all the way around, close it over the keyboard and use it as a convertible tablet. Convertible tablets are nothing new, of course, but most of their screens twist and fold rather than twirling freely within a frame. It's quite a sight.
<br /><br />The Solana's info screen showed a 2.9 Windows Experience Index, running an Intel Atom N2600 at 1.6GHz on 2GB of RAM. There's a 32-128GB SSD for storage. OS was Windows 7 Home Premium, 32-bit, and the laptop will be compatible with Windows 8. Other specs include a 3-megapixel camera, two USB ports, an HDMI out and a MicroSD memory card slot. It connects to the Internet with Wi-Fi 802.11n (with Intel's WiDi) and AT&amp;T-compatible HSPA+ 21. The tablet runs for about four hours in Windows mode on its 32 watt-hour battery, Novero told me.
<br /><br />I opened PowerPoint to browse through Novero's marketing deck. The Solana is about as responsive as my Samsung N310 netbook–that is to say, it isn't fast, but it'll get the job done.
<br /><br />I double-tapped an icon on the Solana's screen to reboot in Android mode. The tablet restarted, showed some Linux code on the screen, and then popped into Android 2.3. I swiped the screen to unlock and launched a Solitaire game. I could play the Solitaire game, but I couldn't get out; the home button doesn't work on Android yet, a Novero rep said apologetically as he turned the device off.
<br /><br />That said, I can't really see the point of the Android mode. Maybe it really extends battery life; Novero wouldn't say at the booth. Android is certainly more touch-friendly than Windows 7, but it isn't more touch-friendly than Windows 8, and Android on Intel x86 has some application incompatibility issues.

Although neither of these metal items are pure copper and zinc they have enough copper and zinc on their surfaces to work, and they are readily available items anyone can find.
<br /><br />Simply insert the penny and drywall anchor into the lemon as shown. These become your positive and negative terminals.
<br /><br />When hooked to a volt meter, as shown, the cell measures 0.4V. What is happening is a chemical reaction at the copper along with a chemical reaction with the zinc in the lemon acid. So there are 2 reactions working together and each one is called a “half reaction”. Each set of metals in electrolyte (lemon juice in this example) is a single cell. As long as the lemon is in one piece, we have 1 battery cell.
<br /><span class="textAlign textAlignCenter"><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/171150401_9903846_48247933.jpg" /></span>
<br />Although the lemon battery shows voltage the current is far to low to support even the simplest current demands. To find out how to increase the current to be able to power for example a light bulb, or what chemical reactions are happening inside the cell, keep reading. If however, all you want to do is make a lemon cell, you can stop reading.
<br /><br />Here are the reactions in a lemon cell:
<br />With the zinc: Zn ? Zn2+ + 2 e-
<br />At the copper: 2H++ 2e- ? H2
<br /><br />What we want a [url=]Compaq 367759-001 battery[/url] to do is have electrons to flow through a wire from which we can utilize to power things. In each of the reactions in the lemon cell, the e-minus indicates electrons that are removed from the zinc to make a zinc ion and these electrons go over to the copper where they take hydrogen ions and make dihydrogen. All chemical cells work in a similar way. Other metals and electrolytes can be used, but one half of the half reactions will create an ion and the other half will reduce an ion. In our lemon cell these ions will be flowing through the electrolyte (the lemon's acid) while the electrons are flowing through the wire on our voltmeter. It happens spontaneously if the circuit is complete but the reaction stops almost completely when ions cannot be made because no electrons are flowing through the wire.
<br /><br />Thus, any chemical reaction creating an ion that can be coupled via ion transfer with another reaction that reduces an ion can create a battery cell. The potential difference in the ion creation/ion reduction determines the amount of power the cell will have. Dissimilar metals are ideal for this, and there are also some other non-metal materials that can do the same thing. That’s why there are a number of different kinds of battery cells. Each cell has different reactions which have different properties; so we can apply the right properties as required to get the job done.
<br /><br />You don’t see too many copper-zinc-lemon acid batteries in the world actually powering anything. So let’s look at our lemon cell again. What properties does it have that we would want to use it in our test? It’s got common materials that are easy to get and put together. That’s it. Well, actually that and it makes a lovely twist in an after-test refreshment (remove the metal parts for best results). But a lemon cell doesn’t deliver a lot of current, and the voltage is rather low compared to other [url=]Compaq 383493-001 battery[/url] cells even when it is at its maximum possible voltage. In fact, if you look around the internet you’ll find a number of people that made lemon cells with voltages higher than 0.4V. Many of them got 0.8V or higher. Looking at the possible differences in these tests can give us more insight into the world of batteries. So what are they doing that we aren’t?
<br /><br />Maybe they use bigger lemons? No, that's not the reason, and I’ll explain why. We can determine just how high the voltage in a lemon can get. We can even determine the theoretical voltage of any cell by looking at the half reactions and the differences in their potentials. Chemists have made tables with values for different metals and materials. Looking at the tables we can theoretically make a battery cell up to about 6V using different materials. And the highest theoretical voltage for a cell using water based electrolyte is a little over 2V. The theoretical max is about 1.1V for a lemon cell. So that’s the highest possible voltage you’ll see in a lemon cell and factors that affect the voltage will be the purity of the materials, both metals and electrolyte, and placement (construction). Maximizing the reaction is the key to the highest possible voltage. Maximizing the reaction is what the other lemon battery experimenters were doing to get a higher voltage. What we could do to get better voltage is to wait for the materials to settle in and have the greatest surface area available in the reaction, use more pure metals, or perhaps break up the inside of the lemon to get the electrolyte to flow better (or maybe some lemons are better than others).
<br /><br />So doesn’t lemon size matter? If we had a lemon as big as a truck and sheets of pure copper and zinc the size of picture windows, wouldn’t the voltage be even a little higher? Nope; the best you’ll see is still 1.1V. But aren’t there batteries, like <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5iYXR0ZXJ5LWNvbXBhbnkuY29tLmF1L2xhcHRvcC1iYXR0ZXJ5LW1vZGVsLnBocC9kZWxsX1Zvc3RybyszNTAwXzFfNDU0My5odG0_" target="_blank">Dell Vostro 3500 laptop batteries</a> or car batteries that are higher than 6V? There are. That’s the difference between a battery and a cell. If cells are attached to each other in series, their voltages add together. Put those in-series cells together in one container and you have a battery. So if we get 100 lemons and 100 pennies and 100 drywall anchors we could put each cell together in a row, each with ones drywall anchor hooked to the next one’s penny until they are all hooked together, except the first one’s penny and the last one’s drywall anchor. If we check the voltage of this chain at that first penny and last anchor, we could theoretically have 100 x 1.1V, or 110V! Wow, that’s like house plug voltage! Couldn’t that be dangerous? No, not really. Hooking all those lemon cells together adds voltage, but not current. And the current delivered by a lemon battery is tiny, as will be shown in a moment.
<br /><br />There is another way to hook the cells together; in parallel. When we put our 100 cells in a row, but this time hook all the pennies together and all the drywall anchors together the voltage would stay at 1.1V. So what good did all that slicing and poking do if all we get is the same voltage we started with? We got capacity. It’s just a little harder to see. If we ran our lemon cell down, using a device that ran on less than a volt, and measured how much energy we got out of it before it went dead, we could call it “1 lemon worth of energy”. Our 100-lemon battery hooked in parallel would also run that 1 volt device, but now we can run it 100 times as long (all things being equal) extracting all 100 lemons worth of energy. This is, in effect, making a bigger single cell. That truck size lemon may have had only 1V too, but it would run for a very, very long time. But there is something else putting together those lemons in parallel would do for us. Let’s look at an example to demonstrate the power of a parallel connection. Can our lemon battery light a 1V light bulb? A bulb for a Mag Solitaire flashlight (it runs on 1 AAA battery) will glow with 1V, and even a little less. However, even if we get the full 1.1V out of our lemon battery, it won’t do anything at all to Solitaire bulb. The reason is that the battery is pushing enough voltage through the bulb, but the bulb is trying to get more amperage from the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5iYXR0ZXJ5LWNvbXBhbnkuY29tLmF1L2xhcHRvcC1iYXR0ZXJ5LW1vZGVsLnBocC9kZWxsX1Zvc3RybyszNzAwXzFfNDU0My5odG0_" target="_blank">Dell Vostro 3700 battery</a> than it can supply. Another way to say it is “the big hose is full of water, but the water just isn’t moving”. However, with enough lemons in parallel, or with that truck sized lemon, we’ll have no trouble getting that flashlight bulb to light. It’s just a matter of getting enough reaction going to supply the electron needs of a lit bulb.

<br /><br />We run two separate battery tests when we test laptops at CNET Australia — a heavy test, which turns up screen brightness and volume to full and plays back a 720p H.264 video; and a light test, which sets screen brightness to 40 per cent and visits three different websites every 20 seconds until battery exhaustion.
<br /><br />While our database is still building due to introducing these benchmarks in November 2011, we will keep updating this article throughout the year as laptops come in for review, with the eventual aim of splitting the charts into screen sizes. Keep in mind that there's a massive spread here in both size and performance capability — battery isn't the only thing to consider.
