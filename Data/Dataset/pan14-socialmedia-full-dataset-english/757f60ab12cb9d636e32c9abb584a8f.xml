The sad reality is that more and more brides, and grooms as well, do not like the idea that children will be coming over to their weddings. <br /><br />Just the thought of crying children and children messing up with her gown and that of the bride’s maids make several brides throw up. Another sad fact is that some parents are not very sensitive to the issue. They could not think and understand how a bride could dislike cute and loveable kids in her wedding.<br /><br />Wedding etiquette books and guides have it that the best way to exclude children to the occasion is to mention it in the invitations. <br /><br />According to most wedding etiquette books, brides and grooms who dislike kids around their weddings can do two things: one, do not mention kids’ names in the invites; and two, spread the word that children are not wanted in the wedding. <br /><br />The second option can be brutal, but it is nicer than having to control kids’ tantrums and annoying acts during weddings. <br /><br />Because not all people understand and know wedding etiquettes, it is advisable that at some occasions, the couple should be straight forward to inform the guests before hand that the wedding would involve an ‘adult reception.’ <br /><br />Frankly telling parents-guests that kids will not be welcome in the wedding can also be a viable option.  For some, the gesture will not be that polite, but practicality will tell other wise. Every bride and groom wants solemnity for their much- awaited moments. Understand that. <br /><br />Another tactic to exclude children in wedding invitations is to mention the number of seats reserved for a particular guest. For example, Mr and Mrs Winterburg are reserved only two seats at the reception. That means, that Mr and Mrs Winterburg’s five kids do not have places in the wedding. They should know that. <br /><br />If the guests still fall clueless and insist on bringing along their children with them, call them before the wedding and explain why children should not be attending the wedding. Educate them a little about wedding etiquettes. <br /><br />Wedding etiquettes for children’s parents <br /><br />For parents, if it is not mentioned in the wedding invitation that children are not allowed to attend the wedding, and the couple and hosts did not call to emphasize the idea, then it is safe to assume that you could tag along your children. <br /><br />However, be informed and bear in mind the simple wedding etiquettes for parents. You would not want to ruin the wedding just because your kid suddenly threw an act or suddenly threw a tantrum. <br /><br />Assume the position of the bride and the groom. Think of how you would feel if you were on their shoes, and children are creating scenes at your wedding. It would not be pretty and cute, right? <br /><br />Make the initiative to leave your kids at home, if you can help it, when you attend the wedding. They could play around the house or watch the television or do their stuff at home. They might get bored throughout the wedding ceremony and spoil everything.<br /><br />For those helplessly take along children with them on weddings, wedding etiquette experts advise you to make the most of the opportunity. For guests, on how to be good guests and for parents to be good teachers to their kids who are incidentally, also attending the wedding.<br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5oYWtpbXNvbnMuY29tLw__" target="_blank">wedding photographers in pakistan</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5lenppc3R1ZGlvLmNvbS8_" target="_blank">wedding bridal Dresses</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5zdHVkaW85LmNvbS5way8_" target="_blank">wedding photographer Karachi</a>

The destination wedding etiquette is to make sure everything is in order prior to the wedding date itself. Here are a few reminders:<br /><br />·  Check if your wedding location requires other legal documents to process the wedding. The destination wedding etiquette is to arrange the papers beforehand.<br /><br />·  Is there a residency requirement? If so, the destination wedding etiquette is to confirm the number of days required for the couple to stay in that location to make their union legal.<br /><br />·  Medical tests for both parties should be taken. If the couple arrived a few days earlier to the destination, they are open to the risk of getting a disease. It is destination wedding etiquette to have themselves checked out by doctors just to be on the safe side.<br /><br />·  Book everything in advance. Making the proper reservations for the hotel, flowers, gowns, music, etc is a sign of prudent planning and a destination wedding etiquette must.<br /><br />For the guests:<br /><br />The destination wedding etiquette dictates that you must bring a gift for the newlyweds. A bridal registry is usually set-up for the convenience of the couple and the guests. If the couple’s asks for money instead of a gift, discretely give your envelope to the family of the bride or groom. The key word here is discrete. It would be breaking the destination wedding etiquette code if one grandstands and announces their contribution.<br /><br />Usually the invitation allows for at least one companion to the wedding. In tagging along more than one companion, consider the destination wedding etiquette of informing the couple beforehand. This will make it easier for them to estimate the total number of plated for the reception.<br /><br />Bringing along the children is fine for any destination wedding. But as much as possible, keep the event as civilized as possible. The kids will only add to the stress at a wedding and the destination wedding etiquette is to keep the number of children down to a minimum.<br /><br />Guests can turn the out of town wedding into a mini-vacation just by spending their time together at the venue. However, it is essential destination wedding etiquette to put the couple’s day first before going off on your own romantic weekend.<br /><br />If the destination wedding is unfamiliar to you it is wise to do some research. Not only will you be able to discover a new place but also you can really enjoy your mini-vacation by visiting the tourists’ spots. Remember, the destination wedding etiquette is to indulge on this only after the wedding event.<br /><br />For the family:<br /><br />Both the bride and groom’s family are an important part of the wedding. It is a destination wedding etiquette that they all try to help make this event go as smoothly as possible. <br /><br />The couple can delegate their wedding tasks to the family to lessen the pressure on the celebrants. It is only natural that the family steps forward and take in as much responsibility as the can as a destination wedding etiquette.<br /><br />When all the hard work pays off at the wedding, the newlyweds will appreciate everyone for making this the most memorable destination wedding of their lives.<br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5lenppc3R1ZGlvLmNvbS8_" target="_blank">wedding photography in Pakistan</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5oYWtpbXNvbnMuY29tLw__" target="_blank">wedding photographers in pakistan</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5hcXVhc3RvbmVzdHVkaW8uY29tLw__" target="_blank">child photographers in pakistan</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5zdHVkaW85LmNvbS5way8_" target="_blank">wedding photographers Pakistan</a>

Evening weddings have increased popularity over time. <br /><br />People see weddings, especially receptions as a perfect time to mingle with old and new friends and generally socialize. However, only few know that several wedding etiquettes do exist for evening weddings.<br /><br />As for almost any issue hounding etiquettes on weddings, you will be surprised how evening wedding etiquettes mainly revolve around the most basic issue and concern on weddings--- attires. <br /><br />For the bride and the groom, it is surprising that not much is expected during evening weddings. Evening weddings, according to several etiquette books and guides, should be treated as if they were daytime wedding. But take note, the case only applies to brides and grooms. <br /><br />Being a nice and good guest, you are expected to follow several practical and unwritten guidelines. You would not want to create a bad impression to people, don’t you? <br /><br />To illustrate the most common dilemma encountered by guests, who really try hard to be good guests, read on for a sample situation that you may have encountered in the past. <br /><br />An evening wedding situation <br /><br />Annie was invited to the wedding of a high school friend. The event poses a lot of excitement to her because she sees it as an opportunity to touch base and catch up with old high school friends. <br /><br />Thus, Annie wants to make sure she will create a good and fashionable impression on that night. She wants to show everyone how she has improved and gotten prettier and foxier over the years. <br /><br />However, one concerning factor about the wedding was that it is an evening wedding. Annie has attended just a couple of evening weddings before, and those were informal events, unlike this forthcoming one. <br /><br />The invitation sent to her clearly and boldly emphasized that the guests are expected to come in formal attire. Ahh, Annie thought. That would be to her advantage. She will more exuberate radiance through a beautifully made gown. <br /><br />The wedding night of her friend turned out to be disaster for Annie. Why? Because with her utmost desire to ‘dress to impress,’ she found that she over did it.<br /><br />Annie wear a very beautiful and radiant fire-engine red gown. The dress accentuated her figure, and no wonder, she was really beautiful. <br /><br />If she was beautiful on her gown, what went wrong? What happened in the evening wedding that made Annie want to run out instantly from the event? <br /><br />Apparently, Annie unintentionally stole the bride’s wedding thunder. Since she came in flaming red and beautiful gown, all eyes were on her during the wedding. Some people, to her dismay, also came to congratulate her, mistakenly identifying her as the bride. <br /><br />It can never be flattering. Not all eyes were smiling to Annie. The bride’s eyes were flaming red, with anger! All the bride’s maids, and almost all the ladies in the ceremony showed those disgusted and unwanting looks to Annie. She thought, she should never have attended that evening wedding.<br /><br />Dress for the occasion <br /><br />Evening wedding invitations that bear the phrase “black tie optional,” indicates that the evening wedding is meant to be a formal gathering and the hosts intend the guests to appear formal. Remember, it should be the bride who should stand out on her much-awaited moment.<br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5kYWlseXN0cmVuZ3RoLm9yZy9wZW9wbGUvMTg4NzI2MS9qb3VybmFs" target="_blank">Bridal</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5naWZ0YW5kaG9tZWNoYW5uZWwuY29tL25vZGUvMTE2ODQz" target="_blank">Bridal</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy53aGVyZXRvZ2V0ZW5nYWdlZC5jb20vYmxvZy9pbmRleC8xNDE4MTkvc2VhcmNoL3NlYXJjaF93b3JkLzY0MzI1NjZiNWE0NzZjNzU1YTc5NDI2OTYzNmQ2YzZiNTk1Nzc3Njc1MjQ4NGE2YzYzMzM0ZTZjNjM3NzNkM2Qv" target="_blank">Bridal</a>

Wedding etiquette dictates, however, that those who are unable to attend should send a congratulatory card for the groom or for both couples or a simple best wishes note to the bride.<br /><br />Gift Giving Cash Wedding Etiquette Fact 2:<br /><br />Cash gifts or any gift items may be sent to the bride or groom's home before the wedding or to the couple's new home one year afterwards. This is a way of guests to lessen the burden to the newlyweds, such as how would they transport heavy gift items. Couple need not worry about renting a truct to transport the gifts to their new home. Also, your cash gift will be a great help to couples within their first year of marriage who are still in the stage of raising their own savings. <br /><br />Gift Giving Cash Wedding Etiquette Fact 3:<br /><br />Giving cash gifts are not a violation of wedding etiquette. Couples need cash as a start up money for them. They need to rent a new apartment, bigger than their bachelor pad, if any of them has one, buy toiletries and groceries for the two of them, buy appliances and furniture that the two of them needs. These are just few among the many expenses that a couple would face in the first few months of their marriage which is why gift giving cash is a good idea to do and does not violate any wedding etiquette.<br /><br />Gift Giving Cash Wedding Etiquette Fact 4:<br /><br />So how much should you give if you decide to give the couple cash as a gift?<br /><br />It is a horrible idea that the amount or price of one’s wedding gift should equate to what the couples had spent on your dinner at the wedding reception. It is untrue. You can give as much as you want and as less as you want, if your budget is really tight. But in gift giving cash wedding etiquette, a guest's transportation does not count as a cash gift to the couple. <br /><br />Gift Giving Cash Wedding Etiquette Fact 5:<br /><br />Also, don't stop yourself from giving cash gifts if the couple has listed their preferred wedding gifts in registry. Buying gifts from the wedding registry list are optional; you can either give the couple the gift of their choice or don't.<br /><br />So, the gift giving cash wedding etiquette fact # 5 is that you can give cash gifts eventhough the couples have a wedding registry.<br /><br />Here are gift giving cash wedding etiquette for couples:<br /><br />Wedding registries are gaining popularity these days. But there are limitations on how much the bride and groom may direct gift giving. Gift giving cash is a wedding etiquette violation. You should not tell your guests that you prefer cash than gift items or request donations in cash to pay up a mortgage or ask them to give you cash to fund your honeymoon or that gift giving cash is preferred because you will send the money to charity.<br /><br />Whether you like it or don't asking for gift giving in cash will make you look greedy, even if you claim that the money will go to charity. <br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5nb29kcmVhZHMuY29tL2V2ZW50L3Nob3cvNTQ0MDY0LXdlZGRpbmctcGhvdG9ncmFwaHk_" target="_blank">wedding photography</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3dlZGRpbmdwaG90b2dyYXBoZXJzcGFraXN0YW41Ny53b3JkcHJlc3MuY29tLzIwMTIvMDcvMTUvd2VkZGluZy1waG90b2dyYXBoeS8_" target="_blank">wedding photography</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5saXZlbG9nY2l0eS5jb20vdXNlcnMvcGFya3lpbG1hejYxNi8_" target="_blank">wedding photography</a>

For a beach wedding, brides can now wear turquoise or aquamarine colored wedding dress to match the color of the dress with the aqua-blue freshness of the sea waters.<br /><br />* On Wedding Shoes<br /><br />Miss Manners says Wedding Etiquette allows brides to wear open toed and ankle strap wedding shoes. According to the modern Miss Manners too, white is not anymore the basic color for wedding shoes. You can go with beige, creme, ivory or even red to match an ultra white wedding gown. <br /><br />Miss Manners says that shoes should be comfortable and stylish. Rhinestones are good and does not defy Wedding Etiquette. But for the sake of taste, Miss Manners recommends that brides should go for less ornamented shoes.<br /><br />* On Announcing the Engagement<br /><br />Miss Manners says that first time brides may announce their engagement in newspapers or if they have the fortune to host an engagement ball, then they can announce the engagement in the said party. If you do not have the money to throw an engagement party, Miss Manners says that you can announce your engagement to close family and friends during a dinner.<br /><br />For second wedding, Miss Manners recommend to brides with second marriage to talk to their children first before making the public announcement. Then the next person that they should talk to is their parents before the ex-spouse. Miss Manners says that a bride, who does not have any child from her ex-spouse, fails to tell her ex about her engagement does not violate a Wedding Etiquette. According to Miss Manners, the bride have no obligation to her ex-spouse unless they have a children of which they have joint custody.<br /><br />* On Who to Invite<br /><br />Miss Manners says that it is the bride and the groom and the host (in case the parents will co-host the wedding) has the say on who are or who are not to invite. But the last say, for Wedding Etiquette's sake, is always upon the lips of the bride and the groom since it is their big day and it is them who are the center of attention.<br /><br />If the bride or the groom don't prefer to invite an ex-boyfriend who is one of the best employee of the bride's father, then the bride's father cannot command her daughter to invite the old flame even if it is the bride's father who have hosted the wedding.<br /><br />* On Wedding Registry and Cash Gifts<br /><br />Miss Manners says no to Cash Gifts. Asking for cash gifts is a Wedding Etiquette blunder. Miss Manners says that asking for cash gifts makes the bride and groom look greedy. Even if the couples want to donate the cash gifts to charity, Miss Manners is still against for couple who will plead for cash gifts. Better put up an online registry and tell your guests, through your wedding invitation that a registry is currently online for those who wish to give the couple gifts under the couple's wishlists.<br /><br />This way, according to Miss Manners, Wedding Etiquette is preserved and you won't look too pushy to your guests.<br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5saXZlbG9nY2l0eS5jb20vdXNlcnMvcGFya3lpbG1hejYxNi8_" target="_blank">Wedding</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5ibG9naW9uLmNvbS8/cT1ub2RlLzEzMjkxMg__" target="_blank">Wedding</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3Bhcmt5aWxtYXo2MTYuamlnc3kuY29tL2VudHJpZXMvZ2VuZXJhbC93ZWRkaW5n" target="_blank">Wedding</a>

Also do remember to include on the top of your checklist, &quot;choosing a perfect wedding ring.&quot;<br /><br />Selecting a wedding ring is not as easy as it looks.  It requires much thought, too.  After all, it is the wedding band that binds the couple together and will be worn by the bride and groom for their entire married life, and therefore must be something that they would not get tired of wearing.<br /><br />Most important when choosing a wedding ring set is to decide on a budget. The couple should consider how much they could afford to spend for the wedding rings.  Based on this budget that the couple have in mind, decide on the material they want their wedding bands to be made of.<br /><br />The materials from which wedding rings can be made of have evolved through the years.  However, the most popular are still those made from classic 14K or 18K yellow gold.  Gold rings remain to be very popular both for wedding and engagement.<br /><br />Wedding rings made from white gold are also gaining popularity, it being very stylish-looking and exuding a very modern aura.  Also, white gold goes well with other silver and platinum jewelry, as well as with most clothing fabric.<br /><br />Platinum being one of the hardest metals is also a very suitable material for a wedding ring.  For one, it is very durable and therefore will endure wear and tear for a very long time.  Platinum wedding rings may also be a symbol for enduring love that is if couple wanted a romantic twist in picking a wedding ring.  Platinum rings looking very similar with rings made of white gold looks very stylish and elegant.  However, platinum wedding rings are the most expensive, but if the couple considers the fact that it is something that will last them a lifetime, then the cost probably would not really matter. <br /><br />Titanium is a popular material especially for wedding rings for men.  It is light, long lasting, and is not as expensive as platinum.  Titanium wedding rings are similar to white gold rings in appearance.  The only different is that titanium wedding rings are so light you can hardly feel it when worn on your finger.<br /><br />As for the wedding ring style to choose, there are the traditional plain bands, the more elaborate ones with beaded edges.  There are also the modern designs of two-tone wedding bands.  The Celtic wedding rings engraved with ancient knot work are also hot these days.  Solitaire rings with a precious stone are also classic designs for wedding bands.<br /><br />Often times, the bride may want to match her wedding ring with the engagement ring.  Of course, this is also something that has to be taken into consideration, especially is she wants to wear both rings on the same hand.<br /><br />In choosing for a wedding ring, foremost consider your budget and then decide on the material.  Also, having to wear your wedding bands for a really long time, it is also worth considering choosing something that would best work with your clothes and the other jewelry you usually wear. Above all, choose a wedding ring that you will be most comfortable in wearing.<br /><br />Good luck on your wedding ring shopping!<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5zdHVkaW85LmNvbS5way8_" target="_blank">wedding photographers in pakistan</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5oYWtpbXNvbnMuY29tLw__" target="_blank">wedding photographer Islamabad</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5hcXVhc3RvbmVzdHVkaW8uY29tLw__" target="_blank">wedding photographer  Lahore</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5lenppc3R1ZGlvLmNvbS8_" target="_blank">Pakistani bridal photography</a>

Modern-day weddings can now also take place in the Internet (what is known as &quot;Online Wedding).<br /><br />From the bride's march down the aisle to the wedding reception, there are a number of wedding traditions and aspects that make a wedding ceremony special. It is important that the couple 'include' their guests and the people around them in the celebration by guiding and informing them of what is happening at any given time. This is made possible by wedding ceremony programs.<br /><br />A wedding program (also called church programs, ceremony programs, or &quot;The Order of Woship&quot<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/wink.gif" alt=":)" /> is a personalized guidebook for the guests in a wedding. Essentially similar to that of a program at a theater play, wedding programs serve the following purposes:<br /><br />They serve as a record of the wedding ceremony, providing guests with the order and details of the events that will happen in the ceremony.<br /><br />· They help guests understand what is happening, making them feel included.<br /><br />· They introduce and honor the bridal party, the sponsors, and the other people who are participating in the ceremony.<br /><br />· They serve as a beautiful and sentimental souvenir for everyone, which can be included in the couple's scrapbook.<br /><br />While a wedding program is not a strict requirement to have, but it certainly adds a unique and personal touch to any wedding ceremony. A wedding program can also be essential in the following cases:<br /><br />· A wedding that is inter-cultural and no one understands the ceremony.<br /><br />· A wedding with a number of guests from another faith or culture.<br /><br />· A wedding so large that guests may not know the bridal party.<br /><br />· A wedding that is particularly long and time-consuming.<br /><br />· A wedding that involves so many people that the couple would like to thank and pay tribute to.<br /><br />A wedding program is generally broken down into 3 sections, with the additional detailed information listed below:<br /><br />1. Introduction<br /><br />· Names of the couple<br /><br />· Wedding date<br /><br />· Time and place of the service.<br /><br />2. Event or Ceremony Order<br /><br />· Greetings<br /><br />· Poetry<br /><br />· Reading<br /><br />· Exchange of vows<br /><br />· Explanations of special religiuos rituals (such as the ring ceremony, unity candle ceremony, and pronouncement of marriage)<br /><br />· Titles of the ceremony music to be played (including the names of the musicians, soloists, or readers)<br /><br />3. Acknowledgement or Wedding Party<br /><br />· Names of the members of the bridal party<br /><br />· Name of the priest or officiant who will perform the ceremony<br /><br />· Memorials, tributes or homages to someone who has passed away<br /><br />· Thank-you notes and dedications to the parents and to people who gave support to the couple (and to the wedding)<br /><br />· The couple's special message to their wedding guests<br /><br />· Directions to the reception<br /><br />Wedding programs are usually ordered from the same printer who does the wedding invitations. Other couples, however, opt to do their wedding programs on their own - it gives a couple a chance to be more flexible and creative while saving money.<br /><br />Wedding programs are one of the little details that make such a big day extra special. Ordered ready-made or done personally, a wedding program can be made unique by the expressive feelings of love and joy that it conveys.<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5zdHVkaW85LmNvbS5way8_" target="_blank">wedding photographers Pakistan</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5oYWtpbXNvbnMuY29tLw__" target="_blank">best wedding photographers in karachi</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5hcXVhc3RvbmVzdHVkaW8uY29tLw__" target="_blank">wedding photographers Pakistan</a>

In fact, most of the wedding invitations tend to be some sort of family reunions because the family members get together once again.<br /><br />And because there are tons of relatives present in the celebration, the bride or the groom will not notice, who you are or where did you come from. So, it would be better to pretend as a long lost relative.<br /><br />Best of all, you could extend the drama if you have a beautifully gift-wrapped package with you. Who could resist somebody who was known as Uncle Clemence’s long lost son and now he has come back (with your personality, of course).<br /><br />2. Try being a staff member of the wedding caterer or wedding coordinator.<br /><br />In order to be able to crash into a wedding, you could always pretend to be a staff member of something.<br /><br />In a wedding, there are lots of people being hired in the planning and preparation. So, one way of crashing into the scene is to pretend that you are a staff member of the catering company or the flower arrangements.<br /><br />It is just a matter of drama and actions. After all, you would want to eat a very nice meal, right?<br /><br />3. If somebody asks you who you are, you could always say you are a friend of somebody who is also at the party.<br /><br />Pick the name of your choice. You can always find someone else’s name when you are being asked why you are at the party or who is with you right now.<br /><br />This is a safe tactic if you do not feel like choosing whose side of the couple will you take in order to introduce yourself. Besides, with this strategy, you can be pretty sure that with over a hundred or 200 guests in the party, who would dare verify that the name you have chosen really exists.<br /><br />4. Dress to kill.<br /><br />The best part of being a wedding crasher is to dress up a little bit in order to suit the occasion. Even if it means that you were “dressed to kill,” it would be better to dress appropriately in order to fit in the event.<br /><br />After all, wedding crashing is not all about free food and wines. It can also be one way of finding the love of your life.<br /><br />5. Timing is an essence.<br /><br />One of the most important things one should remember when crashing into the party is to show up really late. This is because by the time you have arrived, everybody has started drinking, socializing, and getting so much into the details of the wedding that their defenses become relatively low.<br /><br />So, when you arrived at the wedding, no one will surely notice your arrival, so, you can easily slip in and join the party.<br /><br />Indeed, wedding crashers can be very unethical people to love with. But then again, some of these people are also worth your time and money because of the company that they can give to your other guests.<br /><br />After all, for wedding crashers, life is, indeed, worth partying out that is why it is a great idea to attend to a party or wedding even if you are not invited.<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5oYWtpbXNvbnMuY29tLw__" target="_blank">wedding bridal Dresses</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5hcXVhc3RvbmVzdHVkaW8uY29tLw__" target="_blank">wedding photographers in pakistan</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5lenppc3R1ZGlvLmNvbS8_" target="_blank">child photographers in pakistan</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5zdHVkaW85LmNvbS5way8_" target="_blank">child photographers  in karachi</a>

It is, after all, where you will receive and treat your friends and relatives in probably the most memorable night of your life. <br /><br />Here are some tips to help you search for that perfect wedding venue. <br /><br />Trust your instincts. As soon as you arrive in a particular venue you will automatically have a certain feeling towards it. You have to trust your instinct. If you feel a certain positive vibration to the venue then that’s a good start. In the same way, you will know automatically if a certain venue is not right for you and your wedding. This doesn’t mean though that you should not be logical in choosing a wedding venue. It’s the place where you will exchange vows with the man you love so it has to feel right.  <br /><br />Take your time. Don’t ever rush in choosing the perfect wedding venue. A wedding is a very important event so take time to get the venue right. Ideally, you should start looking for a venue at least a year before the wedding date. This would give you enough time to make the right decisions and change the venue in case anything happens. <br /><br />Consider the size.  The size of the venue is a very important consideration. If the venue is too small, the wedding will loose its intimacy. If it’s too big, it will be cramped and uncomfortable. The size of your wedding will depend of course on the number of your guests. So before looking for a wedding you must at least have a rough idea of how many guests you will be planning to invite. Be as precise as possible. You cannot say that you’re planning to invite from 200 to 500 guests. The 300 person difference would matter a lot in terms of the venue size. You must also leave ample space for the dance area. The more guests you have, the larger space you need to allot for the dance area. <br /><br />Check the parking space.  One of the complaints of people who have attended weddings is the lack of parking space. Be sure that the wedding venue you will choose has ample space for all of your guests. Parking may be a minor consideration but it can spell the difference between a happy guest and a dissatisfied one.  <br /><br />Know the restrictions of the venue.  Be sure to ask about the restrictions of a wedding venue if there are any. There may be restrictions about noise so you might not be able to employ a band or even a sound system. Some venues have time restrictions while some would allow you to party all night long. There are even venues with decorations restrictions. Check if the wedding venue would allow you to bring your own caterer, florist, decorator, etc because there are venues that have preferred contractors and suppliers.   <br /><br />Draw a layout of your wedding. Have a layout of your wedding. Before choosing a wedding venue, you must already have a layout (either on your mind or drawn into paper) of your wedding. You must know where you want gusts to sit, the reception area, the dining area, etc. Then check if the venue fits your layout.<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5zdHVkaW85LmNvbS5way8_" target="_blank">wedding photographers in karachi</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5oYWtpbXNvbnMuY29tLw__" target="_blank">professional wedding photographer in Pakistan</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5lenppc3R1ZGlvLmNvbS8_" target="_blank">wedding photographers in pakistan</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5hcXVhc3RvbmVzdHVkaW8uY29tLw__" target="_blank">est kids photography in karachi</a>

How About a Private Yach<br/><br/>The chartering of a private is a unique, but romantic way to have the wedding of your dreams.<br /><br />Before examining the reasons why chartering a private yacht may be perfect for your wedding, it is first important to examine exactly what it is.  In a way, the chartering of a private yacht is also compared to the chartering of a private airplane.  You are essentially paying to rent that airplane for a specific period of time. The only difference is that you are often given a trained crew, like a pilot or a sailing captain.  Yachts are chartered anywhere from a few hours to a few weeks!  If you decide to charter a private yacht, how long you choose to do so will all depend on your preference and the charter reservations that have already been made.<br /><br />Now that you know exactly what the chartering of a private yacht entails, you may be wondering exactly why it would make a good destination for your wedding.  One of those reasons is the yacht itself.  Although yachts come in different sizes, shapes, and styles, almost all are considered luxurious.  The reason for this is being everything that can be found onboard.  In addition to a large deck, yachts often have larges, spacious cabins; spacious cabins that tend to include bedrooms, bathrooms, kitchens, and eating areas.  <br /><br />Another one of the many reasons why a private yacht would be the perfect destination for your wedding is because of your choices. In all honesty, the choices that you will have will all depend on the yacht chartering company that you choose to do business with. Despite the possibilities of a variance, it is not uncommon for couples to get married aboard a yacht when it is still docked at a port, but many also choose to get married on the water, when the yacht is actually sailing.  Whichever method you choose to go with, you will likely be pleased with your decision to do so, namely because of the beautiful scenery or backdrop.  <br /><br />Although many individuals view the cost of chartering a private yacht to be expensive, it might not have to be for your wedding. It is no secret that wedding are expensive.  If you are looking to have your wedding at a beautiful, elegant, well-known venue, there is a good chance that you could end up paying hundreds or even thousands of dollars to so. This cost can easily be compared to the chartering of a private yacht.  In fact, you may even find the chartering of a private yacht to be more affordable than having a wedding in or around your hometown!  <br /><br />In conjunction with the above mentioned cost, it is also important to mention the honeymoon. You may be able to save yourself a considerable amount of money by chartering a private yacht for your wedding, as well as your honeymoon.  It is not uncommon for couples to have small private wedding ceremonies aboard a private yacht and then depart on their honeymoon!  If you haven’t started planning your wedding yet, there is a good chance that you haven’t started planning your honeymoon either.  The chartering of a private yacht may be something to seriously consider.  <br />Good luck on your wedding ring shopping!<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5oYWtpbXNvbnMuY29tLw__" target="_blank">wedding photography in karachi</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5zdHVkaW85LmNvbS5way8_" target="_blank">wedding photographers in karachi</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5lenppc3R1ZGlvLmNvbS8_" target="_blank">child photographers in pakistan</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5hcXVhc3RvbmVzdHVkaW8uY29tLw__" target="_blank">kids photography in karachi</a>

		<document id="b44cce7181dfaa48c536d2b93057b16a" url=""><![CDATA[Outdoor Wedding Reception Activities<br/><br/>You can plan games and activities based on the outdoor theme and carry that theme indoors if part of the reception is inside as well.<br /><br />Depending on where the reception will be held, you can plan many activities based on the setting. Whether it is the park or on a farm, there are a myriad of activities you can plan.<br /><br />Let's start with some basics based on popular wedding locations. One fun game for a winery wedding is a blindfolded wine tasting game. If the bride and groom are wine drinkers, this might not a game the bride and groom should be a part of, but instead guests and wedding party members. Blindfold perhaps a half dozen volunteers and have them do a blind taste test (provide something to clean the palate between sips). The volunteers should guess which wine is the pinot noir, which is the Cabernet, and so on. A bottle of wine is the obvious prize for the winner of this game.<br /><br />Say you are having a reception at a country club on a golf course. It's possible your theme will include golf elements, so why not include golf in some reception activities or games? You certainly could head to the golf course for a &quot;hole in one&quot; contest, or have a driving contest to see which guest has the best stroke. As a simple, &quot;who gets the centerpiece game&quot;, you could have people guess how many golf balls there are in the floral centerpiece (which could decorate a plain large glass vase filled with flowers). Similarly, there could be a large vase or other clear container filled with golf balls at the reception somewhere and guests could guess how many golf balls are in the vase.<br /><br />A silly game could be made on the dance floor by asking everyone to include their best golf swing into their dancing for one particular song.<br /><br />Now, if your reception and ceremony are both to be held outdoors and guests will be milling outdoors, think about games or activities that can take place outdoors and still keep to your level of formality or informality. For example, if the reception is being held at a park, perhaps guests might enjoy a &quot;walk down memory lane&quot;. Prior to the reception, someone can use potted plants or arbors to create a little private lane, which guests can walk through. Along the path, guests will find pictures of the bride and groom at various stages in their lives. There should be a place for guests to record their thoughts and memories along the way as well.<br /><br />If your wedding and reception are fairly casual, you can always tell guests ahead of time to prepare for a ball game or some other fun outdoor activity. Women can bring a pair of sneakers. Just imagine the fun photos you'll get out of a rousing game of football or baseball played by women in dresses and sneakers and men in suits and sneakers!<br /><br />You can provide a challenge activity involving barefoot dancing in the grass or a Frisbee toss in the backyard. Is there a pool in the yard where the reception will be held? Why not have a swimming activity for after the whole of the reception is done?<br /><br />!<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5lenppc3R1ZGlvLmNvbS8_" target="_blank">wedding photographer Islamabad</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5hcXVhc3RvbmVzdHVkaW8uY29tLw__" target="_blank">wedding photography in Pakistan</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5zdHVkaW85LmNvbS5way8_" target="_blank">wedding bridal Dresses</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5oYWtpbXNvbnMuY29tLw__" target="_blank">best wedding photographers in karachi</a>
