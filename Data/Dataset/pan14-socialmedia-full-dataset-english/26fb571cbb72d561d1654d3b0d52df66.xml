<br />There’s no blood
<br />There’s no alibi
<br />‘Cause I’ve drawn regret
<br />From the truth
<br />Of a thousand lies
<br /><br />[Pre-Chorus:]
<br />So let mercy come
<br />And wash away
<br />What I’ve done
<br /><br />[Chorus:]
<br />I'll face myself
<br />To cross out what i’ve become
<br />Erase myself
<br />And let go of what i’ve done
<br /><br />Put to rest
<br />What you thought of me
<br />While I clean this slate
<br />With the hands of uncertainty
<br /><br />[Pre-Chorus]
<br /><br />[Chorus]
<br /><br />For what I’ve done
<br />I start again
<br />And whatever pain may come
<br />Today this ends
<br />I’m forgiving what I’ve done!!!
<br /><br />[Chorus]
<br /><br />What I’ve done
<br />Forgiving what I’ve done

<br /><br />There's another world inside of me
<br />That you may never see
<br />There're secrets in this life
<br />That I can't hide
<br />Somewhere in this darkness
<br />There's a light that I can't find
<br />Maybe it's too far away...
<br />Or maybe I'm just blind...
<br /><br />Or maybe I'm just blind...
<br /><br />[Chorus]
<br />So hold me when I'm here
<br />Right me when I'm wrong
<br />Hold me when I'm scared
<br />And love me when I'm gone
<br />Everything I am
<br />And everything in me
<br />Wants to be the one
<br />You wanted me to be
<br />I'll never let you down
<br />Even if I could
<br />I'd give up everything
<br />If only for your good
<br />So hold me when I'm here
<br />Right me when I'm wrong
<br />You can hold me when I'm scared
<br />You won't always be there
<br />So love me when I'm gone
<br /><br />Love me when I'm gone...
<br /><br />When your education X-Ray
<br />Cannot see under my skin
<br />I won't tell you a damn thing
<br />That I could not tell my friends
<br />Roaming through this darkness
<br />I'm alive but I'm alone
<br />Part of me is fighting this
<br />But part of me is gone
<br /><br />[Chorus]
<br /><br />Or maybe I'm just blind...
<br /><br />[Chorus]
<br /><br />Love me when I'm gone...
<br /><br />Love me when I'm gone
<br />When I'm Gone
<br />When I'm Gone
<br />When I'm Gone

<br />It's kinda hard to talk right now.
<br />Honey why are you crying? Is everything okay?
<br />I gotta whisper 'cause I can't be too loud
<br /><br />Well, my girl's in the next room
<br />Sometimes I wish she was you
<br />I guess we never really moved on
<br />It's really good to hear your voice saying my name
<br />It sounds so sweet
<br />Coming from the lips of an angel
<br />Hearing those words it makes me weak
<br /><br />And I never wanna say goodbye
<br />But girl you make it hard to be faithful
<br />With the lips of an angel
<br /><br />It's funny that you're calling me tonight
<br />And, yes, I've dreamt of you too
<br />And does he know you're talking to me
<br />Will it start a fight
<br />No I don't think she has a clue
<br /><br />Well my girl's in the next room
<br />Sometimes I wish she was you
<br />I guess we never really moved on
<br />It's really good to hear your voice saying my name
<br />It sounds so sweet
<br />Coming from the lips of an angel
<br />Hearing those words it makes me weak
<br /><br />And I never wanna say goodbye
<br />But girl you make it hard to be faithful

<br />Just don't understand where we went wrong
<br />I gave you my heart
<br />I gave you my soul
<br />I gave you...
<br /><br />As a matter of fact I was the one who said I love you first
<br />It was about eight years ago, don't act like you don't know
<br />We were sittin' at home in your mama's livin' room
<br />Cause, we couldn't be alone
<br />See your mama knew I was something else, she knew how I felt
<br />Back then we were in school; and that's your favourite excuse
<br />Growin' up I was a fool; and I can't lie I'm missing you
<br />Listen and don't trip
<br />I think I need a bottle with a genie in it
<br />Here's my wish list
<br /><br />First one, I would create a heart changing love
<br />Second one, I'll take yours and fill it all up
<br />Third one, but I don’t need a lot of wishes cause I’ll be okay if I get one
<br /><br />If I had one wish, we would be best friends
<br />Love would never end, it would just begin
<br />If I had one wish, you would be my boo
<br />Promise to love you, trust me I'll trust you
<br />If I had one wish, we would run away
<br />Making love all day, have us a baby
<br />If I had one wish, I’d make you my whole life
<br />And you’d be my wife, make it right this time
<br /><br />If I had one wish
<br />One wish, one wish, one wish
<br />One wish, one wish, one wish
<br />One wish, one wish, one wish
<br />One wish, one wish, one wish
<br /><br />Now tell me is this the only way I can get you right back in
<br />If so then searchin' I’ll go, then I can have you for sho
<br />Then you’ll be loving me, holding me, kissing me
<br />So girl don’t tell me what I’m feeling is make believe
<br />I swear if I lose a second chance with you
<br />I wouldn’t know what to do
<br />I’d probably check myself into some kind of clinic
<br />I couldn’t be alone because without you I’m sick
<br />Here’s my wish list
<br /><br />First one, I would create a heart changing love
<br />Second one, I'll take yours and fill it all up
<br />Third one, but I don’t need a lot of wishes cause I’ll be okay if I get one
<br /><br />If I had one wish, we would be best friends
<br />Love would never end, it would just begin
<br />If I had one wish, you would be my boo
<br />Promise to love you, trust me I'll trust you
<br />If I had one wish, we would run away
<br />Making love all day, have us a baby
<br />If I had one wish, I’d make you my whole life
<br />And you’d be my wife, make it right this time
<br />If I had one wish
<br /><br />I don’t even know how we ended upon this road
<br />And, even though we are grown, Girl I just want you to know
<br /><br />If I had one wish, we would be best friends
<br />Love would never end, it would just begin
<br />If I had one wish, you would be my boo
<br />Promise to love you, trust me I'll trust you
<br />If I had one wish, we would run away
<br />Making love all day, have us a baby
<br />If I had one wish, I’d make you my whole life
<br />And you’d be my wife, make it right this time

<br />I've watched you fly on paper wings halfway around the world
<br />Until they burned up in the atmosphere and sent you spiraling down
<br />landing somewhere far from here with no one else around
<br />to catch you falling down
<br />and I'm looking at you now
<br /><br />and I can't tell if you're laughing
<br />between each smile there's a tear in your eye
<br />there's a train leaving town in an hour
<br />it's not waiting for you, and neither am I
<br /><br />&quot;Swing for the fences, son&quot; he must have told you once
<br />but that was a conversation you took nothing from
<br />so raise your glass now, lets celebrate exactly what you've done
<br />just put off another day of knowing where you're from
<br />you can catch up with yourself if you run...
<br /><br />and I can't tell if you're laughing
<br />between each smile there's a tear in your eye
<br />there's a train leaving town in an hour
<br />it's not waiting for you, and neither am I
<br /><br />is this the life that you lead,
<br />or the life that's lead for you?
<br />will you take the road that's been laid out before you?
<br />will we cross paths somewhere else tonight? 
<br />somewhere else tonight...
<br /><br />and I can't tell if you're laughing
<br />between each smile there's a tear in your eye
<br />there's a train leaving town in an hour
<br />it's not waiting for you, and neither am I

<br />Fall has come
<br />Blue skies turning grey
<br />Like my love
<br /><br />I tried to carry you
<br />And make you whole
<br />But it was never enough
<br />I must go
<br /><br />[Chorus:]
<br />Who is gonna save you
<br />When I'm gone?
<br />And who'll watch over you
<br />When I'm gone?
<br /><br />You say you care for me
<br />But hide it well
<br />How can you love someone
<br />And not yourself?
<br /><br />[Chorus]
<br /><br />And when I'm gone
<br />Who will break your fall?
<br />Who will you blame?
<br /><br />I can't go on
<br />And let you lose it all
<br />It's more than I can take
<br />Who'll ease your pain?
<br />Ease your pain
<br /><br />[Chorus:]
<br />And Love is gonna save you
<br />When I'm gone.
<br />And I'll watch over you.
<br />And I will give you strength
<br />When you're not strong.
<br />Who'll watch over you,
<br />When I've gone away?
<br /><br />Snow is on the ground
<br />Winters come
<br />You long to hear my voice
<br />But I'm long gone
