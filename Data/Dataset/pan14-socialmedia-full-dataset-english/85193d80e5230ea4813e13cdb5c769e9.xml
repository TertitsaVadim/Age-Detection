<br />and cannot detect
<br />my emotions as they appear.
<br />I wish i could disappear,
<br />never to hurt anyone again.
<br />Tears stain,
<br />my tired eyes.
<br />I ask myself why 
<br /><br />Lost with nowhere to go
<br />self-esteem kept way too low.
<br />for now the shadows
<br />guard my weary soul.
<br /><br />The pain's too much to bare
<br />my heart cannot take much more wear.
<br />This is the cry of a torn heart.
<br /><br />Despair, misery and lonliness
<br />are the emotions i confess
<br />that run my life.

<br />with many desicions to make, 
<br />unable to sleep
<br />trying not to weep.
<br /><br />I don't shed a single tear,
<br />for fear someone will hear.
<br />These thoughts are binding my mind,
<br />which are ones I cannot unwind.
<br /><br />Now a days I'm always on edge,
<br />for I fear someone will shove me off the ledge
<br />and I'll slowly fall into the dark abyss,
<br />into emotions i cannot supress.
<br /><br />My story is unfinished
<br />already longer than most
<br />filled with drama and sorrow,
<br />I cannot escape the shadow
<br />to find my true identity
<br />I'll be searching for all eternity.

<br />each tear meant to replace 
<br />the words i cannot say
<br />for i do not wish to stay in this cruel world anymore 
<br /><br />My eyes now red and swollen 
<br />do not come close in comparison to my broken 
<br />heart which is now in a million shreds 
<br />and it fills me with dread to think 
<br />it will never be complete again 
<br /><br />Bang! goes the gun i mentally 
<br />hold to my head wishing it was really 
<br />there so i might have a chance to finalize
<br /> this never ending nightmare until i realize
<br />that this will be my sweet surrender 
<br />until im gone forever
