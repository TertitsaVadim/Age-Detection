<br />Where my broken soul can mend
<br />Here I stand, there’s nothing in my way
<br />So I put my faith in you
<br />I will give my all to you
<br />My heart has at last learned to dance
<br />In Your Hands
<br /><br />In Your Hands
<br />I know that I am home
<br />And I’ll never be alone
<br />All that I am, is in your hands

<br />Living like this?
<br />Who'd think I'd get this far,
<br />Fancy house and my fancy car.
<br />Why you living like this,
<br />Together as kids?
<br />You were my best of friend,
<br />All the trouble you got up in.
<br /><br />[Bridge:]
<br />See I been deaf, and I been scared,
<br />I been discriminated against and compared,
<br />To you whose my brother, thanks to you I discovered.
<br />There's only one way to go in life and that's be right.
<br /><br />[Chorus:]
<br />There's only one way to do right, right, right, right,
<br />There's only one way to do right, right, right, right,
<br />See me, I aint always done right, right, right, right,
<br />That's why I'm here to help you fight, fight, to do right.
<br /><br />[Verse 2:]
<br />You were the queen in my future,
<br />I was the one you was used to,
<br />It was like we were one,
<br />Up under the sun.
<br />And narcotics in your system,
<br />The love I should have unlisted,
<br />Now look what we've become,
<br />But I shouldn't judge.
<br /><br />[Bridge:]
<br />See I been deaf, and I been scared,
<br />I been discriminated against and compared,
<br />To you whose my mother, now through you I discovered.
<br />There's only one way to go in life and that's be right.

<br />There's only one way to do right, right, right, right,
<br />There's only one way to do right, right, right, right,
<br />See me, I aint always done right, right, right, right,
<br />That's why I'm here to help you fight, fight, to do right.
<br /><br />[Verse 3:]
<br />Cause in life there are decisions to make but it's your choice,
<br />But I chose to walk away, rather than wildin out, and get locked away.
<br />See my friends all chose the fast money, but I chose my Father.
<br />Cause I knew he'd come for me and recover me, already dead.
<br />See what I'm trying to say, is I'm trying to be the best man I could be.
<br />And when I see you too, struggling to do the best you can do.
<br />You may run into a rock, but you can't let it stop what's planned for you,
<br />So make the right choice.
<br /><br />[Chorus X 2:]
<br />There's only one way to do right, right, right, right,
<br />There's only one way to do right, right, right, right,
<br />See me, I aint always done right, right, right, right,
<br />That's why I'm here to help you fight, fight, to do right

<br />On top of the word you see picture of us
<br />We don’t need, we don’t need de-fini-tion
<br />We don’t need de-fini-tion
<br /><br />We shop, we dine, spend cuddle time
<br />Come over but only on invitation
<br />Not now, in time, we're border line
<br />I like you but don’t quit your occupation
<br />My heart, my ace but just in case
<br />Lets stay open to other situations
<br />Why tell you we gonna be more 
<br />Keep you on a leash for 
<br />I don’t wanna string you along, girl
<br /><br />Bridge
<br /><br />Chorus
<br /><br />Girl
<br />Even though we used to the titles and getting made
<br />But maybe this time we should just leave this one alone
<br />(Cause) if this working for us, then its working for us
<br />Don’t Go messing it up (Don’t go messing it up)
<br /><br />Even though we used to the titles and getting made
<br />But maybe this time we should just leave this one alone
<br />(Cause) if this working for us, then its working for us
<br />Don’t Go messing it up (Don’t go messing it up)
<br /><br />Chorus X2

<br />because they dont have the flatest tummy, because they have curves. Nobody's body is ever perfect. 
<br />You dont need the flatest tummy to be amazing, its ok to have a curvey body i think its better then being a stick. 
<br />Girls let things go to there head which affects them more then anyone realises.. 
<br />Dont hate yourself because your not like the girls in the magazines, 
<br />heck half of them aint even that thin, and when they are its sickly thin. 
<br /><br />'Love who you are, love what you have, because someday someone will'..
<br /><br />&amp; You cant be loved by someone unless you love yourself <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" />).. which means loving your body, any shape any size.
<br /><br />Own what you have and be proud, If your to insecure to walk around in swimmers, 
<br />dont let that show and its better seeing someone walking around happy and enjoying what they have, 
<br />then seeing someone so insecure and hiding behind a towel, behind boardshorts. 
<br />Its beautiful to see a girl with a bit of meat on her and being proud of it while showing the world what she has. 
<br />Makes me smile anyways <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" />  
<br /><br />I know what its like for people to bring you down about your body, 
<br />which makes you not want to eat, not want to wear shorts, 
<br />not want to even expose your body.  Fuck that, 
<br />I say dont listen its the easiest thing to do. 
<br />And take a look at them, i garentee there not 100%t happy with what they have for a body. 
<br />Its cruel for one to not even be game enough to leave the house because a friend has said someone negative, 
<br />Girls really need to wake up to themselves and think before you speak cause you could ruin someones life.
<br /><br />Yes i use to be chubby<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" />) I never had any worries about my body. 
<br />It basically didnt even cross my mind cause there was so much more to life then having a chubby body. 
<br /><br />Then little remarks even so called jokes from friends, family and strangers got to me. 
<br />I was stupid enought to let it affect me and it did hard. I stopped eating, 
<br />i stopped taking food to school and stopped buying food. I thought no body would realise, 
<br />But they did. Did not only affect me emotionally but alot of other people aswell. 
<br />I lost a great amount of weight in a few weeks and it was not healthy, 
<br />even though i thought it was great. I soon realised it wasn't, 
<br />thats not the right way to do that. Its not at all a fun thing to go through. 
<br />I soon then had a Huge wake up call, if i  had let it continue more then it did then gosh knows what would have happen. 
<br />And im so happy and greatfull that all stopped.
<br /><br />Next time you go to say a negative thought about your friend or anybody in that case, 
<br />realise you could kill that person and its not funny nore pretty..
<br /><br />Its not a bad thing to love cakes, mcdonalds, coke anything like that. 
<br />Its just the amount you eat and how you burn it off. 
<br />I dont eat perfect but i do drink alot of water and im pretty much addicted and thats all i drink. 
<br />Try it, not going to do you bad. Next time you go to have a drink of coke, 
<br />drink the water instead and in no time you'll love it like i do <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" />) water is really good for the body.
<br /><br />They dont just make size 6's in everything, there is size 8,10,12,14,16,18,20. 
<br />Which means its okay to be the size you are, its okay if your not a size 8. 
<br />You still just as beautiful as someone who is size 6.
<br /><br />Im not saying it is okay to eat bad all day everyday for the rest of your life. 
<br />You will turn really unhealthy, Though it is okay for you to love your sweets, 
<br />love your fatty foods, aslong as your going to either go for a jog or run after it. 
<br />Or your going to be on your feet all day at work or going to the gym. 
<br />But dont wonder why when your not doing anything about it and then see your putting on weight.

<br />they all seemed to be about trying to become the person you want to be or the person your meant to be rather. 
<br />how your actions effect others more than you can realise in the heat of the moment. 
<br />about trying to get to a state where your clear headed enough to make good decisions about your life and your relationships. 
<br />me and trev talked about how if your life was over now. 
<br />how would you feel about the person youve been? 
<br />what would people remember about you? 
<br />does it matter how cool you really are in the eyes of others if you cant leave a good imprint on this world. 
<br />then whats the point? 
<br /><br />i think that in this life. doing what you love matters most. 
<br />sharing life with the good people that are around you right now is a way of getting the most out of the life 
<br />youve been given. not to say that those good people wont come and go. 
<br />but letting every experience shared and personal teach you something new. 
<br />ive learned so far that the bad things that happen are meant to teach us so much about the people we are. 
<br /><br />Lately i cant understand how anyone gets to the point of wanting life to be over. 
<br />the thing i want most is to live a great life. a life that wasnt wasted. 
<br />a life that has uncountable happy memories not that im niave 
<br />enough to think bad things wont happen but im not content to dwell on them to make them bigger 
<br />thoughts then they deserve to be in my subconscious.
<br /><br />i wrote a letter to myself last year right when we were finishing school and &quot;starting life&quot; 
<br />in a book that belongs to my friend. i re read it a couple of months ago. 
<br />probably the most sereal thing that you could do. 
<br />write your feelings at that exact moment on paper and read it months later. 
<br />makes you realise how fast life changes and how much happens in a year or a few months. 
<br />it kinda shows you that you cant take anything for granted. not your friends or your family or anything you have.
