<br />After disclosure of the media, the British Police - Scotland Yard confirmed recently before they really lend an already &quot;retired&quot; police horse &quot;Leisha&quot; to Brooks, and stressed that this is not a gift given to her. Brooks not the others, she was the News of the World &quot;and the tabloid&quot; The Sun &quot;editor in chief, once one of the two newspaper behind the boss of Murdoch's most important aides, resigned after the scandal broke, and was arrested. The ordinary man, this approach reflects a good relationship with the British media and the police. Exposed hands of Murdoch's media had to bribe the police to obtain the exclusive source of a scandal, this approach becomes complicated.

<br />The media also revealed that the husband of Prime Minister Cameron and Brooks had ridden the horse, among explore the horses. The latter is a racing coach, addicted to horses, such as life. However, Cameron and Brooks's husband is old school in Eton when he was studying together to explore the horse by the common riding may not be surprising. Therefore, Cameron also inadvertently involved in the police Mafeng Bo, the media jokes that this is British politics horsegate scandal.

<br />Media &quot;horse gate&quot; scandal, Cameron to take immediate measures to cope with his approach at the EU summit in Brussels, Belgium initiative to meet with the media, held an &quot;extra&quot; in a press conference. He told the reporters say, on the last few days, &quot;he have a final explanation with this horse photos, he is willing to express sincere apology.
<br /><br />Cameron said that people feel the unexpected in this press conference: &quot;I know Mr. Brooks Charlie Brooks has 30 years, he is my good friend, old school, but also in the neighborhood of my constituency, we a place to live only a few miles apart. &quot;
<br /><br />He said: &quot;In fact, since after the election (May 2010), we are no together to ride a horse. Before the election, yes, I did have with him riding, he has a lot of horse, which one is Police Ma Leisha.

<br />Cameron also said: &quot;It was learned later that Leisha had passed away, I regret very much I would like to own near future should not go back to the saddle, but to concentrate on doing his job.&quot; Finally, Cameron still laughing said it was impossible because of the scandal resigned.
<br />&lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.lisseurghdfrance.net%26quot%3B%26gt%3B%26lt%3Bb%26gt%3BLisseur"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.lisseurghdfrance.net&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lisseur</a> Ghd&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
<br />Cameron initiative admits the practice is clearly wished to quell the storm. However, in the English folk, the people do not think so.

<br />British political commentators have pointed out, this incident reflects two major problems, First, Cameron and Rupert Murdoch under the control of the media has an extraordinary relationship, and these media precisely exposed, such as wiretapping, bribery and other many The scandal; Cameron &quot;near rich&quot; approach with its launch of the austerity programs to reduce the social welfare in stark contrast.

<br />Temu also said that the ancient mummy looks quite dry, it is because then people think that the body was completely dehydrated is the best way to preserve the corpse; &quot;and the other way around. We believe that the corpse fully wet is the best way to preserve. &quot; 
<br /><br />&quot;This is why, by the bodies we deal with, it seems like the dead yesterday, even after thousands of years, such an effect.&quot;

<br />Why mummified? 
<br /><br />WASHINGTON The ancient Egyptians believed in reincarnation, so they are the body made of easy-to-preserved mummy, so have the opportunity to receive eternal life. The practice of the ancient mummies, including the wine and the Nile water to wash corpses in order to show the pure, then took out his the hepatopulmonary intestines and stomach, but leaving the heart, heart and eternal life is closely related to. 
<br /><br />The bodies of salt then cover the air-dried for about 40 days. Then, the body is again to be cleaned, then cover the oil to maintain skin elasticity. Then smear with sesame oil, wrap high quality linen. The ancient Egyptians believed the corpse to wear neat clothing, you can begin to cycle to the next life. 
<br /><br />Costs thousands of pounds to help the development of cloning technology 
<br /><br />WASHINGTON However, the the Bodhisattva door company offers mummification services valuable. Production of a cat mummy to spend Â£ 3,600 Â£ 15,000, the dog will have. Human mummies to spend about Â£ 40,000. 
<br /><br />Temu said: &quot;Our customers all over the world. For example, if in the UK, a pet just died, the owner want it mummified, then we will vet the dog's body wrap, plus ice immediately airlifted to the United States. &quot; 
<br /><br />Temu said that some customers really willing to put their dead pets mummified, stay at home.&quot; Sometimes even small animals, such as a mouse or a bird.&quot; 
<br /><br />&quot;The most amazing thing is that these animals after we deal with, look just like they just died of some animal mummies have been tested, few years later, they still remain in perfect condition.&quot; 
<br /><br />In addition to the animals, Sa door has been successfully produced a number of human mummies. However, these mummies opened in the 18 months after completion of the production inspection. According to Utah law, these mummies must be incinerated after being opened. Now, however, have a lot of people signed a contract with Sa door to be mummified after death. &quot;We have many customers have signed up, some of them signed when 34-year-old, fifties and sixties, so we have a lot of work to do.&quot; 
<br /><br />Sa door company believes that their technology has great significance for the development of cloning technology. In the future, by way of drilling, penetration coffin to extract DNA from the mummy inside. 
<br /><br />&quot;The ability to preserve the bodies, so that there is a need to extract DNA, which for many people is a very attractive approach. A lot of people hope that they can also be cloned.&quot;

<br />Harvard - Smithsonian Astrophysical Center (Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics) of astronomers using the Hubble Space Telescope in 2009 found that this &quot;super Earth&quot;, and named GJ1214b. Now can confirm that the planet is a &quot;water world&quot;, surrounded by the thick layer of water vapor. Astronomer Zach Leibel tower(ZachoryBerta,), said: &quot;GJ1214b known planet with us are different, its mostly made of water.&quot; Scientists have speculated that the planet millions of years ago may nurture life.

<br />GJ1214b the diameter is 2.7 times that of Earth, but the quality is seven times that of the Earth. It revolves around a red dwarf star rotation, from the distance of the red dwarf star70 times the distance between the Earth and the Sun, it is estimated that the temperature above 232 degrees Celsius. Be estimated on the of GJ1214b quality volume and density, the researchers believe that the amount of water on it to contain more than the Earth but less rock. Bertha said, of GJ1214b the internal structure may be completely different with the Earth, the high temperature and pressure may allow where the formation of many different substances, such as hot ice or super fluid water. &quot;

<br />Canadian shale found the fossils of prehistoric animals of a shape like the eel, by scientists as the oldest known human ancestor. Such animals are called &quot;Pikaia gracilens&quot;, a length of 5 cm, can glide to survive dating back 505 million years ago, is the oldest life forms of the original spinal cord.

<br />The Pikaia gracilens vertebrate ancestors, but also including the immediate ancestor of all chordates, including fish, birds, reptiles, amphibians and mammals. Save the Pikaia gracilens wreckage fossils are found in the Canadian shale. About 100 years ago, the American paleontologist Charles Duri ter Val Cote d'discovered the fossils. He believes that animals should be in the fossil is an early form of leeches or earthworms.

<br />As the Pikaia gracilens it seems a long primitive notochord, scientists believe they should be a chordate. (Notochord is a flexible rod-shaped structure, constitutes the spine of vertebrates.), However, did not grow fully mature spine, Pikaia gracilens should be classified in which a species is still unknown.

<br />University of Cambridge, UK and Canadian scientists on 114 samples were analyzed, and eventually found the skeletal muscle tissue called the sarcomere. This finding can eliminate some of the scientists the Pikaia gracilens is the most primitive chordates suspicion of this conclusion. Simon Conway Morris, lead author of the research paper said: &quot;The sarcomere is our long been looking for evidence. The sarcomere nerve cord, notochord, and vascular system found Pikaia is the most primitive chordates on Earth.&quot;research papers published in the journal of the Review of Biology.

Their head is small, with two tentacles, they are also long a thin dorsal fin, but no eyes.

Some experts say that this solar storm is part of the 11-year solar activity cycle.The solar activity is expected to achieve the cycle peak in the next year.
<br />&lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.polo-ralphlaurens.net%26quot%3B%26gt%3B%26lt%3Bb%26gt%3Bralph"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.polo-ralphlaurens.net&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;ralph</a> lauren&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
<br />Solar activity &quot;trilogy&quot;
<br /><br />It is understood that the solar activity on the 6th night. Some researchers say that the solar activity, the release of the material just as soap bubble in space, larger, about 6.4 million kilometers per hour toward the Earth. The United States Aeronautics and Space Administration said the solar storms affect the Earth is expected to be in Greenwich Mean Time at 5:25 on the 8th, before and after the error of each seven hours last until the morning of the 9th.
<br />&lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.polo-ralphlaurens.net%26quot%3B%26gt%3B%26lt%3Bb%26gt%3Bpolo"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.polo-ralphlaurens.net&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;polo</a> ralph lauren&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
<br />U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Space Weather researcher Joseph Kunqie Si, told Reuters reporters that the solar activity in three phases. First, the flare, the release of subatomic particles to nearly the speed of light, after a few minutes to reach Earth, may cause the interruption of a terrestrial radio; Subsequently, the solar radiation reaching the Earth may give air traffic operation of the satellites and astronauts spacewalk bring obstacles; final stage is the coronal mass ejections, external release of some substances in the solar atmosphere, and slow movement.
<br /><br />&quot;Gift&quot; and &quot;test&quot;
<br /><br />NASA said the solar storms on the Earth may be involved in many aspects, both good and bad.

<br />Of North America, the storm will bring northern lights, is expected to peak in the evening of the 8th, the coverage may be extended south to the United States. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) space weather researchers Kunqie Si Northern Lights &quot;may be a gift from solar eruptions.

<br />However, the adverse effects of solar storms on the Earth is involved in many aspects.Generally speaking, three ways solar storms affect the Earth's technology products, including magnetic field, radio and radiation. However, this special solar storms, three kinds of effects may be relatively strong. The solar storms may reduce the accuracy of global positioning system, caused by communication barriers and enhance the polar regions of the radiation levels. The satellite has been operating the same may be affected.

<br />Kunqie Si said a new wave of the coming wave of the sun after the storm. Some researchers say that the strong activity from the last time the sun has been the past 10 years, many new technology emerged. With the solar activity is more frequent, strong, these new technologies will be tested.

<br />This achievement marks the scientific community to complete the biological classification of &quot;human subjects&quot;, including humans, all four genome sequencing. In taxonomy, the man belongs to the Primates Hominidae, genus Chi race. Analysis showed that the separation of the earliest and Human orangutans, isolated in about 14 million years ago, about 97% of the genome and human similarity; followed by the gorilla separated about 10 million years ago, about the Genome and the human similarity 98%;latest separation chimpanzees, the time at about 600 million years ago, its genome with the most similar to human, the similarity of up to 99%.

<br />One of the authors, the Sanger Institute Dr. Xue Yali said, this study not only help clarify the above-mentioned human evolutionary history, but also found some other depth research value. For example, people think that long-term evolution of the hearing is inextricably linked with human-specific language behavior, but this study found that gorillas and hearing-related genes experience similar to the speed of evolution and human, but the gorillas can not speak, so the hearing gene behind the evolutionary driving force may need to rethink.

Ushakov, Putin's foreign affairs assistant, former ambassador to the United States revealed that the telephone conversation is informal, very rich, a total of 20 minutes.
<br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wb2xvLXJhbHBobGF1cmVucy5uZXQ_" target="_blank">ralph lauren</a>
<br />Ushakov, said the call, Obama wants US-Russian bilateral relations in recent years has been a positive trend has been further strengthened, and made clear their willingness To do this in close cooperation with Russian President-elect. Putin expressed his thanks at the same time that Russian-US relations have made significant progress, and stressed that the Russian-US cooperation to safeguard world security is of great significance, especially in the current volatile situation in this sense is particularly prominent.
<br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wb2xvLXJhbHBobGF1cmVucy5uZXQ_" target="_blank">polo ralph laurens</a>
<br />Ushakov also said in a telephone conversation, both sides expressed their willingness to Russia and the United States top-level meeting held in the near future, and stressed that before the formal meeting of the two to keep in touch. Obama pointed out, must be kept before the meeting of two presidents, assistant and expert-level contacts in order to better preparation for this meeting. Obama says it hopes to expand bilateral contacts with the Russian president-elect, especially the exchanges in the economic field and international issues.
<br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wb2xvLXJhbHBobGF1cmVucy5uZXQ_" target="_blank"><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.polo-ralphlaurens.net"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.polo-ralphlaurens.net</a></a>
<br />The reporter noted, is worth pondering is that Putin and Obama have pointed out that in this call during the campaign between the two countries have had sharp criticism of each other's words and deeds, but only a fierce campaign of a practice and shall not affect the rapid development of Russian-US relations. Putin on the phone also particularly wish Obama to win the U.S. presidential campaign, Obama expressed his thanks.
<br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5saXNzZXVyZ2hkZnJhbmNlLm5ldA__" target="_blank">GHD</a>
<br />Carefully to find In fact, when Russia selected Commission announced on March 5 the statistical results of more than 99 percent of the vote, Putin had clinches win the presidential election. Subsequently, the message from the leaders, a congratulatory letter after another. Americans Putin was elected position was &quot;not lukewarm not fire, leisurely&quot;. On the 5th, has been &quot;particularly concerned about the Russian election, the U.S. State Department issued a statement saying the United States is ready to cooperate with the Russian president-elect ready, but this statement makes no mention of Putin. The statement only Once the voting results was confirmed, was elected president sworn in, the United States looks forward to cooperate with, put an &quot;love ride ignore&quot; look. Statement also apparent seriousness, said: &quot;Russia's presidential election to partisan use of government resources as well as election day violations of procedural misconduct, the Russian government should have launched an independent, credible investigation until after the Russian official election final results, the United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was &quot;shy&quot; to say that America is willing to cooperate with the elected Russian President Vladimir Putin.

<br />In Russia selected Committee, announced on March 7 the statistical results showed that 100 percent of the vote Putin to win two days after Obama called Putin congratulated. This is a &quot;belated&quot; congratulations, it seems, is &quot;no alternative&quot; to congratulate the Russian media on this ridicule Obama is &quot;the last to congratulate Putin was elected a foreign head of state&quot;. However, Russia has a proverb: better late than never. Interestingly, Putin actually wish in their own candidates, who do everything possible to &quot;trouble&quot; Obama re-election success, and pledged its agreed to strengthen contacts.
<br /><br />Analysts here pointed out, open a &quot;new chapter&quot; of the two personal relationship through this &quot;informal talk&quot;, Obama and Putin. Obama the U.S. president took office in January 20, 2009, Putin has to finish eight years of President and then became the Russian Prime Minister. Therefore, since the White House after Obama has been mainly dealing and maple combination of President Medvedev, President Putin has yet to truly play against.
<br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5saXNzZXVyZ2hkZnJhbmNlLm5ldA__" target="_blank"><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.lisseurghdfrance.net"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.lisseurghdfrance.net</a></a>
<br />Perhaps not quite understand, perhaps because too understanding, and open evaluation of the Obama Putin has been very kind. For example, on July 2, 2009, the Obama media reporters before the first visit to Russia soon met with Putin publicly said that Putin is &quot;deep into the Cold War affect&quot;, which he described Putin one foot in the old routine, one foot in the new way &quot;, said Putin's&quot; need to look ahead. Putin immediately retorted: &quot;We will not split a large fork only firmly upright, we always look forward, this is the characteristics of Russia, which has been promoting the power of Russia's forward.&quot;
<br /><br />With Putin's return to the Kremlin, Obama had to bite the bullet and direct exchanges with Putin, Obama is not a small test. From Putin's position in the call can be seen, older Obama, 11-year-old Putin is not with Obama care about those who can not get on the table a little trick, but behave very generous calm . To this end, Obama specifically said in the call, hope the G-8 Summit held in May this year at Camp David in honor of Vladimir Putin.
<br /><br />According to Russia's &quot;Kommersant&quot; on March 11 quoted sources as saying the White House, Putin can not refuse the invitation of Obama, the U.S. government learned that Putin was elected Russian president's final message, a resolute decision this year G-8 summit held by the Chicago diverted to Camp David. Previously, in order to save costs, the United States originally planned NATO summit and the G8 summit in May this year in Chicago, with sets of open, but because of the serious differences of views of Russia and the United States on the ABM issue, the Russian president has yet to indicate whether they attend in the North about during the summit held in Russia - NATO summit. &quot;
<br /><br />Analysts here pointed out, objectively speaking, Putin re-return to the Kremlin, whether they are internal affairs or foreign policy are not &quot;radical changes&quot; will maintain its continuity, steady adjustments and changes. On the diplomatic front, Putin will be more pragmatic. In fact, Putin has never been anti-Westernism, a lot of media that Putin is anti-Western, anti-Americanism, it was not Putin's true thoughts, the United States and Europe media, intentionally or unintentionally misread Putin.
<br /><br />The first eight years of President Vladimir Putin, he has been committed to improve the relationship between Russia and the United States and Western countries, Russia and the Western world on the basis of equality to establish mutual trust. &quot;9.11&quot;, Putin's response quickly, the first one had a telephone conversation with the then U.S. President George W. Bush expressed support for the United States. Putin's sincerity and did not return for the equality of the United States and the Western world, this had Putin criticized the United States is &quot;Comrade wolf,&quot; the famous Munich speech in March 2007.
<br /><br />After assumption of the Russian President, Dmitry Medvedev, maple combination &quot;Medvedev&quot; good karma &quot;in the Western politicians and media, outstretched to catch Obama&quot; olive branch &quot;successfully&quot; reboot &quot;due in 2008 grid-Russia conflict in August &quot;crash&quot; of Russian-US relations, the Russian-US relations with a trough.
<br /><br />Now, Putin's return to the general trend has been fixed. Regardless of the future president of the United States, Putin has been successfully elected as the President of Russia in the next six years. If Obama can re-election, then Obama will only deal with Putin the.
<br /><br />Analysts pointed out that Obama take the initiative to Putin phone is not the protocol on the &quot;muddle through&quot;, but after careful consideration of prudence. Because, if the first few months of Obama on the sidelines Putin the Russian presidential election, then a few months after Putin on the sidelines, Obama to participate in the U.S. presidential campaign. Domestic election dust settles, Putin compared with an uncertain future in the next general election Barack Obama, of course, Putin is more calm, Obama is more disturbed.
<br /><br />For the successful re-election, Obama must keep the US-Russian relations &quot;restart&quot; the hard-won achievements, because this is the diplomatic sphere, in that term one of the few &quot;political achievements&quot;. However, if US-Russian relations do not &quot;fall short&quot;, Obama must treat each other good words with Putin. Putin's presidential election win, but the hardships of his own heart knows best. Better development of national economy in the coming term, the country's economic development and create a more favorable external environment, which Putin can not avoid relations with the U.S.. Shouting match with the Americans can &quot;vent&quot;, but name calling does not solve the problem, Putin will &quot;homeopathic&quot; the tone of Russian policy towards America from the &quot;election period&quot; to adjust to &quot;normal period&quot;, that is, as long as Americans do not to &quot;Birentaishen&quot; not take the initiative with the United States competing with children &quot;.

<br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wb2xvLXJhbHBobGF1cmVucy5uZXQ_" target="_blank">ralph lauren</a>
<br />The period April 2011 to January 2012, &quot;Food Watch&quot; of 1514 kinds of food for children were tested. The consumer rights organization pointed out that the consumption of children's food is basically impossible to achieve a balanced diet, these foods most of the sweet side, but also unhealthy.
<br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wb2xvLXJhbHBobGF1cmVucy5uZXQ_" target="_blank">polo ralph laurens</a>
<br />Children's food production companies hope children early exposure to unhealthy junk food, the reason is simple: operate fruits, vegetables benefited less, and the operation of junk food and soft drinks profit quite good. Many companies are claiming is committed to promoting a balanced diet of children's food, but in fact for profit purposes, but then these enterprises as possible to be more interested in selling unhealthy food. Fruits and vegetables less than 5% profit margin, sweets, drinks and snacks can bring more than 15% of the profit margin. Such high profits, one of the reasons is that the production of these food additives such as spices, starch, and so is relatively cheap. Such as snacks, although unhealthy, but people can eat at any time, in between the two meals.
<br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wb2xvLXJhbHBobGF1cmVucy5uZXQ_" target="_blank"><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.polo-ralphlaurens.net"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.polo-ralphlaurens.net</a></a>
<br />&quot;Food Watch&quot; also believes that the proliferation of unhealthy food for children also bear some responsibility. Government should strive to create a children's food advertising environment for primary schools and kindergartens. In addition, federal, state and local governments should try to avoid cooperation with the food-processing enterprises.
