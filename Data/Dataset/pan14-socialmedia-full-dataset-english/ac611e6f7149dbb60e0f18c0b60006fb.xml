<br /><br />Because you live 
<br />Staring out at the rain with a heavy heart 
<br />It's the end of the world in my mind 
<br />Then your voice pulls me back like a wake up call 
<br />I've been looking for the answer 
<br />Somewhere 
<br />I couldn't see that it was right there 
<br />But now I know what I didn't know 
<br /><br />Because you live and breathe 
<br />Because you make me believe in myself when nobody else can help 
<br />Because you live, girl 
<br />My world has twice as many stars in the sky 
<br /><br />It's alright, I survived, I'm alive again 
<br />Cuz of you, made it through every storm 
<br />What is life, what's the use if you're killed inside 
<br />I'm so glad I found an angel 
<br />Someone 
<br />Who was there when all my hopes fell 
<br />I wanna fly, looking in your eyes 
<br /><br />Because you live and breathe 
<br />Because you make me believe in myself when nobody else can help 
<br />Because you live, girl[You live] 
<br />My world[my world] has twice as many stars in the sky 
<br />Because you live, I live 
<br /><br />Because you live there's a reason why 
<br />I carry on when I lose the fight 
<br />I want to give what you've given me always 
<br /><br />Uâ€™re the music in me 
<br />You are the music in me 
<br />You know the words 
<br />Once upon a time Make you listen? 
<br />There's a reason.

<br />i knwo u dont need any bad memories, thats the fact i became
<br />still cant sleep from yesterday
<br />it was a hard night, running in the streets after 2 am crying, shouting with your name
<br />tried to find some thing take me near of you but i didnt , all taxis refused
<br />i wish i could have the much effort enough to make me walk till i reach the masjed near of you
<br />what happend yesterday, u cant understand cause you dont have the same pain
<br />as always i was &amp; i will last, i m a hard worker, very honest in every thing i do whatever i do, all people tell me so
<br />if i laugh, my laugh reachs the sky &amp; make the birds sing &amp; the trees move &amp; the life all turned in a sweet pink colour,
<br />&amp; if i cry, my tears burnning my skin &amp; make the bird scream, &amp; the trees moving in sytrical sorrow moves,
<br />now the sadnees burnning my days , eating my soul, makes my blood boiling in my head, makes my heart back to the old pain that i was afraid to reach some times before, but now i m saying welcome my pain
<br />welcome, increase &amp; increase again &amp; again, may be i reach the rest
<br />the last rest
<br />i dont lose hope but i belive in the fate as ALLAH say( wa kol shay2 kadrnah be kadr).
<br />i know that yu are my fate but i m not a prophet to know how its my fate
<br />i stand by the faith in  ALLAH, may be you will come back a7 my fate will be the hapiness the both lifes, or may be my fate is dying alone with tears n my face till i reach the rest &amp; the happiness after my end between the hands of ALLAH,
<br />I REACH THE FACT THAT MY LIFE IS NOT MUCH TO BE WASTED WAITING FOT YOU
<br />I LOVE YOU

<br />a few past days i wasnt here
<br />i didnt find any body whatever he is could be, care about my attendance or my absence,
<br />who cares
<br />who minds

<br />where is your hearsts, or where is my mind
<br />as usual, to whom i write?
<br />the same answer ;i write to my self may be that decreases the flames inside of me, ahhhhhh its eating me from the flesh to the bones,

<br />i still remmber his eyes &amp; his tall breed, he was one of those good muslim guys that you can see light upon them faces.
<br />these days i recognised the fact of me.
<br />the fact is that all i wished before &amp; dreamed &amp; loved is comming back again
<br />the place i always loved there in masr el-kadima behind el sultan hassan masjed,, 
<br />i always used to walk through the area there, i didnt know that it will be the place i will be there day by day to see the most one i loved all my life &amp; the most one burnt my life,
<br />many many things
<br />evrey time i thaught the mercy will come in such a face, i found my self thrown &amp; neglected even if it a new friend, his friendship didnt last more than a week &amp; left with out a word
<br />seems like my old dream is comming true(there i was thrown on the land &amp; dust all over me &amp; blood come off all my body, 
<br />mother &amp; brother were there just watching me standing,
<br />i tried to cry for them but brother stands with out a word in all silence, 
<br />mother told me that he is going to el set means al saida zainab, may ALLAH blessed her, 
<br />i was so thristy, i noticed a pool of cold water on my left , it was blue &amp; i could hear the water flow rythme, there was a sentence there up on it told that( the one who will drink from this water, will never got thristy forever)
<br />but i didnt drink
<br />i feel afraid

<br />back to write again
<br />from a while not so far, i have started my meditations Ceremonies, 
<br />it took me many many times and much nights to reach any sign that i am on the right way, 
<br />such a very hard painful journey, but it really deserve, 
<br />would i collect my pieces which i have lost through different lifes, 
<br />it started with the insomnia effect, i have spent many days with no moment of sleeping at all, it ate all my power and my daily activities concentration, 
<br />then the bright signs, all were unclear in the first, many nights i have cried much begging to see any simple vision, 
<br />after i saw the shadows, i felt like i have gone crazy in the first, 
<br />the mind was fighting the mind,is that true, have i reached the right path, 
<br />it took me many times trying to contact, many times i failed and i was so disappointed 
<br />i have reached the veiling stage and i have learnt my self how to veil me with the white fabric and cut me off the surrounded aspects of the Physical world we live and i have reached the contact, 
<br />it started so weak and so painful till i found my guidances and they lead me, 
<br />i could hear a rhythme, mix of so many deep weak voices at the first, 
<br />time by time it increased, 
<br />i saw them, i saw my three guidances, comming from a very deep dark from very very far away, from a very ting single point, 
<br />i saw them very clear, 
<br />i have united with them, 
<br />i met my three guidances, all the three were females but not like the human females, 
<br />finally i have reached the right path, 
<br />aspects are different 
<br />i found myself with the common pain that i used to feel in my left arm , there i was laying on my knees and the left arm was bleeding, 
<br />my sword was on the ground, 
<br />some one called cassy was there, she was crying, 
<br />they were standing around me feeling the joy of beating me, 
<br />cassy was screaming, i told you that they are walking on your back , waiting this minute 
<br />i will be back again, 
<br />i am looking to the lines in my hand and i can recognize that it became not much deep, 
<br />do that mean that this the final part of the journey 
<br />would i collect all the past lives pieces before i live 
<br />i miss you ya benty
