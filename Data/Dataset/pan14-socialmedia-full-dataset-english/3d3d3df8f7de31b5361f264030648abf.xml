<br />hahah too much talking of those &quot;fake&quot; stuff..it is quite rediculous..because i bought a fake burberry handbag weeks ago too...hahah...but i really hope that our nation can find out a way out eventually..yeah..let us pray for it...
<br /><br />anyway, after &quot;sightseeing&quot; in GUCCI, we went ahead forward to shoe stores coz juan wanted a pair of sandals..finally she got one at the price of RMB350. OMG! it is someting!!!haha but she really liked it...guess what were we doing after it? we went to Mcdonald..haah it has been quite a long time we have not eaten anything..i miss Uncle Mcdonald..yeah...we ordered a lot..we were so full..hahah..more and more people say NO to Mcdonald and KFC nowadays incluidng foreigners coz they know it is not healthy..me too..hahha..but once in a couple of weeks is ok..hahha.
<br /><br />After shopping, we went to barber's shop--eastern charm. I really recommend this one to you guys here in shenzhen..it is really good..i really like it ..hmmmmmm
<br /><br />judy was at home waiting for us to join the dinner..but we were too full to take anything..haha..TIRED BUT HAPPY <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" />  goodnite guys.

<br /><br />We shared much tonite our interestes in language learning.what i reallly really like in him is that he always insprires me to learn something that i am interested in whenver..he is such a motivated person who always find joy in what he is doing and learning..that is really excellent approach for life i think..so i got pretty motivated as well to learn what i really like..wow i really hope that i could talk with him soon in spanish even i just start from the very scratch...hehehhe.. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/tongue.gif" alt=":)" /> i know if i really put my heart in learning what i like, every effort will pay off eventually..
<br /><br />If friends ever remembered one of the resolutions i have made in the beginning of the new year 2007, you may know how determined i was to learn spanish well...yeah i know it needs much much more determination esp i still need to balance between work and life..E said he has sent me books regarding the learning, but i have not got them yet <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/huh.gif" alt=":)" /> maybe i need to find some myself in the book store recently if i still do not get it..i do not want to waste my time waiting  since you never know what kind of surprise CHINA POST gonna give you...it sucks to many people engaged in China Post service...ewweee..anyway, i really want to finish the primary learning this year and go further to the advanced learning next year..yeah i really plan it and mean it.

<br /><br />Girls like this kind of topics in their gossips..that is true..but we are so surprised to see that even the marriage is witnessed by even the whole world, the marriage still end up with divorce in many cases...how sad..why there is so much UNEXPECTATION in their marriage? me, myself, who knows of and will insist in the marriage commitment to the one who i will marry to as long as he is the right guy i choose to love and live with..why breaking the marriage? isnt it the most beautiful thing in the world? 2 people from the totally different families and even with totally different backgrounds start to love each other...when they feel that they need to be with each other so bad,loving each other, caring and helping, they decide to get married, and then they manage hard to establish a HOME for themselves, bringing up their kids, caring for the old in the families..life is so happy then! i think it is what all people want and expect but sometimes marriage does discourage people when the choice of marriage is unmature, unwise and at the wrong timing..so how can we assure a happy marriage for ourselves???even everything(environment) seems so perfectly ready for accepting and encouraging two lovers to be engaged and then married, marriage itself is not that easy to manage, it requires patience, love, care, comprimise, support and some principles..so it is quite hard for many people to get well with each other after marriage coz of the cultures/habits difference between them...so people start to pick up flaw in each other, using it as a tool to destroy the confidence in each other, starting arguing and fighting...till they find its hard for them to live with each other anymore... they end up getting divorce..
<br /><br />so girls, do not try to get married that soon esp. when you are not sure of the guy you gonna marry and live with. i of told of many sad stories of such kind and really felt bad when they happened..trying to live with each other to see whether life is more beatiful being with him/her or not, to see whether you are more cheerful and joyful when you have someone living with you or not is a good idea..but in such a fast developing society, people simplify many things in order to get quick answer..marriage is not a business, so the principle of &quot;more imput will generate more output&quot; does not apply to it in most circustances..it is the art of life testifying the true love of 2 people to each, learning how to give without the thoughts of any return, how to forgive even it really hurts you, how to support each other when life is not that better off..there are so many things to learn in a marriage..for the people who say they love each other so much before marriage, learning how to still love each other whenever esp in downs is not that easy..
<br /><br />sometimes i really expect the coming of marriage into my life...can i be a good wife then? can i be a good mother to my kids later? can i manage the balance of work and family?...i know it will be of so much fun being with the one i truely love..i am not scared of marriage as some of my friends do coz they worried much about the expense including the house, the education fee for kids and the insurance for the old...is it really that scary? i do not think so! it is such a beautiful and great experience to bring 2 family together, to help each other within these two families or even more  relatives, and then to bring more people into this world, to educate them and give them all your love and attention...hahha isn't it beautiful?
<br /><br />&quot;I DO NOT KNOW WHETHER YOU WANT TO HOLD MY HANDS TO THE END OF THE WORLD ..BUT I WILL, I PROMISE I WILL, LOVE YOU AS MUCH AS THE DAY WHEN I SAID I LOVE YOU.......&quot;

<br />only mom knows how happy i was when i was with him..i told my mom everything..how much i love him and how much he said he wanted me...but today, everyhting seems so unreal..seems so hurtful when i think of those beautiful moments...what is wrong with me? what the hell am i thinking about?

<br /><br />anyway, i washed myself very fast and dressed myself well for work..i felt the sky was so blue and clean today maybe after the shower last night..the weather was nice in the mornig time...i like it!
<br /><br />when i arrived office, i could not believe i made it that punctual, 9:00!!!!OMG!!!anyway, when i started my emailbox, i got some surprises from new customers...wow i was so happy even i could imagine how much stuff i need to finish within today but i still felt that every effort worths...i worked too hard around the schedule to find time to talk with E in the afternoon. he was so funny today coz he did not realize it  was holiday for everybody before he entered his office!!!it was so funny!! he was a funny guy, yeah he always is...so i worked like i did not move from my desk for the whole morning and then the whole afternoon to work out the cases...moreover, the secretary of GM kept pusing me for the artwork of an ad on the manazine for the issure of august...i thought she was so stupid coz june even does not come yet! how could she expect to get the material from me in such a early period? i did not response to her even she kept massenging me saying like cherry can you give me the material now? i think the submission is better done as early as possible!!! i do not like it when i get pushed, truely. anyway, i will not submit it to her on the date she set (6/1)...what i am concerned is the quality, it is not the advanced submission. who cares whether you submit it earlier than the due date or not??
<br /><br />anyway, i finished work around 4:30pm so i got my tea break...i was too frozen on my desk to move..EWEEWW..i really could not move coz my blood stopped moving...GOSH!!!!hahhahha...
<br /><br />i talked to helena today and she said she did not want to work for the company anymore coz it is so mean to her...well, i do not want her to stay there any longer either coz i think she deserves more..what about me? shall i change my job???
<br /><br />when the time of working off comes, i collected all my stuff into my handbag and went out quickly with MP3 earphones on my ears...i always like working hard like this and then work off happily after the hard work..I FEEL SO GOOD! <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" />

		<document id="6d8050f0e5e9a6143a4efb31dae1288d" url=""><![CDATA[Friendship with L<br/><br/>L is a very good friend of mine from university who is a nice girl with great talents in arts and organizing people. besides, she likes to help people out when she feels like she can do something in her ability to help people out whenever and whatever. in addition to her charateristics i appreciated, we came from the same town, which shorten the distance between us thru those years in university. upon graduation, she chose her career in the rural development of guangxi province by engaging herself to educating people from poorer districts. we all thought that she really made a wonderful choice. 
<br /><br />out of many reasons, friends even good friends are not able to spend any time hanging out with each other, laughing at funny things and making funny jokes together. although it has been a while i have not contacted L, i would send her SMS to say hello from time to time. in these 2 years after graduation, L never contacted me or sent any greetings to me. but she did send me several SMS for &quot;HELP&quot;. last year i remembered that she wanted to borrow RMB2000 from me coz she wanted to buy her boyfriend a computer. last month, she sent me several files of the material to be translated for her boss. i spent the whole afternoon to help out. last week, i got a message from her, asking the same help of money. i left her a message, asking her to call me for the confirmation. i felt bad sometimes. in university, things happened the same. she seldom came to visit me in my dorm except she got troubles. and now after school, things did not change. i was always the one that she might think of when she needed help. i did not blame her for anything, to be frank, i was glad that i could help her out most of the time. but to me, real friendship is not only &quot;friends in need is friends indeed.&quot; i expect more from the friendship. why she could not share anything exciting about her life as many of my friends do? i have never got any chance to enter her life in those years, except those difficult times i was with her. when i think of this, i really feel bad....i really cherish the friendship with her and really hope that we can be very intimate friends...but what is true is that i will never be any part of her usual life, just be the one who will be there to help, like the police in the street. no trouble, no police. i know i should have not said those discouraging things here, its like bullshit right??..but i do not think it is fair to me, and i want them to get out of my head right away!
<br /><br />anyway, i really wish the best for her since she is such a nice girl..she have been thru a lot of tough time in her life, great stress from work and life, the passaway of her dad, poor condition of her family and her doomy unknown future. upon those hard times, she set such a brilliant example to people with her approach towards life, optimism, confidence and with great expectation.....i really know she should deserve more than what she has now and really want to help with the best i can offer, but i just hope that i can be thought of as one of her real good friend.
<br /><br />good luck, L....

<br /><br />even the whole nature world has been evolving to such a advanced stage which will never be surpassed by any other ones in the human history in the past millions of years, no matter which spices you belong to, reptile, amphibian, human being, or whatever, the nature of the whole universe stays the same--the needs of being loved and cared and the spontaneous willingness to give love and care to the ones who are closed to our life. since we human beings are much more advanced than monkey and most spices in the whole world in many ways such as thinking and acting, we should have more &quot;advanced&quot; senses and conciousness towards taking the major responsibilites to better the world by stopping poluting our nature, stopping fighting with each other, stopping being so neglected of our worsening environment, stopping living the life like &quot;it is none of your business&quot;, stopping doing anything that apparently or potentially humiliates the advantages of human beings in the  evolution history over other creatures, moreover,we should keep loving people, keep creating a more harmonious society with the rigteous rules and regulations that govern our communities, for you, for me, and for the ones who will come to this world in the next minute.
<br /><br />please pass our love to a further and wider extend, to the ones who live and share with us the whole space called &quot;world&quot;..make it a better home for people all over the world. starting doing it from yourself. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/biggrin.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/biggrin.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/biggrin.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/biggrin.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" />

<br /><br />my temperature ran so high last night!!it was like 39°9 and i simply could not sleep coz i felt cold and hot from time to time..i took the medicines but what the hell was wrong with them??nothing better at all..
<br /><br />nobody wants to suffer this for sure right? so a &quot;are you ok&quot; from people will make me feel so good..i am so grateful for those peoople who was/is/will be there to attend me and care about me whenever i feel sick, so here  i gonna thank my mom, my school mates, helena,elad, judy, and colleagues anita ,lillian and louis....
<br /><br />i can not help recalling moments as below.
<br />Note: i am not a &quot;frequent visitor&quot; to hospital, but i just remember everytime when i was there.
<br /><br />when i was a littlle girl, i got sick so ofen. everytime i got a fever, my mom would take me to the hospital which was miles away with her old bicycle...esp. in the summer season, when there was very sloopy upward slope, she never let me down instead of carrying me hard to go forward . the sun was so strong then, and i put my head on her back and hands around her waist. i could feel that mom got so wet on her back coz she was sweating....even i felt so sick then but i felt so safe and secure because mom was there. she never left her family alone without giving her care when they were sick or in trouble...SHE IS THE GREATEST MOM IN THE WORLD!!!!
<br /><br />when i got older to be a older girl, i got my periods. everytime i have my it, it is so painful! sometimes i would even be in a coma condition if the pains last long. always remember the worrying face of my mom, sometimes she cried when she saw her little girl struggling so hard with the pains..
<br /><br />after leaving home for university, mom started all her worries about my health..she thought like &quot; If there is nobody caring for my little girl, what gonna happen to her????&quot;so everytime she called me on the phone, she would always remind me that i need to get more exercise, and do not eat too much stuff that is not good to my health, etc. but she did not know that i got so many kind friends at school who really helped me a lot..helena is my best friend in university and she cared about me so much...so i told my mom later that she did not need to worry coz i was well taken care of each time..and my dear roomates yangying, zhangyi, wanru, meixiang..they were so great too!!!!!one time when i got my fever so i was too weak and fragile to walk to the hospital, yangying  carried me on her back to the hospital..but because i was so big and heavy, so other girls took turns to carry me on their backs....guess what?? they even could not hold the toothbrush the next morning!!!! really thank you girls!!!
<br /><br />and then i started my work in another city which was further from my home..and there i met wonderful friends and boss as well. CC was my boss who defintely deserves all my compliment and respect. i was so lucky to work with him and we shared so much after work. i was that kind of people who will not get up early and would be late if i spent 1 more minute in bed.. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/tongue.gif" alt=":)" /> so most of the time i would skip my breakfast to be on time to work. i always remembered the &quot;complaints&quot; from CC everytime i was late and even &quot;punished&quot; me with nice bread and milk..he was such a wonderful boss!!! besides CC who always have medicine ready for me when i did not feel well, my roomates, nicole, jessica, selina took good care of me whenever i needed their help..
<br /><br />there was a time when i lived with &quot;strangers&quot; in an apartment and felt so lonely and bad when i really needed care from people. i cried a lot at those moments when i was so alone in the cold room being so sick....but when i moved to live with judy and her family, they were so nice to me..judy came to my room and asked me how i felt from time to time and made banana juice and porriage for me since i had totally lost my appetize..
<br /><br />and, i have the most wonderful boy friend in the world!!! he helps me a lot as well!!thanks, elad.
<br /><br />it is so common that people get sick and will need extra care then. but i feel so special because i got so much love and care from the people who i studied with, worked with and lived with. so everytime i got calls from mom, friends or colleagues asking about how i feel , etc...i will cry out..something deep inside makes me cry i know..and it is called&quot; gratitute&quot;. i realize that connection is so important in our life and  i appreciate so much those love and care from my family, friendship and love..
<br /><br />i am so much stronger now than never before after regular exercises  these years, but still get sick sometimes..haha i guess i need MOREEEEEEEEEEEE EXERCISESSSSSSS!!!!
<br /><br />feeling better now. crying a bit when writing this. wanting to thank all again. wanting to be a greater daughter to mom, greater friend to all my friends, greater partner to my colleagues, and greater lover to my beloved boyfriend.
<br /><br />Take care.

<br /><br />i remember my friend Nick told me before that a person will only know the feeling of joy after he/she has ever gone through some miserable moments. now i understand what it means.after the sickness this time, i realize how lucky i am to be so blessed to have the most WONDERFUL friends, the GREATEST mom and nicest colleagues in the world!!!!
<br /><br />i have stopped complaining already. i really enjoy what i had in the past, what i have for the time being and what will be there for me  in the near future. life is fair to everyone, what makes it different is your own ATTITUTE .

<br /><br />elad said he has found his home over there so that he would not leave there for china. when he said those to me, i felt like 50% possibilities had disappeared and we just got another 50% left. to make it increase to 100%, i told him that i wanted to make a try by going there to see how our destiny goes.
<br />.
<br />I did not know the process can be that complicated after I checked with the visa agency. besides I need to get the proof from the bank that I have enough money to support myself during the stay over there for 3 months, I still need to show the embassy my boyfriend’s tax and wage bills, car, house, and everything that are related to his assets . OMG!!!! The international game is not that FUNNY at all.
<br /><br />I want to talk with him regarding this process before I take any further actions. But it seems that he has been fully occupied these weeks, what I can do now is to wait for when he returns from Denmark.
<br /><br />Lazy mind. Sweet dreams. dreaming about us soon.

<br /><br />sometimes girls are a bit silly..they wish that their boyfriends can remember everything they like, the style of clothes, the food, the tea and their hobbies...so when their boyfriend failed at one or another, they will get &quot;angry&quot; b/c they think their boyfriends do not care about them!!! hahah i did not know i was one of those girls...IT IS SO SILLY TO BE LIKE THAT!!! love is not shown on how much your boyfriend knows about your hobbies, your tastes, but what is important is how much he CARES about you!!!
<br /><br />i laughed at me, this silly girl, who was angry before when my boyfriend could not pronounce my chinese name correctly and who did not know which tea was my favorite..hahhahahha...I AM SO STUPID!! how can i expect my boyfriend who is not a chinese speaker can pronounce my name perfectly the first time? how can i expect my boyfriend knows that Jasmine is my favorite tea even my mom did not know it??
<br /><br />stop being so stupid and silly, girl! hahah...

<br /><br />so it was ended like this, the relationship with him whom i have loved in the past 8 months.
<br /><br />i did not know how to express my sadness after the message from him..i did not know how to pretend that i was not hurt at all..i did not know why i wanted to call him a LIAR..at that moment, i felt like a part of my world disappered which i have lived in with so much happiness and joy.
<br /><br />8 months....it has been 8 months....or only 8 months....1 hour  per day on the phones, 240 hours in total, 10 days exactly, plus our holiday for 10 days..?????? ONLY 20 DAYS. yes, that is true. 20 days of being in contacts only....not a big deal, no.
<br /><br />i recalled the memories from the first day we met, the first &quot;honey&quot; he called me, the first kiss, the first......throught these 8 months, what i felt from our relationship was warmth and joy even we are so far away..he did a very good job to be my boyfriend..cared about me as much as he could..told me how much he was crazy after me as often as he could, taught me spanish as much as he could..convinced me that we could sort everything out as soon as we could..
<br /><br />i really did not understand why he said he could not enter my world? actually, i was so open to him more than anyone else, loving him so deeply with hope and faith,trying to be DEDICATED to him by rejecting all the dates..i did not understand either why he said he was not happy since i thought we really enjoyed contacting each other...
<br /><br />felt like being CHEATED. 
<br /><br />helena said that maybe there was something going wrong there with him otherwise he would not be that DIFFERENT. 
<br /><br />in this relationship, maybe what i cared more was my feelings and love and joy of myself, i simply did not KNOW what he wanted and how he felt really.i was too IN and dedicated in the way of pursuit more happiness instead of asking him WHAT DO YOU REALLY WANT FROM ME?
<br /><br />we had our plan together, a plan that i would go and visit him..remembered that he said he had bought some tulips in his garden then i could help him to arrange them....he said he would like to go travelling with me, having our pinic together besides the beautiful lakes..studying languages together and cooking together.....however, all the pictures have been scattered in his hands.
<br /><br />many pieces of my memories have been replayed again and again repeatedly...wanted to talk to him one more time to know whether HE EVER LOVES me or not.
<br /><br />i want to believe that it was a romantic love with him, i want to tell myself like what he told me that I DESERVE MORE, but i did not know whether i can still have faith in LOVE in the future or not.
<br /><br />i was hurt.
<br /><br />i want to escape.
<br /><br />but i can not hurt myself more.
<br /><br />but i can not leave myself alone.
<br /><br />now i understand how short everything will last if it is not from HIM, everything is gonna change in human being's world except the love from GOD. do not think you can change this changing world anymore because no one can be like HIM.

<br /><br />HOT
<br /><br />BUSY
<br /><br />TRAVELLINGS A LOT
<br /><br />NEW FRIENDS
<br /><br />my july this year was busy with business trips in this hot summer.(Hong Kong, Chengdu and Changsha)..what i liked in business trip was not only to expand my sales networks but also good oppotunities to know more people and to learn from them.
<br /><br />HK was great. a good place for shopping because there were so many things on sales then..hahha...i could not stop walking on this street to that one, feeling the new trend in fashion and trying to live there in a different way..
<br /><br />what i liked in hk:
<br />1. subway system: convenience and effecttiveness. 
<br />2. on-sales products. adidas, nike, clinique, gucci,bosinni...
<br />3. food
<br />4. mixed cultures.
<br />5. nice people
<br />6. bars
<br />......
<br /><br />in the second week of july, i went to chengdu with anita. wow the conference was a great event with so many brilliant scholars and professional people. i still remembered how nurvous anita felt when she attended the conference..haha..
<br />i met jozsef from bank of finland who was the first friend i made there. we argued quite hot about the &quot;one-child&quot; policy in china and how it influenced the whole society in 21th centry. he was a smart guy with kindess.
<br /><br />Zach was the second friend i made there. we met during our dinner. he invited me to take the seat besides him so that our table could be more organized. he was from germany and held a position in AU. he was a smart guy and very funny. we enjoyed our dinner a lot. after the dinner, me and anita, zach and joszef went to sightseeing..and then we ended up in a bar.
<br /><br />wow the bar was amazing!!!the beers,the songs and the game..zach was so funny that he suggested we joined the &quot;game of dating&quot; there. we could wrote to anybody in this bar anything you wanted to say to him/her.so zach wrote to a few cute girls suggesting some dates. i wrote to the singer who had a beautiful and sexy voice. anita wrote to the pianolist...hahha but i was the only one who got the REPLY. we enjoyed it a lot that night.
<br /><br />these two guys suggested that we took a bus to travel grand budda mountain the next day so we went. oh my god, it was so hot there but there were thousands of people lining up who wanted to worship the budda there. it was one of the sites that has been listed as human heritage by UN. so it took us like 1 and an half hour to get down to the moutain to see the budda.
<br /><br />after the trip there, we had our clothes changed and then attended the dinner served by the conference. there were too many dishes to finish though. what was surprising was that andreas, one of my customers, sat at the same table as me like twice but i did not recognize him. later we went to the bar again which was in the outdoors with amazing view of the river. anita did not join us because she was so tired after the travelling.
<br />..........................
<br />we needed to say goodbye to each other after the conference..i told anita that i was so sad leaving chengdu..i liked that city a lot. zach went to beijing and joszef went to tibet after the event. me and anita went to jiuzhaigou..
<br /><br />will write more about jiuzhaigou later.

<br /><br />Gab said :&quot;people come and people go, so what we should do is to enjoy the time being with them.&quot;
<br /><br />Thats true.
<br /><br />Before Gab suggested meeting up with him in shenzhen, i was kind of reluctant even i thought he was funny, cute and kind.but finally we met up. yes, he was a good guy to be with, making jokes that would make me laugh so hard; being serious of everything even sometimes i was just joking; telling me that i was a gifted person.....but somehow and somewhat, i did not show him my real self coz i was in a relationship then. he said i was a moody person because i acted so differently even in just 10 minutes. it was that day when he told me that he needed to go back to make the research done as soon as possible, i was so sad but i could not tell him to stay a little bit longer in shenzhen, i just could not do that..so what i did instead was to keep silent and acted like very cold and indifferent.
<br /><br />it was not myself at all during our short time together. and it was so hard for me to conceal all of my true feelings when we talked. i could not say the words such as &quot;like&quot; to him even he said so to me, i could not put everything behind just to enjoy every moment with him.
<br /><br />he left. i left. he asked me whether i would miss him and i said i would not. i wanted to kill myself when those lying words came out of my mouth, but i thought i had to.
<br /><br />Gab decided to work in chongqing intercontinental hotel for 6 months. he asked me again whether i would visit him or not and i said no.
<br /><br />August 16th, Gab told me that he got an offer in swezerland so he might go there to teach--it is one of the things he always wants to do in the past so he decided to give up the job in chongqing.
<br />it was the same day when i broke up with my boyfriend. in just a day i lost my love and my friendship with Gab. i realized that we would not see each other again anymore. 
<br /><br />Gab was right. we need to enjoy the time being with someone coz you never know whether you will have another chance to meet him/her tomorrow or not. life is full of surprises and chances for all the people, so many people that we know might leave and we will make new friends with many later too. it is how life is.
<br /><br />i wish that i could see Gab again whenever. want to let him know i was not a moody girl at all, and i just did not know how to be a real myself at that time.

<br /><br />it will be one of those exciting experience in my life that i will not forget. i was so nurvous at the beginning walking on a steel rope to reach the destination 100 meters away. Tang was the first one in  my team and i was the second one. another 2 guys were behind me, so 4 of us were in a team. i held the other two ropes on each side and to moved forward step by step. the  ropes on each side was so high so i needed to grap them with all my energy to walk firm. when we reached one third, i was so tired coz of my arms being held up so high..so i just stopped there. the trainer and all of the members encouraged me to walk further but i said i wanted to give up...&quot;cherry, you are one of the team, do not give it up&quot; ..that was what my teammate told me. he used his arm to pressed the ropes lower for me to reach them so that i could walk along without too much pain. i told myself that i could not give up, i need to fulfill our mission with all of them.
<br /><br />Step by step, i made it!!!!!! actually, 3 guys in my team helped me a lot especially in the middle way..wow i was so happy when everybody came and hugged me like i was their heroin.
<br /><br />The next challenge was to climb the stair with just ropes. the distance between two steps was 3-4 meters high, so we needed to use the rope to climb it. girls were so nurvous to do that coz we were so scared of the steps. i was chosen to be the first one to perform this challenge. Longfei was my teamate. i told mysefl that i needed to finish it as much as i could and i could not give up in the middle. so i used my leg to reach the first step with the power from my arm through the rope..i did it so well!!! all the members clapped and cheered for me!!! after i learnt the skill, it was so easy for me to climb to the second , the third, and then the forth step. Longfei helped me when i could not reach the highest step with his arms holding my legs and pushed me ahead. so i made it to the highest step!!!!
<br /><br />i did it!!! people said i did not so well that i set them a good example!!!wow i was so happy after it!!
<br /><br />i never know how much i can challenge myself to do the things that nearly beyond my limit. but when i have the challenge like todays, what i need to do is to stay firm, to have faith in myself that i can make it, which is so important in everything i am doing.
<br /><br />i like this kind of outdoor activities...it is not only of teamwork spirit, it is also the good chance for you to find out how much potential that you have to reach the unreachable you thought before.
<br /><br />GREAT DAY. EXCELLENT CHALLENGE.

<br /><br />auntie asked about my relationship with him. i told her that we broke up already..she was so surprised because my mom even did not know it!!haha i said :&quot;auntie, it is how life goes right? we need to hope for the best and prepare for the worst right?&quot; my mom felt sorry for me too and asked how i felt now. when i talked to her on the phone, i nearly cried out by thinking of how supportive my mom has been always even my uncle and grandpa disagreed so much....  i believed that she went through the same as i did coz she cared about me so much.
<br /><br />i told mom that i was ok...no more phone dates anymore so that i could spend more time &quot;phone dating&quot; her, haha...mom laughed at last when i made this joke. 
<br /><br />my life will change a bit after each love affair. i was not a little girl anymore so i know how to love myself and protect myself from being hurt again..
<br /><br />mmmmmm......
<br /><br />some of my good friends are busy INTRODUCING their male friends to me...haha...thay are so funny...it is too much for me to be engaged in another relationship like right now since i need to work out where my next step will be....
<br /><br />i believe that GOD has his wonderful plan for me, and what i need to do is to obey him with all my heart and mind..
<br /><br />thanks all, my mom, auntie and my good friends. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" />

<br /><br />Hope he would understand.
<br /><br />Was grateful for those people who were/are there when i needed/need a company..I know that V was a great guy but ....
<br /><br />If i could have loved him less, i will stand up happily soon; If i could have loved him less, i will not wake up during the midnight feeling so lonely and sad; If i could have loved him less, my world would not be changed at all even without the connection with him.
<br /><br />V knows what i feel and how i feel, but he just can not ask me to do anything that i do not want to do.
<br /><br />I love saying &quot;I love you more&quot; whenever..now i am ended up with being hurt MORE.
<br /><br />HAHAHAHHAHHAHAHH.
<br /><br />After some laughters, my new life begins...a new life full of love, full of dreams of the future, full of hope for a better life, full of ambition to achieve more, and full of happiness and joy..
<br /><br />YES! He is just a past to me. Past is past which has some connection with the present but just very little. Friends suggested me to delete all the emails, conversation history and pictures of him, but i said i would not. To someone who will not appear in my life anymore and who means nothing to me from this moment on, i will leave and keep something there for memories....when someday i want to recall some part of it, at least something is there which is available for me to pick up and which i will be so grateful that i have not deleted.  If you have a miserable life, you will not delete all things about life right?
<br /><br />HAHHAHHAHAH. Laughters again. Lovely laughters..Cute laughters..Real laughters..Cherry's new laughters.

It seems that she was quite happy in this kind of relationship with him..i asked her:&quot; do you believe in every word he said to you?&quot;
<br /><br />YES was the answer she gave me then.
<br /><br />Having a cup of tea on my hand, i wanted to do some readings. but i just could not concerntrate myself on it coz there was this question &quot; do you believe in every word he said to you&quot; haunting in my head which made me felt really bad.....
<br /><br />In our relationship, i really believed in EVERY word he said to me. he told me that he posted some material to me on spanish learning(he said he posted a parcel before for my birthday present but unfortunately it got lost), so i checked with our POST lady nearly everyday for this re-post one. after i checked it today as usual, i began to LAUGH AT myself &quot; do you think he really have done it? what if it was just a lie?&quot;
<br /><br />hahahahh, maybe, right?
<br /><br />so i will not check it anymore since i should believe that he NEVER did that. he was so right!! i did not know him in real life at all...
<br /><br />do not believe in EVERYTHING he said to you when he does not exixt in your REAL life.

<br /><br />U of Bern is really good..except the fact that they have the requirement of German language. why German? Why not spanish? why not english? so i will NEVER have the chance to go there. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/sad.gif" alt=":)" />
