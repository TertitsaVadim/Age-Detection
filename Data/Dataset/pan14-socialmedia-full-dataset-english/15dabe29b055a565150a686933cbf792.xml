Walking can be done at any place and time without costing you a penny. You don’t even have to go out if you don’t want to. But like all things in this world, walking has its downside as well.<br /><br />Walking your way to physical fitness is a gradual process. This type of exercise doesn’t produce instant results and that’s why many people find it hard to stick to walking. It’s effective, but you have to be patient. And that’s why keeping a log is very important for fitness walkers.<br /><br />The Benefits of Keeping a Log for Fitness Walkers<br /><br />Keeping Track – It’s hard to keep track of what you have and haven’t done in terms of walking without keeping a log. Even the best memories are still liable to be erroneous or inaccurate so it’s best to list down everything you need to remember on your log.<br /><br />Source of Motivation – Why do people keep diaries? They do so not only for a love for writing but also to be able to remember the past and see how they’ve grown. The same thing goes for fitness walkers. Keeping a log allows them to see how much they’ve grown and what they’ve accomplished since they’ve taken up walking as a form of exercise. Seeing their achievements on paper motivates them to do better because the numbers are proof that they’re indeed reaching their goals.<br /><br />Means of Social Interaction – You can also choose to keep a log online. If you do so, it can be a means of meeting other fitness walkers like you. Keeping a log allows you to meet new friends and get advice from people who have similar interests with yours.<br /><br />Two Choices for Keeping a Log<br />MANUAL – If you’re fond of writing and keeping scrapbooks, a handwritten log is probably more suitable for you. Having an actual log to keep track of the important statistics in your fitness walking bout will allow you to update your notes easily and immediately as long as you have your notebook and pen with you. A manual log can also present a worthy challenge to your imagination as you think of more ways to make it more interesting. Costs of keeping an actual log are minimal as well.<br /><br />As for the downside of keeping a log manually, you’ll have to rely on your own computations to ensure that you’ve calculated such things as the amount of calories burned correctly.<br /><br />ONLINE – As mentioned earlier on, you also have the choice of keeping an online log, but this may require you to pay annual fees. It also requires you to have an Internet connection. Having an online log is more convenient, however, than keeping a manual one because the system will automatically compute important statistics for you. You’ll only have to input simple data such as your weight and the amount of time you’ve spent exercising.<br /><br />Helpful Tips for Keeping a Log for Fitness Walking<br />It’s best to keep your fitness log small enough that it wouldn’t take up much space in your exercise bag but large enough to allow you to write in comfort. Decorate the front and back covers if you wish.<br /><br />At the front or back cover of your log, write down important formulas so that you can check them readily enough if you’ve forgotten how to compute for something.<br /><br />At the first page of your log, write down your goals for fitness walking. Whenever you’ve accomplished something, reward yourself accordingly. Paste photos of your rewards to provide additional motivation for yourself.<br /><br />Always list down the place, time, and date of each instance you’ve indulged in fitness walking. Take note of what you’ve worn and what you’ve felt before, during, and after walking. Write down comments about the weather and environment as well.<br /><br />Whenever you find useful articles about fitness walking or anything related to health and fitness that you deem helpful, paste a copy on your fitness log.<br /><br />If you have companions for fitness walking, ask them to write a motivational message for you on your log.<br /><br />And lastly, if you really want this to be effective, make sure that you use it consistently.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gather.com%2FviewArticle.action%3FarticleId%3D281474979707945"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.gather.com/viewArticle.action?articleId=281474979707945</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fworldvillage.com%2Felvisking616-sonny-french"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://worldvillage.com/elvisking616-sonny-french</a>

Walking can be done at any place and time without costing you a penny. You don’t even have to go out if you don’t want to. But like all things in this world, walking has its downside as well.<br /><br />Walking your way to physical fitness is a gradual process. This type of exercise doesn’t produce instant results and that’s why many people find it hard to stick to walking. It’s effective, but you have to be patient. And that’s why keeping a log is very important for fitness walkers.<br /><br />The Benefits of Keeping a Log for Fitness Walkers<br /><br />Keeping Track – It’s hard to keep track of what you have and haven’t done in terms of walking without keeping a log. Even the best memories are still liable to be erroneous or inaccurate so it’s best to list down everything you need to remember on your log.<br /><br />Source of Motivation – Why do people keep diaries? They do so not only for a love for writing but also to be able to remember the past and see how they’ve grown. The same thing goes for fitness walkers. Keeping a log allows them to see how much they’ve grown and what they’ve accomplished since they’ve taken up walking as a form of exercise. Seeing their achievements on paper motivates them to do better because the numbers are proof that they’re indeed reaching their goals.<br /><br />Means of Social Interaction – You can also choose to keep a log online. If you do so, it can be a means of meeting other fitness walkers like you. Keeping a log allows you to meet new friends and get advice from people who have similar interests with yours.<br /><br />Two Choices for Keeping a Log<br />MANUAL – If you’re fond of writing and keeping scrapbooks, a handwritten log is probably more suitable for you. Having an actual log to keep track of the important statistics in your fitness walking bout will allow you to update your notes easily and immediately as long as you have your notebook and pen with you. A manual log can also present a worthy challenge to your imagination as you think of more ways to make it more interesting. Costs of keeping an actual log are minimal as well.<br /><br />As for the downside of keeping a log manually, you’ll have to rely on your own computations to ensure that you’ve calculated such things as the amount of calories burned correctly.<br /><br />ONLINE – As mentioned earlier on, you also have the choice of keeping an online log, but this may require you to pay annual fees. It also requires you to have an Internet connection. Having an online log is more convenient, however, than keeping a manual one because the system will automatically compute important statistics for you. You’ll only have to input simple data such as your weight and the amount of time you’ve spent exercising.<br /><br />Helpful Tips for Keeping a Log for Fitness Walking<br />It’s best to keep your fitness log small enough that it wouldn’t take up much space in your exercise bag but large enough to allow you to write in comfort. Decorate the front and back covers if you wish.<br /><br />At the front or back cover of your log, write down important formulas so that you can check them readily enough if you’ve forgotten how to compute for something.<br /><br />At the first page of your log, write down your goals for fitness walking. Whenever you’ve accomplished something, reward yourself accordingly. Paste photos of your rewards to provide additional motivation for yourself.<br /><br />Always list down the place, time, and date of each instance you’ve indulged in fitness walking. Take note of what you’ve worn and what you’ve felt before, during, and after walking. Write down comments about the weather and environment as well.<br /><br />Whenever you find useful articles about fitness walking or anything related to health and fitness that you deem helpful, paste a copy on your fitness log.<br /><br />If you have companions for fitness walking, ask them to write a motivational message for you on your log.<br /><br />And lastly, if you really want this to be effective, make sure that you use it consistently.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/jeliasonewlease/blog/blogid=4332014" target="_blank">http://en.pan.netcom/jeliasonewlease/blog/blogi...</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Farthurpayne410.xanga.com%2F753494094%2Fomron%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://arthurpayne410.xanga.com/753494094/omron/</a>

Walking can be done at any place and time without costing you a penny. You don’t even have to go out if you don’t want to. But like all things in this world, walking has its downside as well.<br /><br />Walking your way to physical fitness is a gradual process. This type of exercise doesn’t produce instant results and that’s why many people find it hard to stick to walking. It’s effective, but you have to be patient. And that’s why keeping a log is very important for fitness walkers.<br /><br />The Benefits of Keeping a Log for Fitness Walkers<br /><br />Keeping Track – It’s hard to keep track of what you have and haven’t done in terms of walking without keeping a log. Even the best memories are still liable to be erroneous or inaccurate so it’s best to list down everything you need to remember on your log.<br /><br />Source of Motivation – Why do people keep diaries? They do so not only for a love for writing but also to be able to remember the past and see how they’ve grown. The same thing goes for fitness walkers. Keeping a log allows them to see how much they’ve grown and what they’ve accomplished since they’ve taken up walking as a form of exercise. Seeing their achievements on paper motivates them to do better because the numbers are proof that they’re indeed reaching their goals.<br /><br />Means of Social Interaction – You can also choose to keep a log online. If you do so, it can be a means of meeting other fitness walkers like you. Keeping a log allows you to meet new friends and get advice from people who have similar interests with yours.<br /><br />Two Choices for Keeping a Log<br />MANUAL – If you’re fond of writing and keeping scrapbooks, a handwritten log is probably more suitable for you. Having an actual log to keep track of the important statistics in your fitness walking bout will allow you to update your notes easily and immediately as long as you have your notebook and pen with you. A manual log can also present a worthy challenge to your imagination as you think of more ways to make it more interesting. Costs of keeping an actual log are minimal as well.<br /><br />As for the downside of keeping a log manually, you’ll have to rely on your own computations to ensure that you’ve calculated such things as the amount of calories burned correctly.<br /><br />ONLINE – As mentioned earlier on, you also have the choice of keeping an online log, but this may require you to pay annual fees. It also requires you to have an Internet connection. Having an online log is more convenient, however, than keeping a manual one because the system will automatically compute important statistics for you. You’ll only have to input simple data such as your weight and the amount of time you’ve spent exercising.<br /><br />Helpful Tips for Keeping a Log for Fitness Walking<br />It’s best to keep your fitness log small enough that it wouldn’t take up much space in your exercise bag but large enough to allow you to write in comfort. Decorate the front and back covers if you wish.<br /><br />At the front or back cover of your log, write down important formulas so that you can check them readily enough if you’ve forgotten how to compute for something.<br /><br />At the first page of your log, write down your goals for fitness walking. Whenever you’ve accomplished something, reward yourself accordingly. Paste photos of your rewards to provide additional motivation for yourself.<br /><br />Always list down the place, time, and date of each instance you’ve indulged in fitness walking. Take note of what you’ve worn and what you’ve felt before, during, and after walking. Write down comments about the weather and environment as well.<br /><br />Whenever you find useful articles about fitness walking or anything related to health and fitness that you deem helpful, paste a copy on your fitness log.<br /><br />If you have companions for fitness walking, ask them to write a motivational message for you on your log.<br /><br />And lastly, if you really want this to be effective, make sure that you use it consistently.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.blogigo.com%2Fomronhj112pedometer1%2FOmron%2F1%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.blogigo.com/omronhj112pedometer1/Omron/1/</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Farthurpayne410.bravejournal.com%2Fentry%2F77345"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://arthurpayne410.bravejournal.com/entry/77345</a>
