Some say it's simply because they just acquired exhausted of counting. That's humorous.<br /><br />Some even say that it's the day when the UFOs are likely to arrive again and take us &quot;residence.&quot;<br /><br />Even if the appropriate date is 2012, does that actually indicate that we are going to go into a series apocalyptic disasters? This has been explained by scholars to be practically nothing but buzz. Nothing at all but a way for men and women to write guides and make films sensationalizing the date.<br /><br />Who understands why the Mayan calendar ends on that date?<br /><br />I have a concept. It's just a concept, but it appears to make sense primarily based on the observations of the mystic and religious communities. Dependent on the publications and new age concepts coming about. Above the past 10-20 several years, there has been an evolution of the human species. An evolution of our spirituality, irrespective of faith.<br /><br />The sunshine and the Milky Way galaxy will, for the very first time, be aligned with the center of the universe. Every little thing will be going through the center of the Universe on Dec. 21, 2012.<br /><br />My principle is that we, as a human race (the greater part, or much more than 50%) will have attained a stage of spiritual and psychic ascension. A various and new vibrational stage of thinking is currently taking spot, we just haven't achieved the 50% mark. This will be achieved at the conclude of the Mayan calendar.<br /><br />It will be a refined change.<br /><br />So a lot of individuals are wanting to discover how to much better harness the legislation of attraction and some folks want to faucet into and increase their psychic skills. The legislation of attraction IS the use of psychic capacity. This all points to my fifty% theory.<br /><br />In searching for to learn how to get our brains into much more of the Delta and Theta mind wave designs, we are searching for this spiritual ascension. Those of us who are working on improving and expanding our psychic ability will come to feel a new awakening, a new connectedness on the 21st day of December, 2012. It will be refined, but it will be felt.<br /><br />Ascension does not equal dying. It simply signifies functioning on a different energy vibration, a higher vibrational airplane inside our physical planet.<br /><br />A physical world where the vast majority of us will have figured out how to manifest and harness the law of attraction.<br /><br />Cloud computing today is much more well-liked than ever before. As a conclusion, the Mayan prophecy is that the individuals on earth will still left their noxious naturel and be friendlier towards other.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Flincolnmckee11325.webs.com%2Fapps%2Fblog%2Fshow%2F10053244-the-quit-of-the-world-prediction-by-the-mayan-complete-enumeration-calendar-for-2012"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://lincolnmckee11325.webs.com/apps/blog/show/10053244-the-quit-of-the-world-prediction-by-the-mayan-complete-enumeration-calendar-for-2012</a> ,   ,  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.squidoo.com%2Fonlinecalendar201219"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.squidoo.com/onlinecalendar201219</a>
