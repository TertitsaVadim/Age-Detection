<br /><br />The first Muslims had landed in Myanmar (Burma’s) Ayeyarwady River delta, Tanintharyi coast and Rakhine as seamen in ninth century, prior to the establishment of the first Myanmar (Burmese) empire in 1055 AD by King Anawrahta of Bagan or Pagan. [1][2] [3][4]The dawn of the Muslim settlements and the propagation of Islam was widely documented by the Arab, Persian, European and Chinese travelers of Ninth century.[5][6] The current population of Myanmar Muslims are the descendants of Arabs, Persians, Turks, Moors, Indian-Muslims, sheikhs, Pakistanis, Pathans, Bengalis, Chinese Muslims and Malays who settled and intermarried with local Burmese and many ethnic Myanmar groups such as, Rakhine, Shan, Karen, Mon etc.[7][8]

<br /><br />[edit] Muslim diaspora
<br />The population of the Muslims increased during the British rule of Burma because of new waves of Indian Muslim Immigration. [9]This sharply declined in the years following 1941 as a result of the Indo-Burman Immigration agreement,[10]and was officially stopped following Burma's (Myanmar) independence on 4 January 1948.
<br /><br />Muslims arrived in Burma as travelers, adventurers, pioneers, sailors, traders,[11]Military Personals (voluntary and mercenary)[12], and a number of them as prisoners of wars.[13] Some were reported to have taken refuge from wars, Monsoon storms and weather, shipwreck [14]and for a number of other circumstances. Some are victims of forced slavery [15]but many of them are professionals and skilled personals such as advisors to the kings and at various ranks of administration whilst others are port-authorities and mayors and traditional medicine men.[16]

<br />Persian Muslims traveled over land, in search of China, and arrived northern Burma at Yunnan (China) border. Their colonies were recorded in Chronicles of China in 860 AD.[17][18] Myanmar Muslims were sometimes called Pathi, and Chinese Muslims are called Panthay. [19]It is widely believed that those names derived from Persi (Persian). Bago Pegu), Dala, Thanlyin (Syriam), Taninthayi (Tenasserim), Mottama (Martaban), Myeik (Mergui) and Pathein (Bassein) were full of Burmese Muslim settlers and they outnumbered the local Burmese by many times. In one record, Pathein was said to be populated with Pathis. Perhaps Pathein comes from Pathi.[20] And coincidentally, Pathein is still famous for Pathein halawa, a traditional Myanmar Muslim food inherited from northern Indian Muslims. In Kawzar 583 (13th Century), Bassein or Pathein was known as Pathi town under the three Indian Muslim Kings. [21] [22] [23] Arab merchants arrived Martaban, Margue. Arab settlement in the present Meik’s mid-western quarters. [24]
<br /><br />Panthay
<br /><br />During Bagan King, Narathihapate, 1255-1286, in the first Sino Burman war, Kublaikhan’s Muslim Tatars attacked and occupied up to Nga Saung Chan. Mongols under Kublai Khan invaded the Pagan Kingdom. During this first Sino Burman war in 1283, Colonel Nasruddin’s Turks occupied up to Bamaw. (Kaungsin)[25] (Tarek) Turk were called, Mongol, Manchuria, Mahamaden or Panthays. [26] The Chinese General Mah Tu Tu managed the building of a mosque donated by the Yunnanese Muslim king, Sultan Sulaiman, in nineteen century in central Mandalay. The mosque is still maintained in a very good condition. Most of the Myanmar Chinese Muslims are staying around the mosque and it is well known as Panthay Mosque. That area is called Panthay Dan (Panthay Quarters).[27]
<br /><br />[edit] Muslims in Bagan (Pagan) Period
<br />Byat Wi and Byat Ta
<br /><br />The first evidence of Muslim landing in Burma’s chronicle was recorded in the era of the first Burmese Empire of Pagan (Bagan) 1044 AD. Two Arab Muslim sailors of BYAT family, Byat Wi and Byat Ta, arrived Burmese shores, near Thaton.[28] (There are people in Iraq, Arabia and some Surthi Northern Indian Muslims with the same sir name even at present. See Byat and Bayt) After their ship wrecked, they managed to use a plank to swim to the shores. They took refuge and stayed at the monastery of the monk in Thaton. They were said to be tall, fair, swift, brave and very strong. According to a chronicle of Burma related to the Byat brothers, they were said to have strength of the full-grown elephant after eating the magical meat of a (Zaw Gyi) or Fakir, a meal originally prepared for the monk who saved them. As a consequence, Thaton king became afraid of them and killed the elder brother while he was sleeping in his wife’s house. The younger brother managed to escape to Bagan and took refuge to king Anawratha. He was kept near the king. He had to fetch flowers, ten times a day, from the Mont Popa, few dozens of miles away from Bagan. He married a girl from Popa and got two sons, Shwe Byin brothers.[29]
<br /><br />Shwe Byin brothers
<br /><br />Later they also served the king as worriers, even as the special agents to infiltrate the enemy’s inner circle. They were famous after they successfully infiltrated the Chinese King Utibua’s bodyguards and drawn three lines with white lime on the Utibua’s body and also wrote the threatening message on the wall. Because of that event, the mighty powerful Chinese army and the king himself were scared, frightened, alarmed and signed a peace agreement with the Burmese.[30]
<br /><br />Though successful in the Bagan's affair with Utibua, they were finally put to death. It is generally assumed that they refused to contribute in the building of a pagoda at Taung Byone[31], just north of Mandalay. The brothers’ enemies left vacant the spaces for the two bricks so that the king could notice. After a brief inquiry the king ordered to punish the brothers for disobedience but instead of any punishment, they were killed.
<br /><br />The royal raft could not move after that, may be the silent protest against the killing by the friends who were not happy with the execution. The royal sailors at that time were mostly known to be Muslims. The witty, white and black Indian Brahmans, royal consultants interpreted that, the two brothers were loyal faithful servants but unjustly punished, became Nat (spirit) and they pulled the rudder of the royal boat to show their displeasure. Then only, Anawratha ordered the building of the spirit-palace at Taung Byone and ordered the people to worship the two brothers.[32]This was the clever Royal trick used to be played by the Burmese kings to execute the powerful rivals and posthumously elevated them to the level of Nats or powerful Spirits or local gods, just to please their followers or the people who love the executed heroes.
<br /><br />For five days each year Taung Byone village becomes a fairground. Taung Byone, 14 km north of Mandalay, has about 7,000 nat shrines, nearly 2,000 of them elaborate ones dedicated to the village’s famous sons—the brothers Shwe Byin Gyi and Shwe Byin Lay. [33] Up to the present, the followers or believers worship the shrine and those two brothers. Although all those worshipers are tralatitious Buddhists, they all abstain from eating pork, which is not a custom to Buddhism. It is a taboo to allow anyone to carry pork on the buses or cars, while going to that spirit festival still celebrating annually and attended by followers all over Burma. We can still see the vacant slot for the two pieces of brick allegedly triggered that tragic prosecution.[34] So they became the first Muslims persecuted in Burma, possibly because of their religious belief.
<br /><br />King Anawratha 1044-1077 AD also had Myanmar Muslim army units and body guards. When King Anawrahta attacked Martaban, capital of Mon (Talaing) King, Mingyi Swa Saw Kae’, two Muslim officers’ army unit fiercely defended against his attack.[35]
<br /><br />Nga Yaman Kan
<br /><br />The King Anawrahta appointed a Muslim Arab [36] as a Royal teacher for his son, Prince Sawlu. That teacher’s son later became the Governor of Bago (Pegu) known as Ussa City. His name was Raman Khan.[37] (Known as Nga Yaman Kan in Burmese. Nga was usually put in front of all commoners i.e. not from the Royal family). King Sawlu himself had given the town to his childhood friend, also an adopted brother because they were fed from the same breast as Raman Khan’s mother was the wet nurse of Prince Sawlu.[38]
<br /><br />Once Raman Khan won the game of dice, jumped with joy and clapped the elbows. The loser king Sawlu was angry and challenged Rahman Khan to rebel against him with the Bago province, if he was a real man. Raman Khan accepted the challenge, went back to Bago and marched back to Bagan with his army of soldiers on horses and elephants. Rahman and army camped at Pyi Daw Thar Island. He was clever and witty with tactics, even knew the geography and landscape near the enemy’s home ground and successfully used them for his advantage. He successfully trapped the famous Kyansittha, King Sawlu and his mighty large Bagan Burmese army in swamps. The whole Bagan army fled. Sawlu was later found and arrested.[39]
<br /><br />Kyanzittha tried to rescue but Sawlu refused to be rescued. His last fatal miscalculation led him to be killed by Raman Khan. Rahman Khan himself was ambushed by the sniper bow-shot of Nga Sin the hunter and died. Later Kyanzittha became the third king of Bagan Dynasty. While expending the empire he brought back many Indian-Muslim captives. They were settled in central Burma.[40]
<br /><br />[edit] Muslim sailors and traders
<br />In the chronicles of Malaysia, during the first Melacca Empire of Parameswara in the early fifteenth century, it was recorded the Burmese (Muslims) sailors and traders were regularly arriving there. [2] Those Bago (Pegu) seamen, likely to be Muslims, were also recorded by the Arab Historians of tenth century. During fifteen to seventeen centuries, there were a lot of records of Burmese Muslim traders, sailors and settlers on the whole coast of Burma. That was from Arakan coast (Rakhine), Ayeyarwady delta and Tanintharyi coast (Including all the islands along the whole coast).[41] During Peik Thaung Min (early Bagan dynasty, 652-660 AD), Arab travelers from Madagascar to China through East Indian Islands, visited Thaton and Martaban ports. It was recorded in Arab chronicles in 800 AD. [42]
<br /><br />Because Burma was located at the center of the shipping and trading route starting from Arabia and India, heading towards Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Korea, Japan and China, the whole of the coast of Burma developed rapidly. Dela, Yangon and Thanlyin (Syriam) became shipyards, depots of goods and markets for exchange of goods. The Muslims dominated all the seaports in Burma and Thailand, at that time.[43]
<br /><br />In seventeenth century, those Muslims controlled the business and became so powerful because of their wealth. They were even appointed as Governor of Mergui, the Viceroy of the Province of Tenasserim, Port Authorities, Port Governors and Shah-bandars (senior port officials).[44] [45] [46] Muslim sailors built many mosques, but those should be more appropriately called Temples as they were equally holy to Muslims, Buddhists, Hindus and Chinese. They were called Buddermokan,The so called Buddermokan on Sittway island is claimed by believers of different faiths. ... ‘Buddermokan’ [47][48][49] in memory to Badral-Din Awliya, a saint. They are found in Akyab, Sandoway and on a small island off Mergyi. [50]
<br /><br />Sa Nay Min Gyi King (King Sane) had two flotillas of Steam-ships, named Alarhee and Selamat, both are Arabic Islamic names. In 1711, Myanmar Missionary was sent to Mogul King Shah Alam. They used the Alarhee Ship and the captain was an Arab. [51]
<br /><br />[edit] Muslim prisoners of war
<br />When Tabinshwehti, TaungooKing 1530-50 AD attacked Hanthawaddy, Muslim soldiers were helping Mons with artillery. [52] [53] [54]
<br /><br />Nat Shin Naung, Taungoo King 1605-82, rebelled against Anaukpetlun, who had founded a new dynasty at Ava in 1613. He retreated to Thanlyin or Syriam, under the rule of Portuguese mercenary Philip de Brito, Anaukpetlun captured the city in 1613 following a long siege where he crucified Nat Shin Naung and de Brito. He enslaved the Indian mercenaries including the Muslims and five battle ships. The Muslim prisoners of wars were settled at the north of Shwebo. [55]
<br /><br />King Thalun (1629-1648)., the successor of Anaukpetlun settled those Muslims at Shwebo, Sagaing and Kyaukse. [56] Muslim prisoners of war were settled in upper Myanmar by successive Burmese kings. Myae Du near Shwebo was one of the sites. Muslim prisoners from Bago during 1539-1599 AD were the first settlers.Tabinshwehti brought back the Muslim prisoners, after attacking Arakan in 1546 and 1549 AD.King Anaukpetlun conquered Syriam in 1613 AD and brought back Muslim soldiers and sailors as prisoners of war. They were settled in Myedu, Sagaing, Yamethin and Kyaukse. King Sane brought back several thousand Muslim prisoners of war from Sandoway and settled in Myedu in 1707 AD. Next year few thousands more were settled in those places and Taungoo.
<br /><br />King Alaungpaya attacked Assam and Manipur of India and brought back more Muslims to settle in Burma.These Muslims later assimilated to form core of Burmese Muslims.[57] Earlier they were called Myedu Kala or Kala Pyo.(Kala = foreigner; Pyo = young.)3000 Muslims from Arakan took refuge under Sa Nay Min Gyi King 1698-1714. They were divided and settled in Taungoo, Yamethin , Nyaung Yan, Yin Taw, Meiktila, Pin Tale, Tabet Swe, Bawdi, Syi Tha, Syi Puttra, Myae du and Depayin. This Royal decree was copied from the Amarapura Royal Library in 1801 by Kyauk Ta Lone Bo. [58] During King Bagyidaw 1819-37 rule, Maha Bandula conquered Assam and brought back 40,000 prisoners of war. About half of them were likely to be Muslims. [59] Maha Bandula and Burmese Army’s war at Ramu and Pan War were famous. Burmese captured one big cannon, 200 firearms, mixed Sepoy Indian 200. Muslims amongst them were relocated at the south of Amarapura that is Myittha river’s south. [60]
<br /><br />[edit] Royal Muslim-soldiers
<br />When the famous Raza Dirit attacked and conquered Dagon (Yangon), Muslim soldiers defended from the Burmese side.
<br /><br />Muslim artillerymen and riflemen served regularly in Burmese army and sometimes even as royal bodyguards because the Burmese kings never trust their own race. This is understandable because there was the custom that time that he who kills the king becomes a king. And in Burmese history sometimes the son killed his own father and brothers killed each other to become a king. Even the first Burmese King, Anawrahta had killed his half-brother, King Sokkate. Sokkate had also forced and dethroned his own father King Kunhsaw.[61] The army of King Anawratha (eleven century) already boasted Indian units and bodyguards, Muslims apparently among them. [62] When Tabinshwehti attacked Martaban in 1541 AD, many Muslims resisted strongly. When Bayintnaung successfully conquered Ayuthaya (Thailand) in 1568-1569 AD he use the help of Muslim artillerymen. King Alaungpaya 1752-1760 AD conquered Syrim. Muslim prisoners of war were forced to serve in his army.[63] Pagan Min 1846-1853 AD appointed U Shwe Oh , a Burmese Muslim, as the Governor of the Capital city, Amarapura. His personal secretary U Paing (also a Burmese Muslim) donated a two- mile long bridge, made of teakwood across the Taung Tha Man Lake. It is still useful and now became a scenic area attracting picnickers and tourists. In 1850, the Governor of Bagan was also said to be a Muslim.[64]Burmese kings employed a lot of Muslims in his inner circle: Royal bodyguards, eunuchs, couriers, interpreters and advisers.[65]
<br /><br />[edit] Muslims in Konbaung Dynasty
<br />Muslims in Amarapura
<br /><br />Muslims in Amarapura were about 20,000 families, at the time of Innwa (Ava) kingdom (1855 AD). Most of them were Sunni Muslims. The first mosque in Yangon was built in 1826 AD, at the end of first Anglo-Burmese Wars. It was destroyed in 1852 AD when the British attacked Yangon again.[66]
<br /><br />During the Konbaung dynasty Alaungpaya’s attack of Mons near Pyay, Mon warrior Talapan was assisted by Muslim soldiers. Because of their artillery fire, a lot of Burmese soldiers were wounded and died. [67]
<br /><br />In 1755 Alaungpaya conquered Dagon and renamed it Yangon (meaning 'The End of Strife'). Mon soldiers surrendered and four Muslim rich men also surrendered with the expensive presents, ammunitions and four warships. [68] Although conquered Yangon there are more battles to fight with Mons. So Alaungpaya rearranged the army. Pyre Mamet was one of the “Thwe Thauk Gyi” assigned to serve as the Royal Bodyguard. [69] Alaungpaya attacked Thanlyin or Syriam, and many Muslim artillery men were captured. [70] Alaungpaya captured four warships and Muslim soldiers. They were later allowed to serve him. [71] On the page 203 of the Twin Thin Teik Win’s Cronicles of Alaungpaya’s battles, it was recorded as only three warships.
<br /><br />After Alaungpaya captured Pegu, and at the parade, those Pathi Muslim soldiers were allowed to march with their traditional uniforms. [72] Four hundred Pathi Indian soldiers participated in the Royal Salute March. [73] [74] King Bodawpaya Bodaw U Wine (Padon Mayor, Padon Min) (1781-1819) of the Konbaung Dynasty founded Amarapura as his new capital in 1783. He was the first Burmese King who recognized his Muslim subjects officially by the following Royal decree. He appointed Abid Shah Hussaini and assistants, Nga Shwe Lu and Nga Shwe Aye to decide and give judgment regarding the conflicts and problems amongst his Burmese Muslim subjects. [75] Abid Shah Hussaini burial place was well known as a shrine in Amarapura Lin Zin Gone Darga. Before Ramu and Pan War battles, Burmese army had a march. Among the Burmese army, Captain Nay Myo Gone Narrat Khan Sab Bo’s 70 Cavalry (horse) Regiment, was watched by Maha Bandula. [76] Burmese Muslim Horsemen were famous in that Khan Sab Bo’s 70 Cavalry (horse) Regiment. Khan Sab Bo’s name was Abdul Karim Khan and was the father of the Captain Wali Khan, famous Wali Khan Cavalry Regiment during King Mindon and King Thibaw. Khan Sab Bo was sent as an Ambassador to Indo China by Bagyidaw. During Bagyidaw’s reign, in 1824, Gaw Taut Pallin battle was famous. British used 10,000 soldiers but defeated. During that battle Khan Sab Bo’s 100 horsemen fought vigorously and bravely. [77] More than 1300 loyal brave Kala Pyo Muslims (means young Indian soldiers) were awarded with colourful velvety uniforms. [78]
<br /><br />When Konbaung Dynasty’s 8th. Tharrawaddy Min (King) marched Okkalapa, more than 100 Pathi Muslim Indian Cannoners took part. [79] There are also a lot of Muslim soldiers in other parts of the Tharrawaddy Min’s army.
<br /><br />But during the Konbaung Dynasty’s 9th. Pagan Min 1846-52 there was a blemish in Muslim’s history. Royal Capital Amarapura’s Mayor Bai Sab and his clerk U Pain were arrested and sentenced to death. U Pain was the one who constructed and donated the Taunthaman bridge with more than 1000 teak piles and is still in good condition. Although the real background or aim of building the bridge was not known, before the bridge was built, British Ambassador Arthur Fair’s ship could sailed right up to the Amarapura city wall but the bridge actually obstruct the direct access by British.
<br /><br />King Mindon
<br /><br />During Pagan Min reign, Mindon Prince and brother Ka Naung Prince run away with their servants to Shwe Bo and started a rebellion. U Bo and U Yuet were the two Muslims who accompanied the princes. Some Kala Pyo Burmese Muslim artillery soldiers followed them. [80] U Boe later built and donated the June Mosque, which is still maintained in 27th. street, Mandalay. U Yuet became the Royal Chief Chef.
<br /><br />Regent Prince Ka Naung sent scholars to study abroad. Malar Mon @ U Pwint was a Burmese Muslim sent to study the explosives. He became the Yan Chet won or Minister of explosives.
<br /><br />In the Royal Defence Army, many Cannoners were Kindar Kala Pyos and Myedu Muslims. [81] In 1853 King Mindon held a donation ceremony. He ordered to prepare halal food for his Muslim soldiers from, Akbart Horse Cavalry, Wali Khan Horse Cavalry, Manipur Horse Cavalry and Sar Tho Horse Cavalry altogether about 700 of them.
<br /><br />U Soe was the Royal tailor of King Mindon . [82]
<br />Kabul Maulavi was appointed an Islamic Judge by King Mindon to decide according to the Islamic rules and customs on Muslim affairs.
<br /><br />Captain Min Htin Min Yazar’s 400 Muslims participated to clear the land for building a new Mandalay city.
<br /><br />Burmese Muslms were given specific quarters to settle in the new city of Mandalay[83]

<br />King Mindon donated his palace teak pillars to build a mosque at North Obo in central Mandalay. (The pillars which failed to place properly at the exact time given by astrologers.) 
<br />The broadminded King Mindon also permitted a mosque to be built on the granted site for the Panthays (Burmese Chinese Muslims.[86] Photos of Mandalay Panthay mosque.[3] 
<br />Inside the Palace wall, for the Royal Body Guards, King Mindon himself donated and started the building of the Mosque by laying the Gold foundation at the South-eastern part of the Palace located near the present Independent Monument. This Mosque was called the Shwe Pannet Mosque. That mosque was destroyed by the British to build the Polo playground.
<br /><br />King Mindon (1853-78) donated the rest house in Mecca for his Muslim subjects performing Hajj. Nay Myo Gonna Khalifa U Pho Mya and Haji U Swe Baw were ordered to supervise the building. The Kind donated the balance needed to complete the building which was started with the donations from the Burmese Muslims. This was recorded in the Myaedu Mosque Imam U Shwe Taung’s poems.[87]
<br /><br />During King Thibaw’s reign, Muslim soldiers who participated in the Royal Parade were;
<br /><br />Captain Bo Min Htin Kyaw and his 350 Kindar Kala Pyo artillery soldiers. 
<br />Setkyer Cannon Regiment Captain Hashim and 113 Cannoners 
<br />Mingalar Cannon Regiment Captain U Kye and 113 Cannoners 
<br />Mingalar Amyoke Sulay Kone Captain U Maung and 113 Cannoners 
<br />Mingalar Amyoke Bone Oh Captain U Yauk and 113 Cannoners. [88] 
<br />After King Thibaw’s declaration of war on the British, Burmese Army formed three groups to descend and defend the British attack. One of those, Taung Twingyi defence chief was, Akhbat Horse Calvery Chief, Mayor of Pin Lae Town, Minister Maha Min Htin Yar Zar. His name was U Chone when he was the Chief Clerk of Kala Pyo Army. During the Myin Kun Myin Khone Tain revolt, he carried the Chief queen of Mindon on his back to safety. So he was rewarded with the Mayor position of Pin Lae Myo which was located 12 miles south of Myittha. [89]
<br /><br />Under Maha Min Htin Yar Zar there were 1629 soldiers:

<br /><br />July 30, 2009 (DV<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cool.gif" alt=":)" />–Around 40 Muslims in western Burma were detained for allegedly ransacking a local immigration office after officials there assaulted a local Muslim man for not paying a fine. 
<br />A resident in Arakan state’s Kyauk Ni Maw village said the dispute started after a local Muslim man who returned from travelling refused to pay a fine for exceeding stay outside of the village as shown in his travel permit. 
<br />Muslims in Arakan state are required to get a document known as the Form-4 from government immigration if they want to travel outside of their region. 
<br />“He said he couldn’t pay the money they asked for as he had already paid a lot acquiring the [permission] document and the officials [at the immigration office] beat him up,” said the village resident, adding that he was left with a broken arm and vomiting blood.” 
<br />News on the attack quickly spread to Kyauk Ni Maw village where 75 percent of the population are Muslim. Some local villagers, including the man’s relatives, were enraged. 
<br />“They went to the immigration office and beat up the people who beat up the man. They also tore down the office building and broke some flag poles,” he said. 
<br />Following the incident, authorities arrested around 40 people, including some who were not involved, the villager said, and detained them in nearby Yanbyal township jail. 
<br />The detainees are due to appear in court on 10 August where they will face charges for breaching peace. 
<br />“They just arrested random people, but all Muslim, in the village without identifying who was involved in the attack,” said the villager. “Some people had already fled in fear of getting arrested in connection with the case.” 
<br />Muslims living in Burma have long been marginalized by the military government. 
<br />Three prominent ‘anti-Muslim’ riots have erupted in Burma in the past 12 years following heightened tension between Muslims and Buddhists. 
<br />Their situation was thrown into the spotlight earlier this year when around 1000 Rohingya refugees washed up in boats on Thailand’s shores, only to be towed back out to sea and set adrift by Thai authorities. 
<br />The Rohingya, who are a minority Muslim population, are not recognized by the Burmese government and suffer frequent discrimination due to their lack of legal status.

<br />Oct 5, 2007 (DV<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cool.gif" alt=":)" />–The Myanmar Muslim Association released a statement yesterday calling on Burmese Muslims to observe prayer meetings in Burma and join international demonstrations. 
<br />The statement criticises the Burmese military regime for its mistreatment of people of all religions. 
<br />“The junta leaders who discriminate and harass us followers of different religions by destroying our mosques and churches have shown their real form of evil by violently torturing, killing their own religion's respectable monks”, the statement reads. 
<br />“It is the duty of all Myanmar Muslims to act, verbally, mentally and physically, against the military dictators who have been making the people of Burma, including young students and monks, suffer in poverty.” 
<br />The statement calls upon Muslims in Burma to gather at mosques and houses on 5 October to pray for freedom from “false leaders”. It also urges Burmese Muslims in other countries to join the demonstrations planned for 6 October as part of an international day of action on Burma. 
<br />Ko Kyaw Swar, a spokesperson for MMA, emphasised the support of Muslims for a better future for Burma. 
<br />&quot;Our religion teaches us to pray too. We have to take any duties given to us for the sake of our country's good future. Our ancestors also did the same thing in the past. Now is our time.&quot;

<br /><br />Chiang Mai (Mizzima) – Aping a recent diktat against the country's Christian community, authorities have summoned and warned leaders of Burma's Muslim community not to worship in residential flats.
<br /><br />Rangoon's Kyauktada Township Peace and Development Council office, as they did with Christian pastors from the city, summoned Islamic leaders on the 5th of this month and warned them to halt all religious services and the reading of the Quran in residential flats. 
<br /><br />&quot;The government doesn't give permission to build mosques, so people of the Islamic faith have to worship in residential areas such as those in Thaketa, North and South Okkalapa [towships]. Now local authorities have warned leaders not to provide religious services in these residential flats,&quot; an Islamic leader from Rangoon told Mizzima. 
<br /><br />A similar ban against Christians was reported by Mizzima on Wednesday (<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mizzimaburmese.com%2Fnews%2Finside-burma%2F2238-2009-01-08-12-06-59.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.mizzimaburmese.com/news/inside-burma/2238-2009-01-08-12-06-59.html</a>).
<br /><br />&quot;We had special religious services at night. But now local authorities have banned such services. They warned us not to provide these services, and if we defy the order serious action would be taken against us. So the people are scared and dare not to gather at these places. It seems we have to perform our religious services in a mosquito net. The people now dare not ask us to provide religious services in their homes as has been customary up to this time. Instead, they come to the mosque and read the Quran. However, the poor cannot come to these downtown locations,&quot; explained another Muslim leader.
<br /><br />Thai-based Human Rights Education Institute of Burma (HREI<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cool.gif" alt=":)" /> Director Aung Myo Min said the position of the government is a clear violation of human rights in that the ruling discriminates against a religious minority in Burma. 
<br /><br />&quot;According to the latest constitution drafted and approved by the SPDC [government], all are equal before the law, irrespective of their race and creed. This is a violation of the fundamental rights of a citizen and moreover is discriminatory against a minority religion,&quot; he expounded.
<br /><br />Further, Burma is signatory to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), which clearly stipulates religious freedom and the right to practice one's faith. 
<br /><br />&quot;Previously we heard about such repression against religious minorities only in Chin and Kachin states. But now such restrictions are being imposed in major cities such as Rangoon, which shows the deterioration of the situation in this regard,&quot; Aung Myo Min added. 
<br /><br />A majority, nearly 90 percent, of Burmese follow the Theravada Buddhist faith, with the country's Christian and Islamic communities representing five and four percent of the population, respectively.

<br />“I saw some Muslims kneel down and pay respect to the Buddhist monks,” said Pan Cha, a Burmese Sikh businessman who arrived at the Thai-Burmese border in early October after being involved in the September demonstrations. 
<br />Over a month since the junta cracked down violently on the monks and their supporters in the streets of Burma, Pan Cha forcefully said in an interview with The Irrawaddy that “The Burmese people are not afraid—nationwide demonstrations are coming back again soon!”
<br />“I came here [to the border] just to escape for a while and tell the truth about what happened in Burma to the international media,” he said. “After, I will go back to Burma.”
<br />In the context of the pro-democracy movement in Burma, it is important to remember the role of Burmese Muslims.
<br />According to residents and journalists who were at the demonstrations, many Muslims supported and participated in the protests and were badly beaten by Burmese security forces.
<br />In a video clip seen around the world, soldiers beat and kick a young Muslim man who is huddled on the ground. They club him with batons and kick him brutally. 
<br />Pan Cha, who helped organize security for the demonstrations, said that a top Burmese minister ordered pro-junta group, the Union Solidarity and Development Association, to beat any Muslim in sight at the demonstrations, because Muslims were never USDA members.
<br />He went on to say that when they first saw Buddhist monks demonstrating on September 18, many Muslims wanted to support the monks, but were worried about repercussions against the Muslim community as a whole. They feared it would cause more Kala Burma Adigayone (Muslim - Buddhist riots) and create problems for all Muslims in Burma (Kala is a derogatory name for Muslims and Indians in Burmese).
<br />Inspired by the resilience of many Muslims in Rangoon, Pan Cha began encouraging them not to fear the government, telling them that they were standing up for the rights of all the people of Burma. On September 19, many Muslims joined in the demonstrations after their prayers and supported the monks by offering water, betel nut and fresh towels.
<br /><br />Some wealthy Muslims supported demonstrators by providing mobile phones to make communications between the protesters easier. Some who were car owners blocked the military trucks that were carrying arrested demonstrators and tried to help them escape when the army convoys stopped. They risked their own lives on behalf of others.
<br />According to the 88 Generation Students group, at least seven Muslims in Rangoon were charged with inciting state unrest by supporting the monk-led demonstrations. They are currently being detained in Pabedan Township in Rangoon.
<br />Pan Cha also confirmed that before he left Burma on October 4, he knew of about 30 Muslims who had been hospitalized from being beaten during the street protests. More than 100 Muslims were still being detained, he said. 
<br />Muslims have long played a leading role in Burma’s democracy movement, even dating back to before Burmese independence. 
<br />All scholars of Burmese history know the story of Abdul Razak. Better known as U Razak, he was the Muslim headmaster of Mandalay Central National High School and became Minister of Education and National Planning in Burma’s pre-independence government. He was also a leader of the Anti-Fascist People’s Freedom League in Mandalay.
<br />He lost his life at aged 49, when he was gunned down by assassins on July 19, 1947, together with Burmese independence leader Gen Aung San and seven other cabinet members and colleagues. The day is now commemorated annually in the country as “Martyrs’ Day.”
<br />As a minority group, Muslims in Burma regularly suffer from social and religion discrimination. The Burmese government regularly encourages ultra-nationalism and uses religion as a political tool. The Burmese government will not grant citizenship to Muslims and, to all intensive purposes, do not recognize Muslims as being Burmese.
<br />The junta’s top leader, Snr Gen Than Shwe, is known to despise Muslims and Chinese people who live in Burma. However, most Chinese in Burma are business people and were not directly involved in the September uprising. In Mandalay, home to thousands of Chinese immigrants, most doors remained closed during the protests, a sign that the ethnic Chinese were not in support of the demonstrators. The Muslim minority, on the other hand, played an active part in the pro-democracy demonstrations, just as they have throughout the country’s troubled recent history. 
<br />“We cannot say that the demonstrations were not related to Muslims just because they were led by Buddhist monks,” Pan Cha concludes. 
<br />“We were all born and live in Burma and should not discriminate among each other. We must work together toward democracy.”

<br /><br />[edit] Muslims in Burmese history
<br />The first Muslim recorded in Burmese history
<br /><br />The first Muslim documented in Burmese history (recorded in Hmannan Yazawin or Glass Palace Chronicle) was Byat Wi during the reign of Mon, a Thaton King, circa 1050 AD.[1] He was killed not because he was a Muslim but because the king was concerned about his strength.
<br /><br />Shwe Byin brothers executed
<br /><br />The two sons of Byat Wi's brother Byat Ta, known as Shwe Byin brothers, were children executed because they refused to obey the forced labour order of the king, maybe because of their religious belief.[2][3]
<br />But it is sure that they were killed not because they were Muslims nor because they failed to contribute to the building of the pagoda but because the king or people walking in the corridors of power in the royal court were worried about their popularity and skills. It was clearly recorded in the Glass Palace Chronicle of the Kings of Burma that they were no longer trusted.[4]
<br /><br />Assassination of Nga Yaman Kan
<br /><br />Rahman Khan (Nga Yaman Kan) was another Muslim killed for political reasons, because of treason to his own king and clearly not as a religious persecution. During a time of war, the famous national hero King Kyansittha sent a hunter as a sniper to assassinate him.[5][6]
<br /><br />Massacre in Arakan
<br /><br />Another mass killing of Muslims in Arakan was probably not for religious reasons but likely due to politics and greed only. Shah Shuja was the second son of the Mogul Emperor Shah Jahan who built the famous Taj Mahal of India. Shah Shuja lost to his brother and fled with his family and army to Arakan. The Arakan King Sandathudama (1652-1687 AD), allowed him to settle there. He wanted to buy ships to go to Mecca and was willing to pay with silver and gold. But the Arakan king asked for his daughter and also became greedy for his wealth. At last after an alleged unsuccessful attempt at rebellion the sultan and all his followers were killed. Those men seen to have a beard, the symbol of Islam, were beheaded, not because they were Muslims but because they were easily identified from others by this feature. Women were put into prison and let them die with hunger. Therefore, the massacre was targeted at Muslim refugees from India not because of their religion, Islam, but for an economic or political reason.[7][8][9][10][11][12]
<br /><br />Muslims under Bayintnaung
<br /><br />Muslims served under Burmese king Bayintnaung (1550-1589 AD).[13] In 1559 AD after conquering Bago (Pegu) he prohibited the Muslims from having halal meals of goats and chickens by not allowing them to kill these animals in the name of God. He showed some religious intolerance and had forced some of his subjects to listen to Buddhist sermons and some were even said to be converted by force. He also disallowed the Edil Adha, Kurbani sacrifice of cattle.[14]
<br /><br />Muslims under Alaungpaya
<br /><br />King Alaungpaya (1752-1760) prohibited Muslims to do halal on cattle.[15]
<br /><br />Bodawpaya
<br /><br />King Bodawpaya (1782-1819) arrested four famous Burma Muslim Moulvis (Imams) from Myedu and killed them in Ava, the capital, after they refused to eat pork.[16] According to the Myedu Muslim and Burma Muslim version there were seven dark days after that execution and the king later apologized and recognized them as saints.[17][18]
<br /><br />[edit] Anti-Muslim and anti-Indian Riots under British rule
<br />British Official White Paper
<br /><br />This paragraph's basic facts are taken from Maurice Collis' &quot;Trials in Burma&quot;. He was the judge in Rangoon, eyewitness to the riots, who wrote his book based on the British Official White Paper given by The Simon Commission (The Royal Statutory Commission, appointed according to the Law of the Government of India 1919, The Montague-Chelmsford Law.)[19]
<br /><br />Anti-Indian and anti-Muslim sentiments started during British rule
<br /><br />Anti-Indian sentiments started after the First World War during the British rule.[20] In Burma there were a half million Muslims in 1921. More than half of Indians were Indian Muslims.[21] Although Burma Muslims are different from Indian Muslims and Indian Burma Muslims, Burmese Buddhists put them together, even with Hindu Indians, and called them Kala.[19]
<br /><br />The root of this hatred was:[19][22]
<br /><br />Earlier Muslim persecution of Buddhists and Hindus during the Mughal wars of conquest, where many Buddhists and Hindus were forcibly converted. 
<br />Low standard of living of the recent migrants. 
<br />Recent migrants' willingness to do, dirty, difficult and dangerous jobs. 
<br />Indians took over the Burmese lands especially Chittiers. 
<br />Indians had already filled up and monopolized the government services when the Burmese were later ready for those jobs. 
<br />Professional competition. 
<br />World economic recession of 1930 aggravated the competition for the reduced economic pie. 
<br />1930 Anti-Indian riots
<br /><br />In 1930 there were anti-Indian riots in Burma under British rule.
<br /><br />The problem started in Yangon port, because of the irresponsible action of a British firm of stevedores which had employed hundreds of Indian labourers. While those Indians were on strike, that firm had employed the Burmese workers just to break the strike. So the Indians had to give in and ended the strike. Next morning when the Burmese workers came and reported for work they were told by the British firm that their service was no longer needed. Some Burmese workers were angry and started the fight and Indians retaliated. It grew rapidly into an anti-Indian (including anti-Muslim) riot. Even within the first half-hour at least two hundred Indians were massacred and flung into the river. Authorities ordered the police to fire upon any assembly of five or more who refused to lay down their arms, under Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code. That was a black day of 26 May. Within two days the riot spread to the whole country and no one knew the exact causality.[19]
<br /><br />1938 Anti-Muslim riots
<br /><br />There was an anti-Muslim riot in 1938, while Burma was still under British rule. The real agenda was aimed at British government but the Burmese dare not show this openly. Growing Nationalistic sentiments were fanned by the local media and disguised as anti-Muslim to avoid early detection and notice. It was followed by the full blown force of the mighty British Government machinery. Throughout the Burmese struggles against British rule, all the political issues, movements, meetings, demonstrations, riots, rebellions and even the revolutions were instigated, inspired, influenced and led by newspapers.[23][24]
<br /><br />Burma for Burmese Only Campaign
<br /><br />The Burmese started the Burma for Burmese only Campaign and marched to the Muslim (Surti) Bazaar.[25] While the Indian Police broke the violent demonstration, three monks were hurt. Burmese newspapers use the pictures of Indian police attacking the Buddhist monks to further incite the spread of riots.[26] Muslim properties: shops, houses and mosques were looted, destroyed and burned. They assaulted and even massacred the Muslims. It spread all over Burma and a recorded 113 mosques were damaged.[27]
<br /><br />The Inquiry Committee by the British
<br /><br />On September 22, 1938, the British Governor set up the Inquiry Committee.[28] They found out that the real cause was the discontent in the government regarding the deterioration in sociopolitical and economic conditions of Burmans.[29] The book was used as an inciting factor by the irresponsible Burmese newspapers.[30] They use the anti-Muslim propaganda as a disguise to cover up the political struggle to gain independence. So the Buddhist used the Muslims as a scapegoat, for the first time, to fight against the British.
<br /><br />The Simon Commission (The Royal Statutory Commission, appointed according to the Law of the Government of India in 1919, The Montague-Chelmsford Law) an inquiry of the effects of Dyarchy system of ruling Burma, had recommended that special places be assigned to the Burma Muslims in the Legislative Council.
<br /><br />It recommended that full rights of citizenship should be guaranteed to all minorities: the right of free worship, the right to follow their own customs, the right to own property and to receive a share of the public revenues for the maintenance of their own educational and charitable institutions. It recommended Home Rule or independent government separate from India or the status of dominion.
<br /><br />But the British Government refused to accept all these recommendations except for separation, at the round table committee on India held in London in 1930.
<br /><br />[edit] Muslims under U Nu
<br />AFPFL expelled the Burma Muslim Congress[31]
<br /><br />The BMC, Burma Muslim Congress was founded almost at the same time with the AFPFL, Anti-Fascist Peoples’ Freedom Party of General Aung San and U Nu before World War II . On December 25, 1945 in Pyin Mana, U Razak was elected President of BMC and decided to join AFPFL. U Razak was elected AFPFL President in the Mandalay district in 1946. Later the Governor accepted him as the member of constitutional council. He had very good relations with Buddhists and was even fluent in Pali (Buddhist scriptures are written in this ancient language of India). He became the Minister of Education and Planning in Bogoke’s (General Aung San) Government and was later assassinated with him.[32] But he had supported the main policy of the AFPFL: that is against the partition along community or religious lines. U Razak and his few associates objected to the struggle of those demanding specific constitutional guarantees for the Burma Muslim minority. So, although U Razak was a very popular, important and prominent Burma Muslim leader who had successfully organized Burma Muslims to be able to get an official record that they had participated since the very beginning of the Burmese National struggle towards independence.
<br /><br />His stand of united Burmese (Burma) nation sacrificing the long-term interest of guarantee for the rights of Minority Burma Muslim satisfied not only the Burmese Buddhist leaders of the AFPFL, but strangely also the British Government. Maybe because of that he got a lot of personal rewards. U Raschid and more prominently U Khin Maung Lat, follows the general policy of sacrificing the Rights and Interests of the Burma Muslim Community for ‘the country and their party’. No wonder most of the Burma Muslims later refused to regard or recognize these ‘self interested’ seasoned politicians as their true representatives or saviours. Prime Minister U Nu, just a few months after the independence of Burma, requested the Burma Muslim Congress to resign its membership from AFPFL. In response to that U Khin Maung Lat, the new President of BMC, decided to discontinue the Islamic Religious activities of the BMC and rejoined the AFPFL. Later he became Minister of Justice but no longer represented the wishes of the Burma Muslim community. The newly-formed Burmese Muslim League requested a special government department for Muslim affairs to determine their own future, the same as for other minorities, who had Ministries in Yangon and governments in their states. U Nu removed the Burma Muslim Congress from AFPFL on September 30, 1956. BMC was asked to dissolve since 1955. Later U Nu decreed Buddhism as the state religion of Burma against the will of the ethnic minorities and various religious organizations including Burma Muslims. U Nu, a devoted Buddhist, was pressured by the wealthy and influential Hindi merchants who ordered the prohibition of the slaughtering of cattle. Although he relaxed that during the Kurbani Edd (Hariraya Haji), Muslims had to apply the permits for each cattle and strictly follow procedures under police supervision. Although General Ne Win revoked the first order and allowed the slaughter of cattle for daily consumption, the second order of strict restriction for the sacrifice remained up to the present. Even a mosque’s official who failed to adhere to the permitted number of cattle was arrested and punished. Some Muslims complained that U Nu’s government had made more difficult conditions and regulations for the Haj pilgrimage than the Buddhists pilgrims going to Sri Lanka and Nepal.
<br /><br />[edit] Muslims under General Ne Win
<br />When General Ne Win swept to power on a wave of nationalism in 1962, the status of Muslims changed for the worse. Muslims were expelled from the army and were rapidly marginalized.[2] Burma has a Buddhist majority. Muslims are stereotyped in the society as &quot;cattle killers&quot; (referring to the cattle sacrifice festival of Eid Al Adha in Islam). The generic racist slur of &quot;kala&quot; (black) used against perceived &quot;foreigners&quot; has especially negative connotations when referring to Burmese Muslims. The more pious Muslim communities who segregate themselves from the Buddhist majority face greater difficulties than those who integrate more at the cost of observance to Islamic personal laws.[3]
<br /><br />Muslims in Burma are affected by the actions of Islamic extremism in other countries. Violence in Indonesia perpetrated by Islamists is used as a pretext to commit violence against Muslim minorities in Burma. The anti-Buddhist actions of the Taliban in Afghanistan (the destruction of the Buddhas of Bamiyan) was also used as a pretext to commit violence against Muslims in Burma by Buddhist mobs. Human Rights Watch reports that there was mounting tension between the Buddhist and Muslim communities in Taungoo for weeks before it erupted into violence in the middle of May 2001. Buddhist monks demanded that the Hantha Mosque in Taungoo be destroyed in &quot;retaliation&quot; for the destruction of the Buddhas of Bamiyan.[4] Mobs of Buddhists, led by monks, vandalized Muslim-owned businesses and property and attacked and killed Muslims in Muslim communities. This was followed by retaliation by Muslims against Buddhists.
<br /><br />The dictatorial government, which operates a pervasive internal security apparatus, generally infiltrates or monitors the meetings and activities of virtually all organizations, including religious organizations. Religious freedom for Muslims is reduced. Monitoring and control of Islam undermines the free exchange of thoughts and ideas associated with religious activities.[5] Accusations of &quot;terrorism&quot; are made against Muslim organizations such as the All Burma Muslim Union.[6]
<br /><br />It is widely feared that persecution of Muslims in Burma could foment Islamic extremism in the country.[7] Many Muslims have joined armed resistance groups who are fighting for greater freedoms in Burma.[8]
<br /><br />[edit] 1997 Anti-Muslim Riots in Mandalay
<br />The racial tension in March 1997 between Buddhists and Muslims and the attack on Muslim properties began during the renovation of a Buddha statue. The bronze Buddha statue in the Maha Myatmuni pagoda, originally from the Arakan, brought to Mandalay by King Bodawpaya in 1784 AD was renovated by the authorities. The Mahamyat Muni statue was broken open, leaving a gaping hole in the statue, and it was generally presumed that the regime was searching for the Padamya Myetshin, a legendary ruby that ensures victory in war to those who possess it.[33]
<br /><br />On 16 March, 1997 beginning at about 3:30 p.m. a mob of 1,000-1,500 Buddhist monks and others shouted anti-Muslim slogans. They targeted the mosques first for attack, followed by Muslim shop-houses and transportation vehicles in the vicinity of mosques, damaging, destroying, looting, and trampling, burning religious books, committing acts of sacrilege. The area where the acts of damage, destruction, and lootings were committed was Kaingdan, Mandalay.[34] The unrest in Mandalay allegedly began after reports of an attempted rape of a girl by Muslim men. At least three people were killed and around 100 monks arrested.[35]
<br /><br />[edit] 2001 Anti-Muslim Riots in Taungoo
<br />In 2001,Myo Pyauk Hmar Soe Kyauk Sa Yar (or) The Fear of Losing One's Race and many other anti-Muslim pamphlets were widely distributed by monks. Many Muslims feel that this exacerbated the anti-Muslim feelings that had been provoked by the destruction in Bamiyan, Afghanistan.[36] On May, 15, 2001, anti-Muslim riots broke out in Taungoo, Pegu division, resulting in the deaths of about 200 Muslims, in the destruction of 11 mosques and the setting ablaze of over 400 houses. On May 15, the first day of the anti-Muslim uprisings, about 20 Muslims who were praying in the Han Tha mosque were killed and some were beaten to death by the pro-junta forces. On May 17, Lt. General Win Myint, Secretary No.3 of the SPDC and deputy Home and Religious minister, arrived in Taungoo and curfew was imposed there until July, 12, 2001.[37] Buddhist monks demanded that the ancient Hantha Mosque in Taungoo be destroyed in retaliation for the destruction in Bamiyan.[38] On May 18, however, Han Tha mosque and Taungoo Railway station mosque were razed to the ground by bulldozers owned by the SPDC junta.[39] The mosques in Taungoo remained closed as of May 2002. Muslims have been forced to worship in their homes. Local Muslim leaders complain that they are still harassed. After the violence, many local Muslims moved away from Taungoo to nearby towns and to as far away as Yangon. After two days of violence the military stepped in and the violence immediately ended.[40]
<br /><br />[edit] Human rights violations against Rohingya minority
<br />According to Amnesty International, the Muslim Rohingya people have continued to suffer from human rights violations under the Burmese junta since 1978, and many have fled to neighbouring Bangladesh as a result:[41].
<br /><br />&quot;The Rohingyas’ freedom of movement is severely restricted and the vast majority of them have effectively been denied Burma citizenship. They are also subjected to various forms of extortion and arbitrary taxation; land confiscation; forced eviction and house destruction; and financial restrictions on marriage. Rohingyas continue to be used as forced labourers on roads and at military camps, although the amount of forced labour in northern Rakhine State has decreased over the last decade.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;In 1978 over 200,000 Rohingyas fled to Bangladesh, following the ‘Nagamin’ (‘Dragon King’) operation of the Myanmar army. Officially this campaign aimed at &quot;scrutinising each individual living in the state, designating citizens and foreigners in accordance with the law and taking actions against foreigners who have filtered into the country illegally.&quot; This military campaign directly targeted civilians, and resulted in widespread killings, rape and destruction of mosques and further religious persecution.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;During 1991-92 a new wave of over a quarter of a million Rohingyas fled to Bangladesh. They reported widespread forced labour, as well as summary executions, torture, and rape. Rohingyas were forced to work without pay by the Burmese army on infrastructure and economic projects, often under harsh conditions. Many other human rights violations occurred in the context of forced labour of Rohingya civilians by the security forces.&quot;
<br /><br />As of 2005, the UNHCR had been assisting with the repatriation of Rohingya from Bangladesh, but allegations of human rights abuses in the refugee camps have threatened this effort.[42]
<br /><br />Despite earlier efforts by the UN, the vast majority of Rohingya refugees have remained in Bangladesh, unable to return because of the regime in Myanmar. Now they face problems in Bangladesh where they do not receive support from the government.[43] In February 2009, many Rohingya refugees were helped by Acehnese sailors in the Strait of Malacca, after 21 days at sea.[44]
<br /><br />Over the years thousands of Rohingya also have fled to Thailand. There are roughly 111,000 refugees housed in 9 camps along the Thai-Myanmar border. There have been charges that groups of them have been shipped and towed out to open sea from Thailand, and left there. In February 2009 there was evidence of the Thai army towing a boatload of 190 Rohingya refugees out to sea. A group of refugees rescued by Indonesian authorities also in February 2009 told harrowing stories of being captured and beaten by the Thai military, and then abandoned at open sea. By the end of February there were reports that of a group of 5 boats were towed out to open sea, of which 4 boats sank in a storm, and 1 boat washed up on the shore. February 12th 2009 Thailand's prime minister Abhisit Vejjajiva said there were &quot;some instances&quot; in which Rohingya people were pushed out to sea.
<br /><br />&quot;There are attempts, I think, to let these people drift to other shores. [...] when these practices do occur, it is done on the understanding that there is enough food and water supplied. [...] It's not clear whose work it is [...] but if I have the evidence who exactly did this I will bring them to account.&quot; [9]
<br /><br />The prime minister said he regretted &quot;any losses&quot;, and was working on rectifying the problem.

<br />Posted by burmadigest under UNCATEGORIZED 
<br />[13] Comments 
<br />History
<br /><br />The dawn of Muslim settlements and propagation of Islam has been widely documented by Arab, Persian, European and Chinese travelers of the ninth century AD. 
<br /><br />The current population of Burmese Muslims are the descendants of Arabs, Persians, Turks, Moors, Indians, Chinese and Malays, who settled and intermarried with local Burmese and many ethnic Burmese groups such as Kachin, Kaya, Kayin, Chin etc.
<br /><br />Burmese Muslims
<br /><br />By the term Burmese Muslim, our meaning is: every Muslim who lives in Burma regardless of ethnicity, race, section or gender.
<br /><br />Burmese Muslims are citizens of Burma. Muslim leaders estimated approximately 20% of the population was Muslim in 2006 (source: Religious Freedom Report 2006). Historically Burmese Muslims have been living in Burma peacefully and harmoniously with other ethnic nationalities of Burma, and used to have a number of high-ranking officers in the Democratic Government. 
<br /><br />The founding father of Burma, a predominantly Buddhist country, established the new nation as a tolerant and just one, where the minorities, both ethnic and religious, were completely free and equal as citizens and were permitted under the new constitution the freedom to practice their faiths and cultures without fear or favour.
<br /><br />This situation is no longer exists.
<br /><br />Persecution and Exclusion
<br /><br />After General Ne Win seized the power in 1962 Muslims have been deliberately and systematically excluded from governmental positions and hundreds of thousands of Muslims were forced to leave Burma in 1962.
<br /><br />Burmese Muslims have become third class inhabitants, who are no longer considered to be citizens. Under the brutal government of Burma Mosques and Muslim schools have been desecrated or destroyed all over the country. No new religious buildings have been permitted to be built. Publication and distribution of the holy Qur’an and other religious texts are not permitted.
<br /><br />In June 2005, authorities in Shwepyitha Township, Rangoon Division, arrested eight Muslims, including the Imam of the community, and charged them with holding group prayers at the Imam’s house. 
<br /><br />Instigation of Riots and Propaganda
<br /><br />Successive Burmese regimes have encouraged or instigated violence against Muslims as a way of diverting the public’s attention away from economic or political concerns. Mostly they use methods of creating rumours, such as Buddhist women being raped by Muslim men, that Muslims have put women’s sarong (Htamein) on statue of Buddha, etc.
<br /><br />The distribution of anti-Muslim leaflets also makes Buddhists angrier with Muslims, the authorities write false information in those leaflets saying that Muslims meet every Friday to try to make Buddhists convert to Islam. If a Muslim boy marries a Buddhist girl, he will receive financial support from the Mosque, if the girl is educated he will get more support.
<br /><br />Denial of Citizenship
<br /><br />Muslims in the country have difficulty obtaining birth certificates. A local official in Sittwe, Rakhine State, reportedly issued a verbal order in 2005 prohibiting the issuance of birth certificates to Muslim babies born in the area. In Rangoon, Muslims can usually obtain birth certificates for newborns, but local authorities refused to allow them to put names of the babies on their household registers.
<br /><br />National Registration Cards (NRC) are no longer issued to Burmese Muslims. Those who want an NRC must declare their religion as Buddhism on the card. Recently the authorities issued a completely different type of ID card to Muslims in an attempt to completely segregate them from others. 
<br /><br />Muslims have become third class citizens.
<br /><br />Travel restrictions
<br /><br />If you travel in Burma from one place to another you must obtain an ID card. If you do not have one you would face hardship, you have to bribe authorities if you want to continue your journey. Muslims have to pay more than other people who could not show their ID cards on their journey. Sometimes they cannot proceed with their journey.
<br /><br />Discrimination in the Workplace and in Schools
<br /><br />There are many more cases of discrimination in the work place as well as in the military. Muslims are not allowed in the military if they do not change their faith, not only the Burmese Muslim officers, but also their wives have to change to Buddhism if they want to keep their jobs. Dr Maung Di was an education minister who turned to Buddhism to maintain his rank under the Burmese Socialist Program Party of General Ne Win.
<br /><br />In public schools nationwide, all students are required to recite a daily Buddhist prayer. While some Muslim students are permitted to leave the room during this time, some schools require non-Buddhist students to recite the prayer.
<br /><br />In June 2005, authorities forced a Muslim private tutor in Rangoon to close down his school. Although he was teaching only the public school curriculum, authorities accused him of trying to convert children to Islam because he was offering free courses. Authorities also arrested a Muslim cleric in South Dagon Township, Rangoon Division, for holding private Qur’an courses for Muslim children at his house.
<br /><br />Our Fate 
<br /><br />Anti-Muslim movements have always been a nightmare for Burmese Muslims. Burmese Muslims have been a major target the government’s instigation of the divide and rule policy. Anti-Muslim activities have been significantly increased since the year 2000. Nearly one thousand Muslim houses and over 30 Mosques were destroyed in the past 6 years during five constant religious riots.
<br /><br />We need mutual understanding and trust
<br /><br />Mutual understanding and trust is similar to a bi-molecular concept where one cannot be separated from the other. On one hand, the military leaders in power must trust all the opposition parties that are inside as well as outside of Burma, the ethnic armed groups and the religious groups including Muslims. 
<br /><br />To highlight one point, the military must remember that Muslims are also Burmese, or other indigenous ethnicities of their respective areas. They (Muslims) should not be able to forgive, forget and trust the present military people in power to create a mutual understanding. Military in power must realize that without people’s power, so called “Power” is nothing but a threat and an act of bullying. 
<br /><br />In order to get the people’s trust and to create a genuine mutual understanding, they (military) must abide by the rule of law, pay due respect to their fellow countrymen, safeguard the country, and above all, their actions must be according to their words, in another words their promises must be kept and fulfilled. 
<br /><br />Today our country has reached a critical state where we must love, trust and cooperates with each other to save our beloved country, or she will perish to doom. There is actually no other alternative. We have fought for half a century without success. Our country only suffered because of our fighting.
<br /><br />Conclusion
<br /><br />All these problems are because of this military regime. The regime not only prevents, but also creates these problems, to divert people’s attention from the worsening economic and political situation.
<br /><br />We are from Burma, we love our country and we want to live there peacefully and harmoniously. 
<br />We simply wish to co-exist in our beloved country under a democratic government. 
<br />We want to practice our religion without fear or discrimination. 
<br />PLEASE HELP US ACHIEVE THIS.

<br /><br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br /><br />Background on Muslims in Burma 
<br />Burma has been ruled by successive repressive, authoritarian regimes since 1962, when General Ne Win seized power. In 1988, the armed forces brutally suppressed massive pro-democracy demonstrations and since then a junta of senior military officers has ruled by decree, claiming only to be a transitional government. During the last fourteen years the military's human rights record has been appalling. The suppression of political and religious activities has been endemic through the whole of this period.2
<br /><br />The latest Burmese Constitution, adopted in 1974, restricts religious freedom and stresses the paramount supremacy of the State. It states that &quot;the national races shall enjoy the freedom to profess their religion...provided that the enjoyment of any such freedom does not offend the laws or the public interest.&quot;3 But violence and discrimination against Burma's Muslim minority has been commonplace over the last four decades. Islamic leaders in Rangoon believe that attitudes among the predominantly Buddhist Burmese population began to change from tolerance to persecution after General Ne Win seized power in a military coup in 1962. Since then, Muslims have been deliberately and systematically excluded from official positions in the government and the army.
<br /><br />The Burmese government estimates that some four percent of the population are Muslims. However, Islamic leaders believe that Muslims make up nearly ten percent of the population. There has been no official census since Burma gained its independence from Great Britain in 1948. Apart from Arakan, the western Burmese state that borders Bangladesh and is home to the Muslim Rohingyas, Burma's Muslims live predominantly in urban areas throughout the country. According to a senior Muslim leader in Rangoon, most Muslims are indistinguishable in appearance and behavior from the country's Buddhists: they dress the same, wear longyis, speak Burmese, and understand Burmese culture and history.
<br /><br />During the British colonial period and the early years of independence, Muslims played an important role. They held high positions in government and civil society. They were also in the forefront of the fight for independence from the British. After independence, Muslims continued to play a prominent role in the country's business, industrial, and cultural activities. Many Muslims were public servants, soldiers, and even officers. At the time of the last democratically elected parliament in the 1960s, there was at least one Muslim minister and several Muslim members of parliament.
<br /><br />This all changed after General Ne Win seized power in 1962. He initiated the systematic expulsion of Muslims from government and the army. There is no written directive that bars Muslims from entry or promotion in the government, according to Muslim leaders in Burma, but in practice that is what happens.
<br /><br />Although there is no official state religion, the Burmese military government actively endorses Theravada Buddhism in practice, as have previous governments - both civilian and military. The government is increasingly seen identifying itself with Buddhism. The state-controlled media often shows military leaders and government ministers paying homage to Buddhist monks; making donations to pagodas throughout the country; officiating at ceremonies to open, improve, or restore pagodas; and organizing forced donations of money, food, and labor to build or refurbish Buddhist shrines throughout the country. State-owned newspapers regularly feature slogans and quotations from Buddhist scriptures. While undoubtedly motivated in part by religious conviction, this close identification is also seen by many observers as part of the military's strategy to find some form of legitimacy for its rule.
<br /><br />Muslims and Christians have major difficulties in obtaining permission to build places of worship and in importing indigenous-language translations of traditional sacred texts. In fact, over the last ten years there have been numerous reports of mosques being destroyed, in some cases with Buddhist stupas being built in their place.
<br /><br />Muslims in Burma have long suffered from ethnic and religious discrimination. Historical sources suggest that the majority Buddhist population has viewed Muslims with suspicion almost from the time they began to become a significant minority in Burma twelve hundred years ago. While there are no written regulations or laws that mandate any of the customary discriminatory practices which have emerged in Burma today, mistrust and antipathy toward Muslims is deeply rooted.
<br /><br />The Burmese4 have had a long tradition of intermarriage, especially between Burmans and members of ethnic groups found in eastern Burma --Karens, Mons and Shans - which are predominantly Buddhist. In recent years there has also been substantial intermarriage with members of the Chinese community, also made easier by shared religious beliefs. But this occurs far less often in the case of Muslims; normally, marrying into a Muslim family entails conversion to Islam. 
<br /><br />Over the decades, many anti-Muslim pamphlets have circulated in Burma claiming that the Muslim community wants to establish supremacy through intermarriage. One of these, Myo Pyauk Hmar Soe Kyauk Hla Tai (or The Fear of Losing One's Race) was widely distributed in 2001, often by monks, and many Muslims feel that this exacerbated the anti-Islam feelings that had been provoked by the destruction in Bamiyan, Afghanistan.5
<br /><br />Local Buddhist monks have often been at the center of these campaigns. According to Burmese Muslim leaders, distribution of pamphlets in 2001 was also supported by the Union of Solidarity and Development Association (USDA), a government-sponsored mass organization that fulfils a social and political function for the military. 
<br /><br />Officially sanctioned action against the Muslim community has varied over the last two decades. In the mid-nineties there were several attempts to eliminate mosques in different parts of the country, including in Rangoon. But it is more than two years now since any mosques in Rangoon were forcibly closed or razed, according to the president of Burma's Islamic Affairs Council. These previous efforts in Buddhist areas of Burma often had official backing, unlike most of the attacks on the mosques in 2001.
<br /><br />It is difficult to estimate the extent of damage done to mosques in eastern Burma during the violence last year. Many still remain closed, especially in Taungoo where the worst violence occurred. Even in many of the mosques that have reopened, the damage is still clearly visible, as in Pegu.
<br /><br />Special identity papers and travel restrictions on Muslims have also long been in force. Burma denies citizenship status to most Muslim Rohingyas, for example, on the grounds that their ancestors did not reside in the country at the start of British colonial rule in 1824.6 The U.N. special rapporteur on Burma in 1993 urged the government to &quot;abolish its over-burdensome requirements for citizens in a manner which has discriminatory effects on racial or ethnic minorities.&quot;7
<br /><br />Restrictions seem to have been far more rigidly enforced last year because of heightened concerns about the Muslim community. There are many credible reports of Muslims being taken off buses and trains when they were not able to produce their travel papers, and in some cases even when they did. For instance, in February 2001, eight Muslim men traveling to Rangoon were arrested despite having identity papers because they were traveling outside Arakan State without permission from the local police. They were sentenced to seven years imprisonment.8 In October, a Muslim man was taken off a plane in Kawthaung airport in southern Burma, bound for Rangoon without apparent reason; his ticket was cancelled.9
<br /><br />One Muslim woman, a resident of Rangoon, told Human Rights Watch she was unable to return home after traveling to the Andaman Sea on holiday because, she said, the local authorities insisted that she needed a visa to return. She was allowed to travel back to Rangoon two weeks later. 
<br /><br />Muslims wanting to perform the Haj in 2002 also faced especially tight restrictions this past year. In most years several thousand Muslims travel to Mecca for the Haj. Senior Islamic leaders in Rangoon estimate that more than five thousand pilgrims travel to Mecca in a typical year by their own means. This is on top of the two hundred Muslims who go as part of the official Burmese delegation, arranged by the military government. In 2002, only the two hundred pilgrims on the officially organized visit to Mecca were allowed to make the trip.
<br /><br />The government insists there was no prohibition on travel. In theory Muslims were allowed to go on the Haj, Muslims leaders say, but no one was able to get a passport to travel. The number of passports granted to Burmese citizens has been drastically cut, according to official sources in Rangoon. Before last November, more than a thousand passports were issued a month; this has been reduced. Although all Burmese reportedly now have to wait longer for a passport and pay more in bribes for it, Muslims claim that they have had to endure even more than other groups due to prejudice. The president of the Burmese Islamic Council says the percentage of Muslims applicants getting passports has now fallen from 20 percent to 5 percent. This not only makes performing the Haj more difficult, but also restricts Muslim businessmen's commercial activities. 
<br /><br />Although Buddhism is not officially enshrined as the national religion, the Burmese military government often uses Buddhism as a means of laying claim to a form of national legitimacy. The senior generals use Buddhism to bolster their authority, frequently visiting pagodas and paying tribute. Intelligence chief Lt. General Khin Nyunt has even built a new pagoda near the Rangoon Mingaladon airport. 
<br /><br />However, in 2001, the SPDC was far more pragmatic in its approach, partly because their new policy of actively engaging the international community meant that they needed a more measured approach to religious tolerance. The SPDC was anxious to maintain strong relations with Malaysia's Prime Minister, Dr. Mahathir Mohammad, leader of the largest Muslim country in mainland Southeast Asia.
<br /><br />But the Burmese government's approach during much of 2001, at least in areas outside Arakan State, also reflected the belief that to prevent major outbreaks of social unrest they would need to contain Muslim sentiment. Military leaders apparently feared that young hotheads amongst the Muslim community might be provoked into violent action.
<br /><br />Such unrest is something the military regime wants to avoid at all costs. In a rapidly deteriorating economy, with the price of stable goods like edible oil and rice increasing sharply, the possibility of social disturbances developing into a food riot has haunted government leaders. Something similar happened in 1988 and helped spark the massive pro-democracy movement. It paralyzed the government for several months before the military coup on September 18 brutally crushed the demonstrations and established military rule throughout the country.
<br /><br />The Burmese government's reaction to the Taliban's destruction of the Buddhist images at Bamiyan in March 2001 was mixed from the start. Government sources say the military regime sent a formal letter of protest to the Taliban authorities in Kabul but never made its action public. Pictures and videos of the event, pirated and copied from foreign publications and foreign broadcasters, were confiscated by the military authorities for fear they would enflame the country's Buddhist population. The SPDC's failure to publicly condemn the destruction of Buddhist images angered many monks, residents of Rangoon told Human Rights Watch. The government quickly imposed curfews in those towns where violence erupted and in some towns even cut communications, as in Taungoo, Taunggi, and Pegu. Senior Buddhist monks were told to instruct the heads of local monasteries to keep their young monks in their compounds, according to one Rangoon-based monk. &quot;Many monks in Rangoon have also been told not to travel outside the city at present,&quot; he said. &quot;They were told there was a nation-wide ban on all religious ceremonies.&quot; 
<br /><br />The government was also nervous about the Burmese population seeing footage of the destruction of the World Trade Center. Some footage was shown on television and newspapers carried minimal coverage of the events of September 11, but with few photos. In many parts of the country, including Rangoon, military authorities closed the mosques and banned mass gatherings, including meetings for worship. Plainclothes military intelligence officers and police were stationed near mosques in most cities, according to Islamic leaders in Rangoon.
<br /><br />Military authorities again imposed curfews in places where violence erupted in October, describing the curfews as precautionary and intended to prevent individuals from spreading rumors with the intention of creating inter-religious conflict. A government press release announced: &quot;The Government will not condone hate crimes or harassments targeted not only to Muslims but other religions.&quot;10 As a result, security measures, travel restrictions, and measures against illegal immigration were &quot;beefed up.&quot; 
<br /><br />While there are credible reports that military intelligence officers were involved in stirring up anti-Muslim violence in some cities outside Rangoon, other officials seemed to have been concerned that religious riots not get out of control.

<br />By: Farooque Ahmed
<br /><br />Introduction
<br />Minority Muslim communities in some countries are just contented with what they are that they are Muslims. To be precise Muslims don�t believe in racialism or nationalism like others.
<br /><br />Muslims believe in the unity of mankind that is Islamic Ummah who believe in one Universal God as also taught by the 
<br />Holy Quran and Islamic tradition. But this simplistic approach of the 
<br />Muslims, mainly minority Muslim communities in many countries who don�t assert their identity from political perspectives thus ignoring the historical perspectives, are probing to be a nemesis for themselves especially in times of ethnic, racial and nationalist manifestation and backlash by other communities following other faiths. The Muslims are nevitably facing an identity crisis for no reason of their own that is accompanied by historical crisis as well. In other words Muslims lack historical sense in specific situations of critical issues because of their simplistic Islamic approach that just satisfies with the history of origin of Islam in Arabia, how they expanded to be a universal faith and how they belong to a united Islamic Ummah. I take up the examples of the Northeast and Burmese Muslims here.�
<br /><br />Reference
<br />Like the Bosnian Muslims, whom the Serbs claim, are Turkish immigrants;the Rohingya Muslims of Burma (now Myanmar) suffer horrible persecution in the land of their birth. The Bosnians accepted Islam during the Uthmaniyya Empire�s spread into the Balkans in Southeast Europe. The Rohingya Muslims of Arakan have a history that goes back even further to the seventh century A.D. But now Burmese nationalists and anti -Muslim rightists are claiming that the Muslims are recent migrants and even dare to dub them as refugees from Bangladesh, like Assamese and Northeast Indian chauvinists dub Assamese Muslims as late migrants from Bangladesh, thus trying to christen almost all the Muslims as foreigners and deny them rights to life, liberty and historic genuine inhabitations itself.
<br /><br />History
<br />Coming to Myanmar case, the most famous individual to have lived in Arakan was Muhammad Hanifa, one of the sons of Imam Ali ibn Abi Talib. Hanifa reached Arabsha Para, north of present day Maungdaw in north Arakan en route to China in 680 A.D. after losing an important battle at Karbala. 
<br /><br />Confronted by Khaira Pari (Kayapuri), the queen of the region, a battle broke out that was won by Hanifa. The whole region embraced Islam and Muhammad Hanifa married Khaira Pari. To this day, both are regarded as �saints� in Arakan and their shrines are on the peaks of Mayu range Hills, accessible from Maungdaw and Buthidaung townships.
<br /><br />In 1246 A.D. around 47,000 Bengali prisoners were settled in Arakan by the 
<br />king of Arakan. In 1406 King aremeikhla of Arakan was forced to take refuge at Gaur, the then capital of Muslim Bengal, due to a Burmese invasion. In 1429 sultan Nasiruddin Shah of Gaur sent 20,000 troops under general Wali Khan to drive out the Burmese and Mons, and restore Naremeikhla to the throne. 
<br /><br />His restoration occurred the following era after another 30,000 troops were dispatched. Naremeikhla took the title �Suleiman Shah� and established the Mrauk-U dynasty. Meanwhile the 50,000 Muslim troops settled in Arakan turning it into a sultanate where Islam flourished. Persian became the state language and continued until 1845 (21 years after the conquest of Arakan by the British). 
<br /><br />Coins and medallions were inscribed with the kalimah; all Arakan kings were 
<br />graduated in Islamic studies; and in the Quranic verse �Aqimuddin� was the 
<br />State emblem. Even the Buddhist women wore hijab.
<br /><br />One of Suleiman Shah�s successors,Zabuk Shah (1531-1553), extended the empire upto Tanasarim in the south and the Megna River in the west. Between 1430 and 1530, large numbers of Muslims, especially from Chittagong, migrated and settled in Arakan. In 1660, prince Shah Shuja, the son of the Mughal (Mongol) emperor Shahjahan, sought refuge in the court of Arakan after the war of succession. He brought with him large number of Muslim soldiers, courtiers and intellectuals. 
<br /><br />From 1580 to 1666, the whole region, including Chittagong was under Muslim rule. During this period, the Magh Firingi (Portuguese) and slave trade activities reached a peak: whole villages on the banks of the Ganges were destroyed and lower Bengal was virtually depopulated.
<br /><br />Muslim rule in Arakan lasted for more than 350 years, until 1784, when it was invaded and occupied by the Burmese. 200,000 Muslims fled to Bengal and by 1798 two-thirds of the inhabitants had deserted their native land. 
<br /><br />The Rohingya (the historical name of Arakan is Rohang) strived to preserve their Islamic culture from the onslaughts of the Buddhists. They developed their own language, derived from Arabic, Sanskrit, Bengali and Urdu.
<br /><br />To claim that the Rohingyas are Bangladeshi citizens, illegally settled 
<br />in Burma, is ludicrous (see �Spread of Islam�, 1994, pp. 334 by A. Ezzati, Tehran). Bangladesh was only formed in December 1971. The large presence of Rohingyas in Chittagong (Bangladesh) is the result of successive exoduses, mostly forced, from Burma (beginning in 957 until today). Ever since Buddhists 
<br />invaded the Muslim territory of Arakan in 1784, the Rohingya Muslims have faced a systematic policy of genocide (Laila Hasib, Crescent International, 1-15 February, 1993). And the Burmese launched a ferocious attack in Manipur 
<br />occupying Manipur between 1819 and 1826 that drove out many Manipuri Muslim(who started settlement in Manipur in 1606 A.D.) and Meiteis into present Chittagong and Comilla (Bangladesh where there are presently an estimated 
<br />3 lakh Manipuris- both Muslims and Meiteis.
<br /><br />Racial Composition and Factor of Trading and Emigration Islam came to Burma more than 1,000 years ago through Muslim-Arab seafarers. 
<br /><br />Later there were many economic and political contacts with Muslim India and we read about Mughal soldiers serving the Buddhist kings of Burma. 
<br /><br />Pathan and Mughal soldiers from the nearby Bengal (now Bangladesh) acquired political and cultural influence in Arakan where we find Persian becoming a widely used language and some Arakanese kings adopting Muslim names like the Manipuri king Pamheiba took up the Persian name Gharib Niwaz (1709-48).
<br /><br />The British colonists began arriving in 1824 bringing with them Indian soldiers,
<br />officials and others. These included many Muslims. Many of these Muslims 
<br />married Burmese (both Muslim and Buddhist) women. Similarly early Manipuri Muslims married Meitei women. 
<br /><br />This produced a new generation of Indo-Burmese Muslims who had Burmese as their mother tongue, like in Manipur where Muslims adopted Meiteilon as mother-tongue, and Urdu as religious language. Thus mixed Muslim communities are found among the various Burmese races-Burman, Karen, Mon, Kachin, Chin, Shan etc. While the Manipuri Muslims are Indo-Mongoloids mixed with Turkic and Afghan ancestry.
<br /><br />There is also a sizable community of Chinese Muslims, Panthays, as well as Pashtus, Burmese, Malays, and in the southern tip of Burma. The present day Muslim community of Burma is thus a multi-racial community which forms a large community. Muslims are to be found in all walks of life and they are the single largest religious community in Burma, with mosques, schools and welfare associations. 
<br /><br />The first Chief Minister of post statehood Manipur in 1972 was a Muslim named Muhammad Alimuddin.
<br /><br />The Muslim community has taken part in all various stages of the Burmese country�s freedom struggle as well as in the country�s reconstruction after independence. (Also see Musa, Arabia, Nov. 1985, pp. 72-73).
<br /><br />Conversion in Eastern Bengal
<br />The larger classes of conversions in East Bengal were mainly voluntary, convictional (mainly to the soft preaching of Sufism) and many of them were from lower levels of Hindu. To this phenomenon must be attributed the mass conversion there that is now Bangladesh, whether we ascribe it to relief on the part of a Buddhist peasantry at deliverance from Brahman oppression or the straight conversion of a virtually animistic countryside. 
<br /><br />Such conversions were not confined to eastern Bengal, but all occurred all over the country.In general they were from all the classes; because Islam could offer to these people a hope and status denied to them (lower caste) in the Hindu system. The existence of Muslim Rajputs shows that in the Northwest (India) it occurred mainly in the upper strata of the society. These conversions were not produced by kings or soldiers that indeed introduced a new factor into the building up of the Muslim community. This factor is the Sufi movement (V. A. Smith, The Oxford History of India pp. 266).

<br /> A very brief biographical sketch by Bilal Raschid 
<br /><br />U Raschid a Burmese Muslim, of Indian parentage, was a very dear friend, and close associate, of Gen. Aung San in Burma’s struggle against British Colonial rule in Burma. 
<br /><br />Their friendship went back to the days when the Rangoon University Students’ Union (RUSU) brought together like-minded people to debate and discuss pressing issues of the day. It was here that the very close bonds developed in the mid 1930s, especially between Raschid, Aung San and U Nu.  
<br /><br />These three, along with Kyaw Nyein, Ko Ohn, Tha Hla and others captured the leadership of RUSU in 1935, with Nu becoming President, Raschid Vice-President, and Aung San editor of the Oway (the University Students’ magazine). 
<br /><br />The next year, Raschid was elected President of General Aung San &amp; U Raschid  - 1947   RUSU, while Aung San served as Vice-President, and Nyo Mya became editor of the Oway. 
<br /><br />(Raschid had served as the first General Secretary of RUSU at its founding in 1930.)        
<br /><br />The historic students’ strike of 1936, which was to become the key element in building the future leaders of independent Burma, took place under the leadership of Nu, Aung San, Raschid, and Kyaw Nyein. Dr. Maung Maung ( the former Attorney General) and for a few weeks President of Burma after the peoples uprising of 1988, in an article in the Guardian Magazine in 1956, wrote: “But the Strike of 1936 was a landmark in the nationalist movement in Burma, a distinct milestone. . . .Yet, there is not a soul to deny that if Ko Nu was the cause, in part, of the strike, and the inspirer and dreamer in the strike, it was M. A. Raschid who organized it and gave meaning and life to it. If it was Ko Nu who delivered the speeches, stars shining in his eyes, and moved the masses to anger or to tears, it was Raschid who organized the day to day affairs of the strike and gave sustenance to it after the early emotions and passions had cooled. If it was Ko Nu who thundered mightily against the University act, which was, he said, the very symbol of tyranny under which the students, nay, the peoples of Burma writhed in mortal agony, it was Raschid who read up the Act at midnight while the strikers slept on.”  Further on he writes, in the same article: “Let the historians therefore value the strike as they wish. Let them extol it to the moon. Or let them reduce it to near zero. Let them call it the movement, or a movement; let them call it the beginning, or the culmination, or let them say it was neither, but only a ripple in the ocean of the national struggle. Let the historians say what they wish, and argue wisely and hotly forever. But on one point they must concur: that Raschid was the soul of the Strike.”
<br /><br />When the strike ended, Raschid had emerged with a solid reputation. More, he had won good and loyal friends. The autograph book that U Raschid had during that period, has very interesting entries by the future leaders of Burma. U Nu wrote: “I love those who love Burma: I love those who are honourable . . . I have loved, respected and followed you.” Kyaw Nyein, who had strong ethnic prejudices, wrote: “The strikers camp – where Kalah meets Bamah”. And Aung San, who was always sparing in compliments, wrote this: “From M. A. San to M. A. Raschid, but no M.A. after our names. This is one point of resemblance between us – but others too, which you know of course. We two have served together on the University E. C. and perhaps will have to do so till our death.”
<br /><br />In his hand written notes to U Raschid, Aung San always started with “My dear Bhai ‘shid”, as an affectionate salutation. He often came to U Raschid’s home in Bow Lane, Rangoon, to discuss matters relating to the struggle against British Colonial rule with him. Aung San cancelled one of his Governor’s Council meetings in early 1947, when he was informed that U Raschid had returned to Burma, and was in Aung San’s office at the Secretariat to see him. Aung San had even written to Mr. Jawaharlal Nehru (one of India’s founding fathers, and its first Prime Minister) asking him to find U Raschid, and send him back to Burma.
<br /><br />U Raschid was elected the first President of the All Burma Students Union at its founding in 1936; and he had the unique distinction of being the only student leader to have served as president of both RUSU and the ABSU at the same time. After the 1936 strike, he was also elected to serve as the very first students’ representative on the governing University Council. He served in this capacity for many years after Burma became independent. Later, he became the first Chancellor of the University of Mandalay. 
<br /><br />During the time when Aung San was to be installed President of the ABSU, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru came on a visit to Burma. Raschid was elected Secretary of the Reception Committee. That was his first meeting with Nehru, and the beginning of a very close, life long friendship. 
<br /><br />His scholastic achievements were also distinctive. He matriculated from the Randeria High School in Rangoon, and stood first in the whole of Burma. He repeated this academic distinction when he graduated in Law from the University of Rangoon, standing first in the whole country. 
<br /><br />He was also a drafter of the first Constitution of Burma (1947); and was instrumental in getting Aung San to agree to amendments to certain sections, to ensure equal rights for all minorities. While he had refused Aung San’s request to serve on the Governor’s Council, he did accept an advisory position to Aung San. He would have been in the Council Chamber on July 19, 1947, had he not been sick that day, when the assassination of Aung San and his entire Shadow Cabinet, which included Sayagi U Razzak, took place.   
<br /><br />U Raschid was brought into successive Cabinets of Prime Minister U Nu. He was an acknowledged expert on labor matters, and so while other portfolios varied, he was always the Minister in charge of the Labor Ministry. And because of his expertise in this field he was elected President of the International Labor Conference in Geneva, in 1961. He had the distinction of also being the father of the Trade Union movement in Burma, having founded the very first labor union during the British days, called the Shop Assistants Welfare Society, of which he was President. He served for many years as Vice-President of the Trade Union Congress (Burma) (TUC<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cool.gif" alt=":)" />, with U Ba Swe as President. After the A.F.P.F.L. split, he was elected President of the newly formed Union Labour Organization. 
<br /><br />In the mid 1960s, Prime Minister U Nu wanted to send U Raschid as Burma’s Permanent Representative to the United Nations. But U Raschid’s devotion to the development of Burma and its people was more important to him. So he asked U Nu not to send him. Prime Minister U Nu then sent U Thant in his stead; and U Thant went on to become the Secretary General of the U.N., in which capacity he brought much honor to the country. 
<br /><br />During Burma’s democratic period he also became active in Muslim affairs. He was elected, and served for many years, as the President of the Burma Muslim Organization (BMO). However, like Aung San, he did not believe that politics and religion should be mixed. So the BMO was set up as a purely religious and social organization for the betterment of the Muslims of Burma. While his political affiliation and work took place as a part of the top leadership of the Anti-Fascist Peoples’ Freedom League (AFPFL). Through the BMO he set up a separate committee comprised of some of the top Muslim scholars to translate the Holy Quran into the Burmese language. This work took twenty-five years to complete. When he presented Prime Minister U Nu with a copy of Volume 1 of the newly translated Holy Quran, the Prime Minister, who was a Burmese scholar of some note himself, said after reading it, that the translation was a “landmark in the history of Burmese literature”. With a life-long interest in the education of Muslim youth, U Raschid, was very happy, and felt privileged to be invited to attend the first World Muslim Conference on Education, held in Jeddah, by the Saudi government. He had set up the Muslim Fund Trust in Burma, which provided scholarships to deserving Muslim students for higher studies, both within the country and abroad.
<br /><br />U Raschid was also fortunate to have married Fatima (Daw Thaung May), whose father Dr. (Capt.) N. A. Khan, was an Assistant Civil Surgeon in Thayetmyo at that time. They married of their own choice (a quite remarkable thing among Muslims at that time!). She became a very supportive and capable wife, whose life-long devotion to welfare work is quite well known to people of that generation. She served on the Boards of the Rangoon General Hospital, and most of the other Hospital run by the existing NGOs of that time. She was also on the Board of the Burma Red Cross; because of which she became a strong promoter of blood donation. She was instrumental in setting up the first blood bank at the Rangoon General Hospital in the early 1950s. As President of the National Council of women in Burma she oversaw the support and running of three maternity and child welfare clinics in Rangoon; and was also very involved with the Muslim Free Dispensary, as well as the Zinat Islam Muslim Boys’ Home (an orphanage for Muslim children from all over the country). 
<br /><br />After the military coup of 1962, U Raschid went through a six year period of detention. His “cell mate” at that time was U Myint Thein, the former Chief Justice of Burma. He was arrested again in 1974, and was released after 18 months, without any charge. The reason of his arrest being that there were some Muslim young men caught in a group that was planning to assassinate General Ne Win; and the Military Intelligence thought that U Raschid might be involved. U Raschid died in 1978, of prostate cancer, in Karachi, Pakistan, where he had gone to visit his son, Bilal, who had settled there with his family; and is buried there.

<br /><br />SOME QUOTES FROM OTHER SOURCES: 
<br /><br />U Nu, the first and only elected Prime Minister of Burma, wrote:  
<br /><br />“It was my good fortune to come across Hajee U Raschid in my university student days, and to work with him in the Executive Committee of the Rangoon University Students’ Union; and later in the Council of Ministers of the Government after the independence of Burma. . . .            
<br /><br />“He had a winning personality. Though he was not a Burman, he became very popular among the university students. they saw him not as an alien but as one of their own. This fact is borne (out) by te fact that the students unanimously, without contest, chose him as the president of the Rangoon University Students’ Union, as well as of the All-Burma Students’ Union. . .            
<br /><br />“Though born in India and had his roots there, Hajee U Raschid grew up, was educated and had worked in Burma among the Burmese. He, therefore, had great attachment to Burma and the Burmese and served their interests to the best of his ability, all the time he was in Burma. there is no doubt about it. we all, therefore, owe our thanks to him.”
<br /><br />Professor Hugh Tinker (The Union of Burma):            
<br /><br />“Fortunately, in U Nu the country has a leader big enough to tackle all these difficult tasks, while alongside him stand Ba Swe, Bo Ne Win, Kyaw Nyein, M. A. Raschid, and others who have been tried and not found wanting. . .
<br /><br />” And in a BBC broadcast commentary, in 1961:            
<br /><br />Speaking of the A.F.P.F.L.’s ‘Clean’ faction winning the election, he said: “U Nu really has only two lieutenants of stature, Dr. E. Maung and Mr. M. A. Raschid . . .”            And in an article titled “This Day and Age – Burma”, he expresses similar views, while writing about the “Clean AFPFL”’s victory in the 1961 elections: “His victory is welcome because it represents the free choice of the people of Burma. The Colonels did not attempt to influence events in favor of their Socialist friends. And the Socialist party machine did not produce an automatic majority. But U Nu faces the task of government with a perilously sparse number of firs-class lieutenants. Dr. E maung, the former Acting Chief Justice, and mr. M. A. Raschid, the veteran Cabinet Minister and business man, are both of the highest calibre. . . .
<br /><br />” Dr. Frank Trager (Head of the US Aid Team to Burma):         
<br /><br />In comments to Prime Minister U Nu (as narrated by the Prime Minister): “Mr. Trager called on me as Prime Minister, to bid farewell. At this meeting, Professor Trager told me that his delegation has decided to recommend more aid than they had intended; and that was because of the Burmese side leader U Raschid’s eloquence, persuasive powers and convincing presentation of the Burmese case.” 
<br /><br />‘Dagon’ Taya (Writer, poet, editor of the Dagon  magazine before the war,and Taya after):            
<br /><br />In the article “Politics Was His Sole Existence”, in the book “Aung San of Burma”, compiled and edited by Dr. Maung Maung: “Aung San could be highly emotional. I remember a meeting of the Rangoon University Students’ Union held to commemorate an anniversary of the strike. One Indian student stood up and strongly criticized Mr. Raschid, a former president of the Union, and Aung San, shaking with anger, waved his fists at the student and challenged  him to a fight.
<br /><br />” Justice William O. Douglas (Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court):
<br /><br />In his book titled “North from Malaya”, which he inscribed with these words in his own handwriting,
<br /><br />“For M. A. Raschid, with admiration and affection”, and presented U Raschid a copy, Justice Douglas writes: “I talked with the Minister for Housing and Labor, M. A. Raschid, who with the advice of American and European experts, has conceived what promises to be the brightest low-cost housing project anywhere in the world. Raschid has started it in seven cities and in one village in each of ten districts. The village projects are designed to create model modern villages, including schools.” 
<br /><br />The Geneva Diplomat, 15 June 1961, extract from an article titled “Raschid of Rangoon”:            “Burmese Minister of Labour, A. Raschid has been elected President of the 45th. International Labour Conference in Geneva, attended by more than 1,000 delegates from some 100 countries.            
<br /><br />Minister Raschid is one of the most respected men in international labour affairs. The choice could not have been a better one.            
<br /><br />Although Burma is predominantly a Buddhist country, Minister Raschid belongs to the Moslem minority of a country where the predominant characteristic of the people is tolerance.            
<br /><br />Last year, on that most delightful of Geneva’s institutions, the boat trip which the Genevois provide for the ILO delegates when the ILO conference winds up its affairs, Minister Raschid was gunning for us for a remark we used in describing an African delegate. When the misinterpretation was clarified we discovered that finally we had come across the real Voice of Asia who would defend to this utmost ability an African whom he considered to have been wronged. .

<br /><br />in the hands of Buddhists are ignored by Muslim countries
<br /><br />COMMENTS: Tamil and Burmese Muslim Rohingyas are dying in the Buddhists countries, Sri Lanka, Burma and Thailand. ‘Islamic’ countries shamelessly closed their mouths shut. The shouting and protest against Israel and USA, and the tears for the Palestinians  made them hypocrites because of their RACIAL DISCRIMINATIONS.
<br /><br />The struggle of the Tamil people in Sri Lanka to find a solution to self-autonomy and self- determination for their own land where they have lived there since times unknown cannot come under the purview of a Sinhala-dominated polity.
<br /><br />While there has been a lot of confusion over terrorism and the independence struggle, it is quite clear now that the Tamils in Sri Lanka do not come under the purview of terrorism anymore but stand distinctly as freedom fighters.
<br /><br />Richard Nixon called Yasser Arafat a terrorist and so did Ronald Reagan. But Bill Clinton and George Bush went on invite him into the White House and recognised him as a the leader of the Palestinians. If one were to review the pages of Life magazine, one would see lots of photographs proving Yasser as beyond doubt the champion of plane hijackers.
<br /><br />But I have always felt true to heart that the best way to initiate a struggle against oppression and social injustice is via non-violence. Mahatma Ghandi started his struggle some 80 years ago in South Africa against apartheid and eventually relieved India from the British.
<br /><br />This strategy also worked very well for Nelson Mandela in South Africa and for Martin Luther King Jr in the US.
<br /><br />While the Tamils have had always preferred peaceful coexistence with the Sinhalese, the Sinhala government has always preferred to imbue dominance over the Tamils.
<br /><br />The late prime minister of Sri Lanka, Dr Bandaranayake, coming from an Anglican family, converted to become a Buddhist and started his campaign of covertly and overtly orchestrating the ‘political decapitation’ of the Tamils who were then in dominance in the businesses, civil service and education sectors in Sri Lanka.
<br /><br />The seeds of hatred were sown by the incapable leaders of the Sinhalese who could not devise adequate plans to uplift the socially and economically downtrodden Sinhalese people. Hence, they chose to disintegrate the world of the hardworking Tamils and made them become second- class citizens in their own land.
<br /><br />In 1973, Father Sebastian Pillai called for defiance of the Sinhalese-dominated Sri Lanka and ever since then there has been no end to the struggle of the Tamils for various options including a political solution, a self-autonomous region and finally a separate land.
<br /><br />Back in 1983, when I was studying in the Netherlands, I had the opportunity to meet the late Katheeswaran Loganathan who was campaigning against the LTTE.
<br /><br />That particular Sunday, I had come back from giving a talk in the city of Harlem to about 300 Sri Lankan Tamils who had come from various parts of Europe and belonging to various groups and factions of the Tamil struggle for Tamil Eelam.
<br /><br />Katheeswaran was angry with me for supporting the cause of the Tamils. I told him: ‘I am a Tamil and how can I disdain the struggle of our own people? This is a fight for self- determination and one cannot submit to the will of dominance unless there is integrity in the government to show genuineness for the cause of the minority’.
<br /><br />He never spoke to me after that and even refused to shake hands with me during our graduation ceremony from the same institute. I thought he was politically immature. Later on, when he organised the Bhutan Talks between the various factions and the Sri Lankan government leaving the LTTE isolated, I did not wish to get involved. I was already back in Malaysia.
<br /><br />On my way back from my studies, I stopped at Chennai and had a meeting with the renowned Sri Lankan parliamentarian and leader of the Tamil democratic movement of Sri Lanka.
<br /><br />The late Appapillai Amirthalingam was virtually living in Chennai as a political guest of the then chief minister of Tamil Nadu, MG Ramachandran. He, too, instigated that I convey his message of peaceful coexistence to the dissident groups, which believed in self autonomy but by then the leader of LTTE, Vellupillai Prabhakaran, had already declared the call for a separate land.
<br /><br />As I visited some of the refugee camps in Mandamam in Tamil Nadu along with some of my friends, the number of refugees from across the Palk Strait had already increased. The war had begun.
<br /><br />The leaders who believed in political solutions were not integrated and one by one were assassinated either by the Tamil or Sinhalese side. The assassination of the former prime minister of Sri Lanka, Ranasinghe Premadasa, Lalith Adulya Mudali and the blinding of one eye of the another prime minister Chandrika Bandaranayake were indeed a heavy price for the Sinhalese.
<br /><br />On the side of the Tamils, Padmanabhan of the EPRLF, Uma Mahewaran of Plot and Sabaratnam of Eros were one by one assassinated leaving behind the LTTE as the only supreme representative of the Tamils. However, one cannot forget the greatest loss for India in this struggle, the assassination of the then prime minister of India, Rajiv Ghandi.
<br /><br />It was a great price for India to pay for a messed-up foreign policy devised by the then foreign minister, the late Narashima Rao in getting involved on the side of the Sri Lankan government.
<br /><br />Over 70,000 people on both sides have been killed in the war in Sri Lanka. It has been waging for the last forty years now and it cannot be placed second to the cause of the Palestinian struggle for self-determination.
<br /><br />While we believe the Palestinians have every right to self-determination, we must also be ready to acknowledge the same for the Tamils in Tamil Eelam.
<br /><br />Over a hundred million Tamils live on the planet and it is almost certainthat all Tamils believe that the international community must now provide the same recognition for the Tamil issue in Sri Lanka as it gives to the Palestinian issue in Israel.
<br /><br />The UN Human Rights Commission head, Navaneetham Pillay, must now directly get involved as she did in resolving the human rights violations in Rwanda-Burund. She must place before the UN Security Council her independent report on Sri Lanka.
<br /><br />The UN must reckon that a political solution is needed and call for both leaders to talk further on how to work out an acceptable solution. The Tamil issue is critically important as the Palestinian issue.

<br /><br />Burmese Muslim sources said that troops ordered Mohamed Ilyas, an MP representing Maungdaw, and four other MPs, to cross into Bangladesh and try to persuade Burmese Muslim refugees to return home. When they refused, the soldiers arrested and beat the MPs, killing Ilyas. Almost 300,000 Burmese Muslims have fled since last year, alleging army persecution.

<br />•	Myanmar Muslim activists

Especially Dr Kyaw Nyein had a very good relation with the very powerful and famous Mandalay Young Buddhist Monks and to some extent successful in countering the agent provocateurs from inciting the anti Muslim sentiments. Because of his request, real monks influential in Mandalay searched and confiscated and destroyed nearly hundred thousand anti-Muslim pamphlets allegedly distributed the Myanmar Military secret agents.

His refurbished buses and trucks hit the roads and he was ‘invited’ into the jail for questioning for few months for his efficiency to repair the damaged vehicles so quickly. He was arrested once because of that kind of efficiency, for the crime of finishing his own house in front of the prolonged project of building the new parliament building. Because he built his house with three shifts of workers day and night, General Ne Win became jealous and ordered to arrest him to inquire how he managed to get the required raw material for the construction. And he was arrested few times without any trial when the number twos in the governments or any other high ranking officials were required to remove from their positions. They were unofficially alleged to have connection with that wealthy man and were said to be not fit to hold high posts. But strangely, the probes or investigations always had to stop before other VIPs were implicated. Obviously, the almost bankrupt authorities needed U Shaw Phi’s skills and wealth.

Suffering bitterness of dictatorship and our life become so hard to survive. Even struggling our best and sacrificing our lives but still we are unsure the distance to our freedom. When we look at the face of our innocent children, it feel pang in our heart. They don’t know what their parents are suffering and the nation where their future is totally dark. What will happen when they realize their life is so much oppressed. How can we leave our love ones in such cruel dictator’s hand? If we cannot leave any wealth for our love ones but at least we should have to leave good future for them.
<br />	The most heart breaking is while all citizens are struggling to survive and working so hard to spare some piece of food for the family but in the other hand, sons of Generals are tired-less wasting their parent’s illegal and unlawful money in night club and ect….  There are many public hospitals without medicines and but in the military hospitals are full of latest equipments. Even though, most of the Generals use to go to Singapore for just minor treatment. 
<br />               It is really plaintive to compare with the time before1962 and current situation of Burma. Our country was golden age that time. It is three generation now that we are living in oppressed in this regime. It is useless if we blame to our predecessors or to each other but we must do our best not to be blamed by our coming generation. It is also insufficient that we just hoping and depending on the Western countries pressure on them but it is our duty to fight for our birth rights. We are the destiny of our nation. We should have to keep moving forward. Our patience and silence should not consider that we are afraid of their cruelty. While we have sacrificed our love ones, their blood should not be waste. They do their duty and now it is our turn. Our nation will never change or progress unless we are steadfast and firm in our revolution. The bloods of Martyrs are never wasted.  
<br />            	The willingness of cooperation with military regime and constant support in any circumstances, it is clearly reflecting that we are now in indirectly colonized by our neighboring selfish countries. What make us surprise is such cruel and ruthless regime could survive in this generation of mankind. They are still respected by neighboring countries. This regime is not only cruel and rapist but also they betray their own people and country. To get support from neighboring countries they are supplying our natural resources in cheap and lowest rate and those neighbors they are looting our resources. But in the other side our peoples are living in such poverty and oppressed life, “what about the future” it is totally blank. Once it was rice bowl of Asia but now there is no food to eat. There are rice crops everywhere in Burma but it is not for us. It is for export by the company which belongs to the families of generals.
<br />	I seek apology but allow me to express our lament. We do respect and trust United Nation but it is the place where our bloods stain complains are meaningless in front of some evil countries Veto. This is the place where our hope and dream broken into pieces. The smells of bloods are still in the streets and monasteries. The wails of Burmese peoples are still there but mistakenly it knocks the door of slumber.
