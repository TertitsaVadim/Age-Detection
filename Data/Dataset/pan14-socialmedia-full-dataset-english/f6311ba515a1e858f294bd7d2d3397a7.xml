		<document id="ba794edd1dc288499572dbc3d061dab9" url=""><![CDATA[Wonder...<br/><br/>I sometimes wonder if i am ever loved at some point of times.  Sometimes i feel that i am not loved by my parents or family, because they all gang up on me.  Sometimes I feel that i am the only one that doesn't matter in my family or in any of my friendships.  Sometimes I wonder if i derserved to live.  I kinda think that being dead is better than living.  I never know wat to do in my life other than wanting to be an RN, but will anyone notice if i succeeded in life or fail in wat i want to be in.  I even feel like i am a nobody in life, and that nobody ever cares what i do.  Will they know if i runaway, or if i commit suicide.  Do I belong in the world? Will anyone care for me for who i am?  I have no clue but should i find out if i do or even that i am ever loved by the ones i love.  I shell not know, because i am not sure wat to do in my life!
