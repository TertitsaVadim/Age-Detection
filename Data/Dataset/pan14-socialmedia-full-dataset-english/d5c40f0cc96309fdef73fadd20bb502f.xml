<br />There could be fog
<br />Or maybe just a mist
<br />And inexplicably I'll fade to white
<br />Vanish, and be gone
<br /><br />Or it could be night
<br />And I'll be darkly dressed,
<br />Evading easy definition
<br />And as your eye's distracted
<br />By a falling leaf
<br />I'll merge with restless shadows
<br />And be gone
<br /><br />Then you will discover
<br />What emptiness is
<br /><br />A space so hollow
<br />Even its own walls are swallowed up
<br /><br />A quality of missing
<br />So intense
<br />A lack, a lack
<br /><br />Each hour more bottomless than the last
<br />Until your heart cries out,
<br />A howl of forfeiture
<br /><br />But it will be nothing
<br />Ashen silence where I used to sing
<br />And deafness
<br /><br />The howl must strike the right resonant frequency
<br />A wail that echoes all to the ends of time
<br />To fill the gaping void in whole, looping wavelengths
<br />From the well of your soul, such loneliness
<br />To make Siberian wolves hang heads for shame
<br />In their convivial packs
<br /><br />Then, only then
<br />Might you detect my footprints, indistinct
<br />Marking the morning dew fall
<br /><br />Perhaps glimpse a puff of breath
<br />in the cold, dawn air
<br /><br />You must utter
<br />A howl so desolate, it
<br /><br />Jerks you from your sleep
<br />To find me warm beside you on your pillow
<br /><br />And you will know how
<br />Close you were to the brink
<br />Of the abyss
<br /><br />And know what missing is
<br />And hold me.

<br />It is simply to hard to do.
<br />Like the stars and the moon 
<br />Stand out in the sky,
<br />You stand out in my life.
<br />Like the rays of the sun complete the sky, 
<br />You complete my life.
<br /><br />I can't stop loving you...
<br />It's too hard to do. 
<br />I ask myself, why do I deserve 
<br />Once again to be put through hell,
<br />when all I did was love you? 
<br />I will always love you...
<br /><br />I believe my heart will always be in your hands.
<br />My soul and my life will always be a part of yours.
<br /><br />I simply can't stop loving you...
