<br />All i want is for it to go back,
<br />I wish i had a dime,
<br />For every time i ruined a perfect thing and thats a fact,
<br />I wish it was easy,
<br />But thats life,
<br />Not nice and breezy,
<br />I wish i had a knife,
<br />Dont judge me,
<br />I aint done that since forever,
<br />Why cant you see,
<br />That it's still never,
<br />Why'd it go all wrong?,
<br />Why did it happen?,
<br />Just like a song,
<br />That has no ending,
<br />I wish it did,
<br />I wish it was over,
<br />Im just a kid,
<br />As long as im sober,
<br />I'll see the light,
<br />I step to see,
<br />I think it might,
<br />Turn the key and find out,
<br />If someone's waiting or if im still alone..

<br />Look into these eyes
<br />Then you'll see the size of these flames
<br />Dwellin on the past
<br />Its burnin' up my brain
<br />Everyone that burns has to learn from the pain
<br />Hey I think about the day
<br />My girlie ran away with my pay
<br />When fellas come to play
<br />No she stuck with my homeez that she fucked
<br />And I'm just a sucker with a lump in my throat
<br />Hey, like a chump
<br />Should I be feelin' bad? No
<br />Should I be feelin good? No
<br />Its kinda sad I'm the laughin' stock of the neighborhood
<br />You would think that I'd be movin' on
<br />But I'm a sucker like I said
<br />Fucked up in the head, not!!
<br />Maybe she just made a mistake
<br />I should give her a break
<br />My heart will ache either way
<br />Hey, what the hell
<br />Watcha want me to say
<br />I wont lie that I cant deny
<br /><br />[Chorus]
<br />I did it all for the nookie
<br />C'mon
<br />The nookie 
<br />C'mon
<br />So you can take that cookie
<br />And stick it up your, yeah!!
<br />Stick it up your, yeah!!
<br />Stick it up your, yeah!!
<br />Why did it take so long?
<br />Why did I wait so long, huh
<br />To figure it out? but I did it
<br />And I'm the only one underneath the sun who didn't get it
<br />I cant believe that I can be deceived
<br />By my so called girl, but in reality
<br />Had hidden agenda
<br />She put my tender heart in a blender
<br />And still I surrendered
<br />Hey, like a chump 
<br /><br />[chorus]
<br /><br />I'm only human
<br />Its so easy for your friends to give you their advice
<br />They tell you to let it go
<br />But its easier said then done
<br />I appreciate it
<br />I do, but just leave me alone
<br />Leave me alone
<br />Just leave me alone!!
<br />Just leave me alone!
<br />Aint nothin' gonna change
<br />If you can go away
<br />Im just gonna stay here and always be the same
<br />Aint nothin' gonna change
<br />If you can go away
<br />Im just gonna stay here and always be the same
<br />Aint nothin' gonna change
<br />If you can go away
<br />Im just gonna stay here and always be the same

<br /><br />I'm on my way
<br />I'm on my way
<br />Home sweet home
<br /><br />I guess that I've seen (Seem)
<br />To many romantic dreams (To Make romantic dreams)
<br />Up in lights, fallin' off
<br />The silver screen
<br /><br />My heart's like an open book
<br />For the whole world to read
<br />Sometimes nothing-keeps me together
<br />At the seams
<br /><br />I'm on my way
<br />I'm on my way
<br />Home sweet home
<br />I'm on my way
<br />I'm on my way
<br />Home
<br /><br />It's a bittersweet symphony, this life
<br />Just trying to make ends meet
<br />You're a slave to the money then you die
<br /><br />Theres no change, I can change
<br />I can change, I can change
<br />But I'm here in my mind
<br />I am here in my mind
<br />And I'm a million different people
<br />from one day to the next
<br />I can't change my mind
<br />No, no, no, no, no
<br /><br />I'm on my way
<br />I'm on my way
<br />Home sweet home
<br />I'm on my way
<br />I'm on my way
<br />Home sweet home
<br />I'm on my way
<br />I'm on my way
<br />Home

<br />To be the bad man
<br />To be the sad man
<br />Behind blue eyes

<br />To be faded to telling only lies
<br /><br />But my dreams they aren't as empty
<br />As my conscious seems to be
<br />I have hours, only lonely
<br />My love is vengeance
<br />That's never free
<br /><br />No one knows what it's like
<br />To feel these feelings
<br />Like I do, and I blame you!
<br />No one bites back as hard
<br />On their anger
<br />None of my pain woe
<br />Can show through

<br />No one knows what its like
<br />To be mistreated, to be defeated
<br />Behind blue eyes
<br />No one knows how to say

<br />I'm not telling lies
<br /><br />But my dreams they aren't as empty

<br />If I could touch your body 
<br />I know not everybody 
<br />Has gotta body like me 
<br />But I gotta think twice 
<br />Before I give my heart away 
<br />And I know all the games you play 
<br />Because I play them too 
<br />Oh, but I need some time off 
<br />From that emotion 
<br />Time to pick my heart up off the floor 
<br />When that love comes down 
<br />Without devotion 
<br />Well it takes a strong man baby 
<br />But I'm showin' you that door 
<br />Well I gotta have faith 
<br />Gotta have faith - 3x 
<br />Baby, I know you're askin' me to stay 
<br />Say please, please, please don't go away 
<br />Cuz you're givin' me the blues 
<br />Maybe, you might mean all the words you say 
<br />Can't help but think of yesterday 
<br />And another who tied me down to the loverboy blues 
<br />Before this river becomes an ocean 
<br />Before you pick my heart up off the floor 
<br />When our love comes down 
<br />Without devotion 
<br />Well it takes a stong man baby 
<br />But I'm showing you that door 
<br />Well I gotta have faith 
<br />Gotta have faith - 3x 
<br />Get the fuck up! 
<br />Well I gotta have faith 
<br />Gotta have faith - repeat to end

<br />All the little girls fillin' up the world today
<br />With the good comes the bad
<br />The bad comes the good
<br />But I'm a live my life like I should (like I should)
<br /><br />Now all the critics wanna hit it
<br />And shit can't get how we did it (??<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/unsure.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />Just because they don't get it
<br />But I'll stay fitted
<br />New Era committed
<br />Now this red cap
<br />Gets a rap from these critics
<br /><br />Do we always gotta cry (always gotta cry)
<br />Do we always gotta live inside a lie (inside a lie)
<br />Life's just a blast
<br />It's just movin' really fast
<br />Better stay on top of life
<br />I'll kick you in the ass
<br /><br />Follow me into a solo
<br />Remember that, kid
<br />So whatch you wanna do
<br />And where you gonna run
<br />When you're staring down the cable
<br />Of my fuckin' mic
<br />Pointed at your grill like a gun
<br /><br />Limp Bizkit is rockin' the set
<br />It's like Russian Roulette
<br />When you're placin' your bet
<br />So don't be upset
<br />When you're broke and your done
<br />Cause I'm a be the one til I jet
<br /><br />(chorus)
<br />I know why you want to hate me
<br />I know why you want to hate me
<br />I know why you want to hate me
<br />Cause hate, is all the world has even seen lately
<br />I know why you want to hate me (want to hate me)
<br />I know why you want to hate me (want to hate me)
<br />Now I know why you want to hate me
<br />Cause hate, is all the world has even seen lately
<br />And now you want to hate me
<br />Cause hate, is all the world has even seen lately
<br />And now you want to hate me
<br />Cause hate, is all the world has even seen lately
<br /><br />Does anybody really know the secret
<br />Or the combonation for this life
<br />And where they keep it
<br />It's kinda sad when you don't know the meanin'
<br />But everything happens for a reason (everything happens for a reason)
<br />I don't even know what I should say
<br />Cause I'm an idiot
<br />A loser
<br />A microphone abuser
<br />I analyze every second I exist
<br />Beatin' up my mind every second with my fist
<br /><br />And everybody wanna run (wanna run)
<br />Everybody wanna hide from the gun (hide from the gun)
<br />You can take a ride
<br />Through this life
<br />If you want 
<br />But you can't take the edge off the knife (no sir)
<br />And now you want your money back (money back)
<br />But you're denied
<br />Cause you're brain's fried from the sack
<br />And there ain't nothin' I can do
<br />Cause life is a lesson
<br />You learn it when you're through
<br /><br />(chorus)
<br />I know why you want to hate me
<br />I know why you want to hate me
<br />I know why you want to hate me
<br />Cause hate, is all the world has even seen lately

<br />Now I know why you want to hate me
<br />Cause hate, is all the world has even seen lately
<br />And now you want to hate me
<br />Cause hate, is all the world has even seen lately
<br />And now you want to hate me
<br />Cause hate, is all the world has even seen lately
<br /><br />Shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
<br />Now, I, Know, Why
<br />Now, I, Know, Why (I know why you want to hate me)
<br />Now, (Now I know why you want to hate me) I,
