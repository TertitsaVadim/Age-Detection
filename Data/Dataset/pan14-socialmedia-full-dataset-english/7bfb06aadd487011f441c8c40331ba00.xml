The Spring Festival falls on Jan 1st in lunar calendar.  It originated in the Shang Dynasty for the people sacrificing the gods and ancestors at the end of the old year and the beginning of a new year.
<br /><br />Strictly speaking, the Spring Festival starts in the early December in lunar calendar and closes in the middle of January every year.  On the eighth day of the twelfth lunar month, people use glutinous rice, millet, gingko, longan, job’s tears, lotus nut, jujube berry, beans to make the delicious laba porridge.  In the same time, people begin to clean the indoor and outdoor of their houses.  After that, they begin to decorate their houses with Spring Festival couplets, Chinese calligraphy in black characters written on red papers, hang the red lanterns in front of the doors
<br /><br />At the same time, people are busy to purchase necessities for the New Year.  The necessities not only including rice, edible, flour, chicken, fish, meat and duck, but also including fruit, candy and all kinds of nuts.  Furthermore, people will purchase new clothes, shoes for the children, themselves, and the gifts for friends, relatives and the elderly.
<br /><br />The 23rd day of the twelfth lunar month is called Preliminary Eve.  On this day, people offer sacrifice to the kitchen god.  After the Preliminary Eve, people are looking forward for the coming Spring Festival Eve.
<br /><br />People attach great importance to Spring Festival Eve.  In the Spring Festival Eve, all family members have their dinner together. The dinner is more luxurious than usual. Dishes include chicken, fish, Lettuce etc.  In Chinese, their pronunciations are &quot;ji&quot;, &quot;yu&quot; and &quot;sheng cai,&quot; mean auspiciousness, abundance and richness.  After the dinner, the whole family will sit together, chatting and watching TV.  In recent years, the Spring Festival party broadcasts on China Central Television Station (CCTV).  Many people will stay up for the coming New Year.
<br /><br />In the morning of the New Year, everybody dresses up.  After that, they express the best regards to their parents, and then, the children will get the red pockets from the elder.  In some areas, such as Guangdong province, the singles can get the red pockets from the married people.  In northern China, People will eat dumplings (jiaozi) as breakfast, as jiaozi in pronunciation means bidding farewell to the old and ushering in the new.  In southern China, people will eat niangao (New Year cake made of glutinous rice flour).  In recent years, most of the people in Guangdong province will have their morning tea with their families or friends in the morning of the New Year.  From the second day of the New Year, people will bring fruits, candies, nuts to visit their relatives, friends, classmates and the colleagues.
<br /><br />The lively atmosphere not only fills into every family, but also permeates to streets and lanes.  A series of activities, such as lion dancing, dragon lantern dancing, lantern festivals and temple fairs will be held.  The Spring Festival will be ended on the Lantern Festival.
<br /><br />China has 56 ethnic groups.  Generally, Minorities celebrate their Spring Festival as the same as the Han.  However, there is less difference with the Hans’ cultures.

Peking Opera has a 200-year-long history.  Peking opera was evolved from the Kunqu Opera, an even more ancient art of drama. The latter was listed among the first batch of mankind’s representative works of oral and nonmaterial heritage by the UNESCO in May 2001.
<br /><br />In ancient times, Peking Opera was performed mostly on stage in the open air, temple courtyards or teahouses.  Since the orchestra played loudly, the performers developed a piercing style of song that could be heard by everyone.  The costumes were a garish collection of sharply contrasting colors to stand out on the dim stage illuminated only by oil lamps.  Peking Opera is a harmonious combination of the Grand Opera, acrobatics and ballet, consisting of monologues, martial arts, dance, dialogue and mime.
<br /><br />The Peking Opera band mainly consists of an orchestra and percussion band.  The former frequently accompanies peaceful scenes while the latter provides the right atmosphere for battle scenes.  The commonly used percussion instruments include castanets, drums, bells and cymbals.  One person usually plays the castanets and drum simultaneously, which conduct the entire band.  The orchestral instruments include the Erhu, Huqin, Yueqin, Sheng (reed pipe), Pipa (lute) and other instruments.  The band usually sits on the left side of the stage.
<br /><br />With its fascinating and artistic accompanying music, singing and costumes, the Peking Opera is China's national opera.  Full of Chinese cultural facts, the opera presents the audience with an encyclopedia of Chinese culture, as well as unfolding stories, beautiful paintings, exquisite costumes, graceful gestures and martial arts.  Since Peking Opera enjoys a higher reputation than other local operas, almost every province in China has more than one Peking Opera troupes. Opera is so popular among Chinese people, especially seniors.

		<document id="eecad37a72e62268e0ef96a8d3e216dc" url=""><![CDATA[Chinese Traditional Culture?Peking Opera-2<br/><br/>We have introduced the origin and the general performance of Peking Opera in the last blog.  As below, there are some details about the Peking Opera.
<br /><br />Lavish costumes of Peking Opera include opera headdress or Toukui (scarf, helmet, crown and hat), about 20 kinds costume (the armor for soldiers, the ceremonial and informal robe etc), Opera shoes and boots.  
<br /><br />The characters have to paint their faces before perform.  We call it facial painting.  It is said that this special art derived from Chinese opera has different origins.  However, no matter what its origin, facial painting is worth appreciating for its artistic value.  The paintings are representations of the characters' roles.  For example, a white face symbolizes a sinister, treacherous and guile character, a green face connotes surly stubbornness, impetuosity and lack of self-restraint and a red face usually depicts heroic bravery, uprightness and loyalty.  In addition, facial painting patterns reveal information about a character.  As well, essentially, the unique makeup allows characters on stage to reveal them voicelessly.  Audiences can distinguish a character's sex and status at the first glance by the type of headdress, robes, shoes and baldrics associated with the role.
<br /><br />Peking Opera performers mainly have two types of facial decorations: masks and facial painting.  The frequent on-stage changing of masks or facial makeup (without the audience noticing) is a special technique known as changing faces.
<br /><br />Changing faces is a difficult technique in operatic performance.  It is considered to be a stunt that can only be mastered after extensive training.  Face changing is also a special technique used to exaggerate inner feelings of characters, portray their dispositions, set off the atmosphere and improve effects.  Facial changes expressing sudden changes in a character's feelings are done in four ways:
<br />Mop: The actor mops out the greasepaint hidden in his sideburns or eyebrows, around his eyes and nose, to change his facial appearance.
<br /><br />Manipulating beard: Beard colors can be changed while the beard is being manipulated, from black to gray and finally to white, expressing anger or excitement.
<br /><br />Blowing dust: The actor blows black dust hidden in his palm or close to his eyes, nose or beard, so that it blows back into his face.
<br /><br />Pulling-down masks: The actor can pull down a mask that has previously been hidden on top of his head, leaving his face red, green, blue or black to communicate happiness, hate, anger or sadness respectively. 
<br /><br />The main Roles in Peking Opera fall into four categories: Dan, Sheng, Jing and Chou.  The roles have the natural features of sex and age, as well as social status, and are artificially exaggerated by makeup, costume and gestures.
<br /><br />Female Role (Dan): Qing Yi (modest, virtuous), Hua Dan (flirtatious, playful), Gui Men Dan (young, married girl), Dao Ma Dan (strong woman, female general), Wu Dan (female acrobat), Lao Dan (old woman).
<br /><br />Male Role (Sheng): civil, military; Lao Sheng (old man with a beard: dignified, polished, official, scholar); Xiao Sheng (young man, shrill voice, young warrior, young man of society, stature, elaborate dress), Wu Sheng (acrobatic male, extremely agile and physically skilled).
<br /><br />Painted Face Male (Jing): Spectators are usually startled by the appearance of the Jing. His facial colors symbolize the type of character, red symbolizes good, white symbolizes treacherous etc.
<br /><br />Comedy Actor or Clown (Chou): amusing, rascal, occasionally slightly wicked.

The name &quot;cheongsam,&quot; meaning simply &quot;long dress,&quot; entered the English vocabulary from the dialect from one of the china’s provinces: Guangdong Province (Cantonese).  In other parts of the country including Beijing, however, it is known as &quot;qipao&quot;, which has a history behind it.
<br /><br />When the Manchu ruled China during the Qing Dynasty, certain social strata emerged. Among them were the Banners (qí), mostly Manchu, who as a group were called Banner People.  The Manchu women wore normally a one-piece dress which, likewise, came to be known as &quot;qipao&quot; or &quot;banner dress.&quot;  Although the 1911 Revolution toppled the rule of the Qing (Manchu) Dynasty, Han Chinese women wear loose jacket and trousers, with an overskirt for formal occasions.  The qipao was a new fashion item for Han Chinese women when they started wearing it around 1925.  Qipao has become the traditional dress for Chinese women. 
<br /><br />The original qipao was wide and loose. It covered most of the woman's body, revealing only the head, hands, and the tips of the toes.  The baggy nature of the clothing also served to conceal the figure of the wearer regardless of age.  With time, though, the qipao were tailored to become more form fitting and revealing.  The modernized version is noted for accentuating the figures of women, and as such was popular as a dress for high society.  As Western fashions changed, the basic cheongsam design changed too, introducing high-necked sleeveless dresses, bell-like sleeves, and the black lace frothing at the hem of a ball gown.  
<br /><br />By the 1940s, cheongsam came in a wide variety of fabrics with an equal variety of accessories.  The 1949 Communist Revolution curtailed the popularity of the cheongsam and other fashions in Shanghai, but the Shanghainese emigrants and refugees brought the fashion to Hong Kong where it has remained popular.  Recently there has been a revival of the Shanghainese cheongsam in Shanghai and elsewhere in Mainland China.  The Shanghainese style functions now mostly as a stylish party dress.
<br /><br />Nowadays, in some areas of China, cheongsams are worn by the brides in the wedding.  The bride will change her wedding dress to cheongsam after entered the bridegroom’s home.

Traditionally incest has been defined as marriage between people with the same surname.  From the perspective of a Confucian family, marriage brings together families of different surnames and so continues the family line of the paternal clan.  This is generally why having a boy is more preferred than a girl when giving birth.  Therefore, the benefits and demerits of any marriage are important to the entire family, not just the individual couples.  Socially, the married couple is thought to be the basic unit of society.  In Chinese history there have been many times when marriages have affected the country’s political stability and international relations. From the Han Dynasty onward, the rulers of certain powerful foreign tribes such as the Mongolians, the Manchus, the Xiongnu and the Turks demanded women from the Imperial family. Many periods of Chinese history were dominated by the families of the wife or mother of the ruling Emperor.
<br /><br />Traditional Chinese wedding ceremony became a custom at Warring States period, between 402 and 221 BC. Despite China's long history and many different geographical areas, there are essentially six rituals, generally known as the three letters and six etiquettes.  This is the elaborate process on the groom's parents' part to look for the right kind of bride for their family.  Rich families will look for a bride who can take care of household finances and most importantly, give birth to sons to inherit the wealth of the family.  Poor families will look for a bride who can work hard in the fields and give birth to sons to help out on the farm.  Hence, the Chinese saying: bamboo door is to bamboo door as wooden door is to wooden door. 
<br /><br />In the old days, all communication was through formal letters.  Therefore, the letters play an important role in the events.  The three letters included request letter, gift letter and wedding letter.  Request letter confirmed the formal arrangement of a marriage.  It was sent by the groom's family to the bride's family.  This letter was normally presented with the initial gifts for the bride's family.  Gift letter accompanied the formal gifts for the Bride's family.  It was actually a gift list that records the description and quantity of the gifts.  Wedding letter was presented to the bride's family on the day of the wedding.  It confirmed the act of bringing the bride into the groom's family.
<br /><br />The Chinese word for etiquette can mean both customs and gifts. The following customs are known as the Six Etiquette.  They are request for marrying the bride, request for bride and groom's birth dates, initial gifts for the bride's family, formal gifts for the bride's family, select the wedding date and wedding day.
<br /><br />In the next blog, I will introduce the procedures before the wedding and the detail on the wedding day.  Please wait…….

		<document id="78cfcbb0b707633a3d35bb6f467a0c9c" url=""><![CDATA[Ancient Marriage Customs in China-2<br/><br/>In the last blog, we introduced the origin and the general custom about the ancient marriage in China.  In this blog, let us go to the procedures before wedding and the detail on the wedding day.
<br /><br />In preparation for her impending departure, the bride retreated from the ordinary routine and lived in seclusion in a separate part of the house with her closest friends.  During this period, the young women sang laments, mourning the bride’s separation from her family.  Since this extended ‘sleep over’ often took place in the loft, the bride’s emergence on her wedding day was sometimes referred to as &quot;coming out of the loft.&quot; 
<br /><br />On the part of the groom, he prepared to install the bridal bed on the day before wedding.  A propitious hour and a ‘good luck woman’ or ‘good luck man’, that is a man or women with many children and living mates, were selected to install a newly purchased bed.  The installation ceremony consisted of merely moving the bed slightly; the actual work was done by servants or friends.
<br /><br />After the bed had been installed, children were invited onto the bed as an omen of fertility. For the same reason, the bed was scattered with red dates, lotus seeds, oranges, pomegranates, peanuts and other fruits.  It is fun to see the children scramble for fruits.
<br /><br />At dawn on her wedding day or the night before wedding, the bride bathed in water infused with pumelo, a variety of grapefruit, to cleanse her of evil influences, and one suspect as a cosmetic to soften her skin in this way. She put on new underclothes and sat before the lit dragon-and phoenix candles.  A ‘good luck woman’ spoke auspicious words while dressing the bride’s hair in the style of a married woman. 
<br />After her hair was styled, the bride emerged from her retreat.  She was carried to the main hall on the back of the ‘good luck’ woman or her most senior sister-in-law.  There she donned a jacket and skirt and stepped into a pair of red shoes, placed in the center of a sieve.  The bride’s face was covered with either a red silk veil or a ‘curtain’ of tassels or beads that hung from the bridal Phoenix crown. 
<br /><br />After completing her wedding preparations, the bride bowed to her parents and to the ancestral tablets and awaited the arrival of the bridal procession from the groom’s home. 
<br />In the other hand, the groom dressed in a long gown, red shoes and a red silk sash with a silk ball on his shoulder, he knelt at the family altar while his father placed a cap decorated with cypress leaves on his head. 
<br /><br />The groom bowed first before the tablets of Heaven and Earth and his ancestors, then to his parents and the assembled family members. His father removed the silk ball from the sash and placed it on top of the bridal sedan chair. 
<br /><br />On the wedding day, both the bride and the groom's house will be decorated in red.  The groom's family will send out a procession of servants, musicians and a carriage which is carried by eight servants to the bride's family to bring the bride back.  The bride will then be brought back to the groom's house and the two will perform the marriage cermony witnessed by all the relatives and friends. 
<br /><br />The bride and groom will worship the heavens and the earth, the groom's ancestors and they will also serve tea to all of their superiors in the family.  After that, the superiors will give them red pockets with monetary gifts and wish them well.  The groom's family will then throw a huge feast (if they can afford it) for the friends and relatives to celebrate the wedding.  All along, the spokeswoman will oversee the whole process and keep toasting the couple. 
<br /><br />After the meal, the newly wed couple will return to the bridal room and some naughty friends may tag-along and play tricks on the groom.  When all is done, the couple will drink and toast and the spokeswoman will offer sweets and fruits to the couple to wish them long life and lots of kids.  Then, the couple will finally be left with themselves and the groom can take off the red cloth that covers the bride's face. 
<br /><br />On the day after the wedding, the bride awoke early to attend honor the ancestors at dawn.  It was only then that she was then formally introduced to the groom’s relatives and friends.  As she knelt before each of the older relatives, she received a small gift.  The bride’s parents-in-law gave her a title according to her husband’s seniority in the family hierarchy. 
<br /><br />Generally, three days after the wedding, the couple paid a visit to the bride’s family, where the bride is now treated as a guest.

However, most of the customs are not performed to its fullest extent in the modern world.  Instead of performing all these ancient practices, even most elders would prefer the following 'simplified customs' nowadays.  For the modernized customs or the even more simplified customs, it will be introduced in this blog.
<br /><br />First of all, the groom and the bride exchange their birth dates.  If the groom and the bride’s birthdates are OK (it means that no disaster is predicted by the fortune teller if they get married), the two families will exchange their family tree.  Also, the wedding date is chosen by the fortune teller.  However, this custom is not always being followed depending how superstitious the families are. 
<br /><br />Instead of sending the whole list of gifts such as livestock, certain good-luck food and material, some couples simplify the gifts and the groom will only send some nice gifts such as dried seafood and fruit basket to the bride’s family.  
<br /><br />As for the “monetary gift”, the groom will either pay a certain agreed amount to the bride's family or will offer to pay for all of the wedding cost.  The bride and groom’s parents will meet together and discuss how many guests will be invited to the wedding dinner.
<br /><br />Before the wedding, the groom need to set up the bridal bed likes the ancient wedding customs.  However, this customs is simplified now.  Usually, the groom chooses the new bed with the bride.  On the wedding day, the bed is scattered with red dates, lotus seeds, peanuts, as an omen of fertility.
<br /><br />In the other hand, the bride prepares some gifts for the groom.  The gifts include wallet and leather belt.  Sometimes, the jewelry the bride brings over to the groom’s family is probably the ones that her relatives give her on wedding day as a wedding gift.
<br /><br />The day before the wedding day, the groom and bride can not meet each other.  On this day, the groom and bride have some activities with their own friends to say goodbye to single life, such as KTV, barbecue and other activities.
<br /><br />At dawn on the wedding day or the night before wedding, the bride bathed in water infused with pumelo to cleanse her of evil influences.  After that, she sits in front of the ancestral memorial tablets, faces to the door.  A good luck woman speaks auspicious words while combing her hair.  This is the top ceremony.  Anyway, the hair styled is designed by the dresser.
<br /><br />One of the funniest things of the wedding is picking up of the bride.  In the early morning of the wedding day, the groom and the groomsmen will decorate the cars and drive them over to the bride's home to pick up the bride.  The bridesmaids locked the door before the groom and the groomsmen arrive the bride’s home.  When they arrive, the bridesmaids ask the groom for red pockets for opening the door.  Sometimes, the bridesmaids also ask the groomsmen to do some funny things.  It is fun for the bridesmaids and the groomsmen to negotiate the quantity of red pockets and the funny thins.  After the groom and groomsmen satisfied the bridesmaids, they will open the door, let them enter the house and greet the bride.
<br /><br />The couple will then serve tea to the superior in the bride's family.  The bride's parents will be the first to be served, followed by other relatives.  Each one will give the couple some present in return, often red packets and jewelry for the bride (gold is often preferred in the Southern region).  After that, a good luck woman uses a red umbrella to send the bride leaves the house.
<br /><br />After the bride arriving at the groom’s house, the bride and groom worships the heavens and the earth, the groom's ancestors and they will also serve tea to all of their superiors in the family just like they done in the bride’s house.  Each one will give the couple some present in return, often red packets and jewelry for the bride.  After that, the whole family will leave the house to attend the wedding banquet held in the hotel. 
<br /><br />Before the wedding banquet starts, the groom, bride and the groom’s parents need to stand in the entry of the hotel to welcome the guests.  After most of the guests arrived at the hotel, they enter the hotel for the being beginning of the wedding banquet.  When the food is ready, the wedding music or some songs chosen by groom and bride will start to play in the background.  Some couples will hire an MC to conduct the ceremony.  During the wedding dinner, the couple will go from table to table, toasting the guests and thanking them. In return, the guests will also toast the bride and the groom.  After that, the groomsmen, bridesmaids and friends of the young couple will often play certain tricks on them. This is similar to the clinking of glasses in the Western culture. The goal is to make the groom show his love in public.  As the time draws near for the guests to leave, the parent, the couple will stand in line at the door to thank the guests and wish them well as they leave.
<br /><br />Nowadays in some areas, the rule of the bride returning to the family with gifts after 3 days of the wedding day is still being followed.  However, in some areas, this custom is being simplified so the bride will return home on the same day if distance allows.

For thousands of years, the festival is known for the rice dumpling (Zong Zi) dragon-boat races.  This regatta commemorates the death of Qu Yuan, the patriotic poet who is said to have committed suicide by drowning himself in a river. 
<br /><br />Qu Yuan was a minister of the State of Chu situated in present-day Hunan and Hubei provinces, during the Warring States Period (475-221BC).  He was upright, loyal and highly esteemed for his wise counsel that brought peace and prosperity to the state.  However, when a dishonest and corrupt prince vilified Qu Yuan, he was disgraced and dismissed.  Realizing that the country was now in the hands of evil and corrupt officials, Qu Yuan leapt into the Miluo River on the fifth day of the fifth month.  Nearby fishermen rushed over to try to save him, but they were failed to save Qu Yuan.  The people of Chu who mourned the death of Qu Yuan, threw rice wrapped by silk into the river to feed the fishes, let them do not bite Qu Yuan’s body and feed Qu Yuan’s ghost every year on the fifth day of the fifth month. 
<br /><br />During the Duanwu Festival, a glutinous rice pudding called zong zi is eaten to symbolize the rice offerings to Qu Yuan.  Ingredients such as dried shrimp, beans, lotus seeds, chestnuts, pork, sausage, salt and the golden yolk of a salted duck egg are often added to the glutinous rice.  The pudding is then wrapped with bamboo leaves, bound with a kind of raffia and boiled in the water for hours. 
<br /><br />The dragon-boat races symbolize the many attempts to rescue Qu's body. A typical dragon boat ranges from 50-100 feet in length, with a beam of about 5.5 feet, accommodating two paddlers seated side by side. 
<br /><br />A wooden dragon head is attached at the bow, and a dragon tail at the stern. A banner hoisted on a pole is also fastened at the stern and the hull is decorated with red, green and blue scales edged in gold.  In the center of the boat is a canopied shrine behind which the drummers, gong beaters and cymbal players are seated to set the pace for the paddlers.  There are also men positioned at the bow to set off firecrackers, toss rice into the water and pretend to be looking for Qu Yuan.  All of the noise and pageantry creates an atmosphere of gaiety and excitement for the participants and spectators alike.  The races are held among different clans, villages and organizations, and the winners are awarded medals, banners, jugs of wine and festive meals.

It was said that a Chinese ancestor was poisoned when he tasted different kinds of weeds and grass.  However, as he drank some tea accidentally, he was, beyond expectation, detoxified.  Before the unification of China in 221 B.C., tea was grown only in the present Yunnan and Sichuan provinces.  Afterwards, tea was introduced into other parts of China.  During the Tang Dynasty (618--907 A. D.), tea trees were planted on a large scale in the Yangtze River valley. 
<br /><br />At the very beginning, tea was stewed as a medicine and tasted quite bitter.  Later on, people came to realize that apart from its medicinal function, tea also had a pleasing fragrant flavor.  Hence, from the Northern and Southern Dynasty, Chinese people gradually drink tea as a daily drink.  But before the Song Dynasty (960--1279 A.D.), ginger, salt and some other flavourings were usually added in tea.  During the Song Dynasty, though flavourings were no longer used, it was still stressed that tea should be stewed.  It was not until the Ming Dynasty (1368--1644A. D.) that the Chinese people began to make tea with nothing but boiling water.
<br /><br />In the light of the different ways of processing, Chinese tea can be classified as follows: green tea (unfermented), black tea (fermented), oolong tea (semi-fermented), white tea (baked sprouts), jasmine tea (green tea with jasmine flowers) and brick tea. 
<br /><br />The ten kinds of well-known Chinese tea are longjing (the dragon well tea, a green tea produced in Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province), biluochun (a green tea produced in Wu County, Jiangsu Province), tieguanyin (a oolong tea produced in Anxi, Fujian Province), tunlü (a green tea produced in Tunxi, Anhui Province), pekoe Yinzhen (a white tea produced in Songxi, Fujian Province), pu'er tea (a black tea produced in Pu'er, Yunnan Province), wuyiyan tea (a oolong tea produced in Wuyi, Fujian Province),keemun black tea (a black tea produced in Qimen County, Anhui Province), dianhong (black congou tea produced in Yunnan Province with the nickname &quot;Kungfu tea&quot;, jasmine tea.  Apart from these, milk tea, buttered tea, etc. can be seen in the drinks of some Chinese minorities.

		<document id="6396fb98ebb30302a617a089332dfb57" url=""><![CDATA[Tea Culture in China-2<br/><br/>In the last blog, we introduced the origin and classification of tea.  In this blog, we will introduce the brewing of Chinese tea.
<br /><br />There are many different ways of brewing Chinese tea depending on variables like the formality of the occasion, the means of the people preparing it and the kind of tea being brewed.  For example, green teas are more delicate than oolong teas or black teas and should be brewed with cooler water as a result.  The most informal method of brewing tea is the simple adding of leaves to a pot, and hot water.  This method is commonly found in households and restaurants, as at dim sum or yum cha in Cantonese restaurants.  Two other primary methods of brewing tea are the Chaozhou method and the Gongfucha method.  Chaozhou brewing tends towards a more formal occasion and is generally used for more delicate teas, medicinal teas and tea tastings.  Gongfucha brewing is a far more formal method of tea brewing (mainly for oolong or double fermented teas like Pu’er) although even this method can be made more or less formal depending on the occasion.  
<br /><br />The tea ceremony of Gongfucha also known as Gongfucha or the kung fu tea ceremony is a relatively famous tradition of Minnan and Chaozhou or Chaoshan.  It makes use of small Yixing teawares, teapot of about 100 – 150 ml to enhance the aesthetics, and more importantly round out the taste of the tea being brewed.  Yixing teapot brewing sides towards the formal, and is used for private enjoyment of the tea as well as for welcoming guests.  Depending on the region of China the steps may differ, as well the tools used in the making of tea.  This procedure is mostly applicable to Oolong teas only although some use it to make Pu'er and other double-fermented teas.

To being a drink, Chinese tea is used in traditional Chinese medicine and in Chinese cuisine.
<br /><br />There are several special circumstances in which tea is prepared and consumed.
<br /><br />As a sign of respect: In Chinese society, the younger generation always shows its respect to the older generation by offering a cup of tea.  Inviting and paying for their elders to go to restaurants for tea is a traditional activity on holidays.  In the past, people of lower rank served tea to higher ranking people.  Today, as Chinese society becomes more liberal, sometimes at home parents may pour a cup of tea for their children, or a boss may even pour tea for subordinates at restaurants.  The lower ranking person should not expect the higher rank person to serve him or her tea in formal occasions.  
<br /><br />However, for a family gathering, when sons and daughters go out for work or get married, they may seldom visit their parents.  As a result, the parents and their children are going to restaurants and drinking tea, therefore, becomes an important activity for family gatherings.  Every Sunday, Chinese restaurants are crowded, especially when people celebrate festivals.  This phenomenon reflects Chinese family values. 
<br /><br />To apologize: In Chinese culture, people make serious apologies to others by pouring tea for them.  For example, children serving tea to their parents is a sign of regret and submission. 
<br /><br />To express thanks to your elders on one's wedding day: In the traditional Chinese marriage ceremony, both the bride and groom kneel in front of their parents and serve them tea.  That is a way to express their gratitude.  In front of their parents, it is a practice for the married couple to say, &quot;Thanks for bringing us up. Now we are getting married. We owe it all to you.&quot;  The parents will usually drink a small portion of the tea and then give them a red pocket, which symbolizes good luck.  Another variance is for the to-be daughter-in-law to serve tea to her to-be parents-in-law, symbolizing that she is to become a part of the latter's family. 
<br /><br />Moreover, there is etiquette in drinking tea in China.  After a person's cup is filled, that person may knock their bent index and middle fingers (or some similar variety of finger) tapping on the table to express gratitude to the person who served the tea.  Although this custom is common in southern Chinese culture such as the Cantonese, in other parts of China it is only acceptable if for some reason you cannot actually say thank you at that moment, for example if you are in the middle of talking with someone else at the table.
<br /><br />This custom is said to have originated in the Qing Dynasty when Emperor Qian Long would travel in disguise through the empire.  Servants were told not to reveal their master's identity.  One day in a restaurant, the emperor, after pouring himself a cup of tea, filled a servant's cup as well.  To that servant it was a huge honour to having the emperor pour him a cup of tea.  Out of reflex he wanted to kneel and express his thanks.  He could not kneel and kowtow to the emperor since that would reveal the emperor's identity, so he bent his fingers on the table to express his gratitude and respect to the emperor.

About in the 12th century, Chinese kite spread to the oriental.  Marco Polo, the great explorer introduced the kite to Europe in the 13th century.  Western kite culture was formed after years of development.  In this process, the traditional culture integrated with the kite craft, and finally formed the kite culture with unique characteristics. 
<br /><br />Uses of kite have been changed several times in history.  According to historical record, kite was first used in military.  In the mid Tang Dynasty (618-907), in which the society was stable and peaceful, the use of kites was gradually changed from military to entertainment.  With the innovation of papermaking, the raw material of kite changed from silk to paper.  Kite became popular among civilians with a richer variety of forms and reached the peak point in the Song Dynasty (960-1279).  Participated by the literary, the making and the decoration of kites underwent great development. Kite making became a profession due to the large demand.
<br /><br />The Ming (1368-1644) and Qing dynasties, was the peak period of the Chinese kite.  The kites underwent great development in size, design, decoration and flying skills.  Litterateurs at that time made kite by themselves, and sent to relatives and friends as a gift, regarding it a literary pursuit. 
<br /><br />For the modern use and making of kite, please wait……..

		<document id="1487fbc4860dce725c0e4581d2b31f52" url=""><![CDATA[Chinese Traditional Kite Craft-2<br/><br/>In the last blog, we introduced the origin and developing of kite.  In this blog, we will introduce the modern use and making of kite.
<br /><br />In the modern era, Kites have been used for scientific purposes, such as Benjamin Franklin’s famous experiment proving that lightning is electricity.  Kites were the precursors to the traditional aircraft, and were instrumental in the development of early flying craft.  Kites had a historical role in lifting scientific instruments to measure atmospheric conditions for weather forecasting.
<br /><br />In recent years, kite flying has publicized as a sports activity as well as entertainment.  In China, it usually has the kite Festival in Autumn, especially in the double ninth festival.  Many of the peoples fly a kite on the mountains.  Flying kites is one of the symbols of double ninth festival..
<br /><br />To make a kite, first of all, the right kind of bamboo strips must be selected for the frame. It should be thick and strong for a kite of large dimensions in order to stand the wind pressure.  The regular paper or sometime silk is used to cover the frame.  Silk kites, especially, are more durable and generally of higher artistic value.  Third, painting the kite may be done in each way.  Kites could be generally divided into two categories: the Hard Wing and the Soft Wing.  The Hard Wing can endure more air pressure and competitively fly higher, whilst the latter can fly farther, although it can not fly as high.  In patterns, besides the traditional ones of animals, birds, worms, fishes, new patterns of human images emerged in modern times. 
<br /><br />As a traditional culture and folk art, kite has formed unique style of different regions during its development, among which the most famous ones are the styles of Beijing, Tianjin, Weifang in Shangdong Province, Sichuan and Guangdong Province.

However, noil twill and kesi are by weaving, while embroidery is by embroidering.  Three of them are outstanding contribution that the ancient Chinese female made in cultural arts.
<br /><br />Four representatives of Chinese embroideries are Su embroidery, Xiang embroidery, Yue embroidery and Shu embroidery.
<br /><br />Su embroidery is famous for its nicety and elegance with more than 3000 years’ history till now. The craft, which dates back to the Three Kingdoms Period (220-280), became a sideline of people in the Suzhou area during the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644).  Well known for its smoothness and delicateness, Su embroidery won Suzhou the title City of Embroidery in the Qing Dynasty.  In the mid and late Qing, Su embroidery experienced further developments involving works of double-sided embroidering.  There were 65 embroidery stores in Suzhou City.  During the Republic of China period (1912-1949), the Su embroidery industry was in decline due to frequent wars and it was restored and regenerated after the founding of new China.  In 1915, Su embroidery got a good reputation in Panama International Fair.  In 1950, the central government set up research centers for Su embroidery and launched training courses for the study of embroidery.  Weaving methods have climbed from 18 to the present 40.  
<br /><br />Su embroidery features a strong, folk flavor and its weaving techniques are characterized by the following: the product surface must be flat, the rim must be neat, the needle must be thin, the lines must be dense, the color must be harmonious and bright and the picture must be even.  Su embroidery products fall into three major categories: costumes, decorations for halls and crafts for daily use, which integrate decorative and practical values.  Double-sided embroidery is an excellent representative of Su embroidery.

The earliest piece of Xiang embroidery was unearthed at the No 1 Tomb of Mawangdui, Changsha City of the Han Dynasty (206BC-AD220).  The weaving technique was almost the same as the one used in modern times, which demonstrated that embroidery had already existed in the Han Dynasty.  In its later development, Xiang Embroidery absorbed the characteristics of traditional Chinese paintings and formed its own unique characteristics.  Xiang embroidery experienced its heyday at the end of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) and in the early Republic of China (early 20th century), even surpassing Su embroidery.  After the founding of the People's Republic of China, Xiang embroidery was further improved and developed to a new level. 
<br /><br />Xiang embroidery uses pure silk, hard satin, soft satin and nylon as its material, which is connected with colorful silk threads.  Absorbing the spirit of Chinese paintings, the embroidery reaches a high artistic level.  Xiang embroidery crafts include valuable works of art, as well as materials for daily use.  
<br /><br />Meanwhile, the patterns of Xiang embroidery borrow ideas from traditional Chinese painting which are almost water, mountain, figure, flower, bird and wild animals.  The lion and tiger patterns are extremely famous which are full of power and strength.  And Xiang embroidery won the best award in the Torino World Fair in Italy in 1912 and the First award in the Panama World Fair in 1933.  Xiang embroidery is known abroad as the ideal embroidery.

According to historical records, in the first year of Yongyuan's reign (805) during the Tang Dynasty (618-907), a girl named Lu Meiniang embroidered the seventh volume of the Fahua Buddhist Scripture on a piece of thin silk 30 cm long.  And so, Yue embroidery became famous around the country.  The prosperous Guangzhou Port of the Song Dynasty promoted the development of Yue embroidery, which began to be exported at that time.  During the Qing Dynasty, people animal hair as the raw material for Yue embroidery, which made the works more vivid.  During Qianlong's reign (1736-1796) of the Qing, an industrial organization was established in Guangzhou.  At that time, a large number of craftsmen devoted themselves to the craft, inciting further improvements to the weaving technique.  Since 1915, the work of Yue embroidery garnered several awards at the Panama Expo. 
<br /><br />Influenced by national folk art, Yue embroidery formed its own unique characteristics.  The embroidered pictures are mainly of dragons and phoenixes, and flowers and birds, with neat designs and strong, contrasting colors.  Floss, thread and gold-and-silk thread embroidery are used to produce costumes, decorations for halls and crafts for daily use, most of which are kept in the Summer Palace.

Shu embroidery is the general name for embroidery products in areas around Chengdu, Sichuan Province.  Shu embroidery enjoys a long history.  As early as the Han Dynasty, Shu embroidery was already famous.  The central government even designated an office in this area for its administration.  During the Five Dynasties and Ten States periods (907-960), a peaceful society and large demand provided advanced conditions for the rapid development of the Shu Embroidery industry.  Shu embroidery experienced its peak development in the Song Dynasty (960-1279), ranking first in both production and excellence.  In the mid-Qing Dynasty, the Shu embroidery industry was formed.  After the founding of the People's Republic of China, Shu embroidery factories were set up and the craft entered a new phase of development, using innovative techniques and a larger variety of forms. 
<br /><br />Originating among the folk people in the west of Sichuan Province, Shu embroidery formed its own unique characteristics: smooth, bright, neat and influenced by the geographical environment, customs and cultures.  The works incorporated flowers, leaves, animals, mountains, rivers and human figures as their themes.  Altogether, there are 122 approaches in 12 categories for weaving.  It has a continuous development with rigid pattern and vibrant color.  Therefore, people conclude Shu embroidery as “strict &amp; exquisite stitch, delicate &amp; simple color, beautiful &amp; elegant streak and the style of Chinese painting”.  The craftsmanship of Shu embroidery involves a combination of fine arts, aesthetics and practical uses, such as the facings of quits, pillowcases, coats, shoots and screen covers.

Together with Qin, the ancient Zheng, and Qi, the chess, they formed the four skills for a learned and elegant scholar to pursue in ancient times.  They were also held as a good exercise to cultivate one's temperament.
<br /><br />Chinese calligraphy or shufa, the art of writing Chinese Characters, boasts a long history.  It evolved from pictures and signs, and the Chinese art of calligraphy developed naturally from its unique writing system.  Through the ages, great calligraphers developed representative calligraphic styles of their times.  The love of calligraphy is deeply ingrained in Chinese scholars, and has been handed down to the present day.  Masters take the characters as the carrier of their thought, so there is no need to understand Chinese characters to appreciate the beauty, as people must to appreciate Western abstract painting.
<br /><br />Traditional Chinese Painting is famous all over the world for its original style and distinctive national features.  The roots of Chinese painting can be traced back to paintings on Neolithic pottery six or seven thousand years ago.  Since similar tools and lines were used for the earliest painting and writing, painting is said to have the same origin as calligraphy.  Thus, Chinese paintings usually integrate poetry or calligraphy with themes that include figures, landscapes, flowers, birds and other animals. Traditional Chinese painting remains a highly valued genre, often on exhibit in China as well as other countries.  The contemporary art world in China is also very active.  Some Chinese artists have become adept at Western-style painting, both oil and watercolor.  Many Chinese painters have created works that combine traditional Chinese painting techniques with those of the West, enhancing both forms.  The China Art Gallery and other art galleries hold individual or joint art exhibitions year in year out.  Art expositions are held each year in Beijing, Guangzhou and Shanghai.

The history of Chinese food culture is as old as the beginning of Chinese cooking.  As a visitor or guest in either a Chinese home or restaurant you will find that table manners are essential and the distinctive courtesies displayed will invariably add to the enjoyment of your meals and keep you in high spirits.
<br /><br />When the guests arrive at dinner, it is better for them to present a gift to the host.  If you are a low-ranking guest, you can decide on bringing a gift for the host.  However, if you are a high-ranked guest, you can choose a bottle of quality wine.  This gives a good welcome thanks message to the host.  It is very important for the guests to appear in front of the host as he needs to know how many guests are arrived.  This is because he must know about the number of guests as he did the seating arrangement.
<br /><br />If in case a stranger is invited to a dinner, the job of the host is to get familiar with him.  To make him feel comfortable, a warm welcome is necessary.
<br /><br />When you are going on dinner, keep a tight check on the time.  Never be late as it is considered as disrespect in the Chinese culture.  The host of the dinner prepares everything at least 15-20 minutes before.  Hence, it is important to arrive on the time so that everything remains good during the whole time.
<br /><br />When you are at the table, respect first.  It is really an admirable custom to respect others at the table, including the aged, teachers and guests while taking good care of children.
<br /><br />Chinese people stress filial piety all the time.  The practice of presenting the best or fine food first to the senior members of the family has been observed for countless generations.  In ancient times the common people led a needy life but they still tried their best to support the elder mother or father who took it for granted.
<br /><br />Although the hosts in China are all friendly and hospitable, you should also show them respect.  Before starting to eat dinner, the host may offer some words of greeting.  Guests should not start to eat until the host says, 'Please enjoy yourself' or something like that, otherwise it suggests disrespect and causes displeasure.
<br /><br />When hosts place dishes on the table, they will arrange the main courses at the center with the supporting dishes evenly placed around them.  When the main dishes are prepared in a decorative form either by cut or other means they will be placed facing the major guests and elder people at the table.  This also embodies virtue.

		<document id="96f67605ed98880f2e891524980fecfa" url=""><![CDATA[Chinese Food Culture-2<br/><br/>The way Chinese people get seated is also an interesting part of the table manners.  This might surprise you that a typical seating arrangement is a sign of etiquettes in the Chinese culture.  Therefore, it is ensured to leave the best place on the dining table for elders.  If a group of people is having meal, the respectable members are given the place at the head of the table while the rest take their seats accordingly.
<br /><br />In case of a teacher dining with the students, teacher is given the seat of honor with students surrounding the teacher.  If the dining table is rectangular, the elder member sits on the shortest side with his face towards the front door.  The rest of the people would get seated in the descending order of their ages.  However, if you are dining on a round table, the elder member should be seated on the inside seat.
<br /><br />The guests are requested to sit on the assigned seats by the host when they reach the dinner place.  In the Chinese tradition, the seating arrangement follows some strict rules and it’s complicated.  The first thing that is required is to see who the guest is.  Usually, the first place and importance is given to the oldest member of the family.  In the American Wild West, the guest of honor is named as “Wild Bill Hickok Seat.” 
<br /><br />The first seat that is given to the most respected person of the family gives the best view of the room.  If in case there is not seat at the entrance of the room, then the “seat of honor” will be the one facing the eastward position of the room.
<br /><br />The next rule that governs in the seating plan is linked with the ‘social ranking’ of a person. This rule will be applied even if the dinner is of family get-together.  They do it to maintain closeness between the family members and the host of the dinner.  In banquets, the seating arrangement is followed on the basis of religion.
<br /><br />The person with the highest rank gets a closer seat to the ‘guest of honor.’  However, there is no fixed ranking between the seats on the left side and right side.  This provides a huge flexibility to the guests.
<br /><br />The first seat is given to the ‘guest of honor’.  After that, the seats on the left side of the chief guest and numbered in even like two, four, and six.  On the right side of the chief guest, the seats are numbered in odds like three, five, and seven. Hence, the most prestigious eats after the ‘guest of honor’ will be number two and three.
<br /><br />In a banquet function, the guests occupy several different tables.  At this point, the ‘guest of honor’ takes the center table.  This way he is visible to everyone and he is becoming a center of attention.  The tables that are on the right and left side of the chief guest are filled by the ordinary guest.  Here, the ranks of guests are kept in the mind again.  The one with highest rank point will get a closer table to the “guest of honor” and it goes on like this.
<br /><br />The host of the banquet event will try to be in touch with every ranked guest so that a good environment will prevail.  He will make sure that every guest is attended in the best possible manner.  The good thing about Chinese tradition is that etiquettes are being followed whole heartedly.  This way, there are no chances of any accident or un-unusual events.  This is the best example of the world’s most civilized nation.

		<document id="b5037571c0971290f02cfa5c9c0f831f" url=""><![CDATA[Chinese Food Culture-3<br/><br/>It is not only the duty of the host to offer the dishes to the fellow members but it is regarded as good manners if you make an offer of a particular to your partner before you take a share for yourself.  This indicates that you have come from an educated background and know how to socialize around.
<br /><br />As described earlier, the ‘guest of honor’ gets the first place in everything and now same happens at the time of the dinner.  The chief guest will start the proceedings of dinner by himself.  He takes the drink at first, raises his hands first and then first and second row follows him.  It goes on like this in every row and this way, everyone takes the drink at the same time.
<br /><br />Generally, the chief guest will say ‘shall we eat’ first to invite everyone to the dinner.  This politeness gesture will impress the rest of the guests and they will take it as a signal and will start eating.  It’s a rude thing to start the dinner before the ‘guest of honor’.  Hence, everyone start taking dinner after the chief guest.
<br /><br />Follow the proper Chinese etiquette for table manners, you must know that you are going to hold the rice bowl in your hand rather than putting it on the table.  To make the work easier for you, put your thumb on the rest of the bowl, support the bottom of the bowl with the middle, index, and ring fingers.
<br /><br />When you want to help yourself for the found around you, make sure to start taking it from the side which is closest to where you are standing.  If you take food from the side of the platter facing others, it will be considered as ill-mannered.
<br /><br />During the meal, it should be considered that you are not rotating the Lazy Susan for yourself when someone else on the table is serving himself from the main bowl.  It is recommended to wait until he gets himself the sufficient quantity of the dish so as to show respect.  Also it so happens that while rotating the disk, some of the dish falls off which again leaves a very bad impression on the fellows.
<br /><br />If you want to have something second time, you should wait until the dish takes a complete round so that everyone gets his due share.  Also, this is strictly against manners to fill the plate to the maximum.  Always serve yourself with a small quantity as you can surely take it second time.  Rotating the Lazy Susan backwards is yet another bad habit which should be avoided.
<br /><br />One of the best Chinese table manners is that the host is supposed to be caring if everybody has tried every dish served on the table.  Despite the facility of the Lazy Susan, It is expected of host to offer the special dish to all the members present.  This is just a simple gesture of showing your concern and respect for others.  For guests, it is suggested to politely decline if you do not want to eat something.

At that time, our ancestors liked to steam or boil food.  It was difficult for them to use spoons to dip vegetables in the soup.  So they cleverly invented 'Zhu' to nip food, thus it has become the most convenient tableware in their lives.  
<br /><br />Development of chopstick has experienced a long history.  Early in Xia Dynasty (21st - 16th century BC), the shape of chopstick was still in development.  Chopsticks only became two sticks of the same length in the Shang Dynasty (16th - 11th century BC).  In the late Shang Dynasty, the tyrannical King Zhou ordered his craftsmen to make chopsticks from elephants' teeth, which was seen to be the most luxurious in the early history of Chinese food culture.
<br /><br />The appearance of chopsticks said goodbye to those days when our Chinese ancestors had to use their hands to grab food, so they featured the coming of civilization to food culture.  The invention of chopsticks has many scientific theories.  The lever principle of mechanics was applied into practice.  The point where two chopsticks crossed is the pivot of the lever.
<br /><br />Chinese people are familiar with the use of chopsticks. Many foreigners are interested in but also puzzled about how to use it with facility.  Here are some notes you'd better remember when to use chopsticks.  First, you must hold the upper part and don't cross it. Second, hold it with your thumb, index finger, middle finger and third finger.  One stick is against your third finger and the other leans on your middle finger.  Third, when you pick the food, use your index finger and middle finger to control the chopsticks.  Practice a lot and then you will find it is an easy job.
<br /><br />The use of chopsticks has been a part of Chinese food culture.  There are some taboos of using chopsticks that you must pay great attention to, or you may make mistakes and be laughed at.
<br /><br />First, don't use chopsticks to hit the side of your bowl or plate to make a lot of noise, because Chinese people think only beggars would do this to beg food.  Second, when you use it, don't stretch out your index finger, which would be regarded as a kind of accusation to others.  Never use it to point at others.  Third, it is thought to be an impolite behavior when you suck the end of a chopstick.  People will think you lack family education.  Fourth, don't use it to poke at every dish without knowing what your want. And last, don't insert it vertically into the food.  Chinese people do this only when they burn incense to sacrifice the dead.
<br /><br />Nowadays, chopsticks serve many new functions besides tableware.  For example, you can buy a pair of exquisite chopsticks as a gift to your friends and relatives.  In Chinese, 'chopsticks' reads 'Kuaizi', which means to have sons soon, so a newly-married couple will be very happy to accept chopsticks as their wedding gift.  Skillful craftsmen painted beautiful sceneries on chopsticks to make them like fine artworks.  Many people love to collect these dainty chopsticks as their treasure.
<br /><br />Chopsticks are small but they are adored by many people in the world.  An interesting experiment shows that many joints and muscles are being exercised when you use chopsticks.  They certainly make you cleverer.

Originating in Sichuan Province of western China, Sichuan cuisine, known as Chuan Cai in Chinese, enjoys an international reputation for being spicy and flavorful.  Yet the highly distinctive pungency is not its only characteristic.  In fact, Sichuan cuisine boasts a variety of flavors and different methods of cooking, featuring the taste of hot, sweet, sour, salty, or tongue-numbing.
<br /><br />The origin of Sichuan cuisine can be traced back to the Qin and Han Dynasties (221BC-220AD), its recognition as a distinct regional system took place in the Han Dynasties (206BC-220AD).  As a unique style of food, Sichuan cuisine was famous more than 800 years ago during the Southern Song Dynasty (1127-1279) when Sichuan restaurants were opened in Lin'an, now called Hangzhou, the capital.  The hot pepper was introduced into China from South America around the end of the 17th century.  Once it came to Sichuan, it became a favored food flavoring.  In the late Qing Dynasty around 19th century, Sichuan cuisine became a unique local flavor, enjoying the same reputation with Shandong, Guangdong (Canton) and Huaiyang cuisines.  
<br /><br />Sichuan has high humidity and many rainy or overcast days.  Hot pepper helps reduce internal dampness, so it was used frequently in dishes, and hot dishes became the norm in Sichuan cuisine.  The region's warm, humid climate also necessitates sophisticated food-preservation techniques which include picking, salting, drying and smoking.  
<br /><br />Sichuan has been known as the land of plenty since ancient times.  It produces abundant domestic animals, poultry, and freshwater fish and crayfish.  Sichuan cuisine is well known for cooking fish.  The raw materials are delicacies from land and river, edible wild herbs, and the meat of domestic animals and birds.  Beef is more common in Sichuan cuisine than it is in other Chinese cuisines, perhaps due to the widespread use of oxen in the region.  Stir-fried beef is often cooked until chewy, while steamed beef is sometimes coated with rice flour to produce rich gravy.
<br /><br />Sichuan dishes consist of Chengdu, Chongqing and vegetarian dishes.  Masterly used cooking techniques are sauteing, stir-frying without stewing, dry-braising, Pao (soaking in water) and Hui (frying then braising with corn flour sauce).  Sichuan cuisine is famous for its distinct and various flavors, the most outstanding ones are fish flavors, pepper powder boiled in oil, strange flavor and sticky-hot.

True Mapo Tofu is powerfully spicy with both conventional &quot;heat&quot; spiciness and the characteristic &quot;mala&quot; (numbing spiciness) flavor of Sichuan cuisine.  The feel of the particular dish is often described by cooks using seven specific Chinese adjectives: numbing, spicy hot, hot temperature, fresh, tender and soft, aromatic? and flaky.  These seven characteristics are considered to be the most defining of authentic Mapo Tofu.  The authentic form of the dish is increasingly easy to find outside China today, but usually only in Sichuanese restaurants that do not adapt the dish for non-Sichuanese tastes.  It is said that Ma Po bean curd introduced to Japan after the bags were made of fast food, &quot;Mapo tofu.&quot;
