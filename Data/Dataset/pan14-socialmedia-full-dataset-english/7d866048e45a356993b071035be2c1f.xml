<br />A man walks into a drug store with his 8-year old son. They happen to walk by the condom display, and the boy asks, &quot;What's are these, Dad?&quot;
<br /><br />To which the man matter-of-factly replies, &quot;Those are called condoms, son. Men use them to have safe sex.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;Oh I see,&quot; replied the boys pensively. &quot;Yes, I've heard of that in health class at school.&quot; 
<br /><br />He looks over the display and picks up a package of 3 and asks, &quot;Why are there 3 in this package?&quot;
<br /><br />The dad replies, &quot;Those are for high-school boys. One for Friday, one for Saturday, and one for Sunday.&quot; 
<br /><br />&quot;Cool!&quot; says the boy. He notices a 6-pack and asks, &quot;Then who are these for?&quot; 
<br /><br />&quot;Those are for college men,&quot; The dad answers, &quot;TWO for Friday, TWO for Saturday, and TWO for Sunday.&quot; 
<br /><br />&quot;WOW!&quot; exclaimed the boy. &quot;Then who uses THESE?&quot; he asks, picking up a12-pack. 
<br /><br />With a sigh, the dad replied, &quot;Those are for married men. One for January, one for February, one for March...&quot;

After a while, one guy looks at the other and says, &quot;I can't help but think, from listening to you, that you're from Ireland.&quot; The other guy responds proudly, &quot;Yes that I am!&quot; The first guy says &quot;So am I! and where about from Ireland might you be?&quot; The other guy answers &quot;I'm from Dublin, I am.&quot; The first guy responds &quot;Sure and begora and so am I! and what street did you live on in Dublin?&quot; The other guy says, &quot;A loverly little area it was, I lived on McCleary street in the old central part of town.&quot; The first guy says &quot;Faith and it's a small world, so did I! and to what school would you have been going?&quot; the other guy answers &quot;Well now I went to St Mary's of course.&quot; The first guy gets really excited and says &quot;And so did I. Tell me, what year did you graduate?&quot; The other guy answers &quot;Well now I graduated in 1964.&quot; The first guy exclaims &quot;The good Lord must be smiling down upon us! I can hardy believe our good luck at winding up in the same bar on this very night. Can you believe it, I graduated from St Mary's in 1964 my own self.&quot; 
<br />About this time, another guy walks into the bar, sits down, and orders a beer. The bar tender walks over, shaking his head and mutters &quot;It's gonna be a long night tonight, the Murphy twins are drunk again.&quot;

<br /><br />and have dinner with her parents. Since this is such a
<br /><br />big event, the girl announces to her boyfriend that
<br /><br />after dinner, she would like to go out and make love
<br /><br />for the first time.
<br /><br />* * * * * * * * *
<br /><br />Well, the boy is ecstatic, but he has never had sex
<br /><br />before, so he takes a trip to the pharmacist to get
<br /><br />some condoms. He tells the pharmacist it's his first time and
<br /><br />the pharmacist helps the boy for about an hour.
<br /><br />He tells the boy everything there is to know about condoms and
<br /><br />sex.
<br /><br />* * * * * * * * *
<br /><br />At the register, the pharmacist asks the boy how many
<br /><br />condoms he'd like to buy, a 3-pack, 10-pack, or family
<br /><br />pack. The boy insists on the family pack because he
<br /><br />thinks he will be rather busy, it being his first time and all.
<br /><br />* * * * * * * * *
<br /><br />That night, the boy shows up at the girl's parents
<br /><br />house and meets his girlfriend at the door. &quot;Oh, I'm
<br /><br />so excited for you to meet my parents, come on in!&quot;
<br /><br />* * * * * * * * *
<br /><br />The boy goes inside and is taken to the dinner table
<br /><br />where the girl's parents are seated. The boy quickly
<br /><br />offers to say grace and bows his head.
<br /><br />* * * * * * * * *
<br /><br />A minute passes, and the boy is still deep in prayer,
<br /><br />with his head down.
<br /><br />* * * * * * * * *
<br /><br />10 minutes pass, and still no movement from the boy.
<br /><br />* * * * * * * * *
<br /><br />Finally, after 20 minutes with his head down, the
<br /><br />girlfriend leans over and whispers to the
<br /><br />boyfriend, &quot;I had no idea you were this religious.&quot;
<br /><br />* * * * * * * *
<br /><br />The boy turns, and whispers back, &quot;I had no idea your
<br /><br />father was a pharmacist.&quot;
<br /><br />* * * * * * * * *
