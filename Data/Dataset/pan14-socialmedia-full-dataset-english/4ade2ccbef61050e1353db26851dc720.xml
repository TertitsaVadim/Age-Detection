<br />but what makes it even worse is that it  makes watching paint dry so funny you have a hypercondriatic fit. do ya wanna know why. it's because the tutor i have for it is like a cross between Sauron (LOTR) and Margaret Thatcher. She quite literally sucks your blood and makes all around you ice cold (like a dementor you potter fans), she lives (or does she<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/unsure.gif" alt=":)" /> in the coldest class in my college where i am almost sure she has her own coffin with soil from her crypt in transylvania and clothes so starched that if ever there was a slight breeze i'm sure she would take off like a jet fighter bearing down on you with those hawk like eyes...like she's doing now... <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/w00t.gif" alt=":)" />

<br /><br />and if you do, you should not repost this.
<br /><br />Just because you were born in '97 doesn't mean you're a 90's kid.
<br /><br />It's not like you could remember the original Simpsons. I am sorry but three conscious years of the 90's just wont cut it.
<br /><br />You're a 90's kid if:
<br /><br />You can finish this [ice ice _ _ _ _ ] 
<br /><br />You remember watching:
<br />-Doug
<br />-Ren &amp; Stimpy
<br />-Pinky and the Brain
<br /><br />You've ever ended a sentence with the word &quot;PSYCHE!&quot;
<br /><br />You just cant resist finishing this . . . &quot;Iiiiiiin west philidelphia born and raised . . .&quot; *sings*

<br /><br />You took plastic cartoon lunch boxes to school. 
<br /><br />You still get the urge to say &quot;NOT&quot; after (almost) every sentence . . . not
<br /><br />when everyhting was settled by:
<br />-rock paper scissors.
<br />-turn around, tutch the ground...
<br />-ip dip doo the cats got the flu...
<br /><br />when playing 'house' was a daily activity.
<br /><br />when we played Hide and seek/kiss catch until our legs grew numb.
<br /><br />when we used to obey our parents
<br /><br />You used to listen to the radio all day long just to record your FAVORITE song of ALL time.
<br /><br />Captain Planet. He's a Hero. 
<br /><br />You knew that Kimberly, the pink ranger, and Tommy, the green ranger, were meant to be together. ???
<br /><br />when daytime t.v was all learning stuff for kids, that your parents made you watch if you stayed off school.
<br /><br />You remember when Super Nintendos and Sega Genisis became popular.
<br /><br />You always wanted to send in a tape to britain's Funniest Home Videos . . . but never taped anything funny.
<br /><br />You remember watching Home Alone 1, 2 , and 3 . . . and tried to pull the pranks on &quot;intruders&quot;
<br /><br />You remember watching:
<br />-The Magic roundabout
<br />-kipper the dog
<br />-button moon
<br /><br />You remember when Yo-Yos were cool.
<br /><br />You remember those Where's Wally books.
<br /><br />You remember eating thoses biscuit rings with icing on top.
<br /><br />You remember watching:
<br />-the 1st Batman
<br />-Aladdin
<br />-Ninja Turtles
<br />-3 Ninjas movies.
<br /><br />when starburst were called opalfruits.
<br /><br />If you remember when every thing was &quot;da BOMB!&quot;
<br /><br />When they made the new lunchables so that you could make pizza AND tacos.
<br /><br />...and even the boys loved steps and spice girls.
<br /><br />You remember boom boxes vs. cd players.
<br /><br />Making those little paper fortune cookie things, and then predicting your life with them.
<br /><br />You played and/or collected &quot;Pogs&quot; 
<br /><br />You had at least one Tamagotchi, GigaPet, or Nano and brought it everywhere.
<br /><br />. . . Furbies. 
<br /><br />You haven't always had a computer, and it was cool to have the internet.
<br /><br />And Windows 95 was the best.
<br /><br />You watched the original cartoons of Rugrats, Power Rangers, and Ninja Turtles.
<br /><br />Michael Jordan was a king.
<br /><br />YIKES pencils and erasers were the stuff!
<br /><br />You remember when the new Beanie Babies and Talking Elmo were always sold out
<br /><br />You collected those Beanie Babies.
<br /><br />Carebears.
<br /><br />Gap was the coolest stuff invented.
<br /><br />You had a pair of popper trackies.
<br /><br />Jellybean shoes.
<br /><br />Everything was inflatable from bags, chairs, sofas, aliens...
<br /><br />Coats were puffy and aluminous.
<br /><br />You could by everything with £1.
<br /><br />The old, old £20
<br /><br />oasis was the 'new' thing.
<br /><br />You collected all the Troll dolls
<br /><br />If you even know what an original walkman is.
<br /><br />You remember wanting to sit on the orange Nickelodeon couch.
<br /><br />You've gotten creeped out by &quot;Are You Afraid of the Dark?&quot;
<br /><br />You know the Macarena by heart. 
<br /><br />&quot;Talk to the hand&quot; . . . enough said
<br /><br />You always said, &quot;Then why don't you marry it!&quot;
<br /><br />You went to McDonald's to play in the playplace.
<br /><br />You remember playing on merry go rounds at the playground.
<br /><br />Before the MySpace frenzy . . .
<br /><br />Before the Internet &amp; text messaging . . .
<br /><br />Before creatives &amp; iPods . . .
<br /><br />Before emos and chavs. . . :S
<br /><br />Before PlayStation2 or X-BOX . . .
<br /><br />Before Spongebob . . .
<br /><br />Back when you put off the 5 hours of homework you had every night.
<br /><br />When light up trainers were cool.
<br /><br />When everyone wore visors.
<br /><br />When you rented VHS tapes, not DVDs.
<br /><br />Caller ID was a new thing.
<br /><br />When we recorded stuff on VCRs.
<br /><br />When we called the radio station to request songs to hear off of our walkman.
<br /><br />When checking out drawing books and that one book about the rainbow fish from the library was THE cool thing to do.
<br /><br />You had slap braclets!
<br /><br />Way back.
<br /><br />Before we realized all this would eventually disappear.
<br /><br />Who would have thought you'd miss the 90's so much!!!!!
<br /><br />Post this in your bulletin if you remember these days . . . .
<br /><br />Post with the year you were born in.

Not only that but Hugh was shouting &quot;Take that you bloody jolly B*******g sod!&quot;.

<br /><br />You have to obey to some rules, so everybody can enjoy Facebox. The following acts are prohibited by law and are subject to punishment:
<br /><br />* Racism, xenophobia, negationism and discrimination (prison sentences). Racist remarks, propagating discrimination of sexual preferences, publishing racist pictures or insulting foreigners are forbidden.
<br />* Public offenses, publishing sexually suggestive pictures, pedophilia, offering prostitution or escort services and implicit or explicit invitations for sexual activities.
<br />Uploading pornographic, sexually suggestive or overtly erotic photos/text is forbidden. Invitations for sexual activities in public or by private messages are also prohibited. Humoristic or caricatural pictures can be an exception, as long as the humoristic character is predominant.
<br />* Slander, defamation, stalking, insults, abuse of Insults, abusing someone's name or picture, slander and defamation are also forbidden on Facebox.
<br /><br />It is strictly forbidden to publish messages or pictures with damaging, threatening, misleading, defamatory, rancorous, aggressive, racist, vulgar, denigrating, indecent, insulting, violent, obscene or pornographic content.
<br /><br />It's also forbidden to use the site for political or commercial purposes. References to political parties and publishing of flags will be punished if it's clear that there are political or inflammatory purposes behind it. Discussions of political subjects are allowed, if they don't degenerate.
<br />* Violation of intellectual properties
<br />On Facebox, you can only publish content that is yours. Facebox can't be held liable if you do publish pictures or text which you don't have the right to publish. Facebox will impose sanctions when the abuse is known.
<br />* Disturbing the public order on the web site means that spamming, recruiting votes, sending unsolicited commercials or collar letters, in private or public messages, unlawfully reloading pages, flooding or writing excessively long text, et cetera can be prosecuted. SO DON'T BEHAVE IN AN INAPPROPRIATE OR DETRIMENTAL WAY.
<br />* (Trying to) hack(ing) Facebox or the account of a Facebox member is prohibited and punishable. In this situation, we always alert the police, as we also do when you're a minor. By committing such offenses, you risk a prison sentence and/or monetary fine.
<br /><br />Except for abuses such as defamation, which can only be prosecuted after a complaint by the victim, Facebox can initiate action to end forbidden practices. Facebox is lawfully obliged to report indictable offences to the appropriate law enforcement agency(ies).
