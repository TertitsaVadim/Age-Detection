<br />However, the girl's
<br />father does not like me and want to stop our
<br />relationship. ..... and so.. I  wrote this letter
<br />to the girl..
<br />I know  that the girl's father will definitely read
<br />this letter..
<br /><br />1 &quot;The great love that I have for you
<br />2 is gone, and I find my dislike for you
<br />3 grows every day. When I see you,
<br />4 I do not even like your face;
<br />5 the one thing that I want to do is to
<br />6 look at other girls. I never wanted to
<br />7 marry you. Our last conversation
<br />8 was very boring and has not
<br />9 made me look forward to seeing you again.
<br />10 You think only of yourself.
<br />11 If we were married, I know that I would find
<br />12 life very difficult, and I would have no
<br />13 pleasure in living with you. I have a heart
<br />14 to give, but it is not something that
<br />15 I want to give to you. No one is more
<br />16 foolish and selfish than you, and you are not
<br />17 able to care for me and help me.
<br />18 I sincerely want you to understand that
<br />19 I speak the truth. You will do me a favor
<br />20 if you think this is the end. Do not try
<br />21 to answer this. Your letters are full of
<br />22 things that do not interest me. You have no
<br />23 true love for me. Good-bye! Believe me,
<br />24 I do not care for you. Please do not think that
<br />25 I am still your boyfriend.&quot;
<br /><br />So bad!! However, before handing over the letter to
<br />the girl,  I  told
<br />the girl to &quot;READ BETWEEN THE LINES&quot;, meaning-only to
<br />read
<br />1.3.5.7.9.11. 13 (Odd No.'s) go read it once again but
<br />the Odd Number
<br />lines..

<br />Madness.......
<br /><br />A long time ago, before the world was created and humans set foot on it, God had
<br />put all the human &quot;qualities&quot; in a separate room. 
<br /><br />Since all the qualities were bored they decided to play hide &amp; seek.
<br /><br />&quot;Madness&quot; was one of the qualities and he shouted: &quot;I want to count, I want to
<br />count!&quot;
<br /><br />And since nobody was crazy enough to want to seek &quot;Madness&quot;, all the other
<br />qualities agreed. So &quot;Madness&quot; leaned against a tree and started to count: &quot;One,
<br />two, three...&quot; 
<br /><br />As &quot;Madness&quot; counted, the qualities went hiding.
<br /><br />&quot;Treason&quot; hid in a pile of garbage.. 
<br /><br />&quot;Lie&quot; said that it would hide under a stone, but hid at the bottom of the lake.
<br />And Madness continued to count &quot;... seventy nine, eighty, eighty one...&quot;  By
<br />this time, all the qualities were already hidden except &quot;Love &quot;.  For stupid as
<br />&quot;Love&quot; is, he could not decide where to hide. And this should not surprise us,
<br />because we all know how difficult it is to hide &quot;Love&quot;. 
<br /><br />&quot;Madness&quot;: &quot;...ninety five, ninety six, ninety seven...&quot; Just when &quot;Madness&quot; got
<br />to one hundred.........&quot;Love&quot; jumped into a rose bush where he hid. 
<br /><br />And Madness turned around and shouted: &quot;I'm coming, I'm coming!&quot; 
<br /><br />As Madness turned around, &quot;Laziness&quot; was the first to be found, because
<br />&quot;Laziness&quot; was too lazy to hide. &quot;Madness&quot; searched madly and found &quot;Lie&quot; at the
<br />bottom of the lake. One by one, Madness found them all except Love. Madness was
<br />getting desperate, unable to find Love. 
<br /><br />Envious of Love, &quot;Envy&quot; whispered to &quot;Madness&quot; &quot;You only need to find Love, and
<br />Love is hiding in the rose bush.&quot; 
<br /><br />&quot;Madness&quot; Jumped on the rose bush and he heard loud cry. The thorns in the bush
<br />had pierced &quot;Loves&quot; eyes. 
<br /><br />Hearing the commotion God came into the room and saw what had happened. 
<br /><br />He got very angry and cursed &quot;Madness&quot; and said since &quot;Love&quot; has become blind
<br />because of u ...u shall always be with him&quot; And so it came about that from that
<br />day on, 
<br />&quot;Love is blind and is always accompanied by Madness!

<br /><br />Isn't it strange how Rs. 20/=
<br />seems like such a large
<br />amount when
<br />you donate it , but
<br />such a small amount
<br />when you go shopping?
<br /><br />Isn't it strange how 2 hours
<br />seem so long when
<br />you're at place of worship, and how
<br />short they seem when you're
<br />watching a good movie?
<br /><br />Isn't it strange that you can't
<br />find a word to say when
<br />you're praying,
<br />but you have no trouble
<br />thinking what to talk about
<br />with a friend?
<br /><br />Isn't it strange how difficult
<br />and boring it is to read
<br />one chapter
<br />of the Quran , but how easy
<br />it is to read 100 pages of
<br />a popular novel?
<br /><br />Isn't it strange how everyone
<br />wants front-row-tickets
<br />to concerts or
<br />games, but they do whatever
<br />is possible to sit at the last
<br />row in a holy place?
<br /><br />Isn't it strange how difficult it
<br />is to learn a fact about
<br />God to share it
<br />with others, but how easy
<br />it is to learn, understand,
<br />extend and repeat gossip?
<br /><br />Isn't it strange how everyone
<br />wants a place in
<br />heaven, but they don't want
<br />to believe, do, or say anything
<br />to get there?
<br /><br />Isn't it strange how we send
<br />jokes in e-mails
<br />and they are forwarded
<br />right away,
<br />but when we are going to send
<br />messages about God, we think
<br />about it twice before we share
<br />it with others?
<br /><br />&quot;We are each of us angels with only one wing.
<br />And we can only fly while embracing each other.&quot;
<br /><br />Sharing and Caring endures human life.

<br /><br />1)Love does not hurt. Physical and/or emotional abuse are not a part of love. 
<br /><br />2)Love is not manipulative, it should not be used to get others to do what you want. You should never give in to demands based on the, &quot;You would do it if you loved me!&quot; tactic. 
<br /><br />3)Love is an intense feeling of caring for another person. It can take many different forms (romantic, friendly, familial) but it is always about caring. 
<br /><br />4)Although it is true that a big part of love is putting another person's happiness ahead of your own this never includes compromising your values or being untrue to yourself. 
<br /><br />5)If somebody asks you to do something that you don't want to do in order to &quot;prove&quot; your love they do not love you the way you might think they do. When you love another person you don't ask them to sacrifice a part of themselves in the name of that love. 
<br /><br />6)It is very easy to confuse lust for love. The true measure of romantic love is commitment and trust not physical attraction. 
<br /><br />7)It is possible to feel romantic love for more than one person at a given time. Just think, if it is possible for you to love both of your parents at the same time why would it be impossible to feel romantic love for two people at once? Don't beat yourself up emotionally if you find yourself in this unhappy situation. But be sure to remain single and be open and honest with all parties about your feelings and confusion. 
<br /><br />8)Sex is NOT love. Love is NOT sex. Sex can be a part of romantic love but it is never mandatory. 
<br /><br />9)Romantic love can (and often does) fade. When it goes there is not always a reason. When somebody falls out of love with you it does not reflect upon your value as a person or your desirability. 
<br /><br />10)Love should make you feel happy, secure and appreciated.
