<br /><strong>09/06/2007</strong>
<br /><br />People are crazy about Dream concert. This’s really a concert in dream with so many famous singers. It looks like SM’s concert with so many SM’s chickens.. People awaited this concert so much.. 
<br /><br />And.. come up to expectation, DBSK’s performance really catch the fan’s heart. The hottest moments was O - Jung Ban Hab and Yunho’s stripping dance.. Korean and Western fan was breathless with Yunho sexy dance... Everybody did enjoy the show.. I could hear fan screaming like crazy at the stadium... Dream concert succeed beyond imagination...
<br /><br />------------------------
<br /><br />I was also breathless while seeing Yunho’s performance.. but.. It was the state of shock.. 
<br /><br />I totally motionless.. I lost my tongue.. I was shocked.. my boss said something and i cannot understand at all.. Oh God..
<br /><br />Within one week, I got two heart attack news… one good and one bad..
<br /><br />The first, DBSK’s big promotion – about e-government even.. 
<br /><br />The second, Yunho’s performance in Dream concert.. 
<br /><br />Ken-san is better, she’s more calm and sefl-control than me.. 
<br /><br />But, the elder’s reaction as Ken-san and me won’t be difference, I think ...
<br /><br />Yunho..
<br /><br />Is it your new image that SM is trying to set up?? Sexy and seductive “man”?? I really cannot accept the way you pull up the shirt. It’s so flaunt. Some fans said that the dance move was Bi’s mark.. is it needed?? 
<br /><br />My beloved son, Yunho, who is talent but well-mannered and temperate, please don’t do that anymore.. unless you want to leave elder’s fans.. it's enough.. no more please.. It's not easy to ingretiate elder, U know.. 
<br /><br />Yep.. you're adult now.. and you has the right to make decision yourself.. I know that clearly... but… I still worry.. DBSK now have reached to a rather high position, so your each movement will be watched and analyze… be careful… 
<br /><br />Yep... your performance were warmest wellcome by the Korean fans, western fans.. i know the reason why you did it, but.. whatever people say... I still like your Japanese style.. elegant, courtly and temperate... 
<br /><br />Am i too old??
<br />--&gt;.&lt;--------
<br />Today is 13th June 2007, the day when Loving you DVD's release.. i celebrate this even by myself with a cake.. (ack.. i'll getting fat soon... oh my God) after all this is a special even... and after all i still love them..

<br /><br />Not anymore.. 
<br /><br />BUT ...CHOTTO...I'M NOT AN ANTI-FAN.. 
<br /><br />It's just a suddent feelling that rush through my head when i was at the Kovi Concert 03 July 2007.. It's a big concert with so many Korean stars.. including Kangta and a member of Shinwa.. and many others.. But sorry.. i don't know them.. T_T..
<br /><br />Infact, i have no feeling with Kangta or others (sorry H.o.t's fan..), and the reason why i came to the concert was so ..funny: i supported SM entertainment - i wanted to let SM thought that Vietnamese market is very lucrative.. and somehow.. they might sent DBSK - their favourite &quot;chickens&quot; to VN..
<br /><br />I came to the concert rather late.. and I thought the stadium would be full of fans.. and there would be no place for me.. 
<br /><br />But.. I was wrong.. 
<br /><br />The concert was full of people - not fans. My sis and i sat on the stair and watch the concert.. Everything was so so.. I thought the sound system was not so good 'cos i couldn't hear the singer's voice very well.. 
<br /><br />And then, when Vietnamese singer - Lam Truong finished his performance.. about half of audience went home in crowds.. The stadium became pitiful empty.. It was only about 20:30 or little more.. still early.. 
<br /><br />Standing at the top line of the stadium, i tried to take photograph with my hands trembling in anger.. an unexplainable anger.. 
<br /><br />Such an impolite action they did.. right at an exchanges concert between two countries.. Oh my God.. I'm not sure what i will do if i was them.. but.. i think it shouldn't do that at an exchanges concert.. what's the singer feelling??They must be so upset for sure.. They came all the way to VN and...??!!??
<br /><br />If the audience all bought the tickets, and the concert was too bad.. so, they have the right to go home whenever they want.. but.. this is an exchanges concert, and they pay nothing for the ticket, while there are so many real fans desire it desperately.. I feel so sorry for the real fan.. including Ms.Nhu.. she was so sad 'cos she couldn't get the ticket - she's a fan of Shinwa.. and some Kangta's fans who are my friends also.. they had to stay at home while their beloved singers performed...It's so pitiful..
<br /><br />At that moment, suddenly i wish DBSK won't come to Vietnam anymore.. I don't want anymore... I don't want our little boys be in this situation... They'll be so sad.. and disappointed.. I rather stay in VN and patiently wait for their DVD, or waylay for DBSK's performance in Television or watch the fan's cam.. I don't want the boys get hurt.. T_T
<br /><br />Unexplainable feeling.. unreasonable anger.. Oh.. i'm becoming mother-chicken-liked day by day.. ..

<br /><strong>WHAT A FAN!!</strong>
<br /><br />I have just read report of the Fan meeting in Korea which had happen recently.. And i feel so sad for my boys.. I cannot stop myself wonder and wonder what kind of love the fan have and what kind of fan they are... those young little girl fans.... 
<br /><br />At middle of the Fan meeting, it was my little man's performance .. and at that moment, most of the girl fans cried out, asked my son to show ...his stomach.. 
<br /><br />Yunho tried to refuse, but after all, he gave in and did as the fan's requirement.
<br /><br />Oh my God.. 
<br /><br />I don't want to be prejudiced against anyone.. I always tell myself over and over that don't rush to conclusion about anything, anyone since i wasn't in their situation.. But, i really wonder what is in their mind when they doing that kind of action.. 
<br /><br />They always say that they love Yunho as their husband. So that means they completely agree with their husband body-show?? I wonder what is in their mind when their own husband show his body that way??? Do they really love him??
<br /><br />I was angry.. what do they think who he is?? Monkey?? Oh.. poor my son.. poor Yunho.. 
<br /><br />So, now i understand his show-off-performance in Dream concert.. after all he is working, and he has to do as Market's demand.. &gt;.&lt;
<br /><br />My little man, i'll try to accept this kind of image that you have to wear.. Let do whatever is good to you.. 
<br /><br />I love you.. dear..

<br />'Ong xa – (means my beloved husband) I want to treat you well.. why you pay no attention on me??
<br /><br />I had tried on my best to be a good wife,to be a good mother. I desire a warm and happy family. I want to talk to you as much as I can. As all girl in over the world, I want to treat you well, but why you paid no attention on me?? My dream is simply being a good wife of you, but even such simple thing is impossible..
<br /><br />When I first came to Korea, I know nothing about Korean live. I was so confuse… I was so upset… When I was that way, why didn’t you ask me the reason ??You didn't ..You were angry with me, weren't you??
<br /><br />Don't you know that being husband and wife means mutual support to each others. Whatever happen we should talk to each other, and try to find the way out.. and I also wished my husband’s protect, but.. 
<br /><br />When I was tired, I immediately think about you, I want to talk to you. But, whenever you came home, you're always uneasy.. I know that I was so young than you, but after all I'm your wife.. 
<br /><br />When you're upset, you immediately think about divorce. I cannot accept. I want maintain our marriage as long as possible. In a family, even in bad or good, both of us must share and talk to each other everything…. Husband and wife had been bound by either 'love' (ai), and 'faith' (yi). In marriage, there is not only happy, but also unhappy things. 
<br /><br />…
<br /><br />I wish you can meet some other girl who will love you as the way you want – better than me.. I wish you the most wonderful and beautiful thing in the world.. I will come back to Vietnam. I have responsibility to take care of my parents for the rest of my life. That's all. I don't wish any thing else.. I don't have anything else.. 
<br /><br />After all, we came from two different country, we cannot get along with each others.. 
<br /><br />I think God is making fun of me.. 
<br /><br />I don't know what more to say.. and even if I say.. you still don't understand a little bit.. What a pity!!'
<br /><br />That is those last words of the poor girl who had been killed by her own husband at CheoNan...
<br /><br />(<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ohmynews.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.ohmynews.com</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.tuoitreonline.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.tuoitreonline.com</a>)
<br /><br />About the girls who get married with Korean, some people (including me) thought most of them are bad girls who try to get married for money... But this girl, who has been killed by her husband in CheoNan gave me another point of view.. 
<br /><br />As we can see in her lastest letter which wrote to her rude husband Mr.Jangamuke, she is identified as a very piety, traditional and good-natured person. And this man was very very lucky when get married with such kind girl.. 
<br /><br />Nevertheless, he killed her???.. like a rat??!!?? I cannot understand what’s in his mind when he did such thing.. 
<br /><br />Suppose she was a bad girl and she tried to stolen his money or else.. so I can understand 
<br /><br />But she wasn't…
<br /><br />I can feel her desperately try to get along with the man who she decided to be a wife.. but no matter how hard she do, that callous man don’t move a little.. He didn't allow her to learn Korean, he didn't allow her to be a real wife.. what does she is he think?? She is his wife.. not his slave… or his pet.. 
<br /><br />She had been confined within not only the strange social but also the cool and rude of the only person she know in Korea…
<br /><br />Her dream about a happy family was broken.. only two month since the day she come to Korea.. Her simple dream about a normal family, which will never come true… never.. 
<br /><br />Being poor or living in the country side is not a crime. After all she is still a human, she has the right to desire her own happiness.. she has the right to be treat as a human.. I cannot image how can he be able to punch her to death.. how ruthless he is.. how savage that action is.. 
<br /><br />I'm a woman, so I completely understand her desire, her dream.. 
<br /><br />It’s so tough!! 
<br /><br />I also had a dream like hers. I want to get married and take care of my own husband, educate my son, share all the bad and good with my family.. I sympathy with her so much.. 
<br /><br />Despite what nationality they are.. Korean, Japanese, Vietnamese, Chinese or else.., women us share the same dream about warm and happy family - with husband and children..
<br /><br />I myself was rather traditional. And I always wish to find out a man who is worthy for me to stay at his side, to support him for the rest of my life.. But even I found out him, in case he do the wrong things.. I won't easily forgive him that way.. ('cos when he doing this, he had proved that he's not worthy to my trust, my love..)
<br /><br />Why didn't he realize her endeavor to build a happy family with him and for him??
<br /><br />Poor little girl.. She is still too young – 20 years old- the age of romance and tales… and being beaten till death by her own husband.. How tragidic it is!!
<br /><br />Broken dream.. Broken life.. 
<br /><br />I cannot express my feeling.. 
<br /><br />Is that the way to treat the wife?? 
<br /><br />Where is his humanity??Where is his humanity??? 
<br /><br />I totally shocked about the news.. So shock.. TT_TT..

<br /><br />The life is not so good, not so beautiful.. but not so bad also.. 
<br /><br />I want him learn how to live with others, I want him learn to respect others, I want him to learn not to violate other’s private area, I want him to learn to suffer a little so that he’ll be able to face with other bigger trouble in real life, I want him to be careful while making friend, I want him to learn to live responsible ..etc.. 
<br /><br />It’s just because I want him to be a strong and good person… but.. it seems that I used the wrong way.. I think he consider that I neither love him nor care about him.. 
<br /><br />My parent divorced since I was 13. My brother and I live with mom. But my mother love my brother than me. (I can sympathize her, ‘cos I look similar to my dad who she hate the most). 
<br /><br />So that means I was nearly growing up alone, and by that way, I’ve learned so many things.. even bad and good.. 
<br /><br />But up to now, I feel that all hard life-times were good. It teaches me how to become a strong and manner person. 
<br /><br />Of course, I was also contaminated something bad, which I’m trying to get risk of, as I myself experience all the things. So I don’t want my little brother involve with those things. So, I was telling him the right things to do in a firm and reality way by which I hope would easier to imagine.. 
<br /><br />But I think he misunderstood my attitude as an uncaring-attitude.. he’s feeling like I abandoned him, and don’t care about him at all.. 
<br /><br />What should I do?? Educate a child is really not easy.. 
<br /><br />In a family without a man, It’s really hard to teach a son.. Sighhh.. sometime I think my way of educate seemslike man’s a little bit …too hard, too firm… even sometime I think if I were a man, my brother will be better..
<br /><br />So far, I worry for my future son.. 
<br /><br />As I am now, my son won’t be a good boy as my ideal son – Yunho.. 
<br /><br />I want to learn about how to take care and how to train a son.. I want to find out what part of me is not good to teach my future son..

<br /> A bridge in Can Tho suddenly broken while the workers are working in that bridge. 50 people died, about 82 others have heavy injured! And there are still so much people down there,still haven't find out! 
<br /><br />27 Sep 2007, i took a hafl day off to go to donated blood which was needed badly in Can Tho Hospital.. The donated blood will be sent to Can Tho Hospital at 5PM this day.
<br /><br />There was so many people here.... in hospital
<br /><br />Both Vietnamese and Foreigners.. 
<br /><br />Some are still so young... 
<br /><br />Some look rather old...
<br /><br />Young student pass by on the way to school..
<br /><br />Business man in his suit reschedule his plan to come..
<br /><br />Houseworker cancel her shopping in order to be free..
<br /><br />&quot;How tragic it was!! The victims are all the poor. They just want to earn money for their family.. nevertheless..!!
<br /><br />9:00AM The value time went by.. but every one still wait in patien for their turn... 
<br /><br />10:00AM, An actress came along with her family.. They want to donate their blood too..
<br /><br />&quot;We are anxious to donate the blood for the victims. It's such urgent requirement.. We are afraid that our blood wasn't enought..&quot;
<br /><br />10:30AM, it's my turn to donate blood.. Duo to my weight is not too much, they didn't allow me to give out 350ml of blood.. only 250ml... &gt;.&lt;
<br /><br />A little girl who come from country side - i guess - seems so worry about wether those donated blood was enough or not.. She told me that she had been get injured last year, and there was not enough blood for her at that time...
<br /><br />And since she had past those terrible day.. now she don't want any one else being on her situation..
<br /><br />&quot;We heared the bad new on television, and we want to help the victim..Up to now, we didn't eat anything for keeping the blood pure..&quot;
<br /><br />I can feel their worry.. their heart.... their care of the Can Tho Brigde's victims...
<br /><br />When i went out the hospital.. 
<br /><br />It's raining hard... every body ran for hiding place..
<br /><br />Suddenly, a little truck stopped, and 2 worker in their spattered uniform ran out to put money into the donate box.. 
<br /><br />Life is milticolour.. There still are so many glory point.. 
<br /><br />In such busy life...people seems so cold and unscrupulous.. but there are still some heart of gold anyway.. 
<br /><br />All Vienamese are trying their best to help the victims and their relation, but nothing we can do with their pain, their lost! What we can do is share the pain and help them to build new life, without their husband, their son... their life must be so hard. 
<br /><br />Vietnamese and i - myself - will pray for them.. hope that they'll strongly recover soon from such tragic accident..

<br /><br />I feel like a fool.. 
<br /><br />How ashamed I was!! Hasty believed in the rumor about his condition, and then worried, and cried. 
<br /><br />The Ko fans confirmed that his pain was not as serious as I thought.. &gt;.&lt;.. Since it’s not the spinal problem, so he’ll be ok soon.
<br /><br />However, I was so anxious like a chicken at that time.. cackle, cackle over and over like a hen.. 
<br /><br />How stupid I was.. 
<br /><br />And what’s next? 
<br /><br />Flooded his Iple message box with those ashamed words.. 
<br /><br />He’ll doubled up with laughter for sure if he caught my those stupid messages by a change.. T____________T 
<br /><br />Oh… my God.. I’ll erase them soon…
<br /><br />Hmm.. It’s not his fault at all… It’s all because I was so mudding at that time.. 
<br /><br />But, by this problem, I can feel how I love him, and care about him.. 
<br /><br />As long as he has a happy life, it’s enough…

<br /><br />So, finally this day came... 
<br /><br />It's also my first abroad trip, but i worried nothing.. I didn't know why.. Perhaps because i was too old??!!?? (or too risky ^__^) In my mind, there was only the desire to see my little man.. hahahha.. 
<br /><br />This morning, Sandy-san even set a terrible status on her Yahoo messenger:
<br /><br />'OH MY BEAUTY.. I'M COMING' 
<br /><br />Ahahhahah....  Everybody laughed to die at her status.. What a flaunt and queer status it is!!
<br /><br />Our flight was at 6:30PM, but i was being chased by the Publishing House..People were screamming for the manuscripts..  .. poor me.. After several hours of swimming in translation, I completed and sent the manuscrips at 3:30PM, then, rushed to the airport.. 
<br /><br />Sandy and me came to the airport at 4:15PM. It was so early.. So, two talkative geeses chatted with each other excitedly.. so excitedly that they didn't realized the 'check in announcement' .. &lt;how ashamed!!&gt; 
<br /><br />5:30Pm, when Sandy and me went inside, the boarding was nearly closed.. ahahha.. but.. we were still on time.. hahaha.. so lucky.. 
<br /><br />The flight had been delayed about half of an hour.. But.. No problem.. we flew and landed safety.. 
<br /><br />9:30PM, We stepped out of the Suvarnabhumi airport.. 
<br /><br />My first impression about 's weather was much hoter than HoChiMinh city...
<br /><br />The second impression, tourists here were treated so well.. 
<br /><br />Our second language are English, Chinese (Me), and Korean (Sandy).. We don't know Thai language.. But the first moments, when we were still like fishes out of water, passed by soon.. Around the airport, there're so many shelves full of Bangkok Map which are free.. We got one as a souvenir - 'cos i've researched 
<br /><br />Next to the gate, standing a small table signed 'Public Taxi'.. Curiously, we came there.. ah.. What a surprise!! The staff is so friendly. We told him 'Khaosan' – the name of the street which we want to go. Immediately, he wrote down some Thai words into a piece of paper (i guess it was name of the street in Thai language), then he made careful recommendation about the taxi's free that i had to pay.. 
<br /><br />Taxi in 
<br /><br />Khaosan's a small but dense and lively street.. It was nearly midnight at that time, but there were so many people on the street.. 
<br /><br />At night, Khaosan is a walking street, there're so many foreigners here.. Europeans, American, Japaneses, Korean, Chinese.. etc..people were walking, talking, singing and even eating, drinking right on the street.. 
<br /><br />There're some tattoo services... (We got 2 strings of roast meat.. Wooaaa.. It's very delicious!! and ..so hot.. ^__^ &lt;of course&gt; Oishii!! 
<br /><br />11PM we checked in the Siam Oriental Hotel.. 
<br /><br />It's a very old hotel .. (or hostel).. the material facilities is in a bad condition.. I had to said that 
<br /><br />We were so surprised!!.. It was completely different from what we saw on internet.. &lt;It seemed that those pictures had been taken so long time ago.. T___T..&gt; Even the air conditioner didn't work... But we had no choice.. Linh-san would come to Sandy and me agreed that we would wait for Linh-san, and then three of us would move to another better hotel.. 
<br /><br />1PM, we went to a mini supermarket called '7/11 market' to buy 2 bottles of water. (There was no water in hotel). This time made the third impression about Two bottles of mineral water costed 24 baths, and we gave the cashier 500baths (in order to get some change), but the Cashier pretended that he only received 100baths, and stole our 476baths.. 
<br /><br />The cashier didn't speak English, he said so many things in Thai language which i couldn't understand at all.. 
<br />So tired to talk back, we walked back to our hotel with a bad impression.. 
<br /><br />Perhaps.. there're bad people everywhere.. in every country.. 
<br /><br />We went to sleep at 3PM, so, our first day in Bangkok ended
<br />(To be continuing)

<br /><br />Two dog-gone-lazy-cats (Sandy and me) woke up at 9AM for our free-breakfast.. (^___^ 'cos the hotel wouldn't serve free breakfast after 10AM.. and we're greedy people, so we had to wake up early if we didn't want to lose the FREE breakfast hahahahha..) 
<br /><br />The breakfast was rather good, but the coffee tasted so bad.. (as you know, i'm addicted to coffee.. without coffee i'll feel sleepy all day!!) 
<br /><br />After that, Sandy and me walked down the street.. 
<br /><br />Contrary to a lively and dense Khaosan at night, under the sunrise, the street became so quiet and bored.. All the shops and inns disappeared.. It seemed that all people were hiding somewhere from the baking sun .. There were only Tuk-Tuks parking along the street. 
<br /><br />In , Tuk-Tuk seems to be a very popular means of transport. (Bangkok for 10baths/person. He explained for the amazing-cheap price that wherever he brought Tourists to, he would be paid for that, so he could reduce the free. What a intelligent idea!!
<br /><br />So, we took Tuk-Tuk and started our small tour around BANGKOKG
<br /><br />Bangkok's rather similar to Ho Chi Minh, but hoter.. ^____^
<br /><br />King's pictures was being hung everywhere.. You can easily feel how Thail people respect their King.. 
<br /><br />deserves to be called the Buddhistic country.. There are so many temples.. Big and small Bangkok..
<br /><br />Our first stop was Standing eaJoong in the Bonjour Paris's Clip.. so, i tried to approach doves, but.. all the doves flied away immediately.. hahahhahaha.. 
<br /><br />Perhaps they knew that i'm dangerous &lt;They don’t want to be roasted hahahha&gt;The statue of Buddha is so high and big... We took pictures and moved on to the next place..
<br /><br />The second stop was another temple.. This temple is so wide and solemn. When Sandy and me were taking picture in font of the Temple, a man came by and helped us to take picture for 2 of us.. At first, this man thought that we were Korean.. ( i thought it was because of Sandy's hair style).. &lt; SPAN&gt;After knowing that we're Vietnameses, he asked if we came all the way to Sea Game.. Sandy and me tried to hide our true thinking, nodded with a smirk..  (And we agreed that from now on the 24th Sea Game would be the reason for our trip to Bangkok hahahha)
<br /><br />The Temple&quot; &lt; s P way.. my lost nearly we that wide and beautiful so&gt; 
<br /><br />Our third stop was a jewelry shop named Chaang Collection.. and that's the place where we spent 2800baths for a pair of Blue Saphire ear-ring.. (In fact, i was not so interested in jewel but ruby.. I love Red.. i love red stone such as ruby or even red crystal.. But.. i couldn't find out a suitable one) 
<br /><br />We left the shop to continue our tour.. 
<br /><br />It was nearly midday, we were walking along the street when suddenly something caught my attention.. Woaa.. It was a poster of TVXQ hanging on a shop...It was a big, black poster on which our beloved boys’ picture was printed.. That poster advertised for the O concert on this 15-16 Dec... 
<br /><br />So happy.. I shouted out loud excitedly like a child... right on the street ..  &lt;How ashamed i was!!&gt; To me, it was a very lovely surprise!! 
<br /><br />That day ended when we were completely exhausted, back to the Hotel, and chatted with each other till 3PM.. 
<br /><br />&lt;To be continue&gt;

<br /><br />PART 1: WALKING DAY
<br /><br />This day started as normal. Sandy and me woke up at 09:30, rushed to the down stair restaurant for our Free breakfast.. 
<br /><br />That day, weather was so nice, sky was so blue, the sun was shining brightly.. There was no strange omen which warned us about what would really happen.. We completely didn't know that it would be our unforgettable day.. 
<br /><br />After finished our Breakfast, we decided to go to Alek 's place.. 
<br /><br />(Alek's a passionate fan of my little man - Yunho. We have met some times before.) 
<br />Alek arrived Bangkok at 12:00PM, rather late!! And as an innocent girl as Alek, it musted be her greatest endeavour.. So i like her.. (as you know, i like whoever do their best either in work or in their life!)
<br /><br />That morning, we asked another Tuk-Tuk to bring us to Alek's place. And in order to get a cheaper transportation free, we agreed to make a tour at a famous Jelwery Factory. In fact, this Factory took much our time (and money as well T__T) So, we came to Alek's place about 11:00AM. T_______T Alek left hotel for a walk already!! 
<br /><br />Couldn't stay there and wait for Alek, Sandy and me decided to walk straight to Bangkok central, We walked along Sukhumvit street, took pictures and window shopping on BMK and Siam Paragon which are Thai very famous Shopping centrals.
<br /><br />I have to say that Thai people are very friendly with tourists. But not many of them know English.. what a pity!! 
<br /><br />We walked on the sky-walk which was above the bustling and full of cars streets. Along the sky-walk, there were pieces of paper being hung. Thai people wriite their wishes on those papers and hang them up so that they'll become true someday.. (What a childlish but romantic way of thinking.. ^_____^)
<br /><br />The MBK and Siam Paragon are very big, we lost our way easily.. .. I had to ask for direction several times. It was right on sale off season.. But we didn't have much money.. Just window shopping ..  Poor us!!!
<br /><br />There were still beggars in Bangkok, but they only stayed on silence.. And it made me repest them much.. 
<br /><br />The shop keepers in Thailand was so kind.. Eventhough we went round and round, and brought nothing, but they didn't blame me a word or else.. (It's a great stride in Thai Travel business)
<br /><br />02:30 PM, Sandy and me stopped at a Pizza shop for lunch.. After that we planned to go to Ariston Hotel where there would be DBSK's Fan meeting at 06:30PM. 
<br /><br />BUT THE PROBLEM WAS THAT WE FORGOT THE ADRESS ALREADY!!!
<br /><br />The only detail i remembered was the name of this hotel and it was located in Sukhumvit Road.. That's all!! Haahahhaha.. 
<br /><br />And so, two stubborn-crazy-girls kept on going without any clue about where to go till 06:00PM.. 
<br /><br />At that time, our legs cramped all over.. So far we had nearly gone around Bangkok by walk..
<br /><br />Finally, we found out a small internet-coffee shop. We hurried searching for the Hotel address and then rushed to the sky-train station in order to catch the sky-train to Ariston Hotel. 
<br /><br />In fact, we were so near to that hotel, but we had no time..

<br /><br /><strong>PART 2: FAN MEETING</strong>
<br /><br />When we arrived the hotel, there was a bus standing in font of the hotel, on which we could see a huge banner wrote 'DBSK FC in Indonesia.. ^_____^
<br /><br />Thai FC rented a whole ballroom for the meeting. It was a rather big ballroom. DBSK's posters were hung all over the walls. There was a stage with a large screen right in the middle of the end of the room. 
<br /><br />On the left side, there were 5 dummies swearing 5 black and white suites. At a glance, we could easily recognize that they looked like the suites that DBSK swore in Album 'Prince of Prague'.. 
<br /><br />There were 2 tables where we registered our names, paid the meeting free and received a picture of which member we love.. 
<br /><br />I've got a Yunho's pic and the last JeaJoong's pic for Sandy-san. Some unlucky girls who came later cried out jelously, but Sandy didn't care..She seemed so happy with the pic. 
<br /><br />(Alek came to the meeting rather late, she caught a taxi but being stuck in the traffic jam, so she had to get Tuk-Tuk.. )
<br /><br />It was 07:00 when the light went off suddenly, the meeting started. 
<br /><br />The music rose up.. Immediately, the room resounded with sounds of joy - It was DBSK's Rising Sun.. 5 young girls appear on the main stage, did the lip sync and tried to immitate DBSK's dance.. They performed 3 songs, The way you are, O and Rising Sun. Their movement was quite right for an amateur.. Every body seemed to be so excited, the screams were everywhere.. 
<br /><br />Next, Thai FC presented the Fan-make video clips. Some clips were so meaningful, and overflowed with love.. Both technical and idea were very good for amateurs. Some of them really made me feel that they must have loved DBSK as much as i do... I was so touch - we're sharing the same love... 
<br /><br />Then the program went on. Thai FC sold 5 black and white suites by auction. They said that he boys really wore those suites, but i didn't think so.. The auction finished when 3 of those suites was sold.
<br /><br />At that time, the two MC started a funny game called 'Dance battle'.. That was the time when i felt very uneasy.. 
<br /><br />It's my own and private feeling, I'm a traditional, old fashioned and strict person. In my opinion, i don't like those dancing movements. 
<br /><br />At first, a little girl (who took part as Micky in the previous performances) came to the stage, she showed her cute dance, &amp; i clapped my hand much. 
<br /><br />Then, another young girl joined the match with her provocative dance.. 
<br /><br />My face became sulky, i cannot stand such action in her age.. right at a public place like there...Her action would make a bad impression about DBSK on old folks. If the parents of this girl had seen their beloved daughter's sexy dance, how could they have thought highly of DBSK?? - that was what plashed through my mind at that time&lt; I cannot refuse the truth that i was so old now.. &gt; 
<br /><br />Sighhhed.. 
<br /><br />Suddenly, i felt out of tune.. Everybody enjoyed the show very much.. Even Sandy.. 
<br /><br />There was only me who felt that strange way.. I didn't know why.. But i really couldn't stand, so i went to the restroom - i didn't want to keep watching those performance anymore.. 
<br /><br />It was nearly 09:30 PM when MC introduced an hounoured guest. He was the Promoter of the Yamaha company which was in charge of DBSK concert in He greeted everybody and then announced that DBSK had just come to airport and was on the way to Bangkok central.
<br /><br />Hearing it, Sandy and me burst out laughing.. It was exactly time Linh-san came to Bangkok too.. I asked Sandy if Linh could know that she was about few meters away from her dearest Yunnie, then how would she feel!!  The promoter said that the boys' flight arrived at 09:30PM, then they would rehearse at Impact Areana at 11:00PM till 03:00AM ..&lt;What a packed schedule!! I've to say&gt; 
<br /><br />Suddenly, Alek and about ten Vietnamese girls asked us to go along to Muang Thong Thani for the rehearsal.. She said that there was a Reporter promise to take them into the stadium. And It was a value change.. So she decide to do..
<br /><br />The scenery of seeing my little man in real life was very attracted, but Linh-san would come to Bangkok, eventhough i had leave her a message to check in and wait into our room, but She was all alone..
<br /><br />In contrary, Sandy seemed very excited, ignore my will, she pull me by the sleeve and draw me to the Taxi...
<br /><br />So we went to Muang Thong Thani.. 
<br /><br />It was about 10:00 PM.. 
<br /><br />&lt;To be continued&gt;
