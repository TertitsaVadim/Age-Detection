You may find swelling, irritation or burning in your eyebrows, eyes, lips or whatever area has been treated, a week or two after the procedure. It is similar to a skin wound, which needs care and medications to heal quickly and effectively.
<br /><br />If you have just come from your dermatologist after your beauty enhancing permanent makeup procedure, these may be the teeny weenie tips you need to know until your body parts are completely healed and ready to shine:
<br /><br />•    You might feel the burning sensations on your brows, lips or eyes, but don’t give in to the temptation of running to the freezer and place wet chill ice cubes, as they may damage the cells. The best way to cool your burning is to softly cool the skin with dry cold pack a few times. But don’t overdo it.
<br /><br />•    Keep the area covered all the time with healing ointment. You can use your favorite vitamin-enriched healing ointments.
<br /><br />•    Take complete bed rest for at least 2 days after the procedure as rest will increase healing process.
<br /><br />•    Do not touch, tease, scratch or scrub the pigmented area, as it may result in serious complications. Fight any temptation to do so and wait patiently for the pigmented area to peel off
<br /><br />•    Do not expose the area to a full pressure shower, before taking a shower, apply a thick layer of Vaseline and then take a bath.
<br /><br />•    Sleep straight for the first couple of days, as any touch of the pigmented area with the pillow might cause delay in healing.
<br /><br />•    Stay away from direct sun exposure or using any sun block cream for the first couple of days.
<br /><br />The full healing of the <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNyb2FydG1ha2V1cC5jb20v" target="_blank">permanent makeup</a></strong> procedure takes about 2 months time. Within this time period stay away from swimming in chlorinated water, or using any anti-aging product. After two months, visit your dermatologist if any touch up is needed. Your permanent makeup color will fade to look natural after this time period, so you are ready to rock the world with dazzling beauty.

<br /><br />The five things I hate about permanent cosmetics procedure is not only about my choice, it’s about every single woman, who dreams of dazzling beauty. Let’s explore what they are, and how to find a best alternative.
<br /><br />1.    The Permanent Factor
<br /><br />Permanent makeup is PERMANENT, and this is what makes it least appealing of all! What if you want to change style, what if you don’t like your permanent makeup anymore! Well, considering a laser removing is a wrong option, as it may leave you with ugly looking scars.
<br /><br />2.    The Pain
<br /><br />Ah the pain of needle going into your skin and injecting pigments. Let me tell you, the pain is mind numbing and will leave your delicate skin swollen and wounded for a couple of days.
<br /><br />3.    The Risk Involved
<br /><br />I may bear the pain, forget the permanent factor, but I can never neglect the risk factors associated with permanent cosmetics. According to research, needles that are used for permanent makeup may contain toxic chemicals, which may result in deadly disease like skin cancer. Or the chemical laden pigments, which are used in this procedure, may not form a friendly bong with your body. Sometimes skin perceives these pigments as foreign objects and fights to keep them away, which may result in Keloid formation or scars.
<br /><br />4.    The Dreadful Possibility of Uneven Eyebrows
<br /><br />I have seen many women, crying and screaming on internet forums on their stupidity to go for permanent cosmetics, which resulted in extremely unattractive looking uneven, thick or too dark eyebrows. And the fact that they are permanent! God! You will want to kill yourself, if anything goes wrong.
<br /><br />5.    The After Effects
<br /><br />The <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNyb2FydG1ha2V1cC5jb20v" target="_blank">permanent cosmetics</a></strong> care just doesn’t end on the day of your appointment, it actually starts there. You will have to take care of a lot of things, to keep your pigments from changing color or fading. Sometimes your black may turn blue or your red may turn brown due to oxidization process, which is again an unwelcoming thing.
<br /><br />The Best Alternative
<br /><br />Still if you want something to uplift your beauty, then I would recommend you to go for semi-permanent makeup, the latest in this technology. Semi-permanent makeup fades away completely after three years with no down time. Plus, it is a pain-free process that delicately perks up your beauty with mineral pigments.

<br /><br />1950’s
<br /><br />In 1950’s eyebrows were more thickened and darkened, but the arch in the middle slightly became more sharp and visible.

<br /><br />1990’s
<br /><br />As the 90’s started, eyebrows took a more natural turn, only creating a medium thickness brow in the natural brow pattern become more trendy in this era.
<br /><br />Today’s eyebrows
<br /><br />After the 2012 fashion weeks, the hottest eyebrow style that has come at the forefront is thick bold eyebrows, like the 80’s.
<br /><br />With such a variation in eyebrows styles and trends, would you consider giving a permanent shape to your eyebrows with permanent eyebrows procedure? Well, if you are so unlucky to consider this option, then go for semi-permanent eyebrows procedure, which is the latest in this technology. It will create your <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNyb2FydG1ha2V1cC5jb20vYnJvd3Mv" target="_blank">permanent eyebrows</a></strong> only for 3 years, with no down time, and after that your eyebrows will naturally come back to your original shape, so you can consider other options according to new trends and fashion.

Not only celebrities but commoners are also going bananas over the technique. Whether it is <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNyb2FydG1ha2V1cC5jb20vYnJvd3Mv" target="_blank">permanent makeup eyebrows</a></strong> or permanent makeup lips, people consider it the best option to look dazzling all the times.

And you probably don’t want to be late from work every day. Well, to ease up your problems, why not you create the one time perfect eyebrow look and get <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNyb2FydG1ha2V1cC5jb20vYnJvd3Mv" target="_blank">permanent  makeup eyebrows</a></strong> on it!
<br /><br />The reason why I am asking you to create the look by yourself and then head out for permanent makeup eyebrows is because many clients these days don’t seem satisfy by the work of beauty artists. Hence, it’s good to do a little research on your own, and be the artist of your beauty by yourself. You don’t want to pay the price of other’s mistakes. Do you?
<br /><br />Creating perfect looking eyebrows may take a lot of your time, but the look is worth every effort. So let’s find out how to create a perfect permanent eyebrow look. You can also draw the look on your photo print and show it to your beauty artist to create a similar look in permanent eyebrows.
<br /><br />The beginning of the Brow
<br /><br />For wide eyes: If you have a very wide set of eyes, start your eyebrows by this method. Draw an imaginary straight line from the outer ball of your nose straight upward to your forehead, this is where your eyebrows should start. Beginning your brows with this method will make your eyes appear close together to create the right harmony.
<br /><br />For narrow eyes: If you have eyes that are too close together, use this method to draw the beginning of your brow. Draw an imaginary line from the inner corner of your eye straight to the forehead, finding out the point to begin your eyebrows. This method will make your eyes appear further.
<br /><br />The Arch of the Brow
<br /><br />To create the arch of the brow on the perfect position, place a ruler on the tip of your nose and take the ruler over the pupil of your eye to the forehead to discover the perfect position to create the peak of your brow, high or low, depending upon your facial type.
<br /><br />The End of the Brow
<br /><br />To find out the perfect for your brow, place the ruler at the outer nose to the corner of your eye to the forehead, discovering the point where your eyebrow should end.
<br /><br />Drawing eyebrows by this method create the perfect harmony between eyebrow and other facial features. You can show this homework to your beauty artist to create similar <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNyb2FydG1ha2V1cC5jb20vYnJvd3Mv" target="_blank">permanent eyebrows</a></strong>, or discuss the method with him to stay safe from any beauty blunder while creating permanent eyebrows.

As the fashion and beauty trends change, everybody wants and desires the change. These days no one can stick to old permanent methods and technologies for putting on makeup.
<br /><br />To cater to the revolutionizing needs of latest trends and beauty bazaar, semi-permanent makeup technology is grabbing all the attentions of celebrities and high-end people. Semi-permanent make up is basically a latest thing in beauty technology which uses natural mineral pigments to vibrate into the derma layer of skin, which completely fades away to natural look after three years.
<br /><br />Good news: you can enjoy a flawless beauty for three years, without the risk of removing old pigments with health hazard laser techniques. Plus, a three year time limit gives us the option of changing looks as per fashion needs.
<br /><br />In addition, the best thing about semi permanent makeup is that unlike permanent makeup, it won’t cause you that unbearable pain and wounds, as it doesn’t require hundreds of needles that go skin deep, causing immense physical pain and scarring. Semi-permanent technology needs only a single acupuncture needle to vibrate mineral pigments gently into the derma layer of skin.
<br /><br />Unlike <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNyb2FydG1ha2V1cC5jb20v" target="_blank">permanent make up</a></strong>, semi-permanent makeup doesn’t involve the risk of pigment fading, as many permanent makeup clients have reported issues of red pigment turning brown and black turning blue over a period of time, but this thing won’t happen with semi-permanent cosmetics.
<br /><br />Semi-permanent technology is new and innovative method, and not every tattoo artist can do it, hence it is important that you do a thorough research online and offline to find a renowned and experience cosmetologist, specialized in semi-permanent cosmetics procedure. You don’t want to take risks, when it is the matter of your precious beauty! Do you?

My friends, who had heavy eyebrows, used to tame them with waxing, tweezing or threading, but I never did, as my eyebrows are naturally very light and clean looking.
<br /><br />As I grew up, I heard about <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNyb2FydG1ha2V1cC5jb20vYnJvd3Mv" target="_blank">permanent makeup eyebrows</a></strong>, and the lengths that people go to make their eyebrows appear permanently well-shapes and beautiful and dark. Well, I considered them jerks, as I myself had never any problem with my natural eyebrows, until one day!
<br /><br />That one day, when I saw “Mirror Mirror”, and was mesmerized by Lily Collins natural beauty. At first I didn’t realize, it’s her dark shapely framed eyebrows, making her appear this much beautiful. But as I did a little research on her beauty, I was thrilled with this fact, that one features that makes her look super feminine and expressive is her raven bold eyebrows.
<br /><br />And that was the day, when I realized the importance of eyebrows in looking beautiful. I pick a brow pencil and colored my eyebrows a bit darker and thicker for the very first time, and I couldn’t believe the beautiful woman standing in the mirror is me! Yes, me with my new dark bold eyebrows, as I color them now every day!
<br /><br />However, this one discovery has exceeded my morning makeup regime to a considerable period of time, which is not a suitable option for a working woman like me, and I am beginning to realize why people, especially women have gone so bananas for permanent makeup eyebrows procedure, as this really helps them lift up their beauty sans effort every morning!
<br /><br />And now I am the latest addition to the roster of people considering <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNyb2FydG1ha2V1cC5jb20vYnJvd3Mv" target="_blank">permanent makeup eyebrows</a></strong> as it is the best option to enhance their facial features, but I am not foolish enough to do it without any research. Plus, I have heard semi-permanent makeup eyebrows procedure is considered the hottest in this technique, and I am definitely and completely thinking to get it done!

Right out of the 80s, the Elizabeth Taylor look is back in tinsel town.

<br /><br />Talking about the latest runways, top notch designers like Derek Lam, Thakoon, Dolce Vita have send models down the runway with extremely raw looking thick and angular eyebrows to create a strong effect.
<br /><br />Hollywood Celebrities
<br /><br />Lily Collins
<br /><br />After watching her latest flick “Mirror Mirror” I know you have already fallen in love with bold eyebrows. But let me make it official, Lily Collins has extremely expressive raven eyebrows, and she has always liked to keep them bold.
<br /><br />Erin O'Connor

<br /><br />Kim Kardashian
<br /><br />Hate her or not, but Kim Kardashian insists on having thick brows to accentuate her fake apples and tan!
<br /><br />Agyness Deyn
<br /><br />Model Agyness Deyn is another beauty, who is known for carrying thing dark brows. In spite of her blonde hair, she insists on having black eyebrows, which gives a super uplift to her strong features.
<br /><br />Semi Permanent Eyebrows
<br /><br />Semi-permanent eyebrows are so ‘in’ these days for people, who have thin, naturally light brows. Light brows never accentuate the facial features as the bold thick brows do. And creating eyebrows daily with a brow is a hell of trouble, so women, especially working women, consider the option of semi permanent eyebrows procedure, which gives them 3 years of enjoying dazzling brows without any effort!
<br /><br />However, going for <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNyb2FydG1ha2V1cC5jb20vYnJvd3Mv" target="_blank">permanent eyebrows</a></strong> or semi-permanent eyebrows, consider doing a full on extensive research and find yourself an experienced cosmetologist, who may successfully perk up your beauty with perfect amount of color, brow arch, length and thickness.

And with the introduction of permanent makeup procedure, women started to dream about waking up with a perfectly dazzling beauty that will not wash off or smudge.
<br /><br />However, technology keeps changing, while permanent makeup is a thing from 60s! It involves heavy gauge needles to penetrate deep into the skin causing extreme pain, bleeding, bruising or scabbing that may take a lot of time to heal.
<br /><br />These days <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNyb2FydG1ha2V1cC5jb20vYnJvd3Mv" target="_blank">permanent makeup eyebrows</a></strong> are so immensely popular, but the pigments which are used in permanent makeup may or may not be good hygienically and may change color over a period of time. Talking about semi-permanent makeup and what makes it better then permanent makeup is the fact that it is not permanent and uses an advance form of micro-art technology to do the process.
<br /><br />The area around the eyes and lips is very delicate, and one wrong move might damage your eye forever, hence it is always best to find out the latest technology for permanent makeup eyebrows and go for it. Semi-permanent makeup uses a single acupuncture needle to vibrate into the derma layer of skin, which keeps the over all process, risk-free, painless and light on skin.

I Am Glad I Did It!<br/><br/>I have always fidgeted on the concept of <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNyb2FydG1ha2V1cC5jb20vYnJvd3Mv" target="_blank">permanent eyebrows</a></strong>, because of the great risks; I’ve read everywhere online and bad permanent eyebrows stories. Although I naturally have very thin and light eyebrows, yet I didn’t have the courage to go for permanent eyebrows until one day!
<br /><br />One day when one of my colleagues got her eyebrows done, it was the moment, when I had to change my mind, because she looked incredibly new and fresh with just a hint of new darker permanent eyebrows. Actually it was not permanent eyebrows procedure she went for; it was semi-permanent eyebrows procedure, which looked incredibly natural and beautiful.
<br /><br />As I went to my dermatologist, she suggested me a 3 times course process for permanent eyebrows and eyelids, starting from very light permanent eyebrows, and then moving on to darker and thicker ones, as per choice. So I was relaxed about not looking like a vampire with bushy eyebrows!
<br /><br />As I went for my first permanent eyebrows appointment, she made very soft looking eyebrows, which looked great and immensely built up my confidence for a second trip, which again resulted in even better looking eyebrows.
<br /><br />I love the fact that I don’t have to make up my eyebrows now every morning, and feel like I have naturally beautiful eyebrows. But as crazy as I have become about permanent eyebrows, I am looking forward to bring in more drama with my third time appointment. I am really looking forward to rock Lily Collins kind of eyebrows now!
<br /><br />And I must say the semi-<strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNyb2FydG1ha2V1cC5jb20vYnJvd3Mv" target="_blank">permanent eyebrows</a></strong> technique is just flawless, and creates a naturally beautifully look with natural pigments, but too bad, my eyebrows will fade away completely after three years, but great in a sense that after three years, I might consider some other eyebrow styles to rock on!

Let’s find out what they are!
<br /><br />1.    Oh! It takes an annoying amount of time!
<br /><br />I just hate the amount of time I take to apply eyeliner, and when I have to apply it in a hurry, oh don’t ask the troubles it gives to my shaking hands! If I had to minus just my eyeliner from my morning makeup regime, the rest would take just about five minutes, and it’s always this eyeliner, which takes the most of morning time.
<br /><br />2.    Uneven Eyeliner
<br /><br />I have never felt a pinch of satisfaction with the way I apply my eyeliner. It always seems uneven to me, I don’t know why I am unable to draw the exact same line on both eyes. And I hate when it goes like this: applying-removing-applying-removing! Ah 10 minutes passed! Forget it!
<br /><br />3.    How killingly important it is for me!

<br /><br />And from that day onwards, I started to literally fill my eyebrows every morning to create a darker thicker bold British look! But the only frustration I felt every day was about worrying if my thicker eyebrows may fade or smudge during the course of the day. Well, I am sure every woman feels the same, who is even a tiny bit concerned about her eyebrows.
<br /><br />And then a friend of mine told me about semi <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNyb2FydG1ha2V1cC5jb20vYnJvd3Mv" target="_blank">permanent makeup eyebrows</a></strong>! At first I was scared about the permanent nature of my eyebrows and the changing trends, and then I realize that for eyebrows, you never really have to go what the hottest trends say! Because eyebrows are something that never work equally for every face, as every face demands a different eyebrow shape and hence the option of semi permanent eyebrows can prove to be one of the best things you could do to enhance your beauty.
<br /><br />Plus, having semi permanent makeup eyebrows is something different from permanent eyebrows. Semi permanent eyebrows will fade away automatically without any laser involvement after three years, so you can consider changing your eyebrow shape according to your aging facial features.
<br /><br />Semi permanent makeup eyebrows procedure is an entirely latest technique, which cannot be done by your local tattoo maker, so make sure you find an experienced and well-known cosmetologist for this procedure.
<br /><br />Despite reading all those risks involved, I did an extensive research and after two months of my research and findings, I dared to change my look with semi permanent eyebrows! Just as I was expecting, when I looked at the mirror, I found a totally new face with defined features and a more symmetrical face!
<br /><br /><strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNyb2FydG1ha2V1cC5jb20vYnJvd3Mv" target="_blank">Permanent eyebrows</a></strong> have excluded the half of my daily makeup effort, because creating perfect eyebrows every morning was really a tough job for a normal working woman like me. I am enjoying my new look and would definitely suggest the same procedure, who are facing troubles to carry out their daily make up regime everyday!

Is it your fault or Cosmetologist’s?<br/><br/>I have seen many women, who in their beauty frenzy, made hasty not-so-smart decision and got permanent eyebrows from their local cosmetologist or tattoo artist, and the results were horrifying, completely dreadful!
<br /><br />Similarly, you will find a number of women crying and yelling about their <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNyb2FydG1ha2V1cC5jb20vYnJvd3Mv" target="_blank">permanent makeup eyebrows</a></strong> decision, and even degrading the art, which has given a beautiful life to so many out there. After reading those reviews online, I have developed a really bad image about permanent makeup or permanent eyebrows artists/cosmetologists, thinking that they have ruined the lives of many people.
<br /><br />On the other hand, I have also seen women enjoying their perfectly created permanent eyebrows, and when they are asked to describe their experience, they come up with nothing negative at all about the procedure.
<br /><br />The question that really arises over here is, that is it the fault of these women or the cosmetologists that results in bad permanent eyebrows. I would say that it really is the fault of clients, who without doing proper research and homework, grab any cheap non-experienced cosmetologist - or in the worst case scenario, tattoo artists, and get their work done, on instinct basis! These are the clients, which are never satisfied with the results, and keep on yelling and degrading the art of permanent makeup!
<br /><br />On the other hand, the clients, who were smart enough to do a proper research on finding an experienced cosmetologist, a research on what style of permanent eyebrows will look good on them, and were alert enough to make sure the equipment and the pigments being used upon them are fully safe and sterilized, really seemed to be happy with the results.
<br /><br />Take the smart decisions and always do proper research needed before taking any kind of step for your beauty! Whether your mistake is as small as grabbing a wrong product for your skin type or as big as getting <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNyb2FydG1ha2V1cC5jb20vYnJvd3Mv" target="_blank">permanent eyebrows</a></strong> done without research, it has the potential to kill your beauty forever!

Yes you can pretend the magic of flawless skin using makeup cosmetics, but what about when you wake up in the morning, or wash your face before going to bed, the magic will be gone!
<br /><br />We can cure acne or pimples with acne products, but we cannot bring that youthful baby like skin glowing with a creamy soft texture, and that’s true. However, one thing can do it. No, I am not talking about laser treatments; they are harsh on skin and may bring bad results. I am talking about <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNyb2FydG1ha2V1cC5jb20v" target="_blank">permanent make up</a></strong>.
<br /><br />Yes permanent makeup is not only about creating eyebrows, eyelids or lips, in the latest semi permanent makeup technology; there is a revolutionary new introduction for scar camouflage technique, which can literally camouflage all of your facial scars, blemishes and any ugly looking marks.
<br /><br />Semi permanent makeup technology is preferred more these days as compared to permanent make up because it is much safer and advance technique that uses mineral pigments to vibrate into the derma layer of skin. Mineral pigments are completely natural and do not possess the harm of any toxic substance, thereby they are much safe to use on sensitive facial skin.
<br /><br />Scar Camouflage technique requires extensive experience and cannot be done by any local cosmetologist. For this technique your cosmetologist will first analyze your skin tone and texture to use the most matched mineral pigments with your skin and will then carefully camouflage any ugly looking flaw to give you a perfectly looking skin for three years.
<br /><br />Moreover, mineral semi <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNyb2FydG1ha2V1cC5jb20v" target="_blank">permanent makeup</a></strong> will not leave your skin dull and wrinkled after the permanent make up has faded to a completely natural look. Also, the process is less painful and requires no extensive time for healing. So stop spending money on expensive products, which do nothing to make your skin squeaky clean, and adopt the tech-licious way to perk up your beauty!

The relationship that every woman feels with her eyeliner is based on absolute necessity. She may go without mascara, she may even go without lipstick, but she would never feel comfortable without her dear eyeliner!
<br /><br />These days’ <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNyb2FydG1ha2V1cC5jb20v" target="_blank">permanent eyeliner</a></strong> procedure is the hottest topic of discussion between women, as they talk about its unavoidable temptation and the dreams of waking up beautifully, along with dangerous risks involved in the permanent eyeliner process.
<br /><br />Talking about the risks that are involved in the process, then I must say there would be a 0% chance of risks, if you do your research properly, find an experienced well-known cosmetologist, not your local tattoo artist, and follow the after-care instructions properly, you can successfully enjoy the charm of dazzling dark and killer eyes, without you doing the effort everyday!
<br /><br />Also, many women worry about the fact that the procedure will happen close to the eye area, which is very sensitive and might take a lot of time for healing. But let me clear the fact, permanent makeup across eye area is much easier to heal then permanent makeup across lip area. But make sure your beauty artist is using all the sterilized and disposable equipments to stay safe from this risk of getting infection and other disease.
<br /><br />In addition, if you want more safety and latest fashion trends are your top priority, then you can go for semi-permanent eyeliner, as it is the most advance technology and is much safer. After three years, your semi-permanent eyeliner will remove automatically revealing your natural eyes, so you can consider changing the style of your eyeliner and remain up to date!
<br /><br />Above all, the best part about <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNyb2FydG1ha2V1cC5jb20v" target="_blank">permanent eyeliner</a></strong> is that at least you won’t have the trouble to apply your eyeliner daily in the morning or in hurry, because you will have already beautiful eyes for three full years! All you’ll have to do it to glam them up with a little color and mascara, and there you go, all the way! Dazzling and beautiful!

You may feel very happy with your permanent make up look in the beginning, but as the time changes, and new fashion trends keep coming in, you might become fed up of your same permanent make up look!
<br /><br />Or in worse cases, some women doesn’t find their permanent eyebrows or lips attractive even at the first sight, and immediately after getting permanent makeup on, they want to remove it because of unsatisfactory results. However, removing a permanent make up is not an easy and inexpensive task! There are a number of options for removing permanent makeup, but it’s your duty to consider the best choice, when it is the matter of your beauty!
<br /><br />1.    The most considered option for removing permanent make up is Laser treatment, which is an expensive process and may not completely remove your permanent pigments. Laser removing treatments comes with a number of pros and cons and its own:
<br /><br />•    Laser cannot remove all the permanent pigments. The easiest to remove color pigments are shades of green, black, red and blue.
<br /><br />•    It can cause bleeding, Keloid formation or may leave scars on your skin.
<br /><br />•    It is extremely expensive and doesn’t come with any insurance plan.
<br /><br />2.    Dermabrasion is another option to remove permanent makeup and involves removing the pigmented skin with a wire brush or diamond wheel and allowing a new layer of skin to grow
<br /><br />•    This process can cause scarring
<br /><br />•    After healing the color of the skin turns darker where dermabrasion has been done
<br /><br />•    Deep dermabrasion may leave scars on face.
<br /><br />3.     Salabrasion is another method to remove unwanted tattoos or permanent make up. It involves rubbing the skin harshly with an exfoliator and sea salt, until you are bleeding, and the upper epidermal layers of skin is completely washed off.
<br /><br />•    This process involves extreme pain and bleeding
<br /><br />•    There is a higher risk of infection
<br /><br />•    May leave deep scars for a long period of time.
<br /><br />As risky and dangerous as the above mentioned methods are for <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNyb2FydG1ha2V1cC5jb20v" target="_blank">permanent make up</a></strong> removal, the better and much safer option is semi-permanent makeup. These days semi-permanent makeup is considered much better option, because it automatically removes the permanent make up after a specific period of time, so that you may not have to face above mentioned deadly processes for removing your unwanted permanent make up.

		<document id="dd3c8f4af2e92ae2b0dd26b97e363ad2" url=""><![CDATA[Permanent Makeup – Things to consider before you do it!<br/><br/>The first thought that comes to my mind for <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNyb2FydG1ha2V1cC5jb20v" target="_blank">permanent makeup</a></strong> is that it is PERMANENT! Yeah, exactly that can be a little bit scary, but not if you do the proper research and get involved in the process along your beauty artist.
<br /><br />The reason that I have used the word “Beauty Artist” is that consulting a beauty artist before a permanent makeup cosmetologist is a step that you must take, because your beauty artist can guide you perfectly for a number of things, including colors, styles, shape and the area that should be pigmented.
<br /><br />The biggest mistake that almost most people do is that they forget that every pigment exhibits a different color after mixing with the original skin tone. Come on! Have you forgotten the color wheel you studied in high school! For example, a yellowish skin tone will react different with a certain pigment that a white skin tone. Thereby it is very important to plan a prior meeting with your cosmetologist and discuss each and everything, which is bothering you.
<br /><br />Plus, there are different technologies used these days under the umbrella of permanent makeup. For example, semi-permanent makeup, which in my view is a better option. So discuss with your cosmetologist about what kind of latest technologies are there, how are they implemented and which is the better option.
<br /><br />Another thing to consider is the pain factor. Yes when there are many needles being injected in your skin, the pain will be there, so always ask your cosmetologist to give you anesthesia, and be VERY VERY SURE that your cosmetologist is not adding the anesthetic to the ink itself, as that can be very dangerous. If you are going for permanent lip color, be careful with topical anesthetics on the mucosa of the lips.
<br /><br />Ask your cosmetologist to analyze your skin tone and texture and use the pigments accordingly. If possible you can ask them to draw a digital picture of you with <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNyb2FydG1ha2V1cC5jb20v" target="_blank">permanent makeup</a></strong>, so that you can make sure prior to procedure that nothing scary or ugly is in the grounds for you!
<br /><br />And finally the most important factor above all is finding a well-reputable and experienced cosmetologist. If your cosmetologist is experienced, he will definitely erase half of your troubles with expert advice. Plus you can also ask him to give you contact numbers of his previous clients, so that you can learn from their experiences. Take each step very cautiously as it is the matter of your most important asset!

Yeah, some women are, including me! If you are one of those women, who feel “naked” if she is not wearing her mysterious black eyeliner, then yes, permanent eyeliner can save half of your makeup regime time!
<br /><br />Plus, I have always tend to wash my face during office hours, yes may be in the middle of the day, to click the refresh button, and at that time I hate to reapply my makeup, that and there are so many other moments, when women completely want to apply their dear eyeliner, but Alas they don’t have time! Well, the only solution that seems reasonable and safe at this time is permanent eyeliner! Safe, if you do the desired result pre-procedure and extensive care after-procedure!
<br /><br />So if you have just come home with brand new permanent eyeliner, this is what you need to know!
<br /><br />1.    Treated area remains tender and very sensitive until the wound is completely healed so avoid the temptation to scratch.
<br /><br />2.    If your permanent eyeliner feels puffy, apply cold wet cotton pads soaked in distilled water and baby oil. Chill pads in freezer for 4 to 5 minutes and then apply them on your eyes softly.
<br /><br />3.     Keep the pigmented area moist all time with Vaseline, A &amp; D ointment or Lanolin. To apply them on your permanent eyeliner, use a Q – Tip or micro Q – Tip. Please do not scrape the sealant directly on the pigmented area, only place it gently on your eyeliner and it will melt automatically with your natural body heat.
<br /><br />4.    As the pigmented area is in healing period, it is likely to form a crust on the healing area. Avoid scratching and removing the crust with excessive use of water and let the wound heal by on its own gradually. DO NOT PEEL, SCRATCH OR EXFOLIATE!
<br /><br />5.    Wear sunglasses, whenever you are out to protect your healing <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNyb2FydG1ha2V1cC5jb20v" target="_blank">permanent eyeliner</a></strong> from direct sun exposure.
<br /><br />6.    Do not wear contact lenses for at least 24 hours after your permanent eyeliner procedure.
<br /><br />7.    Old and used makeup cosmetics possess higher risk of infection. After your permanent eyeliner is completely healed, start with fresh mascaras and kohl-pencils and eye shades.
<br /><br />8.    Do not use eyelash curlers for 2 weeks after your procedure.
<br /><br />9.    If you were using Emu oil prior permanent makeup procedure, discontinue using it after your procedure as it may cause your pigment color to bleed or migrate.
<br /><br />10.    Do not take hot water baths, steam, and saunas for a week after your procedure.

<br /><br />•    Taking a shower will not harm your permanent eyebrows, however, it is important to coat your brows with a thick layer of Vaseline, before taking shower and avoid any product with Glycolic, Hydroxyl or Fruit Acid until your pigmented area is fully healed.
<br /><br />•    Keep your pigmented area safe from sun, by using a sun screen. This tip is not only until your area is healed, this tip is advised to practice for life time, because sun usually quicken the fading process of pigments.

Can’t afford to get late from work every day, what would I tell my boss, the reason for my being late is a little EYELINER!!! Well, the bosses can never understand, but I am sure you do!
<br /><br />Well, these are the problems of bygone days, when I was literally unaware of this tech-miracle called <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNyb2FydG1ha2V1cC5jb20v" target="_blank">permanent eyeliner</a></strong>. I could not believe I can enjoy my sexy black eyeliner literally ALL THE TIME! But yes, this is true! I did my research and found a well-known cosmetologist. I was off course a little bit worried, but she did a wonderful job! So let me tell you the five things I absolutely and completely love about my permanent eyeliner!
<br /><br />1.    I wake up from my beauty sleep with no fear of wasting time on eyeliner; I just have to put a little mascara to perk up my amazing eyes. Being a women, and after 15 years of dealing with eyeliners, I feels just amazing to have a permanent eyeliner on my eyes.
<br /><br />2.    I love the fact that I have literally stop looking for expensive eyeliners, I am such a big fan of eyeliners that my eye pencil used to end up within 3 months, and I had to buy a new eyeliner, but now my permanent eyeliner keeps me stress-less after seeing expensive eyeliners.
<br /><br />3.    I love the mess-free, smudge-free look of my new permanent eyeliner. I no more have to worry exercising in the hot days of summer! My sweat can drip on my eyes or my neck, I remain always confident!
<br /><br />4.    Swimming is fun with my <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNyb2FydG1ha2V1cC5jb20v" target="_blank">permanent eyeliner</a></strong>. Well, I was strictly prohibited to swim in chlorinated water in the healing time period of my liner, but now as it’s completely healed, I can swim all day without a fear of washing off my dear eyeliner.
<br /><br />5.    I don’t have to worry about removing my eyeliner before falling asleep. It’s just like my eyes have naturally become large and beautiful, and it’s amazing!
