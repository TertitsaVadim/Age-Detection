You think when Jesus comes back he ever wants to see a fucking cross? It's like going up to Jackie Onassis wearing a rifle pendant?!&quot;
<br /><br />“No, I don't do drugs anymore, either. But I'll tell you something about drugs. I used to do drugs, but I'll tell you something honestly about drugs, honestly, and I know it's not a very popular idea, you don't hear it very often anymore, but it is the truth: I had a great time doing drugs. Sorry. Never murdered anyone, never robbed anyone, never raped anyone, never beat anyone, never lost a job, a car, a house, a wife or kids, laughed my ass off, and went about my day.”
<br /><br />&quot;You know the world's 12 thousand years old and dinosaurs existed, they existed in that time, you'd think it would have been mentioned in the fucking Bible at some point. &quot;And lo Jesus and the disciples walked to Nazareth. 
<br /><br />But the trail was blocked by a giant brontosaurus... with a splinter in his paw. And O the disciples did run a shriekin': 'What a big fucking lizard, Lord!' But Jesus was unafraid and he took the splinter from the brontosaurus's paw and the big lizard became his friend. 
<br /><br />And Jesus sent him to Scotland where he lived in a loch for O so many years inviting thousands of American tourists to bring their fat fucking families and their fat dollar bills.And oh Scotland did praise the Lord. Thank you Lord, thank you Lord. 
<br /><br />Thank you Lord.&quot; &quot;Get this, I actually asked one of these guys, OK, Dinosaurs fossils - how does that fit into you scheme of life? Let me sit down and strap in. He said, &quot;Dinosaur fossils? God put those there to test our faith.&quot; I think God put you here to test my faith, Dude. 
<br /><br />You believe that? &quot;uh huh.&quot; Does that trouble anyone here? The idea that God.. might be.. fuckin' with our heads? I have trouble sleeping with that knowledge. Some prankster God running around: &quot;Hu hu ho. We will see who believes in me now, ha ha.&quot; [mimes God burying fossils] &quot;I am God, I am a prankster.&quot; &quot;I am killing Me.&quot;

<br /><br />She then tells the blonde passenger that she paid for Economy and that she will have to go and sit in the back.
<br /><br />The blonde replies, 'I'm blonde, I'm beautiful, I'm going to Melbourne and I'm staying right here!'
<br /><br />The flight attendant goes into the cockpit and tells the pilot and co-pilot that there is some blonde bimbo sitting in First Class that belongs in Economy that won't move back to her seat. 
<br /><br />The co-pilot goes back to the blonde and tries to explain that because she only paid for Economy she is only entitled to an Economy place and she will have to leave and return to her original seat.
<br /><br />The pilot says, 'You say she's blonde?' 'I'll handle this, I'm Married to a blonde, and I speak blonde!'
<br />He goes back to the blonde, whispers in her ear, and she says,
<br />&quot;Oh I'm sorry - I had no idea,&quot; 
<br /><br />She gets up and moves back to her seat in the economy section. The flight attendant and co-pilot are amazed and asked him what he said to make her move without any fuss. 
<br /><br />The pilot replied, &quot;I told her First Class isn't going to Melbourne.&quot;

<br /><br />Hi Guys,
<br /><br />During the last inspection it came to the owners attention that there is more than 4 people living in the property. Please advise / confirm as the owner has requested this information urgently.
<br /><br />As there is only 4 people on the lease and the applications were approved on this basis we must ask that the tenants (not currently listed on the lease) to fill out and submit application forms immediately.
<br /><br />Once this has been done we will be in contact to advise if the applications have been approved.
<br /><br />Yours Sincerely,

<br /><br />Jade,
<br /><br />There is definitely not more than 4 people living in the house and never has been. I will declare that formally if required. There may have been a guest staying at the time (but I don't think so) but this is unusual - unusual it would occur during the week that is.  
<br /><br />As you know Jade, we are 4 single young men making every day count. We feel we are at the peak of our powers right now and sometimes this involves us flexing it a little on the Sydney social circuit. I don't proclaim to be a rock star but I am not a homebody either - my fellow housemates will attest to this and I will attest to them in the same vein. Some things transcend from heightened social stamina and one of those Jade is over night guests. I think we both know what we're talking about.
<br /><br />So it seems we may simply be caught up on a definitional point. We only have 4 people living at Trelawney but we do have guests quite regularly. Babsy has more guests than Jonny for example but Jonny's standards are higher - that's neither here nor there.  
<br /><br />We work hard and we play hard Jade and unfortunately the play spills over a little but this does not constitute a breach of lease. All in all I think we are excellent tenants and hold the premises in high regard.
<br /><br />Please put this on the file.
<br /><br />Tim  
<br /><br />p.s. about that dinner we have been trying to organize, how about next week?

<br /><br />Hi Tim,
<br /><br />I've cleared it with the owners so everything should be fine now.
<br /><br />I hate it when old people act like that. They probably haven't seen any action for years. Old bastards causing me trouble!
<br /><br />About dinner, I've fairly busy next week but Wednesday or Thursday night are both free if that's okay with you. Let me know.

<br /><br />Why the f*** are people calling me and emailing me about your email?
<br /><br />I can't believe that you or your pathetic friends would be low enough to forward it around the internet like that.
<br /><br />People in my office think I'm a f***ing idiot because of it. I could lose my job over this!
<br /><br />Maybe I should send an email around telling everyone how f***ing tiny your cock is and how you were so useless in bed.

<br /><br />Jade,
<br /><br />I might save you the trouble and forward this around on your behalf.
<br /><br />While many people will certainly take offence to what I have said (and already have), the majority of people will get a good laugh at how low your self esteem must be to not only scramble around to save us from any trouble with the owners, but to also sleep with someone who clearly has no respect for you.
<br /><br />As for the size of my appendage and my performance in bed, I find this quite hard to understand. Not only do I have quite a few repeat customers, but you yourself seemed enthused the other night. Unless you were faking that. But if you do have the ability to fake coming multiple times then you may wish to consider a career in a different industry. I think we both know what I am taking about.
<br /><br />I am sorry if you do lose your job over the email. However, as I was not the one who forwarded the emails I am not THAT sorry. But if you do need a job, then I may be able to make some use of you over at our place. However you will not be able to live there: only 4 people on the lease you understand.
<br /><br />Tim

<br />register he realized he had forgotten to get condoms, so he asked the
<br />checkout girl if she could have some brought up to the register.
<br /><br />She asked, 'What size condoms?
<br /><br />The customer replied that he didn't know.
<br /><br />She asked him to drop his trousers.  He did.
<br /><br />She reached over the counter, grabbed hold of him and called over the
<br />intercom, 'One box of large condoms, Till 5.
<br /><br />The next man in line thought this was interesting and was up for a cheap
<br />thrill. When he got up to the register, he told the checker that he too
<br />had forgotten to get condoms, and asked if she could have some brought
<br />to the register for him.
<br /><br />She asked him what size, and he stated that he didn't know.
<br /><br />She asked him to drop his trousers.  He did.
<br /><br />She gave him a quick feel, picked up the intercom and said, 'One box of
<br />medium-sized condoms, Till 5.
<br /><br />A few customers back was this teenage boy. He thought what he had seen
<br />was way too cool. He had never had any type of s*x*al contact with a
<br />live female, so he thought this was his chance.
<br /><br />When he got to the till he told the checker he needed some condoms.

<br />A Minneapolis couple decided to go to Florida to thaw out during a
<br />particularly icy winter. They planned to stay at the same hotel where
<br />they spent their honeymoon 20 years before. Because of their hectic
<br />schedules, it was difficult to coordinate their travel schedules. So,
<br />the husband left Minneapolis and flew to Florida on Thursday, with his
<br />wife flying down the following day.
<br />The husband checked into the hotel, and unlike years ago, there was a
<br />computer in his room, so he decided to send an email to his wife.
<br />However, he accidentally left out one letter in her email address, and
<br />without noticing his error, sent the email.
<br />Meanwhile...somewhere in Houston, a widow had just returned home from
<br />her husband's funeral. He was a minister who was called home to glory
<br />after suffering a heart attack.
<br />The widow decided to check her email, expecting messages from relatives
<br />and friends. After reading the first message, she screamed and fainted.
<br />The widow's son rushed into the room, found his mother on the floor, and
<br />then glanced up and saw the computer screen which read:
<br /><br />To: My Loving Wife
<br />Date:   Thursday, October 13, 2004
<br />Subject: I have arrived!
<br /><br />Dearest Love:
<br />I know you are surprised to hear from me. They have computers here now,
<br />and you are allowed to send emails to your loved ones. I have just
<br />arrived and have been checked in.
<br />I see that everything has been prepared for your arrival tomorrow, and
<br />look forward to seeing you then. Hope your journey is as uneventful as
<br />mine was.

<br /><br />2. never hold her hand. this can be interpreted as a sign of weakness. (or if she grabs your hand squeeze hers really really hard until she cries. this will impress her by showing her what a strong man you are.)
<br /><br />3. once a month sneak up on her from behind and knock her over. girls are like dogs. they love to be roughed up.
<br /><br />4. call her in the middle of the night to ask if she's sleeping. if she is say you better be , repeat this 4 or 5 times until morning. this will show her you care.
<br /><br />5. when she is upset about something, suggest to her that it might be her fault. this will pave the way for her own personal improvement. and every girl needs some improvement.
<br /><br />6. recognize the small things . . . they usually mean the most. then when she's sleeping, steal all her small things and break them. because jewellery is for pussies and Asian ladies.
<br /><br />7. if you're talking to another girl, make sure she's looking. When she is, stare into her eyes mouth the words fuck you and grab the other girls ass. Girls love competition.
<br /><br />8. tell her you're taking her out to dinner. drive for miles so she thinks it's going to be really special. then take her to a burning tire yard. when she starts to get upset tell her you were just kidding and now you're really going to take her to dinner. then drive her home. when she starts crying and asks why you would do something like that lean over and whisper very quietly into her ear &quot;...because I can.&quot;
<br /><br />9. introduce her to your friends as &quot;some chick&quot;. women love those special nicknames.
<br /><br />10. play with her hair. play with it HARD.
<br /><br />11. warm her up when she's cold...and not by giving her your jacket... then you might get cold. rather, look her in the eye and say &quot;if you don't stop bitching about the cold right now you're going to be bitching about a black eye.&quot; the best way to get warm is with fear.
<br /><br />12. Take her to a party. When you get there she'll have to go to the bathroom (they always do). Leave immediately. Come back right when the party's dying and yell at her the whole way home for ditching you at the party.
<br /><br />13. make her laugh. a good way to do this is if she has a small pet. kick the pet. i always find stuff like that funny. why shouldn't girls?
<br /><br />14. let her fall asleep in your arms. when she's fast asleep, wait 10 minutes then JUMP UP AND SCREAM IN HER EAR! repeat until she goes home and you can use your arms for more important things. like basketball.
<br /><br />15. Spit often. I hear girls like guys that spit.
<br /><br />16. if you care about her never ever tell her. this will only give her self confidence. then you can never turn her into the object she deep down desires to be.
<br /><br />17. Every time you're in her house steal one of the following: shoes, earrings, or anything else that comes in pairs. Only take one of the pair. This way shell go crazy.
<br /><br />18. Take her out to dinner. Right when she's about to order interrupt and say no she's not hungry. make her watch you eat. Girls love a guy that speaks for her.
<br /><br />19. look her in the eyes and smile. then clock her one. girls love a spontaneous guy.
<br /><br />20. give her one of your t-shirts......and make sure it has your smell on it. but not a sexy cologne smell. a bad smell. you know what I'm talking about.
<br /><br />21. When its raining keep asking her if she's crying. She'll say no its just the rain ten minutes later turn to her and just scream at her to stop crying you fucking baby. Girls like a tough man as I've already stated.
<br /><br />22. Titty twisters and plenty of them.
<br /><br />23. if you're listening to music, and she asks to hear it, tell her no. this way she'll think you're mysterious.
<br /><br />24. remember her birthday but don't get her something. Teach her material objects aren't important. The only thing that's important is that she keeps you happy. And your happiness is the greatest present she can ever get.
<br /><br />25. when she gives you a present on your birthday, Christmas, or just when ever, take it and tell her you love it. then next time you know she's coming over on a trash day leave the trash can open and have the present visibly sticking out of the can. girls actually don't like this one that much but i think it's funny.
<br /><br />26. If she's mad at you for not calling her when you say you will promise her that you will call her at a certain time of the day. This will make sure that she waits by the phone. Tell her when you call you're going to tell her a special surprise. Now she'll be really excited. Now don't call.

<br /><br />TRIBUTES are being paid to Scotland this morning after the entire country laughed itself to death.
<br /><br />The alarm was first raised at around 10pm last night as thousands of phone calls and text messages went unanswered. 
<br /><br />Small groups of volunteers from Berwick-Upon-Tweed and Carlisle ventured north just after midnight only to find houses full of dead people gathered around still blaring television sets. 
<br /><br />By dawn, as RAF helicopters flew over deserted city streets, it was clear that the whole country had suffered a catastrophic abdominal rupture. 
<br /><br />Wayne Hayes, a special constable from Northumberland, said: &quot;We went into one house in Dunbar and found three men sitting on the sofa with huge smiles on their faces, still holding cans of 70 shilling. They seemed to be at peace.&quot; 
<br /><br />He added: &quot;In a house near Edinburgh we found a man face down on the living room floor with his trousers and pants round his knees. 
<br /><br />&quot;It seems he may have been showing his bare buttocks to the television when he keeled over.&quot;
<br /><br />Roy Hobbs, a civil engineer from Northampton, said: &quot;I got a call from my friend Ian in Stirling at about 9.50pm. 
<br /><br />&quot;He was already laughing when I answered the phone, but after about 25 minutes of the most vigorous and uncontrollable hilarity, everything suddenly went very quiet.&quot; 
<br /><br />Moving tributes are already being placed along the Scotland-England border with many mourners opting to leave a simple bag of chips or a deep fried bunch of flowers.

<br /><br />Saturday 17th November 2007
<br /><br />Saw him in the evening and he was acting really strangely. I had been shopping in the afternoon with the girls and I did turn up a bit late so thought it might be that.
<br /><br />The bar was really crowded and loud so I suggested we go somewhere quieter to talk. He was still very subdued and distracted so I suggested we go somewhere nice to eat.
<br /><br />All through dinner he just didn't seem himself; he hardly laughed and didn't seem to be paying any attention to me or to what I was saying. I just knew that something was wrong.
<br /><br />He dropped me back home and I wondered if he was going to come in; he hesitated but followed.
<br /><br />I asked him again if there was something the matter but he just half shook his head and turned the television on.
<br /><br />After about 10 minutes of silence, I said I was going upstairs to bed.
<br /><br />I put my arms around him and told him that I loved him deeply. He just gave a sigh and a sad sort of smile. He didn't follow me up but later he did, and I was surprised when we made love. He still seemed distant and a bit cold, and I started to think that he was going to leave me and that he had found someone else.
<br /><br />I cried myself to sleep.

<br /><br />A newlywed couple had only been married for two weeks. The husband, although very much in love, couldn't wait to go out on the town and party with his old buddies .
<br /><br />So, he said to his new wife, &quot;Honey, I'll be right back.&quot; 
<br /><br />&quot;Where are you going, coochy cooh?&quot; asked the wife. 
<br /><br />&quot;I'm going to the bar, pretty face. I' m going to have a beer.&quot; 
<br /><br />The wife said, &quot;You want a beer, my love?&quot; 
<br /><br />She opened the door to the refrigerator and showed him 25 different kinds of beer brands from 12 different countries: Germany , Holland , Japan ,   India ,etc.
<br /><br />The husband didn't know what to do, and the only thing that he could think of saying was, &quot;Yes, lolly pop...but at the bar...you know...they have frozen glasses...&quot;
<br /><br />He didn't get to finish the sentence, because the wife interrupted him by saying, 
<br /><br />&quot;You want a frozen glass, puppy face?&quot; 
<br /><br />She took a huge beer mug out of the freezer, so frozen that she was getting chills just holding it. 
<br /><br />The husband, looking a bit pale, said, &quot;Yes, tootsie roll, but at the Bar they have those hors d'oeuvres that are really delicious... I won't be long, I'll be right back. I promise. OK?&quot;
<br /><br />You want hors d'oeuvres, poochi pooh?&quot; She opened the oven and took out 5 dishes of different hors d'oeuvres: chicken wings, pigs in blankets, mushroom caps, pork strips, etc.
<br /><br />&quot;But my sweet honey... At the bar... You know...there's swearing, dirty words and all that...&quot; 
<br /><br />&quot;You want dirty words, Dickhead? Drink your f***ing beer in your Goddamn frozen mug and eat your motherf***ing snacks, because you are Married  now, and you aren't f***ing going anywhere! Got it, Asshole?&quot;
<br /><br />........and, they lived happily ever after.

<br /><br />1st Woman:  I froze to death.
<br /><br />2nd Woman:  How awful!
<br /><br />1st Woman:  It wasn't so bad.  After I stopped shaking from the cold, I began to get warm and sleepy and finally died a peaceful death.  What about you?
<br /><br />2nd Woman:  I died of a massive heart attack I suspected my husband was cheating, so I came home early to catch him in the act.  But instead I found him all by himself in the house watching TV.
<br /><br />1st Woman:  So what happened?
<br /><br />2nd Woman:  I was so sure there was another woman somewhere that I started running all over the house looking.  I ran up into the attic and searched and then down into the cellar.  I went through each wardrobe and checked under all the beds. I kept this up until I had looked everywhere, and finally I became so exhausted that I just keeled over with a heart attack and died.
<br /><br />1st Woman:  Too bad you didn't look in the freezer.   We'd both still be alive.

<br /><br />'Hi, my name is Sharon and you are losing some of your load.'

<br /><br />At the third red light, the same thing happens again. All out of breath, the blonde gets out of her car, runs up, knocks on the truck door. The trucker lowers the window again she says,
<br /><br />'Hi, my name is Sharon and you are losing some of your load!'

The epicentre was Liverpool. Casualties were seen wandering aimlessly saying ‘bang out of order’, ‘mental’ and ‘that did my head in’ and “foreign bastards”. The earthquake decimated the area causing in excess of £17.55 worth of damage. Several priceless collections of mementoes from Ibiza and Benidorm were damaged beyond repair. Three preserved areas of historic burnt out cars were destroyed around the Anfield district. Many locals were woken before their Giro’s arrived, or before they got home after a night on the “RAZ”.
<br /><br />One resident, Tracey O’Conner-McCormack, a 15- year old mother of 4 said: “It was such a shock. Little Chardonnay-Leigh came running into my bedroom crying, and my hands were shaking that much I could hardly skin-up whilst I was watching Trisha”. One of the fathers of her children that she knew about said “The bizzies were running about shoutin’ CALM DOWN, CALM DOWN, it was almost impossible to rob anythin’ on me way to school”
<br /><br />The British Red Cross has so far managed to send 4000 crates of Sunny Delight to the area to help with the crisis. Rescue workers are still searching through the rubble and have found numerous ‘Elizabeth Duke’ Sovereigns, benefit books, bone china from Poundstretcher and Argos catalogues. However, they have not managed to save any furniture from MFI yet.
<br /><br />HOW CAN YOU HELP?
<br /><br />This appeal hopes to raise money for food and clothing parcels for those unfortunate to be caught up in this disaster. Clothing is most sought after. Urgently needed are Lacoste track suits (his and hers preferably), white socks, Burberry caps, woolly Benny hats and Reebok &amp; NIKI trainers. Food parcels are also needed. They include McCain’s micro chips, Aldi beans, KFC Bargain Bucket and Iceland Pizza. Alcohol is also in short supply, especially White Lightening and Carlsberg Special Brew.
<br /><br />Cash donations are also needed. 22p buys a Bic biro for signing on, £2.50 buys a jumbo sausage dinner, £3.00 buys a blag DVD, £15 buys a MOT in the post and £26.00 buys 200 Regal from Tommo who has just got back from an ASBO rehabilitation course in Corfu.

<br /><br />Teacher: &quot;Right class, who can tell me who said 'Don't ask what Your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country?'
<br /><br />Wee Jock shoots up his hand, waving furiously in the air.
<br /><br />Teacher looking round picks Jeremy at the front.
<br /><br />Teacher: &quot;Yes, Jeremy&quot;
<br /><br />Jeremy (in a very English accent): &quot;Yes miss, the answer is J F Kennedy his inauguration speech in 1960.&quot;
<br /><br />Teacher: &quot;Very good Jeremy. You may stay off Friday and Monday and we will see you back in class on Tuesday.&quot;
<br /><br />The next Thursday comes around, and Wee Jock is even more determined.
<br /><br />Teacher: &quot;Who said. 'We will fight them on the beaches, we will fight them in the air, we will fight them at sea. But we will never surrender?'&quot;
<br /><br />Wee Jock's hand shoots up, arm stiff as a board, shouting &quot;I know. I know, Me Miss, me Miss!&quot;
<br /><br />Teacher looking round and picks Timothy, sitting at the front: &quot;Yes Timothy.&quot;
<br /><br />Timothy (in a very, very posh, English accent):
<br /><br />&quot;The answer is Winston Churchill, his 1941 Battle of Britain speech.&quot;
<br /><br />Teacher: &quot;Very good Timothy, you may stay off Friday and Monday and come back to class on Tuesday.&quot;
<br /><br />The following Thursday comes around and Wee Jock is hyper, he's been studying encyclopaedias all week and he's ready for anything that comes.
<br />He's coiled in his wee plastic chair, slavers dripping in anticipation.
<br /><br />Teacher: &quot;Who said 'One small step for man, one giant leap for mankind'?&quot;
<br /><br />Wee Jock's arm shoots straight in the air, he's standing on his seat, jumping up and down screaming &quot;Miss, me miss, meeeeee!&quot;
<br /><br />Teacher looking round the class picks Rupert, sitting at the front: &quot;Yes Rupert.&quot;
<br /><br />Rupert (in a frightfully, frightfully, ever so plumy English accent): &quot;Yes miss, that was Neil Armstrong. 1969, the first moon landing.&quot;
<br /><br />Teacher: &quot;Very good Rupert. You may stay off Friday and Monday and come back into class on Tuesday&quot;
<br /><br />Wee Jock loses the plot altogether, tips his desk and throws his wee chair at the wall. He starts screaming: &quot;Fur friggs sake, where did all these English *******ds come from?&quot;
<br /><br />Teacher, looking round the class: &quot;Who said that?&quot;
<br /><br />Wee Jock grabs his coat and bag and heads for the door, &quot;Sir William Wallace, Battle of Falkirk, July 1298, See yous on fook'in Tuesday!!&quot;
