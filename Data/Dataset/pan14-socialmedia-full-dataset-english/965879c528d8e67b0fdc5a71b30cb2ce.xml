Today, take a closer look at the performance-upgraded LeBron 9, which features Kevlar-reinforced Flywire and Pro Combat-style padding in the yellow-and-carbon fiber upper.
<br /><br />Durant's lesson in poise came from Dirk Nowitzki and the Dallas Mavericks a year ago. Down 2-1 to the Mavs in last season's West finals, the Thunder looked ready to even the series after building a 15-point lead with about five minutes left in Game 4. Durant threw in a 3-pointer, then celebrated by pantomiming as if he were fastening a championship belt around his waist like Aaron Rodgers at the Super Bowl. He looked silly and immature, and the Mavericks treated him as such. Durant wouldn't make another shot the rest of the game, missing all six of his attempts and committing two costly turnovers as the Thunder wasted their lead and lost in overtime.
<br />It was an epic collapse, and the Thunder never recovered. The Mavericks closed out the series two days later.
<br />&quot;I feel like I let the city down,&quot; Durant said after the meltdown. Nike Lebron 9 PS Elite Maize for Sale.
<br /><br />&quot;Coach Brooks is in a tough situation where it's hard for him to impose his will on young, talented guys,&quot; Perkins said. &quot;At this time in their careers, it's kind of hard for them to sacrifice when they're trying to reach so many individual goals.&quot;
<br />That's why Saturday was such a watershed moment for these young Thunder. Westbrook was content to impact the game with his defense. Durant patiently set up his teammates. Cheap Nike Lebron 9 PS Elite Maize for Sale. In the biggest game of their careers, they sacrificed.
<br />For Durant, this is all part of his evolution, and that's what worries the Spurs, what worries every other team in the league. They've been in a race with the Thunder, everyone trying to chase down one more championship before Durant's game expands, before his basketball IQ matches his talent. Now they have reason to ask: Are they already too late?

Even if the thing you are supposed to talk about — say, the ending of Game 4 of the Eastern Conference finals between the Boston Celtics and the Miami Heat — hasn't actually happened yet. And especially when you are live. When all of those elements come together, and you are somewhat uncomfortable improvising in the moment, the opportunity exists for a pretty regrettable situation. Nike LeBron 9 Galaxy Big Bang for Cheap.
<br />With that, we take you to the Sunday night news broadcast of Portland, Maine, ABC affiliate WMTW, anchored by News 8's own Meghan Torjussen.
<br />&quot;The Boston Celtics, hosting the Miami Heat in Boston for Game 4 of the Eastern Conference finals,&quot; Torjussen said. &quot;I guess the game just ended ... it ended in a tie. This is what my producer is telling me right now.&quot;
<br />At that point, a full-screen graphic reading &quot;Miami 89, Boston 89&quot; appeared on the screen.
<br /><br />Yes, I'd imagine moving on to professional baseball — or literally anything else — would be a pretty appealing option for Ms. Torjussen at that point. Because the longer you linger, the more likely folks are to remember that, um, NBA games can't end in a tie. Nike LeBron 9 Galaxy Big Bang for Sale. They have to keep going until one team has more points than another when time's up.
<br />That's why, when the fourth quarter finished with the two teams knotted at 89, the refs made them play another five minutes — five pretty bad minutes that featured only six total points, thanks in part to being played largely without Paul Pierce and LeBron James after they fouled out early in overtime, but, still, five more minutes. And when that five minutes ended with Dwyane Wade clanging a 3-pointer and the scoreboard reading Boston 93, Miami 91, that's when it was OK for the game to end.

They lost out on the top pick in the draft despite having the best odds in the lottery, tried to pass off that result as a success, and held one of most depressing &quot;parties&quot; imaginable. With the common perception that Michael Jordan isn't exactly the best executive around, confidence in Charlotte is at an all-time low. Buy Nike LeBron 9 PS Elite South Beach.
<br />However, the Bobcats would like you to know that Jordan isn't as bad as you think. According to Bobcats exec Rod Higgins during an interview with WFNZ in Charlotte, Jordan wasn't responsible for drafting Adam Morrison.
<br /><br />It is entirely possible that Higgins is telling the truth. Jordan officially bought a minority interest in the franchise and took control of basketball operations on June 15, 2006.

Perhaps Bickerstaff is responsible for that decision.

<br /><br />The problem with that line of thinking is that Jordan's ownership situation didn't take place overnight, to the point where it's very difficult to imagine him not being involved in any of the draft preparations. He had to have signed off on the Morrison pick, at the very least, and if he doesn't take responsibility for it then he's not being a very good leader. Nike LeBron 9 PS Elite South Beach for sale. Even if he was only in charge for 13 days, he was in charge of that pick.
<br />Jordan won't control the Bobcats' selection in this draft — that's up to their very well-regarded general manager Rich Cho. But the lack of responsibility here — Higgins set it, but he's effectively MJ's proxy — doesn't point to a stellar management style. Morrison was a bad pick, but he's also been off the team for several years. The only reason Jordan wouldn't own up to his involvement is vanity.
