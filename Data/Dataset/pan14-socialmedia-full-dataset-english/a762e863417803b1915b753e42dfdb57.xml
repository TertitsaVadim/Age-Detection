<br />But you weren't honest
<br />Now get in the ground
<br />You choked off the surest of favors
<br />But if you really loved me
<br />You would've endured my world
<br /><br />Well you're just as I presumed
<br />A whore in sheep's clothing
<br />Fucking up all I do
<br />And if it's here we stop
<br />Then never again
<br />Will you see this in your life?
<br /><br />You stormed off to scar the armada
<br />Like Jesus played letter,
<br />I'll drill through your hands
<br />The stone for the curse you have blamed me
<br />With love and devotion, you'll die as you sleep
<br />But if you could just write me out
<br />To neverless wonder... happy will I become
<br />Be true that this is no option,
<br />So with sin I condemn you
<br /><br />One last kiss for you
<br />One more wish to you
<br />Please make up your mind...
<br />I'd do anything for you

<br />I can move on with you around

<br />We both know the day will come, but I don't want to leave you
<br /><br />So what if I never hold you, yeah, or kiss your lips again? 
<br />So I never want to leave you and the memories of us to see
<br />I beg don't leave me
<br /><br />Seize the day or die regretting the time you lost
<br />It's empty and cold without you here, too many people to ache over
<br />Trials in life, questions of us existing here
<br />Don't wanna die alone without you here
<br />Please tell me what we have is real
<br /><br />I stand here alone
<br />Falling away from you, no chance to get back home
<br /><br />I see my vision burn, I feel my memories fade with time
<br />But I'm too young to worry

<br />Look to the time when Ill live
<br /><br />Fed through the tube that sticks in me

<br />Taken my speech
<br />Taken my hearing
<br />Taken my arms
<br />Taken my legs
<br />Taken my soul
<br />Left me with life in hell

<br />You moved in last Friday night,
<br />and I just couldn't wait
<br />So I tried to call across the hall,
<br />to ask you out someday
<br />But a lineup formed outside your door, and I was way too late
<br /><br />Well I hear your favorite songs
<br />you sing along with everyday
<br />And I borrow things that
<br />I don't need for conversation sake
<br />Last night I heard your key,
<br />it hit your lock at 4 AM
<br />Instead of being out with me
<br />you must be out with them
<br /><br />Well somewhere the one
<br />I wanna be with's
<br />with somebody else
<br />Oh god I, wanna be that
<br />someone that you're with
<br /><br />And I can talk about it all day long
<br />'til I run out of breath
<br />But I still wanna be that
<br />someone that you're with
<br /><br />And I'm pacing by the phone
<br />'Cause I hate to be alone
<br />And if you're out there with him
<br />somewhere, just about to kiss
<br />Then God I've, got to be that
<br />someone that
<br /><br />I wanna be that someone that
<br />I've got to be that
<br />someone that you're with
<br /><br />Well I'd rather start off slow
<br />This whole thing's like

<br />I got caught up

<br />I'd pretend
<br />Not to hear what they said to me
<br />'Cause I got off
<br />Every time you got on to me
<br />Was it wrong
<br />To go along with insanity?
<br /><br />I guess it wasn't really right
<br />I guess it wasn't meant to be
<br />It didn't matter what they said
<br />'Cause we were good in bed
<br />I guess I stuck around so I could watch us fight
<br />for all the wrong reasons
<br />No, it didn't matter what I tried
<br />It's just a little hard to leave
<br />When you're going down on me
<br />I guess I stuck around so I could watch us fight
<br />for all the wrong reasons

<br />Love lingered on to frustration.
<br />And if our love is so wrong, what should we do alone?
<br />Or am I just a picture in a photograph?
<br />Why are we stuck in this pantomime fearing a god who died?
<br />One who would not deny lovers?

<br />Then take a look at my face and know
<br /><br />Still in the life of the wrong we all moved along
<br />Another life evolved to gestation

<br /><br />That till your rapture falls to pieces
<br />Until your rapture falls to pieces
