If women love gold for the jewellery it can be used to make, business people love it for its value. Let’s take a trip down history to find out how gold coins changed from a trading currency to an investment commodity. <br /><br />•During 643 to 630 B.C Lydians produced the first coins made from electrum, which is a crude combination of silver and gold.<br />•By 560 BC, the Lydians and Ionians had learnt the technique of separating gold and silver. King Croesus issued separate coins made from gold and silver during this time.<br />•Later, Celtic tribes in Britain made gold coins with the inscription “CUNO,” which stands for Cunobelin, the chieftain of the Catuvellauni tribe. It is probably the first known <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jYXJhdGxhbmUuY29tL2dvbGQtY29pbnM_" target="_blank">Gold coins</a>  with inscription. <br />•When the Celtics were defeated by the Romans and absorbed into their culture, the art of making coins was passed over to them. Early Romans used bronze, silver and copper coins for trade. After the death of Julius Caesar, gold coins began to be minted.  <br />•In 1489, King Henry VII released the first gold sovereign coin. A pound sterling coin made from 95.83 percent 23kt gold was released later. As years passed, gold was replaced by lighter and affordable metals to make coins, which were then slowly taken over by currency notes. <br />•Usage of gold coins in India was in 100 AD and the credit goes to Kushan emperor Vima Kadaphises. He introduced gold dinar with the engraving of lord Shiva, so history of gold coins in India dates back to 2000 years. Later on many denominations of gold coins including dinars, Bhairava Gadyanas, Xerafims, Pagodas, Tankas, Ashrafis, Mohurs, Gadyanas, Varahas, Fanams, Koris, Kahavanus and Tolas were used.<br />•With changes in the economic climate in the modern times, gold coin rates started rising, thus enhancing its value as a stable investment. Gold stores started increasing as people began buying gold jewellery as a means of saving and investing money.<br />•The development of internet brought a tremendous change in the gold market. You can now buy gold coins online at highly competitive prices from the comfort of your home. Apart from comfort there are other advantages of buying coins in online. The most important benefit is that online prices of gold coins are very low compared to any physical jewelry store, because online stores don’t have any operational costs. So, they offer coins at low prices without sacrificing their profits.<br /><br />However, before buying them in online, one should be very careful as there is a chance for fraud. So make sure that the website from which you want to buy is a genuine one. From crude electrum to pure gold, these coins have come a long way. But their value has only kept rising through the years.
