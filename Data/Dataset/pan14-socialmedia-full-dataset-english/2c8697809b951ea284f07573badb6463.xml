Unlike other bowel disorders, Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) cannot be diagnosed by checking for physical abnormalities in the abdomen. It is therefore often diagnosed by the symptoms it produce (many of which can be treated with acupuncture) such as: Abdominal cramping, Diarrhea and/or constipation, Frequent urges to go to the bathroom, Feeling of incomplete evacuation after a bowel movement. <br /><br />Damage of qi (energy of life) causes pain and damage of blood causes swelling, so, clinically, TCM thinks highly of treatment through smoothing main and collateral channels and regulating qi and blood. The apparatus has a high curative ratio. <br /><br />Limping can result from either an acute (having a recent onset) or chronic (long-term) condition. Injuries such as bone fractures, sprains, and strains are common causes of limping. Arthritis and congenital malformations (birth defects) are other potential causes. <br /><br />This is an easy to use, compact and portable device that electronically stimulates key acupuncture points that are effective in weight loss. These points stimulate the auricular branch of the vagal nerve and raise serotonin levels, both of which have been shown to increase tone in the smooth muscle of the stomach thus suppressing appetite. The treatment protocol involves two 20 minute sessions daily. <br /><br />Treatments for unsteady gait depend on the underlying cause. When an unsteady gait is related to a sprain, strain, or minor injury, analgesic and anti-inflammatory medications may be effective for relief. More severe injuries and conditions require specific therapies that are directed at the underlying cause of the problem. <br /><br />More accurate localization of auricular acupoints is achieved by first detecting a point with an electrodermal measurement device. Moreover, increased electrical skin conductance at an ear reflex point is one of the primary indicators that there is pathology in the corresponding part of the body. Greater electrical conductance at body acupoints is found whether or not there is pathology in any underlying condition. <br /><br />Acupuncture has long been utilized as a general pain reduction method for thousands of years, originating in the Far East and gradually being utilized throughout the world.

There are as many as 200 acupuncture points on the outer ear, each point named generally after areas of our anatomy - liver, heart, mouth and so on. The outer ear acts like a switchboard to the brain and each point triggers electrical impulses, from the ear, via the brain, to the area of the body being treated. <br /><br />Auriculotherapy involves the stimulation of specific acupuncture points of the external ear for diagnosis and treatment of health conditions. Ear Acupuncture from Seattle Health TherapiesStimulation of ear acu-points is accomplished by inserting several tiny needles into the ear points which are retained anywhere from 10 to 30 minutes. Occasionally several points may be stimulated with electro-acupuncture. Lasers, magnets, and electronic devices are also frequently used methods of stimulation. Taped products such as acubeads or seeds are often retained for long term use. <br /><br />These days, people are looking for healthier and more natural treatments for these conditions.

Put like that, losing weight naturally should be simple but, for better or worse, we are genetically programmed to eat more than we need to ensure we will have sufficient body fat to see us through those times when food is scarce. This may not occur so much these days, but the eating when food is available is something that has been handed down the generations from those far-off times when our ancestors had to go out and find food – and still survive when food was in short supply. <br /><br />Visit the site &lt;a href='<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.lekomat.org"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.lekomat.org</a>' target='_blank'&gt;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Flekomat.org"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://lekomat.org</a>[/url], it lets you expirience pain and disease relief in the comfort of your own home.

It uses the same meridians and acupoints as acupuncture but affects them in a different way. <br /><br />An enlarged heart is medically known as cardiomegaly. Cardiomegaly can be caused by a number of different conditions, including diseases of the heart muscle or heart valves, high blood pressure, arrhythmias, and pulmonary hypertension.

Each organ is associated with many aspects of nature. For example, the heart is of the yang element fire and associates with joy, hot climates, bitter taste, and red hue. The lungs are yin organs associated with metal, worry, pungent taste, and white hue. Interactions between the elements of each organ give rise to health or disease. <br /><br />Visit the site &lt;a href='<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.lekomat.org"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.lekomat.org</a>' target='_blank'&gt;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Flekomat.org"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://lekomat.org</a>[/url], it lets you expirience pain and disease relief in the comfort of your own home.

Congenital deafness similarly may or may not be genetic. For example, it may be associated with a white forelock and be caused by a genetic disease called Waardenburg syndrome.

Typically, the pain is a result of tissue inflammation that is caused by injury or disease. Either injury or chronic disease can cause inflammation to any of the tissues of the leg and lead to leg pain. <br /><br />Swelling of the eye refers to the presence of excess fluid (edema) in the connective tissues around the eye, most commonly the eyelids.
