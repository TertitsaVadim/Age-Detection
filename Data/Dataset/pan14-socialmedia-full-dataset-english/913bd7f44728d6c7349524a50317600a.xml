If your URL shows up far down the results list, the chances of the consumer never finding you increase incrementally. Once you achieve a high search engine position, it is essential that you make sure you maintain the high ranking you have worked so hard to achieve.
<br /><br />This means you must come up with a strategy to monitor your search engines positions. This strategy is crucial to the success of any marketing campaign. Think of your search engine positions as your online portfolio. Would you let your stock portfolio be ruled by chance and market fluctuations, or would you keep close tabs on your stocks so you could buy and sell when the time is right? This is the way you must consider your search engines positions.
<br /><br />Be aware that at first, after you have launched your search engine campaign and done all the right things to increase your rankings, you will most likely see a continual upward climb. What you need to be on the lookout for is the moment that upward climb reaches a plateau. When this happens, your search engine position campaign moves into stage two, the monitoring and protecting stage.
<br /><br />In stage two, do not be concerned about the short-term fluctuations in your positions. These are similar to the subtle rising and falling of stocks in a portfolio. Short-term movement is an integral part of the whole process. It's the long-term changes that you must watch for and prepare to act on immediately.
<br /><br />Analyzing the long-term trends of search engines positions is imperative. The way in which search engines rank websites may change at the drop of hat. If you are unaware of these changes—many of which are subtle yet can be deadly to your ranking—your position may drop to the bottom of the list before you can get your bearings. To prevent this kind of precipitous drop, you must create a system to monitor your positions on a monthly basis. Devise a chart to keep tabs on your top ranking positions or your top pages, and make sure to watch &quot;the market&quot; closely.
<br /><br />Each search engine uses a formula to compute website rankings. When a search engine changes this formula in any way, it may raise or lower your ranking. Some search engines use a number of different formulas, rotating them so that a formula doesn't become overused or outdated. Depending on which formula is being applied, your search engine position may suddenly drop or rise in rank significantly. Therefore, you must check your positions frequently in order to catch when a search engine changes formulas and what effect it has on your positions.
<br /><br />You must also deal with your competition—a crucial factor you must always be vigilant about. Your competitor's position may suddenly rise, automatically lowering your position. Or their position may drop, pushing your position higher. Each month, expect position changes due to the continual changes that are occurring in your competitor's position, and be prepared to adjust your marketing strategy to compensate for decreased rankings. Monitoring these fluctuations will also give you vital information about how to improve your website to increase your position in search results.
<br /><br />Of course, you must discern what the most popular search engines are in order for your monitoring efforts to be effective. Right now, there are ten popular search engines that direct most of Internet traffic to your sites. The challenge you face is that these top ten may change from month to month.
<br /><br />This means that your must not only monitor your search engine positions, but you must also keep track of the ranking popularity of the search engines you are monitoring. Find out which search engines people use most frequently every month and be sure to live in the present! People are fickle about their favorite search engines, and it takes constant vigilance to follow their dalliances. The search engines they loved when you first launched your campaign may be old news in the next few months. You must adjust your list of engines according to the whims of the Internet users. Check out <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.searchenginewatch.com%2Freports%2Fnetratings.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.searchenginewatch.com/reports/netratings.html</a> for a current list of website favorites.
<br /><br />Another factor to monitor carefully is a sudden drop of your positions in all search engines. This is not the same as monthly fluctuations—this is a neon red warning sign! It could mean a number of different things.
<br /><br />It all your search engine positions have plummeted, it may indicate that search engines spiders—those sneaky programs that seek out your site and rank their positions—have found some type of problem with your website. If you have recently changed the code, for instance, the spider may become utterly confused and consequently drop your positions disastrously. If a spider creeps up on your website when it is down for adjustments or changes, you may actually disappear from a search engine index entirely. Or a search engine may drastically change its formula, and suddenly all of your websites come up as irrelevant. If that search engine is a current favorite, it may create a domino effect, causing all of your position to drop in all search engines.
<br /><br />Some search engines rely on the results from other search engines, and it is vital that you know which engines these are and keep track of all the engines they influence. The biggest problem here is that search engines will sometimes change affiliations, and this can create a major shift in the geography of the Internet. For example, recently Yahoo decided to display only results gleaned from Google. So you must not only monitor your own positions, but you must keep abreast of seismic shifts in the landscape of the Internet as a whole.
<br /><br />Finally, pay attention to your keywords. Keywords are the foundation bricks of the entire search engine system, and they demand individual scrutiny in your monitoring efforts. If you have found that a number of your positions have plummeted, it may mean that a page of your website has become invisible or inaccessible to search engine spiders. Or the competition for that particular keyword or phrase has recently rocketed into outer space. In either case, you must act quickly and efficiently to regain lost ground.
<br /><br />Your search engine marketing campaign is an investment. If costs you time and money on a continual basis. Protect this investment as diligently as you would your financial portfolio. In the same way, track your positions from an objective perspective, and monitor your positions on a regular basis. Make sure your time and effort reap rewards by keeping your eye on the big picture—your long-term marketing campaign.

Search engines are the first stop for most people trying to find information, services, and products online. Because of this, it is essential that your website appears quickly in search results.
<br /><br />The Internet contains numerous search engines, some of which offer what is known as &quot;paid inclusion&quot;. This means that you pay the specific search engine an annual fee for your web page to be included in their index.
<br /><br />Of course, every search engine already has an automated program commonly called a &quot;spider&quot; that indexes all the web pages it locates online, and it does this for free. So whether you pay or not, your web page will eventually be indexed by all Internet search engines, as long as the spider can follow a link to your page. The major issue is, then, how quickly your page is indexed.
<br /><br />A search engine that offers a paid URL inclusion uses an extra spider that is programmed to index the particular pages that have been paid for. The difference between the spider that indexes pages for free and the spider that indexes only pages for a fee is speed. If you have paid for inclusion, the additional search engine spider will index your page immediately.
<br /><br />The debate over paid URL inclusion centers around the annual fee. Since the regular spider of these search engines would eventually get around to indexing your web page anyway, why is a renewal fee necessary? The fee is necessary to keep your pages in the search engine's index. If you go the route of paid inclusion, you should be aware that at the end of the pay period, on some search engines, your page will be removed from their index for a certain amount of time.
<br /><br />It's easy to get confused about whether you would benefit from paid inclusion since the spider of any search engine will eventually index your page without the additional cost. There are both advantages and disadvantages to paid URL inclusion, and it is only by weighing your pros and cons that you will be able to decide whether to spring for the extra cash or not.
<br /><br />The advantages are obvious: rapid inclusion and rapid re-indexing. Paid inclusion means that your pages will be indexed quickly and added to search results in a very short time after you have paid the fee. The time difference between when the regular spider will index your pages and when the paid spider will is a matter of months. The spider for paid inclusion usually indexes your pages in a day or two. Be aware that if you have no incoming links to your pages, the regular spider will never locate them at all.
<br /><br />Additionally, paid inclusion spiders will go back to your pages often, sometimes even daily. The advantage of this is that you can update your pages constantly to improve the ranking in which they appear in search engines, and the paid URL inclusion spider will show that result in a matter of days.
<br /><br />First and foremost, the disadvantage is the cost. For a ten-page website, the costs of paid URL inclusion range from $170 for Fast/Lycos to $600 for AltaVista, and you have to pay each engine their annual fee. How relevant the cost factor is will depend on your company.
<br /><br />Another, and perhaps more important, disadvantage is the limited reach of paid URL inclusions. The largest search engines, Google, Yahoo, and AOL, do not offer paid URL inclusion. That means that the search engines you choose to pay an inclusion fee will amount to a small fraction of the traffic to your site on a daily basis.
<br /><br />Google usually updates its index every month, and there is no way you can speed up this process. You will have to wait for the Google spider to index your new pages no matter how many other search engines you have paid to update their index daily. Be aware that it is only after Google updates their index that your pages will show up in Google, Yahoo, or AOL results.
<br /><br />One way to figure out whether paid URL inclusion is a good deal for your company is to consider some common factors. First, find out if search engines have already indexed your pages. To do this, you may have to enter a number of different keywords, but the quickest way to find out is to enter your URL address in quotes. If your pages appear when you enter the URL address but do not appear when you enter keywords, using paid inclusion will not be beneficial. This is because your pages have already been indexed and ranked by the regular spider. If this is the case, your money would be better spent by updating your pages to improve your ranking in search results. Once you accomplish this, you can then consider using paid inclusion if you want to speed up the time it will take for the regular spider to revisit your pages.
<br /><br />The most important factor in deciding whether to use paid URL inclusion is to decide if it's a good investment. To figure this out, you have to look at the overall picture: what kind of product or service are you selling and how much traffic are you dependent on to see a profit?
<br /><br />If your company sells an inexpensive product that requires a large volume of traffic to your site, paid inclusion may not be the best investment for you; the biggest search engines do not offer it, and they are the engines that will bring you the majority of hits. On the other hand, if you have a business that offers an expensive service or product and requires a certain quality of traffic to your site, a paid URL inclusion is most likely an excellent investment.
<br /><br />Another factor is whether or not your pages are updated frequently. If the content changes on a daily or weekly basis, paid inclusion will insure that your new pages are indexed often and quickly. The new content is indexed by the paid spider and then appears when new relevant keywords are entered in the search engines. Using paid inclusion in this case will guarantee that your pages are being indexed in a timely manner.
<br /><br />You should also base your decision on whether or not your pages are dynamically generated. These types of pages are often difficult for regular spiders to locate and index. Paying to include the most important pages of a dynamically generated website will insure that the paid spider will index them.
<br /><br />Sometimes a regular spider will drop pages from its search engine, although these pages usually reappear in a few months. There are a number of reasons why this can happen, but by using paid URL inclusion, you will avoid the possibility. Paid URL inclusion guarantees that your pages are indexed, and if they are inadvertently dropped, the search engine will be on the lookout to locate them immediately.
<br /><br />As you can see, there are numerous factors to consider when it comes to paid URL inclusion. It can be a valuable investment depending on your situation. Evaluate your business needs and your website to determine if paid URL inclusion is a wise investment for your business goals.

There are several ways to go about attracting traffic to your website; Pay-Per-Click is one of the options you can choose from, along with developing an SEO, or search engine optimization campaign. Both pay-per-click and SEO are targeted to get your website placed as close to the top of search engine results as possible. One of the differences is that it takes minutes to set up a pay-per-click campaign versus months for a good SEO campaign.
<br /><br />Pay-Per-Click is a simple type of paid advertising that most search engines, including some of the largest ones, now offer. It requires a bid for a &quot;per-click&quot; basis, which translates to your company paying the bid amount every time the search engine directs a visitor to your site. There is the added bonus that when a per-click site sends your website traffic, your site often appears in the results of other prevalent search engines.
<br /><br />As with all marketing campaigns, there are advantages and disadvantages. If you understand the process and monitor your pay-per-click campaign frequently, it can be very effective. One of the greatest advantages is that you never have to tweak your web pages to change your position in search engine results, as you must do in a typical SEO campaign. What you do have to do in a pay-per-click campaign is pay a fee.
<br /><br />Another advantage is the simplicity of the pay-per-click process. You just bid and you're up and running. It doesn't demand any specific technical knowledge, though the more you know about search engines and keywords, the easier—and more effective—the process will be.
<br /><br />The downside is that pay-per-click is essentially a bidding war. A higher bid than yours will lower your position on search engine results. This means that you will have to raise your bid to regain your position—which can obviously become quite expensive, especially if you are bidding on a popular keyword.
<br /><br />In order to determine if pay-per-click is a cost-effective form of marketing for your business, you must do some computing to figure out how much each visitor to your site is worth. You can compute this value by dividing the profit you make on your website over a given period of time by the total number of visitors for that same time period. For example, if your site made $5,000 in profits and there were 25,000 hits, each visitor would be theoretically worth 50 cents. The basic formula is profits divided by visitors.
<br /><br />The figure of 50 cents per visitor is the point at which your business breaks even. The idea, of course, is to show a profit, not to merely cover your costs. Therefore, you are aiming at a figure less than 50 cents per click.
<br /><br />Be aware that the most popular keywords often cost considerably more than 50 cents a click. The only way around this is to bid less for these phrases or you will be paying too much for each individual hit.
<br /><br />The key (pun intended) to success is to learn everything you can about search engine keyword research. The good news is there isn't a limit to the amount of keywords you can add to your bid because additional keywords do not add additional cost. This translates into a lot less hassle for you because there is no need to optimize your site to index a particular set of keywords.
<br /><br />Obviously, some keywords are much more effective than others are, but they will not cost you anything except time to set-up your account in your pay-per-click bid. Of the popular search engines that offer pay-per-click, one called Overture provides an online tool that will give you the data on how often particular keywords are entered into their search engine. They also offer suggestions for keywords after you enter a description of your site.
<br /><br />In pay-per-click, this written description is crucial. You must understand that the object of your description is not to generally attract visitors, but to be as specific as possible so that only those visitors who are likely to buy your service or product go to your site. You must use expert marketing copy to guarantee that your description is both precise and enticing to attract the most ideal candidates to your site. This description is your most powerful tool to insure that your bid is profitable.
<br /><br />Another essential element of pay-per-click advertising is that you constantly monitor your bid. It is very important that you bear in mind that the results of the top search engines providing pay-per-click advertising, which are Overture and AdWords Select, usually appear on other popular search engines. Because of this, the competition for top ranking is intense, and very often you will find that the bidding price balloons too high for pay-per-click to yield a profit.
<br /><br />If this happens, it is advisable to withdraw your bid on that particular keyword and try another one. Remember: when you pay too much per click to make a profit, you are in essence losing the bidding war.
<br /><br />Since losing is not acceptable, you must have a plan in place to closely track the effectiveness of your keyword. It is advisable to monitor your keywords on at least a monthly basis.
<br /><br />Not only is careful monitoring important, but the analysis of visitor behavior can produce invaluable knowledge about consumer motivation, habits, and trends. Expert monitoring and consumer analysis is essential to your overall business needs, and will also insure that your pay-per-click campaign is a success.

Unfortunately, the Internet is populated by bands of dishonest webmasters seeking to improve their link popularity by faking out search engines.
<br /><br />The good news is that search engines have figured this out, and are now on guard for &quot;spam&quot; pages and sites that have increased their rankings by artificial methods. When a search engines tracks down such a site, that site is demoted in ranking or completely removed from the search engine's index.
<br /><br />The bad news is that some high quality, completely above-board sites are being mistaken for these web page criminals. Your page may be in danger of being caught up in the &quot;spam&quot; net and tossed from a search engine's index, even though you have done nothing to deserve such harsh treatment. But there are things you can do—and things you should be sure NOT to do—which will prevent this kind of misperception.
<br /><br />Link popularity is mostly based on the quality of sites you are linked to. Google pioneered this criteria for assigning website ranking, and virtually all search engines on the Internet now use it. There are legitimate ways to go about increasing your link popularity, but at the same time, you must be scrupulously careful about which sites you choose to link to. Google frequently imposes penalties on sites that have linked to other sites solely for the purpose of artificially boosting their link popularity. They have actually labeled these links &quot;bad neighborhoods&quot;.
<br /><br />You can raise a toast to the fact that you cannot be penalized when a bad neighborhood links to your site; penalty happens only when you are the one sending out the link to a bad neighborhood. But you must check and double-check all the links that are active on your links page to make sure you haven't linked to a bad neighborhood.
<br /><br />The first thing to check out is whether or not the pages you have linked to have been penalized. The most direct way to do this is to download the Google toolbar. You will then see that most pages are given a &quot;PageRank&quot; which is represented by a sliding green scale on the Google toolbar.
<br /><br />Do not link to any site that shows no green at all on the scale. This is especially important when the scale is completely gray. It is more than likely that these pages have been penalized. If you are linked to these pages, you may catch their penalty, and like the flu, it may be difficult to recover from the infection.
<br /><br />There is no need to be afraid of linking to sites whose scale shows only a tiny sliver of green on their scale. These sites have not been penalized, and their links may grow in value and popularity. However, do make sure that you closely monitor these kind of links to ascertain that at some point they do not sustain a penalty once you have linked up to them from your links page.
<br /><br />Another evil trick that illicit webmasters use to artificially boost their link popularity is the use of hidden text. Search engines usually use the words on web pages as a factor in forming their rankings, which means that if the text on your page contains your keywords, you have more of an opportunity to increase your search engine ranking than a page that does not contain text inclusive of keywords.
<br /><br />Some webmasters have gotten around this formula by hiding their keywords in such a way so that they are invisible to any visitors to their site. For example, they have used the keywords but made them the same color as the background color of the page, such as a plethora of white keywords on a white background. You cannot see these words with the human eye—but the eye of search engine spider can spot them easily! A spider is the program search engines use to index web pages, and when it sees these invisible words, it goes back and boosts that page's link ranking.
<br /><br />Webmasters may be brilliant and sometimes devious, but search engines have figured these tricks out. As soon as a search engine perceive the use of hidden text—splat! The page is penalized.
<br /><br />The downside of this is that sometimes the spider is a bit overzealous and will penalize a page by mistake. For example, if the background color of your page is gray, and you have placed gray text inside a black box, the spider will only take note of the gray text and assume you are employing hidden text. To avoid any risk of false penalty, simply direct your webmaster not to assign the same color to text as the background color of the page ever!
<br /><br />Another potential problem that can result in a penalty is called &quot;keyword stuffing&quot;. It is important to have your keywords appear in the text on your page, but sometimes you can go a little overboard in your enthusiasm to please those spiders. A search engine uses what is called &quot;Keyword Density&quot; to determine if a site is trying to artificially boost their ranking. This is the ratio of keywords to the rest of the words on the page. Search engines assign a limit to the number of times you can use a keyword before it decides you have overdone it and penalizes your site.
<br /><br />This ratio is quite high, so it is difficult to surpass without sounding as if you are stuttering—unless your keyword is part of your company name. If this is the case, it is easy for keyword density to soar. So, if your keyword is &quot;renters insurance&quot;, be sure you don't use this phrase in every sentence. Carefully edit the text on your site so that the copy flows naturally and the keyword is not repeated incessantly. A good rule of thumb is your keyword should never appear in more than half the sentences on the page.
<br /><br />The final potential risk factor is known as &quot;cloaking&quot;. To those of you who are diligent Trekkies, this concept should be easy to understand. For the rest of you, cloaking is when the server directs a visitor to one page and a search engine spider to a different page. The page the spider sees is &quot;cloaked&quot; because it is invisible to regular traffic, and deliberately set-up to raise the site's search engine ranking. A cloaked page tries to feed the spider everything it needs to rocket that page's ranking to the top of the list.
<br /><br />It is natural that search engines have responded to this act of deception with extreme enmity, imposing steep penalties on these sites. The problem on your end is that sometimes pages are cloaked for legitimate reasons, such as prevention against the theft of code, often referred to as &quot;pagejacking&quot;. This kind of shielding is unnecessary these days due to the use of off-page elements, such as link popularity, that cannot be stolen.
<br /><br />To be on the safe side, be sure that your webmaster is aware that absolutely no cloaking is acceptable. Make sure the webmaster understands that cloaking of any kind will put your website at great risk.
<br /><br />Just as you must be diligent in increasing your link popularity and your ranking, you must be equally diligent to avoid being unfairly penalized. So be sure to monitor your site closely and avoid any appearance of artificially boosting your rankings.

So: '+internet +marketing +strategies' will get you results containing all those words, leaving out web pages that only contain 'internet'.
<br /><br />2. Use the subtraction (-) sign to exclude references that you are not interested in. For example, if you are not interested in web pages that talk about viral marketing, enter: 'internet marketing strategies -viral'.
<br /><br />3. Sometimes, your search terms may be far off from one another on a web page. To ensure your terms appear together in a phrase, put them in double quotations, like this: &quot;internet marketing strategies&quot;. This is also useful when you want to look for specific topics, such as &quot;how to remove spyware&quot;, rather than having the terms scattered all over.
<br /><br />4. If you are looking for a word definition, Google has a tool for you. Just type: 'define: widget' to get a definition of the word from online dictionaries and glossaries.
<br /><br />5. Google even performs calculations. For example, enter '1+2+3' and click 'search' to get the result. It can also perform unit conversions such as from miles to kilometers. Enter '10 miles to kilometers' and you'll get 16.09344 kilometers.

		<document id="bb904edc98eeec3851b95059d45f780a" url=""><![CDATA[How To Rewrite One Good Article Under One Hour<br/><br/>Article marketing is a very good way to accumulate backlinks that point back to your site and generate visitors. Unfortunately, search engine companies like Google have clammed down hard on duplicate content so your works must appear somewhat 'original' or unique to be acceptable in article directories. In this article you'll discover quick tips to rewriting one good article under 1 hour and you'll have no worries about other writers accusing you of plagiarism.
<br /><br />First of all, there must be an appropriate mindset that comes before the skill. If I may attribute a quote by Stephen King correctly, he said, &quot;The more you read, the more you write.&quot; It simply means anyone is capable of mentally storing accumulated knowledge for as long as s/he keeps reading, and with this pool of knowledge arise a desire to express oneself based on what s/he knows. This is the fundamental first step to establishing expertise. No one can lie about what s/he doesn't know and shouldn't downplay what they truly know if they can be in a position to help others and get paid for it.
<br /><br />Second, the structure and length of the article must be determined before writing commences. I recommend a length of 410 words to beat the minimum limit for acceptable article submission. A classic set of criteria for structuring would be:
<br /><br />1. Describe a problem, challenge or scenario that needs to be fixed.
<br /><br />2. Describe the consequences if the problem remains ignored.
<br /><br />3. List down possible solutions to help fix the problem. Put them in point form.
<br /><br />4. Highlight the benefits of applying the solutions.
<br /><br />5. Present in a case study, a real or theoretical positive outcome when the solutions are applied.
<br /><br />6. Summarize the key theme of the article and re-emphasize the need to solve the problem. End it with a &quot;call to action&quot;.
<br /><br />A 410-word article is really short and you'll surely find yourself surpassing this limit when you practice writing often enough.
<br /><br />Another thing to bear in mind is the use of synonyms. As you research for your content, be alert for words which you can replace with another of the same meaning. This will help you beat duplication.
<br /><br />The most wonderful thing about rewriting content is that although your words have to be unique, the ideas behind them are not. You can research a wide range of PLR articles or other people's articles and cut them up, add to them, combine them with other content, or go one step further and create an e-book or audio/video product only because you don't feel 'right' with how they write...the sky really is the limit! Include your own personal opinions and experiences about the topic or explain in greater detail the theories or concepts that are only mentioned briefly in other articles. Coming up with a list of solutions in point form is as easy as deriving one tip you can summarize in a single statement from each and every article you research. The more things you can think of, the more unique your resulting product will be.
<br /><br />Rewriting articles is not difficult at all. It's not like I'm asking you to &quot;start from scratch&quot;.

They specialize in knowing how to raise your search engine positions, monitoring those positions on the regular basis, and adjusting their strategies to account for undesirable results in any given month. Since this takes a lot of time, effort, and specialized knowledge, it can be in your best interest to go to an outside source rather than try to maintain high search engine positions on your own.
<br /><br />However, like every business, there are good companies and there are lemons. Knowing the right questions to ask and the criteria to look for will help you in choosing an affordable, effective search engine optimization company.
<br /><br />When looking at different companies, begin by considering the approach they employ to raise your search engine positions. Steer clear of companies that use cloaked, doorway, or bridge pages to raise your positions. These techniques violate most search engine policy, and in the worst case scenario, will only get your website severely penalized, if not removed entirely from a search engine's index.
<br /><br />A cloaked page is a page that is created which is invisible to the regular visitor to your website. The cloaked page is coded to detect a search engine spider and divert them to this special page, which is set-up to artificially boost your search engine position. Doorway or bridge pages utilize the same concept, but often reside on an entirely different server. Google, one of the largest and most important search engine on the Internet, will remove your website from their index if they detect you have cloaked pages. Never, never employ any company that uses this technique!
<br /><br />Another important element is to get a guarantee that the company you hire will not work with your competitors while they are working for you. Obviously, this would seriously compromise the effectiveness of the search engine optimization campaign. Be aware that some companies will use the success they achieve for your website to sell their services to your competitors. So get your guarantee in writing, and make sure it is legally binding.
<br /><br />Of course, one of the most important factors you want to check out is the company's track record of results. However, don't take the company's word for it. They will undoubtedly be slanting their results in order to sell their services to you. To go beyond their simple statement of success, ask them a few pertinent questions, and verify their answers.
<br /><br />Ask them which engines they have achieved the best results on. The ones that are important are the most popular engines, and these are the ones you want to see good results on. Since the popularity of search engines can change with the landscape of the overall Internet, check out the Nielsen NetRatings page at Search Engine Watch.
<br /><br />Next, find out what keywords and phrases they are claiming great results with. It's easy to get high rankings with unpopular words. For instance, the keyword &quot;cat leashes&quot; will get high popularity ranking because no one else would think of using it. What you are looking for is good results using popular keywords. Check out the software Wordtracker, available at <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wordtracker.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.wordtracker.com</a>. You can order a free trial, or a subscription ranging from 1 day to 1 year. This software rates the popularity of keywords and phrases based on actual search engine use.
<br /><br />Next, look for good results over an entire site that the company claims to have successfully worked for. You want to see a wide range of positions over a number of different search engines using different keywords or phrases for the entire site. Request a report for any client the company claims to have done well for. This report should show good positions on a number of the most popular search engines for a variety of different, popular keywords and phrases.
<br /><br />When you are checking out search engine optimization companies, make sure they have actually done the work they are claiming to have done. Some companies will use other company's results in order to get you to sign on with them. If you are in doubt, call the company they are showing you results for, and ask for the name of their search engine optimization company.
<br /><br />It's important to keep in mind that a successful search engine optimization campaign will result in maximum exposure across a wide range of popular search engines using a variety of keywords and phrases. This is the formula for a successful campaign, and you should always keep at it in the forefront of your marketing strategy.
<br /><br />Ask the search engine optimization company you are considering for a report that shows you rankings across a number of popular search engines for a period of at least six months. Remember: search engine marketing is a process that is continual, and you need a company that not only understands this, but keeps constant tabs on your search engine positions. That company must also be able to adjust its strategy in the event that search engine rankings drop.
<br /><br />Since search engine marketing is an ongoing process, your positions must be constantly monitored. If you want your search engine optimization company to do this for you, request a sample of a monthly report. It is essential that this report should show rankings for the most popular search engines. Don't be impressed by a report that only shows great results for a limited number of small search engines. These are fairly easy results to acquire. Also confirm that the popular search engine results they are showing you are indeed the popular search engines currently.
<br /><br />Be sure the sample report the company shows you is in a format that you can easily understand. For example, it could be in the form of a chart that covers a period of at least six months and presents data such as the top 50 positions broken down on a monthly basis or the top 5 pages each month. Then, ascertain that the company you are considering actually monitors these positions or pages every month, and that the sample report they show you includes findings and recommendations for the specific site. This insures that the company will actively monitor and make adjustments to their strategy on a continual basis rather than simply gather statistics on your positions. You need a company that is actively participant in your search engine marketing campaign, not just an information gatherer.
<br /><br />Obviously, your finances have to figure into your choice of company, but bear in mind that a search engine optimization company is crucial the success of your marketing campaign. It is not just a casual accessory. If you cannot afford a company that will do a thorough and reliable job for your website, you might consider waiting until you do have the finances in place.
<br /><br />If you have to find a company and can't wait for your finances to catch up, you may be able to find an affordable company that will also be able to supply quality, reliable work, such as a fairly new company. Just remember that there are risks involved with using a company without a proven track record—and that risk is your money! Don't take that leap unless the company can supply you with a least a few references.
<br /><br />References are the most reliable indicator of a good company. Don't use a company that won't show your references because of any reason, confidentiality included. Remember—even doctors will provide references! The firm you choose should provide you with a minimum of two references, one that is from the past, and one that is current.
<br /><br />When you contact these references, be prepared to ask precise, specific questions so that neither of your time is wasted. Ask them what their experience was like with the company, such as their availability to answer questions and deal with problems and their ability to meet deadlines. Ask the reference to rate the overall performance of the company.
<br /><br />Find out if the company requested that the reference make significant changes to their web pages that affected the visitors coming to their site. You are looking for a search engine optimization company that can balance the needs of both search engines and site visitors without compromising either.
<br /><br />The most essential question to ask is whether the work of the search engine optimization company resulted in higher profits for the reference. Without profits, it doesn't matter whether your positions are at the top of the list or not.

You need to make it easy for affiliates to get on board and get started right away. To do this, you will need to offer them certain things to work with. You should immediately tell them everything they need to know in the first e-mail you send to them. You don't have to go into great detail about it but you can touch on certain things and give more detail on your site. Take a look at some of the tools you can offer affiliates to keep them interested and functioning.
<br /><br />Advertisements
<br /><br />If you want your own affiliate program to work you need ads that are effective. You should make sure they are effective before you start handing them out to affiliates. You don't have to offer a ton of ads to affiliates at first. Start with a few and change them as you can. You can choose to allow affiliates to write ads as well for a better result. Remember, if your ads are no good, there is no point in having an affiliate program in the first place.
<br /><br />Graphics
<br /><br />You really need to make your available graphics easier than ever for affiliates to use. If you try to get complicated, they will not be effective. Set up your website so all the affiliate has to do is cut and past the HTML code into their own web page editor. When you do this, they will be more likely to use your graphics effectively. In addition, you need to be sure to display a small set of instructions for those who don't know what they are doing.
<br /><br />Content
<br /><br />One thing you shouldn't forget when you want to start your own affiliate program is content. You should offer your affiliates content they can use. They can paste the article onto their site and get more traffic. In addition, you can encourage them to write their own as well and update them regularly. The more updates they make to their content, the more people they will draw in and the more money everyone will make overall.
<br /><br />As you can see, as long as you offer simple and helpful tools to affiliates, you can think about starting your own affiliate program with no problems. Try having everything set up before you start signing affiliates up. When you have everything already planned out, you won't get as frazzled with the process. In fact, it should be a very fun and easy process overall. Starting your own affiliate program is beneficial to you and to the affiliates. When the program is so effective for everyone, you will be a huge success.

<br /><br />The normal advice is that upselling occurs on the Thank You/product download page. Actually, if you can make a sharp distinction between the various Thank You pages you may already have on your site, you can advertise more products than you may think.
<br /><br />Here are some 'labels':
<br /><br />1) Newsletter Thank You Page
<br />2) Paid Product Thank You Page
<br />3) Members Area Sign-up Page
<br />4) Use your 404 Code for your 404 error page at your site (sell a product every time visitors got your URLs wrong!)
<br />5) Safelist Sign-up Thank You Page (if you run a safelist)
<br />6) E-mail Confirmation Page
<br />7) Opt-In Thanks You Page
<br />8) Are there any more?
<br /><br />See? There are more places you can sell than you ever thought of. You can even include Adsense ads for additional income-by-clicks.
<br /><br />This is your homework: review all your Thank You pages and think of at least 2 products related to the subject matter of each page so that you can put them in.
<br /><br />Think of creative ways to make offers that are only exclusive to a few Thank You pages. Especially for the 404 error page, make your visitors feel they 'stumble' into a once-in-a-lifetime offer they can't resist, and you would hook them to a sale!

Some are not using it at all. As with just about any other social networking site you can mention, you have to put in the work at the start to establish yourself as a credible, helpful contributor who is there to do more than just give a sales message and win customers. Using Twitter is an art form all of its own, and is totally unlike anything you will do anywhere else.
<br /><br />The short length of the messages you are allowed to send means that you have to approach the task in a completely different way. The underlying principle does not change, however, and if you are looking to build a long term business presence, you will need to take a long-term view and work to build up your network of friends. These friends can see your twits on their Twitter home page, so it is well worth making the effort to cultivate as many as you can. You are allowed to put links in your twits, so you will need to restrain yourself from getting carried away and posting links too often.
<br /><br />As ever, it takes a bit of work and a bit of thought to use Twitter effectively. Make sure that your twits are of value and interesting. If you can keep abreast of breaking news, and the latest trends in your area of expertise, you can build up a reputation as being someone to watch out for. This will keep you on people's friend lists, and give you the chance to broadcast an occasional message about your own website or profile which will encourage them to visit. Driving social network traffic is never quick or easy, but you can build up a reputation which will result in regular visitors to your site, who have every chance of becoming regular customers.

		<document id="b18a79a0f3d0410edc1653c76f3e1e58" url=""><![CDATA[How To Write An Effective Web Copy<br/><br/>Writing an effective web copy begins with an understanding of what the goals of your website are. Are you trying to get your visitors to purchase something or have them sign up for your newsletter? Remember you are trying to get someone whom you can't see and have never met take a step towards building a relationship with you or your company.
<br /><br />1. Create a customer profile—Who is exactly your target audience?
<br /><br />Are they young, middle aged or senior?
<br />Are they primarily male or female?
<br />Are they financially secure or budget-minded?
<br />What gets him or her excited?
<br />What are his or her most pressing concerns?
<br /><br />2. Create a Unique Selling Position (USP)—Find out what are the needs and desires of your visitors. Brainstorm a list of topics that might interest your target audience. Then based on these evidences, propose a statement of 2–3 sentences that explains why you are different from everybody else. This is the unique factor that sets you apart from your competition. Make this the first thing your visitor sees when they arrive on your home page.
<br /><br />3. Focus on benefits—Most web users want to find the information about the product or service they need as fast as possible. If they land on your site, they want to know how they will benefit from buying your product or subscribing to your e-zine. You will need to answer that question as clearly and concisely as possible or you will lose that visitor.
<br /><br />4. Use headlines—Provide a summary of your information by clearly communicating the main purpose of your copy. Use informative headings and subheadings with a paragraph of 4–5 lines that supports them. You only have a few seconds to grab your visitors' attention. Most will simply scan for the information they are seeking.
<br /><br />5. Use bulleted or numbered lists, boldface or colored font to emphasize the points you wish to make.
<br /><br />6. Include links within the text to direct visitors to other pages of your site for more in-depth information. Effective navigation also helps visitors easily find the main sections of your site.
<br /><br />7. Write in an informal or personal style—It is your own unique way of differentiating your presence from other small businesses in a similar niche. It doesn't have to be too elaborate or super-creative. You simply provide a style that gets the attention of your visitors.
<br /><br />8. Keep your sentences simple—You are not writing to impress. You are writing to communicate. Make it easy for a 13-year-old to understand why you want to sell your product or service.
<br /><br />Don't use large words but opt for strong verbs over weak ones. Use the active voice instead of a passive one, i.e. instead of &quot;a good score was achieved by the team&quot;...say &quot;the team scored a season high&quot;. Speak &quot;to&quot; but not &quot;at&quot; your visitor. Keep your sentences short and snappy. Sometimes straight-forwardness is all it takes to bring results in the shortest time.
<br /><br />9. Include searchable keywords—Use targeted keywords in your web copy that will allow the search engines to find your site. Include these keywords in your meta tags, links and file names.
<br /><br />10. Eliminate the fluff—Don't waffle on in your writing. You will only bore your visitors and they will click elsewhere. Try to remove filler sentences that contain phrases like &quot;for those of you&quot; and &quot;all of you&quot;.
<br /><br />11. Proof-read your web copy—Errors in your web copy give the impression of being unprofessional or sloppy. Read the copy aloud to yourself or get someone else to proof-read it. Often they will find more errors because they are more objective.
<br /><br />Use the spell checker but don't rely on it. Often it doesn't pick up grammatical or vocabulary errors. Print a copy of your content. It's easier to find such errors on a hard copy this way.
<br /><br />12. Take a break—Revise your web copy after taking a break from it for several hours or a few days. This allows you to see it from a different viewpoint. You may find a better way to say something to further improve your copy.
<br /><br />13. Use images sparingly—Images should only be used if they relate and support your web content. If not, they will only distract the visitor from reading your web copy. Too many images will slow down the time it takes for your visitor to load your site in their browser.
<br /><br />Writing an effective web copy is the key to converting visitors into buyers. Getting thousands of visitors to your website doesn't guarantee sales. The types of words you use and how you combine and string them together is absolutely crucial to pressing the hot buttons of someone who would finally say, &quot;Yes, I MUST get it!&quot; Once you achieve this, your website will become very profitable.

		<document id="6345f51cb4279999f5e4bbedd10f751c" url=""><![CDATA[Individual Thinking vs. Group Thinking<br/><br/>There must be POWER in collective decision-making. We guess it is safer to say group thinking is more reliable than individual thinking. Throughout human history there is a secret consensus within shared cultures that uphold great societies, countries and civilizations and they had their 15 minutes of fame.
<br /><br />The fine line in teamwork is: do you tend to create differences with others or make the difference for others? Creating differences requires you assert ego. Making the difference requires you assert a self-standing principle which others may not be aware of but you know it's your job to make them understand your point of view for the benefit of themselves.
<br /><br />Sometimes, you must be prepared that your team mates will reject a 'principle' as 'your idea', and then every moment becomes a question of whether to follow the majority and go the wrong way or stick to oneself and believe it is the right way, and vice versa.
<br /><br />The twist of this article is individuality in a TEAM is important for self-preservation when you know how to master it. First, it is quite logical to say very creative people are hardly conformists, but they must train themselves long and hard to examine and conclude their own strength of character.
<br /><br />When you're right, do you really stand up to the group? Or do you talk yourself into convenient compromises? Do you listen to what everybody else says before you form your own opinion? Do you adjust your opinion so that it hews more closely to the group consensus?
<br /><br />If you can't rely on guidance from the group, you'd better have a damn good replacement or you've got to develop a talent for ferocious self-criticism. If you're going to stand up for your principles, you'd better make sure those principles are right. It's easy to stand up for your ego; it takes nothing more than the flick of a hormone to let ego run rampant. Generally speaking, many assertive people are not truly intellectually assertive; they are merely egotistically assertive. To do this well, you must develop an idea-attacking demon that assaults ideas (especially you on yourself) from every possible angle. Only an idea that can survive the meat grinder is worthy of further consideration.
<br /><br />Preserving your individuality against group thinking does not prevent you from soliciting the advice of those whose judgment you respect. More likely, you'll be weighing the difference in opinions before coming to a decision.
<br /><br />We're sure it happened to you that after carefully inquiring into the details of a recommended course of action and after much discussion, you announce you will take the opposite course of action! It sounds like you have wasted your mates' time. The trick here is that the value your confidants lies not in the actual recommendations but in the reasoning behind the recommendations. The question is: Are you sure your own reasonings will work for you? Or is it out of your comfort zone to accept their reasonings when the recommendations are obviously good? So you don't make decisions based on what your advisors &quot;vote for&quot;; your decisions are based on the soundness of the reasoning. If they offer no more arguments that you had not already anticipated, then you can conclude that your own thinking is sound and you proceed with it. On the other hand, your confidants' ability to surprise you is their trick to impress you to the point of changing your mind.
<br /><br />This is a very, very difficult subject to act on if easier to just write about. Your path in life very much hinges on this. As a team player yourself, be always prepared for group disapproval and balance group contribution for the common good with a robust process of self-criticism augmented with solicited criticism from mates as time demands.

Maybe 10 years down the road another new platform is born ('wiki' is the latest). For now, 'blog' is in the spotlight.
<br /><br />The blog shares some similarities with the web page as well as being the anti-thesis to the newsletter. It has its own URL so it can also be called a site. You update a web page via FTP upload, whereas you edit an existing post or create new ones within your blog account, so it's faster in a sense. Moreover, the most popular blog services are free (for now) so you don't have to pay for a blog host service, and so is a good substitute for a site except that you don't have the luxury of web space to upload other files. Setting up a blog quickly greatly benefits those who haven't got a site up yet.
<br /><br />Every week we have to upload a complete newsletter in our autoresponder and click a 'mass-mail' button. Even so, it may get filtered out, but this is 'push' marketing. The blog gets read mainly on-site and with RSS newsreaders or aggregators. Through these software the blog invites the general public to opt-in if they want to keep their Inbox aside for other purposes, so that's 'pull' marketing. If they are flooded with mails they may miss yours, but with a newsreader they just click on your blog link to access all your posts past and present. The major weakness (sort of) is your readers are still 'out there' so you can't qualify them into a list unlike what you can do with an autoresponder, but if they like what they read, they will stick to you.
<br /><br />The blog's most powerful feature is that every post ends with a 'Comment' link. Know how to exploit this to the fullest and you can forge interactivity with your readers. Since the game of the day is 'communication', no more formalities and e-zine marketing. Write in the way you speak, keep articles short and regular, and keep your blog tightly themed by applying SEO.
<br /><br />Essentially, the blog (you can create one at blogger.com) becomes a communication tool which forms a very significant extension to your site. And Google loves them. So...
<br /><br />credibility + consistency + SEO + link exchange = high ranking -&gt; TRAFFIC, yes!
<br /><br />If you already have a blog, you can submit to major blog directories for FREE and watch your traffic flood in. Do a search for &quot;free blog submission&quot;. Or you can click into our blog at <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.internetmasterycenter.com%2Fblog"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.internetmasterycenter.com/blog</a>, scroll down and look out for all the graphic buttons of the sites where you can submit your blogs.
<br /><br />Our little research tells us non-marketers outnumber marketers about 5 to 1 when it comes to blogging...except that only we have prosperity consciousness. If blogs are so popular, why not use it to enhance your online business presence?

Even a Buddhist saying is quoted, &quot;If you want to know your past life, look into your present condition; if you want to know your future life, look at your present actions.&quot;
<br /><br />So what happened to your dream lately? If it's STILL a dream, something is amiss, right?
<br /><br />The motivational gurus push you to slap high-fives and shout, &quot;AWESOME!&quot; and walk on broken glass and fire. You go back home on an emotional high and you still wouldn't care what they did to your 6-inches-between-the-ears as long as the 'drug' doesn't wear off.
<br /><br />You simply need a logical high to balance out. Specifically, you need an understanding of how taking little, insignificant-looking daily actions today can manifest your dream tomorrow. The honest folks caution you by saying Internet Marketing is just like any other business, and nothing is easy. We dare say it becomes much easier if you understand what this missing link is.
<br /><br />The truth is, your perception of Internet Marketing as a business can be broken down into bits and bytes from all that you see on your 15.4 or 17-inch screen. Do you know how easy it is for you to imitate Yahoo! as closely as possible if you so wishes? Why, Yahoo! has this section here and that section there, and an opt-in box here and an opt-in box there. Get your layout ready and fill the spaces with content, and keep on filling it and expand your web pages according to the size of your ambition.
<br /><br />You can never fall short when you feel you are doing your absolute professional best, but for lack of confidence in ideas or proven experience, there are many talented people out there who don't know how to start something right online. And even when they finally found all the pieces for a complete jigsaw puzzle (that means they acquired 'everything'), they still weren't sure because of this funny missing link.
<br /><br />&quot;So Yahoo! has this box that somehow links to this section,&quot; you ponder. &quot;But what is that huge infrastructure that makes it work?&quot; But we thought there's nothing huge about Yahoo! except for its servers. The command link between 2 modules is only a few lines of programming code...or is it?
<br /><br />You are a very young child observing from the top of the stairs a party put on by your parents for their friends. You are aware of all the events taking place in the party, but you have little means to understand them. You know a little bit of language, so you can understand snippets of conversation. You certainly understand facial expression, so you can recognize fragmentary aspects of the interpersonal interaction. But you know nothing of sexual flirtation, political contention, or the effects of alcohol, so most of what you see makes no sense whatever. After several hours of seeing this spectacle, you return to your room and try to explain to your twin sibling what happened. Would you not explain the party in the only terms you had a grip on: the facial expressions? Would you not fill in the logical gaps in your representation with the meager stock of human behaviors you understood? A sexual flirtation becomes &quot;he likes her&quot;; a political argument becomes &quot;he doesn't like him&quot;, possibly because &quot;he's been bad&quot;. Drunkenness is interpreted as dizziness or silliness.
<br /><br />For lack of adult experience, you are amused by what you just saw as the party plays out like a dream. But will your preoccupation with the party today determines the path you will take tomorrow? Quite likely, you look forward to playtime at school, and then by next week, you don't even remember there was a party.
<br /><br />Corey Rudl and Bill Gates, for all their experiences, cannot touch your dream. Your dream in online business is what people will remember and support you for as you try to complete it. Your preoccupation with this dream is the energy devoted NOW to bring about the harvest at the end of the day. Experience counts for nothing except as reference to past lessons. That implies that 'experience' is just a useful tool. You just cannot afford to wait for time to pass you by in order to gain experience...whatever that means, nor perfect timing. Your action starts now. When? NOW. 
<br /><br />If there are any missing links that you don't understand for lack of experience, OBSERVE the TRUTH behind the chicken nature of these links, then imitate it.

		<document id="6b0ccd8544fb27c9fa7f10df656c5195" url=""><![CDATA[The One And Only Secret To Ultimate Success<br/><br/>In English idiom, &quot;2 left feet&quot; refers to an inept dancer and generally, a clumsy person. Putting this meaning aside, I wish I had 2 left feet so that I don't have to worry whether to go left or right, so I'll just stick to left and let Life happens as it always does, and if I walk left long enough, maybe enough people will start to question, &quot;Does this guy ever turn right?&quot;
<br /><br />Regardless of what 'success' means to you, for everyone reading this, it is a plus, not a minus. Success is a profitable endeavour. No intelligent people on earth would insist on walking from circumstance to circumstance getting pulled down all the time and still declare themselves a 'success' if that's fine with them. Well, it's fine with them, but I call it 'stubbornness'.
<br /><br />Success is not hocus-pocus; it's all about FOCUS. Just how many people had faltered in time past, thought twice and diverted when success was just a block away or around the corner. Consider the total revenue (in US$ billions) amassed by Coca-Cola and Pepsi Cola. Pepsi bought over Taco Bell, KFC, Domino Pizza and owns a range of soft drinks like 7-Up, Miranda and others, to name just a few.
<br /><br />Come to think of it, so many 'advisors' in the world say you shouldn't put your eggs in one basket; that's why you diversify your attention left and right. Here is one very great example of why putting all your eggs in one basket can earn you 10 times more. Coca-cola may not be good at mergers and acquisitions, but it has transcended that kind of business. It has become such an evangelistic institution that it conquers India faster than you can say 'Christianity'.
<br /><br />It's the same with McDonald's. McDonald's stick to 'McDonald's' and The Mac--small and big--becomes such an indispensable identity, people cannot &quot;think outside the Mac&quot;. Today, many food franchises have emulated McDonald's franchise/food delivery system, but it is still the largest food chain in the world and will remain that way for a good while.
<br /><br />You can be a successful entrepreneur and feel relatively secure in life. You may no longer need to worry about maintaining your home or the welfare of your spouse and kids, but the level of success enjoyed by Coca-cola and McDonald's is something on a scale that cannot be contained by family life, not saying that family life may be a hindrance too. To rise to that level, surely more work needs to be done on building up current flagship products and foundation.
<br /><br />So do you start to walk right? Not really. Success is really achieving one thing and using that as a stepping stone to achieve something else. It's no secret, but oh, how many CEOs do not have the wisdom to appreciate it. For some reasons, they thought having only one type of product is not enough to provide a sense of security, so 'expansion' means 'diversification'.
<br /><br />Creative Technology might have a better bet sticking to its &quot;digital home entertainment&quot; concept. It could have built on the SoundBlaster to move closer to that vision quickly rather than to dabble with MP3 players and optical disk drives. The MP3 player market already belongs to the iPod, no matter how technically bad it is compared to other players while Creative had to write off its disk drives in the late 90s due to excess inventory, remember? It wins some, it loses some, but has the company learnt its lesson yet? Someone must go to the main headquarters in Jurong and tell Mr. Sim Wong Hoo about it.
<br /><br />Netscape Communications came very close to that level of success, very close. It collapsed on itself by expending all its energy on suing Microsoft because it must have thought &quot;the Internet and the browser market is mine, MINE! Muahaha&quot;. Instead of improving its own backyard, it got distracted by another company's presence and competition. What does that tell you about not having enough faith in oneself? Now Microsoft and Google are encroaching in each other's territories so we shall see how history repeats itself.
<br /><br />Friends, be focused! The center-point of your attention and the jewel in your eye is the most profitable of them all. Your family members and a few close friends may know you for many good and bad secrets, but most people know you for only one thing. I know nuts about the ingredients that go into making Coca-cola, but the impression is it's better than Pepsi. Creative Technology is known for creating beautiful sounds on the computer. Bill Gates got rich making software. Michael Jordan is the king of basketball, so is Muhammed Ali for boxing, and either have tried baseball. The late Peter Drucker is the founding father of management consultancy and much less well known for his infatuation with Japanese art. Who cares about Japanese art until someone comes along and proactively promotes it like a loudhailer all his/her life?
<br /><br />If you want to catch the attention of as many people as possible, you simply cannot diversify. Do not be tempted left and right but ponder the narrow path right upon your feet in front of you. Here are 3 ways you can build up your ultimate success through focus:
<br /><br />1) Build on your strength. Each and every person has a set of different capabilities, in which some are greater than others. Do you know what you are already good at? Do you have a revenue model for your capabilities? Start building up those good ones to a commercial level with more practice and research for better revenue generating methods in exchange for your products and services which arise out of your capabilities. The beginning of an unsuccessful business is when you become a jack of all trades and master of none.
<br /><br />2) Build on your uniqueness. This refers to natural talent. Beethoven composed his first symphony at the age of 4. You call that 'capability' or 'talent'? The question is: what are the few things you can do brilliantly without pushing too hard? While others find it difficult, you find easy. When you find something that gets you excited and passionate about, business becomes play instead of work.
<br /><br />3) Build on your life purpose. For a great many people, money is a stumbling block. We are constantly trying to ensure that our deserved payoff matches the amount of effort we expend, no less, but yeah, more would be a bonus, thank you very much. If everybody thinks and acts like this, we will all be a step closer to hell really. There's no greatness in living a life as suckers. Truth is, living a purpose-driven life is most profitable at its heart when you feel you are really alive doing the things you love to do and knowing that your contribution to the people around you will make you great, without ever thinking so much about payoff.
<br /><br />You only have one life to live, so what do you want to be remembered for before you die? Think about it. Life is full of all its joy and pain, and consequences whether you do certain things or not, but until you gain a sense of direction as you ponder every step of your feet, you wouldn't have known how wonderful 'progress' means to you. Achievement is a great feeling; don't indulge in it though, it's only interim. There's always another level of success ahead of you...yet.
<br /><br />All roads lead to Rome; that doesn't mean it's necessary for you to go to Perth. But if you have no choice but to go one big round through Perth, you will have to do it if you seriously want people to remember you for your one and only Rome.

		<document id="1620b2963d8c25c42ca30e73b33d5b4f" url=""><![CDATA[The Strategies Of Long And Expired Domain Names<br/><br/>In the world of 21st century, it is no longer surprising to find that most business had already establishes a web presence to support their brick-and-mortar businesses. There are many advantages of establishing a web presence on the Internet such as selling globally to prospective customers and disseminating information to the public.
<br /><br />Most business owners would have already understood the importance of a web presence to their businesses. What most of them had failed to understand is that the domain name in their websites can contribute significantly to their online marketing strategy.
<br /><br />First, we look at a few rules of a good domain name. Most would agree that a good domain name should:
<br /><br />1) be able to describe your business when people first look it.
<br />2) include hyphen in between the words to make it easier to read.
<br />3) have an appropriate .com, .net, .biz, .info, .org to reflect the nature of the business.
<br /><br />What I differ in opinion is that a long domain name can be as effective as a short domain name depending on the context where the domain name is used. Many people would probably disagree with me on this point as they believe that a short domain name is easier to remember, but short domain names are easily imaginable and would have already been snapped up before you know it.
<br /><br />Still, when the context is right, having a catchy long domain name such as <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dont-miss-a-thing.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.dont-miss-a-thing.com</a> or <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.once-in-a-lifetime.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.once-in-a-lifetime.com</a> definitely helps to draw attention to your business rather than promoting your website name like <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.yourcompanyname.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.yourcompanyname.com</a>, which is a usual practice, but remember this: customers don't care much about your company name or even your name until they can find the solution to their needs. When people reach <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dont-miss-a-thing.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.dont-miss-a-thing.com</a> or <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.once-in-a-lifetime.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.once-in-a-lifetime.com</a>, you are already communicating the meaning of a message before driving them to the appropriate web page. That's why context is so important in aiding keyword research, and having the right keywords in your domain name for increasing appeal.
<br /><br />Thus, depending on the context where the domain name is used, a domain name can actually help to make or break your overall marketing performance.
<br /><br />On the other hand, buying expired or unavailable domains is a smart move. These are truly underrated traffic sources. It's like people going to a shop when it has already closed down and they suddenly teleport (redirect page) to your shop. Once you bought it, make sure the web host company doesn't own it (YOU own it) and you can always transfer the domain to a cheaper host. Do a search for 'purchase expired domains' and you get good leads.
<br /><br />People going to an invalid hair gel site are not going to buy an e-book on viral marketing, so you must buy domains with the right keywords related to your business.
<br /><br />And of course, those cyber-squatters who make a living out of buying and selling domain names (read: GOOD keywords) are playing a different ball game altogether.

		<document id="cc355b8e60fb7af203b9faf722282714" url=""><![CDATA[The Two Worlds Of Kobe Bryant<br/><br/>&quot;To go from that legal type of setting to the basketball court in one day requires amazing concentration,&quot; Lakers forward Rick Fox said. &quot;And Kobe is not only doing it, but he's growing as a player at the same time—if that's possible.&quot;
<br /><br />Back when Kobe was fighting against a charge of felony sexual assault in 2003, at the time of the report by Sports Illustrated, Kobe averaged 25.2 points, 7.4 rebounds and 7.5 assists since the All-Stars break, each number pushing the limits of his career marks.
<br /><br />It's not just the hours of consistent practice he put in. His greatest attribute (<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/4210//smilies/unsure.gif" alt=":)" /> is an almost sociopathic focus that also alienates his teammates and may be the cause of his rift with O'Neal.
<br /><br />Like what Rick Fox said, Kobe's ability to tune in and out and between 2 very different environments like the Court of Justice and the basketball court is forcing him too deep into living in his own self-made world.
<br /><br />Actually it is a very familiar thing to some of us. Have you, in the midst of doing a top-priority task, got frustrated and shouted, &quot;Don't disturb me!&quot;? You may not have this personality trait, but some people find it easy to become self-absorbed and withdraw yourself into ignoring the kids, the kettle boiling etc.
<br /><br />Would you believe this 'amazing concentration' can be learned? This is what you do. Find a good quiet time and soundproof your room (close the windows and door)...all except for a rhythmic sound, e.g. the ticking of a clock.
<br /><br />Sit still, close your eyes and get yourself in tune with the rhythm. When you are ready, start to count along with the rhythm, all the ticks so to speak. The question is when the clock ticks for 60 seconds, did you count at 59 or 61? If you are seriously concentrating, there shouldn't be room for errors, period.
<br /><br />Next, you can fix your eyes on a particular pattern anywhere in your room down to a dot, and really concentrate on that spot while you count up to 60. After 60 seconds, are you sure you are still staring at the same spot? Or have you become groggy?
<br /><br />Now you think you are all right at 60 seconds, extend your test to 2 minutes and more. Some people cannot stand doing this kind of &quot;crazy stuff&quot;, yet it does help those who get easily distracted. Out of the 5 senses, the senses of sight and sound are through which we receive our inputs from the environment the most, so they are to be trained.
<br /><br />Even when you have a headache, employing this kind of 'sociopathic' concentration and attitude can help you to get a job done. Seriously, why would you not take a rest? A self-development coach we know said, &quot;You will yourself to fix your concentration into the moment despite outside influences because you acknowledge 100% responsibility for that moment.&quot;
<br /><br />Internet marketers don't stay up late at 4, 5 am because they are passionate, nor do they need to drink coffee. If there is a thing they must do to finish it, and on time, they will snap themselves into wakefulness in the name of professionalism.

		<document id="a7bc83fce84cd6849528a913a407ee92" url=""><![CDATA[Understanding The Benefits Of Using Autoresponders<br/><br/>If you've reached the point of exhaustion trying to keep up with answering the mountain of e-mails that threatens to bury you alive every single day, you're ready to learn about autoresponders.
<br /><br />The bad news is that people expect prompt replies to their e-mail inquiries. However, unless you can figure out how to work continual 24-hour shifts, or hire enough people to constantly monitor incoming e-mails (while they're eating up your revenue), you have a problem. The good news is an autoresponder is an inexpensive—or even free—method of quickly responding to e-mails. What these programs do is automatically respond to incoming e-mails as soon as they are received.
<br /><br />E-mails are essential to your business for many different reasons. Most importantly, these invisible e-mail voices give you their feedback about your website—for free! However, if you spend all your working hours answering these e-mails, how are you supposed to run your business?
<br /><br />The answer is simple: use autoresponders. Autoresponders are programs that automatically respond to your e-mails without you so much as having to click on your mouse.
<br /><br />There are a number of good reasons why you need an autoresponder besides just answering your e-mail. For example, autoresponders can be used if you need a way to send information about your services or products, price lists, or if there are repeated questions asked across large numbers of e-mails. Maybe you want to offer your site visitors a special bonus of some kind, such as advice or relevant articles. All of this can be handled by an autoresponder. Additionally, you can advertise your business and then build stable relationships with your customers by using autoresponders.
<br /><br />Autoresponder programs vary from software that runs with your e-mail program to a specialized script that runs on your web hosting company's server. This kind of script may use a web page form or simply operate with your e-mail account. This kind of script is programmed to send out a standardized message whenever an e-mail is received. The message is sent to a particular script or e-mail address.
<br /><br />Some autoresponders can do more than simply send out standardized messages. They can send out an unlimited number of follow-up messages sent at predetermined interval of time. For example, you can set your autoresponder to send out a new message every day for as long a period as you desire.
<br /><br />There are numerous companies who offer autoresponders free of charge. Your website hosting company often provides autoresponders as a free service. If this is not the case with your web hosting company, there are numerous companies who offer this service for a small fee, or free of charge, providing you attach an advertisement for their company to your e-mails.
<br /><br />To personalize your autoresponder messages, you can attach a signature. Signatures in this case are much like business cards. You can include your name, company, all your contact numbers and addresses, and a brief message.
<br /><br />It's a good idea to attach a signature to every e-mail that is sent out. This works as a repeated reminder of your business identity every time a customer sees it. The more they look at your signature, the more likely your company will spring to mind when your particular service or product is needed.
<br /><br />You can create a standardized signature that every employee in your business uses, or you can go wild, and let every staff member create their own personal signature. Of course, like everything in life, there are some rules and guidelines to creating a personal signature.
<br /><br />Keep the length of your signature between four to six lines of text, with no more than 70 characters in a single line. Make sure that your e-mail program does not cut off your text! The content should include your name, your company name, your e-mail address, fax number, and any other contact details, such as 800 numbers. Lastly, always include a short personal message about your company. It should be a subtle sell of your services or your products, and possibly your company's reliability and longevity.
<br /><br />Another specialized use of autoresponders is to create courses that you can then offer your site visitors for free. You must choose a topic in which you are an expert and that precisely targets your potential customers.
<br /><br />Once you have carefully chosen your subject, divide it into a number of different sub-topics. Then offer your site visitor a free 10 or 15 day course, each day offering a different sub-topic. The first topic should always be a welcome message to your site visitor and an explanation about what is to follow. Your explanation should be enticing, getting the point across that you are offering free, quality information that your target audience will find of great value.
<br /><br />With every lesson, include the number of the lesson, the topic title, information about your company and its services or products. At the end, include a few blurbs about the next lesson to entice the subscriber to continue on.
<br /><br />Make sure each topic is packed with essential and valuable information, and leaves the visitor lusting to know more. Otherwise, you may lose them in the very beginning.
<br /><br />Of course, you have to write up your course before you can offer it. Once you have done this, and gone over the material carefully, employing a professional writer or editor if necessary, you must transfer your text to your autoresponder.
<br /><br />There are a number of quality autoresponders you can try out for a free or low-priced trial. Just go to Google and search 'autoresponders', then sign-up for your chosen autoresponder. Once you do, you will receive instructions as to how to set it up and transfer your text.
<br /><br />E-mail is an excellent marketing tool; it is inexpensive and it is fast. Use it to advertise your business by choosing your e-mail address carefully. Your website should contain different e-mail addresses for different contact requests. For example, use <a href="/go/messages/send/receiver=info@yourdomain.com">info@yourdomain.com</a> for information requests, or <a href="/go/messages/send/receiver=sales@yourdomain.com">sales@yourdomain.com</a> for questions about sales. It's a good idea to set up one for the owner, such as <a href="/go/messages/send/receiver=president@yourdomain.com">president@yourdomain.com</a>. This presents your company in a personal, approachable light and insures that direct contact is provided.
<br /><br />Autoresponders are an effective and powerful marketing tool, allowing you to make contact with thousands of potential customers. This is an invaluable asset considering how many potential customers you usually have contact with before you make an actual sale. Essentially, an autoresponder allows you to automate part of your marketing campaign.

<br /><br />Interestingly, if you should look back at how you made your 'final' decisions in the past, you may find a pattern and a set of reasons for why you made your decisions in a certain way. Now, this is a part where you as a reader would be wondering what point I am driving at.
<br /><br />It's all in the habits.
<br /><br />Habit is the encompassing definition of the translation from &quot;how you think&quot; to &quot;what you do&quot;. It is incredible that general statistics point to a real fact that 80% of businesses do not last over 2 years, but at a personal level, people don't seem to realize larger implications and consequences in the scheme of things even as they drudge through the motions of daily work.
<br /><br />Some things never change, particularly knowledge at grassroots level. An effective habit grounded well is knowledge applied from grassroots level onwards. In business, how many people know how to increase leads, build a database, convert them into customers, develop relationships with them, treat them right, follow-up and mold them into repeat customers? But this is the foundation for future profits, no matter how you work your business and how often you change your methodologies or habits.
<br /><br />It is not easy for people to bear principles in mind while being adaptable to changing situations, but no matter how vague the truth is, it is that &quot;the root of all things keeps them in a firm position&quot;. Therefore one can be down but never out. Setbacks are temporary only when they don't displace you completely. Yes, you can solve them with a tweak and a change.
<br /><br />On the other hand, the need for a change can make one uncomfortable depending on its scale. Ultimately, think through this: if your business is not doing as well as it should for quite some time, what decisions have you made and actions implemented to elevate it from your current situation, so that it won't be the same or even fall towards failing tomorrow, next week and next month? Strange but true, as long as bad times continue, today is the best time for you to reflect, take stock of your business and re-strategize for the better. If you have not done so, do not procrastinate. If you feel stuck in a quagmire, I would like you to be fully aware that your habits of yesterday produced the results and outcome of today, and whatever you do today, you will be tomorrow. This is an irrevocable and natural law!
<br /><br />If you do not change, change will conquer you! Being smart at conquering change is all about being creative and inventive at doing things in a different way, not doing completely different things, but the primary purpose is the same: to survive! No business can ultimately be a success if it is unable to survive. Every business needs to know what changes are occurring within its environment and will be in the future to effect a corresponding change within the company. When right and wrong decisions are separated by a fine line, they must be made without regrets after careful evaluations of the best actions that will steer the enterprise in the preferred course. Awareness and experience through the rough times can only help to sharpen your survival instincts for better days in the future regardless of any unforeseen and unfortunate circumstances. If there's anything good that came out of setbacks, it is that you have grown to respond against complacency and proactively take charge of your life with new ways, new habits and new solutions.
<br /><br />Embracing a readiness for proactive self-change is actually a catalyst for spotting and working out opportunities, which is essentially an act of stepping yourself up to the next level. Setbacks and problems are everywhere waiting for someone to solve and profit from them. If only you have talked to enough people and opened your eyes wide enough, you would have seen that the hotel, airline, retail, tourism and F&amp;B industries, among hundreds of others, are in dire need of help. Every other day, people are looking forward to the next savior who can propose a solution—be it sales and marketing, customer retention, loyalty and affiliation schemes, products and services, technology optimization etc.—that makes them say, &quot;Bingo!&quot;
<br /><br />So for this article, I touched on 3 major issues: embracing the need for change, considering the impact of habits and laying the foundation of principles. He who can work within the ebb and flow of these 3 issues will be enriched with professional experiences. It is with experiences and through awareness of these experiences that wisdom can be cultivated, and with wisdom comes understanding, pertaining to the nature of a problem, in order to arrive at an appropriate solution through creativity and innovation, endorsed by all.

Did you know that newsletters are one of the most important components for you to drive traffic to your website and build your online business?
<br /><br />The popularity of newsletters is based on the thirst for information by information-hungry Internet surfers. The main reason people are online is because they want and need information and that is exactly what newsletters provide.
<br /><br />There are 3 major advantages of starting your own newsletter, no matter what product or service that you are offering. They are:
<br /><br />- Being able to maintain regular contact 
<br />- Being able to build a relationship with your subscribers 
<br />- Being able to offer new products and services
<br /><br />A newsletter allows you to keep the connection with your site visitors reminding them of how your product is suited for them.
<br /><br />The other, often overlooked, advantage of having a newsletter, is the income it can generate, not from selling your products and services or links to affiliate programs, but from selling advertising space in it.
<br /><br />You do need a medium to large subscriber base before other businesses will be interested in advertising, but this is not that hard to achieve, especially if it is regularly full of quality content. You can earn a few hundred, even thousands of dollars, every month just from ads if you play your cards rights.
<br /><br />Your online customers will eventually become your offline customers if they trust the information you regularly send them. Put simply, a newsletter is your way of helping people. If you help people online, eventually they will buy from you.
<br /><br />However, running your own newsletter involves a considerable amount of work. It is vital that you regularly write a lot of quality content before your next release. Ideally a newsletter should be sent out every week or at least every fortnight. This is not always easy. It definitely takes consistency and a keen eye for content.
<br /><br />You see, just as it is on your website...content is KING in your newsletters.
<br /><br />You need to offer valuable information, products, services, and more to keep your subscribers clicking on every newsletter that you send out.
<br /><br />In conclusion, running your own newsletter can have a very positive impact on your website and online business. If you dedicate yourself to keeping it up, you will find it well worth the effort. We have seen incredible success on the Internet that is most encouraging as we integrate work, play and home into a lifestyle, one that we're sure you have a desire for too. I wish the same for you.

<br /><br />1. Affiliate type website.
<br />2. Content website with Adsense.
<br />3. Affiliate type + Adsense.
<br />4. Your own product - membership site.
<br />5. Your own product - ebook.
<br />6. JV deals.
<br />7. Your own product - software.
<br />8. Directory type site.
<br />9. Online newsletter.
<br />10. Promote affiliate products using AdWords.
<br />Bonus. Sell on Ebay + your own site.
<br /><br />The VERY top way is to create your OWN business and market it well. Find out what YOU are GOOD at, see if there is a niche, and start your business in that niche. Run it like a professional business with profit/loss evaluation, business plan, goals, etc. You can make a lot of money doing this, but most people won't take the time and effort to make it happen. Question is: Will you be the one to do it?

If you've not got a unique position, then you'll find that you've got nowhere to &quot;stand out&quot; of the crowd throughout your promotion.
<br /><br />USPs were originally defined around the 40s as a position a company took to make them stand out from their competitors and make the customers of said competitors switch to them. It works as an understandable and tangible reason for people to buy your product, over that of other competing products, or as a benefit that your competitors don't offer.
<br /><br />For example, a bank in the UK can be promoting itself based on these propositions:
<br /><br />1) All call centers are in the UK—so no one is dealing with crackly lines, or broken English due to the call centers being based in a lower-cost area of the world.
<br /><br />2) It has no middlemen—which means there's no commissions to pay to anyone.
<br /><br />3) It has no shareholders, so it does not charge money for things that should be free.
<br /><br />That's the USP for that bank and it has resulted in many people switching to it.
<br /><br />The USP is anything that makes you 'different' from your peers. The only caveat to this is to make sure it's a clear difference—anything unclear, or too technical may not work, or be completely overlooked by your customers, thereby creating no reason for them to switch to you or choose you over your competitors.
<br /><br />Your unique sales position is a clearly defined statement of what your business stands for—what makes it special apart from others, and is your key to monopolizing a stake in your customers' mind. If you have not thought of a USP before, why not think through all the departments of your business e.g. finance, accounting, human resources, sales and marketing, pre- and post-sales support etc. and discover if there's anything outstanding enough to be worth telling your customers about it? Just don't be shy about promoting it.
<br /><br />Say, your USP could be your customer service position, whether it has to do with your response time, or your guarantee. But if your rivals are also competing on response time, one strategy is to flesh out a true instance or circumstance as a case study for prospects to refer to. By this method you're telling the story of how Mrs. Smith became very relieved that fast response time had saved her husband's life and therefore became a high-profile testimony for the hospital. People love inspiring stories because they are what make incidents sound special and unique. This would be your USP angle.
<br /><br />Ultimately, having a USP is nothing more than a matter of positioning perspectives. How do you want your business to be viewed by your prospects compared to others? It certainly helps that each individual's needs are already different. All you can do to the best of your abilities is to craft that position to match their needs, thereby gaining a competitive edge over other merchants/vendors. Thereafter, everything you do to reinforce the USP is to instill confidence in the prospects that your proposed solutions will work out. You will have to be fluid and flexible in your approach to reconcile with a wide range of different needs and yet align your corporate values with the common points shared by these needs in order to serve well and consistently in the business.

		<document id="f69dcbad80b3397b15289691488d28b" url=""><![CDATA[Wipe Out Your Competitors With 3 'Be' Tips!<br/><br/>I had a passionate conversation with my cousin over this idea of &quot;Internet Marketing&quot;. He asked as many questions as I can answer accordingly.
<br /><br />One significant question he asked is about how to compete with 'so many people and websites' in this business. This is the first time I'm ever asked such a question since I started out, so I did my best to answer...and my answer must have so impressed his father who overheard it that he said, &quot;Yes yes, this is also exactly what I told my staff too.&quot;
<br /><br />This uncle is in the construction business and he does not know much about the Internet as I do, but the point is if he agrees with what I said, then the answer must contain principles applicable in real life.
<br /><br />I do admit that over the years I learned, inculcated and mastered as best as I can what I know to be universal principles whether they can be applied online or off.
<br /><br />I told my cousin you don't have to 'compete' though everything is done in 'healthy competition'. He has 3 courses of action to participate online, or in any other environments which he so chooses:
<br /><br />1) Be Yourself. I personally think that one of the hardest skill in self-development is 'knowing thyself' and shaping your personal identity throughout the years of business evolution. This calls for immense foresight and smart work at sustainability. A great example is Microsoft. This corporation always outdoes its own products and services and therefore it is able to evolute itself. What a powerful lesson it imparts! You better like this company now.
<br /><br />The first paragraph of pg. 129 in Stephen Covey's &quot;The 7 Habits Of Highly Effective People&quot; quotes from Viktor Frankl: &quot;Ultimately, man should not ask what the meaning of life is, but rather must recognize that it is he who is asked. In a word, each man is questioned by life; and he can only answer to life by answering for his own life; to life he can only respond by being responsible.&quot;
<br /><br />2) Be Different. If someone stands at a particular spot in a room, and you can't stand at his spot because you can't shift him, are you going to kill yourself of an opportunity to stand elsewhere when it so happens that this very BIG room contains only the 2 of you?
<br /><br />If some of you reading this is losing heart right now over your own e-business, this is my encouragement to you: STAND FIRM, because you are already different. Continue to recognize and uphold the uniqueness of who YOU ARE and...*next point*
<br /><br />3) Be Better. The first case of betterment is to continually take corrective action and improve on your own existing results. If you commit a mistake, ADMIT IT. Admission always opens a new pathway for corrections and improvements. In past experience I know of people who did not allow friends, for all their genuine intentions, to help them simply because they refused to admit defeat! 
<br /><br />The second case of betterment is to continually take corrective action and improve on other people's existing results. If you think you can do better than Jay Abraham, if you think you can do better than Yahoo.com, if you think you can do better than the website next door, if you think you can do better than where you are NOW, GO FOR IT.
<br /><br />How To Wipe Out The Competition With Just A 'Niche'
<br /><br />As I write this very special report, another idea that is &quot;Niche Marketing&quot; comes to mind. What is a niche really? What is your definition of a 'niche'? Is it any more different than the 3 above points, or is it on a spot marked 'X' right under your nose?
<br /><br />Currently one of the hottest area in Internet Marketing is &quot;Niche Marketing&quot; and now we have several trailblazing personalities to present you a whole lot of education out of it. You can 'jump' on the bandwagon as it was with people 'jumping' onto Internet Marketing but your decision, action and performance will not prove that you are in &quot;Niche Marketing&quot; unless you fully understand what the above 3 'Be' points really mean to you. Do you understand this very significant point?
<br /><br />Truth is, you may not need experience in &quot;Niche Marketing&quot; to do &quot;Niche Marketing&quot;, but don't let other people expose you for this 'missing' fact!
<br /><br />Our site Internet Mastery Center is a niche. How is that possible? Because we dare to be different? Actually it's not as hard as it sounds. We are able to create this site simply because no one else did it in a similar fashion! And so it contains our own unique business angle.
<br /><br />Can you see in your mind's eye what is your own unique business angle? What can you 'BE' to be unique?
<br /><br />Here Is One Niche Identification Technique
<br /><br />As a toastmaster, I frequently visit clubs to participate and enjoy a meeting at exercising my public speaking skills. All you toastmasters out there will appreciate what I'm going to write next. At the beginning of each meeting, the language evaluator introduces a &quot;Word Of The Day&quot; with which s/he explains the meaning and significance of a chosen word and then encourages all attendees to use this word as frequently as possible in their speeches. It's fun and challenging because no one knows what the word is before the meeting but that's besides the point.
<br /><br />The point is this one single word is going to dictate how all attendees are strategizing to fit it in every time they are called upon to speak.
<br /><br />Similarly, all you need is just one PROFITABLE keyword to reap the full potential out of it and dictate an entire target market as your clients strategize to fit it in their overall business agenda!
<br /><br />It could be &quot;MONEY, &quot;SEX&quot;, &quot;POWER&quot;, &quot;PROFIT&quot;, &quot;KEYWORD&quot;...&quot;keyword marketing&quot;, &quot;car polishing cream&quot;, &quot;decorative lighting&quot;, etc. Surely the first 5 words are no longer specialized niches (unless you don't see it that way). The best is what YOU know BEST, can do BEST, and make the BEST money out of it (and still be unique, that is).
<br /><br />You can start jotting down a list of words on paper and flip through your dictionary or thesaurus for assistance.
<br /><br />Our word is &quot;Mastery&quot;...what's yours?
<br /><br />Any ordinary folks who suddenly seemed to know how to answer all the above questions will find that they can dabble in Niche Marketing, Internet Marketing or any other 'Marketing' whatever...and they will be UNSTOPPABLE.
<br /><br />Therefore it gives me no more greater pleasure than to learn from you, Dear Master Marketer.
<br /><br />Thank you for being online.
