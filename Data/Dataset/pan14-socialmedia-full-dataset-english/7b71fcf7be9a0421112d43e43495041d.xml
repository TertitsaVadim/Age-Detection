<br />I guess that's why sometimes
<br />I get impatient waiting,
<br />Wondering when we'll finally be together
<br />All the time.
<br />I understand that it has to be this way for now, 
<br />And I really believe we're doing 
<br />The right thing.
<br />I trust that our love is strong enough
<br />To see us through,
<br />and that someday soon
<br />we'll be able to talk and touch
<br />and love each other
<br />the way we've wanted to for so long.
<br />I'ts just difficult for me sometimes
<br />because I want you so much now. ;-/

<br />know which one it is, you will know what to do for that person. 
<br /><br />When someone is in your life for a REASON, it is usually to meet a need 
<br />you have expressed. They have come to assist you through a difficulty, to 
<br />provide you with guidance and support, to aid you physically, emotionally 
<br />or spiritually. They may seem like a godsend and they are. They are there 
<br />for the reason you need them to be. Then, without any wrongdoing on your 
<br />part or at an inconvenient time, this person will say or do something to 
<br />end the relationship. Sometimes they die. Sometimes they walk 
<br />away. Sometimes they act up and force you to take a stand. What we must 
<br />realize is that our need has been met, our desire fulfilled, their work is 
<br />done. The prayer you sent up has been answered and now it is time to move 
<br />on. 
<br /><br />Some people come into your life for a SEASON, because your turn has come to 
<br />share, grow or learn. They bring you an experience of peace or make you 
<br />laugh. They may teach you something you have never done. They usually give 
<br />you an unbelievable amount of joy. Believe it, it is real But only for a 
<br />season. 
<br /><br />LIFETIME relationships teach you lifetime lessons, things you must build 
<br />upon in order to have a solid emotional foundation. Your job is to accept 
<br />the lesson, love the person and put what you have learned to use in all 
<br />other relationships and areas of your life. It is said that love is blind 
<br />but friendship is clairvoyant. 
<br /><br />Thank you for being a part of my life , 
<br />whether you were a reason, a season or a lifetime.

<br />what we have until it is gone;
<br />Too often we wait too late to say
<br />&quot;I'm sorry - I was wrong.&quot;
<br />Sometimes it seems
<br />we hurt the ones
<br />we hold dearest
<br />to our hearts;
<br />And we allow foolish things to tear our lives apart.
<br />Far too many times
<br />we let unimportant things into our minds;
<br />And then it's usually too late
<br />to see what made us blind.
<br />So be sure that you let people know how much
<br />they mean to you;
<br />Take that time to say the words
<br />before your time is through.
<br />Be sure that you appreciate
<br />everything you've got'
<br />And be thankful for the Little Things in Life
<br />that mean a lot.

<br />Sometimes we crave the things we lack and don't know what to do.
<br />Sometimes life's an uphill ride with mountains we must climb.
<br />At times the river's deep and wide and crossing takes some time.
<br />No one said that life is easy - There are no guarantees,
<br />So trust in the Lord continually on calm or stormy seas.
<br />The challenges we face today prepare us for tomorrow.
<br />For faith takes our fears away and peace replaces sorrow.

<br />To look into your lovely eyes, and kiss your lips now and then
<br />And I wished us back together as we should always be

<br />And after I made my wish I shut my eyes to cry
<br />And held my breath a minute and took a little sigh
<br />So listen to the call and understand my plea

<br />Wherever I may go,
<br />In case I need to cover up
<br />So the real me doesn't show.
<br />I'm so afraid to show you me,
<br />Afraid of what you'll do--that
<br /><br />You might laugh or say mean things.
<br />I'm afraid I might lose you.
<br /><br />I'd like to remove all my paint coats
<br />To show you the real, true me,
<br />But I want you to try and understand,
<br />I need you to accept what you see.
<br />So if you'll be patient and close your eyes,
<br />I'll strip off all my coats real slow.
<br />Please understand how much it hurts
<br />To let the real me show.
<br /><br />Now my coats are all stripped off.
<br />I feel naked, bare and cold,
<br />And if you still love me with all that you see,
<br />You are my friend, pure as gold.
<br /><br />I need to save my paint brush, though,
<br />And hold it in my hand,
<br />I want to keep it handy

<br />A fruitless search for love that leads nowhere
<br />except a broken heart and poor choices
<br />I see why I love, but not why I love you
<br /><br />Torturing myself with a love that I cannot have
<br />Nor can you, but we do not stop.....why
<br />We are driven to be together which will never be
<br />Driven by this passion uncontrolled within us
<br /><br />I laugh at the times we have had on line
<br />Smile at the memories of our voices on the phone
<br />But my heart cries to be next to you
<br />Gazing into your eyes and feeling your touch
<br /><br />Oh my sweet, dear love, why did we meet
<br />The pleasures we share so quickly turn to pain
<br />The laughter fades to tears as I lie here alone
<br />Spinning my dreams of what can never be
<br /><br />We have touched one another as no one has
<br />Our souls were one, long before we met here
<br />Our voices are typed in unison on white
<br />my breath is your breath, your heartbeat mine
<br /><br />Is it our ties to others that make the love more real
<br />My vision is clouded between what I want, and what is
<br />When the fog lifts I know I will need strength
<br />For one of us must surely say goodbye, oh let it be me
<br /><br />I know I will love you always, as it has forever been
<br />This life we are in allows us to never meet
<br />Commitments made to others we cannot break
<br />But we know our souls will meet and touch again

<br /> every now and then. And I remember one night in particular when she had
<br /> made breakfast after a long, hard day at work.
<br /><br />On that evening so long ago, my mom placed a plate of eggs, sausage, and
<br /> extremely burned toast in front of my dad. I remember waiting to see if
<br /> anyone noticed! Yet all my dad did was reach for his toast, smile at my
<br /> mom, and ask me how my day was at school.
<br /><br />I don't remember what I told him that night, but I do remember watching
<br /> him smear butter and jelly on that toast and eat every bite! When I got
<br /> up from the table that evening, I remember hearing my mom apologize to my
<br /> dad for burning the toast. And I'll never forget what he said: &quot;Baby, I
<br /> love burned toast.&quot;
<br /><br />Later that night, I went to kiss Daddy good night and I asked him if he
<br /> really liked his toast burned. He wrapped me in his arms and said,
<br /> &quot;Debbie, your momma put in a hard day at work today and she's real tired.
<br /> And besides-a little burnt toast never hurt anyone!&quot;
<br /><br />In bed that night, I thought about that scene at dinner and the kindness
<br /> my daddy showed my mom. To this day, it's a cherished memory from my
<br /> childhood that I'll never forget. And it's one that came to mind just
<br /> recently when Jack and I sat down to eat dinner.
<br /><br />I had arrived home late as usual and decided we would have breakfast food
<br /> for dinner. Some things never change, I suppose!
<br /><br />To my amazement, I found the ingredients I needed, and quickly began to
<br /> cook eggs, turkey sausage, and buttered toast. Thinking I had things under
<br /> control, I glanced through the mail for the day. It was only a few minutes
<br /> later that I remembered that I had forgotten to take the toast out of
<br /> the oven!
<br /><br />Now, had it been any other day -- and had we had more than two pieces of
<br /> bread in the entire house -- I would have started all over; But it had
<br /> been one of those days and I had just used up the last two pieces of
<br /> bread. So burnt toast it was!
<br /><br />As I set the plate down in front of Jack, I waited for a comment about the
<br /> toast. But all I got was a &quot;Thank you!&quot; I watched as he ate bite by bite,
<br /> all the time waiting for some comment about the toast. But instead, all
<br /> Jack said was, &quot;Babe, this is great. Thanks for cooking tonight. I know
<br /> you had a hard day.&quot;
<br /><br />As I took a bite of my charred toast that night, I thought about my mom
<br /> and dad how burnt toast hadn't been a deal-breaker for them. And I quietly
<br /> thanked God for giving me a marriage where burnt toast wasn't a
<br /> deal-breaker either!
<br /><br />You know, life is full of imperfect things and imperfect people. I'm not
<br /> the best housekeeper or cook. And you might be surprised to find out that
<br /> Jack isn't the perfect husband! He likes to play his music too loud, he
<br /> will always find a way to avoid yard work, and he watches far too many
<br /> sports. Believe it or not, watching “Golf Academy” is not my idea of a
<br /> great night at home!
<br /><br />But somehow in the past 37 years Jack and I have learned to accept the
<br /> imperfections in each other. Over time, we have stopped trying to make
<br /> each other in our own mold and have learned to celebrate our differences.
<br /> You might say that we've learned to love each other for who we really are!
<br /><br />For example, I like to take my time, I'm a perfectionist, and I'm
<br /> even-tempered. I tend to work too much and sleep too little. Jack, on the
<br /> other hand, is disciplined, studious, an early riser, and is a marketer's
<br /> dream consumer. I count pennies and Jack could care less! Where he is
<br /> strong, I am weak, and vice versa.
<br /><br />And yet, at the same time, Jack and I must work every minute of every day
<br /> to make this thing called &quot;marriage&quot; work!
<br /><br />What I've learned over the years is that learning to accept each other's
<br /> faults - and choosing to celebrate each other's differences - is the one
<br /> of the most important keys to creating a healthy, growing, and lasting
<br /> marriage relationship.
<br /><br />And that's my prayer for you today. That you will learn to take the good,
<br /> the bad, and the ugly parts of your married life and lay them at the feet
<br /> of GOD. Because in the end, He's the only One who will be able to give you
<br /> a marriage where burnt toast isn't a deal-breaker!
<br /><br />&quot;Destiny is not a matter of chance; it is a matter of choice.  It is not  a thing to be waited, it is a thing to be achieved.&quot;

<br />She cooked for students &amp; teachers to support the family. 
<br /><br />There was this one day during elementary school where my mom came to 
<br />say hello to me. 
<br /><br />I was so embarrassed. 
<br /><br />How could she do this to me? 
<br />I ignored her, threw her a hateful look and ran out. 
<br />The next day at school one of my classmates said, &quot;EEEE, your mom 
<br />only 
<br />has one eye!&quot; 
<br /><br />I wanted to bury myself. 
<br />I also wanted my mom to just disappear. 
<br />I confronted her that day and said, &quot; If you're only gonna make 
<br />me a 
<br />laughing stock, why don't you just die?&quot; 
<br /><br />My mom did not respond... 
<br />I didn't even stop to think for a second about what I had said, because 
<br />I was full of anger. 
<br />I was oblivious to her feelings. 
<br /><br />I wanted out of that house, and have nothing to do with her. 
<br />So I studied real hard, got a chance to go abroad to study. 
<br />Then, I got married. 
<br />I bought a house of my own. 
<br />I had kids of my own. 
<br />I was happy with my life, my kids and the comforts, then one day; my 
<br />mother came to visit me. 
<br />She 
<br />hadn't seen me in years and she didn't even meet her 
<br />grandchildren. 
<br /><br />When she stood by the door, my children laughed at her, and I yelled at 
<br />her for coming over uninvited. 
<br />I screamed at her, &quot;How dare you come to my house and scare my 
<br />children!&quot; 
<br />GET OUT OF HERE! NOW!!!&quot; 
<br /><br />And to this, my mother quietly answered, &quot;Oh, I'm so sorry. I may 
<br />have 
<br />gotten the wrong address,&quot; 
<br />and she disappeared out of sight. 
<br />One day, a letter regarding a school reunion came to my house. 
<br /><br />So I lied to my wife that I was going on a business trip. 
<br />After the reunion, I went to the old shack just out of curiosity. 
<br /><br />My neighbors said that she died. 
<br />I did not shed a single tear. 
<br />They handed me a letter that she had wanted me to have. 
<br /><br />&quot;My dearest son, 
<br />I think of you all the time. I'm sorry that I came to your house and 
<br />scared your children. 
<br />I was so glad when I heard you were coming for the reunion. 
<br />But I may not be able to even get out of bed to see you. 
<br />I'm sorry that I was a constant embarrassment to you when you were 
<br />growing up. 
<br /><br />You see.........when you were very little, you got into an accident, and 
<br />lost your eye. 
<br />As a mother, I couldn't stand watching you 
<br />having to grow up with one eye. 
<br />So I gave you mine. 
<br />I was so proud of my son who was seeing a whole new world for me, in my 
<br />place, with that eye. 
<br /><br />With all my love to you, 
<br />your mother. 
<br /><br />Always tell someone that you love them because you never know what day 
<br />will be their last, or your own. 
<br /><br />Always seek to resolve your problems or disagreements with loved ones 
<br />because if either of you should pass on before, the one who is left alive 
<br />will have the rest of their life to ponder those unresolved feelings but 
<br />will never find closure. And closure usually brings 
<br />peace...

<br /><br />We spend more, but have less, we buy more, but enjoy less. 
<br /><br />We have bigger houses and smaller families, more conveniences, but less time. 
<br /><br />We have more degrees but less sense, more knowledge, but less judgment, 
<br /><br />more experts, yet more problems, more medicine, but less wellness. 
<br /><br />We drink too much, smoke too much, spend too recklessly, laugh too little, drive too fast, get  too angry, stay up too late, get up too tired, read too little, watch TV too much, and pray too seldom. 
<br /><br />We have multiplied our possessions, but reduced our values. 
<br /><br />We talk too much, love too seldom, and hate too often. 
<br /><br />We've learned how to make a living, but not a life. 
<br /><br />We've added years to life not life to years. 
<br /><br />We've been all the way to the moon and back, but have trouble crossing the street to meet a new neighbour. 
<br /><br />We conquered outer space but not inner space. 
<br /><br />We've done larger things, but not better things. 
<br /><br />We've cleaned up the air, but polluted the soul. 
<br /><br />We've conquered the atom, but not our prejudice. 
<br /><br />We write more, but learn less. 
<br /><br />We plan more, but accomplish less. 
<br /><br />We've learned to rush, but not to wait. 
<br /><br />We build more computers to hold more information, to produce more copies than ever, but we communicate less and less. 
<br /><br />These are the times of fast foods and slow digestion, big men and small character, steep  profits and shallow relationships. 
<br /><br />These are the days of two incomes but more divorce, fancier houses, but broken homes. 
<br /><br />These are days of quick trips, disposable diapers, throwaway morality, one night stands, overweight bodies, and pills that do everything from cheer, to quiet, to kill. 
<br /><br />It is a time when there is much in the showroom window and nothing in the stockroom. 
<br /><br />A time when technology can bring this letter to you, and a time when you can  choose either to share this insight, or to just hit delete. 
<br /><br />Remember, spend some time with your loved ones, because they are not going to be around forever. 
<br /><br />Remember, say a kind word to someone who looks up to you in awe, because that little person soon will grow up and leave your side. 
<br /><br />Remember, to give a warm hug to the one next to you, because that is the only treasure you can give with your heart and it doesn't cost a cent. 
<br /><br />Remember, to say, &quot;I love you&quot; to your partner and your loved ones, but most of all mean it. A kiss and an embrace will mend hurt when it comes from deep inside of you. 
<br /><br />Remember to hold hands and cherish the moment for someday that person will not be there again. 
<br /><br />Give time to love, give time to speak, and give time to share the precious thoughts in your mind. 
<br /><br />AND ALWAYS REMEMBER: 
<br /><br />Life is not measured by the number of breaths we take, but by the moments that take our breath away…….. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/angel.gif" alt=":)" />

My relationships did not turn out the way most will expect. It could be that my lifestyle is not built to have a lifelong relationship. Then people will ask if I am happy. I would ask back, are they happy? It's just the way it is. Most will find happiness in having a family. Some will find being miserable is part of being happy. But what everyone seems to forget is happiness is just a state of mind. You do not need someone else to be happy. You just become happy. That's just it - desire to be happy and BE HAPPY. Don't mind me... It's just the way it is supposed to be. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/wink.gif" alt=":)" />

A letter that will always tell me of the do’s and dont’s in life. Yet my life is as broad as the universe..It has been magical yet tragic, as well..It is dramatic and comical but wonderful indeed. It is sometimes half full and sometimes half empty. My life is fluctuating and is way similar to the one who controls it..Unpredictable..I had the best of both worlds..And as i paint my life in its best and worst, i know I’m not even in the middle of my journey. People come and go. Friends aren’t permanent. lovers don’t stay for long. They leave physically yet they own places in my heart. I tend to become bitter at first but sooner I realize, that is life..And I can’t make them stay with me forever. Maybe I just learned what ACCEPTANCE is all about..to do what is best even if it’s against your will..I just make the most out of it while they are with me because you may never know when they will go. So I walk continuously, run if there’s a need to go extra mile, fly even if I know it’s not yet the time to. But I often crawl. I crawl way back to LOVE; way back to my dreams and delightful imaginations; way back to my families; way back to GOD, to myself, to my FOCUS. History repeats itself and every scene of my life is totally unique in its own way. Yet they have one storyline, lesson and struggle for HAPPINESS and CONTENTMENT..I haven’t found it yet but my boat never sinks and it will never loose its direction towards it.. I know i”ll be there with my family someday.. And as I go day and night without knowing which one the moon or the sun is, I sing my heart out-loud in search for that one place that offers nothing but PEACE and SERENITY that my soul is all wishing for..
<br /><br />I’ve made a large portion of my major life decisions by flipping a coin. I believe in chance, coincidence, chaos, and contradiction.
