<br /><br />happiness from her love to you
<br /><br />coz you love each oder through and through

<br /><br />When my eyes first gazed apon ur lovely smile
<br /><br />I hesitated with fright but only for a while
<br /><br />I thought time stopped and I could touch ur face
<br /><br />My heart started pounding like my drums bass
<br /><br />It was a beautiful night
<br /><br />With you bathing in wonderous star light
<br /><br />And when you turned swinging your silky red hair
<br /><br />again I fell in a trance and started to stair
<br /><br />and then I caught a glimps of ur shining eyes
<br /><br />a beautiful blue to which the see will arise
<br /><br />and then I got a sensation from deep inside
<br /><br />it felt so pleasant like a carnival ride
<br /><br />then I knew what it was it was beautiful love
<br /><br />I felt light as a feather and as soft as a dove
<br /><br />And when I was certain you felt it to

<br /><br />I hope my friendship makes you glad
<br /><br />4 u to cry my shoulder I lend

<br /><br />So don't change to try and make it
<br /><br />Accept the fault keep it lit
<br /><br />Sacrifice some to stay above
<br /><br />Sacrifice some but not to much
<br /><br />Or you will lose urself in such
<br /><br />In such a way u will never find
<br /><br />Find urself, u'll just lose ur mind
<br /><br />So give a little but not a lot
<br /><br />And show them they're all you got
<br /><br />And they will do so in return
<br /><br />Ur sacrifices will be given a prise
<br /><br />Given the prize of that which you yearn
<br /><br />Happiness to let you rise
<br /><br />Rise above sorrow and hate
<br /><br />Stay together reclaim ur fate
<br /><br />4u peace and love might sound nice
<br /><br />but there is only peace in sacrifice
<br /><br />I hate the way you treat me
<br /><br />U lie and then deceit me
<br /><br />I always trust in all ur lies
<br /><br />Which sadly is what I most despise
<br /><br />U tell me wat you would have done
<br /><br />But have not done since it begun
<br /><br />U lie and lie and lie and lie
<br /><br />And all I ever do is try
<br /><br />But you wont even try a bit
<br /><br />I give all and u give zit
<br /><br />I feel my efforts are all in vain
<br /><br />I give my love and u give me pain
<br /><br />U say ur life is full of hurt 
<br /><br />But that's coz u treat all like dirt 
<br /><br />But enough is enough I wont play your game
<br /><br />Ur life is shit and only ur to blame
<br /><br />Let me no if ur willing to try
<br /><br />I'll pick u up, help u get by
<br /><br />Then there will be nothing left to blame
<br /><br />and You can stop causing others pain
<br /><br />I usually wait till we're both ready
<br /><br />Ready for us to start going steady
<br /><br />But with you, I seem to want to go fast
<br /><br />And I want this relationship of ours to last
<br /><br />I really like you but I don't know why
<br /><br />When I'm not with you I feel like a lie
<br /><br />Only once I've seen you, so how can this be
<br /><br />Coz that one time I was filled with blissful glee
<br /><br />A blissful glee I've yet 2discover
<br /><br />A bliss full glee unlike any other
<br /><br />But my life isn't filled with fabulous fame
<br /><br />But is actually filled with a lot of pain
<br /><br />Coz i am constantly being hurt
<br /><br />By shouts and lies and painful flurt
<br /><br />I've been put down, felt like dirt, but not by you
<br /><br />No, your smile makes you look so pure and true
<br /><br />I feel I have known you for all years be done
<br /><br />And I hope i'll know you for all years to come
<br /><br />I dream of you night and day
<br /><br />By my side I wish you stay
<br /><br />A love like yours I have yet 2feel
<br /><br />A smile so caring it must be real
<br /><br />You make me feel like I have meaning
<br /><br />Like a purpose for my being
<br /><br />2protect you, 2love you
<br /><br />2care for you, 2hold you
<br /><br />I wish you knew the way I felt
<br /><br />Ur eyes so stunning I could melt
<br /><br />I fell in love the day we met
<br /><br />A path in life I wont regret
<br /><br />I haven't felt this way before
<br /><br />It feels so good I just want more
<br /><br />Together for ever I hope we'll be
<br /><br />There is a lock on my heart and you got the key
<br /><br />The day we met I never knew your name,
<br /><br />But I already knew you'd drive me insane,
<br /><br />Insane with passion, a burning desire,
<br /><br />Not even the ocean could put out this fire,
<br /><br />I danced with you, we sat by fire light,
<br /><br />I looked at you and thought what a sight,
<br /><br />You looked gorgeous and for that night you were mine,
<br /><br />I had to find a way to increase the time,
<br /><br />I could not leave you, not so soon,
<br /><br />I had to stay till the end of the moon,
<br /><br />Then you came to lie by my side,
<br /><br />You told me all you had to hide,
<br /><br />You lay with me till you went to bed,
<br /><br />I thought about what you had said,
<br /><br />And then I knew what I had to do,
<br /><br />I had to let you know I liked you,
<br /><br />Then the next day you came again to lie,
<br /><br />Then I told you I like you, that are no lie,
<br /><br />It was so sad when I had to leave,
<br /><br />Luckily your number I did receive!
<br /><br />Life is love there4 U must
<br /><br />Love in order to live!!!
<br /><br />Loving in order to live is 
<br /><br />The life of depression!
<br /><br />But living in order to live is 
<br /><br />Life's greatest ecstasy. 
<br /><br />To ignore things doesn't change them! But to talk about them makes it better! Because sometimes all that people need is a hand to hold and a heart to understand!

<br /><br />&quot;and each man kills the thing he loves,
<br />By each let this be heard,
<br />Some do it with a bitter look,
<br />Some with a flattering word,
<br />The coward does it with a kiss,
<br />The brave man with a sword!&quot;
<br /><br />Today I finally understood now what is meant by it, a coward (emotionally weak person) does it with a kiss...he says stuff like&quot; its not permanent&quot; or &quot;we can still be friends&quot;...something to give hope, a false hope that will bring the other person nothing but pain and he/she will not be able to accept the fact that its over....but at least its easier for the &quot;coward&quot;!
<br /><br />The brave man (emotionally strong person) would just completely piss the other person off, saying things that will make him/her feel like the &quot;brave man&quot; is not worth their time or tears, so the other person will get over the &quot;brave man&quot; easily...however this is a very difficult and painful task for the &quot;brave man&quot;, but because of his strength, he has killed that which he loves...painlessly!

Who would go out of their way to help someone you will never meet, knowing you'll get nothing in return for all your hard work? Who believes in changing the world for the better? Who today has respect for other people, or even themselves? Who of you guys treat girls like gentlemen...with respect, care and selflessness'? Who of you girls respect yourselves enough to say &quot;no&quot;, to make guys work for what they want and not just act like a sex-toy? Who has the pride to stand up for what they believe in and not be influenced by everyone else? Who is brave enough to say &quot;I'm different&quot; and stick to what they believe is right, not what everybody else is doing or telling them to do? Do we all need to be controlled by the media? Wear what they say is cool, talk about what they say we must talk about, listen to hat they say we must listen to, believe what they say we must believe? Do we all have to be the same to fit in? If we don't like the new 50cent song are we automatically not &quot;cool&quot;? 80years ago women blead for there rights, now they are shown as sex-toys, items to be screwed and then thrown away? And what scares me the most about that is...now girls act that way! They let guys walk all over them, do what they want to them...just because that's what our &quot;role models&quot; are doing! Like jack Johnson says &quot;where did all the good people go?&quot; We are fucking up our world, we are fucking up each other and we are fucking up ourselves! We NEED to start respecting ourselves and each other! We need a big fucking wake up call!...

<br /><br />Everyone wants to enjoy a healthy level of self-esteem. But few seem to know how to achieve it.
<br /><br />The popular psychology of Western culture has firmly established a connection between happiness and self-esteem.
<br />Certainly few would deny the importance of self-worth to a healthy outlook. But can social programs promising to enhance self-esteem unwittingly produce selfish, dissatisfied people with an unrealistic view of themselves and the world they live in? Without a clear understanding of the source of healthy self-esteem, how can we be sure that well-intended efforts aren’t instead leading, as some charge, to a generation of self-absorbed social misfits?
<br />A close look at the subject reveals both a reliable path to proper self-esteem and a key to sustainable happiness. The two are clearly connected, though not in the way many sociologists and educators seem to think.
<br />THE FEEL-GOOD FACTOR
<br />Self-esteem has many definitions, but all address aspects of how we view and value ourselves. They range from simply “feeling good about yourself” to more detailed descriptions such as “actualizing one’s own attributes, having one’s accomplishments validated by others, and being able to compare oneself to others favorably.”
<br />Regardless of its definition, self-esteem is a fundamental component of who we are as individuals, and that affects who we are collectively as a society. Much unhappiness in the form of social ills such as crime, poverty and addiction has been attributed to low self-esteem.
<br />Society’s solution has been to offer programs to raise self-esteem. Early childhood development specialists place heavy emphasis on the importance of nurturing a positive self-image at a young age. They, and indeed most parents, recognize children’s need for a favorable sense of self-worth to establish a good social foundation and to connect with the world around them.
<br />This deep-seated emotional need is not limited to children, and it is not inherently bad. Certainly an optimistic view of ourselves enables us to contribute to the world around us. An influential number of educators, however, have come to accept that if students can simply be made to feel good about themselves, then success in school and beyond will automatically follow.
<br />Educators often pursue this objective through programs of self-affirmation. Such efforts have prompted lively debate within the educational community. Many fear that feelings have been given greater weight than competence and character. Experts in the field maintain that excessive promotion of self-esteem can create selfish, unfulfilled people with a distorted self-image. If the self is allowed to become the overriding focus of our lives in a misguided pursuit of self-esteem, the results, say an increasing number of experts, can be disastrous.
<br />Indeed, the breadth of greedy, egocentric, careless behavior observable in our communities appears to confirm that the current emphasis on feeling good is ill-advised.
<br />THE HALLOWED SELF
<br />Contemporary views of self-esteem stem directly from the history of Western philosophical thought. More specifically, they are a logical outgrowth of individualism, which has largely coincided with secularization.
<br />In analyzing the secularizing of Western society in a recent newspaper editorial, political writer Milton Viorst observed, “The seminal notion that the Renaissance introduced to the West was that mankind, not God, is at the hub of the social universe. It held reason as important as faith, and urged men and women to claim responsibility, free of clergy, for their own lives.” Viorst continued, “The ideas led, over quarrelsome centuries, to the Reformation, the Enlightenment and the scientific revolution.”
<br />This emphasis on reason or rationalism has been a driving force in the evolution of individualism. Sociologist Emile Durkheim noted more than 100 years ago that “the development of rationalism does not come about without a parallel development of individualism.” That we have arrived at a point in Western culture where the self is paramount should not be surprising; individualism has enjoyed a lengthy period of incubation.
<br />While thinking for oneself can obviously represent a healthy form of individualism, enshrining the self has served overall to degrade societal standards and sanctions. The modern world’s inward focus promotes self-tolerance, entitlement, victimhood and narcissism. Each of these lenses obstructs our vision of right self-esteem and its foundation.
<br />JUST AS I AM
<br />Tolerance is a critical social lubricant in our diverse society. However, in their haste to promote a virtue, many have misapplied the concept and fallen into the trap of accepting themselves nonjudgmentally: “I must be accepted for who and what I am, regardless of who and what I am.”
<br />Maureen Stout, who holds a doctorate in the philosophy of education, finds that “the current definition of self-esteem used by educators and psychologists seems to be . . . feeling good about oneself irrespective of individual or social attributes or characteristics” (The Feel Good Curriculum, 2000). In other words, we may choose to bolster our self-worth by refusing to judge ourselves by external standards. In this way the positive characteristics of tolerance (patience, kindness and respect) are transformed into permissive attitudes that allow negative character traits to remain unchallenged.
<br />Accepting ourselves without regard to external criteria is a dangerous aspect of false self-esteem. This approach broadly misconstrues tolerance by specifically rejecting any objective measure by which a meaningful self-evaluation can be undertaken. Self-esteem and absolute standards are not comfortable bedfellows.
<br />ENTITLEMENT MENTALITY
<br />If we learn to tolerate our errors and personal flaws, then we come to accept ourselves as somehow basically okay. Thus we can feel justified in asserting ourselves, defending our perceived rights, and claiming our self-determined fair share. This attitude can quickly deteriorate into the assumption that the world owes us something. Entitlement is the feeling that we deserve something, whatever it may be, regardless of what we may or may not have done to earn it.
<br />This destructive attitude often develops early in childhood. According to psychologist Lynne Namka, “some children feel owed or entitled to get their way. While it is normal for a child to ask for what he wants, some children are overly demanding and needy. They have not learned to balance taking from others with giving; they view other people as existing merely to give to them.”
<br />Namka adds that a child’s selfish behavior, “if it is not checked or outgrown, . . . can become a lifelong pattern of getting everything for himself” (“‘You Owe Me!’: Children of Entitlement,” 1997). If unchecked in childhood, these attitudes intensify and may be manifested in behaviors such as road rage, students demanding better grades than they earn, or corporate executives awarding themselves exorbitant salaries. Attitudes of entitlement have the unfortunate consequence of divorcing both character and behavior from how we value ourselves.
<br />A SOCIETY OF VICTIMS
<br />Because they may imply that self-esteem is a fundamental right, self-tolerance and a sense of entitlement produce another psychological malady that is increasingly present in our culture: victimhood—placing the blame for personal inadequacies elsewhere.
<br />The growing tendency among many psychologists and medical practitioners is to classify all manner of behavioral problems as diseases. In this way bad behavior can be neatly isolated, clinically named, and subsequently treated with drugs and/or counseling. Thus an individual is unfettered by accountability for his or her actions. This trend mirrors a broad shift in cultural values from self-control to self-indulgence.
<br />Some have suggested that children are being overdiagnosed with such diseases as Attention Deficit Disorder in order to separate responsibility from behavior. Psychologist Ofer Zur pinpoints the broader effects of the poor-behavior-as-disease model of life when he writes, “Psychotherapy sees many normal life events as trauma in need of healing rather than as enriching experiences. This has political consequences. Individuals are freed from moral responsibility for what they do or what happened to them and therefore are no longer citizens, but patients or victims” (“Psychology of Victimhood,” 2003).
<br />Once victimhood is enshrined, offensive behavior is increasingly blamed on childhood abuses. Criminals are transformed into the blameless. Of course, there are innumerable cases of genuine psychological trauma and unimaginably scarring cruelty. But problems are frequently misdiagnosed as self-esteem issues, and the symptom rather than the cause receives treatment. Zur comments that victimhood is “often claimed by the privileged middle class and the wealthy of our society. The victim’s stance of ‘Don’t blame me!’ is often accompanied with ‘I deserve this, this and this!’ The ‘rights industry’ or the ‘rights movement’ goes hand in hand with the victim industry.”
<br />I LOVE ME
<br />An increasing emphasis on individualism illustrates the elevated position the self holds in Western culture. This prominence is often referred to as narcissism—the obsessive love of self. With the self-esteem movement embedded in child development programs, young adults are now encouraged to develop image rather than character.
<br />Lilian G. Katz of the University of Illinois Early Childhood and Parenting Collaborative warns that school self-esteem programs promote schemes that, while they “are intended to help children achieve and maintain high self-esteem [they] may inadvertently cultivate narcissism.” She cites other researchers who claim “that when success is more important than self-respect, the culture itself overvalues image and is narcissistic, and further that narcissism denotes a degree of unreality in individuals and the culture” (“Distinctions Between Self-Esteem and Narcissism,” 1993).
<br />The most worrying aspect of narcissism is the profound disconnection from reality. It promotes extreme responses to needs and desires that are perfectly normal. Katz explains that narcissists are “sometimes described as exhibitionistic, requiring constant attention and admiration, often believing that they are entitled to special favors without the need to reciprocate.” Such people “tend to exploit others, to be seekers of sensations, experiences, and thrills, and to be highly susceptible to boredom. Many of these characteristics of narcissism seem to apply to our culture in general and to many of our youth in particular.” She adds that “adults diagnosed as suffering from the narcissism syndrome often complain that their lives are empty or meaningless, and they often show insensitivity to the needs of others.”
<br />When the self becomes the center of the individual’s universe, disconnection from other people also occurs. The feelings and needs of others take a distant second place, and personal identity is sought within narrow groups that validate self-centered views. In this way, the world is viewed from an emotional rather than a rational perspective; personal feelings override distinctions between right and wrong.
<br />Pursuing self-esteem via self-centered activities is a vicious cycle, however. Self-love is ultimately unfulfilling. Dissatisfied, the narcissist seeks opportunities to feel good through more self-centered activities. But self-serving pursuits do not create self-esteem. In fact, they often have just the opposite effect: low self-esteem and a sense of worthlessness that can end in tragedy.
<br />A respected authority on child development, William Damon, asserts firmly that “one cannot ‘find’ self-esteem in isolation from one’s relations to others because it does not exist apart from those relations” (Greater Expectations, 1995). When we attempt to place a value on ourselves and ignore the value of other people, we lose sight of where true self-esteem originates.
<br />A DIFFERENT KIND OF LOVE
<br />As society has become increasingly absorbed with the pursuit of individualism, it has lost sight of an important dimension of self-esteem: a standard by which to evaluate the self and its relationships with others. While many people have come to view self-love as the basis of self-worth, true and sustainable self-esteem comes from a different source.
<br />In an interview with Vision (see “Hands-On Parenting”) Damon noted that “self-esteem is a perfectly good thing for people to have, but it should be the result of good behavior. In other words, you should feel good about yourself because you’ve done something right. . . . We want to promote self-esteem that comes from achievement and from service to others.” That clearly represents a very different kind of love.
<br />There are two basic types of love. The first, self-love, may be expressed in a variety of beguiling forms, but at its foundation it is always self-centered. It exists on the edge of dysfunction, because it is motivated, first and foremost, by emotions and desires. It loves only because of the pleasure and satisfaction it hopes to gain.
<br />The second type is far more rare: outgoing love. It is based on true concern for the well-being of others and subordinates the inwardly directed desires of the self. This love is the core of healthy self-esteem.
<br />Some might be surprised that the Bible not only defines outgoing love, it also shows it to be a prerequisite of both self-esteem and happiness. The desire to feel good about ourselves has prompted many to throw off any uncomfortable constraints on human behavior. But as hard as it is to accept in today’s environment, happiness and well-being are dependent on constraints. And the constraints given in the Bible are designed to focus our attention away from individual desires and toward the needs of others. These principles have been established as the bedrock of civilization for millennia because they prompt behavior that is helpful both within and between individuals. The clear standard—like a guardrail along a treacherous road—is known as the law of God.
<br />Jesus summarized the law by stating, “The first of all the commandments is . . . ‘you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, and with all your strength.’ This is the first commandment. And the second, like it, is this: ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself. There is no other commandment greater than these” (Mark 12:29–31). Clearly both love toward God and love toward fellow man are outgoing. They produce actions and attitudes that promote the happiness of others ahead  of personal happiness.
<br />In writing to the early Christians in Rome, the apostle Paul made this observation regarding the second great commandment: “Owe no one anything except to love one another, for he who loves another has fulfilled the law. For the commandments, ‘You shall not commit adultery,’ ‘You shall not murder,’ ‘You shall not steal,’ ‘You shall not bear false witness,’ ‘You shall not covet,’ and if there is any other commandment, are all summed up in this saying, namely, ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’ Love does no harm to a neighbor; therefore love is the fulfillment of the law ” (Romans 13:8–10, emphasis added).
<br />What a paradox! Love and obedience to God’s law are one and the same! The apostle John summed it up this way. “For this is the love of God, that we keep His commandments” (1 John 5:3).
<br />The modern self-esteem movement fails because it rejects God’s law as the basis of love. Yet as we do those things that fulfill love toward other people, we begin to experience feelings of true self-worth. Obedience to God’s law—the expression of outgoing concern—produces well-being and contentment coupled with a positive self-image. The resulting sense of happiness cannot exist in the individual who is drawn into the lonely vacuum of self-interest.
<br />Is your life empty and unfulfilled? Perhaps some time spent exploring and practicing commandment-based love will help fill the emotional tank.

<br /><br />Shakespeare knew all about the guilty conscience. His depiction of Richard III had the king troubled enough to say, “My conscience hath a thousand several tongues, and every tongue brings in a several tale, and every tale condemns me for a villain.”
<br />Feeling guilty about something in life is not new to any of us. Guilt comes in many forms and shapes. It can be caused by anything from a small incidence of forgetfulness to a massive act of malice. Whatever the offense, a sense of guilt is usually the result of falling short of some accepted standard. Author and psychiatrist Willard Gaylin notes that guilt is “often related as being contaminated, fouled, marked, soiled, or . . . stained.”
<br />The American Heritage Dictionary defines guilt as “remorseful awareness of having done something wrong” or “self-reproach for supposed inadequacy or wrongdoing.” But guilt is “not simply self-reproach: it is inseparable from awareness of the harm, or neglect, brought about to the others affected by one’s action or inaction” (Oxford Companion to Philosophy ).
<br />Of course, guilt is much more than just an intellectual exercise. When we feel guilty, it isn’t simply an academic matter; it’s how we actually feel. When we feel pain, it helps us identify areas of the body where something is physically wrong. Having a guilty conscience is like a pain in the mind. Could we then use the feeling of guilt to diagnose problems of the heart and mind? Could we use it as a prompt to change whatever is causing mental or emotional discomfort? Perhaps a guilty conscience could help move us away from hurtful behavior.
<br />The guilty conscience identifies defects in our character. The problem, therefore, is not the guilty conscience; it’s what it represents at a deeper level. For instance, if we feel guilty for misrepresenting our tax liability on our income tax returns, feeling guilty is not the problem. The problem lies in our inability to tell the truth.
<br />So when we confront ourselves with something that hurts our conscience, we have a choice. We can either recognize that behavioral change is essential, or, as happens more commonly, we can rationalize our wrong actions.
<br />But it’s in the erasing of the sense of guilt that another problem sometimes arises. According to the Gale Encyclopedia of Psychology, a person can convince him- or herself that a given act did not violate any standard of what is right, or the person can reason that he or she has no control over the events of life and is therefore not responsible for the outcome. The article goes on to point out, “With no sense of personal responsibility, there can be no sense of guilt. When guilt is reduced, internal limits on behavior disappear and people can act without remorse.” In other words, the conscience can be deactivated.
<br />For that reason, some of the most heinous crimes imaginable have been carried out by men who felt no remorse for their evil. Think about Hitler’s or Stalin’s actions during the Second World War. There is absolutely no evidence that they ever felt any sorrow or self-doubt about killing millions of innocent men, women and children.
<br />It’s clear, however, that the conscience operates differently in different people. While some people seem never to suffer pangs of guilt, others can surprise us with an apology for something that we didn’t even perceive as an offense but that carried great weight in their mind and conscience.
<br />What’s important is that, while a guilty conscience can be turned off, it can also be used to make a change that benefits the individual. When guilt is turned off, humans are capable of committing appalling evil; and, on the other hand, when it is used constructively, positive change occurs. It’s when we are remorseful about falling short of standards that we optimize our chances for making beneficial changes in our lives. On an emotional level, remorse can lead to new attitudes and renewed commitment to elevate one’s behavior and habits to a higher standard.
<br />ONE STEP AT A TIME
<br />The process that leads from guilt to change can be broken into three essential steps.
<br />The first step is accepting that we have fallen short of personal or social standards, which involves recognition of the problem on an intellectual level. This may not be as easy as it sounds, simply because we may not always realize that we have erred. Our mistakes and shortcomings can be cloaked in subtleties so that we cannot recognize them as wrong. We may even lack a sensitive conscience on an issue, or we may not be in tune with our own actions.
<br />By way of example, there’s the centuries-old story of a highly placed man who had an affair with a neighbor’s wife while her husband, a soldier, was away at war. The woman became pregnant. In order to cover up his part in the pregnancy, the man of influence brought her husband home on a short leave. He then used his power to have the soldier transferred to the battlefront in a different part of the country, where he was soon killed. The adulterer’s hope, of course, was that no one would be able to discover that the child was the result of his wrongdoing. Time passed, the newly widowed woman married the man, and the child was born. But there’s more to the story.
<br />When a friend discovered the truth of the matter, he had the difficult task of confronting the man. To his credit, the adulterer eventually admitted that he had erred in his thinking and behavior. For whatever reason, he hadn’t seen his relationship with the woman as a violation of standards, and so he did not at first see his actions as wrong. Perhaps he was too emotionally wrapped up in the relationship to think rationally. But once his shortcomings were pointed out to him, he was able to make progress by grasping, at the intellectual level, the magnitude of what he had done.
<br />But acceptance of wrongdoing is only the beginning. There is also an emotional element to real change. While we may recognize our faults and shortcomings intellectually, without an active conscience, we may not be remorseful. Of necessity, we should become emotionally moved about not living up to standards. There must be some anguish on our part about our failings in order for us to want to change. We have to want to have everything made right.
<br />When the man in our example realized what he had done, he was deeply distraught about it. He knew that his error had created a wall between himself and God. He was so distressed that he immediately started to pray for a solution to the separation he felt.
<br />Without the emotional element, the chance for a fresh start is diminished. But once we recognize our shortcomings and are remorseful, we can move on to the third step, which is based on volition. Now we have to act on what we know.
<br />The influential man in the example above was none other than ancient Israel’s King David. And according to the biblical record, David never again indulged in that kind of behavior.
<br />We may realize what our failings are and be emotionally overcome by them, but unless we, like King David, take action to actually change, we may find ourselves in an endless cycle of steps one and two. This can lead to some serious consequences. We could develop a conscience that says “What’s so bad about this?” or we could spiral down into depression. Whichever way we go, our conscience will become ineffective in helping us on the road to real change.
<br />A TURNING POINT
<br />The ancient Greeks referred to change as metamorphosis. The Roman poet Ovid described the process in detail, writing that only outside influence could produce permanent change in people and bring them from the normal state of human suffering to a higher level.
<br />Another writer who lived and worked in the Greek world and who understood the role of an outside force in change was the apostle Paul. In his letter to early Christians in the Greek-influenced culture of Rome, he used the Greek word metamorphoo when he spoke of behavioral transformation: “Don’t copy the behavior and customs of this world, but let God transform you into a new person by changing the way you think” (Romans 12:2, New Living Translation, emphasis added).
<br />Paul realized that lasting change was beyond the grasp of most people. He knew that unless we invite God into the process of transformation in our lives, meaningful change cannot happen. When viewed from a biblical perspective, short-term meaningful sorrow over our shortcomings and faults is good, but taking action and turning away from our errors—to go the opposite direction—is really what God expects of us. This is also known as repentance. True change can occur only if the process has a spiritual core.
<br />This is the kind of metamorphosis Paul said we could achieve with God’s help. First it involves intellectual acceptance of our faults and sins. Then comes grief over the consequences of our actions. The will to do something positive to change our ways comes next. Finally we need God’s forgiveness and His strengthening to overcome our weaknesses for good.

Yet according to Eleanor Roosevelt, they begin “in small places, close to home—so close and so small that they cannot be seen on any maps of the world.”
<br />She went on to say in her address at the 1948 UN Commission on Human Rights that “they are the world of the individual person; the neighborhood he lives in; the school or college he attends; the factory, farm, or office where he works. Such are the places where every man, woman, and child seeks equal justice, equal opportunity, equal dignity without discrimination. Unless these rights have meaning there, they have little meaning anywhere.”
<br />The UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights, now more than 50 years old, was not the first attempt to legislate human rights on an international scale. The post–World War I League of Nations Covenant required members to “endeavor to secure and maintain fair and humane conditions of labour for men, women, and children,” “secure just treatment of the native inhabitants of territories under their control,” and “take steps in matters of international concern for the prevention and control of disease.” Out of these provisions grew the work of the UN’s International Labor Organization.
<br />Since 1948, much has been said and written about human rights, and organizations such as Amnesty International have worked tirelessly to combat flagrant violations.
<br />Yet it never seems enough, and so the laws continue to roll out like ripples in a pond, ever wider in scope. The U.K. Human Rights Act, for instance, incorporated the 1950 European Convention on Human Rights into British law in late 2000. About a month later, the Charter of Fundamental Rights was adopted at the European Council in Nice. These complement the European Court of Justice and the European Court of Human Rights, the latter of which is based on the European Convention on Human Rights.
<br />Michael Whatley of Prettys Solicitors, a specialized British law firm, offered a broad view of human rights as determined by the U.K. Human Rights Act. “Human Rights,” he observed, “are often thought of as a narrow concept of individual rights, such as the right not to be discriminated against on grounds such as race or religion but . . . included within the Convention’s concept of Human Rights are social and economic rights. . . . The protections afforded by the Convention can apply to individuals, companies, non-governmental organisations and groups of individuals in both criminal and civil court cases.”
<br />RIGHT OR WRONG?
<br />Legally, rights have never been so extensively defined. For starters, there are the rights of ethnic minorities. Then we have the rights of women. The rights of children. The rights of homosexuals. The right to terminate an unwanted pregnancy or, depending on your viewpoint, the rights of the unborn. The right to claim compensation when your rights are violated. The rights of workers. The rights of consumers. The rights of the “unwaged.” The rights of single parents. The rights of companies and organizations. Even the rights of animals and, believe it or not, plants. It’s a list seemingly without end.
<br />The situations in the United States and the United Kingdom are parallel in many respects. American society has a reputation for being the most litigious in the world. Lawyers often offer “no win, no fee” inducements, so the attraction of a quick, opportunistic buck can be alluring to those who believe their rights have been trampled. Compensation demands are also increasing in Britain. In both countries, the growing likelihood of compensation claims has had the effect of pushing up employment costs such as insurance.
<br />Germany, too, is now plagued with what was once referred to as “the British disease.” Most companies must now have a workers’ council, and companies with more than 200 employees must release at least one employee from other duties to work full-time on the council. The larger the company, the larger the prescribed council. Such councils expect to take on an enhanced advisory role, covering anything from planned job cuts to the introduction of new technology. This is, of course, a financial and administrative burden to companies, and German employers now look enviously across the channel to Britain, where labor laws are not as restrictive and the economy is buoyant.
<br />The prosperous nations of the Western world have never been more focused on rights. Many people would therefore say we’ve come a long way since the UN’s Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
<br />But have we? Is this obsession with rights creating a better society? Surely a focus on rights should have made us all happier. But is society any better and are we any happier?
<br />WHO’S RIGHT ABOUT WHOSE RIGHTS?
<br />Certain concepts of human rights appear self-evident: the rights of people not to be tortured or abused, freedom of speech, freedom of worship, freedom of political association.
<br />But what happens when perceived rights conflict with one another?
<br />When Britain’s parliament earlier this year considered a bill to ban foxhunting as a cruel sport, for example, animal rights activists—never more vociferous—were jubilant. Some of them were overtly, unashamedly, physically violent toward those they saw as enemies and therefore fair targets, such as employees of medical research laboratories that experiment on animals.
<br />On the flip side of the coin were the country dwellers, who have for centuries taken their fox hunts for granted and who suddenly found themselves in a direct head-to-head with those who see animal rights as paramount.
<br />Animal rights campaigners make no secret of their next prime targets: hunting and fishing. Even one particularly British institution, the fish-and-chip shop, has come into the battle zone; one owner was recently lucky to escape severe injury from a letter bomb.
<br />Rights, then, are often in the eye of the beholder, with some of them clearly demonstrating a perplexing and perhaps even contradictory side.
<br />Sexual freedom is another area of ever unfolding and often conflicting rights. Britain recently passed legislation to lower the age of consent from 18 to 16 for an act still linguistically associated with the biblical city of Sodom. In some nations the age of consent is 12.
<br />Then there is the cherished right to adopt the lifestyle of one’s choice and to freely cohabit without a commitment to the formality of marriage.
<br />Even Britain’s once family-oriented Girl Guides Association, in a move to update itself, has shed practically any attempt to further traditional views on marriage. When the latest edition of Look Wider, a handbook for older Guides, featured a photograph of a grinning teenage girl holding up an unrolled condom, the message was clear. “Rather than offering a wholesome alternative to the interests that draw Guides away from the organisation in their early teens,” said an article in London’s Daily Telegraph, “Look Wider tries to appeal to those interests with references to, inter alia, sex, smoking and highly paid jobs. No way of life, however outlandish, can be criticised. All sorts of subjects are covered—teenage pregnancy, single-sex marriage, prostitution—but it is never said that there is anything wrong with these things. There is only one concrete warning in all 128 pages: ‘Hitch-hiking is not allowed.’”
<br />The article continued, “The desperate desire not to put Guides off means that the handbook fails to advocate anything of value that might demand any responsibility—such as, say, marriage. . . . The emphasis is switched from helping others to helping oneself” (“A Very Bad Guide,” December 16, 2000).
<br />Lamenting the decline of religious and social authority, religious journalist Clifford Longley commented in another Telegraph article on the complete lack of “any sense of foreboding that the marginalisation of the beliefs and traditions [the religious establishment] stood for was likely in the long run to do great damage” to modern society. “So now we make up our own rules,” he wrote. “It is such thinking that has undermined the confidence of modern parents, who have begun to doubt whether they have the right to pass on their values to their children” (“We Need More Belief—Not More Policemen,” December 27, 2000).
<br />EVER MORE CREATIVE
<br />Though it is probably over-quoted, there is no doubt that George Orwell’s book 1984 was in some ways prophetic. Take, for example, the recent attempt by the British government to turn children into model citizens with the help of a textbook featuring compulsory citizenship lessons. Government ministers presumably recognize and hope to arrest an increasingly lawless and violent undercurrent among young pupils.
<br />The text, How to Be a Good Citizen by American educator Francine Britton, states as its lofty objective the creation of a “spiritual, moral, social and cultural” renaissance and contains such New Age concepts as “honoring the spirit” and “the mystery of self.” Critics have noted an almost Orwellian tendency in the book, which many teachers see as a waste of valuable teaching time. The “no shame, no blame” culture, however, has to invent ever more creative terminology in order to instill in young minds what might remotely be recognized as ethics, morals or values.
<br />Yet we are religious creatures by nature. Karen Armstrong, journalist and writer on religion and belief, incisively commented in her History of God that “human beings are spiritual animals. Indeed, there is a case for arguing that Homo sapiens is also Homo religiosus.”
<br />So when we move away from familiar religious and traditional values, some of the politically correct initiatives attempting to deal with the moral vacuum take on a somewhat ludicrous hue as they try to instill values without mentioning such dreaded words as morals or responsibility, nor the even more embarrassing terms God and Christian principles.
<br />Replacing traditional values today we find such idealized concepts as personal freedom, individual choice, self-actualization, self-esteem and “the right to know.” Note that all of these focus on the individual, the self.
<br />An inevitable and worrisome result of those values and that kind of focus, of course, is that subjects that used to be off limits, such as a nation’s security secrets, are now open to disclosure, discussion and critique. That highly prized commodity, freedom, has thus moved to the point where one can exercise one’s perceived rights even if it puts national security at risk.
<br />We seem to have moved light years from a society where personal responsibility came first, to one where personal rights are the first and sometimes only consideration.
<br />THAT OTHER R
<br />So what about that other R, responsibility? Could it be that by privileging rights over responsibilities we have lost sight of a fundamental fact? Think about it: If we do not—as a society and as individuals—put responsibilities ahead of rights, then we will paradoxically begin to lose those rights that we hold to be inalienable.
<br />As laws, proclamations and politically correct pressure groups rain supposed rights on ever more narrowly defined and exclusive groups and causes, it is a sure sign that we are forgetting how the very freedoms we take for granted were preserved through the centuries; namely, by the responsibility and self-sacrifice of our predecessors.
<br />Nobody said it better, from a national perspective, than John F. Kennedy: “Ask not what your country can do for you—ask what you can do for your country.”
<br />Apart from a few brave and increasingly lonely voices, it appears that many of our religious and governmental institutions are abandoning—indeed sometimes uprooting—the moral underpinnings of society.
<br />Self-fulfillment and political correctness have replaced that deeper, lasting set of values that overarches and simultaneously underpins individual rights. The warning voices that do sound forth are usually not those of killjoys wanting to make life miserable for the sake of it, but rather those of astute individuals who foresee—and warn about—the damaging outcomes of our self-indulgence.
<br />Writer and philosopher Anthony O’Hear has demonstrated significant insight into where our pursuit of rights without corresponding responsibilities has taken us. “Could it be,” he asked in his 1999 book, After Progress, “that the type of material and political progress on which we pride ourselves is actually the cause of spiritual and aesthetic decline? . . . Could the root cause of our discontents be lack of inner resources, rather than higher expectations of life?” O’Hear puzzled that the nation that produced such great artists as Turner and Constable should now put animal corpses and images of human excrement on display as art.
<br />He reflected on “the obsessive harping on happiness in a material sense, which makes our life today so mediocre in so many ways, which forgets that what is really worthwhile can be achieved only through struggle and suffering, that there are aims in life higher than the elimination of pain and the cultivation of pleasure.”
<br />Other voices have also lamented the corrosive effect of this blinkered focus on rights alone. W.A. Borst, for instance, author of Liberalism: Fatal Consequences, wrote of the United States: “A nation which had set up a near-perfect and flexible government is now finding common sense more endangered than the snail darter. Lawyers have hamstrung society with nit-picking minutiae. . . . This lack of common sense has led inevitably to a rights revolution, where only selfishness and personal interest seem to reign supreme.”
<br />Consider, by way of illustrating the point, that hate-object of political correctness: the beleaguered, conventional two-parent family. Is diligently pursuing irresponsible fathers, also known as deadbeat dads, really as good as teaching the spiritual, moral and social responsibilities of fatherhood? Does providing state financial support for unmarried mothers really match teaching girls that waiting until marriage for sex and children is still by far their (and their offspring’s) best chance for security and happiness? Why won’t governments and churches preach that message when the miserable results of the alternatives are as plain as a pikestaff?
<br />THE SAME OLD LESSONS
<br />The liberalization, trivialization and mockery of institutions that have been the bedrock of ascendancy and greatness are, like a cancer, eating away everywhere. Take the institutions of America and Britain as an example. Peter Hitchens, British journalist and social critic, wrote in his 1999 book, The Abolition of Britain: “A forest [i.e., the British Constitution] that has taken centuries to grow can be cut down in weeks, or even hours, especially if the foresters have grown indolent and slack, and take their charge for granted. . . . When the British tradition was suddenly threatened by attractive-seeming ideas, innovations and philosophies, there was no one left to fight for the old order. When affluence encouraged individual independence and weakened the sense of mutual obligation, all classes began to forget the ties that had bound them together. . . . So we allowed our patriotism to be turned into a joke, wise sexual restraint to be mocked as prudery, our families to be defamed as nests of violence, loathing and abuse, our literature to be tossed aside like so much garbage, and our church turned into a department of the Social Security system.”
<br />Philosopher George Santayana’s warning that “those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it” certainly applies here.
<br />Many American and British legal and constitutional concepts are based on, or owe an immense debt to, our Judeo-Christian heritage. Therefore, while that heritage has arguably suffered from faulty transmission over the centuries, our laws and concepts of truth and morality owe their ultimate authority to the underlying concepts contained in Scripture—the Holy Bible.
<br />The God of the Bible made very clear what would ultimately make or break a nation. To the nation that would base its constitution on His laws and providence, He said: “I will give peace in the land, and you shall lie down, and none will make you afraid; I will rid the land of evil beasts, and the sword will not go through your land. You will chase your enemies, and they shall fall by the sword before you. Five of you shall chase a hundred, and a hundred of you shall put ten thousand to flight; your enemies shall fall by the sword before you. For I will look on you favorably and make you fruitful, multiply you and confirm My covenant with you” (Leviticus 26:6–9).
<br />God gave a foundation to the children of Israel, His prototype nation, millennia ago. It worked for them, and it has worked for others to the degree to which it has been applied. “Therefore be careful to observe [God’s laws and statutes]; for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the peoples who will hear all these statutes, and say, ‘Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people.’ For what great nation is there that has God so near to it, as the Lord our God is to us, for whatever reason we may call upon Him? And what great nation is there that has such statutes and righteous judgments as are in all this law which I set before you this day?” (Deuteronomy 4:6–8).
<br />RIGHTS OR BLESSINGS?
<br />Interestingly, God never promised rights. He promised blessings, and that is the critical difference. A self-sacrificing individual who serves his or her society, a people that truly looks to God, doesn’t need to be and indeed isn’t focused on rights. Such people are focused on other people and on God, and on their responsibilities to both.
<br />This is the lesson of social responsibility: “For the commandments, ‘You shall not commit adultery,’ ‘You shall not murder,’ ‘You shall not steal,’ ‘You shall not bear false witness,’ ‘You shall not covet,’ and if there is any other commandment, are all summed up in this saying, namely, ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself’” (Romans 13:9).
<br />Our narrow and selfish preoccupation with our rights threatens to engulf and destroy us. It is not until we begin again, as individuals and as nations, to look outside ourselves to our religious, moral and social responsibilities —to other human beings and to God—that we will reverse national, social and spiritual decline.

<br />A few years ago the London Sunday Times ran an article with the title “Whatever Happened to Real Leaders?” It read in part: “The foreign secretary was a stuffed shirt. But the prime minister was not even that: ‘he was just a hole in the air.’ The words are George Orwell's, applied to Lord Halifax and Stanley Baldwin, in the late 1930s. What resonance they have today!. . . What the country needs is leadership, and this is true of the Western world as a whole.”
<br />The article continued, “The gap between the desirable and the real has never been as great in this respect. As you open the newspapers or watch the television news, is there a single political leader in the West whose words you would expect to remember? Would you expect to learn anything from them? Do you expect them to do anything inspiring or creative, or even just the right thing? We have reached a real low point in leadership, lower than at any other time in recent history. . . . ‘I sowed dragons, and I reaped fleas,’ said Nietzsche.” It's a powerful plea for the kind of leadership that can deliver humanity from the grip of its many problems and evils.
<br />Late American newspaper commentator Walter Lippmann, in his syndicated column Today and Tomorrow, defined leaders as “the custodians of a nation's ideals, of the beliefs it cherishes, of its permanent hopes, of the faith which makes a nation out of a mere aggregation of individuals.”
<br />Custodian. The word means a keeper, a guardian or a caretaker. It is a proactive word that implies action on the part of the bearer. Custodians hold something in trust on behalf of others. Custodianship does not imply behavior motivated out of self-interest.
<br />A custodian, then, is an individual who upholds what is best for all people, even if it may not be in his or her own interest to do so. A custodial role must be approached as a temporary role, preserving something greater than the self—principles of enduring and lasting value. This embodies an attitude that focuses on the task at hand and not on what the leader may gain from the position. It implies a caring and concerned relationship between leaders and followers; it implies individuals motivated by their constituents' best interests.
<br />This idea seems at odds with what we see happening around us. In all too many arenas, we see leaders holding nothing in trust for those they purport to serve, instead merely advancing their own ideals and hopes. It is often difficult to tell whether our leaders are serving themselves or us. And it is all too common to find leaders simply helping themselves to privilege, prosperity and power. Mismanagement, deceit, greed and from-the-frying-pan-into-the-fire problem solving all beg the question, Where are our leaders leading?
<br />To whom can we look for the direction we need? Is Lippmann's statement merely an idealistic, unrealizable dream?
<br />SERVICE FIRST
<br />Throughout time, leaders who have exhibited the proper kind of custodianship—that is, leaders who have sought service over self-interest—have been held in high regard. People have gladly looked to them for direction and guidance in times of indecision and turmoil.
<br />One such custodian stood out in the fifth-century B.C. Roman republic. The Roman army was surrounded, and the country was in need of a leader who would seize the moment and turn impending defeat into victory. They called upon a man who was out plowing his field, a farmer named Cincinnatus. He came. He saw. He conquered. He went home. Cincinnatus gained fame for his selfless devotion to his country. This half-legendary hero gave his all in a time of crisis, and then, when the task was done, he gave up the reins of power and went back to his plow.
<br />A more modern example is America's first president, George Washington (see “George Washington: The Man Who Would Not Be King”). Considered the “father of his country,” he provides a paramount example of the kind of custodial leadership that Lippmann espoused.
<br />Washington was an aristocratic gentleman farmer of distinctive character. When called upon to defend the interests of a fledgling nation as commander in chief of the Revolutionary army during the American War of Independence, he rose to the challenge and persevered against all odds. Then, after eight and a half years of being the most powerful man in America, he resigned his commission and returned to his agricultural pursuits.
<br />Not surprisingly, he was the automatic and unanimous choice to become the first president of the United States. He served two terms, and following this supreme act of service to his country, like Cincinnatus (to whom he had often been compared by his contemporaries), he stepped out of the limelight and retired to his Mount Vernon estate in Virginia.
<br />Washington is remembered for his strength of character and discipline, his loyal patriotism, his principled leadership and his selfless devotion to public duty. He held in trust for the American people the very values and beliefs that made their nation possible, without regard for his own gain.
<br />True leadership is and always has been a selfless action. It involves taking yourself out of the picture and considering the needs of others. It is a way of thinking that takes other people into account even when your own needs are pressing. It asks what is right or best in the wider interest. Few would doubt the need today, in this respect, for more leaders like Cincinnatus and George Washington—leaders who will complete the job they are asked to do without regard for themselves, and who will lead rather than merely registering the collective will of the people.
<br />Yet it would be difficult to build a consensus as to how a leader might accomplish this—how a leader might be a custodian of or hold in trust a nation's or a group's values and beliefs.
<br />How might we answer this question in a world that has seemingly grown unmanageable? Today our world is faced with serious, even life-threatening problems of a global nature. Where will we find the wisdom to deal with modern civilization's most pressing dilemmas?
<br />IT'S EVERYONE'S BUSINESS
<br />Clearly leadership is an issue that affects all of us. Not only are we impacted by it, but we are also called upon to exercise it. Whether we are involved in leading government or business; guiding young minds; leading a family, a sports team or a committee; organizing a dinner, a class project, a carpool or a household; or just standing for what is right—everyone has a leadership role to play. We are each thrust into many different leadership roles again and again throughout our lives. We are each called upon to be custodians of what is right and good, lasting and of value, for those in our care.
<br />Surprisingly, this idea of custodianship even runs through the work of the Renaissance writer often thought to be among the most cynical political thinkers of all time, Niccolò Machiavelli (see “Niccolò Machiavelli:Fairly Misjudged”). Today Machiavelli is most often mentioned in connection with deception and duplicity. Yet he insisted that leadership was virtuous only if the good of the community was sought out and achieved above all else. A good leader, in other words, was a steward of the community.
<br />When we are called upon to lead, what kind of custodian we are will depend greatly on what we understand a custodian to be, how we think about other people, and how we determine what is right and worth holding in trust.
<br />The word custodian, in this context, is the same as the word steward as it is used in the Bible and throughout history. A custodian or steward watches over that which is placed in his or her trust by the one who owns it or for those who will benefit by it. Stewardship is a service performed for others. It is not about ownership or control. It is not a technique. It is who and what the leader is. It is an attitude—a state of being—a way of looking at the world. But it is not the passive, hands-off leadership that some have attributed to this way of thinking. It is a component of leadership without which leaders cannot fully function.
<br />In the context of what Lippmann talked about, it means not only maintaining the vision of and faith in ideals, beliefs and hopes, but also living those values as a model and example for others to follow. It means raising the sights and holding the focus of those we lead so that they are empowered to reach their potential. It means enabling people by getting the roadblocks out of their way and often out of their thinking. To do this, of course, the leader must visualize the big picture at all times and hold the course for the benefit of all.
<br />UNDERSTANDING CUSTODIAL LEADERSHIP
<br />In the widening chasm between what we want and expect from our leaders and what we are getting, it seems only natural to take a hard look at leadership itself. And many do. Finding that the leadership we see around us is lacking, we think that traditional views of leadership must be inadequate and outworn. Out of sheer frustration, we toss out many traditional ideas for new and, we hope, improved ideas of what leadership is all about. Because we believe there are problems with what leaders are doing, the faults of the old views seem sufficient to float the new. Yet these new ideas all too often prove to be myopic and ineffective.
<br />The self-serving nature of many of the leaders we have looked to in the past has led some to call for more passive, follower-driven leadership.
<br />One such version has called for replacing leadership with a concept also called stewardship. Although this new “stewardship” might appear at first blush to be what Lippmann was referring to, it is not. Neither does it refer to the biblical concept. True stewardship cannot replace leadership, because it is an integral part of it.
<br />This nouveau stewardship, as we will refer to it here, has as a guiding principle the belief that people have the knowledge and the answers within themselves. As such, there is no need for a leader to manage other adults—no need to teach others how to think, behave or conduct themselves. While this sounds very appealing, democratic, liberating and almost mystically primal, it is naive. We know from experience that people do not always act in their own best interest, much less that of others.
<br />To suggest that this approach is naive might sound arrogant in a society that has placed personal knowledge in higher esteem than external guidance. As we see the structures and institutions that have traditionally provided us with external guidance dissolving--family, schools and religion—the desire to believe that we are our own best source of wisdom and will act accordingly is strong. Theoretically, it would seem to make sense. Practically, however, it has never worked in any sustainable way. Studies have shown that we all take our cues not from the realities of the environment but from our own biases, desires, perceptions and distractions. A function of leadership, then, should be to help followers create a more accurate and constructive view of reality by painting the big picture.
<br />WHAT IS STEWARDSHIP?
<br />The nouveau-stewardship model is based on a myth that leadership—where direction, vision and guidance come from the top of an organization—creates a dependency on the part of the followers and removes personal responsibility and satisfaction.
<br />Let's analyze that idea. When the concept of nouveau stewardship is presented, it most often claims to have roots in the Bible. Perhaps so. But then proponents of this brand of stewardship go off on a tangent that the Bible does not support. The concept of stewardship is first presented in the Bible in Genesis 2: Adam was instructed to “dress and keep” God's physical creation. This does not present the picture of a passive, hands-off approach. Adam was to apply God's laws and thinking to the physical realm God had created. Adam was expected to do something. While living in harmony with that creation, he was to actively maintain a standard in accordance with laws and thinking higher than his own.
<br />In the same way, when we are given any leadership responsibility, we, too, are obliged to maintain a set of standards that is in line with higher laws. Again, we should not impose our own thinking and desires on those we lead, but rather apply those standards that were designed to be best for the whole. Naturally they should be implemented with respect for, and in two-way communication with, those we serve.
<br />True leadership does not take away the freedom, choice, accountability or responsibility of others. Just as leaders should serve and take into account the ideas and needs of those they lead, those following that lead should do the same thing. In doing so, they, along with the leader, practice self-restraint, develop character, integrate discipline, and practice love and respect for other people. This creates a kind of self-leadership at all levels of the group. It promotes an environment where all are empowered and working toward the good of the whole because that is in the best interest of all.
<br />Daniel Goleman, author of Emotional Intelligence, refers to this kind of concern for the feelings, ideas and opinions of others as empathy. But, he cautions in a Harvard Business Review article, that empathy “doesn't mean a kind of 'I'm okay, you're okay' mushiness. For a leader, that is, it doesn't mean adopting other people's emotions as one's own and trying to please everybody. That would be a nightmare—it would make action impossible. Rather, empathy means thoughtfully considering employees' feelings—along with other factors—in the process of making intelligent decisions” (“What Makes a Leader?” November-December 1998, p. 100). In other words, true stewardship or custodianship means taking others' ideas and feelings into account while holding in trust—keeping as boundaries or guardrails—the group's ideals, beliefs and hopes. Ironically, an attitude of service keeps the leader aware of others' needs while in turn enabling them to become better leaders.
<br />The nouveau-stewardship model sounds right on the surface, but it plays out more like a defense mechanism than a constructive method to get leadership-thinking back on track. As Lippmann correctly defined it, leadership is truly about choosing service over self-interest. Leadership, properly executed, is not a consensus-building exercise but an exercise in outgoing concern for others, including defining and setting boundaries as needed.
<br />A FIRM FOUNDATION
<br />What is critical to the leadership process and its success is where the values come from that determine these boundaries. They can't come from a single individual. Nor can they come from the collective whole. Where do we get the ideals, the beliefs and the permanent hopes that Lippmann wrote of and that define the boundaries—those guides that mold and shape us?
<br />George Washington believed that those values and boundaries came from God. In his first inaugural address he asserted that “the propitious smiles of Heaven can never be expected on a nation that disregards the eternal rules of order and right which Heaven itself has ordained” (emphasis ours).
<br />Again, truly effective boundaries must come from something outside of ourselves. An effective leader has an agenda designed to produce results, but is guided by a core of values that come from outside and not from within. This process is maintained by means of the leader's integrity—his custodianship of those values.
<br />Stressing the need for integrity to an outside core of values in the performance of proper leadership, John Adair, visiting professor of leadership studies at the University of Surrey and Exeter in England, stated: “Although it is impossible to prove it, I believe that holding firmly to sovereign values outside yourself grows a wholeness of personality and moral strength of character. The person of integrity will always be tested. The first real test comes when the demands of the truth or good appears [sic] to conflict with your self-interest or prospects. Which do you choose?” (Effective Leadership, Pan Books, London, 1988, p. 12).
<br />Perhaps it is time to apply those “eternal rules of order and right,” those “sovereign values,” to the leadership roles we perform at every level in life. Even everyday, mundane activities are opportunities to demonstrate and illustrate the values and beliefs for which we must be custodians. If each of us works to uphold such values, the element of empowerment is introduced into our lives: every person becomes in some sense a leader, rather than only those over us who provide us with direction and instruction.
<br />The Being who created us is the ultimate source of the values we must demonstrate to function effectively. In His Word He teaches us how to serve, how to look after each other, how to esteem others more highly than ourselves, how to teach—in other words, how to lead. The Bible is where we will find the guidelines we seek to steer a course through this complex age. We would do well to become more familiar with it.

He experiences himself as something separate from the rest, a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness. This delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to our personal desires and affection for a few persons nearest to us. Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and all of nature in its beauty.” I would just like to emphasize the fact that this person called the human race “deluded”, what kind of a madman calls the entire human race deluded? Then again, what is mad? Is it not just a majority view, what the masses conclude to be insanity? This “madman” who dared to call the human race deluded was none other than the greatest thinker of the 20th century, Albert Einstein.
<br /><br />We think we are separate, we think are special. If we were separate and special, why do have the need to prove it to others? This is, unless…we are not sure of this. We are insecure and fear our insubstantiality. We feel so uncertain of our existence, of where we fit in, that we are driven to attach ourselves to reference points outside ourselves. We define ourselves to something solid which we can hold onto. Thus we create a false image of ourselves, AKA ego, and in doing so we experience a lot of anxiety. This is because of the vast difference between, who we are and who we think we are. This, of course, is the cause of all of our suffering. 
<br /><br />Our suffering is directly proportional to the intensity of our attachment to these passing phenomenons (the finite, e.g. our possessions, our name, our fame, our wealth or prestige) and also to our need to separate ourselves (the infinite) from “the universe”. When we become attached to these things and we “lose” them, we become depressed and sometimes even suicidal. We need to learn to detach ourselves from these things. We cannot lose what was never ours nor can we lose what is ever ours, this concept is of vital importance to ones happiness. We are not separate from the universe, so nothing within it can belong to us, therefore nothing from it can be lost by us. There is, however, something which we as humans do encompass, which can only be given away, our souls. This spirit creates, moulds and shapes. This single aspect gives us the power of free will, the power to choose to be who we are (a universally constructive force), or who we are not (a universally destructive force). 
<br /><br />Human beings are the only creatures with this enormous power, to be able to change and create as we wish. Animals and computers can be taught, but they cannot learn. They do what they were programmed to do, by us, by God or by evolution, which ever option pleases you. They have no free will, as apposed to us. The more we work against the universe, the more difficult it will be to right our wrongs and the more difficult it will be to be harmonious and at peace with the universe. We have this amazing power and with this power comes great responsibility. Try as we may, we cannot shift this responsibility, it is ours. As Jack Johnson said “it was you it was me it was every man, we’ve all got the blood on our hands, we only perceive what we demand and if we want hell then hells what we’ll have”, you are responsible, you have free will, you have a choice and can blame no-one but yourself. Remember what Voltaire said, “No snowflake in an avalanche ever feels responsible”, it’s about time they did.
<br /><br />The very second one does shift the blame, or shifts the responsibility; they are immediately degrading themselves to machines or animals. This is because they are denying their free will, their power to choose and their spirit, which I believe takes one further from the ultimate goal, to create a perpetual harmony in the universe. “Self control”, a term used by many, but are we the self that is controlling? Or are we the self that’s being controlled? Most people would immediately declare that they are the self which is in control, but this is in complete contrast to how they run their lives. When it suits them, they shift the responsibility or blame, in doing so they claiming to have had no free will in the choice and thus claiming that they were being controlled. Do they not see their hypocrisy, their shallowness, their egotistical behavior? Or can they just not help it?
<br /><br />Here is another example of our lack of responsibility. There is this idea that one person cannot make a difference so why even try, this I personally find shameful and degrading. We are not even willing to try, this is because we are scared, scared of losing what we’ve worked so hard for, scared of realizing or rather admitting it was all pointless. We are not willing to take the risk, even though in an altruistic sense we are risking nothing, but stand a chance of gaining everything.
<br /><br />We are just too selfish to even consider this path. We are continuously looking for the path of least resistance, which is thus also the path most trodden. Thereby it became the norm, but why is it that the masses attack those who chose their own path, a more difficult, nobler path?  Why are these people who are trying to help the masses being targeted with hate and repression? I’ll tell you why, because these few descent people intimidate them, they make the masses feel guilty and ashamed for their selfishly lazy ways. Evil fears truth.
<br /><br />We each have our own path to follow, we are individuals. We are not special, we are different, we serve different purposes (or at least are meant to) in society. Thus a balance is maintained and unless we realize our purpose and live it, we will continue to swim against the life carrying current and never reach a state of tranquility. This is because we will continually fighting life instead of embracing it.  If one wishes to immensely enhance ones life style, my message to you is this, Be Different. 
<br /><br />Most people spend their lives avoiding the real truth, they have spent their entire lives in belief of something else, what society, or rather corporations, make them believe to be true. These corporations use the media to influence, or rather control, society. They take advantage of our insecurity, they manipulate us into wanting unnecessary necessities; they want us to be attached, they want us to be materialistic and selfish. They will do anything and everything to keep us from the truth, as long as we are blind they can continue to milk of us of the money which they make us work for. 
<br /><br />Why do you think things like sex, alcohol, cigarettes, drugs, soapies, movies, games etc are so popular? All of these things keep us blinded, they keep us busy and shift our attention from the ever present ever denied truth. Can you not see the trap they’ve put us in? We waste away our entire lives working to be rich, working to attain everything they say we need, then losing it all to them to them. What is the point of all this? The worst part of it all is that while we are in this cycle, we are too proud, or too scared to admit we are wrong, even if we have realized there is more to life. They are scared that their lives up to this point have not really served a purpose, but it has, we need to learn about the lies before we can fully accept the truth.
<br /><br />It is the people who, at this point, are still too afraid to admit they are wrong that are wasting their lives. These sad, weak people attack those who try to help them and then seek refuge in those ever popular “products” that help them avoid the truth. They will not only never acknowledge or repent their corrupt state, but they instead keep themselves preoccupied with keeping others confused and blinded form the truth.  They destroy many people’s lives, because the only way that they can maintain the illusion of their misguided, materialistic sense of worth is by destroying the consciousness of those around them. If left to unfold, the bright, unaltered consciousness of others would take back their world and prick the conscience of the earth bound, into recognition of their deluded selves, this they cannot allow to happen. 
<br /><br />Each of us has the responsibility, towards ourselves and the universe, to look deep into ourselves and realize the quintessence of life. We need to broaden our horizons, we need to look at the bigger picture, we need to free ourselves from this prison of delusion. We need to embrace our insubstantiality, not fear it. He who lives his life to the fullest and lives his life well will never fear death, for he lived his life in accordance with the universe.
<br /><br />Our spirits contain one more amazing power, love and Corinthians has the best description of love that I have ever come across… “Love is patient, love is kind; love is not jealous or conceited, or proud; love is not ill-mannered, or selfish, or irritable; love does not keep a record of wrongs: love is not happy with evil, but happy with truth. Love never gives up: its faith, hope and patience never fail. Love is eternal.”
<br /><br />Love is who we really are, it’s the natural state of the human heart when it is free from the grip of fear, anxiety, guilt, shame and selfishness. Only once we become who we are meant to be, a constructive force, will we finally be happy and in harmony with nature.
