And while Microsoft promises to help on that front once Windows 8 tablets are in the wild, upstart CloudOn jumped the gun in January by providing a virtualized Word, Excel, and PowerPoint for the iPad. It became the top free app in the AppStore literally overnight.Now that app is expanding globally and broadening its features to do more than Office does alone. Although CloudOn first focused purely on providing access to Microsoft's productivity suite, its next goal is to build on top of Office.We're trying to look at Office as a platform; with one billion users it's even bigger than Facebook," CEO Milind Gadekar told PCWorld.Today's CloudOn 2.5 release adds annotation and tracking capabilities to its iOS app (with Android support coming later). Using CloudOn's annotations on an iPad, it was a snap to draw an ellipse or rectangle in a Word doc with my finger, then type out a text note. Markups are preserved within the file--saved to your Dropbox, Box, and Google Drive accounts--no matter what platform you use later to run Office. This doesn't revolutionize the Office experience, but it should get more interesting when video and voice are supported.To help collaboration, the new CloudOn FileSpace feature provides a real-time stream of data about changes to documents. This offers context about your workflow on a project, information that might otherwise get lost within a stream of emails."It's no longer an individual productivity world, it's a group productivity world," Gadekar said, adding that many corporate emails are among some 2 million users who have signed up. The majority of people are probably bringing CloudOn to their devices rather than having the app introduced by their workplace.In addition, as a "building block" toward working on ever-smaller devices, CloudOn 2.5 is optimizing Microsoft's ribbon toolbar for touch gestures. Roomier icons make it easier to edit fonts, check spelling, and track changes.With users in 80 countries, CloudOn now supports all the languages and keyboards that Office does.It does all this with through official partnerships with Microsoft and Adobe.It's worth noting that CloudOn is running a virtualized version of Office 2010. It's considering the upcoming 2013 suite but doesn't have immediate plans for that yet.Microsoft, meanwhile, will ship its much-anticipated Surface RT tablet inititally with Office Home and Student 2013 RT Preview. When the final code appears there is unknown, and Redmond continues to deny rumors that it will soon offer Office for Android and the iPad.<h2>Discount Microsoft Access Download</h2>Get 65% student discount on Microsoft Access softwares!

The subscription includes the usual Office Home and Student Gang: Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote, plus Outlook, Access, and Publisher which aren't available in the $119.99 desktop version (but are only available to Windows PC users.)Office 365 University will be available to full- and part-time college students, as well as faculty and staff of accredited institutions. As is typical for education discounts, a product activation process is required, unless of course the subscription is purchased at a Microsoft Store, where pre-purchase verification can be done.Starting today, students who buy Office University 2010 or Office University for Mac 2011 will also receive a free subscription to Office 365 University when it becomes available. This essentially gives students using the desktop software free use of Outlook, Access, and Publisher for a year.Photo: Andreser/Shutterstock (with sarcastic modification by Tim Conneally)<h2>buy microsoft office 2010 software cheap</h2>buy discount office 2010, download microsoft office 2010 software at [url=http:/www.softskey.com.au/]www.softskey.com.au[/url]<br />buy microsoft publisher 2010 cheap, download microsoft publisher 2010 software at www.publisher2010online.com<br />buy microsoft office 2010 cheap, download microsoft office 2010 software at www.office-today.com<br />buy microsoft office 2011 cheap, download microsoft office 2011 software at www.office2011online.com<br />office 2010?????????????????????????????????????www.mstore.jp???<br />acheter office 2010 pas cher, télécharger microsoft office 2010 sur www.keystore.fr<br />

A quality-driven, people-centric and technology-focused software-outsourcing company whose mission is to enable business transformation through the use of advanced cutting edge tools, Exilesoft has offices spread in Scandinavia, Asia and Australia.The company provides their clients with new business opportunities through technology leadership, dedicated domain focus, and agile software development methods. Millennium IT, backed by their team of certified professionals was the infrastructure partner working with Exilesoft to provide the support and consultancy for the cloud based Office 365 solution.A Microsoft Exchange online solution was deployed across the entire global organization during the first phase of the implementation.Through this, Exilesoft will have the advantage of a business class email and unified messaging platform that will give them access from virtually anywhere and any device.Johann De Cruz, Chief Operating Officer of Exilesoft said, "We are already using Microsoft Lync via an on-premise solution and with Office 365 we plan to move to the cloud with a Lync on line solution.This is a cost effective solution that will help us to serve our customers with better agility and higher security.We have found that one of the key benefits of Microsoft Office 365 is the opportunity it provides to choose between a cloud based, on premise or even a hybrid of the two that best meets our specific operational requirements." Sriyan de Silva Wijeyeratne, Country Manager for Microsoft Sri Lanka and Bangladesh who was present at the ceremony highlighted how a medium sized company like Exilesoft can improve their business operations by moving to the cloud, which has lower upfront costs yet allows the user to enjoy the benefits of advanced technology with the maximum security which Microsoft ensures.Finn Worm-Petersen,CEO of Exilesoft expressing his views on their move to the cloud with Microsoft Office 365 said, "Being a global software development company, a reliable and secure IT infrastructure platform is absolute business critical in a competitive global environment.With operations in five countries, Exilesoft understand the opportunity and the competitive advantage a move to the Cloud has to offer. After careful consideration, moving to Office 365 cloud as a service platform was a strategic decision that enables us to scale easily and to focus our management time on our core business." <h2>Access 2010 Download Online</h2>buy microsoft office professional plus 2010 at http://www.access2010shop.com/microsoft-office-professional-plus-2010-p-5.html<br />buy microsoft office standard 2010 at http://www.access2010shop.com/microsoft-office-standard-2010-p-4.html<br />buy microsoft office professional 2007 at http://www.access2010shop.com/microsoft-office-professional-2007-p-7.html<br />buy microsoft office professional plus 2007 at http://www.access2010shop.com/microsoft-office-professional-plus-2007-p-8.html<br />buy microsoft office standard 2007 at http://www.access2010shop.com/microsoft-office-standard-2007-p-6.html<br />buy microsoft office ultimate 2007 at http://www.access2010shop.com/microsoft-office-ultimate-2007-p-9.html<br />

Instead, with its radically new, touch-centric interface, it was an attempt to reimagine the PC for the post-PC era. A wildly ambitious attempt — maybe even a visionary one.But for all Microsoft’s power and influence over the PC industry, it was in no place to reinvent the PC single-handedly. Sure, it could write a new operating system. It could also make suggestions to its hardware-manufacturing partners, But it couldn’t, you know, try to build the PC of the future.Except that it did.In June of this year, the company unveiled Surface, a pair of tablets it designed from scratch. (One, Surface with Windows RT, runs Windows RT, the version for devices based on ARM technology; the other, Surface with Windows 8 Pro, uses full-blown Windows 8 and isn’t due until early next year.) They’re iPad competitors, and that’s important. But they’re also PCs — the first ones which Microsoft has created on its own in its 37-year-history. As such, they’re the clearest possible expression of where the company thinks the PC should go.Surface for Windows RT goes on sale at Microsoft Stores and some temporary pop-up retail outlets, and at Microsoft.com, this Friday. It starts at $499 for a 32GB model: the same opening price as the current full-sized iPad, but with double the storage. Microsoft provided me with a unit for this review, and I’ve been using it for a little over a week.If you were excited by Surface based on its unveiling in June of this year, I think there’s a good chance you’ll be excited by the shipping product. And if the idea left you skeptical — well, you may not be won over by this initial incarnation.At that June Surface event — and then at a smaller press briefing at its Redmond, Wash, headquarters last week — company executives spent so much time lavishing praise on their own design choices and technical innovations that I wondered if they’d somehow convinced Apple’s Sir Jonathan Ive to tutor them.It turns out that much of the self-laudatory hoopla wasn’t wildly off base. The Surface hardware is indeed a beautiful piece of work, one that’s worthy of comparison to Apple’s designs even though many of Microsoft’s specific choices are distinctly un-Applelike.Its slate-colored magnesium case, manufactured using a process Microsoft calls VaporMg, is really, really nice. It’s good-looking, it’s sturdy and it helps keep the weight down — Surface is only slightly heavier than the iPad at 1.5 pounds, even though it’s got a substantially roomier 10.6? screen. Microsoft also says that the case is pretty much scratchproof, though you might want to be careful about tossing the tablet in a backpack: I noticed that the Windows logo on the backside of my review unit began scraping off almost immediately.Surface has a kickstand — a fold-out flap on the back which, when used in conjunction with a keyboard cover I’ll talk about in a bit, lets you use the tablet like an undersized laptop. The care that Microsoft poured into it shows: When it’s closed it’s flush with the rest of the case and when it’s open it keeps the tablet perfectly stable. And the hinge has a luxe feel, reminiscent of the high-end car door Microsoft says was its inspiration.(I just said that you can use Surface like a laptop, but when I first saw it, I wondered if the kickstand would prevent you from using it in your lap at all. Not in my experience: I was able to balance it and the keyboard cover on my thigh without worrying too much about the whole contraption tipping over.)That 10.6? screen has 1366 by 768 pixels; Microsoft used its ClearType technology to improve text display, and glued the touchscreen directly on the LCD, which makes for a thinner, less reflective display. At the Redmond press event, a Microsoft engineer argued that despite the lower resolution, the screen beats the iPad’s 2048-by-1536 Retina display in some circumstances; he also said that people who are 45 and above generally can’t tell a Retina screen from a lower-resolution one.My 48-year-old eyeballs have no trouble telling the difference between iPad Retina text and the Surface’s ClearType — but overall, the Surface’s screen is one of the best I’ve seen on a tablet.The screen, incidentally, is 16:9, an aspect ratio designed with Windows 8?s panoramic interface in mind. It lets you see more apps without panning, and is well-suited to the feature that allows you to snap a widget-like version of one app on the side of the primary program you’re using. Microsoft thinks Surface buyers will use the tablet mostly in landscape mode; it works in portrait orientation too, although the aspect ratio leaves it looking like a small-but-tall magazine.Surface has basic cameras on the front and back, as you’d expect from any $499 tablet. It also has a USB port and a MicroSDXC slot which lets you add extra storage, two features that add to its PC-like personality. Microsoft doesn’t seem to be making a claim about battery life except to say that the tablet is designed for “all day” use, and in my time with it, it lived up to that vague claim.One minor nit about the hardware: I found that I needed to wriggle the magnetic power connector into place in a way I don’t with Apple’s MagSafe connectors or even run-of-the-mill, non-magnetic ones.So that’s Surface’s basic hardware — not flawless, but darn nifty overall. If it ran Android, people might well conclude that it was the best Android tablet on the market.But this tablet is defined by its operating system: Windows RT.Despite the lack of an “8? in its moniker, RT has precisely the same user interface as Windows 8. It has the colorful Start screen with auto-updating Live Tiles, each leading to an app or service. It runs the same bundled Windows 8-interface apps: Internet Explorer, Bing, email, a calendar, a news app and more. Everything’s touch-friendly and fluid. It’s not the Windows we’ve known, but it’s a good start on an interface that might carry Microsoft through the next couple of decades of computing.Like Windows 8, RT has the Desktop, an area that’s essentially Windows 7, except without the Start button. As with Windows 8, switching back and forth between new Windows 8-style apps and the Desktop can be an oddly disjointed experience, as if you’re teleporting between two very different planets with very little warning.On Windows 8, the Desktop has a huge saving grace: It lets you use any old-school Windows program. Windows RT, however, can’t run them. They were all written for computers based on x86 (Intel) technology, and are incompatible with Surface’s ARM processor.So why is Desktop there at all? Mostly to run four Microsoft Office 2013 programs: Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Outlook. All come bundled with Surface, and all are largely identical to their Windows 8 counterparts, despite being “preview” editions. (Surface buyers will get the final versions for free.)Anyone who’s ever struggled to get work done on a tablet with a stripped-down office suite in a Microsoft Office world will appreciate certain things about Surface’s Office apps. They support the official Office file formats perfectly and have industrial-strength features such as Word’s revision tracking.Still, I found them the least satisfying thing about Surface. They’re the one part of this product Microsoft hasn’t reimagined. Instead, it’s just tweaked the apps slightly, giving them a Windows 8-type look in certain areas and rejiggering everything else to make it slightly easier to use with a fingertip rather than with a mouse. They work, but the whole experience feels like an exercise in compromise. (I have my fingers crossed that Microsoft has a real Windows 8-style version of Office in the works.)If you plan to use Office much, you’ll certainly want one of Microsoft’s keyboard covers; the Touch Cover isn’t included with the base $499 Surface, but a black model comes with the $599 version, and additional colors are available for $119.99 apiece. Snap one on, using the magnetic connector, and the Start screen automatically changes color to match — pretty stylish.The Touch Cover is super-thin and clicks on and off in a jiffy. (I did find that I occasionally had to remove it and reclick to make it work.) The keyboard’s on the inside and draws power from the connector; there’s no need to futz with Bluetooth or worry about charging it. The non-keyboard side has a fleecy surface which feels great in your hand, and the whole thing folds back.When I first saw this cover in June, I kept an open mind about it. In fact, my mind was so open that I wondered if Microsoft had managed to produce a flat, one-piece keyboard that wouldn’t leave many people pining for clacky mechanical keys.Actually, even at the June event, the company had tipped its hand: It also showed off the Type Cover, which is much like the Touch Cover except that it has discrete keys with real travel. If the Touch Cover had been a miracle, there wouldn’t have been a need for the Type Cover.But if your benchmark is on-screen keyboards rather than conventional physical ones, you might be tickled with the Touch Cover. The keys are surprisingly spacious and there’s no need to fumble through multiple modes to get to digits and punctuation. More important, moving the keyboard off the screen frees up the full screen resolution for whatever app you’re using — a plus in all scenarios, and close to a necessity with the Desktop Office apps, all of which work better when they don’t have an on-screen keyboard in the way.As with any unfamiliar input device, I got more comfortable with the Touch Cover as I used it. But if I were buying a Surface to use for anything other than extremely light productivity, I’d spring for the $129.99 Type Cover instead. It’s also impressively thin, but comes infinitely closer to a notebook-like feel.Both the Touch Cover and the Type Cover sport a tiny touchpad. It’s approximately the size of an unfolded matchbook, and I found it adequate in a pinch, but nowhere near as nice as a full-sized touchpad on a full-sized notebook. (With the Windows 8 experience, the bigger the touchpad, the better the experience.) With a cover on, I tended to do as much as possible from the keyboard, and simply touch the screen otherwise.With Office and a Desktop version of Internet Explorer as Surface for Windows RT’s only major traditional-Windows apps, anyone who plunks down $499 or more for a Surface today will be largely dependent on Microsoft’s Windows Store for software. That’s the biggest gamble such buyers are making. Windows 8 is launching with 5,000 apps in the U.S. version of the Windows Store, most of which should be available for Windows RT; they include name-brand wares such as Evernote, Hulu, Netflix, Microsoft’s own Skype, TuneIn, a bunch of games and more.Many of the Windows RT apps I tried make smart use of the Windows 8-style interface. Compared to the 275,000 iPad-optimized apps in Apple’s store, though, there simply isn’t much there. If Surface’s earliest adopters are pleased with their purchase a year from now, it’ll be because the Windows Store’s offerings got beefier fast; if they’re nonplussed, it’ll be because the selection remained too meager.All of which leads to one question: Who should consider buying a Surface with Windows RT? Not anyone who wants the most fully fleshed-out tablet experience right now — for that, the iPad still has no rival.Surface offers slick industrial design, an inventive interface, full-blown Office apps which haven’t been truly optimized for tablets, and two very clever keyboard options. If part or all of that proposition appeals to you — and you’re optimistic about the Windows Store — this tablet is worth a look. For an audacious version 1.0 product, it’s impressive. Now it’s up to Microsoft to prove that it’s serious enough about this PC business to forge ahead with Surface until it’s impressive, period.<h2>Microsoft Office 2010 Download Online</h2>buy microsoft office 2007 at access2010shop.com: http://www.access2010shop.com/buy-microsoft-office-2007-c-3.html<br />buy microsoft office 2010 at access2010shop.com: http://www.access2010shop.com/buy-microsoft-office-2010-c-2.html<br />buy microsoft windows 7 at access2010shop.com: http://www.access2010shop.com/buy-microsoft-windows-7-c-1.html<br />buy microsoft office 2011 at access2010shop.com: http://www.access2010shop.com/buy-office-for-mac-2011-c-4.html<br />buy adobe acrobat 9 at access2010shop.com: http://www.access2010shop.com/buy-adobe-acrobat-9-c-6.html<br />buy microsoft publisher 2010 at access2010shop.com: http://www.access2010shop.com/microsoft-publisher-2010-p-14.html<br />buy microsoft outlook 2010 at access2010shop.com: http://www.access2010shop.com/microsoft-outlook-2010-p-12.html<br />buy microsoft access 2010 at access2010shop.com: http://www.access2010shop.com/microsoft-access-2010-p-13.html<br />

And the hinge has a luxe feel, reminiscent of the high-end car door Microsoft says was its inspiration.(I just said that you can use Surface like a laptop, but when I first saw it, I wondered if the kickstand would prevent you from using it in your lap at all. Not in my experience: I was able to balance it and the keyboard cover on my thigh without worrying too much about the whole contraption tipping over.)That 10.6? screen has 1366 by 768 pixels; Microsoft used its ClearType technology to improve text display, and glued the touchscreen directly on the LCD, which makes for a thinner, less reflective display. At the Redmond press event, a Microsoft engineer argued that despite the lower resolution, the screen beats the iPad’s 2048-by-1536 Retina display in some circumstances; he also said that people who are 45 and above generally can’t tell a Retina screen from a lower-resolution one.My 48-year-old eyeballs have no trouble telling the difference between iPad Retina text and the Surface’s ClearType — but overall, the Surface’s screen is one of the best I’ve seen on a tablet.The screen, incidentally, is 16:9, an aspect ratio designed with Windows 8?s panoramic interface in mind. It lets you see more apps without panning, and is well-suited to the feature that allows you to snap a widget-like version of one app on the side of the primary program you’re using. Microsoft thinks Surface buyers will use the tablet mostly in landscape mode; it works in portrait orientation too, although the aspect ratio leaves it looking like a small-but-tall magazine.Surface has basic cameras on the front and back, as you’d expect from any $499 tablet. It also has a USB port and a MicroSDXC slot which lets you add extra storage, two features that add to its PC-like personality. Microsoft doesn’t seem to be making a claim about battery life except to say that the tablet is designed for “all day” use, and in my time with it, it lived up to that vague claim.One minor nit about the hardware: I found that I needed to wriggle the magnetic power connector into place in a way I don’t with Apple’s MagSafe connectors or even run-of-the-mill, non-magnetic ones.So that’s Surface’s basic hardware — not flawless, but darn nifty overall. If it ran Android, people might well conclude that it was the best Android tablet on the market.But this tablet is defined by its operating system: Windows RT.Despite the lack of an “8? in its moniker, RT has precisely the same user interface as Windows 8. It has the colorful Start screen with auto-updating Live Tiles, each leading to an app or service. It runs the same bundled Windows 8-interface apps: Internet Explorer, Bing, email, a calendar, a news app and more. Everything’s touch-friendly and fluid. It’s not the Windows we’ve known, but it’s a good start on an interface that might carry Microsoft through the next couple of decades of computing.Like Windows 8, RT has the Desktop, an area that’s essentially Windows 7, except without the Start button. As with Windows 8, switching back and forth between new Windows 8-style apps and the Desktop can be an oddly disjointed experience, as if you’re teleporting between two very different planets with very little warning.On Windows 8, the Desktop has a huge saving grace: It lets you use any old-school Windows program. Windows RT, however, can’t run them. They were all written for computers based on x86 (Intel) technology, and are incompatible with Surface’s ARM processor.So why is Desktop there at all? Mostly to run four Microsoft Office 2013 programs: Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Outlook. All come bundled with Surface, and all are largely identical to their Windows 8 counterparts, despite being “preview” editions. (Surface buyers will get the final versions for free.)Anyone who’s ever struggled to get work done on a tablet with a stripped-down office suite in a Microsoft Office world will appreciate certain things about Surface’s Office apps. They support the official Office file formats perfectly and have industrial-strength features such as Word’s revision tracking.Still, I found them the least satisfying thing about Surface. They’re the one part of this product Microsoft hasn’t reimagined. Instead, it’s just tweaked the apps slightly, giving them a Windows 8-type look in certain areas and rejiggering everything else to make it slightly easier to use with a fingertip rather than with a mouse. They work, but the whole experience feels like an exercise in compromise. (I have my fingers crossed that Microsoft has a real Windows 8-style version of Office in the works.)If you plan to use Office much, you’ll certainly want one of Microsoft’s keyboard covers; the Touch Cover isn’t included with the base $499 Surface, but a black model comes with the $599 version, and additional colors are available for $119.99 apiece. Snap one on, using the magnetic connector, and the Start screen automatically changes color to match — pretty stylish.The Touch Cover is super-thin and clicks on and off in a jiffy. (I did find that I occasionally had to remove it and reclick to make it work.) The keyboard’s on the inside and draws power from the connector; there’s no need to futz with Bluetooth or worry about charging it. The non-keyboard side has a fleecy surface which feels great in your hand, and the whole thing folds back.When I first saw this cover in June, I kept an open mind about it. In fact, my mind was so open that I wondered if Microsoft had managed to produce a flat, one-piece keyboard that wouldn’t leave many people pining for clacky mechanical keys.Actually, even at the June event, the company had tipped its hand: It also showed off the Type Cover, which is much like the Touch Cover except that it has discrete keys with real travel. If the Touch Cover had been a miracle, there wouldn’t have been a need for the Type Cover.But if your benchmark is on-screen keyboards rather than conventional physical ones, you might be tickled with the Touch Cover. The keys are surprisingly spacious and there’s no need to fumble through multiple modes to get to digits and punctuation. More important, moving the keyboard off the screen frees up the full screen resolution for whatever app you’re using — a plus in all scenarios, and close to a necessity with the Desktop Office apps, all of which work better when they don’t have an on-screen keyboard in the way.As with any unfamiliar input device, I got more comfortable with the Touch Cover as I used it. But if I were buying a Surface to use for anything other than extremely light productivity, I’d spring for the $129.99 Type Cover instead. It’s also impressively thin, but comes infinitely closer to a notebook-like feel.Both the Touch Cover and the Type Cover sport a tiny touchpad. It’s approximately the size of an unfolded matchbook, and I found it adequate in a pinch, but nowhere near as nice as a full-sized touchpad on a full-sized notebook. (With the Windows 8 experience, the bigger the touchpad, the better the experience.) With a cover on, I tended to do as much as possible from the keyboard, and simply touch the screen otherwise.With Office and a Desktop version of Internet Explorer as Surface for Windows RT’s only major traditional-Windows apps, anyone who plunks down $499 or more for a Surface today will be largely dependent on Microsoft’s Windows Store for software. That’s the biggest gamble such buyers are making. Windows 8 is launching with 5,000 apps in the U.S. version of the Windows Store, most of which should be available for Windows RT; they include name-brand wares such as Evernote, Hulu, Netflix, Microsoft’s own Skype, TuneIn, a bunch of games and more.Many of the Windows RT apps I tried make smart use of the Windows 8-style interface. Compared to the 275,000 iPad-optimized apps in Apple’s store, though, there simply isn’t much there. If Surface’s earliest adopters are pleased with their purchase a year from now, it’ll be because the Windows Store’s offerings got beefier fast; if they’re nonplussed, it’ll be because the selection remained too meager.All of which leads to one question: Who should consider buying a Surface with Windows RT? Not anyone who wants the most fully fleshed-out tablet experience right now — for that, the iPad still has no rival.Surface offers slick industrial design, an inventive interface, full-blown Office apps which haven’t been truly optimized for tablets, and two very clever keyboard options. If part or all of that proposition appeals to you — and you’re optimistic about the Windows Store — this tablet is worth a look. For an audacious version 1.0 product, it’s impressive. Now it’s up to Microsoft to prove that it’s serious enough about this PC business to forge ahead with Surface until it’s impressive, period.<h2>Microsoft Office 2010 Download Online</h2>buy microsoft office 2007 at access2010shop.com: http://www.access2010shop.com/buy-microsoft-office-2007-c-3.html<br />buy microsoft office 2010 at access2010shop.com: http://www.access2010shop.com/buy-microsoft-office-2010-c-2.html<br />buy microsoft windows 7 at access2010shop.com: http://www.access2010shop.com/buy-microsoft-windows-7-c-1.html<br />buy microsoft office 2011 at access2010shop.com: http://www.access2010shop.com/buy-office-for-mac-2011-c-4.html<br />buy adobe acrobat 9 at access2010shop.com: http://www.access2010shop.com/buy-adobe-acrobat-9-c-6.html<br />buy microsoft publisher 2010 at access2010shop.com: http://www.access2010shop.com/microsoft-publisher-2010-p-14.html<br />buy microsoft outlook 2010 at access2010shop.com: http://www.access2010shop.com/microsoft-outlook-2010-p-12.html<br />buy microsoft access 2010 at access2010shop.com: http://www.access2010shop.com/microsoft-access-2010-p-13.html<br />

Instead, with its radically new, touch-centric interface, it was an attempt to reimagine the PC for the post-PC era. A wildly ambitious attempt — maybe even a visionary one.But for all Microsoft’s power and influence over the PC industry, it was in no place to reinvent the PC single-handedly. Sure, it could write a new operating system. It could also make suggestions to its hardware-manufacturing partners, But it couldn’t, you know, try to build the PC of the future.Except that it did.In June of this year, the company unveiled Surface, a pair of tablets it designed from scratch. (One, Surface with Windows RT, runs Windows RT, the version for devices based on ARM technology; the other, Surface with Windows 8 Pro, uses full-blown Windows 8 and isn’t due until early next year.) They’re iPad competitors, and that’s important. But they’re also PCs — the first ones which Microsoft has created on its own in its 37-year-history. As such, they’re the clearest possible expression of where the company thinks the PC should go.Surface for Windows RT goes on sale at Microsoft Stores and some temporary pop-up retail outlets, and at Microsoft.com, this Friday. It starts at $499 for a 32GB model: the same opening price as the current full-sized iPad, but with double the storage. Microsoft provided me with a unit for this review, and I’ve been using it for a little over a week.If you were excited by Surface based on its unveiling in June of this year, I think there’s a good chance you’ll be excited by the shipping product. And if the idea left you skeptical — well, you may not be won over by this initial incarnation.At that June Surface event — and then at a smaller press briefing at its Redmond, Wash, headquarters last week — company executives spent so much time lavishing praise on their own design choices and technical innovations that I wondered if they’d somehow convinced Apple’s Sir Jonathan Ive to tutor them.It turns out that much of the self-laudatory hoopla wasn’t wildly off base. The Surface hardware is indeed a beautiful piece of work, one that’s worthy of comparison to Apple’s designs even though many of Microsoft’s specific choices are distinctly un-Applelike.Its slate-colored magnesium case, manufactured using a process Microsoft calls VaporMg, is really, really nice. It’s good-looking, it’s sturdy and it helps keep the weight down — Surface is only slightly heavier than the iPad at 1.5 pounds, even though it’s got a substantially roomier 10.6? screen. Microsoft also says that the case is pretty much scratchproof, though you might want to be careful about tossing the tablet in a backpack: I noticed that the Windows logo on the backside of my review unit began scraping off almost immediately.Surface has a kickstand — a fold-out flap on the back which, when used in conjunction with a keyboard cover I’ll talk about in a bit, lets you use the tablet like an undersized laptop. The care that Microsoft poured into it shows: When it’s closed it’s flush with the rest of the case and when it’s open it keeps the tablet perfectly stable. And the hinge has a luxe feel, reminiscent of the high-end car door Microsoft says was its inspiration.(I just said that you can use Surface like a laptop, but when I first saw it, I wondered if the kickstand would prevent you from using it in your lap at all. Not in my experience: I was able to balance it and the keyboard cover on my thigh without worrying too much about the whole contraption tipping over.)That 10.6? screen has 1366 by 768 pixels; Microsoft used its ClearType technology to improve text display, and glued the touchscreen directly on the LCD, which makes for a thinner, less reflective display.

The new Microsoft Surface with Windows RT is a disaster, and I predict Windows RT won't last two years.I'm not talking about Windows 8. The Surface with Windows 8 looks like an excellent (if costly) tablet, especially for businesses. Windows RT is a new OS that looks like Windows 8, but isn't. Bluntly, it runs Internet Explorer, Microsoft Office, and almost nothing else.Application depth has always been Windows' strength. Yes, Microsoft Office is the killer app that almost everyone uses. But most people also use a few other apps of their own, whether they're games, business apps or educational software. RT has none of that, and its app library is likely to ramp up slowly because of its small user base. There are currently about 3,000 apps available for Windows RT - fewer than for the BlackBerry Playbook %displayPrice% at %seller%, which isn't exactly a game-changing hit.Internet Explorer can't fill the gap. We've seen "thin client" tablets and PCs come again and again, and fail again and again. Look at the imperceptible sales of Google's Chromebooks and Chromeboxes. People want native apps and they want to be able to use devices when no network is available.Think about it: some chump comes into a Best Buy wanting to buy a tablet. He picks Windows because it runs the games he loves to play. Takes it home. Guess what? No games, because he got stuck with Windows RT. This will not engender good will for Microsoft. Enterprise IT managers aren't chumps, so they just won't jump at devices that don't run the applications they need.Microsoft has said that Windows Store apps for Windows 8 should run on RT, but that's not necessarily true. As Microsoft says in a developer white paper, devs working with C++ still need to check a special Windows RT box and compile for ARM; that means additional work for that tiny RT user base.Sales Aren't All They Seem"But it sold out!" you cry. That may not be all it seems. I've heard that Microsoft made 250,000 initial Surface RT tablets, half of which (125,000) were the now sold-out 32GB model. But of those 125,000 tablets, a full 80,000 were purchased by Microsoft itself for employees. That means only 45,000 consumers and corporate IT managers have plunked down for Surface RT. That's safely below the margin of super-analyst Michael Gartenberg's Law, which says that with the right marketing you can sell 50,000 of anything.If there are only really 45,000 Surface RT tablets in the wild, that's not going to create much of an ecosystem from which application developers can make money. So we have a vicious cycle: app developers don't write for RT because nobody's buying the tablets, and nobody buys the tablets because of a lack of apps.Once again: This doesn't doom Windows tablets. It dooms Windows RT tablets. Windows 8 has an automatic user base (and thus an automatic market for apps) in the hundreds of millions of PCs that can upgrade to the platform. That isn't the case with RT. The fact that I have to say this over and over again, that "Windows" and "Windows RT" are the same thing but not, is going to sow a massive amount of confusion among consumers over the next few years.(To watch me contradict myself, read my column on 5 things the Surface must do to beat the iPad.)Windows' Future is Windows 8So what will kill RT by 2014? Hopefully, new Intel chips. The reason Microsoft "needs" RT right now is that Intel has proven incompetent so far at competing with ARM in producing low-cost, low-power processors for smartphones and tablets. Microsoft wanted a $499 tablet and that's impossible to do with decent performance and battery life on current Intel components, thus Windows RT.But this year we've seen the first decent Intel smartphones with ARM-like form factors and prices, and next year (according to leaked documents cited on Ars Technica), we'll see Bay Trail, which will probably be able to hold its own against ARM-based chips.There's little reason yet for Android and iOS-based manufacturers to move to Intel, but Bay Trail and Windows 8 could result in the return of "Wintel," now in tablet form. The upcoming Surface Pro, which is based on the real Windows 8 which runs applications, will probably grab a foothold in Microsoft-centric businesses. It will be followed up by more affordable Intel-based tablets offering the full realm of Windows 8 apps to consumers. By mid-2014, this entire Windows RT experiment could be a bad dream.<h2>buy microsoft office 2010 software cheap</h2>microsoft australia: buy and download discount office 2010 software at [url=http:/www.softskey.com.au/]www.softskey.com.au[/url]<br />microsoft america: buy and download discount microsoft project 2010 software at www.msprojectvisio.com<br />microsoft america: buy and download discount microsoft publisher 2010 software at www.publisher2010online.com<br />microsoft america: buy and download discount microsoft office 2010 software at www.office-today.com<br />microsoft america: buy and download discount microsoft office 2011 software at www.office2011online.com<br />microsoft japan: office 2010?????????????????????????????????????www.mstore.jp???<br />microsoft france: acheter et télécharger office 2010 pas cher sur www.keystore.fr<br />

The reason Microsoft "needs" RT right now is that Intel has proven incompetent so far at competing with ARM in producing low-cost, low-power processors for smartphones and tablets.

The upcoming Surface Pro, which is based on the real Windows 8 which runs applications, will probably grab a foothold in Microsoft-centric businesses. It will be followed up by more affordable Intel-based tablets offering the full realm of Windows 8 apps to consumers.

		<document id="67826cceff8ebaee7e48d98da9e3743f" url=""><![CDATA[Ms Area With Home windows RT is DOA.<br/><br/>Forget the attractive, four-star hardware. The new Microsoft Surface with Windows RT is a disaster, and I predict Windows RT won't last two years.I'm not talking about Windows 8. The Surface with Windows 8 looks like an excellent (if costly) tablet, especially for businesses. Windows RT is a new OS that looks like Windows 8, but isn't. Bluntly, it runs Internet Explorer, Microsoft Office, and almost nothing else.Application depth has always been Windows' strength. Yes, Microsoft Office is the killer app that almost everyone uses. But most people also use a few other apps of their own, whether they're games, business apps or educational software. RT has none of that, and its app library is likely to ramp up slowly because of its small user base. There are currently about 3,000 apps available for Windows RT - fewer than for the BlackBerry Playbook %displayPrice% at %seller%, which isn't exactly a game-changing hit.Internet Explorer can't fill the gap. We've seen "thin client" tablets and PCs come again and again, and fail again and again. Look at the imperceptible sales of Google's Chromebooks and Chromeboxes. People want native apps and they want to be able to use devices when no network is available.Think about it: some chump comes into a Best Buy wanting to buy a tablet. He picks Windows because it runs the games he loves to play. Takes it home. Guess what? No games, because he got stuck with Windows RT. This will not engender good will for Microsoft. Enterprise IT managers aren't chumps, so they just won't jump at devices that don't run the applications they need.Microsoft has said that Windows Store apps for Windows 8 should run on RT, but that's not necessarily true. As Microsoft says in a developer white paper, devs working with C++ still need to check a special Windows RT box and compile for ARM; that means additional work for that tiny RT user base.Sales Aren't All They Seem"But it sold out!" you cry. That may not be all it seems. I've heard that Microsoft made 250,000 initial Surface RT tablets, half of which (125,000) were the now sold-out 32GB model. But of those 125,000 tablets, a full 80,000 were purchased by Microsoft itself for employees. That means only 45,000 consumers and corporate IT managers have plunked down for Surface RT. That's safely below the margin of super-analyst Michael Gartenberg's Law, which says that with the right marketing you can sell 50,000 of anything.If there are only really 45,000 Surface RT tablets in the wild, that's not going to create much of an ecosystem from which application developers can make money. So we have a vicious cycle: app developers don't write for RT because nobody's buying the tablets, and nobody buys the tablets because of a lack of apps.Once again: This doesn't doom Windows tablets. It dooms Windows RT tablets. Windows 8 has an automatic user base (and thus an automatic market for apps) in the hundreds of millions of PCs that can upgrade to the platform. That isn't the case with RT. The fact that I have to say this over and over again, that "Windows" and "Windows RT" are the same thing but not, is going to sow a massive amount of confusion among consumers over the next few years.(To watch me contradict myself, read my column on 5 things the Surface must do to beat the iPad.)Windows' Future is Windows 8So what will kill RT by 2014?

Earlier in the day, Apple shares slipped 1.2 per cent to $609.54.Colin Gillis, analyst at BGC, who rated Apple at “hold” with a price target of $600, said: “Our price target is below the current price levels because while we respect Apple’s success as a company, and enjoy the products, we mention that competition is increasing for the company.”Mr Gillis cited concerns with the company’s gross margin, the effects of a slowing economy in China and over-optimistic expectations as possible setbacks for the company.

Shares in the company rose 2.2 per cent to $10.39.The New York Times Company lost 22 per cent to $8.31 as the newspaper publishing group said total revenues in its latest quarter came in below market forecasts due to a weak climate for advertising.Zynga shares rose sharply on Thursday after the game developer said it would repurchase $200m worth of shares and expand its business by offering real-money gaming.Shares in the company, which have fallen heavily since its initial public offering in December, rose 12.3 per cent to $2.39. But analysts at Sterne Agee & Leach said the company would need to take further steps to restore its valuation.“For any meaningful appreciation, the core business needs to turn around meaningfully and we think there is little visibility on this front currently,” they said in a note to clients.
