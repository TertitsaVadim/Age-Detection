<br /><br />A: Yes. Using 350 watts low-power appliances, the average car battery to turn off the engine in case of providing 30-60 minutes of power, if only 50-60 watts power using a laptop, will have to grow with time and more. Our quasi-sine wave inverters are equipped with under-voltage warning and undervoltage protection circuit, when the prolonged use of the battery voltage drops to 10-volt lead, the undervoltage protection circuit and the output voltage is cut off and the police, to prevent battery because voltage is too low to start the engine of the accident. Therefore, the user can safely shut down the state of the engine to use the inverter. 
<br /><br />10 Q: If you want to use the inverter a long time without starting the engine, how do? 
<br /><br />A: Preparation of one another the same voltage battery, its positive and negative wires are thick enough to use the original car battery with positive and negative terminals connected. In this way, independent of the inverter can greatly extend the usage time. 
<br /><br />11 Q: What is the risk of using (<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5sY2QtaW52ZXJ0ZXItc2hvcC5uZXQvVG9zaGliYS9Ub3NoaWJhXzQuaHRtbA__" target="_blank">Toshiba inverter</a>)? 
<br /><br />A: from the car battery to the inverter input that a wire carrying a very large current, if the wire is of poor quality, too small or the load excessive conductor heating and even eventually lead to a fire wire, will lead to very serious accidents. Thus, in the process of using the inverter must be in strict accordance with the provisions of the user manual operation. 
<br /><br />12 Q: How do I know the battery capacity? 
<br /><br />A: The battery has a lot of printed letters and numbers, as long as the words can be found XXAH know this is a big capacity battery. Let me talk about the meaning of AH, A representative of amps (amp.), the current unit, H stands for hour (hour). Two letters together means &quot;amp hours&quot;, that is sustainable within an hour how many amps of output current. XX is usually in front of two figures, the number of amps. For example, 45AH battery on behalf of this can be an hour of time the output (12 V) 45 amps. As this battery can power output, we use the 12 volt by 45 amps, 540 watts draw, this is the battery output power (theoretical value). 
<br /><br />13 Q: What general household use car battery size? 
<br /><br />A: Under normal circumstances, the cylinder capacity of 1.3 liters of a small car with a 40-45 amp hours battery ,1.6-2 .0-liter mid-size car equipped with a 50-60 amp hours battery, 2.2 liters of medium and large cars 60-80 when equipped with a security battery. Off-road vehicles, utility vehicles equipped with the battery is generally the same size engine than the car's battery capacity to be bigger. As for the battery voltage, generally use 12-volt car battery, diesel engine vehicles (including trucks) most of the 24-volt battery, a few still use 12-volt battery (such as Iveco). 
<br /><br />14 Q: How is the battery with the right inverter? 
<br /><br />A: If the specification is 12-volt battery 50 Ah, we multiply 50 with 12-volt safety, the battery's power output reached 600 watts. If the inverter efficiency of 90%, we then multiplied by 90% of 600 watts, 540 watts draw. This means that you can push a piece of battery output power up to 540 watt inverter. Of course, you can take &quot;one step&quot; type of procurement method, which is to present his car regardless of the battery with the specifications, and buy a power output of 800 watt (<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5sY2QtaW52ZXJ0ZXItc2hvcC5uZXQvSUJNL0lCTV81Lmh0bWw_" target="_blank">IBM inverte</a>). Then, the first battery in this moment the extent permitted use, so in the future for a larger car and then full power to use. Finally, the inverter power less demanding, for example, 100 watts is enough, then you can buy a small power inverter. In addition, the power inverter in determining when there is an important principle that the use of the inverter, do not run full term, which would significantly shorten the life of the inverter, the inverter while the failure rate will be significantly rise. We strongly recommend that users, preferably not more than 85% of the rated power of the state to use an inverter. 
<br /><br />15 Q: car inverter must pay attention to? 
<br /><br />A: First of all, in strict accordance with the provisions of the user manual to use the inverter; Secondly, the inverter output voltage is 220 volts AC, 220 volts and this is in a small space and in a mobile state, so be extra Be careful. Should be on safer place (especially away from children!) To prevent electric shock. When not in use, the best cut off the input power. Third, do not place the inverter heater direct sunlight or near the exit. Inverter's ambient temperature should not exceed 40 degrees Celsius. Fourth, the inverter will be hot work, so do not place near or in their articles. Fifth, (<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5sY2QtaW52ZXJ0ZXItc2hvcC5uZXQvSFAvSFBfNS5odG1s" target="_blank">HP inverter</a>) is afraid of the water, do not make it rain, or sprinkle with water. 
<br /><br />16 Q: Why use ordinary multimeter to measure the quasi-sine wave inverter AC output, the displayed voltage than 220 playful? 
<br /><br />A: This is normal, because the quasi-sine wave AC voltage measurement should be used with 'RMS' file in order to obtain the correct form of universal reading. 
<br /><br />17 Q: how to choose inverter product? 
<br /><br />A: The power (<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5sY2QtaW52ZXJ0ZXItc2hvcC5uZXQvR2F0ZXdheS9HYXRld2F5XzUuaHRtbA__" target="_blank">Gateway inverter</a>) is a work in high current, high frequency environment of power products, the potential failure rate is very high. Therefore, consumers must be careful when buying. First, the inverter output waveform from the election, it is best not less than quasi-sine wave; Secondly, the inverter must have a complete circuit protection; Third, manufacturers have a good after-sales service commitment; fourth, the circuit and test of the product over time.

<br /><br />Inverter is the role of: the DC voltage on the motherboard (usually 5V to 20V) into a high frequency AC, and then high-frequency step-up transformer (400V to 1000V) lit the lamp.
<br /><br />Inverter LCD screen is responsible for the lamp power supply, it is transformed into high-frequency high-voltage direct current voltage to light the lamp, is the transformer, easy to heat, it is more easily broken. When the laptop power, Inverter power supply is normal, turn the start switch control signal oscillation circuit, the switch to work, transformer voltage boost, lit the lamp. Inverter is easy on a few bad elements: supply, insurance, main chip, switch, transformer.
<br /><br />Inverter power and signal from the motherboard, connected by cable to the motherboard, generally:
<br /><br />1. The main power supply (typically 5V to 20V), behind the main supply pins generally have insurance, this can determine which is the main power supply.
<br /><br />2. Ground wire.
<br /><br />3. Open the control signal (from the video card).
<br /><br />4. Brightness adjustment voltage (from IO, there is no brightness adjustment Inverter), how to determine which is the brightness control voltage it into the system, hold down the FN + brightness control keys, there will be significant changes in brightness adjust voltage, the voltage becomes large brighten and dim the voltage becomes small.
<br /><br />5. LED power indicator, usually 5V power supply, (some Inverter no LED).
<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5sY2QtaW52ZXJ0ZXItc2hvcC5uZXQ_" target="_blank">Inverter</a> failure can cause: dark screen, the screen flickering, frequently burned out lamp, notebook motherboard does not work.
<br /><br />Two. Lamp
<br /><br />Lamp failure can cause: dark screen, the screen flickering, dim the screen reddish, uneven screen brightness. Need for frequent lamp replacement practice, to the way skilled and fast.
<br /><br />Dark laptop screen repair process:
<br /><br />Dark laptop screen is the signal system is working properly, backlight system is not working properly, you can faintly see the screen there is information on the phenomenon, to determine whether the dark screen notebook must pay attention to the middle and upper left corner of the screen, change the angle of view, it can be seen LOGO and the upper left corner of the boot information.
<br /><br />1. Open notebook on the turn, the first external tube, if the external tube normal light, indicating that the original screen tube failure, replace the lamp can be solved, for general use lamp pumping tube, it can effectively avoid the screen to run the light, the tube cut at both ends of the plastic plate, careful not to touch the screen, cut the original tube line, slowly out of the tube, the tube when the tube ends must pay attention to good insulation, and then the lights tube fixed at both ends sealed with hot melt adhesive.
<br /><br />2. If the external bulb does not light, the first measurement of the main power supply Inverter insurance is normal, if the insurance is not normal can be directly connected with lines.
<br /><br />3. If the insurance is necessary to properly test the Inverter main power supply (5V to 20V), open the control signal (3.3V or 5V), the ground is normal, if these three normal, then the description of Inverter failure, can be substituted with high-voltage notebook models .
<br /><br />4. If this is not the normal three, we must first determine <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5sY2QtaW52ZXJ0ZXItc2hvcC5uZXQvSUJNL0lCTS1MZW5vdm8tNDJ3Nzk3NC5odG1s" target="_blank">IBM Lenovo 42w7974 Inverter</a> and the motherboard connection is working, if the connection is not normal, you can fly lines solution, if the connection is normal, you need to detect the main power Inverter (5V to 20V), open the control signal (3.3V or 5V) of the circuit board.
<br /><br />5. General line interface on the motherboard near the screen will control the main power supply Inverter (5V to 20V), open the control signal (3.3V or 5V) of the field tube, the two field tube is very easy to go wrong, if the field tube problems in the field tube removed, with the line of the D pole and S pole can be directly connected.
<br /><br />6. If the main power supply and the Inverter power supply adapter is the same, the main power supply is generally Inverter protection circuit to isolate, if the Inverter main power supply is 5V, 12V, and generally come from the system power supply.
<br /><br />Open the control signal (3.3V or 5V) to the graphics chip is.
<br /><br />7. If the Inverter is broken, not the same model can be substituted, or the Inverter main power supply, open the control signal circuit is difficult to repair. You can consider to change Inverter.
<br /><br />8. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5sY2QtaW52ZXJ0ZXItc2hvcC5uZXQvSUJNL0lCTS1MZW5vdm8tNDJXNzk5Ny5odG1s" target="_blank">IBM Lenovo 42W7997 Inverter</a> is easy to change, as a general high voltage with 5V, as well as two 9V-20V, as long as the main power supply to ensure that there is, open the control signal, the ground can. If the original Inverter main power supply, open the control signal, ground in a normal can also be used.
<br /><br />The main power supply (5V USB power usually take, 9V to 20V isolation circuit is generally taken in the protection), open the control signal is generally obtained in the screen supply, connect a ground wire on it.

<br /><br />1. Host power failure caused by
<br /><br />Host power or host damage caused by poor power quality black failure is common. For example, when you add some new equipment, the display will appear a black screen failure, ruled out the accessories compatibility issues of quality and poor quality of power supply after a power shortage is the main cause of failure, then you may also hear the machine 12 continuous alarm horn sound, high quality replacement power supply is the best solution to such failures. In addition, some motherboards have AT / ATX Dual power connector, jumper settings of their choice can not cause such failures.
<br /><br />2. Quality parts, caused by the fault
<br /><br />Poor quality or damaged computer accessories, display a black screen is caused by failure of the main causes. Such as the motherboard (and the motherboard BIOS), memory, graphics card and so on may cause problems with certain black screen failure occurs. Performance of its failure such as a monitor light was orange, then replaced with a substitution under the graphics card, memory, and even the motherboard, cpu try is the quickest solution.
<br /><br />3. The connection between the quality of parts
<br /><br />Memory card, etc. between the plug and the motherboard incorrect or loose causing poor contact is the main cause black screen failure. And the display card and monitor connection problems may lead to such failures, until the AT power supply plug is not correct even worse if your hard drive or optical drive data cable connection may also lead to start the anti-black screen failure.
<br /><br />4. Black screen failure due to overclocking
<br /><br />Or to over-overclocking parts not suitable for overclocking overclocking will not only result in the generation of black failure, can also cause serious damage to parts.
<br /><br />5. Other causes of black
<br /><br />Others, such as the motherboard CMOS settings are not correct and incorrect motherboard jumper to clear the BIOS can cause black screen failure, then you can change its setting description of the control board. In addition, software conflicts, such as improper installation, driver problems, DIY, such as improper BIOS flash error, power management settings are not correct, a vicious virus cause hardware damage (such as CIH), and so are likely to lead to display a black screen failure occurs. Everyone in the face of such failure may wish to consider more carefully think about the causes of failure, so troubleshooting know ourselves more with less.
<br /><br />Second, the display black screen failure due to their failure
<br /><br />According to my usual experience, displays black screen failure caused by their failure is mainly caused by the following reasons -
<br /><br />1. AC power shortage
<br /><br />External power supply shortage, resulting in some of the old monitor or display of some large power consumption does not start properly, the monitor's own failure caused one of the reasons black failure. Or external power supply voltage is unstable, too low may cause the monitor does not work.
<br /><br />2. Damage to the power switching circuit
<br /><br />Display switch circuit failure is caused by failure of the main causes of black display. Simple, such as internal power switch is damaged or (<strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5sY2QtaW52ZXJ0ZXItc2hvcC5uZXQ_" target="_blank">Inverter</a></strong>) circuit; common or external damage, such as switch circuit components are damaged, and so on.
<br /><br />3. Damage to the line output circuit
<br /><br />Line output tube and power supply circuit or circuit failure is caused by failure of the main causes of black display. Ignition coil damage, especially in some relatively poor quality for many years, or to cause the display of no-name no black screen failure is more common.
<br /><br />Three. Display a black screen troubleshooting ideas
<br /><br />How to display a black screen failure repair, we will present some of the ideas below for your reference.
<br /><br />First, the host computer failure caused by the fault that we can display a black screen from the following ideas to be resolved -
<br /><br />1. Check the quality of fitting
<br /><br />When you replace the parts in assembled computers or black screen failure occurs, you should first check the quality of your installation accessories. For example, memory is installed correctly good contact with the motherboard socket, display cards, place cards are installed, BIOS settings with the relevant jumper on the motherboard choice is correct, you can see detailed instructions for setting the relevant board, while focus on examination of the quality of their own board and the relevant slot on the motherboard and the card's &quot;Goldfinger&quot; and to be part of any foreign objects contaminated by dust is also very necessary.
<br /><br />In addition, whether the CPU is overclocked to use or &quot;wrong&quot; overclocking (especially for soft jumper the motherboard, the system of &quot;automatic&quot; error caused by such failure to set more), hard disk or optical drive data cable is to be reversed, etc. you need to consider. And for such problems, the best first use of &quot;minimum system method&quot; and &quot;replacement method&quot; for diagnosis, the host, leaving only the motherboard, video card, memory, CPU to try, especially the quality of good or bad memory caused Such relatively high failure rate, such as no problem, you can focus on checking the quality of other accessories, such as the still black, you can focus on these parts and then carefully try to restart after installation and connection, if not solve the problem, try replacement parts can be related The quality test accessories.
<br /><br />In addition, it is important that you also need to know the host is good or bad power supply and power switch and its connected properly or not, they could cause the whole black screen, which you need to focus to understand. If the power problem, then you open the computer can see the chassis panel light is off, and the host can not hear the sound of rotation within the power supply fan and hard drive self sound so, it shows that you did not even get the normal host system the power supply. These problems you should first check whether there is an external AC power coming with test pencil to see the power outlet has power. Then the power cord can be connected to the host Cece supply side has power, if necessary, test the voltage with a multimeter is enough enough, the voltage is too high or too low may cause the host power supply overvoltage or undervoltage shutdown circuit automatically protection, if the above no problem, then you focus on the first host of internal and repair power switch and reset button, the same minimum system method and replacement method, each pulling the host card and other devices within the power lines, signal lines , and then power test machine, such as the removal of a device in the host power supply back to work, it is just removal of equipment damage or improper installation cause a short circuit, the power supply in the short-circuit protection circuit to start, stop supply of machine equipment, then you can its focus on examination of its exposure, if necessary, replace the first try; other key power switch and reset button to check the quality and their connection with the right on the motherboard or not very important, because many poor and the power switch on the chassis reset button a few times after frequent use their internal (<strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5sY2QtaW52ZXJ0ZXItc2hvcC5uZXQ_" target="_blank">Inverter</a></strong>) metal contact plate power short circuit fault occurs, which causes the whole black screen without any display. If the above checks failed to solve the problem, then replace the power supply to try.
<br /><br />2. Listening concept of color identified failure
<br /><br />Computer failure more often the screen goes black after turning on the performance of the host panel indicator lights, the fan inside the normal rotation, but the emergence of PC speaker sound the alarm; or internal to the chassis and other related equipment such as hard normal self, but display no display. Then by the above method in addition to maintenance, it is more important to learn to discern the laws of the PC speaker's error figuring failure, in addition to observation of failure of the host or display the flicker of light to determine the failure is also very easy to use.
<br /><br />For example, the host normal self, but display a &quot;black&quot; failure, for this failure we can focus on board - Graphics Card - display cable - monitor up to consider this idea. First to check the monitor power light is lit, such as normal, some adjustment may focus on the brightness, contrast button and remove the &quot;usual&quot; type of fake black screen failure. If there is no problem, you can check the host key card to the monitor if there are problems connecting cable and plug on the cable skew exists within the fault and its pointer is closely connected with the graphics card, in addition to these cable connectors can be Remove, look whether the display was bright normal or monitor connected to the other hosts to try in order to determine the fault location from the host or the display itself caused.
<br /><br />Another example, display a black screen and the host of speakers uttered a long, two or three short beeps sound or continuous beep, that shows the connection between the card and motherboard problem or display card and monitor the connection between the problem, You can focus on examination of its slot if the slot is good contact with a foreign body can replace the video card to try, if no improvement can be a preliminary indication of the problem on the motherboard, you can get the other graphics on the motherboard try. Again, there's a long continuous sound of chirping, most of that memory is a problem, can focus on examination of memory and memory slots for installation of exposure. If the machine to issue a continuous short beeps sound, then that machine has a slight short-circuit, and can be the minimum system method and process of elimination to solve the problem, until you find the short circuit parts. In addition, if you hear two short beeps sound, then the motherboard or graphics card or monitor may be a problem, so if you still do not connect the monitor beeps, the display card site problems, such as the short sound into sound, the monitor end of problem.
<br /><br />For the black screen due to monitor their own fault, we mainly from the following to provide you with more specific ideas of maintenance -
<br /><br />1. Display a black screen of fast repair
<br /><br />If the monitor has no display after boot, after excluding a host of reasons, can first check is not due to high or low voltage protection circuit caused by the display, you can check the acceleration voltage is normal. In addition, the focus is likely to have problems check the following components, such as take a look at the fuse, rectifier switch if there is breakdown, current limiting resistor is blown, these parts sometimes can be seen from the appearance of its burned black and other symptoms. Then focus on checking the output pipe, transformers, low-frequency rectifiers, high-frequency rectifier and other key parts of the existence of damage or performance degradation or cold solder joint, etc., generally display a black screen failure as long as you have started the hand to the disease can quickly In addition.
<br /><br />2. Line scan circuit fault diagnosis
<br /><br />Line scan circuit failure is caused by the power of no raster display screen shows no important reason. For this type of failure can be focused on the maintenance line scan circuit, oscillator circuit can first check whether the line in question, under the conditions of the amateur line oscillation in addition to checking whether the damage to the chip peripheral components outside the chip can be replaced before the test line oscillation test, another line of work to promote the tube is damaged or abnormal condition, the output pipe is damaged or the line output of the load in question are likely to cause the failure, then you can try to repair and replace these parts. The line output circuit if any problems are generally replaced by the normal maintenance.
<br /><br />3. Tube and its power supply circuit fault diagnosis
<br /><br />Tube and its power supply circuit can cause the display is not normal power failure without black raster. Then we can check whether the light under the CRT filament, filament with a meter to measure the filament voltage power supply circuit to see whether it is normal. In addition, if you find the filament power block to be replaced on a good filament current limiting resistor can, if you find broken filament tube, you need to replace the tube. If the above is normal, we can focus on to check the tube acceleration voltage is normal, especially the acceleration voltage connections off the main cause of such failure is caused, and replace. If there is high pressure, we may consider replacing the line output transformer key (ignition coil) to try, this part of the damage is caused by one of the main display black screen failure. In addition, in the maintenance of the above we can check the voltage and the cathode as the discharge voltage is normal, if not as the discharge voltage plus the voltage or simply do not display the normal power is also caused by non-black grating and one of the important reasons .

<br /><br />Advantages: display panel thin (flat structure), electromagnetic radiation is small, passive display type (non-glare, contribute to eye health), display information, easy to color of long life (this device is almost no degradation Therefore, an extremely long life, but the LCD backlight life is limited).
<br /><br />Disadvantages: not enough bright colors.
<br /><br />LCD display screen in accordance with the different control methods can be divided into passive matrix LCDs and active matrix LCD two.
<br /><br />The passive matrix LCD: Passive matrix LCD brightness and viewing angle, subject to greater restrictions, the response has been slower. Aspects of picture quality, making this display device is not conducive to the development of a desktop display (<strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5sY2QtaW52ZXJ0ZXItc2hvcC5uZXQvVG9zaGliYS9Ub3NoaWJhLVNhdGVsbGl0ZS1BNTA1LVM2OTcwLmh0bWw_" target="_blank">Toshiba Satellite A505-S6970 Inverter</a></strong>). Passive matrix LCD can be divided into TN-LCD (Twisted nematic LC which-LCD, distorted to the column LCD), STN-LCD (Super TN-LCD, super twisted nematic LCDs) and DSTN-LCD (Double layer STN-LCDs, layer super twisted nematic LCDs).
<br /><br />Active Matrix LCD: extensive active-matrix LCD, also known as TFT-LCD (Thin Film Transistor-LCD thin film transistor LCDs). TFT LCD screen, each pixel built-in transistors, allows the brightness of the brighter, richer colors and wider viewing area.
<br /><br />The laptop has a DSTN-LCD (commonly known as pseudo-color display) and TFT-LCDs (commonly known as true color display) two LCD display. LED display refers to the LED backlight is relative to the current mainstream in terms of the lamp backlight, display LCD.
<br /><br />DSTN (Dual-Layer Super Twist, nematic LC which) LCD: the dual-scan twisted nematic, which means that the dual-scan mode to scan twisted nematic liquid crystal display, to complete the display. DSTN-LCD is not a true color display, it can only display a certain color depth, and thus called &quot;pseudo-color display. Poor DSTN-LCD contrast and brightness, the screen observed range, the color is not rich, especially the reaction is slow, is not suitable for high-speed full-motion images, and video playback applications, are generally used only for text, tables and static image processing , and now has basically disappeared.
<br /><br />TFT (Thin Film Transistor) LCD: by the thin-film transistor screen (<strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5sY2QtaW52ZXJ0ZXItc2hvcC5uZXQvVG9zaGliYS9Ub3NoaWJhLVNhdGVsbGl0ZS1BNTA1LVM2OTgwLmh0bWw_" target="_blank">Toshiba Satellite A505-S6980 Inverter</a></strong>), each liquid crystal pixel is driven by an integrated thin-film transistors in the pixels behind each pixel on the display followed by four (one black, the three RGB color) issued by the independent thin-film transistor-driven pixel color light, can display 24-bit color depth, true color, you can do high-speed, high-brightness, high contrast display screen information. TFT-LCD is one of the best LCD color display device, is now mainstream in the notebook computer display device.

Although the covers are made of aluminum-magnesium alloy of the metal, but one step up, but will crush the panel caused by rupture, so usually try not to be placed in the notebook on top of heavy objects. There is also a thought-provoking questions, that is, the laptop need to use the screen saver?
<br /><br />Using a CRT screen, if the computer pause operation, the screen for a long time remain the same, the electron beam of the CRT screen has been shot in the same region of the fluorescent layer, easy fatigue because of the fluorescent layer caused by the aging of the screen, and even CRT was penetrate. Therefore, when using a CRT screen, using a screen saver helps to avoid damage to the screen.
<br /><br />To use the LCD desktop and notebook <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5sY2QtaW52ZXJ0ZXItc2hvcC5uZXQvRGVsbC9EZWxsLUxhdGl0dWRlLUU2NTAwLmh0bWw_" target="_blank">Dell Latitude E6500 Inverter</a></strong>, a good habit to make good use of screen saver has been with you, and the screen saver can show all kinds of interesting picture, and to avoid computer screen spy on others. Windows XP is installed, by default there are a set of screen saver, set to stop after ten minutes of computer operation, automatically goes into screen saver.
<br /><br />In fact, the LCD screen saver and no prolonged use of screen saver even negative impact! LCD as long as the screen, liquid crystal molecules has been in working condition, even if it is a screen saver, LCD is at full speed in the operation. In order to show more beautiful 3D screen saver, than usual, even more busy! The LCD itself has a limited life, plus the screen saver is running idle time, or even shorten the life of the LCD. Although the LCD will naturally aging but do not let the screen saver has become one of the LCD killer.
<br /><br />And notebooks often use only the battery in the operation and leave the computer, it is best to close the LCD. The way each turn off the LCD screen <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5sY2QtaW52ZXJ0ZXItc2hvcC5uZXQvSFAvSFAtRzYwLTIwOENBLmh0bWw_" target="_blank">HP G60-208CA Inverter</a></strong> is not certain, but directly to the LCD cover close my, system change will automatically enter standby mode, setting off the screen will automatically return to a previous working state. Or set their own after a few minutes if no operation directly into the dormant state may also Part of the notebook directly to the screen turns off, but all computer operating at full speed is still in progress.
<br /><br />ASUS Power for Gear, technology, the &quot;Fn&quot; + &quot;F1&quot; can be directly off the screen power supply, the &quot;Fn&quot; + &quot;F7&quot; can be multi-adjust LCD brightness. If you do not want the tube too much notebook power settings set directly in the Windows power management program long time, turn off the screen, or even shut down the hard disk or standby, you do not need to worry about things from time to time in order to power management.

<br /><br />A: after you monitor is still blue lights that host circulate is normal, most of you for display backlighting circuit problems, common inverter for damage, the so-called inverter is for of LCD backlight provide steady voltage of a control panel, if <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5sY2QtaW52ZXJ0ZXItc2hvcC5uZXQ_" target="_blank">LCD inverter</a></strong> with low voltage damage when we will turn dark as liquid crystal display also also can become dark, even you directly. Because of LCD display panel is itself can't shine. 
<br /><br />Because of the LCD monitor generally now six tubes, we see in the screen, your phenomenon of part of the tube is not stable, which now if also can restore that exist hidden trouble. May be more frequent. 
<br /><br />The solution is still in the guarantee if the monitor within the time limit, we can find out the aftermarket part maintenance. This belongs to the quality question, belong to free maintenance projects. 
<br /><br />Liquid crystal display common failure: 
<br /><br />1, the mainboard problem 
<br /><br />LCD monitor motherboard voltage inverter and motherboard or didn't have a problem, aging and short circuit fault, etc, it will cause the screen turn dark problem, usually the most to repair fault and not to change the mainboard, as long as the correct, the appropriate examination maintenance can be solved. 
<br /><br />2, inverter problem 
<br /><br />LCD monitor inverter aging or burn out or the power source jumper inverter, and loosen the broken wait for a reason, because of the inverter cause screen dark more common. Display the <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5sY2QtaW52ZXJ0ZXItc2hvcC5uZXQvQWNlci9BY2VyLUFzcGlyZS01NjAwLmh0bWw_" target="_blank">Acer Aspire 5600 Inverter</a></strong> long-term work in high temperatures words chip that would be easier aging or burn out. 
<br /><br />3, virus attacks 
<br /><br />Virus attacks to scroll BIOS parameter is set to change, so that the screen turn dark and therefore need to periodically to the computer for antivirus, promptly update, again in the BIOS setting new set the parameters of the display Settings. 
<br /><br />4, row line problem 
<br /><br />The screen can cause screen broken line line screen dark as laptop is folding, so if the user too hard to open and close the screen words will wear screen line even screen row break line, and some laptop due to design problem, also can appear due to long to open and close the screen, and appear screen row line is wear, so the user needs to use at ordinary times of pay attention, should be moderate, slowly open the screen. 
<br /><br />5, screen tube problems 
<br /><br />Display tubes is reason such as aging or short circuit will make screen dark, appear such circumstance we can to professional maintenance personnel for processing or return treatment plant, and the general then because of aging tubes long use or is in use process have collisions, the screen of short circuit may because inside the metal shell screen cause more, another of screen have broken word can also shell to prevent short circuits.
