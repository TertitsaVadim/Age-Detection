<br /><br />i watch as you slowly fade
<br />life washing from your face
<br />a hint of a smile comes a across across your face
<br />because it is the end
<br /><br />CHORUS:
<br />i shed my black tears for you 
<br />as i watch you fade 
<br />come with me and ill show you a place where the pain ends
<br /><br />tears of blood run down your pale face 
<br />you pale face you fall from my grasp 
<br />your senses failing 
<br />hush dont make a sound
<br />its ok your safe now
<br /><br />chorus
<br /><br />i take you to a place where there is no pain 
<br />you odnt need to worry
<br />ill keep you safe
<br /><br />chorus
<br /><br />the end

<br />Tell me in my INBOX... cuz it's a secret... then repost this in your bulletin... you might be surprised with the responses you get. They could make you laugh or even smile. If you don't repost this you are a coward. Repost it saying, &quot;What would u do with me..&quot;

<br />everything fades to a gray...
<br />nothing is right or real except you....every one else leaves but you stay......
<br />in a twisted way im kinda glad.......
<br />b.c it makes me think that at least i have some reason to live but.....
<br />even tho i dont realize this ur the source of my pain.....
<br />every bad memory or time ive had belongs to you and you leave me to my insanity
<br /><br />why is it people believe in stupid things like divine powers or god
<br /> when if you really think about it you know that there very well is a chance
<br /> that everything is fake......
<br />so why is it we follow and believe...
<br />b.c it leads us into a false sense of security and hope
<br /> and even tho when everything goes wrong we have an excuse
<br /> &quot;bad things sometimes happen to good people b.c were all sinful*
<br />haha wut a load of bullshit

<br />the music drowns it all out as usual and i wouldnt have it any other way
<br /> its usually during these times where all the repressed
<br /> thoughts that i hide come back
<br /> hate,destruction,death, and suicide, 
<br />sometimes i wonder if im insane but i know im not, im very sane......its just the world around me
<br /><br />used
<br />I wake up and find you by my side and see your beautiful face
<br /> and then i wake up again this time in real life where youre not here
<br /> because you never were......
<br />i give you everything because you are like a part of me 
<br />you are my second digit my.... ecstacy and what do i get ???you would expect
<br />true love right....wrong!!!
<br /> no true love is a misconception made by the foolish 
<br />who spend their time on it i used to believe in it myself until i met you....

<br />hate is my will to constantly defy you
<br />insanity is what destroys me from the inside
<br />irony is the pain that i feel because i know its a waste
<br />suicide is the extreme that i face every day
<br />death is what will come for you and i watch and wait for...........
<br /><br />cutting
<br />i feel the dull pain from what i cant remember
<br /> i see the blood roll down my wrists,
<br /> life doesnt seem real anymore
<br />  its as though im watching myself through a t.v screen
<br /> and then the pain comes again and i remember what i did,
<br />then something rises inside me to fight the pain
<br /> and so i try my strength slowly  leaving  me until i cant even more....
<br />i try to scream but nothing comes out.....
<br /><br />untitled 
<br /><br />my thoughts flash away to a place far and distant,
<br />a place that i dont even know,
<br />im glad its this way becauseyou cant take it away from me

<br />here it is again,that ravaging sensation that makes me want hurt you even more,
<br />you live in your seemingly perfect world
<br /> but you have no fucking idea of how badly i want you to die,
<br />does anything good ever come from you, if there is i have yet,
<br />your life is pointless to me and i wish dearly that it would end 
<br />if you cant ill make you because you dont deserve to liveyou mother fucking bitch
<br /><br />untitled
<br />what poin is there to this, is everything really worth it?? 
<br />why should i waste my time with you??
<br /> what make you so important??
<br /> because i could honestly care less about you,
<br /> you think you can just use and abuse me me and ill just stand back 
<br /> and take it well i wont,
<br />im sick of your shit and im sick of you
<br /><br />boredome
<br /><br />too much noise, too much sound 
<br />it all makes me want to scream 
<br />but i cant so i sit here in the silence trying not to go insane.....
<br /><br />go  away
<br /><br />god this is so stupid every time i try to block you out
<br /> or make you or any thoughts of you go away
<br /> they come back pecking at my sanity until i just lose it,
<br /> im tired of this but theres nothing i can,
<br /> suicide is pointless because that means im giving in to you
<br /> and my insane thoughts so ill just stay the way i am and one ill find a way to get back.....
<br /><br />circle of denial
<br /><br />what makes you so goddamned special
<br /> who the fuck do you think you are,
<br /> just because you think youre important makes you think you have the right to be bitchy, well guess fucking what you dont,
<br /> you think tm your best friend and that i should stand around and wait on you
<br /> and hope that someday my wishes will be answered,
<br /> this is the denial that keeps me from the truth that im just daydreaming 
<br />so now you think youre losing me and im actually important to you again,
<br /> and then i feel better and this all happens again....
<br /><br />waste of my time
<br /><br />youre not worth it and you never were, 
<br />i find it kinda funny that it took me this long just to realize this
<br /> youre just a stupid peice of shit who deserves nothing better
<br /> than being raped and then getting stabbed to death,
<br /> there are so many times where i could just come up behind you and throttle you and make you die there are so many other ways that ive thought of that would take to long
<br /> to describe but now i just realize your a waste of my time

<br /><br />love
<br />life is full of shitty things but love is the worst,
<br />it works against you anyway it can and after 
<br />its done it finds some other way,
<br />you think its your friend but its only waiting
<br />for the chance to hurt you again!!!!!
<br /><br />death
<br />and i can make yours quick, you can live 
<br />your in denial trying to please &quot;god&quot;
<br />but in the end youll realize what a waste it truly is
<br />and then when you realize this ILL BE WAITING!!!
<br /><br />sickness of life
<br />everything is so loud and i want the noise to stop
<br />but it wont so i have to stop it my self means killing the source,
<br />im sick of everything especially you,my most happy thought are of
<br /> me ripping you open and leaving to bleed then the happiness ends
<br />and im back to real life where i can only dream of making you suffer
<br /> more than you could ever think
