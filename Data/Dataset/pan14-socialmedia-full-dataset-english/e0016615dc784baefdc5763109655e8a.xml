Look for companies with a decent rating and whose information on their website appears to fit your needs and makes sense to you. (For example, if you are moving long distance, consentrate on companies that specialize in moving long distance). Hiring a moving company is not the same as ordering a pizza or a taxicab, so unless you move is a simple one, it really should not be simply booked over the device. Note that not all companies are going to be willing to come over and allow an in person quotation, and so you may have to contact several companies to obtain your 3 quotes. Be prepared to create an extra quotation in the event that one of the companies don't show up, or don't get back with a quote as soon as they've visited. <br /><br />&lt;b&gt; Step 3: Evaluating the Quotes &lt;/b&gt; <br /><br />Now you've got your three quotes in front of you, it's time to complete one more step - choosing the right company from these. <br /><br />The fundamental and most important part of the quote will be correctly evaluating the amount of furniture, which should be listed somewhere in the quote either in cubic feet or pounds <strong> (1 cubic ankle = 7 pounds) </strong>. <br /><br />Everything else necessary to plan together with price your move will follow from this - amount of movers, number and dimensions of trucks, and so on. If moving locally, the quote should provide a minimum of &lt;em&gt; <strong> 1 mover for any 400 cubic feet with furniture </strong> &lt;/em&gt;, assuming average moving conditions. Remember that if your move will require difficult access (many stairs, steep driveway or what have you ever) this 400 cubic feet per mover ratio should be lower. <br /><br />If many of the quotations do not involve an estimate of how much furniture there is (or present an abnormally low estimate*), the resulting estimate of time and cost will with best be a shot in the dark, and will almost certainly appear lower than the other quotes which happen to have calculated this figure properly. If you encounter the following, be mentally disciplined and resist the temptation to obtain seduced by a small sounding price. <br /><br />In the end you will not really save anything, and is going to be putting your move in danger. A firm or &quot;not to exceed&quot; quote can be a special treat, if provided! <br /><br />&lt;em&gt; *A general rule of thumb when moving locally is usually 1 cubic foot of furniture for every 1 square foot of living area. A 600 square foot apartment can have 600 cubic feet of furniture, a 1200 square foot home can have 1200 cubic feet of furniture, and so with. Note that for moves going across the country, the amount of furniture is usually pared down, and that ratio would typically be lower. &lt;/em&gt; <br /><br />Make sure you are happy and can abide by the Company's Terms &amp; Circumstances before making the appointing decision, especially regarding the break point. Both sides should be clear prior to the move starts what their own respective obligations will be in case of any damage (ie partial/full replacement, deductible payable etc). <br />.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2JnbS5tZS9yLzE2NjUwNjQ_" target="_blank"> Definitely undoubtably the best place for Vancouver office movers</a>
