<br /><br />And my body would wither by and by
<br /><br />But my love for you will go on and on.
<br /><br />Yes, it will still be there after I`m gone.
<br />You will feel me on the soft gentle breeze
<br /><br />As you wander through the tall forest trees.
<br /><br />I will be on the beach as the tide comes in
<br /><br />That will remind you how easy my heart was to win.
<br /><br />You will go about your work and play
<br /><br />And remember how you loved me one day.
<br /><br />Love is so strong, the heart is weak.
<br /><br />The tears will flow, the eyes will leak.
<br /><br />No, I never wanted to go away.
<br /><br />But without your love no reason to stay.
<br /><br />Even if you took your love from me
<br /><br />I would forever in your heart be.
<br /><br />The angels will come and sing you a song
<br /><br />They will tell you how I'm getting along.
<br /><br />They will whisper about my love for you
<br /><br />And let you know my heart is being true.
<br />So, if that time
<br /><br />should ever come to be
<br /><br />And you say, &quot;I'll love you again,&quot; you will see
<br /><br />The mountains, beaches and meadows will know.
<br /><br />As you shout, &quot;I'm sorry I ever let you go.&quot;

<br />I have two worlds: the real and imaginary, the dream, so to speak. 
<br />Or the world of desires. But a dream is a wish that we do not? 
<br />You're one of these worlds. 've Been awake for 11horas. 
<br />Oh, please do not ask me to count the times I thought about you today ... 
<br />And now I find myself thinking how much I thought of you today. 
<br />I thought or felt? 
<br />It's just that when I think of you, think with your heart, just because I love you. 
<br />I'm sure that incalculable that were meant for each other, what do you want? 
<br />It's not worth hiding. 
<br />Because you can never hide if you realize that certainty. 
<br />But if I tell you, we may also begin to think of myself 
<br />with the certainty of your heart. 
<br />But if you do not think of me with my heart, 
<br />I will learn to survive with it. 
<br />I can not oblige you to anything. 
<br />We're friends, right? 
<br />And today it is so rare that I have is that we are happy to stay. 
<br />But I love you. 
<br />Today we not talked about. 
<br />You must have been with each other. 
<br />My greatest desire is to be happy. I love you. 
<br />My world is very complex. I mean, it's not yours? 
<br />Each complex world in their own way. 
<br />Also I did not want a world color pink. 
<br />Would be so boring. But I like the quiet, sometimes ... 
<br />Other times I like the excitement, 
<br />joy over with a car flying on the roads, 
<br />all in a hurry to get home sooner. 
<br />But you do not want to know my world, 
<br />one that fits in the palm of your hand and turning around you. 
<br />And my world has a star: you. 
<br />My world is our world. I love you. 
<br /><br />With all my affection ... 
<br />Kisses and hugs

<br />Today I am tired of everything. 
<br />I've been wanting to go out dancing to this song that is playing.
<br />Close your eyes and open my arms 
<br />and feel the air hit my face and I feel completely free!
<br />Ah! I want to smile. 
<br />Liberty makes me happy.
<br />I can not live without my freedom, 
<br />and sometimes cost me understand how 
<br />I hold myself to anyone.
<br />I continue to fly these notes sound so beautiful.
<br />Step through the clouds, magic, 
<br />make me feel so light and so free. 
<br />Free love unresolved.
<br />The warm wind makes my hair smooth 
<br />and makes me waver tickle in the back and I smile, 
<br />smile, smile like a happy child.
<br />I smile because I'm free. I smile because I feel happy, 
<br />because I want to smile. Because I'm free, 
<br />free of extremist ideals, prejudices, racism.
<br />Today I am free today because I feel like putting out the child 
<br />that lives inside of me and smile freely without feeling 
<br />ashamed to look at me. 
<br />Today I am light and loose.
<br />Tomorrow I can no longer be. But today I am. 
<br />The wind drove me to a deserted beach.
<br />The sun reflected in the sea and I smile. 
<br />And then I lie on the sand and open arms.
<br />Embrace the Universe and I feel good, calm, happy, free. 
<br />I feel I can have a little bit of everything and everyone.
<br />I begin to walk the waterfront and go leaving footprints 
<br />that daring the waves come off.
<br />Maybe they are right. There are past or present of my life 
<br />that I should try to erase.
<br />I want to delete forbidden love, passion unmatched.
<br />But I know I still can not. Not yet.
<br />But one thing I am sure:
<br />I am free and my freedom I'll ever have!
<br /><br />With all my affection ...
<br />Kisses and hugs

<br />Quietly, not a sound
<br />There is starlight and moonlight...
<br />Magic all around
<br />What a perfect time to tell you
<br />How wonderful you are
<br />I have become enchanted...
<br />If only from afar.
<br />I've never seen an angel
<br />But, I feel it could be you...
<br />You seem so angelic
<br />In everything you do.
<br />An angel sweet and special
<br />A miracle of God's love.
<br />Were you born in Heaven
<br />Between the stars above?
<br />In my heart I wonder
<br />Are we something meant to be?
<br />Let's start on a journey
<br />Together...Just
<br /><br />You and Me.

We all fall in love and there are times that we love so much. That we lose ourself in our wrong emotions. More often, at night we wondered why there is love.We should start to search for an answer. And try to find where love has gone wrong but in the end we find ourselves where we started. We cannot question LOVE when it has some reasons. Love will always be as it always has been silent,mysterious,and deeply profound. Many of us believe that love is FOREVER, that love never dies. Only to be the solution in the end when we found our hands empty and our hearts longing. We mistakenly have look that love as a need to be fulfilled,but love is only a gift given to us. We should not hold it in our hands,for we may never find strenght to let it go and decide to live. We should only embrace its warmth and glory. While it last and then freely open our arms when its time to say GOODBYE.
<br /><br />When we fall in love with someone. We don't want that feeling to end, for it is everthing we are, and everything we wanted to be. We pray that love will stay and grow in our heart.But if it doesn't. Then we should never let our life taken by it. For life  should not end where heartaches begin. There is always a reason why we have to move on.When we have to say goodbye to the feelings we want to stay forever. Let us not wave our hands with a heavy heart. For love will have to set its wings free and find the place where it belongs.We may had lost it but then again. When we closed our eyes and listen to the echoes of our heart.We will hear that feeling sounding silently forever. Then we will know that it has never like this. For the good we become because of the love will always stay. It always be there reminding us that we should be thankful and happy not because we had lost love. But because for once in our lives that feeling live in our heart and made us happy...

<br />To help me through when my life gets tough
<br />And when I feel that Ive had enough
<br /><br />The sun you see, makes me think of you
<br />The miracle of it, the wonder too
<br />I see you both everyday as you know
<br />To stop seeing either, Id have to say, no
<br /><br />The bright colours shine from within my heart
<br />The colours of a sunset, a special part
<br />Of a day in my life I wish you could see
<br />Just whats its like, just to be me.

<br /><br />Close my eyes to see it when the
<br /><br />World gets dark
<br /><br />Got a memory of you I carry in my soul
<br /><br />I wrap it close around me when
<br /><br />the night get cold
<br /><br />If you asked me how I'm
<br /><br />doin&quot;...I'd say just fine
<br /><br />But the trust is Baby, if you
<br /><br />could read my mind
<br />Not a day goes by that I don't think of  you
<br /><br />After all this time you're still
<br /><br />with me it's true
<br /><br />Somehow you remain locked so
<br /><br />deep inside
<br /><br />Oh Baby not a day goes by
<br />I still wait for the phone in the
<br /><br />middle of the night
<br /><br />Thinkin' you might call me if
<br /><br />your dreams don't trun out
<br /><br />right
<br /><br />And it still amazes me that I lie here in the dark
<br /><br />Wishin' you were next to me
<br /><br />with your head against my
<br /><br />heart
<br /><br />If you asked me how I'm doing I'd say just fine
<br /><br />But the truth is Baby,if you

<br /><br />There are several ways to break a heart, but to mend a broken heart is another thing to consider. Being the person who broke somebody else's heart is simple compared to the person experiencing heartache. Rejection is not always easy, especially if your in a relationship for a long time and suddenly the person you fell in love with sees you differently or isn't as in love with you as before. Without jesting, this can actually lead to death especially if the person will not move on. Moving on is a complicated process. Leaving all things that you have become familiar with- constant wake up calls, sweet nothings even the petty fights- will be terribly missed. It would be tough but you have to try. There are several ways on healing a broken heart, some would avoid the pain and refrain from going to places or looking at things that reminds them of the person. Throw everything that was given to them or erase the number on their mobile phone though erasing the number won't work since you know it by heart. Others would be the opposite, they would embrace the pain remember everything, until the pain would be tolerable. The second option is pretty bold, that it normally happens after you tried to forget everything. Everyone has their own choices but one factor that can make the healing easier is the manner on how the break up was done. It might be out of our hands on how the second party broke up with you, but it is one aspect to consider.. When there is a proper closure or the person explained all the necessary &quot;whys&quot;, it would be easier to accept. But if the person just left you without explanation, you'd be left wondering and anger would fill you. Some would say that proper closure takes time to heal as well, for the reason that all that was left are good memories and the other party still wants friendship which would makes a person hope when there is nothing left to hope for. While if anger fills you then you wouldn't want to have any connection which would make it easier, but then again people has different ways on handling emotional problems so in the end it would still be your choice. Since loving someone can lead to a great deal of pain, it would be smart to have some precautions. First would be to love yourself more and not giving a hundred percent of attention to your partner, hence when a break up happens you would still have strength to move on because your life did not revolve around your partner so much. Second is have time for friends, don't leave your friends out of your relationship, because before your partner appears they are already there, your first relationship and they would also be the one to help you if things go differently. Finally you need to trust the One above that everything is within reason and if you move on with your life you'll understand why.
