Your choices are to not eat, eat something you really don't want, or pay full price for pizza. When you really want this dish, you are probably going to order some. Don't call for your pizza until you read about the ways to get pizza discounts and save money.<br /><br />One easy way to get pizza discounts is to make a phone call to the pizza place and see what sort of specials is being offered. Generally, they will have at least one special going on. The big pizza companies -- Papa John's, Pizza Hut, and Domino's -- offer specials that change every month or so. They come up with new dishes and new pizza discounts that they advertise to get customers in the door.<br /><br />You can also get pizza discounts by simply reading your mail that you may have been throwing away. Most companies making this food pay big bucks to have coupons go out to consumers. You may get these coupons in your mailbox through direct mail, which targets customers who have been to the store before, coupon books in the mail, in the paper, or even coupons that are left hanging on your front door. Paper advertising is a way for companies to save money especially if they are not one of the big pizza companies and want to get their name out there.<br /><br />You can also get discounts by going online and visiting the websites of the brands you love.
