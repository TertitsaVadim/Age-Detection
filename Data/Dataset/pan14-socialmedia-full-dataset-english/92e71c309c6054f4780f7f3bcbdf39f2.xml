Divorces have become a common way of life.   It is no surprise that in all of the western countries divorce rates are very high.Does this reflect well on all of us?Sociologists and psychologists do not think so.  Definitely some groups who argue for their individual liberty and freedom are not going to agree.  Divorce is definitely the solution but only when there are irreconcilable differences and total incompatibility between the couple. When two people are made differently and are not able to live with each other, it is always better to part ways amicably rather than loose one’s peace of mind.   But how many divorces take place really for the right reasons and not for the satisfaction of one’s ego or due to one’s anger etc.  Sociologists believe that against each divorce that takes place for the right reasons, more than four divorces happen for the wrong reasons and based on flimsy grounds that are not really valid.<br /><br />If a young and newly married couple are heading towards the divorce courts in the first or second year of marriage, then it is quite probable that the grounds on which they are seeking divorce needs to be looked into.  Many times young couples who are newly married end up approaching the courts after an emotional outburst or argument in an emotional angry state of mind. Marriage is a pact where there is no winner or loser but both are equal partners.  If in a marriage there is no me and mine but we and ours, then the couple are on the right track.  It is when one begins to put this self interest ahead of the other and pursues his satisfaction independently that the balance in the marriage is tilted.   With such an attitude the marriage cannot succeed in the long run.<br /><br />Handy strategy: For much more info try Podcasts.  Podcasts are similar to net radio shows.

The recent generations tend to consider divorce as an easy option to get out of an arrangement that doesn’t work for them.    In case of women we can see a paradigm shift in their thinking which has come about due to their education and economic freedom which has given them an identify and empowered them too, thus making it possible for them to think of divorcing their partners if the relationship is not working out. Today’s women are very clear sighted and know what they want for themselves and will not waste time or compromise any longer. Self identity, respect, freedom as well as quality of life and independence seem to figure prominently in their psyche.  Women are self sufficient in all aspects including social, financial as well as emotional aspects and can manage their life very well alone. Women feel a lot more comfortable being divorced as there is no fear or stigma attached to them since the society has already accepted divorce as a way of life.   This gives the women a chance to seek what they want out of their life and lead their life in the way they wish to. <br /><br />If we agree that over the generations women have changed and evolved, can we say the same about men too?The traditional role play is no longer valid in a marriage.  Do all men out there understand that the expectation of women about themselves, about marriage as well as their relationship has changed.  Only when the man is able to respect and accept the role changes as well as learn to imbibe the new expectations of himself as well as his wife can the marriage survive and thrive. When men do realise and change themselves the divorce rates can definitely reduce.  <br /><br />Recommended resource:  <br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mullaw.com%2Fsee-the-firm-in-action"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.mullaw.com/see-the-firm-in-action</a> <br />  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mullaw.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.mullaw.com</a>

This does not auger well for the future generations as well as the present generation. But we seem to have closed the lid on this one. In fact a study has pointed out to the fact that the cases of psychosomatic disorders and psychological problems are increasing due to divorces.  Whether be it a woman or a man the problems faced by divorcees seems to be the same. <br /><br />The society was not the same earlier on and families were close knit and social sanction used to be sacrosanct.  People used to be religious and went in for pre marital counselling before getting married. Today things have changed, religion has taken a back seat and people have got economic freedom, cities have grown and double income families is the order of the day. People are too busy pursuing careers and managing a fast paced life that we have no time for religion anymore. <br /><br />Here is a quick resource before we continue:  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mullaw.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.mullaw.com</a><br /><br />Even individual identity is not spared by the changes that have happened on the economic front in our society.Earlier on people never thought of themselves beyond seeking personal interests.  Whether man worked out and woman worked at home to raise the family or both worked together it hardly mattered for there was no concept of me and mine. It is not the same today.  Everyone seems to have become of themselves and their priorities.  You only get to hear of individual identify, space and freedom etc in the society.

Women are also able to draw a line with regard to their roles and responsibilities on the home front are concerned. Be it providing and paying for the expenses, paying loans as well as looking after the children, women and men tend to be equal partners today. <br /><br />Whenever there is a change in the relationship, the balance tilts and the relationship as well as the institution of marriage gets threatened.  In the olden days there was no competition or fight for equality amongst the couple and it did not matter who contributed more to the family. Today with everything being equal, the individuals in a relation do not see the need to adjust or sacrifice for the wellbeing of the family and survival of the relationship.

Overall individual’s perceptions and identity as well as the social and family institution too has undergone tremendous changes.  With the advancement of technology and the so called urban life, our way of life too is getting more complicated.Money is fast becoming the key factor or the driving factor behind every decision. Thanks to money people seem to be becoming more and more individualistic and aloof. If you think carefully you will realise that the economic power empowers you to take your decisions in life boldly. This can also be a reason why divorce rate is going up in our society. Economic independence hinders their ability to make adjustments and practice values like giving and sacrificing etc.  When people start talking about their personal money and think for themselves the relationships take a toll. New norms are emerging in our society and the fact that couples get into pre nuptial agreements is an evidence of the changing times. Today’s families have moved away from the older generations where the family stayed together and owned and maintained their assets as well as resources collectively for the well being of the entire family.  The changing times have brought in the concept of nuclear family as well as couples who keep their assets and manage them independently for themselves. <br /><br />Let’s start with a quick resource:  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mullaw.com%2Fabout"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.mullaw.com/about</a><br /><br />Let’s take a look at numerous  useful  guidelines.<br /><br />Very clearly economic independence could be a major contributing factor enabling the individuals to seek divorce and get out of a relationship which is not to their advantage or which they feel is curbing their aspirations.

Long term relationship and being married for a lifetime are becoming history and a far away concept. <br /><br />Many people tend to think of divorce as just another event without realising its implications. Little do they realise what life changing impact the divorce is going to have on them. Every divorce sets forth emotional as well as financial implications for the parties involved.It helps the individuals to sit down and look at their financial planning post divorce and see if it is really worth going in for a divorce on emotional basis. Cost of living being high, it is quite costly for an individual to maintain a home on his own and also pay for children’s expenses too. Moreover the couples definitely go through their own emotional trauma in having to deal with their issues and this can distract them from their career and their health too takes a toll.  To get away one might have to leave the city and try to find a job and settle down in a new place altogether.  Having to face intense emotional distress, people often fall sick and start failing at their jobs at office too.Some people lose the drive they have had in chasing career and financial goals. <br /><br />People have options before the final divorce  to relook at their life, what it is going to be in the future, whether financially it makes sense to divorce or not and if they are taking a emotional decision they still have the chance to make amends and change their circumstances for the better. <br /><br />A fantastic supply of details could be identified making use of RSS feeds through an RSS reader.  <br /><br />Right here are a couple RSS directories to have a go with: WeBlogAlot.com or<br />RSS-Network.com<br /><br />RSS is short for Real Simple Syndication and is really a vehicle for people today to swiftly get new data, news or other very good stuff with out being forced to wade through lots of net pages.

On a moral standpoint, a number of acceptable reasons for divorce proceedings may be physical mistreatment, infidelity and other motives that may put the life of the spouse or even of the children at risk. However, other reasons for example, no longer having the ideal amount of income, incompatibility, no longer communicating and in many cases having lifestyle variations is just something that is incredibly small and for me, is simply a normal part of any union.

Many people think that merely the money and the family’s things will be split between the spouses; sadly, the divorce may also make sure that both can have an equal share regarding debts too. Equally, spouses will have equivalent responsibilities and though they might easily adapt as a result, the kids who will be segregated from their mother and father will soon face a hard life ahead.
