<br />If you're ugly,
<br />stop acting like you don't know it.
<br />The captions under you picture that says
<br />&quot;top model pose&quot;
<br />&quot;sexy bitch&quot;
<br />&quot;arnt i hot&quot;
<br />doesn't convince anyone.
<br /><br />Two.
<br />To the people who have like 25,000 friends,
<br />are you serious?
<br />Nobody in this universe can keep up with that many friends.
<br />You're stupid.
<br />Go play in traffic.
<br /><br />Three.
<br />Don't ever post pictures and say
<br />&quot;OMG, I'm so ugly&quot;
<br />&quot;OMG,I'm so fat&quot;
<br />because if you were,
<br />you wouldn't post them.
<br /><br />Four.
<br />Nobody cares about threats over the internet.
<br />Don't try to act hardcore with the keyboard.
<br />Fighting online is like racing in the special olympics;
<br />even if you win,
<br />you're still retarded.
<br /><br />Five.
<br />Making 20 bulletins a day
<br />about how you have new pictures
<br />and begging people to comment on them is pathetic.
<br />Make the bulletin once if you have to,
<br />and those who actually care about you
<br />will comment on your pics.
<br /><br />Six.
<br />If all your pictures look the same,
<br />don't post them all.
<br />Please put some variety in your pics.
<br />Nobody wants to see your face
<br />8 different ways.
<br /><br />Seven.
<br />Who really cares if
<br />I don't accept you as a friend?
<br />MOVE ON!!!
<br />Don't send me another request or message asking
<br />&quot;what's up with you not adding me?&quot;
<br />I don't want you as a friend;
<br />that's what's up!
<br /><br />Eight.
<br />Little 6th graders who have pages
<br />and look like sluts,
<br />go somewhere else
<br />because nobody wants you here.!!!
<br /><br />Nine.
<br />If you have decided to read this,
<br />you are a true Friend.
<br />Real friends read their bulletins.
<br /><br />Ten.
<br />I say you go and pass this on
<br />and maybe it will finally get through people's brains
<br />(if they have them).
<br /><br />Eleven.
<br />And if you open a msg and it says something like
<br />&quot;Repost this in 100 seconds or a ghost will rape your dog tonight,&quot;
<br />IT'S NOT REAL!
<br />QUIT BEING AN IDIOT!!!!!!!!
<br />PEOPLE WHO HAVE NO LIFE WHATSOEVER MAKE THAT SHIT UP THINKING THAT PEOPLE WILL FALL FOR THEIR STUPID TRAP!!! AND YOU DO!!!!
<br /><br />This is a test to see how many people
<br />in your friends list
<br />actually pay attention to you.
<br /><br />&quot;like omg if u dnt repost dis in 1 second at midnte/ and if you do at midnight your true love will...SHUTUP U FUCKIN ARSEHOLES!!! shit aint gonna happen
