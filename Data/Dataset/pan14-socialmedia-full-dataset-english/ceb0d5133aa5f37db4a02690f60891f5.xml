While you can hire an expert dog walker, sometimes it's also possible to recruit a neighbor, even a very young neighbor, to fix by sometime in the early afternoon to take your puppy for a walk.<br /><br />There are two vital skills or traits to consider: Responsibility and an love for dogs. Responsibility is in fact more important. Whoever you hire might have your dog's life on their hands during the hike. If you live in a peaceful suburban neighborhood and get a calm or aged dog, your dog walker's job will be much less demanding than in the event you live in a town with cars whizzing by and get a large, high-energy pet that can easily overpower anyone lower than 150 pounds.<br /><br />The other critical issue with responsibility is that whoever you hire will have access to your home. Again, if you live in a small, safe neighborhood, this may not be described as a problem at all. If you live in a semi-dangerous section of a major city, it could be a concern. While it's an added expense, you should think about getting a keyless entry system installed on your front door. A good one will definitely cost about $85, and you'll have to spend another $85 to obtain it installed, but you'll then be able to just give your walker, and anyone else you have to let in a special code (their own personal code for the higher systems) and they will be able to get themselves in, virtually no keys involved. If you ever ought to fire them, just switch the code. That way there are no keys to reclaim, and you won't have to change the locks.<br /><br />The easiest method to ascertain responsibility is as a result of references. Never, ever hire a walker without checking at least two of their references. Good, experienced dog walkers can have at least three references they are able to give you immediately. If they hand you a sheet of twelve different references during your interview with them, most of the better. When you telephone the references, ask just how long the dog walker has been walking the person's pet. Ask if they have ever endured any problems. Ask for a description of the person's pet (young, old, effective, over 80 pounds, etc). If you want your puppy walker to do any training, or to feed the dog during their visits, or to be able to take the dog to the vet (which plants be ready to do if you would like good emergency preparedness), then ask the pet owner if the dog walker has done all of these services for them.<br /><br />When you can spare the time, this is the really good idea to screen and interview three different dog walkers. That way you are more likely to pick a truly excellent dog walker, not just someone who was &quot;good enough&quot;. Dog Walkers City is the webs premium website for Dog walkers and sitters.

The time spent from the leash is an excellent opportunity to refine dog obedience skills, and usually you may only pay a few extra dollars more.<br /><br />Finally, your dog walker ought to be insured. During your job interview, they should probably hand you a sheet that explains the important points of their insurance. If they cannot, that does not mean they are not a good dog walker (the most effective ones are more dedicated to your dog than on business details), but do request that you'll get the information in writing before you hire them.
