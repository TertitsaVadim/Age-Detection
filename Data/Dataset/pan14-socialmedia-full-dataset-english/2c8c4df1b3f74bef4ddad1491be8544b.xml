This restaurant may be small, but the food was delicious, I like the Italian taste and style,so I choose Jack's Place.
<br />     I chose the borscht and sandwiches.Borscht tastes thick which includes celery, beef, potatoes, tomatoes and onions and tastes evocative. I was surprised that one plate has two big sandwiches and some fries.The quantity of food for me a lot! Sandwiches include turkey, spinach leaves, tomatoes and cucumber pieces.Slice of bread with fried golden, crisp and delicious.I like ate sandwiches with some ketchup and tasted very good.
<br />      The Italian foode is different from Chinse food.Approach is very simple and also delicious.The main method of cooking fried and boiled,but the food looks very tempting.Italian food tastes light and Nanjing food tastes heavy, so I was somewhat used to eating this kind of sandwiches.
<br />      This restaurant environment was elegant, european-style lamps and neat tables and chairs in the restaurant. On the walls,there are the maps and landscapes of Italy. On the glass windows  someone writed I Love Italy.Make me feel the Italian style.
<br />      Another peole also chose nice food at Jack's Place.But I only remembered  Sarach ate pasta and a chocolate chess cake.Bella ate a cup of hot chocolate, a company sandwich and a plate of wings.The  good attitude of every waiters,I want to recommed to other friends to eat there!
<br />      That day,we ate happy and talked with Cherry many things about study at future,talked to each other about interesting things in our school life.I couldn't forgetten this dinner!</div>

I choose this restaurant because not only was it featured on the Nanjing Map magazine, but it was also very close to our school. For dinner, I chose a pizza pie and a bowl of borscht. In the borscht, there were celeries, beef, carrots, and tomatoes. However, I didn't like my food very much. Maybe because it was different from what I usually eat and I wasn't accustomed to the taste. I especially didn't like the tomatoes in the borscht. They smelled very bad and I didn't like the taste of the tomatoe sauce. Although the pizza looked delicious and the cheese was great, I also didn't like the tomato in the pizza pie. Usually, when I eat tomatos, they are cooked. Here, they were not only raw, but also not cooked with meat or other things, so it tasted terrible to me. However, I did enjoy the free bread that was served with the pizza and borscht. 
<br />I liked the environment in Seecros. The yellow light in the corners of the restaurant made me feel very warm inside. The wooden tables and chairs and many wine were surrounded by a large trellis. There were a few fireplaces and some pictures hung on the wall. There were also a TV that played the promotion of the restaurant. The general atmosphere was good. 
<br /><br />At the restaurant, we saw some foreign friends having dinner. They were eating fruit salads and drinking wine. At Seecors, the waiters and waitresses are very enthusiastic. They introduced the food to us very carefully. The restaurant also had a band that played live music. So if one wanted to celebrate, one can have a big party at here. I saw some people having a party here on the restaurant TV. 
<br /><br />Although the food was not good, I recommed people to come here to have parties because the environment here is really a perfect for hosting parties.

Since the weather was sunny, I thought it would be great to visit the Garden of Love, a flower show displayed around Xuan Wu Lake. It was already around sunset when I first arrived at the flower show. There were many different colored tulips from Netherlands. From afar, the colors of the Flowers mixed together like the rainbow and covered the Earth like a beautiful blanket. As the wind blew, the tulips swung like the elves swung their heads. I held a flower close to smell it. It had a nice scent. When I squated down in the flowers field to take photos, it mades me think of the movie, Alice in Wonderland, especially the scene where the small Alice was in the big flower field. 
<br />The tulips were bigger than the other flowers at the show. Its stamen and pistals are clearly identifiable and it is shaped like small bowls. There were bees and butterflies flying around the flowers. As the sunlight shown on the tulips and through the petals, it made flowers even more beautiful. The flower show was very exciting and I enjoyed it a lot. I think life is also lilke these flowers: wonderful and nice.

The first place I’ve been volunteered was Nanjing Library.  It was the first time I do the work of arranging books on the shelves because I was a new volunteer and did not know anything about the library.  My supervisor requires that each row of books must align and cleaned properly.  And I must put back books in the reading room to their original location. That was not tired work and easy to did it. However, I get more familiar at my second time there.  Considering my hard work during my volunteer time, I received a hard work at Nanjing Library. 
<br /><br />I went to Nanjing Library just two times, and that's why I wasn't sure that where should each kinds of books go.  To get familiar with shelf tags and accorded to the numbers of book to put them back was my work.  I brought a wheelbarrow and put many books in it.  I also helped people to find books they needed to read.  Although the work spent a lot of time and was tired, I was proud of my volunteer work because helped many other people.  In fact, Nanjing Library needs a lot of volunteers every day, because there were hundreds of people reading book at there. 
<br /><br />Old people, children and some workers for made buildings were most common readers at Nanjing Library.  Therefore, before I became a volunteer, the librarian told me what kinds of books in the room where I work, and how to classify those books in the room. My volunteer work was arranging books so that readers would be able to found them more easily.  I also gave them some advice when they are in difficulty to choose books.  I was required to smile to those readers, and be patience to guide them.  My work created a comfortable environment for readers to read books. I enjoyed do volunteer in Library.
<br />My friends and I also went to Children’s home during school days.  They, because of illness or lack of parents, were sent to this Children’s home liked as an orphanage.  Our work was playing with and taking care of them.  The age of children mostly was 1~2 years old.  It was easy to coax them to eat or went to bed to have a nap.  However, we needed to pay attention to many details about taking care of them.  They could not drink very hot water or eat big pieces of food.  Therefore, what we must do was preparing food liked in the form of paste, and tasting water to make sure it’s not hot.  We also practiced how to embrace children to make them feel comfortable.
<br /><br />Children’s home adopts 20~30 children each year, they need more volunteers to help them taking care of children.  Our work was not only taking care of them, but also propagandizing ideas about donating clothes for children.  My friends and I also brought a lot of books, clothes and toys for children.  After my work, I could not forget them.  I'm so sympathetic to their encounter when I saw full of fear in their eyes.  As a result, I figured out that warm and happy families were important and need all of us to cherish.  Their naive smiles make them looked like angles, so I tried my best to make them happy during my volunteer time.

Helping decorated Halloween Party was my first volunteer work in school.  I helped dressing up classrooms and a hall with a beautiful garden.  We put some scary masks and electronic toys had appalling sound on the wall.  We glued black cloths to cover all glass windows.  Then we draw bats and grimaces used fluorescence on the cloths.  I also dressed up like a ghost at the Halloween party.  That was my first time doing such work, and I felt excited. 
<br /><br />After mid-term exam, I worked as a volunteer at the parents meeting at afternoon.  There were many parents came to the meeting and they would like to talk with teachers about their children.  Therefore, school created a rule that the time of each parents to talk with a teacher was only five minutes.  I acted as a timer for my Social Studies teacher Mr. Smith.  I noticed that some parents were very sorrowful and anxious about their children’s terrible behavior on study.  Some students personally to asked teachers why they could not get their ideal marks.  I would also give parents some study advice when they ask me. 
<br /><br />One month after the parents meeting, Christmas Day was coming!  I never forget the period of one week before Christmas Eve. My friend Rosella and I were planed and draw a poster for countdown Christmas! We spent one day to draw our poster in the art room. At the beginning, we just found picture about Christmas tree and wanted to draw on the paper. However, we thought the poster not enough new and original. Added many gifts under the tree and draw a lot of stars in the sky. We also toning warm colors to draw the whole poster, like as red, yellow and orange. 
<br /><br />Actually, I have never done any volunteer work at school before.  These experiences were new and wonderful to me.  During these volunteer work, I started knew the meaning in this sentence.  That was the more weeding the better the crop.  We had a wonderful and prefect Halloween party because we prepared everything we could think about beforehand.  Although volunteer work had some difficulties, we were delighted to see the happy result.  I learned how to negotiate and do better on cooperating with others during my volunteer time.  Of course, I also learned to challenge myself because I was afraid of ghosts.  However, I still accepted this task.  When I came close to people and hear them yell loudly, I found out that ghosts just have a scary face, not really as fearful as those in horror movies.  My volunteer work also helped school had a wonderful activity and brought deep impression to new students in our school.  I will continue to be a volunteer at school next year and hopefully I can receive more new experiences in my life.

This gallery was the best one in Nanjing and near my house and that's why I choose it to visit. Nanjing Art Gallery was behind Nanjing Library at Zhujiang Road.  Recently, there were three art exhibitions in this art gallery.  The first exhibition hall I visited was Fantastic Scenery.  It was an oil painting by a painter named Liu Guofu.  When we came in the whole exhibition hall, it was dark, huge and quiet. 
<br /><br />Only some yellow light illuminated on paintings.  Some people took notes on the papers, maybe they were writing valuation about the painting.  I was interested in drawing, so visiting art exhibition was joyful.  Liu Guofu’s painting does not show us exact objects.  When we looked at his painting, we could not immediately understand what he wants to show.  His painting somewhat like impressionist works.  Although I could not actually understand the true meaning behind his painting, I still could feel the atmosphere of his art.
<br /><br />Liu Guofu was different from other painters.  He does not like prosperous and noisy cities.  He chooses to leave his city and visited remote countryside or beautiful nature.  Therefore, his painting brought us to a fantastic world.  Firstly, I saw the two paintings were moonlight and sunshine.  The light illuminated on the leaves of which grew up on a huge tree.  No more drawing about animals and human on it, just light.  However, I felt myself being in a wonderland because the light brought me peace and relaxation. 
<br /><br />My favorite work about him is a group of paintings about an old women’s silhouette in a forest.  Liu Guofu did not draw clearly about her face.  Instead, he drew a small figure.  However, four paintings used different colors from warm color to cold tonal.  It likes as morning to night.  Her silhouette was from close to far away.  The whole group of paintings gives me a kind of hazy beauty.   I also could felt that woman was lonely and made me have pity for her. 
<br /><br />I stand three meters away from the painting for a long time to enjoy it.  It was easy to look at the whole picture on the painting.  Liu Guofu’s painting usually uses either dark or light colors.  Two different colors contrasts each other like as one painting used white, black and dark grey.  It is noticeable that some ominous feeling hides in those peaceful painting.  Sorrowful, hopeless and a little horrible feeling with his painting brush composed a wonderful painting.  I also walked closer to watch the painting.  Forceful brushwork and messy lines together makes the image spacing stronger.
<br /><br />I really enjoy the Fantastic sceneries on his painting.  The powerful and strong color leaves me with unforgettable feelings.  It was a wonderful art show.

It was the same day which I visited Fantastic Scenery.  However, this photographs show was at a different exhibition hall.  Comparing with the exhibition halls where held the Fantastic Scenery, this exhibition hall was bright and a little crowded.  Her photos were behind a large glass screen was protected.  Photographs were different from Liu Guofu’s oil painting.  Clearly sceneries and colours gives us different feeling.
<br /><br />Sibylle Bergemann started her photographing life at the sixties.  She took photos for different news magazines at first.  Sibylle Bergemann wanted to use her photos show us common social phenomenas in her country.  Painting could make us to have some illusion about its picturesque scene.  Photographs were showing us reality in our lives.  There were nine areas at this photographs exhibition.  There were women, fashion photographs, dream work, Berlin, stay at foreign land, places, white race girls, Africa Arabia and monuments.
<br /><br />The first area I saw was name Women.  They were all black and white photos.  Six different photos showed us different kinds of women.  The photo of Mailer was my favorite.  She had a beautiful and distressed face.  Her white and tight skin makes me feel about clean and elegant of her.  Her cold and bright eyes make her like a noble woman and had a prefect quality.  However, her black clothes make her look very thin.  Sibylle Bergemann used her camera perfectly present this entire woman. 
<br /><br />I could not forget the area in her photographs named Places.  There were still black and white photos.  Sibylle Bergermann caught light very well in her photos. Therefore the whole feeling about her photos liked as old photos.  I still remembered one picture that was a woman on a balcony laughing.  However, her background was a big city with many tall buildings.  Her smile was optimistic and liked as sunshine illuminated the whole photo.
<br /><br />Sibylle Bergemann takes photos about not only human and nature sceneries, but also some touching moment.  We could look at their eyes and background who was in the photos.  Through their feeling could know what was what Sibylle Bergemann actually wanted to tell us.  How she feels when she took these photos.  Just like she said, “My interest is in the edge of the world and not the center of the world. The most important is everything cannot instead of these feeling in the photos. For example, the unique moment of a scenery or a expression.”

I still remember when I choose these two clubs; they both gave me a wonderful plan about how they organized their clubs.  The beautiful photos and their explains both attracted me to joined.  Until now, I was proud of to be a member of their clubs.
<br /><br />Cooking Club is one of my favourite club.  Before I joined in these clubs, I was interested in cooking and learned some cooking with my mom.  I learned how to make biscuits after I joined Cooking Club.  We went to a cooking shop teaches people how to cook.  The cooker prepared colorful dough had fermented beforehand.  Dough was made of butter, sugar, food colors and some oil.  Different color had different tastes.  When I touched the dough, there were much oil on my hands and it was hard to hold them.
<br /><br />We used rolling pins to smashing dough, made them liked as circles.  The thickness of dough must be about three millimeters.  If it’s too thick it could not be cooked very well.  If it too thin it would burned.  However it was hard for me to do it, I could not make them having the same thickness.  I needed care and patience to smash dough.  We also use cute shape models to make beautiful and interesting shapes.  There were many kinds of shapes here, such as starts, hearts, trees and rabbits.  I liked dog bones and my biscuits were all this shape.  When I tasted my own biscuits, the sense of achievement appeared in my heart.  I could not use any words to describe how happy I was at that movement.
<br /><br />I decided to joined in Skating Club, because I was curious and interested about how could do things like people do in figure skating.  I never forget these beautiful actions about figure skating, so I hope one day I could do it.  It was harder than my illusions to learned skating.  The ice ground was too slippery and I could not know how to stand on it with my skating boots.  I held the wall and slowly skated.  However, another member of Skating Club taught me how to do it.  Gravity forwarding and knee bending could help me skating better than before.  Two feet gave each other power to sliding.  It is important to make sure to skate slowly and safely.  Although I could not do very well on skating, I still liked the feeling when I could do it!
<br /><br />The strengths of Cooking Club were those skills were practical and could use in my future life.  However some cooking needs too much time and I feel that I have limited time on my cooking.  I like skating club as an interest, I was not used more time on it.  If I will learn figure skating, maybe this skill brought me a lot of help.  However, I became brave to learn skating because I will fall down when I am careless.  Never give up trying and put my all efforts on learning skating.  That was what I really learned during skating time.

This restaurant was near Wutai Mountain was a famous gym at Nanjing.  Seeing it on Nanjing Map Magazine and recommended by our friends, we chose Paulaner Brauhaus.  We went to Paulaner Brauhaus at six o’clock and prepared to have dinner there.  Beautiful European type droplights spread the warm light on the long table.  Some wonderful and amazing pictures hung on the wall.  The whole restaurant makes us feel comfortable and warm to be in there.
<br /><br />A cheese pizza and a cup of hot chocolate was my food.  Although I didn't order a lot of food, it was enough for me.  This cheese pizza was different from pizza hut.  Not many fruit, meat and vegetable on the pizza.  There are two kinds of cheese on the pizza, and it tastes great.  Ketchup made pizza tasted a little sour and sweet.  Hot chocolate with butter foam was mellow.  However, I usually eat steamed stuffed bun as breakfast.  Steamed stuffed bun was put food in it and always with steamed way to cook.  Pizza is usually with cheese and cooked in the oven. 
<br /><br />I recommend this restaurant for people.  Not only me and my friend came to Paulaner Brauhaus, but also many foreign tourists like to go there.  I saw many pictures when they are holding parties there or had activities about celebrate Christmas.  Paulaner Brauhaus also had wonderful band, brought wonderful music to us when we ate dinner.

We found this restaurant at Internet and knew Kohinoor restaurant was great at cooking India and Pakistani Cuisine.  We have never had this kind of food before, so all of us decided to taste food at this restaurant.  The restaurant was small but beautiful.  Some clean desk with nice tablecloth makes us very comfortable.  The whole restaurant was illuminated by yellow and warm light.  The restaurant was permeated with sweet atmosphere.
<br /><br />The food I chose was named Paneer Tikka.  It is made by cheese, some chicken and cabbages.  Paneer Tikka was cooked with tandoori special spices.  Therefore it smelled delicious when the waitress put the food in front of me.  Maybe different country had different ways to cook their food.  The chicken for me was tasteless and hardened.  Cabbages had better tasted than chicken, because it had a little sweet and delicious.  Servers at Kohinoor restaurant could not spoke Chinses, but they had great English when we were chatting with each other.
<br /><br />Although I don't really enjoy the food, I still recommend people to come the restaurant.  They had a wonderful wall which hung many interesting and beautiful pictures on it.  I also went to many foreign tourists which from Europe ate at Kohinoor restaurant.  I thought that was a nice place to sit down and have a chat with friends.

I never changed other physical activities when I went to high school.  I was interested in these two kinds of physical activities and put my whole enthusiasm mood to do them. 
<br /><br />I started to learn street dancing which was named New Jazz, when I was a Grade10 student.  I saw my friends dancing beautifully and was sexy, so I began to learn dancing with the Mixie, who also taught my friends.  She was a young teacher who just twenty-four years old.  She was always patient to teach me actions which I often do wrong.  She told me, more practice could gain better result.  Her smile encouraged me to continue my dancing life. 
<br /><br />Until now, I have learned New Jazz for six months; my dancing was a lot better than before.  I often practice for a long time because an action was wrong.  However, I became confident when I look at my dancing in the mirror. Following the exciting music and start having prefect movements, that was enough to make me happy.  Put my all feeling into my dancing and gave people felt beautiful and sexy.  I was so proud of myself that I could do it like as I dreamed before. 
<br /><br />There are a lot of happy things I would like to remember.  It was my friend Eve had a street dancing competition and asked me to help her learned how to dance.  Actually, I never thought about one day, I could teach somebody.  I learned New Jazz for a few months and could not do prefect dancing with her.  Although I had some misgiving about teaching her, I still accepted her request.  Mixie told me, teaching another person dancing I could improve myself.     
<br /><br />Therefore I stared had more practice than before because I must not teach wrong actions to her.  I tried to use my way to explain to her how to dancing well.  What feeling she should have during dancing.  Each action repeated to do it until became wonderful.  After I knowing that she get second place in that competition, I became more enthusiastic to learned New Jazz.  I really hoped one day could have bravery stand on the stage.
<br /><br />I play badminton just because my mom liked it.  She always takes me to gymnasium and teaches me playing.  Following the time past, I gradually like playing badminton.  Sometimes I have a small badminton competition with my friends.  I could receive distant badminton because I had not enough power.  Maybe I am not spent as much effort as I am learning dancing.  I knew I still need time to improve my skills.  I also believe I could do better after my practice.

His concert was held at Olympic sports center which was a famous gymnasium in Nanjing.  It was my first time going to a concert by myself.  I arrived at the venue of concert at half past seven in the evening.  Jay Zhou was my favorite singer because all of his songs were written by himself.  He was fashionable and talented.  His songs are always sounds very attractive.  Jay Zhou started his singing career in 2000, so 2010 was his the tenth anniversary of his debut.  That was why I choose and looked forward to watching his concert.
<br /><br />I was really excited when he appeared on the stage singing the song.  Nobody sat quietly on the chairs, all stood up and crazy yelled out his name.  Gorgeous and three-dimensional stage brought us to a fantastic world of music.  The magic visual stage with his unique voice perfect showed his style.  Many florescence stick were swing like huge sea waves at dark night when he was singing.  All of us sang with him and forget who we were at that movement.

EXPO was held in Shanghai and its theme was “better city, better life”.  This was the first time that China host EXPO.  All pavilions were demolished at the ending of EXPO except China Pavilion.  Many friends also suggest me to go to EXPO because there were many beautiful pavilions at there.  Therefore, we decided to visit EXPO.  We visited EXPO in the morning because there would be fewer people.
<br /><br />We must wait in a long line for many hours to visit buildings.  The weather was still hot in September, so chairs, hats and fans were most important tools to people who were waiting for getting in pavilions.  Different pavilions showed different style of this country.  They have not only colorful and wonderful appearances, but also many amazing science and technology from each country.  My favorite pavilion was China pavilion.  I still remembered the house model for different era.  The first one was made of soil and rice grasses, it looked like easy to fell down.  However, the last one became splendid and wonderful.  I could see development of China when I watch these models.
<br /><br />The most amazing thing I saw was famous painting which was name Chinese Symphonic Picture Riverside Scene at Qingming Festival.  People made this painting became cartoon that means that the people in the painting change the color of the sky by moving the painting.  When I watched it, I felt that I returned to the era which painting was showing.
<br />EXPO was not only composed of interesting and wonderful pavilions, but also made us to feeling another countries local conditions and customs.  It widened our visual field and increased our knowledge.  The journey of EXPO was a memorable and priceless experience.

Environmental Protection Club members and teachers were planting trees with me.  We went to Tian Shengqiao Park which was at Li Yang.  We went to Tian Shengqiao Park in the afternoon with an old coach.  It was my first time planting trees, and teachers told us that planting more trees could gave more power to protect environment.  Every one held one heavy spade and one sapling to find places to plant.
<br /><br />My friends Joy and I found a place near hillside.  There were many people planting trees so it was hard to found empty land.  Although near hillside was a little danger, it was a great place to plant our saplings.  At the beginning, we all thought planting trees was an easy thing to do.       
<br />However, the soil was too dry so hard to made a pothole.  We used all energy to excavated soil but had just shallow pothole.  I tried to use my foot that maybe increase weight on spades.  However, the pothole just deep a little more. 
<br /><br />We finally found the right way to make the pothole; spades and ground should have a 45-degree angle.  Put saplings into pothole and hung our name card on our tree.  I suddenly looking forward my sapling became a beautiful tree.  Maybe after ten years, I will come back to look at my tree.  Until now, just wish it would growth well.

I seemed to see many angels flying in the church, God was blessing and protecting Christian.  My teacher Mr. Davis and Ms. Beath also had a chatting in that church.
