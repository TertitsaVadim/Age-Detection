<br />Tiny organisms called mycoplasma genitalium and ureaplasma urealyticum can live in the body without causing symptoms but sometimes they multiply quickly, leading to inflammation of the urethra. Being ill or stressed could cause this to happen. Up to 10 per cent of cases of non-specific urethritis are thought to be caused by ureaplasma urealyticum, and up to 25 per cent of cases by mycoplasma genitalium. It is thought these organisms may be transmitted sexually.
<br /><br />Some bacteria that live in the rectum and the mouth and throat can be passed on during sex and cause inflammation.
<br /><br />Bacteria that cause infection in the urinary tract (kidneys, bladder and urethra) or the prostate gland can lead to inflammation of the urethra.

<br /><br />BPH according to Chinese Medicine is categorized into diseases relating to urination. Historically there was no mention of an enlarged prostate. The Chinese had no way of knowing that a mans prostate was enlarged, but they were aware of the symptoms it caused. These symptoms of frequent nighttime urination, painful urination, and difficult urination were observed and thus categorized as disease categories which are used today to diagnose and treat BPH.

<br /><br />In some cases, premature and inhibited ejaculation are caused by psychological factors, including a strict religious background that causes the person to view sex as sinful, a lack of attraction for a partner, and past traumatic events. Premature ejaculation, the most common form of sexual dysfunction in men, often is due to nervousness over how well he will perform during sex. Certain drugs, including some anti-depressants, may affect ejaculation, as can nerve damage to the spinal cord or back.
<br /><br />Retrograde ejaculation is common in males with diabetes who suffer from diabetic neuropathy (nerve damage). This is due to problems with the nerves in the bladder and the bladder neck that allow the ejaculate to flow backward. In other men, retrograde ejaculation occurs after operations on the bladder neck or prostate, or after certain abdominal operations. In addition, certain medications, particularly those used to treat mood disorders, may cause problems with ejaculation.

<br /><br /><strong>1. Plan ahead.</strong>
<br /><br />Choose a date to stop <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline"><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVENNLU1hbGUvbGlzdDNfMS5odG1s" target="_blank">smoking</a></span></strong>, giving yourself enough time to create a plan and to elicit advice from other people who’ve quit. Then, write in a journal how often you smoke and under what circumstances — once you’re aware of your <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline"><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVENNLU1hbGUvbGlzdDNfMS5odG1s" target="_blank">triggers</a></span></strong>, you can come up with strategies to overcome them.
<br /><br /><strong>2. Pick your method.</strong>
<br /><br />No single approach works for everyone, and you may need to try a few strategies at once to attack the problem from different angles. Make sure you address both your physical dependence on nicotine as well as your emotional triggers (stress, anger, boredom). Log on to smokefree.gov to research your options.
<br /><br /><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/180423688_11246855_47743474.jpg" />
<br /><br /><strong>3. Create new routines.</strong>
<br /><br />Since smoking is a part of your day, you’ll need to form new habits. Chew gum instead of taking a drag after lunch, or play a computer game in place of your <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline"><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVENNLU1hbGUvbGlzdDNfMS5odG1s" target="_blank">cigarette</a></span></strong> break. Avoid situations associated with lighting up — go to smoke-free restaurants, and if you puff away in your car, have it detailed to get rid of the smell.
<br /><br /><strong>4. Get support.</strong>
<br /><br />You are the only one who can make yourself stop smoking, but surrounding yourself with friends, family, and fellow quitters can help you get through tough days. Pick someone who really wants you to kick the habit and make him or her your go-to person when a craving hits. Or call 800-QUIT-NOW to talk to a quit coach in your area.
<br /><br /><strong>5. Think positive.</strong>
<br /><br />Know that each day you get through without smoking is an accomplishment. Keep yourself inspired to stick with it by reminding yourself that your reasons for quitting (more on that below) are bigger than your cravings — and that you’re capable and strong enough to make this a lasting life change.

It is equal to treasury f national state. Therefore, we should be good at storing essence and qi. Then how to protect our kidney? It is sure asthenia and weak pulse when kidney qi is weak.
<br /><br /><strong>Sexual intercourse should be controlled</strong>
<br /><br />First, sexual intercourse should be controlled. Intemperate sexual intercourse is harmful to kidney essence and kidney qi, especially after husbands and wives are middle ages, sexual intercourse should be controlled carefully.
<br /><br /><strong>Brain should not be used in excess</strong>
<br /><br />Second, brain should not be used overly. Kidney growing marrow, brains grow through kidney. Kidney qi will be injured if brain is used overly.
<br /><br />For instance, many dizziness are not problems of brain, in the final analysis is kidney deficiency. Some patients see me because of dizziness; I will give him some Liuweidihuang pills and flavor prepared rehmannia root, the fruit of Chinese wolfberry, FRUCTUS CORNI and so on to invigorate the kidney. Symptoms mainly will be improved, and then he is no longer dizziness. There is no one flavor which invigorates brain in these medicines. I do not use medicines which nourish brain either but only invigorate kidney, then dizziness can be cured.
<br /><br />It is ineffective for some people who are insomnia take medicines which nourish the heart and calm the nerves. Sleep will be better naturally if they take some medicines which invigorate kidney and add some medicines which invigorate brain and sleep peacefully.
<br /><br /><strong>Take good care of waist</strong>
<br /><br />Finally, we should take good care of waist but not injury waist, because there is life gate of kidney deficiency - two kidneys in waist, which also should be ignored. Human has three treasures of essence, Qi and spirit, among them roots of essence and Qi-source qi and source essence are in kidney, and therefore you should take care of the warehouse but not let it leak water or catch cold.

Therefore if the kidney Qi is <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline"><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVENNLU1hbGUvbGlzdDRfMS5odG1s" target="_blank">turgor</a></span></strong>, energy is abundant, sinew bones are sturdiness, the step is brisk and state of mind is nimble.

<br /><br /><strong>Kidney is root of five viscera</strong>
<br /><br />The kidney is root of five viscera in human body, so five viscera should not be used excessively. If you have used kidney, it is none when five viscera and six bowels need it. It is equal to treasury f national state. Therefore, we should be good at storing essence and qi. Then how to protect our kidney? It is sure <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline"><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RjbWRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vVENNLU1hbGUvbGlzdDRfMS5odG1s" target="_blank">asthenia</a></span></strong> and weak pulse when kidney qi is weak.
<br /><br /><strong>Sexual intercourse should be controlled</strong>
<br /><br />First, sexual intercourse should be controlled. Intemperate sexual intercourse is harmful to kidney essence and kidney qi, especially after husbands and wives are middle ages, sexual intercourse should be controlled carefully.
<br /><br /><strong>Brain should not be used in excess</strong>
<br /><br />Second, brain should not be used overly. Kidney growing marrow, brains grow through kidney. Kidney qi will be injured if brain is used overly.
<br /><br />For instance, many dizziness are not problems of brain, in the final analysis is kidney deficiency. Some patients see me because of dizziness; I will give him some Liuweidihuang pills and flavor prepared rehmannia root, the fruit of Chinese wolfberry, FRUCTUS CORNI and so on to invigorate the kidney. Symptoms mainly will be improved, and then he is no longer dizziness. There is no one flavor which invigorates brain in these medicines. I do not use medicines which nourish brain either but only invigorate kidney, then dizziness can be cured.
<br /><br />It is ineffective for some people who are insomnia take medicines which nourish the heart and calm the nerves. Sleep will be better naturally if they take some medicines which invigorate kidney and add some medicines which invigorate brain and sleep peacefully.
<br /><br /><strong>Take good care of waist</strong>
<br /><br />Finally, we should take good care of waist but not injury waist, because there is life gate of kidney deficiency - two kidneys in waist, which also should be ignored. Human has three treasures of essence, Qi and spirit, among them roots of essence and Qi-source qi and source essence are in kidney, and therefore you should take care of the warehouse but not let it leak water or catch cold. If you take good care of kidney essence which stores inside, it will maintain your life. However, still many people are using waist in excess, the result of overly using kidney is injuring his kidney.
