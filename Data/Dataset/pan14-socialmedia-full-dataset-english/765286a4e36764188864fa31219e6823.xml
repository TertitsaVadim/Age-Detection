<br />Who goes there, nothing but wizened old trees blowing in the light breeze, with moon beams dancing on the wet grass,
<br />What adorning leaves I see blowing in the breeze, I squeeze my face on the window pane just a little more and watch the dripping torrents of liquid rain, gently cascading down my window sill,
<br />Tap tap the rain makes filling me with joy as the moon beam curtains drape in the sky, a flash reveals a golden eye, as the moon beckons me, with Diamond droplets once again racing and cascading and tapping on my window sill………..

<br /><br />I discovered when I wash my hair, the shampoo runs down my whole body, and printed very clearly on the shampoo label is this warning, &quot;FOR EXTRA VOLUME AND BODY.&quot;  No WONDER I have been gaining weight!!!
<br /><br />Well I got rid of that shampoo immedietly and I am going to start using &quot;Finish Dish Washing Liquid&quot;
<br /> instead, because Its label reads: 
<br />&quot;DISSOLVES FAT THAT IS OTHERWISE DIFFICULT TO REMOVE.&quot; 
<br /><br />Problem now solved, now I may NEVER get out the shower!   If I don't answer the phone, I'll be in the shower!

<br />Years of pain,  tears that rain down my face the more I hear, the more I die a little each day with your lies,
<br />I happened to chance and see the truth,
<br />Distorted mind you said I had and  distorted truth you burden me with and try to put the blame on me, 
<br />I shed the tears that could fill an ocean but they dried before you, my now lifeless eyes, a former self,
<br />I happened to chance and to see the truth.
<br />I watched dazed,I replaced my soul, who replaced me and finally I shall replace you, 
<br />I happened to chance and see the truth,
<br />I saw a vision to help myself, to save me,  save me, from a destructive life, with you,
<br />I happened to chance and see the truth,
<br />I saw a dream of passion no more, pain....deceit, but to embrace the darkness of the past, free my desire, my chains you have around me,
<br />I happened to chance and see the truth, 
<br />I feel enslaved by mistakes I've made in life, when I look into your eyes and see, a chance to see the truth, but your eyes have lied so many times before, I can't believe you anymore, your lifeless eyes a part of me, I happened to chance and see the truth,

<br /><br />Gone from here, I disappear. Away from pain, away from fear

<br />I now want to forget the past and remember the times, I use to smile with no worries, 
<br />now it seems so long in passing,
<br /><br />I want to feel strong once again, so look in to my eyes, and see my pain that I have left behind,
<br /><br />I am peering down the river and see myself playing, laughing a younger version of myself; skipping the stones of lifes hardship that come everyday once again finding a happy and contented part in life,
<br /><br />I now look into the river of life, I am now living again, I am touching the water, grabbing my reflection and freeze with my perfect reflection staring back with a new inner peace,
<br /><br />now I wish to consume and establish all I used to be, wish myself back to health, respect for my own truth and see life with new eyes.................

<br />I  saw your lips move, but could no longer hear your voice, I felt lost the moment you spoke to me that day that time,
<br /><br />My vision blurred, but now I see, clouds from heaven rained down upon my earth, no longer was I in control, of my senses, my being, falling just for me, Engulfing my pain, there was something different about that day, How I wish I could tell, how I felt the moment you lost me in time,
<br /><br />There was something different that day, about the way the wind blew; the way the sun shone in your hair, the way you moved, the way your smile looked into my soul, I was truly lost that moment, The last time the moment I saw you...

<br /> Christmas has already become too commercialized for me and many others, as the pressure builds and the cost on credits cards and cash get spent!  There’s huge pressure on people, particularly parents, to spend huge sums of money on presents for loved ones, on entertaining or for entertaining family at Christmas time. For many families, coping with the cost of Christmas requires money to be put on credit cards or an overdraft to be run up and then this needs to somehow be paid off in the new year, doom and gloom when it can’t be done! In the current troubled economic environment, this is a burden that many families could really do without. Interest rates souring and job guarantee are not what they once were!
<br /> To stand at a check out and watch someone assessing a purchase on two different credit cards was a sad moment for me to see. Then when you hear a discussion on how much should you spend on a present, sets you at which class you come from in society! Granted some people don't need to spend all of their money, but you like to be a part of society and feel you belong, and the want becomes a need. So many of us just follows what the next person does. Most people just get entangled up with what everybody else is doing and the media do have a lot more influence than we give them credit for. Some parents spend so much on their children and family to keep them from feeling out of place; (keeping up with the jones) we end up spending far more than we should or would have planned!
<br />I do like Christmas, once again, but not the society that makes you feel the cost of the present is most important! Write a budget, make some home-made chocolates etc or plan ahead. Are you going to be financial in 2012 with what you spent? I will be ok, will you this Christmas?

<br />It is a terrifying relief  to merge out in front, melting the edges of your being and becoming vulnerable to another and contributing punctuations of ecstasy of everyday happiness in deepening knowledge of the unknown, break out I know the fear of the unknown , let go and share to someone you know, love and trust, if you make a wrong judgement then see it as a learning curve, try someone else!!!

<br /><br />Yesterday I got my Tax Return &quot;Returned&quot;
<br /><br />I was trying to get a jump on doing my taxes this year,
<br /><br />however, the ATO sent my Tax Return back!! 
<br /><br />I guess it was because of my response to the line, which said:
<br /><br />&quot;List All Dependents&quot; 
<br /><br />So, I replied: 
<br /><br />1/2 million illegal immigrants 
<br />1/4 million crack heads 
<br />2  million unemployable people living on welfare
<br /><br />1 million people in over 123 prisons 
<br />and 
<br />353 fools in Parliament House and the Senate. 
<br /><br />Apparently, this was NOT acceptable..
<br /><br />So I sent it back with a question &quot;Did I forget someone?&quot;

<br /><br />A number of the girls were beginning to use lipstick and would put it on in the bathroom. That was fine, but after they put on their lipstick they would press their lips to the mirror leaving dozens of little lip prints .
<br /><br />Every night the maintenance man would remove them and the next day the girls would put them back . Finally the Headmistress decided that something had to be done ... She called all the girls to the bathroom and met them there with the maintenance man .
<br />She explained that all these lip prints were causing a major problem for the custodian who had to clean the mirrors every night (you can just imagine the yawns from the little princesses) ..
<br /><br />To demonstrate how difficult it had been to clean the mirrors, she asked the maintenance man to show the girls how much effort was required. He took out a long-handled squeegee, dipped it in the toilet bowl, and cleaned the mirror with it.
<br />The silence was broken by a large number of gasps, a few girls vomited and apparently someone fainted . Since then there have been no lip prints on the mirror .
<br /><br />There are teachers . . . And then there are educators.
