SVGA supports a screen resolution of 1024*768, 8-bit pixels and this interface works by using a 15-pin pinout.<br />Even though VGA cables might also use a 15-pin format, they are not the same as the SVGA pinout. Actually, the actual VGA pinout has become obsolete. <br />It needs to be mentioned that SVGA pinouts do not make use of all 15 pins. In fact, most are only 8 pin loaded.

Exactly what this meant for the customer was a 256-colour choice.<br />Needless to say, technological developments have resulted in these figures becoming insignificant because colour shading is now controlled by modifications in the analogue voltage.

What this does is literally divide the signal in two presenting multiple versions of the same image. This could be tailored to combine large banks of monitors if so desired.<br />One thing to remember is that whatever sort of SVGA cable or accessory is needed; always select one that has been produced from premium grade materials that are much more probable to stand the test of time. Better materials result in better all round quality, particularly when they have been manufactured by a trusted source.<br /><br />Resources<br />The article author enjoys a secure operating relationship with  ”<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.euronetwork.co.uk"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.euronetwork.co.uk</a>”  which is a highly regarded and proven producer and supplier of cable devices, wall plates,  ”<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.euronetwork.co.uk%2Facatalog%2FSVGA_Cables.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.euronetwork.co.uk/acatalog/SVGA_Cables.html</a>”  and products, with well over 20 years experience.<br />The Writer likes to keep up to date with the most innovative technological innovations by means of reading around the field in periodicals and journals.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.euronetwork.co.uk%2Facatalog%2FSVGA_Cables.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.euronetwork.co.uk/acatalog/SVGA_Cables.html</a>

Made popular by companies like Tupperware and Mary Kay, the industry has proven to be quite lucrative for many people.  With the economy looking grim, many Network Marketing companies are struggling to sell products and recruit distributors. However, this is not the case for  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2FShakeTheWeightOffChallenge.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://ShakeTheWeightOffChallenge.com</a> . <br /><br />In 2010, the executives with ViSalus decided to change how people join a network marketing company and these changes have changed the entire industry for good. <br />What are these changes?  Traditionally, a distributor would either promote the products or the opportunity primarily. ViSalus has taken this a whole other direction. Instead of leading with the products or opportunity, they researched the market and found that most people do not seem to care about either of those options. ViSalus decided to lead with a challenge also known as the Body By Vichallenge. <br /><br />Apparently this change in marketing has had a drastic effect on the company’s bottom line. ViSalus has grown over 3000% since January of 2011. It appears as though the wealth is being distributed widely throughout the company because over 700 promoters qualified for the BMW car bonus in September, 2011. <br /><br />With the economy looking increasingly poor, people are turning to entrepreneurship to not only survive but to sustain their finances. Companies like ViSalus offer a turnkey business with a small upfront investment. The two biggest differences between starting your own business and starting a business with a company like ViSalus is that all of the setup work has been done for you; logos, training materials, product manufacturing, and the legalities.

		<document id="b8675e7a941cc54aaa4b859d0af5415e" url=""><![CDATA[Italian Honeymoons<br/><br/>Here are six good reasons why a honeymoon holiday in Italy will be a honeymoon you will remember forever:<br />(1)	Italy is the home of classical music and has produced some of the world's greatest composers; Monteverdi, Vivaldi, Puccini, Rossini, the list goes on.<br />(2)	Western art was invented here and has produced some of the world's most famous works of art, from Leonardo's Mona Lisa to Michelangelo's David.<br />(3)	People make pilgrimages from around the world to taste Italian wine where it is grown.<br />(4)	The natural beauty in the countryside will take your breath away. <br />(5)	The food is a fantasia for the senses, which led my father to pronounce, “If you want to impress a girl, take her to an Italian restaurant; if you want to keep a wife, take her to Italy.”<br />(6)	Italy is the fashion capital of the world, and Gucci is just the beginning. The seductive synergy of these sensuous pleasures wakes the passionate and romantic spirit in all but the most stolid of hearts.<br /><br />A friend of mine once went on a belated  honeymoon to the island of Capri with his new wife. Upon his return we barely recognized him for the changes  the tranquility had brought about in him. His wife, we learned a couple of months later, was in for equally great changes because she was now expecting a baby. The magic of the place changed their lives. W. Somerset Maughm wrote “The Lotus Eater,” a story, in which a man becomes so enamored of Capri that he goes home, sells all he owns, and returns to live out the rest of his days-of course the tale has a twist, but you too might want to cash in and return, regardless of what happened in Maughm’s story. Yet if a beautiful Mediterranean island rich in scenery, history and art isn’t your ideal honeymoon spot, Capri is only one option for a honeymoon in Italy.<br /><br />The Tuscany region enhances the Italy honeymoon with magnificent natural views and scenery as well as a concentration of artistic wealth. UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Tuscany include the magnificent architecture of the Square of the Cathedral of Pisa, the bell tower of which is the famous Leaning Tower of Pisa where Galileo conducted his early experiments in gravitation; the historic center of Florence, where art so abounds that “genius abides on every corner”; the magnificent landscape of the Val d'Orcia; and the historic city centres of Siena, San Gimignano, and Pienza.<br /><br />Tuscan cuisine is home to what we knows as call the Mediterranean diet from which the Tuscans concoct delicious, rich dishes. In October and November in San Miniato they gather white truffles. For the unsinkable carnivore, the Chiana Valley raises superb beef for Florentine steak. Tuscany also produces such famous wines as Chianti. When I visited, Tuscany taught me that I traveled as much by eating and drinking well as I did by walking or taking the train, and that  sensuousness heightens any honeymoon holiday.<br /><br />But these are only two possibilities amongst the rich plethora of choices Italy offers the honeymooner. Rome is a city at once modern and ancient. Sicily abounds with Roman ruins, medieval castles, and restaurants serving exquisite food and wine. Still we have only scratched the surface because all Italy is revelry of the senses guaranteed to impassion any  honeymoon.<br />Resources<br />Italy has a lot to offer the romantic. For the very best choices of  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bridgewater-travel.co.uk%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.bridgewater-travel.co.uk/</a> contact  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bridgewater-travel.co.uk%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.bridgewater-travel.co.uk/</a> . Over the years, Bridgewater have built up a track record of offering a tailored service based on an in depth familiarity with the holiday properties and the areas they offer. A lot of their properties can be booked on the internet, but Bridgewater believe they offer individuals a personal service which computers can't.

This article investigates what the Blu-ray player actually is, whether or not it really has come to supercede the Dvd movie player, and how, simply by using a quality HDMI cable you may get the best out of this kind of player.<br /><br />Body<br /><br />We have seen a lot of talk with regards to Blu-ray and the way it has won the format showdown against the competition. Branded after the blue coloured laser beam used to read the disc and built to replace the DVD and render it obsolete, Blu-ray has recently become the choice method for playing and watching films after they have been released from the cinema. Blu-ray gives consumers the opportunity to experience motion pictures in high-definition as opposed to the conventional DVD quality movies we have become accustomed to. High-definition output is about four times that of standard giving you a good idea of why Blu-ray has been so eagerly anticipated. However, although its objective may be to replace the DVD player, its surge to such a position has both not yet been reached, and has thus far been rather slow-moving. <br /><br />First conceived of and introduced in 2000, Blu-ray players and movies in no way represent a dominant portion of the market today. Still reasonably pricey and not as easy to obtain as conventional DVD players, it may well be a little while before consumers actively choose a Blu-ray player over a Digital video disc player. Having said that of course, the features and benefits of a Blu-ray player are without a doubt good. Blu-ray is not just about high definition films but is also used to store Ps3 game titles and can be used as a standard storage device too. Blu-ray discs have a capacity of 25Gb for a single layer disc and 50Gb for a dual layer disc. Due to the high def nature of Blu-ray, in order to obtain the best from it will require connecting your Blu-ray player by way of a HDMI port.<br /><br />Any present day electrical item that supports high definition video and audio will come HDMI ready nowadays. Although a lot of HDMI supportable devices may come with their own HDMI cable not every one of them do. Moreover, many lovers of quality audio, video, and video games will not likely wish to use the OEM cables anyway and therefore will seek out higher quality HDMI cables, that may often be pricey.<br /><br />Virtually all of the movie companies have adopted Blu-ray and all modern films will be released on this format. Blu-ray drives are also available for computers so that Blu-ray discs can be used and burned on a P.C. At this time however, although Blu-ray players are readily available, they are expensive, which is the reason for many of us, the only form of Blu-ray player found in the vast majority of homes would be a Playstation 3.<br /><br />This will not always be the case however, and as prices decrease (as they usually do) more and more homes will have, Blu-ray players in their computer systems and home cinema systems. The best way to ensure uniform connectivity is to use a standard that is supported by just about all main appliance manufacturers such as the afore mentioned HDMI. HDMI cables tend to be utilised for numerous appliances and connect numerous devices such as the computer to the TV. For this reason, it is a wise course of action to ensure that the HDMI cable you select is the best you can afford.<br /><br />This does not mean that after you have spent all your money on a state of the art video game system you then have to spend another fortune on a monster HDMI cable. Rather, choose a HDMI cable that is built by a professional company yet still is able to keep costs as small as possible. In doing this you'll be able to take pleasure in your Blu-ray discs in all their high definition magnificence. In choosing your HDMI cable you have to try to remember that whilst price is a helpful indicator of the quality and sturdiness of the cable you are buying it is not necessarily conclusive. By browsing online sites such as Euronetwork you can find high-end HDMI cables for low end prices. If you have paid out for a new and exciting Blu-ray player, it would be a shame and a waste to let it down with an inferior HDMI connection.<br /><br />The author works closely with <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5ldXJvbmV0d29yay5jby51aw__" target="_blank">Euronetwork</a>, an experienced technology company supplying, amongst other great products, Quality HDMI cables to be used with Blu-ray players, TVs as well as many more electrical objects.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5ldXJvbmV0d29yay5jby51aw__" target="_blank">Blu-ray</a>

Take into account that in the food service business the harder responsibility you're taking the more money you stand to make.<br /><br />Externship is surely an unpaid intern-ship that some pupils may do after graduating where they are able to get experience and education employed in the food service industry. These externships play an important role in finding a high-paying/high quality job. Not too long ago a channel in the media began a show devoted to finding aspiring chefs and holding contests. Rendering it on to one of these shows nearly assures you a job in the market and a start along the path of your very successful career.<br /><br />One of the very most powerful assets in the sous chef’s career is education. Although, you could meet many chefs who did not attend culinary schools and worked their way up from humble beginnings. However, chef's who do have an education in cooking from the culinary school use a far better potential for landing a higher paying job as a school-trained chef. It's in your best interest to remain in school, because in college you will be exposed to many different styles of cooking along with food. You may also decide to obtain a specialised degree within the culinary arts or decide to become a certified food handler. Creating a food handler's license is a thing that more culinary schools are selling. A food handler's license also looks very prestigious over a CV as a result of concerns over food safety inside the press recently.<br /><br />Total-Caterer.com allows you to find the perfect sous chef job to suit your needs.

They’re where most of us spend our working day, our night’s sleep and our Sunday rest. Given we spend so much time inside them, it’s important to make sure they’re safe. History and daytime television are full of buildings that haven’t come up to scratch with often inconvenient, sometimes fatal, results. A measured building survey provides an accurate record of a building: a record which can be used for fire risk assessment, licensing and lease applications, refurbishment, extension or as built plans, or any number of the other tasks that require close examination of your building.<br /><br />Depending on what the client needs, a measured building survey can take a wide variety of forms. Modern laser scanning technology can produce 3D models of any building or structure, replicating in three dimensions all of its intricacies. Laser surveys can be used for floor plans or for a full 3D elevation.<br /><br />Two-dimensional elevations can also form a part of a measured building survey. These are traditionally a two-dimensional image depicting the exterior of the building and all its features in outline. Elevations can range from quite basic drawings of the major features down to brick-by-brick detail for those projects which need a greater level of detail, such as historic records. As well as laser scanning, digital photography and reflectorless technology can be used to produce elevations.<br /><br />Floor plans are perhaps the form of measured building survey with which the general public are most familiar from countless films, comic strips and the like. They show both the net and gross internal area of a building. They usually show major structural features (e.g. doors, windows, columns), but can also show more minor details (e.g. power outlets, vents, radiators) where necessary. Floor plans of existing buildings are most commonly used where refurbishment or space planning is being considered. As with elevations, reflectorless and laser technology are used to take measurements.<br /><br />Sections are, as their name suggests, cross sections of either an entire building or particular elements thereof. They can be produced in order to show a cross section of any part of the building and can show either visible detail, or additional aligned detail up to a certain distance away (e.g. the side of an arch and all structural detail that lies directly behind it). While sections are usually produced by combining and comparing information from elevations and floor plans, they can be produced independently for a measured building survey if required. Sections allow surveyors and others to directly asses the alignment of structural features and make any alternations that may be neccessary.<br /><br />Traditional - albeit high quality - photographs can also form part of a measured building survey. Detailed colour photographs highlight key parts of the structure and afford greater understanding in the interpretation of detail, particularly where those looking at them may not be able to make a site visit (e.g. councils assessing an application for planning permission, investors looking to expand their property portfolio, specialists in property law). Where once a series of flat photographs may have been used, nowadays a 360° panorama can be generated from a sequence of digital photographs, allowing users to zoom, rotate and explore the space in almost the same detail they would be able to were they actually there.<br /><br />There are a number of different elements that a measured building survey can incorporate depending on the client's needs. It can be a 3D model, a set of floor plans, a section or internal photographs. The product is an accurate and detailed record of all important details of the concrete cocoons in which we while away our days.<br /><br />This article was written in association with <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5zdW1vc2VydmljZXMuY29tLw__" target="_blank">SUMO Services</a>, purveyors of all of the measured building survey options detailed.

We all want to be kind to the planet and it would be nice if we could save a few pennies along the way. With current escalating fuel costs and a slow-moving economy, increasing numbers of families are finding it harder to pay fuel bills. Solar panels are an attractive option; they’re environmentally friendly, they can save you money and there are even grants available for their installation. Sadly, not all houses are suitable for solar panel installation.<br /><br />There are all sorts of extra regulations applying to buildings in conservation areas or World Heritage Sites. In many cases, solar panel installation will be considered a “permitted development”, meaning you won’t need planning permission but will have to stick to a few extra requirements;<br /><br />1)	As far as is possible, the panels should be sited so as to minimise their aesthetic intrusion. That is, try to make them as inconspicuous as possible.<br />2)	They shouldn’t affect the amenity of the area too drastically, i.e. the solar panels shouldn’t spoil those things that make the conservation area so attractive in the first place.<br />3)	If your solar panels are no longer in use, they should be removed as soon as possible. So, for example, if you sell the property and the new owner doesn't want to continue using the solar panels, they should be taken down.<br />4)	Make sure your solar panel installers do not fit them above the ridgeline. Neither should they project more than 200mm from the roof.<br />5)	Listed buildings will still require the usual consent for any work being done that changes the appearance of the building (just as if you were installing a satellite dish, for example).<br /><br />Non-listed houses and those outside of conservation areas do still have some regulations placed on them as regards solar panel installation. Obviously, the roof of your house has to be physically able to bear the weight of the panels. If your roof is in a poor state of repair, then it may not be strong enough to carry the weight, or may not offer a sufficiently secure anchor for the panels. Panels fitted to poor roofs can break the roof or even fall off. The strength of your roof will need to be checked and proven before you have solar panels installed. If it is not found to be up to scratch, then some strengthening or repair work may be necessary.<br /><br />Roofs will a northern aspect with a northern aspect are not suitable for the installation of solar panels because they do not get enough light. Neither are those which are completely in the shade{}. In such cases, solar panel installation would be a complete waste of time and money, as the panels would simply not receive enough sunlight to function.<br /><br />One also has to consider all the standard regulations regarding major electrical work. It’s advisable to get qualified solar panel installers in to check your house meets all of the essential requirements.<br /><br />Don't be put off solar panel installation. The majority of hosues will require no work to be done at all. Even if your roof does need a little repair work or strengthening, the cost will easily be offset by the savings you make from your own private source of renewable energy. The secret to green energy and lower fuel bills might be right above your head.<br /><br />Solar Days are professional solar panel installers with years of experience in all types of electrical and building work. If you want to save your planet and your bills, visit their website or soon to be opened showroom in Shrewsbury, Shropshire.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3NvbGFycGFuZWxzLXB2LmNvbS9ibG9n" target="_blank">Solar panel installers</a>
