<br /><br />TRUST is a very important factor for all relationships. When trust is   broken, it is the end of the relationship. Lack of trust leads to   suspicion, suspicion generates anger, anger causes enmity and enmity   may result in separation. 
<br /><br />A telephone operator told me that one day she received a phone call.   She answered, &quot;Public Utilities Board.&quot; There was silence. She   repeated, &quot;PUB.&quot; There was still no answer. When she was going to   cut off the line, she Heard a lady's voice, &quot;Oh, so this is PUB. Sorry, I got the number from my Husband's pocket but I do not know whose 
<br />number it is.&quot; 
<br /><br />Without mutual trust, just imagine what will happen to the couple if   the telephone operator answered with just &quot;hello&quot; instead of &quot;PUB&quot;.

<br />Some reasons why a modem is better than a woman:
<br /><br />A modem doesn't mind if you call another modem.
<br /><br />A virus you catch from your modem doesn't require a trip to the doctor.
<br /><br />You don't have to bring a modem home to meet your parents. If an error occurs, Abort, Retry or Fail are the only options you have to worry about.
<br /><br />Modems come with an instruction manual. Modems have a volume control - you can even turn the sound OFF.

<br />-------------------------------
<br />An English teacher was explaining to his students the concept of gender association in the English language.
<br /><br />He stated how hurricanes at one time were given feminine names and how ships and planes were usually referred to as &quot;she&quot;. One of the students raised their hand and asked - &quot;What gender is a computer&quot;?
<br /><br />The teacher wasn't certain which it was, so he divided the class into two groups, males in one, females in the other, and asked them to decide if a computer should be masculine or feminine. Both groups were asked to give four reasons for their recommendation. The group of women concluded that computers should be referred to in the masculine gender because:
<br /><br />1. In order to get their attention, you have to turn them on. 
<br />2. They have a lot of data but are still clueless. 
<br />3. They are supposed to help you solve your problems, but half the time they ARE the problem. 
<br />4. As soon as you commit to one, you realize that, if you had waited a little longer, you could have had a better model.
<br /><br />The men, on the other hand, decided that computers should definitely be referred to in the feminine gender because: 
<br />1. No one but their creator understands their internal logic. 
<br />2. The native language they use to communicate with other computers is incomprehensible to everyone else. 
<br />3. Even your smallest mistakes are stored in long-term memory for later retrieval. 
<br />4. As soon as you make a commitment to one, you find yourself spending half your paycheck on accessories for it.

<br />dinner. His birthday was coming up and he thought this was a
<br />good time to tell his mother what he wanted. &quot;Mom, I want a bike for 
<br />my birthday.&quot; Little Bobby was a bit of a troublemaker. He had gotten
<br />into trouble at school and at home. Bobby's mother asked him if he
<br />thought he deserved to get a bike for his birthday. Little Bobby, of
<br />course, thought he did.
<br /><br />Bobby's mother wanted Bobby to reflect on his behavior over the last
<br />year. &quot;Go to your room, Bobby, and think about how you have behaved
<br />this year.
<br /><br />Then write a letter to God and tell him why you deserve a bike for 
<br />your birthday.&quot; Little Bobby stomped up the steps to his room and sat
<br />down to write God a letter.
<br /><br />Letter 1
<br />Dear God,
<br />I have been a very good boy this year and I would like a bike for my
<br />birthday. I want a red one. 
<br />Your friend,
<br />Bobby
<br /><br />Bobby knew that this wasn't true. He had not been a very good boy
<br />this year, so he tore up the letter and started over.
<br /><br />Letter 2
<br />Dear God,
<br />This is your friend Bobby. I have been a good boy this year and I 
<br />would like a red bike for my birthday.
<br />Thank you.
<br />Your friend Bobby
<br /><br />Bobby knew that this wasn't true either. So, he tore up the letter
<br />and started again.
<br /><br />Letter 3
<br />Dear God,
<br />I have been an &quot;OK &quot;boy this year. I still would really like a bike 
<br />for my birthday.
<br />Bobby
<br /><br />Bobby knew he could not send this letter to God either. So, Bobby
<br />wrote a fourth letter.
<br /><br />Letter 4
<br />God,
<br />I know I haven't been a good boy this year. I am very sorry. I will 
<br />be a good boy if you just send me a bike for my birthday.
<br />Please!
<br />Thank you,
<br />Bobby
<br /><br />Bobby knew, even if it was true, this letter was not going to get him
<br />a bike.
<br /><br />Now, Bobby was very upset. He went downstairs and told his mom that 
<br />he wanted to go to church. Bobby's mother thought her plan had
<br />worked, as Bobby looked very sad. &quot;Just be home in time for dinner,&quot;
<br />Bobby's mother told him.
<br /><br />Bobby walked down the street to the church on the corner. Little 
<br />Bobby went into the church and up to the altar. He looked around to
<br />see if anyone was there. Bobby bent down and picked up a statue of
<br />the Mary. He slipped the statue under his shirt and ran out of the
<br />church, down the street, into the house, and up to his room. He shut 
<br />the door to his room and sat down with a piece of paper and a pen.
<br />Bobby began to write his letter to God.
<br /><br />Letter 5
<br />God,
<br />I'VE KIDNAPPED YOUR MAMA. IF YOU WANT TO SEE HER AGAIN, SEND THE
<br />BIKE!!!!!!!!!!

<br /><br />How can you look up words in a dictionary if you can't spell them? 
<br /><br />If a word is misspelled in a dictionary, how would we ever know? 
<br /><br />If two mouses are mice and two louses are lice, why aren't two houses hice? 
<br /><br />If Webster wrote the first dictionary, where did he find the words? 
<br /><br />If you wrote a letter, perhaps you bote your tongue? 
<br /><br />If you've read a book, you can reread it. But wouldn't this also mean that you would have to &quot;member&quot; somebody in order to remember them? 
<br /><br />In Chinese, why are the words for crisis and opportunity the same? 
<br /><br />Is it a coincidence that the only 15 letter word that can be spelled without repeating a letter is uncopyrightable? 
<br /><br />Is there another word for a synonym? 
<br /><br />Shouldn't there be a shorter word for &quot;monosyllabic&quot;? 
<br /><br />What is another word for &quot;thesaurus&quot;? 
<br /><br />Where do swear words come from? 
<br /><br />Why can't you make another word using all the letters in &quot;anagram&quot;? 
<br /><br />Why do fat chance and slim chance mean the same thing? 
<br /><br />Why do overlook and oversee mean opposite things? 
<br /><br />Why do people use the word &quot;irregardless&quot;? 
<br /><br />Why do some people type &quot;cool&quot; as &quot;kewl?&quot; 
<br /><br />Why do we say something is out of whack? What is a whack? 
<br /><br />Why do we say something's out of order when its broken but we never say in of order when it works? 
<br /><br />Why does &quot;cleave&quot; mean both split apart and stick together? 
<br /><br />Why does &quot;slow down&quot; and &quot;slow up&quot; mean the same thing? 
<br /><br />Why does flammable and inflammable mean the same thing? 
<br /><br />Why does the Chinese ideogram for trouble symbolize two women living under one roof? 
<br /><br />Why does X stand for a kiss and O stand for a hug? 
<br /><br />Why doesn't &quot;onomatopoeia&quot; sound like what it is? 
<br /><br />Why don't we say &quot;why&quot; instead of &quot;how come&quot;? 
<br /><br />Why is &quot;crazy man&quot; an insult, while to insert a comma and say &quot;Crazy, man!&quot; is a compliment? 
<br /><br />Why are a wise man and wise guy opposites? 
<br /><br />Why is abbreviation such a long word? 
<br /><br />Why is dyslexic so hard to spell? 
<br /><br />Why is it so hard to remember how to spell MNEMONIC? 
<br /><br />Why is it that no word in the English language rhymes with month, orange, silver, or purple? 
<br /><br />Why is it that the word &quot;gullible&quot; isn't in the dictionary? 
<br /><br />Why is it that we recite at a play and play at a recital? 
<br /><br />Why is it that writers write but fingers don't fing, grocers don't groce and hammers don't ham? 
<br /><br />Why is the alphabet in that order? Is it because of that song? 
<br /><br />Why is the plural of goose-geese, and not the plural of moose-meese? 
<br /><br />Why isn't &quot;palindrome&quot; spelled the same way backwards? 
<br /><br />Why isn't phonetic spelled the way it sounds?

<br /><br />Have you ever wondered why foreigners have trouble with the English Language?
<br /><br />Let's face it
<br />English is a stupid language.
<br />There is no egg in the eggplant
<br />No ham in the hamburger
<br />And neither pine nor apple in the pineapple.
<br />English muffins were not invented in England
<br />French fries were not invented in France.
<br /><br />We sometimes take English for granted
<br />But if we examine its paradoxes we find that
<br />Quicksand takes you down slowly
<br />Boxing rings are square
<br />And a guinea pig is neither from Guinea nor is it a pig. 
<br /><br />If writers write, how come fingers don't fing.
<br />If the plural of tooth is teeth
<br />Shouldn't the plural of phone booth be phone beeth
<br />If the teacher taught,
<br />Why didn't the preacher praught.
<br /><br />If a vegetarian eats vegetables
<br />What the heck does a humanitarian eat!?
<br />Why do people recite at a play
<br />Yet play at a recital?
<br />Park on driveways and
<br />Drive on parkways
<br /><br />You have to marvel at the unique lunacy
<br />Of a language where a house can burn up as
<br />It burns down
<br />And in which you fill in a form 
<br />By filling it out
<br />And a bell is only heard once it goes!
<br /><br />English was invented by people, not computers
<br />And it reflects the creativity of the human race
<br />(Which of course isn't a race at all)
<br /><br />That is why
<br />When the stars are out they are visible
<br />But when the lights are out they are invisible
<br />And why it is that when I wind up my watch
<br />It starts
<br />But when I wind up this observation,
<br />It ends.

<br /><br />The next night the same drunk comes in again and orders a drink for everyone in the bar including the bartender. Again the bartender follows instructions and again the drunk says he has no money. So the bartender slaps him around and throws him out.
<br /><br />On the third night he comes in, the drunk orders drinks for all except the bartender. &quot;What, no drink for me?&quot; replies the bartender. &quot;Oh, no. You get violent when you drink.&quot;

<br />A man walked into a therapist's office looking very depressed. &quot;Doc, you've got to help me. I can't go on like this.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;What's the problem?&quot; the docotor inquired.
<br /><br />&quot;Well, I'm 35 years old and I still have no luck with the ladies. No matter how hard I try, I just seem to scare them away.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;My friend, this is not a serious problem. You just need to work on your self-esteem. Each morning, I want you to get up and run to the bathroom mirror. Tell yourself that you are a good person, a fun person, and an attractive person. But say it with real conviction. Within a week you'll have women buzzing all around you.&quot;
<br /><br />The man seemed content with this advice and walked out of the office a bit excited. Three weeks later he returned with the same downtrodden expression on his face. 
<br /><br />&quot;Did my advice not work?&quot; asked the doctor.
<br /><br />&quot;It worked alright. For the past several weeks I've enjoyed some of the best moments in my life with the most fabulous looking women.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;So, what's your problem?&quot; 
<br /><br />&quot;I don't have a problem,&quot; the man replied. &quot;My wife does.&quot;

The next day, she went back to the same store and said I would like to buy that T.V. please. The store clerk, once again, replies Sorry, we dont do business with blondes.
