<br /><br />Nate is woken up with a start as his bedside phone starts ringing right beside his ear. With a groan he reaches over and picks it up, almost dropping it as he brings it to his ear.
<br /><br />&quot;Uuugggh, thanks for waking me up.&quot; He was a little too tired for the formality of a proper greeting.
<br /><br />&quot;WAKING YOU UP?!?&quot; He recognized that voice, as high pitched and squealy as it was. It was Nicole, his sister. &quot;You were supposed to pick me up 15 minutes ago, remember?&quot; Nicole was 18 and living on her own, 
<br />but she still didn't have a car, so Nate had to drive her wherever she needed to go, in this case, shopping.
<br /><br />&quot;Aw damnnit...look give me 15 minutes OK? I'll give you an extra half hour shopping, deal?&quot; There was a silence on the other end until...
<br /><br />&quot;Fine, but only 15 minutes OK?&quot; Although he knew that if he showed up in another 30 minutes she would be mad sure, but she'd get over it, after all, she knows he's her only ride.
<br /><br />&quot;15 minutes, count on it.&quot;
<br /><br /><span class="textAlign textAlignCenter">--------------------------------------------------------------25 minutes later-----------------------------------------------------------------------</span>
<br /><br />Nate pulled up into Nicole's apartment building at 20 miles over the speed limit, he was already 10 minutes late and didn't want to waste any more time. He had heard that old saying far too many times:
<br /><br />Hell hath no wrath like a woman scorned
<br /><br />Running up to the intercom and pressing &quot;Rider&quot; he waited for her to answer. Unsurprisingly, she answered right away, she must have been waiting by the door.
<br /><br />&quot;You do realize I get an extra hour now right?&quot;
<br />With a sigh, he pushed the intercom
<br />     &quot;Fine, just get down here.&quot; he went back to the car and started it up, he wanted to get this done as soon as possible. He loved his sis of course, but being her chauffeur wasn't exactly his dream job. He turned his rear-view mirror so he could see just how bad he looked, and surprisingly it wasn't that bad. The bags under his blue eye's weren't as bad as he thought they were, his blond hair was still wet from the shower, but he just put a hat over it and no one will know the difference.
<br /><br />Nicole walked out looking great, as usual. She always fussed about her looks, spending hours getting ready to go out, when she didn't really need to. Her dark hair was naturally straight, but she would curl it, her chestnut brown eyes were gorgeous on their own, but she would put on liner, eye shadow, mascara, the works. The list goes on and on, and she came off looking just as beautiful as she started out in Nate's opinion.
<br /><br /><span class="textAlign textAlignCenter">----------------------------------------------------------------5 minutes later----------------------------------------------------------------------</span>
<br /><br />They parked in the middle of downtown and began their sweep, they hit almost every clothing store they saw. Now that she knew she had an extra hour nothing was going to slow her down.
<br /><br />They came to this one store and she ran inside, when he walked in he realized why. This was the megamart of fashion stores, bigger than any he's seen before. By the time he walked in she was already making her way through the racks, picking out more and more clothes. With a sigh, he went and sat down on the couch, obviously put there for boyfriends while their girlfriends spent their many hours in here.
<br /><br />He looked at the coffee table in front of him and saw a bunch of sports magazines, a couple Penthouses...definitely made for boyfriends. He reached out and picked up one of the football magazines and started reading. Before he could flip to an article, a voice came from behind him.
<br /><br />&quot;Wow, you actually didn't pick the Penthouse, now that's a surprise.&quot; He turned around to see one of the employees standing behind him, and quite frankly, she was gorgeous. &quot;I guess you don't want your girlfriend seeing you huh?&quot;
<br /><br />He looked at her in awe, she really was beautiful, her red hair flowed onto her white dress shirt uniform, which was quite flattering on her. She smiled at him and his heart skipped a beat. 
<br /><br />&quot;Actually I don't have a girlfriend, I drove my sister here.&quot; and then when the thought struck him, he added &quot;I have to say, I didn't know that they had models working here, otherwise I would come here a lot more often.&quot;
<br /><br />She laughed, a cute laugh, but not too pixie-ish. &quot;Well I didn't know that.......sorry I got nothing.&quot; Then they both laughed, and she came and sat down beside him. 
<br /><br />&quot;So,&quot; he said &quot;Are you really allowed to come and talk to customers? Or brother's of customers for that matter.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;Well buy something, then I'll have an excuse to talk to you.&quot; she let out a giggle &quot;Actually I'm on my break, so I'm free to talk to whoever I want thank you very much.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;So you came and chose me? I feel honored&quot; he said, giving her a small little bow
<br /><br />&quot;Very funny smarty pants. Actually my break is for about another 20 minutes, do you want to go grab a coffee?&quot; Then she gave him that smile, and he knew he couldn't say no. He got up and started to walk out the door, when she said &quot;By the way, what's your name?&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;Nate, yours?&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;I'm Sara, nice to meet you Nate.&quot; and she kissed him on the cheek...he felt himself blush.
<br /><br /><span class="textAlign textAlignCenter">-------------------------------------------------------30 minutes later--------------------------------------------------------------------------</span>
<br /><br />Nate looked at his watch, and saw that Sara's break was over 10 minutes ago. &quot;Oh wow, you really have to get back...but hey, are you free for dinner tonight?&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;Wow you don't waste any time do you? Yeah I'm free, what do you say 6:00 at the Copper Ladel?&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;You realize it's usually the guy who makes that decision right?&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;Well have you been there before?&quot;
<br /><br />Nate thought for a second, he hadn't actually been there, all his years of living in Newensville and he had never been there. &quot;Uhh, no I haven't.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;Well then you don't know how good it is, so that's why I'm making the arrangements&quot; She smiled that 'I-know-you-have-nothing-to-say-to-that' smile and leaned in and kissed him on the cheek. Their heads refused to part from each other, so he went and kissed her other cheek. Still, their heads didn't part, he sat there staring into her eyes, not knowing what to do. With nowhere else to go, he leaned in and pecked her on the lips, and as he parted, she moved closer in, and connected with him open mouth on open mouth. Before he could even realize what had happened, it was over, and she put a finger to his mouth and said 
<br /><br />&quot;See you later lover boy&quot;

<br />Ground shaking, cell phones beeping.
<br />It's chaos to say the least, like hordes of angry ants
<br />But such is the scene, at any high school dance.
<br /><br />She walks through the doors, no one makes a sound,
<br />The guys just stare, the girls jealousy's abound.
<br />The beauty of the school she is, and more so tonight,
<br />Her jet black dress shimmers as she steps into the light.
<br /><br />Murmurs fall over the crowd,
<br />Boys that wish they had come with that girl.
<br />Girlfriends hear, their voices too loud,
<br />Countless slaps sends the guys for a whirl.
<br /><br />I step towards the shimmering beauty,
<br />Having no partner of my own,
<br />I ask her for a dance, she doesn't answer, 
<br />I give a silent moan.
<br /><br />She looks at me with that look,
<br />Saying &quot;I like you and you like me&quot;
<br />She can read me like a book,
<br />My feelings she can see.
<br /><br />All eyes are on us, as I lead her to the floor,
<br />As if on cue, there's silence, a love song starts.
<br />I hold her in my arms, like we've been here before,
<br />There is but one sound, the beating of our hearts.

<br />The way you look and what you say,
<br />Your whole being is a sweet elixir,
<br />The joys of the world thrown into a mixer,
<br />Your eyes, those gorgeous deep blue eyes,
<br />Sets my heart on fire, makes my soul arise,
<br />Your smile, though you hide it so,
<br />Puts an end to sadness, fear and woe,
<br />For all these things, for all you are,
<br />You complete the world, from near to far.

<br />How can I laugh at all you say?
<br />It's not normal how I feel, I know it's not right,
<br />How can I feel this way about someone I met on this site?
<br /><br />We first talked with a joke, and a flirtatious mood,
<br />You weren't like the others, not slutty or rude,
<br />You first opened up to me, then I to you,
<br />Now you're my shoulder to cry on, my friend to turn to
<br /><br />I don't think this is love, in fact I know it's not,
<br />Love comes and goes, can be stolen or bought,
<br />This is something truer, something more strong,
<br />That makes me know that it can't be wrong.
<br /><br />Two birds of a feather are we,
<br />Two fruit fallen from the same tree,
<br />You can bring out the best in me,
<br />Make me strive to be all I can be.
<br /><br />(Why is it untitled? Because I can't think of a word to sum all this up)

<br /><br />A girl went to a
<br />party and
<br /><br />she ended up staying longer than
<br /><br />planned,
<br /><br />and
<br /><br />had to walk home alone. She wasn't
<br /><br />afraid
<br /><br />because it was a small town and she
<br />lived
<br /><br />only
<br /><br />a
<br /><br />few blocks away.
<br /><br />As she walked along under the tall elm
<br /><br />trees,
<br /><br />Diane asked God to keep her safe from
<br /><br />harm
<br /><br />and
<br /><br />danger.
<br /><br />When she reached the alley, which was a
<br /><br />short
<br /><br />cut to her house, she decided to take
<br />it.
<br /><br />However, halfway down the alley she
<br /><br />noticed
<br /><br />a
<br /><br />man standing at the end as though he
<br /><br />were
<br /><br />waiting
<br /><br />for her.
<br /><br />She became uneasy and began to pray,
<br /><br />asking
<br /><br />for
<br /><br />God's protection.
<br /><br />Instantly a comforting feeling of
<br />quietness
<br /><br />and
<br /><br />security wrapped round her, she felt as
<br /><br />though
<br /><br />someone was walking with her.
<br /><br />When she reached the end of the alley,
<br /><br />she
<br /><br />walked right past the man and arrived
<br /><br />home
<br /><br />safely.
<br /><br />The following day, she read in the
<br /><br />newspaper
<br /><br />that
<br /><br />a young girl had been raped in the same
<br /><br />alley
<br /><br />just
<br /><br />twenty minutes after she had been
<br />there.
<br /><br />Feeling overwhelmed by this tragedy and
<br /><br />the
<br /><br />fact
<br /><br />that it could have been her, she began
<br />to
<br /><br />weep.
<br /><br />Thanking the Lord for her safety and to
<br /><br />help
<br /><br />this
<br /><br />young woman, she decided to go to the
<br /><br />police
<br /><br />station.
<br /><br />She felt she could recognize the man,
<br />so
<br /><br />she
<br /><br />told
<br /><br />them her story.
<br /><br />The police asked her if she would be
<br /><br />willing to
<br /><br />look
<br /><br />at a lineup to see if she could
<br />identify
<br /><br />him.
<br /><br />She agreed and immediately pointed out
<br /><br />the
<br /><br />man
<br /><br />she had seen in the alley the night
<br /><br />before.
<br /><br />When the man was told he had been
<br /><br />identified,
<br /><br />he
<br /><br />immediately broke down and confessed.
<br /><br />The officer thanked Diane for her
<br />bravery
<br /><br />and
<br /><br />asked if there was anything they could
<br />do
<br /><br />for
<br /><br />her.
<br /><br />She asked if they would ask the man one
<br /><br />question.
<br /><br />Diane was curious as to why he had not
<br /><br />attacked
<br /><br />her.
<br /><br />When the policeman asked him, he
<br /><br />answered, &quot;Because she wasn't alone.
<br /><br />She
<br /><br />had
<br /><br />two tall men walking on either side of
<br /><br />her.&quot;
<br /><br />Amazingly, whether you believe or not,
<br /><br />you're
<br /><br />never alone. Did you know that 98% of
<br /><br />teenagers
<br /><br />will not stand up for God?

<br />Mornings too early, too close to the dawn.
<br /><br />First a sigh, 
<br />then a stretch,
<br />And then a small &quot;woah&quot;
<br />As I look out my window to the fresh fallen snow.
<br /><br />I throw on my coat and I run out the door,
<br />And I almost slip on this new icy floor,
<br />I look up with awe at this wonder above,
<br />Snowflakes falling like a thousand white doves.
<br /><br />They fall with purpose and they fall with grace,
<br />The eighth wonder of the world, their soft white face,
<br />I tilt back my head and I part open my lips,
<br />And I taste the magic in those little ice chips.
<br /><br />If ever there was a fairy tale land
<br />A place from the carols, a real wonderland
<br />A place of fun, of laughter and joy,
<br />A place of excitement for each girl and boy.
<br /><br />Then that place is here, among the icy trees,
<br />Where snowflakes fall and icicles freeze,
<br />Where snowballs are thrown, and troubles melt,
<br />The greatest feelings that you have ever felt.

<br />Fog filled my sight,
<br />I could barely see my hand,
<br />No vision and no light.
<br /><br />Through the darkness, through the mist,
<br />She stood out like a flame,
<br />The body of an angel, the soul of a devil,
<br />I heard her speak my name.
<br /><br />Her voice was filled with lust, 
<br />Her smile filled with love,
<br />Which heaven do I trust? 
<br />Hell below or up above?
<br /><br />I don't remember moving,
<br />Yet somehow I was there,
<br />Staring at the fire red dress,
<br />Do I speak? Do I dare?
<br /><br />Before I could open my mouth,
<br />She had it occupied,
<br />Her scarlet lips surrounded mine, 
<br />As she worked her way inside.
<br /><br />As soon as it started it was done, 
<br />And she whispered in my ear,
<br />&quot;Dance with me my love,
<br />show me why you're here&quot;
<br /><br />I wrapped my hands around her waist,
<br />Around that silky dress,
<br />Devil or angel I didn't care,
<br />She was still a goddess.
<br /><br />I can't dance with the devil,
<br />I just can't stand the heat,
<br />But when I look into her eyes,
<br />My heart begins to beat. 
<br /><br />I'm filled with fire I didn't know was there
<br />When I look into her eyes, her lips, her hair.
<br />She possesses me like a real devil would,
<br />But melts my heart like a real angel could.

<br />Alyssa leaned over and slammed the snooze button
<br />It's...way...too....early...
<br />Looking over at her bedside digital clock, she saw with dismay that it was 8:30.
<br />OK...maybe it's not so early after all
<br />Accustomed to sleeping in until 11-12 for the past couple months, even 8:30 seemed early to her. She grudgingly crawled out of bed and into the bathroom, grabbing some shampoo she stepped into the shower.
<br /><br />The hot water fell on her body like tiny knives making their way onto her skin. It was invigorating, yet painful; awakening, yet excruciating. She had to have this hot of a shower though, otherwise she'd never wake up.
<br /><br />After the hot water had run on her for a few minutes, she slowly began to wake up. She looked down at the shampoo she had grabbed, and it was Ben's.
<br />Why is Ben's shampoo in my house?
<br />Then it hit her.
<br /><br />It wasn't her house...
<br /><br />It was theirs.
<br /><br />It still took a little getting used too, they had only been living together for a little less than a month. Alyssa had been unemployed for quite some time now, and it was taking it's toll on her savings. She wasn't able to pay for her rent anymore, and Ben, being the dear that he is, offered her a room at his house.
<br /><br />They hadn't been dating that long, only a few months, but Ben still let her come and live with him. Of course they weren't sleeping in the same bed yet, they hadn't had sex already so it would make things a little awkward. So Ben made up the spare bedroom, he had to be the only person his age to have a spare bedroom. Ben was young, only 22, but he had gotten a great job at a small restaurant that had started up. He became manager in a few years and then the restaurant opened up another branch, and then another, and another. Before you knew it he was regional manager and had a very, VERY nice house.
<br /><br />As she was recollecting all of this, she realized the reason why she had to wake up in the first place...her job interview!
<br /><br />She quickly soaped up her body, shampooed her silky red hair, which was losing it's silkiness because...well she didn't bother to care for it that much anymore. She stepped out of the shower and the shower mat flew out from under her and she ended up with her butt on the tile floor.
<br /><br />With a fair amount of pain, she got to her feet, it felt like she bruised her tailbone or something, but that didn't matter now, she had to get to her interview!
<br /><br />She ran to her closet, picked out the first suit and tie she saw, threw them on, ran to the bathroom, put her hair up in a bun, decided against putting on makeup, she just didn't have time.
<br /><br />Running downstairs to the door, she saw Ben just coming out of his bedroom. She gave him a running peck on the cheek.
<br /><br />&quot;Hi hun, bye hun&quot; she said as she whipped past him. She ran to the door, pushed it and...it stayed closed. She pushed again, it stayed closed...
<br />She checked the deadbolt, it wasn't locked, she pushed again...
<br />It stayed closed.
<br /><br />&quot;BEEEEEEENNN!!&quot; she screamed at the top of her lungs, she needed out, now. &quot;WHY ISN'T THE..&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;It's a pull door sweetheart.&quot;
<br /><br />She pulled on the door and: lo and behold, it opened.
<br />Feeling rather foolish, she continued her marathon, sprinting to the car, fumbling for her keys, jamming them in the ignition, and...she was off. She looked at the time, it was 8:51, she was going to make it.
<br /><br />____________________________________
<br /><br />Ben watched from out his window as the little white Cavalier drove down the street at top speed. His face was still warm from where Alyssa kissed him, he knew that there was no way it would still be warm, but he felt it anyways.
<br /><br />He felt like that a lot with her, whenever he was with her he felt some sort of wonder. He knew that they haven't known each other that long, but there was something about her, something special...and incredible.
<br /><br />That's why it wasn't awkward asking her to move in with him after 3 months and 11 days, simply because it was her.
<br /><br />He walked down the stairs and made his way into the kitchen, reaching into his cabinet and grabbed a few slices of bread and the toaster. It wasn't an extravagant breakfast by any means, but he was around extravagant food all day, he needs a break from it. So therefore his breakfasts are plain, toast and/or cereal.
<br /><br />After the bread had been in the toaster a few minutes, he heard the doorbell ring.
<br />Oh no, what did Alyssa forget?
<br /><br />He walked to the door and opened it, giving his best &quot;annoyed boyfriend&quot; impression he sighed, looked away and asked.
<br /><br />&quot;What do you need?&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;Well, a place to stay would be nice&quot; a man's voice replied.
<br /><br />In shock, Ben looked only to see his little brother standing there with some luggage and a dejected look on his face.
<br /><br />The smell of burnt toast filled his nose.

<br /><br />Ben stared into his brother's eyes, once so full of hopes and dreams, now faded by the years and years of rejection. But he noticed that there was a new spark, a faint glimmer in the storm clouds. It had been years since Ryan had a steady job, Ben could only hope that spark meant that had changed.
<br /><br />&quot;I need a place to stay,&quot; said Ryan timidly, &quot;I just got a job at this new firm in town, and I'm going to need a place to stay so I can save up some money...&quot;
<br /><br />Ryan had passed the bar exam about 2 years ago, but he had still not been able to find a steady job. It wasn't because he was a bad lawyer, but he had very strong morals. If he found out that the firm he was working at represented some unsavory types, he sent in his two weeks notice. Which basically ruled out...well every law firm.
<br /><br />Ben looked into his brother's eyes again, he knew that he probably should say no because of Alyssa, she was stressed out enough recently and didn't need some stranger in the house (they hadn't been dating that long so her and Ryan had never met). But when he looks at that hope in his eyes...
<br /><br />&quot;Of course you can, how could I say no to you?&quot; Ben said, putting his arm around his little brother &quot;Besides, it's Older Brother Commandment #271: When thy brother needeth a roof over his head, thou must provide&quot;
<br /><br />Ryan laughed, he always laughed at Ben's 'Older Brother Commandments', they had been going on since they were both kids. Ben was only a year older than Ryan, and never held little baby Ryan in his arms, but he took care of him as if he had. 
<br /><br />&quot;You never told me any of the younger brother commandments, are there any?&quot; asked Ryan, and then it was Ben's turn to have a laugh. 
<br /><br />&quot;Well let's see, there's Commandment #33: Thou shalt not stealeth thy brother's wench. These commandments are politically incorrect if you didn't notice, they were written a long, long time ago. Commandment #17: Thou shalt not covet thy brother's Ox, cart, or Plasma TV&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;So much for being written a long time ago, did they have Plasma TV's back in the day of the Commandments?&quot; asked Ryan, trying to go along with the joke.
<br /><br />&quot;Well not as we know them today of course, back then they were jesters that performed for the rich folk&quot; replied Ben, as he led Ryan up the stairs and towards the guest room. &quot;So tell me, where's this new job? Have you made sure they haven't represented any evil men who steal little old ladies groceries?&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;First off,&quot; began Ryan, &quot;the man was evil, I've looked into his eyes and wanted to run for my life. Secondly, he stole her entire cart of groceries! Would you work for a company that helped that guy get off the hook?&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;Ryan, Ryan, Ryan, Ryan. When will you ever learn that being a lawyer is not a pretty thing? You are going to have to defend some people who aren't crucifix-carrying priests.&quot; 
<br /><br />&quot;No it's not that...I just want to know I'm doing good work you know? Not getting criminals out from behind bars.&quot; 
<br /><br />Ben sighed as he stepped through the door of the guest bedroom, he led Ryan inside and gave him a quick tour.
<br /><br />&quot;Well here you are, all the comforts of home. You have a bed...a table BESIDE the bed....and a closet...enjoy!&quot;
<br /><br />The room that Alyssa is staying in now used to be the guest bedroom, and since she moved in it dropped the word 'guest' from it's title. Ben wanted to have a guest bedroom around somewhere, so he took an empty room and threw a bed in it, turns out it was a good idea.
<br /><br />&quot;I'll take you thrift store shopping once you get your first paycheck, we'll get you some furniture in here. So back to my question, is this a good job you have?&quot;
<br /><br />Ryan flopped down on the bed, and as he sat up, Ben saw that the spark was leaving his eyes, and before he opened his mouth, Ben knew the answer.
<br /><br />&quot;Well yeah...kinda....the lady who interviewed me is nice, and she said that most of their clients are good people.&quot;
<br /><br />To save the trouble of actually continuing the conversation, Ben played it out in his head:
<br /><br /><em>And what about the rest of their clients? Did you ask about them?
<br /><br />No...
<br /><br />So they're probably all liars, killers and grocery vigilantes?
<br /><br />Yeah...
<br /><br />You're not going to last more than a month are you?
<br /><br />No...</em>
<br /><br />Ben looked at his watch, he had 20 minutes to get to work.
<br /><br />&quot;Look Ryan, I have to head out, but make yourself at home and I'll lend you one of my suits for your first day OK?&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;OK, listen Ben I just wanted to say...well you know you didn't have to let me...&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;You're welcome&quot; said Ben, simply smiling at his younger brother.
<br /><br />&quot;Thanks&quot; Ryan replied, returning the smile from his older brother.
<br /><br />As Ben grabbed his toast, he realized that he never told Ben about Alyssa living here as well. Stepping out the front door he thought:
<br /><br /><em>Well this is going to make for an interesting introduction</em>

<br /><br />In other words, a job interview.
<br /><br />Her roommate had told her about it, the law firm where she works at had just fired a secretary, and the position was now open. Sandy knew nothing about the law, but Odette replied with something like this:
<br /><br />&quot;Law? You don't need to know anything about law! All you have to be able to do is remember what kind of coffee your boss likes and know how to suck up.&quot;
<br /><br />So she went into the interview thinking they were just going to ask a few simple questions, look over her resume and send her back out the door...
<br /><br />Yeah right.
<br /><br />They asked her a bunch of questions like:
<br /><br />'If two people get divorced, who has the automatic right to the children? Mother or Father?'
<br /><br />'What states still allow the death penalty?'
<br /><br />And so many more. Sandy knew none of them, she guessed on the divorce one, and said Texas and Alabama for the death penalty. She had no clue but figured that those two states out of any would still allow it.
<br /><br />She unlocked the door to her apartment and, with a sigh, pushed it open. Kicking off her shoes she grudgingly walked into the living room and dropped down onto the couch. 
<br /><br /><em>How could I be so stupid? I could never work at a firm, I don't know anything about...well anything. 
<br />Well isn't this a lovely sight? Here I am sitting at a crappy apartment, without a job, without money, and without a boyfriend. Don't I just have the greatest life ever?</em>
<br /><br />She turned on the TV and laid her head down on the couch, maybe she could just sleep and dream of a life where everything was going right................
<br /><br /><span class="textAlign textAlignCenter">___________________________________________</span>
<br /><br />&quot;Honey I'm home!&quot; said her husband, stepping through the door in his sharp black suit and leather briefcase. The twins ran up to him first and hugged him around his legs. They couldn't be more than 6 years old, and they screamed &quot;Daddy daddy daddy!!!&quot;
<br /><br />She walked up to meet him and gave him a quick kiss on the cheek. 
<br /><br />&quot;How was work baby?&quot; 
<br /><br />&quot;You'll never guess what happened. I made partner!&quot; he said, as he took off his jacket and showed off his muscular frame confined in a tight dress shirt.
<br /><br />&quot;Oh my god! Honey that's fantastic!&quot; she screamed as she jumped into his arms &quot;Now we'll finally be able to buy that house that we've been dreaming of getting!&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;I know, and I couldn't have done it without you hun, you carried me through all those hard years of being a starting lawyer. I love you baby.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;I love you too my prince&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;I love you more&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;No I love YOU more&quot;
<br /><br />And so the argument ensued, as they playfully jabbed each other back and forth. Never had two people been more in love than this, you could just feel the warmth radiating off of them. After the argument ended, they agreed that they both loved each other an equal, unmeasurable amount. 
<br /><br />&quot;Supper's almost ready, I'll just go wash up&quot; she said, giving him another peck on the cheek, this time however he pulled her in for a long, amazing kiss. After 8 years of marriage, he could still send electricity all the way down to her toes.
<br /><br />Blushing, she made her way into the bathroom, which was furnished with gold-plated faucets, an ivory toilet and bathtub, and on the walls were various sketches that the kids made, all done with crayon of course. 
<br /><br />Placing her hands in the sink, she soaped up, scrubbed and rinsed. The wedding ring on her finger glimmered with perfection, as a large diamond sat in the center of a 24 karat gold ring. 
<br /><br />She looked up into the mirror and fixed her hair, which she noticed wasn't blond, like it is supposed to be...and the face wasn't hers either.
<br /><br />She realized with horror, that it was Odette she was looking at in the mirror.
<br /><br />&quot;Sweetie?&quot; came the call from the kitchen, and again &quot;Sweetie? You there? Wake up, WAKE UP!&quot;
<br /><br /><span class="textAlign textAlignCenter">_______________________________________</span> 
<br /><br />&quot;WAKE UP!!&quot;
<br /><br />Sandy was back lying on her couch, remote still in her hand, and Odette standing over her. So much for dreaming of a perfect life.
<br /><br />&quot;Well hun?&quot; asked the bright eyed Odette &quot;How did the interview go? Do you think you got the job?&quot;
<br /><br />Sandy sat up on the couch and ran her fingers through her hair, which was once again blond, and messed up from lying on the couch for what she figured was about 5 or 6 hours.
<br /><br />&quot;If I got it then your firm is a joke, the interview was horrible, she asked me a bunch of questions I didn't know the answer to, I sounded like an idiot, and to top it all off, I'm pretty sure she didn't like me.&quot; Sandy began to stand up, &quot;I need a drink&quot;
<br /><br />Odette pushed her back down onto the couch, &quot;No no no, I can't have you drunk sweetie, what if they call and ask you to come back?&quot;
<br /><br />Sandy couldn't help but laugh at that, after that horrendous interview, Odette still thinks she has a shot. Forever the optimist is what she is. &quot;Listen, I have no job, no money, you've been paying my half of the rent for a good 3 months now, I haven't had a date in months, I don't even know if I'm capable of flirting anymore, just let me have a...&quot;
<br /><br />The phone rang.
<br /><br />They both went silent and stared at the ringing contraption sitting 2 feet in front of them. 
<br /><br />It rang again.
<br /><br />Sandy saw her dream coming back to life, the husband, the kids, the house, the money!
<br /><br />It rang a third time.
<br /><br />&quot;ANSWER IT!&quot; screamed Odette
<br /><br />Sandy attacked the phone and pulled it to her ear
<br /><br />&quot;Hello?&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;Yes...&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;No I understand...&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;No no it's perfectly fine...&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;Thank you very much, good bye.&quot;
<br /><br />She put the phone down and sat back on the couch, picked up the remote and started watching TV. As she flipped through channels, Odette was standing just to the side with her face frozen in the screamer position.
<br /><br />&quot;Well?&quot; she finally asked &quot;What did they say?&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;Oh right, they told me that they had about 30 applicants, it would not have been very easy to get the job anyways. They said that they think I got the hardest interviewer, she asked questions that no one else asked...oh yeah, and they told me I start tomorrow!&quot;
<br /><br />They both screamed.

<br /><br />Alyssa jumped back as her horn honked at her, I guess that's what you have to expect when you slam your head against your steering wheel though.
<br /><br />It had been an excruciating day, sitting there in that crappy leather chair listening to some lady blabber on and on about divorce and sentencing and blah blah blah blah blah. She was simply honest with her, she didn't know any of it. 
<br /><br />She remembers it quite vividly actually, as she was quite honestly, a little proud of it. 
<br /><br />She leaned onto the interviewers desk, looked around the office for a few seconds, then leaned in close to her and said:
<br /><br />&quot;Let me tell you something&quot; motioning for her to come closer, and when the interviewer did, she whispered in her ear &quot;I don't know shit about law&quot;
<br /><br />The look on the lady's face was worth the 4 hours she sat waiting to be called, her pink wired glasses almost falling off her pointed nose as her jaw dropped down to her President Bush mousepad...you'd think some people had never heard the word &quot;shit&quot; before.
<br /><br />But now she was just tired, the day of sitting and doing...well nothing, had taken it's toll on her. She just wanted to go crawl back into bed...
<br /><br /><em>I think this unemployed-ness is making me lazy...sleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep</em>
<br /><br />She got out of her car and walked into the house, throwing her keys onto the kitchen table she opened the fridge to find something to eat. Having skipped breakfast and not had time for any other food she was absolutely starved. 
<br /><br />The fridge was well-stocked, Ben made enough money that he was able to not only have this really nice house, but have a lot of food to pick from at any time. She was trying to decide between having some leftover Chinese food from the other night...or just having some cheesecake. 
<br /><br />Suddenly she heard footsteps in the other room, they sounded like they were coming from the living room. Alyssa's mind suddenly pictured a thief rummaging through the room stealing DVD's, CD's, and maybe even the TV! She looked around the kitchen for something she could use as a weapon, her eyes were drawn to one of the frying pans hanging over the oven. 
<br /><br />She gripped is tightly in her hands, which she noticed had begun to sweat, and her breathing was growing more rapid too. She pressed on though, inching her way to the door, and upon arrival, pinned herself up against the wall.
<br /><br />She contemplated what to do, she could either run into the room like a mad woman swinging the pan around hoping to connect with skull. Or she could slowly open the door, sneak up on him and hit him in the head from behind. She could throw the pan at him, but that wouldn't do much good, it would have to be a knife or something...
<br /><br />Just then the door opened.
<br /><br />The mystery man walked into the kitchen and Alyssa, panicking, swung the frying pan at his face, knocking him to the ground. His head bounced as it hit the kitchen tile, and as it returned to the floor, she noticed that he didn't really look like a criminal at all...
<br /><br />He was clean shaven, his hair looked well-kept, his clothes were OK, they weren't high fashion by any means...but they were OK. 
<br /><br /><em>What is this guy doing in my house?</em>
<br /><br />Just then she heard the front door open.
<br /><br />&quot;Honey I'm home!&quot; 
<br /><br />Alyssa recognized Ben's voice, he had been saying that when he came in the door ever since they moved in. He either thinks it's funny or cute, either way it had gotten annoying. And now was really not the time to be cute.
<br /><br />&quot;In the kitchen, come in here now!&quot; she screamed, as she stood over this strange man, still confused as to what he was doing in the house...
<br /><br />As Ben entered the room, he immediately saw the man sprawled out over the black and white tile. Surprisingly, he ran to his side and started slapping his face
<br /><br />&quot;Ryan? Ryan! Can you hear me? What happened to him?&quot; 
<br /><br />Alyssa was at a loss for what to say, it looked like this is a friend of his, and she really doubted he wanted to hear that she clunked him in the head with a pan.
<br /><br />&quot;I think he...slammed his head on one of those pans hanging over the oven...really hard...do you know him?&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;Of course I know him,&quot; Ben replied &quot;He's my brother.&quot;

<br /><br />&quot;Put him down gently&quot; said a mans voice
<br />&quot;I'm trying, he's heavy!&quot; replied a womans
<br /><br />That's when Ryan began to remember things...he remembered walking into a strange house, being greeted by someone he recognized...his brother? So that's who the male voice was.
<br />He was walking around this house, putting his luggage in a room he assumed was his. Then he remembers walking through a door and then...nothing.
<br />Who is that woman?
<br /><br />He then felt himself land on something very hard
<br /><br />&quot;You missed the couch! OK, let's try this again, this time, be very careful, and....DON'T DROP THAT ON HIS....&quot;
<br /><br /><span class="textAlign textAlignCenter">--------------------------------------------------------2 hours later------------------------------------------------------------------</span>
<br /><br />Ryan woke up.
<br />He was in a bed this time, opening his eyes he could see a blanket laid over him. Looking around the room he realized that this must be the room that he was put in, there was really nothing else besides a bed. The walls were painted a dull off-white, there was a mirror hanging lonely on the wall opposite his bed. Beside his bed was a chair, and in the chair was...a woman. 
<br /><br />Ryan quickly sat up in surprise, and that caused the woman to look up from her newspaper and rush to his side. She put her hand on his shoulder and forced him to lie down again.
<br /><br />&quot;Good you're awake, we were worried about you.&quot; said the mystery woman, she put her hand on his forehead which stung him a little. 
<br />&quot;Oh that still hurts does it?&quot; she said, whoever she was she seems to know what happened. &quot;I'm sorry about that, I came in the house and I heard strange footsteps, I thought you were a robber or something.&quot; 
<br /><br />Ryan sat up again, much to the chagrin of the mystery woman, but he was determined to find out what was going on. Starting with the basics, he asked,
<br /><br />&quot;Who are you?&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;I'm Alyssa&quot; she replied as if he should know who that is, &quot;Ben's girlfriend?...Does he tell you anything?&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;Well we haven't really talked in a while,&quot; Ryan said, realizing just how long it has been since him and Ben touched base, he didn't even know he had a girlfriend &quot;I've been...busy&quot; he added, hoping to add some justification to his absence.
<br /><br />&quot;Yeah he hasn't really mentioned you much Ryan, do you have a job? A girlfriend?&quot; asked Alyssa, who was making it painfully obvious that Ben and Ryan really knew nothing about each other
<br /><br />&quot;No on both accounts, well I am starting a new job tomorrow, so we'll see how that goes.&quot; and Alyssa now knew as much about Ryan's life right now as his own brother did.
<br /><br />&quot;Really? A cute guy like you doesn't have a girlfriend?&quot; 
<br /><br /><em>...is she hitting on me? It's been so long since I've had a girlfriend I can't really tell...Oh wait how long am I taking to answer? Is this getting awkward? Maybe I should say something...</em>
<br /><br />Before things got too awkward, Ben walked in the room
<br /><br />&quot;Ryan! Oh thank God you're OK! I was getting worried sick about you. I take it you and Alyssa have already met.&quot; said Ben as he ran to the side of the bed.
<br /><br />&quot;Yeah we have, I can't believe I didn't know you were dating someone!&quot; 
<br /><br />Ben put his arm around Alyssa and Ryan felt a hint of jealousy for a second, he didn't know why, and he didn't know just how much that would cost him later on.
