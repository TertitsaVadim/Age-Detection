<br />A sound so strong - that calls my name
<br />It's wild like the river - it 's warm like the sun
<br />Ya it's here - this is where I belong
<br /><br />Under the starry skies - where eagles have flown
<br />This place is paradise - it 's the place I call home
<br />The moon on the mountains
<br />The whisper through the trees
<br />The waves on the water
<br />Let nothing come between this and me
<br /><br />Cuz everything I want - is everything that's here
<br />And when we're all together - there's nothing to fear
<br /><br />And wherever I wander - the one thing I've learned
<br />It's to here - I will always...always return

<br />I had a dream - of the pale morning sky 
<br />I had a dream - that we flew on golden wings

<br />Follow your heart - little child of the west wind 
<br />Follow the voice - that's calling you home 
<br />Follow your dreams - but always, remember me 
<br />I am your brother - under the sun 
<br /><br />We are like birds of a feather 
<br />We are two hearts joined together 
<br />We will be forever as one 
<br />My brother under the sun 
<br /><br />Wherever you hear - the wind in the canyon 
<br />Wherever you see - the buffalo run 
<br />Wherever you go - I'll be there beside you 
<br />'Cause you are my brother - my brother under the sun

<br />She'd walk by on her way to work - n' make the air smell so sweet 
<br />I used to sit in a coffee shop - sometimes I'd have a cup 
<br />And when she'd go by - she'd light up the sky 
<br />Like the sun coming up 
<br />She be standin' by the bus stop - driver opened up the door 
<br />I'd just sit n' watch her - getting on the 104 
<br />I wanna give her my number - I wanna tell her my name 
<br />Wanna climb on board that cross-town bus 
<br />Take a chance she feels the same 
<br />It's just another east side story 
<br />Everybody's got a tale to tell 
<br />And like a hundred guys before me 
<br />I fell under her spell 
<br />Some things you hold on to - some you just let go 
<br />Seems like the ones that you can't have 
<br />Are the ones that you want most 
<br />I think about her sometimes - I wonder if she was real 
<br />And if I ever find her I'm gonna tell her how I feel 
<br />It's just another east side story 
<br />Everybody's got a tale to tell 
<br />And like a hundred guys before me 
<br />I fell under her spell 
<br />It's still the same old story - it's still the same old game 
<br />Up there on the eastside - life goes on the same 
<br />She never knew my number - never even knew my name 
<br />She climbed on board that cross-town bus I never saw her again

<br />My life was torn asunder
<br />And I was carried far away
<br /><br />Now somewhere in the distance 
<br />I feel a strange insistence
<br />I long to be there once again
<br /><br />The day is drawing nearer
<br />The time has come to leave here
<br />The feeling just keeps gettin' stronger every day
<br /><br />So I pray for the moment when I'll be with you
<br />And all that we hoped for is all comin' true
<br />When the time we've spent waitin' is finally through
<br />I'll be home again
<br /><br />I can still remember 
<br />Days that never ended
<br />Standin' on a distant shore
<br /><br />With every raindrop fallin' 
<br />I hear the thunder callin'
<br />Like so many times before
<br /><br />Sometimes in the darkness
<br />I hear what my heart says
<br />Maybe one day I'll know what that feelin's for
<br /><br />So I wait for the moment when I'll be with you 
<br />And all that we hoped for is all comin' true
<br />When the time is spent waitin' is finally through
<br />I'll be home again
<br /><br />When you're out there on your own
<br />It can chill you to the bone
<br />There's a cold wind blowin'
<br />But it feels good knowin' 
<br />The worst is over now - I'm finally goin' home
<br /><br />It's gettin' stronger
<br />Can't wait any longer

<br />That my body froze in bed
<br />If I just listened to it
<br />Right outside the window
<br /><br />There were days when the sun was so cruel
<br />That all the tears turned to dust
<br />And I just knew my eyes were
<br />Drying up forever
<br /><br />I finished crying in the instant that you left
<br />And I can't remember where or when or how
<br />And I banished every memory you and I had ever made
<br /><br />But when you touch me like this
<br />And you hold me like that
<br />I just have to admit
<br />That it's all coming back to me
<br />When I touch you like this
<br />And I hold you like that
<br />It's so hard to believe but
<br />It's all coming back to me
<br />(It's all coming back, it's all coming back to me now)
<br /><br />There were moments of gold
<br />And there were flashes of light
<br />There were things I'd never do again
<br />But then they'd always seemed right
<br />There were nights of endless pleasure
<br />It was more than any laws allow
<br />Baby Baby
<br /><br />If I kiss you like this
<br />And if you whisper like that
<br />It was lost long ago
<br />But it's all coming back to me
<br />If you want me like this
<br />And if you need me like that
<br />It was dead long ago
<br />But it's all coming back to me
<br />It's so hard to resist
<br />And it's all coming back to me
<br />I can barely recall
<br />But it's all coming back to me now
<br />But it's all coming back
<br /><br />There were those empty threats and hollow lies
<br />And whenever you tried to hurt me
<br />I just hurt you even worse
<br />And so much deeper
<br /><br />There were hours that just went on for days
<br />When alone at last we'd count up all the chances
<br />That were lost to us forever
<br /><br />But you were history with the slamming of the door
<br />And I made myself so strong again somehow
<br />And I never wasted any of my time on you since then
<br /><br />But if I touch you like this
<br />And if you kiss me like that
<br />It was so long ago
<br />But it's all coming back to me
<br />If you touch me like this
<br />And if I kiss you like that

<br />All coming back to me

<br />(It's all coming back to me now)
<br />If you do it like this
<br />(It's all coming back to me now)

<br />Of lovers sleeping tight
<br />Are rolling like thunder now
<br />As I look in your eyes
<br /><br />I hold on to your body
<br />And feel each move you make
<br />Your voice is warm and tender
<br />A love that I could not forsake
<br /><br />cause I am your lady
<br />And you are my man
<br />Whenever you reach for me
<br />Ill do all that I can
<br /><br />Lost is how Im feeling lying in your arms
<br />When the world outsides too
<br />Much to take
<br />That all ends when Im with you
<br /><br />Even though there may be times
<br />It seems Im far away
<br />Never wonder where I am
<br />cause I am always by your side
<br /><br />Were heading for something
<br />Somewhere Ive never been
<br />Sometimes I am frightened
<br />But Im ready to learn
<br />Of the power of love
<br /><br />The sound of your heart beating
<br />Made it clear
<br />Suddenly the feeling that I cant go on
<br />Is light years away

<br />Even then the folks in town said with prejudiced eyes
<br />That boy's not right
<br />Three years ago when I came to know Mary
<br />First time that someone looked beyond the rumors and lies
<br />And saw the man inside
<br /><br />We used to walk down by the river
<br />She loved to watch the sun go down
<br />We used to walk along the river
<br />And dream our way out of this town
<br /><br />No one understood what I felt for Mary
<br />No one cared until the night she went awalking alone
<br />And never came home
<br />Man with a badge came knocking next morning
<br />Here was I surrounded by a thousand fingers suddenly
<br />Pointed right at me
<br /><br />I swear I left her by the river
<br />I swear I left her safe and sound
<br />I need to make it to the river
<br />And leave this old Nebraska town
<br /><br />I think about my life gone by
<br />How its done me wrong
<br />There's no escape for me this time
<br />All of my rescues are gone
<br />Long gone
<br /><br />I swear I left her by the river
<br />I swear I left her safe and sound
<br />I need to make it to the river
<br />And leave this old Nebraska town

<br />This ever changing world, pushes me through another door
<br />I saw you smile
<br />And my mind could not erase, the beauty of your face
<br />Just for a while
<br />Won't you let me shelter you
<br /><br />Hold on to the nights
<br />Hold on to the memories
<br />I wish that I could give you something more
<br />That I could be yours
<br /><br />How do we explain, something that took us by surprise
<br />Promises in vain, love that is real but in disguise
<br />What happens now
<br />Do we break another rule
<br />Let our lovers play the fool
<br />I dont know how to stop feeling this way
<br /><br />Hold on to the nights
<br />Hold on to the memories
<br />If only I could give you more
<br /><br />Well I think I've been true, to everybody else but me
<br />And the way I feel about you, makes my heart long to be free
<br />Everytime I look into your eyes, I'm helplessly aware
<br />That the someone I've been searching, for is right there
<br /><br />Hold on to the nights
<br />Hold on to the memories
<br />I'm wishing I could give you more
<br />Hold on to the nights
