<br />Distant faces with no place left to go
<br />Without you within me I can’t find no rest
<br />Where I’m going is anybody’s guess
<br /><br />I’ve tried to go on like I never knew you
<br />I’m awake but my world is half asleep
<br />I pray for this heart to be unbroken
<br />But without you all I’m going to be is incomplete
<br /><br />Voices tell me I should carry on
<br />But I am swimming in an ocean all alone
<br />Baby, my baby
<br />It’s written on your face
<br />You still wonder if we made a big mistake
<br /><br />I’ve tried to go on like I never knew you
<br />I’m awake but my world is half asleep
<br />I pray for this heart to be unbroken
<br />But without you all I’m going to be is incomplete
<br /><br />I don’t mean to drag it on, but I can’t seem to let you go
<br />I don’t wanna make you face this world alone
<br />I wanna let you go (alone)
<br /><br />I’ve tried to go on like I never knew you
<br />I’m awake but my world is half asleep
<br />I pray for this heart to be unbroken
<br />But without you all I’m going to be is incomplete

<br />Cuz you walked out the door
<br />But it's the only way I hear your voice anymore

<br />Said I'm so sick of love songs so sad and slow
<br />So why can't I turn off the radio?
<br /><br />Gotta fix that calender I have
<br />That's marked July 15th
<br />Because since there's no more you
<br />There's no more anniversary
<br />I'm so fed up with my thoughts of you
<br />And your memory
<br />And how every song reminds me
<br />Of what used to be
<br /><br />That's the reason I'm so sick of love songs
<br />So tired of tears
<br />So done with wishing you were still here
<br />Said I'm so sick of love songs so sad and slow

<br />Or having my first child
<br />Let it go
<br />Turning off the radio

<br />I know sometimes things may not always make sense to you right now
<br />But hey, what daddy always tell you?
<br />Straighten up little soldier
<br />Stiffen up that upper lip
<br />What you crying about?
<br />You got me
<br /><br />[Verse 1:]
<br />Hailie, I know you miss your mom and I know you miss your dad
<br />Well I'm gone but I'm trying to give you the life that I never had
<br />I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh
<br />I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you want to cry
<br />Cuz you're scared, I ain't there
<br />Daddy's with you in your prayers
<br />No more crying, wipe them tears
<br />Daddy's here, no more nightmares
<br />We gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it
<br />Laney, uncle's crazy, aint he?
<br />Yeah but he loves you girl and you better know it
<br />We're all we got in this world
<br />When it spins, when it swirls
<br />When it whirls, when it twirls
<br />Two little beautiful girls
<br />Lookin' puzzled, in a daze
<br />I know it's confusing you
<br />Daddy's always on the move, mamma's always on the news
<br />I try to keep you sheltered from it but somehow it seems
<br />The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me
<br />All the things growing up his daddy that he had to see
<br />Daddy don't want you to see but you see just as much as he did
<br />We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me
<br />But things have gotten so bad between us
<br />I don't see us ever being together ever again
<br />Like we used to be when we was teenagers
<br />But then of course everything always happens for a reason
<br />I guess it was never meant to be
<br />But it's just something we have no control over and that's what destiny is
<br />But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep
<br />Maybe one day we'll wake up and this will all just be a dream
<br /><br />[Chorus:]
<br />Now hush little baby, don't you cry
<br />Everything's gonna be alright
<br />Stiffen that upper lip up little lady, 
<br />I told ya Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
<br />I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
<br />We feel how we feel inside
<br />It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
<br />But I promise momma's gon' be alright
<br /><br />[Verse 2:]
<br />It's funny
<br />I remember back one year when daddy had no money
<br />Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up
<br />And stuck 'em under the tree and said some of 'em were from me
<br />Cuz daddy couldn't buy 'em
<br />I'll never forget that Christmas I sat up the whole night crying
<br />Cuz daddy felt like a bum, see daddy had a job
<br />But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom
<br />And at the time every house that we lived in
<br />Either kept getting broken into and robbed
<br />Or shot up on the block
<br />And your mom was saving money for you in a jar
<br />Tryna start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
<br />Almost had a thousand dollars till someone broke in and stole it
<br />And I know it hurt so bad it broke your momma's heart
<br />And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart
<br />Mom and dad was arguin' a lot so momma moved back
<br />On the Chalmers in the flat one bedroom apartment
<br />And dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara
<br />And that's when daddy went to California with his CD and met Dr. Dre
<br />And flew you and momma out to see me
<br />But daddy had to work, you and momma had to leave me
<br />Then you started seeing daddy on the T.V. and momma didn't like it
<br />And you and Laney were to young to understand it
<br />Papa was a rollin' stone, momma developed a habit
<br />And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
<br />I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand
<br />Cuz all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
<br />Now I'm sittin in this empty house, just reminiscing
<br />Lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out
<br />To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now
<br />Wow, guess you pretty much are and daddy's still here
<br />Laney I'm talkin' to you too, daddy's still here
<br />I like the sound of that, yeah
<br />It's got a ring to it don't it?
<br />Shh, momma's only gone for the moment
<br /><br />[Chorus]
<br /><br />[Verse 3:]
<br />And if you ask me too
<br />Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird
<br />I'mma give you the world
<br />I'mma buy a diamond ring for you
<br />I'mma sing for you
<br />I'll do anything for you to see you smile
<br />And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine
<br />I'mma break that birdie's neck
<br />I'd go back to the jewler who sold it to ya
<br />And make him eat every carat don't fuck with dad (haha)

<br />They sold the cause for the queen,
<br />And when the lights all went out
<br />We watched our lives on the screen.
<br />I hate the ending myself, 
<br />But it started with an alright scene.
<br /><br />It was the roar of the crowd
<br />That gave me heartache to sing.
<br />It was a lie when they smiled
<br />And said, &quot;you won't feel a thing&quot;
<br />And as we ran from the cops
<br />We laughed so hard, it would sting
<br /><br />Yeah yeah, oh
<br /><br />If I'm so wrong (so wrong, so wrong)
<br />How can you listen all night long? (night long, night long)
<br />Now will it matter after I'm gone?
<br />Because you never learn a goddamned thing.
<br /><br />You're just a sad song with nothing to say 
<br />About a life long wait for a hospital stay
<br />And if you think that I'm wrong, 
<br />This never meant nothing to you
<br /><br />I spent my high school career
<br />Spit on and shoved to agree
<br />So I could watch all my heroes
<br />Sell a car on tv
<br />Bring out the old guillotine 
<br /><br />We'll show 'em what we all mean.
<br /><br />Yeah yeah, oh
<br /><br />If I'm so wrong (so wrong, so wrong)
<br />How can you listen all night long? (night long, night long)
<br />Now will it matter long after I'm gone?
<br />Because you never learn a goddamned thing.
<br /><br />You're just a sad song with nothing to say 
<br />About a life long wait for a hospital stay
<br />And if you think that I'm wrong, 
<br />This never meant nothing to ya
<br /><br />So go, go away, just go, run, run away.
<br />But where did you run to? And where did you hide?
<br />Go find another way, price you pay
<br /><br />Woah, Woah, Woah, Woah, Woah, Woah 
<br /><br />You're just a sad song with nothing to say 
<br />About a life long wait for a hospital stay
<br />And if you think that I'm wrong, 
<br />This never meant nothing to ya, come on
<br /><br />You're just a sad song with nothing to say 
<br />About a life long wait for a hospital stay
<br />And if you think that I'm wrong, 
<br />This never meant nothing to you
<br /><br />At all, at all, at all, at all

<br />Theres nothing left to do tonight
<br />I go crazy on you,
<br />crazy on you,
<br />Let me go crazy, crazy on you, whoooo
<br /><br />[Verse 1]
<br />Can't you see what you do to me baby?
<br />You make me crazy, you make me act like a maniac.
<br />Im like a lunatic, you make me sick
<br />You're truly the only one who can do this to me
<br />You just make me get so crazy.
<br />I go schizo, I get so insane I just go skitzophrenic
<br />One minute I want to slit your throat
<br />The next I want sex.
<br />You make me crazy,
<br />the way we act like 2 maniacs in the sack
<br />We fuck like 2 jackrabbits
<br />And maybe thats a bad habit.
<br />Cuz the next day we’re right back at it
<br />In the same exact pattern
<br />What the fuck is the matter with us
<br />We cant figure out if it’s lust 
<br />Or its love is what’s attracting us to each other
<br />They say that every man grows up to marry his own mother.
<br />Which would explain why you’re such a motherfucking bitch
<br />But I stay and still stick it out with you even though I just hit you today
<br />But you deserve it you hit me first and provoked me to choke you
<br />Just cuz I came home late last night crawled in bed and I woke you.
<br />But if theres one thing about you that I admire it's, baby,
<br />Because you stay with me, maybe, cuz youre as crazy as I am
<br />Cuz when I look at you I can see an angel in your eyes
<br />But if I look deeper inside I see your freakish little side.
<br />Like a devil in disguise,
<br />Youre always full of surprises
<br />Always pullin devices
<br />Out your purse little vibrators and dildos
<br />You fuck yourself so much
<br />You barely feel those anymore
<br />Youre only 24 but youre plenty more mature
<br />Than those other little hoes
<br />Who just act like little girls
<br />Like theyre in middle school still
<br />Youre crazy sexy cool, chillin
<br />You play your position
<br />You never step out of line
<br />Even though I stay in your business
<br />Youve always kept out of mine.
<br />I wonder what's on your mind
<br />Sometimes they say love is blind
<br />Maybe thats why the first time I dotted your eye
<br />You aint see the sign
<br /><br />[with Chorus]
<br />Or maybe you did, maybe you like being shoved
<br />Maybe cuz were crazy in loooove
<br /><br />[Chorus]
<br />I go crazy on you
<br />crazy on you, lemme go crazy, crazy on you, whoooo
<br /><br />[Verse 2]
<br /><br />You are the ink to my paper
<br />What my pen is to my pad
<br />The moral, the very fiber
<br />The whole substance to my rap.
<br />You are my reason for being
<br />The meaning of my existance
<br />If it wasnt for you
<br />I would never be able to spit this
<br />As intense as I do and the irony
<br />Is you rely on me as much
<br />as I rely on you to inspire me like you do.
<br />You provide me the lighter-fluid the fuel my fire
<br />Youre my entire supply
<br />Gas, the match, the igniter.
<br />The only way that I am able to stay so stable
<br />Is you’re the legs to my table
<br />If you were to break Id fall on my face.
<br />But I am always going to make you feel
<br />I dont need you as much as I really need you
<br />So you dont use it to your advantage.
<br />But you are essential to me
<br />You are the air I breathe
<br />I believe if you ever leave me
<br />Id probably have no reason to be.
<br />You are the Kim to my Marshall
<br />You are the Slim to my Shady
<br />The Dre to my Eminem
<br />The Alaina to my Haillie.
<br />You are the word that I am looking for when
<br />I am trying to describe how I feel inside
<br />And the right one just wont come to my mind.
<br />You are like the pillar that props me up
<br />The beam that supports me
<br />The bitch who never took half,
<br />The wife who never divorced me.
<br />You are like the root to my evil
<br />You let my devil come out me
<br />You let me beat the shit out you
<br />Before you beat the shit out me.
<br /><br />[with Chorus]
<br /><br />And no matter how much
<br />Too much is never enough
<br />Maybe cuz were crazy in loooove
<br /><br />[Chorus]
<br />I go crazy on you
<br />Crazy on you, lemme go crazy, crazy on you, whoooo

<br />And to the Republic for which it stands
<br />One nation under God
<br />Indivisible with liberty and justice for all...
<br />It feels so good to be back..
<br /><br />I scrutinize every word, memorize every line
<br />I spit it once, refuel, re-energize and rewind
<br />I give sight to the blind, my insight through the mind
<br />I exercise my right to express when I feel it's time
<br />It's just all in your mind, what you interpret it as
<br />I say to fight, you take it as I'mma whip someone's ass
<br />If you don't understand, don't even bother to ask
<br />A father who has grown up with a fatherless past
<br />Who has blown up now to rap phenomenon that has
<br />Or at least shows no difficulty multi-task
<br />And in juggling both perhaps mastered his craft
<br />Slash entrepreneur who has helped launch a few more rap acts
<br />Who's had a few obstacles thrown his way through the last half
<br />Of his career typical manure moving past that
<br />Mr. kisses ass crack, he's a class act
<br />Rubber band man, yea he just snaps back
<br /><br />[Chorus:]
<br />Come along follow me as I lead through the darkness
<br />As I provide just enough spark that we need to proceed
<br />Carry on, give me hope, give me strength
<br />Come with me and I won't steer you wrong
<br />Put your faith and your trust as I guide us through the fog
<br />To the light at the end of the tunnel
<br />We gonna fight, we gonna charge, we gonna stomp, we gonna march
<br />Through the swamp, we gonna mosh through the marsh
<br />Take us right through the doors (c'mon)
<br /><br />All the people up top on the side and the middle
<br />Come together lets all bomb and swamp just a little
<br />Just let it gradually build from the front to the back
<br />All you can see is a sea of people some white and some black
<br />Don't matter what color, all that matters we gathered together
<br />To celebrate for the same cause don't matter the weather
<br />If it rains let it rain, yea the wetter the better
<br />They ain't gonna stop us they can't, we stronger now more than ever
<br />They tell us no we say yea, they tell us stop we say go
<br />Rebel with a rebel yell, raise hell we gonna let em know
<br />Stomp, push, shove, mush, Fuck Bush, until they bring our troops home (c'mon)
<br /><br />[Chorus]
<br /><br />Imagine it pouring, it's raining down on us
<br />Mosh pits outside the oval office
<br />Someone's tryina tell us something,
<br />Maybe this is God just sayin' we're responsible
<br />For this monster, this coward,
<br />That we have empowered
<br />This is Bin Laden, look at his head noddin'
<br />How could we allow something like this without pumping our fists
<br />Now this is our final hour
<br />Let me be the voice in your strength and your choice
<br />Let me simplify the rhyme just to amplify the noise
<br />Try to amplify the times it, and multiply by six...
<br />Teen million people, Are equal at this high pitch
<br />Maybe we can reach alqueda through my speech
<br />Let the president answer a higher anarchy
<br />Strap him with an Ak-47, let him go, fight his own war
<br />Let him impress daddy that way
<br />No more blood for oil, we got our own battles to fight on our own soil
<br />No more psychological warfare, to trick us to thinking that we ain't loyal
<br />If we don't serve our own country, we're patronizing a hero
<br />Look in his eyes its all lies
<br />The stars and stripes, they've been swiped, washed out and wiped
<br />And replaced with his own face, Mosh now or die
<br />If I get sniped tonight you know why,
<br />Cause I told you to fight.
<br /><br />[Chorus]
<br /><br />And as we proceed,
<br />To Mosh through this desert storm,
<br />In these closing statements, if they should argue
<br />Let us beg to differ
<br />As we set aside our differences
<br />And assemble our own army
<br />To disarm this Weapon of Mass Destruction
<br />That we call our President, for the present
<br />And Mosh for the future of our next generation
<br />To speak and be heard
<br />Mr. President, Mr. Senator
<br />Do you guy's hear us...hear us...[laughing] (Hailie)

<br />Searching for the right
<br />But it keeps avoiding me
<br />Sorrow in my soul
<br />Cause it seems that wrong
<br />Really loves my company
<br /><br />He's more than a man
<br />And this is more than love
<br />The reason that the sky is blue
<br />The clouds are rolling in
<br />Because I'm gone again
<br />And to him I just can't be true
<br /><br />And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
<br />And it kills him inside
<br />To know that I am happy with some other guy
<br />I can see him dying
<br /><br />I don't wanna do this anymore
<br />I don't wanna be the reason why
<br />Everytime I walk out the door
<br />I see him die a little more inside
<br />I don't wanna hurt him anymore
<br />I don't wanna take away his life
<br />I don't wanna be...
<br />A murderer
<br /><br />I feel it in the air
<br />As I'm doing my hair
<br />Preparing for another date
<br />A kiss upon my cheek
<br />As he reluctantly
<br />Asks if I'm gonna be out late
<br />I say I won't be long
<br />Just hanging with the girls
<br />A lie I didn't have to tell
<br />Because we both know
<br /><br />Where I'm about to go
<br />And we know it very well
<br /><br />Cause I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
<br />And it kills him inside
<br />To know that I am happy with some other guy
<br />I can see him dying
<br /><br />I don't wanna do this anymore
<br />I don't wanna be the reason why
<br />Everytime I walk out the door
<br />I see him die a little more inside
<br />I don't wanna hurt him anymore
<br />I don't wanna take away his life
<br />I don't wanna be...
<br />A murderer
<br /><br />Our love, his trust
<br />I might as well take a gun and put it to his head
<br />Get it over with
<br />I don't wanna do this
<br />Anymore
<br />Uh
<br />Anymore (anymore)
<br /><br />I don't wanna do this anymore

<br />Was it something I did?
<br />Was it something You said?
<br />Don't leave me hanging
<br />In a city so dead
<br />Held up so high
<br />On such a breakable thread
<br /><br />You were all the things I thought I knew
<br />And I thought we could be
<br /><br />[Chorus:]
<br />You were everything, everything that I wanted
<br />We were meant to be, supposed to be, but we lost it
<br />And all of the memories, so close to me, just fade away
<br />All this time you were pretending
<br />So much for my happy ending
<br />Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh...
<br /><br />You've got your dumb friends
<br />I know what they say
<br />They tell you I'm difficult
<br />But so are they
<br />But they don't know me
<br />Do they even know you?
<br />All the things you hide from me

<br />Yeah, for those of you that want to know what we're all about
<br />It's like this y'all (c'mon!)
<br /><br />[Chorus:]
<br />This is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill
<br />Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
<br />Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain
<br />And a hundred percent reason to remember the name!
<br /><br />Mike! - He doesn't need his name up in lights
<br />He just wants to be heard whether it's the beat or the mic
<br />He feels so unlike everybody else, alone
<br />In spite of the fact that some people still think that they know him
<br />But fuck em, he knows the code
<br />It's not about the salary
<br />It's all about reality and making some noise
<br />Making the story - making sure his clique stays up
<br />That means when he puts it down Tak's picking it up! Let's go!
<br /><br />Who the hell is he anyway?
<br />He never really talks much
<br />Never concerned with status but still leaving them star struck
<br />Humbled through opportunities given despite the fact
<br />That many misjudge him because he makes a living from writing raps
<br />Put it together himself, now the picture connects
<br />Never asking for someone's help, or to get some respect
<br />He's only focused on what he wrote, his will is beyond reach
<br />And now it all unfolds, the skill of an artist
<br /><br />This is twenty percent skill
<br />Eighty percent fear
<br />Be a hundred percent clear cause Ryu is ill
<br />Who would've thought that he'd be the one to set the west in flames
<br />And I heard him wreck it with The Crystal Method, &quot;Name Of The Game&quot;
<br />Came back dropped Megadef, took em to church
<br />I like bleach man, why you had the stupidest verse?
<br />This dude is the truth, now everybody's giving him guest spots
<br />His stock's through the roof I heard he's fuckin' with S. Dot!
<br /><br />[Chorus]
<br /><br />They call him Ryu, he's sick
<br />And he's spitting fire
<br />And mike got him out the dryer he's hot
<br />Found him in Fort Minor with Tak
<br />What a fuckin' nihilist porcupine
<br />He's a prick, he's a cock
<br />The type woman want to be with, and rappers hope he get shot
<br />Eight years in the making, patiently waiting to blow
<br />Now the record with Shinoda's taking over the globe
<br />He's got a partner in crime, his shit is equally dope
<br />You wont believe the kind of shit that comes out of this kid's throat
<br /><br />Tak! - He's not your everyday on the block
<br />He knows how to work with what he's got
<br />Making his way to the top
<br />He often gets a comment on his name
<br />People keep asking him was it given at birth
<br />Or does it stand for an acronym?
<br />No he's living proof, got him rocking the booth
<br />He'll get you buzzing quicker than a shot of vodka with juice
<br />Him and his crew are known around as one of the best
<br />Dedicated to what they do and give a hundred percent
<br /><br />Forget Mike - Nobody really knows how or why he works so hard
<br />It seems like he's never got time
<br />Because he writes every note and he writes every line
<br />And I've seen him at work when that light goes on in his mind
<br />It's like a design is written in his head every time
<br />Before he even touches a key or speaks in a rhyme
<br />And those motherfuckers he runs with,
<br />The kids that he signed?
<br />Ridiculous, without even trying,
<br />How do they do it?!
<br /><br />[Chorus - repeat 2x]
<br /><br />[Outro - Mike Shinoda:]
<br />Yeah! Fort Minor
<br />M. Shinoda - Styles of Beyond
<br />Ryu! Takbir! Machine Shop!

<br />You could tell how we felt from the look on our faces
<br />We were spinning in circles with the moon in our eyes
<br />No room left to move inbetween you and I
<br />And we forgot where we were
<br />And we lost track of time
<br />And we sang to the wind as we danced through the night
