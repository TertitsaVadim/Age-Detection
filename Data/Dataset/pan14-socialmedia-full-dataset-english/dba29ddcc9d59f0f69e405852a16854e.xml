<br /><br />A newly released global reputation management study of more than 100,000 consumers shows that who you are as a company is more important than what you produce, with BMW, Sony and Walt Disney Company topping the list of the most reputable companies.

Sherwin-Williams and Cars.com dropped their sponsorship of Penn State many months ago – and many more will rightfully follow.
<br /><br />The crisis PR situation which Penn State faces is about as bad as it gets – According to a report by a private security firm, Penn State University leaders knowingly covered up the crimes and disgusting deeds of former football assistant coach Jerry Sandusky, the child molester.  Administrators, including Joe Paterno were complicit in the silence.
<br /><br />The report says that the powers that be at Penn State did what they did “to avoid the consequences of bad publicity.” Allow kids to be molested and avoid media? Penn State’s values can’t be any clearer than that.
<br /><br />Penn State needs to remove the Joe Paterno statue immediately and send the message that they won’t honor people who are aware of child molesters and do nothing about it – regardless of what they do in sports.  They should also suspend the football program for a few years – focus on other matters instead of sports.  There’s plenty of education needed at this supposed “school of higher learning.”
<br /><br />Penn State has to begin to show that values and decency are more important than protecting football – How many kids were molested in part because Paterno and others did not act upon their knowledge? One wonders how many will be comfortable having their children attend and be educated at an institution where university presidents, “hero” coaches, and students not only accept, but celebrate those who witness – and do nothing – about disgusting, illegal behavior.
<br /><br />Will alumni start to move Penn State to the bottom of their resumes?
<br /><br />There’s not much that can be said about – or at – Penn State.  It’s time for actions, as clearly the leadership of Penn State took none while Sandusky was very active.
<br /><br />The fate of Penn State is in their hands.

<br /><br />The film grossed $74 million on Friday in the United States and Canada and is seen generating $173 million by the end of the weekend, people with knowledge of industry figures said on Saturday.
<br /><br />Official figures were not released by the distributor, Warner Bros. For the first time box office watchers could remember, Hollywood's other major film studios decided not to release weekend ticket sales figures on Saturday.
<br /><br />&quot;We're joining our colleagues at Warner Bros and not reporting grosses during this period of mourning,&quot; Sony Pictures said in a statement.
<br /><br />Hollywood.com Box Office, which reports the weekend figures, said it was not sure if it would publish its list this week.
<br /><br />A Warner Brothers spokeswoman did not return calls seeking comment on Friday night numbers.
<br /><br />&quot;Dark Knight Rises&quot; was one of the most-anticipated films of the year before a gunman opened fire on moviegoers at a midnight screening in Aurora, Colorado, early Friday, killing 12 people and wounding 58 more.
<br /><br />Ahead of the debut, box office forecasters predicted opening weekend sales in a range of $170 million to $198 million from Friday through Sunday, just shy of the record $207 million set by superhero movie &quot;The Avengers&quot; in May.
<br /><br />&quot;The cable news networks were wall-to-wall with the shooting, so it had some shock value that will keep people away,&quot; former Columbia Pictures marketing chief Peter Sealey said. &quot;But it will be short term. This movie will play for five or six weeks and still do great business.&quot;
<br /><br />Since many people bought tickets in advance, they likely decided to put aside any fears and see the film, said Paul Dergarabedian, head of Hollywood.com Box Office.
<br /><br />After the shooting, theaters tightened security, and Warner Bros. scaled back promotional plans, canceling a Paris premiere and appearances by the cast and crew in Mexico and Japan.
<br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5mb3JpbW1lZGlhdGVyZWxlYXNlYm9vay5jb20vUm9ublRvcm9zc2lhbkF1dGhvckJpby5odG1s" target="_blank">Ronn Torossian</a>, chief executive of New York-based 5W Public Relations, which is not involved with the movie's release, said it was smart for the studios to stay quiet in the days after such a horrific event. He said he expected the marketing for upcoming, violent films like &quot;The Expendables&quot; to tweak their advertising. But by September, if not earlier, that will change.
<br /><br />&quot;This will affect marketing movies in the short-term,&quot; he said. &quot;(But) the media has a very short memory, and it's something that in the long run will not affect&quot; film promotion.
<br /><br />LONE KILLER, NO COPYCAT
<br /><br />Outside theaters across the country, where police maintained tight security on Saturday, ticket lines were mostly filled and fans seemed little concerned about a copycat shooting.
<br /><br />&quot;It doesn't make me nervous. It's an isolated incident,&quot; said Charles Song, 31, at the Arclight cinema in Hollywood. &quot;I don't think it's going to spur any copycats. It's just one crazy lunatic that went off.&quot;
<br /><br />But the event does seem to have changed the thinking of some moviegoers, perhaps families, who might have planned to attend, and other films may be feeling the impact.
<br /><br />Animated family film &quot;Ice Age: Continental Drift,&quot; which grossed $44.6 million last week and was the top-selling film, had a larger-than-anticipated 51 percent drop for its second week. It sold $6.5 million on Friday and is projected to collect $23 million for the weekend, box office sources said.
<br /><br />&quot;The Amazing Spider-Man,&quot; which opened with near record sales on July 3, sold $6.5 million worth of tickets and is estimated to hit $11.5 million this weekend. The film, produced by Sony Pictures Entertainment, has passed $217 million in domestic sales on Thursday, according to Box Office Mojo.
<br /><br />A representative for 20th Century Fox, which released &quot;Ice Age,&quot; was not available for comment, and a spokesman for Sony Pictures, which is behind &quot;Spider-Man,&quot; declined comment.
<br /><br />&quot;Dark Knight Rises&quot; is the third and final film in a popular Batman series starring Christian Bale as the crime-fighting hero and directed by Christopher Nolan. Warner Bros. spent $250 million to produce it, plus tens of millions more on marketing.
<br /><br />On Friday, the studio said showings just after midnight had grossed $30.6 million in the North American (U.S. and Canadian) market. Warner Bros. later said it would not release any updated sales figures until Monday.
<br /><br />&quot;The Dark Knight&quot; took in $158 million domestically over its debut weekend in July 2008, a record at the time. It went on to ring up sales of more than $1 billion around the world.

I enjoyed the book as it breaks down the latest positive psychology research to show how any company can trigger positive emotion in customers and build the following they need to thrive. 
<br /><br />The preface states that: “Customer happiness is a new and exciting business concept. It is closely related to the established concepts of customer satisfaction, customer delight and the Net Promoter Score, yet it goes far beyond them in significance. In particular, customer happiness focuses on the positive emotional aspects of purchase and consumption.” 
<br /><br />It was a good book and worth reading – for anyone in the service industry or in any business. I recommend.

<br /><br />“For Immediate Release: Shape Minds, Build Brands, and Deliver Results with Game-Changing Public Relations “ by Ronn Torossian
<br /><br />As a watch collector, I’m tuned into the world of watches. The languages of two different exclusive watch retailers, Tourneau and Wempe, are especially interesting. Both retailers sell more or less the same product, but one embraces a variety of customers— whether they intentionally go after them with PR or not—and the other doesn’t.
<br /><br />Walk into the stores and you’ll “hear” two different voices; both voices convey a public relations message that customers take with them and spread when they leave the shop. The salespeople at Tourneau will show you any watch in the place; they’ll let you try on as many as you want, chat with you, and answer every question you have. The company speaks to the watch enthusiast. Whether you walk out wearing a watch or not, Tourneau always treats you well.
<br />Since it is such a major retailer, it has a lot of pull with big brands and as a result is known for getting exclusive watches available only at its shops. Tourneau gets excited about that, too. One such watch, a limited edition (they reportedly made just 50) black-and-white, three-hand version of Franck Muller’s Conquistador Grand Prix timepiece, was available at the New York store to anyone who wanted to see it.
<br /><br />However, walk into Wempe, an international retailer with one store in New York City and others across Europe and the United Kingdom, and it’s a very different story. If you don’t pass Wempe’s snob test, you’ll get an attitude that’s far from friendly. One weekend day, I strolled into Wempe without a watch on and wearing a sweat suit. The place was empty, but still, I had to wait for a salesperson to come over to see what I wanted. I asked to see an expensive watch, and the clerk asked me, with a straight face, if I was a construction worker before he took the piece out of the case.
<br /><br />That “language” certainly sent me a message: dress to our specifications and show you belong if you want to receive good customer service. It also sent me away, thank you very much. Different language for different folks. Maybe Wempe doesn’t need my business and feels comfortable losing a sale because of the way I dress on rainy weekends.

<br /><br />Both John Derbyshire and Ozzie Guillen made offensive statements this week which created major crisis’ for their employers – and both deserve to be disciplined by their employers. One wonders what they were thinking?
<br /><br />• First up is the genius who chose to speak in favor of Fidel Castro – in Miami of all places. Ozzie Guillen is employed as manager to help his team, the Marlins win on the field - not to create off the field diversions with politics – and especially not pro-Castro comments in one of the largest Hispanic markets in the country. This major distraction left the Marlins with no choice but to take action against Guillen only a few games into the major league baseball season.
<br /><br />o The Marlins are a business – and their purpose is to win on the field, and make money off the field. Guillen’s statements won’t help the Marlins corporation, or Major League Baseball. If Guillen gets off with only a 5 game suspension he will get off easy – and Guillen needs to immediately commence with a crisis communications program and clarify his statements very clearly. He also needs to apologize – loudly, quickly and repeatedly.
<br /><br />• Next, is the news that The National Review has fired longtime columnist John Derbyshire following an article he wrote for an online magazine that was racist. In the article he suggests white and Asian parents talk to their children about what makes black people different and the threats posed to their safety by black people. Derbyshire advises parents to tell their children not to live or stay long in predominantly black communities, in addition to other offensive comments.
<br /><br />&quot;[Derbyshire's] latest provocation, in a webzine, lurches from the politically incorrect to the nasty and indefensible,&quot; said National Review Editor Rich Lowry in firing him. &quot;We never would have published it, but the main reason that people noticed it is that it is by a National Review writer. Derb is effectively using our name to get more oxygen for views with which we’d never associate ourselves otherwise. So there has to be a parting of the ways.&quot;
<br /><br />Frankly, Lowry said it exactly right: &quot;It’s a free country, and Derb can write whatever he wants, wherever he wants. Just not in the pages of NR or NRO, or as someone associated with NR any longer.&quot;
<br />Owing a crisis PR agency, I wonder:
<br /><br />Did either of these folks have PR reps sitting in on their interviews or editing their content? A good PR representative would have interjected before it got to this point. One wonders what the purpose of Guillen’s interview was – Clearly he didn’t walk into TIME Magazine with an intention of praising Castro – how did he get so far off track?
<br /><br />Now that crisis has occurred they need to be thinking about reputation management – and life after the crisis (John Darbyshire soliciting donations isn’t the wisest move so soon after his offensive statements – unless he wants to write for the KKK newspaper.)
<br />Anyone who says all press is good press may want to ask John Derbyshire and Ozzie Guillen – or the National Review and Florida Marlins if they agree with that concept.
<br /><br />Clearly, all press isn’t good press.

<br /><br />Ze’ev Jabotinsky, a great Jewish leader had the following great quote: “A newspaper is a grand thing,” Jabotinsky wrote in 1932. “There is no labor of higher worth than that of the journalist, whether he writes instructional articles or reports on a robbery that took place yesterday in the slums. Like the function of the blood circulating through the body, or like the function of commerce in the international market, so is the function of journalism in the realm of the spirit…Who were the first to teach us to always interfere in matters that are not ours, to judge people and nations, even though we were never chosen for the position of judge? The work of the publicist is a legacy from the Prophets of Israel…Our passion is to speak, to proclaim—“Shouting” is what the same audience calls it, ‘we have no need for words, give us actions.’ One thing that audience forgets is that speech is also an action – Perhaps the most authentic of all other actions. Cities have been destroyed, and more will fall, but what was shouted in the wilderness thousands of years ago is alive and still relevant. The world was created by the Word. The world will be mended by the Article.” Ze’ev Jabotinsky was a journalist who published many articles and books.
<br /><br />“Publicity geniuses are different from you and me. They have the stomach for it. This temperamental combination of imperviousness and egomania that allows them, compels them, to dominate the media . . . means, too, that they dominate reality, that’s their world and we just . . . well you know.” Michael Wolff, writing in Vanity Fair
<br /><br />“The public relations warriors fought and lost Monte Carlo’s Battle of the Magazine Covers.” John Vinocur
<br /><br />“The media’s the most powerful entity on earth. They have the power to make the innocent guilty and to make the guilty innocent, and that’s power. Because they control the minds of the masses.” Malcolm X
<br /><br />I love quotes and found these on media and public relations to be thought provoking and interesting.

From Winston Churchill to Ronald Reagan, Steve Jobs to Martin Luther King, history is full of individuals who, through their words and deeds, have shifted public opinion and behavior. Barack Obama, Stephen Colbert, and the “Oracle of Omaha” Warren Buffet are all hailed as great communicators – no argument here. President Obama’s communication abilities are absolutely phenomenal. Mr. Colbert, through humor and wit, scores political points and creates cultural references (“Truthiness” anyone<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/unsure.gif" alt=":)" /> that resonate with legions of fans. And of course, it’s not just the financial public that eagerly anticipates Warren Buffet’s yearly shareholder letter – Main Street does too.
<br /><br />These people are always on “most influential” lists for good reason. This 10 Powerful Living Communicators is about living people who have sparked “change” and so the list looks beyond these usual suspects. I’m sure you’ll miss some favorites like Starbuck’s Howard Schultz and Bill Clinton – both consummate communicators. A shout out has to go to Reverend Al Sharpton – controversial for sure, but without his ability to stir a crowd would George Zimmerman have been arrested?
<br /><br />Let’s shake things up a bit and consider some other people whose ability to change the world, shape opinion, or use innate creativity to leave a long lasting cultural mark are unique. What this diverse group has in common is their ability to reach people emotionally, shift attitudes, and spark trends. There’s something we can learn from each of them about our own ability to make a mark. This is not an academic list – it’s a list from a PR Agency owner.
<br /><br />In no particular order, here’s my list of the Top 10 Living Communicators Who Influence Change:
<br />.Chris Anderson: Founder of the popular TED Talks, Anderson is a visionary who figured out a way to make speech giving sexy, widely popular, and powerful. Getting an invitation to do a TED Talk is the gold standard when it comes to speaking engagements. Anderson’s ability to spread the message of famous and little known thinkers, scientists, writers, philosophers, and activists remains unprecedented. Who else could have made it possible for 8,660,010 people to hear what Sir Ken Robinson said about the creativity-killing nature of school or 8,087,935 to share in Jill Bolte Taylor’s “Stroke of Insight?” To date more than 290 million people have tuned into or attended a TED Talk. Take-away: Generosity with ideas can change people’s lives.
<br /><br />Mark Zuckerberg: The story of Facebook is now legendary (not to mention a major motion picture, The Social Network). Zuckerberg co-founded the social-networking website from his Harvard dorm room. It proved so popular he ditched school in his sophomore year to focus on building the site, which now boasts more than 250 million users worldwide. Oh, and the risk has made the 28 year old a billionaire in the process. Facebook has also changed the way people communicate with each other – groups of people with common interests can find each other, people who could never hoped to have met in “real life” have become actual friends. Of course, the site has also spawned addictions to checking updates and playing a variety of games. Facebook has truly become part of the fabric of our lives. Take-away: Good ideas are worth taking a risk on.
<br /><br />Oprah: This media mogul is much, much more than a talk show host – she is an ultimate communicator who has reached millions of people through her television shows, movies productions, a network (which admittedly still needs work), magazine, and “Lifeclass” seminars and webcasts. Her enthusiasm can sell an obscure novel or a new shade of lipstick – Oprah’s endorsement of a product has literally build brands overnight. She’s so well known and widely respected that you don’t even have to use her last name. Why? Because people trust her – she’s built that trust through honesty, passion, and the ability to reveal herself, including the painful episodes in her life, in a way that resonates with people. Take-away: Respect your constituents by practicing integrity, honesty and authenticity.
<br /><br />Jay-Z: Born Shawn Corey Carter in 1969, Jay-Z is the most financially and culturally successful hip-hop artist, rapper, songwriter, producer and entrepreneur in the world. According to Forbes, his net worth is about $450 million and he’s sold more than 50 million albums worldwide. He also has 14 Grammies under his belt, and there are surely more to come. When he presided over Def Jam, Jay-Z signed the now mega star Rihanna, and helped Kanye West transition from producer to popular recording artist. He communicates through the fashion world too, with his successful Rocawear line that caters to both adults and children. A film company, upscale sports bars, and part owner of the New Jersey Nets rounds out his impressive portfolio. As he rapped, “I'm not a businessman/ I'm a business, man” – This man sparked the international hip-hop movement. Next step: The Billionaire club. This communications agent for change is well on his way. Take-away: See beyond the trend to the bigger picture, and capitalize on it. 
<br /><br />Roger Ailes: The man has changed the news business – say his name at a Manhattan cocktail party and you’ll get a range of reactions – from open disgust to whispered appreciation. Ailes is a polemic, combative figure to be sure, but he also changed the face of the news business when News Corp chairman Rupert Murdoch brought Ailes to Fox in 1996 to start a news channel that could compete with CNN. Ailes reportedly made a bold promise to Murdoch – that he could get FNC staffed and operating in six short months – just in time to go head to head with another entry into cable news, MSNBC. Skeptics, including Murdoch, were in abundance, but Ailes launched the network within the time frame and by 2002 it was beating CNN in the ratings war regularly. By sensing a need for another point of view and a different way of delivering the news, Ailes struck a chord with the public that has stuck. According to Nielsen Media Research, as of 2012 FNC continues to outpace both CNN and MSNBC combined in total viewership. You can’t argue with success. Take-away: When you see a need, fill it.
<br /><br />Lady Gaga: She communicates through music, fashion, and art. An American 
<br />original – no performance or outfit is ever the same; she’s the ultimate re-inventor. This diva’s communication skills don’t end with her ability to influence pop culture – she’s also proven herself to be a compassionate and intelligent speaker, starting with her powerful “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” speech in Maine. Only 26 years old, her movement and her time may only just be beginning. Take-away: Don’t be afraid to be yourself, and express your originality. 
<br /><br />Tony Robbins: The intelligentsia might criticize this self-help master – but who cares? Robbins’ gifts as a motivational speaker, bestselling author, “firewalker,” and success coach is unparalleled in the personal development business. Starting out with little in the way of education or financial resources, he began by promoting Jim Rohn’s career seminars before embarking on his own work as a self-help coach. Now, he’s an international phenomenon with success that his colleagues dream about achieving. More than 4 million people from around the globe have participated in his programs, lectures, workshops and one-on-one sessions, including George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton, Mikhail Gorbachev, Anthony Hopkins, Pamela Anderson, and Quincy Jones. Robbins walks his talks – and has proven his dynamic philosophy works. Who knows how many great communicators he has spawned. Take-away: Believe what you say and others will too.
<br /><br />Richard Branson: The mogul might be best known for his Virgin Group of more than 400 companies, including an ultra hip airline – and that’s saying a lot since most airlines suffer from dismal customer service and dreary on board accommodations. He’s also a consummate adventurer and world traveler, whose attempts to break world records and pull off PR stunts for his brand in air balloons and boats have captured the imagination of admirers the world over. He invests his time and money in many personal causes as well – from encouraging entrepreneurship (he still considers himself one) to improving economic conditions in South Africa to saving the lemur in Madagascar and the polar bear in Canada. In the process he’s been able to bring attention – and funds – to causes that might be lost without his efforts. While he has claimed that he has to force himself to deliver speeches, when he does you can hear a pin drop. No one wants to miss a word this mega-brander has to say. Take-away: If you want to grow, don’t just work on your business; work on the business of your business.
<br /><br />Benjamin Netanyahu: The Israeli Prime Minister is an iconic figure – the epitome of a strong, passionate leader with an unwavering commitment to the survival and strength of the Jewish state. His speech in front of AIPAC in Washington this past March is but one example of his incredible oratory skills, and his ability to argue a point gracefully even while pointing out the errors of those with whom he disagrees. “For fifteen years, I’ve been warning that a nuclear-armed Iran is a grave danger to my country and to the peace and security of the entire world. For the last decade, the international community has tried diplomacy. It hasn’t worked. For six years, the international community has applied sanctions. That hasn’t worked either. I appreciate President Obama’s recent efforts to impose even tougher sanctions against Iran. These sanctions are hurting Iran’s economy, but unfortunately, Iran’s nuclear program continues to march forward. Israel has waited patiently for the international community to resolve this issue. We’ve waited for diplomacy to work. We’ve waited for sanctions to work. None of us can afford to wait much longer. As Prime Minister of Israel, I will never let my people live in the shadow of annihilation,” he told the AIPAC crowd, who stood numerous times to give the Prime Minister thunderous applause. He follows in the footsteps of the founder of his movement, Ze’ev Jabotinsky who was regarded as one of the greatest speakers ever. Take-away: Have convictions, and stick to them.
<br /><br />Jack Welch: He has been called the greatest CEO in America. In practical terms, he earned the name because of General Electric’s unparalleled record of earnings growth and over more than two decades while he was chairman and CEO (1981-2001). He has attributed his success to an ability to focus on solutions and execute them using the right people. In order to do that well, you have to know how to communicate a message and at that Welch is a genius. His secret? “In leadership you have to exaggerate every statement you make. You’ve got to repeat it a thousand times… Overstatements are needed to move a large organization,” he told Thomas Neff and James Citrin in their book Lessons from the Top. Of course, you have to back up works with action – otherwise what you say will never be taken seriously. Today, when Welch gives a speech he embodies true American optimism and risk-taking. Take-away: Words are most valuable when backed up by deeds.
<br /><br />Of course, for many of us the top communicator for change is ourselves – no one is stronger than us in influencing change. Listen to yourself and affect change.

<br /><br />More than a month ago Greg Smith slammed Goldman Sachs in his high-profile public resignation letter. Since then its been continual crisis management for the investment firm. The job of their crisis PR team wont be getting easier anytime soon – In the newest scandal to hit Goldman Sachs, Prosecutors have started a new insider trading probe against a current employee of the firm. Combine that with the upcoming insider trading set to start May 21 for former Goldman Sachs Group director Rajat Gupta and it ain’t looking too pretty.
<br /><br />The Goldman Sachs brand is continually being chipped away at and it is very harmful to “Brand Goldman Sachs.” Liken it to a boxer who is continually taking body blows in the midst of a fight – how many bodyblows can Goldman Sachs stand before it does real damage ? Publics need to know that Goldman Sachs is secure – and that these negatives are isolated, and these continued negative occurrences damage the Goldman Sachs institution.
<br /><br />Google Goldman Sachs – On page 1 &amp; 2, 30% of the entrees are negative. A very negative reflection of one of the world’s largest financial institution – and proof that Goldman better immediately get to work on managing their online reputation. Goldman Sachs has to realize there are two courts involved when it comes to crisis PR: the court of law and the court of public opinion (think Casey Anthony, who may have been found “not guilty” in a court of law but is certainly guilty in the court of public opinion). Both courts matter immensely.
<br /><br />Brand Goldman Sachs is being defined by courts and negative op-eds in high-profile papers. Goldman has a real problem – The legal system at odds with the media system; court proceedings are, by design, long, complicated, and tedious. And media goes on and people form opinions from media (which demands immediacy). Customers, employees, and others are following the media and forming opinions.
<br /><br />Goldman Sachs is facing a court of public opinion which is immediate and viral. Reporters, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, 24/7 cable news, search engine results, etc., aren’t waiting for the next investigation of Goldman Sachs – they are making decisions now. One of the world’s largest financial institutions – so talented and amazing in so many areas needs to handle their public relations with the same efforts as it handles money.
<br /><br />On May 21, 2010 Lloyd Blankfein said in a public address: “We did a good job managing risk; we did a less good job managing our reputation.” Smart people usually learn from their mistakes – clearly that isn’t the case here as the Goldman Sachs brand doesn’t have a communications plan – and needs a crisis PR Agency asap.

<br /><br />Which city will the player end up in – Of course a LA or NY based player can accomplish much more on the marketing front than a player in a market like Phoenix or Seattle. Will the player become a playboy, or will he learn how to dress better – there are many factors which can affect where we would draft a player in a NFL Marketing draft. All of these players will have to deal with be famous millionaires in a short duration of time, and need to analyze every single off-the field decision they make, and keep a solid off-the-field team around them they can trust (Driver, PR Agency, Agent, Financial Consultants, etc.)
<br /><br />Football is a more difficult sport to market athletes in than some others for a variety of reasons – including that their faces are covered, giving them an instant disadvantage vs. certain other sports. Of course, there are also precious few superstar positions for a football player wanting to get endorsement deals – If one’s not a quarterback, wide receiver or running back – even harder to get deals.
<br /><br />Being a winner on the football field doesn’t mean one is necessarily a winner off the field, and they need to be able to balance the tremendous amount of pressure on anyone in the spotlight — money, fame and women. Having worked with professional athletes and high-profile celebrities, the pressure and demands are nonstop.
<br /><br />If we hosted a marketing Pro Day, we’d have many questions and marketing drills we would run players through – without the benefit of that, here goes our draft:
<br /><br /><strong>Andrew Luck, Stanford, QB</strong>
<br /><br />There aren’t many sure things in this business, but Andrew Luck is as close as it gets. Intelligent, charismatic, personable, humble, athletic and an already proven winner and leader at Stanford, Luck is the total package that brands across the country will want to jump on. From a football, as well as marketing perspective, the expectations for Luck will be incredibly high as he likely replaces the poster child for NFL endorsements, Peyton Manning.
<br /><br />TEAM NIKE signing Luck means a ton – it ensures a solid team will surround him, give him a tremendous national platform in any market and work closely with him on his brand. It’s not often that NIKE sports makes mistakes – and that matters.
<br /><br /><strong>Robert Griffin III, Baylor, QB</strong>
<br /><br />RGIII – the name that put Baylor college football on the map, and on paper is one of the most promising draft prospects in the last decade. Overall, Griffin has the potential to be the biggest marketing draw in pro football. With an established nickname like RGIII, it can transcend to the casual fan and average consumer – a sector that is very hard for athletes to tap into, but has huge upside in regards to major contracts and national endorsements.
<br /><br />He has already been a poster child for college athletes with his stellar academic performance and Heisman Trophy play on the field. If everything is as it appears, Mr. Griffin can help any team win on and off the field. As well-spoken and well-rounded as he is, he’s well rounded and can expect many great marketing opportunities. To go from the Baylor to being the face of Adidas — that’s no easy task for anyone, let alone a 21-year-old.
<br /><br /><strong>Dontari Poe, Memphis, DT</strong>
<br /><br />Madison Avenue always loves a great underdog story – surrounded by drugs and crime his whole life, Poe’s story is just that. From the New Orleans Saints during their historic Super Bowl run after Hurricane Katrina to the Baltimore Raven’s Michael Oher, people want to feel connected to something larger than the game itself. I think Poe has the potential to rally behind the big defensive tackle – pushing him into the national media spotlight. Poe has the potential to be success that can make some serious noise.
<br /><br /><strong>Justin Blackmon, Oklahoma State, WR</strong>
<br /><br />Another deadly weapon on the offensive side of the ball, Blackmon is an explosively deep threat that has a huge upside both on and off the field. Blackmon, the young 6’1 wide out has the chance to make a big name for himself and achieve on the marketing front.
<br /><br /><strong>Trent Richardson, Alabama, RB</strong>
<br /><br />In terms of pure marketability, powerful running backs are always an attractive draw. Already accustomed to the national media landscape while playing with Alabama and adding his two BCS National Championships, in addition to his status as a Heisman Trophy finalist into the mix – Richardson presents one lethal combination of experience and success that can make some serious noise on Madison Ave. Oh, being considered the next Emmitt Smith by many industry experts doesn’t hurt your stock either.
<br /><br />And at this early juncture, can we lock in on Matt Barkley for the #1 pick in the marketing draft next year?

<br /><br />Goldman Sachs Finds More Unwanted Publicity in Gupta Case
<br /><br />‘Relevant’ Information
<br /><br />In the SEC lawsuit, Gupta’s lawyers have said that Blankfein, Chief Financial Officer David Viniar, President Gary Cohn, Loeb and retiring Lead Director John Bryan may have information “relevant” to the defense. Another possible witness is Goldman Sachs director Claes Dahlback, a former CEO of Sweden’s Investor AB, who was interviewed by the government, prosecutors told a judge in January.
<br /><br />Naftalis declined to comment on his possible witnesses.
<br /><br />Goldman Sachs’s relationship with Galleon may also come into view. Gupta is alleged to have tipped Rajaratnam in 2007 after listening to a Goldman Sachs board meeting while at Galleon’s offices. Jurors may hear that Goldman Sachs routinely catered lunch for Galleon traders, as the bank did for other big clients, according to an ex-Galleon employee who declined to comment publicly.
<br /><br />Anthony Sabino, a lawyer and professor at the Peter J. Tobin College of Business at St. John’s University in New York, said the publicity will sting even if it doesn’t cost the firm business.
<br /><br />“If you want to do a deal these days in the U.S., you go to Goldman, you go to Morgan Stanley,” he said in a telephone interview. “But when you have multiple instances, then people may say it’s indicative of a lack of internal controls or a permissiveness that lets this thing go on. It’s a slap in the face to management.”
<br /><br />‘Pickup Basketball’
<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc2luc2lkZXIuY29tL2F1dGhvci9yb25uLXRvcm9zc2lhbg__" target="_blank">Ronn Torossian</a>, CEO of 5WPR LLC in New York, which has done work for Coca-Cola Co. (KO) (KO) and McDonald’s Corp. (MCD) (MCD), said Goldman Sachs should move quickly to reclaim its reputation.
<br /><br />The company should stress to the public that recent events involve just a few of its 32,000 employees and that it demands that all employees act ethically, he said. Workers must be “completely above-board,” he said, not even “cheating in their pickup basketball games.”
<br /><br />“Any time you have a stellar firm like that and the words ‘insider trading’ next to it — you start to wonder how long does it go, how much more is there?” he said in a telephone interview. “It’s hard to distance yourself from crisis.”

<br /><br />After eight seasons of murders, mayhem, marriages and madness (and even a real-life Wisteria Lane set fire and ongoing courtroom battle) “Desperate Housewives” comes to an end on Sunday night.
<br /><br />That means the show's leading ladies -- Eva Longoria, Teri Hatcher, Felicity Huffman and Marcia Cross -- have to come up with their second (or third or fourth) acts. So who is best prepared to turn her &quot;Housewife&quot; fame into continued post-show success?
<br /><br />“Other than Eva Longoria, the other women simply don’t have as strong off-screen personas,&quot; <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3Jvbm50b3Jvc3NpYW4uY29tL2Jpb2dyYXBoeQ__" target="_blank">Ronn Torossian</a>, CEO of PR agency 5WPR and author of “For Immediate Release,” told FOX411’s Pop Tarts column. &quot;There is no question that she is the strongest brand. She has great charisma, is beautiful and is clearly driven to do much more.”
<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wZW9wbGUuY29tL3Blb3BsZS9hcnRpY2xlLzAsLDIwNTg5OTQzLDAwLmh0bWw_" target="_blank">Teri Hatcher says end of 'Housewives' just starting to hit her</a>
<br /><br />The recently single Longoria has already inked a deal to host the NBC summer dating show “Ready For Love,” produced by her company UnbeliEVAble Entertainment, and will also be involved with President Obama’s reelection team.
<br /><br />But pop culture writer Mirren Lee doesn't think Longoria has that much of a leg up.
<br /><br />“Eva has the next steps in place already, but I don’t think she has a lot of depth to her persona, and the steps she has in place aren’t exactly challenging as an actress. I expect we’ll see her in a lot of reality stuff and endorsements, like a Kardashian,&quot; Lee said. &quot;I also predict Teri Hatcher may pop up here and there, but not really settle anywhere for awhile. I think she may have trouble actually getting another high profile role for awhile, especially one that lasts.&quot;
<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5qdXN0amFyZWQuY29tLzIwMTIvMDMvMjEvZGVzcGVyYXRlLWhvdXNld2l2ZXMtY2FzdC1jb3Zlci1lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50LXdlZWtseS8_" target="_blank">'House wives' behind the scenes 'untold story'</a>
<br /><br />“Marcia Cross is an interesting one in that she has managed to carve a solid career out of being a soap opera actress – from ‘Knots Landing’ to ‘Melrose Place,’ then on to a show that is a parody of a soap,&quot; Lee explained. &quot;She always plays Marcia, and she plays her well, but she is actually quite a one-dimensional actress.  She has her twins to occupy her, so unless something drops into her lap – another soap type show, I think she may just take some time off.”
<br /><br />Lee said Felicity Huffman is the best actress of the bunch, and has managed to sell herself as both a “down to earth mom” as well as a glamorous star. But surprisingly, that’s not who Lee thinks is poised take Hollywood by storm.
<br /><br />“If success is defined as working constantly, then I predict Kathryn Joosten (who plays Karen McCluskey) will be the busiest right off the bat,” Lee added. “I believe she will outlast them all.  She’s a relative newcomer in Hollywood, only getting her breakthrough role in “The West Wing,” but she has the ability, and interesting personality, to play all sorts of characters. I would love to see her do something along the lines of her acerbic but wise character in ‘The West Wing.’ I don’t think ‘Housewives’ utilized her skills to their deepest level.”

From Winston Churchill to Ronald Reagan, Steve Jobs to Martin Luther King, history is full of individuals who, through their words and deeds, have shifted public opinion and behavior. Barack Obama, Stephen Colbert, and the “Oracle of Omaha” Warren Buffet are all hailed as great communicators – no argument here. President Obama’s communication abilities are absolutely phenomenal. Mr. Colbert, through humor and wit, scores political points and creates cultural references (“Truthiness” anyone<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/unsure.gif" alt=":)" /> that resonate with legions of fans. And of course, it’s not just the financial public that eagerly anticipates Warren Buffet’s yearly shareholder letter – Main Street does too.
<br /><br />These people are always on “most influential” lists for good reason. This 10 Powerful Living Communicators is about living people who have sparked “change” and so the list looks beyond these usual suspects. I’m sure you’ll miss some favorites like Starbuck’s Howard Schultz and Bill Clinton – both consummate communicators. A shout out has to go to Reverend Al Sharpton – controversial for sure, but without his ability to stir a crowd would George Zimmerman have been arrested? 
<br /><br />Let’s shake things up a bit and consider some other people whose ability to change the world, shape opinion, or use innate creativity to leave a long lasting cultural mark are unique. What this diverse group has in common is their ability to reach people emotionally, shift attitudes, and spark trends. There’s something we can learn from each of them about our own ability to make a mark. This is not an academic list – it’s a list from a PR Agency owner. 
<br /><br />In no particular order, here’s my list of the Top 10 Living Communicators Who Influence Change:
<br /><br />n Chris Anderson: Founder of the popular TED Talks, Anderson is a visionary who figured out a way to make speech giving sexy, widely popular, and powerful. Getting an invitation to do a TED Talk is the gold standard when it comes to speaking engagements. Anderson’s ability to spread the message of famous and little known thinkers, scientists, writers, philosophers, and activists remains unprecedented. Who else could have made it possible for 8,660,010 people to hear what Sir Ken Robinson said about the creativity-killing nature of school or 8,087,935 to share in Jill Bolte Taylor’s “Stroke of Insight?” To date more than 290 million people have tuned into or attended a TED Talk. Take-away: Generosity with ideas can change people’s lives.
<br /><br />n Mark Zuckerberg: The story of Facebook is now legendary (not to mention a major motion picture, The Social Network). Zuckerberg co-founded the social-networking website from his Harvard dorm room. It proved so popular he ditched school in his sophomore year to focus on building the site, which now boasts more than 250 million users worldwide. Oh, and the risk has made the 28 year old a billionaire in the process. Facebook has also changed the way people communicate with each other – groups of people with common interests can find each other, people who could never hoped to have met in “real life” have become actual friends. Of course, the site has also spawned addictions to checking updates and playing a variety of games. Facebook has truly become part of the fabric of our lives. Take-away: Good ideas are worth taking a risk on.
<br /><br />n Oprah: This media mogul is much, much more than a talk show host – she is an ultimate communicator who has reached millions of people through her television shows, movies productions, a network (which admittedly still needs work), magazine, and “Lifeclass” seminars and webcasts. Her enthusiasm can sell an obscure novel or a new shade of lipstick – Oprah’s endorsement of a product has literally build brands overnight. She’s so well known and widely respected that you don’t even have to use her last name. Why? Because people trust her – she’s built that trust through honesty, passion, and the ability to reveal herself, including the painful episodes in her life, in a way that resonates with people. Take-away: Respect your constituents by practicing integrity, honesty and authenticity.
<br /><br />n Jay-Z: Born Shawn Corey Carter in 1969, Jay-Z is the most financially and culturally successful hip-hop artist, rapper, songwriter, producer and entrepreneur in the world. According to Forbes, his net worth is about $450 million and he’s sold more than 50 million albums worldwide. He also has 14 Grammies under his belt, and there are surely more to come. When he presided over Def Jam, Jay-Z signed the now mega star Rihanna, and helped Kanye West transition from producer to popular recording artist. He communicates through the fashion world too, with his successful Rocawear line that caters to both adults and children. A film company, upscale sports bars, and part owner of the New Jersey Nets rounds out his impressive portfolio. As he rapped, “I'm not a businessman/ I'm a business, man” – This man sparked the international hip-hop movement. Next step: The Billionaire club. This communications agent for change is well on his way. Take-away: See beyond the trend to the bigger picture, and capitalize on it. 
<br /><br />n Roger Ailes: The man has changed the news business – say his name at a Manhattan cocktail party and you’ll get a range of reactions – from open disgust to whispered appreciation. Ailes is a polemic, combative figure to be sure, but he also changed the face of the news business when News Corp chairman Rupert Murdoch brought Ailes to Fox in 1996 to start a news channel that could compete with CNN. Ailes reportedly made a bold promise to Murdoch – that he could get FNC staffed and operating in six short months – just in time to go head to head with another entry into cable news, MSNBC. Skeptics, including Murdoch, were in abundance, but Ailes launched the network within the time frame and by 2002 it was beating CNN in the ratings war regularly. By sensing a need for another point of view and a different way of delivering the news, Ailes struck a chord with the public that has stuck. According to Nielsen Media Research, as of 2012 FNC continues to outpace both CNN and MSNBC combined in total viewership. You can’t argue with success. Take-away: When you see a need, fill it.
<br /><br />n Lady Gaga: She communicates through music, fashion, and art. An American 
<br />original – no performance or outfit is ever the same; she’s the ultimate re-inventor. This diva’s communication skills don’t end with her ability to influence pop culture – she’s also proven herself to be a compassionate and intelligent speaker, starting with her powerful “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” speech in Maine.  Only 26 years old, her movement and her time may only just be beginning. Take-away: Don’t be afraid to be yourself, and express your originality. 
<br /><br />n Tony Robbins: The intelligentsia might criticize this self-help master – but who cares? Robbins’ gifts as a motivational speaker, bestselling author, “firewalker,” and success coach is unparalleled in the personal development business. Starting out with little in the way of education or financial resources, he began by promoting Jim Rohn’s career seminars before embarking on his own work as a self-help coach. Now, he’s an international phenomenon with success that his colleagues dream about achieving. More than 4 million people from around the globe have participated in his programs, lectures, workshops and one-on-one sessions, including George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton, Mikhail Gorbachev, Anthony Hopkins, Pamela Anderson, and Quincy Jones. Robbins walks his talks – and has proven his dynamic philosophy works. Who knows how many great communicators he has spawned. Take-away: Believe what you say and others will too.
<br /><br />n Richard Branson: The mogul might be best known for his Virgin Group of more than 400 companies, including an ultra hip airline – and that’s saying a lot since most airlines suffer from dismal customer service and dreary on board accommodations. He’s also a consummate adventurer and world traveler, whose attempts to break world records and pull off PR stunts for his brand in air balloons and boats have captured the imagination of admirers the world over. He invests his time and money in many personal causes as well – from encouraging entrepreneurship (he still considers himself one) to improving economic conditions in South Africa to saving the lemur in Madagascar and the polar bear in Canada. In the process he’s been able to bring attention – and funds – to causes that might be lost without his efforts. While he has claimed that he has to force himself to deliver speeches, when he does you can hear a pin drop. No one wants to miss a word this mega-brander has to say. Take-away: If you want to grow, don’t just work on your business; work on the business of your business.
<br /><br />n Benjamin Netanyahu: The Israeli Prime Minister is an iconic figure – the epitome of a strong, passionate leader with an unwavering commitment to the survival and strength of the Jewish state. His speech in front of AIPAC in Washington this past March is but one example of his incredible oratory skills, and his ability to argue a point gracefully even while pointing out the errors of those with whom he disagrees. “For fifteen years, I’ve been warning that a nuclear-armed Iran is a grave danger to my country and to the peace and security of the entire world. For the last decade, the international community has tried diplomacy. It hasn’t worked. For six years, the international community has applied sanctions. That hasn’t worked either. I appreciate President Obama’s recent efforts to impose even tougher sanctions against Iran. These sanctions are hurting Iran’s economy, but unfortunately, Iran’s nuclear program continues to march forward. Israel has waited patiently for the international community to resolve this issue. We’ve waited for diplomacy to work. We’ve waited for sanctions to work. None of us can afford to wait much longer. As Prime Minister of Israel, I will never let my people live in the shadow of annihilation,” he told the AIPAC crowd, who stood numerous times to give the Prime Minister thunderous applause. He follows in the footsteps of the founder of his movement, Ze’ev Jabotinsky who was regarded as one of the greatest speakers ever. Take-away: Have convictions, and stick to them.
<br /><br />n Jack Welch: He has been called the greatest CEO in America. In practical terms, he earned the name because of General Electric’s unparalleled record of earnings growth and over more than two decades while he was chairman and CEO (1981-2001). He has attributed his success to an ability to focus on solutions and execute them using the right people. In order to do that well, you have to know how to communicate a message and at that Welch is a genius. His secret? “In leadership you have to exaggerate every statement you make. You’ve got to repeat it a thousand times… Overstatements are needed to move a large organization,” he told Thomas Neff and James Citrin in their book Lessons from the Top. Of course, you have to back up works with action – otherwise what you say will never be taken seriously. Today, when Welch gives a speech he embodies true American optimism and risk-taking. Take-away: Words are most valuable when backed up by deeds.
<br /><br />Of course, for many of us the top communicator for change is ourselves – no one is stronger than us in influencing change. Listen to yourself and affect change.

<br /><br />The great Zionist leader Ze’ev Jabotinsky once said: “It is not the antisemitism of men; it is, above all, the antisemitism of things, the inherent xenophobia of the body social or the body economic under which we suffer.”  In my opinion, nowadays, the “antisemitism of things” which Ze’ev Jabotinsky spoke of, should include the media.
<br /><br />In one of the latest acts of antisemitism,  a survey was conducted of more than 28,000 people in 27 countries, asking respondents to label 12 countries as having a positive or negative influence. The list included Britain, Canada, China, France, India, Iran, Israel, Japan, North Korea, Russia, the USA, Venezuela, and the European Union. The country with the highest number of negative responses overall was Israel (56% negative, 17% positive), followed by Iran (54% negative 18% positive), the United States (51% negative, 30% positive), and North Korea (48% negative, 19% positive).”Israel also stands out for having the largest number of countries (23 of 27) viewing it negatively. Iran is regarded unfavorably in 21 countries, the United States and North Korea in 20.”
<br /><br />It is my belief that this sickening phenomenon can be explained by rampant antisemitism amongst so many media professionals around the world.
<br /><br />The following important words were written by Pilar Rahola a few years ago – a Spanish leftist politician, journalist and activist:
<br /><br />Why don’t we see demonstrations against Islamic dictatorships in London, Paris, Barcelona? Or demonstrations against the Burmese dictatorship? Why aren’t there demonstrations against the enslavement of millions of women who live without any legal protection? Why aren’t there demonstrations against the use of children as human bombs?
<br /><br />Why is there never any outrage against the acts of terrorism committed against Israel?  Why is there no outcry by the European left against Islamic fanaticism?  Why don’t they defend Israel’s right to exist?  And finally, the million dollar question: Why is the left in Europe and around the world obsessed with the two most solid democracies, the United States and Israel, and not with the worst dictatorships on the planet? The two most solid democracies, who have suffered the bloodiest attacks of terrorism and the left doesn’t care.
<br /><br />And then, to the concept of freedom. In every pro Palestinian European forum, I hear the left yelling with fervor: “We want freedom for the people!” Not true. They are never concerned with freedom for the people of Syria, or Yemen, or Iran, or Sudan, or other such nations. And they are never preoccupied when Hamas destroys freedom for the Palestinians. They are only concerned with using the concept of Palestinian freedom as a weapon against Israeli freedom. The resulting consequence of these ideological pathologies is the manipulation of the press.
<br /><br />The international press does major damage when reporting on the question of the Israeli-Palestinian issue. On this topic they don’t inform, they propagandize. When reporting about Israel, the majority of journalists forget the reporter code of ethics. And so, any Israeli act of self-defense becomes a massacre, and any confrontation, genocide. So many stupid things have been written about Israel, that there aren’t any accusations left to level against her.
<br /><br />And yet, through it all, the Jewish nation and the Jewish people continue to thrive and grow.

<br /><br />A newly released global reputation management study of more than 100,000 consumers shows that who you are as a company is more important than what you produce, with BMW, Sony and Walt Disney Company topping the list of the most reputable companies. The third annual Global RepTrak 100, by reputation consultancy firm Reputation Institute, identifies how stakeholders perceive companies and how those perceptions affect purchasing behavior.
<br /><br />The study shows that in order to win support and recommendations, a company needs to tell its story in a way that connects with stakeholders on a global level. This is a challenge that even the best companies struggle with. Nowhere was a strong reputation platform and good public relations more important this year than with IT giant Apple, which maintained its high ranking despite the loss of its iconic leader, Steve Jobs. &quot;In today's reputation economy, what you stand for matters more than what you produce and sell,&quot; said Reputation Institute's executive partner Kasper Ulf Nielsen in a news release. &quot;People's willingness to buy, recommend, work for and invest in a company is driven 60 percent by their perceptions of the company and only 40 percent by their perceptions of their products.&quot;
<br /><br />The companies with the ten best global reputations are:
<br /><br />1. BMW
<br />2. Sony
<br />3. Walt Disney Company
<br />4. Daimler
<br />5. Apple
<br />6. Google
<br />7. Microsoft
<br />8. Volkswagen
<br />9. Canon
<br />10. LEGO Group
<br /><br />Results from the 2012 Global RepTrak 100 study showed a strong correlation between a company's reputation and consumers' willingness to recommend it. For the top companies, 55 percent of consumers said they would definitely recommend their products to others, compared with only 22 percent for the companies at the bottom of the list.

<br /><br />A former client, who also happens to be a nasty person, manufactures a great product that got amazing media. He was tremendously successful but is just not a good guy. He, too, was approached to do a guest spot on a reality show, and my whole team cautioned strongly against it again and again. Sure enough, he didn’t listen and had an awful appearance on the program, which had a serious and quick negative impact on his business.
<br /><br />His appearance resulted in his company being blasted, and wherever he went, people asked him about the program but not his product. In fact, as this book went to print, three of the first ten items on a Google search of his name and product reference this program. I’d venture his ego cost him millions.
<br /><br />There are times when a reality show can work. It depends on many factors: the script (unscripted television is actually quite scripted, by the way), your personality, the producers of the show, and your business. Anyone with a special expertise that can be used in the right way probably has the best chance of reality success.
<br /><br />Under these circumstances, a show can be a PR machine for a small business. Antique dealers and bounty hunters, for example, could benefit from shows that follow their comings and goings. DC Cupcakes on TLC has been a great show for its stars, Sophie and Katherine, who left high-powered careers behind to start Georgetown Cupcake. In its second season, the show has raised awareness for the cupcake brand and has created numerous revenue streams for the pair.
<br /><br />Although the show depicts dramatic situations (the usual bickering, tension between business partners, nutty customers), it’s all done in a lighthearted and humorous way that fits with the original cupcake brand.
<br /><br />In this case, the show has raised the profile of the women’s bakery. When the show goes off the air, the two women will likely still have a successful bakery to run and maybe even other business opportunities. As the show’s executive producer, Terence Noonan, points out, “The girls still ice cupcakes, and at the end of the day, that’s their most important job.” When you stop doing what got you attention in the first place, you can run into trouble.
<br /><br />The Book can be purchased at:
