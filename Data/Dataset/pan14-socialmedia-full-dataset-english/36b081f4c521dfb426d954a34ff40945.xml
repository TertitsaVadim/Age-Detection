<br /><br />This test only has one question, but it's a very important one.
<br />By giving an honest answer, you will discover where you stand morally.
<br /><br />The test features an unlikely, completely fictional situation in which you will have to make a decision.
<br /><br />THE SITUATION
<br /><br />Johannesburg has seen its worst storm in living memory.
<br /><br />There is chaos all around with severe flooding.
<br />You are a photo-journalist working for a major newspaper, and you're caught in the middle of this epic disaster.
<br /><br />The situation is nearly hopeless.
<br />You're trying to shoot career-making photos.
<br />There are houses and people disppappearing into the water.
<br />Nature is unleashing all its destructive fury.
<br /><br />THE TEST
<br /><br />Suddenly, you see a man in the water.
<br /><br />He is fighting for his life, trying not to be taken down with the debris.
<br />You move closer... somehow, the man looks familiar...
<br />You suddenly realise who it is... It's Julius Malema!
<br />You notice that the raging waters are about to take him under forever.
<br />You have two options:
<br /><br />(1) you can save the life of Julius Malema or
<br /><br />(2) you can shoot a dramatic Pulitzer Prize-winning photo, documenting
<br />the death of one of the country's most powerful men!
<br /><br />THE QUESTION
<br /><br />Here's the question, and please give an honest answer. . .
<br /><br />(A) Would you select high contrast colour film, or 
<br /><br />(<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cool.gif" alt=":)" /> would you go with a more classic ........black and white film?

<br /><br />told her a story and listened to her prayers which she ended by saying:&quot;God bless Mommy,God bless Daddy,God bless Grandma and good-bye Grandpa.&quot;
<br /><br />The father asked, &quot;Why did you say good-bye grandpa?&quot;
<br /><br />The little girl said, &quot;I don't know daddy, it just seemed like the thing to do.&quot;
<br /><br />The next day grandpa died. The father thought it was a strange coincidence. 
<br /><br />A few months later the father put the girl to bed and listened to her prayers which went like this:&quot;God bless Mommy,God Bless Daddy and good-bye Grandma.&quot;
<br /><br />The next day the grandmother died. 
<br /><br />Oh my gosh, thought the father,this kid is in contact with the other side. 
<br /><br />Several weeks later when the girl was going to bed the dad heard her say:&quot;God bless Mommy and good-bye Daddy.&quot;
<br /><br />He practically went into shock. He couldn't sleep all night and got up at the crack! of dawn to go to his office. 
<br /><br />He was nervous as a cat all day, had lunch sent in and watched the clock. 
<br /><br />He figured if he could get by until midnight he would be okay. 
<br /><br />He felt safe in the office, so instead of going home at the end of the day he stayed there, drinking coffee, looking at his watch and jumping at every sound. 
<br /><br />Finally midnight arrived, he breathed a sigh of relief and went home. 
<br /><br />When he got home his wife said &quot;I've never seen you work so late,what's the matter?&quot;He said &quot;I don't want to talk about it, I've just spent the worst day of my life.&quot;
<br /><br />She said &quot;You think you had a bad day, you'll never believe what happened to me. 
<br /><br />This morning the milkman dropped dead on our porch!

<br /><br />By Desiree Leigh Thompson 
<br /><br />If you choose to call a setback, a collapse, a deterioration, a lack, an inability, or falling short of by the word failure then do so. Somehow I'm not sure if I really agree that there are any failures in life when I really think about it. To me failures are more like sign posts, big and small, for clarification, awareness, restructuring, rethinking, new perspectives, and another detour to awakenings. Failure is not an option; it just is. It's like death; it's not an option. It just is. However, we've tagged the word failure as being useless, worthless, weak, wimpy, incapable, or a downright idiot. Nonetheless, what is an option is whether you get up from that failure or setback, or allow it to take you down.
<br /><br />Every failure symbolizes one more step taken on the road to success as one's faith is in the presence of true self hood. You must go deep within to the true essence of your mind's eye and know that It is greater than any obstacle before you. Yes, you are human. You will falter. Rest if you must, however, you must keep striving. You must continue with persistence, and be tenacious. Do the work to let go of following the crowd and pleasing everyone in the family,colleague, and friend realm. You have a purpose. You are the only one that knows that purpose. If you keep following a man-made deity or what society preaches to you, you will only be disappointed. Call it stubborn. I choose strong-will and higher independence.
<br /><br />The worst part about sitting back and being afraid to fail, is the feeling of regret. Regret begins to eat you alive. Bit-by-bit and day-by-day. Regret doesn't go away until you stand up courageously, move through the failure by taking a risk, and know that there is greater possibility in front of you... and that YOU can achieve it. That you have that ability, that strength in the face of all adversity, with the divine power flowing within, to do it. In the process, find out what failure has accomplished you; and, anytime you get down on yourself about the mistakes you've made, remember these accomplishments from the failings.
<br /><br />I hope this message uplifts, and empower you, to get clear on life's direction and what's meaningful. At the same time, you improve your emotional, mental, and physical state of being, which gives you freedom &amp; calm from the internal chaos and the world around you.
<br /><br />Regards
<br /><br />China Gangan
