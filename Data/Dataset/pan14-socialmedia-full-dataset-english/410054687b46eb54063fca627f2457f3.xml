<br />Girl: &quot;Can we do what?&quot;
<br />Guy: &quot;You know, can I be your first, finally?&quot;
<br />Girl: &quot;Um.....no.&quot;
<br />Guy: &quot;Why?&quot;
<br />Girl: &quot;Because, 1. you have a girlfriend, who happens to be my friend.......&quot;
<br />Guy: &quot;So, if you don't tell, I won' tell.&quot;
<br />Girl: &quot;Besides that, I'm waiting for someone special. Someone that I want to be with for the rest of my life to be my first.&quot;
<br />Guy: &quot;I'm not special to you?&quot;
<br />Girl: &quot;You're my friend. That's all.&quot;
<br />Guy looks forward and keeps driving. 5 minutes pass....... Guy starts to run his hand up the girl's thigh.
<br />Girl: moves his hand, &quot;Don't touch me!&quot;
<br />Guy: tries to kiss her.
<br />Girl: screams, &quot;Would you stop.&quot;
<br />Guy: continues trying.
<br />Girl: moves to the back seat
<br />Guy: parks on an abandoned street and gets in the backseat with the girl
<br />Starts to kiss her..
<br />Girl: pushes him off and scoots over, &quot;Please, don't do this.&quot;
<br />Guy: &quot;Don't do what, I know you want it, I can see it in your eyes.&quot;
<br />Moves over to her and starts to unbutton her pants.
<br />Girl: pushes him harder and says, &quot;No, don't.&quot;
<br />Guy: getting aggravated, punches her and tells her to stop &quot;playing hard to get&quot;.
<br />Girl: crying, continues to fight.
<br />Guy: punches her harder, pulls her pants off, and holds her down.
<br />Girl: screams as he penetrates her, &quot;NO, please don't do this to me!&quot;
<br />Guy: puts his hand over her mouth.
<br />An hour passes.........
<br />Guy: pulls back and wipes himself off.
<br />Girl: sits on the corner of the seat, sobbing.
<br />Guy: looks at her and says, &quot;You better not tell anybody about this. If you're really my friend, you won't tell anybody. You know I love you.&quot; He reaches out his hand to touch her cheek.
<br />Girl: pulls back, &quot;Just take me home, now.&quot;
<br />Guy: says, &quot;Alright.&quot; Gets in the front seat and drives her home.
<br />2 months later.........
<br />Girl: &quot;Doctor, what's wrong with me. I haven't had my time of the month in 2 months.&quot;
<br />Doctor: looks at her, &quot;You haven't been having your &quot;time&quot; for a reason.&quot;
<br />Girl: looks at him and says, &quot;Why?&quot; dreading the answer that she was sure to receive.
<br />Doctor: &quot;You are pregnant.&quot;
<br />Girl: faints.
<br /><br />The story gets out that she is pregnant, and people start looking to the guy. He claims that it isn't his because she was sleeping with every guy in the school (which was a lie). He goes to her and tells her, &quot;I'm telling you, if you lie to people and say that I raped you, I'll kill you.&quot;
<br /><br />The Girl is completely devastated. First, he took her virginity and got her pregnant....then he lied about it. So completely depressed......the girl commits suicide by drug overdose.......
<br />Girls, if this story touched you, repost it as &quot;That's Fucked up&quot;
<br />Guys, if this story touched you, repost it as &quot;I'll kill any fucker who does this&quot; if you care

<br /><br />Anybody under the age of 13 should not read this,
<br />and if you do, you should not repost this.
<br />Just because you were born in '97 doesn't mean you're a 90's kid.
<br />It's not like you could remember the original Simpsons.
<br />I am sorry but three conscious years of the 90's just wont cut it.
<br />You're a 90's kid if:
<br />You can finish this [ice ice _ _ _ _ ]
<br />You remember watching Doug, Ren &amp; Stimpy, Pinky and the Brain
<br />AAAAAAAH Real Monsters!
<br />You've ever ended a sentence with the word &quot;PSYCHE!&quot;
<br />You just cant resist finishing this . . . &quot;Iiiiiiin west philidelphia born and raised . . .&quot;
<br />You remember TGIF, Step by Step, Family Matters, Dinosaurs, and Boy Meets World.

<br />You remember reading &quot;Goosebumps&quot;
<br />You took plastic cartoon lunch boxes to school.
<br />You still get the urge to say &quot;NOT&quot; after (almost) every sentence . . . not
<br />when everything was settled by rock paper scissors..or bubble gum bubble gum in a dish...and even better daddy had a donkey inky binky bonky.
<br />when you'd go to the same freakin place on a feild trip every freakin year
<br />when britney spears was cool and backsteet and nsync were gods.
<br />when cops and robbers was a daily activity.
<br />when we played Hide and go seek until our legs grew numb.
<br />when we used to obey our parents
<br />You used to listen to the radio all day long just to record your FAVORITE song of ALL time.
<br />&quot;Where in the World is Carmen San Diego?&quot; was both a game and a TV game show.
<br />Captain Planet. He's a Hero.
<br />You knew that Kimberly, the pink ranger, and Tommy, the green ranger, were meant to be together.
<br />You remember when Super Nintendos and Sega Genisis became popular.
<br />You always wanted to send in a tape to America's Funniest Home Videos . . . but never taped anything funny.
<br />You remember watching Home Alone 1, 2 , and 3 . . . and tried to pull the pranks on &quot;intruders&quot;
<br />You remember watching The Magic School Bus, Wishbone, and Reading Rainbow on PBS.
<br />You remember when Yo-Yos were cool.
<br />You remember those Where's Waldo books.
<br />You remember eating Warheads.
<br />You remember watching the 1st Batman, Aladin, Ninja Turtles, and 3 Ninjas movies.
<br />You remember Ring Pops.
<br />You remember drinking Surge, and Tang.
<br />If you remember when every thing was &quot;da BOMB!&quot;
<br />When they made the new lunchables so that you could make pizza AND tacos.
<br />You remember boom boxes vs. cd players.
<br />Making those little paper fortune cookie things, and then predicting your life with them.
<br />You played and/or collected &quot;Pogs&quot;
<br />You had at least one Tamagotchi, GigaPet, or Nano and brought it everywhere.
<br />. . . Furbies.
<br />You haven't always had a computer, and it was cool to have the internet.
<br />And Windows 95 was the best.
<br />You watched the original cartoons of Rugrats, Power Rangers, and Ninja Turtles.
<br />Michael Jordan was a king.
<br />YIKES pencils and erasers were the stuff!
<br />All your school supplies were &quot;Lisa Frank&quot; brand.
<br />You remember when the new Beanie Babies and Talking Elmo were always sold out.
<br />You collected those Beanie Babies.
<br />Carebears
<br />Gak was the coolest stuff invented.
<br />Lambchop's song never ended.
<br />The old dollar bills.
<br />Silver dollars, which were cool to have.
<br />You remember a time before the WB.
<br />You collected all the Troll dolls
<br />If you even know what an original walkman is.
<br />You remember wanting to sit on the orange Nickelodeon couch.
<br />You've gotten creeped out by &quot;Are You Afraid of the Dark?&quot;
<br />You know the Macarena by heart.
<br />&quot;Talk to the hand&quot; . . . enough said
<br />You always said, &quot;Then why don't you marry it!&quot;
<br />You know the significance of the number 23.
<br />When you played Super Mario on a daily basis.
<br />Gameboy Pockets.
<br />You went to McDonald's to play in the playplace.
<br />You remember playing on merry go rounds at the playground.
<br />Before the MySpace frenzy . . .
<br />Before the Internet &amp; text messaging . . .
<br />Before Sidekicks &amp; iPods . . .
<br />Before Panic at the Disco . . .
<br />Before PlayStation2 or X-BOX . . .
<br />Before Spongebob . . .
<br />Back when you put off the 5 hours of homework you had every night.
<br />When light up sneakers were cool.
<br />When you rented VHS tapes, not DVDs.
<br />When gas was $0.95 a gallon &amp; Caller ID was a new thing.
<br />When we recorded stuff on VCRs.
<br />When we called the radio station to request songs to hear off of our walkmans.
<br />Pokemon and digimon were on the rage!
<br />Way back.
<br />Before we realized all this would eventually disappear.
<br />Who would have thought you'd miss the 90's so much!!!!!
<br />Post this in your bulletin if you remember these days . . . .
