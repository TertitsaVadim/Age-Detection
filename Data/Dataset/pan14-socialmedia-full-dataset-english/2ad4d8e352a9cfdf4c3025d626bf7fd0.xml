If you’re even remotely up to date on current events, then you should know that climate change is real, and it’s happening right now. Don’t wait for your government to go ahead and make changes. Don’t wait for big corporations to pitch in and change. Change what you are in control of changing. Focus on the simple, doable tasks. The actions are small, but they make waves that ripple far and affect others.

<br />I feel abandoned, 
<br />My hair wet, resting on the black washed waters.
<br /><br />I thought to myself
<br />was I a drift amongst the rivers
<br />The lakes,
<br />Or even the ocean?
<br />Or was I drifting amongst the stars?
<br /><br />I felt alone
<br />Life amidst far could not locate
<br />But the blackness that surrounds me
<br />ingulfs what left of my life force
<br /><br />So I stare at the stars
<br />Thinking, what tiny bit of my memories could arose,
<br />What life would take me
<br />As I afloat in this wet marshall
<br />Randomly in the location I was placed
<br />Drifting out of nowhere - time, place were non existant
<br />.

<br />But thats how I really feel I guess
<br />Today nothing or anything comes to mind
<br />But the feeling of subtlety of whatever kind
<br /><br />I feel sad now a days but that's how it goes
<br />So I stare at nothing but at the floor and my toes
<br />Then again I've convinced myself right
<br />I just stand there out of place, out of sight
<br /><br />Alot goes in there but never the courage to dump
<br />As it feels like a goosebump or some kind of cramp
<br />But I try my best to feel alright
<br />Just then I poor out my heart at night
<br /><br />But whatever right...
<br /><br />Is there time to follow my heart
<br />To find were to begin, were to start
<br />Or have my emotions gone over me
<br />To be blinded for what I must see?
<br /><br />My perspective, my point of view
<br />Shapeshifts and morphs to a new
<br />About how I see life as it progress upon my naked eyes
<br />As to sight my eyes can no longer rise

People say that actual intercource is a way to lose your virginity, anything that involves any penetration, except one from your own. The time when someone loses there virginity, the occasion can somtimes be moody and sentual, but in some it could be a disaster. 
<br /><br />But why lose your virginity when you commit not losing it? In our society, sex is something that is forced into us, like pure-pressure. In one case a girl got dump because she did not answer the question &quot;Condom or no condom?&quot; Mostly girls are forced into this pressure because it is obvious that guys are the more sexually mentally active. Guys, in fact, think of sex every thirty sexonds, while gurlz imagine it every ten minutes.
<br /><br />Losing your virginity, it is crusial that you replace the environment with a more sentual and atmospheric mood in order to remove any buffs of negativity. I mean who would want to feel the awkward sensation after the first sex <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/dry.gif" alt=":)" /> . In many cases, people have said their first sex was really horrible and awkward the fact that improper set of atmosphere was present. An example, was one guy having his first with a gurl, while his parents and grandparents were downstairs; the mixture of plessure and anxieties equals an unstable concoction <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/wink.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/wink.gif" alt=":)" /> .
<br /><br />Anytime that you lose your virginity, always remind yourself to set a mood that is issential for your love-making. But if you decide to be clean, it is good to understand that peer-pressure is associated with losing your virginity; that way you will be ready for any challenges that you stumble upon the road of your untarnished life.
