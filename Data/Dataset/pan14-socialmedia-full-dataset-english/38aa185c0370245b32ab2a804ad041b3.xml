<br /><br />The advent of Lord Krishna is celebrated by devotees around the world with pomp and circumstance, a festival called Janmashtami.
<br />In the Bhagavad-gita, Lord Krishna states: &quot;Whenever and wherever there is a decline in religious principles, and a predominant rise of irreligion, at that time I descend Myself.&quot; (Bhagavad-gita, Chapter 4, Text 7)
<br /><br />5,000 years ago demonic kings ruled the Earth and exploited her resources. At that time the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Sri Krishna, appeared in the land of Vrindavan. He performed godly feats, destroyed demons, lifted Govardhana Hill, and expanded Himself into hundreds of cowherd boys and calves to humble Lord Brahma. At the climax of His advent, documented in the epic Mahabharata as the battle of Kurushetra, Lord Krishna spoke the Bhagavad-gita to instruct mankind. Shortly thereafter He returned to His eternal abode, Goloka Vrindavan, in the spiritual sky.
<br /><br />How Janmashtami is Celebrated
<br />On Janmashtami, devotees rise early and spend the day absorbed in prayer and meditation, fasting until midnight (except for water.) At temples, the Deities of Lord Krishna and His companion Srimati Radharani are bathed with auspicious ingredients including milk, honey, yogurt, and fruit juices.
<br /><br />Artists perform dances, dramas and musicals glorifying the advent of Lord Krishna.
<br /><br />Some devotees dress the Deities elaborately with outfits made entirely of flowers, while others prepare 108 dishes of delicious foods for the Lord.
<br /><br />At midnight, the time when Lord Krishna appeared, conchshells, drums and cymbals sound tumultuously. The altar curtains open to reveal the Deities of Their Lordships, Sri Sri Radha-Krishna, beautifully dressed in flower outfits, surrounded by 108 preparations of delicous foods. The crowd erupts in joyful celebration with a midnight arati ceremony, singing sacred hymns, chanting, dancing, and concluding with a feast to break the fast.
<br /><br />Janmashtami is the largest and most important festival for devotees of Krishna. It is a good time to visit your nearest Hare Krishna temple to get a glimpse into the opulent Krishna culture and tradition. You'll experience colorful dances, theatrical performances, melodious music, sweet smelling incense and fragrant flowers, interact with many spiritually minded people, and partake in a delicious vegetarian feast prepared with love and devotion. Check our listing of <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.krishna.com%2Fmain.php%3Fid%3D31"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.krishna.com/main.php?id=31</a>” 500+Hare Krsna centers for the one nearest you.
