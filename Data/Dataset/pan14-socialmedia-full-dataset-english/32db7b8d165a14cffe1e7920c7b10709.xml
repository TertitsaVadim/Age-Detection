Visibly, the consumer desired to dig a hole and conceal.  He was mortified!  His pet aggressively ongoing in his attempts at canine mounting and pet humping on mine, specially likely for the head.  (My excellent-natured, large dog very easily shook him off.)<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;I didn't know my puppy was queer,&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; he mentioned really sheepishly and apologetically.  I could not include my laughter as I reassured the male that it was not so.  How typical is that misconception?  In the puppy entire world, there is no this kind of factor as a &quot;gay puppy!&quot;<br /><br />1 puppy mounting more than one more one's head, or even unsheathing his penis, is pretty common.  The mounting pet is significantly attempting to seize management above all other people.  The unsheathing is to launch his scent on the other pet, to proclaim to all the other individuals that he won the fight more than this 1.<br /><br />Consider about this fact: If a male pet mounts a female for mating uses, his equipment does not pass up its focus on. He does not fall short to place it in the correct put. If his intentions towards another douleur dog were sexual, it would be done. Be aware that his intention, when riding up from powering the other dog, is Over the tail and back, not beneath the tail.  That is NOT sexual!  Riding up on an additional dog's again raises the first pet higher than him. It is a reminder that, &lt;i&gt;&quot;Hey, you're not the chef right here!&quot;&lt;/i&gt;<br /><br />When the pet mounts one more one's head, he is planning to one particular of the most excessive shows of dominance in the canine planet. The head is the highest portion of the canine. Getting the head down delivers the pet down from his best point. It is all about who is larger than whom.<br /><br />When a canine unsheathes his penis and releases liquid, that forces the dog who is leaked on to don the scent of the dominant a single. It is a very effective scent and stays for some time, producing the low rank obvious for a lot of miles -- and even to other packs in scent assortment.<br /><br />Canines consistently attempt to dominate each and every other.  That is pet instinctive conduct, between the rituals they go by means of each and every time they meet every single other.  The pet dogs will 1st size each other up via eye speak to.  If 1 surrenders by lying down, then leadership is settled.  If not, the wrestle for dominance really starts.<br /><br />As they wrestle for the dominant puppy situation, the canines carry on to mount each and every other right up until a single rolls over submissively and turns his eyes absent.  Right up until the eyes have totally turned absent, surrender has not took place, and the canine who is shedding may try a sneak attack against the other.  Seem out!<br /><br />We &lt;i&gt;homo sapiens&lt;/i&gt; normally desire the problem of a activity this sort of as &quot;rock-paper-scissors,&quot; a mind game like chess or Scrabble, or a socially acceptable ball game.  It is significantly less uncomfortable to the general public eye.<br /><br />You have occasionally witnessed dog fights break out as the pet dogs jockey for position, via wrestling or stare-down dares.
