Steeped in history, this picturesque fishing port has a full maritime history.  In addition to the religious history, there is a maritime theme running throughout the ages with connections to the whaling industry and Captain Cook.Nowadays, however, the main industry of the town is tourism.  Situated on the Yorkshire coastline, it enjoys beautiful scenery and easy accessibility by the huge number of visitors each year.
<br /><br />The tourism sector has increased rapidly over the last century and in response, the retail business numbers have risen to meet the demand. The local population are the mainstay customers of many of the &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wonderfulwhitby.co.uk%2Fwheretoshop.html%26quot%3B%26gt%3Bshops"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.wonderfulwhitby.co.uk/wheretoshop.html&quot;&gt;shops</a> in Whitby&lt;/a&gt; as to be expected. A number of supermarkets cater to the everyday shopping needs in addition to the other specialised shops such as the greengrocers, bakers and butchers.    It is stated many times that the growth of the larger supermarkets can stifle  competition and be the demise of the local small retailers, in Whitby it would appear that they can both survive and live alongside each other.  Plans are foot to build a larger out of town supermarket, such plans have been passed by the local council but building has yet to be commenced.
<br /><br />Shoe and clothing retailers are in evidence and have increased over the last five years.    In addition to the regular shoe and clothing shops, there are a number of ‘alternative'  outlets catering to the Gothic population, some of which reside in the town, but whose main custom is from the influx of visitors of the Gothic persuasion to Whitby Goth Weekends.  In spring and autumn of each year, the town hosts a Gothic weekend which has become increasingly popular with large numbers of visitors from all around the country and also a few visitors worldwide.
<br /><br />On the west side of the town, the chemists, tobacconists and the flower shops are to be found.  The town is divided in two by the River Esk but joined by the Old Whitby Swing Bridge and the ‘New Bridge  further up river.  It can be said that the west side of the town houses the more everyday &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wonderfulwhitby.co.uk%2Fwheretoshop.html%26quot%3B%26gt%3BWhitby"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.wonderfulwhitby.co.uk/wheretoshop.html&quot;&gt;Whitby</a> shops&lt;/a&gt; which are largely frequented by the local population.   There are a couple of stores which specialise in merchandise at low prices and are of a non-food variety. Items for sale include, small soft furnishings, crockery, light bulbs, gardening supplies, toys etc. 
<br /><br />Whitby has, in common with many other towns in the country, a number of  charity shops. Primarily situated on the western side, there must be at least seven in total.  Raising funds for their  charity, these shops are visited by the local population and the visitors alike, browsing at their leisure for perhaps a bargain or two.
<br /><br />Newsagents and confectionery shops are to be found on both sides of the river, meeting the needs of local and visitor alike. Book shops are increasingly popular showcasing many local authors' publications and  book signings.  Many an author can be found in the town autographing their latest publication. Not surprisingly a number of the  authors are local and their books are quite often based  on local places, events and persons past and present.  
<br /><br />Completing the line-up of retail outlets in the town are the off-licences and the video rental shops probably aimed exclusively to the local market.  Although there are the larger towns of Scarborough, Middlesbrough and York within perhaps an  hour to and hour and a half drive away, many folk are happy to give their custom to the local shops and local community.

Bed and breakfast properties in Whitby or B &amp; Bs Whitby, as they are more commonly known , are less formal and are private homes in which the owners will let rooms for guests.

Whitby has a historical past, and an ancient seafaring heritage. From its early beginnings as  a wooden monastery perched on a cliff top, it has developed through the ages to the town it is today.
<br /><br />When Saint  Hilda established Whitby Abbey in 657, little would it be imagined that this imposing building dominating  the cliff top, would oversee 100's of years of history developing below her sacred grounds. The Vikings were the earliest visitors to the town of Whitby, who unfortunately decided to pillage the town and destroy the Abbey (later to be rebuilt). Happily the modern day visitor to the town has no such destructive intent.
<br /><br />In the intervening years, however, the course of history has observed various sorts of activities around the town. The famous explorer Captain James Cook served his apprenticeship and began his naval career from Whitby. A former resident of Whitby, Captain William Scoresby, the great whaling captain, who, by the way, invented the crow's nest lookout, sailed out of Whitby Harbour on his whaling expeditions. The port of Whitby at one time had one of the largest fishing fleets on the North East Coast and was instrumental in the exportation of alum from the local mines. 
<br /><br />Whitby has proved popular with tourists, since the Victorian times. The early Victorians came to Whitby for the ‘invigorating air' and were to be seen in their bathing carriages on the sea shore and taking strolls along the harbour side as can be seen in the early photographs of the area. Whitby became more available to the general public with the advent of the North Eastern Railway, and of course, accommodation was needed to meet the demand. George Hudson (The Railway King) built a sizeable number of outstanding buildings  on the West Cliff and over the years these properties have been converted into  &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wonderfulwhitby.co.uk%2Fhotels.html%26quot%3B%26gt%3BWhitby"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.wonderfulwhitby.co.uk/hotels.html&quot;&gt;Whitby</a> hotels&lt;/a&gt;. For many visitors, the tariffs of these establishments, were out of reach of the weekly wage.
<br /><br />In the intervening years, there has been a significant rise in the number of residents with larger than required houses, renting rooms to the general public. Recognised under the name of ‘bed and breakfast' establishments,or B&amp;Bs, these home owners have given a welcome alternative to the larger hotels.
<br /><br />There has been an growth in demand for &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wonderfulwhitby.co.uk%2Fguesthouses.html%26quot%3B%26gt%3BWhitby"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.wonderfulwhitby.co.uk/guesthouses.html&quot;&gt;Whitby</a> B&amp;B&lt;/a&gt; accommodation. The rates charged by the bed and breakfast establishments are much less than the hotels, as their expenses are obviously less. This is not to say, however, that the standards are any the less. Many of the home-owners have developed and improved upon their properties through the years to bring them in line with smaller establishments in the hotel sector.
<br /><br />Certain quidelines and safety regulations must be in place to offer accommodation to the public. In order to operate, these home-owners must have fire precautions and certificates, public liability insurance and a general knowledge of food hygiene. The bed and breakfast accommodation providers provide an very important service to supplement the number of beds available at peak holiday times in the holiday season. Over the years, a number of the guests may come back frequently to the same bed and breakfast and recommend them to other guests. Many friendships have been forged in this way.
<br /><br />The homes that do open for bed and breakfast are available almost anywhere in the town. They range from the larger detached houses and the much larger semi-detached homes to possibly the smaller sized modern family homes and bungalows. Anywhere, for that matter, that has a spare room or 2 can be classified as a bed and breakfast place, and of course, a willing house owner prepared to welcome  total strangers into their house.

Over the three days the weather was lovely, and the sun shone wonderfully on the Regatta Monday.
<br /><br />Whitby Regatta is one of the oldest regattas in this country, and this year was the 171st time the event has been held.The popular event originated from the racing of local fishermen and their fishing boats, developing over many years, into its modern day format. Whitby Regatta today includes  the amateur rowing teams, but also a variety of activities on the West Cliff and West Cliff beach along with the fair on Whitby West Pier and the amazing firework display which brings the 3 day event to a close.
<br /><br />A team of volunteers, and the Whitby Regatta Committee, work unbelievably hard to organise  the events. Any contributions collected from the public are used for events the following year.
<br /><br />This year large crowds all along the harbour and piers, cheered on the rowing races.  The teams of rowers comprising of girls, boys, ladies and men all of varying ages, are testament to the dedication of the rowing club's organisers' commitment to the youth of Whitby.
<br /><br />For the 3 day event on Whitby's  West Cliff there were numerous attractions ranging from the glamorous grandmothers competition and the beautiful baby contest to a motorbike and quad gymkhana on the beach. Beautiful vintage cars were on display alongside their proud owners on the grassy banks and on the opposite side of the road, tractors, motorbikes and scooters gleamed in the Royal Crescent Gardens, near the &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wonderfulwhitby.co.uk%2Fwonderfulwhitbyblog%2Fwhitby-accommodation-whitby-hotels-whitby-holiday-cottages-whitby-bs%2F%26quot%3B%26gt%3BWhitby"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.wonderfulwhitby.co.uk/wonderfulwhitbyblog/whitby-accommodation-whitby-hotels-whitby-holiday-cottages-whitby-bs/&quot;&gt;Whitby</a> Hotels&lt;/a&gt;.
<br /> As in previous years, the army, navy and airforce ‘roadshows'  were there. However this year, an obstacle course was provided free by the army, much to the delight of the youngsters (and those not so young). A dog show drew a number of entrants and, keeping on the animal theme, there were birds of prey, owls and reptiles on display. A new novelty this year was the pig racing viewed with much amusement by the crowds.
<br /><br />A mountain bike display, a fun-run, the annuual tug-of-war, bouncy castles, dodgems, pick-a-pen, trampolines, sweet stalls a ‘witch', punch and judy, face-painting and many more activities added to the atmosphere on the Whitby's West Cliff over the weekend.
<br /><br />The annual raft race supplied the crowds with much entertainment. The lifeboat led the yachts into the harbour for the sailpast adding to the maritime feel.
<br /><br />On Regatta Monday the parade was led by Miss Regatta. This was followed closely by 16 men pulling the old lifeboat, the William Riley, (no mean feat when considering at one point the parade marched uphill on Khyber Pass). Two jazz bands marched with musical accompaniment, the glamorous granny winner rode in a pony and trap and a charabanc and minature steam train were all in the procession in addition to some original and colourful floats (mechanical and walking). The absolute stars of the parade were undoubtedly the fancy-dress entrants. There were 92 childrenin total,  in the parade in some stunning costumes which had obviously taken a great deal of time in the making. There were some truly original and comical characters displayed and it must have been extremely difficult for the judges to award the prizes.
<br /><br />The team of the Red Arrows thrilled and delighted the crowd on the West Cliff.  Significant crowds waited in anticipation for the arrival of the nine Red Arrow acrobatic team in their traditional red hawk jets.  Although perhaps not the clearest of skies, the visual impact of the jets and their trademark coloured vapour trails held the crown in awe and suspense.  As they performed their acrobatic display there were audible cheers and applause making this one of the most memorable aspects of the regatta for many of the crowd.  Sadly, nearly a week later, one of the Red Arrow's team crashed in Dorset.  Our sympathies are with the family, friends and colleagues of the pilot involved.
<br /><br />The fair on Regatta Monday which extended along Pier Road and to the end of Whitby West Pier was, as usual, a mixture of rides, stalls, thrills and spills.  The crowds were milling around from dawn to dusk enjoying the ‘fun of the fair'.
<br /><br />The conclusion of the three day Whitby Regatta was the explosive firework display on Monday evening on the East Pier.  To the delight of the crowd they were treated to a impressive pyrotechnic event.  This year's display was especially spellbinding and  a fitting finale to the 171st Whitby Regatta, a festival on land, sea and air.

This year, as in the many prior years, there has been an increase in the amount of visitors to this busy bustling seaside holiday resort. The popularity of the weekend break and mid-week break in addition to the traditional summer holiday has seen a guest house population expansion.
<br /><br />As in the rest of the country, there has been an increase in ‘themed' accommodation.This can take the form of Victorian styling, contemporary, Georgian, farmhouse or even Gothic.
<br /><br />Across the river, however, is the main concentration of the &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wonderfulwhitby.co.uk%2Fguesthouses.html%26quot%3B%26gt%3BWhitby"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.wonderfulwhitby.co.uk/guesthouses.html&quot;&gt;Whitby</a> guest House &lt;/a&gt; accommodation. The larger houses on the West Cliff built in the Hudson era at the time of the Whitby to Pickering Railway in 1836 are largely converted into guest houses as the size and layout of the buildings lend themselves to such.The Pannet Park and surrounding area is home to many guest houses having being converted from the former homes of the whaling captains and early business folk.
<br /><br />A &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wonderfulwhitby.co.uk%2Fguesthouses.html%26quot%3B%26gt%3BWhitby"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.wonderfulwhitby.co.uk/guesthouses.html&quot;&gt;Whitby</a> guest House &lt;/a&gt; and other serviced accommodation in Whitby  are subject to rules and regulations required by the local council, the English Tourist Board and the Fire Brigade.To be included on the register at the local tourist office, guest houses must be inspected and verified.  The rules and regulations will include fire precautions, standards of accommodation and services available and a code of conduct.
<br /><br />Advertising these guest houses can be done in a number of ways. There is still the option of the Borough Council Holiday Guide as has been the traditional way for years but there is also the option of newspaper advertising and the internet. This media allows the potential visitor to ‘view' online the bedroom accommodation on offer and also a map showing its situation.
<br /><br />In addition to the main holiday season as the mainstay of the income for guest houses, there has been a steady dripfeed of various events and functions throughout the year to enable the establishments to open all year round instead of the seasonal six months as happened in years gone by.   Some of the latest events on Whitby's Calendar  includes the North Yorkshire Moors Railway which hosts a programme of events which now includes Whitby  station. Whitby Gothic Weekends held in the spring and autumns have gained popularity over the years, so much so, that the town can be ‘full to capacity' at these events.  Wedding Fayres, Film events and conferences have increased in numbers at the Whitby Pavilion and there are the traditional school parties staying mid-week on field trips.
<br /><br />Whitby guest houses continue to offer the discerning visitor value for money despite competition from larger hotels and self-contained holiday cottages and apartments.  The personal factor obviously counts in the choice of many patrons as evidenced in the continuing numbers of houses opening their doors.
<br /><br />Whitby Guest Houses remain a popular choice for holiday makers, despite the current economic climate. Find out more about what to expect from this type of accommodation, and how the standards and quality of such establishments have changed over the years.

Popular since Victorian times for the annual holiday, it has, in recent years, become a destination for the week-end away and short break visitors.  This could be partly due to the increase in accommodation available but also the availability of  a wider range of restaurants operating  throughout the year offering a high standard of cuisine.
<br /><br />This they have certainly achieved with the resulting wide variety of eating places available.  International cuisine is definitely in evidence with the opening of the recent Thai Restaurant to complement the other Asian establishments of Indian and Chinese.  Beautifully decorated in the traditional Asian style, with  a contemporary feel, these restaurants are very easy on the eye.
<br /><br />Continental cuisine is well represented in the form of a number of Italian &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wonderfulwhitby.co.uk%2Frestaurants.html%26quot%3B%26gt%3BWhitby"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.wonderfulwhitby.co.uk/restaurants.html&quot;&gt;Whitby</a> Restaurants &lt;/a&gt; catering to the locals and visitors alike. Unfortunately there are no French or Spanish eating establishments but hopefully it will not be too long before they make an appearance.
<br /><br />The traditional English restaurants are well established  in Whitby and plentiful in number.  They are ever popular with the local population  and returning visitors resulting in healthy  trading all year round.  At this time of the year they are advertising their establishments in the local press to promote their extensive Christmas Party Menus and their Christmas Day lunches.  It is perhaps a sign of the times that more and more families are opting to have their Christmas day meals at a restaurant in preference to self-catering.  Obviously, of course, those on vacation will need the provision of meals at this festive time, but for the many full-time working mothers, it can be a real luxury for them. 
<br /><br />Whitby, traditionally known for its association with the fishing industry, has a number of Seafood Restaurants, who, in the past, were able to source their ingredients directly from the local catch by way of the local fish market.   Unfortunately, the decline of the fishing industry in recent years due to the current economic climate has resulted in the majority of fish and shell fish being landed elsewhere and transported into the town to the local seafood restaurants.  This has not detracted, however, from the freshness and quality of the fish and seafood available as evidenced in the ongoing popularity of such seafood restaurants.
<br /><br />It can be said that there is little evidence of a fast food &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wonderfulwhitby.co.uk%2Fwheretoeat.html%26quot%3B%26gt%3BPlaces"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.wonderfulwhitby.co.uk/wheretoeat.html&quot;&gt;Places</a> to Eat in Whitby&lt;/a&gt; as yet in the town but who knows when this will change.   It can be said that with the variety of all the other restaurants available, they are not particularly missed!
<br /><br />Whitby can boast some well-known restaurants which have featured in the media over the last few years.  The new wave of reality television cookery programmes has seen a number of celebrity chefs visiting various restaurants in the town for either promotional or entertainment purposes. Whatever the reason, this high visibility has only improved the number of tourists and visitors to this town as it has brought to the attention this picturesque town and all it has to offer, in particular the variety and standard of the local restaurants.  This extra trade is very beneficial to the local economy  ensuring that the hoteliers and restaurant owners have a year round trading season.

This ancient seaside town renowned for its seafaring traditions and unique character is rising steadily in popularity over recent years.
<br /><br />This rise in tourism has somewhat shifted the pattern of the local shops to cater more and more with the increasing volume of vacationers.  Although, as one would certainly expect there are the ‘touristy' shops, you will find an ever increasing variety of the more upmarket establishments which in turn means that Whitby can offer almost anything to everybody.
<br /><br />The East side of Whitby has the reputation of being the ‘older' side of town due to its historical connections, and it has, overall, more &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wonderfulwhitby.co.uk%2Fwheretoshop.html%26quot%3B%26gt%3BShops"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.wonderfulwhitby.co.uk/wheretoshop.html&quot;&gt;Shops</a> in Whitby&lt;/a&gt; dedicated to the sale of Whitby memorabilia, in particular, Whitby Jet.  This world renowned commodity is collected and carved in the local region which makes it  one of the oldest industries in Whitby.  All styles of Whitby jet and Whitby jet jewellery are on sale here as well as many other precious stones.  There are the traditional jewellers on this side, together with a number of shops selling costume and ‘fun' jewellery.  As one would be expecting, there are a number of outlets dedicated to tourism, selling postcards, ornaments, bric a brac etc.  A wide variety of clothing retailers give the opportunity to purchase the more traditional ladies clothing, gothic and punk outfits, designer label, outdoor pursuits and trendy young fashions.
<br /><br />There are a selection of cafes and restaurants, alongside the other retail establishments including book shops, a post office, gift shops selling a multitude of novelties and sculptures and some with a fascinating range of fossils, quartz and other semi-precious stones. There is a  fishing tackle shop, a craft shop and model shop to appeal to people that have various hobbies.  Wholefood and health food shops alongside sweet and rock shops make for an evenly balanced diet!!  Toy shops are a particular draw for the kids as too are the ice-cream retailers.  There are, of course the more ordinary day to day shop types geared  more for the local population but all make for a wide base for shopping for locals and visitors.
<br /><br />Whitby's West Side shops cater also for the vacation population with an intrinsic selection of gift shops and memorabilia, however these are interspersed with the necessities  of town life including banks and building societies.   Clothing shops and shoe shops abound on the main two parallel streets of Flowergate and Baxtergate also giving a range of apparel aimed at the young and not so young.   Towards the top end of Flowergate is Skinner Street, a busy street with cafes, restaurants, a chemist, health food and book shop.  Along here, in addition to the other streets are the charity shops, which it can be said, cater to the holiday population as visitors like to browse and ‘bag a bargain'.  It is on this side of the river that the major food shopping is located, greengrocers and butchers and not forgetting, the delicious freshly cooked cakes and pies filling the air with mouth watering aromas. A large supermarket with easy access car parking for the larger food shopping is located near the Railway Station and a few stores through which to browse which seem to sell most things in the non-food line are more or less on the other side of the main road.
<br /><br />There are in all probability far too many &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wonderfulwhitby.co.uk%2Fwheretoshop.html%26quot%3B%26gt%3BShops"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.wonderfulwhitby.co.uk/wheretoshop.html&quot;&gt;Shops</a> in Whitby&lt;/a&gt; to list individually but it is safe to say that there are probably enough shopping outlets available to cater for most people's needs and most certainly those of the holidaymaker and visitor.

Although tourism has played a major role in the economy of the town since the Victorian era, it has only recently become favourable for the short breaks and the occasional weekend away in addition to the annual weekly holiday.

Sadly, the decline in the economic viability of such an industry has meant the closure of the local fish market (hopefully to reopen at some point) with the result that much  of the fish and shellfish has to be purchased from other nearby ports. There is little difference in the quality of freshness, however, the local restaurants are as excellent as ever.

Maybe because of the town's size and location, the larger fast food chains do not consider it a viable option.
<br /><br />There are some very well-known restaurants which have featured in the media over the past few years.  Celebrity chefs from the new wave of reality television cookery programmes have visited various restaurants for promotion purposes advertising, perhaps, a particular food festival or indeed to showcase their culinary skills.  Whatever the reason, this high visibility has only improved the number of tourists and visitors to this town as it has brought to the attention this picturesque town and all it has to offer, in particular the variety and standard of the local restaurants.  This extra trade is very beneficial to the local economy  ensuring that the hoteliers and restaurant owners have a year round trading season.

In successive years more and more visitors are making the choice of Whitby, a lively fishing town at the mouth of the River Esk in the county of North Yorkshire.
<br /><br />This picturesque town famous for its whaling history and its association with Captain James Cook, has been the on the television screens over the last few years  in Heartbeat, various cookery programmes, numerous plays and music videos.  This television coverage has made the attractions of Whitby and the surrounding area available to a wider population of the public and this in turn has led to the introduction of more catering and hospitality establishments aimed at this growing sector.
<br /><br />Numerous ways of sourcing the types of accommodation that are available include the internet, newspaper advertising and the English Tourist Board.
<br /><br />Choices available range from the larger hotels, the smaller family run hotels, guest houses, self-contained cottages, flats and apartments, campsites and lastly but nevertheless outstanding value, are the Whitby B&amp;B  establishments.  
<br /><br />The majority of the &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wonderfulwhitby.co.uk%2Fguesthouses.html%26quot%3B%26gt%3BWhitby"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.wonderfulwhitby.co.uk/guesthouses.html&quot;&gt;Whitby</a> B&amp;B&lt;/a&gt; style accommodation providers welcome guests into their own homes with personal attention not afforded by the larger accommodation providers.   This being so, the number of bedrooms available will probably have shared bathrooms and not many en-suite.   Dining-rooms are less formal and some tables will be shared as will the lounge area.  This style of accommodation allows the interaction between both owners and visitors to be friendly  and in a relaxed  and homely atmosphere.Over the years as many of the visitors return they forge good friendships with the owners and indeed with other visitors.  
<br /><br />The English Tourist Board and the Scarborough Borough Council has rules that apply to accommodation taking in more than 6 guests at a time, but the bed and breakfast style of accommodation quite often does not fall into that category. The Whitby B&amp;B accommodation category can let rooms in their own homes without being involved with either the council or the ETB.  
<br /><br />In the current economic climate with uncertainty as to employment and income, more house owners are willing to open their doors to the members of the public with regard to offering accommodation to supplement their living expenses.  In offering such accommodation, they can keep their prices to a minimum as they will not have the overheads that the larger establishments incur.    This being so they are an attractive alternative to potential visitors who have a certain budget for any holidays they may take.
<br /><br />Transport has become more readily accessible and this in turn has led to an increase in the numbers of tourists visiting this delightful town. There are rail links with Middlesbrough and York which in turn connects with the rest of the country.  Nearest Airports are Newcastle, Durham Tees Valley and Leeds Bradford.  The road links have dramatically improved with the A169 leading to the A64, and the A171 in both directions either towards Middlesbrough or Scarborough.  Coastliner Buses travel from Leeds and the Arriva buses travel from the north.  
<br /><br />There is no doubt that the bed and breakfast accommodation providers in Whitby can offer a relaxing and homely style accommodation with the added benefits of lower prices.    This has the added benefit that there is a monetary threshold to be reached before any taxes are to be paid to the Inland Revenue once expenses have been deducted resulting in lower prices.    Another reason why the &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wonderfulwhitby.co.uk%2Fguesthouses.html%26quot%3B%26gt%3BWhitby"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.wonderfulwhitby.co.uk/guesthouses.html&quot;&gt;Whitby</a> B&amp;B&lt;/a&gt; is a win win situation for the home owners and the holidaymakers alike.

Popular since Victorian times for the annual holiday, it has, in recent years, become a destination for the week-end away and short break visitors.  This could be partly due to the increase in accommodation available but also the availability of  a wider range of restaurants operating  throughout the year offering a high standard of cuisine.
<br /><br />International cuisine has made a further appearance with the recent opening of the Thai restaurant  to complement the already existing Chinese and Indian restaurants.   The latest additions to the Asian restaurants are decorated in the contemporary style increasing popular with the younger generation. 
<br /><br />Continental cuisine is well represented in the form of a number of Italian &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wonderfulwhitby.co.uk%2Frestaurants.html%26quot%3B%26gt%3BWhitby"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.wonderfulwhitby.co.uk/restaurants.html&quot;&gt;Whitby</a> Restaurants &lt;/a&gt; catering to the locals and visitors alike. Unfortunately there are no French or Spanish eating establishments but hopefully it will not be too long before they make an appearance.
<br /><br />The traditional English restaurants are well established  in Whitby and plentiful in number.  Ever popular with the local population and well known to the regular visitor, they enjoy a good reputation and year round clientele.   At the present time they are busy advertising their establishments for the Festive season, i.e. Xmas parties and the Xmas Day lunch menu in the local press.  It is perhaps a sign of the times that more and more families are opting to have their Christmas day meals at a restaurant in preference to self-catering.   Not only are the local people booking for their Xmas fayre but also the visitors on vacation need to be able to dine on Christmas Day.
<br /><br />Whitby, traditionally known for its association with the fishing industry, has a number of Seafood Restaurants, who, in the past, were able to source their ingredients directly from the local catch by way of the local fish market.

Maybe because of the town's size and location, the larger fast food chains do not consider it a viable option.
<br /><br />Whitby can boast some well-known restaurants which have featured in the media over the last few years.  Celebrity chefs from the new wave of reality television cookery programmes have visited various restaurants for promotion purposes advertising, perhaps, a particular food festival or indeed to showcase their culinary skills.   Whatever the event, this has not only showcased the event but also drawn attention to the wider public the scope of restaurants available and also the charm of the picturesque town of Whitby, giving viewers a snapshot of the area and perhaps encouraging them to visit.

In fact, it has a little something to offer everyone.   Walkers and hikers are ideally placed for coastal walks and national trails.  Historians can embrace the museums and Whitby Abbey in addition to local history in connection with the railways and maritime connections.   Sandy beaches, amusements and sporting activities can suit families of all ages.  In fact, all ages can be catered for in this popular holiday destination.  Easy access is afforded along the harbour on the West  side for the less mobile and the wheelchair user.   The East side has cobbled streets but is mainly on the flat, slightly more strenuous for wheelchair users, but nevertheless, achievable. 
<br /><br />The dietry needs for the visitors are well cared for by the abundance of cafes and &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wonderfulwhitby.co.uk%2Frestaurants.html%26quot%3B%26gt%3BWhitby"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.wonderfulwhitby.co.uk/restaurants.html&quot;&gt;Whitby</a> Restaurants&lt;/a&gt; with a price range to suit most pockets.  Transport is easily available via the bus and railway stations with links from most major towns in the area.  
<br /><br />The most important decision, however, to be made by the potential visitor is that of accommodation.  Whether the potential visitor wishes to stay for a short break, a weekend away or an annual holiday, the accommodation choice is paramount  in respect of standards required and the actual costs involved. 
<br /><br />With a plethora of differing types of accommodation on offer, Whitby can offer the tourist a tremendous choice.  From the grand hotels to the modest camping sites, there is something to suit every budget.  One choice, however, can be said to offer real ‘value for money' and that is the &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wonderfulwhitby.co.uk%2Fguesthouses.html%26quot%3B%26gt%3BWhitby"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.wonderfulwhitby.co.uk/guesthouses.html&quot;&gt;Whitby</a> Guest House&lt;/a&gt;.
<br /><br />Offering a personal touch, the Whitby Guest House owner can offer its customers bed and breakfast in a comfortable homely atmosphere.  This is quite often because it is, in fact, their own family home and as such they take pride in their accommodation.  In addition to this, the Guest Houses are listed on a register with the local tourist board and in doing so, agree to certain standards of accommodation and safety checks. 
<br /><br />Each of the guest houses are individual and, therefore, have no requirement to be decorated within the guidelines of some of the larger hotel chains.  On offer can be the quaint guest house with chintz curtains, ornamental decoration and a quintessentially homely feel.  Another could possibly be contemporary with minimalist furnishings and an altogether modern approach.  There is, for instance, a guest with an altogether completely different theme, that of a gothic vampire era, complete with gothic furniture and furnishings!    Some of the guest houses are embracing a ‘green' culture with energy saving as its selling point.    
<br /><br />The facilities on offer by the majority of the guest houses in this present day are as to be expected in comparison with the rest of the country.  Although some of the guest houses could have been operating for over a century, this by no means limit's the standards applied.  Many of the properties can offer en-suite facilities in addition to a shared bathroom.  In fact, in recent years, there has been a shift to en-suite accommodation away from the traditional guest house with a number of bedrooms sharing a bathroom. 
<br /><br />The new up and coming guest houses alongside the older well established businesses ensure that it is relatively easy to make a perfect choice for that all important break away.  There does seem to be a high proportion of return visitors which seems to denote a certain confidence within this accommodation sector.

Although many are occupied by local residents, there are a number for rental as holiday accommodation.  This very old cobbled street has quite an interesting history.  Named after Henrietta Cholmley, it was formerly home to nearly a thousand inhabitants but in 1787 a large landslip saw a great many houses fall into the sea and a succession of further landslips has now seen the number of cottages decreased to present day numbers.   The cottages on the sea ward side do have access down to the sands of Tate Hill Beach from where it is possible to look upwards towards the graveyard of St. Mary's Church and see the cottages nestling at the foot of the cliffs with the seagulls swooping etc.  Nowadays though, the smoke has largely been replaced by smokeless fuels or gas or electricity.
<br /><br />Although there are beautiful and quaint cottages on Henrietta Street, they are not by any means the only holiday cottages for rental in Whitby. The cobbled streets and flagstones of Church Street are also home to a large number of holiday cottages in the same quaint design.  Leading from St. Mary's Churchyard to Church Street are the famous 199 steps and it is from here southwards that there are a number of narrow alleys and yards.  In these alleys and yards are situated many unusual cottages used for holiday homes.  It was along these streets and alleyways that the local male population would evade the press gangs and custom men of the 1790's.  Today, however, a more peaceful atmosphere prevails.
<br /><br />As Church Street winds its way along to the bottom of Green Lane there can be found numerous holiday cottages.  In fact, the streets behind here leading uphill contain many cottages, the majority are homes to the local population but, of course, there are some for rental too.These cottages on the higher level have wonderful views of the harbour  and the local fishing boats.
<br /><br />The West side of &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wonderfulwhitby.co.uk%26quot%3B%26gt%3BWhitby"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.wonderfulwhitby.co.uk&quot;&gt;Whitby</a> UK&lt;/a&gt;  around the Swing Bridge area also has the small alleyways with ‘fishermens' cottages converted into holiday accommodation.    By observation of their situation it is possible to obtain an insight into the close community spirit that existed in the previous centuries. These cosy cottages are close to all amenities including the bus and railway station, the local shops and the beaches.
<br /><br />The term Whitby Cottages does not necessarily mean that they are, in fact, cottages.  The name covers a huge selection of varying types of buildings when viewed in the context of a holiday rental. Those included may be bungalows, houses, flats or apartments.   Sizes range from the small  buildings accommodating couples up to the larger establishments which can accommodate fifteen or sixteen individuals.  There are many such buildings all around the town on both the West and the East side.  
<br /><br />Many of the holiday cottages are let privately by the owners but increasingly they are let by the professionsal Holiday Lettings Agencies.  Each one of the letting agency cottages are inspected and graded by the English Tourist Board or their representative ensuring that establishments are kept in good condition  and of a standard expected by the paying  visitor.

		<document id="5debf4b788541888eedfd66dbbabcdc9" url=""><![CDATA[All About Health Clubs And Gyms<br/><br/>The title may sound like a silly query, but a little bit more thought begins to provoke all sorts of queries in your mind concerning the possibilities regarding the running of a health club facility. In fact, operating a health club is a whole lot more complicated than people first conceive, even so with some easy fundamentals explained, it is simple to understand the health club style. 
<br />If you are having a hard time deciding on a healh club to join its a good idea to create a &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.health-club-directory.org%2F%26quot%3B%26gt%3BHealth"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.health-club-directory.org/&quot;&gt;Health</a> Club Directory&lt;/a&gt;
<br /><br />Getting Started With A Plan
<br /><br />The very first thing  to keep in mind, is no matter what happens at one, a health club is still a company. So that you can be a prosperous business you have to have a business plan. The business plan for a health club consists of lots of  aspects  that outline how the business will function, however mainly outlines the fact that a health club provides a service to its customers, of which they buy the service on a month-to-month foundation. These month-to-month payments can then be used to make projections about the financial future of the health club enterprise.
<br /><br />Going Alone Or Part of a Franchise?
<br /><br />Once you have a good business plan in place the next step is to think about whether going to be part of a franchise or independent facility. It truly is essential to differentiate between a chain path or franchise for the health club business as early as possible, as the future of the business, and its scale, are going to be influenced by such an enormous decision.
<br /><br />A franchise is helpful for a start-up health club business that desires to grow its brand as quickly as possible, using the least expensive capital investment necessary. The investment occurs from franchisees, who wish to buy-in to the business, and they'll also bear the health club's branding and adopt its business plan.
<br /><br />A health club chain is a likely approach for companies or large groups of investors wanting to begin a health club business.  They're the sole owners of the health club and reap all of the profits whilst putting of all of the investments needed.
<br /><br />Marketing And Advertising
<br /><br />Your initial marketing campaign will be to be quite expensive so you want to make sure you've got the funds needed to kick it off. Promotions are run to entice brand new members to come and join the club, with the chance of lower membership fees so that you can undercut your competitors and as a result start interest in the fitness and health club being put together.
<br /><br />A trend for zany and imaginative advertising campaigns have been seen in the last few years, as the supply of health club facilities grows, and so does competition.
<br /><br />What Services Really should Be On Offer
<br /><br />The services that health clubs offer should be hospitable in their very nature. Customer service has to be the goal of any enterprise that deals directly with folks. This includes health clubs, and particularly start-up health clubs who need to keep their brand intact so as to keep continued clients.
<br /><br />Regular services include: a gymnasium facility with cardio, circuit training and free weights areas; a spa area with rooms that offer treatment or specialized facilities, i.e. massage therapy and sauna rooms; instructional classes in a variety of different topics and skills; a personal training team that is committed to offering in-house support to the health club's subscribers; a nutrition area .
<br /><br />The huge amount of services provided inside the facility demands a big number of staff members, from the customer services, to a nutrition center if relevant, and to all the personal training staff members who have to provide health and fitness planning services to all of the members. Among your biggest expenses is going to be personnel costs.
<br /><br />Finding A Area
<br /><br />Acquiring and/or building premises for a gym can be among the largest outlays for a health club business, even so franchisees will normally obtain financial support on their investment. This has to be taken into account along with the operating expense and the pay for the employees.
<br /><br />The monthly payment for membership charges is what is going to cover costs. Smart financial organizing is frequently easier with a health club because of its memberships.
<br /><br />Keeping The Clients
<br /><br />Health Clubs and Fitness centers face the continuing issue of maintaining clients. If a client isn't happy you'll find lots of other health club facilities ready to offer them a great deal. Outstanding customer service is a requirement for health club business.

<br /><br />Obviously there are many wonderful places to stay across the world and a tremendous choice of places in our own country.  One area not to be ignored is that of the North East Coast.   The general public has, for many years, thought that the places to go for holidays in this country has been in the south by way of Cornwall and Devon or alternatively Bournemouth or Bognor. Increasingly there has been an awareness of a beautiful picturesque town on the north eastern coastline, in the County of North Yorkshire.  That town is, of course, the wonderful town of Whitby.
<br /><br />The town has been increasing its tourism traffic rapidly over the last thirty or forty years or so.     Simultaneously, there has been a rapid expansion in the hotel sector.  &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wonderfulwhitby.co.uk%2Fhotels.html%26quot%3B%26gt%3BWhitby"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.wonderfulwhitby.co.uk/hotels.html&quot;&gt;Whitby</a> Hotels&lt;/a&gt; are able to compete with hotels around this country proportionate in size.   The grading system and the standards set by the English Tourist Board have been more than adequately met by the proprietors of the local hotels.
<br /><br />At this particular time of year, the hotel owners have an opportunity to redecorate and upgrade their premises for the forthcoming season.  The early months of the year tend to be fairly quiet with regard to the number of guests, but this does enable the updating.
<br /><br />It may be that the numbers of visitors are lower than the summer, but &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wonderfulwhitby.co.uk%26quot%3B%26gt%3BWhitby"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.wonderfulwhitby.co.uk&quot;&gt;Whitby</a> UK&lt;/a&gt; is by no means deserted.  The town of Whitby UK has many things to offer the visitor all year round. The stunning scenery viewed from the clifftops or by the ancient Whitby abbey is breathtaking.  Links with Captain James Cook and Sir William Scoresby are part of the town's maritime history.  A more fictional link is that of Count Dracular whose creator Bram Stoker was a frequent visitor to the town, drawing his inspiration for the novel from Whitby abbey and the one hundred and ninety-nine steps. Another frequent visitor to the town was Lewis Carroll who penned his creation Alice in Wonderland from ideas from around the area.
<br /><br />Increaasingly, more and more visitors are taking their leisure breaks throughout the year instead of only in the summer season.The majority of hotels in Whitby are opening all year round to cater to this shift in the changing pattern of  visitors.  So, back to the weather, it may be snowing and freezing cold but surely that is a good time to look in the holiday brochure or indeed, browse the internet, to find accommodation in Whitby for a potential stay.  With an enormous selection of hotels to choose from there is a choice to suit almost all.  A really good, comfortable Whitby Hotel combined with Whitby town and surrounding area is a wonderful combination.
