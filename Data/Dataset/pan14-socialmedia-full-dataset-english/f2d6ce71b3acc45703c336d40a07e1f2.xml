Poem &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; is his masterpiece involving all his efforts and dedication. The whole work is divided into three parts: &quot;Paradise&quot; and &quot;Hell&quot; and &quot;Purgatory.&quot;
<br /><br />On April 7, 1300, 35 years old Dante Ali and Eli occasionally became lost in the &quot;dark forests&quot; at the Easter of that year and they finally fled the forests and started to climb the mountain in front of him. When the panther and bitch are going to bite them, Beatrice, who receive the order of Virgin Mary from the heaven called Roman poet Virgil’s sole to save Dante. Virgil who can not reach the spot said to Dante, If you want to return to the real world, you must go through hell, heaven and the crime circles. Then both of these poets began to travel the three states.
<br /><br />Throughout the whole work, albeit take the rescue of dead as a clue, the theme should be human salvation in the real world. On the one hand, his satire and castigate the evils of society. He has realized that why the chaotic political situation of the German political in Florence. Due to King with the Pope's intervention have caused to the political darkness. For this reason, he put those heated by all the people such as political opportunists, flatterers, venal politicians, troublemakers, leaf blowers, and the betrayals were put into the Hell parts. Besides exposing the dark sides of society, he also tried to guide a bright way for human beings with a happiness ending. He had developed the Christianity doctrine. It is not merely to spread the personal salvation sentiment of Christian because it strongly hoped to his sins on earth to be forgiven through God's grace in order to avoid the pain in hell. Non-human factors are contained in it.
<br /><br />Dante’s The Divine Comedy was full of brightness of humanism. The god took the form of supreme origin of love which showed righteousness and virtue, But he is not omniscient, it is not blind obedience to him, but rather should strive to pursue their own happiness and ideals. At the same time, Dante also denied the church as an individual intermediary to save persons, and he mercilessly reveals the corruption and hypocrisy of the Church. But the constancy and struggle of the hell ghost and the noble and climbing of the purgatory ghost, as well as the sanctity and calmly of heaven gods all let the people moved. Through the hell and purgatory, which means human beings have recognized that their mistakes and sins, then have waken up and turned over, thus have accessed to the new process. No one can die twice and the experience of death is able to make people’s understanding about the meaning of life become deeper. Dante's chose to face the finite nature of human life and lead the people to go through hell so they can better understand the true meaning of life and the value of human existence. As Melezh Kefusiji had said, &quot;Dante provoked the dead and want to know, what he, as a person, and all mankind should do?.&quot;

Then how can we define pure-blood dogs? Most people have only a little knowledge about it. People always think good dogs should be graceful, rare, and expensive so there are great number of people easily taken advantage by dog dealers with their making up species.Several Pros and False Ideas of <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5pYmxpbmcuanAvc2lsdmVyLXJpbmdz" target="_blank">???????</a> 
<br /><br />However, the sader is that lot of them have a tendency to catch up with fashion without getting to know the dog's charactor and habit. Inspired <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5pYmxpbmcuanAvYnJvb2NoZXM_" target="_blank">????</a> Adornment This turns out to be a tragedy of throwing the dog out. As for pure breed, we first make a distinction between mixed-breed dog and crossbred dog.
<br /><br />The former is generated by two different breeds of dogs or a pedigree dog with a dog of another breed. The latter origin is random, it is impossible to accurately classify species which is mated by two unknown dogs. The colors of hybrid dogs are mainly grey or light yellow and generally they have a middle-sized body. They are also independent naturally which can be the best choice of hounds because their hairs are rather confusing.
<br /><br />Benefit from a variety of blood background, crossbred dogs get the most optimal genetic, good genes much higher than the inferior genes, and often are hidden. The bad effect of hereditary diversity is unsure to pass on the superior genes to the next generation. Moreover, even if the crossbred dogs dad and mom of mating have good characteristics, but also it is more difficult to predict the morphological and physiological characteristics of future generations.
<br /><br />Although it is generally considered the crossbred dogs are sensitive and intelligent, strong and brave, the fact is that the opinion do not apply to all crossbred dog. Only the lucky and superior offspring can survive in society. Besides, many countries with a well-developed Kennel Industry have their own standards on the certification of dog breeds.

<br /><br />And then in the case, many conflicts will be produced, because the women think the man do not regard them, and they are very angry. According to Women's Health magazine recently reported that such a response of men is not to say that they do not care, but because their process of dealing information different from women. Therefore, women should learn the following skills, use male language and presentation to speak. Communicate side by side. If you want to talk with her husband about more thorny issues, such as criticizing his overzealous playing and regardless of their families, you must not talk with him in the face to face way. Scott Guzman, a professor of marriage at Brown University who has been engaged in this matter for a long time, pointed out that direct eye contact in this kind of sharp, continuous conversation will make men fear.
<br /><br />Moreover, when it is face to face, men will instinctively come into &quot;survival mode &quot;---&quot; either fight or flee.&quot; So if you want to talk with him, the best position is side by side when you are walking, driving or watching TV in the couch together. Come to the point. A newest study showes that male brain looks man’s voice as “speech”, looks woman’s voice as “music”. That’s why men treat men’s voice much more seriously. So in order to guarantee your husband can take every word you have spoken, you should express yourself in a brief, clear, loud and prompt manner. Professor Hauzman points out that the men most want to hear the core straightly, it is best to speak straightly to the theme for women.
<br /><br />Let him know that you want give vent to your anger. Men are born &quot;problem solver&quot;. Frowns imply that they are thinking about how to solve a certain problem. When wife tells her husband some plight, he would initiatively think he should help her find a solution, but not listen simply. Therefore, women should let men know clearly what you really want before the talk. The best prologue is the one that &quot;I really need say these boring things in my hearts and you just comfort me.&quot; To meet his self-esteem. Is it that every time you put your request, he will go in at one ear and out at the other? Then you'd better curry favor with him.

How do you solve these problems? At present, many owners are usually not attach importance to the basic maintain of vehicle, and send to the repair shop or 4s shop for maintenance when the problems get out , which is lead to the increase cost of keeping a car while the owner is also consumed a lot of time and effort on it. Actually, car owers can avoid many problems through daily maintenance. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5pYmxpbmcuanAvc2lsdmVyLWNoYXJtcw__" target="_blank">?????????</a> , Most Pleasant Attachments for Fairy
<br /><br />The engine misfire when the car starts. The Trendiest for Sale, Find the One for You! Reason: engine start is completed by the spark plug ignition which promoted by electric current in battery, the engine may have the following two reasons for why misfire. First, it may be caused by the rust or the leak of battery. Second, the reason may be the wet sprak plug of the engine in rainny days. Maintenance means: you should examine that the battery fluid is sufficient every two months and when the liquid level is between the upper and lower indicator you think the battery fluid is sufficient. Meanwhile, check on the eletrolytic cell's height. If liquid level is low, take the lid off and pour enough distilled water. After that check on the terminal block of the storage battery and use iron bush to sweep the dirt. If the terminal block is badly damaged, use sandpaper to rub along the inside part. If the spark plug is damped it can be out and baked with a lighter, so that the water is as soon as possible evaporated on it.
<br /><br />The reason that the noise and waster gas of the car are exceeded can be due to that engine exhaust gas arrive at high temperature by the high temperature oxidation and lead to the exhaust system leakage. Maintenance means: you should check whether the exhaust system piping and interfaces (in particular, muffler, etc.) are rot by the waste gas and the interface pad has not been washed out. If you find the exhaust system is leak you should repair or replace the parts to the 4s shop. Annual inspections can not only ensure the exhaust system normally work, but also more importantly reduce the emission of the off-gas harmful substances in the environment pollution.Oil consumption inreases suddenly. There are many reasons. But the most common and easiest one is that car owners forget to check to the tyre pressure. Maintenance: When you drive a car, pay more attention to check if all the tires have gas, and check the tire pressure regularly . Do not forget the check to spare tire ,so as to aviod find a spare tire have no gas when you need to replace tires. The tires will be higher than usual when air temperature is high, so the measure of tires is more accurate in cold weather or in the shade. You should interchange the tires place to avoid too much difference of the before and after tires abrasion after your car drivewww.000 km per. When you need to change the badly worn tyres, you had better change two or four at the same time. In addition, tyres with tread pattern can save the oil consumption.
<br /><br />The Engine performance has obviously decreased with the fuel consumption increased. Cause: this is probably due to a long time not change the oil, oil filter, air filter and fuel filter. So this may cause the fuel inadequate burn and the engine increases carbon deposition. Maintenance means: oil and oil filters can be replaced once about 5,000 km, the air filter and fuel filter can be replaced once every 10,000 km, or air, fuel and oil impurities will cause the parts fray and the oil line is stopped up, thus affecting the normal operation of the engine. Auto pump damage. Reason: the pump damage may be caused by irrational behavior when refueling. If you drive in downtown and it is convenient to fill gas, youo should not fill up at once, since it is likely to have problems like oil is float ing and senor loses the control, gas gauge does not work in proper way and oil consumption increases. Here is a suggestion that fill the oil when the oil is almost used up.
<br /><br />Battery is unstable.Reason: Abnormal Changes in the electrolyte will affect the battery performance and reliability. Maintenance method: when you drive in summer, the storage battery is alway over charging. The electrolytic solution of the vaporizes fast and pole plate is easily damaged. Therefore, distilled water should be poured into the storage battery very often. In winter, completely dischange the battery pack and notice that if the electrolytic solution is frozen. Wipers do not work well. If the wipers are damaged, they will not function well. Meanwhile, check on the eletrolytic cell's height. If liquid level is low, take the lid off and pour enough distilled water. Maintenance means: first of all owners need to correct the bad habits by dry scraping. It is best to spray some water first and use the wiper scraper, so that it is benefit to protect the wiper.&gt; Second, the wiper sometimes gives off a gurgling sound, at this time if the wiper blade is complete, then the owners had better to correct wiper angle in the 4s shops.

Famous <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5pYmxpbmcuanAvc3dhcm92c2tpY3J5c3RhbC1icmFjZWxldHM_" target="_blank">?????????????</a> On Fire Melinda apprised some women walking by, checking whether they wear shoes. The result is depressing: they were all bare-footed. Melinda’ boyfriend Bill Gates who came with her couldn’t believe his eyes. At that time, he who at the age of thirty-eight had already own a billion dollar never thought that there were someone who had no shoes on the earth. However, Gates's compassion was only slightly aroused, yet he didn't put it into action. His profligate character still didn't change much. Gates at that time was still very stingy.
<br /><br />The year of 1994 was his delightful and sadness year. On this New Year's Day, he married with Melinda. In the same year, his mother, he loved deeply, was die for cancer unhappily. The huge change gave Gates a big shock both on his feeling and spirit. The worldwide richest man began to consider the meaning and direction of life. This year, he took out 94 million dollar to build William H. Gates Foundation which is the former The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation the under his father’s proposal. However, the American public only noted in 1995 Gates's wealth had already risen to 12.9 billion dollars, yet his almsdeeds were rarely mentioned.
<br /><br />The real turning point appeared in 1997. September this year, the USA defaulted in the membership bill for the UN up to billions of dollars, made the impoverished UN on the brink of bankruptcy. The founder of CNN Ted Turnner had prounced surprisingly that he would donate one billion for United Nation for the financial crisis and some other developing aiding projects. American presses had reported on the charity behavior on the obvious place. Turnner was described as the leader in the charitable men in new generation of America. Some newspapers even listed the personal wealth of the major U.S. magnates and the amounts of their donations, and went on to accuse Gates as the world's richest man could be so stingy.
<br /><br />Under the media rendering, more and more people asked Gates to donate money and contribute to the community, they then grew into a powerful social stress. But to Gates, everyone has his own way to contribute to the community, Microsoft creates tens of thousands of jobs, promote the prosperity of high-tech industry, led the U.S. economy active, is not it a contribution to the society? In 1998, when Gates was confronting with Microsoft lawsuit and suffered great pain, the New York Times posted that 90% disease happen in poor countries but only 10% health care resources are divided to people in these countries. This passage recalled the Gates couple’s experience of traveling in African in 1993. Since then, Bill Gates’ funding organization’s key point turned to the area of healthcare.
<br /><br />Gates' charity moves climbed just like his wealth. He planed to donate more than 100 billion dollars which he owned according to his calculations at that time, leaving each of his children only 10 million U.S. dollars, the contributions were mainly to be used for helping those patients who were affected by AIDS and malaria. The foundation of Bill and Melinda started working in the basement of the old home of Gates. It moved into a two floor house in Seattle later. The foundation had 216 workers, including children health consultants, public health management experts, lawyers and finance staffs. It is said that Gates will have 10 hours to handle the things of foundation in every week. Gates once said to his employees in public that in recent years, he gained largest fulfillment from engaging in the cause of improving the world’s equality. He thought that extremely significant.

Consequently a fight between him and the fish begins and lasts for three days and nights. It doesn’t end until the exhausted fish floats to the surface of the sea and is killed by the fisherman. While Santiago is heading for home, he is continually attacked by a pack of sharks. When he finally reaches the beach, only the head, the tail and the skeleton of the fish is left. This is a far-reaching implication of the classical tragic novels, also is a heroic symphony. hemingway said:&quot; i try to describe a real old man, a real child, a real sea, a real fish and some real shark.How to Accessorise <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5pYmxpbmcuanAvcGVhcmwtZWFycmluZ3M_" target="_blank">????????</a> 
<br /><br />However, if I can write realistic enough, they can represent lots of other things. Inspired <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5pYmxpbmcuanAvc3dhcm92c2tpY3J5c3RhbC1lYXJyaW5ncw__" target="_blank">????????????</a> , the Pieces that Makes all Women Crazy!&quot; the story describes a old man santiago is a wretched man, he does not catch a fish for 84 days, other fishman regard him is a looser. But it seemed to imply the advent of a real battle. Indeed, on the 85th day, he found a big 1,500-pound salmon. Although he knew the fish was more powerful than him, he decided to fight to the end. He says, &quot;I will fight with you in the end!&quot;, finally he wins. but the test is not finish though he catchs the fish not easy. Because the fish is big and long, he gets the fish tie in one side of the ship. On the return to the port, smell of blood of the big fish drew the attack of the sharks one after another. Then, he used all means he could use to fight back. The gig was brought away by the shark, and he tried to tie small knives to stab the sharks.
<br /><br />The knife broken, he uses truncheons, batons missing, he fights with the external rudder. Although the fish meat is bitten, but nothing can destory his will. God seems to take pity such a great old, giving doom to old, at last his great will does not receive good result, in his returning, he brings back only with the fish head, tail and spine. Why does not Hemingway arrange the old man to have a complete triumph which can better demonstrate the greatness of a hero? The truth is that the story about this old man is a symbolization of the relation between nature and humankind and also an embodiment of man’s indestructible spirit. In reality, although he failed, but in spirit, he was a winner, since his indomitable fighting spirit, demonstrated the people's noble and dignity.
<br /><br />When the life of all the human beings is concerned, who hasn't failed, no matter how successful he is? The reason of failure is different, but no matter how you fail, there is the strike that you cannot stand. When you go out to the sea again, you will have the hope of victory. I think the work is more attracting people are because of the kind of precarious life environment and the tenacious attitude toward life. The Old man in this story also said: “people are not born for defeat; a person can be destroyed, but can not be defeated.&quot; This statement reminds me of Beethoven's &quot;Fate Symphony&quot;, Beethoven once said: &quot;I can be destroyed, but I can not conquer.&quot; They explained the meaning of a hero, the meaning of life. And the article in the text also points out the idea of the article: people need to bravely face the failure. From this side, this book is not a fable or fairy, but a realistic work.
<br /><br />It is the values of life rather than triumph that become important in this novel. The old man’s courage to challenge and surmount difficulties wins our admiration and presents confidence as well as the strong spiritual power to human beings. &quot;The old man and sea&quot; has given me a lot of inspiration in life. What is failure, failure is getting up again with courage when falling down, never lost hope for life and do not lose your life dreams. What is hero? Hero is brave enough to face difficulty and challenge it and win himself. People who conquer difficulty have courage to finish the dream they have failed so many times. So this can be called a hero. I like Hemingway's the Old Man and Sea very much and also know that there are many ups and downs in Hemingway's life. He experienced wars and experienced the torture of diseases and illnesses but actually he had showed his courage again and again. What a pity is that he ended his life by committing suicide. Maybe he has his own reason for doing this, but his deed go against the definition of failure and the hero related in The Old Man and the Sea.
<br /><br />Failure is not dreadful. What we fear is we would submit to the failure. Once we do so, all the dreams will not be achieved. It is significant in the real life. I think life is just like the old man going to the sea for catching fishes and there will appear the situation that requires us to face courageously; even if we do not succeed, we will not leave regret to our life because of our failure to make efforts; we can also be strong characters in life and our life will become splendid because of the efforts we have made.

As early as a few centuries ago, scientists had clearly known what harm would hydrogen sulfide cause to human body. Now gas has become a primary factor that cause occupational diseases.Recession Chic â€“ How to Be Most Distinctive on a Budget
<br /><br />Our noses can smell the hydrogen sulfide with the 0.0047ppm density (1ppm is 1/1 million). Our breath will be controlled when the density increases into 500ppm. If the concentration gets to 800ppm, we will die in five minutes. But paradoxically, the human life can't be existence without hydrogen sulfide. Why people depend on this smelly gas? Let's look for the answer back to 250 million years ago. At that time, Permian era was going to close, a largest species extinction throughout history was showing, the prospect of lives on earth worry us.Golden Opportunity!! <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5pYmxpbmcuanAvc2lsdmVyLWJyb29jaGVz" target="_blank">????????</a> are the Favorite of 
<br /><br />A mainstream theory thinks that this catastrophe caused by the eruption of Siberian Voleanic, the carbon dioxide released from this process caused a series of environment changes, the oxygen content of the ocean down to a dangerous level, the life of the earth gradually slid into the abyss of the death. For the aerobic marine life, it was a bad news that the chemical composition of the sea water changed following above mentioned, but in this environment, anaerobic life like green sulfur bacteria flourished quickly. Anaerobiont will release large amount of hydrogen sulfide after taking advantage, further changed the marine environment, and more detrimental to the majority of remaining aerobic organisms' existence. The above-mentioned extinction theory considered that this deadly gas spread into air from ocean, which threaten the existence of plants and animals on land. When the Permian era ended, 95% of the marine lives and 70% of the terrestial lives had extincted. The important function of the hydrogen sulfide for the process of human psychology may have been kept from the 0.25 billion years ago, because we maybe survive from this disaster only bear or even using the hydrogen sulfide on some circumstances. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5pYmxpbmcuanAvc3dhcm92c2tpY3J5c3RhbC1lYXJyaW5ncw__" target="_blank">????????????</a> Gifts for Friends
<br /><br />Study confirmed that the human and rats' blood vessels will produce hydrogen sulfide, what function it has? In fact, the hydrogen sulfide is not the only known &quot;poison gas&quot; that work in human body. In the 80's of the 20th century, scientists had found some evidence which confirmed human body could create low concentration of nitric oxide(NO) as signal affectting molecules behavior. American pharmacologists once found that nitric oxide can expand blood vessels, regulate the immune system and transmits neural signals, etc. Another &quot;silent killer&quot;, colorless, amd odorless, carbon monoxide (CO) also has similar functions
<br /><br />A burst of pungent odor coming from my room brought me to the front of vitrine when I came home after work finished. The treasure-troves of my family were collected in the vitrine including the Easter eggs made in a campus activity by my eldest daughter. One of the eggs was broken where came out the pungent odor. I start to doubt whether the organs and tissue also can produce the hydrogen sulfide with smelly egg. I put the study of NO and CO concentrates into the effects to the cardiovascular system from then on. My study on hydrogen sulfide began at here. Facts have proved that my decision is definitely correct: a series of experiments showed that hydrogen sulfide has important biological activity. Preliminary studies have confirmed that there is CSE enzyme in smooth muscle cells which can produce hydrogen sulfide. The experiment on mouse, cattle and human endothelial cells also showed that these cells will similarly integrate this enzyme. The amount of the enzyme are even more than the smooth muscle cells .

<br /><br />China auto industry is confronted with many negative competitive factors in terms of the foreign trade, technologies and prices. 5 Kinds of <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5pYmxpbmcuanAvc2lsdmVyLXJpbmdz" target="_blank">???????</a> Allow You More Appealing As for foreign trade, China's auto trade deficit is quite large; from the perspective of technology development, the development capacity of China's auto industry is lagging behind. Would You Wear <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5pYmxpbmcuanAvcGVhcmwtcmluZ3M_" target="_blank">??????</a> ? Seeing from the angle of price, the prices of our country's saloon cars are lower than the imported cars of the same kind, but they don't have the advantage of substance price. Once China joined WTO, the tariff will decline to a great extent within a few years and the price advantage of the homemade cars will all go.
<br /><br />In terms of these three factors, Chinese auto industry is still in infant period and needs to be protected. The major measure for protection is to keep high tariffs on imported cars. The auto tariff in China has been high all the time, to be early close to the WTO's basic requirements, in recent years China has gradually reduced the level of car tariff. However, tariffs on other industrial products have dropped substantially over the last few years. The decline of tariffs on automobiles are relatively smaller, so there is a big chance that auto tarrifs will continue to drop. But considering the situation that China auto industry is still in infant industry and needs protetion, we will not be willing to make concessions on auto tariffs. 
<br /><br />Entering WTO will have positive effect on structural readjustment of our car industry, such positive effect can be analyzed from two factors: one is manufacturer's structure, the other is product structure. Seeing from the manufacturer structure, our government has been consistently focusing on cultivating economical cars and grand manufacturers since the auto industry policy is issued. As the Chinese market opens further, many world famous automobile group enter Chinese market, resulting in changes in firm structure of demostic automobile manufacturers. But these changes are limited, the previous situation which the domestic large car-producing groups will probably not have oversize changes. The reason is that such large domestic automobile manufacturers are closely related with our large automotive groups in the form of joint ventures.
<br /><br />In the whole car, closed car suffers from the biggest influence among all the other car patterns.
<br /><br />At present, Shanghai Automobile, No.1 Automobile and Changan Automobile own car concepts, among which, No.1 Automobile ranks in the first row of five hundred strong enterprises. FAW Car is our national brand and produces large quantities of new products suitable for our country’s basic conditions with the help of R$ D strength in FAW Car. However, the design and manufacture of new products still do not get rid of the operation manners and management systems limits of the First Automobile Group. It should be noted that the company's products are mainly located in high-end cars with high added value. This determines the companies in and abroad will form face to face competition, so the pressure and challenge will become greater. I believe that after entering WTO, our car consumption market will have obvious change in a short period of time, the rapid development of mini-size automobiles will become more mature.
