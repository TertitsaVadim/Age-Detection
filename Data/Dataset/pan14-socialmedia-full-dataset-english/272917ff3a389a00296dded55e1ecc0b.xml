This is not mentioned in any of the Wrath of the Lich King gold guides, but it's a good way to get extra gold to cover your repairs and to buy food and water.<br /><br />2. When items drop, save all the white items because this &lt;b&gt;lich de ban chu z&lt;/b&gt; means that it's useful to other players and that you can sell it at the auction house.<br /><br />I'm sure many of you already use the auction often to buy &lt;b&gt;lich bloc&lt;/b&gt; stuff and to sell stuff. Most people don't realize that this is a gold mine. Any WotLK gold guide or WoW gold guide will mention these techniques. The trick to using the auction house is MASTERING it. It is extremely difficult to learn it yourself <br />&lt;/u&gt;&lt;b&gt;m&amp;#7929; thu&amp;#7853;t vi&amp;#7879;t&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt; as you will lose a ton of gold at first.<br /><br />If you want a really detailed guide, and you are serious about wanting to make thousands of gold, you should use a WotLK or WoW Gold Guide.
