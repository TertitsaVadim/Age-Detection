My friends and I had just finished having a bonfire and just enjoying each others company. It had definitely turned out to be a wonderful day! As my friends left I entered the bathroom to clean up. I was happy, not paying attention to much of anything I recognized the talking of my parents, I smiled and continued on. I stopped a moment only to notice the immediate  silence that was soon overcome by my mother crying. I immediately walked out and slowly approached her. Looking deep into her red eyes sopping with tears I asked what happened… I instantly thought and unknowingly thought of Dustin.Yet I still asked what’d I miss who died, like a complete idot! She signaled me over towards her, she gave me a hug then told me the most terrifying and devastating news.. Dustin Bair had died. I instantly felt sick to my stomach and felt as if I were going to faint. I hugged my mom for comfort, and then quickly ran off to the closest place to lye down. I fell into the couch and lost complete memories of everything but was continually running through what I was just told and how it could ever be true. Then I began remembering all the wonderful things Dustin had done for me. How he always made me laugh. I always knew for a fact that I was loved and cared about by him. He did not treat me like a typical little sister he honord me and treated me like any human being should be treated. 
<br />	He taught me so much. I believe that with out him wanting to teach and share all that he did, to not only me but all his friends as well none of us would be the people we are today. At least I know I wouldn’t, and I have Dustin to thank for that. How deeply I was touched by simple inspiring things that Dustin would say to me. Which has made HUGE changes in my life, and continues to each day.  We all loved him from the day we met him till the past couple of weeks no matter what was said or done, we still love him to this day! Dustin was a part of each and every one of us and made a difference in each and every one of our lives. 
<br />It was hard to know that behind the amazingly adorable smile and all the wonderful laughing to think that he was suffering underneath. I hate the thought that someone who ever acted as happy as Dustin did could now be gone! And in such a tragic way as well. He was not only my big brother but my BEST FREIND! He was and still is a great kid, maybe a little rough around the edges but so is everyone else, it just happens that he paied for someone elses mistake! We don’t know why, but who knows it may have been for a reason. Knowing that keeps me going every day, i just remember theres a reason for everything. SO they say..
<br />	I love Dustin and I always will. He is a part of me no matter where he is or has gone. I miss him so much, it’s as if part of me no longer exists. 
<br />I love my brother more than anything!!

<br />I wish it could be undone, oh, if it only could.
<br /><br />I realize the memories I've made will be all there is.
<br />My grandfather's memories, mine and his.
<br /><br />See, my grandfather passed away today and will never be back.
<br />And now it's moments with him that I will sadly lack.
<br /><br />He won't be here to see me get my license or my car.
<br />See me go to prom or graduate, because he is so far.
<br /><br />But I guess he's in a better place.
<br />He resides in Heaven, and is surrounded by God's grace.
<br /><br />Now he can watch over me throughout the night and day.
<br />And I can pretend that he's not really away.
<br /><br />He can stay with me in a place inside my heart.
<br />And of me, he can still be a part

<br />People were watching us.
<br />But I didn't notice now.
<br /><br />I walked over to you,
<br />I touched your sweet face.
<br />I tried not to cry, but the tears
<br />they were always there.
<br /><br />I tasted the tears of anger and sorrowness,
<br />I tried to tell myself it was all a bad dream -
<br />But then I realized that dreams
<br />aren't supposed to hurt you.
<br /><br />As I leaned over,
<br />I whispered into your ear,
<br />I love you.
<br /><br />Then I put the flowers on the casket,
<br />And I quietly walked out saying,
<br />Goodbye.

<br /><br />although the more i know i love you, the more my heart will break.
<br /><br />I swear we could lay together starting at noon,
<br /><br />and stay that way untill we end with the moon.
<br /><br />Our love can't be held back by rumors and lies,
<br /><br />when i cry, thoughts of you seem to dry my eyes.
<br /><br />we'll take on the world ill be by your side,
<br /><br />and together we will reside.
<br /><br />Well stay like this forever,
<br /><br />We'll stay like this from here on out.
<br /><br />as long as we are together,
<br /><br />i wont have a fear or a doubt.
<br /><br />We'll escape and get out of here,
<br /><br />you will be here in my heart.
<br /><br />there will always be the casual tear,
<br /><br />but we knew that from the start
<br /><br />its here in your arms i belong,
<br /><br />and in my heart you will confide.
<br /><br />the whole idea of this song,
<br /><br />is to show that my lonliness has died.
<br /><br />we'll great sorrow with an open mind,
<br /><br />it'll make us stronger, than we'll leave it behind.
<br /><br />if were ever apart i will get you back,
<br /><br />well find anything we need or lack.
<br /><br />It'll be me and you, time will fade away
<br /><br />we'll forget our worries and live for today.
<br /><br />we'll keep on going, we wont turn around,
<br /><br />well be to occupied with this love that we've found.
<br /><br />[repeat the chorus]
<br /><br />our thoughts together will harmonize,
<br /><br />our hearts will begin to synchronize,
<br /><br />its about then that we'll realize,
<br /><br />that love has no disguise,
<br /><br />all i have to do is look in your eyes,
<br /><br />and i will always know a new day will rise.

<br />and now as a 17 year old girl with out my big brother and best friend im quite lost and confused..
<br />im often scared about things i shouldnt be. and i often dont know what to do.. or say.
<br />And with today being the day we remember him and remember all he did. just makes things that much harder. i dont know if i should sit around and swollow in my own pain, suffering, and overall sadness. or if i should honor the life he lived, and and thank god for blessing me with him as my big brother and best friend. So many people think im depressing myself more and more by not letting go. But its so hard. How do you let go of someone so close and so dear. And the worst part is that he died for someone elses mistakes.. He didnt diserve to die. And now i sit and Question why god. why did you chose him.??
<br /><br />if anyone has any advice on how to deal with this please by all means let me know ..
<br />thank you!!
