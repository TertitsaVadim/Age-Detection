<br /><br />1. Men are not interested in what women have to say  – unless it’s about sport, food and sex
<br />False – men do want to know what women have to say –they just are not good at knowing how to communicate with women
<br /><br />2. Men want somebody who is just like their mother True –but they don’t know it…
<br />Although men want to be loved, nurtured and often spoiled, they are subconsciously attracted to women who are similar to their mom
<br /><br />3. Men only think about sex -False
<br />Men do think a lot about sex (generally more than women) but men too, yearn for an emotional connection. When women evolve to place priorities on children and family, the man still wants regular sex
<br /><br />4. He’s spoiling me, so he must have plenty of cash to splash  -True and False
<br />Some guys will go into debt to initially impress and win a woman
<br /><br />5. If I sleep with him on the first date, he won’t respect me -True
<br />Men are innately hunters and prize the rare catch. If the woman is too easy to win, he feels she is not so special – even though he may be the one pressuring her to sleep with him.
<br /><br />6. I can change him -False
<br />Women fall in love with a man’s potential and plan to change him for the better and then become despondent when they realize they can’t change him.
<br /><br />7. Men are interested in a woman’s dating history -False –they prefer not to know
<br />The male ego says “I am the first, the best and the only one able to please you!”
<br /><br />8. Men don’t like women who make the first move True –if they want a long-term relationship
<br />An apparent contradiction – the male ego is initially stroked and flattered by a woman who makes the first move but he usually gets bored in the long-term because men like to be the hunter –not the hunted.
<br /><br />9. Men prefer “bitches” -False
<br />Some men with low self-esteem choose women who are controlling. Men are, though, attracted to women who know their own mind and are clear about what they want.
<br /><br />10. Men prefer young women –True
<br />Men prefer young women but not for the reasons women think: men are attracted to the women who are young in spirit, playful, take care of their bodies and looks, and still have a passion for life.

They hide age, weight, feelings, qualities, and do things that men have never thought of doing. On that note, we explore some funny, weird facts about women that are lesser-known.
<br /><br />Women always carry their handbags around: Men must have not noticed this, but women always carry their handbags or purses. They feel awkward if they don't carry anything in their hands. And we really don't know what they have inside their bags!
<br /><br />Women never have anything to wear: Give them thousands of bucks; they can spend the whole sum on shopping. And still complain that they haven't got anything to wear. The fact is that most of the clothes or accessories in their closets are either one-time-wear or not even that.
<br /><br />Women don't bathe everyday: Not all women bathe everyday, no matter how much they profess cleanliness and hygiene. They rely on deodorants and perfumes to smell good.
<br /><br />Women eat a hell lot: When men are around, women act like they eat too little. But when left alone she can polish off a full size pizza. Now, we know why women always talk about food and recipes.
<br /><br />Why women love TV serials/Soap operas so much: We know most of the TV serials look so stupid and funny but women still love them. Probably they just want to feel that there are people worse off than them. Now you should know why a Balika Vadhu kind of show is so famous.
<br /><br />After sex women still love to be kissed: Men always feel tired and prefer to sleep after sex, but women don't. They like to talk, fool around, and kiss each other. For a great relationship, men should take note of this.
<br /><br />Others
<br /><br />-Women worry about their looks while having sex
<br /><br />-Women love to bargain, even if they don't like the buy
<br /><br />-Around seventy per cent women would rather have chocolate than sex
<br /><br />-Women don't like another woman to wear the same dress
<br /><br />-Women mature much faster than men
<br /><br />-Women can spend a whole day before the mirror
<br /><br />-Women don't need sex as often as men do. Sex is more about emotions for women.

<br />Gandhi's Quotes  Gandhi's Books     
<br /><br />Man often becomes what he believes himself to be. If I keep on saying to myself that I cannot do a certain thing, it is possible that I may end by really becoming incapable of doing it. On the contrary, if I have the belief that I can do it, I shall surely acquire the capacity to do it even if I may not have it at the beginning.

In short, they say a man and a woman can never be friends — as for being best friends, that’s a distant dream.Relationship experts say having a best friend from the opposite sex is one of the main reasons marriages are failing these days.
<br />When two people from the opposite sex get emotionally close to each other, at least one of them is bound to get attracted to the other and this can cause problems if they are married to different people,” says Dr Kamal Khurana, a relationship counsellor,The society opening up to having friends from the opposite sex, are we emotionally intelligent enough to handle all these relationships? Not quite, says Dr Rachna Singh, lifestyle expert, Artemis Hospital. “The real problem starts when you are married and have a best friend from the opposite sex. The definition of a best friend overlaps into the definition of a spouse. And then there is a conflict,” 
<br />A friendship is about companionship, trust and love. And a marriage is about companionship, trust, love and sex. The Sword is the only distinguishing factor. “ In such triangular relationships jealousy creeps causing a conflict,” says Singh.
<br />but still i feel...there are women, who can maintain the relationship with ...spouse n friend...equally.!

<br />A bird of low degree!
<br />My life is of little value.
<br />But the dear Lord cares for me
<br />He gave me a coat of feathers
<br />'Tis very plain I know:
<br />With never a speck of crimson.
<br />For it was not made for show.
<br />But it keeps me warm in winter,
<br />It shields me from the rain.
<br />Were it bordered with gold and purple
<br />Perhaps it would make me vain
<br /><br />I have no barn or storehouse:
<br />I never sow or reap:
<br />God gives me a sparrow's portion.
<br />But never a seed to keep.
<br />If my meat is sometimes scanty.
<br />Close picking makes it sweet:
<br />I have always enough to keep me.
<br />And life is more than meat.
<br />I know there are many sparrows:
<br />All over the world they're found:
<br />But our heavenly Father knows
<br />When one of us falls to the ground.
<br /><br />Though small, we are never forgotten-
<br />Though weak, we are never afraid.
<br />For we know that the dear Lord keeps
<br />The lives of the creatures He made.
<br />I fly through the thickest forest,
<br />I light on many a spray,
<br />I have no chart or compass,
<br />But I never lose my way.
