And that choice will let you be much tall, giving people elegant feeling. However, if you are petite woman, you'd better not to choose that kind, and my suggestion would be the strapless, or spaghetti bandage. What's more, if your stomach is not flat, a little protuding is fine, the dark color, such as deep red, green strips on the waist is fitted for you.
