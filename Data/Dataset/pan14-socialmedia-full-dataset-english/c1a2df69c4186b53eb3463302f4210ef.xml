Research that these days, thanks to computer software program, is much easier than it was then.<br /><br />The research focused on the harm caused towards the human body, especially the knee and thigh joints as a result of prolonged running on various surfaces.<br /><br />The results revealed 3 main styles of running; Neutral, Supenation and Pronation.<br /><br />The Natural running style is exactly where the runners foot lands flat on the ground and doesn't roll either inwards or outwards, but the foot travels in a straight line. This style of running is often the best for endurance running.<br /><br />Pronation - This is exactly where the foot rolls inwards as it hits the ground, and moves to the side as it travels forwards. Common injuries caused by this kind of running are Tarsel tunnel syndrome, shin splints and bunyons.<br /><br />Supenation - The style is opposite of Pronation - In this case, the foot rolls outwards. Excessive supenation can cause shin splints and ankle sprains.<br /><br />You will find now different versions of running footwear developed to cope with whatever style of running you have. An excellent deal of shoes use different density of foam in areas of the sole to provide extra and firmer support where needed to minimise the harm caused to your body with excessive running.<br /><br />Other advances in running footwear consist of the Air Sole from Nike which was created in 1972. The inventor put rubber into his waffle machine at house and stuck the resulting 'waffle sole' onto a regular pair of running shoes. Hopefully, you will be performing it all in clean running shoes.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.blogster.com%2Fbarneybuckne923%2Fhow-you-can-learn-more-about-running-shoes-so-you-can-exercise-more-safely"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.blogster.com/barneybuckne923/how-you-can-learn-more-about-running-shoes-so-you-can-exercise-more-safely</a>
