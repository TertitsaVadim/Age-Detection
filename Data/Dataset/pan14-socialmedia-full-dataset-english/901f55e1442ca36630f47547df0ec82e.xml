<br /><br />Whatever you say I contradict
<br />I lead the Rebellion with the raised fist
<br />Some guys scream others rap like this
<br />Were living in an age where there’s a war in our midst
<br />Every thing I say someone gets pissed
<br />Did you expect your ass to get kissed?
<br />Watch your back or you’ll get your ass kicked
<br />Then you’ll be the one needing your wounds licked
<br /><br />Hang me with the velvet noose
<br />Ask me what I am but I never got to choose
<br />The first day lobotomise exist
<br />Ignorance became bliss
<br />Fuck it to fuck this
<br />All the words from the enemy just happened to miss
<br /><br />People once found a way to keep my words at bay
<br />Now days I’m like Sit, Stay
<br />Is Holland really for the get-go
<br />Full of drugs, pimps and dirty hoe’s
<br />It should be a place for juggalos to burn jigaloes  
<br />Hi mom, I just destroyed radio 
<br />Watch what you say with the accusations
<br />I’ll nock you out without hesitation  
<br />This one time he said [“remove your hands from my bitch”]
<br />Ok remove your hands from your wrists
<br />So I can make a chicken handwitch, and smack back across the face with it
<br />Face it, I made it and you hate it
<br />I never dealt with the classroom sluts
<br />Knocking back shots with monkeys in little jungle huts
<br />I'm always first to fight for what I thinks right
<br />Piss me off; I’ll use the bass to keep you up all night
<br />Why are u so uptight
<br />I'm gone, watch me walk away with a halo light

<br /><br />What did you think the worst possible outcome would be?
<br />Was it some thing you had to see to believe?
<br />Or was it something you hoped would prevent me to breathe?
<br />If it’s going to be this way, don’t beg me to stay when I threaten to leave
<br />I stay; I’m a dog on its leash.
<br />I leave; I can make my own words to my own beats
<br />Every thing you think you needed to say is stuff I don’t care hearing
<br />I don’t intend on believing, it started as lying, and it’s ended with me leaving
<br />By the time you start seeing the message I’m breathing into this song
<br />You might realize what it’s written on
<br />You’ll see it’s not a suicide note
<br />I could kill myself, but you know I won’t
<br />But you may realize I am already gone
<br />Don’t worry, my heart was already torn
<br />And I become me
<br />Free to be someone eventually
<br />On the count of three I see the problem wasn’t in me
<br />It was in you, and all the things you do
<br />And all the things you knew,
<br />They were wrong to
<br />You don’t know shit
<br />I may not show this
<br />But your life is pompous
<br />To top this
<br />You can’t do shit to stop this

<br /><br />Hey, I am only 15
<br />I’m a child who’ gonna’ be heard and seen
<br />Living to create the new life long dream
<br />I was never a machine, not exactly what I mean
<br />Never programmed to say what’s best for the music scene
<br />My music has all the shots missin’ it
<br />People pissed off coz in comparison I’m more legitimate 
<br />Forget punk that caught up in the mainstream
<br />That’s just my opinion; lets see what the others deem
<br /><br />Ok, here’s the story of girl come anorexic
<br />She believes she comes closer to being perfect
<br />So many night bent over the toilet
<br />She keeps her finger s in her throat until she hurls it
<br />She can’t believe it
<br />She’s not fat but her pain comes from her stomach
<br />It’s debated
<br />Her parents argue whether its medical or a phase they hated
<br />Chances are she won’t make it past 25
<br />She’s 16, skin-bone skeleton and at the hight of her life
<br /><br />NOW!
<br />Raise the glass [to the people who have died]
<br />Raise the glass [to the people who fought thru a wasted life]
<br />Raise the glass [to all the people had all there dreams collide]
<br />Raise the glass [to all the people on my side]
<br /><br />Let me establish you to the boy called X
<br />He lives his day as if it revolved around a hex
<br />He’s like the guy in the video clip of Thoughtless
<br />It’s complicated tho coz there’s more to this
<br />He gets pushed around, beaten down
<br />Tears mix with concrete when he hits ground
<br />He thinks his cool because he listens to EMINEM
<br />Guys hit him, girls laugh at him
<br />His parents wonder what was so bad they missed just happen
<br />Thoughts seep in of his own life endin’
<br />Goes to extreme lengths just to start blending
<br />Takes a blade to his wrist and starts hackin away at the skin
<br />There may have been a happy ending but he already gave in

<br /><br />Understanding Oil
<br />9/13/2001
<br /><br />The brutal attacks/bombings this week in New York, and Washington D.C., along with threats of attacks there and elsewhere in the country have changed our times forever. While the mass media concentrates on the details of the destruction, and the blanketed words of politicians, I will attempt to understand and explain the events from the fence. BOMBING AND BEING BOMBED ARE THE SAME THINGS ON DIFFERENT SIDES OF THE FENCE. 
<br /><br />Terror is not a spontaneous human action without credence. People just don’t hijack planes and commit hari-kari (suicide) without any weight of thought to the action. No one in the media seems to ask WHY DID THESE PEOPLE DO THIS HORRIFIC ACT OF VIOLENCE AND DESTRUCTION? 
<br /><br />To be able to understand the answer to this, we must first look at our U.S. Mideast Policy. During most of the 20th century, U.S. businesses have worked on attaining oil rights and concessions from countries in the Middle East and Eastern Europe. After WWI, secret back door deals by our State Dept. yielded oil rights from then defeated Turkey to fields in what is now Iraq and Saudi Arabia, in return for looking the other way at a crime against humanity, the Genocide of the Armenians by the Turks. Oil profits have been the motivating factors behind many attempts at counterinsurgency of democratic regimes by the CIA and the U.S in the Middle East (such as Iran in the 1950s, where the Shah replaced the Prime Minister who refused to give up oil rights to the U.S., and since the people couldn’t deal with the Shah, an extremist government headed by the Ayatollah Khomeini ultimately prevailed). During the Iran-Iraq war, America supplied both sides with weapons and advice. These are not the actions of a rich superpower wanting peace. Lets not forget that Saddam Hussein, before being Americas vision of the Anti-Christ, was a close ally of the U.S., and the CIA. So what was the firm belief system of consecutive American administrations that caused all this to occur? PEACE IN THE MIDDLE EAST WILL LEAD TO HIGHER OIL AND GASOLINE PRICES. Let’s not also forget the power of the Arms industry, disguised as defence that still sells billions of dollars of weapons to the area. Therefore it has not been in the short-term economic interest of the U.S. to foster Peace in the Middle East. Using the above reasoning, the U.S. has encouraged extremist governments, toppled democracies, as in the case of Iran to replace it with a monarchy, rigged elections, and many more unspeakable political crimes for U.S. businesses abroad. Let’s not also forget the Red Scare. During the war between the then Soviet Union and Afghanistan, the U.S. armed and supported the Taliban, a fundamentalist Muslim organization, and allowed them to export opium and heroin out of their country to pay for those weapons. Therefore the Taliban rose to power and control with the help of the U.S.A. Today, the bombing of Iraq still continues, no longer covered by the media, the economic embargo still remains, killing millions of children, and recently, while the world and the U.N. General Assembly have cried out to bring in peacekeeping forces into Israel and Palestine, to end the escalated war and recent assassinations, the U.S. has vetoed the rest of the Security Council and has halted the possibility of peace, there, in the most volatile place in the world. 
<br /><br />People in Serbia, Lebanon, Iraq, Sudan, and Afghanistan to name a few have seen bombs fall, not always at military targets and kill innocent civilians, as the scene in New York city yesterday. The wars waged by our government in our names has landed smack in the middle of our living room. The half hour of destruction closed down all world financial markets, struck the central headquarters of our military, and had our leaders running into bunkers, and our citizens into fear and frenzy. What scares me more than what has occurred is what our reactions to the occurrences may cause. President Bush belongs to a long generation of Republican Presidents who love war economies. The media has only concentrated on the bombings, if you will, and what types of retaliations are looming for the perpetrators. What everyone fails to realize is that the bombings are a reaction to existing injustices around the world, generally unseen to most Americans. To react to a reaction would be to further sponsor the reaction. In other words, my belief is that the terror will multiply if concrete steps are not taken to sponsor peace in the Middle East, NOW. This does not mean that we should not find the guilty party(s), Bin Laden, or whoever they may be, and not try them. Put simply, as long as a major injustice remains, violence precipitates to the surface of life. 
<br /><br />Native American folklore, the Bible, Nostradamus, and many other major religious beliefs point to this era with the visuals of yesterday’s disasters, and conditions of ecological disasters we experience daily in our lives today. War, rumours of war, famine, long burning fires, etc., are at our doorstep. We can prevail over this possible vision with the power of the human spirit, understanding, compassion, and peace. IT’S TIME TO PUT OUR NEEDS FOR SECURITY AND SURVIVAL, ACHIEVED ONLY THROUGH PEACE, ABOVE AND BEYOND PROFITS, ESPECIALLY IN THESE TIMES. 
<br /><br />SOLUTION: 
<br /><br />The U.S. should stop sidestepping the U.N. Security Council, and allow U.N. Peacekeeping troops and missions to the Middle East. Stop the violence first. 
<br /><br />Stop the bombing and patrol of Iraq. 
<br /><br />With today’s gains in the use of alternative fuels, develop them to full usage with autos and other utilities, to make the country less dependant on an already depleting natural reserve, oil. 
<br /><br />By initiating peace, we would have already shaken the foundations of support for Bin Laden, and/or all those that sponsor activities like those we saw yesterday, and break the stronghold of extremists on the world of Islam. On the other hand, if we carry out bombings on Afghanistan or elsewhere to appease public demand, and very likely kill innocent civilians along the way, wed are creating many more martyrs going to their deaths in retaliation against the retaliation. As shown from yesterday’s events, you cannot stop a person who’s ready to die.

<br /><br />Ok, this is the way I see life
<br />Lay back and erase the wrong from the right
<br />Or I could erase my memories of you so I can sleep at night
<br />Trying to sort myself out to bring what I can to the fight
<br />The sunlight burns the soul of sleeping men
<br />I wait for you to remember I had my chance in a time back then
<br />I close my eyes to escape to my world of pretend
<br />But I might get lost when they open again
<br />Sometimes, I think I can hear your voice
<br />I can’t tell from all the mental background noise
<br />The way you make me feel wasn’t always my choice
<br />This emotion that I have just won’t seem to poise
<br />I don’t know wether to run away from you and hide
<br />Because if I loose you then I shut down on the inside
<br /><br />Coz of this im starting to freak out
<br />If this keeps going I’ll start to beat my self down
<br />One day I might run thru rain to your front door
<br />Until then I live my rebirth and before
<br /><br />This isn’t the way u wanted me to be
<br />Whatever I became, u never wanted to see
<br />In the end you’ll just walk away
<br />And I’ll just lie here, trying to breathe
<br />I used to think that we were one when we looked eye to eye
<br />But now days wen we do that, 
<br />Im scared that you’ll see how fucked up I am on the inside
<br />Being with you use to be infinite bliss
<br />Now I fight the erg to put cuts across my wrists
<br />The thought of you chokes me like every thread of the noose
<br />Im trying my hardest to fight it, but without you I have nothing else to loose
<br />I can usually back my words with a fist
<br />But I was helpless when I watched you walk away into the mist

<br /><br />With painkillers in my system and alcohol on my breath I finally wake up from a dream just to enter another, at this rate I should only breathe one second and be silent for another, any way you look at it the instance of the object doesn’t change at all, you can see who I am no matter which side of the cage, I would ask to be left alone, to isolate myself from the rest of the world but my life is already full of regrets, im already an image of what I hate and I end up wreaking what I love. As a wise man once asked me “do you serve a prepose or do you purposely serve”, I tried to answer but was silenced with uncertainty, maybe if I bleed fast enough it could blur the edges of reality enough that it became a concept worth while and yet I remember that you’re the reason that I cant feel anything anymore because if I let you get close I will get hurt, but I cant get rid of you from my memories because you’re the virus in my system, if I get rid of you the whole system shuts down but that may have been the answer I was looking for, I leave this life without remorse for my stupid actions but at the cost of ignorance, I would ask myself if that’s what I want but I just don’t know anymore, I want to be with you but I want to be alone, I want to be loved but how’s that possible when I hate what im becoming

<br /><br />...This one bulletin is for you...
<br /><br />Not many girls appreciate nice guys anymore...
<br />And because of this, there are not many left out there...
<br /><br />i guarantee 90% of the men on pan.netwill not repost this cuz they care more about their image
<br /><br />If you are a nice guy repost this with &quot;We're a Dying Breed &quot;
<br /><br />If you are a girl that thinks every guy should treat a girl this way
