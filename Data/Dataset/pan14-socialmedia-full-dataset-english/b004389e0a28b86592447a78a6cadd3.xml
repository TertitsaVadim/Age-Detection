Especially in the conditions of the sacks of coffee does not allow opening, smelling the fresh coffee beans to judge the extent of the role is particularly highlighted. The producing time printed on the coffee bean bags is usually the packing time rather than the actual roasting time.Therefore, whether the coffee is fresh or preserved good enough all depends on the smell.Hey Mom! How Can You Resist the Glamour of Precious <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy52b2d1ZXNob3dzLmNvbS8_" target="_blank">fashion jewelry</a> 
<br /><br />If it is a one-way ventilation valve aluminum foil bag, we can put nose near the ventilation valve of circular cavities, and then gently squeeze packaging. 4 Reasons for You to Put on Top Grade <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy52b2d1ZXNob3dzLmNvbS8_" target="_blank">fashion jewelry</a> If no gas is squeezed out or the gas squeezed out has no taste, which means that there are problems on sealing bags. What to Dress with Either the beans are not fresh when packaging them or the coffee are long time before. In a word, the coffee does not worth buying.
<br /><br />If some fragrance comes out, you still need to identify scent carefully. The best fragrance should be strong and permanent.
<br /><br />And if the aroma that comes out is so little that you cannot even smell it carefully, the fragrance is called to be inadequate. The reason is either that the beans are not fresh or that there is a problem with the quality of the beans. And that always occurs to coffee beans that are not fresh and not roasted in a proper way. If it is heavily greasy or smelly in the fragrance, it generally shows that the coffee bean is lightly-baked and not fresh.
<br /><br />It’s hard to smell than to look, but it can have a better understanding of the coffee’s quality. Maybe the feeling of smell isn’t that acute at first, but you can get a right judgment of coffee’s quality if you smell frequently. As a result, it is not enough to just looking over when choosing coffee, and you have to smell it.
<br /><br />Pure coffee bean contains a rich aroma that will bring us enter a dreamed paradise. That fragrance is different from others, not pungent, not blazing, with unique personality and full charm. It should make people linger and forget to return, leaving people endless aftertastes.

Let us listen to these stupid ads: Do you love her? If you do,send her. Do you want to hedge your love? Send her diamond .Do you want to to create a warm and romantic atmosphere of the festival ? Please go to-- Vocational Resort . - This advertisment is so inferior,but there is still faithful men and women,they are glad to join in----though the most situation is because women blames,man are not foolish.Summer Most Cool-Looking <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy52b2d1ZXNob3dzLmNvbS8_" target="_blank">fashion clothing</a> 
<br /><br />Let a man's heartbeat fastly is not just Valentine's Day. On Christmas,men should also invite women to a big dinner and see a film. No wonder more and more obligations are in the hearts of men, holiday is not like festivals, but more like a &quot;rob the Day&quot; - wallet is robbed, a or two month hard-earned money is devastated in the name of the &quot;love&quot; I don't understand, since love is for both men and women, which are willing and the mutual relationship, why the holiday spends. Why the obligations to take charge of maintaining and sublimating aways fall on men? Are men severely rinsed in the game of &quot;equality of men and women&quot;?Let's Enjoy Highest <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy52b2d1ZXNob3dzLmNvbS8_" target="_blank">fashion jewelry</a> in Hannover
<br /><br />Women likes to say that if two have love, every day is Valentine's Day to which men should be be alert obviously. This is not to say that Valentine's Day should be diluted into a normal day, but that normal life should be promoted to Valentine's Day - every day, do not forget it. It said that women are mostly considerate, naturally frugal, but simply take the Valentine's Day same as a men's spend day, that explained we are deviated from the track on this issue more or less, so both men and women need to calm down, re - think the significance of festivals, as well as the meaning of love. On Valentine's Day, if a man can make a meal for his wife, that is better than all of the delicious food in my opinion. The real meal is made by heart, can a woman would believe that all restaurant meal masters are your lovers.
<br /><br />What a pity that most women prefer to accept sevice which cooks in the restaurants apply rather than fried rice with egg that men beat his brains to make. Love is no longer the feeling between human beings but anything you can buy with money such as commodity, service and creativity as well as rubbishes of all forms. Man &quot;I am rather for her only distressed as I did.&quot; businessmen &quot;I am rather for her only smiled as I did.&quot; Festivals, became a ticket received by man on regular times, until he has no money, but he still keeps saying: Happy Valentine's Day! To happiness, can not expect someone else to give, must know that no one is riding a horse to save you; while the sky drop cake will only broke your head. To be happy, they are relied on yourselves. Maybe I still hope that this farewell performance can be colorful beautiful, as the dissilient skyrocket on sky.If our love really comes over, we still rememer it in a simplest and uneasiest way.

Similar to other famous tourist resorts on the world, Madeira Islands have their own quietness and crowdedness. Anecdotes and legends: in 1419, sailor Sark was caught in the storm on the Atlantic expedition voyage to Guinea, and the fleet was blown hundreds of miles away from the route, and therefore, they found a nameless islands covered with rich vegetation, and then named the islands Porto Santo Island, to show their gratitude.

Sound <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy52b2d1ZXNob3dzLmNvbS8_" target="_blank">fashion shoes</a> , the Luxury that Makes all Sweet Crazy! And the island was also called Desai Ta, meaning &quot;Desirt Island&quot; At that time, only few of people had the rare maps, and finally due to be forgotten and lost again. So afterward there were the Sark’s adventures of the Madeira Islands in 1419. Amazing floral island: Madeira is a volcanic island, and there is no any spring, river or underground river underflow, but you can hear the flowing sound of water, which is very strange. Where does its source come from? It turns out that the warm and humid air blown to the island by wind is blocked by mountains more than 1000 meters, then it forms the clound and rain to the ground. Therefore, it is precise that there are wonders of rain every night, and it never delay
<br /><br />Residents on the islands use the gift of nature building many water drainages, and make layers of terrace, planting flowers and trees to decorate the small island. In this way, Madeira, which is already full of forest, seems more gorgeous and charming. The island is like spring all year round, and covered with blooming flowers like a piece of brocade. There are numerous tropical fruits which originally belong to America everywhere. No wonder people call it sweetly as “the island of flowers and fruits”; with enough sunshine, warm sea, Madeira is a paradise to relax and forget troubles. C. Ronaldo’s hometown: many people know this island because it is the hometown of C. Ronaldo. In 2008, after the decision of Ballon d'Or, Madeira gained another name card to be respectful according to C. Ronaldo winning the award. Perhaps to express love for home, the clothing brand &quot;CR7&quot; named by Cristiano Ronaldo’s own name set its headquarters in the capital of Madeira Island, Funchal. His two sisters, Elma and Katia are the managers of this clothing store. He once held the brand CR7 fashion conference there, and he himself being the model.
<br /><br />Not long ago, it's said that Ronaldo planed to invest 60000000 Euro to build a holiday hotel in the island with teammate Cavallo and Decaux. Due to the golden brand of European Football Sir, they didn't worry there was no tourists. Of course, Madella and sports does not maintain the origin of the Cristiano Ronaldo. Every year in March, the island is still having an important event of Madella golf game. In 2006, it is always a rookie on the tour competition and challenge tournament jointly by the events. In 2006, the opening game was recovered and the game completely had also significantly promoted more vast in its expansion.
<br /><br />In addition, it has excellent food as well. Of course, the beauty of the Madeira does not only lies in its scenery, but the different kind of food in sailing times The day has quite declined if you stroll about Funchal, then the full smell of smoked meat in this city will arouse your consciousness, let you be anxious to find restaurants to satisfy a craving. The most famous dish in Madeira is Espetada. It's a kind of beef kebabs adopting Madeira special beef salted by Madeira wine added with laurel, garlic and pimento, charcoal fire-cured after done by pine branches. It is said that Espetada is not only delicious, but an eyewitnesser of the European table revolution at the Age of Discovery, which has witnessed a series of changes that the north and south relay station Madeira brought to the European food culture.

<br /><br />The age of 2G adopts vocal communication-based application model, While 3G will change to concentrate on data service. In other words, in addition to voice services,people need to find more applications based on wireless data transmission.
<br /><br />Global mobile operators and industry chain partners, giving full play to imagination and creativity, has developed a wide range of innovative and effective business models, Among them, there are three models proved to be practical at now.
<br /><br />The first one is to use the ad income to make an allowance to or cover the customers’ WAP fee. This kind of mode succeeds in mobile music, game distribution, mobile Internet browsing, mobile networking and many other wireless application services.
<br /><br />The second mode is to establish the fare structure of diversity to reduce the users' network access fee. One of the common forms that reflects the model is to make the cost of service by multiple users sharing. For example, lots of people share the same broadband internet connection in an internet bar.
<br /><br />Another embodiment is the service that only charges for small and varied amount of money in the name of usage without a set fee. For instance charge for the poundage according to each transfer transaction, or the media music fee according to the time.
<br /><br />And the last form is to sell some basic service to the customers with an affordable price and then cross-sell or up-sell some services. The third business mode is to provide mobile services for improving community health care, education or welfare in cooperation with the government or non-profit organizations. In this model, mobile networks operators can enjoy subsidies, preferential loan and/ or preferential tax policies. The U.S. mobile networks operator Sprint have developed mobile medical services by use of 3G.

The most concerned part is energy development, including 5 technologies in the top 6 rank.Why the Most Expensive <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy52b2d1ZXNob3dzLmNvbS8_" target="_blank">fashion shoes</a> for April are So Strange?
<br /><br />&quot;Carbon garbage change oil&quot; technology topped 1 in the list. The technology proposed any carbon material from animal offal to discarded tires can be converted into oil at the appropriate temperature and pressure.10 Reasons for You to Pick <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy52b2d1ZXNob3dzLmNvbS8_" target="_blank">fashion jewelry</a> 
<br /><br />Hydrogen fuel technology ranks the third. What is the Future of Perfect <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy52b2d1ZXNob3dzLmNvbS8_" target="_blank">fashion shoes</a> ? God Knows! Hydrogen fuel cells use hydrogen and oxygen to generate electricity, only to produce water, so it is known as the non-pollution fossil fuels substitute. Till now, scientists have successfully invented the hydrogen fuel battery which can provide electric for small machines such as the laptop. Some car manufactors are making efforts on the invention of hydrogen fuel battery car.
<br /><br />&quot;Turn light energy to electirc&quot; skill is on the fourth place. Solar energy battery is no longer new for us. The key point of the research is how to improve the utiltity efficient of sun lights.
<br /><br />The technology of thermal sea power ranks fifth. According to the statistics from US Department of Energy, the global ocean absorbs solar radiation equivalent of 250 billion barrels of petrol per day while the energy America consumes per year is only equivalent of 7.5 billion barrels of petrol. Besides, the temperature difference between the different depth of ocean could be used to make energy, but this technique was not ripe, because of the low efficiency.
<br /><br />The tidal power is sixth in list, it is the old concept in last early century. It uses the energy generated by tidal water to drive the generator generating electricity, but the current problem is that this technology is intractable, and sometimes the tide is too small to generate enough energy.
<br /><br />In addition to resource development, reduce pollution exhaust is the main problem to be solved by 10 environmental technologies. The technique of ‘garden in the air’ was on the seventh. It brought forward that setting gardens and planting trees on the top of city buildings could absorb the heat and carbon dioxide, releasing oxygen at the same time. What’s more, this proposal would help to reduce temperature of buildings which will save AC application and finally release city “tropical island effect”.
<br /><br />The technique of biodegradation was on the eighth. The biodegradation meant using plants or animalcules decomposing the pollution and poisonous matters. Typical examples include using micro-organisms to eliminate nitrate pollution of water and using certain plants to absorb soil arsenic compounds.
<br /><br />The technique of deep burying of exhaust was on the ninth. Someone said the carbon dioxide could be separated from other pollution, inject it into the old oil well, reservoir with high salinity, even in the ocean. Although this proposal sounds reasonable, scientists doubt how long it will last and how much it will cost.
<br /><br />The ten main environmental technologies pay attention to not only the “open source”, but also “expenditure reduction”. The technology of desalination of sea water ranks second, which means removing the salt and minerals in seawater, and then seawater can be turned into fresh water. UN statistics show that water shortage will influence the world population of billions of life by the middle of this century. Seawater desalination technology can solve water nervous of part of region in a certain extent. However, this technology has two technical problems higher cost and power consumption. Scientists now are studying on how to use cheap fuel to make water evaporation in order to improve efficiency.
<br /><br />Ranked 10th is the paperless technology, someone proposed with the use of &quot;electronic paper&quot; that can be repeated to replace traditional paper. Whether it is a newspaper or news stories can be displayed in the same piece of electronic paper to avoid wasting paper.

Although it can be used by minority teams or under the friendly match mode, this demo at least completely show us the advancement of new production’s graphics and system. Perspective on the current demo, it is no doubt worth the wait.Why the Most Expensive <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy52b2d1ZXNob3dzLmNvbS8_" target="_blank">fashion jewelry</a> in Fall are So Strange?
<br /><br />&quot;Live 2008&quot; is undoubtedly a failure and &quot;Live 2009&quot; is more of a correction of an error, and see &quot;Live 2010&quot; is the real standard currently. First of all, on the interface, Soccer Scene 2010 has remarkable change, this modernization, fashionable design style has attempted since 2008, and it can say that it has been obvious as the closer of FIFA series in 2010. It abandons the system of vertical menu, and uses more impressive background color. The sound continues the style of last two versions. Because the Master League mode can not be entered at present,it is not clear what the structure of the interface of the next level will be. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy52b2d1ZXNob3dzLmNvbS8_" target="_blank">fashion jewelry</a> , Most Attractive Buys for Female
<br /><br />But from the friendly mode, surely that it will not be a small change. The presentation on the formation,points and tactics is similar to the previous ones,but the content has greatly changed and the expressions are more vivid. Particularly with the icon added in the tactical part ,it is more intuitive. But the contents of tactics have big changes, adding total soccer and removing left, right and centre attack. Another player can adjust the station of crew the distance and rob the strength of force around. These changes made the tactical level to be more enrich, but to the performance of the players' ability value. Intuitive graphical overview was canceled, and the data view seems have some awkward; so the old players have to adapt to it for a period of time
<br /><br />In short, the demo demonstrates that the “Pro Evolution Soccer 2010&quot; has made much improvements in the system, and basically eradicates some previous doubts of the players. If improvements on the Master League, etc are as reasonable as enough in the official version, I believe that the &quot;Pro Evolution Soccer 2010&quot; will be the best one among the latest three generations of versions.

Talking about an obsolete joke which convulsed with laughter for lover, watching his favorite newspapers and magazines, cut out the article which he likes to give him.
<br /><br />The expression of love is to show your heart to your lover, and let the lover see your love, warm feeling, remembrance and touch. To ordinary people, it should be conducted plainly, carefully and lastingly, which is more suitable to our real life. &quot;I Love You&quot; is the best words in the world. &quot;I Love You&quot; between lovers, is often the beginning of love heating up.

<br /><br />Not long after Sony promoted the thinnest VAIO-X series of notebook computer in the world, this record is broken again by Dell who has always been famous for its network distribution as well as high ratio of performance to price. This really changes people’s ideas. The type of Adamo XPS of Dell wins the laurel of the thinnest laptop in the world with its definite advantage of the thickness, 9.99 mm. Adamo XPS notebook computer does the creative design on many aspects, breaking the expression Dell’s productions leave in people’s heart. Firstly, Adamo XPS’s appearance adopts pure aluminum alloy, being able to enhance the whole machine’s structure strength. Its delicate sanding makes its touching feeling very excellent, the original metal color of aluminum alloy showing the style of king. If remove the LOGO in the screen roof of Adamo XPS which thickness is only 9.99mm, it will just like a large piece of metal material mouse pad. Besides, the edge of it has been dealt with so smoothly that you can not find edges and corners, thus taking on not only a beautiful image but also an advantage of preventing from the unexpected shaving in the process of carrying. The traditional computer's under half body and upper half screen are quite normal. But the special Adamo XPS has narrowed the keyboard and body as much as possible. Various stretching junctions of the body, battery and so on are all fixed around the frame of the screen. In addition, the screen applying the technology of LED aphototropism just occupies a portion of thickness.Want to Know Demeanours that Have Injure to ? Here It Is!
<br /><br />The remaining thickness can hold the thin keyboard and the host body inside, so the thickness of the notebook screen is the thickness of the notebook. According to its own structure, it moves the spin axis at the edge of past notebook computer’s screen up. Below the spin axis is the battery of Adamo XPS. Also, you can set up the keyboard after turning on the screen, which can generate a certain angle, more comfortable than the keyboard of traditional notebook computer. Because after taking on it, the screen frame naturally becomes the fulcrum of the whole laptop, it is added with anti-skidding rubber around the edge. Where the keyboard and outer screen frame touches, the rubber is also applied, and the design in detail is fabulous all the same.The notebook computer’s screen can be turned on in a very special way: sliding your fingers, the guiding light shinning, the lock being opened, and then the screen bouncing. All the operations are accomplished at one go. Since then, turning on the screen has become a kind of enjoyment. At the rim of the screen's top cover, there is a groove with the capacitive touch-sensing function. When the finger slide here, the blue light on the edge will light one by one with the direction of finger sliding, as if the light in front of Knight Rider car, the effect is stunning. Then the two lock on the laptop keyboard corner will automatically unlock and the screen can be opened with one hand, with sci-fi features.
<br /><br />However, it is worthy of notice that if you want to open the completely closed screen of notebook computer, you should make sure that it has been electrified or the battery has electricity. Otherwise, it is impossible to turn it open, for it needs electronic support. Of course, it is meaningless to turn it on without electric. Firstly, because of the special body structure design, the lifted notebook keyboard has angle, if you want to adjust the angle of the keyboard, the angle of the screen will change too. And the screen has low see lever problem, so we must choose between a suitable keyboard angel or a see leve. The most of us choose good screen angel instead of keyboard comfortable angel. Secondly, the keycap of notebook keyboard has a metal cap that match with full aluminum body, and then surface have brushed treatment and feels very good, which also more highlight the extraordinary orientation of notebook. But the keyboard has not lighting design, and there is no secondary anchor position between the letters F and J, so it will have little effect on type if you are used to type without a look or type in the low light conditions.

The 500 biggest companies have to strengthen themselves to become the really 500 most powerful companies. We can’t lag behind in face of so many challenges. Being stronger and being bigger is the same to business, they both have two purposes, one is to defeat the others to survive, the other is to make money. Making money and surviving in the business is the driving force for company to be big and strong, and it is internal logic for the company to develope market. Based on logics of the market, we will understand the market behaviors of the companies and foresee the prospects of them.Why Pick <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy52b2d1ZXNob3dzLmNvbS8_" target="_blank">fashion jewelry</a> for PRs
<br /><br />With the &quot;industrial revolution&quot;,capitalist enterprises begin to open &quot;world market&quot;, thereby becoming transnational enterprises. The capitalist enterprises could obtain raw materials, markets and excess profits from the area that was in the handicraft stage. The capital would flow to the places possessing high profits. There are a lot of things to learn to for our companies going global and developing ourselves by taking advantages of the global market.The Advantages of <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy52b2d1ZXNob3dzLmNvbS8_" target="_blank">fashion clothing</a> You May Not Know

In this case, If Chinese enterprises &quot;go outside further&quot; will be on the contrary to the logic of the market. It does not meet the features of capital and enterprises.
<br /><br />From the development history of the world's enterprises, in the beginning growth of multinational corporations, they will go abroad and go to the world market. To become bigger and stronger can be done at the same time. The domestic market is not their Tender Land, and they regard the world market as their Tender Land on contrary. Vice versa, the enterprises in China see the domestic market as the source of their honey and the global market as their nightmare. Internationalization of Chinese capital and Chinese enterprises, has become a logical paradox. Government can not change the characteristics of the capital, officials can not overturn the logic of the market. The Chinese companies have to walk out of the ‘nursery” and extricate themselves from the strange circle of the logics of the market from the domestic market if they want to become powerful though globalization.
<br /><br />At present, main bottleneck for Chinese enterprises ging out, first, we acquire experience abroad is not sufficient. Take the acquisition of Rio Tinto by China Aluminum, there was always a slip between the cup and the lip, and it was even tricked by the Rio Tinto. We are at a transitional period for multinationals, facing opportunity to become global with the ever increase of the foreign reserve and the company strength. Enterprises nowadays are only strong at home. They are not strong in other countries. What we need to do is to train our own transantional talents and increase our experience in contacting international enterprises. Second, compared with the global top 500 corporations, our companies are short of veteran personnel who are familiar with financial and capital operation. Therefore, against the background of globalization, only by means of understanding the operation of overseas finance and capital can we make our companies bigger and stronger

The New <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy52b2d1ZXNob3dzLmNvbS8_" target="_blank">fashion shoes</a> for Summer Especially recently, the Japanese First Life Insurance’s a forecast report show that, Japan will carry the total debt about 950 trillion yen in 2001, it will be for the year 200% of GDP. Japan may run into national bankruptcy since they can`t bear the so high deficit and collapse the debt bubble, which will be a big bomb during the wordwide.3 Deportments that May Bring Dirtiness to Your Remarkable <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy52b2d1ZXNob3dzLmNvbS8_" target="_blank">fashion jewelry</a> 
<br /><br />Will Japan become the next Greece? Behind Japanese debt crisis, what’s relevant to the macroeconomic policy? It’s well worth thinking about. Since Keynes established the classic western economics, the theme which determined the macroeconomics on the total output or total income has split into two parts: the first part is to explain why the cyclical recession and expansion will occur in the short term. The second part is to explain how the level of potential output growth will increase. The outbreak of 2008 Financial Crisis made Japan be mired in recession, in order to deal with the crisis, Japan carried an unprecedented economic stimulus plan, increased to borrow money. However, the large-scale expansionary fiscal policy has made the time-honored financial vulnerabilities increasingly prominent, leading to an increasing accumulation of sovereignty and debt risk. Since the outbreak of the financial crisis, Japan has introduced four consecutive stimulus plans, which has expensed 75 trillion yen.Bewitching <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy52b2d1ZXNob3dzLmNvbS8_" target="_blank">fashion jewelry</a> for the Lowest Prices
<br /><br />In the progress when the real economy ran into recession, private department shrinked credit and demand, the public department carried out anti-periodic policy to stop the impact during the recession induced by declined output, credit crunch and capital price reduced, it really works to shorten the period of recession. But the huge negative stand out; it just like the goverment get all the risks which were widely distributed in different economies like financial institute,the seperate debt risks turn up to government sovereign capital debt risk, its direct result is deficit level and its financing cost rise up, public capital debt table keeps deflation. Different from other countries, Japan deficit is accumulated, it has not only periodic deficit but also structural deficit, these deficit and debt are relevant with the deficit finance, once the expansionary fiscal policy becomes chronic, it will cause serious economical result.
<br /><br />The long-drawn-out financial stimulus plans go beyond the limits of Japanese government, it doesn’t only failed to achieve the desired objectives, but also cause the serious “crowding out effect” on private investment. The real GDP and potential GDP(the GDP by fully use a country`s capacity) gap remains high, which leads to the lower OPW. Meanwhile it will worsen the fiscal situation and expand the national debt. As the Japanese government deficit or through tax financing or through debt financing, or through the central bank increased the money supply. It’s not difficult to understand why Japan has been plunged into a debt—based deflation these years.
<br /><br />Japanese debt is really the most serious among the developed countries. If we look at the total debt proportion in GDP. Japan had reached a record 871.5 trillion yen in 2009, accounting for GDP174%, the highest in the OECD. Owing to the increasing rate of debt is faster than that of economy recovery and personal asset increases slowly, the rate of Japanese residents’ saving had been declined to 3.3% in 2008, from 10.5% in 1998. International Monetary Fund (IMF) expects that it’s inevitable that the rate of Japanese saving transform from positive to negative in years, and the gap between assets and debts would be larger and larger.
<br /><br />Japan`s debt trouble remind us to think over the anti-crisis system, deficit finance has short term functional effect as a demand management policy. Deficit financing is unfit to be long-term. Once expansionary fiscal policy becomes long-term, it will cause a serious economic consequence, weakening the regulating function of fiscal policy. In the long term, in order to fundamentally overcome the economic downturn, the traditional demand management should be turned into supply management policies which will promote long-term growth, to improve the flawed economic structure and to seek new economic development method between stimulating economic growth and balancing the economy.

<br /><br />Security man Anthony at the entrance stopped the old and the young.&quot;Welcome. Please show me your invitation cards.Thank you.&quot;Anthony said. “Sorry, we are not invited. She wants to come, so I come with her.” The old lady answered while caressing the girl’s head. “I’m very sorry, except workers, you can not be in without invitation cards.” Anthony said. “Why? Is this place holding a charity banquet? We come to show our heart, is this impossible?”
<br /><br />The old woman was very serious, “ Cute little Lucy knew from the TV that there will be a charity activities here. She wants to do something for the poor kids and she decides to can take out all the money in her money pot.” Anthony explained: yes, there be a charity dinner here. People invited were all important persons and they will help the Afican children with money generously. Anthony stopped for a moment and said:&quot;I am pleasure you come here with your love.

Then he straightened up and took out an invitation to Antony: “Can I bring her in?” Antony took over the invitation, had a look and saluted to the old man: “Of course, warrant, Mr. Buffet.”
<br /><br />The main character in today’s charity evening banquet is not the proponent Annan, not Buffet who contributed 3000000 dollars, not Bill Gates who donated 8000000, but the little Lucy who donated only 30 dollar and 25 pence. And the slogan of the dinner was changed into &quot;Charity: the donation of kindness, not money.&quot; On the next day, American media all take this slogan as the title in the report about this dinner. After seeing the reports, many ordinary Americans said that they would donate to those poor children in Africa.
