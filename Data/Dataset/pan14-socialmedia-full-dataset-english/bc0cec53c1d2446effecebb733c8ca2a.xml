<br /><br />1. It is comparatively easy to paint this squirrel. First paint the head with dark ink.The brushwork follows the red arrow.
<br /><br />2. Fill the brush's belly with light ink,then dip the tip into dark ink. Paint the squirrel's back in one stroke, producing dark and light shades in one stroke. Then paint the squirrel's legs with light ink.
<br /><br />3. Paint the squirrel's tail and belly with cyanine mixed with light ink.
<br /><br />4. Finally, outline the eyes, head and claws with dark ink. Paint the little pine nuts in bright red mixed with carmine.When the nuts are partially dry, paint the nut thorns with dark ink. Colour the squirrel's face with gamboge.
<br /><br />These two pictures of little squirrels differ from the picture above. They were painted mainly by rubbing horizontally with a dry brush with ochre mixed with a combination of dark ink. When rubbing the squirrel's tail, you can make textural wrinkles and rub horizontally with a wornout brush over and over again, making the fur look fluffy. Try it.

<br /><br /><span class="textAlign textAlignCenter"> <img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/184531133_3004703_49822961.jpg" /></span>
<br /><br />Traditional Chinese painting is China's traditional art with unique national characteristics. It uses brush, ink stick, ink slab,paper and pigment to depict both realistic and imaginary Objects. Since it uses mainly water and ink to paint on paper, it is also called ink-and-wash painting. With its unique technique and style, it forms anindependent art in the world, on a par with oil painting in the West.
<br /><br />Traditional Chinese painting can be traced back to the primitive society of five thousand years ago. The superb linear art appearing on protoceramic objects represents the embryo of traditional Chinese painting. Later, after constant innovation and development over several thousand years, today's brilliant era of traditional Chinese painting came into being.
<br /><br />Traditional Chinese painting pays great attention to presenting the essence of objects, stressing the beauty of form and requiring pictures to &quot;capture both spirit  and form&quot; and to &quot;be replete with vitality and rhythm.&quot; Moreover, it emphasizes the  organic combination of literature, calligraphy, seal engraving and painting. All traditional Chinese painting blends poetry, calligraphy, painting and seal engraving into one indivisible artistic whole.
<br /><br />2. Form and Content of Traditional Chinese Painting
<br /><br /><span class="textAlign textAlignCenter"> <img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/184531133_2837896_49822974.jpg" /></span>
<br /><br />The principal forms of traditional Chinese painting are hanging scroll, album of paintings, fan an album of paintings the artist paints on a certain size of xuan paper, then binds a number of paintings into an album, convenient for storage.The surface of both folding fans and round fans is painted. Before people had electric fans or air-conditioning, they used fans made of bamboo strips pasted with paper or silk. Artists painted the fan's surface as recreation. In time this developed into a form of painting that has been handed down to the present. Folding fans, usually made of paper, are used by men, while round fans, generally of silk, are used by women. When artists paint on the silk, the fan appears fine and elegant. The long horizontal scroll is also called a hand scroll.It is less than fifty centimetres high, but several to a hundred metres long. Pictures on long horizontal scrolls are not restricted as to time, whether seasons or decades. A hundred or a thousand human figures can be portrayed in one painting. After being mounted, it can be appreciated section by section. Riverside Scene at Qingming Festival (Qingming Festival, when Chinese people visit ancestral tombs, falls on April 5 or 6 each year) is a famous horizontal scroll from the Song Dynasty (960--1279). The painting is 52.5 centimetres long.
<br /><br />Traditional Chinese paintings can be classified according to subject matter into figure paintings, landscapes and flower-and-bird paintings. Landscapes represent a major category in traditional Chinese painting, mainly depicting the natural  scenery of mountains and rivers.

		<document id="dc4b9a894080ed073404822ffa5e952e" url=""><![CDATA[Notable Masterpieces--from 10th century to 1354<br/><br/>Chinese landscape painting emerged before the Christian era and has undergone a long process of development. Instead of going deep into historical research, I have included some landscape masterworks. They are arranged chronologically, thus giving the reader a rough picture of the development. Please note that there are too many masters and masterpieces for us to present them all here in this book. To have a better understanding of Chinese landscape, I recommend that you read more books on the subject. 
<br /><br /><span class="textAlign textAlignCenter"><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/184531133_9242231_49855553.jpg" /></span> 
<br /><br />Kuanglu Mountain by Jing Hao (active during the 10th century)
<br /><br />The painting shows the grandeur of the Kuanglu Mountain (present-day Lushan Mountain in central China) with clouds and mist hovering among its peaks. The artist Jing Hao summed up the experiences of earlier landscape artists and created his own personal style -- noted for the wide panoramic view and the use of ink strokes as the main means of expression. 
<br /><br />XiaoxiangRiver (detail) by Dong Yuan (d. circa AD 962)
<br /><br />Dong Yuan, a native of Nanjing, learnt blue-and-green landscape in his youth. Later he used ink strokes as the main mode of expression and painted long, thin and smooth strokes to shade rocks. His texture-strokes were painted like hemp-fibres followed by ink strokes on wet colour washes. With dots added, his landscapes portray the grace of southern China. Art historians characterise his works as exhibiting hills and mountains veiled by mist, bridges over streams with islets -- all typical scenes in the south. This painting was executed with indigo and ink, with light ink dots on the hilltops suggesting the moist air of South China.
<br /><br />Travelling in Mountains by Fan Kuan (active 10th century)
<br /><br />Fan Kuan is the style name of Fan Zhongzheng (alternatively named Fan Zhongli), whose dates are unknown. &quot;Kuan&quot; in Chinese means &quot;broad-minded&quot; which described his personality, hence the appellation. One of the leading landscape artists of his time, he spent a long time studying nature and portraying different seasons. His paintings, usually of large size, are noted for towering rocks standing by rivers, and dense primitive forests on mountaintops. He liked to use dots to shade rocks. Few paintings of the 10th century are extant today but connoisseurs believe this is an authentic piece by Fan Kuan. The picture shows a scene in the region that is the present-day central Shaanxi near Xi'an. The towering peaks in a frontal view with exuberant trees are imposing. The light shade at the foot of the mountains provides an illusion of air. Fan Kuan' s paintings are noted for vigorous brushwork and dark ink. 
<br /><br /><span class="textAlign textAlignCenter"><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/184531133_4059296_49855574.jpg" /></span> 
<br /><br />Rocks Against Horizon by Guo Xi (c. 1023 - c.1085)
<br /><br />Guo Xi was a favourite of the emperor. It was said that most paintings hanging in the imperial palace were his works. He was against following well trodden paths in art and advocated artistic creation by drawing inspiration from different masters and from the observation of life. He put forward the three ways to display distant views in landscape. This painting shows huge rocks against the horizon. His strokes are mostly centre-tip and side-tip brushwork in light ink. 
<br /><br />Thousand Miles of Landscape (details) by Wang Ximeng (12th century)
<br /><br />Wang Ximeng was a great master of blue-and-green landscape. His dates are unknown, but we do know he worked for the emperor during the reign of Zhenghe (1111-1118). Historical documents say that he was once taught by the artist-emperor, but this prodigious artist died young. This is the only extant work attributed to him. 
<br /><br />Walking While Singing by Ma Yuan (12-13th century)
<br /><br />The exact dates of this artist are unknown, but we do know that he served in the imperial painting academy during the period 1190-1224. The all-around master Ma Yuan excelled in landscape, human figure and bird-and-flower paintings. A salient feature of his landscape work was breaking with the earlier tradition of panoramic views. In his painting he focused on one aspect of nature and for this he acquired the nickname &quot;One Corner Ma&quot; (ma yijiao). This style exerted a great influence on later artists. He liked to use large axe-cut strokes to depict rocks and was also good at portraying water. His &quot;Walking While Singing&quot; shows drunken farmers and children playing along a path. The peaks in the background are steep and rocks are depicted with long, forceful and angular strokes. The mist and clouds veiling part of trees set off the light and space in the sky. This painting impresses viewers with its forceful brushwork and graceful images. 
<br /><br />Serene Mountains and River (details) by Xia Gui (12-13th century)
<br /><br />Xia Gui, whose exact dates are also unknown, may have lived a little later than Ma Yuan. He served in the imperial painting academy between AD 1195 and 1224. He excelled in both landscape and human figure. He loved to depict rivers in wind, rain, snow and mist in southern China. He produced many extraordinarily long scrolls. His &quot;Serene Mountains and River&quot; is a 33-metre horizontal scroll. Xia Gui's style is akin to that of Ma Yuan, and both artists had a propensity for simple composition and long axe-cut strokes. But Xia's landscapes have a milder tone than Ma's -- while Ma Yuan outlined tree leaves, Xia Gui depicted his tree leaves with dots. He also loved to apply texture-strokes with a blunt brush and to add ink marks on the texture-strokes, thus achieving a brilliant symphony of wet and dry, dark and light. The &quot;Serene Mountains and River&quot; displays a brilliant scene with an expanse of water in the background and mountains in the foreground. The light strokes on the trees give a feeling of air and space. The neat and fresh brushwork impresses the viewer with a beauty contained in simplicity. 
<br /><br />Autumn in Queshan and HuashanMountains (detail) by Zhao Mengfu (1254-1322)
<br /><br />This artist was one of the most influential calligraphers and painters during the reign of the Mongols in China. He had two important views. One was that good art must possess &quot;ancient flavours&quot; and the other, that brushwork used in painting and calligraphy is the same. His theory encouraged artistic creation by copying ancient works. But on the other hand he also stressed artwork as an expression of nature. His works appear in various guises -- some of his landscapes are very sketchy, but his human figures and horses are meticulously executed and brilliantly coloured. The &quot;Autumn in Queshan and Huashan Mountains&quot; is a magnum opus of Zhao. 
<br /><br />Dwelling in the FuchunMountains (detail) by Huang Gongwang (1269-1354)
<br /><br />Huang Gongwang once served in the government as a minor clerk but was later prosecuted and thrown into prison. Upon being freed, he returned home and concentrated all his efforts on landscape painting. He sat amongst rocks in the woods for a whole day, observing nature and often sketched from life. Huang used dry texture-strokes and skimming strokes. He inherited the tradition of landscape ink painting from former masters and strove to achieve variation in brushwork. He applied a light red colour to his landscape and this format was later known as the &quot;light-red landscape&quot;. The scroll, 33 cm in height and 670 cm in length, displays hamlets and forests in spring along the Fuchun River. The wet hemp-fibre stroke, long and short dry strokes mixed with wet dots make the painting an epitome of varied brushwork. On the other hand, too much attention focused on brushwork tends to reduce the natural appeal of the spring sight.

<br /><br />Village fairs have a long history in China. During a fair, the villagers offer sacrifices to gods, take part in cultural activities and shop at market stalls.

<br /><br />Professor at the Central Institute of Arts and Crafts  Member of the Chinese Artists'Association
<br /><br />Fine brushwork painters are very few because it is difficult to do it well, but it is the essence of traditional Chinese paintings and is a much loved art form. For this reason, it is important for me to keep going so that I can play my small part in the development of the art.
<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL29yaWVudGFsLmNtcy55ejExMy5jb20vaHRtbC8yMDExLzExLzIwMTExMTE0MDkzOTAwNTExLmh0bWw_" target="_blank"><span class="textAlign" style="text-align: right;"><strong>More&gt;&gt;</strong></span></a>

When you paint a line, all your fingers should work in coordination. The thumb, forefinger and middle finger hold the brush shaft, the ring finger pushes the brush shaft outwards and the little finger reinforces the ring finger. 
<br /><br /><span class="textAlign textAlignCenter"><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/184531133_13568710_49866413.jpg" /></span> 
<br /><br />Today nearly all Chinese calligraphers stress that the brush must be held vertically. But I recommend that the brush be kept in an 80-degree angle with the paper. This will help you keep the brush tip at the centre of the stroke it produces. A stroke produced this way is called &quot;centre-tip&quot; stroke (zhongfeng). 
<br /><br />A stroke produced by keeping the brush tip at one side of the stroke is called &quot;side-tip stroke&quot; (cefeng). In doing a side-tip stroke, the brush shaft is usually held at a slant. Sometimes even the root of the brush touches the paper to produce rough, ragged marks. Such strokes play an important role in landscape. 
<br /><br />The brush may be moved in forward or reverse directions: i.e., you can &quot;pull&quot; the brush along or &quot;push&quot; it against the direction of the tip. The turning of a stroke may be round or angular. 
<br /><br />Sometimes you will need to press your brush down onto the paper or raise it from the paper, thus making part of your stroke different from others. 
<br /><br />The fibres in the brush should generally be kept adjacent to each other to form a good point, but for a particular effect the fibres may be made to spread loosely. Strokes executed by spreading fibres often serve special purposes. 
<br /><br /><span class="textAlign textAlignCenter"><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/184531133_12499423_49866434.jpg" /></span> 
<br /><br />Control the brush but do not be controlled by the brush.  Because the tip of a Chinese brush is much softer than that of an oil painting brush, a beginner may find it difficult to achieve desired strokes. It takes some time to learn to control the brush. If you do not exert yourself to the command of your brush but instead take any stroke your brush produces, you are at mercy of your brush and you will never achieve desired brushwork! 
<br /><br /><span class="textAlign textAlignCenter"><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/184531133_11439987_49866457.jpg" /></span> 
<br /><br />&quot;Strength&quot; in brushwork. Forceful strokes are appreciated in Chinese painting. The &quot;strength&quot; of brushwork does not mean a great physical effort. Instead, it is an outcome of a long training. When we view a painting of Peter Rubens, we are not only impressed by the beautiful images in the painting, but are fascinated with his powerful brushwork as well. Compare an original masterpiece in a museum with a copy on sale in a roadside shop and you will notice the difference between them: they bear like images, but the brushwork in the copy is much &quot;weaker&quot; than that in the original. Although a clear-cut definition of strong and weak brushwork is not available, as you view more Chinese paintings and compare different works, you will learn to discern the &quot;strength&quot; contained in brushwork, just as it is not difficult for you to tell the footprints of a firm and steady walker from those of a drunkard or one with a limp. 
<br /><br />Powerful brushwork is achievable through practice. The key to success is always keeping in your mind the strokes you are aiming at and how you will achieve them (keeping the tip at the centre or one side of your stroke, pressing or raising the brush, moving the brush quickly or slowly, &quot;pulling&quot; or &quot;pushing&quot; your brush etc.). 
<br /><br />Shades of ink. In Chinese painting ink plays a more important role than colour. A painting can be executed without colour but cannot be without ink. By adding water, ink can be diluted into different shades: dark, black, light or pale. The extreme dry ink is called dried-up ink (jiaomo). This ink is produced by grinding an ink stick on an ink stone until the liquid is thick and dry. Bottled ink does not have this grade of darkness. So if you want to get dried-up ink using a bottled ink, you must put the ink into an ink stone and grind an ink stick into it.
<br /><br />You can put further ink strokes on dry ink marks. This technique is called multilayer or accumulated ink (jimo). If you put ink strokes on wet ink, this technique is called wet-on-wet ink (pòmo).   
<br /><br />Oversaturated brushwork is called splash-ink (p?mo). (Note: the Chinese for wet-on-wet is &quot;pòmo&quot;, with &quot;po&quot; in falling tone and splash-ink, &quot;p?mo&quot;, with &quot;po&quot; in flat tone. In Chinese language each syllable is tonal. In English a syllable may be accented or unaccented.) Apart from splashing ink, you can also splash colour. Texture-stroke (cun) and skimming stroke (ca). Texture- strokes are made using repeated side-tip strokes in light ink to represent the surface of a rock or tree trunk. If the stroke is dry and loose so that the traces of brushwork are invisible, this is called a skimming stroke.

<br /><br />The Summer Palace, located in the northwestern suburbs of Beijing, was originally a resort for the emperors of&quot; the Qing Dynasty to escape the capital's summer heat. The Park of Clear Ripple was built in the 15th year (1750) of the reign of Emperor Qianlong by skilled craftsmen from the country and at an enormous cost. Destroyed by the British and French allied forces in the 14th year (1860) of the reign of Emperor Xianfeng, it was rebuilt by Empress Dowager Cixi in the 141h year (1888) of the reign of Emperor Guangxu, and its name was changed to Summer Palace.
<br /><br /><span class="textAlign textAlignCenter"><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/184531133_7142851_49867039.jpg" /></span>
<br /><br />With an area of approximately 2.9 million sq m, the Summer Palace is mainly composed of the palace area, Longevity Hill and Kunming Lake, characterized by both the natural beauty of lakes and mountains and meticulously laid-out flower gardens. There are over 3,000 buildings in various styles in the park. With the Western Hills and the Jade Spring Hilt as the background, the buildings merge harmoniously with the landscape, and so the Summer Palace is rated as a model of Chinese landscape art. 
<br /><br /><span class="textAlign textAlignCenter"><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/184531133_3935611_49867052.jpg" /></span>
<br /><br />Its close connection with Empress Dowager Cixi and Emperor Guangxu bound the Summer Palacemodern history of China. It was opened to the public as a park in 1924.

<br /><br />The Three Parallel Rivers natural scenic area covers an area of 41,000 sq km and consists of the Nujiang, Lancang and Jinsha rivers and the mountains at their basins. It is located in the rift valley of the Hengduan Mountains, which are part of the southern extension of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Being a place where the three geographical regions of East Asia, South Asia and the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau meet, alpine landforms and their development can be seen, making it an unusual area. It is also one of the world's richest areas for species of fauna and flora. Home to 16 nationalities, it is also an unusual area because so many different nationalities, languages, religions and customs coexist there.

<br /><br />Guqin music includes great achievements in Chinese instrumental music. The zither-like instrument is one of the world's earliest stringed musical instruments still extant, with a history of about 3,000 years. The art of the guqin consists of the manufacture of the instrument and its strings, the scores, music, history, songs, societies and schools. It has had a wide influence on China's musical, aesthetic, socio cultural and philosophical history. The guqin is a representative of ancient Chinese spiritual culture in music.

In this chapter, we will introduce Chu Suiliang and Yan Zhenqing, the two leaders of the trend in calligraphy trend at that time. In the early years of the Tang Dynasty, there were four famous calligraphers: Ouyang Xun, Yu Shinan, Chu Suiliang and Xue Ji, in order of their ages.
<br /><br /><span class="textAlign textAlignCenter"> <img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/184531133_5120019_49894904.jpg" /></span>
<br /><br />Chu Suiliang (596-658) was once an official of the imperial court, and wrote the draft declaration made by Emperor Taizong when he abdicated in favor of his son. When the new emperor, Gaozong, married Wu Zetian, one of his father's concubines, Chu protested, and was exiled from the capital.
<br /><br />Chu studied the calligraphic styles of Ouyang Xun and Wang Xizhi, and the Han official script. He combined all these into a new type of script, abandoning the &quot;silkworm's head&quot; and &quot;wild goose's tail.&quot; His calligraphic style underwent three major changes. The Preface to Tripitake is one of his masterpieces. Written in the regular script, the characters are thin and smooth, but powerful. It became fashionable to copy his handwriting, and he himself was praised as a calligraphy master of the Tang Dynasty.
<br /><br />Yan Zhenqing (708-784) was born into an aristocratic family. His grandfather and paternal uncle were calligraphers, and instilled a love of calligraphy into him. Yan passed the highest imperial examination and became an official for a time. His powerful and vigorous handwriting in the regular or running scripts reflect his lofty moral character.
<br /><br />At first, Yan copied Chu's style, and later Wang Xizhi's. He finally developed a powerful, fantastic and beautiful style, which was in harmony with the flourishing culture of the powerful Tang Dynasty. His style has been enthusiastically followed by later generations.
<br /><br />Here we should introduce Liu Gongquan (778-865) who was born 70 years later, and became as famous as Yan, whose style he studied.
<br /><br />Liu Gongquan received encouragement from several emperors, who were his patrons. Liu's characters are powerful, vigorous and smooth, and the strokes extend outward. He is famous for his command of tension and the cohesion of his ink. Like Yan's, Liu's calligraphy has been copied widely by people of later generations.
<br /><br />Rigor is the most important characteristic of the calligraphers of the Tang Dynasty. The Tang style is quite different from that of the Jin Dynasty, which is elegant, graceful, unrestrained and beautiful, while that of the Tang Dynasty is strict and neat, and easy to learn. From the Tang Dynasty on.

A local colour is free from the influence of light and shade. However, this colour is not copied from nature. Instead, it is a bold subjective reflection based on the artist's individual perception. Ink plays the predominant part and colours work in concert with the ink. The colours should not conceal the ink; nor should the ink disturb the colours. The enchanting skills of brushwork and ink application make the colour in Chinese painting splendid, graceful and simple all at the same time.
<br /><br /><span class="textAlign textAlignCenter"><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/184531133_15986303_49894952.jpg" /> </span>
<br /><br />A Chinese landscape painting may be in one of the three tones: light red, blue-and-green and golden-and-green. All of them are coloured using similar procedures:
<br /><br />1. Apply ink before colour. Light colouration is only applied when rocks, trees, houses, boats and other objects have been depicted in ink and the ink painting is complete. 
<br /><br />2. Paint trees before rocks. Landscape accessories are coloured last.   
<br /><br />3. Apply warm colours (red, ochre, orange, yellow, etc.) before cool colours (blue, green, etc.). Apply ochre before indigo and green.
<br /><br />4. Apply vegetable colours layer after layer. If the colour is not dark enough, add another layer. Repeat this procedure until the colour is in the right tone. 
<br /><br />5. Apply the last coating at one go. The final coating of stone colour (azurite, malachite or cinnabar) should be applied only once. 
<br /><br />6. At the final stage, dots in stone colours are added on treetops and rocks in the painting.
<br /><br />Light red landscape (qianjiang shanshui). Also known as ink-and-wash landscape. This type of landscape, simple and graceful yet realistic, is executed mainly with ink, plus a little ochre and indigo. The colouring procedure is:
<br /><br />1. Apply ink first.    
<br /><br />2. Apply vegetable colours repeatedly until the desired tone is achieved; always put new layers when the former coating has become dry.    
<br /><br />3. The light sides of rocks are painted with ochre and the dark sides are coloured with indigo.    
<br /><br />4. Tree trunks and boughs are shown with light ochre.    
<br /><br />5. The leaves are painted with green or indigo. Usually the trees should be in stronger tone than mountains.    
<br /><br />Stones in light red landscape can be coloured in four ways (in all cases colours are added after the ink marks are finished and dry):
<br /><br />1. add colour to the light side with ochre or ochre mixed with ink;    
<br /><br />2. add colour to the dark side with ochre; when the colour is dry, add ochre mixed with ink;    
<br /><br />3. paint and colour the light side with ochre and the dark side with ink mixed with ochre; or    
<br /><br />4. add colour to the light side with ochre and colour the dark side with indigo. 
<br /><br /><span class="textAlign textAlignCenter"><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/184531133_11502834_49894984.jpg" /></span> 
<br /><br />Blue-and-green landscape (qinglü shanshui). There are two subgenera: the lesser blue-and-green landscape and greater blue-green landscape.    
<br /><br />The lesser blue-and-green landscape is a development of the light red landscape, adding malachite shades over the herbal green and thus enforcing the overall tone of green. To set off the green, the bare rock cliffs and beaches are coloured with ochre.
<br /><br />Greater blue-and-green landscape is quite different from the lesser blue-and-green landscape.
<br /><br />To add colour to this type of landscape --
<br /><br />? paint the background with vegetable colours
<br /><br />? apply mineral colours
<br /><br />? finally, re-contour stones with colour lines. Colour dots are added at this stage. 
<br /><br />Gold-and-Green landscape jinbi shanshui. This splendid and grand subgenus is rather decorative. It is executed the same way as the greater blue-and-green landscape, but in the last procedure, the outlines and strata of the rocks are painted with golden lines. Note that a gold-and-green landscape is usually painted on sized silk or paper. 
<br /><br />Clouds are contoured in white. Rocks and cliffs are coloured with thick layers of paint. The top of each rock is coloured with cool colour and the bottom of each is painted with warm colour -- i.e, mountain tops are coloured with azurites, the middle part of mountains with malachite and the foot of mountains with ochre. Treetops are painted with indigo.
<br /><br />Trees. Unlike trees in bird-and-flower painting, in landscapes they are coloured in accordance with the environment. Generally, tree trunks are painted with ochre. Leaves are coloured with indigo or herbal green (mixture of indigo and rattan yellow). Pink flowers (peach blossom) and white flowers (pear blossom) are both painted with white on different grounds. The ground for the former is crimson and that for the latter is herbal green. Roots of trees are not usually colour washed but have a secondary outline in light ochre. 
<br /><br />Colouring trunks.
<br /><br /><span class="textAlign textAlignCenter"><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/184531133_9153541_49895009.jpg" /></span>
<br /><br />1. Add ochre to the ink strokes. When the ochre is dry, add ink mixed with ochre on both sides of the trunk so as to reinforce its volume value. 
<br /><br />2. Firs and cassia are coloured in the same way as the pine.
<br /><br />3. Some trunks are outlined. Just add ochre lines over the ink ones. 
<br /><br />4. To colour branches executed in ink, ochre strokes can be added on top of the ink.
<br /><br />If leaves are outlined, apply a ground wash with indigo, herbal green, rouge, crimson or light ochre before filling in the outlines with azurites, malachites, cinnabar or mineral yellow. 
<br /><br />Pines can be painted in ink and coloured with indigo (upper left). Azurite dots can be added to ink dots (upper second from the right). Willow branches can be coloured with herbal green (rattan yellow mixed with indigo) (upper right). Some outlined leaved may be coloured with herbal green and when the first layer of colour is dry, add malachite on the centre of each group of &quot;petals&quot; (lower left). 
<br /><br />Frost-bitten red leaves can be painted using ink mixed with carmine. When the lines are dry, add dots of cinnabar. The trunks can be over-painted with ochre. Peach blossoms can be painted with carmine. When the carmine is dry, add dots in thick white.
<br /><br />The underpainting of dotted green leaves is black green or grey green. The underpainting of yellow leaves is ochre yellow or deep yellow.

The correct method of holding the brush is: keep the fingers firm and the palm relaxed. The thumb presses the brush handle inward and the index finger presses it outward.Hold the fourth and little finger against the middle finger. Thus you will paint fairly flexibly.
<br /><br /><span class="textAlign textAlignCenter"><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/184531133_15534303_49905813.jpg" /></span> 
<br /><br />Using the brash:
<br /><br />The tip of the brush is where the hair is most pointed. There are six ways of using the brush:
<br /><br />1. Central brush-point technique: The brush handle is perpendicular to the paper. When drawing a line, you should keep the brush tip in the middle of the line.  
<br /><br />2. Side technique: In holding the brush, tilt the brush toward the paper. When drawing a line, keep the brush tip on one side of the line. 
<br /><br />3. Reversing the direction taken by the brush tip: Move the brush upward or toward the left. Though inconvenient when you paint in this way, your line will show richer variation.
<br /><br />4. Duo technique: This technique in freehand flower painting requires dipping the brush tip in ink or colours, very often one colour after another, so that one stroke can paint both dark and light colours.
<br /><br />5. Applying dots: Horizontal dots, vertical dots, round dots and slanting dots.
<br /><br />6. Turn and twist: Turn the brush tip inward and outward.

		<document id="4de8da9e3ebcd342f59bb688c34f814f" url=""><![CDATA[Conveying the Emotions of the Author<br/><br/>The calligrapher wants to express his personality, knowledge and sentiments through the characters on the paper, and tries to personify the characters.
<br /><br />To arouse the consciousness of life is a common function of all kinds of arts. Owing to its power to express the quality of the person and the correspondence of its rhythm with the rhythm of human emotion, calligraphy can arouse the strongest consciousness of life. In this aspect, only music can compare with calligraphy.
<br /><br />Romain Rolland, a French writer, said that when he talks about the quality of music, the most important things about music are to display the soul of the people and to expose the secret of inner life. First of all, music is about feelings and inner experience. Their emergence demands nothing but the soul and songs.
<br /><br /><span class="textAlign textAlignCenter"><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/184531133_3473596_49905859.jpg" /></span>
<br /><br />Chinese calligraphy, soundless music, can reflect the secrets hidden deep in the heart. People have different characters and are influenced by different historical periods. They learn calligraphic skills from different teachers, and have different educations. Thus, calligraphers write characters in different styles expressing their personal characters. This is reason for the frequent changes in the development of Chinese calligraphy.
<br /><br />The affection the calligrapher puts into strokes comes from three sources: his character, knowledge and sentiments. This chapter deals with one of these three sources.
<br /><br />Calligraphic works fall into two kinds: steadfast and soft. They are easy for the viewer to detect. Calligraphy critics mention them frequently, and they reflect the personality of calligrapher.     
<br /><br />Calligraphic works reflecting steadfastness are vigorous, powerful, fantastic,loose and magnificent. Some calligraphy critics comment that such works are as forceful as dragons and tigers, as quick as a warhorse charging, like a drawn sword or a bent bow, a giant with his fist crushing his opponent or a steep mountain cliff.
<br /><br />Calligraphic works reflecting the beauty of softness are delicate, elegant, warm and graceful. Some calligraphy critics compare them to beautiful women with flowers on their heads, dancers with delicate waists, warm and gentle spring breezes, and nice flowers and plants.
<br /><br />Various calligraphic scripts have steadfast and soft styles. The official and formal scripts demonstrate the steadfast and soft styles remarkably.  Following are two examples copied from stone inscriptions in official script.
<br /><br />Tablet to Zhang Qian, carved in 186, the last stage of the Eastern Han Dynasty,is powerful and vigorous. It contains 672 characters. The calligrapher purposely made the strokes look lofty. Each character seems to extend outward in order to look larger. The uneven strokes, thick right-falling strokes and the horizontal strokes with an upward end demonstrate bold and unrestrained features of writing. The square turning strokes illustrate firmand powerful features. The tablet is solemn, but solid; ponderous but proud. The calligrapher did not leave his name on it, but we can imagine that he was a courageous person. Today the tablet is housed in a temple in Tai'an, Shandong Province.
<br /><br />Tablet to Cao Quan, carved one year earlier than Tablet to Zhang Qian, contains 900 characters. All the characters are graceful and smooth. Appreciating these characters is like bathing in a spring breeze or having a chat with an old friend. The calligrapher was probably a refined and cultivated scholar.
<br /><br />Today the tablet is preserved in the Stele Forest in Xi'an.
<br /><br />Now we take two named examples to illustrate the close relations between personality and writing styles.
<br /><br />Yang Ningshi of the Five Dynasties was a son of the prime minister and was himself a high ranking official. But he pretended to be foolish in order to preserve his moral integrity. He visited many scenic spots. His calligraphic works are innocent, brilliant, free, unrestrained and wild, matching his personality. A Short Note of Chive Flower, written by him in running hand, impresses people with its loose, natural and free-spirited style. But A Short Note of Hat Summer, also by him in running hand, is hurried, crowded, disorderly and slack. Only a person who was free from convention, forgot himself and the things around him and had the power of understanding his life and art could complete a calligraphic work like this one. 
<br /><br />Wang Anshi, a politician, writer and thinker of the Song Dynasty, had lofty ambitions when he was young. He was of the opinion that political thinking should change as time changed, and opposed following routine. After he accepted the post of prime minister, he actively drew up new laws. He wrote extensively on political matters, criticizing social evils and proposing solutions. In addition, he was a good calligrapher. His unrestrained characters show his intelligence and uprightness, although sometimes his self-opinionated and hot-tempered personality peeps through.
<br /><br />Here we should point out that calligraphic works basically illustrate the personalities and sentiments of calligraphers in a brief and abstract way, because it is difficult to match the shapes and quality of calligraphy to the calligrapher's personality.

		<document id="a360bd63c7594177b68b78d5e5db5b2d" url=""><![CDATA[Characteristics of the Technique of Traditional Chinese Pain<br/><br/>The technique of traditional Chinese painting is divided into two major styles: meticulous (gongbi) and freehand (xieyi). Meticulous style requires great care and grace; the strict composition has fine elaboration. The effect is highly decorative. Freehand style generalizes shapes and displays rich brushwork and ink technique. It is easier for beginners, hence this book introduces the techniques of freehand painting, covering brush techniques and the use of ink and colour.
<br /><br /><span class="textAlign textAlignCenter"><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/184531133_16500305_49928364.jpg" /></span> 
<br /><br />Brush techniques.  Lines play a decisive role in the formation of images in traditional Chinese painting, and the variations in lines are, in the main, determined by the method of using the brush. Consequently, in learning the basic techniques of traditional Chinese painting, you should first grasp the basic techniques of using the brush. For instance, you need to pay attention to how you hold the brush, to start a stroke, continue it and come to an end,how you move your brush quickly or slowly, lightly or heavily, and how you vary lifting or pressing your brush. In general,the brush can be divided into three parts:tip, belly and root. Their properties and functions differ from one another. Sometimes you paint with the tip of the brush,as light as gossamer on the paper. Sometimes you press the root of the brush heavily on the paper. Sometimes you use the belly of the brush to bring out charms full of vitality. There are also times you use several parts of the brush in one stroke.This depends entirely on how flexibly you use your brush to present an object. If you succeed, your lines will be vivid and forceful, and you will bring out the spiritual characteristics of the object you're portraying.
<br /><br />The use of the brush in freehand painting allows for a full range of variations. You should paint flexibly and freely. Do not mechanically copy strokesyou’re your painting will be stagnant and insignificant.How can you make your painting uncon-strained? To begin with, you should observe carefully physical, and spiritual changes in objects and the state of mind you intend to present, then you have a clear conception of what you wish to paint.When you paint in this way, your painting will be vivid, interesting and lifelike.
<br /><br />There is a saying in Chinese about having a picture of bamboo in your mind. It means that before an artist paints, he must carefully observe the growth and shape of the bamboo and have them clearly in mind. Then in painting the bamboo will be finished at one go and depicted vividly.
<br /><br /><span class="textAlign textAlignCenter"><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/184531133_13024254_49928399.jpg" /></span> 
<br /><br />In freehand painting you should pay attention to how you hold the brush. Do not move your fingers only. It is important to coordinate them with your wrist, elbow and shoulder. You should practise until you are able to paint with your wrist suspended.Thus you may paint with ease the longest line, the roundest circle, and bamboo poles or willow twigs several feet long.
<br /><br />The use of ink.  Ink occupies an exceedingly important position in traditional Chinese painting, whether it is figure painting, landscape painting or flower-and-bird painting, pure line drawing, ink-and-wash, light colouring or heavy colouring.Black is the main colour of traditional Chinese painting, angl black has five shades (see p. 10). The use of ink involves four processes: outlining showing the shades and texture of rocks and mountains by light ink stroke, applying dots and colouring. In the use of ink you should stress that &quot;colour does not impair ink&quot; and &quot;colour does not destroy the shape.&quot;Images are primary. Brushwork and ink depict the images, and coiours only enrich them. You should also understand the relationship between water and ink. What gives ink-and-wash paintings their unique flavour is that they make use of darkness or lightness, density or dilution to present the light and colour possessed by various objects, especially the particular effect formed between water, ink and unprocessed xuan paper. Even a painting executed a long, long time ago still looks refreshing and full of vitality today. Hence,in learning traditional Chinese painting,you should grasp the use of water and ink.If water and ink are well used, a painting is already halfway done. If they are not well used, it will not be a traditional Chinese painting.
<br /><br />In using ink, you must pay attention to the following points: 1) When grinding an ink stick on an ink slab, grind slowly rather than quickly, thickly rather than thinly. 2) Before painting, always wash the brush and ink slab, so as to prevent impurities or sediment in the ink. 3) Old ink, namely, ink ground the previous day, cannot be used to paint, especially for flower-and-bird painting in the meticulous style. Such ink easily oozes or becomes light when it comes into contact with water. This defect becomes more serious when painting on silk. Old ink sometimes can be used for landscape painting, but the painting will not be sufficiently bright and pure. Sometimes you may blend old and new ink for use.
<br /><br /><span class="textAlign textAlignCenter"><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/184531133_14793862_49928421.jpg" /></span> 
<br /><br />The use of colour.  The use of colour in traditional Chinese painting stresses the intrinsic coiour of the object, varying the shades on the basis of the intrinsic coiours. Very early in ancient China the principle was set forth: &quot;Colours should be presented in accordance with the requirements of different categories of objects.&quot; Colour in Chinese painting is mostly used after finishing the basic modelling with brushwork and ink. It involves variations of brightness of the intrinsic colours, mutual contrast and harmonious relations between various intrinsic colours, coordination of brushwork and ink technique and consideration of coiours' textural functions on paper and silk. Traditional Chinese painting does not depict the complexities of light and colour,but, all the same, it achieves truthful effect with exceedingly artistic appeal.
<br /><br />The method of coiouring in traditional Chinese painting, stressing mainly the intrinsic colours, does not aim at naturalistic imitation. It proceeds from content and is subordinate to the requirements of the theme. It can exaggerate to the fullest extent and boldly change the intrinsic colours of the object, bringing out the theme prominently and expressing the artist's ideas and feelings to achieve ideal artistic effect and producing direct, pure, and bright aesthetic appeal,
<br /><br />We shall illustrate specific methods of colouring in the plates, so shall not explain further here. But beginners should be reminded to pay attention to one point: When you paint on raw xuan paper, you must pay attention to dryness and moist- ness, thickness and thinness of the ink.Generally, when the painting is moist, the colour looks heavier, and after the painting dries, the colour is lighter. Hence, when you paint, the colours should be slightly heavy. Then they will be appropriate after the painting has dried.

		<document id="307f4ea0db13315ad9d3b9e7c5244e85" url=""><![CDATA[Unique Chinese Characters<br/><br/>All written languages have three key elements or functions: shape, pronunciation, and meaning. With regard to Chinese calligraphy, the shape of the characters is closely related to it; the meanings of the characters have some, but not a great relationship with it; and the pronunciation of the characters has no relationship with it at all. So I will mainly introduce the relations of the unique shapes of the Chinese characters to the art of calligraphy.
<br /><br />The special and unique shapes of the Chinese characters and the principle of their composition form the basis of the emergence and  development of Chinese calligraphy. Like astronomical phenomena, among numerous stars in the universe only the earth has water and air; here, all living things, especially human beings, can survive and reproduce. For calligraphy, the unique Chinese characters are its water and air.
<br /><br /><span class="textAlign textAlignCenter"><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/184531133_1052232_49928517.jpg" /></span> 
<br /><br />Chinese characters are square, and each occupies a square space on paper. Statistics show that there are 3,500 common characters, against the total of 90,000. The Chinese people use these characters, which occupy a similar space each but with different shapes, as means to exchange or  record information. You can imagine how many wonderful arrangements are needed for the creation of Chinese characters of thousands of different shapes to fit in a small square. 
<br /><br />Chinese characters, in general, are composed of a dozen basic strokes, which have similar functions to the letters of the Western languages. But they do not combine sounds into syllables. There are eight basic strokes: dot, Horizontal stroke, turning stroke, vertical stroke, hook stroke, right-upward stroke, left-downward stroke and right-downward stroke. They can be demonstrated using the character yong in the so-called formal script.
<br /><br />In practice, in individual handwriting, the strokes show some variations, as they do in different styles of script. Take the formal script for example, A dot in the formal script is written in more than 20 different ways, and the hook stroke in a dozen different ways. Some are illustrated on this page. In a small square space, characters are composed of different strokes linked and arranged in various ways, thus they are easily to recognize, and look neat. These strokes are placed  in various positions in the square - upper or lower, left or right, separate or linked, crossed, going through, overlapping, piling up or surrounding.
<br /><br />Western languages have 20-30 letters, more than the basic strokes of  Chinese characters, but have only three forms: straight line, curved line and dot. And the letters, disregarding their numbers, are arranged from left to right, quite different from Chinese characters, which can be arranged in order, irregular, close and loose ways according to the varied compositions of their strokes.
<br /><br /><span class="textAlign textAlignCenter"><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/184531133_10748254_49928546.jpg" /></span> 
<br /><br />In general, there are two or three handwriting styles like  formal and cursive scripts in the world, much fewer than the dozen scripts in Chinese calligraphy. Here I introduce five scripts. The first three are commonly used, while the other two are archaic and only used in calligraphy nowadays.
<br /><br />Formal script , or regular style. With a history of more than 1,O00 years, formal script is a fundamental writing style and usually appears in printed matter and on computer screens, featuring standard strokes, rigorous rules and a slow speed of writing. The Chinese characters in this style are easy to recognize. This style is
<br />commonly used in shop signs, horizontal or vertical signboards on buildings, Spring Festival couplets, tablets in front of tombs, monuments, nameplates of newspapers and official documents and correspondence.
<br /><br />Running script . This script has been developed from the quick-writing formal script, and is a style halfway between formal script and cursive script. Such a style is looser than the formal script, and has more links between strokes. Most characters in this style have slanting shapes. Moving of the strokes is simple, smooth and light, and characters are easily recognizable. This writing style appears usually in letters and daily life writing.
<br /><br />Cursive script . Written at the quickest speed, the characters in this style are further away from the formal script than the running script in form. With irregular forms, some strokes join together, or parts of strokes or some whole strokes are omitted. So the characters in this style are difficult to write and recognize.
<br /><br />Seal script. The most ancient calligraphic style, the seal script is no longer used except for special effects. The ancient seal-script characters were discovered in inscriptions carved on oracle bones, which were animal bones and tortoise shells used for divination, and on ancient bronze objects as well as in lesser-seal-style inscriptions. It contains few strokes and no dots, hooks or turning strokes, and seeks a unanimous  thickness of lines, symmetry and balanced distribution of strokes. Although people nowadays find them very difficult to recognize, they are full of mystery and charm. A piece of seal-script calligraphic work makes the people understand the simple and honest hearts of their earliest artists and inspires high praise for China's ancient culture.
<br /><br />Official script . This basic form appeared after the seal script, and was mainly used during the Han Dynasty. It changed the rule of unanimous thickness of strokes in the seal script and abolished the pictographic features of the seal script. The characters of this script are squat-shaped, contrasted with the high shapes of the other five scripts. The official-script characters are antique, but easy to recognize.
<br /><br />Today, characters appearing in print and used in computers are mainly Song, imitation-Song, block and boldface characters. The Song style was developed when movable type printing was invented in the Song Dynasty, represented by the calligraphic works of Ouyang Xun and his son Ouyang Tong from the Tang Dynasty. It was reformed during the Ming Dynasty, having thicker vertical strokes and thinner horizontal strokes, and has been the main printing style since the 16th century. The imitation-Song style changed all strokes into thin ones. The block style is a printing style very similar to the handwriting style. Recently, some other block characters have appeared in print and in computer formats, including the Shu style, represented by the modem calligrapher Shu Tong (1906-1998).
