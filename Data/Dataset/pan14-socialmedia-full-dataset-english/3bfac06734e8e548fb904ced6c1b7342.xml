<br />Thinking of you and me in the past
<br />Our smile was so sweet
<br />But you and my past, slowly fade away as time pass by
<br />Suffocated love
<br />Even there's more tears, its extra
<br />Even though we're not wrong, but sometimes, letting go is the better way to go
<br />Therefore, I kept our love in my mind.
<br /><br />Losing you
<br />Makes everything imbalance
<br />Everything lost its importance
<br />Remembering a dead love
<br />Silent as the night...
<br /><br />When I heard the three words
<br />As if my heart was stabbed
<br />But as time pass by
<br />The sound of a breaking hard seems to be a melody
<br /><br />Showing my both cold hands, even though it can't be touched
<br />But now I only think of getting closer to you
<br />In the sobering wind, the boat that time
<br />Illusions showed me my memories
<br />Unable to forget who is moaning sorrowly
<br />Trying to forget, I can't understand at all
<br />I'm waiting for that floating dream...
<br /><br />I don't think I translated it properly, but, who cares? ^^V. Remember, it's jUz CRAP

<br /><br />Very unfortunately, I've accidentally LOST my ticket. Therefore, I was left with no choice but to buy a new ticket, which is RM1. 1 more unfortunate thing is, I have no change at all, only some RM5 notes. There was no other people around me. And then again, i was left with no choice but to go to shops to look for exchanges.
<br /><br />This is the part that ANGERS ME NOW. I went to A LOT OF SHOPS(ALL MALAYS/Chinese). As you can see, a lot of shop means not even 1 shop is willing to change 5 RM1 notes with me. Wtf they thought I was going to con them? For F***'S Sake its only RM5, not RM100, is it really a pain in the ass? But who CARES? I JUZ WANT TO GO HOME!! This really pisses me off, untill I reach a mamak(Indian actually) shop. I juz requested to change. And they straight away changed with me. They even offer me whether to have a drink there or not. 
<br /><br />The main thing is, WHY is malaysian SO... Arghh I'm lost of words again, zzZ. My point is, those who looked at this blog, PLEASE, if you have any change, PLEASE change with them(small change of course), DON'T be afraid of people will CON you. Be a CONSIDERATE MALAYSIAN, PLEASE!!

<br /><br />I believe too, alot of people have know the reason why we exist. We exist, to live, a very short short live. But it depends on how we live our life. We live happily, proves that this live is worth living. If we live this precious life full of sadness and sorrow, then why not we just disappear from this universe? We're just polluting this universe. 
<br /><br />We live to create things, just like scientists invents stuffs. For non-scientists like us, we live to create happiness, not only for this world, but for our next generation life, so that they can live a better and happier life.
<br /><br />So I've decided, to live happily, not sadly. I have only 1 life, one and only precious life.And I ain't gonna give way to any damn MuthaF***ers ruin my life. Ciaoz~~

<br /><br />I admire those having girlfriends, especially my friends. I feel happy for them, but i feel sorry for myself. Even so, I can do nothing. But, looking at my friend breaking up, just makes me thought that they were silly. 
<br /><br />Today, my friend came up to me, and told me that he and his girlfriend broke up. To my surprise, the reason so is because of silly, stupid reasons. I was mad in the inside, but what can I do? They take things so lightly. They thought that relationship was easy to find, but I'm not. When i have a girlfriend, i rather cherish her, give her all the love i can give, everything that makes her happy...

For no reason, i feel stressed. But from the way I react, I most probably spend my time slacking. I'm under stress? or I'm just relaxing?
<br /><br />S.A.M exam, ahh yes~ the decisive exam. Juz hope that i still have enough time to study for my trials exam first. OmG there are TONS of syllabus.  Anyway to help me concentrate in my studies instead of slacking? 1 week, 1 week, just 1 week, maybe i can pull it through without slacking. I need a COMPANION!! Someone to SUFFER with me!!!!

A path that will lead them to their future. The poem &quot;Road not Taken&quot;, was a very good one. Sometimes when you walked a path, you tend to wonder, you tend to ponder, what the path not taken looks like, what would happen if you had chosen that road. But most important of all, its how you take your first step.
<br /><br />Usually I'm not afraid of things. Big, small, whatever it is, I'm normally not afraid it. Can be said that I'm &quot;fearless&quot;, [L]augh [O]ut [L]oud <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/laugh.gif" alt=":)" /> The thing I'm afraid of now, is my future. I can't really tell what my future holds. The more I look at my past, the more I thought of myself, will I ever survive in this modern society? It's all a huge question mark. I fear that, my future is dark. I can be enjoying myself now, but, can i really ensure my future? Can I really decide for my own future? The true fear, is myself. I fear myself of doing things, that my ruin my future.
<br /><br />Hmm, maybe I'm just too young. My friends said that, I'm still young to worry about those things. But, is it really true that I'm not matured enough? I really hoped so. I feel so depressed, down, &quot;emo&quot;, every time I thought of this question to myself... 
<br /><br />Now the biggest question to myself: Do I have the courage? The courage to take a big step foward?

<br /><br />A group of friends, BBQing, chatting, gaming, is just so fun. Even though there aren't any pictures, but I'm so glad that our group organized and participated in it. Even though its just a memory, but its a memory just for us, Taylor's University College S.A.M program, class S5!! 
<br /><br />In the end, we just ended our fun with a toast of beers and wine(even though I'm underage). I would hope that we would have another gathering like this another day. Perhaps next year? Or the year after? Well who knows? Time will answer everything <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cool.gif" alt=":)" />

		<document id="bc4ff12a779fbf2e4828dbd9c749bdc5" url=""><![CDATA[Ignore<br/><br/>In this world, don't we agree that we have lots of troubles and worries? If you don't, I'll have LOADS of doubt. To me, its a total bogus. Well, my main point is, we have too much worries, and unwanted hatred, vengeance, or whatsoever. These emotions, feelings, is what we don't want the most.
<br /><br />During my grandma's funeral, the monk responsible for chanting for her, gave some advice to us, to lead us to a much more happier life. 
<br />What he said,&quot;The best solution is to ignore&quot;. There's also a self-enrichment book named &quot;How to let go of your bananas&quot;. It was very helpful. 
<br />In our everyday lives, we have too much unnecessary worries. These worries cause us stress, giving us pressure. To ignore, is totally not thinking about it, to let go of the worries. I've tried this. Ignoring somethings (i.e. i hate this and that person, but i totally ignore him) will relieve your heart, give you some peace of mind. 
<br />Besides, we also spend too much time worrying about somethings. Instead of worrying over useless things, why don't we use the time to do something more beneficial?

I needed to renew my international passport cause i'm going to a trip to Bali soon. Well, that's not a hard thing to do rite? So, my dad fetch me to the immigration center or something, to renew my passport. Normally this takes at most half an hour, but what the fuck? 2 hours? seriously, fuck those departments. First, the chip on my ic, didn't even have a scratch nor rust on it, so it should be fine rite? Yet, the &quot;ic-reader&quot; can't seem to read the data from it. Wtf? Its not the first time. My dad also had the SAME problem twice. And guess what they said. They blamed the chip for not functioning properly. Ok, that's fine. I went to another department to renew. And guess what they said again. They blamed their &quot;ic-reader&quot; for not functioning properly. 
<br /><br />Seriously, instead of blaming each other, can't you lousy, good for nothing, lazy assholes do something about it? Oh ya btw, my time is SO much more precious than you fuckers'. Please, begone, ZZZ <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/angry.gif" alt=":)" />

<br /><br />*My mom calls me darren when she's mad =P
<br />Mom: &quot;DARREN!! WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU STILL DOING THERE? STOP PLAYING AND START STUDYING!!&quot;
<br /><br />*Mi is what i call my mum
<br />Me: &quot;Oh c'mon Mi... Its still so early, I'll play for a little longer, then I'll go studying.&quot;
<br /><br />Mom: &quot;Now!! This instant!! Or I will seriously smash that computer of yours.&quot;
<br /><br />Me: &quot;Yah right, like you really will. You won't even dare to lose your documents, Laugh Out Loud&quot;
<br /><br />Mom: &quot;Okay then, I'll just switch off the switch!&quot;
<br />(Mom goes on to the switch and switched it off)
<br /><br />Me: &quot;NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!! I NEARLY GOT RANK 1!!!!&quot; Shit la mi, u see la, you spoiled my rank...&quot;
<br />(Got a slap from mom)
<br /><br />Mom: &quot;Still don't want to study? Want me to slap any harder?&quot;
<br />(Me crying off to the study room, and locked myself in it)
<br /><br />Lol!! Thinking of it makes me laugh. I even hid a Gameboy in the study room, so i can play XD
<br />Then during dinner time, my mom knocks the door.
<br /><br />*Dan is what my mom called me (Pronounced as &quot;den&quot<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/wink.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />Mom: &quot;Dan!! Dinner time, come out and eat&quot;
<br />That instant, i quickly hid my gameboy, and went out for dinner.
<br /><br />Well, it was obvious, my result turn out to be very poor.
<br />Seriously, I've been repeating this dialog since I was in primary. Everytime before exam, I'll surely be either playing computer game, or playing gameboy. I never actually studied seriously. Even though my mom knew, and has been lecturing me for almost 10 years, I still remain the same as I am now. I'm being too naive. To think that I can pass any exam without studying. I've realized what I've been wasting during my school life, but till now, I still can't change. Even though i realize, but i can't change. Even now in college, i still went to cyber cafes during my final exam. I've been wasting too much money and time, yet i still do so. Maybe because its because its my habbit. Or maybe because this is the way i am? Or am i giving myself too much excuses? I'm already going to uni next year, and yet, i'm still going to fool myself around again...
<br />I just don't understand why. Why didn't I change the way I was, even though i realize that I'm deep down wrong. I just hope to find some answers to change the way I am. I'm always wondering myself, when can i find such answers...
<br /><br />Actually, i just hope that those people who are like me, don't waste their parent's effort. They should realise what they are doing, before its too late.

Had a maid in the house, doing all the cleaning and all the houseworks. Mum's wonderful cooking every meal... To be honest, I never really stand on my own two feet. I've been hanging on to other people ever since I was born.
<br /><br />And now, its the time I learn how to stand now. Living alone is Australia, seriously, it just makes me regret for not learning how to do my houseworks, cooking and stuffs. Just a sudden change. I'm not sure whether I'll make it or not. It might work out, it might not. There's a WHOLE new environment for me.
