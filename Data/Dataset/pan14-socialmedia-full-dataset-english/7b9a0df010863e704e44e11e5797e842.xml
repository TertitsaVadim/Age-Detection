The function of an air conditioner is usually to transport heat from one station to a further.  It does not actually cool the air, but rather creates cool air by removing heat from the air.  The vehicle your system uses to carry the heat is named a refrigerant.<br /><br />The compressor inside your unit changes the refrigerant into a gas.  As the gas flows by means of the outdoor coil, it loses heat and condenses into a liquid.  This liquid travels into the evaporator coil.  There the refrigerant expands into a gas.  It then absorbs heat circulating in the duct work.  The cool air is redistributed through your home.  Meanwhile, the heat absorbed by the refrigerant is carried back outside.<br /><br />Dirty coils and improper refrigerant levels can cause your system to cool less efficiently.
