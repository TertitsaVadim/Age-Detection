But he appears to have sparked a trend. At least three more patent litigation boutiques with a similar strategy have since arrived on the scene. Tensegrity Law Group; Freitas Tseng Baik &amp; Kaufman; and Feinberg Day Alberti &amp; Thompson are each staffed by defectors from large firms seizing what they see as a tantalizing opportunity to bring lucrative patent claims on contingency—in some cases for NPEs.  Other patent litigators may follow suit, predicts Mark Lemley, the director of Stanford Law School's program in law, science, and technology. &quot;We are seeing more and more people moving in this direction,&quot; Lemley says.</a>

<br /><br />WASHINGTON – The current strong gains in hiring makes the Federal Reserve policymakers worried that it could buzz if the economic growth of the US doesn’t go up.
<br /><br />According to the Fed’s minutes on Tuesday, members were first stated their concerns before they make a plan to keep interest rates at record lows until at least late year 2014. However, some of the members want to take further procedures to improve the economy current status if a condition gets worse or inflation remains reclaimed.
<br /><br />After the meeting, Fed presented the somewhat current view of the economy mainly because of the three consecutive months of hiring in two years. It was concluded that there have been similar raptures of hiring in the previous two years which ended up fading.
<br /><br />On the speech echoed by the Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke last week in the economists gathering, the decline of the economy recovery was the main concern of Fed as it did last year.
<br /><br />Americans aren’t receiving meaningful pay augmentation. Gas prices are high. Additionally, Europe’s debt crisis could reflect on the U.S economy. Provided that the inflation will remain on its current position, analysts think that the Fed will likely give interest rates down in order for them to give the economy an additional support. Most of the economists don’t think that Fed officials will alter their interest-rate policy at their following meeting on April 24-25 and will only relieve credits if the economy gradually moves from its current status.

<br /><br />Because of the cut down prices of copper on Monday stamped as a sign of a slower global economy in which many are asking about what is the future demand for the industrial metal. It was being lowered down two percent as well as the palladium and silver. These three metals are used in a huge number of consumer products from automobiles to consumer electronics and construction materials. It was reported that in the past few days the driving of the economic worries which includes the slowdown in U.S job creation and an increase in China’s inflation rate.
<br /><br />The U.S Labor Department reported Friday that employers added just 120,000 jobs in March, about half the pace from December through February. That renewed concerns about the pace of U.S. economic growth. Consumer prices in China rose 3.6 percent from a year ago but remained below the government’s 4 percent target for the year. Investors speculated that the government may not cut the ratio of funds that banks must hold as reserves, which would free up money for lending, R.J. O’Brien senior commodities broker Phil Streible said. That could hurt demand for copper in the world’s second-largest economy, which is a huge importer of raw materials.

<br /><br />Congratulations to our old friend James Ho. The good news first surfaced on Sophistic Miltonian Serbonian Blog:
<br /><br />A quiet trickle of a rumor last week was that James C. Ho, currently of counsel with Gibson Dunn and a former law clerk to Justice Thomas at SCOTUS, has been tapped to serve as the next Solicitor General of Texas. If this is true, Texas will be in very capable hands as Jim Ho is certainly one of the best appellate lawyers in the state (and the country for that matter), and has demonstrated great and valuable political savvy on the national stage as well.
<br />Moreover, it is interesting to note that, now, three of the four solicitors general have clerked for SCOTUS (Greg Coleman-Justice Thomas; Ted Cruz-the late Chief Rehnquist; and Jim Ho-Justice Thomas). A SCOTUS clerkship now appears to be a prerequisite to the post, which makes eminent sense because one of the OSG’s main functions is to represent the State before SCOTUS-a job we have noted current General Cruz has done extremely well.
