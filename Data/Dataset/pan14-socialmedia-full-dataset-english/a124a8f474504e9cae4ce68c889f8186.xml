<br /><br />I lie in the first light of dawn
<br />Alone, thinking of her
<br />Wishing her next to me
<br />Feeling her breath
<br />Against my skin
<br />Her breasts
<br />Pressed against me
<br />In the quiet of the new day
<br />Hearing her breathing
<br />I ache for her touch
<br />I long for her soft body
<br />Against mine
<br />In the dawns pale light
<br />And in the darkness
<br />I want her
<br />But she is gone
<br />She is mine no more
<br />Never again will my hands
<br />Caress her form
<br />Never again will I hear
<br />Her murmur and sigh in pleasure
<br />She is mine no more
<br />My angel of the night
<br />Has left my side
<br />And dwells now

<br /><br />Twisted, mangled, broken beyond repair
<br />Tattered, frayed, thrown into despair
<br />All because of you...
<br /><br />You blew into my life
<br />So sudden, so unexpectedly
<br />It felt so good
<br />To have found my other half
<br /><br />Things were great
<br />My life was perfect
<br />I thought I'd had it made
<br /><br />The HE came along
<br />Once again
<br />The One- that had hurt you so badly before
<br />And changed everything
<br /><br />The fear, the jealousy, the RAGE
<br />Sick, cold, untiring
<br />It was cruel...what you did
<br />But it wasn't entirely your fault
<br />He manipulated you into doing what he wanted
<br />He made you rip out my heart and spin it like a yo-yo
<br />I'm not a toy, and I REFUSE to play this game
<br /><br />I had all I could do to restrain myself
<br />To contain the monster inside, tearing and clawing to get out
<br />Out of the cold dark world your absence has banished me to
<br /><br />You were the greatest thing that ever happened to me
<br />And yet, it hurt me so badly
<br />You tore out my very soul, and showed it to me
<br /><br />The depression, the agony
<br /><br />You're beautiful, yet deadly
<br /><br />When you were near, I felt so light, so different
<br />When you touched me, I never wanted to let you go
<br />And when you kissed me, you had me. I belonged to you.
<br /><br />I never thought it was possible
<br />This pain was unlike any other I've ever felt
<br /><br />Now here I lay, on the floor, behind a closed door
<br />I can't hear, I can't see
<br />I can't taste, I can't smell
<br />I feel nothing
<br /><br />Wrenched from this world
<br /><br />I wish I could crawl under my bed and die...
<br /><br />Ringing. I hear a sudden ringing
<br />It's you. You sound so sad
<br />I care, and at the same time, I don't
<br />I still feel horrible. Sick and twisted
<br /><br />We talk for so long, it feels like eternity
<br />We come to an agreement...we're going to try again
<br />The depression subsides a little
<br /><br />I'll forgive you eventually, but it will take a while
<br />To trust you as I did before, will take a while too
<br /><br />So ready, so willing
<br />I have to try again...WE have to try again
<br /><br />The wave of emotion is overwhelming
<br />My mind races with thoughts of you, of us
<br />Who knows what the future will throw at us?
<br /><br />But maybe this is a test. A test of how strong our relationship is
<br /><br />Blackness. I turn out the light, and lay down
<br />My thouhgts flash through my mind
<br /><br />I long to hold you, to touch you, to kiss you
<br />I want to feel your touch, the comfort of your presence
<br />The feeling of your arms around me
<br /><br />Just the two of us
<br />You,
<br />And I,
<br /><br />It's so exhausting...these thoughts
<br />There's so many
<br />And then, it all stops spinning
<br />It becomes so quiet, so peaceful
<br />I wish you were here, to be beside me
<br />Things will get better, I know this much
<br /><br />I know it will get brighter
<br />As hard as it may be, I will love you once again
<br /><br />These waves of emotion, these millions of thoughts
<br />They are of you, for you...all because of you

<br />A long and lasting relationship
<br />Is what I am searching;
<br />To find true love
<br />Is all I am wanting.
<br /><br />You came into my life
<br />And captured my heart;
<br />Even if I know that someday
<br />You'd break it apart.
<br /><br />I choose to love you
<br />Even if I die in pain
<br />Because I know, to love you,
<br />Happiness I gain.
<br /><br />I also know that you
<br />Won’t be here forever;
<br />But this I promise you,
<br />I will treasure the times we spent together.
<br /><br />Soon you’ll leave me
<br />But you won’t see me crying;
<br />Because my love is with you
<br />Until the day you’ll be leaving.
<br /><br />Hoping you’d take care
<br />The love I gave for you
<br />And feel its beating
<br />As your heart beats too.
<br /><br />When will I see you again?
<br />I keep on asking;
<br />And if you’d come back,
<br />Is it still my heart that you are bringing?
<br /><br />But if you have any plan
<br />Of replacing my heart with someone new;
<br />It would grateful if you’d return my heart
<br />Before I give it to you.
<br /><br />Yes, I’m still hoping
<br />That someday our path would still meet;
<br />Hoping by that time
<br />My heart for you would still beat.

<br />Love hurts so much
<br />Hurts more at every touch
<br />Love is supposed to be great
<br />Starting with the first date
<br />Love tears you apart
<br />Stabs you through the heart
<br />Why does God let people fall,
<br />For this thing called Love?
<br />When it makes you hurt all over
<br />Love makes the tears fall

<br /><br />I will still wait for her,
<br />Will wait for her to come,
<br />The feelings of her love all alive in my heart,
<br />She did so too, and that I do know,
<br />Every time, time passed me by,
<br />I could feel her love all but shy,
<br />Tiding my heart,
<br />I could see it in her eyes all the time,
<br />With every breath she breathed away,
<br />I could smell her love but still to say,
<br />Whenever I looked in her deep blue eyes,
<br />My burning love smoked them two,
<br />Every moment she talked to me,
<br />I could taste the chilly mildness,
<br />The mildness of her quiet so love,
<br />But, it so happened but I confessed,
<br />It was her that was life all along,
<br />Never did she say the same to me,
<br />Still I’ll wait for her to see,
<br />Look behind to find me there,
<br />Standing alone, all alone,
<br />In the desert sands,
<br />Stormy skies,
<br />Winds to let adore,
<br />And a broken heart all so sore,
<br />All alone and waiting for her,
<br />That’s what is going all along.
<br />They time wouldn’t stop they tell me so,
<br />Let then it burn me too,
<br />In its way to perish again.
<br />Life doesn’t stop no matter what the pain,
<br />Let its waves then break me too,
<br />In its way to the blind destiny.
<br />Continuously down your cheek
<br />You no longer see the real world
<br />Not a single peek
<br />Maybe one day,
<br />Someone will explain
<br />All the sorrow and the pain
<br />That all this love will bring...

<br /><br />A Broken Seashell
<br />On this island in the universe,
<br />I feel alone and desolate.
<br />A broken heart is like a broken seashell,
<br />It can't be repaired and nobody wants it for his collection.
<br />A love so long ago lost,
<br />I begin to doubt if she will ever return
<br />Her heart now wonders the shores of another ocean,
<br />A new wave touches her soul,
<br />And a new air fills his heart.
<br />On this island in the universe,
<br />I feel alone and desolate.
<br />The waters pick up my broken pieces.
<br />For awhile I float,
<br />In time I sink to the dark abyss.
<br />No one can travel to pull me up.
<br />The pressure pulverizes my pieces,
<br />I become the sand,
<br />Just a tiny grain to her,
<br />Forever looked past.....

<br />Sitting in the dark
<br />Moonbeams on my face
<br />The arrow hit its mark
<br />Feeling so alone; feel so out of place.
<br /><br />Desperately seeking answers but no one to ask
<br />Life now sems to be an ill-burdened task.
<br />Helplessly wearing my heart on my sleeve
<br />Constantly praying that this pain would soon leave.
<br /><br />Drops of Sadness falling from my eyes
<br />Broken dreams covering the blackened skies.
<br />Wanting to run so far, far away
<br />Wishing that Oblivion would greet the dawning day.
<br /><br />Thinking back on the time gone by,
<br />Wondering exactly where things went awry.
<br />Detesting that I just could not see
<br />That I am the one who brought this affliction upon me.
<br /><br />Desiring so much to just move on,
<br />Wanting so badly for the pain to be gone.
<br />Hoping endlessly that I could just forget you,
<br />Realizing at last, nothing you said was ever true.
<br /><br />Quietly questioning why it had to be me;
<br />Did I really deserve your cold cruelty?
<br />Sitting alone with my thoughts tearing me apart,
<br />Why did you aim your arrow straight at my heart?

<br />She came into my life like a whirlwind,
<br />Shining her love upon my heart.
<br />She set my soul free,
<br />To soar among the clouds above.
<br /><br />She gave me the gift of happiness,
<br />Making me feel safe again, not so alone.
<br />She then walked away one day,
<br />Taking that gift with him.
<br /><br />With the warmth of love no longer shining,
<br />My heart is cold and my soul grounded.
<br />I now am left in the dark shadows of my life
<br />With the dreams of yesterday.

<br />When I first met you, I was afraid
<br />Afraid of what I was feeling
<br />I felt love like I had never known
<br />I didn't just feel you in my heart
<br />I felt you in my soul
<br />I had no idea I could feel so much
<br />My life was complicated
<br />I was afraid you wouldn't want to be in my life
<br />I was afraid I couldn't be all that you wanted me to be
<br />Slowly you made me believe I was all that you needed and wanted
<br />That you wanted to be in my life
<br />And when I truly trusted you and let you in
<br />I felt an intense feeling of contentment
<br />A feeling of happiness like I have never known
<br />I felt alive again
<br />Even though we were a long way from working things out
<br />The feeling in my heart and soul
<br />Was something I have never known
<br />Never did I dream you would leave like you did
<br />I never dreamed that the one who gave me such feelings
<br />Feelings I had never felt before
<br />Would take them away
<br />Take them away without a moments hesitation
<br />I never dreamed the one I trusted and loved with my heart and soul
<br />Would hurt me in the way he knew would hurt me most
<br />Now I am left questioning everything
<br />Everything he ever said
<br />Was our love ever real
<br />Was she ever my soulmate
<br />Was she ever my honey
<br />How do you go on
<br />When the one you love so completly leaves
<br />When your soulmate leaves
<br />When every breath was her's
<br />How do you breathe alone

<br /><br />This woman came in to my life
<br />At a time when I wasn’t lookin’
<br />She brought great sunshine and laughter
<br />To my heart, she became somethin’.
<br /><br />You were loving, thoughtful, and sincere
<br />We talked of our lives, our dreams, our hopes
<br />We talked, we played, we loved
<br />You took my heart and soul, this I know.
<br /><br />I gave you my all
<br />My love, my heart, my soul
<br />With dreams of becoming
<br />Your forever more.
<br /><br />You handled my heart
<br />With words of love and kindness
<br />Making my heart soar
<br />With true love and friendship.
<br /><br />We talked and laughed
<br />And laughed and played
<br />For a true friendship
<br />My heart did display.
<br /><br />Never had I felt a love
<br />Of this great magnitude
<br />My hopes, my dreams
<br />Filled only of you.
<br /><br />I wanted to give you my life
<br />Filled with love, happiness, children
<br />A good home, your friend, your lover
<br />’Til my end...God knows when.
<br /><br />I never saw it coming
<br />This bomb you dropped on me
<br />My love, my hopes, my dreams
<br />’This not to be.
<br /><br />My world came shattering down upon me
<br />This dream I had of us
<br />You couldn’t love me completely
<br />You broke my heart, my trust.
<br /><br />I will keep on loving you
<br />For ’tis very hard to let go
<br />I will love you forever more

<br /><br />Strange kind of phase I’m going through!
<br />I’m totally in love with you..
<br /><br />Yet! I feel insane to be so attached!
<br />But so comfortable, knowing that we’re Patched
<br /><br />Patched…
<br />With faith in one another,
<br />With love for each other!
<br /><br />We have this bond that can never break,

<br />We’re so fake…
<br /><br />Why do we keep our love apart?
<br />When we’re in love, deep down our hearts
<br /><br />Why act as if life means nothing!
<br />Like we just gave up…
<br />When in our souls the attraction can never stop!
<br /><br />You walked away from me…
<br />And told me it’s for my own good…
<br />What do you know about me, to tell me what I should do!
<br /><br />I think you’ve made the biggest mistake,
<br />Cause you caused my heart to ache
<br /><br />Without you I felt lost, but then again I stood up to my pride…
<br />You left me! that’s true, but your love, you couldn’t hide…
<br /><br />You want to hold me tight, and tell me all what is inside you…
<br />Why don’t we talk, and get this through…
<br /><br />I think the parting has lingered, and both of us, need love…
<br />Can we please make our hearts rest in one shell,
<br />Filled with love and passion,
<br />For just you and me!
