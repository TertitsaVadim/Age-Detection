She erased it and went on with the day's lesson. The next day, she came in and saw the same word on the chalkbaord, but a little bit bigger. She erased it and went on with her lesson.
<br />Each of the next several days, the teacher would come in to find “penis” on the board, a little larger each time. She went in one morning, expecting to find it again, but instead the chalkboard read: “The more you rub it, the bigger it gets.”

<br />The earth lay cool and still
<br />When suddenly a tiny bird
<br />Perched on my window sill.
<br /><br />He sang a song so lovely
<br />So carefree and so gay,
<br />That slowly all my troubles
<br />Began to slip away.
<br /><br />He sang of far off places
<br />Of laughter and of fun,
<br />It seemed his very trilling,
<br />brought up the morning sun.
<br /><br />I stirred beneath the covers
<br />Crept slowly out of bed,
<br />And gently lowered the window
<br />And crushed his fucking head.
<br /><br />Good Morning all, hope you have a brillaint day

He can swear for five minutes straight without repeating himself. Trouble is, the guy who owns him is a quiet, conservative type, and this bird's foul mouth is driving him crazy. One day, it gets to be too much, so the guy grabs the bird by the throat, shakes him really hard, and yells, &quot;QUIT IT!&quot; But this just makes the bird mad and he swears more than ever. Then the guy gets mad and says, &quot;OK for you,&quot; and locks the bird in a kitchen cabinet. This really aggravates the bird and he claws and scratches, and when the guy finally lets him out, the bird cuts loose with a stream of invectives that would make a veteran sailor blush. At that point, the guy is so mad that he throws the bird into the freezer. For the first few seconds there is a terrible din. The bird kicks and claws and thrashes. Then it suddenly gets VERY quiet. At first the guy just waits, but then he starts to think that the bird may be hurt. After a couple of minutes of silence, he's so worried that he opens up the freezer door. The bird calmly climbs onto the man's out-stretched arm and says, &quot;Awfully sorry about the trouble I gave you. I'll do my best to improve my vocabulary from now on.&quot; The man is astounded. He can't understand the transformation that has come over the parrot. Then the parrot says, &quot;By the way, what did the chicken do?&quot;

<br />1, OPENING JARS - nnnnngg, she's struggling. You take it from her hands, open it effortlessly and pretend she loosened it for you. She didn't. Jars are men's work. 
<br /><br />2, CALLING SOMEONE 'SON' - Especially policeman but even saying it to kids makes you the man. 
<br /><br />3, DOING A PROPER SLIDE TACKLE - Beckham free kicks? Gay. A Stuart Pearce tackle is the pinnacle of the game, simultaneously winning the ball and crippling the man. Magic. 
<br /><br />4, SHARPENING A PENCIL WITH A STANLEY KNIFE - Blunt, is it? Hand it here love. No, I don't need a sharpener, you think I can't whittle. 
<br /><br />5, GOING TO THE TIP - A manly act which combines driving, lifting and - as you thrillingly drop your rubbish into another huge pile of other rubbish - noisy destruction. 
<br /><br />6, DRINKING UP - Specifically, rising from the table, slinging your coat on and downing two thirds of a pint in one fluid movement. Then nodding towards the door, saying, &quot;Let's go&quot; and striding out while everyone else struggles to catch up with you. God, you're hard. 
<br /><br />7, HAVING A THIN BIT OF WOOD - in the shed, solely to stir paint with. 
<br /><br />8, HAVING A SCAR - Ideally it'll be a facial knife wound, but even an iron burn on the wrist is good. &quot;Ooh, did it hurt&quot;. &quot;Nah&quot;. 
<br /><br />9, HAVING A HANGOVER AND THICK STUBBLE - When birds have been partying they just whinge. You, on the other hand have physical evidence of your hardness, sprouting from your face. &quot;Big night?&quot; &quot;Grr, what does it look like!&quot; 
<br /><br />10, NODDING AT COPPERS - A moments eye contact is all it takes for you to share the unspoken bond. &quot;We've not seen eye to eye in the past&quot;, it says, &quot;but someone's got to keep the little scrotes in line&quot;. 
<br /><br />11, USING POWER TOOLS - slightly more powerful than you need or can safely handle. Pneumatic drilling while smoking a fag? Superb. 
<br /><br />12, KICKING A FOOTY AGAINST A GARAGE DOOR - Clang-g-g-g-g-g-! Stitch that, Becks, I kick so hard I set off car alarms. 
<br /><br />13, ARRIVING IN A PUB LATE... and everyone cheers you. It doesn't mean you're popular, it just means your mates are p***ed. However, the rest of the pub doesn't know that. 
<br /><br />14, NOT WATCHING YOUR WEIGHT - fat is a feminist issue, apparently. Brilliant. Pass the pork scratchings. 
<br /><br />15, CARVING THE ROAST - and saying &quot;are you a leg or breast man&quot; to the blokes and &quot;do you want stuffing&quot; to the women. Congratulations, you are now your dad. 
<br /><br />16, WINKING - turns women to putty. Doesn't it? 
<br /><br />17, TEST SWINGING HAMMERS - ideally, B&amp;Q would have little changing rooms with mirrors so you could see how rugged you look with any DIY item. Until then, we'll make do with the aisles. 
<br /><br />18, TAKING OUT £200 FROM A CASHPOINT - okay, so its for paying the plumber later but with that much cash you feel like a mafia don. The only thing better is peeling notes off the roll later. 
<br /><br />19, PHONE CALLS THAT LAST LESS THAN A MINUTE - unlike birds, we get straight to the point. &quot;alright? Yep. Drink? Red Lion? George, it is then. Seven. See ya.&quot; 
<br /><br />20, PARALLEL PARKING - bosh, straight in. first time. Can Schumacher do that? No, because his cars got no reverse gear which, technically, makes you the world's best driver. 
<br /><br />21, HAVING EARNED THAT PINT - Since the dawn of time, men have toiled in the fields in blistering heat. Why? So, when it's over we can stand there in silence, surveying our work with one hand resting on the beer gut while the other nurses a foaming jug of ale. Aaaah. 
<br /><br />22, HAVING SOMETHING PROPERLY WRONG WITH YOU - especially if you didn't make a fuss. &quot;Why was I off, oh nothing much, just third-degree burns&quot; 
<br /><br />23, KNOWING WHICH SCREWDRIVER IS WHICH - &quot;a Phillips? For that? Are you mad, bint?&quot; 
<br /><br />24, TAKING A NEWSPAPER INTO THE LOO - a visual code that says that's right, i'm going in there for a huge, long man-sized sh*t.

<br /><br />Just try this. It is from an orthopedic surgeon........... 
<br /><br />This will boggle your mind and you will keep trying over and over again to see if you can outsmart your foot, but you can't. It's preprogrammed in your brain! 
<br /><br />1. WITHOUT anyone watching you (they will think you are GOOFY......) and while sitting where you are at your desk in front of your computer, lift your right foot off the floor and make clockwise circles. 
<br /><br />2. Now, while doing this, draw the number &quot;6&quot; in the air with your right hand . 
<br /><br />Your foot will change direction. 
<br /><br />I TOLD YOU SO!!! 
<br />And there's nothing you can do about it! ; ; 
<br /><br />You and I both know how stupid it is, but before the day is done you are going to try it again, if you've not already done so ! !

<br /><br />If you yelled for 8 years, 7 months and 6 days you would produce enough sound energy to heat one cup of coffee.(Hardly seems worth it.) 
<br /><br />If you farted consistently for 6 years and 9 months, enough gas is produced to create the energy of an atomic bomb. (Now that's more like it!) 
<br /><br />The human heart creates enough pressure when it pumps out to the body that it could squirt blood 30 feet. (O.M.G.!) 
<br /><br />A pig's orgasm lasts 30 minutes long. (In my next life, I want to be a pig.) 
<br /><br />A cockroach can live up to nine days without it's head before it starves to death. (Creepy. I'm still not over the pig.) 
<br /><br />Banging your head against a wall uses 150 calories an hour. (Warning: Do not try this at home........ maybe at work.) 
<br /><br />The male praying mantis cannot copulate while its head is attached to its body. The female initiates sex by ripping the male's head off. (&quot;Honey, I'm home. What the......?!&quot<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/wink.gif" alt=":)" /> 
<br /><br />The flea can jump up to 350 times its body length. For a human, that would be equivalent to jumping the length of a entire football field. (30 minutes....lucky pig.... Can you imagine 30 minute orgasm?<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/unsure.gif" alt=":)" /> 
<br /><br />The catfish has over 27,000 taste buds. (What could be so tasty on the bottom of a pond or the sea<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/unsure.gif" alt=":)" /> 
<br /><br />Some lions mate over 50 times a day. (I still want to be a pig in my next life.... quality over quantity!) 
<br /><br />Butterflies can taste with their feet. (Something I always wanted to know.) 
<br /><br />The strongest muscle in the body is the tongue. (Hmmmmmmm........ won't go there.) 
<br /><br />Right-handed people live, on an average, live nine years longer than left-handed people. (Glad to be right handed.) 
<br /><br />Elephants are the only animals that cannot jump. (OK, so that would be a good thing.) 
<br /><br />A cat's urine glows under a black light. (I wonder who was paid to figure that out.) 
<br /><br />An ostrich's eye is bigger than its brain. (I know some people like that.) 
<br /><br />Starfish have no brains. (I know some people like that too.) 
<br /><br />Polar bears are left-handed. (If they switch, they'll live a lot longer.) 
<br /><br />Humans and dolphins are the only species that have sex for pleasure. (What about that pig??<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/unsure.gif" alt=":)" />

<br /><br />Here's the guys version......enjoy <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />First I was afraid I was petrified
<br />At the ugly slapper that was lying by my side
<br />I would've drunk a little less, I would've tried to keep my head.
<br />If I'd known for just one second you'd assault me in your bed…
<br /><br />I tried to go, walk out the door
<br />But you've been sitting on my legs and I can't feel them anymore 
<br />And now you're sitting on my face, my nose has vanished - not a trace, 
<br />I only hope that your big knickers aren't made of liquorice lace
<br /><br />I want to go, I've got to leave
<br />Before your fat and naked body makes me want to heave 
<br />Only hope that no one saw me walking home with such a slut.
<br />God the things that you get up to when you're half cut.
<br /><br />Please let me go, I'm getting scared
<br />There's nothing I can do to stop those ugly breasts from being bared.
<br />I think that I must have been mad,
<br />God what made me want to court her?
<br />With t*ts that look like Tesco bags I've just filled up with water
<br /><br />It's time to go, run out the door
<br />She's started hinting she wants sex on her dirty lino floor
<br />I don't think there's anything worse than the al-co-hol-ics curse.
<br /><br />I WILL SURVIVE !

<br /><br />Had one person yesterday cancelled a friendship with me (not like i'd miss em or owt never spoke to em before) simply becoz i was a away from my computer and didn't see them requesting a chat.
<br /><br />So they spat their dummy out by the look on it lol 
<br /><br />So after looking through all my 'mates' i have decided to clear out alot of them, please don't be offended, if we don't chat then whats the point ??

<br />© KC 
<br /><br />You're never alone, I'm always near,
<br />When your troubled, down or blue.
<br />All you have to do is call me,
<br />I'm always here for you. 
<br /><br />It doesn't matter where I'm at,
<br />It doesn't matter when.
<br />When you need someone to talk to,
<br />I'm here to be your friend. 
<br /><br />If you need someone to hold your hand,
<br />or a hug to say I care.
<br />If you need a shoulder to cry on,
<br />for you I will be there. 
<br /><br />So never think you are a burden,
<br />when the weight gets to be to much.
<br />You might find if look hard enough,
<br />a good friend could be the right touch. 
<br /><br />You're never alone, I'm always here,
<br />through the good times and the bad.
<br />I'm always here to be your friend,
<br />I don't like to see you sad.

<br /><br />A little further along, the poor old horse stumbled again. The farmer said, &quot;That's twice.&quot;
<br /><br />After a little, while the poor old horse stumbled again. The farmer didn't say anything, but reached under the seat, pulled out a shotgun and shot the horse. 
<br /><br />His brand new bride raised all kind of hell with him, telling him, &quot;That was an awful thing to do.&quot;
