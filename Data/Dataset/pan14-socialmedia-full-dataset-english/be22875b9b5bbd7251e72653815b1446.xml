The species basically does not exist in most of the place. For California people, the diagnosis of a recluse bite in our state has a extremely substantial likelihood of currently being a misdiagnosis, since the spider does not normally happen below. The only exception could be a single in which a recluse was contained in a shipment coming from its native array. This would be a rare event. &lt;em&gt;Notice:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;There are some brown, fiddle-back again spiders that are indigenous to California which mimic its physical appearance. They are capable of creating signs equivalent to the Brown Recluse. These are the Desert Recluse, &lt;em&gt;Loxosceles deserta and the South American (dot), &lt;em&gt;Loxosceles laeta.

Spider bites are unable to be identified by simply hunting at the damage. For a positive diagnosis of a brown recluse bite the spider should be captured and positively discovered as a Brown Recluse, by a skilled professional.&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;/ul&gt;<br /><br />If you've been diagnosed with a Brown Recluse bite, be confident to get a second opinion and have a pest expert examine the location exactly where you feel you encountered the spider.
