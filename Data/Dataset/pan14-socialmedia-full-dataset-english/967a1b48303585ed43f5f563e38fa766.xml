She opened it then slammed it shut and stormed back into the house. A little later she came out of her house again, went to the mailbox and again opened it, and slammed it shut again. Angrily, back into the house she went. 
<br /><br />As the man was getting ready to edge the lawn, she came out again, marched to the mailbox, opened it and then slammed it closed harder than ever. 
<br /><br />Puzzled by her actions the man asked her, “Is something wrong?” 
<br /><br />To which she replied, “There certainly is!” 
<br /><br />My stupid computer keeps saying, “You’ve got mail!”
<br /><br />2)There was a blonde who found herself sitting next to a Lawyer on an airplane. The lawyer just kept bugging the blonde wanting her to play a game of intelligence. Finally, the lawyer offered her 10 to 1 odds, and said every time the blonde could not answer one of his questions, she owed him $5, but every time he could not answer hers, he'd give her $50.00. The lawyer figured he could not lose, and the blonde reluctantly accepted.
<br /><br />The lawyer first asked, &quot;What is the distance between the Earth and the nearest star?&quot;
<br /><br />Without saying a word the blonde handed him $5. then the blonde asked, &quot;What goes up a hill with 3 legs and comes back down the hill with 4 legs?&quot;
<br /><br />Well, the lawyer looked puzzled. He took several hours, looking up everything he could on his laptop and even placing numerous air-to-ground phone calls trying to find the answer. Finally, angry and frustrated, he gave up and paid the blonde $50.00
<br /><br />The blonde put the $50 into her purse without comment, but the lawyer insisted, &quot;What is the answer to your question?&quot;
<br /><br />Without saying a word, the blonde handed him $5.
<br /><br />3)  3 blondes were walking down the street. They looked into a corn field and saw a blonde in a rowboat trying to row. The 1st blonde said &quot;that's the kind of blonde that gives us blondes a bad name.&quot;
<br />The 3rd blonde said, &quot;Yeah! If I could swim I would swim out there and give her a piece of my mind.&quot;
<br /><br />4)theres a mirror that gives you money if you are trueful
<br />but if you lie you get sent to hell
<br /><br />a brunette goes up to it and says i think i am the sxciest women alive. Poof she found herself in hell!!!
<br /><br />a redhead prostitute says i think i am a virgin.
<br />poof she found herself in hell!!!!
<br /><br />a blonde goes up to it and says &quot; i think....&quot;
<br />and poof she found herself in hell

<br /><br />Well, it's shit...that's right, shit!
<br />Shit may just be the most functional
<br />word in the English language.
<br /><br />Consider:

<br />or have shit for brains.
<br /><br />With a little effort,
<br />you can get your shit together,
<br />Find a place for your shit, Or
<br />be asked to shit or get off the pot.
<br /><br />You can smoke shit,
<br />buy shit,
<br />sell shit,
<br />lose shit,
<br />find shit,
<br />forget shit,
<br />and tell others to eat shit.
<br /><br />Some people know their shit, while
<br />others can't tell the difference
<br />between Shit and Shineola.
<br /><br />There are lucky shits,
<br />dumb shits,
<br />crazy shits,
<br />There is bull shit,
<br />horse shit and
<br />chicken shit.
<br /><br />You can throw shit,

<br />or duck when the shit hits the fan.
<br /><br />You can give a shit or

<br />things can look like shit,
<br />and there are times when you feel like shit.

<br />a bucket of shit and come out smelling like a rose.
<br /><br />When you stop to consider all the facts,
<br />it's the basic building block of the English language.
<br /><br />And remember, once you know your shit,
<br />you don't need to know anything else!
<br /><br />You could pass this along, if you give a shit. Or not do so, If you
<br />don't give a shit!
<br /><br />Well Shit, it's time for me to go. Just wanted you to know that I do
<br />Give A Shit and hope you had a nice day, without a bunch of shit. But

<br />A young girl on a year's training course in South Africa recently received a &quot;Dear John&quot; letter from her boyfriend back home. It read as follows:
<br /><br />Dear Mary,
<br />I can no longer continue our relationship. The distance between us is just too great. I must admit that I have cheated on you twice since you've been gone, and it's not fair to either of us. I'm sorry. Please return the picture of me that I sent to you.
<br />Love, John.
<br /><br />Mary, with her feelings hurt, asked all her colleagues for any snapshots they could spare of boyfriends, brothers, cousins etc. In addition to the picture of John, Mary included all the other pictures of the pretty lads she had collected from her buddies.
<br /><br />There were 57 photos in the envelope, along with this note:
<br /><br />Dear John,
<br />I'm sorry, but I can't remember who the f**k you are. Please take your picture from the pile, and send the rest back to me.
<br />Take care, Mary.

		<document id="4b75e4844d39ec9bac3cb67fe56ddac" url=""><![CDATA[Marriage Humour<br/><br/>1. Women are unpredictable. Before marriage, she 
<br />&gt; 
<br />&gt; expects a man, after marriage she suspects him, and after death she 
<br />&gt; 
<br />&gt; respects him. 
<br />&gt; 
<br />&gt; 
<br />&gt; 
<br />&gt;2. There was this guy who told his woman that he loved 
<br />&gt; 
<br />&gt;her so much that he would go thru hell for her. They got married - and 
<br />&gt; 
<br />&gt; now he is going thru hell. 
<br />&gt; 
<br />&gt; 
<br />&gt; 
<br />&gt; 3. A man inserted an 'ad' in the classifieds : &quot;Wife 
<br />&gt; 
<br />&gt; wanted &quot;. Next day, he received a hundred letters. They all said the 
<br />&gt; 
<br />&gt; same thing : &quot;You can have mine.&quot; 
<br />&gt; 
<br />&gt; 
<br />&gt; 
<br />&gt;4. When a man opens the door of his car for his wife, 
<br />&gt; 
<br />&gt; you can be sure of one thing: either the car is new or the wife. 
<br />&gt; 
<br />&gt; 
<br />&gt; 
<br />&gt;5. It's easy to tell if a man is married or not. Just 
<br />&gt; 
<br />&gt; watch him drive a 
<br />&gt; 
<br />&gt; car with a woman sitting beside him. If both his hands 
<br />&gt; 
<br />&gt; are on the wheel, you can be sure he is married. 
<br />&gt; 
<br />&gt; 
<br />&gt; 
<br />&gt;6. A man received a letter from some kidnappers. The 
<br />&gt; 
<br />&gt; letter said, &quot;If you don't promise to send us $100,000 I swear that we 
<br />&gt; 
<br />&gt; will kidnap your wife.&quot; The poor man wrote back, &quot; I am afraid I can't 
<br />&gt; 
<br />&gt; keep my promise but I hope you will keep yours.&quot; 
<br />&gt; 
<br />&gt; 
<br />&gt; 
<br />&gt;7. What's the matter, you look depressed.&quot; &quot;I'm having 
<br />&gt; 
<br />&gt; trouble with my wife.&quot; &quot;What happened?&quot; &quot;She said she wasn't going to 
<br />&gt; 
<br />&gt; speak to me for 30 days.&quot; &quot;But that ought to make you happy.&quot; &quot;It did, 
<br />&gt; 
<br />&gt; but today is the last day.&quot; 
<br />&gt; 
<br />&gt; 
<br />&gt; 
<br />&gt;WOMAN 
<br />&gt; 
<br />&gt; When she is 18 - She is a football, 22 men going after 
<br />&gt; 
<br />&gt; her. When she is 28 - She is a hockey ball, 8 men going after her. When 
<br />&gt; 
<br />&gt; she is 38 - She is a golf ball, 1 man hitting on her. When she is 48 - She 
<br />&gt; 
<br />&gt; is a pingpong ball, 2 men pushing to each other. 
<br />&gt; 
<br />&gt; 
<br />&gt; 
<br />&gt; MAN 
<br />&gt; 
<br />&gt; At 20 - A man is like a coconut, so much to offer, so little to give. 
<br />&gt; 
<br />&gt; At 30 - He is like a durian, dangerous but delicious. 
<br />&gt; 
<br />&gt; At 40 - He is like a watermelon, big, round and juicy. 
<br />&gt; 
<br />&gt;At 50 - He is like a mandarin orange, the season comes once in a year. 
<br />&gt; 
<br />&gt;At 60 - He is just like a raisin, dried out, wrinkles and cheap. 
<br />&gt; 
<br />&gt; 
<br />&gt; 
<br />&gt; Marriage Humour In the beginning, 
<br />&gt; 
<br />&gt; 
<br />&gt; 
<br />&gt; -- God created earth and rested. Then God created man 
<br />&gt; 
<br />&gt;and rested. Then God created woman. Since then, neither God nor man has 
<br />&gt; 
<br />&gt; rested.

<br />&gt;departed for his vacation in Miami Beach, where he was to meet his wife 
<br />&gt;the next day at the conclusion of her business trip to Minneapolis. They 
<br />&gt;were looking forward to pleasant weather and a nice time together. 
<br />&gt;Unfortunately, there was some sort of mix up at the boarding gate, and 
<br />&gt;the man was told he would have to wait for a later flight. He tried to 
<br />&gt;appeal to a supervisor but was told the airline was not responsible for 
<br />&gt;the problem and it would do no good to complain. 
<br />&gt; 
<br />&gt;Upon arrival at the hotel the next day, he discovered that Miami Beach 
<br />&gt;was having a heat wave, and its weather was almost as uncomfortably hot 
<br />&gt;as Seattle's was cold. 
<br />&gt; 
<br />&gt;The desk clerk gave him a message that his wife would arrive as planned. 
<br />&gt;He could hardly wait to get to the pool area to cool off, and quickly 
<br />&gt;sent his wife an e-mail, but due to his haste, he made an error in the 
<br />&gt;e-mail address. His message therefore arrived at the home of an elderly 
<br />&gt;preacher's wife whose even older husband had died only the day before. 
<br />&gt; 
<br />&gt;When the grieving widow opened her e-mail, she took one look 
<br />&gt;at the monitor, let out an anguished scream, and fell to the floor dead. 
<br />&gt;Her family rushed to her room where they saw this message on the screen: 
<br />&gt; 
<br />&gt;Dearest wife, 
<br />&gt;Departed yesterday as you know. Just now got checked in. Some 
<br />&gt;confusion at the gate. Appeal was denied. Received confirmation of 
<br />&gt;your arrival tomorrow. 
<br />&gt; 
<br />&gt;Your loving husband. 
<br />&gt;P.S. Things are not as we thought. You're going to be surprised at how 
<br />&gt;hot it is down here.......

<br />&gt;Unfortunately, there was some sort of mix up at the boarding gate, and 
<br />&gt;the man was told he would have to wait for a later flight. He tried to 
<br />&gt;appeal to a supervisor but was told the airline was not responsible for 
<br />&gt;the problem and it would do no good to complain. 
<br />&gt; 
<br />&gt;Upon arrival at the hotel the next day, he discovered that Miami Beach 
<br />&gt;was having a heat wave, and its weather was almost as uncomfortably hot 
<br />&gt;as Seattle's was cold. 
<br />&gt; 
<br />&gt;The desk clerk gave him a message that his wife would arrive as planned. 
<br />&gt;He could hardly wait to get to the pool area to cool off, and quickly 
<br />&gt;sent his wife an e-mail, but due to his haste, he made an error in the 
<br />&gt;e-mail address. His message therefore arrived at the home of an elderly 
<br />&gt;preacher's wife whose even older husband had died only the day before. 
<br />&gt; 
<br />&gt;When the grieving widow opened her e-mail, she took one look 
<br />&gt;at the monitor, let out an anguished scream, and fell to the floor dead. 
<br />&gt;Her family rushed to her room where they saw this message on the screen: 
<br />&gt; 
<br />&gt;Dearest wife, 
<br />&gt;Departed yesterday as you know. Just now got checked in. Some 
<br />&gt;confusion at the gate. Appeal was denied. Received confirmation of 
<br />&gt;your arrival tomorrow. 
<br />&gt; 
<br />&gt;Your loving husband. 
<br />&gt;P.S. Things are not as we thought. You're going to be surprised at how 
<br />&gt;hot it is down here.......

<br />&gt;With the worst premonition, he read it with trembling hands.
<br /><br />&gt;&gt;
<br />&gt;&gt; Dear Mum and Dad,
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />&gt;&gt; It is with great regret and sorrow that I'm telling you that I've
<br />&gt; eloped with my new boyfriend. I've found real love and he is so nice.
<br />&gt; Especially with all his piercings, scars, tattoos, and his big
<br />&gt;motorcycle. But
<br />&gt; it's not only that, I'm pregnant, and Ahmed said that we will be very
<br />&gt;happy in
<br />&gt; his trailer in the woods. He wants to have many more children with me
<br />&gt;and
<br />&gt; that's one of my dreams.
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />&gt;&gt; I've learned that marijuana doesn't hurt anyone and we'll be growing
<br />&gt; it for us and his friends. They're the one's providing us with all the
<br />&gt; cocaine and ecstasy we could ever want. In the meantime, we'll pray
<br />&gt;for science to
<br />&gt; find the AIDS cure, so Ahmed gets better. He deserves it.
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />&gt;&gt; Don' t worry about money. Ahmed has arranged for me to be in films
<br />&gt; that his friends Leroy and Jamal make in their basement. Apparently I
<br />&gt;can earn
<br />&gt; ..50 a scene. I get a ..50 bonus if there are more than three men in the
<br />&gt; scene, and an extra ..100 if they use the horse.
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />&gt;&gt; Don't worry Mum. Now I'm 15 years old, I know how to take care of
<br />&gt; myself.
<br />&gt;&gt; Someday I'll visit you and Dad so that you can meet your
<br />&gt; grandchildren.
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />&gt;&gt; Your loving daughter,
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />&gt;&gt; Aimee
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br /><br />p.s: Dad, it's not true. I'm watching TV at a neighbour's house. I
<br />&gt; just wanted to show you that there are worse things in life than
<br />&gt;ENGLAND 
<br />&gt; GETTING BEATEN ON BLOODY PENALTIES AGAIN. 
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />&gt;&gt; I love you. Aimee

<br /><br />When he finally returned home on Sunday night, he ran into a barrage of abuse from his wife. After a couple of hours of nagging and berating, his wife asked &quot;How would you like it if you didn't see me for a couple of days?&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;That would suit me just fine!!!&quot; the man said. 
<br /><br />Monday went by, and the man didn't see his wife. 
<br />Tuesday went by with the same result. 
<br />Wednesday went by with the same result. 
<br /><br />Thursday, the swelling went down a bit and he could see her a little, just out of the corner of his left eye!

The man wrenched the cork free and, to his astonishment, there was a cloud of smoke and a clap of thunder.
<br /><br />Standing before him was a genie. &quot;As a reward for freeing me, I shall grant you three wishes,&quot; said the genie, &quot;But understand, whatever you wish for, your most hated enemy shall receive twice over.&quot; The man's most hated enemy happened to be his next door neighbor, Jones.
<br /><br />&quot;Let's see. My first wish is...&quot; He looked at his weather beaten bungalow, &quot;...to live in a ten story luxury mansion.' The genie clapped his hands and suddenly his minute shack transformed into the most beautiful house he had ever laid eyes on. He heard a cry of astonishment from next door and looked over to see Jones standing in the doorway of his new twenty story mansion.
<br /><br />&quot;Now I want fifty of the most beautiful women imaginable.&quot; said the man. There was a puff of smoke and his wish was granted. He was annoyed, however, to see Jones grinning and waving, surrounded by his own harem of 100 women, all twice as attractive.
<br /><br />&quot;What is your final wish, Master?' asked the genie. &quot;I want to lose a testicle,&quot; said the man.

<br /><br />After they crawl out of their cars, the woman says, &quot;So you're a man. That's interesting. I'm a woman... Wow! Just look at our cars. There's nothing left, but fortunately we are unhurt. This must be a sign from God that we should meet and be friends and live together in peace the rest of our days.&quot; 
<br /><br />The man replied, &quot; I agree with you completely; this must be a sign from God!&quot; 
<br /><br />The woman continued, &quot;And look at this - here's another miracle. My car is completely demolished but this bottle of wine didn't break. Surely God wants us to drink this wine and celebrate our good fortune.&quot; 
<br /><br />Then she hands the bottle to the man. The man shakes his head in agreement, opens it and takes a few big swigs from the bottle, then handing it back to the woman. The woman takes the bottle, immediately puts the cap back on, and hands it back to the man. 
<br /><br />The man asks, &quot;Aren't you having any?&quot; The woman replies, &quot;No. I think I will just wait for the police...&quot;

After a perfect courtship, they had a perfect wedding. Their life together was, of course, perfect. One snowy, stormy Christmas Eve, this perfect couple was driving their perfect car (a Grand Caravan) along a winding road, when they noticed someone at the side of the road in distress. Being the perfect couple, they stopped to help. There stood Santa Claus with a huge bundle of toys. Not wanting to disappoint any children on the eve of Christmas, the perfect couple loaded Santa and his toys into their vehicle. Soon they were driving along delivering toys. Unfortunately, the driving conditions deteriorated and the perfect couple and Santa Claus had an accident. Only one of them survived the accident. The mind numbing  question is: Who was the survivor?
<br /><br />Scroll down for the answer...
<br /><br />The perfect woman survived. She's the only one who really existed in the first place. Everyone knows there is no Santa Claus and there is no such thing as a perfect man. Women stop reading here. That is the end of the joke.
<br /><br />Men keep'a scrollin'...
<br /><br />So, if there is no perfect man and no Santa Claus, the perfect woman must have been driving. And that explains why there was a car accident. By the way, if you're a woman and you're reading this, this illustrates another point: Women never listen, either.

<br /><br />After a sip of his Martini, the doctor said, &quot;You know, tomorrow is my anniversary. I bought my wife a diamond ring and a new Mercedes. I figure if she doesn't like the diamond ring, then at least she will like the Mercedes, and she will know that I love her.&quot;
<br /><br />After finishing his scotch, the lawyer said, &quot;Well, on my last anniversary, I bought my wife a string of pearls and a trip to the Bahamas. I figured if she didn't like the pearls, then at least she would have enjoyed the trip, and she would have known that I loved her.&quot;
<br /><br />The biker then took a big swig from his beer, and said, &quot;Yeah, well for my anniversary, I got my old lady a t-shirt and a vibrator. I figured if she didn't like the t-shirt, then she could go f*** herself.&quot;

<br /><br />Women will drive miles out of their way to avoid the possibility of getting lost using a shortcut.
<br /><br />Women do NOT want an honest answer to the question, 'How do I look?'
<br /><br />PMS stands for: Permissible Man-Slaughter (or at least men think it means that). PMS also stands for Preposterous Mood Swings and Punish My
<br />Spouse.
<br /><br />The first naked man a woman sees is 'Ken'.
<br /><br />Women will make three right-hand turns to avoid making one left-hand turn.
<br /><br />'Oh, nothing,' has an entirely different
<br />meaning in woman-language than it does in man-language.
<br /><br />Women cannot use a map without turning the map to correspond to the direction that they are heading.
<br /><br />If it is not Valentine's Day and you see a man in a flower shop, you can probably start up a conversation by asking, 'What did you do?'
<br /><br />Only women understand the reason for 'guest towels' and the 'good china'.
<br /><br />All women seek equality with men until it comes to sharing the closet, taking out the trash, and picking up the check.
<br /><br />If a man ticks off a woman she will often respond by getting a fuzzy toilet cover which warms their rear, but makes it impossible for the lid to stay up thus it constantly gets peed on by the guys (which gets them in More trouble).
<br /><br />Women never check to see if the lid is up. They seem to prefer taking a flying butt leap towards the bowl and then chewing men out because they 'left the seat up' instead of taking two seconds and lowering it themselves.
<br /><br />Women can get out of speeding tickets by
<br />pouting. This will get men arrested.
<br /><br />Men can never catch women checking out other men; women will always catch men checking out other women.

<br /><br />&quot;No, it's not that. This day is the worst of my life. First, I fall asleep, and I go late to my office. My boss, outrageous, fires me. When I leave the building, to my car, I found out it was stolen. The police said that they can do nothing. I get a cab to return home, and when I leave it, I remember I left my wallet and credit cards there. The cab driver just drives away.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;I go home, and when I get there, I find my wife in bed with the gardener. I leave home, and come to this bar. And just when I was thinking about putting an end to my life, you show up and drink my poison.&quot;
