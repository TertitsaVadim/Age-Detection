However, as business IT support customers become increasingly more sophisticated, the realization of thin clients is now of great importance.
<br /><br />What are thin clients?
<br /><br />Thin clients</strong> are computing devices that function as an access device on a network. These solid-state devices connect over an IT network support system to a server where the bulk of the processing takes place.
<br /><br />They have no hard drive, allowing for more secure storage of data and applications on the server. In fact, keystrokes, mouse events and screen images are all that is sent between the client and server. This makes them a more secure <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5pbnRlbGxla3QuY29tLmF1L2l0LXN1cHBvcnQuaHRtbA__" target="_blank">business IT support</a>   system.
<br /><br /><strong>Ultimate Benefit:
<br /><br />Lower total cost of ownership</strong>
<br /><br />With a longer useful lifespan, thin clients contribute to cost savings. According to a study by Gartner (TCO Comparison of PCs with Server-Based Computing, June 2006) thin client <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5pbnRlbGxla3QuY29tLmF1Lw__" target="_blank">small business IT</a>   TCO annual savings have been measured as high as:
<br /><br /><strong> &gt;&gt; 79% less downtime cost per user
<br />  &gt;&gt; 16% capital cost savings
<br />  &gt;&gt; 34% less in maintenance
<br />  &gt;&gt; 19% less to operate
<br />  &gt;&gt; 48% overall lower total cost
<br /><br />When to consider a thin client solution?</strong>
<br /><br />Thin clients are the right business IT support solution for businesses concerned with:
<br /><br /><strong> &gt;&gt; Desktop replacement costs
<br />  &gt;&gt; IT Network Support Security
<br />  &gt;&gt; Data Access to mobile or remote workers
<br />  &gt;&gt; Supporting application software on diverse hardware
<br />  &gt;&gt; Ensuring business data remains accessible and secure 24/7</strong>

Did you know that you can just have one server for all of these and enjoy a more convenient and fast performing server?
<br />Yes, you read it right.
<br />With the need to cut technical cost without sacrificing quality and dependability, you need a business IT support option that could help you cut your IT cost. And presently, Intellekt, one of the most trusted IT companies Melbourne has offered the perfect alternative to resolve this challenge. And that is through server virtualization.
<br />With server virtualization, each of your servers will be combined and hosted on one high performing and powerful server which can provide better performance than from what you are currently experiencing.
<br />The best thing about virtual technology is that small business IT services are run in 2 different physical machines. So when one physical server fails or needs servicing, the other automatically picks up the slack.
<br />Furthermore, IT network support virtualization has a built-in disaster recovery plan. If something untoward should happen, the virtualized small business IT server images can be fully and instantly restored. Even the active directory and exchange server can be retrieved in less than an hour by rebuilding the virtual server from the virtual server image.
<br />So just imagine how much you can save with only one small business IT server to maintain, support and power. The annual hardware maintenance cost alone on your old business IT support server and hardware would be enough to pay for all of the new hardware! 
<br />Moreover, you will also have a cleaner IT network support server room after the migration. Thus, server virtualization can also give you more room for your growing small business IT data and technology requirements.
<br />Discover how your business can benefit from business IT support server virtualization service. You can even try it for 2 hours FREE!
