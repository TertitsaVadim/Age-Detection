Some of the data that should be easily accessible to the visitors are contact details, procedure for purchase and ordering products or services.
<br />Site Functionality: Website functionality is another important point. The most important issue that relates to functionality are slow loading, long duration of download and page errors.
<br />Search engine optimization: One of the most important factors that relates to ecommerce design is search engine optimization.

This article will provide you with some quick tips that you should consider while purchasing a shopping cart for your online business. Some of them are listed below:

Unfortunately, this fee may vary widely. In other words, the fee really depends upon what is accepted at that particular point in time.

Hence, the primary problem is that, not every shopping cart supports, all merchant accounts. Thus, you must not put yourself in a position where, you find yourself integrating a shopping cart into your e commerce site, that refuses to process transactions using your merchant account. Hence, research is the key to preventing such a disaster.

<br /><br />It is very similar to a Point of Sale in any real world shop. The Point of Sale is a basic terminal that is found at every brick and mortar retail outlet. The <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5lY29tbWVyY2V3ZWJzaXRlZGV2ZWxvcGVycy5jb20vcGF5bWVudC1nYXRld2F5LWludGVncmF0aW9uLnBocA__" target="_blank"><strong>payment gateway service</strong></a> is also provided by a number of banking institutions and e-commerce sites as well today.
<br /><br />The main role of the payment gateway is security. It helps to encrypt any crucial and sensitive credit card information, like the credit card number. It also helps to send these details through a secured network from the shopper to the merchant and from the merchant to the payment processor.
<br /><br />The process of linking any e-commerce store with a payment gateway is known as payment gateway integration.
<br /><br />How does the payment gateway work?
<br /><br />1. Once the customer chooses an item for purchase, he or she will submit an order, which will be sent in an encrypted form to the merchants server. This SSL encryption is present to assure the customer that the data that is being transmitted is secure.
<br />2. The same information is then passed on to the gateway.
<br />3. The transaction details will then be passed on to the merchant's bank.
<br />4. The bank in turn, will then send these details to an issuing bank (the bank that has initially issued the credit card to the customer).
<br />5. Once the details are received, the issuing bank will then send the response to the online gateway whether the payment should be accepted or not. If the payment should not be accepted, the reason for non-acceptance will also be sent.
<br />6. This information is then passed on to the gateway, and from there the merchants server.
<br />7. This response will then be sent to the customer in an encrypted form to inform the customer whether his or her order was successful or not.
<br />8. If successful, the issuing bank will then deposit the money in the merchant's account.
<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5lY29tbWVyY2V3ZWJzaXRlZGV2ZWxvcGVycy5jb20vcGF5bWVudC1nYXRld2F5LWludGVncmF0aW9uLnBocA__" target="_blank"><strong>Online payment gateways</strong></a> are essential, as without these systems, the payment of products and services that are being purchased online would not be possible.

Different combinations work differently for different sites. Hence, testing is the keyword.
<br /><br />But there are 7 promotion methods employed by many e-commerce websites:
<br /><br />PR: PR is mainly about using newspapers, magazines and e-zines to tell prospective customers about your site. But don't be fooled. This particular task is not as easy as it seems, for editors demand interesting stories. In other words, to get inked, your stories need a twist. But you must always remember that ink is gold.
<br /><br />Referrals: If you have a great E-commerce site, your visitors may want to tell their friends about it. Hence, make it easy for them to send emails to invite their friends to your site.
<br /><br />Print Ads: Its always a great idea to run small ads in publications that are carefully targeted for your customers. However, the message must be kept small. The key is to begin with a cheaper classified ad in some of the best publications.
<br /><br />Banner Ads: Create a nice banner and then watch the orders roll in. But always make sure your banners work for you. Hence, create high quality banners and run them on well-targeted sites.

Information which is relevant to your web site will help attract visitors. Also, search engines love information in bulk.
<br /><br />Unique meta tags for each page: The meta tags for any web site include the title of the web page, its description along with the keywords. A good SEO practice always insists on using the the first targeted keyword at the very beginning of the title. The keyword tag would include all the keywords you have used in your web page. The ranking should be in order of relevancy from first to last. The description tag should not be more than 10-15 words describing only the page. It is always advisable to have a separate meta tag for every web page.
<br /><br />Submitting your site to search engines: A good <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5lY29tbWVyY2V3ZWJzaXRlZGV2ZWxvcGVycy5jb20v" target="_blank">eCommerce web site development</a> practice includes submission of the web site to all the major search engines.

So, you have your business plan in place and you have identified the best marketing niche for your business. Your marketing strategies are raring to go. Your hosting service and domain name are all in place. The only thing missing is a web design layout. And although it seems like a good move to hire the services of a good web design company, it is very important to first put in a little effort before you go ahead and hire a professional.
<br /><br />The simple fact is that nobody else knows the workings of your business like you do. You are the only one who knows what appearance your site should have. And although a good designer can bring forth the visual elements, only you will know what really appeals to your niche audience. What's more, you may also know all the marketing tricks that can help you rank high in the search engines. These factors are not what your designer would give to you. What a designer can do is provide you with a pretty page to attract more visitors. And this is why it is very important for you to take active interest in the workings of your website.
<br /><br />Start with your page composition. Your home page should ideally be inviting and still fulfill your sales objectives. Once your visitor clicks on your page and visits the home page, you should make sure that they can see what your sales offerings are immediately, without being required to scroll down. A good web design layout will make your sales points immediately visible to the visitor. Your value propositions should be found easily. So start by designing a layout in your mind. How and where you place your ads is another very important component. Your ads should clearly display what you want your visitors to see.
<br /><br />You must also think of the type of software that may affect your <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5hbnV2YXNvZnQuY29tL3NlYXJjaC1lbmdpbmUtb3B0aW1pemF0aW9uLmh0bWw_" target="_blank">search engine rankings</a>. Flash videos and slide shows are problematic. The search engine spiders cannot read Flash, thus doing absolutely nothing for your rankings. Consider the different kinds of browsers. When you talk to a web designer, ask them what kinds of problems are associated with different browsers. Most people tend to use Internet Explorer. However, Opera and Firefox are very close contenders as well. Each of these browsers would display your website differently. So, if your website can only accommodate Internet Explorer, then you are going to lose out on all the customers who use Firefox and Opera.
<br /><br />So, make sure you think about the web design before you avail the services of a <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5hbnV2YXNvZnQuY29tL29mZnNob3JlLWRlZGljYXRlZC10ZWFtLmh0bWw_" target="_blank">web designer</a>, so as to avoid encountering such problems.
