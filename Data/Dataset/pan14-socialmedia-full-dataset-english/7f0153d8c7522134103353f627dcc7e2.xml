Before buying replacement kitchen doors, have a good think about what style you want, and especially why you no longer want your existing kitchen doors. If they're simply looking tired and tatty, then you could replace like for like if you're happy with the style and shade. However if they're just looking out of date or simply no longer suit your kitchen, then you need to imagine your kitchen in a new light. This is the hard part. <br /><br />Instead of just looking through a catalogue of doors, or searching for different styles of kitchen doors online and choosing a style you like; put down the catalogue or turn off the PC and go into your kitchen. Maybe your old kitchen cupboards are looking tired because they don't look right since you invested in a cappuccino maker, food processor or other kitchen gadgets which sit in pride of place on your worktops. Maybe the new floor or wall covering are making them look out of place? By looking at what is already present in your kitchen can make it much easier for you to decide which style of new doors will work best. For example, retro styling which is reminiscent of 1950's and 1960's kitchen appliances are in vogue at the moment, so choosing replacement kitchen doors which echo this era may work better than county style or ultra modern cabinet doors.<br /><br />If you're the type of home maker who like everything hidden away leaving uncluttered and spacious worktops, then maybe sleek and featureless doors will help streamline your kitchen. Even the style of the cupboard or drawer handles can have a significant impact on the overall feel of your kitchen, and thanks to some innovative door and drawer furniture, having no handles at all is possible these days. One benefit of searching for new doors online is that some websites have a 'kitchen builder' feature which allows one to build their existing kitchen in the virtual world and try all the different types of kitchen doors and drawer fronts so you can get an idea of how they will look. If you start with what you already have rather than relying on the catalogue for ideas, then finding the perfect replacement doors will be an easy and enjoyable task.<br /><br />Would you like to see some great deals on  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.doorsandfittings.co.uk"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.doorsandfittings.co.uk</a> ?

He asked if I needed and help so I suggested he could get some condiments from the cupboard next to which he stood. He turned to open the cupboard but having no visible handle, he was instantly confused as to how it should open. After a quick grumble about me needing some handles fitting, I told him to simply push the door and it would pop open. He did this and was instantly amazed at how it worked. “Ee it's good that innit!” He exclaimed as he observed the magic magnetic catch.<br /><br />I had to chuckle to myself, but my father in law is by no means the first person to be baffled by my handle free kitchen units. I’d seen them on several home design shows on the TV and loved the idea of having no handles at all, so I found out who manufacture these stealthy latches and came across a company called Blum Hinges. Often these little innovations are vastly over priced but I had to double check when I started costing for an entire new set of kitchen cabinet doors and drawers using Tip-On door latches from Blum Hinges. Costing only a few pounds each, yet needing one or two for each door and drawer meant the cost would build up significantly, however bearing in mind that I’d not be paying for door or drawer handles made them positively affordable. <br /><br />My new kitchen doors looked fantastic when first installed but it took me a few days to get used to the fact there were no handles to grab hold of; I kept nearing the door or drawer ready to grasp hold of something, only realising at the last second that handles are a thing of the past. After a few days I’d got used to giving each door or drawer a gentle push to open it, however most of my friends and some members of my family still struggle to become accustomed to this new and innovative way of opening my cabinet doors and drawers. Admittedly they have mixed reactions from “oh that's clever” to “I'd never get used to not having handles”. Personally I’d never go back to having handles on my kitchen doors and drawers because thanks to Blum Hinges, I love my sleek and streamlined kitchen; the only problem is finding somewhere to hang my tea towel!<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.doorsandfittings.co.uk"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.doorsandfittings.co.uk</a>  are very popular worldwide!

It's not that they are necessarily scared of the process of looking at used cars for sale, or even buying a used car online, it's more about the unknown of doing such a large purchase online. If they are looking to buy a used BMW online they are essentially buying a machine that will cost them a couple of thousand pounds at the very least, to purchase. That is not chump change, and thus they have a hard time with the idea of buying it, site unseen, online.<br />With that said, it makes a whole lot of sense to buy a used BMW online. Compared to just heading down to the local used car lot, looking for used cars online gives you a much better selection and, surprisingly, more info then you would have if you just look local. Plus, since most used car companies put their inventory online, you can look at the same cars as you would without having to drive down there and deal with the car dealers. Plus, you can always take a look at the car before you buy it, so it's not like you are actually going to buy anything without looking at it.<br />So how do you get over this uncertainty and fear that goes along with making such a large purchase online? The key is to be able to use the logic you would put towards any other online purchase you would make. If you don't think a website is trustworthy, or they are making offers that are too good to be true, skip them. If you wouldn't buy a shirt from a website that you don’t trust than why would you buy a used BMW from one?<br />The truth is, you want to make sure you are buying from the right source when you are looking for a great used BMW. This means that you may have to take your time and skip some deals that seem good, but not &quot;right.&quot; Also, you don't want to find yourself driving halfway across the country to have a look at a used car you may or may not buy as not only will it take up the best part of a day, but will also cost a fortune in petrol or diesel. Shop local from the comfort of your own home, take your time and you'll eventually get where you are going, you just need to be patient.<br /><br />If you want to find out more information on  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.buyyourcar.co.uk%2Fused-car%2Fbmw"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.buyyourcar.co.uk/used-car/bmw</a>  or even just to have a look at our great selection of  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.buyyourcar.co.uk%2Fused-car"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.buyyourcar.co.uk/used-car</a>  then make sure to visit us.

Most consumers will spend some time doing research from home gathering more information about the specific purchase that they want to make. As they read and research, they will likely find information or look at enough pictures that they may move from their original first choice. They appreciate having a full range of choices and going from source to source as they shop comfortably from the home. <br /><br />Shopping for products online is now not unusual and most households are participating. Consumers are liking the fact that they can shop at their own pace and not be limited by certain hours or locations. They have noticed that this is also true in shopping for new cars. There is no pressure from any salesman as you shop online. Anyone can take their time browsing and reading information on the particulars. As they feel ready, they can take themselves to the next level. <br /><br />People have already discovered how convenient it is to shop for used cars by checking out the daily ads on Craig's List. Many have had success stories although most will advise to be careful. When buying used cars online it's always advisable to give the car a test drive where possible. When test driving a second hand car have a look under the bonnet before and afterwards as any signs of leakage may have been cleaned off by the seller, and if serious, will be apparent after a good test drive. Now many have ventured to look for their new cars the same way. <br /><br />Since all of the dealerships now use their own websites to advertise, shoppers can have the best of both worlds. There will be less to worry about since the dealership is already established and has developed a reputation for good service. You can compare the information from the dealerships by reading the official website of the particular car brand that you are interested in buying. Once you feel confident that they are both on the same page, you can reinforce that all information is accurate by searching for new and used cars reviewed by speciality sites. If the dealership is local, you can go in person to pick it up. If you have found your dream car at another location, the dealership can ship and deliver to a local dealership or directly to your home sometimes. <br /><br />If you want to look at a great selection of  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.buyyourcar.co.uk%2Fnew-car"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.buyyourcar.co.uk/new-car</a>  or  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.buyyourcar.co.uk%2Fused-car"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.buyyourcar.co.uk/used-car</a> , then make sure to visit us!

It can happen out of nowhere: one second you are driving around care free, and the next moment there is a grinding or popping sound coming from the inside of your auto. These sounds can mean an expensive trip to your auto repair shop which is not something that you or your wallet want to think about. The thing is though, a lot of issues that occur with your car can be taken care of on your own, and for a lot less money than taking your car to a repair shop. While most auto repair shops are fair, they also charge you for the fitting or installation of a said part. While it's a fair charge, it's an extra charge that you don't have to deal with if you put the spare part in place yourself.<br />Of course, you need to know what you are doing if you are going to install your own car parts. While there are some parts that are easier to install than others, there are a variety of things that a novice can do on their own with just a few minutes of research. While you may not be able to put in new gaskets, you should be able to put in your own brake pads or change your oil.<br />While the big savings comes from installation costs, you are still going to need to purchase car parts. The good news is that the Internet makes it easier than ever to find the car parts that you need. No matter if you are looking for something obvious or really hard to find. In addition, since most of the online car shops don't have a store front to pay for, they can sell parts, new and used, for a lot less than you would find in the stores. You can find car spares and parts for 25-60% less than you would find at any 'brick and mortar' store.<br />The key to finding the right price on car parts and spares is to do your research. The more that you look the better off you will be when it comes to price. Remember: it's easier to install parts than you think, especially once you get the hang of it. You may have to invest in some tools such as good quality spanners and wrenches, but in the long term it's a great way to save money in these tough times.<br /><br />If you’re looking for  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.buyyourcar.co.uk%2Fcar-parts"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.buyyourcar.co.uk/car-parts</a>  or  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.buyyourcar.co.uk%2Fcar-parts"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.buyyourcar.co.uk/car-parts</a> .

Drive a car for few years and decide if this is the car you can not live without, then when the lease comes to an end, you can choose to lease a brand new version of the same model of car or try out a different model of car to lease.<br />If you are looking for a good van lease they have great deals on van leasing in the UK.

In the early 1950's, Laura and her husband Bernard lived in Pimlico, central London where Laura supplemented her income designing head scarves, napkins and tea towels which were printed on a machine designed by her engineering husband Bernard. She found inspiration in the Victoria and Albert Museum for Victorian influenced designs, but having little in the way of examples of Victorian samples with which she could work, led her to designing and printing her own range of Victorian influenced head scarves. These proved hugely popular, which a variety of high street stores stocking them.<br /><br />Laura and Bernard soon gave up their main jobs to concentrate of the fabric design and print business. Laura was in charge of the design side where as Bernard handled the operational side of the business. Together they proved to be an exception team and the business soon gained global recognition. Since Laura Ashley's death in 1985, the company branched out into interior and fashion design after Laura's patterns became popular in women's clothing and on upholstery. Currently the company designs lighting, upholstery, mirrors, towels ceramic wall tiles, fireplaces, fashion collections and much more.<br /><br />Laura Ashley tiles are one of the most extensive ranges of designer tiles, having more than 40 different designs currently available. Many designs are based on the Victorian inspired patterns which Laura began designing in the early 1950's, with more modern designs catering for a more contemporary market. Laura Ashley tiles encompass all aspects of both natural and ceramic tiles, borrowing inspiration from natural stone, ancient mosaics, art deco and Greek scroll work and even beach inspired ceramic tiles in the form of the 'pebble' ceramic tile. <br /><br />Imagination is your only limitation as this vast range of ceramic wall tiles caters for a variety of tastes. Laura Ashley tiles are equally at home in the kitchen as well as in the bathroom, and would also be perfectly suited to an entrance hall or vestibule.

The vast majority of quartz tiles currently available on the market today are manufactured, or engineered by bonding fragments of quartz with a resin which is far more resilient then tiles cut from a block of solid quartz.  Although kitchen counter tops and tiles can be cut from 100% natural quartz, the engineered quartz is made from 95% quartz and 5% resin. Test have shown that engineered quartz has greater impact resistance due to the resin content and therefore is a better material than its natural cousin. <br /><br />The beauty of engineered quartz lies within its versatility as a variety of colourings can be incorporated into the resin, allowing for red, green, blue, black or white quartz tiles. Colouring the resin in this way has paved the way for a much wider variety than was previously available prior to the development of engineered quartz, and this has proved to be very popular with consumers. Not only is a wider variety of colours and shades available with the manufactured quartz, it also is non porous which means it does not require sealing as many natural stones do.<br /><br />Quartz tiles are available in a variety of sizes, from large 600mm square tiles down to small mosaic tiles. Mixing tiles of differing sizes can create some interesting patterns, as can mixing up the available colours too. Mixing alternate white and black quartz tiles gives the classic chess board effect, however this design is considered old hat and something of a cliché by many tilers and interior designers. The current vogue with regards to implementing a pattern in tiling tends to be more abstract in nature. For example, using mainly white quartz tiles with the other colours placed intermittently, almost randomly throughout the white tiles provides an interesting and accessible design without being 'obvious'. <br /><br />If you are mixing up the colours, try not to use too many as 'tutti fruity' seldom looks good once the novelty has worn off. Instead try to limit your palate the same as you would if painting your sitting room; one main colour and no more than two contrasting or complementary colours. In large or well lit lit rooms you could get away with using a majority of black quartz tiles, accented with a frieze or border of bright red, orange or green tiles. With so many colours to choose from it's easy to get adventurous, however like any aspect of interior design, less is often more.<br /><br />For  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.buytiles.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.buytiles.com</a>  or  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.buytiles.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.buytiles.com</a> .

Everybody loves the look of parquet flooring and possibly the popularity of laminate flooring is due to it being considered a more affordable alternative to proper parquet flooring. However flooring is nothing of the sort. It is no close second nor is it a distant cousin... it's an abomination!  It may look like wood, but it's not wood. It's a photocopy of wood, sandwiched between a clear thin slither of plastic, some bonded wood dust (so they can call it 'wood' of sorts), a bit of glue and a bit of resin. <br /><br />Not all laminate flooring is this poor, as some do have real wood on the top, about a millimetres' worth. But the cost of this 'real' laminate flooring as far more than the stuff most people are currently buying. What annoys me most about flooring is its inability to cope with moisture. It's a thirsty product and when used on the kitchen or bathroom you'll soon find areas where it's swelling and even peeling apart. <br /><br />When people buy this product it's as if they've forgotten the true purpose of a kitchen or bathroom floor covering. That being its resilience to water and moisture. Old fashioned linoleum would have been better as at least it creates a barrier. If you're hell bent on spending money then why not go the whole hog and buy marble tiles instead of laminate flooring?  At least you know they wont be swelling or peeling after a few years and in some cases, a few months!<br /><br />What annoys me most about laminate floors is the owners seem to think they've got all the class of a hardwood floor but without the cost. When I walk into a room with a laminate floor I think it's got all the class of a stick of Blackpool rock yet costs a damn site more than 5p.  If you want class then you're going to have to dig deep and buy it. If you want to out class your neighbours then choosing cappuccino marble tiles or dark emporador marble tiles instead of cheap and tacky laminates is a good way to go.   Marble tiles are far superior to flooring, lino, carpet tiles and even ceramic floor tiles as they're naturally hard wearing, naturally beautiful, naturally water resistant and will outlast probably the rest of your house, unlike the laminates which are lucky to last you a year.<br />Like marble?

Granite is a volcanic rock formed from magma deep in the Earth's crust which heats existing rocks to melting pint combining with the magma which gives the rock its distinctive speckled or grainy appearance. As this cools, quartz crystals are formed giving granite its defining ingredient. Granite is currently only known on Earth and astro-geologists, being those who study rock formations on other planets, are yet to discover granite like rock formations outside of our blue planet. However seeing as granite is the bedrock of Earth, forming a major part of the continental crust, I’m sure granite like rocks do exist in the far reaches of space.<br /><br />Here on Earth granite has been the mainstay of the construction industry since at least the time of ancient Egypt. Granite is both ubiquitous and workable which meant the rock could be quarried and hewn within a reasonable distance of the structure it was being used for. The great pyramids of Gaza are hewn from local granite, as are the pyramids of south America and many ancient structures throughout Asia are also constructed from granite.  Granite was not only used for huge foundation or construction stones, as it was also commonly carved into statues, the most famous being the Sphinx, and split into granite tiles too throughout the ancient world.<br /><br />It wasn't for many hundreds of years that granite began to be polished to give it a smooth glass like finish, and it was only then that the true beauty of granite was revealed. The high quartz content gave the stone a sparkle which other common building materials such as marble and limestone did not have. Although marble was commonly used as wall and floor tiles, the ubiquity of granite throughout the ancient world paved the way for dominance of granite floor tiles. Being readily available and incredibly hard wearing, it's no wonder Mesopotamia, parts of Africa and Asia are littered with numerous examples of granite construction and decorative features such as granite tiles. <br /><br />More recently the huge variety of granites throughout the world has become more accessible and as such, its popularity has grown considerably, especially in domestic use. With better quarrying techniques and more effective polishing, granite floor tiles are becoming more popular than man made ceramics. Granites with an unusually high quartz content or commonly used as tiles, commonly known as galaxy granite tiles due to their resemblance to a night time star scape. Granite tiles is probably the most common use for most quarried granites these days as splitting the granite into thin tiles is far more profitable than using the same block as a single building block. Being the second hardest natural rock on the planet, it's no wonder granite has been used for millenia and is likely to be favoured for many years to come. <br />If you are in need of some  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.buytiles.com%2Ftiles-by-material%2Fgranite.php"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.buytiles.com/tiles-by-material/granite.php</a> , then make sure to visit us!

Of course tiles are available in a variety of colours, but they don't come cheap and getting them professionally fitted only adds to the expense. So it's not surprising that many get cold feet and choose the safe, classic white tiles as opting for the bold blue or vibrant green tiles may not work as well as you'd hoped. And if the tiles are fitted by a professional tiler, choosing the wrong colour could be a costly error of judgement. <br /><br />If you're bored of white tiles but feel choosing a colour may be a little too much on the eye, how about looking at some of the more unusual tiles which are available. For example, mosaic tiles can be used exclusively or as a border or frieze. If you're thinking the tiny mosaic tiles will be tricky to fit, then think again, as they come in sheet form which makes their installation a doddle, even for the amateur DIYer. Being available in a wide variety of colours, including white, cream, pink and beige for those of us who like a simple colour scheme, mosaic tiles offer a welcome break from the norm without being too adventurous.<br /><br />Travertine sounds like a type of plastic not dissimilar to Melamine, but it couldn't be more different. Travertine is a natural lime stone which forms around hot springs and is popular in construction. It's colour ranges from white to cream and pale beige and being a naturally porous stone gives it a unique surface. Travertine tiles are popular because of its unique appearance, which is further enhanced by filling the pores with a resin to give them a smooth surface. Travertine tiles adorn the lobby of the Willis (AKA Sears) Tower in Chicago and is a favourite amongst architects and designers.<br /><br />Adding a little sparkle to what would normally be a plain bathroom can really bring it to life. Sparkly tiles are available in a wide variety colours, finishes and materials including ceramics, quartz and granite. White or cream quartz tiles offer a bright reflective surface which are favoured in many bathrooms and the sparkly and shiny flecks of quartz or other materials give them a subtle yet distinctive shimmer. Available in mosaic or larger formats, pale sparkly tiles will certainly give your bathroom that wow factor without being overpowering.<br /><br />If you don't want to be too adventurous in your bathroom choosing bold colours or vivid designs, you don't have to settle for plain white or cream tiles. Instead have a look at white or cream travertine tiles, sparkly tiles or adding a mosaic frieze to add interest instead. Just because you don't want to be too adventurous doesn't mean you have to be too boring either.<br /><br />For information on popular tiles. Make sure to visit us!

Ceramic tiles are most commonly used as wall and floor coverings as they are hard wearing, cheap to manufacture and have been in use for many hundreds, if not thousands of years. The word 'tile' derives from the Latin 'tegula' which was their word for a roof tile made from fired clay. Ceramic tiles come in a variety of colours and sizes, from small decorative mosaic tiles, ceramic kitchen tiles and bathroom tiles to large floor tiles. Ceramic tiles usually fall in to one of the following categories:<br /><br />Earthenware is a ceramic fired between 950 &amp; 1150 degrees Celsius. It is very easy to work and decorate and almost always used indoors as glazed wall and floor tiles as its high porosity makes is susceptible to frost damage. Earthenware is manufactured by using one of two methods; single firing, or monoporasa where the glaze and tile are baked and fired simultaneously, and double firing, or biporosa, where the ceramic tile is baked then the glaze is added and the tiles is baked once more, fixing the glaze. Earthenware is generally used for ceramic kitchen tiles and bathroom tiles.<br /><br />Stoneware is far less porous than earthenware as it is fired at temperatures between 1150 &amp; 1300 degrees Celsius, giving at a water absorption rate of less than 3% (as opposed to more than 10% for earthenware). Stoneware is frost proof and as the name suggests, is very hard wearing. It is commonly used as a flooring tile for both indoor and outdoor applications and in such cases is generally not glazed as this would inhibit the natural slip resistance of stoneware. <br /><br />Porcelain Stoneware is even more hard wearing than stoneware. Having a water absorption rate of less than 0.5% gives porcelain stoneware a very low porosity. This allows at to be polished giving it and extraordinarily brilliant surface without the need for glazing. These porcelain tiles are ideal for high traffic outdoor areas such as transport terminals, hotel foyers and shopping precincts. A huge variety of decorative effects can be created due to the unique properties of porcelain stoneware, making it a popular choice for decorative porcelain tiles used within the home.<br />All of the above can be glazed giving the tiles a hard wearing glossy surface in to which both simple and more complicated patterns can be added. The combination of being both hard wearing and visually pleasing has paved the way for ceramics to have become an everyday part of our lives, from crockery and cook ware, to wall and floor coverings and even for both electrical and heat insulation.<br /><br />We can provide all the best information on  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.buytiles.com%2Ftiles-by-application%2Fkitchen.php"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.buytiles.com/tiles-by-application/kitchen.php</a>  as well as  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.buytiles.com%2Ftiles-by-application%2Fkitchen.php"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.buytiles.com/tiles-by-application/kitchen.php</a> .

This fire was also the only source of heat and light, around which the whole family would huddle on cold dark nights. There was no selection of pots and pans, no drawer full of utensils, no oven, no worktop, no sink and certainly no fridge, freezer or washing machine. <br /><br />Right up until the 19th century the kitchen was a very smoky environment in which to work as chimneys weren't common in many of the lower class dwellings. The oven or 'range' had not yet been developed so cooking was done around an open fire, with a pot suspended above the flames and a spit for roasting meat placed in front. It was only with the advent of the closed range that the kitchen became a smoke free environment and began to resemble the modern kitchen with racks of cooking utensils, cutlery and crockery. <br /><br />With homes being built with water pipes feeding fresh water directly into the home and waste pipes feeding waste water into the sewerage system allowed the modern kitchen to take shape. For the first time in its history the kitchen became a clean and hygienic place in which to prepare food and as the range became more affordable, the lower classes were able to take advantage of developments which were once only available to the middle and upper classes.<br /><br />As social standards aired towards more hygienic living standards, the old wooded worktops were replaced with Formica or granite worktops and around the range or oven kitchen wall tiles were added to make the area much easier to clean than the old bare walls. These advances sparked the concept of the designer kitchen and as the scullery maids and cooks grew out of fashion, putting the housewife centre stage in her own kitchen. <br /><br />These days we spend more money on our kitchen than any other room in the house. Ever since electricity entered our homes we've had an insatiable appetite for kitchen gadgetry such as the toaster, the food mixer and of course the electric oven, fridge, freezer and washing machine. However these appliances were not enough to give our kitchens the identity they longed for. <br /><br />Kitchen wall tiles became a more decorative feature than a functional one as the kitchen became a room in which to socialise as well as prepare food. The old Formica or granite worktops were replaced with the more fashionable marble or quartz worktops and everything had to match. So much so that some kitchens had matching cutlery and crockery, matching pots, pans and utensils, even the kitchen wall tiles matched the granite or quartz worktops in some kitchens and as tastes changed, so did the entire kitchen. <br /><br />These days it's not uncommon for ones kitchen to receive a make over with new cabinet doors and drawer fronts, new tiles and wall coverings, new flooring, new everything!  The modern kitchen is the pride of every housewife (or husband) and the heart of every home.<br /><br />For The very best worktops, make sure to visit us.

I'm sure most of us have heard stories from their parents or grand parents about bathing in a tin bath in front of the fire in the sitting room, or having to make do with an outside privy in the bleak midwinter. It was during the late nineteenth century that a dedicated bathroom became a feature in homes of the middle and upper classes, however the plumbing and ceramics were prohibitively expensive for the working classes and hence, the old tin bath overstayed its welcome for many years.<br /><br />Although the early 20th century saw the introduction of a dedicated bathroom in all new build homes, the 1951 census revealed that one in three homes in the UK still didn't have a plumbed in bath tub and even more still relied on an outside toilet. This, amongst other contributing factors led to further slum clearances which began in the 1930's and continued through to the 1960's. The flats and houses which replaced the former slums were all fitted with a fully functioning bathroom and to stop the moisture from steam penetrating the absorbent plaster wall, ceramic bathroom tiles were used. <br /><br />Bathroom wall tiles were necessary as without them the wall paper would quickly peel away, allowing the plaster to become damp. This would eventually harbour mould and fungus which would have obvious disadvantages with regards to health if left unchecked. However many homes failed to take advantage of ceramic tiles due to the costs. Bathroom tiles were also used as floor covering as they offered a good barrier against water seeping through to the floor, however this was soon superseded by linoleum, or lino as it offered a better water barrier. Lino was also much warmer underfoot than cold ceramic bathroom tiles and was therefore more desirable. <br /><br />In spite of the fact that without bathroom tiles a bathroom could quickly become unhygienic due to mould and fungus, many bathrooms made do with a few rows of tiles around the bath and sink. It was only in the 1970's and 1980's when showers became popular that people began tiling their bathroom from floor to ceiling. The increased spray and steam from a shower made the extensive fitting of floor to ceiling bathroom wall tiles essential.<br /><br />Ceramic tiles have been with us since ancient Egypt and were used extensively in Roman bath houses (similar to a sauna). An ancient bath tub dating back to 1700BC was discovered in Crete with similarities to modern bathtubs such as the plughole and plumbing for taps. The first flushing toilet was invented in 1596, however the flushing toilet barely saw the light of day for a further 250 years when they were exhibited at the Great Exhibition of 1851. In light of all these early advances, it's staggering to think that most of us didn't have an indoor bathroom until the 1950's!<br />Make sure you come and have a look at our selection of  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.buytiles.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.buytiles.com</a> .

		<document id="baea69492df11b84b997d8f66aea726e" url=""><![CDATA[The Timeless Beauty of Marble Tiles<br/><br/>When I've holidayed in warmer climates such as Greece, Turkey, Morocco and Spain the marble tiled floor seems to be one of the more popular flooring materials in use. It makes perfect sense in places such as these as with the warm winters and hot summers, having a flooring material which is naturally cool underfoot makes all the difference to the perceived indoor temperature. It's not just the coolness of marble tiles underfoot on hot days that is their main appeal either, as it's the inherent timeless beauty of these natural stone tiles which also makes them a very popular choice of floor covering. Imagine a Mediterranean holiday villa with a linoleum floor... it just wouldn't have the same look, feel and charm which is achieved when using marble tiles.<br /><br />Marble tiles may not immediately spring to mind when deciding on a floor covering in the cooler climes of the United Kingdom, Northern Europe or North America. However marble is an excellent choice in these more northern regions as not only is it much cooler under foot during our short summers, but when installed in conjunction with an underfloor heating systems, it feels warm and cosy and welcoming throughout the long winter months too.  Marble conducts heat very well in comparison to other natural stone products and many ceramics too, which makes marble perfect for under floor heating systems. <br /><br />With so many varieties of marble available, you're not as limited with regards to the design aspect of marble flooring as you may first think. Numerous shades, tones and styles of marble are available from white, cream and pale beige or cappuccino marble tiles, green, yellow and blueish hues, right through to grey, brown and black tiles such as the dark emporador marble tiles. Obviously one can use a variety of the different types of marble available to create patterns in the tiles such as a checker board, a decorative border or frieze to add and extra dimension of interest to your marble floor. Getting adventurous with marble flooring can give any room in the house, be it the entrance hall, kitchen, bathroom or lounge a stylish and unique appearance. Taking inspiration from wooden parquet flooring can make a narrow room feel wider, especially when using contrasting tiles such as cappuccino marble tiles along side dark emporador marble tiles to make the layout more distinct.  Marble offers a timeless beauty which cannot be rivalled with artificial or synthetic floor coverings.<br /><br />For all the best tiles, make sure to visit us!

Why has slate been so popular for many hundreds of years?  Well in the case of North Wales and Northwest England, simply because it's there. OK maybe that's over simplifying things a little too much. Slate is not only found right on the doorstep, it's also easy to split into thin sheets and is low water absorption quality makes it resilient to frost damage and therefore perfect for roofing tiles and bathroom floor tiles. <br /><br />These days much of the slate used in the UK comes from Spain. The former slate mines of North Wales and The Lake District are now museums, however slate can still be sourced from these mines, just not in the large quantities in which it was once mined. Slate tiles, whether they be for the roof, the floor, or as wall tiles are as popular today as they ever were, if not more so as the porosity of some slates can easily be sealed these days making slate tiles far more versatile. Slate is fast becoming a contender for granite as a popular choice of natural stone kitchen worktop. <br /><br />Mainly dark or pale grey in colour, slate also comes with a green, purple, cyan, blue or red hue. These different colours vary depending on where the slate has been quarried. Different densities of slate also occurs in different parts of the world so if you're looking for slate suitable for bathroom floor tiles then the Brazilian or Vermont slates are probably the best option as they have very low absorption and won't necessarily need sealing like the more porous slates require.<br /><br />Slate is ideal for use in conjunction with underfloor heating systems. The tiles can be split thinly and with slate being a good conductor of heat makes slate one of the better natural materials to use in this situation. If you are sealing your floor tiles, then using a water based polyurethane is advisable as it is penetrative, giving a deeper and better seal. A water based polyurethane is also non yellowing and won't crack, so you can rest assured that your slate kitchen or bathroom floor tiles will give you many years of good service. Regardless of where your slate tiles originate; from the mountains of Wales to the quarries of Brazil, slate offers a timeless charm that hard to beat.<br />For  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.buytiles.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.buytiles.com</a>  or  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.buytiles.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.buytiles.com</a> .

Such equipment, when used in the workplace, school or college and public buildings such as shops, restaurants and bars, need to be safe to use by all, regardless of whether they are employers, employees, students or members of the public. All electrical equipment can deteriorate or develop a fault at any point during its working life which could cause injury or death if an appliance goes unchecked and a fault goes unnoticed. <br /><br />In order to ensure that all portable electrical appliances are safe to use, regular portable appliance testing should to be carried out by a suitably competent person. PAT testing is designed to find any potential electrical shock risks or fire hazards which may arise in faulty equipment, to highlight any earthing problems and potential overloading issues as well as identifying any other faults or problems. Each tested appliance deemed safe for use will be given a  'passed' label which is signed and dated by the testing PAT engineer. Any equipment found to be faulty should be either repaired or removed so it cannot be used, as defective electrical equipment can cause injury or death. Should an incident arise and it is found that you, as the person responsible for maintaining the appliances failed to have your electrical equipment PAT tested regularly,  may be in breach of the electricity at work legislation. You may also void your insurance cover.<br /><br />General day to day use can create hazards in many electrical appliances as well as exacerbate existing problems. Portable appliance testing aims to identify any issues which present either an immediate threat, or  a potential threat that could develop into something more serious. Such testing checks that there are no abrasions or cuts in the power cable and that the plug is correctly wired, earthed and the plug casing is intact. PAT testing also checks that the appliance casing is not cracked or damaged and there are no missing parts such as a terminal cover. <br /><br />By using a PAT tester, a qualified PAT engineer can also identify internal issues such as earth continuity and earth leakage tests as well as many other potential issues. Such tests are essential when providing safe environment for all, however bear in mind that a piece of electrical equipment can develop a fault at any time, regardless of how recently it has been PAT tested. If an appliance has been dropped and damaged, emits a 'burning' odour or develops any other symptom which could affect is electrical safety, then it's essential to remove the item from use and have it checked and tested by a qualified electrician as soon as is practically possible. <br /><br />Make sure you visit us for information on  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.pat-tests-uk.co.uk"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.pat-tests-uk.co.uk</a> .

Today the vast majority of electrical installations and appliances are in compliance with British Safety Standards and therefore are safe for use at point of sale or when initially installed. However with regards to property, there are many still with very old electrical installations which could pose a significant risk of fire and/or electric shock. Regular electrical testing helps to highlight issues before they become a threat and also identifies areas where significant improvements to an electrical system should me made. <br /><br />In England and Wales, all new electrical work within a domestic setting must comply to Part P of the Building Regulations. This is generally achieved by complying with British Standard BS7671 (wiring regulations), which also includes carrying out adequate inspection and testing of the completed electrical works. This is also referred to as 'fixed wire testing', as it's the electrical power and lighting circuits which are tested as opposed to the portable appliances connected to the electrical circuit via a power socket. Fixed wire testing needs to be carried out on a regular basis after the initial installation as faults can arise for a variety of reasons, from general wear and tear to environmental affects such as frost, wind and rain. <br /><br />All electrical testing results in a report written by the testing electrician. This includes generic information of the electrical installation which has been tested, along with individual circuit data and test results. The report will also list all the items tested, whether electronically, visually or both and where necessary, a list of defects and areas not in compliance with British Standards; these will require further attention to remedy the fault or defect. This report is often referred to as a Periodic Inspection Report (PIR), however from 2011 these reports will be also be known as an Electrical Inspection Condition Report (EICR).<br /><br />Almost all public buildings such as shops, cafés and bars, hospitals, schools and colleges require regular electrical safety testing to be carried out, this is a legal requirement. This means that some powering down of the circuit being tested is necessary as the electrical testing cannot be thoroughly conducted on live circuits. This can be disruptive in the workplace, however by liaising with the electrician conducting the testing and letting any affected members of staff know in advance, any disruption to workflow can easily be minimised.<br /><br />For Information on  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.pat-tests-uk.co.uk"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.pat-tests-uk.co.uk</a>  or  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.pat-tests-uk.co.uk%2FFixed-Electrical-Testing%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.pat-tests-uk.co.uk/Fixed-Electrical-Testing/</a> , visit us.

They can be found on the kettle, toaster, monitors and electric paper shredders, lamps and desk fans; but what are they for? Well the answer is that these little green labels mean the appliance to which it is attached has be PAT tested by a competent PAT engineer. PAT testing means Portable Appliance Testing and is a simple electrical test conducted on most items of electrical equipment used in the workplace, schools, shops, museums or any other public building.<br /><br />Almost all electrical appliances in such settings needs to be deemed safe for use on a regular basis and the person responsible for ensuring this is done is the 'duty of care' holder. This is usually the most senior person in a business or organisation; however the 'duty of care' holder could be another appointed person with the organisation. PAT testing should really be carried out by a competent PAT engineer who is fully aware of the current PAT testing regulations. <br /><br />Electrical appliances need to undergo a visual inspection where the power cable and plug are inspected for visible signs of wear and tear, as is the casing of the appliance being tested. Assuming all is well regarding the visual inspection, the appliance is tested more thoroughly using a PAT tester. This is an electronic device into which the appliance being tested is plugged in order to carry out basic safety tests such as earth continuity, insulation resistance and polarity. <br /><br />Basic PAT testers are available which simply state whether an appliance passes or fails the test and can be used by non electricians. However most PAT engineers use a more advanced PAT tester that gives more detailed information than simply 'pass' or 'fail' and should be used only by qualified PAT engineers. PAT testers also need to be calibrated regularly in order to ensure they are measuring correctly so the tests remain compliant with current PAT testing regulations. Failure to make sure a PAT tester is calibrated on a regular basis could negate or void a companies or individuals electrical testing data. <br /><br />Although one can carry out their own PAT testing, it's highly advisable to hire an experienced testing PAT engineer to do it for you. They will offer a far more comprehensive service than a layman can provide and in the event that any appliance fails the test, may be able to repair it in the spot or advise whether a repair or replacement is required.<br /><br />Do you want to find out more information about  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.pat-tests-uk.co.uk"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.pat-tests-uk.co.uk</a> ?

It's very common these days for business owners to employ IT services from a different county or even a different country as almost all communication will be done via email or telephone, so there's no need to use the company down the road. However there's a lot to be said for face to face contact and one to one meetings, especially if you're having your first website built from scratch.<br /><br />Many business owners are still 'paper based' to a certain extent and often, having no option but electronic communication can force them to compromise in presenting their wants and needs. This could be due to simple things such as not being able to scan an image or document for emailing, or due to ones inability to project ideas over the phone instead of giving a physical presentation. When hiring a web designer from several hundred miles away, organising a face to face meeting is often out of the question. However West Yorkshire has plenty of companies offering web design in Leeds to choose from, and being based in the north of England are often less costly than web design companies based in the south east which will be paying higher wages to their staff and higher rents to their landlords or commercial estate agents. <br /><br />Just because one owns a business and is looking for a company website to be built does not mean they are 'internet savvy' or technologically minded in any way. In such cases having face to face meetings is essential as various aspects of web development can be discussed and explained far more effectively than over the phone. For example talking one the different types of image galleries which are available and demonstrating how they can be updated using an online editor. Also the limitations of a website can also be better demonstrated in face to face meetings such as slow page loads due to too many large images, videos or Flash animations all being on one page. For these and many other reasons, it's far better for companies in West Yorkshire to look for web design in Leeds rather than Liverpool or London simply because shopping local has significant benefits over more remote web design companies. <br /><br />If you need any information on  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.whydigitalmedia.co.uk"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.whydigitalmedia.co.uk</a>  then make sure to visit us!

Being naturally porous, travertine is a highly distinctive stone and has been used in buildings and architecture for many hundreds of years. More recently, travertine has enjoyed a growing popularity for its use as floor and wall tiles.  When utilised as a wall or floor tile, the pores in travertine are filled with a resin which not only makes the tiles waterproof, but also makes them even more resilient to cracking when laid as relatively thin floor tiles.<br /><br />As previously mentioned, Travertine is a naturally porous rock yet in spite of this, it is extremely hard wearing, with ancient castles still standing proud after a thousand years. Probably the most famous building built from travertine is  the Colosseum in Rome. Travertine comes in a variety of colours from pale cream or ivory to a rich beige and deep brown colours. The entrance hall of the famous Willis tower, formerly the Sears Tower in Chicago is adorned with travertine floor and wall tiles. What better way to welcome visitors to Americas tallest building than with ancient polished travertine tiles underfoot?<br /><br />Travertine is not the reserve of majestic buildings such as the Colosseum or the Willis Tower, as travertine wall and floor tiles has gained a growing popularity in the home in recent years. Travertine can be used throughout the home but its most common setting is in the bathroom. Resin filled travertine tiles are perfect as both a wall and floor covering. They are good conductors of heat and work well in conjunction with underfloor heating systems. Being resin filled to impregnate the pores which are natural in Travertine, makes thinly sliced travertine tiles more resilient than other natural stone tiles as the resin adds a little flexibility, therefore making them less likely to crack when laid. <br /><br />Travertine is fast becoming one of the most popular natural stone floor and wall tiles, competing with the likes of slate, granite and marble. It is quarried throughout the world and is therefore relatively affordable in comparison to some other natural stones. Add splash of warmth, colour and timeless beauty to your bathroom, kitchen or entrance hall with the unique qualities of travertine.<br /><br />If you interested into looking for some new  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.tileswalls.co.uk"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.tileswalls.co.uk</a>  then make sure you visit us&quot; We have a great selection including  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.tileswalls.co.uk"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.tileswalls.co.uk</a> .
