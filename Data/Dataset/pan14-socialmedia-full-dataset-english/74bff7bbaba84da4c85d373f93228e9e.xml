These liquids will have a hand in staining teeth if you drink them too often.<br /><br />Try a saltwater mixture to whiten your teeth. Add a pinch of rock salt to a glass of water and wait for five minutes. Use the rock salt and water mixture like mouthwash. Gargle nightly with it for best results. The mixture also prevents cavities.<br /><br />Smoking is a bad decision if you want whiter teeth. Both the nicotine and associated smoke will turn your teeth brown very quickly.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovLzI4c3BoeW54bWF0Y2gucG9zdGVyb3VzLmNvbS9kb250LWJlLWFmcmFpZC10by1zbWlsZS1hbnltb3JlLXRyeS10aGVzZS10ZWU_" target="_blank">Effective Tips To Help You Get Whiter Teeth Now</a> It is not necessary, nowadays, to put up with teeth that are stained, yellow or otherwise discolored.

But, discolored teeth will keep you from fully achieving the appearance you want. The following article will give you some simple ideas that will show you how to go about giving your teeth a whiter look.<br /><br />&lt;img src=&quot;<br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Ffarm9.static.flickr.com%2F8055%2F8123682451_913752acbd.jpg%26quot"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8055/8123682451_913752acbd.jpg&quot</a>; align=&quot;right&quot; width=&quot;207&quot; style=&quot;padding:10px;&quot;/&gt;  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jb3B0ZXItZ2FtZS5vcmcvaW5kZXgucGhwP3BhcmFtcz1wcm9maWxlL3ZpZXcvNTk0MjUv" target="_blank">go here</a> Keep your expectations realistic when you whiten your teeth, whatever method you use. No matter which method you choose, you may be let down if you expect miraculous results. Take into consideration both your age and the current damage to your teeth before whitening. Speak to your dentist before doing any type of whitening so you will know what you can expect.<br /><br />Lemon and lime juice are not a good way to whiten your teeth. Lemon and lime juice should actually be avoided if you want to have a white smile. Without their enamel coating, teeth are more susceptible to cavities and discoloration, and these juices can erode the enamel.<br /><br />Coffee is one of the main culprits of yellow teeth and you should cut down on it. This may be hard for some people, but coffee is the number one reason people have yellow teeth if they are a steady drinker. Perhaps hot cocoa could be drunk, instead of coffee.<br /><br />You can make your own whitening paste with water and baking soda. Baking soda is mildly abrasive, polishing off stains and leaving teeth whiter and extremely clean. Just wet your toothbrush and dip it in baking soda, creating a paste.<br /><br />Any at home teeth whitening tips, that may seem like a simple and great idea do, sometimes have their negative side effects such as causing sensitivity or even causing bleeding/swollen gums. Talk to your dentist about these issues, as your mouth may require professional whitening treatments.<br /><br />A natural way to get your teeth their whitest is to use certain fruits. Specific fruits like oranges can really whiten a smile. Even just mashing some strawberries until they are a paste, then leaving it on teeth for a few minutes, can give you a white smile. You can simply rub a orange peel on your teeth to whiten them.<br /><br />Sometimes whitening strips that need to be in your mouth for two hours are hard on sensitive gums. Try the 30 minute version instead. Although the half hour whitening strips have to be applied for a longer time period, two weeks or so, gums won't be as sensitive.<br /><br />Foods with a dark coloration, and especially fruit juices with a strong color are notable for staining teeth. Blueberries or raspberries are among the most staining fruits. Coffee and soda can also stain your teeth. This is a good way to prevent the problem in the first place.<br /><br />Brushing your teeth after every meal is a great way to keep them free from stains. Some foods and beverages will stain your teeth, so promptly brushing is essential to preventing stains from setting. Coffee is one of the worst offenders and needs to be removed right away.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy52aWJlc2Nvbm5lY3QuY29tL3NpbGs2YmVhdmVy" target="_blank">teeth whitening pen</a> Your life will change substantially after whitening your teeth.
