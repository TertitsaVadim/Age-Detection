<br /><br />On Decmber 12th evening.my group go to eat the foreign restaurant with the 12 grade mentors. We eat in the French Le Jean near the school.because we always heard this restaurant is very tasty and many people often go there to have a meal .So we choose there to have wonderful experience.We arrival at the restaurant about 5.30p.m. and we all stay in the first floor in the restaurant.
<br />I sit on the chair near the door.First I see the menu ,I feel very excited too see the different things about food.

Today is a very nice day ,we all came to a Chang Jiang road to went to this exhibition and we all feel very excited. This exhibition is set in the Fine Arts Museum and this exhibition will keep one month. We came to get the tickets and then we went into the room, I found there are many beautiful artifacts in this room. And I feel very excited to be in this art world, I think today will take a fun time in this place.
<br />First, I see the very big painting in front of us. There is a big lion stand in the middle and there are also some mountains on the background. It looks so huge. This painting called” The king return back”. And I think this mane is very suitable, maybe to draw this painting need to use many times that I can’t estimate. Then I walk around the museum alone. I also watching many nice drawings like a brids, the plants and the buildings, From all these paintings I was interested in the long painting, it made of six pieces of paper and it draw the branch on the tree. And there some leaves and flowers on this tree, It is a very beautiful view. And I also have a photo with this beautiful drawing .I feel very happy.And they also have some pictures with the other beautiful paintings which they like. And we also let the people in the museum to help us to take a photo include all of us. Then we also know some basic art konwledge about this art exhibition . today we have a meaningful visit in this museum.
<br />During visiting the art echibition” Where New Zealand Meets China”. My first feeling is the artist to draw these wonderful painting is a very strong spirit man. How many times that can made just one picture? For me maybe one year also couldn’t finish it. How about these too many wonderful work? So I admire him very much. But when I see the title about this art exhibition . I feel a little uncomfortable. Because it use a eyesight of New Zealand to see the china art instead of china local eyesight. I don’t agree to use the other country’s culture to decide chinese art. It likes “worship things foreign and fawn on foreign countries “ I don’t accept this point although the artist is a chinese . but in the art point to see this art exhibition. I think it is a successful exhibition and it give us a visual feast.and from this exhibition , I also learn some knowledge about art and the little to draw the art work. Totality, I think today’s little visit is meaningful for us and let us know the more about the fine art this field.. finally we took many pictures in the room and we have a very fun time.

There are many kinds of activities like basketball , badmintion and running .and I often do the exercises to fit our body. Now let’s see the experience when I do these physical activities.
<br />I like playing basketball very much , and everyday I do this exercises for 2 or 3 hours. And I nearly crazy about this things. Every one march on the basketball ground is excited for me.  I am a center in the team because I have a tall height be in this team and I am strong enough to catch the ball. When the march starts, I will try my best to face every chance and catch every ball excitedly. And when I meet the center that more stronger than me , I sill not afraid and come to contend with him. Every time when I win the march. I will feelvery happy although it makes me feel very tired and have many sweat. And I want to practise more and more and so that I can become more stronger than before to beyond my self.
<br />Expect basketball. I also like to play badmintion . at the first time I play the badmintion , I found it is very funny and it can practise the body very well. But when I don’t play it many times . I often fall on others and I feel very sad . then my father found this point and he oftentake me to the badmintion ground to practise this skill. My father teach me many skills about how to play the badmintion well and during the time I practice, I become stronger than before and I can win the people who play with me. It makes me feel very happy . but I know that I am still very weak when I face the people who stronger than me. But I don’t care because I have a very enjoy time on this and I can learn more about this. 
<br />Another way I practise myself is to running around the palyground. Although it is boring for every one, but I think It is useful to keep body fit and I keep to do this exercise every week. And I like listening to the music during the running. The music can make the body relaxed and it also can make me couldn’t feel the `time running. And I like this exercise very much . It’s good for myself . 
<br />During these time , I though to do the exercise work is important . if we don’t have the exercise every day , our body will become weakness. So I think we need to do the exercise everyday and fit our body every day

All the productions were made before Chen YiFei’s death, now artist Chen YiFei had been died for a long period. 
<br />This art gallery has three layers, the first layer is Chen YiFei’s charcoal drawing, these charcoal drawing are almost about women’s action, such as woman is sewing, cleaning up or missing her husband. The second layer is Chen YiFei’s canvas, for this part, he pays more attention to natural landscape and primary modern China, the natural landscape shows his ability of romance and great color control. And for the canvas of primary modern China, initial development was showed lively , at that time, the railway workers tried their best to build railway , the weather is hot, everyone perspire and show they are too tired. This kind of emotion is expression lifelike. And the third layer is photos that Chen YiFei took, and the drawing that can show his visual sense. I can not understand his visual sense drawing very clearly. 
<br />Chen Yifei (April 14, 1946 -2,005 on April 10) was born in Ningbo, Zhejiang people. After living in America in 1980 focused on the research of Chinese painting and creative themes .After years of unremitting efforts and achieved remarkable success, becoming renowned Chinese painter. Chen Yifei carries 38 U.S. dollars in 1980 went to America to study. Master of Arts in 1984, received. New York, after oil painting and in Washington, New York, Tokyo and other places organized individual exhibitions. Hong Kong has participated in work and domestic oil paintings auction, which works &quot;Mountain Wind&quot; create the highest auction price of Chinese oil paintings. The work by the Chinese Art Museum, Museum of the Chinese People's Revolution and the extensive collection of domestic and foreign collectors. Scenic rivers and lakes, music, characters, classic beauties, but also in Tibet, are his main subjects under the brush. Chen Yifei oil paintings of the most important feature are that the screen filled with peace and quiet, the realism was saturated with traditional Chinese aesthetics. Whether depicting the scenery JiangNan women still vivid portrait, all reflect a pursuit of artist: &quot;the use of Western techniques, given the spirit of the Chinese works. Chen YiFei is also a famous director; many movies were produced by his head. From 1993, Chen YiFei came into filmdom, he finished Autobiographical art film &quot;Sea dream - Chen Yifei personal Wandering.&quot; And in 2002, He began preparations for personal second movie, &quot;Barber&quot;, but the following year took place &quot;&quot; Barber of Seville &quot;Tingpai incident.&quot;. 
<br />Chen YiFei is a pretty good director and artist, but in the April 10, 2005 8:44 am, the famous director, because of stomach bleeding artist Chen Yifei dies at Shanghai Huashan Hospital. What a pity.

It is a art exhibition and there are many beautiful paints in the room. One of paints I mentioned is called “the king comes back”. It is made by a famous Zelanian Chinese painter called Cao Jun in 2009. It is kind of old Chinese ink and washes painting.
<br /> In this painting, there is a strong male lion. It stands on the grass and looks at the view in front of him. On the background, I can see a giant waterfall coming down through rock cliffs. The lion opens his mouth a little bit and look beyond. It is very strong and hairy. The cliffs are very cliffy and water comes very fast and strong. There are not many plants in the painting but there is grass under the lion’s feet. The water rushes so fast that the water vapour rises very high. The grass is yellow in the front but green at the background. 
<br />By a glance of this painting, I am shocked by the lion. The lion is very strong and I can feel its strength from the painting. The lion must be the king and it just came back from hunting or migration and starts to watch its territory. It opens its mouth and seems to threaten those timid animals and show his power and authority to its species. Those waterfall and cliffs can show the lion’s strength better. They use their strength to set a great background for a king. 
<br />This paint reminds me of China. My nation is a great nation. China is very strong and united. It is like a lion watch its own territory calmly and powerfully. I think the artist want to tell us that China is both strong and calm like a lion; China is more than you can see. 
<br />The lion looks calm and quiet but who knows if it is operating a big hunting. His strong paws are symbols of authority. It shows its paws to try to tell everyone that he is the king. The lion is wild but noble among other animals. Real freedom is wild and this lion explains wild well. Messy hair can show it experiences. The lion does not show its buckteeth but I can imagine that the teeth are really sharp and deadly. Anyone who wants to try never has the second chance because it would let them go easily. This is an old energetic lion standing in nature.
<br />I really like the painting “the king comes back”. I think it is a very successful painting. Because the painting is very good in painting technique and the proportion is really great. The lion is very realistic and it looks very lively. The background fit the lion well and I like the style of the cliffs and waterfalls. This painting can bring me into it. I can feel the murderous heart from the lion, cool water vapour from the waterfalls and soft wind. It is a very successful painting.
<br /> If I could, I of course will buy it. Because I like it and it can show that China is like the lion. I am a Chinese and I love China. I will hang it in my home and appreciate it every day. This painting reminds me of my nation.

<br />During the winter vacation, I went to another small for do a volunteer work like typing or edit the word. Because last time I have done this kind of work when I was in grade 10 so I think it is easy for me. I tried not to regard me as a special one and did all kinds of work that other workers did. but, that was not what I think , because this time is not just a part of work I need to do but this small company’s all typing and edit work, So, I even have no time even to drink a water. Later, I felt like I was a truly worker now and often talked with the real work to learn some skills to up the speed about work when I was free. In the first few days, I was hard-working and full of energy. But later on, I found it really hard to maintain the same attitude. Everyday I went home exhausted and felt pain in my extremities. Specially my hands were suffering from keyboard, So I learnt that the typing workers is hard to raise money.
<br />When I was working in this company I went to have dinner with the workers everyday, I had a more deep sight on the people who live in the lower class in the society. They also chat with me about the daily life. While working there, I saw the people is very busy in working when the work is hard in a small company, I can image the if the big company will be more busy, They mostly did hard labor work and needed a lot of nutrition for their daily work. There’s one thing I know for sure, they raise money so hard is for their family, there would be a greater chance for their family, probably their children to go to school and can eat better than before. In my mind, I would always feel great content deep in my mind. They were the ones who usually perched on high scaffold, built long bridges that connects cities and tower blocks that provided shelters for us, but I guess most of us didn’t treat them right and discriminated them. And that was why that their salaries were keeping being delayed. So, mentioning being polite and equally treat them are not realistic according to the present circumstance. But I really wished that they can have their basic rights protected. If one day my wish comes true, I believe that our society will make one large step to true freedom and democracy.

I just finish during the winter holiday, so I agree with him. When I volunteered at the Sunny Coffee, I realized that the lives of workers for the service industries are not easy because the waiters there need to do a lot of work while keep the simile and to endure the habits of some strict custom. Also, they need to work every day and they just get a few days to rest in a year. I will treat the waiters more politely and respectfully next I went into the coffee shop because of a hard life they had. 
<br />During I worked for the typing work, I learnt that it is totally different between the typing work and service , it was very difficult that you need to take care all the time and stand all the time except the rest time. After I did it for just five hours I felt exhausted and I just learnt why my mother always said the money is not easy to raise.
<br />After I did the volunteer work, I gained that I need to learn more staffs, otherwise, I can finish my portfolio homework, it also can help me to try another kind of life. From the work I realized I need to learn a lot of things for improving myself.
<br />I think the skill that required to work effectively and safely is the skill of social interaction because if people want to work effectively, they need to talk, and the person who has the skill of social interaction is good at talk, and the person can balance the difference of others’ to gather them as a group. Unfortunately, I do not have the skill of social interaction; it is the reason why it is hard for me to work with people. However, I am try to change myself to improving and improving.
<br />My work in Sunny Coffee was to be the translator. I think the volunteer experience I acquired today will be very useful to my employability in the future. The volunteer work let the workers work in the Sunny Cafe a helper in order to help them without paying anything. For me, I got a chance to improve my ability and a chance to made more friends.

For example, every time he plans to organize an activity I need to help him to think about what place that we can have fun and learn something at the same time. So we visited cinema, some place of interest, KTV, museum and library in order to find a place we can visit many times without feel boring, we need creative idea. As a result we change our activity place every time, but the problem is Nanjing is doesn’t have a lot of places. Also, we cannot keep our club goes if there are only a few of people. The leader tells me: to built a enterprise is easy but it is difficult to continuance.
<br />During this process I realized that if I want to be a good small leader my job is to help the leader to keep club as long as possible, the reason of few people attend maybe caused by the name, but it is not the same meaning with that book but means “have fun in study, boy” There are many skills that in need in order to work effectively and safely with other students. For example the ability of management is one of the most important skills. For a leader I need to think about the place that we take part in is not far from half of our members home, I need to share the job with leader and don’t let him do all the work. I think the skill of management would be much needed for our PBC. The advantage of my club is it is a good chance to visit a lot of museums, place of interests to teach some staffs that we cannot learn from the books. The disadvantage of the playboy club is it has a bad name and it will cost a lot of time and money for its activities.
<br />I think it is meaningful that the GCA makes us to build or join clubs because I learnt a lot of community skills during the club time and the skills will be very useful to me in the future.

When I enter the restaurant, I was pleased with the blissful arrangement and the politeness of the waitresses but equally surprised at the few guests. After we sat down, the waitress gave us two menus and there are many things on them and it also made me confuse cause the price is not cheap I ordered goose liver, pasta with tomato source and a tiramisu. For drink, I ordered an ounce of Jack Daniel’s and cocktail. The first dish was the goose liver. It didn’t taste as good as I thought, so I was a bit disappointed when I saw this international famous dish. Blue berry jam was added and I found it really annoying----It spoiled everything. Pasta with tomato source was Ok; at least I really loved the tomato source. Tiramisu had no big difference comparing to other ones I had tried. In general, the dinner at Henry’s Home was good, especially the alcohol, it was really unforgettable.
<br />Then I went to Jack’s Place which is at WangFu Road, 35th with my new class to have my dinner there. We chose this restaurant not only because we had heard a lot of people praised this restaurant highly, but also it had very professional cooks. As we walked in, I noticed that forks, plates and spoons were carefully arranged on the table. I wouldn’t recognize it as an Italian restaurant if I hadn’t seen the large advertisement outside the restaurant. 
<br />I ordered pasta with tomato source, a pizza that was covered by cheese, beans, hams, etc. It tastes a little bit sour and I really loved the taste and smell. The orange colour also aroused my appetite. Although Chinese also have noodles as our main dish, pasta is different from traditional Chinese noodles. When I was eating, I noticed that there weren’t many people at the restaurant. And there weren’t many waiters also. there is something the restaurant could do to improve so that the business will be better.

As an exerciser I learned that to be a good athlete need to practice and continual, otherwise you will be weakness loss the skills. For example, I have stopped playing basketball for about four weeks in grade 9 for the Middle Exam, when I play it again I lost the skill to play it and always lose the game, I spend a lot of time to learn  how to play basketball good again . and I keep to play every weeks and it can help me keep fit.
<br />  After this process, I find that some exercise could help to reduce my health problem. For example, I had a light hepatic adipose infiltration a year before, because that I always eat a lot of junk food and did not ever move from my computer. Now, the hepatic adipose infiltration has gone because of my continual exercises. I had made a plan that do a exercise in gymnasium for two hours every day and take a walk after have had dinner. In order to reduce my fatness and the result is fruitful because my plan makes lose weight. From it, I gained that exercise can keep ones’ healthy and it could also reduce someone’s illness.
<br />  And at the school day, I always keep play basketball because it can help to do the exercise and it is very funny. I have played about 50hours on basketball because I play it everyday after school even the bad weather. And I also try to use other way to do the exercise like running or join the school PE class. However, play basketball is my major way to do the exercise.
<br />  At the beginning of the school year, I planned to do other exercise like swim two hours per week or play tennis. But that is doesn’t work to instead the basketball so at the end of the school year, the only activity I did that fit my plan or even beyond my plan is to play basketball because I love basketball very much. To fit other two plans was not easy because I am not born in Nanjing so I don’t know where is a place to let me swim . So, play tennis and swim was a costly and uneasy exercise in Nanjing.
<br />  From these totally 80 hours exercise I become more health and fitness than before and I also learned some knowledge that I could not learned from the original school.

It is one of the most famous philharmonic societies in Zurich. It is created in 1990 and many famous musician work in it like Ingolf Turban and Amar.  
<br />I learned piano when I was 5 years old, but I gave it up when I was 9 years old because it is not interesting for me anymore. Today’s musician which to play piano is also a Chinese and he play very good. I believe he will be very famous in the world . 
<br />When I got into the big hall, everybody there was very serious. People there were much older than us. Maybe they were music lovers or musicians. I felt a little bit strange because of the serious ambience, and I also felt excited because the concert was going to start.   
<br />I enjoyed that night because the music can make people relax and enjoy in it. The piano pieces that he played were very awesome. After this play, I am regret that I was gave up, but I know I am stand at the time line and it couldn’t go back so I need to catch every opportunist and don’t let it go away again.

It is a little temple but it is a Taoism temple. Taoism (or Daoism) refers to a variety of related philosophical and religious traditions that have influenced Eastern Asia for more than two millennia and it is very differ with Buddhism, it has had a notable influence on the western world since the 19th century. The word Tao always translates as &amp;quot;path&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;way&amp;quot; and it can help the foreign countries to understand it means. It is in Chinese folk religion and philosophy it carries more abstract meanings. Taoist propriety and ethics emphasize the Three Jewels of the Tao: compassion, moderation, and humility, while Taoist thought generally focuses on nature, the relationship between humanity and the cosmos, health and longevity which is thought to produce harmony with the universe. 
<br />Taoism is very intricate. When I came to visit the Taishan temple with my mom, a Taoist came to us and introduce for us. The Taoist said that he can see out the future of a person by see his or her hand and my mother tried. He started to talk with my mom and it took a bit long time. After this conversation, this man asked for some money and my mother paid it, I think it is a culture of china and we can try to know it but couldn’t believe it can give you a fact of your future.
