<br /><br />A Message by George Carlin:
<br /><br />The paradox of our time in history is that we have taller buildings but shorter tempers, wider Freeways , but narrower viewpoints. We spend more, but have less, we buy more, but enjoy less. We have bigger houses and smaller families, more conveniences, but less time. We have more degrees but less sense, more knowledge, but less judgment, more experts, yet more problems, more medicine, but less wellness. 
<br /><br />We drink too much, smoke too much, spend too recklessly, laugh too little, drive too fast, get too angry, stay up too late, get up too tired, read too little, watch TV too much, and pray too seldom. 
<br /><br />We have multiplied our possessions, but reduced our values. We talk too much, love too seldom, and hate too often.
<br /><br />We've learned how to make a living, but not a life. We've added years to life not life to years. We've been all the way to the moon and back, but have trouble crossing the street to meet a new neighbour. We conquered outer space but not inner space. We've done larger things, but not better things. 
<br /><br />We've cleaned up the air, but polluted the soul. We've conquered the atom, but not our prejudice. We write more, but learn less. We plan more, but accomplish less. We've learned to rush, but not to wait. We build more computers to hold more information, to produce more copies than ever, but we communicate less and less. 
<br /><br />These are the times of fast foods and slow digestion, big men and small character, steep profits and shallow relationships. These are the days of two incomes but more divorce, fancier houses, but broken homes. These are days of quick trips, disposable diapers, throwaway morality, one night stands, overweight bodies, and pills that do everything from cheer, to quiet, to kill. It is a time when there is much in the showroom window and nothing in the stockroom. A time when technology can bring this letter to you, and a time when you can choose either to share this insight, or to just hit delete... 
<br /><br />Remember; spend some time with your loved ones, because they are not going to be around forever.
<br /><br />Remember, say a kind word to someone who looks up to you in awe, because that little person soon will grow up and leave your side. 
<br /><br />Remember, to give a warm hug to the one next to you, because that is the only treasure you can give with your heart and it doesn't cost a cent.
<br /><br />Remember, to say, 'I love you' to your partner and your loved ones, but most of all mean it. A kiss and an embrace will mend hurt when it comes from deep inside of you. 
<br /><br />Remember to hold hands and cherish the moment for someday that person will not be there again.
<br /><br />Give time to love, give time to speak! And give time to share the precious thoughts in your mind.
<br /><br />AND ALWAYS REMEMBER: 
<br /><br />Life is not measured by the number of breaths we take, but by the moments that take our breath away.

<br />but soon is gone
<br />it begs the question
<br />was it there to start with
<br /><br />our love was lost
<br />and never found
<br />lost with out you
<br />lost without me
<br />lost in to eternity
<br /><br />our love was just a figment
<br />a figment of our minds
<br />something we could ponder
<br />but could never express
<br /><br />was it really love or just a feeling
<br />was it really love or just healing
<br /><br />healing from our hatred
<br />the hatred of our hearts
<br />our past is deep and full of pain
<br />we needed this to release the strain
<br /><br />for this i do not regret
<br />the time with you that i have spent

<br />And gives me the goose bumps whenever you speak?
<br />Why does the sight of you fill me with pleasure,
<br />Like a spotlight that shines on a glorious treasure?
<br /><br />Are you so different from others I’ve known?
<br />What qualities do you have that are yours alone?
<br />What can it be that fills up my heart?
<br />And makes me feel lost whenever we part?
<br /><br />There’s no easy answer for this marvelous bliss,
<br />For the wonder I feel whenever we kiss,
<br />For the fire that rages at the touch of your skin,
<br />For the way my heart pounds for you way deep within.
<br /><br />It must be the power of love that I feel,
<br />That ties me in bonds that seem strong as steel.
<br />I could fight to get loose, but I’d rather give in;
<br />To stay trapped by your charms is how I will win.

<br />Her favorite dress tied with a bow.
<br />Today was Daddy's Day at school,
<br />And she couldn't wait to go.
<br /><br />But her mommy tried to tell her,
<br />That she probably should stay home.
<br />Why, the kids might not understand
<br />If she went to school alone.
<br /><br />But she was not afraid;
<br />She knew just what to say.
<br />What to tell her classmates,
<br />on this Daddy's Day.
<br /><br />But still her mother worried,
<br />For her to face this day alone.
<br />And that was why once again,
<br />She tried to keep her daughter home.
<br /><br />But the little girl went to school,
<br />Eager to tell them all.
<br />About a dad she never sees,
<br />A dad who never calls.
<br /><br />There were daddies along the wall in back,
<br />For everyone to meet.
<br />Children squirming impatiently,
<br />Anxious in their seats.
<br /><br />One by one the teacher called,
<br />A student from the class
<br />To introduce their daddy,
<br />As seconds slowly passed.
<br /><br />At last the teacher called her name,
<br />Every child turned to stare.
<br />Each of them were searching
<br />For a man who wasn't there.
<br /><br />&quot;Where's her daddy at?&quot;
<br />She heard a boy call out.
<br />&quot;She probably doesn't have one,&quot;
<br />Another student dared to shout.
<br /><br />And from somewhere near the back,
<br />She heard a daddy say,
<br />&quot;Looks like another deadbeat dad,
<br />Too busy to waste his day.&quot;
<br /><br />The words did not offend her,
<br />As she smiled at her friends
<br />And looked back at her teacher,
<br />Who told her to begin.
<br /><br />And with hands behind her back,
<br />Slowly she began to speak.
<br />And out from the mouth of a child,
<br />Came words incredibly unique.
<br /><br />&quot;My Daddy couldn't be here,
<br />because he lives so far away.
<br />But I know he wishes he could be
<br />With me on this special day.
<br /><br />And though you cannot meet him,
<br />I wanted you to know
<br />All about my daddy
<br />And how much he loves me so.
<br /><br />He loved to tell me stories,
<br />He taught me to ride my bike.
<br />He surprised me with pink roses,
<br />And taught me to fly a kite.
<br /><br />We used to share fudge sundaes
<br />And ice cream in a cone.
<br />And though you cannot see him,
<br />I'm not standing here alone.
<br /><br />'Cause my daddy's always with me,
<br />Even though we are apart.
<br />I know because he told me,
<br />He'll forever be here in my heart.&quot;
<br /><br />With that her little hand reached up,
<br />And lay across her chest.
<br />Feeling her own heartbeat
<br />Beneath her favorite dress.
<br /><br />From somewhere in the crowd of dads,
<br />Her mother stood in tears
<br />Proudly watching her daughter,
<br />Who was wise beyond her years.
<br /><br />She stood up for the love
<br />Of a man not in her life,
<br />Doing what was best for her,
<br />Doing what was right.
<br /><br />When she dropped her hand back down
<br />Staring straight into the crowd,
<br />She finished with a voice so soft,
<br />But its message clear and loud.
<br /><br />&quot;I love my daddy very much,
<br />He's my shining star.
<br />If he could he'd be here,
<br />But heaven's just too far.
<br /><br />Sometimes when I close my eyes,
<br />It's like he never went away.&quot;
<br />Then she closed her eyes
<br />And saw him there that day.
<br /><br />To her mother's amazement,
<br />She witnessed with surprise
<br />A room full of daddies and children,
<br />All starting to close their eyes.
<br /><br />Who knows what they saw before them,
<br />Who knows what they felt inside.
<br />Perhaps for a second
<br />They saw him at her side.
<br /><br />&quot;I know you're with me Daddy,&quot;
<br />To the silence she called out.
<br />What happened next made believers
<br />Of those once filled with doubt.
<br /><br />No one in that room could explain it,
<br />For each of their eyes had been closed.
<br />But there placed on her desktop,
<br />Was a beautiful fragrant pink rose.
<br /><br />A child was blessed, if only a moment,
<br />By the love of her shining bright star
<br />And given the gift of believing,
<br />That heaven is never too FAR.

<br />And I'm not there to see,
<br />If the sun should rise and find your eyes
<br />All filled with tears for me;
<br /><br />I wish so much you wouldn't cry
<br />The way you did today,
<br />While thinking of the many things,
<br />We didn't get to say.
<br /><br />I know how much you love me,
<br />As much as I love you,
<br />And each time that you think of me,
<br />I know you'll miss me too;
<br /><br />But when tomorrow starts without me,
<br />Please try to understand,
<br />That an angel came and called my name,
<br />And took me by the hand,
<br /><br />And said my place was ready,
<br />In heaven far above,
<br />And that I'd have to leave behind
<br />All those I dearly love.
<br /><br />But as I turned to walk away,
<br />A tear fell from my eye
<br />For all my life, I'd always thought,
<br />I didn't want to die.
<br /><br />I had so much to live for,
<br />So much left yet to do,
<br />It seemed almost impossible,
<br />That I was leaving you.
<br /><br />I thought of all the yesterdays,
<br />The good ones and the bad,
<br />I thought of all the love we shared,
<br />And all the fun we had.
<br /><br />If I could relive yesterday,
<br />Just even for a while,
<br />I'd say good-bye and kiss you
<br />And maybe see you smile.
<br /><br />But then I fully realized,
<br />That this could never be,
<br />For emptiness and memories,
<br />Would take the place of me.
<br /><br />And when I thought of worldly things,
<br />I might miss come tomorrow,
<br />I thought of you, and when I did,
<br />My heart was filled with sorrow.
<br /><br />But when I walked through Heaven's gates,
<br />I felt so much at home.
<br />When God looked down and smiled at me,
<br />From His great golden throne,
<br /><br />He said, &quot;This is eternity,
<br />And all I've promised you.
<br />Today your life on earth is past,
<br />But here life starts anew.
<br /><br />&quot;I promise no tomorrow,
<br />But today will always last,
<br />And since each day's the same way
<br />There's no longing for the past.
<br /><br />&quot;You have been so faithful,
<br />So trusting and so true.
<br />Though there were times
<br />You did some things
<br />You knew you shouldn't do.
<br /><br />&quot;But you have been forgiven
<br />And now at last you're free.
<br />So won't you come and take my hand
<br />And share my life with me.&quot;
<br /><br />So when tomorrow starts without me,
<br />Don't think we're far apart,
<br />For every time you think of me,
<br />I'm right here, in your heart.
