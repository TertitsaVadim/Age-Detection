When we read, we de-code this written alphabetic code. When we spell, we encode…or put the words back into the original written alphabetic code (as recorded in standardized English dictionaries).<br /><br />In the mid-eighteenth century, British scholars standardized (or coded) the spelling of Written English. A standardized system of spelling was needed because the introduction of the printing press had resulted in a chaotic spelling dilemma: That is, no two publishers were in agreement over how words should be spelled. At that time, Samuel Johnson and his helpers systematized the spelling of English for the first standardized English dictionary.<br /><br />http:/we-teach-reading.com  is an innovative computer software designed to overcome the challenges of the English language.  http:/we-teach-reading.com  is available exclusively at  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwe-teach-reading.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://we-teach-reading.com</a> .<br /><br />How Was That Alphabetic Spelling Code Devised?<br /><br />The alphabet familiar in England was used to standardize the spelling of Written English even though that familiar alphabet was NOT phonetically well-suited for English.<br /><br />Spoken English had consonant sounds and vowel sounds. Each syllable had a vowel sound. The alphabet had to have letters to represent both consonant sounds and vowel sounds. The familiar alphabet had letters to represent both consonant and vowel sounds. The problem was (and still is): That familiar alphabet does not have even half enough vowel letters to represent every vowel sound in Spoken English.<br /><br />If the familiar alphabet were to be used, each vowel letter would have to represent several different vowel sounds. To manage that dilemma, they devised a 3-way code that incorporated the three main elements that had to be dealt with.<br /><br />The first code is a Phonics Code used for writing consonant sounds and reading consonant letters. 'Phonics' is lay terminology for 'phonetics'. In 'phonetics', with very few exceptions, one consonant letter represents only one consonant sound. For instance the letter 'b' always represents the sound /buh/…never /k/, /s/, etc. Consonant letters and sounds have a simple, letter-level, phonetic relationship and code.<br /><br />The second code is a Syllabics Code used for writing stressed vowel sounds and reading stressed vowel letters. 'Syllabics' is the study of the relationships between the spelling and the pronunciation codes found in: (1) one-syllable words and (2) stressed syllables of multi-syllable words.<br /><br />In the entire English language, there are only 6 different spelling patterns or codes. Each one of these 6 spelling codes has a predictable vowel pronunciation code.<br /><br />This 'syllabics' or 'stressed vowel' code is NOT phonetic. Stressed vowels are coded (and decoded) syllabically, NOT phonetically. This complex code is made up of six spelling/pronunciation codes. One of these six spelling codes is hidden within each one-syllable word and within each stressed syllable of a multi-syllable word. This hidden spelling code tells readers whether to read the vowel(s) in that syllable with a long vowel sound, a short vowel sound, or some other vowel sound. This stressed vowel spelling/ pronunciation code works only for: (1) vowels in one-syllable words, (2) vowels in stressed syllables of multi-syllable words. Stressed vowel letters and sounds have a complex syllable level mono-syllable or syllabic relationship and code.<br /><br />The third code is a Homophonics Code, used for writing unstressed vowel sounds and reading unstressed vowel letters in multi-syllable words. This unstressed vowel code is neither phonetic nor syllabic. With few exceptions it doesn't matter which vowel(s) an unstressed syllable has, and it doesn't matter which of the six spelling codes the unstressed syllable has, the GENERAL pronunciation for unstressed vowels in unstressed syllables is the schwa, or /uh/ sound as in the word 'up'.<br /><br />Read How Learning to Read Really Works - Parts 2, 3 and 4 to understand more.

The prevailing concern is that students who do not learn these skills sufficiently in the lower grades will be unable to properly process the academic information they are presented with in the future. Commercial reading software developers have worked hard to create software that gives learners real opportunities to read critically and develop critical reading, and critical thinking, skills.<br /><br />http:/we-teach-reading.com  is an innovative computer software designed to overcome the challenges of the English language.  http:/we-teach-reading.com  is available exclusively at  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwe-teach-reading.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://we-teach-reading.com</a> .<br /><br />Computer Software is Interactive<br /><br />One of the primary benefits of commercial reading software is its ability to engage the student. Most current reading software requires that a student do more than merely punch buttons. Most programs strive to develop real two-way communication with the student, allowing the student to become involved in the learning process. Interactive software provides students with the opportunity to generate their own questions and leads the student through guided practice situations. Newer software has even developed ways for students to interact with each other via the internet. Students work together in virtual groups to expand the learning experience.<br /><br />Computer Software Uses Scientifically-Backed Research to Educate<br /><br />The reality is that educational software that purports to teach without the backing of sound research and statistics often fails to hit the mark when it comes to really educating children. For this reason, it is important to use software based on established teaching strategies as well as credible research studies. Computer software also helps learners fill in any gaps in prior knowledge with supplementary video, PowerPoint, and other interactive presentations. Many in-class software programs also include an online component that encourages learners to access additional information and share that information with learners across the world.<br /><br />Computer Software Creates a &quot;Real&quot; Learning Environment<br /><br />Until the advent of desktop computers, reading experiences were limited to print materials. Early programs were only used as supplements to a general reading lesson, rather than acting as a stand-alone reading experience. These factors meant that early computer reading programs could not meet the needs of children learning to read critically. Today's reading software can be used in conjunction with traditional reading programs, instead of such programs, or as a supplement to them. This flexibility indicates that reading software has come a long way in providing real reading experiences which mimic those of print materials, yet yield readily to formatting changes. The ability of the new generation of reading software also lends itself easily to a collaborative social environment which studies indicate helps learners construct meaning from reading materials.<br /><br />Reading software developers are working hard to keep up with the demand for increasingly technical reading opportunities. As the world goes digital, the next generation of readers accesses more information online than ever before via their computers and hand-held devices such as their mobile phones, X-boxes, Ipods and Kindles. Formulating reading programs that incorporate this trend will serve to make sure that technology keeps up with consumer preferences and will provide new readers with viable, interactive reading lessons that stimulate the imagination and increase learner knowledge.

When we read Written English, we must read these three totally different codes simultaneously - in three totally different ways - and at the rapid speed of thought (or speech…if reading aloud).<br /><br />The first code is a Phonics Code used for writing consonant sounds and reading consonant letters.<br /><br />The second code is a Syllabics Code used for writing stressed vowel sounds and reading stressed vowel letters. '<br /><br />The third code is a Homophonics Code, used for writing unstressed vowel sounds and reading unstressed vowel letters in multi-syllable words.<br /><br />http:/we-teach-reading.com  is an innovative computer software designed to overcome the challenges of the English language.  http:/we-teach-reading.com  is available exclusively at  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwe-teach-reading.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://we-teach-reading.com</a> .<br /><br />Let's take a closer look at this strange term: Homophonics Code.<br /><br />For example: in the word: anonymous (a NON y mous), there are three sets of unstressed vowels: 1) a, 2) y, and 3) ou. The unstressed vowels: 'a', 'y', and 'ou' are vowel homophones, and we read all three with the same unstressed: /uh/ pronunciation:<br />'a' is read /uh/.<br />'y' is read /uh/.<br />'ou' is read /uh/.<br /><br />Most of the time, we read the vowel(s) in unstressed syllables homophonically (or all the same way.) Exceptions are specifically spelled, visually recognizable, and predictable.<br /><br />Examples of homophones:<br />'c' and 'k' are consonant homophones in the word: 'cake'.<br />(We read 'c' and 'k' with the same consonant sound: /k/.)<br />'o' and 'u' are vowel homophones in the words: 'son' and 'run'.<br />(We read 'o' and 'u' with the same nasal short vowel sound: /uh/.)<br />'so', and 'sew' are word homophones .<br />(We read both words with the same 'consonant + vowel' sound: /sO/.)<br />In brief, unstressed vowel letters and sounds have a multi-syllable, word level, homophonic relationship and code.<br /><br />In order to simplify the spelling of unstressed vowel sounds, all unstressed vowels could have been spelled with the schwa symbol (the upside down 'e' for unstressed vowels used in most dictionaries) and pronounced as /uh/ in 'up'. This would have given the reading of unstressed vowels an easier phonetic decoding system. But this also would have compromised the vital vowel/spelling/meaning relationships already established for stressed vowels, particularly in the varying forms of a word.<br /><br />For example: the letter 'i' in the 2nd syllable of the two words: in VITE and IN vi TA tion. In the unstressed syllable 'vi' in invitation the 'i' could have been spelled with a schwa (the upside down 'e') instead of with an 'i', but then the vital vowel/spelling/meaning relationship that exists between the words invite and invitation would have been lost.<br /><br />Read How Learning to Read Really Works - Part 3 of this article to learn how using the Syllabics Code to read vowels can facilitate the 'learning to read' process.

NOBODY on our planet can predictably read an isolated English vowel letter correctly. We must look at the spelling code within each syllable. The spelling code within each one-syllable word tells us how to read all the vowels in THAT word.<br /><br />How do we read the vowel letter, 'a' in the word 'at'?<br />(The spelling code within the syllable tells us.)<br />How do we read the vowel letters, 'a' and 'e' in the word 'ate'?<br />(The spelling code within the syllable tells us.)<br />How do we read the vowel letters, 'o' and 'a' in the word 'boat'?<br />(The spelling code within the syllable tells us.)<br /><br />http:/we-teach-reading.com  is an innovative computer software designed to overcome the challenges of the English language.  http:/we-teach-reading.com  is available exclusively at  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwe-teach-reading.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://we-teach-reading.com</a> .<br /><br />In the entire English language, there are only 6 different spelling patterns or codes, and each one of these 6 spelling codes has a predictable vowel pronunciation code. (When every one-syllable word in the dictionary* is sorted according to its spelling code, there is a total of only 6 spelling codes in the entire language.<br />* excluding proper names, geographical terms, foreign words, and taboo words.<br /><br />THE 6 SPELLING/PRONUNCIATION CODES FOR READING VOWEL LETTERS (Rules**)<br /><br />1. VC Spelling Code: only 1 vowel; ends with a consonant.<br />Pronunciation Code: short vowel. (at)<br /><br />2. V Spelling Code: only 1 vowel; ends with that vowel.<br />Pronunciation Code: long vowel. (be)<br /><br />3. V V Spelling Code: 2 vowels together; no other vowels.<br />Pronunciation Code: long first vowel; silent second vowel (eat)<br /><br />4. VCCe Spelling Code: 1 vowel; followed by 2 or 3 consonants; followed by final: 'e', 'ed', or 'es'.<br />Pronunciation Code: short first vowel; silent 'e'. (asked)<br /><br />5. VCe Spelling Code: 1 vowel; followed by only 1 consonant, followed by final: 'e', 'ed', or 'es'.<br />Pronunciation Code: long 1st vowel; silent final 'e'. (cake)<br /><br />6. V VCe Spelling Code: 2 vowels together; followed by 0, 1, or 2 consonants; followed by final: 'e',<br />'ed', or 'es'.<br />Pronunciation Code: long 1st vowel; silent 2nd vowel; silent final 'e' pronunciation. (played)<br /><br />(Rules**) Not included in the above Rules:<br />General Exceptions = vowels followed by: 'm', 'n', or 'r'.<br />Specific Exceptions = all, igh, oo, ought, ow, etc.<br />(The V code spelled with 'a' is a Specific Exception.)<br />Memory Syllables = approx. 5% of all one syllable words that have established spelling codes, but<br />do not follow the established pronunciation codes.<br /><br />As you can clearly see, stressed vowel 'reading', 'decoding', or 'pronunciation' must be learned syllabically. To determine the correct way to 'read' these vowels is to learn to recognize the syllable spelling code that accurately predicts the pronunciation of the vowel(s) within each syllable.<br /><br />We have devised a fresh new approach to teaching beginning reading that utilizes this natural coding system inherent in Written English and the sorting procedures innate in human learning. It is embodied in an ensemble of software named Reading Buddy 2.0+ that is available on the Internet

The most common answer is basically: &quot;Phonics is the study of the sounds of the alphabet letters that must be learned by children who are learning to read.&quot;<br /><br />Oh! How we wish this were 100% true!<br /><br />http:/we-teach-reading.com  is an innovative computer software designed to overcome the challenges of the English language.  http:/we-teach-reading.com  is available exclusively at  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwe-teach-reading.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://we-teach-reading.com</a> .<br /><br />Most phonics programs teach the sounds of the consonant letters and the sounds of the long and short vowels, but they fail to teach the child WHEN a vowel is supposed to be read with a long vowel sound, a short vowel sound, or some other vowel sound. In short, Phonics fails to teach ALL the necessary rules for vowel pronunciation.<br /><br />Every word has at least one vowel letter. So, even though 6 year-olds can &quot;read&quot; all the consonant letters with ease, they are going to encounter at least one vowel letter in every word that they try to read. If the letter &quot;a&quot; can be read 16 different ways, beginning readers are going to get confused every time they encounter the letter &quot;a&quot; in a word that they have not memorized.<br /><br />It is no wonder that bewildered 6 year-olds fall into the downward spiral of guessing and memorizing in order to compensate for not knowing the vowel pronunciation rules…or how to read the vowel letters. Going from phonics to fluent reading is a giant step for a beginning reader. We can't expect 6 year-olds to bridge this gap automatically without receiving guided, structured instruction as to HOW TO READ the vowel letters.<br /><br />We are not teaching students how to bridge this gap between phonics and fluent reading. We are teaching and over teaching Phonics (or how to read the easy consonant letters). Then we are expecting students to automatically figure out for themselves: HOW to read the complicated vowel letters.<br /><br />We can't keep over-teaching students &quot;how to read the consonant letters&quot; (phonics) and expect Phonics to teach them how to read the vowel letters. To para-phrase Albert Einstein: &quot;We can't keep doing the same thing and expect different results.&quot;<br /><br />Maybe we do this because we, ourselves, were not taught the system for reading vowel letters. Indeed, we didn't know that a natural system existed…much less in every word!<br /><br />THE &quot;SOMETIMES BARRIER&quot;<br /><br />Sometimes a vowel is &quot;long.&quot;<br />Sometimes a vowel is ''short.&quot;<br />Sometimes a vowel is &quot;silent.&quot; …<br /><br />Nobody can look at the letter &quot;a&quot; in isolation and correctly predict its pronunciation. But the good news is: EVERY WORD has a spelling code that tells us how to read its vowel letter(s).<br /><br />Phonics falls short in the teaching of beginning reading because phonics does not teach vowel pronunciation rules or &quot;HOW to read the vowel letter.&quot; It does not teach students WHEN a vowel should be read with a long sound, or a short sound, or a totally different vowel sound.<br /><br />BEYOND THE &quot;SOMETIMES BARRIER&quot;<br /><br />When we go beyond the realm of isolated letters…beyond the realm of Phonics…beyond the confusing &quot;Sometimes Barrier&quot; into the realm of Syllables…into the realm of Syllabics, we find definite spelling/pronunciation codes and relationships. Syllabics accurately predicts when a vowel is to be read with a 'long&quot; vowel sound, or with a &quot;short&quot; vowel sound, or &quot;'otherwise. &quot;<br /><br />3 Examples of the 6 Syllabics Rules:<br />The VC spelling code in &quot;at&quot; tells us the &quot;a&quot; should be read with a &quot;short&quot; vowel sound: /a/ as in &quot;apple&quot;.<br />The VCe spelling code in &quot;ate&quot; tells us that the &quot;a&quot; should be read with a &quot;long&quot; vowel sound: /A/ as in &quot;ape.&quot; The final &quot;e&quot; should be silent.<br />The V V spelling code in &quot;eat&quot; tells us that the &quot;e&quot; should be read with a &quot;long&quot; vowel sound: /E/ as in &quot;eagle&quot;. The &quot;a&quot; should be silent.<br /><br />These are 3 of the 6 spelling/pronunciation code &quot;Rules&quot; for reading vowel letters within words. These 6 spelling/pronunciation codes are visibly recognizable and easily understood and learned even by a 6 year- old. Exceptions to these rules are definitely spelled and predictably pronounced.<br /><br />Theory: Vowel sounds are not coded phonetically, and therefore cannot be decoded (or read) phonetically (using Phonics). Vowel sounds are coded syllabically and therefore must be decoded syllabically (using Syllabics).<br /><br />There are 6 spelling/pronunciation codes inherent in written English that accurately predict vowel pronunciation. These 6 spelling/pronunciation codes can be used to systematically guide beginning readers through the sequential steps necessary for learning how to read all the vowel letters. By learning to read the vowel letters accurately, the student can now take the giant step from &quot;phonics&quot; to &quot;fluent reading&quot; with competence, confidence, and ease.

Children who are given the tools and the opportunities to learn to read both at school and at home have a better chance of success. <br /><br />http:/we-teach-reading.com  is an innovative computer software designed to overcome the challenges of the English language.  http:/we-teach-reading.com  is available exclusively at  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwe-teach-reading.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://we-teach-reading.com</a> .<br /><br />The following are ten tips that can help parents know when they are on track helping their children prepare for reading success.<br /><br />Tip #1: Read with and to Children Regularly<br /><br />Reading at home with children is one of the best ways to ensure that they are ready for reading. It also sends the message that reading is enjoyable and fun. Parents should read with their children at least five times a week.<br /><br />Tip #2: Let Children Explore Books Alone<br /><br />Many parents often make the mistake of strictly controlling the reading opportunities that their children have. They may let their child select the book, but then completely take over from there. All children should be given the time to explore a book before and/or after they read it with a parent or other adult. When the child reaches the point where he or she can read alone, it's still a good idea to not rush into reading, but to encourage exploration first.<br /><br />Tip #3: Show Confidence in the Child's Abilities<br /><br />Children need to believe that they can do something. And, when a child becomes discouraged, it is often a parent's belief in his or her abilities that helps the child over a rough patch. Displaying a lack of confidence can make the child question his or her abilities.<br /><br />Tip #4: Avoid Expressing Worry About the Child's Progress<br /><br />Parents who are worried about a child's reading progress should avoid discussing this with the child. Discussing concerns with the child's teacher or other homeschooling educator is a far better option than risking compounding any reading problems the child is having by bringing them to his or her attention.<br /><br />Tip #5: Encourage Children to Read to Others<br /><br />Parents are built-in audiences for young readers. Parents should encourage their children to read to them often. Grandparents, aunts, uncles, older siblings and cousins, and neighbors are also great audiences.<br /><br />Tip #6: Have Realistic Expectations<br /><br />Parents have been reading for so long that they have understandably forgotten how long it took them to learn to read. Children learn to read at different paces and they begin to learn to read at different ages. Parents need to be sure to accommodate different learning styles to avoid rushing a child into reading or expecting too much from a struggling reader.<br /><br />Tip #7: Avoid Rushing a Reading Session<br /><br />Children should not feel rushed during a reading session. And, parents should avoid feeling conflicted between spending time reading with children and getting something else done. Schedule time for reading when nothing else will interfere.<br /><br />Tip #8: Provide Reading and Writing Opportunities<br /><br />Encourage children to read and write by putting them in charge of the shopping list and sharing letters from friends and relatives. Parents can also help teach children to learn to write by helping them write their own name on letters to friends and relatives. Opportunities for reading and writing development can be found in simple, everyday activities.<br /><br />Tip #9: Provide Appropriate Reading Materials<br /><br />Parents should make sure that their young readers have a wealth of age-appropriate reading material. Be sure to stock the home with books that interest the child. Take the child to the library as well. Encourage children to select their own library books and participate in the library's story time.<br /><br />Tip #10: Nip Problems in the Bud<br /><br />A child who is having trouble reading might have issues that need attention. A child that has trouble might have a learning disorder, hearing problems, or poor vision. Parents should be aware enough to attend to problems as early as possible but not so concerned that they create problems where none exist.

The method has been widely adopted in the United States for decades to teach beginning readers. The term phonics has mistakenly become a catch-all term meaning &quot;the study of all letter sounds.&quot;<br /><br />http:/we-teach-reading.com  is an innovative computer software designed to overcome the challenges of the English language.  http:/we-teach-reading.com  is available exclusively at  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwe-teach-reading.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://we-teach-reading.com</a> .<br /><br />The simplicity of phonics as a teaching method is also the basis of its greatest problem as a tool to teach the reading of English, as we discuss in a moment.<br /><br />The word &quot;phonics&quot; is a shortened term for phonetics. Many languages are phonetic in the sense that one letter always represents the same sound. Unfortunately for beginning readers, written English is not consistently phonetic. This makes written English one of the more difficult languages for people to learn to read and spell.<br /><br />In English the consonant sounds are mostly phonetic. As a result, we can generally use phonics methods to begin to teach students to read the consonant letters. Even so, students will have to learn a few exceptions to the wholesale application of phonics to the pronunciation of consonants.<br /><br />The situation is substantially different for vowel letters. In English, vowel sounds are not coded phonetically. This is because every vowel letter can represent several vowel sounds. For example, the vowel letter &quot;a&quot; is read differently in the words at and ate. Students (both children and adults) can readily see the visual distinction between at and ate, but are too often at a loss about why we read the letter &quot;a&quot; as a short vowel in at and a long vowel in ate.<br /><br />Using a learning-to-read technique based entirely on phonics presents beginning readers with unwarranted confusion, stress and frustration when they try to &quot;read&quot; vowel letters phonetically.<br /><br />There is a new and innovative way that systematically helps beginning readers to know when each of the different sounds associated with a specific vowel is applicable and when it is not. It's called Reading Buddy 2.0+.<br /><br />Reading Buddy 2.0+ uses an approach substantially different from phonics. When students have mastered reading all the consonants and the six main consonant blends, they are ready for the only thing left for them to learn: how to read the vowel letters, a, e, i, o, and u. The secret to reading a vowel letter correctly is in the way the word is spelled…or what Reading Buddy 2.0+ refers to as its secret spelling code. Every word has a secret spelling code that clearly tells the student how to read each vowel letter in that word. Because they are the easiest to learn, Reading Buddy 2.0+ begins with the shortest words (one syllable words). After students have mastered the secret spelling codes, which enable them not only to recognize how virtually any one-syllable word is pronounced and spelled, they are almost ready to leap forward to multi-syllable words.<br /><br />The most common spelling code is what has been arbitrarily termed by many reading experts as the &quot;VC&quot; code. A word with the VC code contains only one vowel letter and ends with a consonant letter. For example, consider the words at, sat, and scratch.<br /><br />The rule for a word that has the VC spelling code is to read the vowel with a short vowel sound. Once students have mastered this rule, they can then confidently apply the rule to any word with the VC code, &quot;sounding-out&quot; all the consonants and vowels in order to &quot;read&quot; the word correctly. Applying the simple rule makes it completely unnecessary for students to guess or to memorize how to pronounce the letters.

Once these skills are learned and then practiced repeatedly, we can perform them without our being consciously aware of it. At that time, cognitive scientists say that we can perform them automatically.<br /><br />http:/we-teach-reading.com  is an innovative computer software designed to overcome the challenges of the English language.  http:/we-teach-reading.com  is available exclusively at  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwe-teach-reading.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://we-teach-reading.com</a> .<br /><br />What are the necessary skills that anyone (child or adult) attempting to learn to read (or write) English must have?<br /><br />1. The student must be able to recognize each letter of the alphabet as a unique graphic. Not only is it necessary that the student be able to tell the difference between the letter a and the letter z, the student must be able to know that the letters b, d, g, and p are different objects, even though they can be formed by rotating or obtaining the mirror image of another.<br />2. The student must be able to state confidently the name of every letter. For example, that the letter b has a name that we pronounce be, and the name of the letter I is pronounced as if it were spelled eye.<br />3. Another prerequisite is that the student must understand that each letter can be represented as a lowercase character and an uppercase character (for example, A and a represent the same letter). In addition, the student must appreciate the fact that for some letters, the uppercase and lowercase forms have similar shapes (for example, M and m, O and o) but for other letters the uppercase and lowercase forms appear wholly unrelated. Examples include A and a, G and g, H and h, R and r.<br />4. Further, it is essential that the student be able to pronounce the sound associated with each consonant letter (that is, the letter B is pronounced as if it were spelled Buh). The pronunciation of consonants in English is simplified by the fact that most (but not all) consonants are pronounced in only one way.<br />5. In addition, the student needs to comprehend that some letters are designated consonants and others are vowels, and the student must know to which category each letter falls.<br />6. Finally, it is essential that the student know how to pronounce the six most common two-letter blends before starting a reading program (or learns soon after starting one). These blends are ch, ph, qu, sh, th, wh.<br /><br />When young children have mastered the basic skills to the point that they can perform them confidently and errorlessly, they are read to learn to read. Their chronological age simply does not matter.<br /><br />Parents and teachers often find it difficult to be totally objective in judging a specific child's readiness to read, perhaps saying to themselves that Susie or Johnny probably knows these essentials &quot;well enough&quot; without having done any real testing. Programs such as Reading Buddy 2.0+ provides a component, the Reading Readiness Assessment, that evaluates students' proficiency levels for each of the critical pre-requisites for success in any learning to read instructional program.<br /><br />Available in two versions, Abbreviated and Comprehensive, the assessment procedures determine students' mastery of the basic prerequisite skills described earlier. The Abbreviated version presents a critical subset of these items so that parents or teachers can quickly determine a student's readiness. If students are sufficiently accurate, the teacher is advised to direct their attention to the core of the software -- learning the 6 Secret Codes. On the other hand, when students do not achieve an appropriate score, the teacher may wish to administer the Comprehensive Reading Readiness Assessment that probes more fully and specifies which of the remedial Reading Prep Games would be helpful in bringing such students up to speed

Homophonics Code for reading unstressed vowels in multi-syllable words. (multi-syllable word-level skill)<br /><br />When we are LEARNING HOW to read, we do NOT need to learn all three codes at once… which is today's practice. Nor do we need to learn two codes at the same time. It is far easier for the beginning reader to tackle and master these three codes just one at a time.

Drill your young reader over and over asking for the NAMES of all the letters of the alphabet.<br />2. After the student masters step 1, remove the vowel letters from the flashcards: a, e, i, o, u.<br />Ask the student to 'READ' each consonant letter as you randomly present each flashcard.<br />[To READ the letter 'b', the student reads: /buh/… not the NAME of the letter: 'b'.]<br />3. After the student masters step 2, you 'read' the consonant letters randomly. Ask the student to write the consonant letter you read. [You read: /buh/… (s)he writes: b.]<br />4. After the student masters step 3, make flashcards for the consonant blends: ch, ph, qu, sh, th, wh. Ask the student to 'read' each consonant blend as you randomly present the flashcard.<br />(To read the blend 'ch', the student reads: /chuh/ …not the names of the letters 'c'-'h'.)<br />5. After the student masters step 4, you 'read' the consonant blends randomly, ask the student to write the blend you read. [You read: &quot;chuh&quot;…(s)he writes: ch.]<br /><br />Make sure your beginning reader makes zero mistakes for all 5 steps at the letter level. If (s)he is struggling with even one letter or blend, drill until (s)he overlearns everything.<br /><br />After mastering the 5 steps above, your beginning reader is ready to begin learning how to read the vowel letters: a, e, i, o, and u.<br /><br />Because students haven't been taught clear-cut vowel reading, or decoding, or pronunciation skills, beginning readers develop compensatory skills such as guessing, memorization, using picture clues, using context clues, etc. to figure out how to read the vowel letters. When these unreliable skills are replaced with definite, predictable, reliable vowel decoding skills, the beginning reading student develops confidence in his/her ability to actually 'read' each word. [Clarification: Student's may use picture or context clues to figure out the MEANING of a word…but these are not reliable skills for learning how to 'read' the vowel letters.]<br /><br />Read How Learning to Read Really Works - Part 4 of this article to learn the Vowel Decoding RULES.

However, the value of reading is often evaluated differently for the homeschooled child than it is for the traditionally-schooled child. Traditionally-schooled children are regularly tested on their reading ability because traditional teaching methods rely heavily on a child's reading ability as a way for children to learn other subject matter. As a matter of fact, teaching reading is so important to the traditionally-schooled child that such children rarely achieve academic success without first mastering basic reading skills.<br /><br />http:/we-teach-reading.com  is an innovative computer software designed to overcome the challenges of the English language.  http:/we-teach-reading.com  is available exclusively at  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwe-teach-reading.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://we-teach-reading.com</a> .<br /><br />Early Reading Skills vs. Developmental Readiness<br /><br />The reading picture has evolved somewhat differently for the homeschooled child. Homeschooled children have advantages that make the development of reading skills less pressing than they are for traditionally-schooled children. As a matter of fact, some homeschooling experts insist that there is no need to worry about forcing the development of reading skills in homeschooled children and that many homeschooled children don't master reading until several years after the traditionally-schooled child. Many homeschooling educators believe that teaching reading is something that happens naturally.<br /><br />The primary reason why homeschooled children may not require early mastery of reading skills is because they are taught in different ways than traditionally-schooled children. The traditionally-schooled child must adhere to a set standard designed to ensure that all children develop at the relatively same pace. Teaching dozens of children the same material requires that those children be at the same basic level of preparation. A public school teacher faced with teaching ten, twenty, or even thirty children at varying learning stages is likely to be unsuccessful at such an endeavor. Ensuring that children learn certain skills by a certain age simply makes teaching large groups of students more efficient.<br /><br />Maria Montessori and Teaching Reading<br /><br />The work of Maria Montessori changed the face of teaching reading and opened the door to a new homeschooling movement. Dr. Montessori uprooted traditional teaching theories by presenting research that children learn at varying rates and that hands-on activities enable children to learn better and more completely than traditional rote memorization teaching techniques. Her work in the late 1800?s and early 1900?s also proved that mixing multiple learning levels in the same classroom actually benefits children rather than hindering them. Children, regardless of age, learn from each other. Older children inadvertently teach younger children. And, younger children give older children the opportunity to learn by doing. However, because of the somewhat individualized teaching present within the Montessori classroom, employing this method within the public school environment is not always feasible. More about Dr. Montessori's work can be found at <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.montessori.edu"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.montessori.edu</a>.<br /><br />Intentionally or unintentionally, homeschooling is rather Montessori-like in the practical application of homeschooling teaching methods. Like Maria Montessori's theories, homeschooling emphasizes the individual learning style of the student over the need to teach certain skills by a certain age. The child who is a weak reader might be verbally advanced, and vice versa, meaning that the home school teaching partner plays on each child's strengths to teach each individual child. This format is far easier to implement within the homeschooling environment than it is in the traditional school setting.<br /><br />Standardized Assessments Encourage Early Reading Skills<br /><br />The drive toward assessing student progress has invaded what was once a rather freestyle homeschooling environment. Students nationwide are now expected to perform at certain levels based on age and academic grade. And, although standardized assessments are good indicators of overall performance, they are somewhat stifling to homeschooling enthusiasts and fail to consider the different learning styles and speeds of individual learners. In essence, standardized assessments, which are now required of many homeschooled children, are ultimately forcing homeschooling educators to ensure that their students learn academic skills at roughly the same rate as traditionally-schooled children. This means that teaching reading has become more important within the home school format.<br /><br />Many educators, homeschooling and traditional, abhor standardized testing. Still, it looks like it's here to stay, at least for the moment. And, for the homeschooled child to meet the expected standards and to stay on track, that child has to have mastered certain skills, especially reading, by a relatively early age. In situations where standardized testing is an important assessment tool, children who fail to develop early reading skills are likely to be incorrectly assessed. And, an incorrect assessment is dangerous to both the child and the homeschooling program. For this reason, it's important for homeschooling educators to emphasize reading skills as a learning tool and that they emphasize teaching reading.<br /><br />Reading as More Than Merely a Skill<br /><br />Teaching reading to children as early as possible does not have to be a perceived slight to the homeschooling tradition. Although, like Maria Montessori, many homeschooling educators take issue with forcing children to learn any skill before they are developmentally ready, there is no research that indicates that teaching children to read early harms their future development in any way. So, other than the obvious difficulties of teaching children skills they may not be prepared to learn, early reading development might not be such a bad idea.<br /><br />The benefits of reading are well-documented. Reading is fun, opens doors to new subjects and adventures, and helps prepare children to think critically and embrace information that is both educational and entertaining. Reading is so important to today's teaching methods that its importance spills over into the areas of mathematics, social studies, science, and more. The student who is interested in reading develops faster in many academic areas than students who are unprepared with basic reading skills.<br /><br />Parents, working as homeschooling educators or with others who are homeschooling providers, have a variety of tools at their disposal to encourage their child's early reading skills. Some experts insist that the first ten years are crucial for reading development and that teaching reading and a love of reading before the age of ten sets the stage for a lifetime of reading enjoyment. Many theories expound the belief that reading to young children helps them develop a love for reading. Young children then express a desire to read on their own, they then practice reading by doing, and subsequently read for their own satisfaction and/or pleasure. A child who has become a regular reader and who truly enjoys reading lives in a world that is forever enriched and expanded by this one simple tool -- reading.
