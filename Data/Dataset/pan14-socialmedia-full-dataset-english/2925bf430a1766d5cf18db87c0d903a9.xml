Both individuals and companies can benefit from training themselves or their employees. By knowing more about international trade, you will be more able to handle the day to day activities that are associated with it. <br /><br />Whether you are looking for courses on how to import and export as an individual or as a business owner, a company called ABTS Training Services can help you. <br /><br />Training for Individuals <br /><br />Many times if you want a new career, you will have to make some changes. You have to look for the new job, and in some cases, you will need training in order to prepare for a career in a new field. For example, you might currently work with a business that trades domestically. If you want to work in the field of international trade, you will need training before you can find work with a company that trades internationally or before you can pursue an advanced degree or level of certification. <br /><br />Fortunately, ABTS Training Services offers a variety of courses on how to import and export. They have a number of one day courses, an intensive course, and they are working on an online course. This online course is not quite completed, but they do have a preview option available on their website. <br /><br />The intensive course is a great option for beginners. This course covers all aspects of importing and exporting, such as documents, procedures, international purchasing, and more. Students will attend the course for five weeks, but classes only occur on Saturdays. This makes this course a convenient option for those people who have jobs or busy schedules. <br /><br />If you need to focus on a specific aspect of international trade, such as importing, ABTS Training Services offers one day classes on more specific topics. For example, they have one day classes on international purchasing, importing, exporting, and the 2010 Incoterms. <br /><br />Training for Groups of Employees <br /><br />If you own a business and you need training courses on how to import and export, ABTS Training Services can help you. When a business expands into the realm of international trade, it will likely need to prepare and train its employees. <br /><br />ABTS Training Services offers training for groups of employees who might not be able to come to their training facility in London.

ABTS will send a qualified instructor to your facility, and this person can train as many employees as you need for one flat rate. <br /><br />ABTS instructors take the time to learn about your company and your specific needs.
