<br />No sleep until I am done with finding the answer 
<br />Won't stop 
<br />Won't stop before I find a cure for this cancer 
<br />Sometimes 
<br />I feel I going down and so disconnected 
<br />Somehow 
<br />I know that I am haunted to be wanted 
<br /><br />I've been watching 
<br />I've been waiting 
<br />In the shadows all my time 
<br />I've been searching 
<br />I've been living 
<br />For tomorrows all my life 
<br /><br />In the shadows 
<br /><br />In the shadows 
<br /><br />They say 
<br />That i must learn to kill before i can feel safe 
<br />But I 
<br />I rather kill myself then turn into their slave 
<br />Sometimes 
<br />I feel that I should go and play with the thunder 
<br />Somehow 
<br />I just don't wanna stay and wait for a wonder 
<br /><br />I've been watching 
<br />I've been waiting 
<br />In the shadows all my time 
<br />I've been searching 
<br />I've been living 
<br />For tomorrows all my life 
<br /><br />Lately I been walking walking in circles, watching waiting for something 
<br />Feel me touch me heal me, come take me higher 
<br /><br />I've been watching 
<br />I've been waiting 
<br />In the shadows all my time 
<br />I've been searching 
<br />I've been living 
<br />For tomorrows all my life 
<br />I've been watching 
<br />I've been waiting 
<br />I've been searching 
<br />I've been living for tomorrows 
<br /><br />In the shadows 
<br /><br />In the shadows 
<br />I've been waiting

<br />Like a dream it shines, from heaven's safe keep
<br />Childrens songs we sung, as soft as the breeze
<br />Endless fields, our home, I long for those days
<br /><br />I call out these prayers to the sky, heavy with thought, see your face
<br />I carry these memories inside, thoughts of a soul colored by love
<br />See me grow wings and fly high, passions will die down below
<br />I burn in a basin of fire, watchers look on as they dance in their merciless sky
<br />Watching me, watching you
<br /><br />Silent black, the dawn, and time tell its tale
<br />Darkened blood, it flows, the forest receives
<br />Look within the dark as deep as you dare
<br />There inside you find destruction you seek
<br /><br />I call out these prayers to the sky, heavy with thought, see your face
<br />I carry these memories inside, thoughts of a soul colored by love
<br />See me grow wings and fly high, passions will die down below
<br />I burn in a basin of fire, watchers look on as they dance in their merciless sky
<br />Watching me, watching you

<br />Slipping through the trees, strangling the breeze
<br />Dead I am the sky, watching angels cry
<br />While they slowly turn, conquering the worm

<br />Burn through the witches

<br />Burn through the witches
<br />I slam in the back of my

<br /><br />Dig through the ditches,
<br />Burn through the witches

<br /><br />Do it baby, do it baby
<br />Do it baby, do it baby
<br />Burn like an animal
<br /><br />Dead I am the life, dig into the skin
<br />Knuckle crack the bone, 21 to win
<br />Dead I am the dog, hound of hell you cry
<br />Devil on your back, I can never die
<br /><br />Dig through the ditches,
<br />Burn through the witches

<br />well they are time bombs and they are ticking
<br />and the only question's when they'll blow up
<br />and they'll blow up; we know that without a doubt
<br />cause they're those girls, yeah you know those girls that let their emotions get the best of them
<br /><br />and i've contrived some sort of a plan to help my fellow man
<br />let's get emotional girls to all wear mood rings
<br />so we'll be tipped off to when they're ticked off
<br />cause we'll know just what they're thinking
<br />cause what they're thinking...
<br /><br />she's so pretty but she but doesn't always act that way
<br />her mood's out swinging on the swing set almost every day
<br />she said to me that she's so happy it's depressing
<br />and all i said was &quot;someone get that girl a mood ring&quot;
<br /><br />if it's drama you want then look no further
<br />they're like the real world meets boy meets world meets days of our lives
<br />and it just kills me how they get away with murder
<br />they'll anger you then bat their eyes; those pretty eyes that watch you sympathize
<br /><br />and i've contrived some sort of a plan to help my fellow man
<br />let's get emotional girls to all wear mood rings
<br />so we'll be tipped off to when they're ticked off
<br />cause we'll know just what they're thinking
<br />cause what they're thinking...
<br /><br />she's so pretty but she but doesn't always act that way
<br />her mood's out swinging on the swing set almost every day
<br />she said to me that she's so stressed out that it's soothing
<br />and all i said was &quot;someone get that girl a mood ring&quot;
<br /><br />cause when it's black (it) means watch your back because you're probably
<br />the last person in the world right now she wants to see
<br />and when it's blue it means that you should call her up immediately
<br />and ask her out because she'll most likely agree
<br />and when it's green it simply means that she is really stressed
<br />and when it's clear it means she's completely emotionless (and that's all right i must confess)
<br /><br />we all know the girls that i am talking about
<br />she liked you wednesday but now it's friday and she has to wash her hair
<br />and it just figures that we'll never figure them out
<br />first she's jekyll and then she's hyde....at least she makes a lovely pair
<br /><br />mood ring oh mood ring
<br />oh tell me will you bring
<br />the key to unlock this mystery
<br />of girls and their emotions
<br />play it back in slow motion
<br />so i may understand the complex infrastructure known as the female mind
<br /><br />[speaking:]
<br />heh...that's terrible

<br />thank god
<br />many people think im odd
<br />but i talk with no one and I walk alone and I aviod sunlight with a chalky tone I get home and dont say hi,
<br />it aint no one there
<br />I dont care I walk in and go right up the stairs to my room,
<br />get in bed and just for for dark,
<br />because that's when the real show starts (tap tap)
<br />&quot;tap tap&quot; on the glass go the piece of ass,
<br />so young and pretty it's to bad she past 
<br />but she comes to my room and we talk at night,
<br />she's demonic and bloody,
<br />but she holds me tight
<br />In my bedroom
<br />with her I'm never alone,
<br />and I kiss her cold lips until the morning come
<br />and she gone,
<br />I can still hear her voice loom,
<br />but she only exist in the dark of my room
<br />LOVE...
<br />(I can't ignore you)
<br />IN MY ROOM...
<br />(do anything for you baby)(Tap Tap)
<br />LOVE...(I do adore you)
<br />IN MY ROOM...(Tap Tap go the piece of ass)
<br />YOU AND I (x2)
<br /><br />I try to smile alot but I'm always frontin',
<br />but I do love a ghost and at least that's somthin'
<br />She dont talk much,
<br />when she do it gets cold,
<br />Usually we just lay there and we hold each other
<br />we're lovers,
<br />we don't need others,
<br />one of my mothers cats jumped up on the covers 
<br />and it scared my baby,
<br />guess she dont like pets
<br />so I twisted it's fuckin head off at the neck
<br />look baby,
<br />it's bloody,
<br />it's gone,
<br />it's doomed,
<br />please
<br />come back to the room
<br />I'll do anything for thy,
<br />don't ignore me,
<br />this is more than a sick love story
<br />without you I'd bring a shot gun to school and I will if you want me to.
<br />For any reason
<br />I hate that you leave when the lights come on 
<br />And if I had it my way the fuckin' sun would be gone
<br />(chourse x2)
<br />Sometimes I kiss her,
<br />I start shakin',
<br />She slips me the toungue and it's taste like bacon
<br />Uh-oh,
<br />Somthing's wrong
<br />baby's upset,
<br />she told me she was spotted by the neighbor's kid
<br />She can't come back now 'cuase they know our secret,
<br />unless I can make them keep it.
<br />If I do she may come to life,
<br />now I'm in their yard with a shotgun and knife
<br />Cut the screen,
<br />went in and found the kid,
<br />blew a bowl of spaghetti in the side of his head
<br />the daddy was next runnin' down the hall,
<br />I shredded his throat and he was quick to fall
<br />Tossed the Mossberg and gripped the knife,
<br />started stabbin' the shit outta his wife
<br />Went home a bloody mess with a job well done,(Tap Tap)
<br />wash up and wait for my baby to come
<br />(chourse x2)
<br /><br />I waited 2 or 3 days
<br />4 days,
<br />waitin for the tap tap like always
<br />I waited
<br />and hated this(Tap Tap) I
<br />created a bloody mess (Tap Tap)
<br />I waited 2 or 3 months 
<br />4 months
<br />waitn' for the tap tap just for once
<br />I waited
<br />and hated this (Tap Tap) I
<br />created a bloody mess (Tap Tap)
<br />I waited 2 or 3 days
<br />4 days,
<br />waitin for the tap tap like always
<br />I waited
<br />and hate this (Tap Tap) I
<br />created a bloody mess (Tap Tap)
<br />I waited 2 or 3 months 
<br />4 months
<br />waitn' for the tap tap just for once

<br />There’s no blood 
<br />There’s no alibi 
<br />‘Cause I’ve drawn regret 
<br />From the truth 
<br />Of a thousand lies 
<br /><br />[Pre-Chorus]
<br />So let mercy come 
<br />And wash away 
<br />What I’ve done

<br />I’ve faced myself 
<br />To cross out what I’ve become 
<br />Erase myself 
<br />And let go of what I’ve done 
<br /><br />Put to rest
<br />What you thought of me 
<br />Well I cleaned this slate 
<br />With the hands 
<br />Of uncertainty

<br /><br />Grab the bull by the horns the old adage goes.
<br />Nobody tells you where to go from there.
<br />Seems like fate's pulling you.
<br />Decisions have to be made.
<br />The best path is the hardest earned.
<br /><br />Back and forth the struggle consumes us all.
<br />Trying to keep a level head.
<br />In the most unsettling of times.
<br />Today I'll become the bull.
<br /><br />There is so much to stake.
<br />I stumble I lose my place.
<br />Pride and arrogance surrounded by sin.
<br />Destiny takes its hold.
<br />Fight it or let it go.
<br />But I choose how the day will end.
<br /><br />Back and forth the struggle consumes us all.
<br />Trying to keep a level head.
<br />In the most unsettling of times.
<br />Today I become the bull. [x2]
<br /><br />This walk can get lonely.
<br />I lose myself inside my head.
<br />No one can touch you when you're outside staring in.
<br />Remove myself from this rat race.
<br /><br />Back and forth the struggle consumes us all.
<br />Trying to keep a level head.
<br />In the most unsettling of times.
<br />Today I become the bull. [x5]

<br />By: Ethan M. Hirn
<br /><br />Every day…
<br />Everywhere…
<br />It disgusts me…
<br />Hurts me…
<br />Tears me apart…
<br />They seem to do it on purpose…
<br />Like they know what it does to me…
<br />They know and don’t care…
<br />Don’t care that it makes me closer…
<br />Closer and closer to the end…
<br />The end of my life…
<br />Love…
<br />Romance…
<br />It makes me sick…
<br />Is it meant to make you happy?
<br />Or is it only used to torture?
<br />Torture those who never will feel…
<br />Never will feel love…
<br />To make them feel more alone?
<br />No…
<br />Not to make them feel alone…
<br />To make them closer…
<br />Closer to the end…
<br />Closer to that friendly word…
<br />That word that seems horrible at first…
<br />But…
<br />But slowly it starts to seem like destiny…
<br />Their only way…
<br />The only true experience they will ever feel…
<br />What is this word?
<br />Is it love?
<br />Love…
<br />If it were love they’d have been happier a long time ago…
<br />No…
<br />No one loves these low lives…
<br />Is it romance?
<br />Romance…
<br />If it were that they’d be going on with life…
<br />No…
<br />These fools will never feel romance…
<br />What is it?
<br />What is this accursed word?
<br />Is it hate?
<br />Hate…
<br />These poor useless creatures felt hate their entire lives…
<br />They would never want anyone to feel that…
<br />Feel that pain…
<br />No…
<br />It is…
<br />It is suicide…
<br />The one word that gives an ending to pain…
<br />An ending to sorrow…
<br />An ending to hate…
<br />An ending to love…
<br />An ending to Romance…
<br />An end…
<br />A true end…
<br />And you know what they feel?
<br />They feel…
<br />Free…
<br />…
<br /><br />~*Dedicated to all the useless time I spent trying to be happy*~

<br />But it's like no matter what I do, I can't convince you, to just believe

<br />I am what you never wanna say but I've never had a doubt
