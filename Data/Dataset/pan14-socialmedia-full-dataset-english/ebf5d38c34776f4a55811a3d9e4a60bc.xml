Waitin' for a check,  waitin', but the only thing on the line is my neck.  I want a kiss from my baby,  but can't even feel a peck.  Not on my cheek, not on my lips, and at night all I feel's lonliness.  And those I thought would forever be by myside, I lost confidence in to be down to ride.  It seems all I've really got is what's down inside, and praise the lord for my greatest ally.  I beg and pray, that my maker, my creator will forgive my transgressions, and look at my troubles and make intersessions.  Please help my soul, fill up my cup and my bowl, and feed me, believe me, cause I'm callin',  and I need thee.  Amen.

But that's not my path,  which I should have known, for it's the rougher path, that I call home.  Always and ever, I'm tryin' to stray, from the narrow path, the better way.  Always tempted but rarely decieved, doubtin' the one in which I've believed.  It's just my curse, born of Eve, to always and forever, temptation recieve.  But a stronger man with faith I'll be,  if I'll just look up to the light and see.  It's a path of light, always and forever, never changin', never ever, and it's tough like leather.  But it's always my path,  though rough, it's mine.  And it'll always be that way till the end of my time.

A whisper of a touch, my hands across your arms, and my lips to yo' lips, with some tongue's the charm.  Your breath got deeper, and we kissed a kiss,  that made the world dim,  brought us to bliss.  Our bodies got close, and heat got deeper, and by the end of the night, you were the sleeper.  But till that time,  we made love like no other, I pleased you in ways, that made us love one another.  I used my tongue to caress, and my lips to touch, and other parts of me, made you pleasured so much.  But the thing that made it real,  and matter so much,  is that we waited for marriage, for that sensual touch.  We waited for one another,  and that brought us together, even at night when I teased you, and I brought out that feather.  We could have done the usual, and had sex when we met, but because we waited till marriage, our love on the rock was set.  No sand for our house,  cause we're blessed by I AM.  Now we're free to love and be loved, and to start us a fam.  Now that's strength.

Simple as temptation, but complicated as shakes, and tears that fall, when our interior quakes.  I ain't blind to the battle, and that makes me a prime target, but I'm still above ground, not under dirt and tar yet.  The nets can ensnare me,  and the arrows can pierce,  that's why the word leads this warrior so fierce. Not Fierce by my own accord, but of the power of God.  I ain't blind to this battle, I ain't blind to the odds.

Damn that man who can't control himself, cause if he can't do it, there's nobody else.  Damn that man who lied and deceived and because of it, lost trust in those he believed.  Damn that man, who hurt his people,  when all they did was put him behind the pulpit, the steeple.  Damn that man that walks with a demon, he wants to be good but just acts like a heathen.  Damn that man, for bein' so weak, and damn that man for makin' his life so bleak.  Damn that man who put that gun in my hand, too bad it's my gun, and I'm that man.

But I don't question myself, cause man, this is me, you can't hide what's inside when you bleed.  It's life's why,  I just relate to nature more than most, I'm not tryin' to esteem myself, not tryin' to boast.  But I ain't got nothin' to hide, my stuggles are known, cause millions more live my struggles, the stuggles they own.  I won't hide what's already no secret to many, what makes the difference that they happened to me,  instead of to Jermaine or Jenny, Jordan or Penny, Dupree, George, Janel, or Freddy.  Just a personal perspective it what makes it unique, but we all got struggles and they all seem bleak.  So when I tell myself, you can feel what I say,  cause we're all human, we all hate, love, and play.  You can feelin' what I'm sayin', and I'm sayin' this now.  When I tell what I tell, ain't no hatin' bringin' me down.

I'm tired of a night, with nobody to hold.  I'm tired of thinkin' it's like this 'till I'm old.  I'm tired of bein' a king with no queen.  Tired of distance, tired of travel.  Tired of strugglin' through emotions like gravel.  Tired of hurtin', for such and such.  Tired of lovin' a woman, just way too dang much.  Tired of bein' hurt, tired of holdin' it inside.  Tired of bein' a man, havin' never have cried.  I'm just Tired.

So when God took our baby, maybe we were blessed.  I know to some that might not sound right, but nobody realized the true nature of the fight.  My baby would have lived, but lived a life that wasn't whole, my baby would have lived, but would have lived so cold.  Nobody understands the pain I have, it's goes deeper than most, my sadness, a demon, and I am it's host.  It's a struggle you see, not to let my demon multiply, and grow inside you, before I let die.  But let die I'll have to or I won't survive, let it burn in my soul, and never question it, why?  Why do things happen the way that they do.  I don't know, why is the grass green, or the sky sometimes blue?  Some things we have answers to, and some things we don't.  Things happen how they happen, and question I won't.  I only look to the sky and thank my God for my days, because he's blessed me, in so many ways.  Look at him and blame him, for a pain of the day?  Naw, just remember Job, cause he had more loss than my way.  You may criticise me for not showin' anger.  But it's hard when I think of Jesus, from the cross to the manger.  Am I a saint? No.  Am I better than you? No.  But when the blow comes to blow, and I know what I know, feel what I feel, when my time comes for death, I know what is real.  I've lived the life, and I've seen dark angels and light.  I've stuggle a lot, but it's not about who is the right, or who is the wrong, it's not even really about the words of this psalm.  It's just the feelin' in my soul, that I can't deny.  So when my time comes for death, I know that I'll fly.

Cause this is a true test of your character's backbone, if it cracks holmes, go back home, leave realness alone.  When trials come, smile some, and thank time for the test, relentless to be the best at handlin' life, handlin' strife.  Usin' the most deadly weapon of deadly, the words cut like a knife.  When the trial is inside, let's see who can stop my life, let's see who's really down to ride.  Could you handle my anger, could you handle my pain, could you handle my love, or would you let it all drain.  Drip, drip, drop, drip drip drop.  Let it drain outta your soul, or make it to the top.  The strongest survive,  this is survival of the fittest,  what don't kill you makes you stronger, somebody tell where's my witness?  This is every action, reaction you deal with on a day, so be positive, live good, and then you can say.  No not he, not her,  I'm the strongest one today.  Me, myself, I, can make it through anything, till my time comes to die.  Blood and tears don't lie,  make it through them, and you'll be the one, the prodigal son, prodigal daughter, and the world on your shoulders no longer weighs a ton.  It's just dust.  Brush it off.

It confuses me,  cause there's miles between me and you.  But the connection we have, I know what to do.  You love me, it's crazy, I've never seen your face, except on a screen, when you've got your pic in place.  Yeah, it's crazy, but what can I say?  I'mma gonna pay a thousand dollars, just to drive by your way.  If I ain't in love, than just call me a fool.  Cause honestly this feelin' is makin' me lose all my cool.  You've connected with me on every level I own.  From Jesus, to my family,  and you've reaped what I've sown.  I've sown a seed deep down in the earth of this temple, and though seeminly complicated, it's really just simple.  Miles, money, and time, won't stand up to the test, when put next to the love, which with we've been blessed.  I love you mi mami, that's all I can say, you bless my life in every way.  Never a sorrow from your lips, directed my way,  and we've been had our debts, but were able to pay.  So pay me what's due, and come to me now.  While I take a knee, askin' a question deep down.  Will your life be mine, and my life be yours.  I know that your worth it,  I've opened my doors.  Please come in and accept what I've graciously given.  Because in this thing they call love,  I know we're both winnin'.  You're worth it mami.  You're worth it.

Gave me that feelin' deep down in my gut, definately not my average day, wasn't down in no rut.  But when it hit, it hit hard, and deep, and as the sweat dripped, deliriously wantin' to go to sleep, I looked up and smiled, tryin' to find my bed.  I kept my face up as everythin' spun in my head.  Some would think love, a color like indigo, but it wasn't love at all, damn it was vertigo.  Naw, for real, not no love at all,  but my world spun, when I went for that fall.

I don't think I'd wanna die chillin', and I know not dealin'.  I'd wanna love to the last inch of my body, and have the heart of Mayweather vs. Gotti.  May not be a show,  but I'd shout to my last,  and at my dyin' breath, feel blessed as I pass.  If it was my last day, I wouldn't want nobody to cry, cause I know where I'm goin', I'm ready to die.  Don't get me wrong, it's my life that I love, but it's my hunger inside feenin' for my heaven above.  It's not by my works, but by the word and the law, that I'm gonna fly wanna these days, I can't wait for it all.  But till my last day, which might be today, I'm ponder what I'm doin', and what I could say.  But what if today, is my last day I'm here, then I'm waistin' my time, I have somethin' to fear.  I fear my last day, that it might be today.  What if I waste my last day, do I choose the right way?  How would I be remembered if today was my last.  Guess I should look to the present, instead of the past.  Live life like a moment,  cause if this was it, I'd wanna die knowin' that I'm happy wit' it.

But that's not my love, it's more like, rough around the edges.  There's powers, and principles involved, in depth and pledges.  Cause Baby I pledge alliegence to you if you'll do the same.  Me and you verse the world, we can do our own thang.  But if I'mma commit, know that I'm not near flawless.  Gotta lotta things within' me that make this beast pawless.  I'm a lion among bee's, and I'm reakin' the sweets.  But you can't forget that a lion, really needs subtance and meats. So don't criticize the animal for what he is.  It's my nature to take, hate, and forget, instead of to love and to give.  I got the heart of an angel,  but the body of a demon.  And I'm constantly in a struggle between my heart and my semen.  Battlin' between a disciple, and another kinda demon deacon.  I just gotta look up to the light, and full out for that beacon.  That's me mami,  so if you love me, than know....nobody's perfect baby, and I'm sayin' that's so.  In my case, or another, that's life, that's us.  But you look and you can see, that we will always have trust....love and friendship, and a team of teams.  So who really cares if it's really rough, or off around the seams.  It's the core of the man, that I offer you now, and a foundation for a house, built on the solidest ground.  No sand for our castle, no dirt for our home.  Just me and you baby, with ours and our own.

I look at my path and I look at my way, and realize that for this path, I'm the one to blame.  So if I don't progress,  I detest to be negative.  I look back on what he said, and instead of what he said he did, he became me.  I'm just exactly what I never wanted to be.  And I can't turn back the pages, I see what I wanted in me.  But never lost, like a tear in the rain, and like the blood that flows on the battlefield.  My soul is kept, but I'm so ignorant of wisdom.  Please forgive my ignorance, for I am weak and lowly.  My life naught but hated solely.  But with my hate comes love and a look from above, and when the waters rose high, I saw my dove.  Praise be to I AM, for all that I am.  If it wasn't for him, I'd be just a lost man.  Amen.

Sittin' here thinkin' 'bout how lonely it gets, and yet, I'm still here sittin', wit' my brother just callin' out bets.  Just sittin' here waitin', workin', wishin'.  Games, shows, and money, not doin' no fishin'.  A fisherman of man I was told to be, but at this point in life,  I'm only fishin' for me.  I can't help it,  I'm lonely, hurtin', and am just selfish I guess,  'cause I wanna hold you mami, feelin' flesh against flesh.  My power and yours, united in comfort.  I long for that love, deeper than that some sort.......of thing that you crave in your heart.  I'm lonely I guess...I guess that's my part.  No helpin' others, not my enemy or brother.  I'm forgettin' the past, even my own mother.  Simply cause I sit here, lonely and stressed, instead of lookin' at how many ways,  I'm not under durress.  Thank you, I say it,  for helpin' me now,  'cause I realize dear lord, that I'm not under ground.  Not under dirt, and no stains on my shirt.  Though I don't have a mami,  I'm not all that hurt.  After all, you're the friend who's never forsaken.  So in the bitter watches of the night,  when I'm so cold I'm shakin'....I know you'll be here to hear me, and say it's okay she's not there, 'cause there is a girl comin'...she's out there somewhere.  Time and patience my brother, time and patience my son.  Life may be hurtin' you now, but you're far from done.  Thank you my lord for my comfort and soul.  Without you I'd be lost, just broken, unwhole.  Thank you lord.  Thank you God.  I'm your child, and odd.  But better be odd, than be it alone.  I'm glad beyond measure that my heart is your home.  *smile*

I just take a step, and a path is chosen, and I watch and wait for those I'm holdin' onto,  to be denied my inner emotions.  Such notions leave me twisted, for I don't want to hide from those folks, cause when I lost it I missed it.  But I find myself strugglin' from the temptations of life, and the pleasures of sin.  You can only see my skin not bleedin' 'cause the real battles within'.  Barnyard soulja,  I won't had back the sword, no man, I done, did told ya.  Satan's creepin', never sleepin' runnin' ragged rocks across my exterior notion.  But never inner,  never depth for to be kept, from the one eternal darkness dweller,  he had me once, but freed I be, from the celler.  No more hell for this child, no more wild for this one.  I find myself hushed, leanin' against things I know I shouldn't discuss but my inner turmoil shoutin' and screamin' I must.  I detest to be another one,  not whole, split in twain, in body and soul.  My souls unified but my body is disenclined to aquiest to my souls request.  It urns for the burn of the black fire,  lookin' at demons with placid admiration, and my inner child is just watchin' and hatin'.  Cause it's not the mountain tops where I've learned to walk, but where I've learned to coast.  It's crawlin', bloodied and bruised from valley's and crags,  where I learned the harshness of stereotypical tags,  and the hate brought, that's wrought from more hate.  I look into the depths of man,  I guess it's just fate.  I just pray for you son, that it's not too late.  'Cause my rebirth shook the bonds of heaven, bound in love, bound like seven.  Twelve men sought me,  but it only took the one that caught me.  Brass were his shoes with a candle in his hand,  and the breath of his nostrils will consume any man.  Is it so hard for you to believe, listen close, no lie in me, no deceit, I speak quickly for the time is so fleet.  Look in brother man, for which maker will you meet?  The one who made you, or made you into a cursed verse, only built to bring men to their worst?  I'm gonna die on this battlefield but not before I move this mountain, never quittin' but always faulted,  but sprang up inside from that eternal fountain.  Finality, Triangle, built from two pieces of wood.  Reach inside deep brother man,  cause you know which choice you should and could pick.  Don't be tempted by the demon of the one, so slick.  Be peaceful my son.

Those words of Rza I feel down deep,  cause it's these imaginin's that causin' me lack of sleep.  Seems my worlds torn between my inner and outer.  They fightin' hard to win, but which man's stouter.  I don't doubt my inner strength cause from whence it flows,  the stretgth is astoundin', so astoundin' that I rend my clothes,  I shave my head and I stomp my feet.  But my outer man's hunger is great, so great fiendin' for somethin' to eat.  I could shred my life to pieces and never find the splinter, that's wedged in deep, 'causin' subliminal winter.  My life's on the line, and my actions quake eternity.  These choices I choose, I feel, just burnin' me.  HELP ME MY LORD!  HELP YOUR CHILD IN TRIAL!  Cause if it wasn't for you my lord, my life would be in a vain kind of denial.  I KNOW THAT YOU GIVETH, AND YOU TAKETH AWAY!  SO LET PRAISED ME YOUR NAME THE ONLY THING THAT I SAY!  Please Jesus help me,  don't let me fall in despair.  For that's a demon that'll consume me, and it's already here.  It's eyein' me, sizin' me, waitin' to move.  But there's already so many demons,  I don't know if there's room.  This last one's a great one, and might send me right over the edge.  I remember that day lord, that we exchanged our sweet pledge.  I pledged to your faith, and you pledged to me grace.  So I ask now of you lord, give me grace in this place.  Help me, sustain me,  help me survive another day, without this demons consumin' me,  to them it's childsplay.  TO ME IT'S A BATTLE, STRENGTHEN MY SWORD AND MY SHIELD!  Let me walk this path lord,  and my honor n'er yield.  YOUR MY LIFE AND MY HONOR, AND MY GLORY DIVINE!  So give me strength to walk in darkness, and take for what's mine.  YOU'VE GIVEN ME ALL MY LORD!  And for that I'm so thankful.  But I know I'm doomed to this battle, the situation's so fateful.  Grace be delivered, and faith be my rod.  Just thank you my lord, for bein' my God.  Praise be your name, I'm nameless to blame.  Just take this man and this beast,  and help them to tame.  Amen my lord.  Amen.  Amen, in sweet Jesus's name.

These streets I walk down every day, one path one day and then turn another which way.  It's these streets man,  that's gots minds twisted, let us look down that barrel of death of the pistol and kiss it.  We looked for that easy path, that easy street but missed it. 'Cause everybody knows the streets in life's one way, ain't no turnin' back in it.  It's these streets man that deal you the dueces, when you need that ace, like an ice cold shiver ya skin covered with gooses.  'Cause it's cold in these streets man, and no way that a man can ever be right.  He can only pray to God at night, under the dim appearance of streetlight.  It's like the winter snow in summer, these streets don't make sense, hence the confusion and pain when we hop o'er that fence.  What you think we get rides in these streets?  Not us, hell naw, nope, next to never!  We walk the dirt paths, clear of pryin' eyes if we're clever.  Hoppin' fences, hill climbers, we be those roof top dwellers.  Sayers, and prophets, we be those preachers and tellers.  Those spoken loud and wide of the hard times type life, those with the eyes so deep, who've been through that strife.  It's the life of the streets man.  We live it, breathe it, love it, but can't give it.  Although some deny it, and get lost how they hid it.  But it always comes back out,  you shoulda got at peace with your soul, and the the street inside come out, so you coulda been whole.  But divided you were, and divide it you did.  So go down in your hole homie, the same one in you hid.  That's a difference in the streets, between a man and a kid.  While I climbed up the ladder, deep down on you slid.  It's these streets man,  some battle, and some bow down for death.  But I'mma battle on homie, till there ain't nothin' left, 'cause these my streets, my paths, and I'mma continue my journey.  I'mma ride the fire of life, 'till it finally burn me.  It's just the streets, man.

An epiphany if you will, of loneliness and selfish attitudes.  It's all me, it's all mine, and yet it's nothing for me at all.  It's just blankness,  a black scarred window, charred with the burn of the sun too bright to be beheld.  It's the dust of the moon, under a pale lit red sky, blowing in a non-existant wind.  It's the silence of the forest, which really isn't silence at all if you listen, but instead a roaring of a million things all at once.  It's the space between every drop of rain in a thunderstorm, so difficult to hide in between but yet still there.  How I scream in my very depths of the blackness, leaking out from my torn and tattered heart!  How I grip my skull in utter pain, trying to even rend my own flesh from my body.  Utter insanity grips me at every turn yet never drives me insane,  but instead just rips piece from pieces of my tattered back, bowing down on a knee.  A knee that's so tired of kneeling, broken and bruised from the floor.  A knee that just wants to stand,  and no longert feel the utter, disgusting grimace of servitude to such an evil thing as love.  LOVE I SAY, LOVE!  How sickly sweet is such a bitter thing as love, how it sickens my very soul........and how I cry in desparation over my own feelings of sickness.  Love is the sickness, and my loneliness the symptoms.  *sigh*  I fear it will all be over too soon, and yet never come by my way,  that's love I say.  It figures.
