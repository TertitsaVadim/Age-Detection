When a solvent containing product like Liquid Rubber comes in contact with sheet rubber, the applicator should be prepared for a phenomenon which will make it appear as if something has gone radically wrong. Some of the solvent in Liquid Rubber will be absorbed by the sheet rubber and cause it to swell. If the sheet is not glued tightly to the plywood the swelling causes wrinkles or bubbles to form. Depending on the temperature, this condition will persist for days or sometimes weeks. However, as the Liquid Roof begins its cure process and solvent slowly evaporates, the sheet will shrink and return to its original shape. Do not apply Liquid Rubber Coatings in a heavy film as this will aggravate the swelling reaction in the sheet.
