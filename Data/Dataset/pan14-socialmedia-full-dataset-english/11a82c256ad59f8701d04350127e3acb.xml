<br /><br />Where: Musikverein
<br /><br />Opening Hours: 11.15am
<br /><br />One of the world’s most famous concerts, the Vienna Philharmonic’s New Year’s Day Concert in the Musikverein’s fabulous Golden Hall greets the New Year with dance music of the Strauss dynasty.
<br /><br />The History of the Vienna Philharmonic´s New Year’s Concert
<br /><br />The Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra’s New Year’s Concert is by far the most popular of this orchestra’s functions, but also Austria’s most noteworthy cultural export. Throughout the world the Vienna Philharmonic’s New Year’s Concert is televised worldwide and is without doubt the most widely seen and heard of all regular musical presentations performed in the equally famous Musikvervein Concert Hall.
<br /><br />Herbert von Karajan conducted in 1987 (an experience which he reported was completely rejuvenative for his music-making), since when the baton has changed hands annually between a small number of top maestros: Abbado, Kleiber, Maazel, Mehta, Muti, Harnoncourt (the first Viennese conductor since 1980 to take the baton, in 2001 and again in 2003), Ozawa, Jansons and - in 2008 - the sprightly octogenarian, French conductor Georges Pretre making his New Year Concert debut.
<br /><br />Special Attractions
<br /><br />In 2009 another debutant, Daniel Barenboim, guides the Philharmonic through favourite Strauss dances, as well as their contemporaries, ending with the traditional encores - the Blue Danube waltz and Johann Strauss the Elder’s Radetzky march.

<br /><br />Where: Abu Simbel Temple
<br /><br />Opening Hours: Sunrise
<br /><br />During the Abu Simbel Festival crowds fill the temple at sunrise to watch the shafts of light slowly creeping through the stone, illuminating the statues of Ramses, Ra and Amun and providing a spectacular sight.
<br /><br />It was Ramses II who, in a fit of precision and architectural egotism, carefully angled his temple at Abu Simbel so that the inner sanctum would light up twice a year - once on the anniversary of his rise to the throne, and once on his birthday. Impressively, it is only the inner sanctum that lights up, while the statute of Ptah (the god of darkness) remains in the shadows.
<br /><br />When they have recovered their breath, visitors can join celebrations outside, including a fair and music demonstrations. However, nothing can really impress you immediately after witnessing such a sight.
<br /><br />When the Aswan Dam caused the Nasser Lake to rise and inundate the area in the early 1960s, the entire temple was moved to higher ground and for this reason the sun now strikes a day later than Ramses had originally planned.
<br /><br />We recommend you book your package at least 2 months before the date of Abu Simbel Festival.

<br /><br />Dominica boasts the most spectacular diving sites in the world. It is only fitting that the island has a festival centred around the Anchorage Hotel in Roseau, dedicated to the sport.
<br /><br />Now in its seventh year, Dive Fest is a week-long event geared primarily to introducing Dominicans to the world of diving. However, everyone from divers and kayakers to snorkellers and whale watchers can participate.
<br /><br />Dive Fest is organized by the Dominica Watersports Association (DWA) and all funds generated from the event are used to ensure that the island has world-class watersports facilities. All activities are sponsored by various companies, some of whom are part of the DWA.
<br /><br />Dominica is considered the “nature” island of the Caribbean because of its spectacular topography, flora and fauna. This extends to beneath the sea. Divers are greeted with a rich assortment of colorful sponges, an abundance of crinoids, camouflaged frogfish, arrow crabs, anemones with cleaner shrimp of every kind hiding inside them, walls covered in black coral and gorgonians with the occasional sea horse attached. There are caves full of lobster, dramatic arches of coral-covered granite, and schools of sennet, large Southern stingrays, big barracuda and schools of baitfish being pursued by various jacks.
<br /><br />Dive Fest begins with a dinner and booze cruise and provided you don’t have a hangover in the days to follow you can enjoy scuba diving, snorkelling, kayaking, swimming and an underwater treasure hunt. There will also be non-aquatic events such as a fashion show and a beach barbecue. For those who prefer nocturnal activities, there will be nightly events. The festival ends with awards and thanksgiving service and a huge beach party on Soufriere beach.

<br /><br />Where: Guaranda
<br /><br />The yearly Guaranda Carnival is known to be one of the best in Ecuador and is eagerly anticipated by the bolivarenses, the people from the Bolívar province.
<br /><br />Although the once traditional throwing of water and flour balloons over fellow revellers has now been deemed too dangerous and finally banned, the locals still manage to thoroughly entertain themselves with much singing and dancing in the streets.
<br /><br />The carnival features the important choosing of the Kuski Raymi Ñusta (meaning “pretty woman” and referring to the carnival queen), and the recurring presence of Taita Carnival and Mama Carnival as the two male and female carnival characters who preside over the parades and festivities.
<br /><br />In the run-up to carnival pigs, chickens and rabbits are fattened and killed in order for the best local dishes to be made for the celebrations, washed down with copious amounts of the local Guaranda spirit Pájaro Azul (Blue Bird).

<br /><br />Where: Roseau
<br /><br />The annual World Creole Music Festival in Rouseau brings together musicians, singers and bands from all over the Caribbean and features the unique rhythms of zouk, zydeco, cadence, compas and soukous.
<br /><br />Dominica lies between the French islands of Martinique and Guadeloupe. Interestingly, it is an English-speaking island that was once a colony of Britain. However, the country’s culture and language is strongly tinged by the French creole influences that emanate from its neighbours, which is reflected in the music. Though other island rhythms such as calypso and reggae are popular, zouk and zydeco - spicy, fast-paced, French Creole music - are preferred.
<br /><br />Zouk and zydeco, along with soukous, a modern Zairean dance music, salsa, cadence and compas from Haiti, are all featured during the event, with performers from Cuba, Africa, Haiti and Dominica, among others.
<br /><br />We recommend you book your package at least 2 months before the date of Music Festival.
