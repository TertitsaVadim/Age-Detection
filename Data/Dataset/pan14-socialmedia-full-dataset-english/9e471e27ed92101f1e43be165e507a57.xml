<br /><br />There may be days when you get up in the morning and things aren’t the way you had hoped they would be.
<br /><br />That’s when you have to tell yourself that things will get better. There are times when people disappoint you and let you down.
<br /><br />But those are the times when you must remind yourself to trust your own judgments and opinions, to keep your life focused on believing in yourself.
<br /><br />There will be challenges to face and changes to make in your life, and it is up to you to accept them.
<br /><br />Constantly keep yourself headed in the right direction for you. It may not be easy at times, but in those times of struggle you will find a stronger sense of who you are.
<br /><br />So when the days come that are filled with frustration and unexpected responsibilities, remember to believe in yourself and all you want your life to be.
<br /><br />Because the challenges and changes will only help you to find the goals that you know are meant to come true for you.
<br /><br />Keep Believing in Yourself!

<br /><br />THE SCIENTIFIC DEATH OF JESUS
<br />At the age of 33,
<br />Jesus was condemned to death . At the time Crucifixion was the&quot;worst&quot; death. Only the worst
<br />Criminals were condemned to be crucified. Yet it was Even more dreadful for Jesus, unlike Other criminals condemned to death by Crucifixion Jesus was to be nailed to the Cross by His hands and feet.Each nail Was 6 to 8 inches long. The nails Were driven into His wrist. Not Into His palms as is commonly
<br />Portrayed. 
<br />  There's a tendon in the wrist that Extends to the shoulder.The Roman guards knew That when the nails were being hammered into the Wrist that tendon would tear and Break, forcing Jesus to use His back Muscles to support himself so that He could Breath.Both of His feet Were nailed together. Thus He was forced to Support Himself on the single nail that Impaled His feet to the cross. Jesus could Not support himself with His legs because of the pain So He was forced to alternate between arching His
<br />Back then using his legs just to continue to Breath. Imagine the struggle, the pain, the Suffering, the courage. Jesus endured this Reality for over 3 hours. Yes, Over 3 hours! Can you imagine this kind of
<br />Suffering? A few minutes before He died, Jesus stopped bleeding. He was simply pouring water
<br />From his wounds.
<br />  From common images We see wounds to His hands and feet and even the spear wound To His side... But do we realize His wounds Were actually made in his body. A hammer Driving large nails through the wrist, the feet overlapped And an even large nail hammered through the arches, then a Roman guard piercing His side with a spear. But Before the nails and the spear Jesus was whipped and Beaten. The whipping was so severe that it tore the Flesh from His body. The beating so horrific that His Face was torn and his beard ripped from His face. The Crown of thorns cut deeply into His scalp. Most men
<br />Would not have survived this torture.&quot; He had no more blood To bleed out, only water poured from
<br />His Wounds. The human adult body contains about 3.5 liters (just less than a gallon) of blood.
<br />Jesus poured all 3.5 Liters of his blood; He had three nails hammered into His Members; a crown of thorns on His head and, beyond That, a Roman soldier who stabbed a spear into His Chest..
<br />    All these without Mentioning the humiliation He suffered after carrying His own Cross for almost 2 kilometers, while the crowd spat in his Face and threw stones (the cross was almost 30 kg of weight, Only for its higher part, where His hands were Nailed). Jesus had To endure this experience, to open the Gates of Heaven, So that you can have free Access to God. So that your sins Could be &quot;washed&quot; away. All of them,with no exception! Don't ignore this situation.
<br />JESUS CHRIST DIED FOR YOU!
<br />He died for you! It Is easy to pass jokes or foolish photos by e-mail, but When it comes to God, sometimes you feel ashamed to forward Toothers because you are worried of what they may think
<br />About you. God Has plans for you, show all your friends what He experienced To save you. Now think about this! May God bless your Life!
<br /><br />LIKE if you believe He died for you
<br />And write &quot;I LOVE U JESUS&quot; if you mean it!

<br /><br />Many people in today's church face the same problem. They have become so consumed by committees, rules, programs, and personal agendas that they have forgotten about love. So many Christians today have lost their vision and mission because they do not serve in love. 
<br /><br />What does agape love look like? Paul tells us: &quot;Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails&quot; (1 Corinthians 13:4-8). 
<br /><br />Paul's description paints a picture of the love of Jesus Christ. He is the one against whom we are to measure ourselves. We are to love others as Christ loves us. Jesus said, &quot;A new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another. By this all men will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another&quot; (John 13:34-35). 
<br /><br />Has your love been met by rejection? By betrayal? Has your love been met by cold indifference or by anger? Has your love been met with hatred? Has your love been met with selfishness, jealousy, and resentment? Keep loving, for only love endures forever. 
<br /><br />Prayer: God, help me to love others the way You do. Help me to never stop loving. In the name of Jesus. Amen.
<br /><br />&quot;Give thanks to the LORD, for he is good; his love endures forever&quot; (Psalm 118:1).

<br /><br />Solomon wrote: &quot;Two are better than one, because they have a good return for their work: If one falls down, his friend can help him up. But pity the man who falls and has no one to help him up! Also, if two lie down together, they will keep warm. But how can one keep warm alone? Though one may be overpowered, two can defend themselves. A cord of three strands is not quickly broken&quot; (Ecclesiastes 4:9-12). 
<br /><br />The Bible tells us that we are to encourage one another, motivate one another, pray for one another, uphold one another, support one another, protect one another, and carry one another's burdens. As we read in Scripture: &quot;As iron sharpens iron, so one man sharpens another&quot; (Proverbs 27:17). 
<br /><br />As Christians, we are called to love each other. In Proverbs 17:17, we read that &quot;a friend loves at all times.&quot; In the Gospel of John, Jesus says, &quot;My command is this: Love each other as I have loved you. Greater love has no one than this, that he lay down his life for his friends&quot; (John 15:12-13). 
<br /><br />Prayer: Father, I pray that You would put godly friends in my life. Guide me in my relationships and help me to be a good, godly friend to those around me. In the name of Jesus. Amen.
<br /><br />&quot;A man of many companions may come to ruin, but there is a friend who sticks closer than a brother&quot; (Proverbs 18:24).

But when we try to control our lives and manipulate events and people to our advantage, we will become frustrated and joyless. 
<br /><br />Paul trusted the sovereign hand of God and he learned to be content in the ups and in the downs, in the abundance and in the lack, in the sickness and in the health, in the courts of the kings and in the dungeons and the prisons. Paul recognized God as the source of his strength: &quot;I can do everything through him who gives me strength&quot; (Philippians 4:13). 
<br /><br />Whatever God called Paul to do--whether speaking with the powerful or the poor, whether preaching to thousands in a coliseum or to a lone Philippian jailer, whether speaking to King Agrippa or to a lowly soldier in Rome--Paul knew that God would equip him for his tasks. 
<br /><br />Paul's God-centered focus brought joy and contentment to his life. The psalmist declared, &quot;The Lord is my strength and my shield; my heart trusts in him, and I am helped. My heart leaps for joy and I will give thanks to him in song&quot; (Psalm 28:7). 
<br /><br />God will also provide for us and strengthen us as we seek to follow Him in faithful obedience. &quot;And my God will meet all your needs according to his glorious riches in Christ Jesus&quot; (Philippians 4:19). 
<br /><br />Whatever needs we have--salvation, comfort, encouragement--Jesus can meet them. He can lift us above the hurts that others have caused. He can give us perseverance when we are in the middle of the valley. He will meet our needs in His perfect timing and in accordance with His glorious, inexhaustible riches. 
<br /><br />Prayer: God, thank You for Your sovereignty. Help me to trust in You, knowing that You are more than able to see me through every trial I face. In the name of Jesus. Amen.
<br /><br />&quot;O Sovereign LORD, my strong deliverer, who shields my head in the day of battle&quot; (Psalm 140:7).

One of the reasons it is so sneaky is that there are times when it masquerades as a virtue. We call it discernment, cautious wisdom, and sometimes we even call it a realistic worldview. At its core, pessimism is unbelief. It is a lack of faith in God and His ability or desire to keep His promises. 
<br /><br />A great example of pessimism rightly labeled is found in Mark 9. A father brings his possessed son to Jesus and says, &quot;If you can do anything, have compassion on us and help us.&quot; Jesus responds by saying, &quot;If you can? Everything is possible for one who believes.&quot; In a moment of clarity, the father cries out, &quot;I do believe! Help me overcome my unbelief!&quot; (Mark 9:22-24). Face to face with Christ, the father had to admit that the issue was with his faith and not with Jesus' power. 
<br /><br />Deliverance from pessimism is possible. We see it in the apostle Thomas' life. Thomas had a history of unbelief, so much so that he is often referenced as Doubting Thomas. Jesus defeated pessimism in Thomas' life, giving us insight into how to defeat it in our own lives. 
<br /><br />The first step in defeating pessimism is understanding who you are in Christ. Thomas was specifically called by Jesus to be one of His disciples. Knowing that he was chosen by the Lord Jesus Christ and that he was loved unconditionally by Him was the first step in Thomas' transformation. 
<br /><br />It can be the beginning for us, as well. God called us to be His own because of His great love for us and His unique design for each of our lives. We are loved specially and unconditionally, and the God of the universe holds each one of us forever in His hand. There is nothing we can do to affect God's calling. He freely called us because we are special to Him. 
<br /><br />Prayer: I admit that at times I struggle with unbelief like the father with the possessed son, but today I want to say, &quot;Help me overcome my unbelief!&quot; God, thank You for Your love for me and for the calling You have placed on my life. In the name of Jesus. Amen.
<br /><br />&quot;How great is the love the Father has lavished on us, that we should be called children of God!&quot; (1 John 3:1)

		<document id="d3f2716b72896bdb0eb6bb6208b10a32" url=""><![CDATA[The Treasures of God's Word<br/><br/>Those who do not spend time diligently seeking wisdom from the Bible; those who read it without comprehending it; even those who memorize it without applying it to their lives are missing the treasure that comes from the Word of God. 
<br /><br />So what is this treasure? Proverbs 2 says that when you accept the Word of God and seek to understand and to obey it, &quot;… wisdom will enter your heart, and knowledge will be pleasant to your soul. Discretion will protect you, and understanding will guard you&quot; (Proverbs 2:10-11). 
<br /><br />Seek godly wisdom from the Word of the Lord. True wisdom and her benefits are priceless: &quot;Blessed is the man who finds wisdom, the man who gains understanding, for she is more profitable than silver and yields better returns than gold. She is more precious than rubies; nothing you desire can compare with her&quot; (Proverbs 3:13-15). 
<br /><br />So what is wisdom? It is not merely the accumulation of knowledge so that one is characterized as smart or savvy, but it is the source of moral and ethical principles, which are integral to the God-honoring lifestyle. 
<br /><br />Seek and choose this wisdom with all of its blessings, with all of its protection, and with all of its promises.
<br /><br />Prayer: God, thank You for the treasures available to us in Your Word. Help me to seek wisdom from Your Word every day. In the name of Jesus. Amen.
<br /><br />&quot;...that they may be encouraged in heart and united in love, so that they may have the full riches of complete understanding, in order that they may know the mystery of God, namely, Christ, in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge&quot; (Colossians 2:2-3).

He has protected us, promoted us and opened doors for us. That’s God’s favor. But I believe that in the coming days, God wants to show us unprecedented favor — that’s favor like we haven’t seen before.
<br /><br />In Eph.1:19 (Amp), Paul said that in the “ages to come” we would see “the immeasurable, unlimited, surpassing greatness of God’s favor.” What’s interesting is that Paul wrote this passage ages ago. I believe that we are now living in the “ages to come” that Paul was talking about. I believe you and I are going to see this unprecedented favor!
<br /><br />The word “unprecedented” means “unmatched, unparalleled, for the first time.” In other words, you may have seen God’s favor in the past, but you need to get ready. You haven’t seen anything yet. What God has in your future is going to be bigger, better, greater — unprecedented! He is going to show you His goodness in ways you’ve never seen before. Keep standing, keep praying, keep putting Him first and watch His unprecedented favor come on every area of your life!
<br /><br />Prayer: Father God, thank You for this day and age I’m living in. I believe that You created me for such a time as this. By faith, I receive Your unprecedented favor as I serve You with my whole heart in Jesus’ name. Amen.
<br /><br />“And [so that you can know and understand] what is the immeasurable and unlimited and surpassing greatness of His power in and for us who believe...”
<br />(Ephesians 1:19, AMP)

		<document id="194b782cdce944a15fe1dec9910e055a" url=""><![CDATA[Unprecedented favor is my wish to all my friends at PAN<br/><br/>Dear Friends,
<br /><br />It’s so vital to receive what God wants to freely give you!
<br /><br />It’s simple, but so many people believe exactly the opposite. Instead of receiving from the Lord, their mindset is, “God has better things to do than think about me,” or “I don’t deserve God’s blessing” or “Everything good always happens to somebody else but not me.”
<br /><br />I know it’s easy to feel that way, but don’t let your heart and your words go there; don’t agree with this way of thinking.
<br /><br />God is for you!
<br /><br />And He desires for you to have every blessing and every good thing that He promises to you in His Word.
<br /><br />The Bible calls this “favor.” At some point in our lives, even if we didn’t recognize it, we have all experienced God’s favor.
<br /><br />Favor is the undeserved, unearned, unexplainable goodness of God in your life.
<br /><br />Favor causes you to reap even where you’ve not sown.
<br /><br />Favor protects you; it promotes you. It opens new doors — that should’ve taken years to open — in a single moment.
<br /><br />Favor takes you places you could never go on your own.
<br /><br />I declare today over your life that in the coming days and weeks ahead, God will unleash His unprecedented favor on you. Favor like you’ve never seen before.
<br /><br />Unprecedented means “unmatched, unparalleled, for the first time.” You’ve seen God’s favor in your life in the past, but what He’s about to do is bigger and even greater.
<br /><br />You just have to be willing to receive it and get in agreement with God.
<br /><br />If you will believe God and stand on the promises of His Word, He promises you will see incredible and wonderful things happen.
<br /><br />His unmatched, unparalleled, for-the-first-time favor is for you.
<br /><br />I want you to know how much I love and appreciate you. You are one of the many ways that God has poured His goodness into my live.

But without Christ as their Savior, their efforts to feed their spiritual hunger are in vain.  
<br /><br />We all were born in a spiritual vacuum, craving wholeness and peace. We may try to satisfy our hearts and souls with temporary fixes, but only God can permanently and completely fill that longing inside of us. God is the only source of true spiritual fulfillment. Anything else is temporary and false. It is a shadow of the real spirituality of God. 
<br /><br />Shadow spirituality is any form of spirituality that does not acknowledge Jesus Christ as the only Lord of life. Shadow spirituality refuses to acknowledge the sovereign power and authority of God. Shadow spirituality dismisses the Bible as the Word of God. 
<br /><br />Even churches are not immune from shadow spirituality. Many churches are wrongly preaching that Christ is merely one of many ways to God. They preach in direct opposition to God's Word and plan of salvation. Jesus warned, &quot;Watch out for false prophets. They come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ferocious wolves&quot; (Matthew 7:15). 
<br /><br />Shadow spirituality is deceptive and based on personal happiness. True spirituality leads to wholeness as we reflect the likeness of Jesus Christ. Shadow spirituality offers temporary fixes. True spirituality provides permanent transformation. 
<br /><br />Shadow spirituality promotes the falsehood that we can achieve our own wholeness, while true spirituality acknowledges that only the Holy Spirit can declare us whole.
<br /><br />Prayer: God, thank You for being my fulfillment and for the permanent transformation You made in my life. Thank You for making me whole. In the name of Jesus. Amen.
<br /><br />&quot;Now this is eternal life: that they may know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent&quot; (John 17:3).

Sin can't hold you back any longer because when the Son sets you free, you are free indeed! (See John 8:36.) It all starts by believing and receiving this promise and then building faith by hearing the Word of God. 
<br />Today, if you don't know Jesus as your personal Lord and Savior, there's no better time to get on the road to victory! Receive Him, receive the truth, and let it transform every area of your life!
<br /><br />&quot;But thank God! He gives us victory over sin and death through our Lord Jesus Christ&quot;
<br />(Romans 8:11, AMP)
<br /><br />Heavenly Father, thank You for giving me victory! Thank You for Your Word which is life and healing water to my soul. I choose to set my heart and thoughts on You, knowing that You are empowering me to overcome in every area of my life in Jesus' name. Amen!

<br /><br />As is common when something of value is lost, she spares no effort to find her lost coin. You can feel her heart racing in panic as she lights a lamp and sweeps the dirt floor carefully and methodically until she finds what was lost. When she finds it, she is ecstatic and she includes her friends and neighbors in her joy.  
<br /><br />An interesting element of the parable is that the woman lost the coin in her own home. She was not traveling or in unfamiliar territory. She lost her treasure in her day to day routine.  
<br /><br />The same is true of many Christians. They haven't wandered away from the Father or set off for a distant country to revel in sin. Rather, they have lost the treasure of their love for the Lord in their day to day routine. At first, the lost treasure may be overlooked. However, the loss will eventually be apparent. Have you lost the treasure of your love for the Lord? 
<br /><br />Prayer: Lord, I’m afraid that in the midst of my daily routine, I have lost the treasure of my love for You. Father, forgive me and help me to find it again. In the name of Jesus. Amen.
<br /><br />&quot;I seek you with all my heart; do not let me stray from your commands&quot; (Psalm 119:10).

<br /><br />Rule 2: The world doesn't care about your self-esteem. The world will expect you to accomplish something BEFORE you feel good about yourself. 
<br /><br />Rule 3: You will NOT make $60,000 a year right out of high school. You won't be a vice-president with a car phone until you earn both. 
<br /><br />Rule 4: If you think your teacher is tough, wait till you get a boss. 
<br /><br />Rule 5: Flipping burgers is not beneath your dignity. Your Grandparents had a different word for burger flipping: they called it opportunity. 
<br /><br />Rule 6: If you mess up, it's not your parents' fault, so don't whine about your mistakes, learn from them. 
<br /><br />Rule 7: Before you were born, your parents weren't as boring as they are now. They got that way from paying your bills, cleaning your clothes and listening to you talk about how cool you thought you were. So before you save the rain forest from the parasites of your parent's generation, try delousing the closet in your own room. 
<br /><br />Rule 8: Your school may have done away with winners and losers, but life HAS NOT. In some schools, they have abolished failing grades and they'll give you as MANY TIMES as you want to get the right answer. This doesn't bear the slightest resemblance to ANYTHING in real life. 
<br /><br />Rule 9: Life is not divided into semesters. You don't get summers off and very few employers are interested in helping you FIND YOURSELF. Do that on your own time. 
<br /><br />Rule 10: Television is NOT real life. In real life people actually have to leave the coffee shop and go to jobs. 
<br /><br />Rule 11: Be nice to nerds. Chances are you'll end up working for one

Every human being—Christian and non-Christian alike—is created in God’s own image, and by virtue of being created in God’s own image, we are born with natural talents. But the gifts of the Holy Spirit are different from the natural talents we are born with.
<br /><br />Talents inspire and entertain, but spiritual gifts build up the body of Christ. Something supernatural happens when a gift is exercised that does not happen when a talent is used. Make no mistake though; the Lord can use a talent, as well as a spiritual gift, to glorify His name.
<br /><br />When the fruit of the Spirit is absent, gifts lose their effectiveness. In Galatians 5:22-23, Paul says, “But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control.” The fruit of the Spirit should be evident in all who abide in Christ, but not all the gifts are given to all believers. The fruit of the Spirit defines who a believer is, but the gifts of the Spirit define what a believer does.
<br /><br />Prayer: God, I pray that the fruit of the Spirit would be evident in my life. I pray in the name of Jesus. Amen.
<br /><br />“Every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit” (Matthew 7:17).
