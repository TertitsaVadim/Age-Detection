Most of Scotland is mountainous.  The country’s rugged mountains, green valleys and deep blue lakes provide some  of the most beautiful scenery in Europe. Industrialization has eliminated some  of Scotland’s old traditions and the way of life. But the Scots have kept many  symbols of their long and colourful history---especially of their fierce  struggles for independence. Parades at Edinburgh Castle, once a home of  Scotland’s kings, feature troops who wear kilts and march to the music of the  bagpipes. Scottish soldiers still guard their country’s ancient royal crown in  the castle, and the royal flag of Scotland still flies over the castle walls.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p align=&quot;justify]  Most Scottish cooking is simple. The  people’s favourite dishes include herring, mutton stew, roast beef and roast  lamb. They also enjoy high-quality steaks from their country’s famous  Aberdeen-Angus cattle. Other popular foods include haggis, kippers, oatmeal,  and, salmon. Haggis is a famous national dish made from the heart, liver, and  lungs of a sheep or calf.&amp;nbsp; These  ingredients are chopped with suet (animal fat), onions, oatmeal and seasonings  and then boiled in bag made from a sheep’s stomach. Kippers are smoked herring  and are a favourite breakfast dish. Oatmeal is used in many Scottish dishes,  including porridge and oatcakes (crackers), both of which are popular for  breakfast. Salmon is served smoked, grilled, or poached. Salmon taken from Scottish  waters is considered one of the world’s tastiest foods. The favourite alcoholic  drink of Scotland is Scotch whisky, or Scotch. The Scots have been making  whisky since the 1400’s. &lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p align=&quot;justify]  Scotland’s huge open lands make excellent  recreational areas. The Scots invented Golf in the 1100’s, and it is still one  of their favourite games.&lt;/p&gt;
