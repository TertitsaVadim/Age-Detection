You will know a guide is one that works when it contributes to your knowledge and skillset without putting want you to sleep. <br />.<br />How do classmates inside same batch of medicine studying MBBS along with you top in the healthcare PG entrance exam because you struggle to perform well inside them? What exactly is the success formula for any top rank in your favorite medical PG entrance assessment? If only you knew to consider behind their successes? In the large country like Indian, a great deal is assessed on how you perform in your studies with the majority of the society in awe to your educational background. More so if you are a doctor! I was always curious to know what went behind the psychology of an topper! When I began a career as a career counselor, I was bombarded by students who were eager to learn the ropes on how to excel in competitive exams and obtain top ranks in exclusive medical PG entrance exams. I began to write simply consequently. SO, here is my take- <br /><br />Discover what the topper is doing <br /><br />Successful people involve some things in common. They follow a habit and the wise would be your one who can adopt a few and assimilate in his/her nature!

Noteworthy agents among the synthetic derivatives are homatropine and tropicamide, which have a shorter duration of action than atropine, and methylatropine, ipratropium, and tiotropium, which are quaternized and do not cross the blood-brain barrier or readily cross membranes. The latter two agents are given by inhalation in the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and are pending approval for use in bronchial asthma. Ipratropium also has an FDA-approved indication for perennial- and common cold-associated rhinorrhea. The synthetic derivatives possessing partial receptor selectivity include pirenzepine, used in the treatment of acid-peptic disease in some countries, and tolterodine, oxybutynin, and several others, used in the treatment of urinary incontinence. <br /><br />Muscarinic receptor antagonists prevent the effects of ACh by blocking its binding to muscarinic cholinergic receptors at neuroeffector sites on smooth muscle, cardiac muscle, and gland cells; in peripheral ganglia; and in the CNS. In general, muscarinic receptor antagonists cause little blockade at nicotinic receptor sites. However, the quaternary ammonium antagonists generally exhibit a greater degree of nicotinic blocking activity, and consequently are more likely to interfere with ganglionic or neuromuscular transmission. <br /><br />Cholinergic transmission appears to be both muscarinic and nicotinic at spinal, subcortical, and cortical levels in the brain (see Chapter 12). At high or toxic doses, central effects of atropine and related drugs are observed, generally consisting of CNS stimulation followed by depression. Since quaternary compounds penetrate the blood-brain barrier poorly, they have little or no effect on the CNS. <br /><br />Parasympathetic neuroeffector junctions in different organs vary in their sensitivity to muscarinic receptor antagonists (Table 7-2). Small doses of atropine depress salivary and bronchial secretion and sweating. With larger doses, the pupil dilates, accommodation of the lens to near vision is inhibited, and vagal effects on the heart are blocked so that the heart rate is increased. Larger doses antagonize parasympathetic control of the urinary bladder and gastrointestinal <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5tZWRpc2wuY29tLw__" target="_blank">medical entrance</a> tract, thereby inhibiting micturition and decreasing the tone and motility of the gut. Still larger doses are required to inhibit gastric motility and particularly secretion. Thus, doses of atropine and most related muscarinic receptor antagonists that depress gastric secretion also almost invariably affect salivary secretion, ocular accommodation, micturition, and gastrointestinal tone. This hierarchy of relative sensitivities is not a consequence of differences in the affinity of atropine for the muscarinic receptors at these sites because atropine lacks selectivity toward different muscarinic receptor subtypes. More likely determinants include the degree to which the functions of various end organs are regulated by parasympathetic tone and the involvement of intramural neurons and reflexes. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2VuLndpa2lwZWRpYS5vcmcvd2lraS9NZWRpY2luZQ__" target="_blank">Medicine</a> <br /><br />The actions of most clinically available muscarinic receptor antagonists differ only quantitatively from those of atropine, considered below as the prototype of the group.

Within the central nervous system (CNS), the hippocampus, cortex, and thalamus have high densities of muscarinic receptors. <br /><br />Acetylcholine (ACh), the naturally occurring neurotransmitter for these receptors, has virtually no systemic therapeutic applications because its actions are diffuse, and its hydrolysis, catalyzed by both <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5tZWRpY2FsdmlkZW9zLm1lLw__" target="_blank">videos medical</a> acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and plasma butyrylcholinesterase, is rapid. Muscarinic agonists mimic the effects of ACh at these sites. These agonists typically are longer-acting congeners of ACh or natural alkaloids that display little selectivity for the various subtypes of muscarinic receptors. Several of these agents stimulate nicotinic as well as muscarinic receptors. <br /><br />The mechanisms of action of endogenous ACh at the postjunctional membranes of the effector cells and neurons that correspond to the four classes of cholinergic synapses are discussed in Chapter 6. To recapitulate, these synapses are found at (1) autonomic effector sites, innervated by postganglionic parasympathetic fibers (and a small number of <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5tZWRpY2Fsb3NjZXMuY29tLw__" target="_blank">medical osces</a> cholinergic sympathetic fibers); (2) sympathetic and parasympathetic ganglion cells and the adrenal medulla, innervated by preganglionic autonomic fibers; (3) motor endplates on skeletal muscle, innervated by somatic motor nerves; and (4) certain synapses peripherally and within the CNS (Krnjevic, 2004), where the actions can be either pre- or postsynaptic. When ACh is administered systemically, it potentially can act at all of these sites; however, as a quaternary ammonium compound, its CNS penetration is limited, and butyrylcholinesterase in the plasma reduces the concentrations of ACh that reach peripheral areas with low blood flow. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2VuLndpa2lwZWRpYS5vcmcvd2lraS9NZWRpY2luZQ__" target="_blank">Medicine</a> <br /><br />The actions of ACh and related drugs at autonomic effector sites are referred to as muscarinic, based on the original observation that muscarine acts selectively at those sites and produces the same qualitative effects as ACh. Accordingly, the muscarinic, or parasympathomimetic, actions of the drugs considered in this chapter are <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy52aWRlb29kZC5jb20v" target="_blank">video odd</a> practically equivalent to the effects of postganglionic parasympathetic nerve impulses listed in Table 6-1; the differences between the actions of the classical muscarinic agonists are largely quantitative, as they show limited selectivity for one organ system or another. Muscarinic receptors also are present on autonomic ganglion cells and in the adrenal medulla. Muscarinic stimulation of ganglia and the adrenal medulla usually is thought to modulate nicotinic stimulation. All of the actions of ACh and its congeners at muscarinic receptors can be blocked by atropine. The nicotinic actions of cholinergic agonists refer to their initial stimulation, and often in high doses to subsequent blockade, of autonomic ganglion cells, the adrenal medulla, and the neuromuscular junction, actions comparable to those of nicotine. <br /><br />Properties and Subtypes of Muscarinic Receptors <br /><br />Muscarinic receptors were characterized initially by analysis of the responses of cells and tissues in the periphery and the CNS. Differential effects of two muscarinic agonists, bethanechol and McN-A-343, on the tone of the lower esophageal sphincter led to the initial designation by Goyal and Rattan (1978) of muscarinic receptors as M1 <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5mYWNlYm9vay5jb20vTWVkaWNhbE1DUQ__" target="_blank">medical pg entrance</a> (ganglionic) and M2 (effector cell) (see Chapter 6). The basis for the selectivity of these agonists is unclear, as there is limited evidence that agonists discriminate appreciably among the subtypes of muscarinic receptors (Eglen et al., 1996; Caulfield and Birdsall, 1998).
