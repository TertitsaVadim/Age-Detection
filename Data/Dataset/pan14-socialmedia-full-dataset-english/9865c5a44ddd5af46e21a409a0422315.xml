<br /><br />Fallen in the unknown
<br />I look around
<br />nothing but darkness surrounding me
<br /><br />It’s cold and damp
<br />I’m scared
<br />I begin to cry
<br /><br />Then I see something 
<br />A light
<br />It beings to move closer
<br /><br />I try to get up
<br />I can’t
<br />I’m chained to the cold damp ground that lies beneath me
<br /><br />I scream out of fear and desperation
<br />I cry harder
<br />I can’t breath
<br /><br />the light stops 
<br />and disappears
<br />returning me to the darkness
<br /><br />I start to shake 
<br />I can see anything 
<br />I’m terrified
<br /><br />I think of you
<br />and how I’ll never see you again
<br />and the last thing i sed to you
<br /><br />I will never love you
<br /><br />I scream and cry 
<br />I feel around on the cold ground for something
<br />anything
<br /><br />I find something
<br />sharp
<br />I cut at the chains
<br />nothing
<br /><br />I think of the other options
<br />death
<br />amputation
<br /><br />I choose death
<br /><br />I cut my writs
<br />and wait
<br /><br />I slowly fall
<br />I can’t feel anything now
<br />I’m peaceful
<br /><br />and I wake up from a beautiful nightmare.
<br /><br />i was bored so i wrote this randomly.

<br />Slut, stupid, loser, freak.
<br />Society dictates who we are.
<br />They cause out heartache,
<br />We're left with scars.
<br />I hate all the labels,
<br />I hate all the names.
<br />All they do is cause suffering
<br />And pain.
<br /><br />The goth wears black,
<br />Has piercings and tattoos.
<br />But when she goes home,
<br />She get abused.
<br />She wears all black,
<br />To match her bruise.
<br /><br />The prep, she's a cheerleader,
<br />Homecoming queen.
<br />She's got a reputation
<br />For being mean.
<br />She goes for a ride in her
<br />Boyfriends car.
<br />Who is he? The football star.
<br />When they go out,
<br />She is abused.
<br />She wears all the makeup,
<br />to hide her bruise.
<br /><br />The geeks, they wear glasses.
<br />They feel all alone,
<br />They try to hide in their own little zone.
<br />When they go to school,
<br />They get abused.
<br />Yeah life sucks.
<br />But what else is new?
<br /><br />We aren't so different, you and me.
<br />You may be a slut,
<br />You may be a freak,
<br />You may be a prep,
<br />You may be a greek,
<br />You may be a goth,
<br />You may be a priss.
<br />None of that matters.
<br />Whats matters is,
<br />We all need help.
<br />We're all the same.
<br />We all get abused.
<br />We all get called names.

<br />I've seen all there is to be seen
<br />you've shown me your mind
<br />It means nothing
<br /><br />Wont you fix my heart?
<br />I've walked the finest of lines and never did i slip
<br />You could have left me to stare at nothing
<br />It wouldn't have mattered
<br />From nothing is what i've become
<br /><br />Wont you pick up my peices?
<br />I've dreamt of better days
<br />But dreams are what they will remain
<br />Your heart in my hand beats lifelessly
<br />A shame...
<br /><br />Will you leave me here with no one?
<br />I'll miss you...
<br />When will i be, never to hurt again.. numb
<br />This will be over soon
<br />But tomorrow it begins again
<br />You knew the lie, and lived it anyways
<br />I still need you
<br />The real you, not the shallow mask you hide behind
<br />Come back to me
