<br /><br />Nash said Bryant thinks he can be ''somebody to handle the ball and lead. He also felt that we were complementary leaders. I'm more on the positive side, he's more ... I think as he said it, cracks the whip. I think pick-and-roll, adding that to the offense and being able to space the floor for the big guys inside, I think it's a good fit. He was excited, and I think that was important for me. It's going to be fun to work it all out and try to create some cohesion and chemistry on the floor and make all these pieces work.''The rest of those pieces are similarly overjoyed at the prospect of playing with Nash,<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jbm1hbGw2Ni5jb20v" target="_blank">Nike Kobe Shoes</a> even if the club can't officially acknowledge the deal until the free agency moratorium ends next week. About seven months after the Lakers' efforts to get Chris Paul were squashed by the NBA, they turned a trade exception acquired during that fiasco into Nash.Pau Gasol, the Spanish 7-footer whose role diminished under new coach Mike Brown last season, reacted to the trade in a video chat on Twitter on Thursday.''It will be a huge honor to play alongside Steve,'' said Gasol, who is in Madrid preparing for the Olympics. ''Obviously I've known him for many years now, and he's been one of the elite point guards in the league for as long as I've played in the NBA. It would be a true pleasure to play with Steve. I know he still has a lot of juice in him, so I look forward to that. He makes everyone around him better. It's an exciting moment for the Lakers and Lakers fans.''
<br /><br />Although the four-time All-Star realizes Los Angeles might not be done making moves, Gasol seems likely to thrive alongside Nash. Gasol attempted to take more playmaking responsibility during the Lakers' season, which ended with a second-round loss to Oklahoma City.Metta World Peace didn't weigh in with much of an opinion on the deal on Twitter, but noted he had just been working out in Vancouver at a Steve Nash Sports Club,<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jbm1hbGw2Ni5jb20vcHJvZHVjdHMvTmlrZS1ab29tLUh5cGVyZnVzZS0tLW45NTdfcDEuaHRtbA__" target="_blank">Nike Zoom Hyperfuse</a> the point guard's chain of training complexes in British Columbia.Like any basketball fan, Nash is aware of the Lakers' much-rumored interest in Orlando center Dwight Howard, but he's not looking to start a superteam with any stars who aren't already in uniform in Los Angeles.''I can understand why the Lakers may be recruiting (Howard), but all I know is to get an opportunity to play with Pau Gasol and Andrew Bynum, it would be a pleasure,'' Nash told the radio station. ''Frankly, that's a lot for me to think of right there.''And one of the Lakers' biggest rivalries is even more interesting, too. Nash is among the biggest reasons that the Suns have a special place of enmity in the heart of Bryant, who has often said he can't stand the Phoenix franchise.Phoenix knocked Los Angeles out of the first round of the postseason in 2006 and again in 2007, two series that are still Bryant's only first-round playoff defeats. Kobe's Lakers got revenge two years ago, finishing off the Suns on the way to their latest title.

<br />Moore had a lot to do with that. The Lynx finished the first half on a 25-7 spurt, with 17 points by Moore. She broke the Lynx mark for scoring in one period set previously by Candice Wiggins (2012) and Augustus (2006) with 17 points. Moore also set career highs in free throws made and attempted.''She was just tremendous in that stretch where she scored 10 straight,'' coach Cheryl Reeve said.Moore, Augustus and Lindsay Whalen, the three Olympians, combined for 53 points, 19 rebounds and 11 assists. Playing the power forward spot, her natural position, while Rebekkah Brunson is out with a strained left calf muscle,<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jbm1hbGw2Ni5jb20v" target="_blank">Adidas Running Shoes</a> Moore again showed off those skills that made her the first overall pick in last year's draft.In helping the WNBA-leading Lynx (15-4) stop a three-game losing streak with two wins this week against the Shock (3-15), Moore totaled 52 points over her first consecutive 20-point performances as a pro.Playing for the second time in three days, the Lynx and Shock traded their share of angry words and mild shoves. There were four technical fouls issued, two on Shock guard Temeka Johnson, who was ejected after the second one midway through the third quarter.Johnson had her jump shot blocked by Wiggins with the score tied at 31 and 6:54 remaining in the first half, prompting a tussle for the ball and a double technical, one on each player.
<br /><br />The Lynx argued that Wiggins wasn't at fault to no avail, but they channeled their energy into breaking open the game with their Moore-fueled run to take a 49-33 lead at the intermission.Wiggins swished a 3-pointer with 6:01 left to stretch the lead to 63-43, the Lynx's largest of the afternoon.''We're feeling a little bit more confident about ourselves, especially our defense,'' Augustus said.The Lynx announced their attendance at 15,318, the second-largest crowd in their 14-year history. Their annual midweek matinee was filled with screaming kids from area recreation programs and day camps,<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jbm1hbGw2Ni5jb20vcHJvZHVjdHMvQWRpZGFzLUNDLVJpZGUtbjExNTJfcDEuaHRtbA__" target="_blank">Adidas CC Ride</a> coloring the arena with their group T-shirts. The atmosphere in London later this month will be just as raucous, though the voices at the Summer Games will be a lot deeper.Reeve told her Olympians to enjoy the experience, bring back a gold medal - and avoid getting hurt.''We really wanted to send them off with smiles on their faces, not scowls,'' Reeve said.All-Star forward Blake Griffin left Team USA training camp Wednesday, the day his new five-year contract with the Clippers became official, to return to Los Angeles for an MRI on his left knee.Griffin was injured in a team drill, and a source told Sports Illustrated the initial prognosis was &quot;not good.&quot;

<br />The United States basketball team warmed up for their Olympic title defence by winning hearts and minds, as well as a warm-up game against the Great Britain team, at Manchester's MEN Arena on Thursday.The US ran out comfortable 118-78 victors against the Olympic hosts, 10 days short of their opening pool game in the tournament against France.But they also proved extremely popular victors among a sell-out 17,000 crowd in Manchester, the local fans cheering more loudly for the visitors,<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jbm1hbGw2Ni5jb20v" target="_blank">Air Jordan</a> in particular the LA Lakers guard Kobe Bryant, than home players such as the Chicago Bulls All Star forward Luol Deng and emerging big man Joel Freeland.Premier League footballers Joleon Lescott, Chris Smalling, Tom Cleverley, Fabrice Muamba and Jordan Henderson - along with rugby's Danny Cipriani and boxer Amir Khan - were among the NBA fans who watched the first appearance of the full US international team in this country since the 1948 Olympics.Deron Williams and Carmelo Anthony joint top scored for the Americans with 19 points while Deng showed his international class with a game-high 25 points and Pops Mensah-Bonsu added 12 and nine rebounds.The USA, who will open the Olympics as one of the most prohibitive favourites in any event, have now won 52 of the 53 games they have played since they were surprisingly beaten three times at the 2004 Athens Olympics.
<br /><br />Freeland, the Great Britain forward who will be joining the USA players in the NBA next season as a new member of the Portland Trailblazers, scored the first basket of the night to give the hosts a 2-0 lead.And, with the Americans apparently keen to entertain the Manchester audience with a wide range of tricks, the British were able to keep the score close throughout the opening minutes at least.Kevin Durant, the Oklahoma City Thunder forward, was guilty of missing an acrobatic dunk attempt and an easier lay-up as the home crowd responded with excitement to every American offence.Back-to-back dunks by GB's former NBA player Mensah-Bonsu kept the hosts to within three,<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jbm1hbGw2Ni5jb20vcHJvZHVjdHMvSm9yZGFuLTctbjM2X3AxLmh0bWw_" target="_blank">Air Jordan 7</a> as did a three-point shot from Deng.But two spectacular breakaway dunks by the 6'3&quot; Russell Westbrook and consecutive three-point baskets from Carmelo Anthony stretched the Olympic champions' lead to 33-20 as they ended the first quarter with a 10-0 run.The visitors did not relent at the start of the second period, placing full-court pressure on the British guards and exposing their weakness at that position.After falling behind by as many as 17 early in the second, four consecutive free-throws from Deng cut the deficit to single figures but, as had been the case earlier, the US ended the period in emphatic fashion, two dunks from Durant, and a third from LeBron James, helped extend the advantage to 55-37 at the half. 
<br /><br />While wearing the Air Jordan 7's, Michael Jordan won his third MVP award. second NBA championship and the NBA scoring title. On top of that Jordan took home his second Olympic Gold Medal when the Dream Team crushed the international competition including a 116 48 rout over Angola. We see the model in a simpler colorway of White/Cardinal Red-Black-Bronze. White leather covers the majority of the upper , leaving only hits of cardinal red and bronze. Maybe Air Air Jordan 7 Retro Raptor Black Red Dark Charcoal Club Purple for him is the only think that Jordan Brand lovers have to look forward to this year. This particular model is a what could have been scenario from the Count Down Pack and Air Jordan 7 features white pearlized leather toggled against white grain leather for a very subtle effect.Meanwhile,Nike Air Jordan 7 VII Men Shoes were released in the summer of 1992,<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jbm1hbGw2Ni5jb20vdmlld3MvQWlyLWpvcmRhbi03LWJsYWNrLXJlZC1wdXJwbGUtNjU3NDUuaHRtbA__" target="_blank">Air Jordan 7 Black Red Purple</a> and were dubbed the &quot;Olympics&quot; as Jordan wore them while playing for team USA during the Olympic games. The Nike Air Jordan 7 Retro VII Sneakers Shoes Black Red Purple For Men features a white upper with metallic silver highlights, as well as red, blue, and gold accents. And the Nike Air Jordan 7 VII Men Shoes For Sale feature small perforations throughout the upper which act as a breathing mechanism for the foot.For more details,pls visit <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnmall66.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.cnmall66.com</a>.

<br /><br />As appealing trade scenarios for his franchise player shrink, Orlando Magic general manager Rob Hennigan's mission of beginning to build trust with All-Star center Dwight Howard was met with an unmistakable response in a Wednesday meeting: Howard continues to rule out a future with the Magic, and wants a trade to the Los Angeles Lakers before the start of the season, sources told Yahoo! Sports.&quot;Dwight remained unchanged in his want to be traded,&quot; a source with knowledge of the meeting said. &quot;And he has no intention of signing another contract extension with Orlando.&quot;Without a deal that would deliver him to the Lakers in the near future,<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jbm1hbGw2Ni5jb20v" target="_blank">Air Jordan</a> sources said Howard wants Henningan to revisit trade talks with the Brooklyn Nets in January, when center Brook Lopez is eligible to be traded. If deals don't surface with the Lakers or Nets, Howard plans to sign with the Dallas Mavericks as a free agent in the summer of 2013. While the Lakers and Nets won't have the salary cap space to sign Howard, nor the opportunity to execute a sign-and-trade deal under new CBA rules, the Mavericks will be flush with cap space next summer. Mavs owner Mark Cuban plans to make a run at Howard, and potentially another star player, to join Dirk Nowitzki. 
<br /><br />For Howard, that threat continues to make it difficult for Orlando to attract trade suitors willing to unload valuable assets for a superstar likely to be a rental player for only several months. Despite the Houston Rockets' determination to trade for Howard and convince him to stay long term, Howard's camp has repeatedly warned Houston owner Les Alexander and GM Daryl Morey that they will lose Howard to rival Dallas in free agency next July,<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jbm1hbGw2Ni5jb20vcHJvZHVjdHMvQWlyLUpvcmRhbi0yMDExLW45NTJfcDEuaHRtbA__" target="_blank">Air Jordan 2011</a> sources said.Hennigan and Orlando assistant Scott Perry flew to Los Angeles on Wednesday and met with Howard and his representatives for about two hours. When told that the Magic had tried to honor his desire to be moved, Howard probed Hennigan on why the GM hadn't accepted deals that could've sent him to the Nets or Lakers before those teams used valuable trade assets to acquire Joe Johnson and Steve Nash respectively.Hennigan has insisted that no proposed deal has been satisfactory and the franchise has shown some willingness to take its time to see what offers develop. Nevertheless the rental market for Howard is lean and the Lakers used two first-round picks in the sign-and-trade deal for Nash. The Cleveland Cavaliers and Houston are willing to be third-team trade partners for the Magic and Lakers in deals that would send them All-Star center Andrew Bynum. 
<br /><br />The Air Jordan 2011 was endorsed by Dwyane Wade in 2011, Jordan Brand decided to keep the fans happy with the release of the Air Jordan 2011. The shoe has inter-changeable insoles- The Red, &quot;Explosive&quot; one is claimed to symbolize power, and a Blue, &quot;Quick&quot; one, supposedly for quickness. Four colorways of the shoe were released on February 19, 2011 in correspondence with the 2011 All Star Game. The first colorway was White/Black. There were also White/Red and White/Blue colorways that coincided with the East/West Jersey Colors. The &quot;Year of the Rabbit&quot; colorway was a limited release that celebrated of Michael Jordan's Chinese Zodiac sign,<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jbm1hbGw2Ni5jb20vdmlld3MvQWlyLUpvcmRhbi0yMDExLTAwMy0zODEwMi5odG1s" target="_blank">Air Jordan 2011 White Black</a> coinciding with the current zodiac sign, the Year of the Rabbit.The 2011 has a unique design along both sides of the shoe. It is a star-constellation pattern that also serves as breathing holes for the shoe to keep it well ventilated. It uses Patina Leather wrapped around the shoe. The shoes are hand burnished and crafted. A dress shoe feel similar to the XI was reported to be the goal.This pair takes on a similar “Concord” XI colorup using a White leather and mesh upper with Black textured leather on the mudguard and toe. These also sport a Jumpman logo on the heel and the tongues have one Jumpman logo and the other shoes has 23 in the form of dots while finished off with a translucent outsole.

<br /><br />Reigning Olympic champions Todd Rogers and Philip Dalhausser made a solid start in their attempt for back-to-back gold medals as they disposed of Japan in straight sets in Pool B.The men's tournament favourites put on a workmanlike performance, underpinned by a typically dominant display on the defence by Dalhausser, as they posted a 21-15 21-16 win under the floodlights.Meanwhile, counterparts Jennifer Kessey and April Ross made it two wins out of two for the US women's teams as they cantered to victory against Argentina's Ana Gallay and Maria Virginia Zonta in Pool D.Italy's Paolo Nicolai and Daniele Lupo defied their tender years to claim an impressive victory over Switzerland's Patrick Heuscher and Jefferson Bellaguarda in the final match, while there were also victories in the men’s for Latvia,<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jbm1hbGw2Ni5jb20v" target="_blank">Air Max</a> Netherlands, Brazil and Spain.Brazil’s women began their Pool E campaign with a routine win against Netherlands. The South Americans were rarely troubled in the contest against Madelein Meppelink and Sophie van Gestel and eased to a 21-10 21-19 victory in just 36 minutes.Maria Antonelli made the difference on the attack for the Brazilians with a total of 14 winning hits, while Talia proved a formidable barrier at the net, blocking five shots.In other women’s games, Italy beat Russia while there were also victories for Spain, Germany and Host Nation Great Britain.
<br /><br />Brazil held off Australia to open their Group B campaign with a narrow 75-71 win.Patty Mills did his best to keep the Boomers in touch, finishing with 18 points, but Brazil's big men proved more than Australia could handle.Brazil's Tiago Splitter said afterwards: 'We didn't play at 100% but we are happy because we fought to win a good game.'Nigeria almost squandered a 19-point lead but hung on to beat Tunisia 60-56.Nigeria used their superior size to dominate the first half and led 29-10 midway through the second quarter. Tunisia found their shooting rhythm but were edged out in an entertaining game.In the end,<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jbm1hbGw2Ni5jb20vcHJvZHVjdHMvTmlrZS1BaXItTWF4LUZseXBvc2l0ZS1zNzkzX3AxLmh0bWw_" target="_blank">Nike Air Max Flyposite</a> Al-Farouq Aminu led Nigeria with 15 points and nine rebounds.The USA lived up to their dominant reputation with a 98-71 win over France in their opening game.Although the French, who have plenty of high-calibre talent in their squad, were able to match them for the first quarter, the defending champions quickly began to wear them down thereafter.A score gap of one at the end of the first had become a deficit of 16 by half-time, before nearing 30 in the final minutes.European champions Spain got their medal challenge under way with a 97-81 victory over China made comfortable by a late surge.Pau Gasol scored 21 points while Serge Ibaka added 17, Juan Carlos Navarro 14 and Jose Calderon 12.Great Britain's long-awaited return to action in Olympic men's Basketball ended in a 95-75 defeat as they were on the wrong end of an explosive display from Russian star Andrei Kirilenko.

<br /><br />Top seeds and world champions Zhang Nan and Zhao Yunlei will take on number two pair Xu Chen and Ma Jin for the title at Wembley Arena on Friday after hard-fought semi-final wins.Both pairs needed to come from behind with Zhang and Zhao extended by Denmark's Joachim Fischer and Christinna Pedersen before prevailing 17-21 21-17 21-19 in 82 gruelling minutes.Xu and Ma needed to hold out in a nervy second game after losing a tight opener against All England champions Tontowi Ahmad and Liliyana Natsir before winning 21-23 21-18 21-13 in 75 minutes.The defeat for Ahmad and Natsir means that for the first time in Olympic history Indonesia will not claim at least one Badminton gold. They were the country's last representatives after defeat for men's pair Mohammad Ashan and Bona Septano earlier in the day.The semi-final line-up for the women's Singles competitions was completed on Day 6.Europe's top player,<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jbm1hbGw2Ni5jb20v" target="_blank">Nike Zoom Rookie</a>  fifth seed Tine Baun, lost to India's fourth-seeded Saina Nehwal.The other three players in the last four are all Chinese.Top seed Wang Yihan brushed off Cheng Shiao Chieh 21-14 21-11, Wang Xin avoided an upset to beat Thai Intanon Ratchanok 17-21 21- 17 21-14 and Li Xuerui overcame Hong Kong's Yip Pui Yin 21-12 22-20.
<br /><br />The Belgian will retire for the second time after the US Open later this month and will do so without an Olympic medal after her first and last Games was brought to an end.Sharapova made a fast start and, although Clijsters delighted the Centre Court crowd by breaking back in the second set, she could not force a decider and lost out 6-2 7-5.Clijsters was happy to exit centre stage, saying: 'It was great. It's a nice experience every time you go out on Centre Court so I'm happy to say that my last match at Wimbledon was on Centre Court.'I think overall she was the better player. She served well and I think of all the matches that I've played against her this is the best that she's served,<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jbm1hbGw2Ni5jb20vcHJvZHVjdHMvS2V2aW4tRHVyYW50LU5ldy1LRC1JVi0tbjE0Nl9wMS5odG1s" target="_blank">Nike Zoom KD IV</a>  and on grass it's going to be tough to beat her.'Sharapova was thrilled with the result, and she said: 'I certainly had to step up today from my previous round. Kim is so experienced, a grand slam champion.'I knew that it would be really tough and I really wanted to win today so I stayed extra focused. It was obviously getting close and it was such a tight second set I was just happy to get through this one.'Russia is now guaranteed at least a silver medal in the women's Singles because in the last four Sharapova will face countrywoman Maria Kirilenko.The 14th seed earlier pulled off a very impressive 7-6 (7/3) 6-3 victory over sixth seed and former Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova.

<br /><br />Speaking during the Closing Ceremony of the Olympic Games in the Olympic Stadium in Stratford, he said: 'The British people got behind London's bid and they got behind London's Games. Our Opening Ceremony proclaimed that these would be a Games for everyone. At our Closing Ceremony, we can say that these were a Games by everyone.'In addition to thanking those who built the venues and helped organise the Games, Seb Coe played tribute to the athletes for their outstanding performances.

You have our admiration and our congratulations.'He added: 'On the first day of these Games I said we were determined to do it right. I said that these Games would see the best of us.'On this last day I can conclude with these words: When our time came - Britain,<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jbm1hbGw2Ni5jb20v" target="_blank">Air Max</a> we did it right.

<br /><br />Kevin Durant is going from representing the red, white and blue to walking the red carpet.Adding to a resume that already includes being a three-time NBA scoring champion and Olympic gold medalist, Durant was the star as his movie ''Thunderstruck'' premiered in Oklahoma City's Bricktown entertainment district Sunday night. It opens in other theaters Friday.Durant strolled down a red carpet in a black T-shirt, grey vest, white jeans and black sneakers to answer questions about his acting skills instead of the deadly shooting ability that propelled the Oklahoma City Thunder to the NBA Finals last season.''Of course, people are going to look at it a little different because I'm a basketball player and I'm doing something different,'' Durant said. ''A basketball player is what I do. It's not really just solely who I am. I like to do other things.''It's all about conquering your fears. That's one thing I did with this,<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jbm1hbGw2Ni5jb20v" target="_blank">Nike Free</a> stepping in front of a camera and people yelling 'Action!' It's not the norm for me. I did something outside the box, and I'm glad it turned out pretty well.''Durant was getting his first chance to see the completed project, which was shot in Louisiana during the NBA lockout last year and then during the season in Oklahoma City in January.It also features Nickelodeon star Taylor Gray, Brandon T. Jackson from ''Big Momma's House'' and Jim Belushi. Gray plays a Thunder fan whose lack of basketball ability is magically switched with Durant's All-Star skill set.''I'm just blessed. I'm just blessed to be alive, first of all. Blessed to be here, to have this opportunity,'' Durant said.
<br /><br />''Not too many people can say they starred in a movie as a basketball player, with a lot of different things they're juggling, but I'm glad I did it.''The folks at Warner Bros. might not have been able to pick a better time to put out a movie starring Durant, exactly one week after he won Olympic gold as Team USA's leading scorer and a little over a month after he played against LeBron James' Miami Heat for the NBA title.The family comedy follows in the footsteps of other movies with NBA superstars as the headliners, including ''Space Jam'' starring Michael Jordan and ''Kazaam'' with Shaquille O'Neal.''When a guy goes over and hugs his mom after the game, that's a guy that people are going to like and that's what you need in a movie,'' director John Whitesell said. ''You need a guy, a star, who people are going to want to relate to or are going to care about.''You want people to care that Kevin can't shoot. If LeBron can't shoot,<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jbm1hbGw2Ni5jb20vcHJvZHVjdHMvTmlrZS1GcmVlLTUuMC1WNC13b21lbi1uMTQ3MF9wMS5odG1s" target="_blank">Nike Free 5.0 V4</a> I don't care. I'm happy. But if Kevin can't shoot, I'm sad.''Whitesell said Durant might have been caught off guard by the days he had to be on set and in front of the camera for 12 hours, when his previous experience was with much briefer commercial shoots.The first day, he had Durant bounce a ball in a gym and worked toward getting him comfortable in his own shoes - because he plays himself in the movie.''I wanted to create an atmosphere for him that he felt comfortable and confident in, so that he could grow into it as we went, and I think that went really well,'' said Whitesell, who remembered his only other experience filming athletes coming on a cameo appearance by Patrick Ewing and Mark Jackson on the short-lived NBC show ''Tattingers.'' 
<br /><br />The Nike Free 5.0 V4  Shoes emphasize natural foot movement while delivering an extraordinary feel, combined with the  cushioning, traction and underfoot protection of a shoe. Updates to this version of the Free 5.0 make it even better for runners  who want to reap the benefits of barefoot training.

<br />Marcus Jordan, a son of former NBA star Michael Jordan, pleaded no contest on Thursday for disturbing the peace during the U.S. Olympic Swim Trials in Omaha, Neb., and was ordered to pay a $250 fine, the Omaha World-Herald reported.Jordan, 21, entered his plea in Douglas County Court in Omaha after prosecutors dropped a charge of obstructing an officer.According to World-Herald report, Jordan smiled after the hearing and posed for a photo with Court Clerk Lillie Bradford. He waved to the assembled media, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jbm1hbGw2Ni5jb20v" target="_blank">Nike  Hyperdunk</a> but did not comment.Jordan was listed as a guard on the University of Central Florida basketball team at the time of the July incident, but has since left the team. His lawyer said his departure was not related to the misdemeanor conviction.Omaha police arrested Jordan on July 1 after being called to a hotel where there was a disturbance.An off-duty police officer reported that Jordan was arguing with a woman outside the hotel and appeared to be intoxicated.On Thursday, according to the World-Herald, Omaha city prosecutor Marty Conboy said video from a surveillance camera showed a very brief disturbance when the officer came between Jordan and the woman. Conboy said Jordan said he was unaware the person was an off-duty officer.
<br />  Jordan's lawyer, Steve Lefler, said Jordan went to the Omaha police station the next day to apologize.Jordan was in Omaha for the trials to support high school friend Conor Dwyer and Dwyer's training partner, Ryan Lochte.

<br /><br />Kobe Bryant isn't one to mince words. His trash-talking style on the court is legendary and his sense of humor is as dry as it gets. So when Bryant told his Team USA teammates during Olympic training in early July that Dwight Howard would be traded to the Lakers, there were plenty of skeptics. Howard had several suitors at that point, but Bryant's prediction still stayed in the back of Kevin Durant's mind. Bryant's words eventually became reality as Howard was dealt to the Lakers from the Orlando Magic in a four-team blockbuster trade on Aug. 10.&quot;Kobe called that a month before it happened,&quot; Durant told Yahoo! Sports while promoting his new movie &quot;Thunderstruck.&quot;&quot;I didn't believe him. He was just like, 'We are going to have Dwight. We are going to have Steve Nash.' He just talks a lot of trash, jokes and laughs. But he said it. I don't think anyone paid attention to it but me and him. He said it and it happened. And they got better,<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jbm1hbGw2Ni5jb20v" target="_blank">Nike Free</a> a lot better.&quot;Dwight's name was being thrown on every team. Houston, Brooklyn, the Lakers. But I guess he called it right.&quot;With his focus on an Olympic gold medal at the time of that trade, Durant initially declined to discuss how the Lakers' moves could affect the Thunder's hopes of returning to the NBA Finals next season. But now that he's back home with a gold medal in hand, Durant says the &quot;confident&quot; Thunder are looking forward to the challenge posed by the new-look Lakers next season. 
<br /> &quot;People outside, fans, media, of course they are going to say [the Lakers are the favorites] because on paper they have the best lineup in the league. But you still got to play the games. We respect everybody. We are going to go through the league respecting everybody as well.&quot;We already view ourselves as an elite team, but we have to prove it again. Last year is over with.&quot;  The Thunder knocked off the Lakers in the second round of the playoffs last season. Los Angeles, however, has replaced traded All-Star center Andrew Bynum and departed point guard Ramon Sessions for two perennial All-Stars in Howard and Nash. The veteran Lakers have also added some depth in Antawn Jamison, Jodie Meeks,<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jbm1hbGw2Ni5jb20vcHJvZHVjdHMvTmlrZS1GcmVlLTMuMC1WNC1Xb21lbi1uMTU1N19wMS5odG1s" target="_blank">Nike Free 3.0 V4 Women</a> Chris Duhon and Earl Clark while re-signing Jordan Hill and keeping Pau Gasol.Meanwhile, the Thunder return wiser and more experienced after losing to the Heat in the NBA Finals. Oklahoma City has a nemesis of Howard's in defensive-minded center Kendrick Perkins. Additionally, point guard Eric Maynor will return from injury and the Thunder have an intriguing rookie in Perry Jones III.&quot;It was a great move for [the Lakers],&quot; Durant said. &quot;[Howard] is the most dominant center in the league. It's going to make it tough on other teams. But I like that challenge. We all like that challenge in OKC. It should be fun.&quot;That's what the Lakers do. They make big moves. That's part of their DNA.&quot;

<br /><br />DeWanna Bonner scored 24 points, Samantha Prahalis added 16 and Diana Taurasi had 13 to help the Phoenix Mercury beat the Seattle Storm 75-68 on Thursday night to end a 10-game losing streak.Bonner, who had 11 rebounds, scored 13 points in the second half to help Phoenix (5-19) defeat the Storm for the first time in four games this season.''Man, it's been a long time since we've won,'' said Bonner, who entered the game as the No. 3 scorer in the league at 20 points per game. ''It felt really good to go out there and get a win on the road.''Camille Little had 11 points to lead Seattle (11-14) while Tanisha Wright added 10 points and eight rebounds. Reserve Tina Thompson had 10 points.Lauren Jackson shot just 2 of 8 from the field and hand six points for the Storm while Sue Bird was 3 of 9 from the field and finished with eight points and eight assists.Seattle has lost four of five.''I think we just had a bad game,'' Bird said. ''They had a good game and we had a bad game. We need to figure it out quick. There are only nine games until the end of the season and that's not a lot of time.''The Mercury broke from a 54-all tie by outscoring Seattle 13-2 to start the fourth quarter.''They played hard and played together,<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jbm1hbGw2Ni5jb20v" target="_blank">Nike Free</a> but more importantly they had fun,'' Mercury coach Corey Gaines said. ''They were laughing, joking, talking to each other - that's the most important thing. If you have fun doing something, I think you do it better.''Taurasi, playing in just her fourth WNBA game of the year because of injuries, certainly had a good time.
<br />''It was a good game,'' Taurasi said. ''We've been saying that sometimes when you lose 10 games in a row you focus on the 10 losses, but we've focused on putting quarters together. Tonight we put together four quarters of smart and really good basketball.''Five players scored to ignite a 13-2 run by the Mercury to start the fourth quarter. Briana Gilbreath converted a three-point play and Taurasi hit a 3-pointer to give Phoenix a 67-56 lead with 6:35 remaining in the game.Shekinna Stricklen hit a 3 to cut the Mercury's lead to 69-66 with 3:39 left before Bonner answered with a layup and Prahalis hit two free throws to push the lead to seven.The Mercury led by as many as seven points in the third quarter before the Storm rallied to tie it 54-all at the end of the quarter.Bonner scored 11 points to help the Mercury to a 36-32 halftime lead. She had nine in the second quarter,<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jbm1hbGw2Ni5jb20vcHJvZHVjdHMvTmlrZS1GcmVlLVRyYWluZXItNS4wLW4xNTQ5X3AxLmh0bWw_" target="_blank">Nike Free Trainer 5.0</a> including the first six of the period.Little scored seven points in the opening half for the Storm, which led 29-28 before Phoenix closed with an 8-3 run.Jackson slumped in her third WNBA game of the season after she had scored 16 in an 84-66 win over New York on Sunday. She scored four in her debut Aug. 23 after sitting out the first half of the season to devote her time to the London Olympics for Australia.''I think that we're a team that's in transition right now,'' Storm coach Brian Agler said. ''We're bringing people in and we're going to try to get better and make the playoffs.'' 
<br />After learning that Stanford athletes had been training barefoot on the university's golf course, three of Nike's most innovative and creative employees set out to develop a shoe that felt natural and weightless, similar to bare feet. In 2002, they examined a group of men and women with pressure measuring insoles taped to their feet, using high-speed cameras to capture images of each foot in motion.The Nike Free Trainer 5.0 TB Men's Training Shoe delivers a flexible, sock-like fit, excellent support and multi-surface traction that stands up to abuse during field drills,<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jbm1hbGw2Ni5jb20vdmlld3MvTmlrZS1GcmVlLVRyYWluZXItNS4wLUdyZXktUmVkLVdoaXRlLTAwMS02Njc5NS5odG1s" target="_blank">Nike Free Trainer 5.0 Grey Red White</a> running or lifting.

Flex grooves along the length and width of the midsole enhance flexibility and articulation, allowing the foot to easily move in any direction. Wider grooves in the forefoot allow toes to engage more during landings and push-offs. Plus, no-sew construction eliminates stitching for even more flexibility and comfort.For a lockdown fit and support, this training shoe features a dual-pull lacing system that wraps around the foot and attaches to the midsole. Dynamic Fit construction wraps the forefoot for a glove-like fit that moves as the foot moves for extra support. And the sidewall wraps up to cradle the heel and the midfoot to help keep the foot in place during side-to-side and diagonal movements.For more details,pls visit <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnmall66.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.cnmall66.com</a>.

<br />Angel McCoughtry was quiet for the first three quarters in her return from a two-game suspension. She then took over in the fourth.McCoughtry scored 18 of her 24 points in the final period to lead the Dream to an 87-80 victory over the Connecticut Sun on Sunday, and then triumphantly jumped into the arms of teammate Erika De Souza at midcourt to celebrate.''I was so excited,'' McCoughtry said. ''It felt so good to be back on the floor. I'll never take basketball for granted again.''The WNBA's leading scorer shot 7 for 8 from the field as the Dream (14-13) pulled away from a third-quarter tie to hand Connecticut (19-7) just its third loss in 13 road games.Sancho Lyttle had 15 points and 13 rebounds,<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jbm1hbGw2Ni5jb20v" target="_blank">Air Yeezy</a> and De Souza finished with 14 points and 12 boards. However, the story was McCoughtry's big fourth quarter.''We all know she can do that,'' Lyttle said. ''To prove it with all the nonsense we had going on proves she's a good player and she can help us win.''McCoughtry didn't enter the game until the final minute of the first quarter and had just two points at halftime while missing all three of her shots from the floor. She was 1 of 6 going into the final quarter, with four of her six points coming at the foul line.''She went out and played hard and got into the flow,'' coach Fred Williams said. ''She had to really get her legs under her a little bit in the first half and got in a rhythm with a few shots in the second half.
<br />Kara Lawson had 16 points and five assists, and Danielle McCray scored a season-high 15 - including 13 in the final quarter - for the Sun. But not even McCray, who was 3 for 3 on 3-pointers in the quarter, could match McCoughtry.''I was disappointed in our defense in the fourth quarter,'' Sun coach Mike Thibault said. ''Angel had the ball on the wing and we acted like she wasn't going to shoot. And we all know that she usually does.''McCoughtry was suspended indefinitely for a violation of unspecified team policy by Williams on Monday after he was promoted to take over as coach and general manger for the fired Marynell Meadors.''I was never worried about that,'' McCoughtry said when asked if she thought she'd be able to rejoin the Dream. ''I was just worried about the pressure on the team with all this.''McCoughtry, who missed a loss to Tulsa and a victory over Washington,<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jbm1hbGw2Ni5jb20vcHJvZHVjdHMvQWlyLVllZXp5LUlJLW4xMTI5X3AxLmh0bWw_" target="_blank">Air Yeezy II</a> had been involved in a conflict with Meadors and sat out two games for personal reasons before returning Aug. 25 in a loss to Minnesota. She played 20 minutes off the bench in that game and scored 14 points.Williams reinstated McCoughtry on Saturday and she took part in an open practice for season-ticket holders. Williams said on Wednesday that he had given the former No. 1 draft choice from Louisville a written list of requirements she had to sign and comply with before being reinstated. 
<br />Nike Air Yeezy is a line of shoes released by Nike, Inc. in 2009. They were sold exclusively to tier zero nike accounts and were one of the most sought after shoes of 2009. The shoe was designed in part by Kanye West. This Air Yeezy had a retail cost of around $220 USD but because of limited quantities, prices for the shoe can be around $800.In The Black Mamba video,<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jbm1hbGw2Ni5jb20vdmlld3MvQWlyLVllZXp5LUlJLUdyZXktUmVkLUJsYWNrLTY5MjQ2Lmh0bWw_" target="_blank">Air Yeezy II Grey Red Black</a> Kanye West is seen sporting a pair of brand new Nike shoes that have not been seen anywhere. As time progressed, the artist has been seen wearing these new shoes at different events. This has led to speculation that they are in fact the Air Yeezy 2. Though there is no official information about the shoes, rapper Big Sean added fuel to the fire when asked about the shoes. When asked if they were coming out, he stated that there is a possibility before going on to add that &quot;I know too, I just cant say it&quot;. One website has claimed that the shoes will be released this year with three different colorways. It is believed that all three shoes will be released on the same date and will cost $245. The increase is due to better quality of material used in the construction. It is also stated that the Black pair that Mr.West is currently wearing will not be released.

<br />While they've already secured a playoff berth, the Los Angeles Sparks haven't looked much like contenders of late.A matchup against the worst team in the league could be just what they need to regroup.With Alana Beard and Marissa Coleman both likely to receive warm ovations in their return to the nation's capital, Los Angeles tries to avoid a season-high fourth consecutive defeat Friday night when it faces the Washington Mystics.Since winning nine straight by an average of 15.3 points, the Sparks (19-9) haven't been able to get it together. Los Angeles came up short against sub-.500 foes Tulsa and Chicago before falling 88-77 to WNBA-best Minnesota on Tuesday - the third stop on its five-game road swing.Beard had 17 points while Jenna O'Hea scored 15 for the Sparks,<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jbm1hbGw2Ni5jb20v" target="_blank">Air Jordan</a> whose 20 turnovers led to 29 points for the Lynx. Leading scorers Kristi Toliver and Candace Parker combined for 11 points and 11 turnovers.&quot;They did a great job of making us do things we didn't want to do,&quot; Beard said. &quot;But at the same time we did a lot of things that were in our control in terms of turnovers and forced shots.&quot;Beard has picked up the pace over her last seven games, averaging 15.0 points - 4.1 more than her season mark. Those impressive numbers shouldn't come as much of a surprise to Washington, with whom she started her career. 
<br />Beard, who signed with Los Angeles after sitting out the previous two seasons with ankle and foot injuries, was a four-time All-Star while with the Mystics.While Beard has come up big for the Sparks, Coleman has averaged just 3.2 points off the bench since being acquired from Washington for guard Noelle Quinn in February.Coleman - and especially Beard - should be well received at the Verizon Center.&quot;I think it's going to be a really big game especially with Alana and Marissa coming back,&quot; Mystics leading scorer Crystal Langhorne said. &quot;Then having Candace Parker here; I just think it's going to be a really big game on Friday.&quot;Washington (5-22) has the fewest wins in the league and is in the midst of a season-worst six-game losing streak.The Mystics lost 77-70 to Eastern Conference-leading Connecticut on Tuesday despite Langhorne's game-high 23 points.&quot;We're playing better but we're still not winning so it's tough,&quot; said Langhorne, posting 15.8 points per game. &quot;We're not executing down the stretch and messing up on defense,<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jbm1hbGw2Ni5jb20vcHJvZHVjdHMvSm9yZGFuLTUtbjM0X3AxLmh0bWw_" target="_blank">Air Jordan 5</a> missing block outs, and things like that. You can't beat people when you're messing up on the little things.&quot;Every night we're coming and we're expecting to win so that's the thing we have to keep believing.&quot;Langhorne was limited to a season-low two points on 1-of-5 shooting as Washington fell 101-70 at Los Angeles on June 18.

<br />''There's so much (of a) stigma,'' Holdsclaw said. ''It's a challenge for me to travel and share my story and try to help people better cope with this and not be suffering in silence.''Holdsclaw spoke to a group of about 350 people as part of the university's VolAware initiative, which focuses on preventing violence, suicide and substance abuse. Sitting in the first two rows were the current Tennessee women's basketball team and Lady Vols head coach emeritus Pat Summitt.

''She's lived through it with me. She's been there. When everybody else thought I was just crazy and such a problem, she never turned her back on me. For that, I have a lot of respect for her.''Holdsclaw led Tennessee to three consecutive national championships from 1996-98 before beginning a pro career that included six WNBA All-Star selections. She also played on the U.S. Olympic team that won the gold medal in the 2000 Games. Holdsclaw compiled 3,025 career points at Tennessee and remains the Southeastern Conference's all-time leading scorer.

<br />San Francisco 49ers linebacker Clark Haggans has been suspended for three games by the NFL for violating the league's substance abuse policy, the 49ers announced Tuesday.Haggans was signed by the 49ers on Sept. 2 after he had been released by the Cardinals. His suspension apparently stems from a drunken-driving conviction in June. The suspension will start immediately, and he will be eligible to return the day after the 49ers' Oct. 7 game against the Buffalo Bills.&quot;Earlier today the team was made aware of the NFL's decision to suspend Clark Haggans for three games,&quot; 49ers general manager Trent Baalke said in a statement. &quot;We were certainly aware that this decision was a possibility as we evaluated Clark prior to adding him to our roster. Therefore, we are prepared to move forward accordingly.&quot;Jennings (groin) returned to full practice Tuesday,<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jbm1hbGw2Ni5jb20v" target="_blank">Adidas Adizero Rose</a> foxsportswisconsin.com reports. Coach Mike McCarthy said Tuesday morning that he expected Jennings to be a limited participant during Tuesday's practice, so the fact that he was able to suit up in full pads is encouraging, especially since the Packers don't play until Monday night. Early signs are pointing towards Jennings returning to action for Week 3 against the Seahawks. Haggans did not play in either of the 49ers' first two games. 
<br /> Jerry Jones believes he has a solution for the rumble created by the kneel-down on the final play Sunday at MetLife Stadium.The Dallas Cowboys owner believes the play should be outlawed, which would eliminate the uproar created when the Tampa Bay Buccaneers were aggressive on the final play, angering New York Giants coach Tom Coughlin. As was widely reported, Coughlin and Buccaneers coach Greg Schiano had words at midfield after the game.“I’ve always thought that that’s a wasted play for our fans,<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jbm1hbGw2Ni5jb20vcHJvZHVjdHMvQWRpZGFzLUFkaXplcm8tUm9zZS1JSUktbjE2NTNfcDEuaHRtbA__" target="_blank">Adidas Adizero Rose III</a> the kneel-down,” Jones said Tuesday on KRLD-FM in Dallas, according to ESPN Dallas. “(Former Kansas City Chiefs owner and Hall of Famer) Lamar Hunt tried several times to introduce a rule and have it voted on that you couldn’t kneel down. You had to run a play. Unless you were trying to advance the ball, then you got a penalty and time didn’t run off the clock. It’s not a good play.”It is a good play for teams trying to run out the clock in victory formation. If an offense wants to give up and kneel down, it should be allowed to. Schiano instructed his team to try to knock the ball loose. If the Bucs continue this practice, you wonder if an offense will target on of Tampa’s players. It would not be surprising.

<br />The post-Dwight Howard era opened on a sour note for the Orlando Magic as the New Orleans Hornets rode a late surge for an 85-80 preseason victory before a packed house at the Mexico City Arena on Sunday.The Magic, in their first game since trading six-time All-Star Howard to the Los Angeles Lakers as part of a blockbuster 12-player trade in August, failed to get more than 13 points from any of their five starters.&quot;We don't have any superstars on our team now,&quot; Magic forward Glen Davis, who finished the game with 13 points,<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jbm1hbGw2Ni5jb20vcHJvZHVjdHMvTmlrZS1GcmVlLXM3MDZfcDEuaHRtbA__" target="_blank">Nike Free</a> said as he left the locker-room. &quot;We need to win together.&quot;Treating 18,133 sports fans to the sights and sounds of the National Basketball Association, the Hornets' Brian Roberts led the way with a game-high 17 points.The Magic were led by E'Twaun Moore, who came off the bench to score 16 points, while local boy and starting center Gustavo Ayon added 12 points in the loss.The Magic led the game, often by double digits, until New Orleans tied it at 76 with about two minutes to go in the final quarter. Two free throws by forward Lance Thomas then put the Hornets ahead for good. The game signaled the start of a new era for the Magic since they parted ways with former first-overall draft pick Howard, the team's top scorer and rebounder for the last six seasons.But the Hornets' Ayon, only the third Mexican-born player in NBA history, was the clear crowd-favorite as fans cheered his every move. 
<br /> The exhibition match marked the start of the NBA preseason for both teams, as well as the 20th such game on Mexican soil, more than any other country outside the United States or Canada.On Saturday, former NBA All-Star turned league ambassador Cedric Ceballos told Reuters that Mexico City will host regular season games in 2012 and 2013, but a league executive said Sunday the announcement was premature.&quot;We have no plans (for regular season games in Mexico) at the moment,&quot; said Philippe Moggio, the NBA's vice president for Latin America.Moggio acknowledged &quot;internal conversations&quot; regarding such a development, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jbm1hbGw2Ni5jb20vcHJvZHVjdHMvTmlrZS1GcmVlLTMuMC1uMTE0Nl9wMS5odG1s" target="_blank">Nike Free 3.0</a> but said the league would not announce potential regular season games in Mexico until early next year.Hornets coach Monte Williams declared the international preseason game a success even beyond his team's win.&quot;The NBA is a global game and anytime you can extend the boundaries of basketball in a positive way, it's only going to help,&quot; said Williams.&quot;Locals get a chance to see the kind of basketball up close and personal that they don't normally get a chance to see and that's good for everybody.&quot;

<br />The undefeated Houston Texans were dealt a major blow after learning that leading tackler Brian Cushing will miss the rest of the 2012 National Football League (NFL) season with torn knee ligaments, the team said on Tuesday.The 25-year-old linebacker, who is also one of the defensive leaders for the 5-0 Texans, was injured in the second quarter of Houston's 23-17 win over the New York Jets on Monday.&quot;(It's) a big blow to our team,&quot; Texans head coach Gary Kubiak said on the team's website. &quot;You feel bad for Brian because he works so hard and is playing so well.&quot;Cushing is expected to undergo surgery in two-to-three weeks once swelling on the injured knee goes down.The Texans' most valuable player in 2011,<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jbm1hbGw2Ni5jb20vcHJvZHVjdHMvQWlyLU1heC0tczU2Nl9wMS5odG1s" target="_blank">Air Max </a> Cushing leads the NFL's third-ranked defense this season with 29 tackles and had five on Monday before exiting under his own power after a block by Jets guard Matt Slauson.Taken in the first round of the 2009 NFL Draft, Cushing had 133 tackles as a rookie, earning him a trip to the Pro Bowl and defensive rookie of the year honours. He also led the team in tackles in 2011. &quot;You don't replace players like (Cushing),&quot; said Kubiak. &quot;The rest of your football team has got to pick it up and play better. We're going to be calling on everybody else to do their job a little bit better.&quot;
<br />On an NFL weekend that generated no movement among the top four players on the MVP Meter, Ben Roethlisberger is on the rise even though he did not throw for a touchdown and had arguably his worst game of the season Sunday.With Philly leading by a point and 6:33 left in the game, Pittsburgh was on the brink of falling to 1-3. Its offense was backed up on its own 10-yard line after Willie Colon was flagged for holding, setting up 1st-and-20. However, Roethlisberger completed four of his five passes — including two on third downs — for 50 yards and led the Steelers on a 14-play,<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jbm1hbGw2Ni5jb20vcHJvZHVjdHMvQWlyLU1heC05NS1uMTIwX3AxLmh0bWw_" target="_blank">Air Max 95</a>  64-yard drive, setting up PK Shaun Suisham’s game-winning 34-yard field goal, which sailed through the uprights with no time left on the clock.It was Roethlisberger’s controlled play late, in a game that easily could have resulted in a crushing loss, that keyed the Steelers’ comeback.Pittsburgh is a .500 team again and Roethlisberger is the sixth-highest rated passer in the league (100.6). He has kept Pittsburgh afloat through defensive injuries and a dormant running game that was little help prior to Rashard Mendenhall’s return in Week Five.

<br />Jason Hanson kicked a 45-yard field goal in overtime as the Detroit Lions rallied from a 10-point fourth-quarter deficit to beat the Philadelphia Eagles 26-23 on Sunday.Held in check most of the game,<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jbm1hbGw2Ni5jb20vcHJvZHVjdHMvQWlyLUpvcmRhbi13b21lbi1zNjA2X3AxLmh0bWw_" target="_blank">Air Jordan </a> Matthew Stafford led Detroit to 17 points in the fourth quarter. He threw a touchdown pass and ran for a score.Detroit had two shots from the Eagles 1 yard line after a pass interference penalty on Colt Anderson with 13 seconds left in regulation. But Stafford misfired on both passes and Hanson kicked a 19-yard field goal to send it to overtime.The Lions (2-3) sacked Michael Vick on the first two plays of the extra quarter, forced a punt out of the end zone and started at midfield.Stafford hit Calvin Johnson for a 17-yard gain to the Eagles 27 on first-and-20.

He tied Matt Flynn's game record for TD passes, set in last year's regular-season finale against Detroit.
<br />Washington's Robert Griffin III ran for 138 yards and two touchdowns, including a 76-yard run with 2:43 to play, as the Redskins ended an eight-game home losing streak with a 38-26 win over the Minnesota Vikings.A week after he left the game early with his first NFL concussion, Griffin also completed 17 of 22 passes for 182 yards with one touchdown and one interception.Russell Wilson passed to Sidney Rice for a 46-yard touchdown with 1:18 remaining as the Seattle Seahawks rallied for 14 points in the final 7:31 to beat the New England Patriots 24-23, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jbm1hbGw2Ni5jb20vcHJvZHVjdHMvQWlyLUpvcmRhbi1GbGlnaHQtVGhlLVBvd2VyLS1uMTY3NF9wMS5odG1s" target="_blank">Air Jordan Flight The Power </a> while Matt BryJairus Byrd's second interception of the game set up Rian Lindell's 25-yard field goal 3:50 into overtime as the Buffalo Bills edged the Cardinals 19-16, ending Arizona's eight-game home winning streak.At San Francisco, Antrel Rolle intercepted two passes by Alex Smith and Prince Amukamara picked off another for New York as the Giants thrashed the 49ers 26-3 in a rematch of last season's National Football Conference championship game.Jacoby Jones equaled an NFL record with a 108-yard kickoff return as the Baltimore Ravens squeaked past the Dallas Cowboys 31-29, while Josh Freeman threw for 328 yards and three touchdowns in the Tampa Bay Buccaneers' 38-10 win over Kansas City Chiefs.In other games, The Cleveland Browns downed the Cincinnati Bengals 34-24, the New York Jets trounced the Indiana Colts 35-9 and the Miami Dolphins beat the St. Louis Rams 17-14.

<br />Defensive coordinators still don’t know how to defend Griffin. Most teams have opted to rush four and play zone behind it, afraid of having the defensive backs’ eyes anywhere but on the backfield. With that approach, the results have been mixed. Although Griffin has thrown two interceptions with only two TD passes in 126 attempts, he’s completing almost 70 percent of his passes, per STATS LLC.On one of the few blitzes the Vikings sent at him last week, Griffin burned them with a 76-yard TD run. Overall on the season, Griffin has thrown the ball well,<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jbm1hbGw2Ni5jb20v" target="_blank">Nike Free</a> too, against five or more rushers: He has completed 17-of-24 passes with three TDs and no interceptions. Griffin’s poise in pressure situations has been obvious, and the only team to really rattle him was the Bengals in the first half when the Redskins had protection problems following the injury to OLT Trent Wiliams.Griffin also has benefited from the running of fellow rookie, RB Alfred Morris. A no-nonsense, one-cut zone runner, Morris has consistently gotten what is blocked for him and put Griffin in great second- and third-down situations. So, even in a game in which WR Pierre Garcon (back) might not be able to go, the passing options look to be in decent shape with the play-action potential and the increased roles for TE Fred Davis and WR Santana Moss of late.
<br />The Giants showed last week that they still can pressure and cover, sacking the 49ers’ quarterbacks six times (including mobile &quot;Wildcat&quot; QB Colin Kaepernick twice) and collecting three interceptions. Both had come into question previously. And the fact that the Giants have defended two athletic quarterbacks, Carolina’s Cam Newton and Philadelphia’s Michael Vick, probably helps when coordinator Perry Fewell comes up with his game plan.New York, too, is likely to rush four a lot of the time. But don’t be shocked if the Giants use more zone pressures than normal in an effort to confuse Griffin and eliminate some of his hot routes. The Giants mixed up their pressure packages last week, rotating in Marvin Austin and Adrien Tracy and moving Mathias Kiwanuka around effectively, and more as an end than as a linebacker. Those versatile players, along with star DEs Justin Tuck and Jason Pierre-Paul,<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jbm1hbGw2Ni5jb20vcHJvZHVjdHMvTmlrZS1GcmVlLVRSLUZpdC1uMTE1MF9wMS5odG1s" target="_blank">Nike Free TR Fit</a> should create some mismatches up front and help pressure the rookie.The Redskins run lots of rollouts, bootlegs and waggles and love to get Griffin in space. But they are far from afraid to go into a rhythm passing game and use three- and five-step drops. The play-calling, for the most part, has been very good — and unpredictable at times, too. The Giants will try to fool Griffin, but it’s hard not to be a little bit on your heels defensively with such an athletic QB. They also don’t want to get too cute defensively and get away from what they do best — which is pressure with the front four and not resort to wanton blitzing.

<br />A New Jersey woman who worked for the NBA as a senior account executive filed a $3 million gender discrimination lawsuit against the league Tuesday, saying it forced her and two other women with young children out of their jobs.Lawyers for Brynn Cohn of Hoboken filed the lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, seeking unspecified damages from the National Basketball Association.The lawsuit said Cohn and two other women with young children were forced out of their jobs by a hostile environment toward working mothers with childcare responsibilities. Cohn worked at the NBA for the last decade. She was a senior account manager managing print projects until her lawyers say she was forced to resign in January 2011. She has a 2-year-old child.A spokesman for the National Basketball Association did not immediately return a message for comment.The lawsuit accused the NBA of changing her department's hours while she was on pregnancy leave, requiring that she and other women with caregiving responsibilities work at the office into the evenings when there was no reason for late hours.Unable to spend thousands of more dollars for alternative childcare, Cohn was forced out of the company,<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jbm1hbGw2Ni5jb20v" target="_blank">Air Jordan</a> along with the other women, the lawsuit said.''This lawsuit lays bare the open hostility to which women with young children are consistently subjected as NBA employees,'' said David Sanford, lawyer for Cohn. ''In Ms. Cohn's case, this hostility took the form of discrimination in compensation and promotion opportunities, as well as the adoption of policies at the NBA designed to push out working mothers.''
<br />No one can say this is the same ol' Atlanta Hawks.Tired of one year blending into the next, with little progress in either direction, the Hawks decided to take a dramatically different path heading into this season. Joe Johnson was traded. So was Marvin Williams.Atlanta was left with a guard-dominated team that could be highly entertaining - certainly, scoring shouldn't be a problem - but may be hard-pressed to win as many games. New general manager Danny Ferry has put together a roster filled with expiring contracts, making it clear that he's got his eye more on the future than the present.Still, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jbm1hbGw2Ni5jb20vcHJvZHVjdHMvQWlyLUpvcmRhbi0zLXdvbWVuLW40MjVfcDEuaHRtbA__" target="_blank">Air Jordan 3 women</a> coach Larry Drew believes the team has enough talent to make a run at its sixth straight playoff appearance. He refuses to call this a rebuilding year, even though he's one of those in the last year of his contract. The Hawks picked up his option year, but very pointedly didn't give him an extension.''I'm looking at this as a very unique opportunity, not only for me but for this team,'' Drew said. ''I'm not coming into this thing looking at it like we're starting over. We're going to build off what we've done in the past.''Indeed, the Hawks have plenty of talented players. Josh Smith is coming off perhaps the best season of his career. Al Horford is a former All-Star who missed most of last season with a pectoral injury, but made a dramatic return in the playoffs. Jeff Teague is coming into his own as a point guard. Lou Williams, one of the league's top sixth men, was signed as a free agent.

<br />James Harden, who was acquired by the Houston Rockets as part of major trade on Saturday, told reporters on Sunday he intends to sign a long-term contract extension with the Rockets.&quot;I'll let them figure it out, them and my agent,&quot; Harden said, according to the Houston Chronicle. &quot;My focus now is on Houston and how to make them better.&quot;Harden,<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jbm1hbGw2Ni5jb20v" target="_blank">Air Max</a>  the NBA Sixth Man of the Year last season, had been trying to work out a contract extension with Oklahoma City, but a deal could not be reached and the trade resulted.Harden does not expect a problem in reaching an agreement with Houston.The Chronicle reported the Rockets will offer a maximum contract, worth either $78.6 million over five years or $60.2 million over four years.Reportedly, the Thunder's final offer was in the range of $55 million for four years.ThenThunder acquired guards Kevin Martin and Jeremy Lamb, two first-round picks and a second-round pick in exhange for Harden.The Washington Wizards got their roster down to 15 players on Sunday by waiving center-forward Brian Cook and guard Shelvin Mack.Cook had been signed by Washington to a training camp contract on September 17 after averaging 3.1 points and 2.5 rebounds for the Wizards last season.Mack averaged 3.6 points and 2.0 assists as a rookie last season. 
<br />The Dallas Mavericks have waived forward/center Melvin Ely and forward Chris Douglas-Roberts, leaving them with still one roster move to make by Monday.The moves Sunday came only a day after Ely and Douglas-Roberts signed non-guaranteed contracts, and before they had even practiced with the team.That leaves Dallas with 16 players on the roster, one over the limit it has to get to a day before Tuesday night's season opener at the Los Angeles Lakers.The Mavericks are expected to permanently part with guard Delonte West, who last week was suspended indefinitely Thursday for unspecified conduct considered detrimental to the team. It was his second suspension this month.Two-times NBA scoring champion Tracy McGrady has denied money was a factor in his decision to join the Qingdao Eagles in the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA).&quot;I played 15 years in the NBA,&quot; the CBA's highest-profile import told the China Daily newspaper. &quot;I made a lot of money. No, money has nothing to do with it.&quot;McGrady, who played alongside Yao Ming for the Houston Rockets for six years from 2004-10, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jbm1hbGw2Ni5jb20vcHJvZHVjdHMvQWlyLU1heC0yNDctd29tZW4tbjY3MF9wMS5odG1s" target="_blank">Air Max 247 women</a> will reportedly become the biggest earner in the CBA on an estimated $800,000 per year.The seven-times All-Star has already impressed his new employers with his work ethic and professionalism in practice and maintained he was fully committed to the Eagles.&quot;I am not going back to the NBA,&quot; said the 33-year-old McGrady, coming off a career-low season averaging 5.3 points in just 16 minutes with the Atlanta Hawks.

		<document id="39c9221b3dfd17c2acad0828333d9413" url=""><![CDATA[Air Jordan 11 Black Varsity Royal White<br/><br/>Bobcats president of basketball operations Rod Higgins and Cho went out of their way at Wednesday's pre-draft press conference to say they're excited about who they might get at No. 2, but the reality is they're still very much open for business.''We've had a ton interest from across the league in the second pick,'' said Higgins,<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jbm1hbGw2Ni5jb20v" target="_blank">Air Jordan</a> who refused to name any potential trade partners. ''We wouldn't be doing our jobs if we didn't listen and find alternative ways to try to help our ball club.''They did that Tuesday night via trade.The Bobcats dealt veteran small forward Corey Maggette to the Detroit Pistons for shooting guard Ben Gordon and a future first-round draft pick. The first-round pick gives the Bobcats a valuable asset down the road and Gordon gives the team.Gordon is 12th among active NBA players in career 3-point shooting percentage at 40.6 percent.Higgins said he spoke to Gordon after the deal was completed and he was ''very excited'' about coming to Charlotte.''He wants to come in and help us win games,'' Higgins said.The Gordon trade is the first step in a major roster overhaul the next two years.The Michael Jordan-owned Bobcats finished with the worst winning percentage (.106) in NBA history this past season and the pressure is on to make good decisions after a variety of poor trades and draft picks in recent years that have left fans disgruntled.
<br /><br />The decision to draft Gonzaga star Adam Morrison with the third overall pick in 2006 proved to be a disaster and trading for Tyrus Thomas hasn't panned out either.The Bobcats look to change that tide this year.''We have a lot of cap room this summer and more cap room in 2013,'' Cho said. ''We acquired a really valuable asset with the (Pistons') first-round pick - especially with the protection involved - that we can use down the road or in a trade. And we added a scorer and a shooter and consummate professional in Ben that we're excited about.''On the flip side, the loss of Maggette leaves the Bobcats with a gaping hole at the No. 3 spot as Derrick Brown is the only player on the roster who really fits that role.That doesn't mean the Bobcats will be more inclined to use the No. 2 pick on a small forward,<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jbm1hbGw2Ni5jb20vcHJvZHVjdHMvSm9yZGFuLTExLW40Ml9wMS5odG1s" target="_blank">Air Jordan 11</a> Cho said.Cho lives by the philosophy of ''draft talent and trade for need,'' meaning the Bobcats could still fill the small forward position in free agency or via trade.They're expected to have about $20 million in salary cap space this summer and could create even more if they decided to use the amnesty tag on Thomas, due to make $26 million over the next three seasons. 
<br /><br />Air Jordan 11 Black Varsity Royal White may be the most adored of the Air Jordan 11 (XI). They are dubbed the Space Jams because they were worn by MJ in the 1996 movie. They feature a black upper, which includes black patent leather, along with a varsity royal Jumpman logo. The white midsole, which does stand out and draw attention to the shoe, sits on a clear outsole, which looks yellow here because they tend to turn that way with use and even by simply sitting there, as the oxygen in the air will do that to them. The Air Jordan 11 (XI) draws inspiration from a tuxedo design, and it is quite evident with the patent leather,<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jbm1hbGw2Ni5jb20vdmlld3MvQWlyLUpvcmRhbi0xMS1CbGFjay1WYXJzaXR5LVJveWFsLVdoaXRlLTE3MzEwLmh0bWw_" target="_blank">Air Jordan 11 Black Varsity Royal White</a> and many of the colorways.For all of you Jordan Brand fans out there, you can rejoice as the news seems to be official that the Air Jordan XI (11) Retro in Black, Varsity Royal, and White otherwise known to all as the Space Jams will be retroed this Holiday 2009 Season as a Limited Jordan Quickstrike Release that will be limited to select Jordan Brand accounts worldwide. The shoes are very much identical to the first time they were retroed back in 2000 with the exception of a few small details such as the reverse Jumpman logo near the ankle collar.For more details,pls visit <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnmall66.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.cnmall66.com</a>.
