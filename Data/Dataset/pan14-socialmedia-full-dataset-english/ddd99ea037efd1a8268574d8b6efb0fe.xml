UK legislation is wide ranging and recent changes to the law have increased the likelihood of money laundering charges being pursued vigorously by the authorities. The team at Bark &amp; Co are experts in the interpretation of the law and in particular the parameters open to the prosecuting authorities in respect of money laundering charges.
<br /><br />In the UK, primary legislation on money laundering includes the Terrorism Act 2000, the Anti-Terrorism Crime &amp; Security Act 2001, the Proceeds of Crime Act 2005 and the Serious Crime and Police Act 2005. Secondary legislation comprises Money laundering Regulations 2003 and 2007. These increasingly stringent regulations put the onus on businesses to ensure that certain controls are in place to prevent them being used for money laundering purposes including customer due diligence measures and internal controls and monitoring systems.
<br /><br />Under UK law, it is a money laundering offence when a person enters into, or becomes concerned in, an arrangement which facilitates by whatever means the requisition, retention, use or control of criminal property (assets or money) by another person. In many cases, the authorities seek to block suspected money laundering activities at an early stage by applying severe constraints even where there is scant evidence of wrong doing. Actions include forfeiture of assets etc.
<br /><br />Bark &amp; Co frequently has cases under way where our clients are facing both fraud and money laundering charges. In one such recent example the FSA and City of London Police had mounted a combined operation into a large boiler room fraud based overseas. This case has been singled out as a good example of the increasing scale and prevalence of this type of fraud and demonstrates how international operations are being used to bypass the UK financial regulations and authorities to launder money abroad. In another fully contended, cut-throat trial, our client was implicated in a conspiracy to defraud a bank of more than £200M, setting up several offshore accounts to money launder the proceeds of the fraud. In all cases, Bark &amp; Co set out to ensure that our experience and expertise is carefully matched to client requirements, utilising the best legal counsel where necessary to achieve the best outcome.

<br />3. Tyle r- A re a Re a lto rs S a y S c a m A rtis t A tWo rk Ms. Ezzell learned of the scam Wednesday when a Tyler police detective called her about her company, RealEdge Real Estate, being used by the woman to scam a man into wiring $2,000 to Nigeria, she said. Her client’s property and her business name were used and somehow the woman opened the house to show the client, she added. After sending a notice to other local Realtors, Ms. Ezzell heard from three others that claimed the woman had scammed their clients. “True Realtors will always be glad to provide proof of who they are when asked,” Ms. Ezzell said. “When we post properties, we must always identify ourselves and our company as Realtors.” She said they also post their phone numbers, which can be easily accessed online to make sure the number matches the one in the advertisement.
<br />4. Tyle r- A re a Re a lto rs S a y S c a m A rtis t A tWo rk “We as Realtors hate that our profession is being targeted by way of this fraud and are just as frustrated as the public is with having to once again look at everyone with a veil of skepticism,” Ms. Ezzell said. “But we hate even more that innocent people are being taken advantage of and losing large sums of money due to this fraud scheme.” Better Business Bureau President Mechele Agbayani Mills said her office has not received any complaints about the woman but real estate scams are nothing new. “There’s always some kind of real estate scam,” she said, adding that they usually involve lease/rental properties.

<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailymotion.com%2Fvideo%2Fxsazwh_the-tyler-group-what-we-look-for"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xsazwh_the-tyler-group-what-we-look-for</a>
<br /><br />We prefer start-up companies as they offer excellent returns on growth with less risk than seed stage companies. 
<br /><br />What We Look For 
<br /><br />By targeting these companies we have achieved some excellent returns on our investments. Throughout the years startup and middle market companies have exceeded our expectations.
<br /><br />Occasionally we do invest in seed-stage companies who are looking for investments of up to $5 million if the company shows potential.
<br /><br />Industry Potential
<br /><br />In any investment we undertake, it is important that there is the right amount of investment potential. As a rule, we like to look at companies with mass market products, healthcare technology, green energy, patented technologies and IT solutions.
<br /><br />We like to see a strong board of directors and management team along with a strong brand. We examine the company to see what the potential is to take the company into a global market to become market leaders
<br /><br />We look at the structure of the company and assess whether it can rapidly scale up to fulfill accelerated growth. If we feel there are weak spots in a corporation that is restraining its growth, we can then provide the skill and talent to help the company to achieve its potential.
<br /><br />Adding Value
<br /><br />We understand that to add value to a company we need to create tangible assets in which you can assign a value. In each company we partner with we undertake the following:
<br /><br />Operations - We help systematise operations to ensure everything runs smoothly and efficiently. We measure each stage of operations so the management team can identify weaknesses and act to ensure best operations performance. By doing this, we not only improve growth capacity but also form an operation that works in harmony.
<br /><br />New Markets - Some of the best growth opportunities are found by targeting new emerging markets. Asia has been and is one of the most important emerging markets today. Over the last decade, we have dedicated a division in our company just to build and form relationships in the Asian market. We have one of the strongest partnership networks in Asia. This is becoming one of the fastest growing areas in our company providing some exciting opportunities for our clients.
<br /><br />Partnership With Management
<br /><br />It is important that companies that we partner have a strong management team; this is the key to the success of all companies that we partner. When we partner a team we like to ensure that everyone involved have an interest in what the aims are, we do this by structuring equity reward schemes that represent the talent and responsibility of the management team member. The aim of offering equity in the company is to ensure that the management teams are focused and want success for the company. 
<br /><br />We work with the CEO of each of our portfolio companies to decide the best equity distribution plan, it will be the CEO’s responsibility to execute the plan by allocating the equity among his team.
<br /><br />Process
<br /><br />Working with the CEO - We believe in working closely with the CEO of our portfolio companies, if needed we may even put one of our members into a company to assist the CEO. This will only happen if the CEO is busy and really needs help with any legal, banking, or negotiation issues.
<br /><br />It is important to understand that we are not there to undermine the CEO, it is just that sometimes the CEO can be busy with issues outside of the scope of his management team.
<br /><br />Due Diligence
<br /><br />Due diligence happens before any investment. This will involve an in-depth consultation with the CEO and his management team. We take a look at the current finances of the company along with all future projections. The time allowed for the due diligence process will depend on the company and the size of investment required.

<br /><br />For financial adviser John Tyler, the past two to three years have brought a slow return to normalcy.
<br /><br />As the recession unfolded, discussions about whether the financial system will collapse are largely behind Tyler who says his clients can now afford to think much more rationally, take risk and expect returns. But the investors went through a long, trying mental process to get there, he said.
<br /><br />“Now they can put their toes in the water,” said Tyler, vice president and financial adviser at Houston-based Hulburd/Tyler Group, a wealth management practice under the private banking and investment group at Merrill Lynch.
<br /><br />“That might come in the form of some high-quality fixed income, some high-quality municipal bonds. We’re now to the point where they’re starting to think about high quality equities that are going to pay them in dividend.”
<br /><br />Tyler, a 7-year veteran of the financial advisory business, joined Merrill Lynch three years ago when he partnered withJim Hulburd to form the Hulburd/Tyler Group in November 2009. The wealth managers average 23 clients each and manage between $25 million and $50 million per client.
<br /><br />The Hulburd/Tyler Group typically has two categories of clients, energy or technology executives and business owners, Tyler said. For C-suite executives, the group can deal with concentrated stock issues, help them create liquidity and perform other wealth advisory functions. For closely held businesses, the duo helps them through a process to understand whether they can sell their business or walks them through a process that teaches them what it means to run the business with longer-term investment goals in mind.
<br /><br />“Our experience in planning and executing things is as good as anyone in the industry,” he said.

<br /><br />Each of the decisions we make are based on our research process. Over the years we have successfully adapted to a changing financial climate and new methodologies in investing.
<br /><br />Investment Strategy
<br /><br />The research process is governed by principles. Principles that must be followed to the letter, no short cuts can be taken. By doing this, we give ourselves the best advantage when taking on an investment opportunity.
<br /><br />Our research process has seen returns on investments year on year. The process we have formed has given us an advantage in the market place, and has been one of the main reasons for our success.
<br /><br />We can identify any investment opportunities and confidently speculate whether it has the potential to fulfill growth.
<br /><br />When we find the right company, we can help them achieve their growth by letting them use our ability to help strengthen the weaker areas in the company.

<br />Moscow, September 3, 2012 - OJSC Verkhnechonskneftegaz (VCNG - a member of the TNK-BP group of companies) is aiming to boost oil production by 40% to 7 million tonnes by the end of the current year. At a meeting with the Governor of Irkutsk Region, Sergey Yeroschenko, TNK-BP Executive Director German Khan announced that the Company is now actively expanding its production capacities and is predicting a further increase in output.
<br /><br />During the meeting, which was also attended by Oleg Chemezov, Vice President and Director of TNK-BP's Siberia Branch, and Sergey Fedorov, General Director, VCNG, there was a discussion of the results of collaboration between TNK-BP and the Government of Irkutsk Region under their socio-economic cooperation agreement. This year, the Company will pay roughly 7 billion rubbles into the regional budget.
<br /><br />Irkutsk Governor Sergey Yeroschenko stressed: &quot;TNK-BP is one of the few companies that meets all its commitments&quot;. For his part, German Khan noted that &quot;there is mutual understanding&quot; between TNK-BP and the regional leadership on the issues under discussion. &quot;By the end of the year we will sign a new document covering the next period of time&quot;, he said.
<br /><br />Information for editors:
<br /><br />TNK-BP owns 74% of OJSC Verkhnechonskneftegaz (Rosneft owns 25.94%). The field is located in the north of Irkutsk Region, 1,100 km from Irkutsk city, and is operated by around 4,000 employees of VCNG and contractor organizations. Oil is supplied via the East Siberia - Pacific Ocean pipeline system. In 2011, the field produced 5 million tonnes of oil.
<br /><br />TNK-BP is one of the biggest players on the Russian goods and services market, with an annual contracting budget of over 200 billion rubles. The company is committed to following the best international standards of business conduct. While consistently implementing measures to combat corruption and unfair competition, TNK-BP demands the same from its suppliers and contractors.

Additionally, TNK-BP owns approximately 50% of the Russian oil and gas company Slavneft. TNK-BP's share in Russia's oil production (including its share in Slavneft) is about 16%.

<br /><br />We can only operate if we maintain the trust of people inside and outside the company. We must earn people’s trust by being fair and responsible in everything we do. We monitor our performance closely and aim to report in a transparent way. We believe good communication and open dialogue are vital if we are to meet the expectations of our employees, customers, shareholders and the local communities in which we operate.
<br />We are working to become a simpler business, with a clear focus on what we do best. Our distinctive capabilities include exploration, operations in deep water, the managing of giant fields and gas value chains, and our world-class downstream business – underpinned by technology and relationships. Strong financial performance is vital, because it enables us to make the investments necessary to produce the energy that society requires, as well as to reward and maintain the support of our shareholders. By supplying energy, we support economic development and help to improve quality of life for millions of people. Our activities also generate jobs, investment, infrastructure and revenues for governments and local communities. Our portfolio includes lower-carbon options with the potential to make a significant contribution, now and in the future.

<br /><br />BP America, Inc. announced today it will donate $1 million to support disaster relief efforts in Louisiana and Mississippi following Hurricane Isaac. 
<br /><br />The donation will be made to the American Red Cross and The Salvation Army and divided equally between the two hardest-hit states. 
<br /><br />“This assistance cannot fix all that has been broken by this natural disaster, but we hope it can help some of those in need today and contribute to a sustained recovery effort in the months ahead,” said Crystal E. Ashby, Executive Vice President of Government and Public Affairs for BP America. 
<br /><br />The storm forced BP to evacuate workers from offshore platforms and drilling rigs in the Gulf of Mexico, as well as from onshore facilities in south Louisiana and Mississippi, where hundreds of BP employees live. 
<br /><br />Separate from this donation, BP is also providing assistance to our employees and their families in the region.
