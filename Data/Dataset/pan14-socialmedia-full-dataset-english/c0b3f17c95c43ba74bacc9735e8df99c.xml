This isn't good for the condition or appearance of your skin, and guess what?<br /><br /><strong>You are poisoning your body with these toxins every day, through your diet!</strong><br /><br />For psoriasis sufferers, the toxins also indirectly affect your skin by suppressing the immune system. The suppressed immune system will start to malfunction, and create skin cells at a greatly increased rate.

I knew my body was telling me something, so I decided it was time I listened and did something about it.<br /><br /><strong>For me, it was kind of like my body was making a protest at all the junk I put into it!</strong><br /><br />The first changes I made where quite simple. I started to read labels more and see what was actually in the food I was eating. I stopped buying things like ready made meals, processed meat like bacon and anything that seemed like it had too many chemicals in. I started to buy organic fruit and vegetables, as well as fresh fish and wholemeal bread.<br /><br />By eating a diet with fewer chemicals, my body was able to deal with any toxins without having to get rid of them through the skin. Not only that, but it helped my immune system stabilise itself and function normally again. I began to notice a difference in the appearance on my skin within a week or so, where my psoriasis patches looked less red and angry.<br /><br />To this day, I believe that just making a few small dietary changes had a significant effect on my skins appearance, and made a major contribution to becoming clear of psoriasis altogether.<br /><br />Reading a Psoriasis Book maybe one of the smartest decision you have made.
