<br /><br />Ever since we had started talking I have felt that little bit happier. Things are still going a little bad with Tom &amp; I. So yeah, Tom's got Nikki; I've got Nathan. I guess we are even. I don't know why but right from I started talking to Nathan I knew I could talk to him about anything. Very weird.
<br /><br />If anyone messes with him, I will mess with them &amp; nothing will stop me. He sends the messages I wake up to every morning, that makes me wanna get up out of bed and not feeling so depressed locked in a dark room. I reckon everyone will be like &quot;its love at first sight&quot; or something like that, with what I am about to say... He has been on my mind right from when I started talking to him.
<br /><br />He is amazing, I love him [[AS A FRIEND]]

<br /><br />Alright, Tom, for gods sake, I DON'T hate you. If I did I wouldn't have you on MSN anymore and I wouldn't text you. I have tried being friends with you, but you obviously can't see that. Anything I have said isn't in a bitchy way alright? I thought it was obvious, but obviously not obvious enough for you.
<br /><br />I don't wanna lose our friendship because you know everything about me, the only one that knows everything. I can't just let that one person disappear from my life. Yeah, so I am not perfect, I think we all know that. You go off at me for the smallest things... I mean WTF yeah you have Nicole from here that you talk to and yeah wow, I have Nathan. Whats the big fuss? There is none. I am still trying to get it through my head that your the one that doesn't love me anymore and that we aren't together. But us fighting alot isn't helping me.
<br /><br />Yeah, so I have seen that you have obviously gone off to Nicole that your happy... Well why don't you show it to me? If I am such a god friend to you then do it. If not, don't....
<br /><br />Well I kinda expect a reply so 1) I know you have read this and 2) so I know exactly where I stand.
