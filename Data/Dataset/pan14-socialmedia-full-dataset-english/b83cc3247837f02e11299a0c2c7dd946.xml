Work is one of the most subtle ways of acquiring discipline. You should not look down on someone who works in a factory or produces material things. You learn a tremendous amount from such people. I think that many of our attitudinal problems about work come from a pseudo-sophistication of the analytic mind. You do not want to involve yourself physically at all. You want only to work intellectually or mentally.
<br /><br />This is a spiritual problem. Usually people interested in spiritual development think in terms of the importance of mind, that mysterious, high and deep thing that we have decided to learn about. But strangely enough, the profound and the transcendental are to be found in the factory. It may not fill you with bliss to look at it, it may not sound as good as the spiritual experiences that we have read about, but somehow reality is to be found there, in the way in which we relate with everyday problems. If we relate to them in a simple, earthy way, we will work in a more balanced manner, and things will be dealt with properly. If we are able to simplify ourselves to that extent, then we will be able to see the neurotic aspect of mind much more clearly.

<br />I am in Heaven now, sitting on God's lap. 
<br />He loves me and cries with me; for my heart has been broken. 
<br />I so wanted to be your little boy.  I don't quite understand what has happened. 
<br />I was so excited when I began realizing my existence. 
<br />I was in a dark, yet comfortable place. I saw I had fingers and toes. 
<br />I was pretty far along in my developing, yet not near ready to leave my surroundings. 
<br />I spent most of my time thinking or sleeping. 
<br />Even from my earliest days, I felt a special bonding between you and me. 
<br />Sometimes I heard you crying and I cried with you. Sometimes you would yell or scream, then cry. 
<br />I heard Daddy yelling back. 
<br />I was sad, and hoped you would be better soon. 
<br />I wondered why you cried so much. One day you cried almost all of the day. 
<br />I hurt for you. I couldn't imagine why you were so unhappy. 
<br />That same day, the most horrible thing happened. 
<br />A very mean monster came into that warm, comfortable place I was in. 
<br />I was so scared, I began screaming, but  you never once tried to help me. 
<br />Maybe you never heard me. 
<br />The monster got closer and closer as I was screaming and screaming, 
<br />&quot;Mommy, Mommy, help me please; Mommy, help me.&quot; 
<br />Complete terror is all I felt. 
<br />I screamed and screamed until I thought I couldn't anymore. 
<br />Then the monster started ripping my arms off. 
<br />It hurt so bad; the pain I can never explain. 
<br />It didn't stop. Oh, how I begged it to stop. 
<br />I screamed in horror as it ripped my leg off. 
<br />Though I was in such complete pain, I was dying. 
<br />I knew I would never see your face or hear you say how much you love me. 
<br />I wanted to make all your tears go away. 
<br />I had so many plans to make you happy. 
<br />Now I couldn't; all my dreams were shattered. 
<br />Though I was in utter pain and horror, I felt the pain of my heart breaking, above all. 
<br />I wanted more than anything to be your daughter. 
<br />No use now, for I was dying a painful death. 
<br />I could only imagine the terrible things that they had done to you. 
<br />I wanted to tell you that I love you before I was gone, but I didn't know the words you could understand. 
<br />And soon, I no longer had the breath to say them; I was dead. 
<br />I felt myself rising. I was being carried by a huge angel into a big beautiful place. 
<br />I was still crying, but the physical pain was gone. 
<br />The angel took me to God and set me on His lap. 
<br />He said He loved me, and He was my Father. Then I was happy. I asked Him what the thing was that killed me. He answered, &quot;Abortion. 
<br />I am sorry, my child; for I know how it feels.&quot; 
<br />I don't know what abortion is; 
<br />I guess that's the name of the monster. 
<br /><br />I'm writing to say that I love you and to tell you how much I wanted to be your little boy. 
<br />I tried very hard to live. 
<br />I wanted to live. I had the will, but I couldn't; the monster was too powerful. 
<br />It sucked my arms and legs off and finally got all of me. It was impossible to live. 
<br />I just wanted you to know I tried to stay with you. 
<br />I didn't want to die. 
<br /><br />Also, Mommy, please watch out for that abortion monster. 
<br />Mommy, I love you and I would hate for you to go through the kind of pain I did. 
<br /><br />Please be careful. 
<br /><br />Love, 
<br /><br />Your Baby Boy

<br /><br />Effective January 2006 
<br /><br />Dress Code 
<br /><br />1. It is advised that you come to work dressed according to your salary. If we see you wearing Prada shoes and carrying a Gucci bag, we assume you are doing well financially and therefore do not need a pay raise. 
<br /><br />2. If you dress poorly, you need to learn to manage your money better, so that you may buy nicer clothes, and therefore you do not need a pay raise. 
<br /><br />3. If you dress just right, you are right where you need to be and therefore you do not need a pay raise. 
<br /><br />Sick Days 
<br /><br />We will no longer accept a doctor's certificate as proof of sickness. 
<br /><br />If you are able to go to the doctor, you are able to come to work. 
<br /><br />Holiday Days 
<br /><br />Each employee will receive 104 personal days a year. They are called Saturday &amp; Sunday. 
<br /><br />Compassionate Leave 
<br /><br />This is no excuse for missing work. There is nothing you can do for dead friends, relatives or co-workers. Every effort should be made to have non-employees attend to the arrangements. 
<br /><br />In rare cases where employee involvement is necessary, the funeral should be scheduled in the late afternoon. We will be glad to allow you to work through your lunch hour and subsequently leave one hour early. 
<br /><br />Toilet Use 
<br /><br />1. Entirely too much time is being spent in the toilet. There is now a strict three-minute time limit in the cubicles. 
<br /><br />2. At the end of three minutes, an alarm will sound, the toilet paper roll will retract, the cubicle door will open, and your picture will be taken. 
<br /><br />3. After your second offence, your picture will be posted on the company notice board under the &quot;Chronic Offenders&quot; category. 
<br /><br />4. Anyone caught smiling in the picture will be sanctioned under the company's mental health policy. 
<br /><br />Lunch Break 
<br /><br />1. Skinny people get 30 minutes for lunch, as they need to eat more so that they can look healthy. 
<br /><br />2. Normal size people get 15 minutes for lunch to get a balanced meal to maintain their average figure. 
<br /><br />3. Chubby people get 5 minutes for lunch, because that's all the time needed to drink a Slim-Fast. 
<br /><br />Thank you for your loyalty to our company. Remember we are an employer of choice and we are here to provide a positive employment experience. 
<br /><br />Therefore, all questions, comments, concerns, complaints, frustrations, irritations, aggravations, insinuations, allegations, accusations, contemplations, consternation and input should be directed elsewhere.

<br />(this is not a joke)
<br /><br />For those who like to drink cold water, this article is applicable to you. 
<br />It is nice to have a cup of cold drink after a meal. 
<br />However, the cold water will solidify the oily stuff that you have just consumed. 
<br />It will slow down the digestion. 
<br /><br />Once this &quot;sludge&quot; reacted with the acid, it will break down and be absorbed by the intestine faster than the solid food. 
<br />It will line the intestine. 
<br /><br />Very soon, this will turn into fats and lead to cancer. 
<br />It is best to drink hot soup or warm water after a meal. 
<br /><br />A Serious note about Heart Attacks 
<br /><br />HEART ATTACK PROCEDURE&quot;: (THIS IS NOT A JOKE!)
<br /><br />Women should know that not every heart attack symptom is going to be the left arm hurting.
<br />Be aware of intense pain in the jaw line. 
<br />You may never have the first chest pain during the course of a heart attack. 
<br />Nausea and intense sweating are also common symptoms. 
<br />60% of people who have a heart attack while they are asleep do not wake up.
<br />Pain in the jaw can wake you from a sound sleep.
<br />Let's be careful and be aware. 
<br />The more we know, the better chance we could survive...
<br /><br />A cardiologist says if everyone who gets this mail sends it to 10   
<br />people, you can be sure that we'll save at least one life. 
<br />Read this.....  It could save your life!!
<br /><br />Let's say it's 6.15 pm and you're driving home .
<br /><br />Suddenly you start experiencing severe pain in your chest that starts to radiate out
<br />into your arm and up into your jaw.
<br />You are only about five miles from the hospital nearest your home.
<br />Unfortunately you don't know if you'll be able to make it that far. 
<br />You have been trained in CPR, but the guy that taught the course did not tell you
<br />how to perform it on yourself.
<br /><br />&quot;HOW TO SURVIVE A HEART ATTACK WHEN ALONE&quot;:
<br /><br />Since many people are alone when they suffer a heart attack, without help, 
<br />the person whose heart is beating
<br />improperly and who begins to feel faint, 
<br />has only about 10 seconds left before losing consciousness.
<br />However, these victims can help themselves by coughing repeatedly and very vigorously.
<br />A deep breath should be taken before each cough,
<br />deep and prolonged, as when producing sputum from deep inside the chest.
<br />A breath and a cough must be repeated about every two seconds
<br />without let-up until help arrives, or until the heart is felt to be beating normally again.
<br />Deep breaths get oxygen into the lungs and coughing movements squeeze
<br />the heart and keep the blood circulating The squeezing pressure on the heart
<br />also helps it regain normal rhythm.
<br />In this way, heart attack victims can get to a hospital. Tell as many
<br />other people as possible about this. 
<br />It could save their lives!! &quot;

It reminds us of the controversial debate on gun control, which partly revolves around the ironical dilemma that the availablity of firearms meant for increasing security also decreases security. Perhaps, they shouldn't be made easily available in the first place? Taking one step back, perhaps they shouldn't be invented in the first place? The Buddha did rule occupations related to trade in weaponry as wrong livelihood - because to deal with instruments of death or injury is supports harm of sentient beings. Weapons might be needed for defense, but if we cultivate more loving-kindness and understanding instead, we will be able to do away with the insatiable craving for more advanced ways of hurting one another. In paradisical worlds or Pure Lands shaped by Buddhas' Compassion and Wisdom, weapons are absent because craving, hatred and fear that demands these instruments do not exist.
<br /><br />A teacher held a class discussion on the above. He &quot;shot&quot; some students. In response, a student &quot;shoots&quot; him. Violence might seem the fastest way to curb violence, but it is also the fastest way to inspire more shooting. The Buddha discouraged violent retailation, as &quot;Hatred cannot be ceased by hatred; hatred can only be ceased by love.&quot; Will the world be more safe or dangerous if all carry guns as cowboys did? Now that guns are common, are more guns needed as &quot;necessary evils&quot; to guard against &quot;unnecessary evils&quot; from more guns? Will this vicious cycle spin out of control? Or is &quot;gun control&quot; already out of control? Is the point of no return crossed with no U-turn? Perhaps real gun control is to decrease purchase of guns, thus ending demand for its supply. In this sense, not buying guns is non-intuitively safer in the long run for all. Some might not agree, but those who do can grow in number. We &quot;control&quot; gun control because there's no gun pointing at us to buy guns. We need more mass-radiation of loving-kindness, less weapons of &quot;mass&quot; destruction.
<br /><br />Since guns were invented (and are being constantly reinvented), it is inevitable that there will be gun trouble. Since they are made easily available, there will naturally be even more gun trouble. What are the odds that guns are used to skilfully save lives, versus to kill in fits of anger or panic? Perhaps right gun control is not so much control of guns, but control of the minds that operate the guns. The line between offense and defense is blur, more so with blur mindfulness. There are too many cases of gun accidents and hate-shootings. The gunman killed himself after killing others. Personal unhappiness and trigger-happiness make a deadly combination for one and all. Described as a loner who kept much of his resentment for the world to himself, he (and his victims) could had been saved by loving-kindness. If only those who noticed his troubledness reached him with greater concern. If only he noticed his troubles and reached for help. Is it society's fault, or his? Both perhaps?

To resent being burnt while touching fire or when touched by it is surely plain stupidity. As Stonepeace put it, &quot;Being angry with the immature is immature. Being angry with our immaturity is also immature.&quot; Looking back, virtually all in my life so far, whom I thought ever held personal grudges against me happen to have similar attitudes toward many others. This means I don't really have &quot;personal enemies&quot; - it's not personal; they are just being their &quot;usual&quot; selves. Thus, there's no need to take so-called &quot;enemies&quot; personally. Responding with understanding that our &quot;enemies&quot; are suffering from resentment is both kinder and wiser to them and to us. Of course, our karma conditions our encounters with problematic people in our lives, but we choose how to respond, thus changing our karma. To take enmity personally &quot;feeds fuel to the fire&quot; of negative karmic affinity. Taking it graciously with forgiveness helps to cool and extinguish the flames. 
<br /><br />Here's an example of mutual fanning of a fire... Two persons brush against each other accidentally in a crowd, thus stirring up the &quot;instant karma&quot; of ill-will in each other. They might glare at each other with burning rage, each expecting an apology from the other. A fight might even break out. But the truth is, both were just following their nature of unmindfulness - which caused the unhappiness, which also resulted from unmindfulness. It's really nothing personal - even if both take it extremely personally. There's no substantial &quot;self&quot; anyway, much less any &quot;personal&quot; enemies. &quot;Self&quot; is an illusion conjured by the aggregation of changing forms, feelings, perceptions, intentions and consciousness. As a common urge to dissolve tension goes - &quot;Hey, no hard feelings!&quot; Indeed, no feelings stay hard and fast since we constantly change mentally. To &quot;hold&quot; fast to ill-will instead of letting it go is unhealthy because it sustains hate, that eats you away by generating ill feelings repeatedly. It's self-defeating.
<br /><br />We should not bear any grudge against those who harm us, but have great compassion for them instead - because they eventually cause suffering for themselves through their constant &quot;burning&quot; of others around them. This sustains problems in their relationships while creating new problems. Those who burn others with hatred first burn themselves by harming their own peace of mind. Just as such emotional disturbances harm them needlessly, there is no need to let their disturbances harm your peace of mind. If you come across anyone who might be nursing a grudge against you, why not forward them this article to share? Of course, to prevent more ill feelings from arising, it would be gentlemanly to remark thus - &quot;Hi, here's something interesting to share. Sincerely hope you'll find it useful. If I'd ever been a 'fire' that burnt you purposely or accidentally, please forgive me. Please let me know my mistakes too.&quot; Sending this helps to &quot;burn&quot; your pridefulness away too. - Shen Shi'an (Inspired by Kinox)

<br />we can only treasure everything in this moment.
<br />Because everything changes from moment to moment,
<br />we should not be attached to anything in this moment. - stonepeace
<br /><br />The work of acknowledging everything in mindfulness leads us to a deeper view of what life is. It is very important to understand that impermanence is not a negative aspect of life. Impermanence is is the very basis of life. If what exists were not impermanent, no life could continue. If a grain of corn were not impermanent, it could not become a corn plant. If a tiny child were not impermanent, she could not grow into an adult.
<br /><br />Life is impermanent, but that does not mean it it not worth living. It is precisely because of its impermanece that we value life so dearly. Therefore we must know how to live each moment deeply and use it in a responsible way. If we are able to live the present moment completely, we will not feel regret later. We will know how to care for those who are close to us and know how to bring them happiness. When we accept that all things are impermanent, we will not be incapacitated by suffering when things decay and die. We can remain peaceful and content in the face of change, prosperity and decline, success and failure.
