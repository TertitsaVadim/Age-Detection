Only a few of these problems are widely grown by farmers in the house for medical purposes. Illegal cultivation of marijuana has their favorite wild and the large number of strains received little attention in the general population.
<br /><br />For thousands of years hemp was cultivated by the indigenous peoples of the world. They used this plant non-toxic smoke because it makes them feel good - a sort of panacea for something that hurts. They ate the seeds, because they taste good and helped fill their food, sometimes thin.
<br /><br />They have learned to break the long stocks and fiber - with baskets and other handicrafts. Today we have two main uses of <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy50aGNzdXBwb3J0LmNvbS8_" target="_blank"><strong>medicinal marijuana</strong></a> - medicine and relaxation, - and both are legal in some states of America.
<br /><br />Different strains of marijuana smokers are used for the pleasure of relaxation, such as kush marijuana and purple marijuana are all in the cannabis family, which consists of three families of marijuana:
<br /><br /><strong>* Cannabis Ruderalis</strong>
<br /><strong>* Cannabis Sativa</strong>
<br /><strong>* Cannabis Indica</strong>
<br /><br />That is derived from hemp has been called the <strong>Cannabis Ruderalis</strong>, and went wild last 50-70 years of neglect. It 'was decaying plant hemp was raised in the old days when millions of America.
<br /><br />Ruderalis Sativa hemp fields used - and when he stopped growing commercial treaties, Sativa died over the years - but Ruderalis changed into a ditch weed and survived as a wild grass.
<br /><br />Cannabis sativa and Cannabis indica are the other two families of cannabis from which all strains are - and in recent years has been used Ruderalis successful return Sativa or Indica.
<br /><br />For example, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy50aGNzdXBwb3J0LmNvbS9tZWRpY2FsLW1hcmlqdWFuYS1zdGF0ZXMvY2FsaWZvcm5pYS1sYXdzLmFzcHg_" target="_blank"><strong>California medical marijuana</strong></a> is a mostly sativa variety imported for sale on the black market. This is not considered one of the best strains of medical marijuana, but it's better than a lot of new strains. It's probably best for medical purposes, for patients suffering from terminal pain.
<br /><br />Types of marijuana increased in number over the last 50 years or more. All these new strains were developed by private persons in illegal conditions, a more potent strain. The use was mainly social - but in the process of this violation of the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy50aGNzdXBwb3J0LmNvbS9tZWRpY2FsLW1hcmlqdWFuYS1zdGF0ZXMvTWFyaWp1YW5hU3RhdGVMYXdzLmFzcHg_" target="_blank"><strong>medical marijuana laws</strong></a>, has some medical uses have been developed.
<br /><br />And 'known for years that certain diseases are best helped by a strain more than others. This has inspired the development of even higher rates than necessary. Some of the results are the following positions:
<br /><br />-&gt; <strong>Afghani # 1</strong> is a powerful, easy to grow plant that grows in bloom in 45 days. It is recommended for chronic pain and muscle spasms.
<br /><br />-&gt; <strong>Apollo 11</strong> will grow to flowering stage in 45 to 55 days. It is used for epilepsy and multiple sclerosis.
<br /><br />-&gt; <strong>Northern Lights # 5</strong> is a high performance plants, flowers in about 45 to 55 days, good resistance, short, thick and easy to grow. A perfect plant for indoor growing. Stimulants used for anti-nausea, anti-emetic and appetite.
