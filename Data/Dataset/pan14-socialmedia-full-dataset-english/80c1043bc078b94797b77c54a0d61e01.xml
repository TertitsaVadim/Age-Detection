Your best days are never so good that you are beyond the need of God’s grace. Your worst days are never so bad that you are beyond the reach of God’s grace. A man never discloses his own character so clearly as when he describes another’s. here is so much good in the worst of us, and so much bad in the best of us, that it behoves all of us not to talk about the rest of us. Every person I have known who has been truly happy, has learned how to serve others. God did not promise days without pain; laughter without sorrow; sun without rain. But He did promise strength for the day, comfort for the tears; and light for our way. When God drops needles and pins along your path in life, don't avoid them. Pick them up and collect them. They were designed to teach you to be stronger. God will never leave you empty. He will replace everything you lost. If He asks you to put something down, it's because He wants you to pick up something greater. Remember, Even if I can't see you, don't worry God will always be there for you. Take care Dear friend,, God bless

Nor do they light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on a lampstand, and it gives light to all who are in the house.  Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father in heaven.&quot; Is anybody happier because you passed his way? Does anyone remember that you spoke to him today? The day is almost over and its toiling time is through; Is there anyone to utter now a kindly word of you? Did you give a cheerful greeting to the friend who came along, Or a churlish sort of &quot;Howdy&quot;; then vanish in the throng? Were you selfish, pure and simple, as you rushed along your way, Or is someone mighty grateful for a deed you did today? Can you say tonight, in parting with the day that's slipping fast, That you helped a single brother of the many that you passed? Is a single heart rejoicing over what you did or said? Does the man whose hopes were fading now with courage look ahead? Did you waste the day or lose it, was it well or poorly spent? Did you leave a trail of kindness, or a scar of discontent? As you close your eyes in slumber, do you think that God would say, &quot;You have earned one more tomorrow by the work you did today?&quot; Life is good when somebody remembers. Life is uplifting when someone is always there. Life is great when someone would protect you and suffer. Cherish life because someone always cares. JESUS CARES. God bless

Material abundance without character is the surest way to destruction. A true friend is one who overlooks your failures and tolerates your successes. I have learnt silence from the talkative, toleration from the intolerant, and kindness from the unkind; yet strange, I am ungrateful to these teachers. Lord, make me an instrument of Your peace. Where there is hatred let me sow love; where there is injury, pardon; where there is despair, hope; where there is darkness, light; and where there is sadness, joy. Adversity, if for no other reason, is of benefit, since it is sure to bring a season of sober reflection. Men see clearer at such times. Storms purify the atmosphere. Man is not what he thinks he is, he is what he hides. Let us adore Jesus in our hearts, who spent thirty years out of thirty-three in silence; who began his public life by spending forty days in silence; who often retired alone to spend the night on a mountain in silence. He who spoke with authority, now spends his earthly life in silence. How often does God ask us to step into the water before He will part it? Many times that’s all He is waiting for – for you and me to get our feet wet. Every man has a train of thought on which he rides when he is alone. The dignity and nobility of his life, as well as his happiness, depend upon the direction in which that train is going, the baggage it carries, and the scenery through which it travels. God comes into our lives to take them over, not to make us feel good. Sin is avoidable or at times inevitable but not necessary. Christ nailed our sins to the cross so that we might live for God. May God give you a caring heart so that you can become a whole person, not just gifted with intellect that can understand, but with heart that truly cares and loves. God bless

Fear is keeping things in your own hands; faith is turning them over into the hands of God. Don't bother much about your feelings.  When they are humble, loving, brave, give thanks for them; when they are conceited, selfish, cowardly, ask to have them altered.  In neither case are they you, but only a thing that happens to you.  What matters is your intentions and your behaviour. Many a friendship- long, loyal, and self-sacrificing- rested at first upon no thicker a foundation than a kind word. Nothing transcends the power of God.  Whether our difficulty is from Satan, others, self-inflicted, or experienced in the process of our obedience, it is God's prerogative to rearrange, reconstruct, reinterpret, and realign the situation to bring glory and praise to His name. For the eyes of the LORD range throughout the earth to strengthen those whose hearts are fully committed to him. A little girl whose baby brother had just died asked her mother where baby had gone.  &quot;To be with Jesus,&quot; replied the mother.  A few days later, talking to a friend, the mother said, &quot;I am so grieved to have lost my baby.&quot;  The little girl heard her, and, remembering what her mother had told her, looked up into her face and asked, &quot;Mother, is a thing lost when you know where it is?&quot;  &quot;No, of course not.&quot;  &quot;Well, then, how can baby be lost when he has gone to be with Jesus?&quot;  Her mother never forgot this.  It was the truth. Remember, In the ocean of life, God is our buoyant force. No matter how strong the wind and how gigantic the waves are, we will not sink because we are anchored to Him. Don't let little things get you down. You've got many big reasons to look up to God and say thanks. It's going to be a great day. God bless

There are two ways of spreading light- to be the candle or the mirror that reflects it. But those who trust in the LORD will find new strength.  They will soar high on wings like eagles.  They will run and not grow weary.  They will walk and not faint. I know God will not give me anything I can't handle. I just wish that He didn't trust me so much. If you believe in a God who controls the big things, you have to believe in a God who controls the little things.  It is we, of course, to whom things look &quot;little&quot; or &quot;big.&quot; God wants to speak into areas of your life you have never even considered.  He wants to give you words and wisdom you didn't think were possible.  He desires to do exceedingly more than you can hope or expect. but in your hearts honour Christ the Lord as holy, always being prepared to make a defense to anyone who asks you for a reason for the hope that is in you; yet do it with gentleness and respect. May the love of God always shine in your life, as you become a light for others. Have a pleasant day. God bless.

But those who trust in the LORD will find new strength. They will soar high on wings like eagles. They will run and not grow weary They will walk and not faint. The whole point of this life is the healing of the heart's eye through which God is seen. For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord. God wants to speak into areas of your life you have never even considered. He wants to give you words and wisdom you didn't think were possible. He desires to do exceedingly more than you can hope or expect. But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities; upon him was the chastisement that made us whole, and with his stripes we are healed. Never tolerate the idea of martyrdom about the cross of Jesus Christ. The cross was a superb triumph in which the foundations of hell were shaken. There is nothing more certain in time or eternity than what Jesus Christ did on the cross: He switched the whole of the human race back into a right relationship with God. Christ has turned all our sunsets into dawns. God, give us grace to accept with serenity the things that cannot be changed, courage to change the things which should be changed, and the wisdom to distinguish the one from the other. A smile takes but a moment, but its effects sometimes last forever. A special breakfast for you today: a plate of love, a bowl of peace, a spoon of hope, a fork of care, and a glass of prayer. Enjoy your meal for you are under God's care. God Bless

To be glad of life, because it gives you the chance to love and to work and to play and to look up at the stars; to be satisfied with your possessions, but not contented with yourself until you have made the best of them; to despise nothing in the world except falsehood and meanness, and to fear nothing except cowardice; to be governed by your admirations rather than by your disgusts; to covet nothing that is your neighbour’s except his kindness of heart and gentleness of manners; to think seldom of your enemies, often of your friends, and every day of Christ; and to spend as much time as you can, with body and with spirit, in God’s out-of-doors- these are little guideposts on the footpath to peace   And if you will obey my commandments which I command you this day, to forgive others who offended you, to love the LORD your God, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul, he will give the rain for your land in its season, the early rain and the later rain, that you may gather in your grain and your wine and your oil. And he will give grass in your fields for your cattle, and you shall eat and be full. I command Angels from on high to encamp around you today as you navigate your world. Remember, Trusting God won't make the mountain smaller but it will make climbing easier. Hope you will be able to climb all your mountains today and every day. Have a great day ahead. God bless.

Many a fellow is praying for rain with his tub the wrong side up. Christ has turned all our sunsets into dawns. Jesus, please teach me to appreciate what I have before time forces me to appreciate what I had. As a knot appears unexpectedly in a thread, so disappointment blocks the smoothness of life. If a few deft strokes can untangle the skein, life continues evenly; but if it cannot be corrected, then it must be quietly woven into the design. Thus the finished piece can still be beautiful- though not as perfect as planned. How true it is, and how I long that everyone should know it, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners- and I was the greatest of them all. But God had mercy on me so that Christ Jesus could use me as an example to show everyone how patient he is with even the worst sinners, so that others will realise that they, too, can have everlasting life. Glory and honour to God forever and ever. He is the King of the ages, the unseen one who never dies; he alone is God, and full of wisdom. In the ocean of life, God is our buoyant force. No matter how strong the wind and how gigantic the waves are, we will not sink because we are anchored to Him.&quot; Valuing a person is not merely seeing each other everyday. What counts most is that somehow in our busy life, we remember each other even just by saying &quot;Take care&quot;. And God bless. Good morning dear friend

And again we see, the intensity of their power really to forgive is in exact proportion to the degree that they have permitted themselves to be forgiven and so brought back to God. With the goodness of God to desire our highest welfare, the wisdom of God to plan it, and the power of God to achieve it, what do we lack?. To love what is below the human is degradation; to love what is human for the sake of the human is mediocrity; to love the human for the sake of the Divine is enriching; to love the Divine for its own sake is sanctity. You have been created by God and for God, and someday you will stand amazed at the simple yet profound ways He has used you even when you weren't aware of it. Is anybody happier because you passed his way? Does anyone remember that you spoke to him today? The day is almost over and its toiling time is through; Is there anyone to utter now a kindly word of you? Did you give a cheerful greeting to the friend who came along, Or a churlish sort of &quot;Howdy&quot;; then vanish in the throng? Were you selfish, pure and simple, as you rushed along your way, Or is someone mighty grateful for a deed you did today?

And we know that for those who love God all things work together for good, for those who are called according to his purpose. Many persons have a wrong idea of what constitutes real happiness.  It is not obtained through self-gratification, but through fidelity to a worthy purpose. If your Christianity doesn't work at home, then it doesn't work at all.  So don't export it. Faith is knowing that God is who He says He is, has what He says He has and will do what He says He will do and then putting ourselves in a position where our lives depend on it.  The good man brings good things out of the good stored up in his heart, and the evil man brings evil things out of the evil stored up in his heart.  For out of the overflow of his heart his mouth speaks. God said don't look around because you'll be impressed. Don't look down you'll be depressed; just look to me all the time and you'll be blessed. The Lord is waiting above to give you His grace and send you His love. Whatever your cross, whatever the pain, God always sends a rainbow after the rain. Take care, God bless.

Many a fellow is praying for rain with his tub the wrong side up. Of all kinds of knowledge that we can ever obtain, the knowledge of God and the knowledge of ourselves are the most important. It is far more impressive when others discover your good qualities without your help. Even if you've missed God's plan entirely for years and years and years, that plan can still swing into operation the minute you're ready to step up and step in, with God at your side. If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness. Jesus said to him, &quot;I am the way, the truth, and the life.  No one comes to the Father except through Me.&quot; How great is the contrast between that forgiveness to which we lay claim from God towards us, and our temper towards others!  God, we expect, will forgive us great offences, offences many times repeated; and will forgive them freely, liberally, and from the heart.  But we are offended at our neighbour, perhaps, for the merest trifles, and for an injury only once offered; and we are but half reconciled when we deem to forgive.  Even an uncertain humour, an ambiguous word, or a suspected look, will inflame our anger; and hardly any persuasion will induce us for a long time to relent. But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. Remember, When God puts a tear in your eye, it's because He wants to put a rainbow in your heart. In God's eyes, love is never absent. In God's heart, forgiveness is never impossible. In God's embrace, no one is ever alone or forgotten.  Take care, God Bless!

		<document id="26cdbf6c54e599dec78e06ff9e05dfdd" url=""><![CDATA[love<br/><br/>To accept grace is to admit failure, a step we are hesitant to take.  We opt to impress God with how good we are rather than confessing how great he is. The Bible starts by teaching us that we, as creatures, are absolutely dependent on God, and that He, as Creator, has an absolute claim on us.  Only when we have learned this can we see what sin is, and only when we see what sin is can we understand the good news of salvation from sin. For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus. If nothing in this world satisfies me, perhaps it is because I was made for another world. A relaxed attitude lengthens a man's life; jealousy rots it away. Day by day we should weigh what we have granted to the spirit of the world against what we have denied to the spirit of Jesus, in thought and especially in deed. Speak and act as those who are going to be judged by the law that gives freedom, because judgment without mercy will be shown to anyone who has not been merciful.  Mercy triumphs over judgment! Remember, You have been created by God and for God, and someday you will stand amazed at the simple yet profound ways He has used you even when you weren't aware of it. Walk with the Lord when your heart needs company. Take His hand when you feel all alone. Turn to Him when you need someone to lean on. He's the only one you can always rely on. God can reach each falling tears. He sees the heart that needs a cheer. He knows the path that's hard and dear. Don't ever give up because He is near. Take care, Good morning, God bless.

Our whole life was only given us to advance us by great strides toward our heavenly country. If the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, he who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through his Spirit who dwells in you. Things aren't always as they appear to be on the surface. Sometimes the people who most trouble us are the ones facing trouble in their own lives. Day by day we should weigh what we have granted to the spirit of the world against what we have denied to the spirit of Jesus, in thought and especially in deed. All His glory and beauty come from within, and there He delights to dwell.  His visits there are frequent, His conversation sweet, His comforts refreshing:  His peace passing all understanding. At the profoundest depths in life men talk not about God, but with Him. He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him. When you have no helpers, see all your helpers in God. When you have many helpers, see God in all your helpers. When you have nothing but God, see all in God; when you have everything, see God in everything. Under all conditions, stay thy heart only on the Lord. Remember, God will only mend a broken heart when He is given all the pieces. Don't work too hard to give yourself the best of everything, instead make a greater effort to give God the best of yourself. God gave you a promise that you wont have to face life alone for when you grow weak in your struggles, His strength will prevail and not your own. Journey to God starts with one small step at a time. He doesn't expect you to run the mile -- but HE promises to give you strength to go the distance. Take care, happy weekend Good morning, God bless

The eye's a better pupil and more willing than the ear; Fine counsel is confusing, but  example's always  clear. And the best of all preachers are the men who live their creeds, For to see the good in action is what everybody needs. I can soon learn how to do it if you'll let me see it done; I can watch your hands in action, but your tongue too fast may run. And the lectures you deliver may be very wise and true, But I'd rather get my lesson by observing what you do. For I may misunderstand you and the high advice you give, But there's no misunderstanding how you act and how you live. For I the LORD thy God will hold thy right hand, saying unto thee, Fear not; I will help thee. If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you. Remember, The friendship of Jesus is lasting.  Other friends may grow old and cold.  It is not so with the friendship of our Savior.  Other friends may possibly misunderstand us, Jesus never.  His love is the same in youth as in old age.  The friendship will rather grow stronger in old age.  When you have lost what to you seemed everything, and you find yourself friendless and alone, despised and forsaken, rejected, crestfallen and disappointed, Jesus will be your dear and precious friend. Never a weakness that He can't fill. Never a sickness that He can't heal. Never a sorrow that He doesn't share. Moment by moment- you are under Jesus care. I ask God to make you happy, make you smile, guide you safely through every mile; grant you wealth and long life, give you health, and most of all, give you care and love you well. May the love of God always shine in your life, as you become a light for others. Have a pleasant day. Take care ,Good Morning, God bless.

Then you will understand the fear of the LORD, And find the knowledge of God.  For the LORD gives wisdom; From His mouth come knowledge and understanding; He stores up sound wisdom for the upright; He is a shield to those who walk uprightly; To love and be loved is to feel the sun from both sides. Remember, If all the gold in the world were melted down into a solid cube it would be about the size of an eight-room house.  If a man got possession of all that gold- billions of dollars' worth- he could not buy a friend, character, peace of mind, clear conscience, or a sense of eternity. The vessel of God does not “not steal does not deal falsely and cannot lie to one another.&quot; You are the light of the world.  A city that is set on a hill cannot be hidden.  Nor do they light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on a lampstand, and it gives light to all who are in the house.  Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father in heaven.&quot; The world is full of beauty when your heart is full of love. So start and end your day with love and smile in your heart. Valuing a person is not merely seeing each other every day. What counts most is that somehow in our busy life, we remember each other even just by saying &quot;Take care&quot;. When things go wrong don't go blue. Just pray and say I will get through. Always remember God Loves You! Have a peaceful day.

Then you will understand the fear of the LORD, And find the knowledge of God.  For the LORD gives wisdom; From His mouth come knowledge and understanding; He stores up sound wisdom for the upright; He is a shield to those who walk uprightly; To love and be loved is to feel the sun from both sides. Remember, If all the gold in the world were melted down into a solid cube it would be about the size of an eight-room house.  If a man got possession of all that gold- billions of dollars' worth- he could not buy a friend, character, peace of mind, clear conscience, or a sense of eternity. The vessel of God does not “not steal does not deal falsely and cannot lie to one another.&amp;amp;quot; You are the light of the world.  A city that is set on a hill cannot be hidden.  Nor do they light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on a lampstand, and it gives light to all who are in the house.  Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father in heaven.&amp;amp;quot; The world is full of beauty when your heart is full of love. So start and end your day with love and smile in your heart. Valuing a person is not merely seeing each other every day. What counts most is that somehow in our busy life, we remember each other even just by saying &amp;amp;quot;Take care&amp;amp;quot;. When things go wrong don't go blue. Just pray and say I will get through. Always remember God Loves You! Have a peaceful day.

Tie them to your hand to remind you to obey them, and tie them to your forehead between your eyes!  Teach them to your children.  Talk about them when you are sitting at home, when you are out walking, at bedtime, and before breakfast!  Write them upon the doors of your houses and upon your gates, so that as long as there is sky above the earth, you and your children will enjoy the good life awaiting you in the land the Lord has promised you. For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. To become Christ-like is the only thing in the whole world worth caring for, the thing before which every ambition of man is folly and all lower achievement vain. Those who trust in the LORD are like Mount Zion, which cannot be moved, but abides for ever. God never built a Christian strong enough to carry today's duties and tomorrow's anxieties piled on top of them. God is not a deceiver, that He should offer to support us, and then, when we lean upon Him, should slip away from us. Day by day we should weigh what we have granted to the spirit of the world against what we have denied to the spirit of Jesus, in thought and especially in deed. Speak and act as those who are going to be judged by the GOD that gives freedom, because judgment without mercy will be shown to anyone who has not been merciful.  Mercy triumphs over judgment. God sees you just exactly as you are He sees you perfectly and more truly than people can, and He loves you more than you can ever imagine. When things are not working as we expect them to be, take it as God's subtle way of teaching us to grow. The process may be difficult but it will surely bring the best out of YOU. Don't let little things get you down. You've got many big reasons to look up to God and say thanks. It's going to be a great day. Good morning my dearest friend, Take care God bless

We cannot but be right when we put all the rest away, and do everything in remembrance of Him. There can be no confusion in following Him, and seeking for no other footsteps, I am certain. For God gives to a man that is good in his sight wisdom, and knowledge, and joy, happiness, peace and prosperity. Laying his hand on the shoulder of a young monk one day, St. Francis of Assisi said:  &quot;Brother, let us go down to the town and preach.&quot;  So they went forth together.  They conversed as they went along their way.  They walked down main streets, round the lowly alleys and lanes, on to the edge of the village beyond.  Finally they turned back, and entered the monastery again.  In surprise, the young man asked, &quot;Father, when shall we begin to preach?&quot;  St. Francis looked kindly upon the young man and said:  &quot;My child, we have been preaching; we were preaching while we were walking.  We have been seen- looked at; our behaviour has been remarked; and so we have delivered a morning's sermon.  Ah! my son, it is of no use that we walk anywhere to preach unless we preach as we walk.&quot; Let your life and the light in you shine forth and touch lives, affect people, give hope to those who are about to quit that quitters never win. Before you can give light to another person, you must carry the light. Remember, it is what you have inside you that you can give another. DO YOU HAVE JESUS IN YOU. HE IS THE WAY THE TRUTH AND THE LIFE. HE IS THE DOOR TO GOD. Jesus asked me how much I love Him so I spread my arms and said &quot;This much&quot;. I asked God how much He loves me. He spread his arms and said &quot;This is how I died for you.&quot; I've known you before you knew me. I tried to get your attention, but you're so busy. I want you to give all and make you mine. I proved my love when I gave you my life. [JESUS] One missed call, no one answered. Missed 1: Jesus. But He will never stop calling, no matter how many times you missed His calls… till you hear and answer. Jesus Loves You. Wherever you go, whatever you do, no matter how far or how long, Jesus Christ will always be there for you. Never a weakness that He can't fill. Never a sickness that He can't heal. Never a sorrow that He doesn't share. Moment by moment- you are under Jesus care. When earthly help is no avail, there's one friend who will never fail. Just lift your eyes, the answer is there. For nobody knows the power of prayer. Have a worry free day. Take care my DEAR Friend God Bless

In this world, Be guided, only by the healer of the sick, the raiser of the dead, the friend of all who were afflicted and forlorn, the patient Master who shed tears of compassion for our infirmities.  We cannot but be right when we put all the rest away, and do everything in remembrance of Him...There can be no confusion in following Him, and seeking for no other footsteps, I am certain. Build your nest in no tree here...for the Lord of the forest has condemned the whole woods to be demolished. Who will tell whether one happy moment of love, or the joy of breathing or walking on a bright morning and smelling the fresh air, is not worth all the suffering and effort which life implies? When God is about to do something great, he starts with a difficulty. When he is about to do something truly magnificent, he starts with an impossibility. If someone listens, or stretches out a hand, or whispers a kind word of encouragement, or attempts to understand a lonely person, extraordinary things begin to happen. When you come to Christ, the Holy Spirit takes up residence in your heart. Something new is added to your life supernaturally. You are transformed by the renewing of your mind. A new power, a new dimension, a new ability to love, a new joy, a new peace – the Holy Spirit comes in and lives the Christian life through you. If you want happiness for an hour, take a nap. If you want happiness for a day, go fishing. If you want happiness for a year, inherit a fortune. If you want happiness for a lifetime, help somebody. Like the rain can't be stopped from falling, God's love and blessing keep on pouring. I hope you woke up renewed and refreshed and comforted by His company. May the love of God always shine in your life, as you become a light for others. New day, new blessings. Don't let yesterday's failures ruin the beauty of today. Blessings of God are new every morning. Today has its own promise of love, forgiveness, joy and success. Take care, Have a pleasant day. God bless.
