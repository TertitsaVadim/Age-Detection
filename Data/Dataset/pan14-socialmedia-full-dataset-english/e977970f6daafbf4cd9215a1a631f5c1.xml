<br />You’re something to die for
<br />But don’t hold your breath now
<br />You’re just killing time
<br />Tonight you can dream boy
<br />Imagine a whisper
<br />If you can keep secrets
<br />Then I’ll tell you mine.
<br /><br />Remember a promise you couldn’t hold on to
<br />Though it brings me to tears now i need you to know
<br />Look in my eyes boy
<br />Nothing like yours now
<br />It seems that a lifetime
<br />Is passing us by.
<br /><br />So open your eyes...
<br /><br />This is forever but it won’t last long
<br />This is a memory that fades away in neverending
<br />In the death of all that’s long been said and done before,
<br />We’ll wish that we were something more.
<br /><br />Stop wasting time boy
<br />You’re late all your life boy
<br />They won’t have the patience
<br />For someone like you
<br />Your memory’s fading
<br />I’ll love you forever
<br />I’ll try to remember
<br />I’ll try to hold on
<br /><br />You’re standing alone boy
<br />Waiting for dreams boy
<br />Waiting for something
<br />To make them come true
<br />Don’t ever leave boy
<br />I’d miss you too much boy
<br />I’ll never forget you
<br />As long as I’m here

I'm beginning to be able to do the Medium difficulty songs, and I've only been playing for a month, or a little over two. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/w00t.gif" alt=":)" /> Then, Thursday, I've got an amazing Rave to go to. I'm not sure if I should buy Kandy in advance. Hmm. &gt;&gt; Anyways, I'm pretty excited about this week. ^^

<br /><br />We pray for our sorrows to end
<br />And hope that our hearts will blend
<br />Now I will step forward to realize this wish-
<br /><br />And who knows
<br />Starting a new journey may not be so hard
<br />Or maybe it's already begun-
<br /><br />There are many worlds
<br />But they share the same sky
<br />One sky... 
<br />One destiny-
<br /><br />This was a letter from Kairi to Sora off of Kingdom Hearts II.

Why is it that I have the best days, but the saddest nights? I sit here, moping and even sometimes crying from the point of utter loneliness...What did I do to deserve such a lonesome fate? But I have to realize, even through years of being alone, whether in school, or at home, that I'm going to alone throughout my entire life...And there's nothing I can do to change that. A person really doesn't know how to think, feel, and care when they've been alone for as long as I have...Maybe I'm just being over emotional. Who knows.  V_V

Is it my appearance? Is it my morbidity? Do I talk too much? What is it about me that repels people?!

Exciting. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/dry.gif" alt=":)" /> My friend started saying the DJ Unk is Techno just because it has the word DJ. No. That's not true. DJ Unk is Rap. And amazing. &lt;3 I don't get why people constantly try to fight me when I know I'm right. And to those who try to say, &quot;Techno and Rap are almost the same thing&quot; are almost correct. Techno is made up of different beats and loops, while Rap has it's own. I have nothing against Rap, it's just there really is not very many similarities. Another thing we were arguing about was that Happy Hardcore is an artist, not a genre. No, again. Happy Hardcore is somewhat of a genre, since it really wasn't even allowed to exist. A lot of different music companies wouldn't accept it for it's music, so it entirely became it's own movement. And it's made up of MANY artists. But anyways, I'm done with my ranting. ^-^

It was perfection. Haven't been to one in a while, so it was fucking sweet to finally go back to my kind of scene.

What the Hell is wrong with people nowadays?  Is this the Whiney Era? STOP whining. As I read these fucking blogs, I'm either developing major stupidity, or I end up being very pissed off by all the bitching. I have nothing against &quot;Emo Kids&quot;, but merely the ignorant motherfuckers who don't care about anything but getting some attention, or just craving for somebody to talk to. Talk to somebody well worth your time, not some other idiot. Oh, and if you feel like doing nothing but posting stupid shit on one of my blogs, GO KILL YOURSELF. Please. You are not on this site to piss people off, or to torment somebody because they aren't good enough for your standards. Get over it if you don't like somebody because they don't like the same music, or if they dress different from how you dress. By the way, I'm really getting tired of all the people who whine because they broke up or were broken up with their boyfriend/girlfriend. Sad music doesn't help much either. If you are sad or having a bad day, pathetic whiney music does NOT help. Listen to something that will cheer you up. As quoted by Foamy, &quot;I also can't stand people who sit at home and listen to every rose has it's thorn like it's the world's most depressing song. One, the song sucks. Two, you're fucking pathetic for listening to it. Take the CD out, crack it in half, and then slit your wrist with the broken pieces. It's over. They're done. You're done. Kill yourself.&quot; Thank you to all who have either read this or didn't put some fucking comment that was a waste of your time. You are worthless if you decide to put something pointless. Nobody thinks you are funny just because you can call me a &quot;fukin pusy&quot; or use a few adult words. Anyway, thanks for listening.

I'm tired of spending countless nights, either crying myself to sleep, or days in which I rot alone. School isn't an option anymore, especially with practically everyone at my last school strongly disliking me for difference. I'm far too shy to actually walk out into nameless areas and just make friends...So, what really is there to do? I haven't left my house in almost five days. I need a life, but for someone like me, there's no point to trying...My trust level is out the window, and I highly doubt that anyone's coming to my rescue...Staring down this screen is constant, my only way of living. So, in closing, feel free to call me &quot;Emo&quot;, or whatever words you feel need to be said...But as I had said already, this is to simply get weight off of my shoulders.

<br />A secrecy dedicated entirely to malevolency and malice.
<br />The graveolent cadavers putrefact beneath the basking tongue of flames.
<br />A depraved youth strides to the fatid conservatory to which he was devoured into the womb.
<br />A flourishing blossom of the dusk emits it's existence into factual enticement.
<br />The seducement of a beloved catalyst is calamitous and tragic amidst the defiled and tainted.
