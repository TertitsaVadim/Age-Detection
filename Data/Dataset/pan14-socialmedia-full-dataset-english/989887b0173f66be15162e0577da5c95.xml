As a party planner, it can be really hard to make a party more unique than the other. How was I supposed to make two separate birthday parties different from the other if both children like Spider-Man and wanted a completely Spidey-decorated party? Yes, these are just some of the dilemmas I encounter, as a party planner.
<br /><br />However, no matter what we provide to these kids, surely they’ll love it because the only thing they’re really looking for is a day of fun. I have to remind myself this, every time I get too wrapped up in planning a party.
<br /><br />But, while I plan parties, in order to make each party a little unique, I list down some aspects that I can change depending on the celebrant’s wishes.

Well, I do. And it took me quite awhile before settling on someone and trusting them with business.
<br /><br />As a party planner, I like a little variety in the parties I plan. I like to give each of my customers something they’ll remember for years to come and since food is an integral part of a party, I thought it was only right I provide <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3ZpY3RvcmlhdnluZXMucG9zdGVyb3VzLmNvbS9ob3ctdG8tZmluZC10aGUtcGVyZmVjdC1tYW51ZmFjdHVyZXItZm9yLXlvdXIj" target="_blank">customized napkins</a> as well, after all, nothing like some napkins to remember the day by.

I don’t like to forget things while planning a party so I prefer to keep a complete list of my requirements and ideas just so I can check it off when the time comes before the party to start.
<br /><br />Here are three essential lists I make before the start of a party:
<br /><br />First, you need to add the details of food. This includes the types of food that should have arrived, the types of desserts, the table settings, the designs and prints of <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jdXBkZXBvdC5jb20vY3VzdG9tLWJldmVyYWdlLW5hcGtpbnMuaHRtbA__" target="_blank">custom beverage napkins</a>, the setting of the dining area when the party has started.

<br /><br />Have you been in the Philippines? Philippines like the other Asian countries offers a diverse culture, values and of course food. Since Philippines was once under the Spanish colonialism, Japanese invasion and once became a military base from Americans I can say that Filipinos offers a very wide array of things.

<br /><br />Filipinos are known for their outmost hospitality, friendliness and savory foods. This time, I’ll offer you something that we enjoy the most, it’s another street food but not the “Quek quek” or the quail eggs wrapped in orange floor mixture then deep friend, its already a cliché since almost all blogs have posted its recipe. This time it’s the Okoy or Shrimps and Bean Sprouts Fritters.
