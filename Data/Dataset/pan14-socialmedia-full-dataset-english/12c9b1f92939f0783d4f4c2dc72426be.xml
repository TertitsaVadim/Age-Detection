This is not mentioned in any of the Wrath of the Lich King gold guides, but it's a good way to get extra gold to cover your repairs and to buy food and water.<br /><br />2.

Most people don't realize that this is a gold mine. Any WotLK gold guide or WoW gold guide will mention these techniques. The trick to using the auction house is MASTERING it.
