<br />&gt; YOUR CALENDAR, IN YOUR CELL PHONE, ON YOUR LAPTOP or WHEREVER YOU CAN
<br />&gt; AND WILL BE REMINDED!!!!!
<br />&gt; ...in April 1997, there was a &quot;gas out&quot; conducted nationwide in protest
<br />&gt; of gas prices. Gasoline prices dropped 30 cents a gallon overnight.
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt; On May 15th 2007, all internet users are to not go to a gas station in
<br />&gt; protest of high gas prices. Gas is now over $3.00 a gallon in most
<br />&gt; places.
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt; There are 73,000,000+ American members currently on the internet
<br />&gt; network, and the average car takes about 30 to 50 dollars to fill up.
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt; If all users did not go to the pump on the 15th, it would take
<br />&gt; $2,292,000,000.00 (that's almost 3 BILLION) out of the oil companies
<br />&gt; pockets for just one day, so please do not go to the gas station on May
<br />&gt; 15th and lets try to put a dent in the Middle Eastern oil industry for
<br />&gt; at least one day.
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt; If you agree (which I cant see why you wouldn't) resend this to all
<br />&gt; your contact list. With it saying, ''Don't pump gas on May 15th&quot;
<br />&gt; KEEP THIS CLEAN!! Copy and Paste into a new message then send to your
