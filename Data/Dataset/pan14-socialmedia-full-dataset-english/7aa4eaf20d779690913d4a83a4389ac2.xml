Because men designed them for their pleasure. Because they make us look taller; because they make our butt muscles tighten and so we think our fanny looks better; because we slowly develop stronger calf muscles; because it's something women can do really well and most men don't even want to try; because we always have a secret weapon handy; because flat shoes make our arches ache; because designers need more material to work with and heels offer so many possibilities. <br /><br />Individuality, Femininity, Empowerment<br /><br />Those are just a few reasons why every single woman on the planet doesn't just have three pairs of shoes: a brown pair of basic sandals, a white pair of fuzzy slippers and a pair of black flat shoes for walking and working. But that's exactly the answer. Women use shoes to show individuality and femininity or strength or naturalness or a million other facets of their personalities and lifestyles. Men have one little item of great importance that makes them who they think they are, that separates them from other men, that makes them feel or look or act stronger or weaker. Women have heels!<br /><br />Getting From A to B<br /><br />High heeled shoes can empower a woman or weaken her, it depends on the style, the height, what they're worn with, whilst flat shoes neither empower or weaken. They're merely feet coverings. That said, there are times in a woman's life when she wishes to be neither powerful nor weak, but simply needs to get from point A to point B in a practical and comfortable manner. That's why nearly every woman has a few pairs of heels, but at least one pair of flats, for those days when nothing but the road ahead and the steps underfoot have any importance.<br /><br />A Final Cautionary High Heel Shoe Note<br /><br />Although the main reason that women wear high heels may simply be due to the fact some queens, or would-be female monarchs, were un-regally short in statue, it also developed into a sign of affluence. But, fashionable, affluent ladies, BEWARE, since wearing high heels at some points in history, like during the French revolution, could cost you your head!<br /><br />To learn more about sepatu crocs <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5zYW5kYWxjcm9jcy5uZXQ_" target="_blank">go  </a>.

In this article, you will learn more about the ups and downs of your pregnancy.<br /><br />Refrain from smoking and drinking alcohol when you are pregnant to make sure that your baby is healthy.

Ignoring this information can put your baby at serious risk of a myriad of harmful diseases and conditions.<br /><br />During the third trimester, you may find it more comfortable to sleep while lying on the left side of your body. Sleeping on the left side allows the fetus to get the blood supply needed, and allows blood to flow to your uterus and kidneys with ease. Try to avoid sleeping on your back, as it is the worst position for blood flow.<br /><br />It seems your senses, particularly your smell, are intensified when you are pregnant. One consequence is that even the most common everyday smell can result in your feeling nauseated. If you are frequently bothered with this issue, then carrying a small cloth with lemon or lavender oils applied is helpful.

Either way, having a strong bond with your mom will result in a good support system for you and the baby later.<br /><br />The strength of your pregnancy is not determined by the darkness or lightness of the indicator on the pregnancy test. If you use a non-digital pregnancy test, don't worry about a line that seems pale or faint. A faint line is still a positive result and it does mean you are pregnant.<br /><br />A good sports bras can be an important item in a pregnant woman's wardrobe. The added support will ease the aches caused by fluctuating breast size. Furthermore, do not wear underwear that is too tight around your waist. If your underwear presses too tightly against your waist, it is not only uncomfortable for you, but can be dangerous for your baby, as he/she may not be able to get enough oxygen.<br /><br />Don't clean the cat's litter box while you're pregnant. Cat droppings can pass on infections and diseases, so leave the changing of your cat's litter box to someone else while you are pregnant.

True enough, designer shoes are made from very high quality materials which are expected to last for years. Some women would say they feel comfortable when wearing famous brands. Others buy them because they stand for everything a woman wants - fashion, glamor, fun.

But this is a more correct statement for women than it is for men.<br /><br />Women have shoes to wear for every state of affairs that life may offer them! A woman's shoes really go a long way towards telling you who she is, what she is like, and what she does with her life. There are many cases when a woman really needs a lot of different colors and styles, such as when she works everyday and needs a variety of shoes as well as some that are comfortable.<br /><br />There is no question about the fact that women love shoes. Many women cannot resist buying a new pair of shoes every time they pass by a shoe store. Rarely do we find a woman overlooking the show window of a shoe store, especially when there is sale going on. During the sales, it is very much likely that the parking lots of the shoe stores are jam packed with women rushing out of the store carrying more than one box. It gives the feeling to the passers-by who notice the scene that shoes are being given away <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5zYW5kYWxjcm9jcy5uZXQ_" target="_blank">sepatu crocs</a> !<br /><br />As goes the saying, the first impression is a lasting impression, thus it is really essential for a woman to pay attention to the type of shoes she wears. It is equally as important as any other accessory a woman wears, not like men who usually buy shoes just for the utilitarian need.<br /><br />These days, without a nice, matching pair of shoes, the fashion statement of a woman remains incomplete. It is believed that shoes help in depicting an individual's personality. It is indeed possible for the average person to know quite a bit about a woman by checking out the collection of shoes in her closet. A grubby sneaker in the collection denotes that the woman is an athlete or, maybe, she is a gardener. Cowboy boots will signify that the woman has a passion for riding horses. But if the boots are found to be in immaculate condition, then she probably has interest in country and western dance. A wide collection of shoes in diverse colors, shapes and style means that perhaps she is an office worker. Indeed a woman's shoes help a lot in letting a person know or have at least a slight idea of who she is, what she fond of and what kind of lifestyle she has.
