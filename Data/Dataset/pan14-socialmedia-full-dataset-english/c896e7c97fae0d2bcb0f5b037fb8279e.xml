<br />It's kinda hard to talk right now.
<br />Honey why are you crying? Is everything okay?
<br />I gotta whisper 'cause I can't be too loud
<br /><br />Well, my girl's in the next room
<br />Sometimes I wish she was you
<br />I guess we never really moved on
<br />It's really good to hear your voice saying my name
<br />It sounds so sweet
<br />Coming from the lips of an angel
<br />Hearing those words it makes me weak
<br /><br />And I never wanna say goodbye
<br />But girl you make it hard to be faithful
<br />With the lips of an angel
<br /><br />It's funny that you're calling me tonight
<br />And, yes, I've dreamt of you too
<br />And does he know you're talking to me
<br />Will it start a fight
<br />No I don't think she has a clue
<br /><br />Well my girl's in the next room
<br />Sometimes I wish she was you
<br />I guess we never really moved on
<br />It's really good to hear your voice saying my name
<br />It sounds so sweet
<br />Coming from the lips of an angel
<br />Hearing those words it makes me weak
<br /><br />And I never wanna say goodbye

<br />Shorty, cool as a fan
<br />On the new once again
<br />But, still has fan from Peru to Japan
<br />Listen baby, I don't wanna ruin your plan

<br />(Trust me) You don't really wanna let the chance go by
<br />'cause you ain't been seen wit a man so fly
<br />Baby friends so fly i can go fly

<br />I hate to have to cancel my vacation so you can't deny
<br />I'm patient, but I ain't gonna try
<br />You don't come, I ain't gonna die
<br />Hold up, what you mean, you can't go why?
<br />Me and you boyfriend we ain't no tie
<br />You say you wanna kick it when I ain't so high
<br />Well, baby it's obvious that I ain't your guy
<br />Ain't gon' lie, I feel your space
<br />But forget your face, I swear I will
<br />St. Barths, same bullet, anywhere I chill
<br />Just bring wit me a pair, I will

<br /><br />Girl: I have to tell you something...
<br /><br />Boy: What?
<br /><br />Girl: I really like you. And I... I think I'm falling in love with you.
<br /><br />Boy: Ok...
<br /><br />Girl: What do you mean &quot;ok&quot;?
<br /><br />Boy: I don't like you like that...
<br /><br />Girl: Why not?
<br /><br />Boy: I can't tell you... maybe another time...
<br /><br />From then on, the girl kept asking the boy &quot;Why not?&quot; whenever she saw him, and he kept answering the same answer of &quot;I'll tell you later.&quot; Finally the girl got fed up.
<br /><br />Girl: I'm tired of this! Tell me why you don't like me!
<br /><br />Boy: Do you really wanna know why?
<br /><br />Girl: Yes!
<br /><br />Boy: It's because you're ugly as ----! What's the point of going out with someone when they're not pretty?!
<br /><br />Girl: But... I...
<br /><br />Boy: Just shut up and leave me alone!
<br /><br />The boy leaves and the girl is sitting there alone, crying her heart out. Then her cell phone rings.
<br /><br />Girl: Hello?
<br /><br />Mom: Sweetheart? I want you to go home, ok? I'll be home from work in a few hours.
<br /><br />Girl: Alright Mom.
<br /><br />Mom: I love you.
<br /><br />Girl: I love you too, Mom.
<br /><br />Mom: Bye Bye.
<br /><br />Girl: Bye
<br /><br />The girl heads home and once she got there, she went in the bathroom and looked at herself in the mirror.
<br /><br />Girl: I'm not pretty enough...
<br /><br />She set to work, knowing fully well what she was going to do. 2 hours later, her Mom came home and heard the bath water running. She went upstairs to find the hallway flooded so she knocked on the door.
<br /><br />Mom: Honey? Are you alright?
<br /><br />She opened the door and was shocked at the site. The bath was overflowing onto the floor, and the water was tinted red. She walked over to see what was inside and screamed. There, her little girl was lying with cuts all over her face and wrists. Her Mom backed away and was going to run to call the police when something caught her eye on the mirror, saying &quot;am I pretty enough now?&quot;
<br /><br />No one deserves to be told that by someone they love. If you find it messed up then forward this to everyone you know.
<br /><br />A person's appearance doesn't count. What counts is their heart inside of them and their personality. No one wants to be told they're not good enough...
<br /><br />Repost this in 5 Min or something bad will happen 2 u tomorrow

<br /><br />&quot;Am I Pretty Enough Now?&quot; if ur a girl.
<br /><br />If you're a guy repost as &quot;No one deserves this&quot;

<br />call my name and save me from the dark
<br />(Wake me up)
<br />bid my blood to run
<br />(I canâ€™t wake up)
<br />before I come undone
<br />(Save me)
<br />save me from the nothing Iâ€™ve become
<br /><br />now that I know what Iâ€™m without
<br />you can't just leave me
<br />breathe into me and make me real
<br />bring me to life
<br /><br />(Wake me up)
<br />Wake me up inside
<br />(I canâ€™t wake up)
<br />Wake me up inside
<br />(Save me)
<br />call my name and save me from the dark
<br />(Wake me up)
<br />bid my blood to run
<br />(I canâ€™t wake up)
<br />before I come undone
<br />(Save me)
<br />save me from the nothing Iâ€™ve become
<br /><br />Bring me to life
<br />(I've been living a lie, there's nothing inside)
<br />Bring me to life
<br /><br />frozen inside without your touch without your love darling only you are the life among the dead
<br /><br />all this time I can't believe I couldn't see
<br />kept in the dark but you were there in front of me
<br />Iâ€™ve been sleeping a thousand years it seems
<br />got to open my eyes to everything
<br />without a thought without a voice without a soul
<br />don't let me die here
<br />there must be something more
<br />bring me to life
<br /><br />(Wake me up)
<br />Wake me up inside
<br />(I canâ€™t wake up)
<br />Wake me up inside
<br />(Save me)
<br />call my name and save me from the dark
<br />(Wake me up)
<br />bid my blood to run
<br />(I canâ€™t wake up)
<br />before I come undone
<br />(Save me)
<br />save me from the nothing Iâ€™ve become
<br /><br />(Bring me to life)
<br />Iâ€™ve been living a lie, thereâ€™s nothing inside 
<br />(Bring me to life)
