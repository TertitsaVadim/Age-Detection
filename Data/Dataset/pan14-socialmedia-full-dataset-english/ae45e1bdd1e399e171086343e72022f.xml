<br />?
<br />“And me in me prime!” cried Gerald stung.&lt;br /&gt;
<br />?
<br />James spoke gently.&lt;br /&gt;
<br />?
<br />“Jerry, there’s no girl in Savannah you’d have less chance of marrying. Her father is a Robillard, and those French are proud as Lucifer. And &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.chanelbagsoutletonline.net%26quot"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.chanelbagsoutletonline.net&quot</a>; title=&quot;chanel bags outlet&quot;&gt;chanel bags outlet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; her mother—God rest her soul—was a very great lady.”&lt;br /&gt;
<br />?
<br />“I care not,” said Gerald heatedly. “Besides, her mother is dead, and old man Robillard likes me.”&lt;br /&gt;
<br />?
<br />“As a man, yes, but as a son-in-law, no.”&lt;br /&gt;
<br />?
<br />“The girl wouldn’t have you anyway,” interposed Andrew. “She’s been in love with that wild buck of a cousin of hers, Philippe Robillard, for a year &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;cheap ghd hair straighteners&quot;&gt;cheap ghd hair straighteners&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; now, despite her family being at her morning and night to give him up.”&lt;br /&gt;
<br />?
<br />“He’s been gone to Louisiana this month now,” said Gerald.&lt;br /&gt;
<br />?
<br />“And how do you know?”&lt;br /&gt;
<br />?
<br />“I know,” answered Gerald, who did not care to disclose that Pork had supplied this valuable bit of information, or that Philippe had departed for the West at the express desire of his &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;cheap ghd straighteners&quot;&gt;cheap ghd straighteners&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; family. “And I do not think she’s been so much in love with him that she won’t forget him. Fifteen is too young to know much about love.”&lt;br /&gt;
<br />?
<br />“They’d rather &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;cheap ghd flat iron&quot;&gt;cheap ghd flat iron&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; have that breakneck cousin for her than you.”

It was empty. From the bedrooms on the floor above came an unending hum of low voices, rising and falling, punctuated with squeaks of laughter and, “Now, you didn’t, really!” and “What did he say then?” On the beds and couches of the six great bedrooms, the girls were resting, their dresses off, their <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jaGFuZWxvdXRsZXRzdG9yZXMub3Jn" target="_blank">chanel outlet </a> stays loosed, their hair flowing down their backs. Afternoon naps were a custom of the country and never were they so necessary as on the all-day parties, beginning early in the morning and culminating in a ball. For half an hour, the girls would chatter and laugh, and then servants would pull the shutters and in the warm half-gloom the talk would die to whispers and <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jaGVhcGdoZGhhaXJzdHJhaWdodGVuZXJzcy5jb20_" target="_blank">cheap ghd hair straighteners</a> finally expire in silence broken only by soft regular breathing.
<br />Scarlett had made certain that Melanie was lying down on the bed with Honey and Hetty Tarleton before she slipped into the hall and started down the stairs. From the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jaGVhcGdoZGhhaXJzdHJhaWdodGVuZXJzcy5jb20_" target="_blank">cheap ghd straighteners</a> window on the landing, she could see the group of men sitting under the arbor, drinking from tall glasses, and she knew they would remain there until late afternoon.

Then she listened and she heard his voice. As she had hoped, he was still in the front driveway bidding good-by to departing matrons and children.
<br />Her heart in her throat, she went swiftly down the stairs. What if she should meet Mr. Wilkes? What excuse could she give for prowling about the house when all the other girls were getting their beauty naps? Well, that had to be risked.
<br />As she reached the bottom step, she heard the servants moving about in the dining room under the butler’s orders, lifting out the table and chairs in preparation for the dancing. Across the wide hall was the open door of the library and she sped into it noiselessly.

And she certainly intended to find a way to make him admit it.&lt;br /&gt;
<br />?
<br />&lt;br /&gt;
<br />?
<br />The next day, Scarlett was standing in front of the mirror with a comb in her hand and her mouth full of hairpins, attempting a new coiffure which Maybelle, fresh from a visit to her husband in Richmond, had said was the rage at the Capital. It was called “Cats, Rats and Mice” and presented many <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jaGVhcGdoZGhhaXJzdHJhaWdodGVuZXJzcy5uZXQ_" target="_blank">cheap ghd hair straighteners</a> difficulties. The hair was parted in the middle and arranged in three rolls of graduating size on each side of the head, the largest, nearest the part, being the “cat.” The “cat” and the “rat” were easy to fix but the “mice” kept slipping out of her hairpins in an exasperating manner. However, she was determined to accomplish it, for Rhett was coming to supper and he always noticed and commented upon any innovation of dress or hair.&lt;br /&gt;
<br />?
<br />As she struggled with her bushy, obstinate locks, perspiration beading her forehead, she heard light running feet in the downstairs hall and knew that Melanie <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jaGVhcGdoZGhhaXJzdHJhaWdodGVuZXJzcy5uZXQ_" target="_blank">cheap ghd straighteners</a> was home from the hospital. As she heard her fly up the stairs, two at a time, she paused, hairpin in mid-air, realizing that something must be wrong, for Melanie always moved as decorously as a dowager. She went to the door and threw it open, and Melanie ran in, her face flushed and frightened, looking like a guilty child.&lt;br /&gt;
<br />?
<br />There were tears on her cheeks, her bonnet was hanging on her neck by the ribbons and her hoops swaying violently. She was clutching something in her hand, and the reek of heavy cheap perfume came into the room with her.&lt;br /&gt;
<br />?
<br />“Oh, Scarlett!” she cried, shutting the door and <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jaGVhcGdoZGhhaXJzdHJhaWdodGVuZXJzcy5uZXQ_" target="_blank">cheap ghd flat irons</a> sinking on the bed. “Is Auntie home yet? She isn’t? Oh, thank the Lord! Scarlett, I’m so mortified I could die! I nearly swooned and, Scarlett, Uncle Peter is threatening to tell Aunt Pitty!”&lt;br /&gt;
<br />?
<br />“Tell what?”&lt;br /&gt;
<br />?
<br />“That I was talking to that—to Miss—Mrs.—” Melanie fanned her hot face with her handkerchief. “That woman with red hair, named Belle Watling!”&lt;br /&gt;
<br />?
<br />“Why, Melly!” cried Scarlett, so shocked she could only stare.&lt;br /&gt;
<br />?
<br />Belle Watling was the red-haired woman she had seen on the street the first day she came to Atlanta and by now, she was easily the most notorious woman in town. Many prostitutes had flocked into Atlanta, following the soldiers, but Belle stood out above the rest, due to her flaming hair and the gaudy, overly <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jaGVhcGdoZGhhaXJzdHJhaWdodGVuZXJzcy5uZXQ_" target="_blank">cheap ghd flat iron</a> fashionable dresses she wore. She was seldom seen on Peachtree Street or in any nice neighborhood, but when she did appear respectable women made haste to cross the street to remove themselves from her vicinity. And Melanie had been talking with her. No wonder Uncle Peter was outraged.

Somewhere she flung off Wade’s grip, slinging him against the wall. She burst into the smoke-filled kitchen and reeled back, coughing, her eyes streaming tears from the smoke. Again she plunged in, her skirt held over her nose.
<br />The room was dark, lit as it was by one small window, and so thick with smoke that she was blinded, but she could hear the hiss and crackle of flames. Dashing a hand <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jaGVhcGdoZGhhaXJzdHJhaWdodGVuZXJzcy5uZXQ_" target="_blank">cheap ghd hair straighteners</a> across her eyes, she peered squinting and saw thin lines of flame creeping across the kitchen floor, toward the walls. Someone had scattered the blazing logs in the open fireplace across the whole room and the tinder-dry pine floor was sucking in the flames and spewing them up like water.
<br />Back she rushed to the dining room and snatched a rag rug from the floor, spilling two chairs with a crash.
<br />“I’ll never beat it out—never, never! Oh, God, if only there was someone to help! Tara is gone—gone! Oh, God! This was what that little wretch meant when he said he’d give me something to <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jaGVhcGdoZGhhaXJzdHJhaWdodGVuZXJzcy5uZXQ_" target="_blank">cheap ghd straighteners</a> remember him by! Oh, if I’d only let him have the sword!”
<br />In the hallway she passed her son lying in the corner with his sword. His eyes were closed and his face had a look of slack, unearthly peace.
<br />“My God! He’s dead! They’ve frightened him to death!” she thought in agony but she raced by him to the bucket of drinking water which always stood in the passageway by the kitchen door.
<br />She soused the end of the rug into the bucket and drawing a deep breath plunged again into the smoke-filled room slamming the door behind her. For an eternity she <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jaGVhcGdoZGhhaXJzdHJhaWdodGVuZXJzcy5uZXQ_" target="_blank">cheap ghd flat irons</a> reeled and coughed, beating the rug against the lines of fire that shot swiftly beyond her. Twice her long skirt took fire and she slapped it out with her hands. She could smell the sickening smell of her hair scorching, as it came loose from its pins and swept about her shoulders. The flames raced ever beyond her, toward the walls of the covered runway, fiery snakes that writhed and leaped and, exhaustion sweeping her, she knew that it was hopeless.
<br />Then the door swung open and the sucking draft flung the flames higher. It closed with a bang and, in the swirling smoke, Scarlett, half blind, saw Melanie, stamping her feet on the flames, beating at them with something dark and heavy. She saw her staggering, heard her coughing, caught a lightning-flash glimpse of her set white face and eyes narrow to slits against the smoke, saw her small body curving back and forth as she swung her rug up and down. For another eternity they fought and swayed, side by side, and Scarlett could see that the lines of fire were shortening. Then suddenly Melanie turned toward her and, with a cry, hit her across the shoulders with all her might. Scarlett went down in a whirlwind <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jaGVhcGdoZGhhaXJzdHJhaWdodGVuZXJzcy5uZXQ_" target="_blank">cheap ghd flat iron</a> of smoke and darkness. When she opened her eyes she was lying on the back porch, her head pillowed comfortably on Melanie’s lap, and the afternoon sunlight was shining on her face. Her hands, face and shoulders smarted intolerably from burns. Smoke was still rolling from the quarters, enveloping the cabins in thick clouds, and the smell of burning cotton was strong. Scarlett saw wisps of smoke drifting from the kitchen and she stirred frantically to rise.

I replied<br/><br/>t learning the chance we had missed, we both gave vent to our grief without control; and he allowed us to wail on till nine o'clock. Then he bid us go upstairs, through the kitchen, to Zillah's chamber; and I whispered my companion to obey: perhaps we might contrive to get through the window there, or into a garret, and out by its skylight. The window, however, was narrow, like those below, and the garret trap was safe from our attempts; for we were fastened in as before. We neither of us <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wb2xvcmFscGhzbGF1cmVub3V0bGV0LmNvbQ__" target="_blank">Polo Outlet</a> lay down: Catherine took her station by the lattice, and watched anxiously for morning; a deep sigh being the only answer I could obtain to my frequent entreaties that she would try to rest. I seated myself in a chair, and rocked to and fro, passing harsh judgment on my many derelictions of duty; from which, it struck me then, all the misfortunes of all my employers sprang. It was not the case, in reality, I am aware; but it was, in my imagination, that dismal night; and I thought Heathcliff himself less guilty than I.&lt;br /&gt;
<br />??    
<br />At seven o'clock he came, and inquired if Miss Linton had risen.&lt;br /&gt;
<br />??    
<br />She ran to the door immediately, and answered, `Yes.'&lt;br /&gt;
<br />??    
<br />`Here, then,' he said, opening it, and pulling her out I rose to follow, but he turned the lock again. I demanded my release.&lt;br /&gt;
<br />??    
<br />`Be patient,' he replied; `I'll send up your breakfast in a while.'&lt;br /&gt;
<br />??    
<br />I thumped on the panels, and rattled the latch angrily; and Catherine asked why I was still shut up? He answered, I must try to endure it another hour, and they went away. I endured it two or three hours; at length, I heard <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wb2xvcmFscGhzbGF1cmVub3V0bGV0LmNvbQ__" target="_blank">Polo Ralph Lauren Outlet</a> a footstep: not Heathcliff's.&lt;br /&gt;
<br />??    
<br />`I've brought you something to eat,' said a voice; `oppen t door!'&lt;br /&gt;
<br />??    
<br />Complying eagerly, I beheld Hareton, laden with food enough to last me all day.&lt;br /&gt;
<br />??    
<br />`Tak it,' he added, thrusting the tray into my hand.&lt;br /&gt;
<br />??    
<br />`Stay one minute,' I began.&lt;br /&gt;
<br />??    
<br />`Nay,' cried he, and retired, regardless of any prayers I could pour forth to detain him.&lt;br /&gt;
<br />??    
<br />And there I remained enclosed the whole day, and the whole of the next night; and another, and another. Five nights and four days I remained, altogether, seeing nobody but Hareton, once every morning; and he was a model of a jailer: surly, and dumb, and deaf to every attempt at moving his sense of justice or compassion. &lt;br /&gt;
<br />?? 
<br />&lt;br /&gt;
<br />Chapter 28&lt;br /&gt;
<br />??    
<br />On the fifth morning, or rather afternoon, a different step approached--lighter and shorter; and, this time, the person entered the room. It was Zillah; donned in her scarlet shawl, with a black silk bonnet on her head, and a willow basket swung to her arm.&lt;br /&gt;
<br />??    
<br />`Eh, dear! Mrs Dean!' she exclaimed. `Well! there is a talk <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wb2xvcmFscGhzbGF1cmVub3V0bGV0LmNvbQ__" target="_blank">Ralph Lauren Outlet</a> about you at Gimmerton. I never thought but you were sunk in the Blackhorse marsh, and missy with you, till master told me you'd been found, and he'd lodged you here! What! and you must have got on an island, sure? And how long were you in the hole? Did master save you, Mrs Dean? But you're not so thin--you've not been so poorly, have you?'&lt;br /&gt;
<br />??    
<br />`Your master is a true scoundrel!' I replied. `But he shall answer for it. He needn't have raised that tale: it shall all be laid bare!'&lt;br /&gt;
<br />??    
<br />`What do you mean?' asked zillah. `It's not his tale: they tell that in the village--about your being lost in the marsh: and I calls to Earnshaw, when I come in--&amp;quot;Eh, they's queer things, Mr Hareton, happened <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wb2xvcmFscGhzbGF1cmVub3V0bGV0LmNvbQ__" target="_blank">Polo Outlet online</a> since I went off. It's a sad pity of that likely young lass, and cant Nelly Dean.'' He stared. I thought he had not heard aught, so I told him the rumour. The master listened, and he just smiled to himself, and said, ``If they have been in the marsh, they are out now, Zillah. Nelly Dean is lodged, at this minute, in your room. You can tell her to flit, when you go up; here is the key. The bog water got into her head, and she would have run home quite flighty; but I fixed her till she came round to her senses. You can bid her go to the Grange <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wb2xvcmFscGhzbGF1cmVub3V0bGV0LmNvbQ__" target="_blank">Polo Ralph Lauren Outlet Online</a> at once, if she be able, and carry a message from me, that her young lady will follow in time to attend the squire's funeral.&amp;quot;

But they were loath to face their mother and they lingered on the porch of Tara, momentarily expecting Scarlett to give them an invitation to supper.
<br />“Look, Scarlett. About tomorrow,” said Brent. “Just because we’ve been away and didn’t know about the barbecue and the ball, that’s no reason why we shouldn’t get plenty of dances <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wb2xvcmFscGhzbGF1cmVub3V0bGV0LmNvbQ__" target="_blank">Polo Outlet</a> tomorrow night. You haven’t promised them all, have you?”
<br />“Well, I have! How did I know you all would be home? I couldn’t risk being a wallflower just waiting on you two.”
<br />“You a wallflower!” The boys laughed uproariously.
<br />“Look, honey. You’ve got to give me the first waltz and Stu the last one and you’ve got to eat supper with us. We’ll sit on the stair landing like we did at the last ball and get Mammy Jincy to come tell our fortunes again.”
<br />“I don’t like Mammy Jincy’s fortunes. You know she said I was going to marry a gentleman with jet-black hair and a long black mustache, and I don’t like black-haired gentlemen.”
<br />“You like ‘em red-headed, don’t you, honey?” grinned Brent “Now, come <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wb2xvcmFscGhzbGF1cmVub3V0bGV0LmNvbQ__" target="_blank">Polo Ralph Lauren Outlet</a> on, promise us all the waltzes and the supper.”
<br />“If you’ll promise, we’ll tell you a secret,” said Stuart.
<br />“What?” cried Scarlett, alert as a child at the word.
<br />“Is it what we heard yesterday in Atlanta, Stu? If it is, you know we promised not to tell.”
<br />“Well, Miss Pitty told us.”
<br />“Miss Who?”
<br />“You know, Ashley Wilkes’ cousin who lives in Atlanta, Miss Pittypat <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wb2xvcmFscGhzbGF1cmVub3V0bGV0LmNvbQ__" target="_blank">Ralph Lauren Outlet</a> Hamilton—Charles and Melanie Hamilton’s aunt.”
<br />“I do, and a sillier old lady I never met in all my life.”
<br />“Well, when we were in Atlanta yesterday, waiting for the home train, her carriage went by the depot and she stopped and talked to us, and she told us there was going to be an engagement announced tomorrow night at the Wilkes ball.”
<br />“Oh, I know about that,” said Scarlett in disappointment. “That silly nephew of hers, Charlie Hamilton, and Honey Wilkes. Everybody’s known for years that they’d get married some time, even if he did seem kind of <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wb2xvcmFscGhzbGF1cmVub3V0bGV0LmNvbQ__" target="_blank">Polo Outlet online</a> lukewarm about it.”
<br />“Do you think he’s silly?” questioned Brent. “Last Christmas you sure let him buzz round you plenty.”
<br />“I couldn’t help him buzzing,” Scarlett shrugged negligently. “I think he’s an awful sissy.”
<br />“Besides, it isn’t his engagement that’s going to be announced,” said Stuart triumphantly. “It’s Ashley’s to Charlie’s sister, Miss Melanie!”
<br />Scarlett’s face did not change but her lips went white—like a person who has received a stunning blow without warning and who, in the first moments of shock, does not realize what has happened. So still was her face as she <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wb2xvcmFscGhzbGF1cmVub3V0bGV0LmNvbQ__" target="_blank">Polo Ralph Lauren Outlet Online</a> stared at Stuart that he, never analytic, took it for granted that she was merely surprised and very interested.
<br />“Miss Pitty told us they hadn’t intended announcing it till next year, because Miss Melly hasn’t been very well; but with all the war talk going around, everybody in both families thought it would be better to get married soon. So it’s to be announced tomorrow night at the supper intermission. Now, Scarlett, we’ve told you the secret, so you’ve got to promise to eat supper with us.”

She had never stood starry eyed when the Stars and Bars ran up a pole or felt cold chills when “Dixie” sounded. She had not been sustained through privations, the sickening duties of nursing, the fears of the siege and the hunger of the last few months by the fanatic glow which made all these things endurable to others, if only the Cause prospered. It was all over and done with and she was not going to cry about it. All over! The war which had seemed so endless, the war which, unbidden and unwanted, had cut her life in two, had made so clean a cleavage that it was difficult to remember those other care-tree days. She could look back, unmoved, at the pretty Scarlett with her fragile green morocco slippers and her flounces fragrant with <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5yZWRib3R0b21zaGVlbHMubmV0" target="_blank">red bottom heels</a> lavender but she wondered if she could be that same girl. Scarlett O’Hara, with the County at her feet, a hundred slaves to do her bidding, the wealth of Tara like a wall behind her and doting parents anxious to grant any desire of her heart. Spoiled, careless Scarlett who had never known an ungratified wish except where Ashley was concerned. Somewhere, on the long road that wound through those four years, the girl with her sachet and dancing slippers had slipped away and there was left a woman with sharp green eyes, who counted pennies and turned her hands to many menial tasks, a woman to whom nothing was left from the wreckage except the indestructible red earth on which she stood. As she stood in the hall, listening to the girls sobbing, her mind was busy. “We’ll plant more cotton, lots more. I’ll send Pork to Macon tomorrow to buy more seed. Now the Yankees won’t burn it and our troops won’t need it Good Lord! Cotton ought to go sky high this fall!” She went into the little office and, disregarding the weeping girls on the sofa, seated herself at the secretary and picked up a quill to balance the cost of more cotton seed against <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5yZWRib3R0b21zaGVlbHMubmV0" target="_blank">red bottoms</a> her remaining cash. “The war is over,” she thought and suddenly she dropped the quill as a wild happiness flooded her. The war was over and Ashley—if Ashley was alive he’d be coming home! She wondered if Melanie, in the midst of mourning for the lost Cause, had thought of this. “Soon we’ll get a letter—no, not a letter. We can’t get letters. But soon—oh, somehow he’ll let us know!” But the days passed into weeks and there was no news from Ashley. The mail service in the South was uncertain and in the rural districts there was none at all. Occasionally a passing traveler from Atlanta brought a note from Aunt Pitty tearfully begging the girls to come back. But never news of Ashley. After the surrender, an ever-present feud over the horse smoldered between Scarlett and Suellen. Now that there was no danger of Yankees, Suellen wanted to go calling on the neighbors. Lonely and missing the happy sociability of the old days, Suellen longed to visit friends, if for no other reason than to assure herself that the rest of the County was as bad off as Tara. But Scarlett was adamant. The horse was for work, to drag logs from the woods, to plow and for Pork to ride in search of food. On Sundays he had earned the right to graze in the pasture and rest. If Suellen wanted to go visiting she could go afoot. Before the last year Suellen had never walked a hundred yards in her life and this prospect was anything but pleasing:’ So she stayed at home and nagged and cried and said, once too often: “Oh, if only Mother was here!” At that, Scarlett gave her the long-promised slap, hitting her so hard it knocked her screaming to the bed and caused great consternation throughout the house. Thereafter, Suellen whined the less, at least in Scarlett’s presence. Scarlett spoke truthfully when she said she wanted <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5yZWRib3R0b21zaGVlbHMubmV0" target="_blank">red bottom shoes</a> the horse to rest but that was only half of the truth. The other half was that she had paid one round of calls on the County in the first month after the surrender and the sight of old friends and old plantations had shaken her courage more than she liked to admit. The Fontaines had fared best of any, thanks to Sally’s hard ride, but it was flourishing only by comparison with the desperate situation of the other neighbors. Grandma Fontaine had never completely recovered from the heart attack she had the day she led the others in beating out the flames and saving the house. Old Dr. Fontaine was convalescing slowly from an amputated arm. Alex and Tony were turning awkward hands to plows and hoe handles. They leaned over the fence rail to shake hands with Scarlett when she called and they laughed at her rickety wagon, their black eyes bitter, for they were laughing at themselves as well as her. She asked to buy seed corn from them and they promised it and fell to discussing farm <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wb2xvcmFscGhzbGF1cmVub3V0bGV0LmNvbQ__" target="_blank">Polo Outlet</a> problems. They had twelve chickens, two cows, five hogs and the mule they brought home from the war. One of the hogs had just died and they were worried about losing the others. At bearing such serious words about hogs from these ex-dandies who had never given life a more serious thought than which cravat was most fashionable, Scarlett laughed and this time her laugh was bitter too.

And then it’s about the last house on the north end of town and the fire wasn’t so bad over that way. Of course, the Yankees quartered there tore it up aplenty. They even burned the baseboard and the mahogany stair rail for firewood, but shucks! It’s in good shape. When I saw Miss Pitty last week in Macon—”
<br />“You saw her? How is she?”
<br />“Just fine. Just fine. When I told her her house was still standing, she made up her mind to come home right away. That is—if that old darky, Peter, will let her come. Lots of the Atlanta people have already come back, because they got nervous about Macon. Sherman didn’t take Macon but everybody is afraid Wilson’s raiders will get there soon and he’s worse than Sherman.”
<br />“But how silly of them to come back if there aren’t any houses! Where do they live?”
<br />“Miss Scarlett, they’re living in 
<br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5yZWRib3R0b21zaGVlbHMubmV0" target="_blank">red bottom heels</a> tents and shacks and log cabins and doubling up six and seven families in the few houses still standing. And they’re trying to rebuild. Now, Miss Scarlett, don’t say they are silly. You know Atlanta folks as well as I do. They are plumb set on that town, most as bad as Charlestonians are about Charleston, and it’ll take more than Yankees and a burning to keep them away. Atlanta folks are—begging your pardon, Miss Melly—as stubborn as mules about Atlanta. I don’t know why, for I always thought that town a mighty pushy, impudent sort of place. But then, I’m a countryman born and I don’t like any town. And let me tell you, the ones who are getting back first are the smart ones. The ones who come back last won’t find a stick or stone or brick of their houses, because everybody’s out salvaging things all over town to rebuild their houses. Just day before yesterday, I saw Mrs. Merriwether and Miss Maybelle and their old darky woman out collecting brick in a wheelbarrow. And Mrs. Meade told me she was thinking about building a log cabin when the doctor comes back to help her. She said she lived in a log cabin when she first came to Atlanta, when it was Marthasville, and it wouldn’t bother her none to do it again. ‘Course, she was only joking but that shows you how they feel about it.”
<br />“I think they’ve got a lot of spirit,” said Melanie proudly. “Don’t you, Scarlett?”
<br />Scarlett nodded, a grim pleasure and pride in her adopted town filling her. As Frank said, it was a pushy, impudent place and that was why she liked it. It wasn’t hidebound and stick-in-the-muddish like the older towns <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5yZWRib3R0b21zaGVlbHMubmV0" target="_blank">red bottoms</a> and it had a brash exuberance that matched her own. “I’m like Atlanta,” she thought. “It takes more than Yankees or a burning to keep me down.”
<br />“If Aunt Pitty is going back to Atlanta, we’d better go back and stay with her, Scarlett,” said Melanie, interrupting her train of thought. “She’ll die of fright alone.”
<br />“Now, how can I leave here, Melly?” Scarlett asked crossly. “If you are so anxious to go, go. I won’t stop you.”
<br />“Oh, I didn’t mean it that way, darling,” cried Melanie, flushing with distress. “How thoughtless of me! Of course, you can’t leave Tara and—and I guess Uncle Peter and Cookie can take care of Auntie.”
<br />“There’s nothing to keep you from going,” Scarlett pointed out, shortly.
<br />“You know I wouldn’t leave you,” answered Melanie. “And I—I would be just frightened to death without you.”
<br />“Suit yourself. Besides, you wouldn’t catch me going back to Atlanta. Just as soon as they get a few houses up, Sherman will come back and burn it again.”
<br />“He won’t be back,” said Frank and, despite his efforts, his face drooped. “He’s gone on through the state to the coast. Savannah was captured this week and they say the Yankees are going on up into South Carolina.”
<br />“Savannah taken!”
<br />“Yes. Why, ladies, Savannah couldn’t help but fall. They didn’t have enough men to hold it, though they used every man they could get—every man who could drag one foot after another. Do you know that when the Yankees were <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5yZWRib3R0b21zaGVlbHMubmV0" target="_blank">red bottom shoes</a> marching on Milledgeville, they called out all the cadets from the military academies, no matter how young they were, and even opened the state penitentiary to get fresh troops? Yes, sir, they turned loose every convict who was willing to fight and promised him a pardon if he lived through the war. It kind of gave me the creeps to see those little cadets in the ranks with thieves and cutthroats.”
<br />“They turned loose the convicts on us!”
<br />“Now, Miss Scarlett, don’t you get upset. They’re a long way off from here, and furthermore they’re making good soldiers. I guess being a thief don’t keep a man from being a good soldier, does it?”
<br />“I think it’s wonderful,” said Melanie softly.
<br />“Well, I don’t,” said Scarlett flatly. “There’s thieves enough running around the country anyway, what with the Yankees and—” She caught herself in time but the men laughed.
<br />“What with Yankees and our commissary department,” they finished and she flushed.
<br />“But where’s General Hood’s army?” interposed Melanie hastily. “Surely he could have held Savannah.”
<br />“Why, Miss Melanie,” Frank was startled and reproachful, “General Hood hasn’t been down in that section at all. He’s been fighting up in Tennessee, trying to draw the Yankees out of Georgia.”
<br />“And didn’t his little scheme work well!” cried Scarlett sarcastically. “He left the damn Yankees to go through us with nothing but schoolboys and convicts and Home Guards to protect us.”

No miser ever counted his gold oftener than she and no miser ever had greater fear of losing it. She would not put the money in the bank, for it might fail or the Yankees might confiscate it. So she carried what she could with her, tucked into her corset, and hid small wads of bills about the house, under loose bricks on the hearth, in her scrap bag, between the pages of the Bible. And <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wb2xvcmFscGhzbGF1cmVub3V0bGV0LmNvbQ__" target="_blank">Polo Outlet</a> her temper grew shorter and shorter as the weeks went by, for every dollar she saved would be just one more dollar to lose if disaster descended. Frank, Pitty and the servants bore her outbursts with maddening kindness, attributing her bad disposition to her pregnancy, never realizing the true cause. Frank knew that pregnant women must be humored, so he put his pride in his pocket and said nothing more about her running the mills and her going about town at such a time, as no lady should do. Her conduct was a constant embarrassment to him but he reckoned he could endure it for a while longer. After the baby came, he knew she would be the same sweet feminine girl he had courted. But in spite of everything he did to appease her, she <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wb2xvcmFscGhzbGF1cmVub3V0bGV0LmNvbQ__" target="_blank">Polo Ralph Lauren Outlet</a> continued to have her tantrums and often he thought she acted like one possessed. No one seemed to realize what really possessed her, what drove her like a mad woman. It was a passion to get her affairs in order before she had to retire behind doors, to have as much money as possible in case the deluge broke upon her again, to have a stout levee of cash against the rising tide of Yankee hate. Money was the obsession dominating her mind these days. When she thought of the baby at all, it was with baffled rage at the untimeliness of it. “Death and taxes and childbirth! There’s never any convenient time for any of them!” Atlanta had been scandalized enough when Scarlett, a woman, began operating the sawmill but as time went by, the town decided there was no limit to what she would do. Her sharp trading was shocking, especially <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wb2xvcmFscGhzbGF1cmVub3V0bGV0LmNvbQ__" target="_blank">Ralph Lauren Outlet</a> when her poor mother had been a Robillard, and it was positively indecent the way she kept on going about the streets when everyone knew she was pregnant. No respectable white woman and few negroes ever went outside their homes from the moment they first suspected they were with child, and Mrs. Merriwether declared indignantly that from the way Scarlett was acting she was likely to have the baby on the public streets. But all the previous criticism of her conduct was as nothing compared with the buzz of gossip that now went through the town. Scarlett was not only trafficking with the Yankees but was giving every appearance of really liking it! Mrs. Merriwether and many other Southerners were also doing business with the newcomers from the North, but the difference was that they did not like it and plainly showed they did not like it. And Scarlett <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wb2xvcmFscGhzbGF1cmVub3V0bGV0LmNvbQ__" target="_blank">Polo Outlet online</a> did, or seemed to, which was just as bad. She had actually taken tea with the Yankee officers’ wives in their homes! In fact, she had done practically everything short of inviting them into her own home, and the town guessed she would do even that, except for Aunt Pitty and Frank. Scarlett knew the town was talking but she did not care, could not afford to care. She still hated the Yankees with as fierce a hate as on the day when they tried to burn Tara, but she could dissemble that hate. She knew that if she was going to make <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wb2xvcmFscGhzbGF1cmVub3V0bGV0LmNvbQ__" target="_blank">Polo Ralph Lauren Outlet Online</a> money, she would have to make it out of the Yankees, and she had learned that buttering them up with smiles and kind words was the surest way to get their business for her mill. Some day when she was very rich and her money was hidden away where the Yankees could not find it, then, then she would tell them exactly what she thought of them, tell them how she hated and loathed and despised them. And what a joy that would be! But until that time came, it was just plain common sense to get along with them. And if that was hypocrisy, let Atlanta make the most of it. She discovered that making friends with the Yankee officers was as easy as shooting birds on the ground. They were lonely exiles in a hostile land and many of them <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wb2xvcmFscGhzbGF1cmVub3V0bGV0LmNvbQ__" target="_blank">Polo Ralph Lauren Outlet Store</a> were starved for polite feminine associations in a town where respectable women drew their skirts aside in passing and looked as if they would like to spit on them. Only the prostitutes and the negro women had kind words for them. But Scarlett was obviously a lady and a lady of family, for all that she worked, and they thrilled to her flashing smile and the pleasant light in her green eyes.

At the same moment, Scarlett’s eye was caught by a figure on the sidewalk in a brightly colored dress—too bright for street wear—covered by a Paisley shawl with fringes to the heels. Turning she saw a tall handsome woman with a bold face and a mass of red hair, too red to be 
<br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wb2xvcmFscGhzbGF1cmVub3V0bGV0LmNvbQ__" target="_blank">Polo Outlet</a> true. It was the first time she had ever seen any woman who she knew for certain had “done something to her hair” and she watched her, fascinated. “Uncle Peter, who is that?” she whispered. “Ah doan know.” “You do, too. I can tell. Who is she?” “Her name Belle Watling,” said Uncle Peter, his lower lip beginning to protrude. Scarlett was quick to catch the fact that he had not preceded the name with “Miss” or “Mrs.” “Who is she?” “Miss Scarlett,” said Peter darkly, laying the whip on the startled horse, “Miss Pitty ain gwine ter lak it you astin’ questions dat ain’ none of yo’ bizness. Day’s a passel of no-count folks in dis town now dat it ain’ no use talkin’ about.” “Good Heavens!” thought Scarlett, reproved into silence. That must be a bad woman!” She had never seen a bad woman before and she twisted her head and stared after her until she was lost in the crowd. The stores and the new war <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wb2xvcmFscGhzbGF1cmVub3V0bGV0LmNvbQ__" target="_blank">Polo Ralph Lauren Outlet</a> buildings were farther apart now, with vacant lots between. Finally the business section fell behind and the residences came into view. Scarlett picked them out as old friends, the Leyden house, dignified and stately; the Bonnells’, with little white columns and green, blinds; the close-lipped red-brick Georgian home of the McLure family, behind its low box hedges. Their progress was slower now, for from porches and gardens and sidewalks ladies called to her. Some she knew slightly, others she vaguely remembered, but <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wb2xvcmFscGhzbGF1cmVub3V0bGV0LmNvbQ__" target="_blank">Ralph Lauren Outlet</a> most of them she knew not at all. Pittypat had certainly broadcast her arrival. Little Wade had to be held up time and again, so that ladies who ventured as far through the ooze as their carriage blocks could exclaim over him. They all cried to her that she must join their knitting and sewing circles and their hospital committees, and no one else’s, and she promised recklessly to right and left. As they passed a rambling green clapboard house, a little black girl posted on the front steps cried, “Hyah she come,” and Dr. Meade and his wife and little thirteen-year-old Phil emerged, calling greetings. Scarlett recalled that they too had been at her wedding. Mrs. Meade mounted her carriage <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wb2xvcmFscGhzbGF1cmVub3V0bGV0LmNvbQ__" target="_blank">Polo Outlet online</a> block and craned her neck for a view of the baby, but the doctor, disregarding the mud, plowed through to the side of the carriage. He was tall and gaunt and wore a pointed beard of iron gray, and his clothes hung on his spare figure as though blown there by a hurricane. Atlanta considered him the root of all strength and all wisdom and it was not strange that he had absorbed something of their belief. But for all his habit of making oracular statements and his slightly pompous manner, he was as kindly a man as the town possessed. After shaking her hand and prodding Wade in the stomach and complimenting him, the doctor announced that Aunt Pittypat had promised on oath that Scarlett should be on no other hospital and bandage-rolling committee save <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wb2xvcmFscGhzbGF1cmVub3V0bGV0LmNvbQ__" target="_blank">Polo Ralph Lauren Outlet Online</a> Mrs. Meade’s. “Oh, dear, but I’ve promised a thousand ladies already!” said Scarlett. “Mrs. Merriwether. I’ll be bound!” cried Mrs. Meade indignantly. “Drat the woman! I believe she meets every train!” “I promised because I hadn’t a notion what it was all about,” Scarlett confessed. “What are hospital committees anyway?” Both the doctor and his wife looked slightly shocked at her ignorance. “But, of course, you’ve been buried in the country and couldn’t know,” Mrs. Meade <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5yZWRib3R0b21zaGVlbHMubmV0" target="_blank">red bottom heels</a> apologized for her. “We have nursing committees for different hospitals and for different days. We nurse the men and help the doctors and make bandages and clothes and when the men are well enough to leave the hospitals we take them into our homes to convalesce till they are able to go back in the army. And we look after the wives and families of some of the wounded who are destitute—yes, worse than destitute. Dr. Meade is at the Institute hospital where my committee works, and everyone says he’s marvelous and—”

		<document id="c424f59e676fc78018fb71dcf173fa67" url=""><![CDATA[His convalescence was a long one<br/><br/>Scarlett turned away, wordless. After that, Melanie noticed there was more food on the table when guests were present, even though Scarlett might grudge them every mouthful.
<br />When the soldiers were too ill to go on, and there were many such, Scarlett put them to bed with none too good grace. Each sick man meant another mouth to feed. Someone had to nurse him and <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wb2xvcmFscGhzbGF1cmVub3V0bGV0LmNvbQ__" target="_blank">Polo Outlet</a> that meant one less worker at the business of fence building, hoeing, weeding and plowing. One boy, on whose face a blond fuzz had just begun to sprout, was dumped on the front porch by a mounted soldier bound for Fayetteville. He had found him unconscious by the roadside and had brought him, across his saddle, to Tara, the nearest house. The girls thought he must be one of the little cadets who had been called out of military school when Sherman approached Milledgeville but they never knew, for he died without regaining consciousness and a search of his pockets yielded no information.
<br />A nice-looking boy, obviously a gentleman, and somewhere to the south, some woman was watching the roads, wondering where he was and when he was coming home, just as she and Melanie, with a wild hope in their hearts, watched <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wb2xvcmFscGhzbGF1cmVub3V0bGV0LmNvbQ__" target="_blank">Polo Ralph Lauren Outlet</a> every bearded figure that came up their walk. They buried the cadet in the family burying ground, next to the three little O’Hara boys, and Melanie cried sharply as Pork filled in the grave, wondering in her heart if strangers were doing this same thing to the tall body of Ashley.
<br />Will Benteen was another soldier, like the nameless boy, who arrived unconscious across the saddle of a comrade. Will was acutely ill with pneumonia and when the girls put him to bed, they feared he would soon join the boy in the burying ground.
<br />He had the sallow malarial face of the south Georgia Cracker, pale pinkish hair and washed-out blue eyes which even in delirium were patient and mild. One of his legs was gone at the knee and to the stump was fitted a roughly whittled wooden peg. He was obviously a Cracker, just as the boy they had buried so short a while ago was obviously a planter’s son. Just<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wb2xvcmFscGhzbGF1cmVub3V0bGV0LmNvbQ__" target="_blank">Ralph Lauren Outlet</a> how the girls knew this they could not say. Certainly Will was no dirtier, no more hairy, no more lice infested than many fine gentlemen who came to Tara. Certainly the language he used in his delirium was no less grammatical than that of the Tarleton twins. But they knew instinctively, as they knew thoroughbred horses from scrubs, that he was not of their class. But this knowledge did not keep them from laboring to save him.
<br />Emaciated from a year in a Yankee prison, exhausted by his long tramp on his ill-fitting wooden peg, he had little strength to combat pneumonia and for days he lay in the bed moaning, trying to get up, fighting battles over again. Never once did he call for mother, wife, sister or sweetheart and this omission worried Carreen.
<br />“A man ought to have some folks,” she said. “And he sounds like he didn’t have a soul in the world.”
<br />For all his lankiness he was tough, and good <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5yZWRib3R0b21zaGVlbHMubmV0" target="_blank">red bottom heels</a> nursing pulled him through. The day came when his pale blue eyes, perfectly cognizant of his surroundings, fell upon Carreen sitting beside him, telling her rosary beads, the morning sun shining through her fair hair.
<br />“Then you warn’t a dream, after all,” he said, in his flat toneless voice. “I hope I ain’t troubled you too much, Ma’m.”
<br />His convalescence was a long one and he lay quietly looking out of the window at the magnolias and causing very little trouble to anyone. Carreen liked him because of his placid and unembarrassed silences. She would sit beside him through the long hot afternoons, fanning him and saying nothing.
<br />Carreen had very little to say these days as she moved, delicate and wraithlike, about the tasks which were within her strength. She prayed a good deal, for when Scarlett came into her room without knocking, she always found her on her knees by her bed. The sight never failed to annoy her, for Scarlett felt that the time for prayer had passed. If <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5yZWRib3R0b21zaGVlbHMubmV0" target="_blank">red bottoms</a> God had seen fit to punish them so, then God could very well do without prayers. Religion had always been a bargaining process with Scarlett. She promised God good behavior in exchange for favors. God had broken the bargain time and again, to her way of thinking, and she felt that she owed Him nothing at all now. And whenever she found Carreen on her knees when she should have been taking an afternoon nap or doing the mending, she felt that Carreen <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5yZWRib3R0b21zaGVlbHMubmV0" target="_blank">red bottom shoes</a> was shirking her share of the burdens.
<br />She said as much to Will Benteen one afternoon when he was able to sit up in a chair and was startled when he said in his flat voice: “Let her be, Miss Scarlett. It comforts her.”
<br />“Comforts her?”

Scarlett walked under it and sat down on one of the empty kegs that were evidently put there for seats. She peered up and down the street for Will Benteen. Will should have been here to meet her. He should have known she would take the first tram possible after receiving his laconic message that Gerald was dead.
<br />She had come so hurriedly that she had in her small carpetbag only a nightgown and a tooth brush, not even a change of underwear. She was uncomfortable in the tight black dress she had <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wb2xvcmFscGhzbGF1cmVub3V0bGV0LmNvbQ__" target="_blank">Polo Outlet</a> borrowed from Mrs. Meade, for she had had no time to get mourning clothes for herself. Mrs. Meade was thin now, and Scarlett’s pregnancy being advanced, the dress was doubly uncomfortable. Even in her sorrow at Gerald’s death, she did not forget the appearance she was making and she looked down at her body with distaste. Her figure was completely gone and her face and ankles were puffy. Heretofore she had not cared very much how she looked but now that she would see Ashley within the hour she cared greatly. Even in her heartbreak, she shrank from the thought of facing him when she was carrying another man’s child. She loved him and he loved her, and this unwanted child now seemed to her a proof of infidelity to that love. But much as she disliked having him see her with the slenderness gone from her waist and the lightness from her step, it was something she could not escape now.
<br />She patted her foot impatiently. Will should have met her. Of course, she could go over to Bullard’s and inquire after him or ask someone there to drive her over to Tara, should she find he had been unable to come. But she <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wb2xvcmFscGhzbGF1cmVub3V0bGV0LmNvbQ__" target="_blank">Ralph Lauren Outlet</a> did not want to go to Bullard’s. It was Saturday night and probably half the men of the County would be there. She did not want to display her condition in this poorly fitting black dress which accentuated rather than hid her figure. And she did not want to hear the kindly sympathy that would be poured out about Gerald. She did not want sympathy. She was afraid she would cry if anyone even mentioned his name to her. And she wouldn’t cry. She knew if she once began it would be like the time she cried into the horse’s mane, that dreadful night when Atlanta fell and Rhett had left her on the dark road outside the town, terrible tears that tore her heart and could not be stopped.
<br />No, she wouldn’t cry! She felt the lump in her throat rising again, as it had done so often since the news came, but crying wouldn’t do any good. It would only confuse and weaken her. Why, oh, why hadn’t Will or Melanie or the girls written her that Gerald was ailing? She would have taken the first train to Tara to care for him, brought a doctor from Atlanta if necessary. The fools—all of them! Couldn’t they manage anything without her? She couldn’t be in two places at once and the good Lord knew she was doing her best <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wb2xvcmFscGhzbGF1cmVub3V0bGV0LmNvbQ__" target="_blank">Polo Ralph Lauren Outlet Online</a> for them all in Atlanta.
<br />She twisted about on the keg, becoming nervous and fidgety as Will still did not come. Where was he? Then she heard the scrunching of cinders on the railroad tracks behind her and, twisting her <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5yZWRib3R0b21zaGVlbHMubmV0" target="_blank">red bottoms</a> body, she saw Alex Fontaine crossing the tracks toward a wagon, a sack of oats on his shoulder.
<br />“Good Lord! Isn’t that you, Scarlett?” he cried, dropping the sack and running to take her hand, pleasure written all over his bitter, swarthy little face. “I’m so glad to see you. I saw Will over at the blacksmith’s shop, getting the horse shod. The train was late and he thought he’d have time. Shall I run fetch him?”
<br />“Yes, please, Alex,” she said, smiling in spite of her sorrow. It was good to see a County face again.
<br />“Oh—er—Scarlett,” he began awkwardly, still holding <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5yZWRib3R0b21zaGVlbHMubmV0" target="_blank">red bottom heels</a> her hand, I’m mighty sorry about your father.”
<br />“Thank you,” she replied, wishing he had not said it. His words brought up Gerald’s florid face and bellowing voice so clearly.
<br />“If it’s any comfort to you, Scarlett, we’re mighty <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.poloralphslaurenoutlet.com%2Farticle%2FArticle-100.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.poloralphslaurenoutlet.com/article/Article-100.html</a> proud of him around here,” Alex continued, dropping her hand. “He—well, we figure he died like a soldier and in a soldier’s cause.”

She had no memory for names, dates or places and frequently confused the actors in one Atlanta drama with the actors in another, which misled no one for no one was foolish enough to take seriously anything she said. No one ever told her anything really shocking or scandalous, for her spinster state must be protected even if she was sixty years old, and her friends were in a kindly conspiracy to keep her a sheltered and petted old child. Melanie was like her aunt in many ways. She had her shyness, her sudden blushes, her modesty, but she did have common sense—”Of a sort, I’ll admit that,” Scarlett thought grudgingly. Like Aunt Pitty, Melanie had the face of a sheltered child who had never known anything but simplicity and kindness, truth 
<br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wb2xvcmFscGhzbGF1cmVub3V0bGV0LmNvbQ__" target="_blank">Polo Outlet</a> and love, a child who had never looked upon harshness or evil and would not recognize them if she saw them. Because she had always been happy, she wanted everyone about her to be happy or, at least, pleased with themselves. To this end, she always saw the best in everyone and remarked kindly upon it. There was no servant so stupid that she did not find some redeeming trait of loyalty and kind-heartedness, no girl so ugly and disagreeable that she could not discover grace of form or nobility of character in her, and no man so worthless or so boring that she did not view him in the light of his possibilities rather than his actualities. Because of these qualities that came sincerely and spontaneously from a generous heart, everyone flocked about her, for who can resist the charm of one who discovers in others admirable qualities undreamed of even by himself? She had more girl friends than anyone in town and more men friends too, though she had few beaux for she lacked the willfulness and selfishness that go far toward trapping men’s <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wb2xvcmFscGhzbGF1cmVub3V0bGV0LmNvbQ__" target="_blank">Ralph Lauren Outlet</a> hearts. What Melanie did was no more than all Southern girls were taught to do—to make those about them feel at ease and pleased with themselves. It was this happy feminine conspiracy which made Southern society so pleasant. Women knew that a land where men were contented, uncontradicted and safe in possession of unpunctured vanity was likely to be a very pleasant place for women to live. So, from the cradle to the grave, women strove to make men pleased with themselves, and the satisfied men repaid lavishly with gallantry and adoration. In fact, men willingly gave the ladies everything in the world except credit for having intelligence. Scarlett exercised the same charms as Melanie but with a studied artistry and consummate skill. The difference between the two girls lay in the fact that Melanie spoke kind and flattering words from a desire to make people happy, if only temporarily, and Scarlett never did it except to further her own aims. From the two he loved best, Charles had received no toughening influences, learned nothing of harshness or reality, and the home in which he grew to manhood was as soft as a bird’s nest. It was such a quiet, old-fashioned, gentle home compared with Tara. To Scarlett, this house cried out for the masculine smells of brandy, tobacco and Macassar oil, for hoarse <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wb2xvcmFscGhzbGF1cmVub3V0bGV0LmNvbQ__" target="_blank">Polo Ralph Lauren Outlet Store</a> voices and occasional curses, for guns, for whiskers, for saddles and bridles and for hounds underfoot. She missed the sounds of quarreling voices that were always heard at Tara when Ellen’s back was turned, Mammy quarreling with Pork, Rosa and Teena bickering, her own acrimonious arguments with Suellen, Gerald’s bawling threats. No wonder Charles had been a sissy, coming from a home like this. Here, excitement never entered in, voices were never raised, everyone deferred gently to the opinions of <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5yZWRib3R0b21zaGVlbHMubmV0" target="_blank">red bottom heels</a> others, and, in the end, the black grizzled autocrat in the kitchen had his way. Scarlett, who had hoped for a freer rein when she escaped Mammy’s supervision, discovered to her sorrow that Uncle Peter’s standards of ladylike conduct, especially for Mist’ Charles’ widow, were even stricter than Mammy’s. In such a household, Scarlett came back to herself, and almost before she realized it her spirits rose to normal. She was only seventeen, she had superb health and energy, and Charles’ people did their best to make her happy. If they fell a little short of this, it was not their fault, for no one could take out of her heart the ache that throbbed whenever Ashley’s name was mentioned. And Melanie mentioned it so often! But Melanie and Pitty were tireless in planning ways to soothe the sorrow under which they thought she labored. They put their own grief into the background in order <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5yZWRib3R0b21zaGVlbHMubmV0" target="_blank">red bottoms</a> to divert her. They fussed about her food and her hours for taking afternoon naps and for taking carriage rides. They not only admired her extravagantly, her high-spiritedness, her figure, her tiny hands and feet, her white skin, but they said so frequently, petting, hugging and kissing her to emphasize their loving words. Scarlett did not care for the caresses, but she basked in the compliments. No one at Tara had ever said so many charming things about her. In fact, Mammy had spent her time deflating her conceit. Little Wade was no longer an annoyance, for the family, black and white, and the neighbors idolized him and there was a never-ceasing rivalry as to whose lap he should occupy. Melanie especially doted on him. Even in his worst screaming spells, Melanie thought him adorable and said so, adding, “Oh, you precious darling! I just wish you were mine!” Sometimes Scarlett found it hard to dissemble her feelings, for she still thought Aunt Pitty the silliest of old ladies and her vagueness and vaporings irritated her unendurably. She disliked Melanie with a jealous dislike that grew as the days went by, and sometimes she had to leave the room abruptly when Melanie, beaming with loving pride, spoke of Ashley or read his letters aloud. But, all in all, life went on as happily <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5yZWRib3R0b21zaGVlbHMubmV0" target="_blank">red bottom shoes</a> as was possible under the circumstances. Atlanta was more interesting than Savannah or Charleston or Tara and it offered so many strange war-time occupations she had little time to think or mope. But, sometimes, when she blew out the candle and burrowed her head into the pillow, she sighed and thought: “If only Ashley wasn’t married! If only I didn’t have to nurse in that plagued hospital! Oh, if only I could have some beaux!”

Do you realize that we’ve been married five years and never had a home?” “You can stay with us at Aunt Pitty’s. That’s your home,” mumbled Scarlett, toying with a pillow and keeping her eyes down to hide dawning triumph in them as she felt the tide turning her way. “No, but thank you just the same, darling. That would crowd us so. We’ll get a house— Oh, Ashley, do say Yes!” “Scarlett,” said Ashley and his voice was toneless, “look at me.” Startled, she looked up and met gray eyes that were bitter and full of tired futility. “Scarlett, I will come to Atlanta. ... I cannot fight you both.” He turned and walked out of the room. Some of the triumph in her heart was dulled by a nagging fear. The look in his eyes when he spoke had been the same as when he said he would be lost forever if he came to Atlanta. After Suellen and Will married and Carreen went off to Charleston to the convent, Ashley, Melanie and Beau came to Atlanta, bringing Dilcey with them to cook and nurse. Prissy and Pork were left at Tara until <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wb2xvcmFscGhzbGF1cmVub3V0bGV0LmNvbQ__" target="_blank">Polo Outlet</a> such a time as Will could get other darkies to help him in the fields and then they, too, would come to town. The little brick house that Ashley took for his family was on Ivy Street directly behind Aunt Pitty’s house and the two back yards ran together, divided only by a ragged overgrown privet hedge. Melanie had chosen it especially for this reason. She said, on the first morning of her return to Atlanta as she laughed and cried and embraced Scarlett and Aunt Pitty, she had been separated from her loved ones for so long that she could never be close enough to them again. The house had originally been two stories high but the upper floor had been destroyed by shells during the siege and the owner, returning after the surrender, had lacked the money to replace it. He had contented himself with putting a flat roof on the remaining first floor which gave the building the squat, disproportionate <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wb2xvcmFscGhzbGF1cmVub3V0bGV0LmNvbQ__" target="_blank">Ralph Lauren Outlet</a> look of a child’s playhouse built of shoe boxes. The house was high from the ground, built over a large cellar, and the long sweeping flight of stairs which reached it made it look slightly ridiculous. But the flat, squashed look of the place was partly redeemed by the two fine old oaks which shaded it and a dusty-leaved magnolia, splotched with white blossoms, standing beside the front steps. The lawn was wide and green with thick clover and bordering it was a straggling, unkempt privet hedge, interlaced with sweet-smelling honeysuckle vines. Here and there in the grass, roses threw out sprangles from crushed old stems and pink and white crêpe myrtle bloomed as valiantly as if war had not passed over their heads and Yankee horses gnawed their boughs. Scarlett thought it quite the ugliest dwelling she had ever seen but, to Melanie, Twelve Oaks in all its grandeur had not been more beautiful. It was home and she and Ashley and Beau were at last together under their own roof. India Wilkes came back from Macon, where she and Honey had lived since 1864, and took up her residence with her brother, crowding the occupants of the little house. But Ashley and Melanie welcomed her. Times had changed, money was scarce, but nothing had altered the rule of Southern life that <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wb2xvcmFscGhzbGF1cmVub3V0bGV0LmNvbQ__" target="_blank">Polo Ralph Lauren Outlet Store</a> families always made room gladly for indigent or unmarried female relatives. Honey had married and, so India said, married beneath her, a coarse Westerner from Mississippi who had settled in Macon. He had a red face and a loud voice and jolly ways. India had not approved of the match and, not approving, had not been happy in her brother-in-law’s home. She welcomed the news that Ashley now had a home of his own, so she could remove herself from uncongenial surroundings and also from the distressing sight of her sister so fatuously happy with a man unworthy of her. The rest of the family privately thought that the giggling and simple-minded Honey had done far better than could be expected and they marveled that she had caught any man. Her husband was a gentleman and a man of some means; but to India, born in Georgia and reared in Virginia traditions, anyone not from the eastern seaboard was a boor and a barbarian. Probably Honey’s husband was as happy to be relieved of her <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5yZWRib3R0b21zaGVlbHMubmV0" target="_blank">red bottom heels</a> company as she was to leave him, for India was not easy to live with these days. The mantle of spinsterhood was definitely on her shoulders now. She was twenty-five and looked it, and so there was no longer any need for her to try to be attractive. Her pale lashless eyes looked directly and uncompromisingly upon the world and her thin lips were ever set in haughty tightness. There was an air of dignity and pride about her now that, oddly enough, became her better than the determined girlish sweetness of her days at Twelve Oaks. The position she <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5yZWRib3R0b21zaGVlbHMubmV0" target="_blank">red bottoms</a> held was almost that of a widow. Everyone knew that Stuart Tarleton would have married her had he not been killed at Gettysburg, and so she was accorded the respect due a woman who had been wanted if not wed. The six rooms of the little house on Ivy Street were soon scantily furnished with the cheapest pine and oak furniture in Frank’s store for, as Ashley was penniless and forced to buy on credit, he refused anything except the least expensive and bought only the barest necessities. This embarrassed Frank who was fond of Ashley and it distressed Scarlett. Both she and Frank would willingly have given, without any charge, the finest mahogany and carved rosewood in the store, but the Wilkeses obstinately refused. Their house was painfully ugly and bare and Scarlett hated to see Ashley living in the uncarpeted, uncurtained rooms. But he did not seem to notice his surroundings <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5yZWRib3R0b21zaGVlbHMubmV0" target="_blank">red bottom shoes</a> and Melanie, having her own home for the first time since her marriage, was so happy she was actually proud of the place. Scarlett would have suffered agonies of humiliation at having friends find her without draperies and carpets and cushions and the proper number of chairs and teacups and spoons. But Melanie did the honors of her house as though plush curtains and brocade sofas were hers.

Where’s the fighting now?” “And how would three lone women out here in the country know about the war when we haven’t seen a letter or a newspaper in weeks?” said the old lady tartly. “One of our darkies talked to a darky who’d seen a darky who’d been to Jonesboro, and except for that we haven’t heard anything. What they said was that the Yankees were just squatting in Atlanta resting up their men and their horses, but whether it’s true or not you’re as good a judge as I am. Not that they wouldn’t need a rest, after the fight we gave them.” To think you’ve been at Tara all this time and we didn’t know!” Young Miss broke in. “Oh, how I blame myself for not riding over to see! But there’s been so much to do here with most all the darkies gone that I <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wb2xvcmFscGhzbGF1cmVub3V0bGV0LmNvbQ__" target="_blank">Polo Outlet</a> just couldn’t get away. But I should have made time to go. It wasn’t neighborly of me. But, of course, we thought the Yankees had burned Tara like they did Twelve Oaks and the Macintosh house and that your folks had gone to Macon. And we never dreamed you were home, Scarlett.” “Well, how were we to know different when Mr. O’Hara’s darkies came through here so scared they were popeyed and told us the Yankees were going to burn Tara?” Grandma interrupted. “And we could see—” Sally began. “I’m telling this, please,” said Old Miss shortly. “And they said the Yankees were camped all over Tara and your folks were fixing to go to Macon. And then that night we saw the glare of fire over toward Tara and it lasted for hours and it scared our fool darkies so bad they all ran off. What burned?” “All our cotton—a hundred and fifty thousand dollars worth,” said Scarlett bitterly. “Be thankful <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wb2xvcmFscGhzbGF1cmVub3V0bGV0LmNvbQ__" target="_blank">Ralph Lauren Outlet</a> it wasn’t your house,” said Grandma, leaning her chin on her cane. “You can always grow more cotton and you can’t grow a house. By the bye, had you all started picking your cotton?” “No,” said Scarlett, “and now most of it is ruined. I don’t imagine there’s more than three bales left standing, in the far field in the creek bottom, and what earthly good will it do? All our field hands are gone and there’s nobody to pick it.” “Mercy me, all our field hands are gone and there’s nobody to pick it!” mimicked <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wb2xvcmFscGhzbGF1cmVub3V0bGV0LmNvbQ__" target="_blank">Polo Ralph Lauren Outlet Online</a> Grandma and bent a satiric glance on Scarlett “What’s wrong with your own pretty paws, Miss, and those of your sisters?” “Me? Pick cotton?” cried Scarlett aghast, as if Grandma had been suggesting some repulsive crime. “Like a field hand? Like white trash? Like the Slattery women?” “White trash, indeed! Well, isn’t this generation soft and ladylike! Let me tell you, Miss, when I was a girl my father lost all his money and I wasn’t above doing honest work with my hands and in the fields too, till Pa got enough money to <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5yZWRib3R0b21zaGVlbHMubmV0" target="_blank">red bottom heels</a> buy some more darkies. I’ve hoed my row and I’ve picked my cotton and I can do it again if I have to. And it looks like I’ll have to. White trash, indeed!” “Oh, but Mama Fontaine,” cried her daughter-in-law, casting imploring glances at the two girls, urging them to help her smooth the old lady’s feathers. “That was so long ago, a different day entirely, and times have changed.” “Times never change when there’s a need for honest work to be done,” stated the sharp-eyed old lady, refusing to be soothed. “And I’m ashamed for your mother, Scarlett, to hear you stand there and talk as though honest work made white trash out of nice people. ‘When Adam delved and Eve span’—” To change the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5yZWRib3R0b21zaGVlbHMubmV0" target="_blank">red bottoms</a> subject, Scarlett hastily questioned: “What about the Tarletons and the Calverts? Were they burned out? Have they refugeed to Macon?” “The Yankees never got to the Tarletons. They’re off the main road, like we are, but they did get to the Calverts and they stole all their stock and poultry and got all the darkies to run off with them—” Sally began. Grandma interrupted. “Hah! They promised all the black wenches silk dresses and gold earbobs—that’s what they did. And Cathleen Calvert said some of the troopers went off with the black fools behind them on their saddles. Well, all they’ll get will be yellow babies and I can’t say that Yankee blood will improve the stock.” “Oh, Mama Fontaine!” “Don’t pull such a shocked face, Jane. We’re <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5yZWRib3R0b21zaGVlbHMubmV0" target="_blank">red bottom shoes</a> all married, aren’t we? And, God knows, we’ve seen mulatto babies before this.” “Why didn’t they burn the Calverts’ house?” “The house was saved by the combined accents of the second Mrs. Calvert and that Yankee overseer of hers, Hilton,” said Old Miss, who always referred to the ex-governess as the “second Mrs. Calvert,” although the first Mrs. Calvert had been dead twenty years.

Yes, the conquerors did approve of her and her family and her neighbors did not. She knew all the things the town was saying about her. And now even Peter disapproved of her to the point of not caring to be seen in public with her. That was the last straw.
<br />Heretofore she had been careless of public opinion, careless and a little contemptuous. But Peter’s words caused fierce resentment to burn in her breast, drove her to a defensive position, made her <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wb2xvcmFscGhzbGF1cmVub3V0bGV0LmNvbQ__" target="_blank">Polo Outlet</a> suddenly dislike her neighbors as much as she disliked the Yankees.
<br />“Why should they care what I do?” she thought. “They must think I enjoy associating with Yankees and working like a field hand. They’re just making a hard job harder for me. But I don’t care what they think. I won’t let myself care. I can’t afford to care now. But some day—some day—”
<br />Oh some day! When there was security in her world again, then she would sit back and fold her hands and be a great lady as Ellen had been. She would be helpless and sheltered, as a lady should be, and then everyone would approve of her. Oh, how grand she would be when she had money again! Then she could permit herself to be kind and gentle, as Ellen <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wb2xvcmFscGhzbGF1cmVub3V0bGV0LmNvbQ__" target="_blank">Ralph Lauren Outlet</a> had been, and thoughtful of other people and of the proprieties, too. She would not be driven by fears, day and night, and life would be a placid, unhurried affair. She would have time to play with her children and listen to their lessons. There would be long warm afternoons when ladies would call and, amid the rustlings of taffeta petticoats and the rhythmic harsh cracklings of palmetto fans, she would serve tea and delicious sandwiches and cakes and leisurely gossip the hours away. And she would be so kind to those who were suffering misfortune, take baskets to the poor and soup and jelly to the sick and “air” those less fortunate in her fine carriage. She would be a lady in the true Southern manner, as her mother had been. And then, everyone would love her as they had loved Ellen and they would say how unselfish she was and call her “Lady Bountiful.”
<br />Her pleasure in these thoughts of the future was un-dimmed by any realization that she had no real desire to be unselfish or charitable or kind. All she wanted was the reputation for possessing these qualities. But the meshes of her brain were too wide, too coarse, to filter such small differences. It was enough that some day, when she had money, everyone <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wb2xvcmFscGhzbGF1cmVub3V0bGV0LmNvbQ__" target="_blank">Polo Ralph Lauren Outlet Store</a> would approve of her.
<br />Some day! But not now. Not now, in spite of what anyone might say of her. Now, there was no time to be a great lady.
<br />Peter was as good as his word. Aunt Pitty did get into a state, and Peter’s misery developed overnight to such proportions that he never drove the buggy again. Thereafter Scarlett drove alone and the calluses which had begun to leave her palms came back again.
<br />So the spring months went by, the cool rains of April passing into the warm balm of green May weather. The weeks were packed with work and worry and the handicaps of increasing pregnancy, with old <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5yZWRib3R0b21zaGVlbHMubmV0" target="_blank">red bottom heels</a> friends growing cooler and her family increasingly more kind, more maddeningly solicitous and more completely blind to what was driving her. During those days of anxiety and struggle there was only one dependable, understanding person in her world, and that person was Rhett Butler. It was odd that he of all people should appear in this light, for he was as unstable as quicksilver and as perverse as a demon fresh from the pit. But he gave her sympathy, something she had never had from anyone and never expected from him.
<br />Frequently he was out of town on those mysterious trips to New Orleans which he never explained but which she felt sure, in a faintly jealous way, were connected with a woman—or women. But after Uncle Peter’s refusal to drive her, he remained in Atlanta for longer and longer intervals.
<br />While in town, he spent most of his time gambling in the rooms above <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5yZWRib3R0b21zaGVlbHMubmV0" target="_blank">red bottoms</a> the Girl of the Period Saloon, or in Belle Watling’s bar hobnobbing with the wealthier of the Yankees and Carpetbaggers in money-making schemes which made the townspeople detest him even more than his cronies. He did not call at the house now, probably in deference to the feelings of Frank and Pitty who would have been outraged at a male caller while Scarlett was in a delicate condition. But she met him by accident almost every day. Time and again, he came riding up to her buggy when she was passing through lonely stretches of Peachtree road and <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5yZWRib3R0b21zaGVlbHMubmV0" target="_blank">red bottom shoes</a> Decatur road where the mills lay. He always drew rein and talked and sometimes he tied his horse to the back of the buggy and drove her on her rounds. She tired more easily these days than she liked to admit and she was always silently grateful when he took the reins. He always left her before they reached the town again but all Atlanta knew about their meetings, and it gave the gossips something new to add to the long list of Scarlett’s affronts to the proprieties.

See if you can tell me the truth about why you wanted to lead me into wedlock.” There was a suave, almost teasing note in his voice and she took heart. Perhaps everything wasn’t lost, after all. Of course, she had ruined any hope of marriage but, even in her despair, she was glad. There was something about this immobile man which frightened her, so that now the thought of marrying him was fearful. But perhaps if she was clever and played on his sympathies and his memories, she could secure a loan. She pulled her face into a placating and childlike expression. “Oh, Rhett, you can help me so much—if you’ll just be sweet.” “There’s nothing I like better than being—sweet.” “Rhett, for old friendship’s sake, I want you to do me a favor.” “So, at last the horny-handed lady comes to her real mission. I feared that ‘visiting the sick and the imprisoned’ was not your proper role. What do you want? Money?” The bluntness of his question ruined all hopes of leading up to the matter in any circuitous and sentimental <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wb2xvcmFscGhzbGF1cmVub3V0bGV0LmNvbQ__" target="_blank">Polo Outlet</a> way. “Don’t be mean, Rhett,” she coaxed. “I do want some money. I want you to lend me three hundred dollars.” “The truth at last. Talking love and thinking money. How truly feminine! Do you need the money badly?” “Oh, ye— Well, not so terribly but I could use it” “Three “hundred dollars. That’s a vast amount of money. What do you want it for?” “To pay taxes on Tara.” “So you want to borrow some money. Well, since you’re so businesslike, I’ll be businesslike too. What collateral will you give me?” “What what?” “Collateral. Security on my investment. Of course, I don’t want to lose all that money.” His voice was deceptively smooth, almost silky, but she did not notice. Maybe everything would turn out nicely after all. “My earrings.” “I’m not interested in earrings.” “I’ll give you a mortgage on Tara.” “Now just what would I do with a farm?” “Well, you could—you could—it’s a good plantation. And you wouldn’t lose. I’d pay you back out of next year’s cotton.” “I’m not so sure.” He tilted back in his chair and stuck his hands in his pockets. “Cotton prices are dropping. Times are so hard <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wb2xvcmFscGhzbGF1cmVub3V0bGV0LmNvbQ__" target="_blank">Ralph Lauren Outlet</a> and money’s so tight.” “Oh, Rhett, you are teasing me! You know you have millions!” There was a warm dancing malice in his eyes as he surveyed her. “So everything is going nicely and you don’t need the money very badly. Well, I’m glad to hear that. I like to know that all is well with old friends.” “Oh, Rhett, for God’s sake ...” she began desperately, her courage and control breaking, “Do lower your voice. You don’t want the Yankees to hear you, I hope. Did anyone ever tell you you had eyes like a cat—a cat in the dark?” “Rhett, don’t! I’ll tell you everything. I do need the money so badly. I—I lied about everything being all right. Everything’s as wrong as it could be. Father is—is—he’s not himself. He’s been queer ever since Mother died and he can’t help me any. He’s just like a child. And we haven’t a single field hand to work the cotton and there’s so many to feed, thirteen of us. And the taxes—they are so high. Rhett, I’ll tell you everything. For over a year we’ve been just this side of starvation. Oh, you don’t know! You can’t know! We’ve never had enough to eat and it’s terrible to <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wb2xvcmFscGhzbGF1cmVub3V0bGV0LmNvbQ__" target="_blank">Polo Ralph Lauren Outlet Online</a> wake up hungry and go to sleep hungry. And we haven’t any warm clothes and the children are always cold and sick and—” “Where did you get the pretty dress?” “It’s made out of Mother’s curtains,” she answered, too desperate to lie about this shame. “I could stand being hungry and cold but now—now the Carpetbaggers have raised our taxes. And the money’s got to be paid right away. And I haven’t any money except one five-dollar gold piece. I’ve got to have money for the taxes! Don’t you see? If I don’t pay them, I’ll—we’ll lose Tara and we just can’t lose it! I can’t let it go!” “Why didn’t you tell me all this at first instead of preying on my susceptible heart—always weak where pretty ladies are concerned? No, Scarlett, don’t cry. You’ve tried every trick except that one and I don’t think I could stand it. My feelings are already lacerated with disappointment at discovering it was my money and not my charming self you wanted.” She remembered <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5yZWRib3R0b21zaGVlbHMubmV0" target="_blank">red bottom heels</a> that he frequently told bald truths about himself when he spoke mockingly—mocking himself as well as others, and she hastily looked up at him. Were his feelings really hurt? Did he really care about her? Had he been on the verge of a proposal when he saw her palms? Or had he only been leading up to another such odious proposal as he had made twice before? If he really cared about her, perhaps she could smooth him down. But his black eyes raked her in no lover-like way and he was laughing softly. “I don’t like your collateral. I’m no planter. What else have <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5yZWRib3R0b21zaGVlbHMubmV0" target="_blank">red bottoms</a> you to offer?” Well, she had come to it at last. Now for it! She drew a deep breath and met his eyes squarely, all coquetry and airs gone as her spirit rushed out to grapple that which she feared most. “I—I have myself.” “Yes?” Her jaw line tightened to squareness and her eyes went emerald. “You remember that night on Aunt Pitty’s porch, during the siege? You said—you said then that you wanted me.” He leaned back carelessly in his chair and looked into her tense face and his own dark face was inscrutable. Something flickered behind his eyes but he said nothing. “You said—you said you’d never wanted a woman as much as you wanted me. If you still want me, you can have me, Rhett, I’ll do anything you say but, for God’s sake, write me a draft for the money! My word’s good. I swear it. I won’t go back on it. I’ll put it in <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5yZWRib3R0b21zaGVlbHMubmV0" target="_blank">red bottom shoes</a> writing if you like.” He looked at her oddly, still inscrutable and as she hurried on she could not tell if he were amused or repelled. If he would only say something, anything! She felt her cheeks getting hot. “I have got to have the money soon, Rhett. They’ll turn us out in the road and that damned overseer of Father’s will own the place and—” “Just a minute. What makes you think I still want you? What makes you think you are worth three hundred dollars? Most women don’t come that high.” She blushed to her hair line and her humiliation was complete. “Why are you doing this? Why not let the farm go and live at Miss Pittypat’s. You own half that house.”

Her tired brain moved so slowly. She raised her hands to her head as wearily as if the air were water against which her arms struggled. She took the gourd from between the glass and bottle and looked in it. There was some whisky left in the bottom, how much she could not tell in the uncertain light. Strange that the sharp smell did not offend her nostrils now. She drank slowly but this time the liquid did not burn, only a dull warmth followed. She set down the empty gourd and looked about her. This was all a dream, this smoke-filled dim room, the scrawny girls, Mammy shapeless and huge crouching beside the bed, Dilcey a still bronze image with the sleeping pink morsel against her dark breast—all a dream from which she would awake, to smell bacon frying in the kitchen, hear the throaty laughter of the negroes and the creaking of wagons fieldward bound, and Ellen’s gentle insistent hand upon her. Then she discovered <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wb2xvcmFscGhzbGF1cmVub3V0bGV0LmNvbQ__" target="_blank">Polo Outlet</a> she was in her own room, on her own bed, faint moonlight pricking the darkness, and Mammy and Dilcey were undressing her. The torturing stays no longer pinched her waist and she could breathe deeply and quietly to the bottom of her lungs and her abdomen. She felt her stockings being stripped gently from her and heard Mammy murmuring indistinguishable comforting sounds as she bathed her blistered feet. How cool the water was, how good to lie here in softness, like a child. She sighed and relaxed and after a time which might have been a year or a second, she was alone and the room was brighter as the rays of the moon streamed in across the bed. She did not know she was drunk, drunk with fatigue and whisky. She only knew she had left her tired body and floated somewhere above it where there was no pain and weariness and her brain saw things with an inhuman clarity. She was seeing things with new eyes for, somewhere along the long road to Tara, she had left her girlhood behind her. She was no longer plastic clay, yielding <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wb2xvcmFscGhzbGF1cmVub3V0bGV0LmNvbQ__" target="_blank">Ralph Lauren Outlet</a> imprint to each new experience. The clay had hardened, some time in this indeterminate day which had lasted a thousand years. Tonight was the last time she would ever be ministered to as a child. She was a woman now and youth was gone. No, she could not, would not, turn to Gerald’s or Ellen’s families. The O’Haras did not take charity. The O’Haras looked after their own. Her burdens <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wb2xvcmFscGhzbGF1cmVub3V0bGV0LmNvbQ__" target="_blank">Polo Ralph Lauren Outlet Store</a> were her own and burdens were for shoulders strong enough to bear them. She thought without surprise, looking down from her height, that her shoulders were strong enough to bear anything now, having borne the worst that could ever happen to her. She could not desert Tara; she belonged to the red acres far more than they could ever belong to her. Her roots went deep into the blood-colored soil and sucked up life, as did the cotton. She would stay at Tara and keep it, somehow, keep her father and her sisters, Melanie and Ashley’s child, the negroes. Tomorrow—oh, tomorrow! Tomorrow she would fit the yoke about her neck. Tomorrow there would be so many things to do. Go to <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5yZWRib3R0b21zaGVlbHMubmV0" target="_blank">red bottom heels</a> Twelve Oaks and the Macintosh place and see if anything was left in the deserted gardens, go to the river swamps and beat them for straying hogs and chickens, go to Jonesboro and Lovejoy with Ellen’s jewelry—there must be someone left there who would sell something to eat. Tomorrow—tomorrow—her brain ticked slowly and more slowly, like a clock running down, but the clarity of vision persisted. Of a sudden, the oft-told family tales to which she had listened since babyhood, listened half-bored, impatient and but partly comprehending, were crystal clear. Gerald, penniless, had raised Tara; Ellen had risen above some mysterious sorrow; Grandfather Robillard. surviving the wreck of Napoleon’s throne, had founded his fortunes anew on the fertile Georgia coast; Great-grandfather Prudhomme had carved a small kingdom out of the dark jungles of Haiti, lost it, and lived to see his name honored in Savannah. There were <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5yZWRib3R0b21zaGVlbHMubmV0" target="_blank">red bottoms</a> the Scarletts who had fought with the Irish Volunteers for a free Ireland and been hanged for their pains and the O’Haras who died at the Boyne, battling to the end for what was theirs. All had suffered crushing misfortunes and had not been crushed. They had not been broken by the crash of empires, the machetes of revolting slaves, war, rebellion, proscription, confiscation. Malign fate had broken their necks, perhaps, but never their hearts. They had not whined, they had fought. And when they died, they <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5yZWRib3R0b21zaGVlbHMubmV0" target="_blank">red bottom shoes</a> died spent but unquenched. All of those shadowy folks whose blood flowed in her veins seemed to move quietly in the moonlit room. And Scarlett was not surprised to see them, these kinsmen who had taken the worst that fate could send and hammered it into the best. Tara was her fate, her fight, and she must conquer it. She turned drowsily on her side, a slow creeping blackness enveloping her mind. Were they really there, whispering wordless encouragement to her, or was this part of her dream? “Whether you are there or not,” she murmured sleepily, “good night—and thank you.”

Ah knows it an’ you knows it, but dem Yankee folks doan know it an’ dey doan want ter know it, Huccome dey come mixin’ in our bizness, Miss Scarlett? Dey doan unnerstan’ us Confedruts.” Scarlett said nothing for she was still burning with the wrath she had not exploded in the Yankee women’s faces. The two drove home in silence. Peter’s sniffles stopped and his underlip began to protrude gradually until it stuck out alarmingly. His indignation was mounting, now that the initial hurt was subsiding. Scarlett thought: What damnably queer people Yankees are! Those women seemed to think that because Uncle Peter was black, he had no ears to hear with and no feelings, as tender as their own, to be hurt. They did not know that negroes had to be handled gently, as though they were <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wb2xvcmFscGhzbGF1cmVub3V0bGV0LmNvbQ__" target="_blank">Polo Outlet</a> children, directed, praised, petted, scolded. They didn’t understand negroes or the relations between the negroes and their former masters. Yet they had fought a war to free them. And having freed them, they didn’t want to have anything to do with them, except to use them to terrorize Southerners. They didn’t like them, didn’t trust them, didn’t understand them, and yet their constant cry was that Southerners didn’t know how to get along with them. Not trust a darky! Scarlett trusted them far more than most white people, certainly more than she trusted any Yankee. There were qualities of loyalty and tirelessness and love in them that no strain could break, no money could buy. She thought of the faithful few who remained at Tara in the face of the Yankee invasion when they could have fled or joined the troops for lives of leisure. But they had stayed. She thought of Dilcey toiling in the cotton fields beside her, of Pork risking his life in neighboring hen houses that the family might eat, of Mammy coming to Atlanta with her to keep <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wb2xvcmFscGhzbGF1cmVub3V0bGV0LmNvbQ__" target="_blank">Ralph Lauren Outlet</a> her from doing wrong. She thought of the servants of her neighbors who had stood loyally beside their white owners, protecting their mistresses while the men were at the front, refugeeing with them through the terrors of the war, nursing the wounded, burying the dead, comforting the bereaved, working, begging, stealing to keep food on the tables. And even now, with the Freedmen’s Bureau promising all manner of wonders, they still stuck with their white folks and worked much harder than they ever worked in slave times. But the Yankees didn’t understand these things and would never understand them. “Yet they set you free,” she said aloud. “No, Ma’m! Dey din’ sot me free. Ah wouldn’ let no sech trash sot me free,” said Peter indignantly. “Ah still b’longs ter Miss Pitty an’ w’en Ah dies she gwine lay me in de Hamilton <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wb2xvcmFscGhzbGF1cmVub3V0bGV0LmNvbQ__" target="_blank">Polo Ralph Lauren Outlet Online</a> buhyin’ groun’ whar Ah b’longs. ... Mah Miss gwine ter be in a state w’en Ah tells her ‘bout how you let dem Yankee women ‘sult me.” “I did no such thing!” cried Scarlett, startled. “You did so, Miss Scarlett,” said Peter, pushing out his lip even farther. “De pint is, needer you nor me had no bizness bein’ wid Yankees, so dey could ‘sult me. Ef you hadn’t talked wid dem, dey wouldn’ had no chance ter treat me lak a mule or a Affikun. An’ you din’ tek up fer me, needer.” “I did, too!” said Scarlett, stung by the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5yZWRib3R0b21zaGVlbHMubmV0" target="_blank">red bottom heels</a> criticism. “Didn’t I tell them you were one of the family?” “Dat ain’ tekkin’ up. Dat’s jes’ a fac’,” said Peter. “Miss Scarlett, you ain’ got no bizness havin’ no truck wid Yankees. Ain’ no other ladies doin’ it. You wouldn’ ketch Miss Pitty wipin’ her lil shoes on sech trash. An’ she ain’ gwine lake it w’en she hear ‘bout whut dey said ‘bout me.” Peter’s criticism hurt worse than anything Frank or Aunt Pitty or the neighbors had said and it so annoyed her she longed to shake the old darky until his toothless gums clapped together. What Peter said was true but she hated to hear it from a negro and a family negro, too. Not to stand high in the opinion of one’s servants was as humiliating a thing as could happen to a Southerner. “A ole pet!” Peter grumbled. “Ah specs Miss Pitty ain’t gwine want me ter drive you roun’ no mo’ after dat. No, Ma’m!” “Aunt Pitty will want you to drive me as usual,” she said sternly, “so let’s hear no more about it.” “Ah’ll git a mizry in mah back,” warned Peter darkly. “Mah back huttin’ me so bad dis minute Ah kain sceercely set up. Mah Miss ain’ gwine want me ter do no drivin’ w’en Ah got a mizry. ... Miss Scarlett, it ain’ gwine do <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5yZWRib3R0b21zaGVlbHMubmV0" target="_blank">red bottoms</a> you no good ter stan’ high wid de Yankees an’ de w’ite trash, ef yo’ own folks doan ‘prove of you.” That was as accurate a summing up of the situation as could be made and Scarlett relapsed into infuriated silence. Yes, the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5yZWRib3R0b21zaGVlbHMubmV0" target="_blank">red bottom shoes</a> conquerors did approve of her and her family and her neighbors did not. She knew all the things the town was saying about her. And now even Peter disapproved of her to the point of not caring to be seen in public with her. That was the last straw. Heretofore she had been careless of public opinion, careless and a little contemptuous. But Peter’s words caused fierce resentment to burn in her breast, drove her to a defensive position, made her suddenly dislike her neighbors as much as she disliked the Yankees. “Why should they care what I do?” she thought. “They must think I enjoy associating with Yankees and working like a field hand. They’re just making a hard job harder for me. But I don’t care what they think. I won’t let myself care. I can’t afford to care now. But some day—some day—”

Why have you removed me from the house of my forebears?” “never mind that! How did Snape punish Ginny, Neville, and Luna?” asked Harry urgently. “Professor Snape sent them into the Forbidden Forest, to do some work for the oaf, Hagrid.” “Hagrid’s not an oaf!” said Hermione shrilly. “And Snape might’ve though that was a punishment,” said Harry, “buy Ginny, Neville, and <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5yZWRib3R0b21zaGVlbHMubmV0" target="_blank">red bottoms</a> Luna probably had a good laugh with Hagrid. The Forbidden Forest . . . they’ve faced plenty worse than the Forbidden Forest, big deal!” He felt relieved; he had been imagining horrors, the Cruciatus Curse at the very least. “What <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5yZWRib3R0b21zaGVlbHMubmV0" target="_blank">red bottom shoes</a> we really wanted to know, Professor Black, is whether anyone else has, um, taken out the sword at all? Maybe it’s been taken away for cleaning—or something!” Phineas Nigellus paused again in his struggles to free his eyes and sniggered. “Muggle-born,” he said, “Goblin-made armor does not require cleaning, simple girl. Goblin’s silver repels mundane dirt, imbibing only that which strengthens it.” “Don’t call <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jaGVhcHRydWVyZWxpZ2lvbmplYW5zb3V0bGV0Lm5ldC8_" target="_blank">Cheap True Religion Jeans</a> Hermione simple,” said Harry. “I grow weary of contradiction,” said Phineas Nigellus. “perhaps it is time for me to return to the headmaster’s office.?” Still blindfolded, he began groping the side of his frame, trying to <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jaGVhcHRydWVyZWxpZ2lvbmplYW5zb3V0bGV0Lm5ldC8_" target="_blank">True Religion Jeans Outlet</a> feel his way out of his picture and back into the one at Hogwarts. Harry had a sudden inspiration. “Dumbledore! Can’t you bring us Dumbledore?” “I beg your pardon?” asked Phineas Nigellus. “Professor Dumbledore’s portrait—couldn’t you bring him along, here, into yours?” Phineas Nigellus turned his face in the direction of Harry’s voice. “Evidently it is not only Muggle-borns who are ignorant, Potter. The portraits of Hogwarts may commune with each other, but they cannot travel outside of the castle except to visit <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jaGVhcHRydWVyZWxpZ2lvbmplYW5zb3V0bGV0Lm5ldC8_" target="_blank">True Religion Jeans Sale</a> a painting of themselves elsewhere.

Before Ginny took it out, I mean?” Phineas snorted impatiently. “I believe that the last time I saw the sword <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5yZWRib3R0b21zaGVlbHMubmV0" target="_blank">red bottom heels</a> of Gryffindor leave its case was when Professor Dumbledore used it to break open a ring.” Hermione whipped around to look at Harry. Neither of them dared say more in front of Phineas Nigellus, who had at least managed to locate the exit. “Well, good night to you,” he said a little waspishly, and he began to move out of sight again. Only the edge of his hat brim remained in view when Harry gave a sudden shout. “Wait! Have you told Snape you saw this?” Phineas Nigellus stuck his blindfolded head back into the picture. “Professor Snape has more important <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5yZWRib3R0b21zaGVlbHMubmV0" target="_blank">red bottoms</a> things on his mind that the many eccentricities of Albus Dumbledore. Good-bye, Potter!” And with that, he vanished completely, leaving behind him nothing but his murky backdrop. “Harry!” Hermione cried. “I know!” Harry shouted. Unable to contain himself, he punched the air; it was more than he had dared to hope for. He strode up and down the tent, feeling that he could have run a mile; he did not <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5yZWRib3R0b21zaGVlbHMubmV0" target="_blank">red bottom shoes</a> even feel hungry anymore. Hermione was squashing Phineas Nigellus’s back into the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jaGVhcHRydWVyZWxpZ2lvbmplYW5zb3V0bGV0Lm5ldC8_" target="_blank">Cheap True Religion Jeans</a> beaded bag; when she had fastened the clasp she threw the bag aside and raised a shining face to Harry. “The sword can destroy Horcruxes! Goblin-made blades imbibe only that which strengthens them—Harry, that sword’s impregnated with basilisk venom!” “And Dumbledore didn’t five it to me because he still needed it, he wanted to use it on the locket—” “—and he must have realized they wouldn’t let you have it if he put it in his will—” “—so he made a copy—” “—and put a fake in the glass case—” “—and he left the real one—where?” They <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jaGVhcHRydWVyZWxpZ2lvbmplYW5zb3V0bGV0Lm5ldC8_" target="_blank">True Religion Jeans Outlet</a> gazed at east other Harry felt that the answer was dangling invisibly in the air above them, tantalizingly close. Why hadn’t Dumbledore told him? Or had he, in fact, told Harry, but Harry had not realized it at the time?” “Think!” whispered Hermione. “Think! Where would he have left it?” “Not at Hogwarts,” said Harry, resuming his pacing. “Somewhere in Hogsmeade?” suggested Hermione. “The Shrieking Shack?” said Harry. “Nobody ever goes in there.” “But Snape knows how to get in, wouldn’t that be a bit risky?” “Dumbledore trusted Snape,” Harry reminded her. “Not enough to tell him that he had swapped the swords,” said Hermione. “Yeah, you’re right!” said Harry, and he felt even more cheered at the thought that Dumbledore had had some reservations, however faint, about Snape’s trustworthiness. “So, would he have hidden <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jaGVhcHRydWVyZWxpZ2lvbmplYW5zb3V0bGV0Lm5ldC8_" target="_blank">True Religion Jeans Sale</a> the sword well away from Hogsmeade, then? What d’you reckon, Ron? Ron?” Harry looked around. For one bewildered moment he thought that Ron had left the tent, then realized that Ron was lying in the shadow of a bunk, looking stony. “Oh, remembered me, have you?” he said. “What?” Ron snorted as he stared up at the underside of the upper bunk. “You two carry on. Don’t let me spoil your fun.” Perplexed, Harry looked to Hermione for help, but she shook her head, apparently as nonplussed as he was.

Is it possible that Ariana Dumbledore was the first person to die “for the greater good”? The chapter ended here and Harry looked up. Hermione had reached the bottom of the page before him. She tugged the book out of Harry’s hands, looking a little alarmed by his expression, and closed it without looking at it, as though hiding something indecent. “Harry ---” But he shook his head.

I know Bathilda thought it was all just talk, but 'For the Greater Good' became Grindelwald's slogan, his justification for all the atrocities he committed later.

But on the other hand, even Rita can't pretend that they knew each other for more than a few months one summer when they were both really young, and ---&quot; &quot;I thought you'd say that,&quot; said Harry.

<br />like Mafalda, though her hair was still gray in places. “Unstopper it for me, Harry, my 
<br />hands are shaking.” 
<br />          Harry wrenched the stopper off the little bottle, Hermione took it and poured three 
<br />drops of the potion onto the bleeding wound. Greenish smoke billowed upward and when
