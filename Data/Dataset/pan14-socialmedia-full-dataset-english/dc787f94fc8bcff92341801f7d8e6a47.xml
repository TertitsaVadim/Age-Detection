One the most popular sport watch is the Garmin 305.<br /><br />With GPS receiver to monitor speed and distance, heart rate monitor and calorie tracker to monitor workout intensity and other features, Garmin 305 has become one of the best sport watches in the market.<br /><br />By following these steps, you can optimize the Garmin 305 so you can practice better and more effective.<br /><br />Step 1 <br />You can monitor your progress in the Training Center By the time you buy a Garmin 305, you'll get a USB cable to integrate easily with the Training Center program installed on your computer. After exercise, connect the Garmin Forerunner 305 to your computer and then transfer your workout data to the computer. There, you will be able to see a graph that compares the heart rate, speed and distance that occur during exercise. With this feature, you can see weaknesses, such as hills or recovery areas, by overlaying the workout data onto maps of the course. You can use this data to plan your next workout so you can improve your performance.<br /><br />Step 2 <br />You can use the 12 data screens to get direct feedback during the workout. The data that you can see on the screen including calories burned, grade and direction, elevation, lap and pace modes, heart rate tracking and distance travelled. You can make adjustment up to three main data screens that are important to your workout. These data will be stored in internal memory that can later be transferred to the Training Center.<br /><br />Step 3 <br />Add foot pod accessory and heart rate monitor for extra performance data. Foot pod allows you to practice indoors to monitor distance, pace and calories burned. Connect Foot Pod to your sport shoe by tying shoe laces through the foot pod. Foot pod is on standby until you install or move it and see the LED light blink three times. After pairing the Foot Pod to the Garmin 305, Garmin 305 will automatically recognize the initiated foot pod. You can calibrate the foot pod to improve accuracy. I found that this blog demonstrated this simply on this <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fexternalhardrivereviews.com%2F506%2Fcar-seat-buy%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://externalhardrivereviews.com/506/car-seat-buy/</a> web site.<br /><br />Just as the Foot Pod, heart rate monitor is on standby, ready to send data to the Garmin 305. Put the heart rate monitor just below the breastbone with the Garmin logo right-side up. Set heart rate monitor to the Garmin 305 by selecting the heart rate function in the data screen. The Garmin 305 will automatically recognize the heart rate monitor after the initial.<br /><br />Step 4 <br />You can compete against virtual partner. Choose the Virtual Partner function to motivate you during the workout. For example, if your goal is running as far as 10 miles at a pace of 6:00 / mile, then you can adjust the Virtual Partner to a 6:00 / mile pace. During the workout, the 305 will monitor your performance as compared with the virtual partner and constantly remind you when you require to improve the pace.<br /><br />Warnings and Tips: <br />- Read the manual before operating. <br />- Consult a medical professional before commencing an exercise program.

Court sports such as basketball, racquetball and tennis present unique problems for athletes, whether they're professionals or weekend warriors. But preparation and common sense go a long way toward prevention. I found that this web page explained this really well on this <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Faskbusinesses.com%2F2507%2Ffind-business-cards-large-graphic-candy-prints%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://askbusinesses.com/2507/find-business-cards-large-graphic-candy-prints/</a> weblog.<br /><br />Hard surfaces and sports calling for fast, lateral movements are two characteristics of indoor sports that can contribute to injuries. One of the most frequently encountered court injuries is the common ankle sprain, due to the lateral aspect of those sports and, especially in basketball, the potential for stepping on a competitor's foot.<br /><br />Other court injuries are more too much shock-related stress, such as stress fractures in the foot or tibia. Stress fractures can be hard to detect and many times people with stress fractures will continue to play and delay the correct diagnosis.<br /><br />The most frequent site for a stress fracture is the metatarsal bone, and in these fractures there can be a lot of swelling in the forefoot. But stress fractures can occur in any of the 26 bones of the foot without severe symptoms. Some are more common than others, but all of them can happen in court sports. In the stronger, more dense area of the mid-foot, stress fractures can take a long time to diagnose, and if not properly diagnosed, can lead to devastating consequences. Whether competing in court sports on an organized level or in everyday use, the foot should not hurt. If pain persists, consult a foot and ankle surgeon.<br /><br />Another common injury site is the heel. Persistent heel pain can be a plantar fascia injury or a heel spur. The plantar fascia is a thin, very strong tissue band that supports the arch of the foot, stretching from the heel to the ball of the foot. As the arch falls, the band of tissue is under increasing tension and the weakest link is where the tissue attaches to the bottom of the heel. Over time and with repeated shocks, micro-events can occur and cause the fascia to tear from the heel, resulting in bone spurs.<br /><br />Ninety-nine percent of the time, conservative care is effective in relieving painful heels. For the few who don't respond, surgery may be considered. Foot and ankle surgeons frequently see injuries to the Achilles tendon and other tendons about the ankle that often could be prevented. Achilles and calf stretching can go a long way toward prevention. A ruptured Achilles tendon requires surgery and is very common in older athletes who aren't flexible and don't warm-up.<br /><br />For a gentle stretching of the lower extremities and the Achilles tendon, lean against a table or wall, placing one foot behind the other. Point the toes slightly inward and roll the ankle toward the outside. Gently lean forward and feel the stretch high up into the calf muscle. Always roll the weight to the outside border of the foot and never stretch to the point of producing pain.<br /><br />Additional tips include:<br /><br />1. Buy new, quality athletic shoes and replace them frequently (at least every 6 months).<br />2. Have the proper footgear for the sport; running shoes are not what you shold be wearing for sports such as basketball due to their lack of lateral support.<br />3. Seek appropriate arch support; flat and high arches often call for custom-made orthotics in shoes.<br />4. Avoid too much, too hard, and too soon syndrome; start slowly to transition between activities or the stress will take you out of the game quickly.<br />5. In children, be aware of the potential for injuries of the growth plate in the heel. Persistent heel pain is more than simple overuse; kids should stop participation immediately and a diagnosis should be sought. Boys and girls often go from soccer season right into basketball and the collective shock from running and the pull of the Achilles can cause growth plate damage.<br /><br />Start your winter sports season off without a bang! Follow these tips and try to avoid the common pitfalls associated with indoor sports.

Many of these folks are enjoying this weather from the comfort of their own homes, peering out their windows. Perhaps they are cuddled up sitting by the fire enjoying a good book or a favorite movie. Then there are the people who are outside in this inclement weather, whether it be by choice or necessity, and who need to have the best gear to keep them warm and dry. Muck arctic sport boots would qualify as a very high quality, durable, warm and waterproof choice when you are faced with these circumstances. I found that this site showed this nicely on this <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fbestwirelesssurroundsoundsystem.com%2F603%2Ffast-computer-run-built-computer-post-info%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://bestwirelesssurroundsoundsystem.com/603/fast-computer-run-built-computer-post-info/</a>  webpage.<br /><br />When choosing to be outside in the cold, wet weather, to enjoy ice fishing, hunting, snowmobiling and other adventurous outdoor activities, you need warm, dry feet. And, if you are required to work in the outdoors during the cold, wet winter months, you also need the best footwear. Nothing kills a great day of fun or a productive day of work faster than cold, wet feet. These cold weather arctic sport boots provide terrific protection against the elements.<br /><br />The muck boots arctic boots are well insulated, and rated to keep you plenty warm in temperatures that are well below zero. They are incredibly comfortable, with a form fitting footbed that will adjust perfectly to your own foot and give you the support you need to be on your feet for the long haul. The snug upper fits closely to your calf, sealing warmth in and cold out. And, deep snow is no threat, since these boots are high enough to keep the snow out, even when you are trudging through the drifts.<br /><br />These arctic boots are a practical alternative to other work boots. They adapt well to various weather conditions, work well for either work or play situations, and hold up for years. Mud washes off the full rubber exterior, so they never look like the sloppy work boots hanging around in the corner of your garage. Many of these Arctic Sport wearers find they can actually even wear these boots in public without feeling out of style. They are lightweight enough to walk a distance in, too, without blistering or chafing.

After all, they are most important, because what's the point of taking all the trouble when you can't even walk around properly?

I want to talk today about grip strength training methods and making them complete. Grip strength training has actually become a very controversial subject as its popularity begins to increase. It is a large issue in sports, music and ergonomics and has even become a sport of its own now. Grip competitions are fascinating and very exciting. Grip strength competitors are ripping phone books and bending bolts among many other activities. It is something to look into for its entertainment value. Strongman feats date back to the origin of human time. I became interested in hand grip related strength feats after reading the book, &quot;The Mighty Atom.&quot; Strongman feats take amazing determination and dedication. It is good to see the sport showing some momentum. I found that this page described this amazingly on this <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fattorneyaskit.com%2F1936%2Feric-holder-gave-clemency-terrorists-bill-clinton%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://attorneyaskit.com/1936/eric-holder-gave-clemency-terrorists-bill-clinton/</a> article.<br /><br />When approaching grip strength training whether for sports, music, or the ergonomic workplace, I see many errors in method. To bring these errors into perspective, it is necessary to know about the four basic muscle groups involved in grip. These are 1) the hand closing muscles, 2) the hand opening muscles, 3) the wrist flexing muscles, and 4) the wrist extending muscles. Rarely do grip strength and hand exercise programs consider all four of these muscle groups, even at elite levels.<br /><br />Most everybody that trains grip strength to any degree utilizes the training of the first group, the hand closing muscles. These are generally considered to be the finger and thumb flexor muscles and adductor muscles. The question then becomes are these muscles trained in proper planes? It is most popular in the current exercise culture to use spring-loaded or coiled resistance devices to train finger flexion. Another method is to use grip handles plus weight, as in kettle balls or bars, etc. These hand exercises (as isolated exercises) can be harmful in the long term, as the hand muscles are trained to work in unnatural or shortened planes, creating static shortened muscles. It is vital to add a device that trains the hand in three dimensional planes that are natural to the fingers.<br /><br />The next most common exercise that people are aware of for grip strength training is wrist flexion. This is quite easy to train in can be done with a weighted can or a dumbbell or even using a wooden dowel and rope with a weight. Many people even incorporate the third most common exercise related to grip which is wrist extension. It is commonly been studied that the grip is strongest when the wrist is in mild extension. For this reason it is obvious that wrist extensor muscles play a part in stabilizing the grip. Wrist extension can be trained using a dumbbell as well as within the wooden dowel with a rope and a weight exercise.<br /><br />To be clear the &quot;wooden doll with a rope and a weight&quot; is a hand, wrist and forearm exercise and is as simple as it sounds. Find a wooden dowel, tie approximate 3 feet of rope to it, attach a weight and you have an exercise device! Now simply roll the dowel so that the weight is pulled up to the dowel. Then, opposingly, rotate the dowel such that the weight moves back down towards the ground. This exercise isolates the wrist flexor muscles and the wrist extensor muscles well.<br /><br />The exercise that is vital to grip strength and key to the health and balance of the hand, wrist and forearm and that is omitted commonly in grip strength training methods is the fourth group: &quot;the hand opening muscles.&quot; These are mostly made up of finger and thumb extensor muscles, but also abductor muscles. These hand opening muscles are designed to be used when called upon for two functions: the first is obviously to open the hand (when necessary), and the second is to contract in a stabilizing and complementary mode to support the action of the finger flexor muscles. Thus the finger extensor muscles are hugely important in maximizing grip strength in hand wrist and elbow stability.<br /><br />Finger and thumb extensor muscles can easily be trained. Find a hand strengthener that is designed so that the hand muscles can easily be trained in one continuous exercise (open &amp; close), thus creating a convenient exercise for anyone who trains the hand muscles involved in grip and grip strength. The result is strength, balance and healthy blood flow to all of the tissues of the hand, wrist, forearm and elbow. The result is long, strong and balanced tendons and muscles - and a stable hand, wrist &amp; elbow.<br /><br />Traditionally, extensor muscles were trained using elastic bands, but therapists found it very difficult to isolate each finger extensor muscle making the exercise virtually useless. Therapists also found that the fingers could not move through full extension and abduction without the elastic band slipping. Find a modern exercise device that allows each finger to easily move through full natural ranges of motion with resistance.

Make no mistake, it is hard work, but if you can meet a few key requirements you can get your magazine off the ground.<br /><br />What are those few key requirements?<br /><br />1) You need some money to do this - Every business start up needs some capital and magazines are no different. How much do you need? As little as a few hundred dollars will work (not including your printing costs) to get your first issue on the streets and/or news stands. For a projected higher end book, you will need thousands of dollars dependent on what market you are entering and how big you are going right off the bat. The key will be to learn the skills you need to publish and do the tasks yourself rather than hire an office full of workers and payroll (I will hit on those skills in a minute and talk more about cash in a minute).<br /><br />2) Equipment - At least one good computer capable of operating the various software you will need (Adobe InDesign and at least Adobe Photoshop), a good digital SLR camera like the Nikon D50 which runs about $750, a phone and a dependable vehicle.<br /><br />3) The ability to sell - Magazines big and small run off of advertisements and yours will be no different. I cannot stress enough how important it is to have a solid sales strategy in place before you take on this project. I will talk more about selling further along. I found that this person described this intelligently on this  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fbassguitarsreviewed.com%2Fquestion-guitar-players%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://bassguitarsreviewed.com/question-guitar-players/</a>  website.<br /><br />4) Creativity - You can't survive without offering something new to your readers in an attractive package and for this being creative is a necessity.<br /><br />Step #1 - Develop the Framework<br /><br />You probably have an idea of what type of magazine you want to publish but from here you need to construct some basic framework. Pick a name for your magazine carefully, make sure you are not stepping on anyone's trademark by searching the US trademark database.<br /><br />Your website's domain name is also something to consider when choosing your name. Search for open domains that match your magazine's name as closely as possible. It is okay to use a few sudo-odd takes on domains for magazines like magazinenameonline.com or magazine-name.com. Register your domain and contact a web development company that you like to start work on your magazine's new website. I personally like 22 Creative as they specialize in websites for magazines. Your website does not need to be awesome right out of the gate, just something professional that is clear about who you are and what your book is about - expect to spend anywhere from a few hundred dollars to thousands here. A website is an essential part of this process though, do not skip out on this one.<br /><br />Okay, you have a name and a website, what's next? Figure out what you are going to include in your first issue by writing out an editorial outline. Fancy name but in reality, just write out what you want to feature, how many pages you want to devote to each item and how many pages for ads you want to stash away (this will be dependent on how many ads you sell for your first issue). How many pages should your magazine be? Two factors are in play here. One is the cost of printing the magazine as it costs more to print a bigger magazine obviously, the second is how much editorial can or do you want to produce? You do not need a 100 page book your first go around so, dependent on what your competitors are doing, aim for around 50 pages for a local or lifestyle magazine and 90+ for a magazine you want to distribute on national news stands.<br /><br />Step #2 - It's Time to Produce Content<br /><br />Contrary to popular belief, you do not need an army of 'journalists' to publish your first issue. I have produced content for hundreds of magazines by myself or with the help of just a handful of people, it is not that hard.<br /><br />Start with item number one on your editorial outline. Write your text first, making sure to follow basic guidelines for writing editorial (Google search it for tons of help). Have friends read the copy and get their honest opinion. Did you lose your readers attention at any point? Are your facts correct? Do you have any typos?<br /><br />A picture is worth a thousand words literally. People like pictures, big, colorful pictures and lots of them. Decide on how many pictures you need for the piece and whether or not you can take the photos yourself or if you need to buy them/license them from a stock photo service. If you can take them yourself, head out and start snapping. Take clear, in-focus images and take lots of them. You do not want to have to go back and re-shoot anything because you did not get the shot. Also, set your camera to take 300dpi images, normal smaller resolution images will not work and will look pixilated in the final product - nothing comes off as more rookie than low-res photos in magazines. Remember if you have any people in your photos, get them to sign a 'model release' allowing you to use their image in your publication. If you need to buy an image from a stock photo website, make sure you buy a 300dpi image that is suitable for printing. Expect to pay anywhere from $3 - $10 for each photo, if you encounter a website that charges more, you would be over paying.<br /><br />After you have knocked your editorial out, sleep on it and go over it yourself. Is it good? How many magazines have you seen that all regurgitate the same tired 'electronics features' of iPhones and some silly whatever that not many people care about? Lots. You have to have a new take on things if you want to see issue number 2, 3, 54, etc.<br /><br />Step #3 - Start Selling Ads Yesterday<br /><br />New publishers often fall into the trap of just focusing on the creative side of the magazine and not the sales. As an independent publisher, you have to wear both hats. Start by putting together a media kit for your new magazine. A media kit is a couple pages, printed out that act as a resume for your magazine featuring all of the details of who your magazine is for, how many you print, your distribution tactics, what ads you offer and how much they cost, etc. In the beginning most of your sales will not be because of your media kit, this is just an essential thing to have to leave with prospective advertisers. I could go on and on about how to sell ads for new magazines but if you read it, you would have to send me a pretty big check as that is closely held information by all in the industry. What I can tell you is start with a plan; call on advertisers that make sense for your magazine. It is a waste of time to try and sell an ad to Budweiser if you are a new magazine that is about quilting - it's just not going to happen. Put yourself in that business owners shoes, would you consider it?<br /><br />Now is not the time to get rich quick. You want to sell ads to pay the bills and hopefully recoup your investment and live. That means price your ad offerings in reality. For an idea of what reality is, try and find out what similar magazines in your market are charging. Do not go to low on your pricing however, believe in the value of your magazine - giving it away free almost guarantees future failure. I know of one magazine that just kept throwing money at itself, starting in new markets without first being profitable in one and to appear successful, they gave away their ad space. A couple years later and it is common knowledge in the media buying industry that no one pays for ads in that magazine ever. If a potential advertiser says they want it for less than you want to sell it for, pass on them politely and come back to them in a few months after you can prove a stronger value to justify your rate card.<br /><br />Most importantly, offer value to your advertisers. There are a gazillion different ways to do this but it all starts with you delivering a strong, readable publication on time. The old under-promise and over-deliver adage works well here.<br /><br />Step #4 - Layout Time<br /><br />It's crunch time. Layout is hardly ever pleasurable, my first issue I ever designed took me about 72 hours of work with about 6 hours of sleep in that period - not exactly what I call an awesome good time. Make sure you know how to use your software BEFORE you need to start laying out your pub. Pretty much the whole free world uses Adobe InDesign to layout their magazines. It is a reliable and easy to use program that will run you about $650 unless you can find a deal. You should seriously consider purchasing one of Adobe's Creative Suites that bundles InDesign, Photoshop and Illustrator. Those three programs will take you anywhere you want to go in publishing as I have been relying on them for years. Yes that is some expensive software but is essential and well worth the money if you are serious about doing this right.<br /><br />If you flip through a random magazine here and there, you will notice that a lot of them have an inconsistent layout throughout the book, meaning that the fonts and styles change every few pages or every story. If this appeals to you knock yourself out, just know that it is not a good practice to follow. You need to aim for a balanced flow with your layouts. The first page of content should be very close to the last page and not stray too far in between. Use a text font at or above 8 points and never smaller. Don't forget those pictures, lots and lots of pictures. Learn to use Photoshop to clean your photos up. I have spent at least 60 seconds with every photo I have ever placed in a magazine layout - it is a crime to run photos with zero post work done on them, just a straight up crime.<br /><br />I won't go into an InDesign tutorial, plenty of people have done that better than I can before.<br /><br />What you need to ultimately do is end up with a PDF file for each page of your magazine that you will give to your printer. Name each file a standard p01_NAME.pdf. Covers will be labeled C1, C2, etc. You will have the option to view proofs of your files before your printer fires up the press to start your job (a big chunk of what you are paying them to do). Always look at every proof of every page; once it gets put on a plate and starts laying down ink, you are locked in.<br /><br />Make sure you are happy with your printer. If you do not have a printer to print your job, start by talking to Las Vegas Printing to get a quote on your job. I recommend getting your finished magazines carton packed rather than skid packed and wrapped in plastic as this practice guarantees a percentage of waste due to not protecting the magazines on the outside of the skid.<br /><br />Step #5 - Distribution Time<br /><br />If you are starting a magazine that will have National or a large ranging distribution, head straight to one of the two major magazine distributors. I won't name them because they, in my opinion, make it very difficult for start ups to get in the game. I will leave it at that.<br /><br />If you are starting a locally distributed magazine, read on. Yes there are services that offer to distribute your magazine for you, they will do a poor job and charge you and arm and a leg for the privilege. Distribution is paramount. If no one sees, picks up or reads your magazine then it is just a waste of time, money and trees. A major part of your focus should be dialing in the best distribution strategy possible. Do not just toss magazines in front of stores, bars, etc. and expect them to take the time to place them out in a neat fashion - they will end up in the dumpster out back. Do your own distribution. Personally ask permission from each distribution spot, not only is this the right thing to do but it is a great way to get your name out there and meet a few potential advertisers.<br /><br />Step #6 - Do it again, and again and again<br /><br />The process never stops in the magazine game, it is a fight at all times. There will always be strong competition, new people looking for their share of a market and times where you feel like you are the only person that reads your magazine. But if you do not fight at all, it's a guarantee that you will not win. Good luck!

Torres' opening strike was the result of poor defending by Wigan who committed the cardinal mistake of allowing Gerrard too much space, and the captain threaded a pass through to the Spain striker, even as Alcaraz was beaten by the pass and Caldwell was all too easy for Torres to?? get past and put the ball behind Al Habsi into the Wigan net.<br /><br />Liverpool were brilliant for about 20 minutes at the start, and inexplicably appeared to go into a shell thereafter.<br /><br />The draw left Liverpool fans fuming and renewing the call for Hodgson's head. Some of the criticism seemed warranted as Liverpool appeared to be in an overly defensive mindset after the interval, when Poulson was brought on for Meireles. Hodgson kept N'gog on the bench and did not even use him as a second half substitute.<br /><br />Rodallega and N'Zogbia's pace harried the Red's back-line. Tom Cleverley was another Wigan player who had a great day at the office. Liverpool came back to life in the last 10 minutes and their efforts helped create chances for Torres and Gerrard, making it all the more baffling as to why they didn't try it earlier.<br /><br />Head to head, Liverpool lead Wigan 7-1 in 11 games played between them, with the remaining three matches ending in stalemates.<br /><br />In their last league games, Liverpool have registered?? 5 wins, 4 losses and a draw; Wigan have won and lost 2 each of their last 10, drawing the remaining 6. Of 13 home games, this season, Liverpool have won 8, drawn 3 and lost 2, while Wigan have won just 2 of 12 away games, while losing and drawing 5 each.<br /><br />In match week 26, Liverpool beat Chelsea 1-0 away at Stamford Bridge, while Wigan beat Blackburn 4-3 at home. I found that this blog demonstrated this well on this  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fbikereviewshack.com%2F2769%2Fwanna-buy-bmx-bike-whats-sould%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://bikereviewshack.com/2769/wanna-buy-bmx-bike-whats-sould/</a>  blog post.<br /><br />Their win against Chelsea has propelled Liverpool to 6th place and with 13 match weeks to play, they could go still higher.<br /><br />On current form, Wigan will need more than a slice of luck to get away with any points from Saturday's game.<br /><br />Liverpool's starting eleven against Chelsea had Reina, Skrtel, Carragher, Agger, Kelly, Lucas, Meireles, Johnson, Gerrard, Maxi and Kuyt. Poulsen and Aurelio featured as substitutes.<br /><br />Wigan had the following men in their starting eleven against Blackburn: Al Habsi, Boyce, Gohouri, Alcaraz, Figueroa, Diame, N'Zogbia, Watson, McCarthy, Moses and Rodallega. McArthur, Di Santo and Cleverley played as substitutes.

Have you stopped to consider how much business you conduct over the telephone? These 10 tips will help you improve your telephone presence and presentations.<br /><br />1. You are the &quot;Manager of First Impressions&quot; for your business. Whenever you pick up the telephone, put a smile on your face first. It will enhance your vocal quality and you will sound pleasant and relaxed.<br /><br />2. Listen attentively to the person you are speaking with. Recall why your dog is such a good listener: listen actively and in the moment. Multi-tasking is the enemy of effective listening.<br /><br />3. Let other people talk! Make sure your caller has completely finished speaking before responding. Remember: sometimes they aren't done talking; they are just coming up for air.<br /><br />4. Use open-ended questions to get people to speak more freely. You should always talk less than the person you have called. It makes others feel more comfortable, particularly if you are asking them to make a decision. The more they talk, the easier it is for them to &quot;buy into&quot; what you are proposing.<br /><br />5. To create affinity with your callers, speed up or slow down your speaking voice to better match theirs. They won't realize why they feel comfortable, they just will.<br /><br />6. Use your words for best results. Keep in mind you can phrase anything positively, negatively or neutrally. Phrasing your words positively will help you get better results more easily. I found that this site showed this really well on this  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fpromealreplacementshakes.com%2F1823%2Fspiciness-harmful%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://promealreplacementshakes.com/1823/spiciness-harmful/</a>  weblog.<br /><br />7. Voice mail can be your friend. Avoid leaving voice mail messages but if you must, think of it as a 30 second commercial on a highly rated radio program. You have the opportunity to get your message into the &quot;ears&quot; of your most desired audience. Your message should reflect this.<br /><br />8. Plan your telephone presentations in advance. Think out all the various scenarios you might be faced with and write it out. This is called pre-call planning.<br /><br />9. Tape yourself for self-improvement. Listen to yourself carefully and decide what areas you want to improve.<br /><br />10. Make an action plan. Focus on only one area at a time. When you feel comfortable, move to your next area and repeat.<br /><br />We use the telephone as our primary form of personal communication. People who are good with this medium increase their opportunities for success.

Magazines are everywhere, but what are they exactly?<br /><br />On one hand, magazines are a mechanism for providing people with current information on a broad range of topics on a regular basis - usually monthly, but in some cases even weekly.<br /><br />However, the word magazine was originally used to indicate a storehouse for grain or gunpowder, so how did the term come to be associated with a periodical publication?<br /><br />The first periodical to use the word magazine in its title was started in London by Edward Cave in 1731. Cave used the word magazine in the name of his 'Gentleman's Magazine' to suggest that this new publication was a storehouse of information, providing all the news that a civilized person needed in order to keep up to date on what was going on in the world. Cave's magazine was tremendously successful, and within a few years several spin-off publications began to appear in London and in the United States.<br /><br />Magazines have gone through a complex evolution over the years, and it is instructive to think of magazines as belonging to one of three distinct categories: trade, news, and consumer.<br /><br />Trade magazines are designed to inform the members of a particular professional or occupational group, of items of specific interest to them. Individuals and businesses purchase subscriptions to trade magazines, and most of the content is written by and for people in the trade - for example, accountants or school teachers. These magazines are generally not available to the general public, and any advertising that they may contain (usually not much) tends to be directed at members of that trade. I found that this website explained this incredibly on this  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fhomegymplanet.com%2Feffective-exercise-equipment-gym-maximum-results-body-toning-48%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://homegymplanet.com/effective-exercise-equipment-gym-maximum-results-body-toning-48/</a>  weblog.<br /><br />News magazines, which in the case of publications like 'Time' or 'The Economist' are often published weekly, are directed at a broad readership. These magazines are designed to provide a single source through which readers can catch up on news, current events, and hot topics. They are available in bookstores, at newsstands, as well as by subscription, and the moderate amount of advertising that they contain is quite varied with respect to products displayed, and quite general in terms of the approach taken in the ads.<br /><br />The vast majority of modern magazines fall into the consumer category, and these magazines are directed at highly specific segments of the population, whether dog-lovers, gardeners, brides-to-be, or people who want to get rich. Consumer magazines usually contain a number of small articles that deal with topics of interest to the targeted group, but in most instances the bulk of available space is devoted to advertising.<br /><br />In consumer magazines, advertisers have the opportunity to pitch well-defined mixes of products, in a way that speaks directly to the targeted group. For the marketer, this means that they are getting maximum penetration with their message, and for publishers this means that they can rely on the advertisers to generate the bulk of their revenue stream. With consumer magazines, actual sales of the magazine are a secondary consideration. What matters is that potential advertisers think that, through magazines, information about their products is getting directly into the hands of those people who are most likely to purchase what they are selling.<br /><br />Every time you pick up a magazine that catches your interest, even if only to browse through it briefly, you are one step closer to buying something, and if magazines are doing what they are designed to do that something is not going to be the magazine.

For the last few decades that is what you did when you wanted to lose weight. Magazines, books and television reinforced that with a huge array of the latest fad diet plans and we were all sucked in to the false promises of &quot;lose 20 pounds in 14 days&quot; or &quot;trim your thighs in 8 minutes a day&quot; and other such tempting promises.<br /><br />But most of us who embarked on these diet plans are actually no slimmer now than we were back then and concede that for all the dieting we did it did not work as a long term weight loss strategy. Fortunately over the years as more research has been done we now know better ways to continue our weight loss battles but with more success than earlier attempts.<br /><br />The new way to lose weight is based around being healthy and having good 'metabolic fitness' as opposed to being on a diet. This means fat burning hormones are working properly, blood sugar levels are kept fairly constant and appetite regulation systems are in balance so they are not working against us. Most diet plans tend to work against our metabolism (our bodies engine).<br /><br />A diet tends to work against our body<br />Our 'metabolic fitness' is based around the premise that a healthy body is not overweight or over-fat. When things get out of balance that is when fat is stored rather than being burnt for energy. The first thing that gets out of 'whack' is our body composition (muscle/fat ratio). This is caused by our sedentary modern lifestyles and the fact that most of us sit in a chair of some sort for up to 80 percent of our waking hours.<br /> I found that this webpage described this intelligently on this  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fdslrcamerareviewer.com%2Fwhats-slr-camera%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://dslrcamerareviewer.com/whats-slr-camera/</a>  web site.<br />This causes us to lose our precious fat burning muscle tissue and what is left is weak and flabby dropping the energy requirements of our body. We end up storing fat no matter how little we eat. And of course the other factor is we generally are eating the wrong types of foods and too much of them. This means processed and refined foods particularly sugary carbohydrates combined with the lack of muscular exertion and we have a ticking health bomb as the body fat accumulates.<br /><br />The only way to fix this problem is to get our muscle toned back up and strong so they burn more fuel every minute of the day and night. This can easily be done with a proper strength training exercise program. 'Cardio' type activity will not rebuild or recover lost muscle tissue so forget the long duration, low intensity activity.<br /><br />A diet does nothing to rev up your metabolism<br />Strength training exercise is so efficient just 2-3 sessions each week are needed, but you will need to put some effort into each session as the body needs to be challenged to coax it into making changes. Your metabolism (your body's engine) is based around the amount of toned muscle tissue you have so its rehabilitation is vital if body fat is to be lost in a healthy manner.<br /><br />There is no need to restrict food intake as you do on most diet plans. Or if you do only reduce it a hundred or two calories each day to avoid triggering the survival mechanism that protects you from starvation and has you in fact storing more fat. You need lots of energy to put into your exercise sessions so you can make the changes necessary to your fat burning engine and restricting food too much will leave you low on energy. Keep up your strengthening exercise and before long you will have burnt off the excess fat and have in your clutches the body you have always wanted.

Fortunately over the years as more research has been done we now know better ways to continue our weight loss battles but with more success than earlier attempts.<br /><br />The new way to lose weight is based around being healthy and having good 'metabolic fitness' as opposed to being on a diet. This means fat burning hormones are working properly, blood sugar levels are kept fairly constant and appetite regulation systems are in balance so they are not working against us. Most diet plans tend to work against our metabolism (our bodies engine).<br /><br />A diet tends to work against our body<br />Our 'metabolic fitness' is based around the premise that a healthy body is not overweight or over-fat. When things get out of balance that is when fat is stored rather than being burnt for energy. The first thing that gets out of 'whack' is our body composition (muscle/fat ratio). This is caused by our sedentary modern lifestyles and the fact that most of us sit in a chair of some sort for up to 80 percent of our waking hours.<br /><br />This causes us to lose our precious fat burning muscle tissue and what is left is weak and flabby dropping the energy requirements of our body. We end up storing fat no matter how little we eat. And of course the other factor is we generally are eating the wrong types of foods and too much of them. This means processed and refined foods particularly sugary carbohydrates combined with the lack of muscular exertion and we have a ticking health bomb as the body fat accumulates. I found that this blog demonstrated this nicely on this  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Ftreadmillevolution.com%2Fgive-brand-treadmill-buy-1000-compact-size-incline-answers%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://treadmillevolution.com/give-brand-treadmill-buy-1000-compact-size-incline-answers/</a>  blog post.<br /><br />The only way to fix this problem is to get our muscle toned back up and strong so they burn more fuel every minute of the day and night. This can easily be done with a proper strength training exercise program. 'Cardio' type activity will not rebuild or recover lost muscle tissue so forget the long duration, low intensity activity.<br /><br />A diet does nothing to rev up your metabolism<br />Strength training exercise is so efficient just 2-3 sessions each week are needed, but you will need to put some effort into each session as the body needs to be challenged to coax it into making changes. Your metabolism (your body's engine) is based around the amount of toned muscle tissue you have so its rehabilitation is vital if body fat is to be lost in a healthy manner.<br /><br />There is no need to restrict food intake as you do on most diet plans. Or if you do only reduce it a hundred or two calories each day to avoid triggering the survival mechanism that protects you from starvation and has you in fact storing more fat. You need lots of energy to put into your exercise sessions so you can make the changes necessary to your fat burning engine and restricting food too much will leave you low on energy. Keep up your strengthening exercise and before long you will have burnt off the excess fat and have in your clutches the body you have always wanted.

Young or old, male or female, tinnitus is no respecter of persons and seems to strike, at will, whomever it pleases. Some describe tinnitus as a continuous ringing in the ears. Others say it is more like a hissing, whistling, buzzing, or roaring sound. Some experience the ringing in one ear, others in both. There seems to be no rhyme or reason to the method of affliction.<br /><br />While many people just learn to tolerate or live with the condition, many others are desperate and searching for a tinnitus treatment that will once and for all bring an end to the constant, annoyance of their chronic tinnitus. This is especially true if the person is affected by tinnitus hearing loss.<br /><br />The fear that some people have is that they will have to undergo some expensive, invasive surgery, or be prescribed pricey medications that have severe side-effects in order to cure tinnitus. The truth of the matter is that there are many tinnitus treatments that can help you manage your condition without having to resort to serious medical intervention.<br /><br />Practical Tinnitus Hearing Loss Treatment:<br /><br /><strong>Understand The Triggers:</strong><br /><br />It is important that you take some time to access your tinnitus hearing loss. Figure out what aggravates or &quot;triggers&quot; your condition. One way to do this is to keep a daily log, or journal. Keep track of what you eat every day and what you do. Then, write down the time when you notice an attack or when the symptoms seem to worsen. Also, pay close attention to any medications you may be on and if there seems to be a correlation of the meds with your tinnitus, inform your doctor immediately so he can prescribe an alternative. Your journal will be able to pinpoint critical activities so that you can avoid, or at least minimize your exposure to that particular trigger in the future.<br /><br /><strong>Say &quot;No&quot; To Stress:</strong><br /><br />Stress is actually a huge culprit when it comes to tinnitus hearing loss. You need to take whatever measures you can to avoid mounting stress. Again, pay close attention to your day, and journal at what times your stress levels may be spiking. If you are taking too much on or trying to do too much yourself, you need to learn to delegate jobs and responsibilities to employees or co-workers, and at home, to family members. After all, you are only one person. Do what you need to do to make some time in your day to rest and de-stress. If you find that you are just unable to avoid certain stressful situations, then learn some stress-management techniques like, exercise, breathing and relaxation therapy, etc.<br /><br /><strong>Earplugs:</strong><br /><br />Common, everyday noises can contribute to tinnitus hearing loss. When you use equipment like the lawnmower, vacuum, or even your hair-dryer, it's advisable to use earplugs (or ear-muffs) to protect your ears. It's also a good idea to keep a set of earplugs with you wherever you go because you just don't know when you might encounter a situation where you will need them. I found that this blogger demonstrated this smartly on this <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2JsZW5kZXJldmlld3MuY29tLzU4OC9hcGktdHV0b3JpYWxzLWJlZ2luZXItYWR2YW5jZWQv" target="_blank">Milton Crutchfield</a> web site.<br /><br /><strong>Tinnitus Maskers:</strong><br /><br />Often times it's just as bad, for the one dealing with tinnitus, to be in a completely quite environment as it is to be in an overly noisy one. Many people find it helpful to turn the fan on or have music playing to distract from the annoying ear ringing. If you are amongst people where it's just not practical to have these &quot;noise distractors&quot; on, you could check into tinnitus maskers. These are little devices, not unlike hearing aids, but they produce a certain pitch of sound, or noise, that cancels out, or &quot;masks&quot;, the ringing in the ears.<br /><br /><strong>Proper Rest:</strong><br /><br />Adequate sleep and rest are critical factors for those who suffer with tinnitus hearing loss. In many people, the lack of sleep often triggers an attack or causes their condition to worsen. The catch 22 though is that the continual ringing in the ears prevents one from falling asleep! The solution to this might be to use a white noise machine, play subliminal or soft music or turn on a fan to help distract from the noises you are hearing that keep you awake.<br /><br />I've just listed a few ideas that you could try as &quot;alternative management&quot; for your tinnitus hearing loss treatment. One thing to remember is that there is no &quot;one size fits all&quot; tinnitus cure. Each persons condition is unique and will require individualized treatment. There are many tinnitus remedies, finding the one that works best for you is what's important. Whether there has been hearing loss or not, tinnitus can be treated and managed if the right method is applied.<br /><br />Don't get discouraged if you've tried several treatments and still have no tinnitus relief. Stay patient and try another one, the answer to your tinnitus hearing loss may just be around the corner...

The name &quot;slinky loops&quot; comes from the shape that is created when the tubing is tied into concentric coils. The purpose of this procedure is to make the long lengths of pipe more manageable during installation and to be able to construct a consistent heat exchanger in a given amount of space. Not all horizontal closed loop systems are constructed in the slinky method, some just lay out the pipe in a down and back layout.<br /><br />A slinky is most easily constructed by using a jig made out of plywood with edges to contain the tubing. Measured marks can be drawn onto the jig to give you a reference point for sizing the overlap (pitch) of the slinky as you build it. It will take three people to most effectively build a slink. One will do the tying, one will feed the coils to the one doing the tying, and one will pull the slinky along out the back of the jig as it is built. It will take three people approx. 20 min to tie an 800' slinky once they are up and rolling.<br /><br />The first step is to determine how long of a slinky you need to build based on the loop field design. A chart that shows the lengths of slinky coils based on tube length, pitch of coils, and diameter of coils can be found here. A length of tubing will be pulled off the roll that is the needed length to be the return from the very end of the coil back to where the manifold will be; this portion will be straight. Once this is pulled off the coil you can begin tying the tubing into loops.<br /><br />The first loop will be tied into whatever diameter you made the jig (36&quot; is good). The second loop will be laid over the first loop by whatever pitch is needed to make your total length work. For example if you have a 36&quot; coil with a 18&quot; pitch you would lay each coil approximately half over the one in front of it. It your length called for 36&quot; loops with 36&quot; pitch you would not overlap them at all but simply place each loop end to end as you tie the coil. Plastic zip ties are the preferred product for tying the loops. I found that this page showed this well on this <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3BsZWFzZWFza2l0LmNvbS8zNTIwL2NvbXB1dGVyLXJhbS1zbG90cy8_" target="_blank">Roberto Rollag</a> web post.<br /><br />When you get near the end be sure to leave enough left untied to make it back to the manifold location. The first part of the coil that was left uncoiled can now be tied along the coil as it makes it's way back to the &quot;front&quot; of the coil. Both ends should now be close to equal distance from the loops and both at the front of the coil where you will build the manifold. Tape the ends of the pipe to keep dirt out if they don't already have caps.<br /><br />The final step is rolling the slinky into a donut roll which will actually resemble more of a giant birds nest but will in fact be fairly manageable and transportable. Simply start at the &quot;end&quot; (not the &quot;front&quot; where the lines are) and roll the thing up. Try to keep it as in line as possible when rolling it up.<br /><br />The slinky is now ready for transport. It will take two people to carry it due to both weight and shape. It can be transported in a truck of trailer to the job site if you built it elsewhere. Once onsite carry it to the trench or pit where it will spend its life and unroll it. If it is going in a trench I would suggest unrolling it besides the trench at the top and then with several people throw it into the trench. Be sure that the coil lays flat in the bottom of the trench but be careful if entering trenches that could collapse. The safer way would be to use a long pole to situate the slinky as needed.<br /><br />When bedding the loop field be sure the fill material is sufficient to provide good contact with the pipe without leaving air gaps and be sure that big rocks are not dropped on the pipe. In rocky soil screening the soil and bedding the pipe in two feet of fines is recommended. After proper bedding the tubing the rest of the back filling can be done and the area compacted.

In association with Dr. Marcantonio Della Torre, he covered body appendages and vital organs in equal measures. These pen and ink sketches differed significantly from his earlier tryst with mythological temperas and frescos. These scientific works in anatomical topography were biological diagrams of remarkable accuracy, derived out of first hand eyewitness understanding. Unverified accounts suggest that Leonardo da Vinci dissected almost 20 male and female dead bodies for his drawings. Therefore, a great deal of diligence and astute observation goes behind any attempt to replicate these sketches. The following guide is designed to help you draw human thighs like Leonardo da Vinci. Modern terminology is used for easy understanding.<br /><br />&amp;bull;	Reference. Do not try to rely on your understanding or memory for creating the bones and muscles of thighs. Medical works by Da Vinci were precision sketches that must be replicated without any 'tweaking.' Obtain reference images from books, journals, or the internet.<br /><br />&amp;bull;	Style. Da Vinci executed his works in series, where views included details and completeness varied. The idea was to give as many details as possible. There are longitudinal sectional drawings, complete muscular topographies, standalone bones, skeleton, and so on. Choose beforehand, the type of work you wish to recreate.<br /><br />&amp;bull;	Bones. Drawing the thigh skeleton is among the simplest of all. Each human thigh has only one bone, Femur. It is the longest and most powerful of long bones in the body. The upper end consists of ball joint head on the inner side and the trochanters (greater and lesser) on the posterior side. The lower extremity of femur appears like two small, adjacent balls. Da Vinci's recreations of femur from different angles are particularly known for their accuracy. I found that this page explained this intelligently on this <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2Fza2RhdGluZ2V4cGVydHMuY29tLzUzMzAvYmFzaWMtZ3JvdW5kLXJ1bGVzLXJlbGF0aW9uc2hpcC8_" target="_blank">Erick Jonathan</a> page.<br /><br />&amp;bull;	Muscles. Da Vinci noted that upon reaching knee, the thigh muscles take form of tendons and eventually that of cartilage, which is attached to the knee joint. Keeping this in mind, he made several comprehensive structures, demarcating each type of muscles distinctly. In such designs, the muscle mass immediately below skin and a part of femur are visible. The frontal, back, and side views are depicted through separate drawings. The anterior end of a thigh consists of Sartorius (the longest muscle in human beings) and quadriceps (vastus intermedius, vastus lateralis, vastus medialis, &amp; rectus femoris). The middle muscles are gracilis and adductors. The posterior compartment is made up of biceps femoris (hamstrings muscle), semitendinosus, and semimembranosus. Da Vinci's works portrayed the anterior and posterior muscles in detail.<br /><br />Once you are through with the sketching part, add some shading effects. Remember that these strokes are used to demarcate different muscles and not for adding any aesthetic value.

Although it is an island, it is connected with the rest of Thailand by two bridges. Phuket is the name of the island; it is also the name of the town on the island of Phuket and the name of the Province to which belong the Phuket Island and some smaller islands near the Phuket Island.<br /><br />The Phuket Island is of the size similar to Singapore and the island was well known to many people all over the world throughout the history, especially to merchants and travelers, as it was on the important trade route between India and China. It used to be mentioned many times in the ship logs of travelers from many countries, especially from Portugal, the Netherlands, United Kingdom and France.<br /><br />It has been a prosperous place, previously prospering from tin and rubber, and nowadays mostly from tourism.<br /><br />In the past the island was called Junk Celyon. The modern name &quot;Phuket&quot;, the same as the previous name Junk Celyon, comes from Malay and means &quot;hill&quot;. For people coming to Phuket from the sea, the island appears as a hill.<br /><br />Because Phuket was the source of valuable tin, in the 17th century the western powers of France, Netherlands and England competed for the control of the trade of tin from Phuket. The French controlled the island for some time, but ultimately were driven away by Thais. I think that this webpage described this incredibly on this <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RoYWlsYW5kbXVheWNhbXAuY29tL2NoaWEtc2VlZHM_" target="_blank">weight loss camp</a> website.Later the Burmese tried to conquer Phuket but were unsuccessful. When the Burmese forces were preparing to invade Phuket they were spotted by the British captain who warned the Phuket's authorities.<br /><br />Two local women, the wife of the deceased governor and her sister quickly organized some defensive forces that they were able to gather quickly and successfully resisted the Burmese invasion for one month. After the one month siege the Burmese were forced to withdraw and the two local women became the Phuket's heroines.<br /><br />On the Boxing Day of December 26, 2004 Phuket and the other areas of Thailand on the Andaman Coast were struck by tsunami waves caused by the earthquake under the Indian Ocean. Tens of thousands of people died in South East Asia and 5,300 people in Thailand, mostly foreign tourists. In Phuket Province 250 deaths were reported, but there were many more deaths (about thousand) of illegal Burmese worker who were building a new beach resort in the area of Khao Lak.<br /><br />Many beaches and some villages in Phuket were destroyed or damaged by the tsunami, mostly on the western coast (especially Kamala, Patong, Karon and Kata beaches) and also some areas on the southern coast.<br /><br />The rebuilding of Phuket started and progressed very fast after the tsunami and most of the resorts and hotels were back in business in February 2005. Throughout the 2005 all the damage areas of Phuket Province were restored.<br /><br />Nowadays Phuket is protected by American invented tsunami protection system made of twenty-two buoys that are floating in the Indian Ocean and are part of the global tsunami warning system.

The world we live in is a contradictory one. I think that this writer explained this incredibly on the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RoYWlsYW5kbXVheWNhbXAuY29tL2ZpdG5lc3MtdHJhaW5pbmc_" target="_blank">muay thai boxing sinbi</a>  webpage.There are folks who put on weight rather effortlessly and yearn to lose their weight and fats through unhealthy diets. Yet on the other end of the spectrum, thin people find it tremendously challenging to gain that extra few pounds to enhance their physical appearance and regain some masculine appeal in the case of men. Skinny ladies also dream of fitting nicely into beautiful clothes that look so fabulous on those svelte and voluptuous models. But do not envy those who put on weight too easily, especially those through unhealthy diets. It is better to understand the fundamentals behind healthy weight gain. This is where you can learn more on how to gain weight quickly and healthily.<br /><br />Before we tackle the issue of how to gain weight quickly, let us look at the reasons why scrawny and thin people fail in gaining weight successfully no matter how hard they try. Survey statistics discovered the following as the top reasons why they are not putting on weight:<br /><br />1. Poor Diet<br /><br />Skinny people are not eating right and enough. By that, it means that they are not eating foods that would help them to gain weight. Protein is critical in adding extra weight but many folks do not get enough protein intake. This is where things go awry. So how can they expect to gain weight quickly or for that matter, any significant weight improvement at all? It is important to load more on protein, and less on simple carbs. Read on for specific weight-gain diet foods.<br /><br />2. Proper Work-out<br /><br />Eating is not sufficient. We all need to engage in some kinds of physical activities to convert our food intake to healthy mass. This conversion can take place only with proper exercises. People who truly understand how to gain weight quickly do so in a healthy manner with proportionate muscle mass gain.<br /><br />3. Poor Motivation<br /><br />Weight gaining or slimming works in a similar manner. Medical practitioners have come to understand that the motivation behind the individual wanting to gain weight is vital to his/her success. Our generation is often called the &quot;instant noodles&quot; generation where everyone desires instant results. Weight gaining is not an overnight mission, but a long-term goal. Failing to understand this is a sure ingredient for weight gain failure.<br /><br />Once we are able to acknowledge and work around the common grounds for failure, we are well on our way to successful quick weight gain. Are you ready for some easy-to-follow tips on how to gain weight quickly?<br /><br />1. Weight Gain Diet Foods 101<br /><br />I mentioned earlier that eating the right foods and eating enough of them is the key to weight gain. Foods such as fast food, chocolates and other junk food like chips won't do you any good. Any weight gain from such foods would do your health more harm than good.<br /><br />Cultivate a habit of eating more than your daily energy and calorie needs. First, find out what is your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) which equates your daily calorie need/count to maintain your weight at its current level. Next, start planning your weekly dietary plans to increase your weekly intake by 3500 calories to achieve a weight gain of 1-2 pounds within a week. This translates to an additional 500 calories in your daily calorie intake.<br /><br />Eat more protein-based food stuff such as beef and chicken. Drink more milk for it is a rich source of protein. Balance your meals with vegetables and nuts as well. Eat 5 or 6 small meals rather than 3 big meals to balance the calorie intake.<br /><br />2. Weight Gain and Muscle Mass Building Routine<br /><br />You need to tone up the extra weight you are adding to your bodies so that you don't end up obese. Depending on your preference for physical activities, the 2 kinds of activities recommended here would be useful in complementing with your weight gain diet.<br /><br />Engage in moderate activities such as brisk walking, jogging or playing a sport for at least 30 minutes for 3-4 times per week. Try to inject some fun into your physical activity so that you would feel encouraged and motivated to cultivate this as a habit and eventually as part of your lifestyle.<br /><br />Work out in the gym on some resistance training for at least 3 times per week. But before you do so, speak to a qualified physical training instructor who can advise on what exercise routine is suitable for you. If not, go to the library to read up on what are the work-out routines that are ideal for a person of your build and weight.<br /><br />Knowing these simple tips on how to gain weight quickly should give you better knowledge than most people in the basic building blocks of gaining weight healthily.

Put quite simply, other than having a hysterectomy, there is no way to completely guarantee that you can be fibroid-free. You may have been considering ways to shrink fibroids naturally and for women who are motivated to take charge of their own treatment, a fibroid diet is a worthwhile option to consider.<br /><br />However, it is absolutely crucial that you appreciate that using foods to shrink fibroids is only one element of a potentially successful treatment. Doctors are unable to determine exactly what has caused fibroids in an individual, although in the vast majority of cases, fibroid growth is intrinsically linked to estrogen. I discovered that this blog owner explained this nicely on the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RoYWlsYW5kbXVheWNhbXAuY29tL21vcGVkLXJlbnRhbA__" target="_blank">rawai muay thai</a> article.Other common elements include race, hereditary, lifestyle and diet.<br /><br />Natural treatment to shrink fibroids takes into account the &lt;i&gt;possible&lt;/i&gt; causes of fibroids and as the &lt;i&gt;exact&lt;/i&gt; causes cannot be determined in individuals, the only way to ensure success is to eliminate every single possibility. There is no doubt that for women who are prepared to put in the time and effort, there is a high probability of success, but it is important to appreciate that this will not happen overnight. However, what is very pleasing for most women is many of the symptoms of fibroids can be eliminated very quickly, even if actual shrinkage takes longer.<br /><br />Following a fibroid diet, using foods to shrink fibroids naturally is one element of the whole treatment.

It makes complete sense to try out a natural treatment for fibroids before resorting to surgery or any of the hormonal drugs which can cause their own side effects.

However, many homeowners have thought outside the box and come up with the idea of finishing their basement into a home theater room. While the basement may seem like an unlikely choice for such a room, it is actually one of the best places for a home entertainment system. A basement is set underground so it can easily become a very dark room with no natural light. It also has minimal noise pollution. These factors contribute to the room's setup as the perfect place for a sound system and large projection system. There are many basement home theater designs that homeowners can choose from for their own basement.<br /><br />It is important for a homeowner to consider the measurements of the basement before purchasing any stereo or visual equipment for the room. While a homeowner may have his or her mind set on a specific size of television or projector screen, it is important to make sure the screen is not too big or too small for the room. The perfect visual quality can be achieved when the correct sized equipment is purchased in relation to the size of the room. A homeowner should be able to consult with a professional at the electronics store in order to make sure he or she is buying the correct sized projector screen or television. A homeowner who is developing plans for the setup of the basement may want to consult with a professional first in order to see what type of budget he or she will be working with on the visual equipment.<br /><br />A surround sound system should also be the correct size to the fit the size of the basement. I in my opinion, that this blog owner explained this amazingly on the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RoYWlsYW5kbXVheWNhbXAuY29tLw__" target="_blank">muy thai training</a> weblog.A basement is known for having great acoustics so a surround system may not need to be as powerful as it might be in a regular living room. A homeowner should be able to go to a local electronics store and see a few basement home theater designs that are already setup in the store. He or she can choose which system sounds the best and would be best for the room. A professional or employee of the store should be able to help if the homeowner can tell him or her measurements of the room and what type of budget he or she has in mind.<br /><br />A homeowner may have plenty of ideas for a home basement theater system. However, it is important for the homeowner to remember that the sound and visual equipment should be the correct size for the size of the room. Consulting with a professional on the basement home theater designs that the homeowner is interested in can be one of the first steps taken when deciding on the plans for the basement. A professional can recommend a setup for the basement based on measurements and the acoustics in the room.

They provide a restful atmosphere, making the house's occupants feel relaxed, and their guests feel welcome. Curtains can be used in any room of the house, be it the living room, dining room, den, kitchen, bedroom, and toilet.<br /><br />With the lighthouse design, these rooms will come to life, whether the occupants are avid lighthouse d??cor collectors, passionate sea lovers or simply those who want to feel peaceful and relaxed when in their own homes.<br /><br />Lighthouse curtains come in different colors, fabrics and sizes. Homeowners will easily find what they need because of the numerous and varied designs available in the internet and in the nearest home depot. Depending on where these curtains will be placed, they can be made of either thick or light fabrics. I found that this webmaster explained this intelligently on the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RoYWlsYW5kbXVheWNhbXAuY29tLw__" target="_blank">muay thai camp muay</a> web site.There are even those that are bamboo-beaded.<br /><br />For children's or teenager's bedrooms, curtains with small lighthouse prints fashionably scattered all over will look good, especially if matched with lighthouse bed sheets and lighthouse pillow cases. Fabric can be cotton or any light material for a carefree and breezy atmosphere.<br /><br />In the master's bedroom, lighthouse curtains can be made of thicker fabric in order to keep the light out for an undisturbed restful sleep. Another curtain made of thinner fabric, preferably in a neutral color like white or light blue, can be added behind the thicker lighthouse drapery. This will serve well once the thicker curtain is pulled to the sides when the occupants prefer to let the light in. A lighthouse roman curtain may also be useful for such purpose. Designs and background colors vary, from coastal panoramas to nautical scenes, all giving an atmosphere of calm and rest.<br /><br />For showers, there are lots of lighthouse curtains available. The water element of both showers and the lighthouse-inspired designs make these two fitted for each other. The main color of the lighthouse curtains is usually blue, as they incorporate the sea and marine life. Thus, showers with blue or white tiles and walls will look good with the lighthouse shower curtain. This can be matched with lighthouse-designed toilet accessories like towels, soap dish, tumbler and toothbrush holder.<br /><br />For the living rooms and dens, lighthouse curtains made of thinner fabric with prints of nautical or beach scenes will make the room vibrant, while at the same time conveying a message of welcome and comfort. Accessories with lighthouse theme like figurines, wall decors, table lamps and clocks will give the feeling of rest and relaxation complete.<br /><br />For kitchens and dining rooms, lighthouse curtains vary. There are tiered curtains with the lighthouse design on the edges. There are ruffled valances with multicolored lighthouse pattern all over the fabric. There are lace fabrics where the view outside can be seen clearly. If the kitchen and dining rooms will be showcasing the lighthouse curtain collection of the homeowners, then simple curtains in white with the lighthouse design on the edges will be more appropriate. The rooms will come alive with the many lighthouse-themed accessories on the dining table, kitchen shelves and counter tops, like canisters, tea sets, placemats, hand and dish towels and table runners.
