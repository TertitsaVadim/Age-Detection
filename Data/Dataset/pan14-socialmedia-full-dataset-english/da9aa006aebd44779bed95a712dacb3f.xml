From that prognosis, the proper treatment would then be determined. If the patient has a mole condition, information on the patient's skin type, type of mole and when it started developing would be required. A full assessment of the mole's shape, size and colour would also be required if you are keen <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5tb2xlcmVtb3ZhbC5uZXQvbmF0dXJhbF9tb2xlX3JlbW92YWwuaHRt" target="_blank">about mole removal</a>. The removal process will address all the stated issues individually so that the treatment can effectively rid the skin of the mole. Self-assessment is the first step that most people will take when they note that they have patches on their skin.

<br />Occasionally, some people will miss read the finds and take the mole to be something else, like age spots. That is the reason why you have to be knowledgeable about what a mole looks like and its possibilities, particularly about being cancerous or noncancerous. You would then require the opinion and expertise of a dermatologist if it is malignant. The doctor will run appropriate test to ascertain if the mole growth is cancerous or benign. During the same process, the doctor will also to tests to verify the skin type so that he or she can know which will be the best mode of treatment.
<br /><br />We can broadly categorize the various available treatment options for mole removal available these days into either natural treatments or modern medical treatments. These two categories deal with moles in their own ways, so it is important that you fully determine which treatment would be most applicable. The <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5laG93LmNvbS9ob3dfMzM5MTg2OV9ldmFsdWF0ZS1uYXR1cmFsLW1lZGljYWwtdHJlYXRtZW50cy5odG1s" target="_blank">natural</a> treatment will revolve around medicinal remedies that have been in use for many years. The sources of these remedies are animals and plants, although most of them come from plants. One downside to these treatments is the amount of time it usually takes before they actually show results. However, they are safe to use, with no risks of side effects, and they are not going to cost a lot of money, either. They are also readily available in stores and some can even be planted in one's own backyard. The only thing you need to know would be how to make use of these products and turn them into the remedies that you need.
<br /><br />The cost or expense is obviously higher when we talk about the other category, the modern mole removal methods. The moles are directly applied with the most common forms of mole removal products that are flooding the market these days: mole removal creams. The effectiveness of a cream will depend on the stage of growth of the mole, if it is big, and then creams may not offer the right results. Bigger moles will require more complex methods. While the use of creams can be done at home under the prescriptions of a doctor, a qualified dermatologist does higher mole removals procedures. Procedures such as laser therapy may take you a few treatments, but it is quite effective. Cryosurgery is the other option, a procedure that will involve low temperatures on the affected areas, commonly referred to as freezing. You should take note of all the options available to you by reading up about mole removal and inquiring on options and costs.

<br />The vulnerability of the human body makes it naturally sensitive to adverse elements if it is not given the proper protection and reinforcements. When we are bent on finding out how to remove a mole, the success - and failure - of the whole process would largely depend on the decisions we make. Of course we can have a qualified and skilled medical professional deal with the whole thing instead of worrying about it ourselves. However, if you are keen on researching about the skin problem, find out its causes, and know treatments, you can also handle the problem yourself. This is particularly applicable when the mole problem is not as large or complicated. But moles that demonstrate rapid growth and unusual behavior would best be dealt with by the help of a medical professional or a skin expert.
<br /><br />In truth, understanding as much as you can about the condition is the first and important step to knowing how to remove a mole. Proper research will show you that the condition comes in two forms. One is common and develops as one grows up, at times a few years after you are born. Mainly, this can be blamed to sun exposure. The other condition shows up later in life and is mainly attributed to the skin pigmentation process. This is usually a biological complication and needs a keen medical address. You will be in a better position to find out which treatment would work best if you know all these facts about your specific condition.
<br /><br />The way you would handle and remove age spots, warts, skin tags and other benign skin problems would be similar to how you would handle a mole problem. There are modern and advanced medical procedures, but if you want something cheaper, albeit smaller, you could also try out natural methods. The methods known for successfully removing moles quickly include using some specific creams, excision, hot metals, and even cryosurgery and laser treatments. Once administered to the skin, these treatments would require varying degrees of attention.
<br /><br />A skin check is always required prior to administering any medical procedure in order to ascertain the skin type. This will be a means to exclude certain procedures, which are meticulous when it comes to skin types. Laser surgery and the use of creams are the main treatment options that need such precautions. Cryosurgery will use liquid nitrogen to freeze the mole and remove them, and its opposite solution is the use of hot metal to burn of the dead mole cells on the skin. If you want quick results, you should definitely try these methods. However, you should expect that there will be some pain involved. Done properly, these methods will solve your mole problem and soon you'll have your skin back to normal.
<br /><br />There is nothing complicated about the use of natural treatments for moles. Of course you will have to be knowledgeable about the essential elements present in various foods and other natural (plant and animal) sources. There are many medicinal herbs that can be used, but you can also make use of the many edible food that are readily sold in the market or you can harvest from your own backyard. These natural mole remedies, most of which are edible, are applied directly on the skin. Eating these will also be an added booster to the treatment and healing process.

There have been a number of positive reviews regarding the effectiveness of these products. However, that does not erase the doubts people harbor about it. It goes without saying then that the main concern of the people is as to whether it can solve their specific problem more than whether it is actually going to be safe if they use it on their skin. There is a need then to be aware of the products that are being sold so you will know the safe way of using them. If you look at these products more closely, you will see that they are herbal and chemical-based. 
<br /><br />Each of these products have their distinct strengths. But that doesn't mean that you should be careless in applying these products. Using them right would get you the best results. You should identify the chemical-based creams and look at them more closely, see which of the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5laG93LmNvbS9hYm91dF80NzI3NDk5X21vbGUtcmVtb3ZhbC1wcm9kdWN0cy5odG1s" target="_blank">components</a> will be most effective in handling the mole. You will be able to use the product more correctly if this is the case. The same applies when using herbal bases mole removal creams.
<br /><br />Skin irritation and scarring are the main concerns when we're talking about chemical based creams. Acids, which are commonly found in most chemical based creams, cause irritation to the skin and will also result to scarring. The differences in skin texture and skin type will result in different reactions to the chemicals. Do not presume that a chemical cream would be universally effective just because it turns out to be effective for one or two people. It is still better if you consult with a doctor about it so he can assess the right chemical based mole removal cream that is suited for your skin type. Due to the acid nature of the products, you should avoid using them to remove moles that are on your eyes. 
<br /><br />Also considered to be just as effective are the herbal creams. They are also purported to be milder and safer, and they also cost less. You will also pit them against the same effects that are caused by the chemical creams to see if they will work for you. Skin irritation and scarring are also concerns; however, you will surely find a product that will be suitable for your sensitive skin. Initially, you will experience some skin irritation when you first start using the herbal creams. However, you are not going to have to worry about any scarring. However, when it comes to dealing with moles in your eyes, the herbal cream will also be a big no as a mode of treatment. 
<br /><br />To appreciate the effectiveness of any of these two products fully, you should always take time to go through the instruction of use. You may also ask your doctor or the chemist you bought it from on how to use it. But that does not  mean you should ignore the instructions on the label. You should also check out the ingredients, as well as the dates of manufacture and expiry. After application, you may observe that the mole removal cream is working. However, it would still be better if the healing process is referred to a doctor.

Then there are five things you have to bear in mind. We will look into each of these considerations, trying to figure out how they impact the overall scheme of things. Facial moles, just like other skin moles, tend to necessitate undergoing surgical procedures in order to get rid of them. In some cases, the facial moles are simply excised  which means that they are cut off with a sharp surgical instrument, under anesthesia. In some other cases, the medical practitioners opt to have the facial moles cauterized. 
<br /><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/178785637_14638192_50136457.jpg" />
<br />Now, the first thing you have to keep in mind when seeking facial mole removal treatment is that the treatment will almost certainly be invasive. Of course you already know about the treatments that involve excision and cauterization. A less invasive option would be laser treatment, but the available evidence shows that efficacy of this treatment is rather dubious  especially in cases where the moles happen to be deep in the skin (which is usually the case). That means we are forced to choose between excision and cauterization, which leaves us not a lot of choices. Both are highly invasive. If you go for cauterization, we must warn you that some excision would still have to be performed before the mole is burned off.
<br /><br />The second thought on your mind should have to do something with the price. Mole removal could be quite expensive. Well and good if you are covered by health insurance. But your insurance could prove to be useless in this case if your health insurer does not accept the removal of facial moles as health-related and treat it as a cosmetic procedure instead. 
<br /><br />The third thought would be: would the treatment leave a scar after the facial mole has been removed? You would have to think about your options carefully because even if you managed to get rid of the mole, you might be left with an uglier scar.
<br /><br />Next, you have to think carefully and assess if the treatment could possibly lead to you having infections. Think about it: facial mole removal means you are undergoing a form of a surgical procedure. You can expect that inspections are still highly possible in mole removal <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlYWx0aC5ob3dzdHVmZndvcmtzLmNvbS9za2luLWNhcmUvcHJvYmxlbXMvdHJlYXRpbmcvbW9sZS1yZW1vdmFsLmh0bQ__" target="_blank">procedures</a> , as is always the case in all forms of surgical treatments.
<br /><br />The fifth thing you have to keep in mind, when seeking facial mole removal treatment is that the procedure can lead to some nasty complications. The complication involving possible infections during the treatment has already been discussed. But aside from that, nerve damage is also a risk and a complication in mole removal treatments. Do not think that only mole removal procedures have this risk; all surgical procedures that are invasive by nature carry this complication as well. Remember that you are taking big risks here; therefore, do not take your situation lightly. Give it a lot of thought first. To lower these risks, you should make sure that the person who will wield the surgical tools and perform the surgery is someone who is qualified, skilled and competent when it comes to the job at hand ' removing facial moles.

We will also be seeking to understand how exactly the respective treatment risks come into being (that is, the mechanisms through which the respective risks can play out). Finally, we will be looking at the measures through which the respective treatment risks can possibly be avoided or, at the very least, mitigated. We will keep those risks at bay by employing some precautions and safety measures. It is worth noting that the treatment of skin moles tends to be quite invasive. Medicine has not yet advanced to a point where you can just pop a pill which subsequently makes your skin moles go away. Nowadays, it is a choice between cutting the moles or burning them off. These procedures are otherwise known as excision and cauterization, respectively. Both procedures are of an invasive nature. Being invasive medical procedures, they naturally come with various risks.
<br /><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/178785637_14638192_50136457.jpg" />
<br />The first major risk faced by people undergoing skin mole treatments is infection. Choosing excision over cauterization, or vice versa, won't matter because both still pose the same risk of infection. But in a procedure that involves pure and simple excision, you'd be at a greater risk of being infected. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5oZWFsdGgubnkuZ292L2Rpc2Vhc2VzL2NvbW11bmljYWJsZS9hdGhsZXRpY19za2luX2luZmVjdGlvbnMvYmFjdGVyaWFsLmh0bQ__" target="_blank">Infections</a>  take place when, during a mole removal procedure where parts of the skin are broken open, pathogens would enter the body. There, they will start what they do: cause diseases. Make sure the hygiene and sanitation of the area where the procedure is being conducted is well-maintained to lower the risks of infections. These 'minor surgeries' are often taken lightly. There would be lower chances of infection if the medical practitioner or the doctor who is performing the skin mole treatment undertakes it with the same amount of care and diligence he practices in major operations or surgeries. The same precautions should be taken, especially when it comes to sterilization of the surgical instruments used as well as prepping the surgical environment. Another way to mitigate the late onset of infections is performing proper post-operative care on the treated areas.
<br /><br />The second of the four main risks that are associated with the treatment of skin moles is the risk of anesthetic allergy. Moles are located on the skin at certain depths and, regardless of the depth, there is bound to be some pain involved once they are excised or cauterized. Thus, anesthesia is necessary. However, there are some anesthetic agents that can cause allergies when administered to some people. It would be difficult to mitigate this risk for the simple reason that it is also difficult to tell whether a patient is predisposed to be allergic to the anesthetic agent that will be given.
<br /><br />Skin mole treatments also pose the danger of the person sustaining nerve damage during the procedure. This requires a lot of care on the part of the practitioner who is performing the treatment. But differences in anatomy often lead to situations where certain nerve formations end up being in unexpected locations, leading to their damage during these sorts of procedures.
<br /><br />Scarring is the fourth main risk that people often associate with mole removal treatments. There is always that risk that, although the mole has been completely removed, it was replaced with an even more unsightly scar. There is very little that can be done to reduce the chances of scars being formed after skin tag removal treatments. But you can still do some improvisation to conceal these scars that have cropped up from the skin mole removal treatments.

<br /><br /><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/178785637_16534712_48307954.jpg" />
<br />Is it necessary to remove moles, if you have them? 
<br /><br />This question may come across as ridiculous for some science students. It is a different case with laymen, who tend to become apprehensive upon reading about cancer-causing moles. It used to be that <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5tb2xlcmVtb3ZhbC5uZXQ_" target="_blank">removing skin moles</a> is complicated; that is no longer the case. 
<br /><br />Back then, people settled for simple natural remedies and home-based treatments. But today, laser surgery or excision surgery is carried out in many hospitals and they are exclusively performed by skin surgeons who specialize in mole removal. You have to have your mole diagnosed for any cancerous tendencies before signing up for a surgical procedure to remove them. 
<br /><br />When this differentiation is understood clearly, you will find out whether a surgery is required or not. The most common types of moles, called nevus, are not cancerous at all. Despite being similar to common moles, however, dysplastic nevus can sometimes pose cancer risks. A sure cause for cancer is melanoma. 
<br /><br />Their differences in moles lie in their shapes and sizes. Others have differences in their symmetry, border line and surface texture. After the common moles are removed, there is less chance for it to reappear. Similarly, after removing the dysplastic nevus, you cannot expect the recurrence. But in the case of melanoma, there is no guarantee that it will not reappear. Years after a successful excision surgery, melanoma still reappeared in some patients. Among the three forms of moles, the most harmful one is melanoma. It can affect many parts of the body and not just a single area. However, just because a mole forms in one area does not mean other areas of the body will follow suit. The surface area of normal moles is flat. They develop as smooth spots on one's skin. They can also have raised areas or bumps in some cases. 
<br /><br />Although dysplastic nevus also have smooth surfaces, they are less pleasing to the eye. They lack proper symmetry or shape, unlike common moles. In fact they have a pebbly appearance. Melanoma, on the other hand, has a scraped appearance. You will also find them lumpy and quite hard. In some instances, blood can ooze from them.  
<br /><br />Among the three forms of moles, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2VuLndpa2lwZWRpYS5vcmcvd2lraS9EeXNwbGFzdGljX25ldnVz" target="_blank">nevus</a> is round; sometimes, oval. Dysplastic nevus has no proper shape. Similarly, melanoma also has no regular shape or symmetry. Close observation of changes in mole shape is one way of figuring out, if it can have cancerous tendencies. 
<br /><br />You should consider removing your mole, if it does not have a well-define size or shape. Nevus is well separated from the skin and has a distinct contour. Melanoma, on the other hand, has blurred edges. You will have trouble telling the mole from the skin because the notched contours blend very well with the skin tone. The contour or dysplastic nevus is the same.
<br /><br />Last but not the least; not all moles are dangerous. Further, if they are located in certain spots, they are treated as beauty spots, in some cultures. 
<br /><br />I sincerely hope that this article has done a good contribution in making you aware about different types of moles and their features.

<br /><br />If you are on the lookout for a method that is both affordable and allows faster recovery, the laser method is a good choice. This method also has a few side effects than other mole removal methods. With a well-qualified doctor at the helm, you do not have to be overly concerned with having scars left behind. If you go online, you will find a lot of sites tackling the different methods of mole removal. 
<br /><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/178785637_2901662_48659441.jpg" />
<br />A little research is however needed to choose the right technique that will suit your budget as well as your requirements. The choice of mole removal method will also be affected by the type of moles that you have. Moles that are slightly raised, for example, will be needing deeper incisions. Mild surgeries are needed, if the moles are a little flat. When choosing the type of surgery, you also have to consider where the moles are found. There won't be any problems, if the mole is located in an unusual area of the body. You don't really have to get rid of it. If, however, the mole is located in an area often seen or highly visible to others, your cosmetic sensibilities may drive you to have them gotten rid of. 
<br /><br />But whatever be the method chosen, it must cause scars or blemishes. It must not lead to other complication in the future. You should go over all of that in detail before you even take that first step and start the treatment. If you have any apprehensions about the procedure, do not hesitate to approach a qualified doctor. They are there to guide you. 
<br /><br />Together with the physician, you will be able to look at all the possibilities and options open to you. He will explain you the advantages as well as the disadvantages of each and every method.
<br /><br />Now-a-days, cosmetic surgeries do not come cheap. But there are risks that you simply cannot take. For example, you may be presented with two possible doctors who can perform mole surgeries. The first doctor, well-trained in laser surgery, may charge quite a high price for his services. He may have been doing laser surgery procedures for a longer time than most doctors. It might be cheaper, if you choose the second doctor. But he or she can be a specialist in only one type of mole removal like cryotherapy or excision method. If laser surgery is what you need, though, the first doctor should be your option. 
<br /><br />This means you are not settling for second or third best. Sometimes, anesthetics are needed in surgical procedures. Laser, however, doesn't require anesthesia. You can keep yourself awake, for the entire period of time. Moles that are flat can be eliminated via laser surgery. So many natural therapies are now being followed by many people. There are herbal remedies that you may also try. 
<br /><br />When aren't you supposed to use laser therapy? 
<br /><br />Consider other methods, if the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2Fuc3dlcnMueWFob28uY29tL3F1ZXN0aW9uL2luZGV4P3FpZD0yMDA5MDQyMjIxNDcyMUFBWFJPOWk_" target="_blank">mole you are trying to remove is deeply rooted</a> and slightly raised from the skin. Laser treatments do not involve any stitches at all. No bleeding will occur.

<br /><br />This particular method of mole removal focuses on moles that are raised from the skin. The name is a giveaway; it makes use of electricity. The moles will be destroyed using electricity. This will be followed by complete removal of the moles. This will require cutting of the skin moles. Heat treatment will be employed afterwards to close the wound. 
<br /><br /><object width="336" height="295"><param name="movie" value="http://en.pan.netcom/go/widget/videoID=en-4679343"></param><param name="wmode" value="window"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><embed src="http://en.pan.netcom/go/widget/videoID=en-4679343" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowFullScreen="true" wmode="window" width="336" height="295"></embed></object>
<br /><br />Laser treatment is another method that is being used by many people. Thanks to the fewer side effects that laser treatments cause, more and more are latching on to this procedure. However, there is this belief among dermatologists that moles are not removed in their entirety by laser treatment. 
<br /><br />It doesn't look like the total growth of skin moles can't be halted. Sometimes, it can develop again at the same location or at a different spot. When you choose a well qualified doctor, you can try using these methods for both the raised moles as well as the flat moles.
<br /><br />Moles are generally rooted deeply. Skin removal will cause changes to your skin, and you will need to consult with a doctor about it, particularly if you will be undergoing any plastic surgeries. It would be even better, if it is a dermatologist that you approach. Aside from telling you which procedure would be more ideal for you, a licensed dermatologist will also provide follow-up services after the treatment. 
<br /><br />Scarring is a major after-effect dreaded by many who undergo skin surgery. The appropriate treatment will be decided on after the doctors have performed a simple check on the mole type, shape, color, elevation and size. If you follow them in the right way, you will be able to avoid scar formation or any irritation in the operated spot.
<br /><br />If a person has skin moles, there are great chances of getting skin tags as well. Thus when you are meeting the doctor, it is better to get consultation for removing both. 
<br /><br />How to remove a mole that is oval in shape and is of an average size? 
<br /><br />These types of moles don't have to be eliminated because they won't cause you any harm. However, if you want them gone so you'd look more attractive, cryotherapy or excision can easily deal with them with the least amount of scarring. It is not really pleasant to have a mole that is raised and quite of a large size to be located on a conspicuous area such as your cheek or forehead. Plastic surgery can be a better option in that case. 
<br /><br />Liquid nitrogen is also another option. The moles will be frozen by the liquid nitrogen. Freezing will weaken the connection between the skin and the moles. This facilitates the easy removal of moles.

Some stitches will be required to secure the area. This will be done by experienced doctors in the most painless way for the patient. Local anesthetics will be used to facilitate the operation. The healing process of the wound will be hastened. Once the operation is completed, you will not be able to trace out the original location of the moles.

This ranks as of the most searched for topics on the internet. This question is the focus of many websites. A lot of procedures are enumerated, but not all of them will work for everybody. For instance, some sites will be suggesting mole removal creams. But it would not be used to try out all those creams. First, you have to scrutinize the ingredients of these creams. These creams might contain ingredients that will trigger allergic reactions once they come into contact with your skin. Your skin problems will only become two times or three times worse. Practice caution when it comes to using them.
<br /><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/178785637_14528980_48831096.jpg" />
<br />You will also come across many suggestions that do not have solid proof as to their efficacy and safety. For instance, some people might have tried difficult techniques using unsterilized scalpels to remove the skin warts. Going right ahead with that technique without getting a full grasp of the potential pain that you will feel, as well as the infection due to unclean tools, you'll have bigger problems. A well-researched technique that is proven safe and effective should be chosen.
<br /><br />The main causative agent for these skin warts is the virus. It is the HPV or the human papilloma virus, to be more precise. The shape of warts are normally oval. They seem like a painless bunch. But skin warts are very contagious, no matter how harmless they appear to be. Removing skin warts can be accomplished by following the following simple suggestions. Before resorting to using various chemicals or undergoing cryotherapy, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2VuLndpa2lwZWRpYS5vcmcvd2lraS9FeGNpc2lvbg__" target="_blank">excision</a> or any other medical procedure, you should try some home remedies first. One of the most successful home remedies to remove warts is the use of calcium supplements.
<br /><br />Compared to other wart removal methods, this is deemed by many to be one of the best. It is important to make sure you take these supplements daily. Do not expect results from this treatment in a week. It might take some time. However, rest assured that it won't take you forever, especially if you keep it up regularly. It will not only cure you of your current warts, because it will also put precautions in place that will prevent warts from appearing in the future. 
<br /><br />Are you aware of the power of Vitamins A and E in removing warts? You can easily buy Vitamin A and E oils from your usual stores and their efficacy in removing warts have been known for ages now. These oils have actually got excellent healing properties. Buy these oils and directly put them on your skin warts at least twice a day.
<br /><br />The healing properties of castor oil is also no joke. Apply it on the skin warts twice a day. Dilute it with some water before direct application. You can also choose to mix it with baking soda instead. But the concentration of baking soda added must be less. Your skin will suffer greatly if there's too much of it. You might even end up with burnt skin. I recommend applying it mildly. You may also use bandage to tie around the warts. This is performed on a daily basis till the growth of wart subsides.

Scars and pimples are no longer something that people have to put up with. Warts and other skin problems too. While it's not technically a skin problem, many people feel the same way toward moles. That explains the popularity of various <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5tb2xlcmVtb3ZhbC5uZXQ_" target="_blank">removing a mole</a> treatments and methods.
<br /><br />What brings about these things we call moles? The medical name for a mole is nevus, and it is basically a dark spot or pigmented lesion on the skin. They come in all sizes, shapes and color, ranging from skin tone to dark brown or black. Moles could appear throughout one's lifetime, but if they appear at birth, these are referred to as congenital moles. In contrast, these types of moles are called acquired moles. Moles are common and it's not strange to have them appear; however, there are people who are more prone to moles than others. Physiology has a lot to answer for when it comes to the number of moles one has. It is normal to see fair-skinned people have more moles than those with darker skin.
<br /><br />There are times when heredity can also be blamed for this. My cousin has a lot of moles all over her body, and we can safely say that it was because her mother also has a substantial number of moles since she was a child. These moles are referred to as atypical or dysplastic moles. There are also instances when these dysplastic moles appear on the skin due to prolonged exposure to the sun.
<br /><br />There is not one area of the where moles choose to appear in. A few might appear in one random area, while many more could appear in another. My cousin's face is free from even a single speck of mole. But the concentration of moles is around her neck and upper chest area. It wasn't only until recently that she found out she can actually undergo mole removal procedures to get rid of them.<img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/178785637_2482551_49270472.jpg" />
<br /><br />Why do people remove <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5ubG0ubmloLmdvdi9tZWRsaW5lcGx1cy9tb2xlcy5odG1s" target="_blank">moles</a> ? Moles are, after all, anomalies or irregularities on the skin. If your moles actually enhance your looks and resemble Cindy Crawford's beauty mark, I see no reason why you should get rid of the moles. But we are not all Cindy Crawford or other supermodels with beauty marks. Lesser mortals -that's us -are unlucky enough to be saddled with moles that are far from flattering. They most definitely need to go.
<br /><br />Getting rid of moles is not purely appearance-driven. Some moles actually pose the risk of melanoma or skin cancer. In fact, it is considered to be the deadliest form of skin disease. They might start out innocently enough, but there are some moles that, over time, gradually develop into something cancerous. If you have a lot of moles, your concern or worry would probably even be greater.
<br /><br />Aside from observing the moles, you should also have a doctor diagnose whether your moles are cancerous or not. If they are diagnosed as cancerous, look into the possible mole removal methods that you can undergo. You can choose among lotions, creams, and even surgical operations and excision. The final decision will be based on the type of mole you have and the level of risk that they have.

Before trying out any new treatment, it is advisable to meet a dermatologist. Before suggesting any kind of treatment, the doctors will usually examine the status of the moles. If you have a mole that is considered quite large and is actually growing, you may need more than the simple natural methods being suggested. You may use the natural remedies but the results you want could take ages before they appear. But if you try surgeries for such moles, you will benefit in a faster period of time. While it is true that slight scarring could occur, you will still be able to bring back the beauty of your face.
<br /><br />Patients are often asked to have a biopsy test taken. If the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2VuLndpa2lwZWRpYS5vcmcvd2lraS9CaW9wc3k_" target="_blank">biopsy</a> test is negative, then you can go ahead with the natural treatments for tiny moles. If, on the other hand, the biopsy tests reveal the moles are cancerous, you need to undergo other methods. You would most likely be asked to have those moles removed through excision. Complete removal of the moles must be done. Leaving behind small remnants of the moles does not fully remove the cancer. 
<br /><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/178785637_14528980_48831096.jpg" />
<br />It is often recommended for older people to undergo laser treatments. If the patients are too old and they are unable to bear the pain of surgery, they can try the laser treatment. An important advantage of the laser method is that it will target only the moles. The laser will not have any adverse effects on the skin around the mole. The moles will be completely obliterated once they are hit with the laser light. The pigments within the moles will be damaged. The outermost dermal layer will also be affected by the process. You will require no more than several treatments if the moles you are having treated are of small sizes. If the moles are too large, then you will have to attend many such sessions. In each session, a certain proportion of the mole will be removed. At the last session, you might spot some slight scarring. Give it time and they will soon fade; just make sure you do not expose it to the sun too much or scratch it. You can expect that there will be more scars in excision than in laser treatment. Aside from being more painful, razors can also cause more scarring.
<br /><br />Aside from pre treatment measures, you should also have post treatment measures to take after undergoing the process. An example of a pre treatment measure is the application of cleansers on the areas affected before putting garlic paste or cumin seed paste on them. If cleansers are not applicable in your case, lukewarm water or soapy water would do. They will effectively wash away all the dirt and dust off your face.
<br /><br />Caring for your face or skin does not end when the treatment has been successfully carried out and you've gotten the results you wanted. Avoiding extreme sunlight is extremely important. If the skin gets too exposed to the sun too much and for too long, the damage would be bigger. You may have gotten rid of all those moles completely, but in their place, dark spots could appear. Thus the entire effort taken to remove moles will be lost.

Anyone who is contemplating undergoing surgery in any form would be most concerned about the amount of pain he or she will possibly have to suffer throughout the whole process. That explains the sudden surge of popularity of laser surgery for those who can't bear to experience too much pain.
<br /><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/178785637_14528980_48831096.jpg" />
<br />Electro surgery is also a wonderful option. Radio frequency ablation methods as well as electro surgery method are some of the latest methods used to <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5tb2xlcmVtb3ZhbC5uZXQ_" target="_blank">remove moles</a>. Mole removal is not the only thing this procedure accomplishes, since it could also handle even skin tags and the most stubborn of warts.
<br /><br />You should be aware of the two-fold advantage this procedure offers. First, there is the speed of the results being apparent. You can immediately remove the moles in any area of the body. It does not even matter if the mole is large or small.
<br /><br />You can remove all your moles - big and small. Next, there is also the advantage of being painless. If it is the accompanying pain that is stopping you from signing up for an operation, then there is no longer any need to worry. Local anesthesia will be given and thus you will not feel the pain. 
<br /><br />If you choose the natural method, you should still prepare before undergoing it. The same is true if you chose the surgery method. You must make sure the affected area will be thoroughly cleansed. There are so many cleansing agents that doctors choose from. The choice of cleansing agents range from simple alcohol to specialized agents such as Betadine. 
<br /><br />The two options of doctors before they conduct mole removal via electro surgery are topical creams and injections. You can also expect it to heal quick. Within 4 days, you can probably expect to see your original skin. In some cases, it might take more than a week or ten days to heal. Basically, the time for it to heal will depend on the type of mole and its measurements. If the lesion is quite deep, expect to wait a little bit more.
<br /><br />This method will also prevent the recurrence of moles and warts after they have been removed. Rest assured that it will not spread out. This treatment will only be performed under sterile conditions. 
<br /><br />There are certain treatments that require the use of prophylactic antibiotics. But that is not the case with electro surgery. It would be enough to make use of topical creams. Following these steps will ensure complete healing. When there are more stitches and <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2VuLndpa2lwZWRpYS5vcmcvd2lraS9TdXJnaWNhbF9zdXR1cmU_" target="_blank">sutures</a>, there will be more pain associated with such measures. Since no sutures are involved in electro surgery mole removal method, you can be free of pain.
<br /><br />Even radio surgeries are taken by many people because of the absence of pain. If possible, they would also want a treatment procedure that can remove all three: skin tags, moles and warts. In this way, they need not get operated for each problem as a separate case.
