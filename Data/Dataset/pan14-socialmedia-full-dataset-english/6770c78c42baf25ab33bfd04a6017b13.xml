<br />      For so long we have missed the point of sin in the action of blaspheming the Holy Spirit, the church must arise and wake and walk the walk we were called to.  The Word blaspheme has several meanings, all of which center around one very solid theological conclusion.  If you’re disobeying God”s Word in any form of deliberate action, you’re blasphing the Holy Spirit, the unforgivable sin!  Mar 3:29  But he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost hath never forgiveness, but is in danger of eternal damnation: 
<br /><br />A primitive root; to scorn; or (Ecc_12:5) by interchange for H5132, to bloom: - abhor, (give occasion to) blaspheme, contemn, despise, flourish, X great, provoke.
<br />1) to spurn, contemn, despise, abhor
<br />1a) (Qal) to spurn, contemn
<br />1<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cool.gif" alt=":)" /> (Piel)
<br />1b1) to spurn
<br />1b2) to cause to contemn
<br />1c) (Hiphil) to spurn
<br />1d) (Hithpolel) to be contemned
<br />(by euphemism) to curse (God or the king, as treason): -  X abundantly, X altogether, X at all, blaspheme, bless, congratulate, curse, X greatly, X indeed, kneel (down), praise, salute, X still, thank that which is not God.
<br />to vilify; specifically to speak impiously: - (speak) blaspheme (-er, -mously, -my), defame, rail on, revile, speak evil.
<br />1) to speak reproachfully, rail at, revile, calumniate, blaspheme
<br />2) to be evil spoken of, reviled, railed at
<br />A primitive root; to hack (with words), that is, revile: - blaspheme, reproach.
<br />A primitive root; to be right (that is, correct); reciprocally to argue; causatively to decide, justify or convict: - appoint, argue, chasten, convince, correct (-ion), daysman, dispute, judge, maintain, plead, reason (together), rebuke, reprove (-r), surely, in any wise.
<br />1. To speak of the Supreme Being in terms of impious irreverence; to revile or speak reproachfully of God, or the Holy Spirit. 1 Ki 21. Mark 3.
<br />2. To speak evil of; to utter abuse or calumny against; to speak reproachfully of.
<br /><br />This particular one is my favorite description, as it covers the totality of the nature of the word:  To speak out against the work of, labor of, existance of, to bring oneself or another to denying the work of or ceasing from the labor of The Holy Spirit 
<br />Let us examine this last description, with God’s Word as the substantiation.  1Ti 1:20  Of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander; whom I have delivered unto Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme. 
<br />These two, were known for the argumntativeness and following after their fleshly desires.  Jas 2:6  But ye have despised the poor. Do not rich men oppress you, and draw you before the judgment seats? 
<br />Jas 2:7  Do not they blaspheme that worthy name by the which ye are called? 
<br />Jas 2:8  If ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well: 
<br />Jas 2:9  But if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin, and are convinced of the law as transgressors. 
<br />Jas 2:10  For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all. 
<br />Jas 2:11  For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law. 
<br />These scriptures, pretty much sum it all up, to break even one of these laws, is to commit a blasphemous act.  Just a thought, but didn’t we discover the only unforgivable sin is to blaspheme the Holy Spirit?  Then how is it the Word of God says, if you do not forgive, you will not be forgiven?  Mat 6:15  But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses. 
<br />To not forgive someone is a blatant act of disrespect for God’s Word, an act of disobediance.  Mat 6:15  But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses. 
<br /><br />For those of us who were married by means of traditional vows, should remember one particular line in your vows, till death do you part.  It was by no means of coincidence or fancy writing, these words were established in the wedding vows.  Marriage is of God, established by God, ordained by God, thus the importance of this phrase.  Should you, repent of your wilful disobediance, you will be forgiven.  Mar 3:28  Verily I say unto you, All sins shall be forgiven unto the sons of men, and blasphemies wherewith soever they shall blaspheme: 
<br />God in His awesome love, tender mercies, and grace, is always ready willing and able to forgive us our trespasses.  To me this is great news and the kind of Father I want to love more and more and serve wholeheartedly, with a worshipful heart and an obedient spirit, all the days of my life.  
<br /><br />How about you, isn’t this perfect God worth your everything?

<br /><br />&quot;Obey your leaders and submit to them,
<br />for they are keeping watch over your souls, 
<br />as those who will have to give an account.
<br />Let them do this with joy and not with groaning, 
<br />for that would be of no advantage to you.&quot; 
<br />—Hebrews 13:17
<br /><br />Sit back and think about it - you want the best spiritual direction possible, but 
<br /><br />are you taking that person for granted?
<br /><br />This article began with an e-mail from Curt Hendley, a dear friend in 
<br /><br />ministry.  Curt has developed a burden for encouraging ministers and he sent 
<br /><br />this e-mail to 50 blogging ministers asking them to write something on how 
<br /><br />congregants can encourage their ministers.   Curt has now set up a permanent 
<br /><br />page on his blog where he is compiling and linking to replies. 
<br /><br />The fact that someone cares enough to ask pastors what would encourage them 
<br /><br />is, in and of itself, a great encouragement.  With that in mind, I sent the 
<br /><br />following suggestions to Curt and offer them to you.
<br /><br />Take your own spiritual growth seriously
<br /><br />&quot;Nice sermon pastor&quot; and &quot;you're a good pastor&quot; are wonderful to hear but 
<br /><br />what we really want to hear is that you are growing in your walk with Christ.  
<br /><br />This is why we are in ministry, we want to see people come to Christ and grow 
<br /><br />in Christ.  We take your spiritual growth seriously and one of the greatest 
<br /><br />encouragements to us is to see you taking it as seriously as we do.
<br /><br />Several years ago a group I was working with a group from our church that 
<br /><br />was painting our rented facility.  The pastor joined me in the room I was 
<br /><br />working in and made the comment that he really enjoyed doing this painting 
<br /><br />because he could see the results of his work immediately.  He explained that in 
<br /><br />ministry we don't really see the results of our work unless the numbers are 
<br /><br />growing and budgets are increasing.  Yet, ministers also know that increasing 
<br /><br />numbers and budgets aren't the best measure of effectiveness and we know that 
<br /><br />a lot of significant ministry can be going on where the growth is minimal. 
<br /><br />But again, even where growth may be happening we don't often see it and 
<br /><br />many of us struggle with whether or not we are really making a difference in 
<br /><br />the lives of our folks.  By taking your spiritual growth seriously you encourage 
<br /><br />your minister that he is making a difference.
<br /><br />I’m writing to you and other blogging pastors because I have a question only a 
<br /><br />pastor can answer. I’ve been growing increasingly aware of how difficult the 
<br /><br />job of pastor can be. I know that pastors often receive a lot more criticism than 
<br /><br />encouragement, and that can lead to all sorts of bad feelings. I think, though, 
<br /><br />that most congregations truly love their pastors but don’t understand how 
<br /><br />much encouragement is needed or how to practically provide that 
<br /><br />encouragement. I also think that pastors are generally and understandably 
<br /><br />reluctant to ask for such encouragement or display any human weakness at all.
<br /><br />I personally love my pastor, and I’m keenly aware of many things that beat 
<br /><br />him down in his ministry. Most of those things are entirely out of my control 
<br /><br />or influence. I would like to provide encouragement to him myself and incite 
<br /><br />others to do so as well. But I know enough to know that I have no idea exactly 
<br /><br />what issues a pastor faces that members of the congregation could alleviate. I 
<br /><br />just don’t know what to do or how to go about providing the most effective 
<br /><br />encouragement for him.
<br /><br />My request to you is that you respond with a blog post (or a link to a post if 
<br /><br />you’ve already written one) listing some practical ways a congregation can 
<br /><br />encourage their pastor. If you’re reticent about revealing that sort of thing on 
<br /><br />your own blog, I would be happy to post something you write on my blog and 
<br /><br />remove your name from it–sort of an &quot;advice from an anonymous pastor&quot; kind 
<br /><br />of thing. I really want to know this, and I want the flock to stop being unaware 
<br /><br />of their shepherd’s humanity and needs.
<br /><br />If you decide to write a post about this, please let me know so I can read it and 
<br /><br />link to it.
<br /><br />Sincerely,
<br />Curt Hendley
<br />The Happy Husband

<br /><br />Being a Godly pastor must be the most difficult job in the world. CEOs of 
<br /><br />corporations must weather attacks from competitors, and leaders of countries 
<br /><br />must deal with other countries’ leaders as well as politicians within their own 
<br /><br />countries, but pastors have to protect themselves, their families, and their 
<br /><br />churches from attacks by Satan himself. The fact that so many pastors get little 
<br /><br />love and support from their congregations goes a long way toward explaining 
<br /><br />why so many pastors resign every day.
<br /><br />I’m collecting all the responses I get on this page. Please check out these links 
<br /><br />and see how you can serve your pastor:
<br /><br />•Peter Bogert: &quot;To me, the greatest encouragement in ministry takes place 
<br /><br />when people connect with what I am preaching or teaching. Seeing a group of 
<br /><br />people who are interested, alert, attentive—these things are what encourage a 
<br /><br />pastor the most.…That being said, here are a few tangible and non-tangible 
<br /><br />ways to encourage.…&quot;
<br />•Tod Bolsinger: &quot;If you ask any of my executive staff, they will tell you of how 
<br /><br />many people have come along side them, joined them in ministry and cared for 
<br /><br />them personally. And it is my confidence in this community of people that 
<br /><br />allows me to promise my staff that together we will all aim to have ‘a great 
<br /><br />ministry and a great life.…‘
<br />•Glenn Buzbee: &quot;Churches can be like middle school. Or like playgrounds beset 
<br /><br />by a handful of bullies. It only takes one or two kids on the playground to stand 
<br /><br />up to the bullies and say ‘Stop! No more!’ God just may be calling you to be one 
<br /><br />of those kids to stand up and speak out; but while it is scary to defy a bully in 
<br /><br />your congregation (and even a best friend could be one) if you don’t, then who 
<br /><br />will?…&quot;
<br />•Jason Dollar: &quot;I do not want to come across as moaning about how neglected 
<br /><br />the pastor is. But I do understand that pastors need encouragement, too. And 
<br /><br />the more a pastor is encouraged, given that he is laboring for the glory of God 
<br /><br />and not self, the better he will carry out his duties.…&quot;
<br />•Byron Harvey: &quot;1) Be a friend to your pastor. 2) Ask me how I’m doing 
<br /><br />sometime. 3) 3. Once in awhile, tell me how something I’ve done has made a 
<br /><br />difference.…&quot;
<br />•Noel Heikkinen: &quot;For me, [this question] takes more the form of ‘Things I Wish 
<br /><br />People Knew.’ I think if these things were realized, more encouragement could 
<br /><br />happen organically. …&quot;
<br />•Bowden McElroy: &quot;For me, the no-agenda, our-treat, we-just-want-to-hang-
<br /><br />out-doing-what-you-like dinner and a ball game was the best. I think too many 
<br /><br />pastors simply don’t have friends.…&quot;
<br />McElroy, part 2: &quot;I said, &quot;Be a friend&quot;. Now, Curt wants to know: how?…&quot; 
<br />McElroy, part 3: &quot;Forget it’s the pastor, is this someone you would invite for 
<br /><br />coffee? Or, to play golf? Or, to just ‘hang out’? If yes, then pursue that 
<br /><br />friendship like any other.…&quot; 
<br />•Pat Morley: &quot;If you want to connect with your pastor, the overarching idea is 
<br /><br />don’t put demands on him. Instead, help him accomplish his mission. In that 
<br /><br />way, you will be part of his ministry instead of the object of his ministry.…&quot;
<br />•Steve Pedersen: &quot;My Pastors’ Prayer Group met today on a 30 foot sailboat.…I 
<br /><br />asked the guys a question to start off our conversation: How can a 
<br /><br />congregation encourage their pastor? The guys on the boat responded with 
<br /><br />these ideas…&quot;
<br />•Pastor Russ: &quot;Your pastor loves you. He cares about you. He prays for you. He 
<br /><br />works hard for you. Reciprocate those things and you will find that even as he 
<br /><br />ministers to you, that you are ministering to him.…&quot;
<br />•Mark Van Der Hurst: &quot;What has my church done to encourage me? I have 
<br /><br />shared this with several pastor friends and have had a blogger ask for some 
<br /><br />ideas to encourage his pastor. So, here is my experience/feeble attempt at 
<br /><br />talking about a time OUT.…&quot;
<br />•David Wayne (aka Jollyblogger): &quot;1. Take your own spiritual growth seriously. 
<br /><br />2. Give your best to the church, not your leftovers. 3. Remind him that you are 
<br /><br />for him.…&quot;
<br />•Craig Williams: &quot;Begin here, trust and respect, until we prove untrustworthy 
<br /><br />or unreliable.…&quot;
<br /><br />It's not the size of the congregation, numbers either reflect God in the 
<br /><br />study of gemetria, or in most churches today, reflect the feather on ears effect
<br />Big churches with big programs serve what Godly purpose?  For the most part, 
<br /><br />in any church I have gone to visit or minister in; their groups serve only as a 
<br /><br />gathering house for gossip or some form of money making personal agenda, 
<br /><br />leaving God's way outside the door to the facility.  Do you suppose that's why 
<br /><br />Jesus said, Rev 3:20  Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear 
<br /><br />my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and 
<br /><br />he with me.  Drive by any big or small church today and with spiritual eyes 
<br /><br />ask God to show you which name is over the door.  If He shows you Ichabod, 
<br /><br />then His glory has been removed from that congregation, He has labled this so, 
<br /><br />because he is not ans has for a long time, never been welcome there.  If you 
<br /><br />have a hunger for more of God in your life and you find this sign over your 
<br /><br />door, then it's time to ask God where He wants you to be that you can grow 
<br /><br />and experience His presence!</em></strong>

<br /><br />It has been brought to my attention as of late, through the Holy Spirit, that men, husbands are deceived through displaced thinking.  Mar 12:24  Jesus told them, &quot;Are you not deceived because you don't know the Scriptures or the power of God?
<br />Granted, God did say the woman is the weaker vessel; 1Pe 3:7  Husbands, in the same way, live with your wives with understanding of their weaker nature yet showing them honor as co-heirs of the grace of life, so that your prayers will not be hindered. 
<br />What man in his right mind, would take occasion to lord over his wife?  If the woman, as Adam said, is bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh, then the man would be out of the will of God, while actually lording over himself. This stupid man action however; does not give allowance or occasion for a woman to disrespect her husband.  This wrongful action in fact should bring the woman to the throne of grace at the Lord’s feet, where the woman can make her request known.  First the cry of her heart, even in her pain asking that the Lord’s will be done, then thanking Him for making it so.  When a person continues to ask over and over and over, the same request, where is the faith in this action, so ask, believe, thank God and receive your answer, Heb 11:1  Now faith is the reality of what is hoped for, the proof of what is not seen. 
<br />Keep in mind, when Jesus said do not continue in vain prayers, Mat 6:7  When you pray, don't babble like the idolaters, since they imagine they'll be heard for their many words.
<br />When women verses men, men for the most part lose in the communicative skills area, but; this is a good thing, as God loves to hear from His children.  Remember though, if you talk too much, you cannot hear all that is said, when God speaks, it’s in the still small voice.  Man was made in the image of God and women were made in the image of man, woman may have gotten the better deal, because the rib that woman was made from, comes from a place next to the heart.  Maybe, women got the heart of God in the transfer, because men build Jericho walls around their hearts as a measure of protection.  There in lays a prayer for women to pray for their men, ask that God tear down the Jericho walls of the man’s heart and fill it with His love.  One other advantage of taking things to the Lord vs. man, Mar 10:27  Looking at them, Jesus said, &quot;With men it is impossible, but not with God, because all things are possible with God.&quot;
<br />There is nothing that the man can do to appease or fix any problem, but God is far more able and capable and yes, even willing to make things right and He will get the glory for it.
<br />     It is my earnest hope that you are blessed, because you put this into action, believing, that you will see good results.
<br />     1Co 11:3  But I want you to know that Christ is the head of every man, and the man is the head of the woman, and God is the head of Christ. 
<br />The scripture does not by any means negate the authority or leadership ability of women, it is the proper chain of command that God set up, and should be followed.  Women, be the leader God called you to be, Esther rescued the house of Israel in leadership and you ,too can rescue your household in the same fashion!  God bless each and every one of you as you apply, with love, the teaching.

<br /><br />I can’t speak for others, but I know I’m not alone;  1Co 10:13  No temptation has overtaken you except what is common to humanity. God is faithful and He will not allow you to be tempted beyond what you are able, but with the temptation He will also provide a way of escape, so that you are able to bear it. 
<br />Periodically, men and women in the 5 fold ministry go through things, we tell no one about as telling someone generally means weakness.  This translates into speculation and even gossip from the body and from gossip to loss of hope within the flock.  I’m here to let you know that if you’re not praying for the leadership in your church, you’re not being obedient to the whole Word of God.  On the other hand, if the leadership is not requesting prayer from the flock as well as the other leadership, you’re walking in pride.  Jas 5:16  Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed. The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much. 
<br />Here’s a strange thought, one that is a little hard to swallow, but yet holds great truth, when God chastens you, He is showing you His love.  Job 5:17  Behold, happy is the man whom God correcteth: therefore despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty: 
<br />Pro 3:11  My son, despise not the chastening of the LORD; neither be weary of his correction: 
<br />Heb 12:5  And ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children, My son, despise not thou the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked of him: 
<br />Heb 12:7  If ye endure chastening, God dealeth with you as with sons; for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not? 
<br />Heb 12:11  Now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous: nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby. 
<br />Rev 3:19  As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten: be zealous therefore, and repent. 
<br />2Sa 7:14  I will be his father, and he shall be my son. If he commit iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the children of men: 
<br />Pro 19:18  Chasten thy son while there is hope, and let not thy soul spare for his crying. 
<br />These are but a few verses whereby, some wish it wasn’t so, but; God is perfect and complete in all manner of things.  
<br />     Now you have to, or at least should ask yourself, are you being fully and completely obedient to the Word of God.  For the body, are you praying selfless prayers for your leadership, without any attached agendas?  If you are not, you’re not only being disobediant to God, but you’re also being disrespectful to Him all all authority placed over you.  Leadership over you does not necessarily cover in house or behind the pulpit.  It includes; worship leaders, associate Pastors, Bishops, Prophets or Prophetesses, Apostles, Teachers, Evangelists, members of the worship team, program leaders, coffeshop personel, kitchen staff, and yes, even those in the helps category, right down to the person cleaning the toilets.  Each of these people, are officers in God’s eyes and each of them needs a constant covering, with no personal agendas attached in prayer.  Men and woman, the officers of God, especially the officers of God, are no better and no different than you or I, they need covering also.  These men and women of God, lay their lives on the line everyday for you, and when you have a need, they’re there for you, to the best of their ability as frail human beings.  How many times do you seek out one of these officers of God and ask for prayer for this or prayer for that, and they’re johnny on the spot to lift your needs up in prayer.  How many times do they not just lift up your request, but they also ask God for the strength and peace to carry you through?  Now, how many times have you ever ernestly asked them if they need prayer and you’ve carried through with a heart burdening fervency?
<br />     Let’s look at the otherside of the coin, I, being a Pastor, don’t ask for prayer, why; because I’m able to go to the Lord for my own needs.  The other evening, the Lord got all over my case, chastening me, why; for being arogant and prideful.  I’ve been going through somethings, heavy burdens, asking God to give me wisdom and understanding over what I’m going through and God brought more weight to bare, without explaination or direction.  God the Father was virtually bringing down my house around me, I’m standing, I’m standing, I’m fighting and all to no avail.  Then God spoke, and I didn’t like what I heard, He said I was being prideful, never asking for prayer, never relying on the body to care for the shephard.  In other words, I was not showing my weakness in confession of need, nor was I trusting the body to stand up for me, in my hour of need.  In my no trusting them, the God, Jesus in them, I was holding them back from their next level.  How about it leaders, is that something you want to hear, I didn’t think so because I didn’t want to hear it either.  If your leadership doesn’t ask for prayer, pray for them anyway, and leadership; if you’re not asking for prayer, is your pride standing in the way and causing your flock to not go to higher ground?  1Th 5:17  Pray without ceasing. 
<br />If you start praying one for another, you won’t have time to stop, you won’t have time to enter into sin, because praying can definitely keep you busy.  Jas 5:16  Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed. The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much. 
<br />Don’t just pray half heartedly either, the Lord God demands whole hearted attention in all things.  Col 3:23  And whatsoever ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men; 
<br />Mat 6:6  But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly. 
<br />     This message is as much to the leadership as it is to the flock; God wants all His children to be blessed, because he loves us that much, and because of Him, so do I!

<br /><br />1Co 2:9  But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him. 
<br />Heb 11:1  Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. 
<br />     We had been having a revival at our church, I’m no spring chicken, but I was catching.  There was a rather tall, well built young man, who seemed to be constantly getting in the way while presenting himself as a cather.  It’s never a good thing to stand behind someone, in the way of others trying to handle the task of catching and allowing people to fall.  Now there is a great discernable difference between a person going down in the flesh and one going down in the Spirit.  I was there attending to my position every night, and every night, this man stood in the way of catchers till they got frustrasted and stopped trying to catch.  After 3 weeks, it finally happened, he stood between me and the person I was trying to catch, so I ducked under him and proceeded to take my position in readiness.  He grabbed me and threw me out of the way and I just retook my place again.  Again, he threw me out of the way, I sort of looked at him, wondering what his problem was.  I stood up and proceeded once again to try to take my position, then it happened, he pulled me away, turned me around and punched me in the chest.
<br />     A little history about me, I am a martial artist and though it sounds like brag, it’s not intended to be.  I went 25 years in the ring, undefeated, I was the cruelest fighter of all.  I was willing to die to win and my opponents could see it in m y eyes.  Most of the time when that look came in my eyes, my opponents left the ring, because they knew from what they saw, I didn’t care about anything accept winning, no matter the cost!
<br />     Let’s return now to this fateful night, when he punched me, it was hard enough to drop me to my hands and knees.  The dead man in me began to arise, and as I began to stand up, my mind filled with the thought patterns of my past.  In the 1st second, I thought of how many ways do I know how to kill a man and which one would I use.  In the 2nd second, my mind filled with an even worse vengeance of thoughts, how many different ways do I know how to hurt a man and leave him with a lifelong pain, so he would remember, never do this again.  Then the 3rd second came, and as I looked up with death in my eyes and a hateful desire in my heart to inflict massive pain on this man, I heard the Holy Spirit clearly say, “who are you going to show?”  I lowered my head and removed myself from the sanctuary and sat with my Pastor in the sound booth.  My Pastor knew, something had happened, from the time I stood up till the time I looked at the man, wanting to cause him pain, he said, so what did He, meaning the Holy Spirit, say to you?  During this period of time, my days were really long, I was getting up at 3AM, so I could spend time with the Lord before I went to work.  From work, I would race home, grab something to eat, shower, shave, get dressed and return back to church, where I would be till idnight or after.  My Pastor said it was time for me to get some rest, so I did, but I was awed and stunned at the same time, by the events that had just taken place.  I praised God all the way home,  got to see 1st hand in action, 1Jn 4:4  Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world. 
<br />To my blessing, those words have stood in rememberance, everytime I run into similar circumstances, but now they are always before the flesh thoughts.  
<br />     Recently, I had the occasion to see this man again at another church, there appeared to be no difference in his actions or demeanor.   A couple of days ago, for no apparent reason, those words rang out loud again, causing me to ponder on everything that had taken place, until that new moment of thought.  “Who are you going to show?”, made me wonder, not only about Whom  I would choose to display that fateful night, but who actually did I show it to?  The only person who actually saw my choice of whom to show was me and I was the only one effected by all events surrounding the many times those words were heard.  Then the Lord led me back to a strange place in my mind, this is what He said, you have faith as big as a mountain for others, but you lack that faith for you.  I am a visual person when it comes to my life and anything that directly surrounds my life.  As an unsaved person, my life consisted of hatred and I lived for anger, anger was my drive and my focus.  I could see the results of my anger and see them immediately, no matter the task, I got the desired results and anger was my fuel.  That does not mean that everything I did was of an evil and hateful nature, it just means anger fueled my accomplishment quotient.
<br />     It was right here at this moment of clarity, I realized, I was still looking for that accompliment quotient, but instead of anger as the fuel, it had to be love as the fuel.  This is where the Lord stepped into change my thought patterns and direct my footsteps correctly.  He said, your fuel must be faith, while your foundation is love, and in this, hope is resurrected.  1Co 13:13 So these three things continue: faith, hope, and love. And the greatest of these is love.
<br />God always, already had a plan in place, and if you have enough faith to believe God, He will show you and the Holy Spirit will teach you truth and no lie.
<br /><br />If God is working in your life and your letting Him, praise Him, His works are always perfect!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<br />So what is your faith, before this moment, my faith was what I could see, but now, because of His immence love, He has taught me to take my faith, personally for me.

<br />Did you ever have a moment when you stood in front of the mirror, when suddenly scripture jumped out at you
<br />Did you ignore it, or did you aspire to live it?
<br />The only one that can truly answer that would be God, for we know scripture states, the heart is deceitfully wicked, who can know it!
<br /><br />When Jesus looks upon my life ... ... ... 
<br /><br />What picture does He see. 
<br />Does He see His own reflection, 
<br />Or does He just see me. 
<br /><br />Does He see His likeness, 
<br /><br />The product of His hand. 
<br />Or just another Christian, 
<br />Who never took a stand. 
<br /><br />Does He see a child of God, 
<br /><br />A child that He set free. 
<br />Living life to honor Him, 
<br />Or does He just see me. 
<br /><br />What about the other folks, 
<br /><br />I meet along the way. 
<br />Do I show them Jesus, 
<br />To brighten up their day. 
<br /><br />When someone looks into my eyes, 
<br /><br />Can they truly see. 
<br />That calm and gentle peace of God, 
<br />That dwells inside of me. 
<br /><br />When I reach out and shake a hand, 
<br /><br />Is He right there in my grip. 
<br />Can they feel that strength from God, 
<br />That steadies when I slip. 
<br /><br />When folks are in my presence, 
<br /><br />Do they know His Spirit's there. 
<br />Can they see that He's the one, 
<br />Who guides me everywhere. 
<br /><br />When other people think of me, 
<br /><br />What is on their mind. 
<br />Do they think of Jesus Christ, 
<br />So gentle and so kind. 
<br /><br />I try to be like Jesus, 
<br /><br />Every single day. 
<br />Spreading love and kindness, 
<br />All along my way. 
<br /><br />I'm afraid that I have failed, 
<br /><br />I could not pass the test. 
<br />Deep inside my heart I know, 
<br />I haven't done my best. 
<br /><br />I have had to fight my flesh, 
<br /><br />Since the day that I was born. 
<br />It's always causing trouble, 
<br />And being such a thorn. 
<br /><br />That's why His Spirit dwells in me, 
<br /><br />He's helping me to learn. 
<br />In every situation, 
<br />Where I need to turn. 
<br /><br />He knew I'd never pass the test, 
<br /><br />That's why He took my place. 
<br />He gave His life to save my soul, 
<br />He suffered my disgrace. 
<br /><br />Now I try to be like Him, 
<br /><br />I must present Him well. 
<br />So other folks will want His gift, 
<br />And turn their backs on hell. 
<br /><br />Other folks should see the joy, 
<br /><br />That Christ has given me. 
<br />They should want to have it too, 
<br />Especially since it's free. 
<br /><br />They should begin to ask me, 
<br /><br />What is it they must do. 
<br />Just how it is they go about, 
<br />Getting Jesus too. 
<br /><br />Then I get to tell them, 
<br /><br />This wondrous gift is free. 
<br />It only takes a humble heart, 
<br />A prayer on bended knee. 
<br /><br />Someday when I'm face to face, 
<br /><br />With the Lord who set me free. 
<br />Will He see His own reflection, 
<br />Or will He just see me.

<br /><br />I can only hope that the Holy Spirit will help anyone who reads this to understand and be set free.  I am in my 15th year as a Christian, but only the last 8 years have I been desirous to be real and to search out the TRUTH of God’s Word.  I would sit and patiently listen to the preaching teachings of the men or women of God, which God placed over me, while looking at my watch, wondering how much longer.  Suddenly, as God is so good at doing, I got fed up with hearing the I thinks’ or I believe, this is what God is saying, half truth teachings from behind the pulpit.  This was the first portion of the calling on my life, God creating in me a hunger to know His TRUTH and start to walk in it.  In this God ordained establishment of hunger for His TRUTH, He also stirred in me the desire to know Him more and more.  Then came the desire and hunger for the sisterhood of understanding and wisdom, and freedom came with a vengeance and greater hunger to not only know the TRUTH and the character and nature of God, but to know and shed the very love of God.  Piece by piece, God chipped away at the hardened shell of the person I had become, because I never knew true, fulfilling love.  This message is not about quoting scripture, but it is about sharing the sisterhood of wisdom and understanding, hopefully by reminding you of what you already know from God’s perfect TRUTH.
<br />     I have had the pleasure of sitting under and even working with some great men and women of God, whose names I will not share at this time.  This message has to do with you and God Himself and not any man, it is when you put man before God, trouble comes.  I was taught by word of mouth and even God’s Word to honor the man or woman of God and submit to them, this is a felonious teaching, yet still true.  This is also the main reason for studying God’s Word, not from the English, the Latin, the German or even the Greek, but from the original context and language; the Hebrew.  If you remember as a child playing the game, rumors, you will understand what I say here is true.  In the game rumors, you would say something specific in the ear of the person next to you and they to the person next to them and so on down the line till you got to the last person.  This last person, would then say out loud, what was spoken to them, how much different was what they said than what you said to begin with.  This is the same way with the various translations of the Bible, bringing about a loss of the original message, in content, whole meaning and truth.
<br />     Well meaning, honest hearted, desirous to teach the truth of God’s Word, men and women of God, have inadvertently changed the message and the meaning of God’s TRUTH.  Add technology and a lazy attitude to the mix and the truth has become diluted and the habitation of God is but a visitation.  Most of the time locking the doors on the Lord, so He not only cannot enter, but is not welcome in  
<br />     Getting back to the root of this message; in my wanton desire to hold the man or woman of God in honor, I have wrongfully and mistakenly, put them above God, never ever meaning to.  Though I study and dig deep in God’s  Word, I still fell prey to the time constrained teachings of the speaker.  Due to the time constraints and people looking at their watches, wanting to race home because they think they have something more important to do than to be in the presence of God, satan’s favorite game is played at each service.  This game is the game of half truths, and half truths are what brought division into this world, between man and God, creating the fall.  These half truths are the very poison that brings a man or woman into bondage to the law of God, without the fullness of truth that gives grace to the believer.  
<br />     I, a Pastor, a studier of the word from the original language, have fallen prey to these half truth teachings.  I am but one of the Pastors at our church, I have learned, if my Pastor can fall prey to teaching in this time constrained manner, we’re all susceptible, and if I can fall prey to the chains of half truths, so can anyone of you!  
<br />     Have you ever wondered where is the God of Elijah? The God of power and might, the God of great and mighty things, the God of signs and wonders to follow, where is this mighty God?  He goes where He is wanted, where man has no agenda of his own, just a straight up God agenda, desirous hunger for the whole of God.  Now this question abides; what’s in your heart and how bad, how desperately do you want, the one and only awesome God, creator of the universe and everything in it, designer of you and all your intricacies?  Do you want Him bad enough to say out loud in the midst of your congregation, I want all of God and if you don’t, kindly move out of my way, so I can get closer!  When you put God above all others, above anything and everything else, He will make a way for your need whatever it is, even to bring mighty, loving, council into your life.  Remember, it is God, that’s put the true desire in your heart and he is faithful to give you the desires of you heart</em>.</strong>

<br /><br />I don’t know of anyone, in this day and age who is actually willing to admit they made a mistake, but how about when God points it out?  I am one known for challenging people’s thinking, but I do believe, by God’s design and by His Words.  Jesus showed us, it only takes one to change the world, Paul showed us this is very true in his walk through the ministry God gave him.  On the other hand, yet the same token, the church missed it, while satan never missed a beat.  The devil used one boysterous person to remove prayer from school, he also used one very vocal person, to subdue the truth of God’s Word regarding chastening our children.  If you are into visual perspectives as most large corporations are; it would appear, while the church has slept, satan is winning in his attempt at a hostile takeover of God’s throne and Kingdom.  Mat 25:1  Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom. 
<br />Mat 25:2  And five of them were wise, and five were foolish. 
<br />Mat 25:3  They that were foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them: 
<br />Mat 25:4  But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps. 
<br />Mat 25:5  While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept. 
<br />I need to highlight this last scripture; Mat 25:5  While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept. 
<br />And again;  they all slumbered and slept. 
<br />God put it out there for all to see but, it would almost seem as if it was hidden in plain sight and maybe meant for Kings, to not only search it out, but bring it to the attention of the body.  In this R.E.M. state, satan has gotten over on the church and done it quickly, but take note; he didn’t do it violently.  There is a reason for the highlighting of that last word!  The church as a whole has decided to attempt to make God in the image of man, thus showing not only their ignorance but also the unawareness of the enemy in their ranks.  Yes church, there is an enemy in your ranks, and you’re probably best friends with him or her as the case maybe.  The most amazing part of that statement is the fact that we go around trying to kill what we percieve as the enemy, but the only thing we as the church is doing is killing our own.  What if; the church, the real church, actually stood up and did exactly what God has been telling them to do for years and what if they did it with a here and now perspective of the reward?
<br />     We, the church long to hear someday; Mat 25:21  His lord said unto him, Well done, thou good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord. 
<br />Mat 25:23  His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord. 
<br />Luk 19:17  And he said unto him, Well, thou good servant: because thou hast been faithful in a very little, have thou authority over ten cities. 
<br />Lovely words aren’t they and yes the Lord said them, therefore we are called to believe in them, however; we too often lose sight of the goal.  We get sidetracked by every imaginable weapon satan has devised to entertain us, theme parks, water resorts, concrete jungles, and all other man built, mind boggling, self satisfying stimuli.  Instead of seeing things for what they are, then obediently following God’s Word, towards these stimuli, then; Mat 11:12  And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force. 
<br /><br />The Kingdom of God, suffered the violence, because we like to back bite and shoot one another, why?  The answer is in our first scriptures; Mat 25:5  While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept. 
<br />The church is and has been asleep, lulled into a secure sense by bad and or por teachings and laziness on the part of the supposed believer.  2Ti 2:15  Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth. 
<br />Though we would like to blame our teachers, preachers, and those who are supposed to be in leadership, this puts our failure to obey, squarely on our individual shoulders!
<br />     What if; we took on a new perspective, what if we had a here and present now goal, what if we sought the Kingdom of God and His righteousness for His sake but for our admonishment?  What if we could hear in our present state and time, job well done, it is possible, but we must be fully conformed to the image of Christ.  I’ve heard this remark before so, I take no surprize if someone thinks it isn’t for us, but we really should remember, what Christ went through, we also must be prepared to go through, and if our Father thought it noteworthy to tell Christ, then why not us?  Mat 3:17  And lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.   Mat 17:5  While he yet spake, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them: and behold a voice out of the cloud, which said, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him.   Luk 3:22  And the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape like a dove upon him, and a voice came from heaven, which said, Thou art my beloved Son; in thee I am well pleased.   
<br />2Pe 1:17  For he received from God the Father honour and glory, when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased
<br /><br />And the people heard it, and the people heard it, and the people heard it, imagine your friends, your family, your Pastor(s), even your teachers, standing around you and suddenly, God spoke out loud, the very words you have been waiting to hear.  2Pe 1:18  And this voice which came from heaven we heard, when we were with him in the holy mount. 
<br /><br />How encouraged would you be to continue on in full force and wearing full battle gear and going out ther and taking the Kingdom of heaven by storm.  What if these simple words brought us into a newfound unity in which the enemy was no longer those human beings in our church, 2Co 10:3  For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh: 
<br />What if we took the battle, to the proper battleground, Eph 6:12  For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. 
<br />Instead of us, the memebers of the body attacking the body, continuously making it weaker and weaker, we stood arm in interlocked arm and kept our eyes on the horizon for the enemy.  I’ll bet we wouldn’t have time to look at each other, trying to find the enemy within them, remember what Christ said; Mat 12:25  And Jesus knew their thoughts, and said unto them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand: 
<br />It’s well past time, we the people of the Kingdom of God, worked together, encouraging one another and fight the good fight, because fighting with your brother is not a good fight.
<br /><br />Father, everyone that reads this, change them to be your perfect servant, and anyone that glimpses Lord, bring a hunger to know in them, in Jesus precious name
<br /><br />Amen</em></strong>

<br /><br />Mat 27:34  They gave him wine to drink mingled with gall. And, after tasting it, he was unwilling to drink.
<br /><br />What an amazing scripture, Jesus beaten, bloodied, slapped, shamed, and His dignity removed, still chose for our sakes, not to hold us accountable in bitterness and unforgiveness for our sins.  If you call yourself a Christian and live the life, then you also have been brutalized in one fashion or another, by so called well meaning self proclaimed Christians.  These are hurts that over time add up, forming a seed of unforgiveness and bitterness, that we either hide from or deny its existence.  Oh no, that’s not me, I know they didn’t mean it all those times and times again that they hurt me.  In that statement, you may be very correct, regarding their intent, but the Word of God is pure and sure;  Jer 17:9  The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked: who can know it? 
<br />I rather like that question, who can know it, we as good Christians are so prideful in areas of our lives, that even when God takes the time to show us, the hurtful and wicked ways of our heart, we deny that that is possible.  Just the other day,  had to come face to face with my heart and God at the same time, there was a hurt in me that got flared up, all because of pride.  Something was spoken that God wanted spoken that I would come to realization, there was a hurt in me that had not been properly handled.  I had pondered over the incidences that occurred, I believed with everything inside of me, I had examined myself and motives, even asked God to take the burden away, that bitterness would not enter in, leading to unforgiveness; but there it was, I drank of the gall from the previous action, but didn’t refuse the rest of the cup.
<br />     How easy is it for a real Christian to be deluded into thinking, they’re living their whole life in grace and faith by the Word of God.  How easy is it for a real Christian, to miss the mark, all because they hadn’t yet learned an important lesson, a lesson that would light a dark area of their life, thus setting them free.  Act 8:23  For I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness, and in the bond of iniquity.  It wasn’t any man or woman I know of that taught this lesson, it was the work of the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of God alone in His truth, that showed me on resurrection Sunday of all days also.  Psa 141:4  Incline not my heart to any evil thing, to practise wicked works with men that work iniquity: and let me not eat of their dainties. 
<br />Above all things, it is my fervent heart’s desire to please my Father in heaven, so I’ve learned, I cannot eat from another man’s tables, but must eat at the table my Father sets before me.  One of my favorite verse is;  Pro 3:5  Trust in the LORD with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. 
<br />If I don’t put my trust in God, then where can I turn and to whom do I turn, when I need direction?  As I said earlier, this lesson came from no man or woman, but straight up from God.  Where would I be, if I didn’t put my trust in Him alone to show me, teach me, and correct me in all areas of this walk with the Lord?
<br />     In one of my earlier teachings, I compared two verses in order to show any disobedience is blasphemy;  Mat 12:31  Wherefore I say unto you, All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men: but the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven unto men. 
<br />To blaspheme is not only the Greek definition, it also includes the old Hebraic definition as well.  One more time, God shed light in me, showed me truth of His Word, then set me free.
<br />What a wonderful God, what an awesome Spirit, what a liberating truth, what a loving Father, Who would take time with me, so the desires of my heart are fulfilled!
<br /><br />Praise God!

<br /><br />Isa 55:8  For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the LORD. 
<br />Amazingly enough, if you obey God’s ways and His Word, through the renewing of your mind, your thoughts and ways become as His.  Here is another place where you will experience a new form of persecution, persecution from those whom you walk with.  Those who will persecute you are not yet at a level of understanding, wisdom, and knowledge, that you have attained through your studies and personal intimate interaction, with the Lord.  How many times have we forgotten where we came from and where God has taken us to?  How many times in our forgetfulness, have we made the mistake of fault finding with a brother or sister in the Lord, not taking into consideration where they are verses where we are?  Isa 55:9  For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts. 
<br />Think back on every moment of your walk, did God find fault with you or hammer on you for what you said to Him, in your learning stage, your ignorance?  What right do we have to assume that even the brother or sister who gave their life to the Lord at the same time you did, is in the same place as you are?  Luk 7:47  Wherefore I say unto thee, Her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven, the same loveth little. 
<br />I do not know one person out there who knows someone so well, they are privy to all their sins and how much they have been forgiven by the Lord!  
<br />     Let’s get real, be real, and stay real, not one of us knows or understands the true power of love or the depth of forgiveness of that love in another’s life.  This being the case, none of us knows; how much hunger to love the Lord, is instilled in each person and where that love will take them in seeking His kingdom and seeking His heart.  How is it that we continue to find fault with what we do not understand.  What gives any of us the right to find fault or hammer on anyone, never knowing or understanding their levels of love for the Lord!  
<br />     Recently, one of my brothers in the Lord made a statement to me, I must be a good boy, because no one uses their pulpit to hammer on me, the way they do you.  This to me was a shocking statement, basically because I wasn’t aware that anyone knew what had been happening or who was being talked about.  I began wondering about this whole thing and without me even coming to the place where I would finally ask God about it, He spoke to me in the kindest and most loving voice I had ever known Him to.   
<br />     This is basically what He said to me; because you have been forgiven much, you have loved much.  You became so hungry for me that you studied deep, seeking to know me deeper than most, wanting to know all you could, because your heart is the heart I’m looking for.  The heart of a son who would choose to at any cost, want to please his Father.  Pro 25:2  It is the glory of God to conceal a thing: but the honour of kings is to search out a matter. 
<br />Pro 1:7  The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge: but fools despise wisdom and instruction. 
<br />It is knowledge of God that helps give understanding to His ways, His thoughts and helps promote obedience.  Rom 12:2  And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God. 
<br />This is something I give to you to share; few are where you are in your search for My ways and thoughts, never think less of them.  I made no two persons the same, they learn differently, they seek differently, they love differently, they do differently, and when they find fault with you, remember, their understanding, wisdom, and knowledge are not where yours is.  Rather than let it bother you, pray for them  and keep on loving them, as you have been doing, do no harm.  Preachers preach about finding fault with younger Christians, because they’re not where any mature Christian might be.  I say, find no fault with anyone as you might not be where they are in maturity and especially those who you might consider more mature than you.  They just may have the right thoughts and conceptual ways and you may not be there yet…
<br /><br />This is from me, Jeff Carr, to all in the body, it is my hope that this will resolve some of the backbiting and bickering that goes on in the body.  Think hard before you leap, remember Saul, as Paul, a very educated Pharisee of Pharisees, had to get knocked off his high horse.  Paul had to spend his time in the desert and be retrained to God’s ways and thoughts, even though he was well versed in scriptures.
<br /><br />This is from God to all the body:  I am about to knock a few Saul’s off their high horse to bring them back to humble standings.  Ask yourself, examine yourself, could you be one of those?

<br />        In your studies of God’s Word, did you ever know a time when a person, not Christ, stood out above the rest for what they did?  I have been troubled by the many teachings from behind the pulpit, but one disturbs me more than others.  It is the teaching that knowledge does not make for a relationship with the Lord.  I seriously beg to differ with this theology, how can you pray God’s Word if you do not have the knowledge of what His Word says?  How can a person renew their thought processes without the Word of God, His truth, seeking to know Him firmly in their spirit man.  
<br />     Who is this Mary;  Luk 7:36  And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him. And he went into the Pharisee's house, and sat down to meat. 
<br />Luk 7:37  And, behold, a woman in the city, which was a sinner, when she knew that Jesus sat at meat in the Pharisee's house, brought an alabaster box of ointment, 
<br />Luk 7:38  And stood at his feet behind him weeping, and began to wash his feet with tears, and did wipe them with the hairs of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment. 
<br />Luk 7:39  Now when the Pharisee which had bidden him saw it, he spake within himself, saying, This man, if he were a prophet, would have known who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth him: for she is a sinner. 
<br />Luk 7:40  And Jesus answering said unto him, Simon, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And he saith, Master, say on. 
<br />Luk 7:41  There was a certain creditor which had two debtors: the one owed five hundred pence, and the other fifty. 
<br />Luk 7:42  And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both. Tell me therefore, which of them will love him most? 
<br />Luk 7:43  Simon answered and said, I suppose that he, to whom he forgave most. And he said unto him, Thou hast rightly judged. 
<br />Luk 7:44  And he turned to the woman, and said unto Simon, Seest thou this woman? I entered into thine house, thou gavest me no water for my feet: but she hath washed my feet with tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head. 
<br />Luk 7:45  Thou gavest me no kiss: but this woman since the time I came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet. 
<br />Luk 7:46  My head with oil thou didst not anoint: but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment. 
<br />Luk 7:47  Wherefore I say unto thee, Her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven, the same loveth little. 
<br />Luk 7:48  And he said unto her, Thy sins are forgiven. 
<br /><br />This woman, Mary, lived wrongfully out of ignorance, but when she found the true love, the love of the Lord Jesus and His willingness to forgive her and her sins, she grew hungry to know.  The hunger or desire to know something, anything, is the root for seeking, for studying, for watching, for learning.  I, like Mary, have been forgiven much, I also wanted to know, how can this Jesus love me, where I was at and after all the horrible things I had done wrong.  Though the Torah was available in those days, few were allowed to read it and woman were second class citizens who were not to learn to read at all.  So how could she learn who this Jesus was;  by watching, studying His every movement that she was allowed to witness.  Just a simple note: Jesus loved Mary, but not in any carnal way as the history channel and a few other false reports or teachers would have you believe.  I am more fortunately blessed of God than Mary, in one aspect only, I get to read about Jesus in print and study all He said and did.  Mary on the other hand, had one thing we don’t, she had a face to face, in the flesh encounter with our savior.  Jesus made a very valuable statement though, Joh 20:29  Jesus saith unto him, Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed. 
<br />Again, we see scripture, The Living Word Himself, gives us an example to live by;  Joh 12:3  Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment. 
<br />She, Mary worshipped the Lord our God, with everything in her, including her purse.  Mat 26:7  There came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment, and poured it on his head, as he sat at meat. 
<br />Mat 26:9  For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor. 
<br /><br />Who is this Mary, this Mary is one of my scriptural heroes, she showed me, to go after the knowledge, wisdom, and understanding of the Lord, by any means and at any cost.  She, Mary, showed me it was better than OK, to give Him my all, to seek Him with my all, and to worship Him with my all.  The next time, someone uses their pulpit as a whipping post, trying to hammer their ideas and ideals into you, The Word of God will prove or disprove, the truth of their words.  
<br />     This is but one reason it is important to not only study God’s Word, but search a matter out, that you will have God’s approval as one of His true children!
<br /><br />Keep studying, keep seeking, keep worshipping, and keep digging, the treasure is there to be found.
<br /><br />God bless all of you

<br /><br />This man, who is he, he is a lazy fool; who is this man, he is the man who will not eat the bread of life, who will not taste and see that God is good.  Pretty harsh words coming from a Christian, surprise, surprise, surprise; they’re not my words, they’re God’s.  Pro 19:24  A slothful man hideth his hand in his bosom, and will not so much as bring it to his mouth again. 
<br />God said, actually commanded, we are to study His Word, without excuse or reservation unto complaint.  2Ti 2:15  Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth. 
<br />Some might say, that doesn’t sound like a loving God to me;  2Ti 2:15  Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth. 
<br />How many are deceived by false teachings, whose lives are destroyed, all because they would not lift a hand to help themselves or to feed themselves.  2Pe 2:20  For if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they are again entangled therein, and overcome, the latter end is worse with them than the beginning. 
<br />Let us back up to the first scripture;  Pro 19:24  A slothful man hideth his hand in his bosom, and will not so much as bring it to his mouth again.
<br />How can a man know Christ, the Living Word of God, without first putting His hand to the till so to speak.  How can a man begin to plow into the field and turn up the treasures God felt compelled to hide, but yet could be found, if he does not apply himself.  How can a man sow seed if he will not flip his wrist, to cast the seed?  How can man reap a good crop, if he first doesn’t take the time to inspect the seed, for we know, you reap what you sow.  How can a man have good bread if he doesn’t take the time to harvest and grind the meal?  How can a man bake his bread without sitting through some heat, sometimes through the fiery trials he’ll go through.  How can a man eat the bread if he won’t raise his hand to his mouth?  All these questions and statements, apply to the Word of God, how can a man ingest Christ the Living Word, without eating of His flesh?  Joh 6:51  I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world. 
<br />How can a man be the overcomer he is called to be, without proper food to help sustain his strength, and proper weapons for the warfare?  God made it plain;  Mat 10:22  And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake: but he that endureth to the end shall be saved. 
<br />Mat 24:13  But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved. 
<br />Mar 13:13  And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake: but he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved. 
<br />Mar 13:20  And except that the Lord had shortened those days, no flesh should be saved: but for the elect's sake, whom he hath chosen, he hath shortened the days. 
<br />According to scientists world-wide, due to the effects of the latest earthquakes, the earth has been shifted on its axis and the days are now shorter.
<br />How can a man believe, if he doesn’t know God’s Truth?  Mar 16:16  He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned. 
<br />They weren’t just talking about the flesh being, but rather the personage, which is the very character and nature of God in this statement.  Act 16:31  And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house. 
<br />     Just to simplify matters, I used the word man, but only as a representation of all mankind, please take no gender related offense here.  
<br />     I wonder how many will stand before the Lord come that fateful day of judgment before His throne, and be cast down in tears, all because they missed the point.  Mat 7:21  Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven. 
<br />How many, or rather how few, will there be in the day of battle, who will be called chosen and faithful, the overcomers.  
<br />Rev 17:14  These shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them: for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings: and they that are with him are called, and chosen, and faithful. 
<br />Now the question arises, hopefully, am I one who will make it, not deceiving myself or being deceived?
<br />   It is my sincere hope, this message will stir the hearts of all, and getting to know Jesus and the power of His name, will become a major priority in your life and hearts!
<br /><br />God bless you all as you dig for the treasure, God said was yours if you just apply yourself.

<br /><br />When do the ramblings of  a teaching become condemnation, when they are repeated over and over and over again , in a preaching or teaching.  Eph 6:16  Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked. 
<br />A couple of weeks ago, I fell prey to another attack by a preacher in our church, over something truly idiotic, while prayer was going on in the sanctuary, some of the congregation was getting a little loud in the kitchen area, I asked them to quiet down as it was disturbing the prayers.  At this point, the associate Pastor said they were creating a problem, that I was by speaking what I said, I immediately, though probably unwisely, spoke out against what he said, saying it was causing a disruptive and disrespectful problem.  At this point, I was informed that I was out of order and refusing to let God do a work in me.  Now I felt my flesh rise, though wanting to bite the head off this snake, I chose to walk away, I was angry, mostly with the fact that this person constantly comes against me and others bold enough to stand up for what is right.  As I removed myself from this situation, I began talking to God, in usual format by blaming myself.  God did not want to talk to me, as I was in an emotional state that might have presented itself in the flesh, when I would finally hear what God would say to me, regarding this situation.  Later that evening, the Lord showed me some things that would never the less effect my next response to this man.  God reminded me, this man has a habit of lying, to make himself look good in front of others, so, God gave me something to say.  Now the real problem started, unless God speaks through me, I get very hyper and screw up what I should have done or said and this time, I screwed it up real good.  The next time we met at the church, this person attempted to wrap his arms around me and hug me, I did not let this happen.  For whatever reason, I began to wonder, why did I act this way.  The next thing that happened, this Pastor said, believe it or not Jeff, I do love you, at which point I again responded poorly in my words, I did not say exactly what God said to say.  I turned to him and said, no you don’t love me because you don’t know how to love.
<br />     At this point, I need to interject some notes, that may or may not help explain some things.  God has called me to be a seer prophet, that’s a position that really makes me sort of nervous, based on two scriptures; Jer 17:9  The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked: who can know it? 
<br />And of course; Pro 3:5  Trust in the LORD with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. 
<br />I am also on the worship team, God is constantly giving me songs, but I discovered, when God stops providing songs  and chords for me, He at this point, wants me to study what He’s given me, very deeply.  This last song He has me working on, is all about the love of God and the fact we don’t walk in His love, because we don’t know or fully understand His love.  This next scripture is only for establishment of what and why He was telling me this.  Joh 5:42  But I know you, that ye have not the love of God in you. 
<br />Though I am not finished with this study, I found it more than interesting, because for the most part, we see Christ as being one of an ooey gooey lovey dovey nature, never giving consideration to the fact that He had a full knowledge of the heart of men.  We being called to be Christ-like in every manner, fail to take witness to the fact that, as He did what He heard or saw His Father, our Father do or say, we should also in like manner.
<br />     What God the Father told me, in my natural thinking, wasn’t very uplifting, nor was it very exhorting, but that is because I hadn’t studied that out as of yet, to its fullest potential.  EXHORT'ING, ppr. Inciting to good deeds by words or arguments; encouraging; counseling.
<br /><br />INCI'TING, ppr. Exciting to action; stirring up.
<br />In general, incite denotes to operate on the mind or will; excite has the same sense, but it extends also to the passions and to material substances; as, to excite action in the heart and arteries.
<br />Tit 2:15  These things speak, and exhort, and rebuke with all authority. Let no man despise thee. 
<br />We generally speaking are of a mind that God won’t slap us, to get our attention; Isa 55:8  For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the LORD. 
<br />What the Lord both showed me and told me; he, that particular Pastor does not have the love of God in Him, though there was much else He showed and said, I need not go any further, as it really isn’t anyone’s business beyond this point.  Now our Pastor, our Apostle, took the time to teach on love and faith and made an alter call regarding this, last Wednesday, but it didn’t end there, today it was carried further.
<br />     Last night, our church had a wonderful play on creation, in which bugs played certain parts that characterize different attributes of the unregenerated body of Christ.  They actors were awesome in their part portrayals, some of their parts were actually befitting their natural characters as well.  During this time, I found myself examining myself, as I felt God was showing me a problem within myself; Psa 139:23  Search me, God, and know my heart; test me and know my concerns. 
<br />Psa 139:24  See if there is any offensive way in me; lead me in the everlasting way. 
<br />There was something offensive in me and I confessed it to our Father and then ask Him to do what I cannot, remove it!  Today, the end of the message was exactly this and the alter call went out, only a few women responded and went forward, at this point is when the harping from the pulpit took place, and I could hear the fiery darts in bombarding effect.  Unrighteous thoughts of judgment were flying around the room and satan himself was telling me it was because I was unwilling to go forth and confess my sins.  Now this to me was amazing, as I had already confess my sin and faults the night before, yet  because I was in some of the eyes of men, unwilling to come forth now, I am of course; ( you can fill in the blanks from your own personal experiences ).  Now the Pastor seeing that certain parties were not coming forth proceeded to inform them they were all liars and so on, still harping, never considering the next verse.  Heb 11:1  Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. 
<br />It couldn’t be possible that God has already dealt with these individuals and they have been obedient to God, confessed their sins and ask God to deal with what they cannot change!
<br />So the next time, someone including satan tries to guilt you; let the Holy Scriptures, the Living Word of God, be your shield; Joh 5:24  Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life. 
<br />Rom 8:1  There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. 
<br />I did not do this before men, I did what I did, before my God, my Father
<br />1Co 11:34  And if any man hunger, let him eat at home; that ye come not together unto condemnation. And the rest will I set in order when I come. 
<br /><br />God bless each of you and let no man tear asunder, your marriage to God, to Jesus

<br /><br />Eph 6:10  Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might. 
<br />Eph 6:11  Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. 
<br />Eph 6:12  For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. 
<br />Eph 6:13  Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand. 
<br />Eph 6:14  Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness; 
<br />Eph 6:15  And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace; 
<br />Eph 6:16  Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked. 
<br />Eph 6:17  And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God: 
<br /><br />As of late, I have been hearing and seeing, things from the Lord that have begun to bother me, and bother me deep, to the point of tears.  God has been doing a healing in the body, but a healing that we have a tough time accepting and receiving, because He said it is concerning our secrets sins.  In other words, sins that we are not aware of, they exist deep in our souls, as a result of past hurts.  Generally, when God is showing something of this nature to His prophets and seers, He expects the prophets and seers to examine themselves or ask God to show them, the hurtful wicked things in them first.  I am no different from anyone else, God not a respecter of persons, expects the same from me as He would anyone, everyone else.  My sin, was throwing stones of truth on a situation, without standing in the authority given me, and when I was tired and worn, I did not cry out for help.  Though I was throwing stones of truth at the situation, the only thing I was doing was burying the problem, while giving the problem time to root, hidden under all the stones I had thrown at it.  2Ti 3:5  Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.  This, on my part is not always fun, to expose myself, before men, but scriptural; Jam 5:16  Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed. The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much.   How many of us really want to be that transparent for others to find fault and ridicule us for our failings, forgetting to examine ourselves?  After confessing to God, the faults He showed me, He healed me, I saw a whirlwind rise up around the stones I had thrown at this problem, removing the stones, removing the dirt, then finally removing the root of this wicked thing.  From this point, I knew it was my responsibility to walk in this healing and the POWER and AUTHORITY, Jesus extended to me, and this I do!  The visions, the things I was hearing didn’t stop though, God next revealed the vanity of our ways, we wear this vanity as our breast plate.  This vanity would be the faltered thinking and attitude of most of the bride.  Faltered attitude, there is nothing wrong with me, I don’t need to be healed, faltered thinking, this hurt is my protection, my defense mechanism, so no one can ever hurt me again.  In this state of mind and heart, we deny the power of God and His Word, electing to think we can do a better job of protecting ourselves than the unseen element, we call God.  2Ti 2:12  If we suffer, we shall also reign with him: if we deny him, he also will deny us: 
<br />The Word, Jesus the power and authority of the very character and nature of God is readying Himself to deny those who will not repent, receive, and walk in His whole suit of armor.
<br /><br />Eph 6:14  Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness; 
<br />How can you possibly have your loins girt with truth and have on His breastplate of righteousness, verses your breastplate of vanity, if you do not study His Word, if you do not renew your mind daily, if you’re not fully committed in total surrender, to His way alone.
<br /><br />Eph 6:15  And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace; 
<br />How can you possibly stand in the midst of the storm in His peace He gives to you, if you don’t have His full gospel in you, so  you know where and how to stand, when the time comes.  Remember; 2Ti 4:2  Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine.   Even if the one who needs to be reproved or rebuked is yourself!
<br /><br />Eph 6:16  Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked. 
<br />Amazingly enough, we are misled once again to believe that if we simply have a little belief, we have faith, wrong, wrong, wrong is our thinking.  Heb 11:1  Now Emunah is the substance of things for which we have tikvah. Emunah is the conviction of things not seen.
<br />Properly translated; Now faith is the substance of things for which we have hope, faith is the convinced mind of seeing as real, that which is not seen.  In other words, seeing that which has not yet produced as if it were already done, and in hand.  If you can’t see it as in your hand or in action, how then do you call it faith, for faith is not the after effect or done deal.
<br /><br />Eph 6:17  And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God: 
<br />The helmet of salvation is not something worn as man chooses to teach, from a one time act, it is a continual, day by day, moment by moment set of actions, established and affirmed, through every word that proceeds from God’s mouth.  The sword of the Spirit is the Spirit of truth, the very character and nature of God, in whom we should find our likeness and image.  Without God’s Word alive in us, how then can the flesh become Word, the reflection of Christ, the Word become flesh.  The Word is more powerful than we can imagine, accompanied with the measure of faith we were given and; Jam 4:7  Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you. 
<br />To have the living Word of God in you, alive, alive, alive is part of submission to God.  This is the way of speaking truth against the wiles of satan, putting his feeble attempts to constrain you unto his chains, to shame and nullified.  What better victory, what better taste of all that is good and pure and holy, what an amazing adventure to getting intimate with our betrothed.
<br /><br />A new Christian has almost their every request filled by God, because they are a new Christian, and God wants to show them His love and power, but as Paul said;  1Co 13:11  When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things. 
<br />It is time to put away our childish attitudes, grow up, and take serious our God and His Word, lest He, the Word of God deny you, and you find yourself on the outside looking in; Mat 8:12  But the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. 
<br />God will grant you the power and strength, to do ALL He asked you to do, 1Ti 2:4  Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth. 
<br />God is a good God and is worth more alive to us in our hearts and souls, than any man could imagine, now Psa 34:8  O taste and see that the LORD is good: blessed is the man that trusteth in him. 
<br /><br />This is the will of God for all, is this your will?

<br />     Have you not seen them weeping?  My chosen vessels, My Apostles, My Prophets, My Teachers, My Evangelists, My Pastors, My Vessels of honor, have you not seen the pain from love in their eyes, their tears?  Many have wondered why they feel such sadness and sorrow, accompanied by endless tears.  It is my sadness they feel and my tears they shed for those who claim My Son as their savior, but have no relationship with Him.  Did I not say in My Word, I would that all men would come to the saving knowledge and grace of Jesus.  
<br />     I have sent My Apostles and My Prophets to warn you again and again and again-----seek Me, seek first My kingdom and My righteousness above all.  Study, study, study, get to know Me, I have for so long wanted an intimate relationship with you.  Have I not sent my Pastors, My Teachers, and My Evangelists to tell you My Truth and My desires.  Did I not place in you the  desires of your heart and a hunger to know Me?  Yet, you continue to let your life in the world and your own understanding, rule you.
<br />     What if; you and the church stopped trying to control your life and the way the church moves, letting my Holy Spirit have total reign?
<br />     Have I not told you, even warned you to dig dig dig and find the treasures I have for you.  This I say, take heed if you do not dig for the treasure, for the treasure will be lost to you!  Did I not tell you to renew your minds, constantly and consistently?  You have let your life, your ways, take precedence over Me, leaving you dysfunctional and with a life out of order.
<br />Some of you who serve me, have not done all I have told you in My Word and our communion to do.  You have spoken clearly through your actions; your rejection of Me and My Word ----- I am about to reject you, and take your position from you.  I am about to rip your kingdom from you and give it to my chosen vessels.
<br />This is NOW, unless you repent NOW turn from your wicked ways, from your self rule!  I say again, repent, repent, repent, and stay focused on Me, give Me complete reign in your life, and watch the wonderful things I’ll do.
<br />I love you--- will you love Me, I gave My all, My best for you, now what will you give Me?
<br />A Word from the Lord, Dec 4
<br />     I have several things against you, but two will bring My wrath if you do not take care.
<br />     The first is jealousy, I hate jealousy, some in leadership have become jealous of those I placed with them.  I am the One who ordained them with great gifts, they are not here to take away from you or take your place.  I have placed them with you to grow you and the ministry that I gave you charge over.  I gave them their gifts to help you in the ministry and to enhance the ministry; because their heart is about My business and not their own.  Use them as I would use them, or I will remove you!
<br />     The second thing I have against you is your lack of compassion.  Compassion is My strong and shining facet of love, but here again, you have placed self above others; including Me.  Have I not told you in My Word to exalt others above yourself consider their safety and well being, first.
<br />     Jealousy is not love, lack of compassion is not love.  I have given you the Holy Spirit to rule over you that your footsteps are righteous in My sight.  One of the fruit of the Holy Spirit is self control, combine that with the power and authority I gave you, and rid yourself of the demon of jealousy.  Speak out My love flowing through you for all.  Without love, you have no part with Me, you have rejected Me.
<br />Now, the choice is yours, what will you do?

<br />     My prophets have been asking, why are they not listening?  To them who seek Me, I am revealing great truths and revelations; I will take care of My own.  Solomon wrote, Ecc 1:2  Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity of vanities; all is vanity.   Ecc 1:14  I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and, behold, all is vanity and vexation of spirit. 
<br />Their souls, their spirits are vexed, they see history constantly repeating itself, and with every repetitive measure, My creation gets farther from Me.  Where are you, this is the question I asked Adam in the garden and his response to me was I, I, I, showing the beginning of selfishness,  My creation has not taken on the fight, nor have they run the race, they have taken on the wrongful attitude that, I should do the work for them, I should make life easy for them.  My creation has failed itself and Me, their God, in believing that’s all my job and all they need do is sit back and collect the benefits.  Well, I have a question for My creation, where is your faith, your trust, your confidence, that I will meet the only needs you will ever have?  Where is your fight, your stamina?  David wrote; I will not offer to God, that which cost me nothing, he wasn’t talking about the sweat of his brow or the green god of his wallet, he was talking about the sacrifice from his heart.  Ponder on this, ask, I will show you what I mean by this!  Your prayers are vain prayers, saying oh great and mighty God, give me this and give me that, as if you truly need those selfish things.  You treat me as if I should hand things to you on a silver platter, this is what I hear you say; God is my sugar daddy!  You offer Me worthless things, Pastors who preach pre-made lessons, worship leaders who offer borrowed worship, teachers who offer topical lessons of who I am, without ever having a relationship with me.  I am sick of your half-hearted so called sacrifices from foreign alters.  
<br />     History repeats itself, and the moneychangers are still substituting half hearted offerings, while stealing from your offerings.  My prophets see this and wonder will they ever get it, and those who are truly in love with the Lamb, are crying out for you all, while truly covering themselves in the blood of them Lamb, making themselves exempt from spiritual death.  You who are called by My name, continue to look for signs and the signs I show you aren’t good enough for you to press in, but you use them to blame Me for failing you.  Therein lies the Adamic nature I should you, that Adam himself provided as example.  It’s the other persons fault God, now I’m telling you, because I love you and there is still hope if you will search for it, the blame lies squarely on your shoulders.  Do that which I have asked you to do, stop looking for the easy way out, run the race to win it, fight the good fight of faith and know, if I am for you, who will ever be able to stand against you and win.
<br />     If you have an ear to hear what the Spirit is saying, even though I use men and women of God, to speak to you, then there is hope, apply faith, confidence, and trust, in Me and there is victory.  Stop slacking at your post, for a sleeping watchman is a dead watchman.  A parent, who continually fights all the battles for their children, enables their children to continue in the wrong direction, I see that parent as a murderer.  A parent, who teaches their child right from wrong and how to fight for themselves, I see as a life giver, and I will be there for them.  Now, will you fight, do you possess the right tools, is your sword sharp, is your shield well polished reflecting My light while blinding the enemy.  Do you stand on solid rock peace, will truth hold you together in the heaviest battle, is your mind prepared for that which you will face?  My prophets have cried out to Me, now I’m crying out to you, will you hear Me?

<br /><br />This morning, I awoke to a revelation of worship, a revelation that showed me, even my growth in the Lord.  Eph 5:23  For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body.  The worship leader serves in the role of the husband while each voice or collective of voices, serves as his bride, none above another, yet all in balance and perfect working harmony.
<br />     When I first came to the Lord, I could not sing or play music with any other person, as it would throw me off what I was trying to do.  Why, because I had not yet learned the importance of working with others in harmony.  I had to stand out, pride still ruled in my life and I had to be number one, even God Himself hadn’t registered in my spirit as the King of kings and Lord of lords in my life.  This is something, mature Chrsitians should keep in mind, regarding new Christians, to give them mercy, remembering it’s the Holy Spirits job to clean the house or tabernacle of the new convert.  As the Holy Spirit begins to gain reign in the heart of a person, they begin to settle down and step back, little by little, piece by piece until God / Jesus through the Holy Spirit is truly number one in the person’s life.  No longer is it about blowing one’s own horn or establishing that person to be all that and a bag of chips, they have become pliable and humble.  This is not to say they remain pliable and humble, for God through His Word said; Phi 2:12  Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.  This is a must, otherwise we become smug, arrogant, and of no good use for the Lord, Psa 131:1  &lt;A Song of degrees of David.&gt; LORD, my heart is not haughty, nor mine eyes lofty: neither do I exercise myself in great matters, or in things too high for me. 
<br />Psa 131:2  Surely I have behaved and quieted myself, as a child that is weaned of his mother: my soul is even as a weaned child.  Pro 18:12  Before destruction the heart of man is haughty, and before honour is humility. 
<br />     Each instrument and each voice of worship is crucial in its application to the mix of voices and instruments, to the harmony of the music, to the whole worship of the heart.  Each voice and each instrument works together in harmony and unity, the same way as the members of a marriage are to be.  Christ being the head, the worship leader being the husband, the singers being the bride and the instruments being the children.  Volume wise, the worship leader would be above the rest, but at the same time, the harmony to the lead is equal in its volume, never above the voice of the worship leader, as the harmony is supporting in its role.  If you have ever listened to a well trained choir, there is a lead singer, there is / are harmonic singers, and there are accompaniment singers.  It is just as important for the collective volume of the accompaniment singers to be the same or slightly less than that of the lead singer.  Have you ever noticed that the harmonic singers are the same volume as the lead singer?  It’s due to the fact they serve as a supporting role of no less volume or value as the lead singer.  Gen 2:18  And the LORD God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him.  The word meet actually means the same as, equal support, not someone less than, not someone to abuse, not valueless in God’s eyes, God sees the bride as an equal representation of the husband, especially in the husbands absence.  Mat 19:5  And said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they twain shall be one flesh? 
<br />If the two are one flesh, then they stand on equal grounds and equal terms, if they are both walking correctly with the Lord!  So, harmony is the bride and harmony, whether one voice or many is equal in volume to that of the worship leader.  Why, because they are singing the same thing, whether words or meaning as the worship leader, but in different harmonic aspect, bringing in unity, harmony, peace, and pleasantry.  The instruments, they are like children and no child should be considered less important than another, and unless it’s a moment for one child to shine above the rest, all instruments should work together for the glory of God.  Each instrument, like a child should be considered equal in its role to the whole, balance is so key here in order for this to work correctly.  Rom 8:28  And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.  Now I realize this scripture may seem somewhat out of place in this context, but it is not in the bigger scheme of things.  Even instruments were called to honor God and those playing the instruments must fundamentally express their love of the lord through the talent they were given to honor Him.  If one instrument is louder than another, it drowns out the rest even to the point of depleting or denying key notes and sounds from other instruments to shine in the ability to honor God.  All things in worship must work together in perfect balance and harmony to accomplish perfect worship and if the worship leader, the worship team, and the instruments of worship are in perfect harmony, volume, and balance, then the body of worshipers will follow.  This in turn will bring in the glory of God, even to the point of the ministers inability to stand in His presence.
<br />     I said all this to show, we must work together in perfect harmony and balance, for if just one voice or one instruments maintains an exalted status in worship, then it’s out of order with God and is a strange fire before the Lord.  1Co 14:40  Let all things be done decently and in order.  Bring your offering to His house in proper order and standing and God bless your every effort to be harmonically balance in your worship.  Remember, whether growth is slow or desirously hungry for the Lord, we are all instruments of worship and until the heart of another is surrendered fully to the Lord, do not condemn them as they learn to walk a worshipful walk with the Lord.  Remember where you came from and how understanding and merciful the Lord has been with you as you became a worshiper from a humble heart!  We are all children of God who NEED to be raised up in His ways in order to perform His music.</strong>

<br /><br />If the Lord stood before you or you stood before Him and He asked you, what about you has changed, what would you answer Him?  Last night, that very thing happened to me, and I found myself somewhat dumbstruck by this question, except for a hope inside me that somehow, someway Jesus was and is the new creation in my life, I really had no HONEST answer that I could give.  2Co 5:17  Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.  I had no words that I could in all honesty speak to Him, just thoughts from His Word; Eph 4:24  And that ye put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness.  and; Col 3:10  And have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him:  I read and study His Word with an earnest desire to know Him more intimately, to renew my mind daily; Rom 12:2  And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.  I am constantly communing with Him, in prayer, in gratitude, in conversation, in worship, and in meditation; but is there really a change  in me, worth value enough to say, yes Lord, there is a change.  Jer 17:9  The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked: who can know it?  Still, there is a confident hope, that I have surrendered fully to Christ, so then how does one know they are not walking in the vanity of their own mind?  Pro 15:28  The heart of the righteous studieth to answer: but the mouth of the wicked poureth out evil things. 
<br />     Then it happened, the Lord answered me, and of all the ways I could respond, I found myself praising and thanking Him for what He said.  Before He answered me, he took me on a journey through my past, to show and build a confidence in me, that He the Lord is in charge in my life and that He is the Lord in my life.  
<br />     This is an account of what I saw and heard;  before coming to the Lord, before even knowing there was a God or savior, anger ruled my life.  My life before Christ, was fueled by the things that took place in my childhood that caused me to grow into the most angry of people.  With hatred as my backbone and anger as my confidence, there was nothing I could not do or get accomplished, and I was as Esau who built his own kingdom.  Mal 1:3  And I hated Esau, and laid his mountains and his heritage waste for the dragons of the wilderness. 
<br />When I finally answered the call of the drawing of the Holy Spirit and as I stepped out of God’s way, God would tear down my walls and parapets, brick by brick and stone by stone, until He was able to give me a heart of flesh.  Eze 11:19  And I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within you; and I will take the stony heart out of their flesh, and will give them an heart of flesh:   Eze 36:26  A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh.   All through the time of my walk, I have been faced with adversity that would cause the backbone of hatred and the confidence of my anger to rise.  This would once again build shields, walls, parapets  of self protection, but every time, the wall was a little lower and a lot weaker.  As each event took place and anger would rise in me, I would justify myself with the scripture; Eph 4:26  Be ye angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down upon your wrath: 
<br />Unless it is God’s justification what we wear is a robe of self righteousness, God gave me a word to walk by at the beginning of this year, as He has done for the past few years.  This year, the word He gave me was, “get real, be real, stay real”, and so I did to the best of my understanding.  What God has been able to do with me this year has been a miraculous marvel to me.  Recently, once again I was assaulted for asking a question, regarding a preaching someone had put out there.  This person responded to my question in the same fashion that I used to respond, anger and hatred.  I had challenged what they wrote and I apparently offended them, by not accepting their teaching, but in my questioning them, I was doing nothing more or less than the Word of God says to do; 2Ti 2:15  Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth. 
<br />At the end of the encounter with this person, I found myself praying, asking God to protect anyone that might be hurt or even killed in their faith, by this person’s anger.  I also found myself praying for this person soul, while speaking out against the unrighteous attitude that was displayed.  I actually felt a genuine love and concern for this person’s soul and compassion for anyone else this person might inflict the attitude on that this person tried to inflict on me.
<br />     The Lord said to me, I have succeeded in giving you a heart of flesh, filled with My love and My compassion for the things and ways of God.  When He spoke these words to me, I was humbled to the point where I saw His goodness and tasted of His fruit; Psa 34:8  O taste and see that the LORD is good: blessed is the man that trusteth in him.  God is good and it is my hope that all will surrender fully to the Lord, letting Him have His full Lordship over your life and your heart, for the path is narrow, but those who seek to please God verses man, will find the narrow path and walk on it without stumbling.  The Lord said, because I chose His will and His way over my life, I am forever blessed to be a blessing to others, because I was humbled to see what He has done, rather than being haughty and prideful, He and I are now one.  He has called me a king and given me His Sword of truth to wield in love.
<br />     I pray this will bless and encourage some, God never said this walk would be easy, but He has proven to me time and again, it’s forever worth it, God bless all of you!

<br /><br />Isn’t amazing how we take things for granted, all because we’ve become familiar with these same things.  For so long, we have taken God’s love for granted thinking because of improper translation, God’s love is unconditional.  I have heard and listened to many arguments regarding the New Testament being written completely in the Greek; but this is not a proper fact.  Though most of the studies and the theological dictations say so, they are actually generated by the Catholic church, that in fact, helped to promote this theology.  The truth of the matter is, most of the original disciples were simple men of simple means, from places where only Hebrew was spoken.  None of this matters though, as everything must be a reflection of the Old Testament and God’s love in the Old Testament is ahavah.  I will simplify this word and compare it to the Greek word, agape’.  The Greek word agape’ simply does mean; unconditional love, but in the Hebraic language, the word ahavah, refers to the love of God as a two-edged sword.  The one edge of His loving sword is extended to the enemies of God to protect His loved one while the other edge of His sword, commits spiritual surgery.  Lev 26:11  And I will set my tabernacle among you: and my soul shall not abhor you.  Lev 26:12  And I will walk among you, and will be your God, and ye shall be my people.  Lev 26:13  I am the LORD your God, which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, that ye should not be their bondmen; and I have broken the bands of your yoke, and made you go upright.  Lev 26:14  But if ye will not hearken unto me, and will not do all these commandments; Lev 26:15  And if ye shall despise my statutes, or if your soul abhor my judgments, so that ye will not do all my commandments, but that ye break my covenant: Lev 26:16  I also will do this unto you; I will even appoint over you terror, consumption, and the burning ague, that shall consume the eyes, and cause sorrow of heart: and ye shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it. Lev 26:17  And I will set my face against you, and ye shall be slain before your enemies: they that hate you shall reign over you; and ye shall flee when none pursueth you.  Lev 26:18  And if ye will not yet for all this hearken unto me, then I will punish you seven times more for your sins. Lev 26:19  And I will break the pride of your power; and I will make your heaven as iron, and your earth as brass: Lev 26:20  And your strength shall be spent in vain: for your land shall not yield her increase, neither shall the trees of the land yield their fruits.  Lev 26:21  And if ye walk contrary unto me, and will not hearken unto me; I will bring seven times more plagues upon you according to your sins.  Lev 26:22  I will also send wild beasts among you, which shall rob you of your children, and destroy your cattle, and make you few in number; and your high ways shall be desolate.  Lev 26:23  And if ye will not be reformed by me by these things, but will walk contrary unto me; Lev 26:24  Then will I also walk contrary unto you, and will punish you yet seven times for your sins. Lev 26:25  And I will bring a sword upon you, that shall avenge the quarrel of my covenant: and when ye are gathered together within your cities, I will send the pestilence among you; and ye shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy.  Lev 26:26  And when I have broken the staff of your bread, ten women shall bake your bread in one oven, and they shall deliver you your bread again by weight: and ye shall eat, and not be satisfied.  Lev 26:27  And if ye will not for all this hearken unto me, but walk contrary unto me; Lev 26:28  Then I will walk contrary unto you also in fury; and I, even I, will chastise you seven times for your sins. Lev 26:29  And ye shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your daughters shall ye eat.  Lev 26:30  And I will destroy your high places, and cut down your images, and cast your carcases upon the carcases of your idols, and my soul shall abhor you.  Lev 26:31  And I will make your cities waste, and bring your sanctuaries unto desolation, and I will not smell the savour of your sweet odours.  Lev 26:32  And I will bring the land into desolation: and your enemies which dwell therein shall be astonished at it.  Lev 26:33  And I will scatter you among the heathen, and will draw out a sword after you: and your land shall be desolate, and your cities waste.  Lev 26:34  Then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths, as long as it lieth desolate, and ye be in your enemies' land; even then shall the land rest, and enjoy her sabbaths.  Lev 26:35  As long as it lieth desolate it shall rest; because it did not rest in your sabbaths, when ye dwelt upon it. Lev 26:36  And upon them that are left alive of you I will send a faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies; and the sound of a shaken leaf shall chase them; and they shall flee, as fleeing from a sword; and they shall fall when none pursueth.  Lev 26:37  And they shall fall one upon another, as it were before a sword, when none pursueth: and ye shall have no power to stand before your enemies.  Lev 26:38  And ye shall perish among the heathen, and the land of your enemies shall eat you up.  Lev 26:39  And they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity in your enemies' lands; and also in the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away with them.  Lev 26:40  If they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers, with their trespass which they trespassed against me, and that also they have walked contrary unto me; Lev 26:41  And that I also have walked contrary unto them, and have brought them into the land of their enemies; if then their uncircumcised hearts be humbled, and they then accept of the punishment of their iniquity: This scripture shows that God is no one to be trifled with and that He sets conditions on His love.  Now keep in mind, I did not say that God’s love is like human love, where we fall in and out of love, without reasoning.  God’s love is undying, but it is not as we’ve been taught wrongfully through the generations; unconditional.  Rom 9:13  As it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated.  If we search out God’s reasoning, we find in the book of Malachi, Esau built his own kingdom, by doing things his own way, never looking to God for anything.  Esau also despised his birthright and sold it to Jacob to satisfy the desires of his flesh, God is the One who formed him in his mother’s womb.  Psa 139:14  I will praise thee; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made: marvellous are thy works; and that my soul knoweth right well.  Isa 44:2  Thus saith the LORD that made thee, and formed thee from the womb, which will help thee; Fear not, O Jacob, my servant; and thou, Jesurun, whom I have chosen.  Jer 1:5  Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee, and I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations.  Whether or not we were ordained to be prophets or any servant of the Lord, He nonetheless made us, formed us, each one of us in our mother’s womb.  He also established a truth, to many seem to think is an unwanted vegetable at a buffet spread; Luk 2:23  (As it is written in the law of the Lord, Every male that openeth the womb shall be called holy to the Lord<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/wink.gif" alt=":)" /> 1Pe 1:16  Because it is written, Be ye holy; for I am holy.  So now we look at the word agape’ again;  G26 agap? ag-ah'-pay From G25; love, that is, affection or benevolence; specifically (plural) a love feast: - (feast of) charity ([-ably]), dear, love. Thayer Definition: 1) brotherly love, affection, good will, love, benevolence 2) love feasts  This word shows no conditions whatsoever and lacks the proper definition of God’s requirements.  Having said this brief enlightenment, how about we set our eyes properly on God and live by His design, stop leaning to our own understanding.  Phi 3:15  Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded: and if in any thing ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you. 
<br />Mat 5:48  Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect. 
<br />The word perfect, as taught, does  incorporate being mature; but that’s but a small part of its total meaning.  The word perfect, actually is taken from the word, shlemim which means; complete ones, peace offerings, peaceable.  There is a way through obedience, this effect occurs, look at the star of David, there is a comprehension in its design that so few understand.  If you look on the star of David, you see two triangles, fully intertwined, the wholeness of the trinity of God intertwined with the wholeness of man.  This brings us to the next level of God accomplished in man, actually making man truly complete.  This word is in the Hebrew; echad which means: one, complex unity
<br />This is the place where the peace and joy and even the noticeable love of God becomes very pronounced in a person’s life.  It is my hope that you will not accept this teaching as just another teaching, but will in fact charge a hunger inside you, a stirring to study deep in God’s Word to become the king that God called each of us to be; Pro 25:2  It is the glory of God to conceal a thing: but the honour of kings is to search out a matter. 
<br />As you search, be blessed and thankfully prayerful, let us return to the title, it is from the marriage vows given at proper Christian marriages.  This is the reminder that God never meant for man and woman, husband and wife to be separated, but divorce rates being what they are, shows, we lack the desire to work things out and find out the truth of each other.  The only allowable separation in marriages is death, God’s mercy extends to that point.  Here is where man either faces the second death at the judgment seat, or glory into the kingdom of God in heaven at the white throne seat of judgment.  Until death do you part, how will you choose to live and whom will you choose to serve?

<br /><br />peeved
<br />? ?[peevd]  
<br />–adjective
<br />annoyed; irritated; vexed.
<br />Origin: 
<br />1905–10, Americanism ; peeve  + -ed2
<br /><br />—Related forms
<br />peev•ed•ly ?[pee-vid-lee, peevd-]   Show IPA, adverb
<br />peev•ed•ness, noun
<br /><br />Heb 11:6  But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him. 
<br /><br />Two of the greatest and most disappointing words found in the vernacular of today’s Christians is “I can’t“.  Time and time again, we hear the same thing in one form or another, constantly being repeated, “I can’t”, and God is tired of hearing this folly!  When God says you can through Christ who strengthens you, then why on earth do we deny His power.  Could this be a part of what God was referring to when He said;  2Ti 3:5  Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away. Never assume with God, but as the word from 2/6/11 went out, remember, seek God, seek His righteousness.  
<br />     Recently, our worship team entered into prayer, rather than practice one night and much came forth from God.  I had a vision of a boat or ship, the clipper style in its shape and this ship either could not or would not leave the dock, though scheduled to sail.  As the worship team approached the ship, we heard climb on board and as we did, our worship leader began to speak, then the rest of the team followed suit, myself included.  Oddly enough, I could not make out the words or context of what we were all saying, but we were all saying the same thing.  Suddenly as if we were all well informed as to what needed to happen next, each of us grabbed a rope that was hanging from the side of the ship and each of us, in one moving act, jumped over the side of the boat, clinging to these ropes.  In unity, we each began to walk forward on the water, still clinging to the ropes until we reach the end of our individual ropes and began pulling the boat or ship through the water while still walking on the water.  We were pulling the boat or ship forward to its unknown destination.
<br />     Now at this point my Pastor asked for the oil, by the way, I had not yet conveyed my vision to him.  Pastor said that God wanted us to receive a fresh new anointing for worship to sing and or play more skillfully and he anointed our hands, each of us.  This act stuck with me and as we began to play music the next night for service, I noticed my playing had somehow improved greatly.  I remembered what happened the night before and step in like I have never done before.  Friday,, the same thing occurred, but it is as if I had started where I had left off on Wednesday night and my playing seemed to be more anointed and better.  Almost immediately after we started playing and I noticed the increase, I was once again in remembrance of what took place, Tuesday evening.  Now during Tuesday, we were informed that we would be leaning an new song for an upcoming wedding; however, we didn’t have any music other than a CD, which was given to me to learn a guitar part from.  I did not get to play that CD until Monday morning at which time I informed the worship leader, there is no guitar part in this song.  I took the time to listen to the song and was able to pull the music and play y ear.  Last night at our worship practice, I attempted to teach others how to play the song and due to the amount of time being spent in trying to teach others how to play the keyboard portion of the song, the Worship leader said I was the one who needed to play it.  From those I tried to teach, I kept hearing “I can’t”.  Later that night, the Lord reminded me of the anointing He had placed on us to step into the greater things, that’s when He told me, He was irritated with the fact that most Christians today, do not walk in faith.  Jesus said;  Luk 18:8  I tell you that he will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless when the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth? 
<br />So now the question remains: what if I told you, you just peeved God, will you take the time to examine yourselves and start walking in faith?
<br /><br />It is my hope that you will not receive this from a hurt spirit, but will in fact, step into faith, God bless everyone of you!
<br /><br />By the way, I told Pastor about my vision after the prayer time and he said, it was about faith, the kind of strong faith that will help carry or encourage others.

<br /><br />In a word from the Rabbi, a letter sent out to those who wish to receive, I caught a different thought, yet still along the same lines.  Oil always rises to the top, stubbornly, yet definitely if uncontaminated, oil always rises to the top.  Now would be a perfect time to reflect on that portion of this message, oil always rises to the top if it is uncontaminated.  Heb 12:2  Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.  The hardest task of any human being isn’t relative to the physical in nature, in other words it would be easier for a pregnant woman, just hours before her labor, to lift a thousand pound weight, than to subdue the flesh.   The desires and lusts of the flesh lead only to death; Rom 8:13  For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live.  This means we must die to the lusts and desires of the flesh; Rom 13:14  But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof.   1Co 15:50  Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.  Here’s a scripture most people attempt to avoid and even go so far as to deny the true meaning of it.  We all know them, we all see them, and most are disgusted by their continued sinful nature; those that proclaim to be Christians but live like christain’ts.  These christain’ts are those who live for themselves, never truly investing in the life of others from the Water of the Word that washes and washes in love.  In otherwords, they would rather succumb to their desires than the desires of God, they would rather control things in their lives than to surrender to the perfect control of God.  2Co 7:1  Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God. We definitely need to beat the flesh down, but even more importantly, we need to walk in the spirit.  Gal 3:3  Are ye so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect by the flesh? 
<br />If we choose to live for self, then we are the contamination in the oil, and contaminated oil cannot rise and we are called to rise.  Rise to the top as overcomers, rise to the occasions as warriors, rise to call Christ called us to as sons of God.  Gal 5:16  This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh.   Gal 5:17  For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that ye cannot do the things that ye would.  Gal 5:24  And they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts.  Gal 5:25  If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.  Gal 6:8  For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting. 
<br />      It all comes down to one thing, if you really want to rise to the top, then you’ll put the things of the flesh down and way down.  A true Christian lives for Christ to be like Christ with an attitude of pleasing the Father, being about His business is more important than anything our vaporous lives can come up with.  Rom 8:14  For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.  Do you want to be known as a son of the living God or is it more preferable to be known as children of the father of lies.  Everyday of our lives we are faced with the same choice, choose life or choose death; Deu 30:19  I call heaven and earth to record this day against you, that I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing: therefore choose life, that both thou and thy seed may live:  Deu 30:20  That thou mayest love the LORD thy God, and that thou mayest obey his voice, and that thou mayest cleave unto him: for he is thy life, and the length of thy days: that thou mayest dwell in the land which the LORD sware unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give them.  Ladies and gentlemen, it all comes down to one thing, will you choose life, and learn about the life more abundant, or will you keep living for yourself and discover the depths of the curses God set in motion for those who will not surrender?
<br />     Some may think the only thing I teach is hard life, hell and damnation, but if you truly knew the God of the Holy Bible, then you would know, God is never going to change.  What God has said; He will hold to and it won’t matter all the good works you do, if it ain’t God’s way, then it’s the highway to hell.  We teach you truth because we love you!  Now rise to the top with the oil of the Holy Spirit and see what God will do for His faithful!

<br /><br />For generations, I have heard it taught, Peter was full of pride and he acted in the flesh from that pride.  What if there was more to the stories of Peter than we see or are willing to look at?  What if in Peter’s prideful arrogant fleshly state, there was more to the lessons from Peter’s actions than what we have ever considered?  Joh 13:6  Then cometh he to Simon Peter: and Peter saith unto him, Lord, dost thou wash my feet? 
<br />Joh 13:7  Jesus answered and said unto him, What I do thou knowest not now; but thou shalt know hereafter. 
<br />Joh 13:8  Peter saith unto him, Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus answered him, If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me. 
<br />Joh 13:9  Simon Peter saith unto him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head. 
<br />“Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head,” if led by God’s Spirit, we being the sons of God, go where He would have us to go, and go we shall in righteousness.  The hands represent the work, if we are led by God’s Spirit, then we being the sons of God, do the work He set forth for us to do.  The head, known as the place of authority, if we are led by the Spirit of God, then we, the sons of God, speak and pray what God would have us pray, but let us examine the head a little further though.  In the valley of Shechem, to the north was the mountain Gerizim, the mountain of blessing, to the south was the mountain Ebal, the mountain of cursing.  Shechem ran East and West between the two mountains, the name Shechem, literally means the place between the shoulders.  On a beast of burden, it is the point of contact for a yoke, a place where calluses form, but on a human, it is where the choices are made, in other words, the head.  What if Peter had it right, all through our lives, we have been bombarded with the filth of this world, some of that filth is the pain and hurts inflicted on us by adults we  encountered as a child and the nasty things they have said or threatened us with.  Some of that filth, comes from our peers, school age children who called us names or told us we were inept or  worthless in one fashion or another.  How about this, you were far from being the popular kid, the last one picked to play whatever games the local kids were playing.  How about those popular kids who with intent, decided to degrade you as a human being, because it made them feel better and even look more popular to the in crowd.  How much of that filth, how many of those childhood days hurts have we carried through life, some living in them even today while others built parapets in their minds and hearts against the hurts from their pasts.  
<br />PAR'APET, n. [L. pectus.] Literally, a wall or rampart to the breast or breast high; but in practice,a wall, rampart or elevation of earth for covering soldiers from an enemy's shot.
<br />There came a day in Israel’s history, where God asked Israel, why did you build parapets on the walls that I built around you?  How many of us truly, and I emphasize truly knew God well enough as a child, to not build our own parapets?  So ultimately, man without consideration and or knowledge of God, builds parapets or self preserving walls, in order to protect themselves from the mean onslaught of hurts, we all receive as children.  Some of us have learned to build those walls so well, that they become trash bins, where we can hide those hurts and also hide from those hurts.  I’m one of those, I hid my hurts so well, I didn’t even know I had them, I mean I hid them so well, that even examining myself, looking in every dark crevice I could find, I never saw them.  God saw them, let me say that again, God saw them, our Heavenly, loving Father sees every hurt, every pain, every affront and every assault we have ever experienced.  Now comes the part where we lose sight of God, though He never loses sight of us; how well do we know and have a fashion of understanding as to the true depth of God’s love?  Let me ask you this, how often are we willing to come as a little child, sit on our Heavenly Father’s lap and talk with Him and just love Him.  If you are to grown up to remember how to do that, then think about this; did you ever see a child get up in their father’s lap and ask him the dumbest questions.  Now as children, these questions are so dumb, but as adults in all our self righteous over education from experiential knowledge, these things seem ridiculous.  Daddy, why is the moon round, how come some cheeses have holes? When was the last time you had a good cry in your Father’s arms or maybe, when was the last time you honestly told God the truth about how you feel?  God is waiting for us to come as that little child, to ask Him those weird questions, to cry on His shoulder, to tell Him the truth about how we feel.  Why?  Did you know that God our Heavenly Father doesn’t think Himself so big that He doesn’t have time for each and every one of us?  He is waiting, He even invited you to put Him to the test, what kind of an earthly father is that good to us and willing to prove it?  
<br />     “Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head,” maybe Peter had it right.  Our head is not only the place where we make decisions, but it is also the place of all stored memory, good bad, indifferent, and even forgotten or buried and Jesus is waiting to do more than wash your feet.  Jesus wants to be our total healer for our sake, but also for God the Father’s sake!
<br />     Now!  Now, He awaits your decision and the truth be known, no man needs touch you for this healing to take effect, you just need to believe and receive.  When it happens, I would love to hear from you, I also want to thank God for your healing and give Him the praise He deserves.
<br />God bless you

<br />Part 2
<br /><br />God has spoken time and time again, we have a responsibility to know the truth, His truth, and yet when speaking to or reading from Christians, you can hear or see the lack of knowledge.  2Ti 2:15  Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth. 
<br />How many of us are hurting, physically, emotionally, or spiritually and these hurts seem to never end or get healed?  I’m not talking about hidden, we don’t know anything about these aches and pains, I’m talking about the fact we are fully aware of our dominate hurting condition.  Hos 4:6  My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: because thou hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou shalt be no priest to me: seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I will also forget thy children.  In the light of what is highlighted in this scripture, it would seem God is telling us we’re not doing our job of studying His law, His Word.  Oh how often we fail to honor our mother and father, all because we don’t understand the knowledge from scripture.  Honoring our mother and father, has more to do with our spiritual mothers and fathers than it does our natural parents.  These people, mothers and fathers in the Lord are your teachers, your Pastors, your spiritual leaders.  According to God’s Word, these same people are held more accountable for teaching the truth of God’s Word than we fully comprehend, but understand this; they are held more accountable because of the number of lives they affect.  On the other hand, we as individuals are held in the same accountability as these spiritual leaders for our security in working out our own salvation with fear and trembling.  When we honor our mother and father, we ultimately honor God, when we seek Him in all things, we show a form of worship that He seeks.  Num 15:39  And it shall be unto you for a fringe, that ye may look upon it, and remember all the commandments of the LORD, and do them; and that ye seek not after your own heart and your own eyes, after which ye use to go a whoring: 
<br />Num 15:40  That ye may remember, and do all my commandments, and be holy unto your God. 
<br />Deu 4:29  But if from thence thou shalt seek the LORD thy God, thou shalt find him, if thou seek him with all thy heart and with all thy soul. 
<br />1Ch 16:10  Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek the LORD. 
<br />1Ch 16:11  Seek the LORD and his strength, seek his face continually. 
<br />1Ch 22:19  Now set your heart and your soul to seek the LORD your God; arise therefore, and build ye the sanctuary of the LORD God, to bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and the holy vessels of God, into the house that is to be built to the name of the LORD. 
<br />1Ch 28:8  Now therefore in the sight of all Israel the congregation of the LORD, and in the audience of our God, keep and seek for all the commandments of the LORD your God: that ye may possess this good land, and leave it for an inheritance for your children after you for ever. 
<br />2Ch 7:14  If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land. 
<br />Psa 9:10  And they that know thy name will put their trust in thee: for thou, LORD, hast not forsaken them that seek thee. 
<br />Psa 14:2  The LORD looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there were any that did understand, and seek God. 
<br />Psa 22:26  The meek shall eat and be satisfied: they shall praise the LORD that seek him: your heart shall live for ever. 
<br />Psa 27:4  One thing have I desired of the LORD, that will I seek after; that I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the LORD, and to enquire in his temple. 
<br />Psa 27:8  When thou saidst, Seek ye my face; my heart said unto thee, Thy face, LORD, will I seek. 
<br />Mat 6:33  But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you. 
<br />Act 17:27  That they should seek the Lord, if haply they might feel after him, and find him, though he be not far from every one of us: 
<br />Heb 11:6  But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him. 
<br />These are but a very few scriptures that remind us not to seek our own; but seek after the one who can offer and will give each and everyone of us, a promised abundant life.  
<br />Joh 10:10  The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly. 
<br />     So now the ball is in your court, God requires you to study because His love is so strong for those who will and His love is so profoundly deep, He is waiting.  He really lovingly wants to heal His children, but if His children don’t seek Him, are they really His children and do they really want to be healed of ALL infirmities?  It is my hope that each of you want to be healed and made whole and it’s my prayer, you will do just exactly what God told you to do, that you maybe blessed mightily.
<br />God bless you, now taste of the Lord and see for yourself just how good and honorable to His Word He truly is!
