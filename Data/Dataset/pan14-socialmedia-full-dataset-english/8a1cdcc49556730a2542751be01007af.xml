<br /><br />Do I need a lawyer? I can buy an automobile or 100 shares of stock without a lawyer. Why not a one or two family home?
<br /><br />(An article by the New York State Bar Association)
<br /><br />Buying a home
<br /><br />Buying a home may not only be the most significant and largest purchase you will make, it also involves the law of real property, which is unique and has special problems. A lawyer is trained to deal with these problems and often has the most experience to deal with them. This applies to people selling a home or buying a home.
<br /><br />In the typical home purchase transaction the seller enters into a brokerage contract with a real estate agent, which is usually in writing. When the broker finds a potential buyer, negotiations are conducted through the broker, most often acting as an intermediary. Once an informal agreement is reached, buyer and seller enter into a formal written agreement. The buyer then obtains a commitment for financing. Title is searched to satisfy the lender and the buyer. And finally, the property is transferred from the seller to the buyer and the seller receives the purchase price bargained for in the contract. Seems simple and uncomplicated, but, without a lawyer, the consequences may be more disastrous than purchasing a car that turns out to be a lemon, or a stock investment that was unwise.
<br /><br />What are some of the reasons why you need a lawyer for a home purchase or sale? 
<br /><br />Dealing with the Broker. A seller without the advice of a lawyer, may sign a brokerage agreement that does not deal with a number of legal problems. The seller may become liable to pay a brokerage commission even if a sale does not occur or to pay more than one brokerage commission. For example, does the agreement offer the seller the right to negotiate on his or her own behalf; what is the effect of multiple listings; what are the broker's rights if the seller withdraws the property from the market, or can't deliver good marketable title; how long should an exclusive listing last? The seller should have the advice and guidance of an attorney with respect to a brokerage agreement. Even if the agreement is a so-called &quot;standard form&quot;, its terms should be explained to the seller and revised, if necessary. An attorney is also necessary to determine if the agreement was properly signed.
<br /><br />Dealing with tax consequences and other issues. Even though a lawyer may not be needed during the course of negotiations, the buyer and seller each may have to consult with a lawyer to answer important questions, such as the tax consequences of the purchase or sale. To a seller, the tax consequences may be of critical importance. For example, what are the income tax consequences of a sale, particularly if the seller has a large profit . . . will the seller be able to take advantage of the tax provisions allowing for exclusion of capital gains in certain circumstances?
<br /><br />Aside from the tax consequences, the buyer and seller may have questions about the date set for closing, the date of occupancy, the condition of the property, arranging for an inspection and what personal property is included in the sale. These are some of the many questions that may need to be considered during the negotiation stage in order to avoid disputes when a written contract is prepared.
<br /><br />Dealing with the contract of sale. The formal written contract for the sale and purchase of a home is the single most important piece of paper in the transaction. Its importance can not be overestimated. Although printed forms are useful, a lawyer is once again necessary to explain the form and make changes and additions for a particular transaction to reflect the understanding of the buyer and the seller. There are many issues that may need to be addressed in the written contract. For example, how should title be taken: individually, as tenants in common, joint tenants or tenants by the entirety. What happens if someone dies before title is transferred? The answers to these questions require the training and knowledge of a lawyer.
<br /><br />There are numerous other legal questions that must be addressed in the contract, including the following. If the property has been altered or there has been an addition to the property, was it done lawfully or may what is planned for the property by the buyer be done lawfully? What happens if a buyer has an engineer or architect inspect the property who finds termites, asbestos, radon or lead based paint? What if the property is proximate to a hazardous waste dump site? What are the legal consequences if the closing does not take place and what happens to the down payment? Will the down payment be held in escrow by a lawyer in accordance with appropriately worded escrow instructions? How is payment to be made? Is the closing appropriately conditioned upon the buyer obtaining financing? These are only a few of the many questions that arise with respect to a contract.
<br /><br />Arranging for financing. Most buyers finance a substantial portion of the purchase price for a one or two family home with a mortgage loan from a bank or other lending institution. The contract should contain a carefully worded provision that it is subject to the buyer's obtaining a commitment for financing. Printed contract forms are generally inadequate to incorporate the real understanding of the buyer and seller without changes being made. In addition, there is now an extensive and often confusing menu of mortgages that may be available. Fixed rate mortgages versus adjustable rate mortgages and the complexities of each require the knowledge of an attorney who is familiar with current mortgage lending practices. Mortgage loan commitments and mortgage loan documents are also complex. Lawyers are necessary to review and explain the importance of these various documents. Buyers should know when and if they can prepay their mortgages; what happens if they make a late payment; how is interest computed; how much insurance does the lender require; how are real estate tax payments computed and collected and the answers to a myriad of other questions that may arise. Moreover, when dealing with the lender, although there is little room for negotiation, there is a need for the general assistance of a lawyer at the very least to explain what is happening and its consequences.
<br /><br />Searching and insuring title. After the contract is signed it is necessary to establish the state of the seller's title to the property to the satisfaction of the buyer as spelled out in the contract. Generally, a title search is ordered from an acceptable abstract or title insurance company. However, in some areas of New York State, title insurance is not obtained. In such cases an attorney is essential to review the status of title and render an opinion of title in lieu of a title policy. Assuming you are in an area where title insurance is customary, who will review the title search and explain the title exceptions as to what is not insured? Is the legal description correct? Are there problems with adjoining owners or prior owners? What is the effect of easements and agreements or restrictions imposed by a prior owner? Can Ibuild a swimming pool or tennis court? Can I conduct a business in a spare room? Will there be any legal restrictions that will impair my ability to sell the property? Can the utility company build a high tension transmitter in the back yard? It should be clear that the guidance and advice of a lawyer can avoid a very costly mistake.
<br /><br />Checking out the zoning. The title search does not tell the buyer or seller anything about existing and prospective zoning. Does zoning prohibit a two family home? Does the deck you are planning violate zoning ordinances? There are invariably some questions that will require you to call upon a lawyer for the most direct and efficient response to your inquiry.
<br /><br />Reviewing the survey. Finally, there is the necessity of having a survey map of the property, which is a necessary adjunct to a title search. A lawyer is trained to review this survey, which may give rise to future problems. For example, your neighbors' fence or driveway may encroach upon your property or vice versa. A garage may have been built on a municipal street. Should you accept title? Will a lender give you a mortgage with these encroachments?
<br /><br />Conducting the closing. The closing is the event which is the &quot;moment of truth&quot; of the purchase and sale transaction. The deed and other closing papers must be prepared. Title passes from seller to buyer who pays the balance of the purchase price. Frequently, this balance is paid in part from the proceeds of a mortgage loan. A closing statement should be prepared prior to the closing indicating the debits and credits to buyer and seller. An attorney is helpful in explaining the nature and amount of closing costs. Final documents including the deed and mortgage instruments are signed. An attorney is necessary to assure that these documents are appropriately executed and explained to the various parties
<br /><br />The closing process can be confusing and complex to the buyer and seller. Those present at the closing often include the buyer and seller, their respective attorneys, the title closer (representative of the title company), attorney for lending institution and real estate broker. Documents need to be recorded; various transfer taxes need to be paid, and provisions for insurance and other incidents of ownership need to be concluded. There may also be last minute disputes about delivering possession and personal property or the adjustment of various costs, such as fuel and taxes. Here a lawyer's advice and guidance is essential.
<br /><br />Condominiums, cooperatives and HOAS. Special mention needs to be made about condominiums, cooperatives and homeowners associations. These involve forms of ownership that are treated as securities under New York State law and require special documents that are complicated and should be reviewed by an attorney. Condominium declarations, proprietary leases, and by-laws are but a few of the complex documents confronting buyers of these forms of property ownership. The tax deductions and consequences with respect to the purchase of a condominium or cooperative also need to be explained by a professional that is familiar with these common ownership forms.
<br /><br />It is obvious that throughout the process the interests of the buyer and seller will conflict. The broker generally serves the seller, and the lender is obtained by the buyer. The respective lawyers for buyer and seller will have no such conflicting loyalties and will serve only their clients' best interests.
<br /><br />A lawyer's advice and guidance is essential from the time you decide to sell or to buy a home until the actual closing.
<br /><br />THAT'S WHY YOU NEED A LAWYER.

<br /><br />Closing costs are those expenses associated with the purchase of a property other than the contract down-payment. Closing costs fall into two major categories: Bank Related Expenses and Title Related Expenses.
<br /><br />Bank Related Expenses: These expenses are those incurred in obtaining the mortgage to complete your purchase. They include:
<br /><br />Points: A point (equal to 1% of the amount of the mortgage) is a fee paid to either the lender or mortgage broker for the opportunity to obtain a mortgage loan from that lender. Points are 100% tax deductible when the mortgage is used to purchase a primary residence.
<br /><br />Mortgage Bank's Attorney: Unfortunately, the purchaser is customarily obligated to pay the lender attorney's fee, in addition to their own attorney's fee, as a condition of obtaining the mortgage. This fee ranges from $400.00 to $700.00 depending on the lender.
<br /><br />Tax Escrow: Most lenders will undertake to pay the real estate taxes on properties it grants mortgages against. In order to have sufficient monies to pay these taxes, a lender will require you to deposit 1/12th of the annual real estate tax bill in an escrow account with the lender, along with the monthly mortgage payment. In addition, you will be required to make an initial deposit, usually equal to 50% of the annual tax bill, in order to have sufficient funds set aside to make the first tax payment after closing of title.
<br /><br />Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI): If you put down less than 20% on your home purchase, many lenders will also charge you private mortgage insurance (PMI) premiums payable monthly. The coverage doesn't protect you; it protects the lender if you default on the loan.
<br /><br />Homeowners Insurance: A lender will also require that you maintain homeowners insurance in an amount necessary to replace the dwelling house. In addition, most lenders require that the first year's premium be paid in advance of the closing.
<br /><br />Misc. Fees: Lenders shall also assess various fees depending upon their internal procedures. Some of these fees include: tax service fees, document preparation fees, and application and credit fees. These fees vary depending on the particular lender.
<br /><br />Title Related Expenses:
<br /><br />These expenses are those required to complete the transfer of title and to record the necessary documents associated with the closing. They include:
<br /><br />Title Insurance: Required by all mortgage lenders, title insurance guarantees that you are obtaining good and marketable title from the seller. This one time expense, set by statute, varies according to the purchase price of the home and the amount of the mortgage.
<br /><br />Title Closer Gratuity: It is customary to give the title company's representative a gratuity for handling the closing. This fee ranges from $100.00 to $200.00 depending on the closer.
<br /><br />Departmental Searches: As part of the title search an abstract company will check the municipal records to ensure that the property is in compliance with the local ordinances affecting real property as well as the survey of the property. The fee for these reports varies depending on the municipality. In addition, if a new survey is required, you can anticipate an additional expense from $500.00 to $750.00 to have a new survey prepared by a licensed surveyor.
<br /><br />Mortgage Recording Tax (MRT): Anytime a mortgage is recorded in the State of New York, there is a one time fee assessed against you. In New York City, the fee is equal to 1.80% of the amount of the mortgage (under $500,000.), less $30.00. The fees in the outlying counties vary, depending upon the local regulations, with a minimum of .8% of the amount of the mortgage, less $30.00. This &quot;tax&quot; is not tax- deductible.
<br /><br />Recording fees: In addition to the MRT, you are obligated to pay a nominal fee to the County Clerk to record the original mortgage and deed. This one time expense is approximately $100.00 to $150.00, which varies according to county.
<br /><br />Mansion Tax: If you purchase a home with a purchase price of $1,000,000.00 or more, New York State imposes a transfer tax equal to 1% of the purchase price on you.
<br /><br />Another closing cost not outlined above is the purchaser attorney's fee. While attorney fees vary, a reasonable fee charged by a skilled real estate attorney is always a wise investment.

<br /><br />SELLER
<br /><br />In addition to any real estate broker commissions you may be responsible for, there are title expense associated with the sale of a property. These expenses are those required to complete the transfer of title and to record the necessary documents associated with the closing. They include:
<br /><br />Transfer Tax: Whenever property is transferred in New York State, the State transfer tax is due from you at the time the new deed is recorded. The State tax is $2.00 for every $500.00 of the selling price. If the property is in New York City, you must also pay NYC Real Property Transfer Tax (RPT). For most properties (sales less than $500,000.00), the RPT is 1% of the sale price.
<br /><br />Satisfaction of Mortgage(s): Don't forget that you may have a mortgage, home equity line of credit, or other liens to satisfy from the proceeds of your sale. Additionally, you are obligated to pay a nominal fee to the County Clerk to record the original Satisfaction of Mortgage. This one time expense is approximately $100.00 to $150.00, which varies according to county.
<br /><br />Title Closer Gratuity: It is customary to give the title company's representative a gratuity for handling the closing. This fee ranges from $100.00 to $200.00 depending on the closer.

<br />Condominiums
<br /><br />What is a Residential Home?
<br /><br />A residential home is considered a one to four family house and is the most common form of home ownership. The purchaser receives a deed to the home and the land that gives &quot;fee-simple&quot; ownership of real property. The purchaser is solely responsible for payment of all real estate taxes, insurance, utility and maintenance costs.
<br /><br />What is a Condominium?
<br /><br />Condos are found in almost all cities. The ownership of a condominium apartment is similar to the ownership of a residential home since you are purchasing real property and receive a deed to the unit. Since condos are generally found in apartment buildings, you own the interior space of your apartment outright along with an undivided portion of the building (known as the common areas or common elements) and have the right to use the common areas of the building such as the community facilities, laundry room, parking and hallways. There are generally few restrictions on your right to alter the interior of your apartment provided that it doesn't affect the building's structure or interfere with neighboring apartments. The condominium is governed by an elected Board of Managers whose powers are derived from a Declaration of Condominium and By-Laws. The condominium's Board of Managers makes financial decisions as to the amount of common charges needed to maintain the common areas of the building. A condominium unit owner may mortgage the unit, similar to a residential home mortgage and pay the real estate taxes on the unit. The condominium's Board of Managers usually does not have decision making powers as to the sale or sublet of the unit. Purchasers and subtenants of owners must submit an application to the condo's Board of Managers. The Board reviews the application and must either approve the applicant or exercise the condo's &quot;right of first refusal&quot; to match the purchase price or rent amount. Although uncommon, the option to purchase or rent the apartment from the current owner rather than have it transferred or rented to the applicant is available to the Board. Most condominiums' policies toward subletting are more lenient than are coops' policy which is why purchasing a condo is often a better choice for investors.
<br /><br />Monthly Expenses (also known as &quot;Carrying Charges&quot<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/wink.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />Carrying Charges are the costs associated with the upkeep and operation of a residential home, coop or condo apartment and are in addition to your monthly loan payment. Carrying Charges are called &quot;maintenance&quot; in a coop and &quot;common charges&quot; in a condo and typically cover a share of the costs of operating the building such as the cost of utilities for the common areas of the building, salaries for building employees, real estate taxes and property insurance. These costs are apportioned to each coop or condo unit owner by the apartment corporation or condominium association on a monthly basis. In the case of a coop, the monthly maintenance payments also cover local real estate taxes on the building and payments on the building's underlying mortgage. For residential home and condominium apartment owners, real estate taxes and homeowners insurance are an additional expense that should be factored into the calculation of the anticipated monthly expenses.

<br /><br />What is a Residential Home?
<br /><br />A residential home is considered a one to four family house and is the most common form of home ownership. The purchaser receives a deed to the home and the land that gives &quot;fee-simple&quot; ownership of real property. The purchaser is solely responsible for payment of all real estate taxes, insurance, utility and maintenance costs.
<br /><br />What is a Cooperative Apartment?
<br /><br />Coops are common in New York City but uncommon elsewhere. A cooperative corporation owns the building that includes the individual apartments and the common areas. The corporation issues shares of its stock (the Stock Certificate) allocated to each apartment based upon its size and location within the building. As a shareholder in a corporation, you are entitled to a lease from the corporation (the Proprietary Lease) giving you the right to live in the apartment. Most cooperative corporations have a mortgage on the entire building (the Underlying Mortgage) and each shareholder may obtain their own loan for the purchase of their apartment. The Stock Certificate and Proprietary Lease allocated to the apartment are pledged to the lender as security for the loan and a Uniform Commercial Code Financing Statement (UCC-1) is filed in the county where the apartment is located so that the lender has a lien on the Stock Certificate and Proprietary Lease. As a coopowner, you pay a monthly maintenance fee to the coop corporation which consists of your proportionate share of the cost of operating the building. Typically, operating costs for the building consist of property taxes, monthly payments on the Underlying Mortgage, insurance, utilities and labor costs. You are entitled to deduct a portion of your maintenance payment from your taxable income. Your right to alter the interior of your apartment will be proscribed by rules of the coop and may be subject to the consent of the Board of Directors. When you purchase or sell a coop, you must obtain the approval of the Board. The coop corporation is governed by an elected Board of Directors whose powers are derived from the certificate of incorporation, bylaws, rules and regulations and the Proprietary Lease. The cooperative's Board of Directors makes all decisions as to the maintenance paid by each shareholder, the upkeep of the building, the amount of the Underlying Mortgage, right of sublet, who will be approved for purchase, repairs and alterations of individual apartments and payment of all building expenses.
<br /><br />Monthly Expenses (also known as &quot;Carrying Charges&quot<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/wink.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />Carrying Charges are the costs associated with the upkeep and operation of a residential home, coop or condo apartment and are in addition to your monthly loan payment. Carrying Charges are called &quot;maintenance&quot; in a coop and &quot;common charges&quot; in a condo and typically cover a share of the costs of operating the building such as the cost of utilities for the common areas of the building, salaries for building employees, real estate taxes and property insurance. These costs are apportioned to each coop or condo unit owner by the apartment corporation or condominium association on a monthly basis. In the case of a coop, the monthly maintenance payments also cover local real estate taxes on the building and payments on the building's underlying mortgage. For residential home and condominium apartment owners, real estate taxes and homeowners insurance are an additional expense that should be factored into the calculation of the anticipated monthly expenses.
<br /><br />Maintenance Charges (Coops only)
<br /><br />Because monthly maintenance charges include a portion of the debt service on the building's underlying mortgage and the real estate taxes, a portion of the maintenance (usually around 50%) qualifies for an income tax deduction for the coop owner.

		<document id="ad2f59aab06bef00a610f39ce90bd700" url=""><![CDATA[Short Sale Negotiation<br/><br/>What is a Short Sale?
<br /><br />For owners who can no longer afford to keep mortgage payments current, there are alternatives to bankruptcy or foreclosure proceedings. One of those options is called a &quot;short sale. &quot;When lenders agree to do a short sale in real estate, it means the lender is accepting less than the total amount due. Not all lenders will accept short sales or discounted payoffs, especially if it would make more financial sense to foreclose. 
<br /><br />Short Sales: The Positives
<br /><br />While homeowner's are forbidden from receiving any proceeds from the sale of their home, there are other benefits to &quot;short sales&quot;.
<br /><br />1. A &quot;short sale&quot; is the lesser of two evils. Inevitably, if the homeowner cannot afford to remain in premises, the lender will repossess the property through foreclosure proceedings. A &quot;short sale&quot; can save the homeowner many months of stress, aggravation, embarrassment and uncertainty.
<br /><br />2. A foreclosure can be devastating upon the credit of a defaulting homeowner. With &quot;short sales&quot;, the homeowner's credit may be restored in as little as eighteen months. 
<br /><br />Short Sales: The Negatives
<br /><br />If you are considering a short sale, there could be drawbacks.
<br /><br />1. The Note may not be considered paid in full and may remain fully in force. A lender who accepts a short sale may legally pursue the homeowner for the difference between the amount owed and the amount paid. This amount is known as a deficiency.
<br /><br />2. Be aware the I.R.S. will consider debt forgiveness as income. Therefore the lender can file a 1099-C (&quot;Cancellation of Debt Form&quot<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/wink.gif" alt=":)" /> which may subject the homeowner to tax liability.
<br /><br />3. The lender may reserve the right to report this transaction to the appropriate credit bureaus which may negatively affect the homeowner's credit. 
<br /><br />Short Sales: What you can expect
<br /><br />Although all lenders have varying requirements and may demand that a borrower submit a wide array of documentation, the following steps will give you a pretty good idea of what to expect:
<br /><br />Hardship Letter: This statement of facts describeshow you got into this financial bind and makes a plea to the lender to accept less than full payment. Lenders are not inhumane and can understand if you lost your job, were hospitalized, etc.
<br /><br />Proof of Income and Assets: Lenders will want to know if you have savings accounts, money market accounts, stocks or bonds, negotiable instruments, cash or other real estate or anything of tangible value.
<br /><br />Copies of Bank Statements: If your bank statements reflect unaccountable deposits, large cash withdrawals or an unusual number of checks, it's probably a good idea to explain each of those line items to the lender. In addition, the lender might want you to account for each and every deposit so it can determine whether deposits will continue.
<br /><br />Comparative Market Analysis: Sometimes markets decline and property values fall. If this is part of the reason that you cannot sell your home for enough to pay off the lender, this fact should be substantiated for the lender through a comparative market analysis (CMA). Your real estate agent can prepare a CMA for you, which will show prices of similar homes.
<br /><br />Purchase Agreement &amp; Listing Agreement: When you reach an agreement to sell with a prospective purchaser, the lender will want a copy of the offer, along with a copy of your listing

<br /><br />What is a Short Sale?
<br />For homeowners who can no longer afford to keep mortgage payments current, there are alternatives to bankruptcy or foreclosure proceedings. One of those options is called a short sale. When lenders agree to a short sale in real estate, it means they are willing to release their lien against the home for less than the outstanding mortgage balance (including default interest and penalties, etc.). Not all lenders will accept short sales or discounted payoffs, especially if it would make more financial sense to foreclose.
<br /><br />As you may already be aware, this particular type of transaction requires an attorney with the patience and knowledge necessary to persevere in the continual, and sometimes frustrating, discussions with the lender.
<br /><br />At the Diamond Law Group, we have experience in negotiating short sales with numerous lending institutions. Our process is based on the wisdom gained in successfully closing countless short sale transactions thus rendering it efficient and reliable.
<br /><br />Lender's Incentive
<br /><br />The incentive for the lender is to avoid foreclosing on the premises as this process is both time-consuming and expensive. On average the foreclosure process takes a year to complete. Over this period the lender will have to retain an attorney to repossess the property. As you can imagine there are many legal hurdles to overcome which can cost the lender tens of thousands of dollars depending how on vigorously the homeowner defends themselves in court. If the bank agrees to a short sale, this expense can be avoided in its entirety.
<br /><br />Further, if the homeowner is not making their mortgage payment, nothing is being contributed into their escrow account. The escrow account is used to pay the homeowner's real estate taxes as well as their homeowner's insurance. Taxes and insurance must be kept current in order for the lender to protect its collateral. Therefore the bank is forced to carry the cost of the home from the time of default through the date of repossession or resale. The lender can save a substantial amount of money by agreeing to a short sale as opposed to foreclosing and carrying the expense of the home.
<br /><br />Frequently we are asked what the average percentage a lender will reduce the outstanding principal when considering a short sale offer. The answer is it does not matter whatsoever! It may initially seem counterintuitive; however, it is a reality.
<br /><br />When deciding whether to accept a short sale the lender will compare the current offer to the alternative: simply letting the home go to foreclosure. At a foreclosure auction potential bidders will take the &quot;fair market value&quot; into consideration; not the outstanding principal balance owed by the homeowner.
<br /><br />The short sale lender is aware of this fact and will apply the same principle to the offer that is presented. As long as the offer reflects the current appraised value the lender will ignore how much of a cut the deficiency is because that is what will happen at a foreclosure sale!
<br /><br />The Positives &amp; Negatives
<br /><br />It is important to understand that most short sale candidates have not done anything wrong. Typically a short sale homeowner purchased the property within the last three years and financed a high percentage of the purchase price and perhaps closing costs, if not all (i.e. 100% financing with a seller's concession). Since that time prices have dropped significantly in value which means that if the homeowner wanted to sell or refinance they would have make up the difference between the mortgage balance and the current decreased value, plus closing costs.
<br /><br />There is also the possibility that the homeowner may not have understood the terms of the mortgage or was fraudulently induced into predatory subprime loans.
<br /><br />Whatever the reason the homeowner is in the situation they are in, it is crucial to appreciate that foreclosure should be avoided at all costs and there is always an opportunity to rebuild both your finances and overall quality of life.
<br /><br />Privacy
<br /><br />A short sale is the lesser of two evils. Inevitably, if the homeowner cannot afford to remain in premises, the lender will repossess the property through foreclosure proceedings. A short sale can save the homeowner many months of stress, embarrassment, aggravation and uncertainty.
<br /><br />When considering whether to undertake a New York short sale, it is very important to make sure that the seller understands the benefits when compared to foreclosure.
<br /><br />One advantage to a short sale is that it is a private proceeding; unlike a foreclosure which is public in nature.
<br /><br />A financially distressed homeowner will receive literally 4 inches of mail on a daily basis from investors who are attempting to convince the homeowner that it is in their best interest to sell to them. Some of these solicitations are skillfully crafted to look like actual legal documents which may confuse and frustrate the homeowner. With a short sale this aggravation can all be avoided as the parties who are aware of the transaction are limited to those intimately involved.
<br /><br />This is not to mention the daily phone calls from the bank inquiring as to why the homeowner is missing their payments. Often the bank will attempt to reach the homeowner at work where they will initiate conversation with anyone who answers the phone, including the homeowner's coworkers or boss! Remember, they are attempting to collect hundreds of thousands of dollars and will use anything within their power to reach that goal.
<br /><br />In a short sale transaction this nuisance can all be avoided as the homeowner should instruct the lender to contact the attorney they have retained who is intimately involved in the transaction and familiar with all relevant facts. The lawyer in this scenario acts as a shelter or buffer between the persistent lender and distraught client.
<br /><br />Credit Implications/Bankruptcy
<br /><br />Obviously late payments can be devastating upon your credit score. By the time the foreclosure process ends a homeowner may have missed a year's worth of payments, if not more.
<br /><br />By successfully negotiating a short sale, homeowners can salvage as much of their credit score as possible. Yes it is true that the lender will reserve the right to report this transaction to the appropriate credit bureaus which may negatively affect the homeowner's credit. However, as previously stated, the blemish caused by a short sale pales in comparison to the destruction of a completed foreclosure.
<br /><br />Commonly clients are concerned about the timeframe necessary to rehabilitate their credit so as to qualify for a conventional mortgage in the future. The only reliable data we can gather has been based upon the information provided by our prior clients; credit may be restored in as little as eighteen months. The only guarantee is that however long the timeframe may be, it is certainly less than it would have been had the foreclosure action concluded. Contrary to what the lenders will tell you, the homeowner does not need to be in default in order to be considered for a short sale! The reason the bank will tell you this is because they want you to try to make as many payments as possible. We have closed many transactions where the homeowner never missed one payment. This is the best way to preserve as much of your credit score as possible.
<br /><br />Finally, with respect to bankruptcy, it has been our experience that some clients have declared bankruptcy as a last resort, unaware of an alternative. If you believe that bankruptcy is in your best interest, we strongly suggest completing our Short Sale Worksheet so that you can make an educated decision as to your best course of action.
<br /><br />Post-Closing Financial Obligation
<br /><br />Generally clients are concerned about the potential liability to repay the difference between the amount owed and the amount received by the lender as part of the short sale. This amount is known as a deficiency.
<br /><br />The most common result of a short sale for the homeowner is that the lender can file a 1099-C (&quot;Cancellation of Debt Form&quot<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/wink.gif" alt=":)" /> which may subject the homeowner to tax liability. The I.R.S. in turn will consider the debt forgiveness as income. However, recent legislation, known as the Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Relief Act of 2007, allows the homeowner to exclude the &quot;income&quot; if they qualify by filing Form 982 (&quot;Reduction of Tax Attributes Due to Discharge of Indebtedness&quot<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/wink.gif" alt=":)" /> (see referenced websites for more information).
<br /><br />Very rarely will the lender consider the Promissory Note to be in full force and effect after the closing. Because the outcome of the short sale is unknown when entering into a Contract with the purchaser, we reserve the right for the seller to cancel the transaction at any time. Therefore, in the unlikely event that the lender does pursue the deficiency, or &quot;go after&quot; other assets, the homeowner has the absolute right not to consent and rescind the Contract.
<br /><br />Timeframe
<br /><br />From the time a Contract is entered into to sell the home, the process should take no longer than 3 months. However, we have been known to negotiate short sales in as little as 2 to 3 weeks. All transactions are reviewed on a case-by-case basis so as to better advise the homeowner what can expected.
<br /><br />It is very important to understand that the only time a lender will stop foreclosure proceedings is after a successful short sale negotiation. In other words, the lender will continue their efforts to repossess the home despite the fact that a homeowner has listed the home for sale or entered into a contract to negotiate a short sale. Again, it is only after the transaction has closed that the lender will abandon the foreclosure action.
<br /><br />Proceeds
<br /><br />Homeowner's are forbidden from receiving any proceeds from the sale of their home. Keep in mind that as an incentive for the lender to accept less than what they are owed, they will mandate the defaulting homeowner not receive any money whatsoever, without exception.
<br /><br />The Mortgage
<br /><br />In addition to completing our Short Sale Worksheet, please review the following information for your particular lender(s):
<br /><br />?  American Home Mortgage Servicing, Inc. (AHMS)
<br /><br />?  America's Servicing Company (ASC)
<br /><br />?  Aurora Loan Services
<br /><br />?  Avelo Mortgage LLC
<br /><br />?  Bank of America (BoA)
<br /><br />?  Beneficial
<br /><br />?  Carrington Mortgage Services, LLC (CMS)
<br /><br />?  Chase Mortgage
<br /><br />?  CitiBank
<br /><br />?  Countrywide Financial
<br /><br />?  EMC Mortgage Corp.
<br /><br />?  Flagstar Bank
<br /><br />?  Fremont Investment
<br /><br />?  GMAC Mortgage LLC
<br /><br />?  Homecomings Financial LLC
<br /><br />?  HomEq Servicing
<br /><br />?  HSBC Mortgage Corp. (USA)
<br /><br />?  Indymac Federal Bank
<br /><br />?  Loan Litton Loan Servicing LP
<br /><br />?  MoreEquity
<br /><br />?  Nationstar Mortgage
<br /><br />?  OCWEN Financial Corp.
<br /><br />?  Option One Mortgage Corp.
<br /><br />?  Saxon Mortgage Services, Inc.
<br /><br />?  Select Portfolio Servicing, Inc. (SPS)
<br /><br />?  SunTrust Banks, Inc.
<br /><br />?  Wachovia
<br /><br />?  Washington Mutual (WAMU)
<br /><br />?  Wells Fargo Home Mortgage
<br /><br />?  Wilshire Credit Corporation
<br /><br />?  Wachovia/World Savings
<br /><br />When reviewing a short sale, the lender will consider the year of purchase or refinance, as well as the type of loan (fixed, ARM, etc.).
<br /><br />Contrary to what most lenders will advise, you do not need to be in default of your mortgage to qualify for a short sale. Banks will notify homeowners that they need to default on their mortgage for 2 or 3 months before they will be eligible for a short sale. This simply is not true. In fact, the best way to preserve your credit rating is to negotiate a short sale having never defaulted on a monthly payment.
<br /><br />However, most clients research short sales once foreclosure proceedings have been commenced and they have been served with a Lis Pendens. In general, until the auction date has been set, there is still time to negotiate a short sale.
<br /><br />Finally, it is vital that any outstanding judgments or tax arrears be brought to our attention as these costs must be reflected in the offer to the short sale lender. Often judgments or liens can be negotiated lower as well provided there is enough time to do so.
<br /><br />The Property
<br /><br />We have successfully negotiated shorts sales across New York and Long Island including Nassau county, Suffolk county, Brooklyn, and Queens.
<br /><br />Besides the location, another factor which must be addressed is the condition of the house. In particular, it must be determined if the plumbing, heating and air conditioning, electrical systems and appliances are in working order. If not, these items should be brought the prospective purchaser's attention immediately. This will ensure that their offer accurately reflects the premises &quot;as is&quot; and that an appraisal will be able to be conducted, if necessary.
<br /><br />Other concerns include termite infestation or damage and Certificate of Occupancy issues. If either of these issues exists, they must be brought to our attention immediately. It is possible for the lender to pay for these problems provided there is enough time to do so.
<br /><br />Finally, some short sales are for investment properties as opposed to principal residences. For instance your tenant defaulted on their rent which was in turn being used to subsidize the monthly mortgage payment. It is possible for short sales to be negotiated for investment properties; however, the lender is more likely to pursue a deficiency judgment because the circumstances surrounding the default are more of a business hardship instead of one personal in nature.
<br /><br />Keep in mind that even if the lender does pursue the deficiency there is room for negotiation (balance, rate, term, etc.) which is not the case with the alternative; foreclosure.
<br /><br />Short Sales: The Roles of the Parties
<br /><br />The Attorney
<br /><br />When should an attorney get involved and what is the fee? A qualified attorney should be involved in the transaction immediately! On a daily basis we receive numerous calls from potential clients who have spent a lot of time and energy attempting to negotiate with the bank directly only to become frustrated with the process.
<br /><br />There is no consultation fee whatsoever; we'd be more than happy to review your case in order to ensure you are headed in the right direction. Simply complete our Short Sale Worksheet and fax, mail or e-mail a copy to our office. Someone will respond back to your inquiry shortly thereafter.
<br /><br />Should our firm be retained, there is no transaction fee whatsoever; the lender will pay our entire fee! In no event, will this firm seek reimbursement from you should the lender reduce our legal fee less than what we feel is appropriate taking into consideration the time and effort expended.
<br /><br />The short sale process cannot begin until an executed Contract has been submitted to the lender. Contrary to what others might say, there must be an accepted offer which is then turned into a formal Contract along with a downpayment held in escrow. It is important to understand that the lender will continue to foreclose until the short sale closing takes place.
<br /><br />It is your attorney's job to draft and review the Contract to ensure that your rights are protected. The Contract should contain a contingency that if the terms of the short sale are unacceptable to the seller, the Contract can be canceled at any time for any reason.
<br /><br />There can only be one Contract executed at the same time. The Contract is a legally binding document which will contain a short sale contingency similar to the standard &quot;buyer financing contingency&quot;. That is to say, the Contract is &quot;subject to&quot; the short sale lender's consent. If they fail to do so, the transaction is rescinded and the downpayment is returned to the purchaser.
<br /><br />If you were to contact the lender directly, they will suggest the real estate agent gather as many offers as possible within 2 weeks and then submit all offers to them. This does not have to happen provided you submit an offer that represents today's &quot;fair market value&quot;. In fact, to date, we've never submitted multiple offers to the lender; only 1 which reflects a reasonable purchase price.
<br /><br />Obviously their incentive to suggest the real estate agent solicit multiple offers is to ensure they get the best offer possible; i.e. the highest offer. Typically, &quot;all cash&quot; offers are not as impressive as the bottom line proceeds they will receive at the end of the day. However, as previously stated, a realistic offer is all you need to proceed with a short sale.
<br /><br />Please recall who negotiates real estate in the rest of the country; real estate agents. Here in New York, attorneys are responsible for closing the transaction. Therefore, most members of the loss mitigation department are influenced to some degree by the fact that they are speaking with an attorney.
<br /><br />Lastly, the phone hold times to contact the short sale lender average around ten minutes. Further, the status of the short sale must be checked on a daily basis, otherwise the process will be delayed substantially. Remember that the loss mitigation departments are overworked and predictably can only work on the files that they receive calls on. That is why at the Diamond Law Group, we call every single lender every single day regarding approximately a dozen files each. This gives us a time effective approach towards resolving our clients' transaction in a timely fashion as well as increased bargaining power.
<br /><br />The Real Estate Agent
<br /><br />The real estate agent has a very important role in the short sale process. They are responsible for listing the home; however, they must do so in a particular way so as to inform all parties as to the nature of this transaction.
<br /><br />In other words, if prospective purchasers are not initially advised that the transaction is a short sale they may become unnecessarily frightened and shy away from making an offer. Alternatively, if the purchasers are educated as to what a short sale entails from the beginning all concerns may be properly addressed.
<br /><br />The real estate agent must also ensure that the potential purchaser is capable of securing a mortgage. Lending guidelines have become increasing stricter; without a qualified purchaser, the transaction will not go through.
<br /><br />Additionally, the role of the real estate agent is especially important when it comes to realistically listing the home. An overpriced home in a market with flooded inventory can be devastating in receiving timely offers. The short sale process cannot begin until an executed Contract has been submitted to the lender therefore time is of the essence for the qualified real estate agent to solicit a legitimate offer.
<br /><br />Most clients want to know what the average percentage a short sale lender will reduce the outstanding principal when considering a Short Sale offer. The answer is it does not matter whatsoever! It may initially seem counterintuitive; however, this is the reason why it is a reality.
<br /><br />When deciding whether to accept a short sale offer the lender will compare the offer to the alternative: simply letting the home go to foreclosure. At a foreclosure auction potential bidders will take the &quot;fair market value&quot; into consideration; not the outstanding principal balance owed by the homeowner.
<br /><br />The short sale lender is aware of this fact and will apply the same principle to the offer that is presented. As long as the offer reflects the current appraised value the lender will ignore how much of a cut the deficiency is because that is what will happen at a foreclosure sale!
<br /><br />The real estate agent will prepare a Comparative Market Analysis which will show prices of similar homes. This is necessary in order to substantiate offer which has been submitted to the foreclosing bank.
<br /><br />The lender will also send out their own independent appraiser to verify whether the submitted offer is reasonable. At this time the real estate agent should present the engineer's inspection along with written estimates for any repairs to the appraiser to further validate the offer.
<br /><br />Best of all, similar to attorney's fees, the lender will also pay for the entire real estate commission.
<br /><br />The Homeowner
<br /><br />Although all lenders have varying requirements and may demand that a borrower submit a wide array of documentation, the following steps will give the homeowner a pretty good idea of what to expect:
<br /><br />·Last Statement for All Loans: This is necessary so that we may verify the amount necessary to payoff the loan. If the homeowner has defaulted for an extended period of time the payoff must reflect all default interest, penalties, attorney's fees and escrow deficiencies.
<br /><br />·Hardship Letter: This statement of facts describes how you got into this financial bind and makes a plea to the lender to accept less than full payment. Lenders are not inhumane and can understand if you lost your job, were hospitalized, etc.
<br /><br />·Proof of Income and Assets:
<br /><br />·2 Weeks Paystubs: If you are unemployed, a simple letter explaining your circumstances will be sufficient.
<br /><br />·2 Months Bank Statements: Lenders will want to know if you have savings accounts, money market accounts, stocks or bonds, negotiable instruments, cash or other real estate or anything of tangible value. If your bank statements reflect unaccountable deposits, large cash withdrawals or an unusual number of checks, it's probably a good idea to explain each of those line items to the lender. In addition, the lender might want you to account for each and every deposit so it can determine whether deposits will continue.
<br /><br />·Last Year's Tax Returns: If you did not file taxes last year, a simple letter explaining your circumstances will be sufficient.
<br /><br />Unfortunately financial issues sometimes lead to marital issues. If the homeowner's are in the process of filing for divorce this fact must be disclosed immediately. We want to ensure all parties feel that their rights are being protected; therefore we would be more than happy to send a copy of all correspondences to each spouse's attorney for their review.
<br /><br />The Purchaser (Investors)
<br /><br />If you are considering purchasing a short sale, there are some inherent risks which must be taken into consideration. Our information is based on the experience gained in successfully closing countless short sale transactions thus rendering it efficient and reliable.
<br /><br />First, it is important to understand that the purchaser is &quot;subject to&quot; the lender's consent of the offer. Typically, the offer must reflect today's &quot;fair market value&quot;. Consequently &quot;all cash&quot; offers are not as impressive as the bottom line proceeds the foreclosing bank will receive at the end of the day.
<br /><br />Further, the vast majority of the time, the lender will not entertain a &quot;seller's concession&quot; where the purchaser inflates the purchase price in order to assist financing the closing costs. From the prospective of the short sale lender, who is losing tens of thousands of dollars, the purchaser is admitting that the property is worth more than they are paying for it (as the buyer's own lender must receive a satisfactory appraisal reflecting the purchase price plus seller's concession). Moreover your attorney must thoroughly review the Home Equity Theft Prevention Act to ensure that the transaction is insurable.
<br /><br />Additionally, the timeframe necessary to complete the transaction must be contemplated. For instance, the buyer must make a wise decision when deciding whether or not to lock the mortgage rate.
<br /><br />Also, it is your attorney's job to draft and review the Contract to ensure that your rights are protected. The Contract should contain a contingency that if the short sale is not successfully negotiated within a certain timeframe (usually 60 days) that the Contract can be cancelled by the purchaser at any time for any reason with the entire downpayment being returned to the purchaser.
<br /><br />Finally, there is no reason to put down a large downpayment for an indefinite amount of time. Your attorney should be able to negotiate a reasonable downpayment allowing you to retain your money where it can potentially earn interest.
<br /><br />If you or one of your clients is considering purchasing a short sale, please Contact Us without delay so that we may thoroughly review your transaction.

<br /><br />At the Diamond Law Group, we have experience in negotiating short sales with numerous lending institutions. If you are considering a short sale, please complete our Short Sale Worksheet without delay as earlier communications with the lender increase the likelihood of a successful negotiation.
<br /><br />As you may already be aware, this particular type of transaction requires an attorney with the patience and knowledge necessary to persevere in the continual, and sometimes frustrating, discussions with the lender.
<br /><br />On a weekly basis we give educational lectures thoroughly reviewing the short sale process. Afterwards you will have the tools necessary to speed up the transaction by avoiding common pitfalls as well as the knowledge to both motivate your clients and maximize your commissions.
<br /><br />Our information is based on the experience gained in successfully closing countless short sale transactions thus rendering it efficient and reliable.

<br /><br />When should an attorney get involved and what is the fee?
<br /><br />A qualified attorney should be involved in the transaction immediately! On a daily basis we receive numerous Sales Agreements from real estate agents who have spent a lot of time and money on their listing only to become frustrated when we inform them that the transaction cannot be negotiated!
<br /><br />Wouldn't it be nice to find out if the deal will go through before you even take a listing and spend your precious time and hard earned money?
<br /><br />Now you can, by referring the client to this firm. The reason you hear horror stories of Short Sales taking forever only to have your commission cut is because the real estate agent failed to qualify the transaction through an experienced attorney.
<br /><br />Do not end up like one of the daily agents we speak to who has wasted their time and money on a hopeless sale!
<br /><br />There is no consultation fee whatsoever; we'll speak to whomever you'd like in order to ensure you concentrate your effort towards worthy endeavors.
<br /><br />What will happen to the defaulting homeowner's credit and will they be responsible for the deficiency? How long does the process take?
<br /><br />The reason most real estate agents want to know the answer to these questions is so they can better advise their clients. You should not be answering these questions!
<br /><br />The questions above are best answered by an attorney who answers these questions on a daily basis! You do not want to make any representations whatsoever unless they're 100% accurate; the last thing you want is for your clients to mistakenly hold you accountable after the closing due to something they misunderstood.
<br /><br />At the Diamond Law Group we make your job as easy as possible by asking you do one thing: sell the home as close to the &quot;fair market value&quot; as possible. That's it. Do not answer any legal questions asked by your clients. Simply refer them to this firm and we will handle everything.
