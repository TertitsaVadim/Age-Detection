Be prepared for a challenge. There are many reasons hair may refuse to grow, but the result is common: frustration. Don't quit yet, however. Your hair actually isn't as stubborn as you may imagine.<br /><br />If you would like long hair, begin at the beginning. Our hair has a life cycle, and perhaps the most crucial part is that part that not one of us see. What happens in the hair follicle mostly determines the size, appearance, strength, and growth rate of the hair strand. Protein and vitamins are necessary to facilitate growth of new hair.<br /><br />If you cannot manage a good diet, think about hair vitamin supplements, but if you consume an excess amount of refined foods, you may still be damaging hair. You're likely already aware that virtually all processed foods have lots of artificial flavorings, preservatives, and other chemical ingredients. Much like vitamins and nutrients, these harmful elements are absorbed into your body and transported, via the bloodstream, to your scalp. Food preservatives will accumulate in your hair. Most of the chemicals that find their way in the hair can cause damage, which is why hair becomes brittle and dry.<br /><br />It's vital that you look after your nutritional needs above all. An unfit body simply cannot grow and maintain healthy hair. Excellent hair care can easily maintain healthy hair, but not make it. Taking supplements might be your next most reliable step in encouraging healthy growth of hair. Your body, and hair, will benefit by taking multivitamins even if your diet is already a healthful one. You will find many multivitamins created for hair growth. In addition, there are a number of herbal supplements like horsetail, saw palmetto, and gingko biloba that have shown promising results by increasing the speed of hair growth.<br /><br />While quickly growing healthy new hair is important, just as crucial is keeping your pre-existing hair healthy. No matter how well your hair is growing, it will not get longer if the hair strands are weakened. Brittle hair is often the result of styling. Whenever possible, reduce your use of the hair blower, curling iron, or flattening iron so your hair does not end up brittle. If you truly need to use these heat styling tools, choose one which has a low heat setting. Wearing a hat outside in summer or avoiding direct sunlight will protect hair from environmental heat, and UV rays. Say goodbye to the hair styling products that have harsh chemicals. Go with those that are described natural, hydrating, and gentle. Obviously, your hair will be much better off if you do not use any styling products at all.<br /><br />When washing your hair, do this carefully as too much abrasion will damage or break hair strands. When brushing or combing, begin at the tips to gradually loosen the tangles. Refrain from stretching your hair, because doing so will make the hair strands break easily. Trimming your hair often is also effective in making your hair grow long. When you frequently have your hair cut, you will not have split ends and your hair will certainly grow healthy and long.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hhaXJwcm9kdWN0czR1LmNvbS9ob3ctdG8tZ3Jvdy1oYWlyLWZhc3Rlcg__" target="_blank">how to grow your hair faster</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hhaXJwcm9kdWN0czR1LmNvbS9ob3ctdG8tZ3Jvdy1oYWlyLWZhc3Rlci9ob3ctdG8tbWFrZS1oYWlyLWdyb3ctZmFzdGVyLmh0bWw_" target="_blank">how to grow your hair faster</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hhaXJwcm9kdWN0czR1LmNvbS9ob3ctdG8tZ3Jvdy1oYWlyLWZhc3Rlci9tYXNzYWdlLXByb21vdGVzLWhhaXItdG8tZ3Jvdy5odG1s" target="_blank">how to grow your hair faster</a>
