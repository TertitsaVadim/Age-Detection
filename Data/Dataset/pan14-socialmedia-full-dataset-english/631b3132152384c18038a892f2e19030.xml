If I'm not on this thing for ages, it's because I'm either busy, forgot my password again {{ lol }}, or I just can't be bothered.  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/4210//smilies/laugh.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />My life is pretty much half-and-half. My &quot;issue&quot; with about my mates blanking me out is over, I'm more better, and before you mention like my last Blog, yes my admirer is dead. He died on the 3rd Feb. 08, and I will miss him dearly {{ Although I've never met him }} R.I.P. Babes  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/4210//smilies/cry.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />Also, I had a photo of my dog, Rusty. Yeah, she's gone too. Went last year in July. I'll never forget her, she was amazing. R.I.P. Hun, missing you still  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/4210//smilies/cry.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />My love life. Forget it. I just am in no mood for a relationship at the moment. I just can't trust any boy. A month ago, this boy I knew in my secondary school in my tutor told me lies. He said he really fancied me since he came back, and he wanted to go out with me. But he smokes, so I was unsure. After a few weeks, I was told by one of his mates {{ that guy is my mate too }} that he told him that he didn't say it. So I took the hint and realised it was all lies. So, I told my mates who I talked to about him, and a couple were pissed off. Especially my mate, Charlotte {{ A.K.A. Chaz }}. She flipped, and just started having a go at him. Then he said that he hated us both... And now since I posted this, two days ago, he started to talk to me again... What the heck??  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/4210//smilies/huh.gif" alt=":)" /> So now, I think we're OK as friends. But that has made a big scar inside me, so I'm guessing finding a good boy may be more difficult now  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/4210//smilies/dry.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />Oh well, I got all my mates anyway. Screw my family, cos right now I am just so sick of them! They think I cause arguments and also blame me for most things they complain about  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/4210//smilies/angry.gif" alt=":)" /> So yeah, stuff them! My mates are my family, that's good enough  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/4210//smilies/thumbs_up.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />That's it for now, won't post another Blog for a while, so yeah comment if you want - no bullshit on here though, cos love, I'm not in the mood.
<br /><br />Laters !  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/4210//smilies/love.gif" alt=":)" /> </strong>

From now on I'll be posting a blog whenever I have something to say. Well today was a bad day, but I hope things at school get better. So for now, I'll be off for a while...

Chavs were annoying my friend, saying that her hood rim (with 100% FAKE FUR) had REAL FUR, but she bloody doesn't. Otherwise, she would have had a rich house with a swimming pool, sauna and all that crap!! So, she got upset and then the Chavs again said &quot;Oh you're crying&quot; like it's a joke. So I tried to help her by telling them to shut up and what happens?? THEY LAUGH!! All I was trying to do was stick up fo my friend, and after that, I felt so stupid saying that... <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/4210//smilies/sad.gif" alt=":)" />

I don't see why everyone is against her! She's done nothing to them so why does she suffer?! She's OK now, but I hope she gets better soon. She's got mates around her that will keep her going...
