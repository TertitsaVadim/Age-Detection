<br /><br />Isnt it funny you can change your music taste to impress someone but when it comes to a person who likes thier own music and her own style, you give her a mouthful?
<br /><br />Isnt it funny that a guy can get away with being a gangsta but the emo gets a mouthful from everyone
<br /><br />are you laughing?
<br /><br />Isnt it funny an emo can be quiet all through the week but gets more shit from everyone than the girl who sleeps around and sells her virginity?
<br /><br />Isnt it funny that you dont mind your friends drinking, smoking but the minute someone mentions emo music you can give them a lecture on melodramatic teenage outcasts?
<br /><br />im not laughing
<br /><br />Its so funny that you and your friends can make a persons life hell and not know anything about the silent battle they might be fighting.
<br /><br />Isnt it funny that you can call emos, punks, goths the retards but still manage to get through your day without an inch of guilt in your heart.
<br /><br />HOW YOU CAN CALL SOMEONE A POSER, HOW CAN YOU SAY &quot;YOUR NOT EMO&quot; OR &quot;ATTENTION SEEKER&quot; WITHOUT SPENDING A SECOND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHY THERE ARE CUTS ON HER WRISTS AND WHY THEY SPENDS THEIR LUNCHTIMES CRYING INSTEAD OR LAUGHING WITH THEIR FRIENDS
<br /><br />keep on laughing
<br /><br />Isnt it funny you can say and do all this without any idea of what is going on in this persons life
<br />without knowing her situation with her friends
<br />or their family
<br />or their LIFE
<br /><br />BRAVE ISNT GOING UP ON STAGE AND STRIPPING
<br />BRAVE IS NOT SAYING A SPEECH
<br /><br />BRAVE IS
<br />GOING TO SCHOOL ON MUFTI DAY AND NOT FOR A SECOND CARE WHAT THE IDIOTS AROUND YOU ARE SAYING ABOUT YOUR CLOTHES
<br />ITS LISTENING TO YOUR OWN MUSIC AND BEING PROUD OF IT
<br />ITS GOING THROUGH EVERY DAY WITH THE THINGS PEOPLE SAY TO YOUR FACE AND BEHIND YOUR BACK AND YOU STILL KEEP QUIET
<br />ITS KNOWING WHAT YOUR &quot;FRIENDS&quot; ARE SAYING ABOUT YOU AND STILL CALLING THEM YOUR FRIENDS
<br />BRAVE IS KNOWING THAT TOMOROW ISNT A BRIGHT AND HAPPY FUTURE
<br />ITS ANOTHER DAY OF BITCHING AND DODGING RUMORS
<br /><br />keep on laughing
<br /><br />if you agree put this on your blog
<br />and advise others to do so

I will always miss him, bu i know he would not like it if i went mad in grief, lost myself in a world where all i thought of was pain and death. But life goes on, people die all the time, no matter how much it hurts people do have to move on, live their lives knowing that the dead have never really gone, they are always there right beside you, in your heart guiding you, helping you and with that im happy, it gives me reason to stay happy, whilst sad confusing YES!!!! Well life does move on especially for me, this is a blog of my life from May 2007, to 1st Feb 2008. From May things went wrong and went down hill dramatically, and i almost lost myself in madness despite my friends being there, nothing could help the truth of knowing i was loosing a great influence/role model,june passed, still exams went on, but i didnt care no point doing exams without my uncle there, exams completed in june, YAY no more school NO thatwasn't what i was thinking, i was thinking how many friends would i loose, even more did i go under. July wow, longer summer holiday, wooo NOT, i was spending every wasking day wondering howmuch longer my uncle would stay in the world, 13th July mum called &quot;uncle tom died&quot; me and sis both knew this was what we were waiting for, in a way i knew he was in a better place then ever before, in a place of no-more pain, with his family, but i felt angry, how could this happen, how could my uncle be taken from me why it's not fair, i became selfish in the thought that it was wrong for him to go, but i stayed strong, i mean i had to mum lost her uncle (yes he's my great uncle, but that's rude to say) and sis did as well, i needed to be strong for them, i needed to make sure they were alright. From then on we spent a lot of time with family all of us joint together by grief, me staying with my Uncle helping him and my aunt look after my cousin, sis and mum staying with nan, helping her with the loss of her brother. 24th July, &quot;Nanny Kay has died&quot; (cousin's nan) my uncle said &quot;we had to think of the best way to tell you, and your mum said we should tell you&quot; i was sad still but still needed to be strong people can't see me sad, it's not good, i have to be strong for everyone else. 25th July, funeral for my uncle, the sadest day i've had in a long time, so many people came to say good by one last time, so many people my uncle influenced, still i didn't cry i had o be strong for my cousin's they lost a nan, i was looking after my little cousin so my aunt could be there for my uncle, ui regret not going not saying goodbye, not crying, not really grieving ignoring emotions, but i had to be strong still. Week later another funeral, this one i did attend, fighting tears i helped my family, helped my cousin's on a terrible day. Still i didn't cry i still had to be strong. August came all of us spent time with each other know one really on their own, mewith my uncle to help him and andaunt again, mum and sis with nan, helping her with the loss of a great friend, and a brother. Still no crying i cant im not allowed i need to be strong always being strong. Result day at school, YAY i have my grades the first thing i did before showing them to anyone &quot;Uncle tom these grades are for you, i did this for you&quot; then showed them, family were proud i was proud, but not of my grades, of the fact i kept a promise to my uncle a secret promise that i promised when i first found out he was dying. Spent next few weeks deciding sixth form or college, in the end i choose college new start, new friends putting my old life behind me, making a new start. First day made friends i was happy i fitted in i wasn't rejected, but i was still upset my uncle still wasn't here how can i lve if he wasn't but i had to stay strong everyone was still grieving.told one of my friends my life, well parts of it, and he gave me advice, and i realised i dont need to be strong all the time, that time i realised i was never truley happy veven tho i pretended to look on the good side of death, i spent that whole night crying, knowing he was never coming back, never there anymore, never ever i cried and cried till i cried no more. I was told to relax by my friend, i needed to relax calm down get rid of my built up anger, te anger i created for myself, anger i never said good bye, but things needed to change, i spent that night relaxing, things got worse, as a little girl many things i didn't like i put away and hid i didn't like them never wanted to be reminded, but that night i relaxed and some came back, things i never remember, making some of my fears understood, but those mempries sent me back, i couldn't live with myself i hated life altogether i hated everything, i was a mess, but no-one knew i put on a smile as usual, hid from my emptions, still the memories effect me but ignoring them i will always be doing, December one of the best things happnedto me since May, my longest known friend finaly asked me out, we were together at last, he made me make promises and i have, and now we have entered Febuary, i was very ill lst few months, epilepsy was out of control i was seriously ill, but i had adhd therefore people called me attention seeking, i ignored this i couldnt go back to taking notice of bullies so i ingored it. Things got better, alhough ill again this time with pharyngitis i will not let it stop me, for many years now i have had so many bad memories, so many good memories, all having a major impact on my life, making me go under. But that changes today, i am 17 in 7 days, and from then on i will not be like i was, i will always be brave and strong for the one's i love, but i will grieve in my own time, I am making another new start this time being the Nicolé i should always be, the nicolé i always wanted to be, i have many new friends, a good family, and a wonderfuly boyfriend, my life has imporved and so i must too! My life has had some really good times, but then mostly bad times, things happen, people change but know this i will never forget the people who have influenced my life, the people who have shaped me into the person i am today!
