Instituting an art-based curriculum in a time when most colleges are getting math and studying intensive to ramp up state check scores can be a markedly distinctive method. But it is a single that the majority educators in Philadelphia Schools approve of. <br /><br />The concern of how you can reach and connect with students from your city's lower socio-economic and minority base has puzzled administrators because community schooling began.
