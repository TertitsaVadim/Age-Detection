<br /> and at the same time cause so many things.
<br /><br />The ending of friendships, starting of new ones.
<br /> The way you feel to a special person, or just a feeling you will have forever 
<br /> toward some those you care about the most. 
<br /><br />But what does it really mean? 
<br /><br />It usually means how you feel about someone....
<br /> when you feel a certain way that you  must express it somehow
<br /> but it has to be expressed more than just a shy or friendly smile
<br /><br />and you can't just say it randomly say it either, it has to come from the heart. 
<br /><br />The unfortunate thing about that is that sometimes or most times (varing on  the person) when someone has that feeling, they try to express it or think  about what their going to in order to get their attention... just basically away 
<br />to show a specific person how they feel.. 
<br /><br />Now you must be thinking why I had said unfortunate (probably not but you  know what ...chicken anywayss)  well it's the aftermath or even the process to show someone how you feel. Looking from everyone's point of view it's different but to tell the truth its all too confusing for ANYONE... because there always is that hope or loss of hope that what you want to happen won't or will
<br /><br />But what happens when someone says it and it doesn't mean anything...
<br />Like you say it.. but there's no feeling to it.. do you return the favor even if its  fake?... Or do you reject it knowing..and or hating that someone was trying to  play with your heart.... But then there is the case where it is true....
<br /><br />and there are ways to tell the difference.....
<br /><br />To some it maybe very easy.... and to some it maybe very hard... but when  you get down to it... it is clear to everyone... 
<br /><br />Firstly if this person has said this to you... and you have a strong profound  bond... and i don't only mean relationship wise... this could be friendship.. like  from one best friend to another...  then this is something you should think  about ..... and obviously reply back... unless you don't feel the same...  
<br /><br />but if you don't reply back... to someone who really was pouring their feelings  to their heart's content.... would you feel guilty... 
<br /> would you have even bother to found out...  and if you did would you care?
<br /><br />Sometimes.. it's best not to care... but those times are rare.....

Some will be your friends. Some will bring fun and joy. Some will cause trouble. Some will be parasites. And some will be closer to you than the people you care about the most.
<br /><br />Food for thought:
<br />- They say that a 'friend in need is a friend indeed'.
<br />When you are in trouble, your true friend will sprint to your help quickly 
<br />without any ulterior motive.
<br />- When you are socialising, never take kindness for granted. You must know how
<br />to give your friends 'treats' even if they are the richest people on earth!
<br />You have the right to let them know that you treasure friendship. This is an act 
<br />of friendship, not ego boosting.
<br />- Many good friends are broken due to small misunderstandings. Give your friend the benefit of the doubt.
<br /><br />Clear any misunderstandings quickly. Good friends are hard to come by. It is your privilege to overlook your friends' faults.
<br /><br />- Remember your friend's birthdays. Be the first to call them in the morning to send your heartiest good wishes.
<br /><br />- Take holidays together if you have the opportunity. Treasure good times together. Life is too fragile. You do not know who will die first... 
<br /></strong></em>
<br /><br /><strong><em>Have friends
<br />True friends
<br />And fire
<br />Each other
<br />To be better and better
<br />Happier and happier
<br />Treasuring the limited time
<br />On earth...</em></strong>

<br />every time i write something for you
<br />or about you
<br />i feel it isn't enough

<br />but thus in the real world 
<br /><br />i cant for there are always consequences to every extent  
<br />of what you do 
<br /><br />if you just send me a sign to keep me updated when your a way
<br />i'll try to check up on them as much as i can ok
