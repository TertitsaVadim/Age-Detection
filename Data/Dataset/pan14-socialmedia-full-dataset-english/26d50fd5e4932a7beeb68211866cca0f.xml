<br />2. No matter what YOU say, your ex-boyfriend IS a LOSER. 
<br />3. We like you to give us hugs andkisses sometimes too. 
<br />4. Don't argue with us when we call you beautiful. 
<br />5. Don't treat us like crap, what goes around comes around. 
<br />6. We know you're pretty, that's one of the reason's we're going out 
<br />with you. 
<br />7. Don't go into detail about your period. It scares us. 
<br />8. If you have cramps and we ask you what's wrong,just tellus it's that time 
<br />of the month and nothing more. 
<br />9. If you really liked us for us, you would let us think that our 
<br />mustache,beard,or sideburns looked cool. 
<br />10. We never shave our legs. So get over it. 
<br />11. NEVER ask us if you can put makeup on us. It's just wrong............ 
<br />12. Don't make bets about us, because one of your friends will tell us, 
<br />if you don't. 
<br />13. When we tell you that you're not fat, believe us. 
<br />14. We absolutely do not care about the BackstreetBoys,*NSYNC, 98 Degrees,or 
<br />what any other guy looks like for that matter. 
<br />15. We may not be able to pee accurately all of the time,but at least 
<br />we can stand up and go pee. 
<br />16. Just cause you think you're always right, doesn't mean that you 
<br />don't have to apologize when you do something &quot;wrong.&quot; 
<br />17. You expect us to say and do sweet things for you,but it would 
<br />be nice if you did the same every once in a while. We like to know that you 
<br />love us. 
<br />18. We can't always be spontaneous, so try to help us make the plans 
<br />sometimes. 
<br />19. Don't ask us to beat up another guy for you, cause you might get 
<br />what you wish for. 
<br />20.Never kick us in the nuts &quot;just to see what we would say&quot;. That's just 
<br />mean. 
<br />21. Never pretend like you are going to break up withus andlaugh when we 
<br />believe you. 
<br />22. Pamela Anderson's boobs aren't fake anymore, but we like yours better 
<br />anyway. 
<br />23. Size doesn't matter, except to idiots who don't want a relationship. 
<br />24. PMS is not an excuse. 
<br />25. If you want us to put the seat down when we're done, you should put 
<br />it up when you're done. 
<br />26............ Don't tell us how cute yourex-boyfriend was. That doesn't 
<br />turn us on. 
<br />27. And always remember: The way to a guys heart is through his 
<br />stomach.....and maybe....oh nevermind. 
<br />28. NEVER ask us to kiss other guys. You might be thatcomfywith your 
<br />friends, but to us it's just wrong. 
<br />29. We always notice how funny it is after your ripout ourheart, stick it 
<br />down our throat and still want to be friends. 
<br />30. And last but not least: We know you're not alwaysright,but

<br /><br />&gt;Only in Australia ... can a pizza get to your house faster than an ambulance. 
<br /><br />&gt;Only in Australia ... do supermarkets make sick people walk al the  way to the back of the shop to get their prescriptions while healthy  people can buy cigarettes at the front. 
<br /><br />Only in Australia ... do people order double cheeseburgers, large Fries and a DIET coke. 
<br /><br />&gt; Only in Australia ... do banks leave both doors open and chain  the  pens to the counters. 
<br /><br />&gt; Only in Australia ... do we leave cars worth thousands of dollars on  the drive and lock our junk and cheap lawn mower in the garage. 
<br /><br />Only in Australia ... do we use answering machines to screen calls  and then have call waiting so we won't miss a call from someone we didn't want to talk to in the first place. 
<br /><br />Only in Australia ... are there disabled parking places in front of a skating rink. 
<br /><br />NOT TO MENTION... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
<br />3 Aussies die each year testing if a 9v battery works on their tongue. 
<br /><br />142 Aussies were injured in 1999 by not removing all pins from new shirts. 
<br /><br />58 Aussies are injured each year by using sharp knives instead  of screwdrivers. 
<br /><br />3 1 Aussies have died since 1996 by watering their Christmas tree While the fairy lights were plugged in. 
<br /><br />8 Aussies had serious burns in 2000 trying on a new jumper with a lit cigarette in their mouth. 
<br /><br />A massive 543 Aussies were admitted to Emergency in the last two Years after opening bottles of beer with their teeth. 
<br /><br />and finally......... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

<br />They where the fastest, strongest and the most disciplined fighters the world had ever seen.
<br />They ran with the wolves and hunted with them
<br />This made them at one with the wolf there is legend of one of them who soul was in tune with 2 wolves one black and one white.
<br />The black wolf was the anger of the pack and the white was the happiness of it.
<br />Both of wolves had followed the samurai to the top of Mt Fuji and as he sat down to meditate the wolves took there chance to merge with his soul.
<br />then they made him a guardian of the wolf blade that held all the power of soul and the hart and he had to prove himself by fighting the temptation to take the blade and rule over all and to this day you can still hear him howling whit the wolves in soul if you care to listen.
<br />And he will wait until a new wolf comes to take his place and so he may rest.
