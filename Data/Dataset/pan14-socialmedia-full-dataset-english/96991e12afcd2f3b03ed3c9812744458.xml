<br />Back in May we saw the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5hb2wtc2hvZXMubmV0L2xpYmVydHkteC1uaWtlLWFpci1tYXgtOTAtd2hpdGUtcHVycGxlLWZsb3JhbC13b21lbnMtb24tc2FsZS1wLTI0NTcuaHRtbA__" target="_blank">Liberty X Nike Air Max 90 Purple</a> “Sail”, and while today’s version sports the same textile design, the colorway is definitely not so soft. In fact, a dark imperial purple works the shoe’s upper, and is broken up with touches of white on the Nike swoosh, toe, ankle, inner lining, and tongue. Finishing off the look is a classic white midsole, which houses a <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5hb2wtc2hvZXMubmV0Lw__" target="_blank">Nike Air Max Shoes</a> unit at the heel, and a black outsole. The collaboration between Liberty of London and Nike Sportswear continues to expand with a new design on the Nike Air Max 90. Made for the ladies, the new design in based in a red suede over the majority of the upper. The usual flowery Liberty print is set beneath the suede and is mixed with sail to bring out the details. Currently there is no official release date for this model, but stay close and we will let you know as soon as the nes hits our inbox. Liberty of London’s latest collection for Nike continues hitting stores this week, at least overseas. Swedish retailer SneakersNStuff.com is now stocking the Liberty x <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5hb2wtc2hvZXMubmV0L25pa2UtYWlyLW1heC1uaWtlLWFpci1tYXgtOTAtYy0yXzUuaHRtbA__" target="_blank">Nike Air Max 90 Shoes</a> Sport Red/Sail, which sets red suede overlays against red-and-white floral printed inlays, which is further contrasted by white on the midsole and Swoosh. Having examined the Nike Air Max 90 portion of the 2012 Nike Sportswear x Liberty collection, we shift our focus to the always popular Air Max 90 silhouette. Similar to the FREE 5.0, the shoe carries a textile upper finished with the distinctive Lagos Laurel print in imperial purple. Other features include suede front overlay, off-white midsole and rubber gum outsole, plus white laces and leather Swoosh. A tan leather logo patch at the tongue finishes the look. Heritage and style collide in the latest Nike Sportswear summer footwear collection with Liberty. One of Nike’s most coveted collaborations, it will celebrate the legacy and evolution of the brand’s running innovations over four remarkable decades of style. Styles include the Cortez, Free 5.0 and Air Max 90.

<br />After debuting in a variety of OG-leaning, ‘dipped’ and otherwise totally new colorways last summer, the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5hb2wtc2hvZXMubmV0L25pa2UtYWlyLW1heC05MC1oeXBlcmZ1c2UtcHJlbWl1bS1zdWVkZS12b2x0LXdob2xlc2FsZS1wLTI2NzEuaHRtbA__" target="_blank">Air Max 90 Hyperfuse Suede Volt</a> went AWOL right around the time CrookedTongues gave out their sick ‘Infrared’ F&amp;Fs. Then about ten days ago, we got our first look at a few new pairs whose colors were more or less combined to create the Olympic Flag-styled Quickstrike pair soon to be joined by AM95BBs and AM2012s. And that’s not the only AM90 HYP set to hit retail with some friendly assistance, as the four ‘Suede Pack’ pairs will soon unleash their unique combo construction on the world in red, neon, blue or black. Along with the black/cool grey version we showed you a few weeks back, Nike’s new suede pack of Premium Hyperfuse <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5hb2wtc2hvZXMubmV0Lw__" target="_blank">Nike Air Max Shoes</a> also consists of this volt/yellow-grey colourway which has started making its way to select Nike retailers. Today, this retro-runner appears in its latest form dubbed the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5hb2wtc2hvZXMubmV0L25pa2UtYWlyLW1heC1uaWtlLWFpci1tYXgtOTAtYy0yXzUuaHRtbA__" target="_blank">Nike Air Max 90 Shoes</a> Hyperfuse Premium Suede. This new rendition utilizes both suede and hyperfuse composite throughout the upper and can be found in eye catching base tones of Soar, Gym Red, Volt, and Black. Decked out in a Hyperfuse upper of white and Volt with grey accents on the overlays, the kicks see a grey suede mudguard alongside white lining, a white rubber outsole and addition Volt hits on the midsole, Max Air unit and laces. Volt turns up the sound on this loud pair of Nike Air Max 90 Hyperfuses. The shoe takes on the vintage Air Max look, but is complemented with a suede and Hyperfuse composite.

<br />Be true to your team in the Nike Dunk High (NFL New England Patriots) iD Shoe. A <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5hc2stc2hvZXMuY29tLw__" target="_blank">Nike Dunks</a> exclusive, this classic includes the official team logo and is customizable with authentic team colors. Pair it with your team jersey for a bold head-to-toe look in the stands or wherever you choose to represent. The French denim concern’s last three sneaker collaborations have been teamups with Vans, but longtime Sneaker News readers will also remember that A.P.C. has teamed up with Nike Sportswear on multiple occasions.  Jean Touitou’s universally respected label had focused its attention solely on the All Court lowtop in previous efforts, but these new drops instead switch to two slightly more modern classics.  The A.P.C. x <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5hc2stc2hvZXMuY29tL25pa2UtZHVuay1oaWdo" target="_blank">Nike Dunk High</a> will release in two ‘dipped’ and one more (off-)white monochromatic style, all with dark gum soles and accompanied by an Air Max 1 in dark blues. The phrase ‘J-Pack’ has been tossed around a bit more liberally in recent years, but even with wacky colors the meaning remains the same: we’re talking about the OG Air Jordan 1 blocking pattern.  The AJ1s share their sole with 1985?s other smash hit Swooshed basketballer, and while they’ve crossed paths over in the SB division, this is the first time Nike Sportswear will take a crack at combining ’85?s most influential hightops.  The Nike Dunk High will release later this year in red/black and royal/black styles borrowed from the Air Jordan 1, though the addition of a snake-textured suede Swoosh sets these apart from all previous ‘J-Pack’ efforts.  Have a closer look after the jump, let us know how these compare to the SBs and OG AJ1s as well as the other FW12 Dunks.

<br />If you've been a fan of the custom sneaker colorways being worn by Team USA in Barcelona this week, you'll be happy to know that three of the styles are currently being offered through NIKEiD. LeBron James' Hyperdunk+, Kobe Bryant's Zoom Kobe VII and Kevin Durant's Zoom KD IV each feature clean white uppers, obsidian details and red laces. The Hyperdunk+ features additional hits of red on the exposed Flywire threading along the side panel. When <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5hc2stc2hvZXMuY29tLw__" target="_blank">Nike Kobe Shoes</a> Kobe Bryant took the floor this morning for Team USA's on-going prep work on the road to London, he was noticeably aggressive and focused. Even though he's the elder statesman of the team, he's clearly not ready yet to pass the torch to the league's next generation of stars. It immediately reminded me of the dynamic that made Monte Carlo practices so legendary and competitive for Magic Johnson and Michael Jordan. &quot;The 80's are over,&quot; Jordan would often remind him. &quot;It's the 90's now.&quot; Behind 24 points and 10 rebounds from Kevin Durant (in just 22 minutes), the US squad took care of business in their first exhbition outing with a 54-point win over the Dominican Republic. Yes, they won by 54 points. Things were competitive when the DR took a 4-2 lead early on, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5hc2stc2hvZXMuY29tL25pa2Uta29iZS1zaG9lcw__" target="_blank">2012 Nike Kobe 7 Shoes</a> and then the game was entirely out of hand the rest of the way. The popular Zoom Kobe VII has been getting tons of love both on and off the court so far in 2012, and will likely continue to do so with this combination of grey, blue and hot pink bringing them to life. Cool grey is seen taking care of the upper on these, while white contrasts on the Swoosh and outsole. Thunder blue handles the laces and liner, while fireberry completes the look on the tongue liner and external heel counter. The Kobe VII FC Barcelona Pack features two different colorways modeled after past Barca team kits. Both feature the FC Barcelona crest on the inside of the tongue.

<br />A few new colorways of the Nike Air Solstice Premium have just been revealed today, getting ready for it’s massive return this month.  Though not as sporty as it’s suede and mesh counterpart, the Premium version keeps the retro flair while rocking a smooth leather and suede upper. Available <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5hc2stc2hvZXMuY29tLw__" target="_blank">Nike Basketball Shoes</a> in both Black and Grey, each one features a perforated toe box Swoosh, with Orange used for the lining and ankle collar. The Nike Air Solstice is making it’s return this year, coming in this fresh Blue, Grey and White colorway. Built from a mix of leather, suede and mesh, the low top trainer has a strong retro vibe with traditional Orange Nike branding on the heel. The Nike Hyperdunk 2012 is a popular choice on the court during the 2012 Olympic Games, and now a commemorative colorway is getting ready to be released. This “Gold Medal” Hyperdunk features a patriotic inspired colorway, starting off with a predominately White upper. Navy Blue is used as the accent color, with Red seen in the details. The Gold <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5hc2stc2hvZXMuY29tL25pa2UtYmFza2V0YmFsbA__" target="_blank">2012 Nike Basketball Shoes</a> Swoosh on the heel sets Team USA up for prevail, which so far looks like a guarantee. The latest Mache custom is definitely a dope one. He shows his support for soldiers hurt in combat on the Nike LeBron 9 “Wounded Warriors Project” Custom. the shoe features an amazing paint job, which is inspired by the war hawk style plane. The Nike LeBron 9 “Cool Grey” is used as a base, and also features blue and white colors, along with the prominent teeth design on the front. Named after the legendary University of Oregon track coach Bill Bowerman, the Nike Air Trainer 1 NRG “BB51? Pack is now hitting select retailers. Constructed from suede and high-grade leather, the shoe comes in a choice of black or off white, both of which feature a unique carbon woven knitted tongue. Both are finished off with “BB51 AIR” branding embossed on the heels, as well as laser etched details on the side panels. The Nike Air Foamposite Pro – Gym Green has been used as the base, and features a large Sole Swap logo on the back of the heel, while a green sole replaces the original translucent one, matching the already green accents seen throughout the design. These would definitely go great with some camouflage, as they’re pictured here together.

<br />In the wee hours of the morning Sneaker News gave you a look at a visual rendering of an upcoming Air Jordan V release thought to be this year’s Air Jordan Doernbecher. While the Air Jordan V was thought to be the likely to be the model of choice for the November release of the Doernbecher Freestyle IX, it’s been noted by theclosetcollector, who <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5hc2stc2hvZXMuY29tLw__" target="_blank">Nike Basketball Shoes</a> posted the Air Jordan V rendering and info, that the upcoming 2012 Doernbecher release looks to instead be the Air Jordan IX. Putting our attention back on this particular Air Jordan V, this tonal elephant print version is slated to be a Retro release for the second half of 2013 and features rampant use of the Air Jordan III-specific material on the upper, and in a rather creative move, on the outsole of the shoe. Light blue hints on the upper has also been noted on this 2013 Retro release. Here’s a re-done Air Jordan III by sneaker customizer <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5hc2stc2hvZXMuY29tL25pa2UtYmFza2V0YmFsbA__" target="_blank">2012 Nike Basketball Shoes</a> JWDanklefs, whose notable works include the Air Max Light ‘Homegrown’ and Air Max 90 ‘Stash’; in conjunction with this Saturday’s ‘Kickin’ it at the Border’ sneaker event in Laredo, TX, JWDanklefs uses the United States Border Patrol as the inspiration for this custom, using the Border Patrol Agent’s uniform-specific colors as well as the official patch logo on the tongue. When word first broke it was mistakenly pegged as this year’s Doernbecher Freestyle release, a word we corrected once official info came down that it was instead a model in the works for the second half of 2013. And after that we were pretty sure the model would be firmly tucked away until the calender flipped but nope, here we have it-the first real shots of the Air Jordan V with the all over elephant print coating. As you can see, the sneaks go the extra mile with a groundbreaking elephant print extending all the way to the icy soles.

<br />Hello Kitty's Furry Tale Theater is an Japanese-American co-produced animated series based on the popular Japanese character, Hello Kitty. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5icmFzc21vbmtpLXNob2VzLmNvbS9oZWxsby1raXR0eS13b21lbnMtbmlrZS1kdW5rLWhpZ2gtcGluay1ibHVl" target="_blank">Hello Kitty Womens Nike Dunk</a> The series involved her and her friends doing their own version of popular fairy tales and stories. Each of the 13 half-hour episodes consisted of two 11-minute cartoons, for a total of 26 “shows”; each show was a spoof of a well-known fairy tale or movie. Each cartoon opens with the theater filling up with patrons, and usually a look at some comical goings-on backstage. The play then begins (with Hello Kitty saying “Once upon a meow”) and the stage transforms into whatever setting the story calls for (outer space, the American Old West, et cetera) <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5icmFzc21vbmtpLXNob2VzLmNvbS8_" target="_blank">2012 Nike Hello Kitty Shoes</a>. Each show is a lighthearted takeoff of a children’s story or a popular movie; subjects include Frankenstein, Crocodile Dundee, “Goldilocks,” and “How the Grinch Stole Christmas.” At the end, the stage returns to normal, and the actors take their bow. One exception to this format is the cartoon “The Phantom of the Theater,” which begins after the actors have finished a show; all the action in this story takes place backstage. The Adventures of Hello Kitty and Friends is a 3D CGI animated series featuring Hello Kitty and <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL21pY2hhcnBlYWxzLndvcmRwcmVzcy5jb20vMjAxMi8wOS8yNi9uaWtlLWR1bmstaGlnaC1wcm8tc2ItcGFwYS1iZWFyLXRocmVlLWJlYXJzLw__" target="_blank">Nike Dunk High SB Papa Bear</a> other characters from the Japanese company Sanrio.

The series focuses on core values established more than 30 years ago by Sanrio such as: happiness, family values, friendship, and educational values.

<br />Sonic the Hedgehog, trademarked Sonic The Hedgehog, is a title character and the protagonist of the Sonic the Hedgehog series released by Sega, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5zaG9lcy12aWxsYS5jb20v" target="_blank">2012 Nike Sonic The Hedgehog Shoes</a> as well as in numerous spin-off comics, cartoons, and a feature film. While many individuals at Sega had a hand in Sonic's creation, programmer Yuji Naka and artist Naoto ?shima are generally credited with the creation of the character, a blue 15-year-old anthropomorphic hedgehog, who has the ability to run at supersonic speeds and the ability to curl into a ball, primarily to attack enemies. This is a major part of the gameplay of the series. While Sega were seeking a flagship series to compete with Nintendo's Mario series along with a character to replace Alex Kidd as the company's mascot, several character designs were submitted by its AM8 research and <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5zaG9lcy12aWxsYS5jb20vc29uaWMtdGhlLWhlZGdlaG9nLWMtMjAuaHRtbA__" target="_blank">Sonic The Hedgehog Nike Dunk Sneakers</a> development department. Many results came forth from their experiments with character design, including an armadillo (who later developed into Mighty the Armadillo), a dog, a Theodore Roosevelt look-alike in pajamas, and a rabbit (who would use its extendible ears to collect objects, an aspect later incorporated in Ristar). Eventually, Naoto ?shima's spiky teal hedgehog, initially codenamed &quot;Mr. Needlemouse&quot;, was chosen as the new mascot. Sonic's blue pigmentation was chosen to match Sega's cobalt blue logo, and his shoes were a concept evolved from a design inspired by Michael Jackson's boots with the addition of the color red, which was inspired by both Santa Claus and the contrast of those colors on Jackson's 1987 album Bad; his personality was based on Bill Clinton's &quot;Get it done&quot; attitude.

The laceless design didn’t work out in the end, but the tech-flex stayed, providing a different take on the ongoing lace-cover look and providing additional, rather than primary, support. Underneath, rather than conventional laces, the shoe relied on thinner cables that strapped everything down via some decidedly functional lace locks. But then again, the XVI’s weren’t the most successful of Air Jordans. Of course, MJ wasn’t around to promote either of these sneakers in-game due to retirement, but this time it was for good. This white version of the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5zbmVha2VyLTIwMTIuY29tL2Fpci1qb3JkYW4tc2hvZXMtYWlyLWpvcmRhbi0xOS1jLTdfNzQuaHRtbA__" target="_blank">2012 Air Jordan 19 Shoes</a> contains a patent leather toe and leather uppers. The lace-covering mesh is inspired by the Black Mamba snake. Either way, you can’t go worng with black and red. Although, the shoe is mostly black color from the patent leather toe box, to the leather uppers, to the suede straps. There are just a few minor red accents on the carbon fiber-plated outsole and other various places on the shoe. The shoes themselves showcase a patent leather toe, like all XIX’s, in black, while the rest of the leather uppers are white leather. The mesh, inspired by the Black Mamba snake, is also black, matching the patent leather. This shoe was the Midwest version of the XIX that released as part of a regional series. The rest of the uppers are white leather, while the lace-covering mesh is a see-through white. Some great qualities of the Air Jordan XIX is a carbon fiber shank plate, phylon midsole, full-length zoom air unit, patent leather toe box, tech-flex upper, Velcro heel strap and plastic lace-locks.

Nike is set to release the “œAir Attack” and it should quell all of your Air Max desires. Seen here in some bright colorways, the pack is set to release on April first and is available for pre-order. Each of the five pairs sports their own unique colorway. Two of the five use black as a base color and accent with purple or green laces and outsoles. A third pair sports a grey upper that is interrupted by red piping that matches the red laces and outsoles. Finally, the last two pair are completely monochromed from top to bottom in either a powder blue or red. The Air Attack Pack is days away from launch, and we’ve seen a number of sneaker styles and even some apparel from the pack already. Today we have a look at one of the most iconic sneakers ever created, the Nike Air Max 1. Originally created in 1987, the <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5hb2wtc2hvZXMubmV0Lw__" target="_blank">Nike Air Max 1</a></strong> began as a groundbreaking technical running silhouette, and has since become somewhat of a cult classic in the sneaker culture. Five new colorways of the <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5hb2wtc2hvZXMubmV0L25pa2UtYWlyLW1heC1uaWtlLWFpci1tYXgtMS1jLTJfNC5odG1s" target="_blank">Nike Air Max 1 Shoes</a></strong> are included as part of the Air Attack Pack. As with the previous sneaker styles included in the pack, the Air Max 1 color combinations are very simple. That doesn’t mean you should overlook the details though, as each of the colorways combines a unique mix of materials, including canvas, synthetic leather, nylon, and nubuck materials. Two pairs utilize monochromatic designs, as Football Blue and Sport Red are slathered over every nook and cranny of each respective set. Sport Red makes a second appearance on the third pair, complementing Metallic Silver along the quarter panel and grey elsewhere. Finally, the fourth and fifth pairs mix materials on their black uppers, as the Club Purple-accented pair possesses a pony hair Swoosh, while patent and suede both appear on the final pair.
