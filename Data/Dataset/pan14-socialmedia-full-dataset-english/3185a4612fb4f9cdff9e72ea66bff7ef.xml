<br />After receiving our email announcing our upcoming interview 
<br />with Bruce and Kris Jenner, one of our loyal readers wrote:
<br /><br />&quot;Emily,
<br /><br />&quot;I usually read, with great enthusiasm, 
<br />your helpful comments in your emails regarding blended families.
<br /><br />&quot;However, this week's email, which shared 
<br />the 'lessons from Kris and Bruce Jenner', 
<br />just made me laugh out loud -- and not for a good reason. 
<br />If anything, this family is the direct opposite 
<br />of what a blended family would want to accomplish!
<br /><br />&quot;Lessons include:
<br /><br />* how to teach your daughters, through example, 
<br />     how to dress like whores and demean themselves
<br /><br />* how to solve problems through physical violence and cursing
<br /><br />* how to instill proper moral values by encouraging 
<br />     your young daughters to visit the Playboy mansion,
<br />     hang around with &quot;Girls Gone Wild&quot; creator, and 
<br />     basically whore themselves in any way possible 
<br />     out for a dollar.
<br /><br />&quot;What a disgrace to those of us who are actually working hard, 
<br />day in and day out, without the cameras rolling, 
<br />without getting paid, without getting famous 
<br />simply because our children made a sex tape. 
<br />And what a disgrace that you would hold them out 
<br />to be paradigms of blended-family success.
<br /><br />&quot;Cancel my emails. You have officially sold yourself out.&quot;
<br /><br />- L.W., Pennsylvania
<br /><br />We at Blended-Families.com take a complaint like this seriously 
<br />and we ask you to consider for yourself whether it is worthwhile 
<br />to ask your toughest questions of the Jenners.
<br /><br />The Jenners face many challenges with the Hollywood antics 
<br />of the older girls, no doubt, but they have endured 
<br />as a committed couple, they are hard working, 
<br />their kids seem to have a lot of affection for them 
<br />and each other and they don't take themselves too seriously. 
<br />Every family is different and perhaps not the moral ideal 
<br />of others, but, in our opinion, that is no reason for us 
<br />to discount their successes as a blended family.
<br /><br />While we don’t condone the behaviors of Kris’ daughter 
<br />or what the younger ones are exposed to, 
<br />we also continue to be impressed with how they are not shirking 
<br />from the realities their family faces.
<br /><br />We do not endorse their TV show nor do we encourage your daughters 
<br />to follow in their footsteps.  And, learning from parents 
<br />who have had to deal with issues most of us would like to deny 
<br />could ever happen to our kids might make a real difference 
<br />for some.
<br /><br />We ask you to judge for yourselves 
<br />the value of the Jenners' experience.
<br /><br />And, it’s also up to you whether you choose to judge us harshly 
<br />for providing you access to parents 
<br />who have beaten the odds while in the public eye.
<br /><br />Our goal is to serve you and to learn as much as we can 
<br />about what has helped other blended families thrive 
<br />and enjoy each other instead of coming apart like 70% 
<br />of blended families end up doing.
<br /><br />We welcome your feedback and your questions.

Most of the times spouses label these differences as inadequacies and failings of the other spouse. Labels which has put walls instead of bridges between them. If we can start with some acceptance of that and then look for the ways in which to bridge these differences, then we can establish a starting place from which to navigate the tumultuous waters in which we often find ourselves in our relationships. 
<br /><br />In his book, T<em>he Secrets of Happily Married Men</em>, <strong>Dr. Scott Haltzman</strong> takes the discussion of how men can be successful in their marriages and relationships.  While he explains of why men do or don’t think about romance and relationships in the same way as their female counterparts, he is not excusing or giving men permission to avoid working on these aspects of their relationships. Instead he points out that men and women do speak different languages, so to speak, and that what is more important than the differences, is what can be achieved (in the absence of blame and judgment) when two people decide to rewrite the rules on their relationship and define their relationship they way they want to define it. Relationships in second marriages face similar challenges especially if one or both spouses have been in a previous relationship. 
<br /><br />Dr. Haltzman urges men to stop feeling inadequate, to shrug off the unrealistic expectations that they should be someone else. Husbands in blended families who try to take on the role of the ex-husband just to please the wife and the step-children. Dr. Haltzman encourages men to start playing their strongest suits in their relationships.  He calls on men to apply the same attention to detail and eagerness to succeed to their relationships that they naturally put into their work or towards any project in which they’re involved.

This problem exists even in therapy where the goal is to establish good working relationships between couples. This is one place where we could really stand to re-frame things differently.  
<br /><br />It could also be a starting point of understanding differences on how men and women deal with relationships. It needs recognition that if men are truly not as emotional, as receptive to emotion as women or as socialized to make relationships their primary objective, then it is where we can move things forward. 
<br /><br />This knowledge can be used to further our understanding of what might be happening or not happening in relationships, or it can be used to blame people for not having adequate relationship skills.  Blame and judgment are not  prime motivators for getting people to make changes in their lives.  They actually fall more into the category of de-motivators, if there is such a word.  
<br /><br /><strong>Dr. Scott Haltzman</strong>, author of best-selling book, <em>The Secrets of Happily Married Men</em>, points out that men can be successful in their marriages and relationships and are capable of taking it to a new level.  He found out in his experience as a personal and family counselor that men think differently about romance and relationships in the same way as their female counterparts. However, he is not excusing or giving men permission to avoid working on these aspects of their relationships. There are biological differences between the two sexes that differentiates one from the other. However, more than the differences is their capability to direct the path of their relationship.

It talks about eight  strategies how men can enjoy their marriage without necessarily tainting their strong sense as male.  Dr. Haltzman points out that men are created differently from women and has the capability of fulfilling their important role in a relationship. He urges men to stop feeling inadequate, to shrug off the unrealistic expectations that they should be someone else, and to start playing their strongest suits in their relationships.  He calls on men to apply the same attention to detail and eagerness to succeed to their relationships that they naturally put into their work or towards any project in which they’re involved.  
<br /><br />The outcomes and results will probably look much different when a man and woman are both putting their all into a relationship – and that’s okay. The point is that the care, the attention, the intention, the effort and the willingness to do what it takes to have a good relationship are actually the ‘real’ makings of a strong relationship, despite what it looks like on the outside.  
<br /><br />Dr. Haltzman’s book points out that both sexes are capable of making their relationships a priority – even if they do it in profoundly different ways.  And both are also equally capable of accepting and respecting each other for their differences and encouraging each other to be the best they can be in their relationships.  
<br /><br />By focusing more of what our partners do offer and can bring to the relationship rather than on how they are different and what areas they are lacking in, we will encourage and nurture the best relationships possible.

And now <strong>Dr. Scott Haltzman</strong>, author of best-selling book,  <em>The Secrets of Happily Married Men</em>, is suggesting that the stereotypical way in which men (and women) are being portrayed as husbands and wives on television sitcoms, is actually cementing the belief that men are completely inept in the relationship department.  How can this be good for men, for women, relationships or families in general?  
<br /><br />In his book, Haltzman discusses the varied reasons behind relationship dissatisfaction and breakdown, and focuses in on how men are portrayed and described as relationships buffoons who couldn’t get it right to save their lives.  This stereotype does nothing to promote good relationships.  
<br /><br />Men and women are different biologically. However, if the focus is given on the differences as problematic and the definitions of the “perfect marriage” or relationship, which can impede two people from being realistic about who they are, what they have to contribute, and what they want out of their life together.  This is made more difficult of course because of the way in which our media portrays relationships as either perfect or hopeless, with very few good examples, of real people, with real differences, making their way through and creating a good life together. 
<br /><br />Dr. Haltzman’s book offers men the challenge to be the best men they can be in relationship with their partners and that is an important challenge for all of us to take seriously – men and women alike.

This stereotype does nothing to promote good relationships.  
<br /><br />1.)

<br /><br />One can only hope that somewhere between the excessively romantic portrayal of men in some modern-day movies that hold them to an almost impossible standard, and the comic version of the blubbering relationship idiot in any number of family sitcoms, are real men who can and do want to be successful in relationships with their partners. Haltzman contends that this is entirely possible but it begins with men recognizing who they are and what they have to contribute, not simply becoming someone they are not, or giving up entirely because they are told that they “can’t do relationships”.

<br /><br />However, a vast majority of stepfamilies miss the chance to honor themselves for all the effort it takes to make a blended family work. According to blended families expert Emily Bouchard, “most stepparents do not know this day exists for them. They feel alone thinking that they are the only ones who are experiencing what it is like to be in a blended family.”  
<br /><br />To help blended-families cope up with pressing problems, Bouchard, founder of  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.Blended-Families.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.Blended-Families.com</a>, is offering three different opportunities for stepparents to participate in live question and answer calls offered at noon, 3pm and 9pm Eastern time. Using an innovative way to collect specific questions prior to the calls, “we can be sure to address all the concerns listeners have, while still having an environment where everyone can easily hear the expert answers” explains Jesse Fisher, the LLC's Managing Member.
<br /><br />Additionally, to make the most out of Stepfamily Day, Bouchard recommends “having a blended family focused potluck with some activities planned for the different age groups of children.”   According to Bouchard “the goal is to spend the day connecting and being with others who are blending too.”   Since Stepfamily Day falls on a Tuesday this year Bouchard suggests waiting until the weekend if it is too stressful to plan something during the week. 
<br /><br />To register for the live question and answer calls on September 16, please visit

There is the traditional expectation that the marriage will be long and happy and the newly created blended family will share in the couple’s obvious warmth and contentedness. And, unlike younger blended families with school age kids, the older couple can concentrate on each other without the stress and tension around raising each other’s kids. In many cases, this dream situation works out, but often it takes time, understanding and a reassessment of expectations. 
<br /><br />In their best selling book, <strong>Step Wars: Overcoming the Perils and Making Peace in Adult Stepfamilies</strong>, <em>Grace Gabe, M.D. and Jean Lipman-Blumen, Ph.D.</em> describe and discuss the issues and problems in adult stepfamilies, from in-depth research data gathered from numerous focus groups and individual interviews with people in all the major roles in stepfamilies. They have amassed a treasure trove of enlightening and useful information that will educate and guide anyone in an adult stepfamily.
<br /><br />One common burning question is, “Why would mature, independent, married adult children have a negative reaction to their parent’s happy remarriage?” The authors explain that much of the pain in adult stepfamilies is due to excessively high expectations on the part of the older couple and with personal anecdotes and professional insight, they illustrate why the high expectation of loving acceptance can be dashed with the surprising negative reaction from their independent and mature children.
<br /><br />This topic is expounded more in the book, Step Wars, by Grace Gabe, M.D. and Jean Lipman-Blumen, Ph.D. There’s no substitute for reading the book, but a close second is to join us on an <strong>Ask the Expert Interview</strong> with Grace Gabe and Jean Lipman-Blumen on <strong>September 30, 9 pm EST</strong>.

Younger couples with kids, who remarry, face the typical blended family stressors of co-parenting responsibilities, transitioning kids, dual household finances, stepsibling rivalry, and ex spouse issues, all of which dilute the energy of the adult relationship and leave little time for the couple to nurture each other.
<br /><br />In their groundbreaking book, <strong>Step Wars</strong>, <em>Grace Gabe, M.D. and Jean Lipman-Blumen, Ph.D.</em> describe and explain the surprising and unique dynamics of the adult stepfamily. After analyzing in-depth interviews and focus groups among a representative cross section of remarried parents and their adult children, the authors have written the definitive book about the reality of stepfamilies and adult children. Their book highlights a multitude of real and identifiable relationship examples that illustrate the major issues and problems between adult stepchildren, their parents and stepparents, and provides practical and encouraging advice and strategies for parents and adult children alike. Adult stepfamilies can be satisfying and heartwarming when parents, adult children and grandchildren work together as a healthy and happy family unit.

<br /><br />These are described as “the hidden rewards that lie within every adult stepfamily”, in other words, the positives, the advantages, the assets and the opportunities that can enhance the life of a stepfamily and help it connect and grow, whether it’s long established or brand new.

Climbing the  ladder is not easy; it is the result of significant years of hard work, serious dedication to education and advanced job training, and a laser beam focus that often puts a personal life on hold.  Invariably, single, successful, career women suddenly find themselves in love, and often the partner of their dreams is a divorced man with kids.
<br /><br />Becoming an instant stepmom is sometimes the most challenging task a successful career woman will take on, and even though she has earned and enjoyed a fulfilling and accomplished professional life, the complex demands of step parenting can confuse, frustrate, and create a lack of confidence in even the most capable and talented career women. 
<br /><br />A Career Girl's Guide to Becoming a Stepmom by Jacquelyn B. Fletcher is the definitive guide that speaks the language and describes the shared experience of career women. And, as it addresses every important issue about being a step mom, the book combines a real life perspective, a positive attitude, and a practical approach that focuses on solutions, never defeat or negative compromise.  Her best selling book is based on her own lived experiences and important contributions from experts in the field, adult step children, and other respected career women turned step mothers. She writes with understanding, compassion, transparency and business-like clarity.

Fletcher is comparing a new job to the new family.  In a new job, “you must learn the culture before you can be effective”.  The learning curve is steep and it's essential to spend time, to build new relationships, to ask questions, to understand the dynamics of the company,  and in return, share information about yourself so the new workplace can know you and trust you. The basic professional skills of listening and learning are equally important in a family as in a company. This will ease up the way for a career woman turned an instant stepmom.  
<br /><br />Fletcher’s book is based on her own lived experiences and important contributions from experts in the field, adult step children, and other respected career women turned step mothers. She writes with understanding, compassion, transparency and business-like clarity.
