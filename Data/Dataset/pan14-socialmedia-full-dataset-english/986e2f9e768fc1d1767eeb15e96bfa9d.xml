<br />Believing it would last forever.
<br />So, tell me, baby,
<br />Where did I go wrong...
<br /><br />Everything I had was yours,
<br />More than I have ever given before,
<br />So, wont you tell me
<br />Did I hurt you so bad...

<br />Where nothing ever happens -- and I wonder
<br />Isolation is not good for me
<br /><br />Isolation -- I don't want to -- sit on a lemon tree
<br />I'm stepping around in a desert of joy
<br />Baby anyhow I'll get another toy
<br />And everything will happen -- and you'll wonder
<br /><br />I wonder how I wonder why
<br />Yesterday you told me 'bout the blue, blue sky

<br /><br />How much grain have I spent
<br />Feeding the bird of love paradise
<br />But that was a bird of passage
<br />Run away from my embrace.
<br /><br />Smashing glasses, blood on my hands
<br />Tears in my eyes, please come back.
<br /><br />Two of us were triangle of love
<br />I loved your best friend like brother
<br />You were unplucked flower then
<br />I did not know what sorrow is.
<br /><br />Smashing glasses, blood on my hands
<br />Tears in my eyes, please come back.
<br /><br />With the invasion of dew in the morning
<br />You have left without warning
<br />Now I personally pull my own hair
<br />Remembering your treatment.
<br /><br />***
<br />Notes: This mess is perheps the only &quot;love song&quot; from RA. Many individual lines are taken from popular songs, usually slightly distorted. At the end, there is some recititation of lyrics from famous Serbian (neo)romantic poets. The music comes in two versions: Summit is gothic death rock version inspired by Laibach. A lighter reggae version is called Santa Maria.
