investigation supplies on the internet as of Thursday, March 22, 2007 CNES is the official French Area Company and Geipan is definitely an agency from the French Countrywide Police Would be the files a scorching Smoking cigarettes Gun, or just another buy of cold French Fries <br /><br />CNES receives about fifty to 1 hundred UFO reviews each and every year The investigative method they use is convoluted and rather distinct from what most Americans would anticipate Geipan apparently does the majority of the field work, prepares reports and passes every thing on to CNES Researchers and Engineers have a look at that data and prepare some type of last report or appraisal of the matter in query <br /><br />Jacques Patenet, the aeronautical engineer who heads the office for the study of &quot;non-identified aerospatial phenomena&quot; has said that &quot;the information that we are releasing doesn t demonstrate the presence of extraterrestrial beings But it doesn t show the impossibility of this kind of existence both The concerns stay open up &quot;<br /><br />On the day of the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5vZmZpY2lhbG1pY2hhZWxrb3JzYmFnLmNvbQ__" target="_blank">Michael Kors Handbags</a> announcement and press conference, CNES safety was tight Although calling the release &quot;a globe first&quot; and glowing over his nation's openness regarding the UFO topic, Patenet failed to explain the need to have &quot;to display out uninvited UFOlogists&quot; as an explanation for the extra security This barely gives evidence for anybody to think the agency's files represent a fair and unbias look in the phenomenon Even so, in contrast for the actions of their American counterpart, this can be like allowing people to walk into French Intelligence Headquarters and browse via their files <br /><br />Each and every time American UFO Researchers inquire their very own space agency for just about any details about astronaut encounters or unusual phenomenon encountered by room probes, NASA clams up and sends out the debunkers en force Even though several Astronauts have been forthcoming and extremely truthful about what they've noticed in space, the space agency always slams the door on them More than some have been hit correct among the eyes by NASA which promises that the Astronaut statements were the results of room sickness, fatigue or depression But just before we give the French as well big a pat on the back, let's look at what's becoming released <br /><br />The CNES-Geipan reports only stand for what men and women have reported towards the French Authorities as UFO sightings and encounters This really is in no way, form or type a release of data that allows us to examine all that the French know about the phenomenon Although the investigations have clearly been handled within a much more capable and specialist method, this can be really little a lot more than a French edition with the U S Undertaking Blue E-book Report <br /><br />We've observed these kinds of releases just before more than the past many many years In every case, the info came from individual government agencies, not the authorities itself I recall when everyone received all thrilled concerning the release in the KFB files on UFOs I used to be unimpressed That's due to the fact I obtained official Russian News Posts and private newsletters printed in nations as soon as managed from the Soviets for years prior to that release These were sent to me by critical scientists in people countries who appreciated receiving materials from me <br /><br />Many thanks to the efforts of Russian language students who donated their time, the majority of what I obtained was rapidly translated and contained a huge level of details about the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5vZmZpY2lhbG1pY2hhZWxrb3JzYmFnLmNvbQ__" target="_blank">Michael Kors Outlet</a> UFO phenomenon in Russia and Eastern Europe Ironically, I could not come across a single incident mentioned in these posts and newsletters that matched any inside the KGB information releases I felt then and now that the info I received from people individuals was as excellent or greater than most of what was released from the KGB <br /><br />In 1989 I'd the chance to fulfill Marina Lavrentrevna Vasliyevna Popovich at a press occasion in Ny Town Marina was a pilot within the Soviet Air Force, holder of 13 world aviation data along with a previous Examination Cosmonaut She spoke of private UFO encounters and individuals she had heard about from other pilots Whilst the info was exciting, it had been not anyplace near the most effective that her govt needed to offer about UFOs and Extra-Terrestrial Lifestyle UFO Scientists could be wise to see the CNES-Geipan information in the identical way <br /><br />Like The usa, France is recognized for getting two faces Their public encounter, along with the 1 they use for behind the scenes political posturing A superb instance of this lately came to light when it a secret communication between France and Israel was leaked to the press Although publicly condemning Israel's advance into Lebanon not extended ago, the French Government secretly encouraged them to invade Syria and institute a regime adjust The USA performs the same games <br /><br />Through the 1990s, President Clinton announced that the federal government had allowed top secret radiation tests on American citizens All he admitted was that small amounts of irradiated supplies had been unveiled into population centers or planted on soldiers throughout army workouts Nobody believes that was all of it and everyone currently realized about army workouts held throughout and quite near to atomic bomb exams Clinton surely didn't make mention of how the CIA implanted tiny units into the heads of U S and Canadian psychiatric individuals for more than twenty years without having permission Nor did he discuss any in the other government thoughts manage or remote viewing projects that have left large quantities of victims in their wake <br /><br />Information releases like the latest from CNES and Geipan can only be useful when it comes to analysis and information, but nobody should give France, Russia or every other nation credit for what must have been accomplished all along It could be a error to offer nations like these kudos for releasing bits and items of UFO and also other paranormal investigation data when so much still remains secret
