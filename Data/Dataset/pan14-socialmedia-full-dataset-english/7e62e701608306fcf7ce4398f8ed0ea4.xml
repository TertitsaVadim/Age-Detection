<br /><br />Applauding 12 Point SignWorks progress in Sign industry and their recent deal, Jack Warner, VP of Signworld said, “Murray and his team at 12 Point Signworks were recently chosen to be the sign manufacturer of choice for Sweet CeCe’s, a frozen yogurt chain based in Nashville, TN. I congratulate them on this achievement.”
<br /><br />Sweet CeCe’s currently has 39 locations in 10 states.  When asked about how he became the sign company of choice for Sweet CeCe’s, Murray said, “We started the relationship by working with one local store to create some custom interior signage, and from there we had the opportunity to be introduced to the corporate decision makers.”
<br /><br />“We wanted to create an interior sign package that would be lower cost, simpler to fabricate, and easier to install than the original signage from the incumbent sign company.  We prototyped a few different options and settled on two styles from which the new franchisees can choose.  We’re currently working on orders for 5 more stores”, added Murray.
<br /><br />Highlighting importance of Signworld’s in this progress, Jack Werner said, “Murray utilized the Signworld Business Model in which he worked hard through the consultation process and showed the value of his service to one customer, and then climbed the ladder to a much bigger partnership.”
<br /><br />“When one becomes a part of the Signworld family, they receive high end sign making equipment and software, point-of-sale, accounting and contact management equipment and software, just to name a few. All these with proper guidance from the experienced team at Signworld help them to achieve their financial goals in this competitive sign industry”, said Jack Warner, VP Signworld Corporation.

<br /><br />Michael Goldstein, a new Signworld owner from the May 2011 training class, is just about ready to open in Brookfield, CT and has been working hard in his “pre-opening” marketing efforts to have a full pipeline of projects when the doors open.
<br /><br />Jack Werner, VP of Signworld says, “Michael joined the local BNI chapter, better known as Business Networking International.  Through his enthusiasm in expressing his desire to fabricate compelling signage and to create “Raving Fans”, a philosophy that Signworld teaches in New Owner Training, he gained a number of believers.”  One member of the group decided to introduce him to the CEO of a new fast food chain.
<br /><br />“Michael’s approach with the CEO was not the normal “Can I have your business?”  But rather, “Let me understand better what is currently going on with your current sign provider, and how can I be of service?”, added Jack Warner.
<br /><br />Michael Goldstein is the owner of Unlimited Signs Designs &amp;amp; Graphics in Brookfield, CT . Michael is one of many Signworld Owners to utilize our “Find the problem, find the pain” philosophy taught to both Ken Kindt, founder of Signworld, and Jack Werner, former Signworld owner and current Vice President, in their 6 years of Sandler Sales Training, a world renowned sales training program.
<br /><br />Michael learned the problems the CEO was experiencing dealing with his current supplier of signs and through his efforts, he will open his doors with a customer that has great potential for being a big buyer of signs. Michael said, “My goal is to utilize what I learned in New Owner Training, to learn who the CEO is connected to and to be introduced to those connections so that I can continue to build my business through an extensive referral chain!”
<br /><br />By working this philosophy of doing business, Michael will follow along in the shoes of most Signworld Owners who would tell you that 80% of the business comes from less than 30 repeat customers.

<br /><br />Jack Warner said, “Since forming a strong relationship with HP and Grimco Sign Supply, Signworld has had 10 new operations since January choose the HP DesignJet L25500 which features latex based ink rather than the solvent-based inks that are used in most large-format printers.”

<br /><br />Also present on the occasion was Ken Kindt, President of Signworld. He and Jack Warner, Vice President, highlighted use of new greener printing technology within Signworld chain of owners.
<br /><br />“The decision to offer HP printer package in addition to the Roland VersaCAMM VS-540 took a while to come to fruition, but has since taken many steps in the right direct to make the HP L25500 and its next generation, a major piece in the Signworld Equipment Package for years to come.”, said Jack Warner
<br /><br />Speaking to a larger gathering, Ken Kindt, President of Signworld said, “With the help and support of Grimco Inc., a major sign supply company with branch warehouses across the U.S., Signworld has been able to offer its new owners a training program in their own facility on the in’s and out’s of the printer that is not available to any other franchise organization or independent sign company.”

<br /></strong>
<br />Laguna Hills, CA – November 16, 2011 - Jack Warner, Vice President of Signworld, would like to announce the unveiling of a brand new preferred pricing program with Avery, a large manufacturer of adhesive backed vinyl’s and overlaminates, for Signworld Owners.
<br /><br />Jack Werner says, “The new program was put in place on November 1st, 2011 and is finally making its way through the distributor chains.  Under this new program, Signworld Owners will receive a discounted price on all Avery materials through their desired distributor.  The largest of discounts will be provided by Fellers, a distributor based in the Midwest that primarily caters to the vehicle wrap industry and most of its sales revolve around adhesive-backed vinyl.” 
<br /><br />“We recently met with Signworld to discuss a National Franchise Program negotiated especially for Signworld through the Avery network of distributors.  Avery Graphics &amp; Reflective Products are quality branded products that can be used for a number of applications from Vehicle Wraps to Window, Wall and Floor applications.  This program is available to Signworld and will help reduce cost of goods sold and serve as a huge competitive advantage over each owner’s local competition.  We have worked hard with Signworld over the past few years and we are mutually excited to release this program.  I know this program will be a success for all involved.  We look forward to seeing a large growth spurt in the sales of Avery products to the Signworld organization and potentially making the program discounts even better in the future.” Said Randy Schuette, Western Regional Key Account Manager.
<br /><br />Jack Warner followed by saying, “We are truly excited to unveil this program and partnership with Avery.  Avery is one of the largest manufacturers of adhesive-backed vinyls and we’re proud to be able to unite Signworld with Avery.”
<br /><br />Adhesive-backed vinyls are used in the fabrication of roughly 75% of all of the signs in the world.  The fact that we can now offer a discount in partnership with Avery to our owners allows them the ability to be more profitable by cutting their cost of goods while still utilizing some of the best and most reliable products in the world.” added Jack Werner.

<br /><br />Laguna Hills, CA – November 16, 2011 -  Jack Warner, Vice President of Signworld, recently participated in the Franchise Brokers Association’s annual conference in Orlando, FL.
<br /><br />The Franchise Brokers Association is one of the largest organizations of franchise coaches whose goal is to educate those looking into business and franchise ownership and help those that are qualified to operate their own business find the right opportunity that best fits their financial and lifestyle goals.  Jack Werner represented Signworld at the annual conference which featured 40 of the top franchise and business opportunities in the world in an effort to educate each FBA Coach about the Signworld opportunity and what the right candidate for Signworld looks like.   Through the two-day conference, Jack spent time with each coach individually giving them a well-rounded education on the Signworld business model, the types of custom signs our owners fabricate as well as the type of candidate that would be the best fit to be successful under Signworld’s “wing”.
<br /><br />In addition to the education provided at the conference, Jack Werner also offered an opportunity for the FBA coaches to really dive in deep and get more than just there feet wet in regards to their understanding of Signworld.  The day before the conference Jack boarded a chartered bus with 30 of the FBA’s more than 200 coaches that arrived early to the conference and headed off to US Signworks, a Signworld location owned by Mike Allsup in Winter Park, FL.  The short excursion allowed each coach to see a working facility and put a “face with the name”, so to speak.  Each coach was able to ask their questions and see the answers rather than hear the answer.  
<br /><br />Of the excursion Jack says, “The sign industry is one of those industries that everyone forgets about, even though we use signs every day.  Signs can be as simple as “volume up/down” on your TV or “on/off” on your coffee maker and as elaborate as the large lighted signs on the front of the buildings we enter every day.  It’s amazing how much we forget that signs are an integral part of society and structural order.  That’s why most individuals looking at business ownership don’t realize the amazing opportunities presented by sign organizations like Signworld.  Everything that we can do to help educate these coaches about Signworld can in turn directly affect the coach’s candidate’s ability to truly learn about the concepts that are best aligned with their goals.  The main reason we do these excursions is to give the coaches who represent us the best opportunity to succeed in presenting Signworld accurately.”

<br /><br />The design concept was approved by Corporate Headquarters with the first vehicle, the Ford Escape. “Once the theme is finalized, the same concept theme as other agents come on board and we fit it to accommodate their vehicles. There are various approved images provided by the Cruise Lines from which agents may select the one that matches their most popular ships and destinations”, said Rebecca.
<br /><br />First Coast Signs was able to wrap the Ford Escape in Jacksonville.  Even though the owners live in Atlanta, they were heading to Ft. Lauderdale for the annual sales conference held aboard the Allure of the Seas.

<br /><br />Emphasizing on the importance of team work, Jack Werner said, “By Signworld owners working together, it has allowed Rebecca and First Coast Signs to keep the customer, and allow others to help with installation. I appreciate the initiative shown by Pathfinder and Magnum in reaching out and helping Rebecca and her team to achieve this target. 
<br /><br />Rebecca says of the project, “We are proud to be associated with Signworld and when it comes to projects like these the support that we get from all quarters is really overwhelming.
