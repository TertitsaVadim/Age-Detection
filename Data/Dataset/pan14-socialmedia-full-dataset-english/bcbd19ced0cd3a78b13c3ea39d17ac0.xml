<br /><br />ISLAMABAD - The red carpet première of a musical comedy English play ‘Aladdin - a musical spectacular’ was staged on Wednesday night in front of a packed, rather overcrowded, audience at the auditorium of Pakistan National Council of the Arts (PNCA), as children described it a spectacular show, perhaps because of all child cast except the Genie (Mustafa Ali Khan). TLC Productions presented the adopted version of Disney’s Aladdin in collaboration with Capital development Authority (CDA), while Pakistan Today partnered the show. In the musical comedy, Aladdin (Mikaiel Naqvi, 13) is back as the “street rat” of Agrabah winding up the unlikely owner of his very own Genie (Mustafa Khan), who grants him 3 wishes.
<br />When he meets the rebellious young Princess Jasmine (Zara Qadir, 11) daughter of the Sultan, he falls in love with her. But the princess is being courted by Jafar (Zarnab Rashid), an evil wizard with impure intentions. He is searching for the lamp that holds the Genie who is now Aladdin’s ally, hoping to usurp both the Sultan’s throne and the Genie’s power. Can Aladdin save Princess Jasmine? Will he live up to his promise to the Genie? Or will he lose it all to Jafar’s nefarious attacks? It’s an unforgettable experience the crowd simply enjoyed with roar. 
<br />Oheed Ahmed, 10, said the production did the movie justice, and the special effects were very well executed.
<br />“You will hear music from the movie, as well as the other songs sung by Jasmine. True to the movie, you will see Aladdin and Jasmine flying on the magic carpet, the cave of wonders, and even the wonderful parade that was used to bring the prince to the palace,” he said adding of course, as with the movie itself, the Genie is a thing of wonder even in the stage show and costumes used by characters all were awesome.”
<br />The director and producer of the show, Bina, said it was a Herculean task to stage the play but the team of youngsters had made it possible. “The Aladdin family has done me proud and I hope and pray that they are blessed with nothing but the best in life and all of their dreams come true,” she concluded.
<br />The play will continue to be staged at the PNCA Auditorium daily on 7:00 pm till November 5.

The first host was Bob Saget who provided commentary on topics such as wedding and sports bloopers children and pets getting in trouble and furniture or other objects collapsing. The top three videos of the week are eligible for a cash prize and the winner is selected by the studio audience.
<br /><br />Executive produced by Vin Di Bona, with co-executive producers Todd Thicke and Michele Nasraway,it is currently the longest-running prime time entertainment program on ABC. It is based on the Tokyo Broadcasting System show Fun TV with Kato-chan and Ken-chan, which featured a segment in which viewers were invited to send in video clips from their home movies; Vin Di Bona Productions pays a royalty fee to the Tokyo Broadcasting System for the use of the format.Contestants can either send their videos in via mail on DVD or VHS, or, since 2008, upload them onto ABC's official website.
<br />Due to its very low cost, the format has since been reproduced around the world, and AFV-inspired TV specials and series continue to emerge periodically in the United States. American television series inspired by AFV's format that are not related to the series itself include The Planet's Funniest Animals, The World's Funniest!, The World's Funniest Moments, Funniest Pets and People and It Only Hurts When I Laugh; however, most of the series inspired by AFV (with the minor exception of The Planet's Funniest Animals) have not matched the success of America's Funniest Home Videos and have not lasted as long. Several local television stations, even those not affiliated with ABC, also developed special funny home video segments in their newscasts during the early 1990s, inspired by the series.
<br />Every week, three videos are chosen by the producers and voted on by the studio audience. The winner wins US$10,000, and is in the running for the $100,000 prize at the end of the season, while the runner-up receives $3,000, and third place banks $2,000. Very early in the show's run, the second and third prizes were a new TV and VCR and a new camcorder, respectively. On the initial hour-long special, the grand prize was $5,000 with second and third places winning a new camcorder; the producer picked the winner, with no audience voting. Periodically beginning with the Tom Bergeron run of the series, the $100,000 winner at each season's final $100,000 contest will also win a free vacation package, supplied by either Adventures by Disney or Disney Vacation Club, in addition to the monetary prize.
<br />The show produced a spin-off titled America's Funniest People, which began in 1990 and lasted until 1994. Another short-lived spinoff was created in 1996 with World’s Funniest Videos, which was cancelled after its first season. Show creator Vin Di Bona also created two series featuring home videos that are largely culled from those seen on AFHV and <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5kdmRib3hzZXQydS5jb20vYW1lcmljYXMtZnVubmllc3QtaG9tZS12aWRlb3MtZHZkLWJveHNldC0xOTkwMjAwNS1wLTc3Ni5odG1s" target="_blank">America's Funniest  season dvd boxset</a> </strong>People: the first-run syndication series That's Funny, which ran from 2004 to 2006[8], and the Fox Family Channel series Show Me The Funny, which ran from 1998 to 2000. Many of the clips have been used internationally in various comedy compilation programs, with changes such as dubbing and subtitling. The title of the show is usually changed and the studio segments are omitted.
<br />According to the closing credits of each episode, most of the videos have been edited for length due to time constraints. In addition according to the contest plugs, family members (both immediate or relatives) of employees of Vin Di Bona Productions, ABC, Inc., its corporate parent The Walt Disney Company and their related subsidiaries are ineligible for the show's contests and prizes.

This past week's episode, 'The Age of Reason,' is another exceptional addition to the overall story.
<br />Yet again, <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy53aG9sZXNhbGVkdmRzb25saW5lLmNvbS9ib2FyZHdhbGstZW1waXJlLXNlYXNvbi0xMi1kdmQtYm94LXNldC1wLTIyMzguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">Boardwalk Empire season dvd boxset</a></strong> crams so much story and character development into an hour long show that it blows my mind. This week, secrets were discovered, backs are stabbed (as well as throats slit), various alliances are falling apart as new ones start up in their wake, and, in a show that is notorious for the ending of life, a new life begins, although not under the best of circumstances.
<br />Van Alden returns to the forefront and it seems that all of his sins are beginning to catch up with him. He has a pregnant Lucy still basically imprisoned in their secret apartment, and she looks like she could give birth at any second. At the same time, Agent Clarkson is hanging on to a thread of life after the warehouse explosion two episode back left him burnt over almost his entire body. Van Alden is filled with remorse over this and knows that he is to blame. Even worse for him, Clarkson is beginning to speak and Van Alden fears that it's just a matter of time before all of his shady dealings come to light.

		<document id="ed4698431c547efb5556694eb5937014" url=""><![CDATA[Police Story Season<br/><br/>Classic anthology series which details the personal lives of the men and women of the Los Angeles Police Department. The stories ranged from highly dramatic to extremely funny. Even though there weren't any real regulars Don Meredith and Tony LoBianco were often seen throughout the run of the show as detectives Bert Jameson and Tony Calabrese respectively.
<br /><strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy53aG9sZXNhbGVkdmRzb25saW5lLmNvbS9wb2xpY2Utc3Rvcnktc2Vhc29uLTEtZHZkLWJveC1zZXQtcC0zNDQ0Lmh0bWw_" target="_blank">Police Story season dvd boxset</a> </strong>dramatically changed the way cops were depicted on TV when it began airing on NBC in 1973. The show, created by LAPD detective sergeant-cum-novelist Joseph Wambaugh and executive producer David Gerber, ushered in an era of gritty realism at a time when most law enforcement heroes were stoic straight-arrows or gun-slinging mavericks.
<br />This show, however, gave a warts-and-all portrayal of officers just trying to cope with the stresses and situations of the job. It was an anthology with no regular cast, and it portrayed cops in a variety of assignments, such as homicide, vice and robbery. Later shows such as Hill Street Blues,NYPD Blue and Homicide: Life on the Street were influenced by Police Story, which ran from 1973 to 1978.
<br />Police Story's legacy also included three spinoffs. David Cassidy: Man Undercover (1978-1979), which featured the former Partridge Family star reprising his Emmy-nominated <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy53aG9sZXNhbGVkdmRzb25saW5lLmNvbS9wb2xpY2Utc3Rvcnktc2Vhc29uLTEtZHZkLWJveC1zZXQtcC0zNDQ0Lmh0bWw_" target="_blank">Police Story  dvd</a></strong> role, Dan Shay. Joe Forrester (1975-1976) featured Lloyd Bridges as a veteran foot patrolman. But the most popular by far was Police Woman (1974-1978), which starred Angie Dickinson as undercover cop Sgt. &quot;Pepper&quot; Anderson. It was influential in its own right as the first successful hour-long drama starring a woman. Police Woman paved the way for such shows as Charlie's Angels, The Bionic Woman and Cagney &amp; Lacey, and was credited with increasing the number of female applicants to law enforcement agencies.

The mysterious &amp;quot;A&amp;quot; continues to send messages to the four girls after saving them from Ian. It was announced in June that a special Halloween-themed episode would air as part of ABC Family's 13 Nights Of Halloween special. This increased the episode count from 24 to 25.
<br />Alison's mother comes back in a really special episode coming up—it's an annual charity fashion show that the Pretty Little Liars have always been at, and Alison's mother asks them to honor Alison in this particular one because it's the show she would've been cochair of. I don't want to give too much away, but it's a great episode, we find out Alison's mother and one of the Pretty Little Liars' parents have a secret too they've been hiding.
<br />It's a spooky season filled with a lot of great <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy53aG9sZXNhbGVkdmRzb25saW5lLmNvbS9wcmV0dHktbGl0dGxlLWxpYXJzLXNlYXNvbi0yLWR2ZC1ib3gtc2V0LXAtMzU0NS5odG1s" target="_blank">Pretty Little Liars dvd</a></strong>  moments. We continue to keep all those balls in the air—what I call the schizophrenia of the show: murder in one sentence, lip gloss in the next. It's working, we're having a lot of fun. In every episode you realize there's more to the story—there's more to what this character is, there's more to what the mystery is, there's more to what happened on the night Alison disappeared, it's just sort of like opening these doors and revealing there's so much we haven't learned yet.

The catch is it's only for one minute if they are alive longer than a minute someone must die in their place he also can't touch someone he saves again or they will die and he can't save them again. He discovers this when he's ten years old and he saves his mother after brain hemorrhages. The result is his next door neighbor dies unfortunately his daughter is the girl Ned dreams about. Later that night when his mother tucks him in she kisses his forehead and dies. The girl Chuck now lives with her aunts and Ned is sent to boarding school by his father. Many years later Ned owns a pie shop because his &quot;gift&quot; allows him to re ripen rotten fruit. He also helps a PI with cases because he can ask murder victims about who killed them. One day on the news it's announced that a reward has been set on information about the murder of a tourist and rewards being the Emerson's (the PI) only motivation the two of them get involved in the case and soon Ned finds out that the dead girl is Charlotte Charles the girl he called Chuck.
<br />As I watched the first ten minutes of the opening episode of <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy53aG9sZXNhbGVkdmRzb25saW5lLmNvbS9wdXNoaW5nLWRhaXNpZXMtc2Vhc29uLTItZHZkLWJveHNldC1wLTM3MTkuaHRtbA__" target="_blank">Pushing Daisies' second season</a></strong>, I was overcome by a nagging sense of fear and dread. Not because the show's that bad - it isn't. In fact, it's probably one of the best shows currently on television, a beautiful mix of heart-on-your-sleeve romanticism, deceptively sly verbal humor, and a macabre sense of imagination that would make Roald Dahl proud. The reason for my momentary panic had more to do with my profound fear that this gorgeously off-beat show might be the newest causality of the post-writer's-strike TV malaise. I mean, if shows with high-concept, audience-friendly premises like Terminator and Heroes are struggling to regain their audiences this fall, does something as unusual as Pushing Daisies really stand a chance? For our sakes (and the sakes of TV critics forced to watch the entire fall line-up), let's hope so, because Bryan Fuller's ode to death, mystery, and pie-making hasn't lost any of its charm during its summer hiatus.
<br />Basically, to any viewers thinking of giving Daisies a chance this fall, all I can say is - give it until the third episode. If you're not completely won over by Bryan Fuller's storybook romance or the cast's surprisingly biting dialogue, then this probably isn't the show for you. As for me, I take great pride in admitting that I have no idea where the rest of <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy53aG9sZXNhbGVkdmRzb25saW5lLmNvbS9wdXNoaW5nLWRhaXNpZXMtc2Vhc29uLTItZHZkLWJveHNldC1wLTM3MTkuaHRtbA__" target="_blank">Pushing Daisies'  season dvd boxset</a></strong> is headed and I'm looking forward to watching it unfold in ways I know I won't be able to predict.

Bestowed with strange powers the five very different teens realize they have a lot more to worry about than just picking up litter. Especially as they discover that they are not the only ones who have been giving strange powers. Secrets will be revealed feelings will be brought to the surface and relationships will be formed and broken. But hey its only 6 weeks of community service what's the worse that could happen?
<br />Last Sunday saw the premiere of the third season of &quot;<strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy53aG9sZXNhbGVkdmRzb25saW5lLmNvbS9taXNmaXRzLXNlYXNvbnMtMTItZHZkLWJveHNldC1wLTMyNTQuaHRtbA__" target="_blank">Misfits season dvd boxset</a></strong>,&quot; a British television show about a group of young offenders who gain superpowers after a mysterious lightning storm. The third season sees off Nathan Young, played by Robert Sheehan, and the introduction of Rudy Wade, played by Joseph Gilgun.
<br />Before the season premiere, a 10-minute webisode was posted online detailing the circumstances of Nathan's departure. In it, he uses his new ability to perform &quot;magic&quot; to earn a fortune at a Las Vegas casino. Nathan is caught and thrown into jail, unbeknownst to the rest of the group. All in all, the webisode was fairly entertaining, sending out a well-loved character in a hilarious and fitting way.

It also follows his internal torment as he falls in love with one he should not one who is mortal named Beth a news reporter as well as his dealings with the woman who made him a vampire his sire Coraline.
<br />The show is produced by Warner Bros. Television and Silver Pictures. Joel Silver is executive producing with Trevor Munson and Ron Koslow both writing and executive producing.
<br />Well, though the actress hasn’t yet announced anything formally, it’s been her highly visible baby bump that let the cat out of the bag!
<br /><br />Well, only recently, the prolific actress was spotted in LA, showing off her pretty big baby bump, which clearly indicates that she is getting ready to welcome another bundle of joy into her life.
<br />Though the Hollywood diva is expecting, she shows no interest in revealing anything about the paternal details of her yet-to-be-born baby.
<br />Seems as if Hollywood has set in some trend of ‘bringing up your baby without revealing the name of the father’!
<br />In the past decade, we have seen several female fatales of the tinsel town, who have chosen to be single mothers and opted not to unveil the paternal details of their babies.
<br />Oh gosh! I’m just unable to understand why these celebrities put the future of their kids on stake, for the sake of their own selves!
<br />Anyway!
<br />While the soon-to-be-mommy is due to give birth at the end of this year, she’s trying her level best to hide the news from the media.
<br />But as you know, we’ve got an eagle eye! How could a celebrity even think of escaping us!
<br />That too, in case of a thing like ‘Pregnancy’!
<br />Silly Shannyn, I must say!
<br />Already a mother to an eight-year-old son, Audio Science, Shannyn is known for her remarkable role on the vampire drama series,<strong> <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy53aG9sZXNhbGVkdmRzb25saW5lLmNvbS9tb29ubGlnaHQtc2Vhc29uLTEtZHZkLWJveHNldC1wLTMzOTcuaHRtbA__" target="_blank">Moonlight season dvd boxset</a></strong> . One can watch Moonlight online to revel in the action that the actress brings to our screens.
<br />She’s always been an eye-catcher on the series, courtesy her killer looks and fantastic acting skills.
<br />Well, if I exclude her personal life; I have to say that I’m a great fan of Shannyn. She has always been on the top my favorite celeb list.
<br />Anyway, I wish the actress gets to download a lot of happiness in her life with the arrival of this new guest.

<br />And though it’s light on extras, if you’ve never seen the great Hong Kong actioner “Infernal Affairs” (R, $19.99), on which “The Departed” was based, the new Blu-ray release is the perfect excuse.

<br />Not everyone has liked SGU--out of the 915 comments reacting to the cancellation of the series on this site to date, most from fans upset by the news, a small number said that SGU didn't measure up its older brothers in the Stargate franchise--but you don't have to be a rabid fan to recognize that intelligent, serious speculative fiction series like SGU are the kind of shows that need support and love from their networks. 
<br />The usual efforts are under way to save SGU through social media, with who knows what level of audibility to the suits at Syfy. MGM has reportedly already thrown in the towel, shutting down everything Stargate related, including DVD movies in the development stages. The actors have started to pick up other projects. Last month Stargate guru Brad Wright told a crowd at the Official Stargate Convention in Vancouver that he was cleaning out his desk. There may not be any more Stargate at all after Monday.

Bounty hunter Travis Montana and his female cousin Percy patrol the galaxy hunting criminals. Travis who was kidnapped as a baby by Raiders searches for his lost father Dante while investigating the secrets of the mysterious Dvinity Cluster.
<br /><strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy53aG9sZXNhbGVkdmRzb25saW5lLmNvbS9zdGFyaHVudGVyLXNlYXNvbi0yLWR2ZC1ib3gtc2V0LXAtMzIwNy5odG1s" target="_blank">Starhunter season dvd boxset</a> </strong> follows the exploits of the crew of a retired luxury-liner refitted to serve a bounty-hunting crew, led by Dante Montana (Paré). The owning company's name &quot;Trans-Utopia Cruiseship HHS&quot;, was painted on her side but has faded, leaving some letters readable while obliterating others. The letters that remain have become her nickname, so she is casually known as &quot;Trans Utopian&quot; or &quot;Tulip&quot;.
<br /><br />In the first season, Tulip is owned by Rudolpho deLuna, who has hired Dante Montana as a bounty hunter. Dante took the job to provide a means of traveling, while also financing the search for his son, Travis, who was abducted a decade prior by a group of brigands, called Raiders. Aiding him are the ship's engineer, Percy Montana (Dante's niece) and security officer Lucrecia Scott, a former marine, added to the crew by deLuna to keep Dante focused on the missions given him. However, Lucrecia also has a hidden agenda, and is actually an operative for a mysterious organization called &quot;The Orchard&quot;, a group of scientists and researchers dedicated to unlocking, and later controlling, a group of alien genes called &quot;The Divinity Cluster&quot;.
<br />When broadcast in Canada, each episode began with a long message transmissing from deLuna (usually to Dante), outlining Dante's current assignment and deLuna's (i.e. the episode author's) philosophical thoughts about it. In the United States, these monologues were removed.
<br />In the second season, the show was restructured (and retconned). Percy Montana emerges from hyperspace, unaged — although fifteen years have passed in the outside universe. No other characters remain in the show from the first season except for DeLuna. He attempts to reassert his ownership of Tulip, but since he had collected the insurance on the ship, as the Tulip was presumed lost, the insurance company now legally owned her. However, the company was now out of business, so Percy claims ownership by salvage. Travis Montana, Dante's son and Percy's cousin, joins the crew together with his sidekick, Marcus Fagen. DeLuna also joined, bringing along Callista Larkadia, another bounty hunter. Percy describes the four as the &quot;pretend cousin, big fat sleaze, little buddy [and] mystery slut,&quot; though she eventually accepts the fact that Dante's son Travis Montana really is her cousin.
<br />The show did not continue in production after season two despite pre-orders from US, European, Canadian and Pacific Rim broadcasters for a third season, leaving the story at a cliffhanger: In the season finale, Tulip is trapped in hyperspace. As the countdown to implement the crew's desperate measure to return to the normal universe reaches zero, the show cuts to black and the credits roll.
<br />Creators and producers G. Philip Jackson and Daniel D'or left the series during the second season over business differences within the executive team of the parent company Greystone Studios International Inc., and went on to develop the science fiction television series and video game Ice Planet. Jackson was an uncredited writer on eight of <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy53aG9sZXNhbGVkdmRzb25saW5lLmNvbS9zdGFyaHVudGVyLXNlYXNvbi0yLWR2ZC1ib3gtc2V0LXAtMzIwNy5odG1s" target="_blank">Starhunter's  dvd</a></strong> second season episodes.

Their lives were never the same again. After their mother's murder their father took an interest in the supernatural and the unexplained and raised the boys as warriors with skills to fight back against the unknown and protect the innocent. 22 years later with Sam and Dean grown up their father suddenly disappears on a suppose routine supernatural hunt. Sam and Dean search for their father and along the way help anyone with a supernatural problem with the help from their dad's journal that contains most of his knowledge about thesupernatural that he had accumulated over his 22 years of none-stop obsessive hunting.
<br />Now that the love potion has worn off, it’s time for Supernatural to head to the Garden State. With Bobby (Jim Beaver) in tow, the Winchester Brothers head to New Jersey to seek out a creature that has been attacking people in the woods.
<br />Written by the always wonderful Ben Edlund, tonight’s episode of <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy53aG9sZXNhbGVkdmRzb25saW5lLmNvbS9zdXBlcm5hdHVyYWwtc2Vhc29uLTUtZHZkLWJveHNldC1wLTMyOTEuaHRtbA__" target="_blank">Supernatural dvd</a> </strong>, entitled “How to Win Friends and Influence Monsters,” centers around the townsfolk pointing to the mythological Jersey Devil for the cause of all the deaths in the area.
<br />In an attempt to find out exactly who (or what) is behind these attacks, Sam (Jared Padalecki), Dean (Jensen Ackles) and Bobby are forced to set up camp in a state park and become real-life hunters (Bambi-killer, not demon-killer).
<br />Unfortunately, a rogue beast isn’t the only thing they need to worry about. After finding out that a Biggerson’s restaurant is in the area, Dean is excited chow down on their famous sandwich, despite Sam’s “free food for a year” having long expired (you really thought he would have gotten more from being the one-millionth customer).
<br />Of course, when it soon becomes apparent that the seemingly ordinary, yet delicious, sandwich is making people crazy, Dean must put his hunger on hold, in order for Sam and Bobby figure out what exactly is going on – if for no other reason than for Dean to be able to eat a Biggerson’s sandwich while remaining sane.
<br />Talk about food to go crazy over.

<br />Chuck is an action-comedy/spy-drama television program from the United States created by Josh Schwartz and Chris Fedak. The series is about an &quot;average computer-whiz-next-door&quot; named Chuck, played by Zachary Levi, who receives an encoded e-mail from an old college friend now working for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA); the message embeds the only remaining copy of the United States' greatest spy secrets into Chuck's brain.

The fifth season will be the last; it began on October 28, 2011, moving to Friday nights at 8pm/7 Central.The series will conclude on January 27, 2012 with a two-hour finale.

<br />CSI: Crime Scene Investigation DVD (also known as CSI: Las Vegas and also abbreviated as CSI) is an American crime drama television series which premiered on CBS on October 6 2000. The show was created by Anthony E. Zuiker and produced by Jerry Bruckheimer. It is filmed primarily at Universal Studios in Universal City California.
<br />When the first CSI series made its way to TV, producer Jerry Bruckheimer worried about a copycat series stealing his hit show’s thunder. There was no way he was going to let somebody else profit from a concept he rightfully stole from shows like the original Hawaii Five-O. So, he turned on that ol’ proverbial green light and approved the commission of a spin-off series. Thus, <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy53aG9sZXNhbGVkdmRzb25saW5lLmNvbS9jc2ktbWlhbWktc2Vhc29uLTctZHZkLWJveHNldC1wLTEwNTkuaHRtbA__" target="_blank">CSI: Miami season dvd boxset</a></strong>came into existence rather quick-like. In fact, I suppose you could even say that it was rushed into production. What’s really interesting about that is that, even nine years down the line, that feeling of hastiness is still very much in effect.
<br />Honestly, I can’t imaging how this show has lasted as long as it has. Generally, when a show jumps the shark and turns into a parody of itself, it ceases to be. Period. End of story. In the case of Bruckheimer’s discomfiting forensic series with the outrageously over-the-top David Caruso, however, it only seems to grow stronger with each reality-bending plot, general lack of logic, and that abundance of awful acting to boot.
<br /><strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy53aG9sZXNhbGVkdmRzb25saW5lLmNvbS9jc2ktbWlhbWktc2Vhc29uLTctZHZkLWJveHNldC1wLTEwNTkuaHRtbA__" target="_blank">CSI: Miami  dvd</a></strong>- The Ninth Season opens with the less-than-exciting conclusion to the Season Eight finale, wherein we lose one cast member (Eddie Cibrian, who was only on the show for one season anyway) to a psychotic antagonist. We also lose a lot of screen time from second-billed Emily Procter, who is only shown from the shoulders up to hide the fact she was pregnant when she filmed most of this season. Boston Legal’s Christian Clemenson all but becomes a regular here, though he’s still not part of the opening credit crawl.

American businesswoman Ruth Handler (1916-2002) is credited with the creation of the doll using a German doll called Bild Lilli as her inspiration.
<br />Barbie has been an important part of the toy fashion doll market for fifty years and has been the subject of numerous controversies and lawsuits often involving parody of the doll and her lifestyle. In recent years Barbie has faced increasing competition from the Bratz range of dolls.
<br />We're back to, &quot;Is it Barbie? here, or isn't it?&quot; Universal has added another Mattel? Barbie? movie to their roster, just in time for the Christmas buying season: Barbie?: Princess Charm School. I've gone back and forth on these Barbie? movies, but this one is innocuous enough for its intended audience. A few small extras are included in this perfect-looking transfer.
<br />Now I've reviewed quite a few these straight-to-DVD Barbie? movies, and Barbie?: Princess Charm School is an adequate addition to the line. As I wrote in another review, I don't like to go too deep into these as I would with a regular movie...because who the hell is expecting an in-depth analysis of Barbie?: Princess Charm School? As I watched this one with my 9 and 5-year-old daughters, pretty much the same questions came up from previous viewings. My youngest didn't understand that Blair was Barbie?, a reasonable confusion that frankly I never understand with these movies, either. In the two previous outings, <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy53aG9sZXNhbGVkdmRzb25saW5lLmNvbS9iYXJiaWUtY29tcGxldGUtc2VyaWVzLWR2ZC1ib3hzZXQtcC0xMjA1Lmh0bWw_" target="_blank">Barbie season dvd boxset</a></strong>? was an actress, so it makes sense, her playing the part of another girl. Is she playing a part here, too, or is Blair a new character, or...oh, who cares: Blair, Barbie?, whatever. A couple of times my 9-year-old asked where Gardenia was, and why the movie didn't show the kingdom, or who ruled it, or where all those princesses were coming from, or where they went once they graduated (are their principalities of Gardenia<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/unsure.gif" alt=":)" />, and quite frankly, I didn't have an answer for her on any of that (I suppose we could have discussed the story's weird inequalities and how they're strangely resolved...but who wants to discuss gender and socio-economic politics with a five-year-old<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/unsure.gif" alt=":)" />. Barbie?: Princess Charm School is a little light on logic when it comes to its paper-thin retelling of the Anastasia story, with a little Cinderella thrown in for familiarity.

Meanwhile off in a castle in the distance a cruel young prince is cast under the spell of an enchantress who turns him into a tormented beast and transforms his servants into animated household objects. In order to remove the curse the Beast must discover a true love who will return his affection before the last petal falls from an enchanted rose. When Belle's inventor father stumbles upon the Beast's castle and is taken prisoner Belle comes to the rescue and agrees to take her father's place. With the help of the castle's enchanted staff she sees beneath the Beast's exterior and discovers the heart and soul of a human prince.
<br />Of all his films, though, none has as much enduring magic as <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy53aG9sZXNhbGVkdmRzb25saW5lLmNvbS9iZWF1dHktYW5kLXRoZS1iZWFzdC1kdmQtYm94c2V0LXAtMTE0MC5odG1s" target="_blank">Beauty and the Beast dvd</a></strong>. Released in 1946, it is a potent and meticulously realized cinematic fairy tale. Working from the original story by Mme Leprince de Beaumont, Cocteau invents a whole other plane of existence, one he invites us into with a typical storytelling incantation, &quot;Once Upon a Time...&quot; 
<br />Most of us know the story of Beauty and the Beast. In the French countryside, a once wealthy merchant (Marcel André) is struggling to keep his family out of the poorhouse, efforts disrupted by his fun-loving son Ludovic (Michel Auclair) and his selfish daughters Félicie and Adéla?de (Mila Parély and Nane Germon). His only devoted child is Belle (Josette Day), and though her sisters judge her harshly, the merchant at least sees that she has the family's best interest at heart. No overtones of Lear here; this daddy doesn't waver in his love for Cordelia. That's why when she asks for him to bring a rose back from his next trip, he more than willingly agrees.
<br />Too bad he picked the wrong garden to snatch it from. The merchant wanders into an enchanted estate, one owned by the cursed Beast (Jean Marais, who also plays Belle's suitor, Avenant, a duality that will become thematically important when you watch the film). This Beast doesn't take kindly to anyone stealing any of his treasures, no matter how small. In exchange for his life, the merchant must send one of his daughters to stay in the Beast's mansion. Belle insists on sacrificing herself, since the offending rose was for her. She goes fully expecting to die, but instead, the Beast gives her a life of luxury. Each night, he feeds her a banquet and showers her with gifts and proposes marriage, hoping one day she will learn to appreciate him and say yes. He is a man at odds with his own nature. The human inside the furry form has love and compassion to give, but the animal instinct that comes with his transformation stokes a primal fire deep down.

Bleach follows the adventures of Ichigo Kurosaki after he accidentally obtains the power of a Soul Reaper—a Japanese death personification similar to the Grim Reaper—from Rukia Kuchiki. Gaining these abilities forces him to take on the duties of defending humans from evil spirits and guiding departed souls to the afterlife.
<br />In the first part of season four we were introduced to the Bounts, near immortal humans with special powers that live off of consuming human souls.  That season revolved around the leader of the Bounts, Kariya, plot to capture a Quincy and use his power to open a portal to the Soul Society.  They accomplish this, and as season 5 open Ichico and his gang follow them.
<br />Even after travelling to the Soul Society however, Kariya and the Bounts need to get into the inner fortress, the Sereitei, where all of the leaders of the Society reside.  To achieve this end they head towards the most crime-ridden area of the Society, Rukongai.  They recruit the lower class citizens and use them to help open the giant gates of the Sereitei, promising equality for all after the Society falls.  Of course they double cross these poor wretches, abandoning them after they've entered the fortress, thanks in part to a diversion that destroys several buildings.
<br />The 13 squads fan out to capture the intruders, but the Bounts are not that easily conquered.  Each one of them can easily take on a whole squad, and they're even a match for a squad captain.  It turns out that the Soul Society is permeated with energy that the Bounts can tap at will to heal themselves, making them virtually invincible. 
<br />The Bounts split up, dividing the defending forces.  While his comrades are fighting the Captains, Kariya has a chance to accomplish his real mission:  to obtain a Bount crest, the J?kaish?.  With this powerful item, Kariya has the power to destroy the whole Sereitei, and that's exactly what he plans to do if Ichigo can't stop him.
<br />This season, like the previous one, wasn't adapted from the <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy53aG9sZXNhbGVkdmRzb25saW5lLmNvbS9ibGVhY2gtc2Vhc29ucy0xMTAtZHZkLWJveHNldC1wLTExODQuaHRtbA__" target="_blank">Bleach dvd</a></strong>manga as the first three seasons were, and it shows.  This story line didn't have the punch that the earlier ones did.  Yes, the Bount's doll's were fun weapons for them to wield, but the Bounts themselves weren't really all that unique, as far as villains go.  They possessed neither the creativity of the Hollows nor the personalities of the Captains.

The top three videos of the week are eligible for a cash prize and the winner is selected by the studio audience.
<br />If home videos of people bonking their heads, unwittingly setting their pants afire, and tumbling down large slopes into great pools of waters occasionally strike you as funny, then America's Funniest Home Videos - Nincompoops &amp; Boneheads is for you. All others need not apply. Eighty minutes worth of sometimes funny amateur video clips and mostly unfunny, sometimes excruciating filler, this two-episode set from the long-running ABC series is good for cheap, easy laughs.
<br />The first show, &quot;Nincompoop-A-Rama,&quot; is hosted by Tom Bergeron and is more than five years old, dating back to March 4, 2001. The second episode, &quot;Salute to Boneheads,&quot; dates back even further, having originally aired on January 11, 1996. It's hosted by a grinning but openly contemptuous Bob &quot;I don't want to be here&quot; Saget, who at one point actually makes fun of the studio audience's Pavlovian applause. Maybe there's something admirably subversive about Saget; he's like the Eddie Haskell of stand-up, all smiles and nice-young-man suburban charm yet almost openly disdainful of the very hand that feeds him.
<br />And that's it. Home video clips, comedy shtick filler. <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy53aG9sZXNhbGVkdmRzb25saW5lLmNvbS9hbWVyaWNhcy1mdW5uaWVzdC1ob21lLXZpZGVvcy1kdmQtYm94c2V0LTE5OTAyMDA1LXAtMTMxMy5odG1s" target="_blank">The America's Funniest Home Videos season dvd boxset</a></strong> clips, some of which are repeated from other Shout!

<br />Highlights include overweight women who can't get out of dresses and playground swings, and two bozos trying to unload an ATV onto a dock without first considering Newton's Second Law of Motion. One good bit has a father videotaping his hyped-up daughter doing cartwheels. She's screaming &quot;Watch me!

They just took everything that children have adored so much about Pooh and his friends for generations now and did it really, really well.
<br /><strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy53aG9sZXNhbGVkdmRzb25saW5lLmNvbS93aW5uaWUtdGhlLXBvb2gtY29tcGxldGUtc2VyaWVzLWNvbGxlY3Rpb24tZHZkLWJveHNldC1wLTExODguaHRtbA__" target="_blank">Winnie the Pooh season dvd boxset</a></strong>weaves together a few simple stories. For starters, Pooh has a rumbly tummy but is fresh out of honey. He'd ask his friends if he could borrow some, but...well, it's kind of a hectic day in the Hundred Acre Wood. Eeyore's tail has gone missing, and everyone bands together to find him a brand new one to take its place. It's just that they're fresh out of tails, so they each try plugging on different things to see what'd be a good fit. Christopher Robin joins in on that fun, but not all that long afterwards, he vanishes! A mysterious note left behind makes it sound like it could be the sinister handiwork of the Backson. Pooh and his pals cobble together a scheme to rescue Christopher Robin, but -- oops! -- they wind up getting caught in their own trap. 
<br />Honestly, I can't think of a movie I've seen this year -- animated or live-action! -- that I adore anywhere near as much as Winnie the Pooh. It so brilliantly captures the magic, wonder, and heart of a classic Disney film that it feels as if I've been flung back in time. Winnie the Pooh isn't just a kids' movie; it's a family film in the truest sense of the word, so warm and funny that it plays beautifully if you're two or eighty-two. Very, very Highly Recommended.

From the Maurice Sendak classic Where the Wild Things Are to the beloved adventures of Curious George and Corduroy parents and children alike are sure to enjoy these classic treasures featuring celebrity narration from Sarah Jessica Parker James Earl Jones and many more!
<br />If Treasury of 100 Storybook Classics sounds familiar, it's because DVD Talk's been down this road before. Volume 1 of Scholastic's award-winning anthology of beloved children's classics really broke the mold for DVD releases aimed at the younger crowd. As our own Stuart Galbraith IV hinted at in last year's review, it's getting tough to find kid's DVDs that aren't loaded with toy commercials, shallow stories and rapid-fire editing. Luckily Scholastic has returned to the well for<strong> <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy53aG9sZXNhbGVkdmRzb25saW5lLmNvbS90cmVhc3VyeS1vZi0xMDAtc3Rvcnlib29rLWNsYXNzaWNzLXNjaG9sYXN0aWMtdmlkZW8tY29sbGVjdGlvbi1wLTExOTcuaHRtbA__" target="_blank">Treasury of 100 Storybook Classics, Volume season dvd boxset</a></strong>  another massive collection of guess-how-many books presented in a variety of visual forms. Listed below in their entirety, some of these quasi-animated stories borrow liberally from the original book illustrations, some are live action are others are slightly more static in nature. Celebrity narrators include Mia Farrow, Laura Dern, Rob Reiner, Ossie Davis, F. Murray Abraham, B.D. Wong, Alexander Gould, Calista Flockhart, Zach Braff, Anthony Edwards and more, but even the lesser-known speakers narrate these classics with style and flair.
<br />The format of this surprisingly compact release is similar to the last one: each of these 17 discs, which typically run for just over 60 minutes apiece, has been given its own loose &quot;theme&quot; (&quot;bedtime stories&quot;, &quot;school adventures&quot;, etc.), while some are grouped together by their respective authors. Many of the more well-known stories (listed below as the first on each disc) are granted &quot;team captain&quot; status, but nearly all of these stories should hold the attention of most young readers. As a whole, the set seems to be geared towards ages 4 through 9, though each individual disc is listed with a loose set of age guidelines. Of course, purchasing either volume of <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy53aG9sZXNhbGVkdmRzb25saW5lLmNvbS90cmVhc3VyeS1vZi0xMDAtc3Rvcnlib29rLWNsYXNzaWNzLXNjaG9sYXN0aWMtdmlkZW8tY29sbGVjdGlvbi1wLTExOTcuaHRtbA__" target="_blank">Treasury of 100 Storybook Classics dvd</a></strong> for use as a &quot;virtual babysitter&quot; would defeat the purpose entirely; as with the original books, these animated versions are much more enjoyable when read with (or by, or even to) a parent, guardian or sibling. To help replicate the original experience, each of these 100 stories is paired with &quot;read-along&quot; subtitles...so whether it's the older or younger viewer(s) doing the speaking, most of these stories are especially easy to follow.

It follows the professional and private lives of a team of trauma surgeons.The series was produced by Jerry Bruckheimer Television and Warner Bros. Television. It premiered on CBS on April 2 2010. In May 2010 CBS announced that the series had been canceled with the series finale scheduled for July 2 2010.
<br />LOS ANGELES (Hollywood Reporter) - The latest collaboration of one of Hollywood's pre-eminent power couples, CBS and Jerry Bruckheimer, is &quot;Miami Medical,&quot; a well-produced and graphic but otherwise terminally mediocre drama.
<br />Quite possibly, CBS is signaling a similar assessment of this flashy but shallow series by scheduling it Friday night. That's where most shows go to fade, not to flower.
<br />Regardless, it doesn't take long to realize that &quot;<strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5kdmRib3hzZXQydS5jb20vbWlhbWktbWVkaWNhbC1zZWFzb24tMS1kdmQtYm94c2V0LXAtMzU2Lmh0bWw_" target="_blank">Miami Medical season dvd boxset</a></strong> ,&quot; written by executive producer Jeffrey Lieber, is long on emotional manipulation and short on compelling characters and insightful storytelling, something of a throwback to the pre-&quot;ER&quot; days of Drs. Welby, Trapper John and that ilk. First-class production design and Kenneth Fink's smooth direction can't make up for a script that is mostly a hodgepodge of cliches.
<br />That might qualify as the most improbable of many head-scratching plot turns, but it isn't a favorite. One enjoys the kumbaya moment around one patient bed and the overall portrayal of a trauma team with a median age of about 23. Still, the biggest eye roll is when Dr. Deleo decides to operate on a dying burn victim to buy him an extra half-hour, enough time for a video hookup with his grief-stricken fiancee.
<br />Might that give hospital accountants seizures? Don't get your scrubs in a bunch, Dr. Deleo says. &quot;Tell 'em my credit card is in my wallet and they can charge me for it,&quot; he says defiantly. Where oh where are those death panels when you really need them?
<br />Also starring in this medical debacle is Omar Gooding as the ever-present nurse and Elisabeth Harnois as Serena Warren, a resident who spends as much time in the O.R. as she does fretting that she looks like a teenager. As if that is out of place in this series.

He lives with Bronx-born Intel analyst Trudy as they work undercover transporting drug loads into South Florida to identify a group responsible for three murders. Sonny Crockett [to the untrained eye his presentation may seem unorthodox but procedurally he is sound] is charismatic and flirtatious until - while undercover working with the supplier of the South Florida group - he gets romantically entangled with Isabella the Chinese-Cuban wife of an arms and drugs trafficker. The best undercover identity is oneself with the volume turned up and restraint unplugged. The intensity of the case pushes Crockett and Tubbs out onto the edge where identity and fabrication become blurred where cop and player become one - especially for Crockett in his romance with Isabella and for Tubbs in the provocation of an assault on those he loves.
<br />Miami Vice starts with a bang and rarely stops for a breath. Even when it gets quiet, those moments are packed with emotion or evil or sex. 
<br />Miami Vice is that summer movie that a lot of people have been waiting for, something for the adults to see, something that demands that you pay attention, something that doesn't pre-chew your experience for you and drop it into your beak like a mama bird, something with adults having relationships (with their clothes on and off) and dealing with some serious issues… and lots of guns &amp; drugs.
<br />There is not a single identifying thing from the TV series in the body of the film except for the character names and the fact that they deal with vice. The first thing that strikes you is the visual style, which is completely different. This is Mann &amp; Beebe's Collateral-eyed view of the world, but instead of the dingy gray of Los Angeles, there are the bright skies, blue seas, and thick, clouded rainy atmosphere of South Florida, alternatively beautiful and ugly and magically real.
<br />The first acts drags a little, though I suspect on second viewing, it will go down more easily. And there is the great feeling I have walking away from the screening room. This movie will play and play and play and play.
<br />No, it's not quite Heat. I do look forward to Mann working in this digital format with stars as iconic as Pacino and DeNiro. Foxx is solid as a rock here. And Colin Farrell, who gets a little clumsy when he has to do speeches with his American accent, gives Mann exactly what was needed when we feel the moment in his eyes or gestures.
<br />For me, this a big step from Collateral, which was a gimmick movie… a good gimmick, some good actors, a great visual styling (the digital production is not the gimmick I mean), but ultimately, it is a clock film with a forced relationship that has to stick to that clock and a massive movie star playing an ice cold killer.<strong> <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5kdmRib3hzZXQydS5jb20vbWlhbWktdmljZS1zZWFzb25zLTE1LWR2ZC1ib3hzZXQtcC0zNDAuaHRtbA__" target="_blank">Miami Vice season dvd boxset</a></strong>  is more free to roam. And because of it, the box office might not be as strong. On the other hand, it might be stronger, because this, to me, is a much more interesting, challenging, better movie.
<br />I kind of expect it to split critics and audiences. But I also expect it to age really well over time. And that is the price that Michael Mann so often pays for being Michael Mann. Thank goodness he is willing to do it for all of us.

Working under Gibbs is Special Agent Anthony DiNozzo a former homicide detective who joined NCIS just a few years ago but who has instincts that come only from working on the streets. Joining them are Agent Caitlin Todd a tough former Secret Service agent who's gone head-to-head with Gibbs in the past and forensics specialist Abby Sciuto a gifted scientist whose dark wit matches her goth-style hair and clothes. Assisting the team is medical examiner Dr. Donald &quot;Ducky&quot; Mallard who knows it all because he's seen it all. From murder and espionage to terrorism and stolen submarines these special agents travel the globe to investigate all crimes with Navy or Marine Corps ties..
<br />Mark Harmon, known as the almost apathetic yet determined detective, Special Agent Jethro Gibbs, of NCIS has temporarily made a move out of the hour long Navy detective series in order to fill a slightly different role in the two hour film adaptation of the John Sanford novel Certain Prey.
<br />The film is based on the work of former detective now Deputy Police Chief Lucas Davenport as he investigates the murder of a police officer who shows signs of being murdered by an infamous assassin named Carla Rinker, played by Tatiana Maslany (Diary of the Dead, Eastern Promises). Rinker was once a stripper who was raped, killed her rapist and did such a good job at it that she was recruited by the mob as hit-woman.

She also eventually kills this man. The more time that Carmel spends with Rinker the more capable she becomes of doing harm to others. If this movie did nothing else, it at least showed the personal growth of a character as the plot moves on.
