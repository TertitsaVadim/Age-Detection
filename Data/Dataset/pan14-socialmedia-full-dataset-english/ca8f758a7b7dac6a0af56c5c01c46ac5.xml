Over the years, the importance of music in a stress filled world has become more prominent. Many parents are choosing to enroll their children in music schools at a very young age to hone their talent and create better opportunities in the future.<br /><br />From the simple piano lessons to complicated notes and music reading, these schools provide students with an opportunity to understand the basics of music. A proper education in music will certainly help the person overcome their fears and learn to express themselves through this art form.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL215Lm9wZXJhLmNvbS9yZWVjZXJlaWxseTI1L2Jsb2cvMjAxMi8wNi8wNC9maW5kaW5nLXRoZS1yaWdodC1tdXNpYy1zY2hvb2w/Zmlyc3Rwb3N0PVk_" target="_blank">Finding the Right Music School</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3JlZWNlcmVpbGx5MjUucG9zdGVyb3VzLmNvbS93aHktZW5yb2xsLWF0LWEtbXVzaWMtc2Nob29sLW9ubGluZQ__" target="_blank">Music school</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5hbGl2ZW5vdGRlYWQuY29tL3NpbXdpbGxpYW0yNS9XaHktRW5yb2xsLUF0LUEtTXVzaWMtU2Nob29sLU9ubGluZS0tcHJvZmlsZS0xOTgxNDg5Lmh0bWw_" target="_blank">Music school</a>It's a question I get from time to time:<br /><br />&quot;Should I go to music school?&quot;<br /><br />The short answer that's true most of the time: &lt;em&gt;maybe not&lt;/em&gt;.<br /><br />Nothing's that simple though, so I'll lay out some of my thoughts on the subject, but first a little about myself so you know where I'm coming from:<br /><br />I loved music since I was a kid pounding on the piano in our living room- I think I did some serious damage to that thing.

Still, I always had reservations about the actual &quot;value&quot; of the experience, which some anonymous soul tried to sum up by scribbling &quot;Music School Diploma&quot; on a campus bathroom paper towel dispenser.<br /><br />These days I write/play/produce instrumental jazz-funk music, and I often wonder about how things would be different if I hadn't gone to music school. Without further ado, here is what I think:<br /><br />&lt;u&gt;Reasons to &lt;em&gt;skip&lt;/em&gt; music school:&lt;/u&gt;<br /><br />1. Ironically, Peabody is quick to include people like Tori Amos in their lists of distinguished alumni. The ironic part is that she dropped out. Tori was a young classical piano student before she bolted: I think she probably figured that while education can add a lot to music, good music transcends those kinds of nuts and bolts. If people like what you are doing, you're already there. Also, no one cares if you have a degree when deciding if they like your music.<br /><br />2. For people writing new music: formal music education, for some, curbs their ability to think &quot;out of the box&quot; in terms of unique creation. It's tough to avoid having all that stuff you learn change the way you think about music. Often this is good, but for some, it can actually be limiting.<br /><br />3. This one is really about music as a career. The music industry is in a state of flux. Music sales are going down as internet streaming goes up. That, plus the difficult economy, make music a difficult business to be in. Are you sure you don't want to learn some other, more marketable skill?<br /><br />&lt;u&gt;Reasons to &lt;em&gt;attend&lt;/em&gt; music school:&lt;/u&gt;<br /><br />1. Because you want to teach music at a level where having a degree is required. That one's pretty straight forward. This doesn't apply to things like teaching piano to kids in your home, more like teaching music in some type of school.<br /><br />2. You are a classical musician, and not the kind who was already being signed to record deals as a 14-year-old prodigy. A lot of people are in schools like Julliard and Peabody, improving their skills in hopes of the endpoint of auditioning for something (like an orchestra). Note- the endpoint for them isn't the degree, it's the audition. Note: if you are in this group, you may need to figure out ways to supplement your income at some point, and reason #1 (ability to teach) could be helpful.<br /><br />3. To learn specific skills that are hard to learn other places. There are some great schools that really focus on today's new music environment (Berklee and Oberlin come to mind), as opposed to the more traditional schools. Learning skills like music production will put you miles ahead of the throngs of people using software like Garage Band at home.<br /><br />4. Music school actually teaches some really important life skills (I'm serious), and graduate programs from medicine to law look at music school majors who were serious about their craft as people who know dedication and time management. This is surprising but true. Trust me, I know about this one first hand. Don't get me wrong, you still need to have all the requirements for whatever field you are leaving professional music for, but your music background makes you perceived as &quot;interesting and well-rounded.&quot;<br /><br />5.
