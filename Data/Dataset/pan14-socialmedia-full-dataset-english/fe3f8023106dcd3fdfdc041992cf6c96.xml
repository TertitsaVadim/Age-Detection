<br />Study also reveals that the overall functionality and efficiency of led bar strip light is far better as compared to that of the normal bulbs<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovLyBodHRwOi8vd3d3LmdlcnVpLWxlZC5jb20v" target="_blank"> led bar strip lamps manufacturer </a>. In case of normal bulbs, you may often come across a situation where the bulb simply blows off due to over usage or voltage fluctuations. However, this is not the case with led bar strip lamps manufacturer.

These are the light strip and a light controller. All the systems of such led bar strip lamps manufacturer cannot be used without a light controller involved in it. Such a light control allows you to determine the colors that have been displayed. LED controller is also responsible for creating the different types of effects that can be achieved with it. Simple controllers are having a set of colors that is predefined and fixed in the type of a pre-programmed sequence.
<br />After the decision of the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovLyBodHRwOi8vd3d3LmdlcnVpLWxlZC5jb20v" target="_blank"> led bar strip lamps wholesale </a>, you have to carefully understand the technical details and you should not miss any one of them. Some of these details are discussed here. This type of lightning system is not used to be operated on main voltage source; it is designed for low voltage. LEDs are in need of special transformers which are designed for them so make sure you use the perfect things for your LEDs.
<br />China LED lighting are used extensively for the household and commercial purposes. They have been employed at different locations to enlighten the edges of a furniture piece and they can provide walls with an excellent look and a touch of a color. Steps, staircases and other audio visual systems can be easily illuminated by their use and they also look very decent and attractive apart from serving the decorative purpose they provide you a good amount <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovLyBodHRwOi8vd3d3LmdlcnVpLWxlZC5jb20v" target="_blank"> China LED lighting </a>of light enabling you for a better viewing of things.

I'm going to show you how easy it can be to add some nice DIY accent lightning using simple  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovLyBodHRwOi8vd3d3LmdlcnVpLWxlZC5jb20v" target="_blank"> led bar strip lamps manufacturer </a>
<br /><br />. There are so many places that can be benefited with some extra lighting: underneath kitchen cabinets, around crown molding trim in your theater or study, or even on the front of the reception desk below.
<br />The power supply that we are using is manufactured by the company that makes the LED strips we're using and is designed specifically for the strips we are using. As you can see in this picture it is a 12V 18W supply with a 3 wire input. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovLyBodHRwOi8vd3d3LmdlcnVpLWxlZC5jb20v" target="_blank"> led bar strip lamps wholesale </a>Those three wires are the standard AC power connections you find in most homesled bar strip lamps wholesale (at least in the U.S.). Those lines are ground, live (or hot), and neutral. It then has a standard 2 wire 12V DC output on the other side.
<br />What we need for this set up is a 3 Prong AC power cable that you don't need for something else. I used the standard AC power cable that is commonly used with computers and monitors. We will be cutting the end of the cable off and soldering it to our power adapter, so make sure you won't need this cable for anything else.
<br />Using the wire stripper, cut through the outer molding of the wire. You will want to give yourself enough length of wire that it is easy to work with<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovLyBodHRwOi8vd3d3LmdlcnVpLWxlZC5jb20v" target="_blank"> China LED lighting </a>, but not too much as you'll need to be able to cover it back up. In this example I cut off about 2 1/2 inches of the casing  led bar strip lamps manufacturer.
<br />The wires will generally be twisted around each other. Simply, untwist the wires and separate them so that you have easy access to them.

<br /><br />The lengths of LED strip: Please pay attention that LED strip can be cut each 3 LEDs. For 60 LEDs/m LED strip, the length per set is 50mm, if 30 LEDs/m, then the length per set is 10mm. With this knowLEDge, you can calculate the quantity of LED to be used practically in the project. Generally one meter more LED strip is for special use.
<br /><br />Controller for LED strip; For RGB led bar strip lamps manufacturer,only when using controller can fully demonstrate its effect. While one controller can control 5m to 20m LED strips. So the purchase of controller or amp is depending on how long Flexible LED strips do you want to control, do not think only one controller can meet all the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovLyBodHRwOi8vd3d3LmdlcnVpLWxlZC5jb20v" target="_blank"> led bar strip lamps wholesale </a>control requirements of RGB LED strips, this is a wrong idea.
<br /><br />Lack of completely understanding of SMD LED strip, many clients will miss some details when calculating the cost, the result is to increase some unnecessary costs. Below is a good example for how to calculate the cost of engineering and installation if China LED lighting.
<br /><br />The constant current of <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovLyBodHRwOi8vd3d3LmdlcnVpLWxlZC5jb20v" target="_blank"> China LED lighting </a> is used to be 20mA, so the current supplied by the power can not be higher than 20mA. Many friends pay attention to voltage in operation but seldom pay attention to current, this will lead the LED have danger to get burnt when current is higher than required.
