<br />Founder of Missionaries of Charity
<br /><br />Mother Teresa the 'angel of mercy' dedicated herself to the service of mankind and served god amongst the poorest of the poor, sick and the dying for more than 50 years of her life.
<br /><br />Teresa was born as Agnes Gonxha Bojaxhin on 26th August 1910 in Skopje, now the capital of Macedonia to Albanian parents. She was the youngest of three children. Exposed early to prayer and service, she was deeply religious. At the age of 18, she left home for Dublin, Ireland, to join the Loretto abbey and become a nun of the Roman Catholic church. After her training, she was given the name of Sister Teresa. Sisters of Our Lady of Loreto, were very active in India, doing missionary work. She came to India on January 6, 1929 to become a teacher and was moved at the sight of the crippled and helpless people on the pavements. She taught in St. Mary's convent school in Kolkata for 15 years later on became the headmistress. In 1937, she took her final vows as a nun, in Darjeeling. 
<br /><br />In 1947, on a journey to Darjeeling later referred by her as the most important journey of her life she had a vision or call to leave the convent, to live among the poor and to take care of the sick and the dying, the hungry, the homeless, to be God's Love in action to the poorest of the poor, which was the beginning of the Missionaries of Charity. At first she did not get the permission to leave the convent but in 1948 she got the permission specifically from Pope Pius XIII to leave the the Loreto community and work among the city's poor. She left the convent, took basic training in nursing and went to live in the nearby slum. She wore an inexpensive and simple white sari with a blue border, which became the most recognised symbol of the Sisters of Charity. 
<br /><br />Following one of her former student, others joined her in her mission. In 1948, she opened the first slum school. As the congregation grew she sought approval from the Pope and shifted to 54A Lower Circular Road, which became the Mother House. The Missionaries of charity was officially established as a religious congregation for the Archdiocese of Calcutta in October 1950. The organisation devoted to the working for the destitute, now have thousands of homes and members all over the country and abroad. Calcutta became the center of her humanitarian activities. Her first home was 'Nirmal Hriday' (pure heart) for the sick and the dying, and then ' Shishu Bhavan' for the disabled, orphaned and mentally retarded children, 'Shanti Nagar',  a colony for lepers where they were cared for, they could learn a skill, build their own houses and could work on their own fields, AIDS hospices and so on. The first home outside India was founded in 1965 in Venezuela. Others were later opened in Italy, Tanzania, Australia, US, Communist Cuba, former Soviet Union etc. 
<br /><br />Mother Teresa became an Indian citizen in 1962. She has received many national and international awards in recognition of her noble work for humanity. The first award being Padmashri for distinguished service (1962),  then the Magsaysay Award the same year, Pope John XXIII Peace Prize (1971), Good Samaritan Award (1971), John . F. Kennedy International Award (1971), Jawaharlal Nehru Award for International peace (1972), Nobel Peace Prize (1979), Bharat Ratna (1980),  Rajiv Gandhi Sadbhavana Award (1993) etc. were some of them. 
<br /><br />In 1983, at the age of 72, Mother was diagnosed with a serious heart condition and her health steadily worsened. In 1990, Mother had decided to step down as the  head due to her failing health and so called a conclave of sisters to choose a successor. But in a secret ballot, she was re-elected with one dissenting vote, that was her own. In 1991 she underwent heart surgery and in March 1997, Sister Nirmala a former Hindu converted to Roman Catholic was elected to succeed Mother Teresa as leader of Missionaries of Charity. On September 5, 1997 the 87-year old mother died of severe cardiac arrest at the Missionaries of Charity headquarters in Kolkata.
<br /><br />The late mother taught the world the beauty in giving and left behind an enormous organisation with the will to continue her work. Mother was beatified by Pope John Paul II at St. Peters square in Vatican, on October 19th 2003, seven years after her death. Henceforth the mother will be referred to as the The Blessed Teresa of Kolkata.

<br /><br />Tum na jaane kis jahan mein kho gaye...! Naushad Ali is no more. The man who gave the Indian film industry the whole concept of playback singing as a passionate expression of popular angst died here Friday. He was 87.
<br /><br />Naushad was one of the last lingering legacies of an era when Hindi cinema gained momentum as a vehicle of cultural continuity.
<br /><br />Born in Lucknow in 1919, Naushad was the first and perhaps only music composer of Hindi cinema whose name appeared before the actors of the films. Many film personalities believe Naushad was the star of the films for which he chose to compose music. 
<br /><br />He chose his assignments very carefully. And once he selected a project, Naushad was the undisputed king. Any interference from the producer or any other member of the unit was not just unacceptable but unimaginable.
<br /><br />There is this story of how a producer tried to tell Naushad saab how to do his job. The temperamental composer heard him out and then said, &quot;Why don't you do the music yourself since you know so much about composing?&quot; 
<br /><br />And he walked out. Naushad's knowledge of classical and popular Indian music made him the most eligible candidate for composing immortality. He introduced western-style orchestras in the songs of the epic films of the era. 
<br /><br />K. Asif's &quot;Mughal-E-Azam&quot;, Mehboob Khan's &quot;Mother India&quot; and &quot;Andaz&quot;, Vijay Bhatt's &quot;Baiju Bawra&quot;, Nitin Bose's &quot;Ganga Jumna&quot; and H.S Rawail's &quot;Mere Mehboob&quot; were some of Naushad's most celebrated music scores of the 1950s and 1960s.
<br /><br />Naushad's music was a complete motion-picture experience designed and carved out of the choicest raw material obtainable to musicians. He constantly experimented with his sound and voices. If Mohammad Rafi was his favourite male singer, with Lata Mangeshkar he created some of her most popular melodies initially. 
<br /><br />There's a legendary story of how Naushad made Lata run into the bathroom of the recording studio to sing a portion of the mythic melody &quot;Pyar kiya to darna kya&quot; in &quot;Mughal-E-Azam&quot;.
<br /><br />&quot;That's right,&quot; said Lata. 
<br /><br />Remembering the incident, she said: &quot;In those days there were no recording devices to create an echoic effect. So Naushad saab devised this method of creating an echo in the song. With Naushad saab I did some of my most important work in the earlier phase of my career.&quot; 
<br /><br />&quot;I love &quot;Uthaye ja unke situm&quot; (&quot;Andaz&quot<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/wink.gif" alt=":)" />, &quot;Jaane wale se mulaqat&quot; and &quot;Na milta gham (&quot;Amar&quot<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/wink.gif" alt=":)" />, &quot;Mohe panghat pe nandlal&quot;, &quot;Beqas pe karam&quot; and of course &quot;Pyar kiya to darna kya&quot; in &quot;Mughal-E-Azam&quot;. Then I like Naushad saab's &quot;Dhundo dhundo re sajna&quot; in &quot;Ganga Jumna&quot;. They don't make composers and songs like that any more.&quot;

<br />At 83, no full stops for Dev Anand.
<br /><br />Veteran actor Dev Anand has never known full stops. At 83, he is planning two films in 2007, apart from his much-awaited autobiography.
<br /><br />&quot;It's more than 60 years of my life as a film person. My journey from a wannabe in the streets of Mumbai to the actor, writer, director, producer in the studios - everything... all condensed in one book.&quot;
<br /><br />The words tumble out in an effervescent flow of unstoppable energy. 
<br /><br />&quot;My autobiography is ready for publication. This is a historical moment for me.&quot;
<br /><br />Dev Anand started writing the autobiography some years back. 
<br /><br />&quot;When Baghdad was attacked by the US, I was in New York. Every channel showed the grim news about bombardment. I was at a loose end in my hotel room. That's when I started jotting down my thoughts. 
<br /><br />&quot;Once I started writing I was hooked. The process of writing my book has given me a chance to live my own life. I kept writing in fits and starts until last year when I took it up very seriously. I finally finished the book in a two-month stretch.&quot;
<br /><br />The obvious pride in having done something, which no other Bollywood icon has done, bubbles over. 
<br /><br />&quot;Every line in my book is mine. I haven't got any professional writer to help me and I didn't type it out because I don't know how to type. I've handwritten the entire monumental volume of my thoughts. Since every word has flowed from my mind to my hand and onto paper, I'm as excited as a child. &quot; 
<br /><br />The evergreen star has two titles for his autobiography and will be revealed in consultation with its foreign publishers. 
<br /><br />&quot;Out of my 83 years, 60 years of my active life in the movies is put into this book. And it isn't over yet. It'll only be finished when I'm gone. I've discussed everything from my initial struggle to my family, brothers. 
<br /><br />&quot;It would require six books to chronicle six decades of my career. But that wasn't possible. So I've condensed it all in one book to keep it interesting. After all, I don't want readers to get bored. I want them to feel the same excitement that they do when they watch a movie.&quot;
<br /><br />Will the book hurt any of the people who are mentioned in it? 
<br /><br />&quot;I've been honest in the book. Otherwise I had no business writing my autobiography. But in writing about my life I've made sure not to hurt anyone. I've let certain events in my life be ambiguously dealt with - let people draw their own conclusions. 
<br /><br />&quot;As for those whose names do crop up, I'd expect the world to be sporting enough. In my journey of life there are so many people I've met. I've of course brought them up in my book. But never to hit them below the belt! That's not my style.&quot;
<br /><br />The book should be out in the next few months. 
<br /><br />&quot;And then the publishers would want me to promote it all over the world. This isn't an empty boast... I don't think anyone else has attempted what I've in this book,&quot; he remarked.
<br /><br />As for Dev Anand's plans as a director, he's got two films to be made.
<br /><br />&quot;One is a love story called 'When Heartbeats Are The Same' to be shot in Croatia. It'll be my first film in English - again an experiment. It's a beautiful story of an NRI boy and a Croatian girl. The casting and locations are ready but it's winter in Croatia. So I can only shoot in April-May 2007.&quot; 
<br /><br />In the meanwhile, Dev Anand will be shooting a murder mystery titled &quot;Charge Sheet&quot;, for which he will be casting very soon.

<br />I used to play the tanpura for Rafi saab: Mahendra Kapoor
<br /><br />Neither old age nor the vicissitudes of a long singing career have weakened Mahendra Kapoor's zest for music. The singer who gave us the soulful &quot;Chalo Ek Baar Phir Se&quot; way back in 1963 is now ready with a collection of Sufi songs. 
<br /><br />Even at 72, the voice that took high pitch singing to unmatched levels still has a lot to offer. The affable veteran singer says that his sufiana album is something he wanted to do after he had his full in other genres of singing.
<br /><br />Dwelling at length on his relationship with the legendary playback singer Mohammed Rafi, Kapoor says: &quot;Rafi saab had made it very clear, much before my career hit a high note, that we should not sing together, mainly because of two reasons. One because we shared a guru-chela relationship and there should be no competition between us and secondly because our voices are very similar.&quot;
<br /><br />Kapoor crooned some unforgettable Bollywood chartbusters like &quot;Chalo ek baar phir se&quot; (&quot;Gumraah&quot;, 1963), &quot;Aadha hai chandrama&quot; (&quot;Navrang&quot;, 1959), &quot;Neele gagan ke tale&quot; (&quot;Humraaz&quot;, 1967) and &quot;Laakhon hai yahan dilwale&quot; (&quot;Kismat&quot;, 1968).
<br /><br />Even today, he has a music teacher who comes to his Carter Road residence in Bandra in central Mumbai twice a week. 
<br /><br />The Amritsar-born singer, who began his career with &quot;Madmast&quot; (1953) is genial enough to sing a couple of lines of that lilting Sahir Ludhianvi gem &quot;Aap Aye to Khayal-e-Dil-e-Nashaad Aaya&quot; without the airs of a veteran for this correspondent. 
<br /><br />Excerpts from an exclusive interview with IANS:
<br /><br />Q: How do you feel when you look back at your career?
<br /><br />A: Satisfied is what I would like to say. I have done what I always wanted to do as a child. I have sung in almost all genres - classical, qawwali, bhajans, romantic etc. 
<br />I perhaps missed out on sufiana music. So this new album will fulfil that aspect.
<br /><br />Q: Your voice was considered best for high pitched numbers like &quot;Na Munh Chupa Ke Jiyo&quot; and &quot;Neele Gagan Ke Tale&quot;...
<br /><br />A: It is goddess Saraswati's gift and thankfully I could make use of it well in my career. Perhaps that also got me stereotyped as a singer of patriotic songs, making my voice an inseparable ingredient of actors like Manoj Kumar (known as 'Mr.Bharat' for his patriotic flicks) and Sunil Dutt saab. 
<br /><br />Q: Your reverence of Mohammed Rafi and the subsequent initiation into classical music is Bollywood legend. Something on your relationship with the late singer?
<br /><br />A: In simple terms we shared a guru-chela (teacher-student) relationship. I often used to play the tanpura for Rafi saab during his performances. I used to call him Paaji (elder brother in Punjabi) and we used to speak in Punjabi mostly.
<br /><br />Once when we were stepping out of the All India Radio building after a performance and I was holding the tanpura behind him a group of school kids approached him for autograph.
<br /><br />He did not understand and asked me what the fuss was all about. When I told him what the kids wanted he, in a matter of fact manner, asked me to oblige them! And I signed their autographs as Mohammed Rafi! (Laughs) That shows the simplicity of the man. No airs, no arrogance. Just simple human being. 
<br /><br />Q: What about your spat with him in connection with the B.R. Chopra-Yash Chopra clan? Is there any truth to it?
<br /><br />A: There was indeed a spat. But the problem was not between us. It was between Rafi saab and the Chopras where the latter totally ignored Rafi saab after he refused to sing a duet with me in one of their movies. 
<br /><br />Rafi saab had made it very clear much before my career hit a high note that we should not sing together, mainly because of two reasons. One because we shared a guru-chela relationship and there should be no competition between us and secondly because our voices very similar.
<br /><br />Q: Can you pick out favourites in your songs and music directors?
<br /><br />A: In songs perhaps yes. One of my favourites is &quot;Chalo Ek Baar&quot;. I put in a lot of passion while singing it. It is also my favourite because perhaps this was one song that gave me a lot of recognition and a distinct identity. But it is difficult to pick out music directors. It would be an injustice to others.
<br /><br />Q: So can we have a small list of favourites?
<br /><br />A: It's still difficult. All were greats. Naushad saab, C. Ramchandra, Kalyanji-Anandji, (O.P.) Nayyar saab.
<br /><br />Q: You rarely mention Ravi although most of your best songs were his creations and the Ravi-Mahendra Kapoor-B.R. Films combination held sway for a long time... 
<br /><br />A: See this is what happens when I start listing out. It reminds me of the old story where while inviting relatives for a wedding one tends to forget the closest mostly as their presence is considered a 'given'.
<br /><br />In fact I would say nobody understood and made use of my calibre as much as Ravi saab did.

<br /><br />There are always those who excel in something when they put everything into it. That is quite a commendable achievement as most people do not achieve success in their chosen fields or professions. But then, there is also a different category altogether - those who do more than one thing at a time and excel at everything they do. It’s like having a Midas touch - everything you try turns to gold. The world adores such people and it also loves to hate them, in a way. It pokes in some deep recess of every person’s mind that someone exists who loves to do more than one thing and does it well. So while the respect and admiration grows for them openly, they unconsciously or consciously revel in their failure too.
<br /><br />One such person was Kishore Kumar - born as Abhas Kumar Ganguly. When he came to the city of Bombay as young man, his brother Ashok Kumar was quite successful in films. Expectedly, one would say it would have been logical to follow in his footsteps. Though Kishore was all set, there was something that fascinated and interested him a lot more - singing. He was not a trained singer but as some say talent is something you are born with. Though raw, he was great at picking things up like his famous yodeling. In his initial days when no one took him seriously as a singer, he used to imitate the great Saigal Saab until he was made to realize that he needed to develop his own style.
<br /><br />As he started making it as an actor, there were those who believed in his singing capability. One of his earlier breaks was given by Khemchand Prakash and Kishore Kumar did the playback for the film Ziddi. Then a messiah came in the form of S.D. Burman and they both forged a deep bond that lasted for very long. Soon Kishore was regarded as Dev Anand’s voice and did score of films like Munimji, Taxi Driver, Fantoosh, House No. 44 being a couple of them. He also has some timeless classics with Asha Bhonsle like the songs from Chalti Ka Naam Gaadi - all becoming extremely popular.
<br /><br />A score of people were clamoring for Kishore now as they finally stood up and took notice. Big music directors like Laxmikant- Pyarelal and Kalyanji-Anandji started working with him on a regular basis. Kishore Kumar finally got what he wanted.
<br />But that was not all that he wanted. During his lifetime, he sang, acted, directed, produced, wrote - all these getting him commercial and professional attention. He did everything that he wanted to do and because of his take on life, he became one of those special people. Counted amongst the finest singers that Bollywood has seen, one thing that was totally unique about him was that he excelled at singing because of his desire and inner talent, not to mention hard work. This gives inspiration to all those out there who get dissuaded just because they don’t have professional training.
<br /><br />As mentioned before, many people term such gifted people as eccentrics and Kishore was no different. But there was something he taught us all - if you want something bad enough and work hard for it, there is little chance that what others speak is going to affect you. You see, he taught us a lot more than just to listen to his eternal voice.

<br />Kishore Kumar
<br /><br />Date of Birth
<br />4 August 1929, Khandwa, Madhya Pradesh, India 
<br /><br />Date of Death
<br />13 October 1987, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India. (heart attack) 
<br /><br />Birth Name
<br />Abhas Kumar Kunjilal Ganguly 
<br /><br />Height
<br />5' 6&quot; (1.68 m) 
<br /><br />Mini Biography
<br />Abhas Kumar Ganguly was born on August 4, 1979, in Khandwa, now in Madhya Pradesh. His dad's name was Kunjilal, a lawyer by profession, and his mom's name was Gouri Devi, who came from a wealthy family. Kishore was the youngest in the Ganguly family, preceded by Ashok, Sati, &amp; Anoop. Sati was married to Sashadhar Mukherjee, who was the brother of film-maker Subodh Mukherjee, and Bollywood actors Joy &amp; Deb Mukherjee. Sati's son, Shomu, went on to marry Tanuja Samarth, and who subsequently gave birth to Kajol and Tanisha. Tanuja is the sister of Nutan Behl, who, in turn, is the mother of actor Mohnish Behl. Tanuja and Nutan are the daughters of the famed Shobhna Samarth. Sati was also aunt-by-marriage to Ram Mukherjee, who would subsequently marry and give birth to Raja and Bollywood actress, Rani Mukherjee. Ashok's daughter is noted Bollywood actress, Preeti Ganguly, who is married to comedian and character actor, Deven Verma. Ashok's grand-daughter is actress, Anuradha Patel.
<br /><br />While Ashok went on to become a successful actor, Abhas, who was renamed Kishore, shunned acting, and preferred singing and mimicking Kundanlal Saigal. His brother, Anoop, while struggling to make a name himself, noticed this, and encouraged Kishore to sing in his own voice. When Sachin Dev Burman happened to visit Ashok, he heard Kishore singing, and immediately signed him to sing for Bollywood movies. After Sachin's passing away, his son, Rahul took over and openly favored Kishore over other male singers.
<br /><br />He always wanted to be a singer, but acting was thrust upon him, and he did his best to live up to it. A Leo, Kishore was also known for his mad-cap comedy movies, and for his eccentricity as he used to 'talk' to his trees in his home, and having put up a sign 'Mental Hospital' right outside his residence in Khandwa. He was also parsimonious, so much so that he was in arrears to the Indian Income Tax authorities, yet never missed a chance to make fun of them (Aur Peechey Pad Gaya Income Taxum, Jai Govindam Jai Gopalam).
<br /><br />When he refused to endorse former Indian Prime Minister's 20 point Programme during the 1975-1977 Emergency, he was banned from the Government-controlled media namely All India Radio and Vividh Bharati. Even duets with his voice were censored. He was not the only one in Bollywood, as others like Inder Sen Johar, Dev Anand, Shatrughan Sinha openly condemned Mrs. Gandhi's regime.
<br /><br />He refused to lend his voice to Bollywood mega-star Amitabh Bachchan, when the later refused to do a guest appearance in a Kishore-produced film.
<br /><br />His marriages to some of the most popular and attractive Bollywood actresses (Madhubala, Yogeeta Bali, Leena Chandavarkar) not only raised eyebrows, but added to his popularity. He introduced his son, Amit, to sing, often along with him, and then amazed his fans by marrying widowed Leena Chandavarkar, who was just two years older than Amit.
<br /><br />In the comedy 'Badti Ka Naam Dadhi&quot; he included the song 'Karne Chaley Shaadi Meri, Khud Ban Baithey Dulha', sung by Amit in the movie hilariously chastising his dad for getting married, instead of searching for a bride for his son.
<br /><br />Through Leena he sired another son, Sumit. Leena and his marriage was intact until he unexpected passing on October 13, 1987, due to heart failure.
<br /><br />Kishore has not only been immortalized by his songs, but also by his talents as an Actor, Producer, Director, Script-Writer, &amp; Lyricist. His movies continue to be popular even now on TV, as do his songs on both TV and radio.

<br /> Life does get very lonely for me: Alka Yagnik 
<br /><br />Prominent playback singer Alka Yagnik slams rumours about her impending divorce, saying she had been in an unconventional long-distance marriage for years and people could keep speculating. 
<br />&quot;I've been hearing these rumours for years. They don't make a difference to me. As long as my husband and I know what we mean to each other, people's opinions cannot influence our relationship. 
<br /><br />&quot;I spent Diwali with my husband and in-laws in Meghalaya. We've had an unconventional long-distance marriage for years. People can keep speculating,&quot; Alka told IANS.
<br /><br />Alka, who has been in the film industry for 25 years now, admits that being a single working woman in Mumbai has its disadvantages. 
<br /><br />&quot;Life does get very lonely for me, especially after a hard day's work when I return home and there's nobody waiting for me. When people tell me, 'How nice, your life is like one long honeymoon'. I tell them it's not so hunky-dory. I've lived almost my entire married life alone, and so has he. 
<br /><br />&quot;My husband visits me and my daughter in Mumbai. And I often visit his family home in Delhi. But I guess the secret of our togetherness is that we're not together all the time, what with everyone's tolerance level being what it is.&quot;
<br /><br />Alka admits she's an impatient person. &quot;I can't sit in one place. It's too boring.&quot;
<br /><br />Alka's daughter doesn't want to be a singer. 
<br /><br />&quot;She wanted to get into direction ever since she was a child. She will be joining Subhash Ghai's institute Whistling Woods. She's 16, but she has become taller than me. People say she looks like me, so make what you will of that.&quot;
<br /><br />With her surprisingly controlled and emotional renditions in J.P. Dutta's recently released &quot;Umrao Jaan&quot;, about the trials and tribulations of a courtesan, Alka feels she is on the threshold of a new phase in her career. 
<br /><br />&quot;Going by the way things are moving in the music industry I had given up hope of ever getting anything substantial. You know, compared with what one hears these days, I feel the songs I've sung belong to a golden era. 
<br /><br />&quot;I just reduced the volume of work. After 20-25 years of singing I didn't want to just go on singing for a lark. I only wanted to do work that would take me ahead. 'Umrao Jaan' was god-sent&quot;.
<br /><br />Did Alka have Asha Bhosle's renderings for Rekha in &quot;Umrao Jaan&quot; in mind? 
<br /><br />&quot;I belong more to Lataji's school of singing than Ashaji's. Just because Ashaji had sung in the earlier 'Umrao Jaan', I didn't need to be influenced by her. When I was told I was going to be Umrao's voice I was very excited. That they've used only one voice for Aishwarya Rai is very sensible. Normally, we've four different voices singing for the same person. 
<br /><br />&quot;I've sung many beautiful songs for J.P. saab's earlier films, like 'Humen jabse mohabbat ho gayi hai' in 'Border'. Thank god melody lives in his films. Otherwise, this melodious side of me would have suffocated to death.&quot;
<br /><br />Alka confesses she was restless and bored by the songs that she was getting. 
<br /><br />&quot;And if other singers are reaping the harvest that's fine, though I must say many of the new voices sound quite similar to one another. There was a time when I recorded as many as three-four songs a day. If I want I could still do that. But I don't want to be part of the rat race any more. I can't believe I've survived for 25 years.&quot; 
<br /><br />She sighs, &quot;I'm very fortunate to have got everything in life. The one regret that I have is that I lost my dad very early in my life. He was my friend.&quot;
<br /><br />What next? 
<br /><br />&quot;I'm too scared about what will come next. I want to do a raga-based album. As for film songs, I can't lose heart. I'm sure something like 'Umrao Jaan' will come again. I'm also singing for 'Jodha-Akbar' - again For Aishwarya, though I suspect this time the songs will be in the background.&quot; 
<br /><br />She thinks, and says: &quot;When you've someone like Aishwarya putting across your voice your singing gets an added lustre. Lataji's mind-blowing songs got the right faces like Meena Kumari and Madhubala. It makes so much of a difference.&quot;
<br /><br />Alka loves singing duets with all the prevalent voices. 
<br /><br />&quot;When I used to sing with Kumar Sanu I felt he had a lot of romance in his voice. I was always cautious about the romantic aspect to my voice. Sonu Nigam is so well-prepared. And, since he takes so many harkats (raga-curves) in his rendition, music directors ask me to tone down my harkat. 
<br /><br />&quot;You know the male singers tell me they've to be on their toes while singing with me. Udit Narayan actually sings after me. He first listens to what I sing and then sings after me.&quot;
<br /><br />Happy with life, Alka is 40 now. 
<br /><br />&quot;But artists always remain young. Look at Lataji.&quot;

<br /><br />The word music in India means 'Sangeeta', which traditionally meant performing the art of singing,  playing of instruments and dancing.   
<br /><br />Indian classical music originated from Vedic chants or Sama music. This music chiefly consisted of chanting of hymns in praise of the Vedic gods. The musical structure of the chants was characterised by descending order of notes, initially two to five which later was increased to seven notes. Gradually various developments took place and this culminated in the Raga tradition. 
<br /><br />The Raga (structure of melody) and Tala (structure of rhythm) are the two major characteristics of Indian Classical music. The melody deals with the rise and fall of sounds and the latter deals with the pattern of time beats of Ragas. 
<br /><br />Tala is the pulse of Indian music.  The term Tala is derived from the Sanskrit word 'Tal' which means to strike with palms. Early musicians may have employed claps or palm-strokes to mark time in dance and music which later developed into a complicated system of 108 talas of  classical music. It is a time cycle that remains fixed through out a particular rendering.  Tala, binds music together and offer a regularity that calms the mind.
<br /><br />Raga is the basic scale or note-pattern of a melody formed by selecting notes from the thirteen tonal intervals, conventionally established in the octave space. The notes are selected from ascending as well as descending progressions. They are Sa, Re, Ga, Ma, Pa, Dha, Ni in the ascending order and Sa, Ni, Dha, Pa, Ma, Ga, Re, Sa in the descending order. Frameworks, thus provided by the selected notes function as the ground-plan. Musicians can elaborate Ragas on the basis of this plan and create more tonal patterns pleasing to the ears of the listeners. 
<br /><br />Ragas in the South mostly have Sanskrit names, unlike in the North, where their names often comes from specific region or from the dialects of regions. 
<br /><br />Tala and raga varies in each composition. Sometimes Tala is more active and controls the other or vise versa. This depends on the person performing the music.
<br /><br />Music is a universal art. The two cultures of the south and the north gave rise to the two modes of singing-Uttaradi and Dakshinadi or Hindustani and Karnatic. 
<br /><br />North Indian Music offers a variety of forms of music like the Dhruvapada, Khyal, Thumari, Tappa and Ghazal. The dhruvapada is a strictly classical and a slow form. The khyal incorporates into this rigidity, the romanticism of yet another form, the thumari. All these forms follow the same basic tenets of the raga-tala system. The thumari is used quite extensively to accompany the dance Kathak. This is because it incorporates a high degree of emotional and aesthetic content, from the bottom of the heart. The tappa is a lighter form of classical music that is brisk and replete with a variety of phrases, which makes it particularly difficult to render without a good degree of virtuosity.
<br /><br />North Indian music has a wide range of ancient and beautiful instruments, each having a tone quite unique. Some of the more well known are the sitar, the sarod, the rudraveena, the santoor, the flute, the shehnai and the sarangi. Among the percussion instruments are the tabla and the pakhawaj. The tabla is used as an accompaniment to most music recitals. The pakhawaj has a deeper tone than the tabla.
<br /><br />Karnatic music has a deeper understanding of 'notal' values and their inter-relations. The musician of the south adheres very firmly to the tala cycle. Karnatic music is rigid and deeply spiritual.  Thus, taste for Karnatic music has to be cultivated. The dominant element of Karnatic music is  the 'Kriti'; a form of composition with three parts. The literary content of the Kritis or songs, are in the form of offerings.  
<br /><br />The three great composers known as the trinity of Karnatic music are Shyama Sastry, Thyagaraja and Muthuswamy Dikshitar. Tyagaraja is the most popular among them. The music compositions, 'Tyagaraja Gana', 'Valmikiya Kavana' and 'Agumbeya Astamaya' are said to be unique for enrapturing the human heart.  The flute, the violin, the veena, the nadaswaram and the gottuvadyam are among the most well known South Indian instruments.

<br /><br />Roses, popularly known as the queen of flowers look beautiful and spread fragrance in any garden. This regal flowering shrub valued mainly for the colour and fragrance of their flowers, has about 150 species. Many thousands of cultivars have been developed from these species through cross breeding, selection and hybridization and they vary widely from miniatures under a foot tall to climbing types that climb up to 50 feet.  
<br /><br />Roses considered as the flowers of love has  inspired artists, writers and composers for centuries. It was the Greek poet Sappho who coined the title 'Queen' to the flower over 2500 years ago. In the early Roman culture, Roses were a part of upper class life. The decorations for parties, weddings, funerals, festivals and on statues and monuments, chariots and shields were adorned with roses. People would bathe in rose water, wear rose garlands, make confections and wine with rose petals. Even medications were prepared from rose petals, fruits (hips) and seeds. The most important rose collection of the early 19th century was Of Empress Josephine, wife of Napoleon 1 of France, in her famous garden at the imperial chateau Malmaison with over 250 varieties of roses. The flower had significance as a symbol in the early Christian Church. The 'rosary' of the Christians originated from the Latin word 'rosarium' meaning rose garden. 
<br /><br />The cultivars can be divided into Old Garden and Modern roses and these into several well recognized sub groups. In a garden, roses can be planted as borders, hedges, backgrounds, specimen plants- in short, in virtually any role that other shrubs can play. They can be planted not only in the open ground but in containers and raised beds on your verandah,  terrace or balcony. If  planted in the right way you can enjoy watching your roses bloom year after year.

<br /><br />Those superstitious types who freaked out last year when the calendar read 06/06/06 will have something to smile about on the 7th day of the 7th month, 2007. 
<br /><br />Believing the triple appearance of the number 7 will bring luck, many people are planning important events for this first Saturday in July. Brides and grooms, especially, looking for a little extra dose of marital fortune, are flocking to the altar in droves on 07/07/07, according to wedding watchers. 
<br /><br />If they only knew what the Chinese were thinking. 
<br /><br />The number seven is considered lucky due to its frequent and favorable appearance in the Bible, say historians. 
<br /><br />&quot;As the number of the days of God's first week, of the levels of heaven...of the numbers of angels and trumpets, etc., the number came in the last few centuries BCE to represent divine perfection,&quot; said David Frankfurter, professor of religious studies and history at the University of New Hampshire. &quot;Something organized seven-fold meant that it corresponded to God's own arrangement.&quot; 
<br /><br />Numbers control our fate? 
<br /><br />Just as some people wouldn't dare get married on a Friday the 13th or live in a house with the address 666, believing in the positive influence of the number seven is just another technique humans use to have some jurisdiction over the chaotic world around them, said Frankfurter. 
<br /><br />“In our modern American society we have a tendency to look for magical ways to control the world or fate, so numerology is especially important for us,” Frankfurter said. 
<br /><br />The obsession with numerology—and other para-sciences like astrology—tends to get stronger especially during significant life events like marriages, he added. &quot;It represents Americans' rather weak (compared to Asian cultures') attempt to exert some numerical or calendrical control over important life-cycle, transition, or other crisis situations,&quot; Frankfurter told LiveScience. 
<br /><br />Seven not lonely in luck 
<br /><br />Trying to find meaning in numbers is a practice that goes back to ancient times, say historians, and doesn't begin and end with 6, 7 and 13. 
<br /><br />There are many other numbers in the Bible that were thought to have sacred meanings, said Frankfurter, including twelve (for the tribes of Israel and the zodiac), five (books of Moses) and four (archangels, gospels). 
<br /><br />Lucky numbers also vary from culture to culture, proving, skeptics say, that coincidental connections between an event and the influence of a number can always be found if you're looking hard enough, no matter what the digit. 
<br /><br />Chinese culture, for example, associates &quot;degrees&quot; of luck according to how a number is pronounced. Eight, whose Chinese name rhymes with the words for prosperity and wealth, is considered particularly auspicious. The Beijing Olympics, as a result, will open next year at 8 p.m. on Aug. 8, 2008. 
<br /><br />Oh, and many Chinese consider 7 a very unlucky number associated with death. Don’t tell the brides.

<br /><br />Why I prefer Mrs. Pratibha rather than Dr. Kalam
<br /><br />It is quiet funny to read many articles and polls of the so called educated and young people in india, rising many reasons to continue Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam as the president of India for the next 5 years. Tiger agree, Dr. Kalam is a great man dreaming a developed india, he is a great scientist and above all, he is very good in motivating Indian youth. You may ask why I am saying it’s funny then, I will explain to you the reason. Before that, can you give any solid reason other than the “smoke” why you want Kalam to continue?. 
<br /><br />In your village there will be very nice person, may be the Vicar or a Poojari or a Musliar, they will be best in their assigned work, but if you want to drive a car from Calicut to Mumbai, you wont select this persons, the experience in driving is the matter there. Vicar is good when he is doing church related work, for driving, there are people more suitable than vicar, and we have to consider a vicar only when there is no other option. In same way if one lead the missile project or nuclear project, it shows, he is very good in that field. Also we have to give all support to continue him in that way and in the present world that has a great importance. The post of President of Republic of India is not meant to give as a “reward” for the good deeds of a person. But those who hold that glorious post should have experience in Indian politics.
<br /><br />According to Indian constitution the power of the president is like “a huge tree, but no place even for a bird to sit”. President has the supreme power in india but can do nothing different from what the cabinet insists. The parlement will pass some bill, and the president is supposed to sign over it, thats it - Yes the rubber stamp. President can return the file to review but if the cabinet forward the same file again, it is the rare of the rarest case that, a president will reject it to review again.
<br /><br />Kalam also did almost same as what his predecessor did. But he was successful to make common people think that he did something great. All are prising Kalam like ” Beeran-ammad saw the fox: beeran-ammad will tell you there are 100s of foxes, then if you ask where ?, he will tell oh not 100 but one or two and finally if you ask again he will answer sorry that’s not fox at all, but “just the sound of dried leaves”. The words of those who know nothing about the politicas of india (if they don’t have any other hidden ajendas), about Kalam is not very different from this.
<br /><br />Now, about Mrs. PRATIBHA PATIL: Many are saying she is unknown, but they should know one thing, she is unknown to the public because she never involved in any Scandal or Bribery.Those who know a little bit of indian politicas know how bold Pratibha is, I can tell you some of many examples - In the male dominated india it is not easy for a female to reach powerful posts in india like Chief minister, It is a publicized secret that, Prathibha lost the Chief Minister post of Maharastra only because of some political game played by some circles of Indira Gandhi, while she was the most suitable and expected person for that position. Her performance, as the opposition leader in Maharastra Legislative assembly was excellent, and the most famous one, that made every secular indian remember Pratibha as a powerfull leader, is her rejection of the “ban on Conversion bill” of Rajasthan Assembly when she was the Governor of Rajastan, which shows us the secular person in Prathibha. Also, she was the deputy chair person of Rajya Sabha, when Kalam was experimenting with micriscope and tellescope. Above all she is running many relief foundations both inside and outside Rajasthan, hence she knows the heart beat of poor India very well. 
<br /><br />However, unfortunately, since Pratibha is not so interested in making money illegally, she could not involve in any corruption case. If there is not even a single petti case against a person, how one can be famous in india ?. 
<br /><br />If a you say Dr.Kalam did many things, tiger is happy with the presidential candidature of Prathibha Patil, bacause, if a person like Kalam who doesn’t have any political experience before, can do the things you are saying(if any), Prathibha, the one with more than a quarter centurey of active, clean, faithful, political experience, can do much more than that. Furthermore, a politician can perform well in improving forign relations than a scientist. That is the most importent for us in the present India.
<br /><br />Tiger want to see an India with all it’s citizens above poverty line, rather than having missile launch station and nuclear weapons in every Panchayath. Tiger prefer “wings of peace” rather than “wings of fire”.
<br /><br />–Thoughts of tigersamachar is always different from others, that’s why tigersamachar is not one among many, but a special one. Tiger is happy to see your comments and suggestions. you can either comment in comments section just below this sentence, or send your concerns to “<a href="/go/messages/send/receiver=paradooshanam@yahoo.com">paradooshanam@yahoo.com</a>

<br /><br />Chandra Shekhar breathed his last at 8:45 am at the Apollo Hospital here where he was admitted for the last three months, a doctor attending on him said. 
<br /><br />Former Prime Minister Chandra Shekhar, a socialist who strongly opposed policies of liberalisation and personality politics and headed a minority government at the Centre for a brief while, died here today after a prolonged battle with cancer of the blood.
<br />   He had turned 80 exactly a week ago and is survived by two sons. He died at the Apollo Hospital where he was admitted three months ago.
<br />   &quot;He was suffering from multiple myloma (blood disease), said Dr Rakesh Chopra, senior consultant (oncology), who was attending on him.
<br />   Condoling his death, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh described him as a truly secular nationalist who was committed to people's welfare and national development.
<br />   The Congress and BJP also condoled his death, saying his death was a huge loss.
<br />   Chandra Shekhar, who was elected to the Lok Sabha for the eight term in the 2004 elections, served as Prime Minister for a brief period between November 10, 1990 and March 6, 1991. He had served one term in Rajya Sabha to which he was elected in 1962.
<br />   Known for courage of conviction and sticking to principles, the socialist veteran held no no office before he split with V P Singh and floated a rebel outfit Janata Dal (Socialist) at the height of anti-reservation agitation in 1990 and formed a weak minority government with outside support of Congress headed then by the late Rajiv Gandhi.
<br />   His government was short-lived when the Congress decided to withdraw support in the wake of controversy over spotting of two intelligence operatives outside 10, Janpath in the capital which the Congress felt was an attempt to snoop on Gandhi. 
<br />   Chandra Shekhar resigned on the floor of the House when the motion of thanks to the President's address came under the threat of defeat from Congress.
<br />   A veteran of the socialist vintage, he was brought into politics by Acharya Narendra Dev. He joined the Praja Socialist Party in the early fifties before he joined Congress in 1965 where he effectively pleaded for policies in support of the downtrodden.
<br />   He headed a ginger group of 'Young Turks' and opposed big monopolies and industrialist groups for whom he would not not like government concessions.
<br />   Called an &quot;angry&quot; young turk he was put behind the bars by her party leader the late Indira Gandhi during the infamous emergency in 1975 for his blunt views and when he came out of it in 1977 new political equations emerged and the Congress was defeated.
<br />   Chandra Shekhar kept out of power in 1977 when the Janata Party dispensation swept the polls and he took over as its President. Even after the split in 1980, he continued to be its President till he merged it with Janata Dal in 1989.
<br />   After the break with V P Singh, he formed the Samajwadi Janata Party, which for a brief while reunited with Janata Dal, but went back to its original shape and was headed by him till the end.
<br />   The late former Prime Minister did not not shy away from controversies  and had famously said it was an inspector's job to get at the truth in the Bofors scam and not not that of the Prime Minister.

<br /><br />Indian Rotis and Pilaus, Indian Cooking, Indian Culinary Traditions, Mughlai Rumali Roti, Tandoori Roti, Dal Makhani, Raitas, Tandoori Chicken, Puranpoli, Makai Ki Roti, Lassi, Pachadis, Papads, Kormas, Nargisi Kofta, 
<br />--------------------------------------------
<br /><br />Authentic Indian food ranks with French and Chinese cuisine as one of the great culinary traditions of the world. Reflecting many different cultures in its tremendous diversity, Indian food ranges from exquisitely simple vegetarian dishes to full-flavoured meat, chicken and fish concoctions made with dozens of ingredients. Each region has its own specialties inspired by race, religion, history and geography and each restaurant and housewife adds an individual touch.
<br /><br />The secret of fine Indian cooking is the inspired use of spices. Far from always being chilli-hot, Indian sauces are blended to complement the main ingredient.
<br /><br />Rotis and Pilaus
<br />Cereals are the staple of very Indian meal. Here again the variety is staggering. Among the many different rotis (unleavened breads), chapattis are the most common. Like their cousins the handkerchief-thin rumali roti, they are cooked on a griddle. Others are oven-baked, like the fluffy rectangular nan and the simpler tandoori roti. Then there is the array of fried parathas, puris and baturas, some of them stuffed with vegetables or meat. Most rotis are made of various combinations of refined and wholemeal wheatflour, although ground gram (chickpeas) is used for the delicious puranpoli of Maharashtra and Gujarat, maize, for the makai ki roti popular in rural Punjab, millet for the hearty bajara ki roti found in most villages, and ground rice for the other varieties, especially on the west coast.
<br /><br />Rice is cooked in many different ways. Simple steamed rice usually accompanies spiced, soupy main dishes. More elaborate variations include coconut, lemon and tamarind rice, frequently served in the south. Then there are the pilaus (pilaf), rice cooked in a rich, spiced chicken or meat broth, considered in north India to be the last of a fine chef. The king of rice dishes, however, is biriyani, a fragrant, layered rice and meat extravaganza characteristic of the Mughlai cuisine of North India and of Hyderabad in southern India, once a Mughal province.
<br /><br />A common accompanying to most Indian meals is dal, or lentils, valuable for their high protein content. Dozens of different kinds, innumerable methods of preparation and a wide range of accompanying ingredients create a bewildering variety. There is the thick tamarind-flavoured sambhar from the south, the slightly sweet dals of Gujarat and the thick dal makahani of the north.
<br /><br />Among the daily products used Indian cuisine, ghee, clarified butter, is a traditional cooking medium with a unique full flavour. Rising prices have now restricted its use to special occasions. Yoghurt, known as dahi or crud, integral to Indian meals, is used as a marinade, as a tangy base for rich sauces, and is also served to counter rich or spicy food. It is sometimes lightly spiced and mixed with vegetables or fruit to create the soothing raitas of the north and the pachadis of the south. Churned and salted or sweetened dahi also makes a refreshing summer drink called Lassi. Paneer, similar to cottage cheese, is a favourite source of protein among vegetarians in the north.
<br /><br />A selection of pickles and chutneys - sour, hot and sweet - accompanies every meal. Chosen to complement the main course, they stimulate the appetite and aid digestion. Mango and lime are common pickle bases, while fresh mint, coriander, ginger and coconut are also used. Sweet chutneys of mango and tomato are often served. Papads, roasted or deep-fried savoury crisps, accompany meals in all parts of the country. Usually made of rolled and dried rice or lentil dough, they have a delightful crunchiness.
<br /><br />Vegetarian Delights
<br />India's large vegetarian community has inspired its chefs to develop a highly sophisticated vegetarian cuisine. 'Pure' vegetarian food is usually cooked without the otherwise ubiquitous garlic, ginger and onions. 'Heating' or stimulating spices like cloves, cardamom and cinnamon are also excluded. Gujarati vegetarian food, served in many restaurants, it presented in the form of a thali, a circular metal tray holding numerous small bowls (katoris) filled with a delectable variety of vegetables, dal and kadi, a mixture of curd and chickpeas. The use of gur or jaggery (brown sugar) in Gujarati cooking adds an interesting hint of sweetness and distinguishes it from food in other parts of the country. Aam rasa, pureed mango, appears on menus in summer and is eaten with the puris (deep-fried puffed bread) that are always placed in the middle of the thali next to a small mound of rice. Papads (or pappadums, lentil flour crisps) round off the meal.
<br /><br />South Indian food, also predominantly vegetarian, is popular throughout India for its zesty flavours and generally low cost. The crisp, paper-thin, pancake-like dosa, served plain or stuffed with lightly spiced potatoes, steamed idli ad deep-fried doughnut-shaped vadas are served together piping hot with a mustardy sambhar and a more bland but equally delicious coconut chutney. Dosa, idli and vadas, a popular breakfast combination, are all made of a slightly fermented rice and lentil batter. Upma, crumbly semolina cooked with curry leaves and garnished with nuts, is another southern favourite. Less well known but equally delicious are dishes like the thick avial stew of Kerala, cooked in coconut oil; kaottu, in a coconut and chickpea sauce; and rasam, a thin peppery soup, all served with mound of rice saturated with ghee.
<br /><br />The vegetarian food of North India derives from the lightly spiced dishes of Varanasi. Many specialities are based on paneer (cottage cheese), which may be cooked with spinach (palak paneer), in a gravy with peas (matter paneer) or with lotus seeds (paneer phoolmakhana). A typical farmer's meal in the north would consist of parathas stuffed with potatoes, cauliflower or horseradish eaten with dahi (curd) or mustard greens (sarson ka saag) and cornmeal bread.
<br /><br />Mughlai Magic
<br />Several of India's famous meat dishes come from the north where Muslim influence introduced considerable sophistication. The superb Mughlai cuisine with its luscious sauces of milk, dahi, cream and crushed nuts is available in major restaurants in the big cities. There are rich, creamy kormas; tender, steak-like pasindas in an almond sauce; nargisi kofta, mince (usually mutton) moulded around a hard-boiled egg and simmered in a piquant sauce; the famous do pyaza, cooked with onions; and the succulent raan, a whole leg of mutton marinated overnight and gently roasted until it is butter-soft.
<br /><br />Contributions from Kashmir are culinary triumphs: gaustaba, pounded meat shaped into meatballs and simmered in a yoghurt sauce; haleem, mutton cooked with wheat, milk and curds; deep-fried tabak maas (a Kashmiri meat dish); and the fragrant roghan josh (mutton). Perhaps the most significant innovation, however, is the tandoor, a charcoal-heated clay oven, which produces the magnificent tandoori food now available everywhere: tandoori chicken and fish, boti kababs (chunks of marinated grilled meat), chop-like barra kababs, seekh kababs (spiced mince grilled on a skewer), and its exotic variation, the kakori kabab, which melts in your mouth. With the increased interest in regional food, a huge number of traditional recipes have been revived, many from the kitchens of the former maharajas.
<br /><br />Meat dishes in southern and western India offer a different range of flavours. Coconut-based sauces are common in Kerala and other parts of South India. Vinegar and a liberal use of cinnamon distinguish the food of Goa. Pork sorpotel (cooked with vinegar), spicy vindaloo, chorizo sausages and chicken shakuti or cafreal are wonderful, but often very pungent. Portuguese dishes transformed by local adaptations can be unusual but delicious.
<br /><br />Goa is also famed for its seafood, cooked in creamy but slightly sour coconut sauces, or stuffed with a delicious combination of spices. Elsewhere, seafood recipes very tremendously. There are the mustard-flavoured macher jhol and jhonga malai (cream prawns) of Bengal, the chilli-hot curries of Andhra Pradesh and the coconut and curry-leaf-flavoured specialities of the south and west coast. Dried fish and shrimp, cooked with vegetables and dal, add interest to the simple fare of the coastal villages. The Parsis, eighth-century migrants from Persia, created patrani machi, lightly spiced fish steamed in banana leaves, and saas ni machi, fish cooked in a delicate sauce. Dhansak, meat cooked in a gravy of mixed dals, is another delightful Parsi dish.
<br /><br />Delectable Desserts
<br />Indian desserts are often too sweet for the Western palate. Most are flavoured with cardamom, saffron, essence of rose or kewda flower extract and have a garnish of nuts and a thin layer of edible silver foil. Bengal is particularly famous for its milk-based confections: juicy rasgulla (cream cheese balls); sandesh (Bengali milk sweet); steaming hot gulab jamun (fried cream cheese); rasmalai (cream cheese balls in double cream); and mishti dohi, the delicious caramel-flavoured curd, Kheer, a richer version of rice pudding; shahi tukra, an exotic counterpart of bread pudding; phirni (firnee) made of powdered rice and milk; and kulfi, a delicious nutty ice-cream, are favourite northern sweets. Barfi, milk fudge, plain or enriched with coconut or crushed nuts, is common on festive occasions. Sweets from the south include Mysore pak (sweet-meat with raisins and ghee) and creamy payasum pudding, while both Maharashtrans and Gujaratis are partial to shrikhand, made of drained, sweetened and spiced curd. Crisp golden jelabi, dripping with syrup, available in even the tiniest bazaars, are served piping hot at breakfast and tea time.
<br /><br />A paan is often served at the end of a traditional Indian meal. Paan consists of a betel leaf smeared with catechu (a tannin-rich powder), lime paste (not the fruit) and fragrant essences, wrapped around shredded betel nut, cardamom, aniseed and other ingredients, all secured by a clove pierced through the folds of the leaf. Given the acclaimed digestive properties of the package, it is a perfect and sometimes necessary finale to a rich Indian meal - and definitely and acquired taste.
