As a volunteer, my job was to make a big ‘fried pig’, this stage property would be used in the drama. The pig was made from newspaper and magzine paper. First, we used a big paper box as the basic structure of the big’s body. Next, we kneaded the paper into a lot of paper balls and sticked them around the paper box to make the body become bigger and rounder that it would look like a pig’s body. Then we made many slips of magzine paper and used the glue to stick them onto the round body smoothly. After the body became dry, we painted it into brownish dark red, the fried pig’s color. The body was finished, so we started to make the pig’s head. The head was also made of paper, we used two thick long slips of paper to make the basic structure of a ball----the shape of the head. Then we filled paper balls into the model and made it become a solid ball. After that we added the nose and the ears onto the head, and fixed it onto the body, the ‘fried pig’ is done!

<br />During this volunteer work, I learned a lot. I knew we must make a plan before we start to do the work., and cooperation is very important in a group work.. When everyone in a group work together, the efficiency is much higher than only one do the work.. I made the pig with 3 or 4 people and we finished it quickly and I don’t think I can do it by myself, because I only have two hands.
<br /><br />Before, I thought making a play is very easy, but now I understand, it is a very tough work that a lot of people must work together and think of creative ideas. Before I thought there were many people in a play, but now I know there are even more! Not all the people that attended a play will be in the play and show on the stage, that is only a little part of all the participators, more people work behind the curtain.
<br />When we work in a group, each of us must show our good skills and work actively. That we will do better. Being selfish won’t help to do anything. When we work on our own, we can also listen to some good suggestions from others, this can help us make progress.
<br />If I decide to be a volunteer, I must be in charge of my work, although I can’t get any money from this work.However, I can get valuable experience from being a volunteer, I know how I can work better, I know what is my duties, I know how to coorporate with my partners.
<br />Volunteer is a holy job, if there are more volunteers in the society, the world will become more beautiful.

<br /><br />I attended the badminton club of GCA and played badminton twice a weekend. I have got 42 hours totally for my physical activity.
<br /><br />Our club play badminton at Nanjing Normal University from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m. every Saturday afternoon. Each member should pay 20 yuan for each activity. I went there by bike every week.
<br /><br />Playing badminton is a very healthy activity, we can keep fit and have fun in it. Generally, I played badminton with my classmate ---Katherine. She was my good partner, we always play together in the women’s double badminton game and we both played well. At the beginning, when I first went to play badminton, I didn’t play very well. However, I was very hard-working, so I went to practice playing badminton every week. After one month, I had a little progress and I joined the GCA badminton team. On Oct.11 afternoon, I went to a badminton competition at Nanjing Internatinal School. We must play in double and my partner was Edward, he was my good friend and he played badminton very well. Although I played better than before, I still played not very well in the team. Because of me, we did the worst in the team. I felt very sorry to him but he said, “That’s OK. We are still good friends.” From that day, he started training me to play badminton and I played better and better. On Dec.14, we had another badminton game against Nanjing International School and this time we must play in single. I tried my best in the game, and after the game I found I was the only girl who winned one game. At that time, I felt very happy.
<br /><br />After I played badminton, I found I am good at this sport. I am one of the tallest girl in the team, that is an advantage to play badminton. In addition, I am interested in badminton and I am hard-working. Because of this, I think I can be a good badminton player.
<br /><br />During the badminton club activity, I knew many people from GCA and made friend with them. I played with many of them and improved my skills. One day, our chairperson’s friend Yang jian, a badminton coach, went to our sports hall to teach us some important skills. After that, our P.E. teacher Mr.Harris trained katherine and me how to hit the bird back in normal way. I learned a lot from that night.
<br /><br />I can keep fit during plaing badminton and become stronger. Because of playing badminton, I hardly get sick now. At present, I played badminton much better than before and I am the member of GCA badminton team who have the experience in the badminton competition. Those are very good for my university life in the future. I think I can continue improving my badminton level and become healthier.
<br /><br />Sports match can help us practice more and become healthier. If a person isn’t interested in sports, activity match will help him/her to do more exercise and get fitter. However, if we don’t do any sports generally, we can’t overdo it, that will hurt ourselves.

<br /><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/109821383_2873209_27712637.jpg" />
<br /><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/109821383_14128293_27726575.jpg" />
<br />At first, we watched a popular TV series, “prison break”. Because we only had one hour for each club activity, we only watched the first section. The main character Michael Scofield was very smart and he planned to get into the prison in order to save his innocent brother. After he was arrested, he usually walked around inside the prison and made a map of it. During this process, he overcame a lot of challenges with using his wisdom. The love between Michael and his brother is valuable and impressive.
<br /><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/109821383_13953475_27712672.jpg" />
<br /><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/109821383_1463847_27712711.jpg" />
<br />The second time, we watched a funny cartoon movie---”Kung Fu Panda”. In the story, there was a lazy panda which loved eating very much but was also interested in Kung Fu. It found the principle of Kung Fu from his father---“The secret ingredient of my secret ingredient soup is...nothing. To make something special, you just have to believe it’s special.” That’s true, there is no principle at all. If we want to get better, just believe in our ability and believe we can do it.
<br /><br />Watching good movies and TV series can help us find the truth that the movie has told us and improve ourselves. Also, we can relax and enjoy the pleasure during watching movies. At present, movies and TV series are entering our life, watching movies is becoming an important part of our life. More and more people are affected by the movies, students are also one part of them, so watching movies is important for us. After a whole day’s study, TV Series Club can help its members to relax and have fun. In addition, we always watch English movies and this will help train our English ear. It will become easier to talk to our foreign teachers. Now I have been to the club activity several times and I can understand almost every word that the characters said. I think watching English movie is the quickest and easiest way for our students to train our ear, and the most fantastic thing is that we can also have fun in it.
<br /><br />During the activities of TV Series Club, I found that when we are watching movies or TV Series, we must be quiet and share our opinions afterwards. We should respect the other students who are watching movies that we will mix in easily.
<br /><br />In the club, I knew many new friends who I don’t know before. Participating the activities helped us know each other quickly and we also learned what fairness is. Every time when we had club meeting, we would discuss together and decided which movie we should watch. That is fair for each of us. “The minority is subordinate to the majority.” In this way, no one would feel unfair and get angry. Voting is a good method to make harmony and reduce quarrel.
<br />School club or organization is an important part of our school life, it can make our boring life become more colorful and meaningful. Let’s enjoy it.
<br /><br />Last year, I attended designing club and my work was to make the christmas tree. Joy had already make a metal construction of the huge christmas tree, the things I needed to do was to cut the big green cloth into circles and set these circles onto the construction. Then Joy put some cotton on the edges of each circle to make the snow. A beautiful christmas tree was done!
<br />It’s my first time to make decoration for GCA, and I have done well. Everytime when I saw the tree, I was very proud. During the designing club activity, I had a lot of new friends. It's my greatest gain.

<br /><br />I was a stage backdrop artist in GCA Third Annual Fashion Show, and I got 5 hours of volunteer work intotal for doing this.
<br />I stayed at school after class and did volunteer work everyday for a whole week. My duty was to design the font and draw them out, sometimes I even need to paint the letters and cut them. Someone said volunteer work was boring, but I don’t think so. I have found a lot of fun in it. I think I have a great talent in designing and drawing, I had much interest in them since I was very young, so when Joy from Grade 11 asked me to make the christmas tree in the end of last year, I agreed immediately, and several days ago when she came again and asked me to make the stage backdrop, I was also willing to do. First, we measured the cloth which we would change it into a backdrop and decided a suitable length and width for it to be a wonderful curtain. Then, we went to the shop and bought several pieces of big colourful paper to make the letters on the curtain. After that, we started to make the backdrop. The other two designers were thinking for a speacial font of the 3 biggest letters ”GCA” and they also asked me for advice, I thought for a while and came out with a great idea--- made the letters angular and have different width in different part. I quickly drew them out and they all loved the font very much. The other letters “FASHION SHOW” were designed by a certain teacher, I drew some of the letters and painted them.
<br />When I saw the backdrop on April 27, the FASHION SHOW, I was so excited that the beautiful curtain was made by me. I was too proud to control myself not to say to others , “Look! that wonderful stage backdrop was made by me”. I thought it was a sense of accomplishment, it is very important in working. When we finish our work and the work is done well, we will be very proud of ourselves. That will make us have more motivations to do work well. I think doing volunteer work is very useful in our future life, it is the best way to experience what taking a job is like and what will we be resbonsible in.
<br />I also did volunteer work as a typist and I got 5 hours volunteer time for it. Consider to the work I got in Fashion Show, it was much more boring. The only thing I did was to sit in front of the computer and do the typing work. Before staring, I thought that can help me improve my speed of typing English words. However, I found I was wrong that my job was to type Chinese words, that meaned the work would be tougher and less intersting.. No matter how hard it would be, I had to get my volunteer time, no companies would sign for a strange student who did nothing for them. Of course I finished the boring typing work and got enough volunteer time. It is just like that I was a poor candidate, but I needed $5000 to rent an apartment. I had no work to do but boring typing work which I thought I would never do it, but I had to do it because I need money to find somewhere to live, it’s very important, so I did it and finished work well, then I got enough money. That’s it, sometimes we don’t have any interest in something but we are reasonable to do it, because we can get back profit.

<br /><br />The last day of last year was a special day for me. On that day,drama Snow White directed by me had succeeded in GCA New Year Show(Art Festival). It was memorable for me because it was the first time I acted in formal show in GCA, and I directed this drama by overcoming a lot of challenges.
<br />Our “Snow White” was put on in the NFLS theatre on December 31. Although some of us had made several mistakes, the whole drama was very successful. We all liked it very much. Howevr, only a few people knew how difficult we practised.
<br />At first, our teacher told me to make a performance for the Art Festival because I am in charge of this part in my class. Almost every class prepared singing songs or dances, so I decided to make something speacial. After thinking a lot, I decided to make a drama that had enough roles for my classmates because we needed this in our portfolio and maybe this was the only chance for us. A drama looked better, but a bigger challenge lying in front of me. I chose nearly 2/3 of my classmates to act in Snow White, the more people we have, the more hard rehearse. I divided the actors into 3 groups, each group practised for one day, but I was the director, so I had to stay at school everyday and I usually left school at 9 p.m. I had thought of giving up this drama, but the spirit of perseverance encouraged me not to say I can’t easily. However, our hard work wasn’t useless, Snow White was shown wonderfully that morning, at least I thought it was.

<br /><br />On April 11,2009, I wen to school to learn how to cook Western dessert under Ms. Bartell’s project. Our cooking teacher was Ms. Beath, she was a gentle woman and she taught us very carefully.
<br />I learned a special dessert that day. It was named Bread and Butter Pudding, it was made of 2 eggs, 4 slices of bread (crusts off and buttered), 50g sugar, 300ml milk, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract, 1 teaspoon cinnamon and 50g raisins. First, I cut the bread into fingers,laid them in the bottom of a big glass dish, buttered side up and sprinkle in raisins and continue the layers. Secondly, I beat together the eggs and milk, add the sugar, vanilla extract and cinnamon, stired well and pour over the bread layers until it completely soak the bread. Thirdly, I let them to stand for approximately 1 hour so that bread soaked up all of the flavours. Fourthly, I put them into the microwave oven on medium power for 4-5 mins until it begins to set at the edges. Finally, I left it to cool down for about 5 minutes until it was completely done.
<br />It was the best “little” project in Planning class, I think. We could have fun in it and also we could learn a Western dessert, who can believe it was a homework project! I really enjoyed it and my pudding tasted very nice, at least I like it.

<br /><br />On January 17,2009, I went to Korean singers Super Junior’s music concert in Nanjing Olympic Center with my friends Penny and Edward. This concert was their first Asia tour, so it’s a very meaningful memory.
<br />Super Junior is a famous boy singers group in Asia, all the members are Korean except HanKyung, he is Chinese. They are very hardworking and try their best to practise singing and dancing, that’s the reason why so many people love them. We can find precious spirits on them. They are all excellent youth. Another reason is that all the boy members can sing wonderfully and dance beautifully, also they are extremely handsome in Asian girls’ mind.
<br />I went to their concert for an accident, Penny had two more tickets, so she asked Edward and me to go with her. That was an exciting night, everyone was screaming, I also enjoy the concert very much. When I saw my idol HeeChul dancing on the stage with such a short distance in front of me, I could even feel my blood rushing to my the top of my head. Sometimes I was also screaming with others. I love the concert very much and I enjoyed all the beautiful songs and exciting dances. Super Junior’s concert was extremely different with others because they didn’t use any dancing partners. Everyone on the huge stage was a member of the group, they could dance in coordination with each others. Also. I thought they could dance better than any dancing partners because they all have that talent and they were hardworking. That night was a memorable night that I will never forget.

<br />I worked as a typist and also secretary at the Jiangsu Engineering Consulting Centre for 4 days.
<br /><br />I used my weekends to do the volunteer job. Not like the work I did last year, it has no fun at all. The only thing I did was to sit in front of the computer and do the typing work. Before starting, I thought that can help me improve my speed of typing English words. However, I found I was wrong that my job was to type Chinese words, that meaned the work would be tougher and less intersting.. 
<br />The report I typed was related to the environmental protection. It indicates the problem of the water quality in Xuanwu Lake. For the recent years, the Nanjingers’ domestic sewage was dropped into the lake and pollute the water. Someone pointed out the problem and it was noticed by the government. Therefore, the Centre helped to come up with a good solution, which was the report I was typing. 
<br />There were numerous academic words which were hard for me to understand. In spite of the hard words, I learned a lot about the water pollution and the solution to change the waste water emission spot. 
<br />No matter how hard it would be, I had to get my volunteer time, no companies would sign for a lazy student who did nothing for them. Of course I finished the boring typing work and got enough volunteer time. It is my work.That’s it, just do it. Sometimes we don’t have any interest in something but it is reasonable to do it, because we can get back profit, and we need that. 
<br /> I also did the secretary work at the Centre. My duty was to help anyone who was in need. For instance, Ms. Zhou needed to go to the copy machine, but she had too much files to carry. So she asked me to help her, she couldn’t carry those files by herself. When they were at a meeting, I prepared tea for them. This work is much easier than typing. Work as a typist must sit facing the computer for all day, and my shoulders got paralysed. Instead, I could walk around to check if anyone need help, and noone would think I botherd them. 
<br />When the work was done nicely, we’ll be proud of ourselves.That will make us have more motivations to do work well. I think doing volunteer work is very useful in our future life, it is the best way to experience what taking a job is like and what will we be resbonsible in.

<br />I was a member of the badminton club of GCA since grade 10, and got 35 hours for playing badminton twice a week. I also took the Chinese PE class every Tuesday in my Grade 11, and got 50 hours for it. I have got 85 hours in total for my physical activity. 
<br /><br />Our club play badminton at Nanjing Normal University from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m. every Saturday afternoon. Each member should pay 20 yuan for each activity. I went there by bike every week. 
<br /><br />Playing badminton is a very healthy activity, we can keep fit and have fun in it. Generally, I played badminton with my classmate ---Katherine. She was my good partner, we always play together in the girls’ double badminton game and we both played well. At the beginning, when I first went to play badminton, I didn’t play very well. However, I was very hard-working, so I went to practice playing badminton frequently every week. 
<br />On Mar. 13 afternoon, I went to a badminton competition at Nanjing Internatinal School with the GCA Badminton Team. I played girls’ double with my partner Katerine. After one year’s improving, I had made a huge progress in badminton. No one will laugh at me when I play badminton. I am quite proud of myself, I get “fee” back for my hard work. I played 8 round in total because 4 schools’ players were at this competition. Luckily, we won 7of the games, and only lost one. We were the biggest winner that day. 
<br /><br />Also, my P.E. classes are fairly critical for my health. We attended the class once a week, and 2 hours each time. We have had been taught volleyball, table tenis, gym, Kongfu, and golf. The most challenge one I thought was volleyball. I could not serve the ball after 5 classes. The ball is too rigid to me, I got both my arms turning red and tumid for practising a lot. I thought maybe I had no talent in serving volleyball, so I gave it up and switched to learn passing the ball. It’s much easier than serving and I could handle that quite well. 
<br /><br />Sports match can help us practice more and get healthier. In my opinion, every healthy person must involve at least one sort of sport in their hobbies. Although not everyone has talent in physical activities, we can practise more and have a noticeable improve. The athletes’ “never give it up” spirits may teach a number of lazy people. Sports can teach people a lot, that’s why we hold the Olympic games every four years.

<br /><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/109821383_2927948_29214962.jpg" />
<br />I attended the Japanese Club in Grade 11, and I have got 7 hours for my participation. In the club activities, we always watched Japanese cartoons.
<br />Detective Conan has been my favourite cartoon since I was in the primary school. It tells a story about a high school student detective conquering an effective terroristic organization. During the detection, he solved hundreds of cases. 
<br />Conan used to be a senior detective, and he had a beautiful girlfriend, Lan. One day, he went to the amusement park in Tokyo with Lan, and found a group of suspicious men in black. Affected by his curiosity, he followed them to a quiet corner, and found they were trading something illegal. Unfortunately, he was exposed to another partner, and be forced to take a mysterious drug. However, Conan, who was supposed to die after taking the drug, stayed alive, but his body has changed to the size of a pupil!
<br />He left school and was taken care by Lan’s father, Maori, but they didn’t know Conan’s true status. Conan entered the primary school and started to find information of the mysterious organization. He solved uncountable cases during this time, and kept his secret alone. He didn’t tell anyone about himself, even Lan did not know. 
<br />I think Conan was a tough boy with strong will to destroy the terroristic organization. He was so lonely that he kept the secret on his own. He could not open his mind to anyone, because he was afraid if the member of the organization would kill his close friends when they know the secret. I understand him, and I admire his strong heart. Conan is just like the sea. It seems to be understand easily from the surface, but there are lots of corners which are hidden deep in the sea, and no one knows what lives there. 
<br />Lan was the greatest girl with strongest heart in the cartoon. Without boyfriend nearby, she chontrolled herself quite well. She hardly cried. She never told Conan how sad she was. She never did anything betrayed Conan. She adhered to their love. She must knew that Conan lied to her when every time he said he was focused on an crucial case and couldn’t come back, but she trusted him. She knew that there was some reason that Conan could not tell her the truth. What kind of love sustained her to keep their love intact. 
<br />Actually, when I faced the same problem, I could not be as calm and as strong as Lan. My mind was nearly collapse when I knew someone is going to leave me. I was beat so heavily with no strength left. I have nothing to rely on for the following year. Nevertheless, when I think of Lan, I seem to get power from her. I know I will be fine.

The restaurant located near Nanjing Foreign Language School. We chose this restaurant because it looks quite warm and romantic from outside. Also, we heard that the French dishes there are fairly traditional. 
<br /><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/109821383_10514567_29214982.jpg" />
<br /><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/109821383_1476658_29214999.jpg" />
<br />I had Fresh tomato basil noodles, Goarmets Salad(toast goose liver, bits off duck confit, salad, potato, and tomato), and ice-cream at Les 5 Sens. The handmade noodles were flexible and it tasted really nice with the ketchup. The salad, which was the most traditional of the dishes. It tasted a bit sour, and the sauce was as thin as water, quite different from the salad I had before. The toast goose liver, the intolerable taste made me engulfed by nausea. I had the liver before, but it was absolutely different from this one. The ice-cream, as normal as the Chinese ice-cream, was sweet and good-looking. I love ice-cream, any kind will fit my taste. 
<br /><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/109821383_3840341_29215013.jpg" />
<br /><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/109821383_14815952_29215025.jpg" />
<br />I like the food at Les 5 Sens a lot for its beautiful exterior, warm furniture, and delicious food. It looked like a European building from outside. When night came, the building got mysterious under the street lamp. The light inside the resturant made me feel warm, and I enjoyed my dinner quite well. It is really a wonderful restaurant, and prefered by numerous foreigners. I think it’s a good choice to try French dishes here.

<br /><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/109821383_10647497_29215104.jpg" />
<br />Last summer, I went to the Suzhou Museum with my best friend, Vera. The museum was designed by Ieoh Ming Pei in 2002, and completed in 2006. The building combined the traditional Chinese style and the modern style, so the new museum fits the surroundings quite well, and they looked harmonious. 
<br />Looking from the outside, I only saw two colours, dark grey and white. The buildings were simple but meaningful. The roof inherited the Chinese traditional inclined roof. The whole buildings looked like a group of ancient constructions, but they were actually modern buildings. 
<br />The entrance was not as magnificent as the other museums, it was also a simple design, a pailou with inclined roof. “Suzhou Museum” was clearly painted black on the white wall beside. Entering the museum, I focused on the ancient china region. The hall of china was a hemisphere, it has no edge. All the showcases were arranged circularly. Its ceiling was also curvy. When I went into the hall, I felt that I was engulfed by the china artworks. One huge cloisonne vase catched my eyes. It was luxurious with uncountable jewels inlaid in the body. When the light reaches it surface, it shined beautifully and dazzlingly. 
<br />I like the exhibition a lot. After the exhibition, I knew that China was the first country to have china technology, so that China is called china. The china products are nice and usefull. Because of the outer was covered by glaze, the product could hardly be destroyed that it could be kept for such a long time. I thought the china products represent Chinese culture, they were different and unique artwork and only existed in China. I can see the wonderful Chinese art and knew the folk artwork from the products, and improve my aesthetic standards. It was a meaningful journey.

<br />I went to visited the Suzhou Gardens Exhibition with my best friend Vera last summer. These gardens were listed into the Kulturebliste f. der welt in 1997. The gardens all have a long history. The private gardens in Suzhou started in 600 BC, and there were over170 gardens in Suzhou. Now, there were a dozen of gardens left by, Pavilion of Surging Waves, Lion Grove Garden, The humble Administrator’s Garden, The Lingering Garden, etc. All Suzhou Gardens take a small area of land, but no one thinks that they are boring. The reason is that the architects used a fantastic method, which aimed that when visitors move one step, the view shown would be different. They used considerable trees and archways to make the garden looks more roomy. Therefore, although the gardens are not big, we visitors can also enjoy a lot in them. 
<br /><br />The entrance of The humble Administrator’s Garden was also an archway. It limited the amount of visitors entering the garden, in order to prevent too many people from destroying the plants. The plants in the old humble Administrator’s Garden also had history, they were fragile, and needed protection. The most famous spot of each garden was the rockeries. There were rockeries in different shapes, each one has its own story. Every corner in the garden can be written into a beautiful song or poem. 
<br />The Suzhou Gardens were the inspissation of the nature, people in the modern city can still find where they initially belong to. I felt quite relaxed in the garden. 
<br />I love the gardens. After the exhibition, I was improved a lot. The nature should be tightly connected with civilization. When the world is changing,when we see less plants and birds in the city, we should know that we are hurting the nature. The world’s origin. It was a meaningful journey for me.

<br /><br />Participate in a Service Activity organized by a GCA teacher
<br />On Oct. 14, 2009, our class were brought by our Biology teacher Ms. Leuang to Nanjing Ancient Organism Museum to watch the magnificient ancient organisms there. 
<br />At the entrance of the museum, we saw a huge skeleton of a dinasaur. The skeleton has been kept since the Jurassic Period, for at least 200 million years. The dinasaur was so large, like a giant. I can not imagine how it looks like if it is still alive today. Then, we went up stairs to the second floor. On the second floor, we saw the board telling the history of the evolution of organisms. It said that all the organisms on the earth are classified into 6 Kingdoms, Archaebacteria, Eubacteria, Protista, Plantae, Fungi, and Animalia. We humans are put in the last Kingdom, Animalia, and we are the most complex organism. 
<br />After knowing the history, I went to the showcases of the fossils of the ancient organisms. The funniest fossil was the one of Man-o-war. It has round shape, stripe-like patterns on it. I did not know which organism it belonged to until I saw the label on the showcase. Man-o-war is in Animalia kingdom, and divided into the Cnidaria Phyllum. It is an aquatic animal. 
<br />This trip of visiting the museum helped me a lot in getting knowledge of Biology, and identify the fossils. After the trip, I found I have more interests in learning Biology. It must be a good starting point.

<br /><br />On April 27, 2011, I went to Nanjing Museum to watch the Ancient Chinese Lacquer Ware Exhibition with Jessica. The museum is on Zhongshandong Road. We chose to go to this exhibition because we were all interested in Chinese Lacquer and some of our classmates have been there before and thought that it was very interesting. In addition, the museum is the biggest one in Nanjing and we can go to the exhibition for free.
<br />I was attracted by the Carved Box with Landscape, building and figure design. It was created around 1736-1795, which in in Qianlong Period, Qing Dynasty. It is an antique from hundreds of years ago. The box is deep red in color and as its name there are many buildings and figures carved on it. It is made of wood, so it looks classical in Chinese style. The maker of it must be very dexterous to make such a beautiful box. The figure carved on top of it was very complicated and it must have taken a long time to make one box like this one. I guess it is a gift for the emperor, because normal people can’t afford such a nich box.
<br />The most interesting artwork I have seen at the exhibition was the huge lacquered folding screen. It was surrounded with dark brown wood frame. The screen was divided into 4 parts and each part was a erect rectangle with picture on it. The patterns on the screen were first sculpted on the wood and then colored with lacquer and looked very smooth. It was a speacial artwork and was quite useful in the past.
<br />I like the exhibition very much that I could deside to go there. After the exhibition, I knew that China was the first country to use lacquering technology and the Chinese Lacquer had a long history. The lacquer products are nice and usefull. Because of the lacquer outside, the product could hardly be destroyed that we can keep it for a long time. I thought the lacquer products could show us Chinese culture, so they were different and unique artwork. I can see the wonderful Chinese art and knew the folk artwork from the products, and improve my appreciation of beauty. It was meaningful experience.

<br />This year, I still worked as a typist and also secretary at the Jiangsu Engineering Consulting Centre for 4 days in term 3, and this is my volunteer experience.
<br />I used my weekends to do the volunteer job. Not like the work I did last year, it has no fun at all. The only thing I did was to sit in front of the computer and do the typing work. Before starting, I thought that can help me improve my speed of typing English words. However, I found I was wrong that my job was to type Chinese words, that meaned the work would be tougher and less intersting.. 
<br />No matter how hard it would be, I had to get my volunteer time, no companies would sign for a lazy student who did nothing for them. Of course I finished the boring typing work and got enough volunteer time. It is my work.That’s it, just do it. Sometimes we don’t have any interest in something but it is reasonable to do it, because we can get back profit, and we need that.
<br /><br />The report I typed was related to the environmental protection. It indicates the problem of the water quality in Xuanwu Lake. For the recent years, the Nanjingers’ domestic sewage was dropped into the lake and pollute the water. Someone pointed out the problem and it was noticed by the government. Therefore, the Centre helped to come up with a good solution, which was the report I was typing. 
<br />There were numerous academic words which were hard for me to understand. In spite of the hard words, I learned a lot about the water pollution and the solution to change the waste water emission spot. 
<br /> I also did the secretary work at the Centre. My duty was to help anyone who was in need. For instance, Ms. Zhou needed to go to the copy machine, but she had too much files to carry. So she asked me to help her, she couldn’t carry those files by herself. When they were at a meeting, I prepared tea for them. This work is much easier than typing. Work as a typist must sit facing the computer for all day, and my shoulders got paralysed. Instead, I could walk around to check if anyone need help, and noone would think I botherd them. 
<br />When the work was done nicely, we’ll be proud of ourselves.That will make us have more motivations to do work well. I think doing volunteer work is very useful in our future life, it is the best way to experience what taking a job is like and what will we be resbonsible in.

<br /><br />I attended the GCA Student Tutor Club in Grade 12 this year, and I have got 18 hours for my participation. In the club activities, I tutor the students in the lower grades.
<br />James Wen is my first tutee this year. He is weak at Science 10, so I come to help him study Science. I am always good at Science subjects, like Physics and Chemistry, and I like them. Both my junior high and high school chemistry teachers had great effects on me, perhaps that’s why I am always desiring to absorb more knowledge of science. They are both one kind of teachers who pursue precision and focus on practice. They loved to do experiments with me and I could see the beauty of the changing forms of chemicals. I love experiments; they are magic. I have even considered being a scientist, but it might not suit me. I like something more creative and practical. Therefore, I change my mind to learn engineering, which is based on scientific knowledge, and I hope I can introduce some innovations in the future. James has trouble on these subjects because he doesn’t like them and he hasn’t put any effort in them. I told him that he has to spend time in studying and try to memorize the basic formula and knowledge, this is the only way he can learn well.
<br />Jessica is my second tutee, and I tutor her Biology and Chemistry. We have discussed about Biology sometime. Our meeting not only includes my teaching, but also includes our happy discussion. We’ve discussed GM food once. Genetically modified food is a controversial issue in science. Some countries, like the USA, produce a number of GM foods such as GM soybeans, whereas others like the European Union doesn’t allow. The general public know only a bit of GM foods, and they can’t decide whether it’s safe to eat them or not. Although some scientists have declared that GM foods are not safe or environmental friendly, many people are still buying them for lower price. As a scientist, I would firstly investigate the GM foods to find out their advantages and disadvantages. Then I would publish my pros and cons with facts supporting on newspaper or magazines to let more people know this. If need, I would open a web site showing information of GM foods since the internet has a great power. I believe everything has at least two sides, so does the GM food. Though there are quite a lot of concerns on GM foods, they actually have merits--- they have high yields and there’s no need to spread pesticide on them. We should let the general public know both its merits and demerits and leave the power to make decision to themselves.  
<br />I enjoy my experience of being a tutor. I feel happy to help others. And during this year I understand how hard it is to earn money. We get 15 yuan per hour during the tutoring. Sometimes I thought one hour has passed, but it is only 15 minutes. It’s a meaningful peace of memory in my last year in GCA.

<br />Book Report
<br /><br />R.D Blackmore’s novel Lorna Doone tells a dramatic love story of Lorna Doone and John Ridd. They had misunderstood each other in the beginning, but this couldn’t stop their passionate love. After experiencing a number of hardships, they eventually got married and lived happily ever after.
<br />John was born in a farmer family, which was in lower class of the society, whereas the Doones were a group of robbers. Carver Doone killed John’s father while robbing the village, and he planned to force Lorna to marry him although she did not love him at all. John was at first upset for Lorna’s background---- the Doones was the enemy of his family. Later he found out that Lorna was not a member of the Doones, but part of the richest family in England. Her real uncle, Lor Brandir, was a friend of the King. Accidentally, John saw 3 robber waiting around Lorna’s house, so he jumped out and saved Lorna’s uncle. After the King had got to know John’s heroic deed, he felt grateful to John and honored him as Sir John Ridd. John was allowed to marry Lorna. It seemed to be a good ending, but Carver appeared and shot Lorna with a gun at the wedding. Outraged John followed Carver and watched him disappearing in the bog. Fortunately, Lorna did not die, she was just badly injured. They were together finally.
<br />This is a fantastic story. The plot is attractive and the words are easy to be understood. Blackmore added many factors like the enmity between the Doones and the Ridds to make the story more interesting. John Ridd was a kind boy. Although Carver had killed his father and wife, John still tried not to kill him. If he killed Carver, he would be no different from the Doones, the cruel family. Carver died because of the bog. John chose to love Lorna even though they were facing quite a lot of challenges. He was honest and real. Carver wanted to marry Lorna for her abundant money, but John didn’t. John’s love was simple and pure; he was just impressed by Lorna’s innocent smile. John kew what he wanted, and he tried his best to get them. He adhered to their love and never gave up. Lorna must be the luckiest woman to marry such a man.

<br /><br />On Dec. 21, 2010 I went to an Dutch restaurant named Tengmei Dutch Restuarunt with the Grade 10s, and my Grade 12 friends Oliver, Katherine, Amy, Chris, and Laurence. The restaurant located at Xin Jiekou, which is near the city centre, but it was really hard to find the restaurant because it was in the alley. We chose this restaurant because it looks quite warm and romantic from outside, and we’ve heard that the food tastes nice. Also, we heard that the Dutch dishes there are fairly traditional. 
<br />I had seafood stewed rice and ice-cream at Tengmei. The rice was flexble and tasty, and the cook put a thick layer of cheese on top of the rice and seafood. I like cheese very much, especially the hot fluffy cheese. There were much seafood mixed with the rice, like shrimp, oyster, and scallop. They were well cooked with tasty sauce, so they were really delicious. The salad, which was the most traditional of the dishes. It tasted a bit sour, and the sauce was as thin as water, quite different from the salad I had before. The bread, which is charged free, were baked with shallot, so it smells good and a little bit crisp. They put little salad with sauce on top of the bread. They were delicious. The ice-cream, as normal as the Chinese ice-cream, was sweet and good-looking. I love ice-cream, any kind will fit my taste. 
<br />The most shiny part of this restuarunt is not its food, but its games and singers. There was a man singing for the restaurunt and we can hear the songs without paying any money. That man’s voice was really touching and sexy. He sang a song called “Yellow” and I think he sang even better than the original singer. Afer I had my seafood stewed rice, the restaurant started the game called “Bingo”. It is a simple game, and we can win the game solely depends on our luck. Each one of us got a single piece of paper with numbers set in 5*5 form printed on it, and the host shouted out the numbers. The first people who got the numbers read out in the same line win the game. Amy won the game. She was very lucky.
<br />I like the food at Tengmei a lot for its beautiful exterior, warm furniture, singers, music and delicious food. It looked like a European building from outside. When night came, the building got mysterious under the street lamp. The light inside the resturant made me feel warm, and I enjoyed my dinner quite well. It is really a wonderful restaurant, and prefered by numerous foreigners. I think it’s a good choice to try Dutch dishes here.

<br /><br />I have been a member of the badminton club of GCA and also GCA badminton team for three years, and got 44 hours for playing badminton twice a week. I also took the Chinese PE class every Tuesday in my Grade 12, and got 50 hours for it. I have got 94 hours in total for my physical activity during the school year from 2010 to 2011.
<br />The club plays badminton at Nanjing Normal University from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m. every Saturday afternoon. Each member should pay 20 yuan for each activity. I went there by bike every week. I enjoy playing with my friends and this is a good chance to exercise.
<br />On Mar. 13 afternoon, I went to a badminton competition at Nanjing Internatinal School with the GCA Badminton Team. I played girls’ double with my partner Katerine. After one year’s improving, I had made a huge progress in badminton. No one will laugh at me when I play badminton. I am quite proud of myself, I get “fee” back for my hard work. I played 8 round in total because 4 schools’ players were at this competition. Luckily, we won 7of the games, and only lost one. We were the biggest winner that day. 
<br />Playing badminton is a very healthy activity, we can keep fit and have fun in it. Generally, I played badminton with my classmate ---Katherine. She was my good partner, we always play together in the girls’ double badminton game and we both played well. At the beginning, when I first went to play badminton, I didn’t play very well. However, I was very hard-working, so I went to practice playing badminton frequently every week.
<br />Also, my P.E. classes are fairly critical for my health. We attended the class once a week, and 2 hours each time. We have had been taught volleyball, table tenis, gym, Kongfu, and golf. The most challenge one I thought was volleyball. I could not serve the ball after 5 classes. The ball is too rigid to me, I got both my arms turning red and tumid for practising a lot. I thought maybe I had no talent in serving volleyball, so I gave it up and switched to learn passing the ball. It’s much easier than serving and I could handle that quite well. 
<br /><br />Sports match can help us practice more and get healthier. In my opinion, every healthy person must involve at least one sort of sport in their hobbies. Although not everyone has talent in physical activities, we can practise more and have a noticeable improve. The athletes’ “never give it up” spirits may teach a number of lazy people. Sports can teach people a lot, that’s why we hold the Olympic games every four years.

<br /><br />On August 21, 2010, I went to Jiming Temple with my friend Edward. It was not a big temple, but it has a long history, so we finished the trip around the whole park within one hour. 
<br />It was so hot to stand outdoor to visit the temple in summer, although it was relatively cool that day. I got three long incenses at the entrance of the temple park. The incenses were used to be burned in front of the temple while I am making a wish. In the legend, the Bodhisattva will receive my wish with the smoke of the incense and help me make it real. I made a long lon wish in front of the temple with the incenses in my hands to show my loyalty, but I can’t tell you what the wishes are. I’ve heard that if I tell others my wishes, they won’t come true.
<br />The temple was built on top of the little hill. Several elderlys were visting the temple sincerely. I asked the monk in the temple to tell me my fortune. He told me that 2010 will be my alternative year, and this really came true. I think fortune-telling is magnificent. 
<br />At last, I bought several amulets in the temple, which have different meanings for themselves. I hope my wishes can come true with the little amulets.
<br />Taking part in the religious service helped me know more about the buddhism and try the traditional activity myself. I enjoyed it.

<br /><br />On Oct. 2, 2010, I went to Shanghai Amusement Park to see the show there. There was a troupe acting there, and the background of the show was in the Han dynasty.
<br />The show was telling a story of two race minorities groups fighting for a beautiful princess. The boys all rode the horse on the grassland and had a battle. Because Han Dynasty was in the time thousands of years ago, there’s no guns or riffles at that time. Everyone used metal weapon like spears or swords. Therefore, the soldiers fought on the horse with spears in hands. And the actors acted their stunt on horse. They could stand up side down on the running horse, and they could cross the fire ring with the horse. I was worried about them when I saw their acting, because it was very dangerous actions. If they were not trained well, they might easily died in any of the tache. Normal people can not do that at all.
<br />That was an exciting day, everyone was screaming, I also enjoy the show very much. When I saw the boys dancing on the stage with such a short distance in front of me, I could even feel my blood rushing to my the top of my head. Sometimes I was also screaming with others. I love the concert very much and I enjoyed all the beautiful songs and exciting dances. Super Junior’s concert was extremely different with others because they didn’t use any dancing partners. Everyone on the huge stage was a member of the group, they could dance in coordination with each others. Also. I thought they could dance better than any dancing partners because they all have that talent and they were hardworking. It was a memorable show that I will never forget.
