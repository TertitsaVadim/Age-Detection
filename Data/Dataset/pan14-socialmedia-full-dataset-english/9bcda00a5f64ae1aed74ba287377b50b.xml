<br />Once you have discovered your birth number, forward this E-mail to the 
<br />rest of your friends, including the one who sent this to you.
<br /><br />Put your &quot;number&quot; in the &quot;Subject&quot; and pass it on.
<br /><br />Have fun.
<br />Your birth date describes who we are, what we are good at and what our 
<br />inborn abilities are. It also points to what we have to learn and the 
<br />challenges we are facing.
<br /><br />To figure out your birth number, add all the numbers in the birth date 
<br />together, like the example below, until there is only one digit.
<br /><br />A birth number does not prevent you from being anything you want to be, it 
<br />will just color your choice differently and give you a little insight.
<br />Example: March 20, 1950
<br /><br />3 + 20 + 1950 = 1973
<br />1 + 9 + 7 + 3 = 20
<br />2 + 0 = 2
<br /><br />Keep going until you end up with a single digit number. For this example, 2 
<br />is the birth number to read for the birth date below. Find your number and 
<br />then read on.

<br /><br />#2 The Peacemaker
<br /><br />#3 The Life Of The Party
<br /><br />#4 The Conservative
<br /><br />#5 The Nonconformist

<br /><br />#8 The Big Shot
<br /><br />#9 The Performer
<br /><br /># 1 - The Originator ... 1's are originals. Coming up with new ideas and 
<br />executing them is natural. Having things their! own way is another trait 
<br />that gets them as being stubborn and arrogant. 1's are extremely honest and 
<br />do well to learn some diplomacy skills. They like to take the initiative and 
<br />are often leaders or bosses, as they like to be the best. Being 
<br />self-employed is definitely helpful for them. Lesson to learn: Others' ideas 
<br />might be just as good or better and to stay open minded.
<br /><br />Famous 1's are Don Kotula, Tom Hanks, Robert Redford, Hulk Hogan, Carol 
<br />Burnett, Wynonna Judd, Nancy Reagan, and Raquel Welch.
<br /><br />#2 - The Peacemaker ... 2's are the born diplomats. They are aware of 
<br />others' needs and moods and often think of others before themselves. 
<br />Naturally analytical and very intuitive they don't like to be alone. 
<br />Friendship and companionship are very important and can lead them to be 
<br />successful in life, but on the other hand, they'd rather be alone than in an 
<br />uncomfortable relationship. Being naturally shy, they should learn to boost 
<br />their self-esteem and express themselves freely and seize the moment and not 
<br />put things off.
<br /><br />Famous 2's are President Bill Clinton, Madonna, Whoopee Goldberg, Thomas 
<br />Edison,Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.
<br /><br />#3 - The Life Of The Party ... 3's are idealists. They are very reative, 
<br />social, charming, romantic, and easygoing. They start manythings but don't 
<br />always see them through. They like others to be happy and go to great 
<br />lengths to achieve it. They are very popular and idealistic. They should 
<br />learn to see the world from a more realistic point of view.
<br /><br />3's are Alan Alda,Ann Landers, Bill Cosby, Melanie Griffith, Salvador Dali, 
<br />and Jodi Foster.
<br /><br />#4 - The Conservative ... 4's are sensible and traditional. They like 
<br />order and routine. They only act when they fully understand what they are 
<br />expected to do. They like getting their hands dirty and working hard. They 
<br />are attracted to the outdoors and feel an affinity with nature. They are 
<br />prepared to wait and can be stubborn and persistent. They should learn to be 
<br />more flexible and to be nice to themselves.
<br /><br />Famous 4's are Neil Diamond, Margaret Thatcher, Arnold Schwarzenegger, 
<br />Tina Turner, Paul Hogan, and Oprah Winfrey.
<br /><br />#5 - The Nonconformist ... 5's are the explorers. Their naturalcuriosity, 
<br />risk taking, and enthusiasm often land them in hot water. They need 
<br />diversity, and don't like to be stuck in a rut. The whole world is their 
<br />school and they see a learning possibility in every situation. The questions 
<br />never stop. They are well advised to look before they take action and make 
<br />sure they have all the facts before jumping to conclusions.
<br /><br />Famous 5's are Abraham Lincoln, Charlotte Bronte, Jessica Walter, 
<br />Vincent Van Gough, Bette Midler, Helen Keller, and Mark Hail.
<br /><br />#6 - The Romantic ... 6's are idealistic and need to feel useful to be 
<br />happy. A strong family connection is important to them. Their actions 
<br />influence their decisions. They have a strong urge to take care of others 
<br />and to help. They are very loyal and make great teachers. They like art or 
<br />music. They make loyal friends who take friendship seriously. 6's should 
<br />learn to differentiate between what they can change and what they can't.
<br /><br />Famous 6's are Albert Einstein, Jane Seymour, John Denver, Meryl Streep, 
<br />Christopher Columbus, and Goldie Hawn.
<br /><br />#7 - The Intellectual ... 7's are the searchers. Always probing for 
<br />hidden information, they find it difficult to accept things at face value. 
<br />Emotions don't sway their decisions. Questioning everything in life, they 
<br />don't like to be questioned themselves. They're never off to a fast start, 
<br />and their motto is, &quot;Slow and Steady Wins the Race. They come across as 
<br />philosophical and being very knowledgeable, and sometimes as loners. They 
<br />are technically inclined and make great researchers uncovering information. 
<br />They love to uncover secrets. They live in their own quiet world and could 
<br />do a better job of learning what is acceptable in the world at large.
<br /><br />Famous 7's are William Shakespeare, Lucille Ball, Michael Jackson, Joan 
<br />Baez, and Princess Diana.
<br /><br />#8 - The Big Shot ... 8's are the Problem Solvers. They areprofessional, 
<br />blunt and to the point, have good judgment and are decisive. They have grand 
<br />plans and like to live the good life. They take charge of people. They view 
<br />people objectively. They let you know in no uncertain terms that they are 
<br />the boss. They should learn to exude their decisions on their own needs 
<br />rather than what others want.
<br /><br />Famous 8's are Edgar Cayce, Barbara Streisand, George Harrison, Jane 
<br />Fonda, Pablo Picasso, Aretha Franklyn, and
<br />Nostradamus.
<br /><br />#9 - The Performer . 9's are natural entertainers. They are very caring 
<br />and generous, giving away their last dollar to help. With their charm they 
<br />have no problem making friends and nobody is a stranger to them. They have 
<br />so many different personalities that people around them have a hard time 
<br />understanding them. They are like chameleons, ever changing and blending in. 
<br />They have tremendous luck, but also can suffer from extreme in fortune and 
<br />mood. To be successful, they need to build a loving foundation.
<br />Famous 9's are Albert Schweitzer, Shirley MacLaine, Harrison Ford, 
<br />Jimmy Carter, and Elvis Presley.

<br /><br />this is GUY TALKING...
<br /><br />IT'S 7TH GRADE...
<br /><br />I stared at the girl next to me...She was my so called &quot;best friend&quot;... I stared at her... Long, silky hair... And I wished she was mine... But she didn't notice me like that... I knew it... After class she walked up to me and asked me for the notes she had missed the day before... And I handed them to her... She said &quot;thanks&quot;... And gave me a kiss on the cheek... I wanted to tell her... I want her to know that I don't want to be &quot;just friends&quot;... I love her but I'm too shy to tell her... And I don't know why...
<br /><br />IT'S JUNIOR YEAR...
<br /><br />My phone rang... On the other end it was her... She was in tears... Mumbling on and on about how her love had broken her heart... She asked me to come over because she didn't want to be alone... So I did... As I sat next to her on the sofa... I stared at her soft eyes... Wishing she was mine... After 2 hours... A Drew Barrymore movie... And 3 bags of chips... She decided to go to sleep... She looked at me.. Said &quot;thanks&quot; and gave me a kiss on the cheek... I wanted to tell her... I want her to know... That I don't want to be &quot;just friends&quot;... I love her but I'm too shy to tell her... And I don't know why...
<br /><br />IT'S SENIOR YEAR...
<br /><br />The day before prom... She walked to my locker... &quot;My date is sick&quot; she said... He's not going to go... Well... I didn't have a date and in 7th grade... We made a promise that if neiter of us had dates... We'd go together just as &quot;best friends&quot;... And so we did...
<br /><br />IT'S PROM NIGHT...
<br /><br />After everything was over with... I was standing at her front door step... I stared at her ... She smiled at me... I wanted her to be mine... But she doesn't think of me like that... And I know it... Then she said &quot;I had the best time... Thanks!&quot;... And she gave me a kiss on the cheek... I wanted to telll her... I wanted her to know that I don't want to be &quot;just friends&quot;... I love her but I'm just too shy... And I don't know why...
<br /><br />IT'S GRADUATION DAY...
<br /><br />A day passed... And then a week... And then a month... Before I could blink... It was graduation day... I watched her... Perfect body... Floated like an angel up on stage to get her diploma... I wanted her to be mine... But she doesn't think of me that way... And I know it... Before everyone went home... She came to me in her smock and hat... And cried as I hugged her... Then she lifted her head from my shoulders and said &quot;you're my best friend&quot;... &quot;Thanks!&quot;... And gave me a kiss on the cheek... I wanted to tell her.. I wanted to know that I wanted to be more than &quot;just friends&quot;... I love her but I'm too shy... And I don't know why...
<br /><br />IT'S A FEW YEARS LATER...
<br /><br />Now I sit in the pews of the church... A church that she is getting married in now... I watched her say &quot;I do&quot; an drive off to her new life... Married to another man... I wanted her to be mine... But she didn't see me like that... And I knew it... But before she drove away... She came to me and said &quot;You came!... Thanks!&quot;... And she kissed me on the cheek... I wanted to tell her... I wantd her to know that I didn't want to be &quot;just friends&quot;... I love her but I'm just too shy... And I don't know why...
<br /><br />YEARS PASSED...
<br /><br />I looked down at the coffin of a girl who used to be my &quot;best friend&quot;... At the service they read a diary entry she had wrote in her high school years... This is what it said... &quot;I stare at him... Wishing he was mine... But he doesn't notice me like that... And I know it... I wanted to tell him... I wanted him to know... That I don't want to be &quot;just friends&quot;... I love him but I'm just too shy... And I don't know why... I wish he would tell me he loved me&quot;... I wish I did too... I thought to myself and I cried...
