<br />One of the lost ones 
<br />The one without a name 
<br />Without an honest heart as compass 
<br /><br />This is me for forever 
<br />One without a name 
<br />These lines the last endeavor 
<br />To find the missing lifeline 
<br /><br />Oh how I wish 
<br />For soothing rain 
<br />All I wish is to dream again 
<br />My loving heart 
<br />Lost in the dark 
<br />For hope I'd give my everything 
<br /><br />My flower withered between 
<br />The pages two and three 
<br />The once and forever bloom gone with my sins 
<br /><br />Walk the dark path 
<br />Sleep with angels 
<br />Call the past for help 
<br />Touch me with your love 
<br />And reveal to me my true name 
<br /><br />Oh how I wish 
<br />For soothing rain 
<br />All I wish is to dream again 
<br />My loving heart 
<br />Lost in the dark 
<br />For hope I'd give my everything 
<br /><br />Oh how I wish 
<br />For soothing rain 
<br />Oh how I wish to dream again 
<br />Once and for all 
<br />And all for once 
<br />Nemo my name forevermore 
<br /><br />Nemo sailing home 
<br />Nemo letting go 
<br /><br />Oh how I wish 
<br />For soothing rain 
<br />All I wish is to dream again 
<br />My loving heart 
<br />Lost in the dark 
<br />For hope I'd give my everything 
<br /><br />Oh how I wish 
<br />For soothing rain 
<br />Oh how I wish to dream again 
<br />Once and for all 
<br />And all for once 
<br />Nemo my name forevermore 
<br /><br />My name forevermore

<br />To lose the child, the faith. 
<br />To end all the innocence. 
<br />To be someone like me. 
<br /><br />This is the birth of all hope. 
<br />To have what I once had. 
<br />This life unforgiven, It will end with a birth.
<br /><br />No will to wake for this morn. 
<br />To see another black rose born.
<br />Deathbed is slowly covered with snow. 
<br /><br />Angels, they fell first, but I'm still here 
<br />Alone as they are drawing near. 
<br />In heaven my masterpiece will finally be sung. 
<br /><br />It is the end of all hope.
<br />To lose the child, the faith. 
<br />To end all the innocence. 
<br />To be someone like me. 
<br /><br />Wounded is the deer that leaps highest, and my wound it cuts so deep. 
<br />Turn off the light and let me pull the plug.
<br /><br />It is the end of all hope.
<br />To lose the child, the faith. 
<br />To end all the innocence. 
<br />To be someone like me. 
<br /><br />This is the birth of all hope. 
<br />To have what I once had. 
<br />This life unforgiven, It will end with a birth.
<br /><br />Mandylion without a face, Deathwish without a prayer. 
<br />End of hope, end of love, end of time. The rest is silence.
<br /><br />It is the end of all hope.
<br />To lose the child, the faith. 
<br />To end all the innocence. 
<br />To be someone like me. 
<br /><br />This is the birth of all hope. 
<br />To have what I once had. 
<br /><br />It is the end of all hope.
<br />To lose the child, the faith. 
<br />To end all the innocence.
<br />To be someone like me. 
<br /><br />It is the end of all hope.
<br />To lose the child, the faith. 
<br />End of all hope.

<br />You were my saviour in my time of need.
<br />Blinded by faith I couldn't hear
<br />All the whispers, the warnings so clear.
<br />I see the angels,
<br />I'll lead them to your door.
<br />There's no escape now,
<br />No mercy no more.
<br />No remorse cuz I still remember
<br />The smile when you tore me apart.
<br /><br />You took my heart,
<br />Deceived me right from the start.
<br />You showed me dreams,
<br />I wished they would turn into real.
<br />You broke the promise and made me realize.
<br />It was all just a lie.
<br /><br />Sparkling angel, I couldn't see
<br />Your dark intentions, your feelings for me.
<br />Fallen angel, tell me why?
<br />What is the reason, the thorn in your eye?
<br />I see the angels,
<br />I'll lead them to your door
<br />There's no escape now
<br />No mercy no more
<br />No remorse cause I still remember
<br />The smile when you tore me apart
<br /><br />You took my heart,
<br />Deceived me right from the start.
<br />You showed me dreams,
<br />I wished they would turn into real.
<br />You broke the promise and made me realise.
<br />It was all just a lie.
<br />Could have been forever.
<br />Now we have reached the end.
<br /><br />This world may have failed you,
<br />It doesn't give you a reason why.
<br />You could have chosen a different path in life.
<br /><br />The smile when you tore me apart.
<br /><br />You took my heart,
<br />Deceived me right from the start.
<br />You showed me dreams,
<br />I wished they would turn into real.
<br />You broke the promise and made me realise.
<br />It was all just a lie.
<br />Could have been forever.
<br />Now we have reached the end.

<br />not leaving me alone behind. 
<br />There's no other way. 
<br />I prayed to the gods let him stay. 
<br />The memories ease the pain inside, 
<br />now I know why. 
<br /><br />Chorus: 
<br />All of my memories keep you near. 
<br />In silent moments imagine you here. 
<br />All of my memories keep you near. 
<br />Your silent whispers, silent tears. 
<br /><br />Made me promise I'd try 
<br />to find my way back in this life. 
<br />I hope there is a way 
<br />to give me a sign you're ok. 
<br />Reminds me again it's worth it all 
<br />so I can go on. 
<br /><br />Repeat chorus: 
<br /><br />Together in all these memories 
<br />I see your smile. 
<br />All the memories I hold dear. 
<br />Darling, you know I will love you 
<br />until the end of time.

<br />Like opening the wound
<br />I'm picking me apart again
<br />You all assume
<br />I'm safer in my room
<br />Unless I try to start again
<br /><br />I don't want to be the one
<br />Who battles always choose
<br />Cuz inside I realize
<br />That I'm the one confused
<br /><br />I don't know what's worth fighting for
<br />Or why I have to scream
<br />I don't know why I instigate
<br />And say what I don't mean
<br />I don't know how I got this way
<br />I know it's not alright
<br />So I'm breaking the habit
<br />I'm breaking the habit tonight
<br /><br />Cultured my cure
<br />I tightly lock the door
<br />I try to catch my breath again
<br />I hurt much more
<br />Than anytime before
<br />I have no options left again
<br /><br />I dont want to be the one
<br />Who battles always choose
<br />Cuz inside I realize
<br />That I'm the one confused
<br /><br />I don't know what's worth fighting for
<br />Or why I have to scream
<br />I don't know why I instigate
<br />And say what I don't mean
<br />I don't know how I got this way
<br />I'll never be alright
<br />So, I'm breaking the habit
<br />I'm breaking the habit tonight
<br /><br />I'll paint it on the walls
<br />Cuz I'm the one that falls
<br />I'll never fight again
<br />And this is how it ends
<br /><br />I don't know what's worth fighting for
<br />Or why I have to scream
<br />But now I have some clarity
<br />to show you what I mean
<br />I don't know how I got this way
<br />I'll never be alright
<br />So, I'm breaking the habit
<br />I'm breaking the habit
<br />I'm breaking the habit tonight

<br />Mornings, evenings, nights.
<br />When I'm alone, or when I'm walking in public.
<br />When I can feel I miss you so deep, I pray for some rain, and then I walk. I walk in the rain, so no one can see my tears. 
<br />And the tears that means so much for me, cause you're in every single one of them, when they falls down from my cheeks and down on the ground, people are just walking right over them. Like they didn't matter. 
<br />I love that I've met you, I can't explain the feeling of getting to love you, and I hate that I've lost you. I hate that I cry over you so often.
<br />I miss you so much, and I love you even more.
