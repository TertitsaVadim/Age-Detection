		<document id="96c05fdf126d7fecdf9ab3afe963e6b1" url=""><![CDATA[My first feelings in my new house<br/><br/>Hi all, for starting...
<br /><br />I'm not making a speech, just feel very clumsy right now, don't know where to start with.
<br /><br />As a Y!360 user, I know that all that I write will be read by friends, so I can write about everything and nothing.
<br /><br />As a PAN new user, I am lost. I spent my first day at PAN to randomly visit people. Some pages were really interesting, some were simple, but natural and friendly, those pages were the pages I added or would revisit once more before requesting to be added. Sometimes ppl refused me, sometimes ppl accepted, sometimes ppl accepted and followed by something really sweet and caring.
<br /><br />However, those pages are just the minority comparing with the ones about sex, flirting, exchanging nothing but some &quot;hot&quot; lines. Sad part!
<br /><br />I really don't appreciate PAN's &quot;spying&quot; system that allows you to check who visited your page. No privacy left after that at all. Besides that, it's really nice. You know exactly what's happening in your friends' home to decide weather or not to make a visit to their house  ^_^
<br /><br />And with PAN, you can make friends easier than in any type of blog I've known. Friends belong to so diversified cultures, nationalities, beliefs and behaviors. That's the most wonderful thing that I found in PAN!
<br /><br />Just for closing my 2nd entry which was not much more informative than the 1st one (only much longer), thank you all for visiting my home, leaving some messages or comments, adding me or accepting my add request. Will you be revisiting again n again? lol
<br /><br />Have a nice week!
<br /><br />Kisses

What will happen the day when I turn 80 or 100? A girl without teeth and  many wrinkles would be really funny!  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cry.gif" alt=":)" /> 
<br /><br />Some of my friends in Vietnam waited until 5AM (0:00AM in France) to wish me my happy 27th birthday. Some left me warm messages, sent greeting cards or posted greetings on my Yahoo! Page and their pages. Those are my “real” friends. Those are my angels!  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/angel.gif" alt=":)" /> 
<br /><br />Here, I also received so many greetings from you, my new-found virtual friends. Less “real” for the moment, but not less friendly and caring. Thank you all! <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/love.gif" alt=":)" />  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/love.gif" alt=":)" />  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/love.gif" alt=":)" />  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/love.gif" alt=":)" /> 
<br /><br />----------------------------------********---------------------------------------
<br /><br />This birthday was not the first one that I’ve celebrated without some of the people who are the most important to me. The last birthday that I could remember, with my family in full, was @ my 9th grade. Everyone was there, including my parents, my brother, my friends.
<br /><br />After that, @each following birthday, some were missing, some new attended. That’s amazing how the circle around you can change upon a year!
<br /><br />Being in France, with only a few friends, being in the middle of a long lasting public transport strike and a sudden hard winter, for the first time, my small party was surrounded by only the members of our family. My parents in law, my brother, my husband, and I. 5 people only, but the heat was sufficient to warm up my heart and move me to tears when listening to them singing the happy birthday song, closing my eyes while blowing out the candles and making a wish. My simple and humble wish of every year was the same: please, please a thousand times please, don’t never take away from me the ones that I cherish! 
<br /><br />Today is not over. Today is a special day to me. So, today, let me believe that I really am a special girl!
<br /><br />Many kisses!

<br /><br />Sometimes, like this morning...
<br /><br />It’s been only a few days I’ve joined PAN’s network. What I immediately found here was a surprising openness and variety that existed among the members. Some, just alike in any other social and/or dating network, just want to find some HOT ones to talk with, to exchange webcams and erotic sessions. Some do care about what others have to say, do read what others write and actually do think about it. 
<br /><br />So, can someone give me an answer to my question?
<br /><br />-------------------------------
<br /><br />Let me make a brief summary of how that question bothered me.
<br /><br />I’ve just been settling down in France with my husband. While waiting for my work permit, I don’t have the right to work. That is equivalent to the fact that I stay alone at home when my husband goes to work. It took 3 months already, and another 3 months are needed. 
<br /><br />When you don’t work, you hardly can occupy yourself everyday! Since 10 years, I have had the habit of surfing the internet, participating into multiple forums, networks, but considering the actual time budget that I possess, the time that I pass on the internet now doubled or tripled. 
<br /><br />I met a young man 2 weeks ago on the internet. A simple friend, funny to talk with! I even didn’t know his face, except one picture of him on the avatar screen. He proposed to send me his pictures and webcam sometimes, not asking me anything in exchange, but I refused. I really don’t care about someone’s appearance when that someone is nice and interesting. That’s how I call a virtual friend. 
<br /><br />I told him about my actual situation, my husband, my life. We talked about silly things in life. He told me about his previous lovers, he updated me with the feelings and steps he is carrying to conquer a girl whom he thinks he is right now falling in love with. 
<br /><br />It’s funny talking to each other. It’s different than talking to some real friends, who know each other too well to be satisfied with some common questions, some common talks. 
<br /><br />2 days before my birthday, my husband surprised our conversation. He kept quiet for a moment, and then got angry. Anger, disappointment, jealousy, or the combination of all those feelings, I am not sure, but we had a serious talk after that. 
<br /><br />-	Please, tell me what’s wrong? You have to know that he’s only a virtual friend, we are not even exchanging photos or webcams, he knows that I am married and has no intention to flirt with me.
<br />-	It’s what you say! You want me to be happy when you stay home flirting with some guys while I am working?
<br />-	I am not flirting with him! We are simple friends. No flirting at all. I’m bored at home the whole day long. I just needed to talk with someone!
<br />-	Don’t you dare saying that there’s nothing happening between you guys? I see a seduction game in your conversations. Why don’t you try to talk with a woman rather than a man? (I allowed him to read through my conversations’ achieves. Was it a mistake<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/unsure.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />For a single moment, I was shocked. I have never thought about that before. Yes, that’s true! Why am I always feeling at easy talking to a stranger when that stranger is a man rather than a woman? And yes, that’s true also that even if I keep denying, and even if our conversations remain within the friendship borders, some tiny parts of them sometimes still reflect a willingness to seduce the opposite person. Is this normal?
<br /><br />At the end of the journey, we reconciled. I promised to not chatting with that man anymore, and not accepting any similar type of “virtual friend”. It’s what I promised, and it’s what I did. Though, I felt sad, really sad.
<br /><br />I told my virtual friend with all sincerity, cos’ I couldn’t invent any other excuses “My husband knows that we talk with each other and he is jealous. He was so sad that I promised to not talking with you anymore. I know that I hurt your feelings, but I don’t know what to do else. I am sorry”. 
<br /><br />A long silence, then, this morning, I received some offlines from him “I don’t blame on you, though it did hurt. I’ll step back because I want you to be happy, even if we don’t know each other for long, and both of us know that no one expects anything special from the other. Will you really be happy?”
<br /><br />-------------------------
<br /><br />Will I really be happy? I don’t know. For the moment, I am sad, really sad, to have to turn my back to someone who has been kind to me, sad to know that I’ve lost part of the trust my husband had in me, and sad because I would never be able to make him understand that I need those virtual friends to cheer me up, to feel interested and desirable again, to kill the empty lonely time, to communicate with the world, and to really feel happy. 
<br /><br />What to do? Am I right? Am I wrong? I love my husband and cherish our relationship above anything else, but to which extent would I be able to restrain myself, to which extent should I let a virtual relationship go, to not harming my real ones?
<br /><br />Silly girl, silly thoughts! Someone able to help?

I am unable to write beautiful texts, I can just write about my everyday’s life. Sometimes, it doesn’t bring any help to anyone, but it’s my way of sharing, I can’t do anything about it except letting it happens! <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cry.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cry.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cry.gif" alt=":)" /> 
<br /><br />**********************************
<br /><br />Yesterday night, my younger brother called me. He told me that he had participated in a spiritual game, where 7 people, including him, boys &amp; girls, had sat together, forming a circle, with an alphabet and a coin in the middle, inviting a spirit to come. And the scary part was that had worked. 
<br /><br />Everyone kept their finger 1cm above the coin (no one touched it), concentrate, &amp; silently invited the spirit. During the first half hour, nothing happened, then the coin started to move from one letter to another, to “talk” with them. That spirit was a girl, 18 years old, with a name, killed by a car accident. She could answer to almost all of the questions raised by the participants, and refused or coundn’t answer to some others.
<br /><br />I listened to him, knowing that he was sincere while telling me that story, but felt extremely scared. I myself have tried once to play that “game”, without success, but the atmosphere that reigned at that time was so heavy that I decided to never start it again. Some of my friends also told me that they did play, and it did work. After that, I tried to learn more about the matter, some explanations on the internet explained it as a type of human magnetic energy that can not be observed neither measured by any modern equipment, but once gathered, can make a light force, able to move a small object. Some others had very spiritual answers, discouraged anyone from practicing that game, advised on the measures to take to warrant the participants’ sake after such a game had taken place. 
<br /><br />I tried to reason my brother in the most scientific way possible, but he refused to believe in what is called human magnetic energy cos’ it was invisible. What he did saw from his own eyes was something inexplicable &amp; much more scary. All his friends got scared. And I also started to feel uncomfortable again. Is it supernatural, superstition, or a simple scientific fact that we have not yet been able to explain?

I don’t wanna go into details of the reasons why I had to visit those places. I just want to compare the doctors from private medical centers with angels, and the ones working for state-owned hospitals with the opposite of angels <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" />  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/tongue.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/biggrin.gif" alt=":)" /> 
<br /><br />My husband is sick since a few days &amp; I am quite tired too. It’s good to be able to feel busy, but 2 months of absolute resting have weakened me a lot. I would probably need some time to catch up with the new rhythm <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/wacko.gif" alt=":)" /> .
<br /><br />Profit well from your Sunday, friends, &amp; please bear in mind that whatever you do, health must come first!  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/biggrin.gif" alt=":)" />

<br /><br />9/12: my sweetheart's birthday
<br />11/12: our wedding anniversary
<br />24/12: X-mas
<br />xxx/12: last day of 2007 <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" /> 
<br /><br />And, each of these is a special occasion 4 offering &amp; receiving gifts.
<br /><br />It's been quite a long time now that I've stopped working. My &quot;personal budget&quot; is almost empty, so a few days ago I told my husband &quot;I'll have only 1 small gift for you for the four celebrations&quot;. Of course he agreed, &amp; of course he would never mind even if I had nothing for him.
<br /><br />However, every time stopping by smt really cute that I were sure that he would love, I felt sad, silly I were, &amp; silly I am!
<br /><br />And yes, I know that some gonna tell me that it's not the gift that matters, that I can create myself personalized gifts, or some cute &amp; emotional gifts, but, as I said, I am silly! I WANT to be able to make a REAL GIFT to him. This desire is hurting me, &amp; hurting my budget so badly! <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cry.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cry.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cry.gif" alt=":)" /> 
<br /><br />Any gift idea? <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cry.gif" alt=":)" />

<br /><br />Before telling you what I gave to my husband as gifts for celebrating our 1st wedding anniversary, I should say thanks to you all, those who have tried to help and who did helped me with finding ideas for a gift that fit my tiny budget <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/blushing.gif" alt=":)" /> 
<br /><br />So, thanks a lot &amp; a lot! <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/wub.gif" alt=":)" /> 
<br /><br />******************************
<br /><br />A book, he never reads!
<br />Flowers, he doesn't like <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" /> (men's preference)
<br />His favorite dishes, he has it everyday all ready, to an extent that nothing can b special anymore <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cry.gif" alt=":)" /> 
<br /><br />So I spent time 2 hang around the shops which sell not expensive items, but couldn't really figure out what to buy cos' he seems to have all &amp; not desiring anything particular @this moment. 
<br /><br />*****************************
<br /><br />At the end, what I offered him was:
<br /><br />- 20 order slips that I designed &amp; colored myself, each order slip carries one instruction that I have to do upon presentation of the order (things that he likes, exp: a massage with massage oil, 1 whole quiet journey 4 relaxing, &amp; <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/blushing.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/blushing.gif" alt=":)" /> ... that's private, lol <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/biggrin.gif" alt=":)" /> )
<br /><br />- 2 bottle of massage oil (energizing &amp; relaxing)
<br /><br />That's all, but he seemed happy. He must be, right? <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/blushing.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" /> 
<br /><br />******************************
<br /><br />In return, the flowers were sent to me in the middle of the day, as a surprise. The bucket is huge compared with my size <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/biggrin.gif" alt=":)" /> (please check out @my photos album. What a pity that PAN doesn't allow picture attachment into blog entries!)
<br /><br />He took half a day off @work &amp; took me to a Japanese restaurant 2 celebrate, after what we climbed on top of the Printemps &amp; Lafayette buildings to contemplate the panoramic view, walked along side of the luminous streets &amp; went back home late, tired, but happy and more in love than ever.
<br /><br />That's all, my dear friends.
<br /><br />Life is beautiful! <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/wub.gif" alt=":)" />

<br /><br />Y am I not often online this time? So many events that will be coming at the end of the month, so many preparations to carry out, &amp; the main reason is that I've obtained temporary work permit, good news, rite? <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/biggrin.gif" alt=":)" /> 
<br /><br />Papers in my pocket, I started searching around 4 an adequate job, &amp; have already started some interviews. This period, everywhere, ppl r slowing down their rhythm so I will obviously not find one b4 year-end, but I have no problem with that  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" /> 
<br /><br />The coming year will certainly b a good one for me <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" /> So I'm staying HAPPY &amp; BUSY
<br /><br />Few nonsense words just 2 let u know that even if I'm silent, I'm still hanging around (silently) our pan.nethouses <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/wub.gif" alt=":)" /> 
<br /><br />Have a great week, my friends! <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/angel.gif" alt=":)" />

<br /><br />Friends who have sent me private messages or who have left messages in my GB, please do not feel offended of not receiving any feedback in return.
<br /><br />I've been busy, but that's not all.
<br /><br />My husband is sick, rather serious.
<br /><br />He is undergoing several medical tests at this moment &amp; I manage my schedule to be besides him as much as I can, to support him the more I could &amp; to keep myself  optimistic as long as I still can make him laugh &amp; see him standing on his feet.
<br /><br />A promising year had suddenly turned into unpredictable year
<br /><br />Family &amp; health r vital for one person to be happy
<br /><br />&amp; when troubles involve both family &amp; health, that is simply hard to deal with!
<br /><br />Anyway, one door closed, another one will be opened, or when no more option available, with a firm determination, we probably can break the door <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" />

<br /><br />Vietnamese around the world are celebrating the Tet
<br /><br />In France, the Tet seems much more Chinese than Vietnamese because of the overwhelming number of Chinese people. After all, there are not many differences in the way we celebrate our new year.
<br /><br />Though, still something missing. May be it's the family gathering, the joy &amp; peace on each person's face, the willingness to do smt good to bring good lucks to oneself and to his/her family.
<br /><br />I don't see it here. Tet is just an occasion for many to do more business.
<br /><br />Since when I've stopped to have the joyfull feeling when the Tet approaches?
<br />Since when I've stopped finding the Tet special?
<br />Since when I've started criticizing?
<br /><br />May be since the Tet of 7 years ago, when I start entering a Tet alone phase  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" />
