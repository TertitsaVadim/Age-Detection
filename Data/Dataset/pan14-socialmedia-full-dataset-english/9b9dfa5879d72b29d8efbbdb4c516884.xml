<br />I wish you hadn't held my hand, And made me like you more. 
<br />I wish you hadn't whispered, All those sweet things in my ear. 
<br />I wish you hadn't stroked my hair, Or hugged and held me near. 
<br />I wish you hadn't smiled, When I opened up my eyes 
<br />I wish there were no little things, Reminding me of you. 
<br />I wish memories would not, Make me feel the way I do. 
<br />I wish you didn't know, That if you called I'd run right over. 
<br />I wish I could be strong and smart, And give you the cold shoulder. 
<br />I wish you would have treated me, Just like another girl. 
<br />Then the timez I spent with you, Wouldnt feel like what they were. 
<br />I wish I hadn't fallen hard, I thought you were for real, 
<br />But I just can't help the way, That being with you made me feel. 
<br />I wish I wouldn't wake up sad, And know I've dreamt of you. 
<br />I wish I could get through a day, and never think of you.
<br />I wish I could loose this pain, Deep within my heart
<br />I wish that we had ended, Before we had a chance to start 
<br />I wish I could forget, How you took away my fears 
<br />I wish I could at least say, That you wiped away my tears. 
<br />I wish that you had been the guy, I hoped that you would be. 
<br />I wish I could get over you, Like you got over me. 
<br />I wish that I could see you, For the person that you are, 
<br />But the heart won't ever listen, Or grant wishes on a star. 
<br />And I wish that all these wishes, Were full of honesty 
<br />I wish, oh how I wish, that you would come right back to me

<br />&amp;&amp; as soon as you meet them you can't get them out of your head.
<br />and every little thing reminds you of them. just one
<br />smell makes you close your eyes and pretend
<br />he's there. just one name makes your heart skip a beat. just one guy
<br />makes your world completely different &amp; all you want is to go
<br />back to when you didn't know him at all;; 
<br />nut you cant furget him cus the love you had is unfurgettable and will haunt you forever.
<br />The is true love.
