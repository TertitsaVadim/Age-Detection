<br /><br />Everyday David comes to Sarah's house to hang out with her brother, and Sarah likes David alot and David likes Sarah but he doesn't want anyone to know because she is an eighth grader. DO NOT IGNORE!!!!!!!
<br /><br />Friday:
<br /><br />David in is on the phone with Bobby, Sarah hears that David is coming over to watch the game. Sarah gets all dressed up for David.
<br />2 minutes later
<br />David comes in...

<br />David- *smiles* Okay then I'll wait
<br />Sarah- Umm do you want a drink?
<br />David- Okay, but i don't want to bother u, I can get it
<br />Sarah- Oh it's cool, I'll get it
<br /><br />Sarah walks slowly behind his back and smiles....few seconds later she comes out with the drink. Sarah accidently spills the drink on the floor, and almost falls. David grabs her by the waist before she could fall. They looked at eachother...
<br /><br />David- Are u okay?
<br />Sarah- Yeah thanks...
<br />David- Umm...so...
<br />Sarah- I'll go get some more drinks

<br /><br />Bobby and David were downstairs watching the game. It was half time. They started talking about some guy stuff. Bobby saw what happened when his sister spilled the drink, he didn't want his best friend to date his sister. He saw Sarah and Nikki listening and peaking through the door crack. He smiled and began to talk, pretending he doesn't see them
<br /><br />Bobby- Do you like my sister?

<br />David- NO! I said no already why don't u believe me

<br />David- She's not my type and she's ugly
<br />Bobby- Whoa! Okay ...
<br /><br />Bobby sees his sister like she is about to cry... then Bobby feels guilty. It was dinner time and Nikki ordered pizza. David looks at Sarah and smiles. Sarah looked the other way with her eyes about to water. David looked confused.
<br /><br />43 minutes
<br /><br />The pizza came. Bobby paid for the pizza and everyone took a slice exept for Sarah.
<br /><br />Nikki- Hey i thought you said you were hungry, why aren't you eating?!

<br /><br />Bobby- Aye yo David go talk to Sarah.
<br />David- But she's mad
<br />Bobby- *throws a pillow at him* Shut up, and try to make her come down.
<br /><br />David goes up nervously and knocks on the door. Sarah opens the door.
<br /><br />Sarah- What?
<br /><br />David- Uhmm the games starting, Wunna watch it?
<br />Sarah- *rolls her eyes* No!

<br /><br />over and have dinner with her parents. Since this is such a
<br /><br />big event, the girl announces to her boyfriend that
<br /><br />after dinner, she would like to go out and make love
<br /><br />for the first time.
<br /><br />* * * * * * * * *
<br /><br />Well, the boy is ecstatic, but he has never had sex
<br /><br />before, so he takes a trip to the pharmacist to get
<br /><br />some condoms. He tells the pharmacist it's his first time and
<br /><br />the pharmacist helps the boy for about an hour.
<br /><br />He tells the boy everything there is to know about condoms and
<br /><br />sex.
<br /><br />* * * * * * * * *
<br /><br />At the register, the pharmacist asks the boy how many
<br /><br />condoms he'd like to buy, a 3-pack, 10-pack, or family
<br /><br />pack. The boy insists on the family pack because he
<br /><br />thinks he will be rather busy, it being his first time and all.
<br /><br />* * * * * * * * *
<br /><br />That night, the boy shows up at the girl's parents
<br /><br />house and meets his girlfriend at the door. &quot;Oh, I'm
<br /><br />so excited for you to meet my parents, come on in!&quot;
<br /><br />* * * * * * * * *
<br /><br />The boy goes inside and is taken to the dinner table
<br /><br />where the girl's parents are seated. The boy quickly
<br /><br />offers to say grace and bows his head.
<br /><br />* * * * * * * * *
<br /><br />A minute passes, and the boy is still deep in prayer,
<br /><br />with his head down.
<br /><br />* * * * * * * * *
<br /><br />10 minutes pass, and still no movement from the boy.
<br /><br />* * * * * * * * *
<br /><br />Finally, after 20 minutes with his head down, the
<br /><br />girlfriend leans over and whispers to the
<br /><br />boyfriend, &quot;I had no idea you were this religious.&quot;
<br /><br />* * * * * * * *
<br /><br />The boy turns, and whispers back, &quot;I had no idea your
<br /><br />father was a pharmacist.&quot;
<br /><br />* * * * * * * * *
<br /><br />If you DON'T re-post this in 1 minute you will
<br /><br />have bad sex for life!!!
<br /><br />&amp;while i'm at it.
<br /><br />Because u opened this, u will get kissed on friday by
<br /><br />the person u luv!! &amp; 2morrow will be tha best day of ur life, so
<br /><br />DO NOT BREAK THIS CHAIN!!!!!! IF U BREAK IT, U WILL HAVE
<br /><br />RELATIONSHIP PROBLEMS FOR THE NEXT TEN YEARS!!!!!!!!
