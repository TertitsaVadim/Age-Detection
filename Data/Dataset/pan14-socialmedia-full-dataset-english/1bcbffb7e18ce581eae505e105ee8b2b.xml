<br /><br />this is GUY TALKING...
<br /><br />IT'S 7TH GRADE...
<br /><br />I stared at the girl next to me...She was my so called &quot;best friend&quot;... I stared at her... Long, silky hair... And I wished she was mine... But she didn't notice me like that... I knew it... After class she walked up to me and asked me for the notes she had missed the day before... And I handed them to her... She said &quot;thanks&quot;... And gave me a kiss on the cheek... I wanted to tell her... I want her to know that I don't want to be &quot;just friends&quot;... I love her but I'm too shy to tell her... And I don't know why...
<br /><br />IT'S JUNIOR YEAR...
<br /><br />My phone rang... On the other end it was her... She was in tears... Mumbling on and on about how her love had broken her heart... She asked me to come over because she didn't want to be alone... So I did... As I sat next to her on the sofa... I stared at her soft eyes... Wishing she was mine... After 2 hours... A Drew Barrymore movie... And 3 bags of chips... She decided to go to sleep... She looked at me.. Said &quot;thanks&quot; and gave me a kiss on the cheek... I wanted to tell her... I want her to know... That I don't want to be &quot;just friends&quot;... I love her but I'm too shy to tell her... And I don't know why...
<br /><br />IT'S SENIOR YEAR...
<br /><br />The day before prom... She walked to my locker... &quot;My date is sick&quot; she said... He's not going to go... Well... I didn't have a date and in 7th grade... We made a promise that if neiter of us had dates... We'd go together just as &quot;best friends&quot;... And so we did...
<br /><br />IT'S PROM NIGHT...
<br /><br />After everything was over with... I was standing at her front door step... I stared at her ... She smiled at me... I wanted her to be mine... But she doesn't think of me like that... And I know it... Then she said &quot;I had the best time... Thanks!&quot;... And she gave me a kiss on the cheek... I wanted to telll her... I wanted her to know that I don't want to be &quot;just friends&quot;... I love her but I'm just too shy... And I don't know why...
<br /><br />IT'S GRADUATION DAY...
<br /><br />A day passed... And then a week... And then a month... Before I could blink... It was graduation day... I watched her... Perfect body... Floated like an angel up on stage to get her diploma... I wanted her to be mine... But she doesn't think of me that way... And I know it... Before everyone went home... She came to me in her smock and hat... And cried as I hugged her... Then she lifted her head from my shoulders and said &quot;you're my best friend&quot;... &quot;Thanks!&quot;... And gave me a kiss on the cheek... I wanted to tell her.. I wanted to know that I wanted to be more than &quot;just friends&quot;... I love her but I'm too shy... And I don't know why...
<br /><br />IT'S A FEW YEARS LATER...
<br /><br />Now I sit in the pews of the church... A church that she is getting married in now... I watched her say &quot;I do&quot; an drive off to her new life... Married to another man... I wanted her to be mine... But she didn't see me like that... And I knew it... But before she drove away... She came to me and said &quot;You came!... Thanks!&quot;... And she kissed me on the cheek... I wanted to tell her... I wantd her to know that I didn't want to be &quot;just friends&quot;... I love her but I'm just too shy... And I don't know why...
<br /><br />YEARS PASSED...
<br /><br />I looked down at the coffin of a girl who used to be my &quot;best friend&quot;... At the service they read a diary entry she had wrote in her high school years... This is what it said... &quot;I stare at him... Wishing he was mine... But he doesn't notice me like that... And I know it... I wanted to tell him... I wanted him to know... That I don't want to be &quot;just friends&quot;... I love him but I'm just too shy... And I don't know why... I wish he would tell me he loved me&quot;... I wish I did too... I thought to myself and I cried...

<br />IF YOU'RE A BOY POST THIS AS &quot;I WANNA TELL HER SOOO BAD&quot;

<br /><br />[They both go back home. And erika begins to read tha letter he gave her]
<br /><br />It says.....
<br /><br />Erika,
<br /><br />U probably already know that im leaving, i knew this would be better if i wrote a letter explaining tha truth about how much i care about you. The truth is, is that i never loved you, i hated you so much, u are my bitch and dont u ever forget that. I never cared about you, and never wanted to talk to you, and be around u. U really have no clue how much i hate you. Now that im leaving i thought u should know that i hate you bitch, u never did tha right thing, and u were never there. I didnt think i could hate someone as much as i hate you. And i never want to see you, for the rest of my life, i will never miss kissing you like before, i never want to cuddle up, how we used to. I will not miss you and thats a promise. U never had my love, and i want you to remember that. Bitch u keep this letter bcuz this may be tha last thing u have from me. I hate you so much. i will not talk to you soon bitch.... Goodbye
<br />- Kyle
<br /><br />[ erika begins to cry, she throws tha paper in tha garbage &amp; crys for hours ]
<br /><br />....A day passes, she is sad, depressed and she feels so lonely.... Then she gets a fone call....
<br /><br />Friend: how are u feeling?
<br /><br />Girl: i just cant believe this happend i thought he loved me.
<br /><br />Friend: o, about that. Kyle left me a msg. A few days ago. He told me to tell u to look in ur jacket pocket or something...
<br /><br />Girl: ummm ok
<br /><br />[She finds a piece of paper in tha jacket, It says...]
<br /><br />Baby i hope u find this before u read my letter. I knew ur dad might read it, so i switched a few words...
<br /><br />Hate = Love
<br /><br />Never = Alwayz
<br /><br />Bitch = Baby
<br /><br />Will not= will
<br /><br />........ I hope u didnt take that seriously because i love you with all my heart, and it was so hard to let you go thats y i wanted u to run away with me...
<br /><br />-Kyle
<br /><br />Girl: omg its a letter, Kyle does love me!!, he must of slipped it into my pocket when he hugged me. I cant believe how stupid I am!!

<br />Girl: &quot;Can we do what?&quot;
<br />Guy: &quot;You know, can I be your first, finally?&quot;
<br />Girl: &quot;Um.....no.&quot;
<br />Guy: &quot;Why?&quot;
<br />Girl: &quot;Because, 1. you have a girlfriend, who happens to be my friend.......&quot;
<br />Guy: &quot;So, if you don't tell, I won' tell.&quot;
<br />Girl: &quot;Besides that, I'm waiting for someone special. Someone that I want to be with for the rest of my life to be my first.&quot;
<br />Guy: &quot;I'm not special to you?&quot;
<br />Girl: &quot;You're my friend. That's all.&quot;
<br />Guy looks forward and keeps driving. 5 minutes pass....... Guy starts to run his hand up the girl's thigh.
<br />Girl: moves his hand, &quot;Don't touch me!&quot;
<br />Guy: tries to kiss her.
<br />Girl: screams, &quot;Would you stop.&quot;
<br />Guy: continues trying.
<br />Girl: moves to the back seat
<br />Guy: parks on an abandoned street and gets in the backseat with the girl
<br />Starts to kiss her..
<br />Girl: pushes him off and scoots over, &quot;Please, don't do this.&quot;
<br />Guy: &quot;Don't do what, I know you want it, I can see it in your eyes.&quot;
<br />Moves over to her and starts to unbutton her pants.
<br />Girl: pushes him harder and says, &quot;No, don't.&quot;
<br />Guy: getting aggravated, punches her and tells her to stop &quot;playing hard to get&quot;.
<br />Girl: crying, continues to fight.
<br />Guy: punches her harder, pulls her pants off, and holds her down.
<br />Girl: screams as he penetrates her, &quot;NO, please don't do this to me!&quot;
<br />Guy: puts his hand over her mouth.
<br />An hour passes.........
<br />Guy: pulls back and wipes himself off.
<br />Girl: sits on the corner of the seat, sobbing.
<br />Guy: looks at her and says, &quot;You better not tell anybody about this. If you're really my friend, you won't tell anybody. You know I love you.&quot; He reaches out his hand to touch her cheek.
<br />Girl: pulls back, &quot;Just take me home, now.&quot;
<br />Guy: says, &quot;Alright.&quot; Gets in the front seat and drives her home.
<br />2 months later.........
<br />Girl: &quot;Doctor, what's wrong with me. I haven't had my time of the month in 2 months.&quot;
<br />Doctor: looks at her, &quot;You haven't been having your &quot;time&quot; for a reason.&quot;
<br />Girl: looks at him and says, &quot;Why?&quot; dreading the answer that she was sure to receive.
<br />Doctor: &quot;You are pregnant.&quot;
<br />Girl: faints.
<br /><br />The story gets out that she is pregnant, and people start looking to the guy. He claims that it isn't his because she was sleeping with every guy in the school(which was a lie). He goes to her and tells her, &quot;I'm telling you, if you lie to people and say that I raped you, I'll kill you.&quot;
<br /><br />The Girl is completely devastated. First, he took her virginity and got her pregnant....then he lied about it. So completely depressed......the girl commits suicide by drug overdose.......
<br />Girls, if this story touched you, repost it as &quot;That's Fucked up&quot;
<br />Guys, if this story touched you, repost it as &quot;I'll kill any fucker who does this&quot; if you care
