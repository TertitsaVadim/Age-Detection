There was a time when I could pass a year at school with a branded pair of shoe. But now, I doubt that,&quot; said Razon Mirdha, an apparel businessman. Mirdha said he bought a pair of a branded shoe last year, but the experience was not good. &quot;It lasted only three months. It's peculiar but I don't think it happens in every case.&quot; slam said some people claim the quality of all kinds of shoes has declined. &quot;It is true in some cases. Some branded shoe providers are now selling imported Chinese shoes under the same names. The quality of these shoes is not as good.&quot;Regular shoes and shoes on sale have separate buyers. &quot;Big players in the field, like Bata and Apex, are not our competitors. And everyone does not buy the shoes that are on sale,&quot; Islam said. There are some people who buy shoes 'on sale' and think the pair would last as long as a brand new one. How could that be possible?&quot;Usually   <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5zaG9lLWNsb3RoaW5nLWNoaW5hLmNvbS9uaWtlLXByb2R1Y3RzLW5pa2UtcmlmdC1tZW4tYy04MThfMTgzOS5odG1s" target="_blank">nike rift</a>
<br /> businessmen sell their stocks from last season or faulty products on sale. &quot;You can't expect a defective shoe to have the same lifeline of a new one. And no one should compare these shoes to the new ones,&quot; Islam added. 
<br />shoes on sale, it is your responsibility from now on.&quot; &quot;If the shoes are not faulty, how could you expect to buy a 1,500-taka shoe at 1,100 taka?&quot; &quot;But on other shoes, we give one month guarantee. If anything happens to a new shoe inside a month by purchase, we testament either repair or substitute it.&quot;
