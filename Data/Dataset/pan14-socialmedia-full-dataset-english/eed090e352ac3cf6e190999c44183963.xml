In addition, high-speed road vehicle are stained with a variety of small flying insects, washing vehicles is necessary.Check the power system: after travelling long distances, high speed, high load operation of the engine to meet the challenge, so you want to focus on check engine oil, radiator antifreeze. If it is a automatic shift cars, also ATP check gearbox oil loss, excessive consumption should be filled in a timely manner. If the self-driving tour and travel long, returning the best replacement engine oil, since the days of high temperatures of the engine work may cause oil deterioration; in addition to also check the engine belt is loose, so as not to affect road safety in the future.

Best security check prior to departure, the appropriate choice of winter tires will make your vehicle perform better in the cold season. ”Before you start, solid Platinum tire users in the following three checks on the vehicle:Tire pressure – consult your vehicle's owner's manual or on the nameplate, above should indicate the ideal tire pressure vehicle. Many will mistakenly callout number on the side wall is the ideal tire pressure tires--in fact it was the tire can sustain the maximum tire pressure. Low tire inflation might result in excessive burden on tires and cause damage to the tire; excessive inflatable readily tire balance does not operate, reduce tire grip, maneuverability and braking performance degradation caused by dangerous.Durable diesel parts are served in the online shop ( http://www.starsdiesel.net/) now!

Especially when working in the control valve, the system pressure transients, fatigue deformation of control valve spring failure, which can increase noise. Therefore, you should review the usage of the control valve, check the tie even for wear and tear, napping, check whether the spring failure, replacement parts, if necessary.Third reason is mechanical steering pump noise caused by vibration. Therefore, when you install the steering pump, ensure that the pump shaft is coaxial with the host error is less than 0.1mm, inclination less than 30 connecting pipe not too small too long, to minimize the elbow, avoid Vortex liquid. Steering pump speed also should not be too high, preventing damage to bearings.Durable diesel parts are offered in the online shop ( http://www.starsdiesel.net/) now!EML: ellin@starsdiesel.com.

The main reasons for this phenomenon are: 
<br /><br />(1) If the injection time of late, when leaking fuel injector fuel injection, injection pressure is too low, poor atomization, when the machine was too late combustion temperature is too low to be discharged to the form of white smoke. Approach, the correction of fuel injection time, check the injector conditions. 
<br /><br />(2) lack of pressure within the cylinder. The cylinder liner, piston ring wear components, and the bad valve seals, causing the engine to take gray smoke when first started, and then with the machine temperature rise, into a light smoke or black smoke. Approach is to replace the worn cylinder liner, piston ring or valve repair, valve seat ring. 
<br /><br />(3) diesel in the water. If, after the engine started emitting smoke gray, with the machine temperature rise, gray smoke still exists, then it may be too much diesel fuel mixed with water. Solution is to start a day before the fuel tank drain valve is opened, the bottom sediment and water discharge out. 
<br /><br />To sum up, the engine exhaust exception is a comprehensive reflection of internal fault. Therefore, the engine exhaust to determine the normal working condition or not is an important indicator of good or bad one, if untreated, can guarantee the ideal engine to use, to avoid unnecessary economic losses.

<br /><br />First, the reasons for the uneven supply fuel pump 
<br /><br />1.

<br /><br />Fuel pump is in the test stand at room temperature for debugging, and the installed capacity is the use of compression in the cylinder end, the cylinder temperature of 500 to 700 ??, 3 to 5 MPa pressure under the conditions of use, the difference is greater. Locomotive operation, the fuel pump and injector temperature reached 90 ??, causing diesel will decrease the viscosity, thus plunger and the needle-and the leakage increased to fuel more than debugging. According to the determination of the actual injection pump the fuel Nozzle DLLA142P1709 is injected into the cylinder test rig commissioning of only about 80%, although the pump debugging staff will consider diesel nozzle this factor, but it is impossible to accurately grasp. In addition, since the piston and the cylinder valve train wear or confined in varying degrees, the cylinder compression pressure and the temperature will be a difference. Even if the test stand debugging good fuel pump installation, use, the cylinder volume of oil will produce uneven.

Some medium-sized enterprises, relying on strict management, and the cheap labor and better quality, in recent years has been achieved better economic results, such as Shandong Xin Asia, Heze, stars, Yangzhou, Jiangsu, such as pumps Choke Sihong plant. At present fuel systems industry 70 Nozzle 0433172047 (not including the large and medium-sized pump Choke rough parts of the plant for the small private enterprises), the entire industry has a total workforce of 40,000 people, the 2003 annual sales of 4.19 billion yuan income than in 2002 4.12 billion yuan of 1.7 percent growth. 2003 industry-wide multi-cylinder fuel injection pump produced a total of Nozzle 0 433 172 047 1.973 million units, and the 2002-1988000 dropped 0.75 percent three-and 82.48 million, in 2002 increased by 78.215 million 5.5%. 2003 heavy-duty trucks to meet with the P-type pump (including PW, P7, PB, PN, P7100, etc.) amounted to 480,000 units, and in 2002 the 458,000-an increase of 4.8 Nozzle DLLA142P1709 per cent in Common Rail Nozzle DLLA142P1709 2003 VE distribution pump output soared to 77,000 units, and in 2002 the 51,200-an increase of 50 per cent, domestic VE pump because of increased distribution of the technological diesel nozzle transformation efforts and continuously improve product quality, are gradually replace imported products to capture light truck market.

Fuel pressure sensor should go to the systemic pressure. If you do not know the fuel pressure system to consult the manual repair of the car. The pressure in the fuel system Nozzle 0 433 172 047 will be very small, but close enough to the specification.
<br /><br />Then turn the engine fuel system pressure should remain unchanged. Watching the meter addition to the gas pressure in the fuel system should move about 5 pounds per square inch. If the fuel pressure regulator system does not respond to the fuel pressure failed. If fuel pressure decreases the fuel filter or fuel pump is connected to fail. Nozzle 0433172047 After the test, remove injector nozzle the fuel pressure sensor cord and replace the lid.
<br /><br />Check the combusted fuel pressure regulator diaphragm. Fuel pressure regulator is used in a fuel injection system. This diesel nozzle function adjusts fuel pressure from the diaphragm and spring combinations. When the rupture pressure fuel regulator diaphragm allows raw fuel supply line vacuum system and then entering the engine. This condition creates a rich, black smoke from the exhaust pipe when you start and Nozzle DLLA142P1709 run simultaneously.
