<br />I'd have chosen you to be in my life

<br />You took all my tears away.
<br />I was happy to be with you,
<br />Proud to be your girl.
<br />Sometimes we would argue,
<br />But to me you meant the world.
<br />Your love was always pure;
<br />You treated me as your own.
<br />Your time seemed all too short and
<br />I feel so alone.
<br />What can I take from this?
<br />My heart is completely crushed.
<br />But nothing loved is ever lost -
<br />And you are loved so much. </strong></em>

<br />Another day has begun.
<br /><br />But still no sleep has come.
<br />My body is weary
<br /><br />My mind overworked.
<br />I lie awake thinking
<br /><br />But what I am unsure.
<br />I need to break free from the cycle I endure.
<br /><br /><strong><em>Everyday is the same and the nights are undistinguished.
<br />I feel as though I am being pushed along with the tide
<br /><br />Unable to break free from the everyday flow.
<br />This is not me I need to change, before time takes over
<br /><br />And I am unable to change.
<br />I need to be freed from the grasp of ordinary
<br /><br />And become that person I have always longed for.
<br />Express myself in every way, and conquer the dreams as I lie awake.
<br /><br />Then I may fall asleep and put my mind to rest.
<br />Make changes in my life and help those in need.
<br /><br />I would like to touch everyone's life in a positive way
<br />And leave my mark on society before I fade away</em>.</strong>

<br /><em><strong>I will think of you
<br />after all your just the dirt
<br />grinding up in my shoe.
<br /><br />How much I hate you now
<br />for all the things you done
<br />for you could never know
<br />because I hate you a ton.
<br /><br />You make my heart bleed
<br />every time I see your face
<br />and my fist tighten
<br />when I think of this waste.
<br /><br />Rage fills my soul
<br />every time I hear your name
<br />anger fills my mind
<br />knowing nothing can be the same.
<br /><br />I'm still building back up 
<br />after you tore off all ties
<br />but I tell you it is for the better
<br />because I'm sick of your stupid lies.
<br /><br />Pity yourself all you want
<br />I don't care anymore
<br />but I tell you time heals all wounds
<br />and complaining is becoming a bore.
<br /><br />Your not fooling anyone 
<br />when you come to school with your stupid smile
<br />we all can see you're faking
<br />because time takes awhile.
<br /><br />Why do you expect everyone
<br />to look at you as they walk by
<br />your know different then anyone
<br />this is something you don't understand why.
<br /><br />I am not stupid
<br />so quit and leave me alone
<br />quit calling me a stupid b**ch
<br />and live your life on your own.
<br /><br />You are no part of me
<br />your the one that broke all ties
<br />I don't give a damn anymore
<br />I'm sick of you keep saying your goodbyes.
<br /><br />Give up already
<br />because you're really getting me pissed
<br />I don't care what you think of me
<br />so would you learn to let me be.
<br /><br />Stop calling me a b**ch behind my back
<br />your just mad because I now don't want to be your friend
<br />I didn't want to give up but you gave me no choice
<br />so now I gave &quot;the queen her highness&quot; the end.
<br /><br />I'm sick of you
<br />you hurt me more then you think I hurt you
<br />stop blaming me for what has happened
<br />because I'm sick of feeling this pain by the things you say and do.
<br /><br />Why do you even care
<br />can't you just ignore
<br />after all your the one that can't forgive
<br />this is really becoming a bore.
<br /><br />Come up with something new
<br />after all it will just be another lie
<br />but at least you will have something else to do
<br />besides always saying goodbye.
<br /><br />Blah blah
<br />I don't care
<br />will you please just end this now
<br />because I'm sick of you saying I wasn't there.
<br /><br />Stop taking things out on me
<br />this is something you could never see
<br />its the truth though I tell you
