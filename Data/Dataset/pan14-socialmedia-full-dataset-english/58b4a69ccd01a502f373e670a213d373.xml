Once only found in estates and high-end commercial establishments, quartz brings life to any surface. Suitable for all rooms of the home as well as commercial applications natural quartz is a durable and low maintenance solution for high style decorating.<br /><br />Quartz grows in crystalline clusters; therefore solid slabs do not actually exist. Manufacturers of quartz tiles and counter-tops grind the crystals in to smaller bits. The crystals are then packed along with pigments and resins into moulds configured for tiles or counter-top slabs. Quartz tiles and counter-tops are made up of 93% crystal bonded with the resins used to create a cohesive unit, or slab of the smaller crystal chips.<br /><br />Quartz in the Kitchen<br />Kitchens are germ factories; quartz has natural anti-microbial properties making it a natural choice for kitchen counter-tops. This non-porous natural stone when combined with resins can be buffed to a high gloss finish to reflect ambient light back into the room; creating a subtle glow. <br /><br />Black quartz tiles can take the place of granite on counter-tops, or be combined with white quartz tiles for a dramatic and stunning chequerboard kitchen floor. During to the manufacturing process pigments can be added to the natural crystals creating a colourful array of dazzling and sparkling surfaces.<br /><br />Quartz in the Bathroom<br />Beautiful and water resistant when sealed; quartz is a natural choice for bathroom walls and floors. Strength and durability lends to multiple surface applications. Create a feature wall using neutral toned mosaic tiles, with a light complimentary grout; take those same tiles and produce a dramatic focal point using high contract grout in an accent colour. Quartz chips are the go to choice for light reflective mosaics and creative tile picture features.<br /><br />The ultimate in white, white quartz tiles shine; light dances off the many reflective surfaces of the polished stones. Black quartz tiles can be used in areas traditionally off limits to darker floor or wall tiles with their glittering light reflective capabilities. Combine white and black quartz tiles for a classic estate foyer and entry hall; or tone them down with pigments for more subtle and natural illuminated flooring.<br /><br />Natural durability, combined with the tile manufacturing process, makes quartz an ideal choice for exterior applications. Bring the outdoors in or the indoors out with a continuous flow of flooring materials from the breakfast room to the patio. Impress yourself, and your guests with the creative use of beautiful and versatile natural quartz. <br /><br />For  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.buytiles.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.buytiles.com</a>  or  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.buytiles.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.buytiles.com</a> .

You can use Laura Ashley tiles in a variety of ways to make your own custom creation. <br /><br />Tub Surrounds<br /><br />Tile is ideal for walls around tubs and showers since this area is exposed to a lot of moisture. You can cover over plasterboard with ceramic wall tiles to protect the surface, while giving the room a whole new look. You can use all one colour, or purchase two colours and create a custom border around regular coloured tile.<br /><br />Other options include making your own mosaic on the wall. For this project, you’ll need at least two different colours of tile. They can be arranged in a random pattern on the wall, or you can have a more rigid mosaic – the choice is up to you!<br /><br />Kitchen Back-splashes<br /><br />Ceramic tiles make a great surface for a kitchen back-splash, either behind the sink, or behind the stove area. Laura Ashley tiles are very easy to keep clean. All they require is a quick pass-over with a damp sponge. One great technique for interesting kitchen back-splashes is to alternate the colour of tile used to create a chequerboard effect. You can also use more decorative tiles in the centre of the back-splash, surrounded by solid colour tiles.<br /><br />Accent Walls in Kitchens and Bathrooms<br /><br />Instead of painting an accent wall in a kitchen or a bathroom, you can use Laura Ashley wall tiles to create a unique accent wall. Tiling an entire wall isn’t much different than doing a back-splash or a small area, just a few more tiles and mortar are all that are required. As well as a bit more time and effort.<br /><br />For an interesting effect, use this ceramic tile behind the sink area and create a small accent wall. This technique works particularly well if you have a decorative pedestal sink and will draw the eye to this feature in the bathroom, making it stand out. <br /><br />Ceramic Tile Counter-tops<br /><br />Tile counter-tops in kitchens and bathrooms are easy to keep clean and give you more decorative options in this space. Rather than using laminate or costly marble, you can create a unique counter. Lay out an interesting design using several different tile designs, or keep to just one colour for an elegant and refined look.<br /><br />The options are endless when it comes to using ceramic tiles in the kitchen or bath. Let your own creativity guide you or find your inspiration in today’s design magazines or shows and apply your own unique twist to their ideas. Installing tiles is easier than you think and the after effect is more than worth the initial installation effort. <br /><br />For all information on  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.buytiles.com%2Ftiles-by-material%2Fceramic.php"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.buytiles.com/tiles-by-material/ceramic.php</a>  or  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.buytiles.com%2Ftiles-by-material%2Fceramic.php"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.buytiles.com/tiles-by-material/ceramic.php</a> .

Make your home your own, and make a personal statement. All you really need to do is to get creative with wall and floor tiles. They are easy to install, inexpensive, and will add an extremely personal touch to your home.<br /><br />Tiles do not have to be put into boring symmetrical patterns. You can do chequerboard designs, random designs, op-art designs, or whatever you like. You can spell out words or you can create pictures of people, places, or things. The possibilities are limitless; be creative and you never know what you might be able to come up with.<br /><br />There are many different types of tiles that you might want to work with. The first to consider is mosaic tiles. These can be purchased in either large squares, usually about twelve inches square, or individual tiles, less than one inch square. You can use either kind, or you can mix and match. <br /><br />I once did an entire bathroom wall with mosaic tile. I spelled out the name of everyone in the family, and below the name, I installed a hook. That way everyone had a spot for his or her own towel.<br /><br />Sparkly tiles are another type to consider. I absolutely love these in the kitchen. These are manufactured to resemble stone, but they have a sparkle built in that reflects light with a glittery appearance. Black is a favourite of mine. They create an elegance that will truly impress anyone who visits your home.<br /><br />Not only can sparkly tiles be used on the floor, but they also make a great wall covering. Forget about ever having to paint again. Once installed, these will virtually last a lifetime. And if you want a truly seductive bedroom for those special trysts, there is no better way to do it than with sparkly tiles.<br /><br />Another type to consider is travertine tiles. These are natural stone tiles that are cut and finished to give your home an elegance that will be the envy of all your friends. Perfect for an entryway or a living room, you can use these virtually anywhere. They come in a variety of colours and patterns, and are amazingly easy to install. Even if you choose to not do the work yourself, most professional installers can do it in less than a day. My favourite place for these is in the living room, in front of a fireplace. Add a bear skin rug, and you have the ideal location for pleasant evenings at home with that someone special.<br /><br />Make your home your own. Get creative with wall and floor tiles and have a home that you will cherish and will be the envy of your friends and family. <br /><br />For information on popular tiles. Make sure to visit us!

Give your bathroom a budget conscious makeover in less than two weekends. Bathroom tiles for the floor create interest, colour, design and style all wrapped up in a practical and extremely utilitarian surface. Take it one step further with the use of subdued or colourful bathroom wall tiles.<br /><br />The Floor<br />Bathrooms are wet environments. Ceramic tiles are the perfect choice for showers, flooring, and walls, with the trend in open concept wet rooms. When choosing ceramic bathroom tiles for the floor, choose non-slip finishes; they are glazed in a manner, which when wet, will not be extremely slippery, ensuring safety in the damp environment. Smaller ones with more grout lines will enhance the anti-slip properties of wet room floors. <br /><br />Flooring is one of the smaller surface areas in most bathrooms; therefore you can go for bold and high style flooring without breaking the budget. Ceramic tiles come in as many colours as are available in your imagination. Hand painted or faux stone, ceramics invite creativity. Design a “rug” in front of the vanity or shower entrance using field and border tiles. Create drama using contrasting tiles set on the diagonal; a lot of tile cutting, but well worth the effort. <br /><br />The Walls<br />Take your flooring right up the walls to the ceiling, or stop at chair rail height. Tiling a bathroom wall is a great choice for open concept bathrooms where the shower is only partially enclosed. Additionally, bathroom wall tiles make for smart design choices and easy clean-up. Floor pieces will work on any wall, however those designed for the wall will never work on a floor. Wall tiles are lighter and thinner than those for the floor and will not withstand the weight of foot traffic. Choose the floor first, and then choose bathroom wall tiles to compliment the flooring.<br /><br />Use complimentary or contrasting wall tiles in varying styles, colours and sizes to create a faux chair rail or border line. Standard chair rail height is 36 inches; adjust this height to accommodate full tiles to eliminate cutting. Choose borders to express your personal style. If you choose a 6” x 6” neutral cream or beige wall tile, you might consider a border of cobalt blue glazed 3” tiles for your border; adjusting placement slightly to keep grout lines symmetrical.<br /><br />Choose smaller tiles with subtle colour to create a serene spa like atmosphere. Large bathrooms can easily accept more aggressive colour and pattern choices without becoming overwhelmed. Ceramic tiles are a great choice when colour or budget do not allow for natural stone; ceramic is easier to install and requires less specialized cutting tools. Ceramic bathroom tiles can enhance the décor of any bathroom. <br /><br />For a huge range of  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.buytiles.com%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.buytiles.com/</a>  at great prices visit BuyTiles.com.

But with the right tools and the right information it is a doable project for the average Do It Yourself-er. The first two steps are to make sure you have the right kitchen tiles, tools and grout. Of course you will need gloves, a dust mask, safety glasses and knee-pads. You will also need a pry bar for removing the old tiles. Other tools include pencil, tape measure, scrapers, slip-joint pliers, spacers, mortar adhesive, a bucket and a sponge. You will also need a trowel for applying and smoothing the grout and a wet saw for cutting the tiles. <br /><br />Now it’s time to get into the actual work. Remove all the appliances and furniture from the kitchen and take the moulding off around the edge. Remove the flooring and scrape off any old adhesive. Next find the middle of the room. It is important that you lay tiles from the centre so that any adjustments can be made at the outer edges of the floor. Use the wet saw to cut tiles to the size you need, then lay the tiles onto the floor in the pattern you want. <br /><br />The next step is to mix up some of the mortar adhesive. Remove a few tiles from the centre and spread a thin layer of mortar on each one. Work quickly because the mortar will start to set up in about 30 minutes. Be sure and use rubber spacers to keep the tiles evenly spaced. Press each tile down firmly to get a good fit. It’s very important to keep the tiles clean with a damp sponge as you go. <br /><br />Let the tiles settle for a couple days before putting on the grout. Remove the rubber spacers, put a pile of grout near the middle of the floor, work the grout into the spaces, then use the trowel to scrape off the excess grout. Wipe off the any more grout from the tiles with a wet sponge. Use lots of clean water and make sure that all this excess is washed off the tiles. <br /><br />When the floor is clean, run a bead of sealant around the edge of the floor and replace the mouldings. Be sure you use a sealant that matches the colour of the grout. After the floor has been down for a week or two, you can apply a tile sealer that will keep the floor tiles looking new. <br />If you're planning on laying new  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.buytiles.com%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.buytiles.com/</a> , visit BuyTiles.com for a huge range of  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.buytiles.com%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.buytiles.com/</a>  at great prices.

This process will vary to a certain degree depending on the type of tile that is already there. It may be just regular plain tile, perhaps slate tiles, you never know. Perhaps the most difficult type to remove will a thin linoleum bathroom floor tile.<br /><br />The easiest bathroom floor tile to remove would most likely be a thick stone or slate tile. These will have a small amount of grout between the tiles and each will be separate from the other. A chisel can be placed at a 45 degree angle to a tile and given a small tap with a hammer. After a few taps, the tile should start to come up. If it is coming up slowly, try decreasing the angel to around 30 degrees. <br /><br />Try to damage the wood under the floor tile as little as possible. Linoleum may be difficult because it is so thin as compared to an actual “tile.” You can use an utility knife to slightly score the linoleum somewhere in the middle of the floor and give your self a starting place. The linoleum will most likely come up in pieces, depending on the age of the flooring.<br /><br />Once the old flooring is up, you will most likely be left with a non-smooth surface covered in bits of the old adhesive. There may be a few gouges in the wood where you or a previous person have damaged the wood a bit while removing tile. Paint thinner or an adhesive remover can be used to clean the wood. Most bathrooms are going to be fairly enclosed, so be aware of ventilation, using fans to keep fumes from building up. Do not be afraid to take frequent breaks to catch your breath, these fumes can be very dangerous.<br /><br />Before beginning the application of new bathroom floor tiles, make sure that you have two work areas. The bathroom itself will be one work area, and there should be another where tiles can be measured and cut. Slate tile or ceramic tile will need to be cut with a table saw and with the appropriate saw blade. It is important to keep the tile from getting too hot when cutting them and to keep the dust from the tiles under control. This can be done by applying a small amount of water to the cutting surface while using the saw.<br />From the doorway, workout the centreline an  make sure this is square. Start laying the tiles from the centre of this centreline and work out towards the walls. You will find you'll have to cut probably all the tiles as you near the walls and although time consuming, this is the best method. Don't be tempted to start laying the tiles at one wall and work towards the other as one they are all laid, they won't look 'centred'. Remember, if a job is worth doing it's worth doing well.<br /><br />If you're planning on laying  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.buytiles.com%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.buytiles.com/</a> , visit BuyTiles.com to see our full range of bathroom wall and floor tiles including marble, granite, ceramic and  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.buytiles.com%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.buytiles.com/</a> .

There are numerous differences in these three styles, depending solely on the type of materials from which they are made. For instance, bone china is made with fragments of animal bones to give it a more sturdy consistency. It is said that the first porcelain was actually made in China during the period of the Tang dynasty. To this day porcelain is still made in the City of Jingdezhen and has been since the 1300's. <br /><br />By the early 1100's Europe, Japan and Korea became heavily involved in the porcelain making process. Although readily used today, back then it was an expensive product which many people could not afford. It was in the 1600's that porcelain became popular with the common public. The art of tea drinking in fancy cups and saucers, made from hard paste porcelain became common and drove the demand for the product. <br /><br />When porcelain tiles were first introduced in the 1700's, they were considered to be very expensive and mostly used in churches or stately homes. It was countries like Portugal, Spain, France, Germany and Great Britain, which were main manufactures in ceramic tiles. As things progressed prices made them more available to the general public. People began using ceramic kitchen tiles to decorate a once bland kitchen. They would use them around fireplaces, in bathrooms and to help decorate their homes. Because of their durability, they were soon becoming a popular way to add charm and sophistication to their homes. <br /><br />In the 19th century, the entire process for making porcelain tiles and ceramic tiles changed. With advances in machinery and technology the process became simplified and therefore, prices became more affordable to the common man. The introduction of wallpaper, changed the way people felt about tiles and soon they became an item that was not of interest. But like true history, things rotated and tiles once again gained in popularity. Today when an old home is destroyed, it is often the tiles that are saved and reused. The process by which ancient tiles were made cannot compare to the simplistic process which we have today. The colours and the work that went into each and every tile was amazing. <br /><br />There is no greater look than having ceramic kitchen tiles. One can use them as a nice back-splash or on the kitchen floor. They are easy to clean and come in a wide variety of colours to match every home's décor. No wonder so many people love to decorate with ceramic and porcelain tiles.  <br /><br />Porcelian is still widely used in the manufacture wall and floor tiles.

Alternatively you could fit replacement kitchen doors and drawer fronts as simply changing these can have a dramatic effect on the look and feel of your kitchen. Modern manufacturing techniques allow for cheap kitchen doors to be made in a variety of designs and finishes and with such a large choice available, I’m certain you'll find something to suit both your taste and your budget. <br /><br />I have come across several disastrous budget kitchen make-overs which are best avoided, or at least approached with extreme caution. One home owner couldn't afford to replace all thirty or so cabinet doors and drawer fronts in their large kitchen, so instead they purchased half the amount of replacement kitchen doors and drawer fronts in a 'contrasting' finish with a view to replace every other door and drawer front, creating a chequered effect of sorts. In reality it just looked a mess, although the 'designer' felt it worked, the mishmash of two different shades and two different door designs looked like the whole kitchen was assembled from two job lots of cheap kitchen doors.<br /><br />Another disastrous kitchen make-over was when the owner decided it would be far more cost effective to paint their existing doors and drawer fronts instead of buying new ones in the colour they wanted. This cost cutting plan works on paper, possibly, but bearing in mind the melamine facing on the existing kitchen doors is non-porous, the paint would struggle to stick to it for any length of time. The reality of this budget make over was flaking white gloss paint covering what was a half decent wood effect door and it looked like they'd spend all of twenty minutes doing the lot. There are limits  to home improvements on a budget and this is certainly one of them. <br /><br />If you really are on a tight budget, you could consider putting a wanted add in the local newspaper in the hope that somebody else has bought replacement kitchen doors and want rid of their old ones. You could also try to source second hand or cheap kitchen doors on the internet, however make sure you have a good look before you buy as the pre-drilled hinge holes could be damaged, rendering the door useless. If you are looking to do a kitchen make over on a budget, then shop around for the best deals on new kitchen doors rather than painting them of going for a mix and match effect. It makes perfect sense and will be more cost effective in the long run.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5kb29yc2FuZGZpdHRpbmdzLmNvLnVr" target="_blank">Kitchen Doors</a> Can be found with us.

This was closely followed by cabinet door hinges and drawer runners and sparked the start of Blum's unrivalled innovations in the field. Now surely a hinge is just a hinge so there's little room for innovation, right? Wrong! Blum hinges are not only manufactured to the highest standards, giving many years of faultless service, they are also designed to operate smoothly, silently and effortlessly. Let's have a look at three innovative designs from Blum which puts them light years ahead of the competition. <br /><br />First up is Blumotion, a door buffer system designed to put a stop to the slamming of your cabinet doors. Blumotion is designed for use in conjunction with Blum hinges and provides an almost intuitive door closing system which seems to know exactly how much force needs to be dampened in order to ensure a cabinet door closes softly and silently every time. As versatility is as much a part of functionality, the Blumotion system can be fitted using a variety of adaptor plates or built in to the cabinet carcass itself allowing it to be used on almost any kitchen cabinet. <br /><br />Next we have Tip-On from Blum. This is a handle-less solution to both doors and drawers which allows for seamless furniture design, unblighted by handles or knobs. The Tip-On system works by simply pushing the door slightly which releases a magnetic catch and pops the door open. Closing the door is a simple case of pushing it shut and the magnetic catch will keep the door firmly closed.  Tip-On can be used in conjunction with almost any Blum hinge and many other non-Blum products, making it just as versatile as any other Blum product. <br /><br />Finally we have Aventos HK. This hinge system is designed specifically for cupboard doors which open vertically and as with other Blum hinges, the operation is effortless, silent and smooth. Unlike traditional vertical door hinges, the Aventos HK features a variable stop system which allows the height the door opens to be varied to suit its application. The design of the hinges themselves are low profile, sleek and streamlined and can be used in conjunction with the Blumotion buffer system to prevent the door from slamming shut when closed. <br /><br />Blum have been pioneering the design of hinges, doors and drawers for almost 60 years and will continue to be at the forefront of innovative design, no matter what they turn their hand to. <br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5kb29yc2FuZGZpdHRpbmdzLmNvLnVr" target="_blank">Blum hinges</a> are very popular worldwide!

However if you have a space in which to put a unit that is not one of the standard widths then you have two choices; either move the other units to make the gap 'standard' or build a bespoke kitchen unit which will fit the available space. If you're handy with a hammer and have a good selection of tools, then building your own kitchen base units should be reasonably straight forward. <br /><br />The first thing you need to do is measure the space available and this is where many DIYers go wrong. When measuring the space available measure the width at the top back as well as the width at the top front, and the same at the bottom. Chances are the space you're filling may not be square so by measuring four times rather than once, it will be obvious if the gap is not square. Make a note of these measurements and remember that your new unit will have to fit into the smallest width. No matter how tempted you are, don't try to build an out of square unit to fit an out of square space as this would over complicate the task and increase the chances of it going wrong.<br /><br />Next you need to draw a sketch of the proposed unit noting all the measurements and double checking them. Being certain of the measurements at the planning stage will save a lot of unnecessary hassle at the build and fit stage. The two most important tools in your tool box are your tape measure and your spirit level. If the completed unit is the wrong size and not level, then it will look like a bodged job, so make sure you measure twice and cut once rather than the other way around. Remember, you can't put wood back on; once it's cut it's cut. <br /><br />Fitting the kitchen doors to the unit is probably the trickiest part of building your own kitchen base unit. The hinges need to be perfectly in line or the doors wont open or close properly. One thing you should consider when building your own kitchen base units is that fitting replacement kitchen doors at a later stage is not really an option unless you've designed the unit with standard door sizes. Replacement kitchen doors are available in a variety of widths so have a look at what's available before you start to build. Even if the unit isn't standard sized, the kitchen doors could be 'off the shelf' and in this case, all the kitchen doors could match and nobody would know that behind them is a bespoke kitchen base unit.<br /><br />Would you like to see some great deals on <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5kb29yc2FuZGZpdHRpbmdzLmNvLnVr" target="_blank">Kitchen Doors</a>?

		<document id="e779e6c62d41ade609127e632bfb81c1" url=""><![CDATA[Buying New Kitchen Doors For Integrated Appliances On The We<br/><br/>Once upon a time we thought nothing of having our fridge and freezer, washing machine and dishwasher plainly visible amongst our kitchen units. However things are changing since the advent of 'integrated' kitchen appliances. These are specially designed appliances which are fitted with a door that matches the rest of your cabinet doors, creating a seamless design throughout your kitchen which isn't 'broken' by your white goods. Almost any new kitchen doors can be fitted to integrated appliances, which usually have the hinges ready and waiting for the door to be attached. When ordering the new kitchen doors for such appliances, make sure the correct width and height is available from the door manufacturer. <br /><br />Replacement kitchen doors are available in a wide variety of styles and colours and some excellent prices can be found if you look for new kitchen doors online instead of on the high street. When ordering the doors for your integrated appliances you have two options; with or without a false drawer. The false drawer is what many of us will have in front of the kitchen sink. It looks like a drawer but it's not. Most kitchens have a row of drawers beneath the worktops and a row of cupboards beneath those, however most appliances are the height of both the drawers and the cupboards, so in order to maintain a seamless design, the false drawer may be necessary. However with your appliances hidden away, you may prefer to have them behind a single full height door as this makes them easier to locate as integrated appliances do tend to play hide and seek in your kitchen.<br /><br />It's best to buy integrated appliances when you're redoing the entire kitchen, as trying to fit them into an existing kitchen may present a few problems. Firstly, the widths of various appliances are not as standard as the average kitchen unit so you cannot assume that a freezer or dishwasher will fit without having to do some shifting of the other units. Also, you may struggle to find a door which is the correct size for the appliance yet also matches the rest of your kitchen cabinet doors. In this case you may find yourself buying an entire room's worth of replacement kitchen doors. Many door manufacturers do cater for most integrated appliances, however one cannot be too careful as the last thing you want is to buy costly white goods which you cannot get the doors you want to fit. If you're buying kitchen doors online, it's always advisable to speak to the seller in person to double check the sizes and that they're suitable for the appliances in question.<br /><br />Would you like to see some great deals on <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5kb29yc2FuZGZpdHRpbmdzLmNvLnVr" target="_blank">Kitchen Doors</a>?

Although not compulsory, portable appliance testing is highly advisable as health and safety regulations do stress that all electrical equipment used in the workplace should be regularly checked to determine that it is safe for use. Although these regulations are aimed at shops, offices, schools, factories, workshops and sole traders working 'on-site', they also apply to anybody who uses electrical equipment for business purposes, and that includes working musicians and disc jockeys who bring their own electrical equipment into a venue. <br /><br />It's not uncommon these days for a venue manager to ask a performer, band or DJ for documentation stating that any electrical equipment used on their premises has had a PAT test at least within the last twelve months. Failure to provide any evidence of PAT testing has resulted in a booking being cancelled at the last minute, which is not good for the performer or the venue. The amount of equipment a DJ or band carries with them varies immensely. In some cases it's just a laptop computer to provide the music or backing track which is plugged into the in-house PA system. In other cases it's a full PA system, keyboard, guitar and bass amplifiers plus a lighting rig and projectors. <br /><br />Every single piece of electrical equipment which has a mains plug should really be safety tested regularly. This type of audio &amp; lighting equipment is likely to be frequently moved from one venue to another and in light of this, each appliance should be safety checked using a PAT tester far more frequently than once a year. Problems are more likely to arise when equipment is regularly unplugged, packed away, unpacked and set up on a daily or weekly basis. A PAT tester is an electronic device into which an appliance, such as an amplifier, record deck or CD player is plugged. The PAT tester will usually give a simple pass or fail result, with more advanced PAT testing devices giving more detailed information. <br /><br />Getting your equipment PAT tested isn't just to keep the owners or managers of a venue happy, as it has numerous benefits for the performers too. Having your equipment regularly tested minimises the chance of a fault developing prior to or during your act... and what could be worse? The singer starts singing and nothing comes out... the bass player sounds like he's using a fuzz box when he isn't, the band can be heard but not seen due to a fault in the lighting equipment or heaven forbid, your faulty equipment blows the electrical circuit in the entire building! There are many things which cannot be predicted but making sure your lighting, amplifiers, powered speakers and other audio equipment is in good condition by carrying out a regular PAT test does give peace of mind.<br /><br />Although PAT testing regulations don't specify that DJ's or live bands 'must' have their audio and lighting equipment PAT tested, it's highly advisable that you do as every band or DJ wants their performance to be 'electrifying' for all the right reasons!<br /><br />Do you want to find out more information about <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wYXQtdGVzdHMtdWsuY28udWs_" target="_blank">Pat Testing</a>?

As a landlord you are acting as a supplier of all the electrical equipment in a rented property such as the mains and lighting circuits along with any other electrical equipment supplied for your tenants to use. This includes everything from an electric oven and hob, the fridge and freezer down to toasters, kettles and so on. The landlord has a legal obligation to ensure all supplied equipment is safe for use and in light of this, it is highly recommended that all electrical appliances and circuits are tested by a qualified and experienced test electrician. Movable appliances should be tested either annually or between each tenant, whereas the mains wiring and lighting circuits should be tested at least every five years. <br /><br />In the unlikely event that a tenant is harmed by an electrical fault on your property, a landlord may be asked to prove 'due diligence'; showing that they have taken steps to ensure as far as is practical that the electrical circuits and appliances within their properties are safe for use. By adopting the services of a dedicated electrical testing company, proving 'due diligence' is a simple case of presenting their test records. However where a dedicated electrical testing company has not been used, a landlord may struggle to prove that they have taken steps to ensure their properties are safe. <br /><br />For landlords of rented accommodation, it is recommended that you keep the supplied appliances down to a bare minimum. Tenants can easily supply their own kettle or microwave oven, as well as their own TV, DVD, hair-dryer and other 'non-essential' appliances and by doing so, the landlord is not liable for the safe working condition of such appliances. However for the owners of rented holiday homes, caravans and boats, where supplying everything from a clothes iron to a washing machine is considered the norm, it is essential to get each and every one of the supplied electrical appliances properly tested as they would be liable should an electrical fault cause injury or harm. <br /><br />Electrical safety testing consists of both portable appliance testing and fixed wire testing. When properly conducted, both a visual inspection and an electrical test is carried out to ensure the safe working condition of both appliances and wiring. The visual inspection can highlight potential issues which an electrical test cannot detect; for example, areas of cabling may be subject to stress long before they become hazardous and a proper visual inspection can pre-empt a variety of hazards. By detecting and rectifying such things before they become a hazard can effectively prevent electric shock, a potential fire or even death.<br /><br />For Information on <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wYXQtdGVzdHMtdWsuY28udWs_" target="_blank">Electrical Testing</a> or <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wYXQtdGVzdHMtdWsuY28udWsvRml4ZWQtRWxlY3RyaWNhbC1UZXN0aW5nLw__" target="_blank">Fixed Wire testing</a>, visit us.

This usually involves getting a qualified PAT tester to visit your workplace at regular intervals to test each piece of 'portable' electrical equipment to ensure it is safe for use in the workplace. However did you know that you could carry out all your own portable appliance testing?<br /><br />There are a number of PAT training courses available up and down the country which usually run for one or two days. These courses will teach you how to properly test electrical appliances using a variety of popular PAT testers; these being the electronic devices used to test portable appliances. The courses also cover the legal requirements for portable appliance testing, the frequency between testing certain types of portable electrical equipment, as well as keeping proper records and correctly labelling the tested equipment. <br /><br />One of the main benefits of conducting your own portable appliance testing is that you can work around the premises testing equipment when it is most convenient. For example, electrical equipment can be tested when it's main user is on their lunch break or after they've left for the day which minimises disruption to workflow. Using a pass/fail PAT tester is very straight forward and takes up very little time to test a single appliance. These devices are ideal for 'in-house' PAT testing as each appliance tested is given either a pass or a fail; unlike the more advanced PAT testers there is no complex data to analyse. Any appliance given a fail must be labelled as such and removed from use, whereas appliances given a pass are labelled as such and may return to normal use within the workplace. <br /><br />The disadvantages of conducting your own PAT testing are numerous. For one, the courses are far from free and a good quality PAT tester may also burn a hole in your pocket, and getting it regularly calibrated is another added expense. As a business owner, you're likely to be busy enough without taking on all the appliance testing for your premises too. Although testing a single appliance is relatively quick, testing every single appliance could take many days in a large office or workshop. Time spent testing is time which could be spent doing other essential tasks and your time does not come free. A dedicated PAT tester will work quickly, methodically and aim to keep any disruption to normal working practices to a minimum. In a nutshell, they do it quicker and better.<br /><br />Another major disadvantage of doing your own testing, or more accurately, a major advantage of getting a qualified and experienced electrician to carry out your portable appliance testing is that some appliances could be repaired on-site making them safe for use once more. An inexperienced, yet 'trained' PAT tester could easily waste hundreds or thousands of pounds by rendering repairable equipment unsafe, whereas an experienced test electrician will be using advanced testing equipment which deliver fault diagnosis data rather than a simple pass or fail. By replacing a fuse or power cable could be all it needs to make a failed appliance pass the test.<br /><br />When all is taken into account; the cost of the course, the time taken out of your schedule attending the course, the cost of the testing equipment and the time spent conducting the tests, not to mention the potential costs of 'failed' equipment being replaced which could be repaired by an experienced electrical engineer... in-house PAT testing may not be the cost effective solution you thought it was. By hiring a dedicated PAT testing company leaves you free to concentrate on running your business whilst giving you peace of mind that all your electrical equipment has been properly tested and is safe for use. <br /><br />Make sure you visit us for information on <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wYXQtdGVzdHMtdWsuY28udWs_" target="_blank">Pat Testing</a>.
