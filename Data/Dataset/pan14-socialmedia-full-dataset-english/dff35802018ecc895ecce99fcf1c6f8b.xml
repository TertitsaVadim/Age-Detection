Aquino did for our country, went out on the streets to endure the rains and heat of the sun to pay last respect to the lady who restored our democracy. Those in their homes like me, were glued infront of our televisions to watch the footages of the final rights.I salute the four honor guards for the extraordinary discipline they exhibited during the funeral procession of late President Cory Aquino which lasted for almost nine (9) long hours . Army Pfc. Antonio Cadiente, Airman Second Class Gener Laguindan, Navy Petty Officer 3 Edgardo Rodriguez and Police Officer 1 Danilo Maalab, who served as honor guards for Mrs. Aquino’s remains, displayed exceptional discipline in the performance of their extraordinary task.For me, even They’re specially trained to undertake such ceremonial duties, specially to bear such difficult task to be immobile,I warmly extend my admiration to the four honor guards for showing such an exemplary deeds.
<br />I think those four honor guards during the burial were magnificent men of honor and duty. they stood there for 9 hours, snappy and straight without rest through heavy rain, dryness, bumps on the road and inclines., and also I think think these gentlemen of the military deserve the highest honor and commendation,while the country witnessed the final journey of the democratic icon from the Manila Cathedral in Intramuros to the Manila Memorial Park in Paranaque City despite the inclement weather.The four honor guards boarded the truck at past 11 a.m. when police generals, acting as pallbearers, carried Aquino’s wooden casket out of the cathedral after the more than two-hour Requiem Mass.They got off the truck past 8 p.m. when they reached Manila Memorial Park where the revered People Power heroine was laid to rest next to her martyred husband, former Sen. Benigno “Ninoy” Aquino Jr.
<br />&quot;ON BEHALF OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE WE SALUTE YOU FOR A JOB WELL DONE&quot;
<br />LANZ

<br /><br />Allow me to make a humble “thank you” note 
<br />For all the people who remembered me and wrote. 
<br />For those who left messages everywhere and bothered 
<br />And those wonderful friends who chatted and lingered. 
<br />You who took time out from your otherwise busy day 
<br />You who stopped awhile, left me a message and did say, 
<br />My dear friend, Lanz, I wish you a very “Happy Birthday”! 
<br />You who would have otherwise thought, 
<br />“Nah, she doesn’t need a greeting 
<br />I see joy in everything, even where there is none. 
<br />I find comfort in a Being, higher than all of us, bar none. 
<br />You who would have otherwise said, 
<br />“Nah, I don’t need to write it, such a greeting is overrated. 
<br />After all, a birthday to one is but a usual day to some. 
<br />And like I told you, look at her, she’s probably having enough fun!” 
<br />You, who would have otherwise decided that it’s better not to greet 
<br />Than be branded either “eagerly excited” or “terribly late”, 
<br />You who would have logged in and out without a trouble or a care. 
<br />Still, you did what you did, left a greeting, au contraire. 
<br />It’s friends like you who make birthdays happier 
<br />People like you who make parties thrown here and there, 
<br />Look no more fabulous and appear none the grander. 
<br />It is you who makes me pause in this hurried, confounded world 
<br />To appreciate life, count my blessings and remember what I’ve always been told – 
<br />That friends come and go, in myriad colors, shapes and sizes. 
<br />They add meaning to your existence, oh the pleasure of one who socializes! 
<br />They may promise to stay forever, swear on their lives and say: “Leave you? Oh never!” 
<br />The next day they’d be packing like crazy, running after lost dreams, gripping a dagger! 
<br />But the footprint they leave on that old hostile path you once traversed together 
<br />Stay with you long after the journey’s over, most times enduring even the harshest of weather. 
<br />These friends I speak of may be actual or virtual. They maybe new or old. 
<br />I might not see them now in the flesh, never did so, and probably never would. 
<br />But the thought of their very existence is enough to put a smile in a face like mine, 
<br />That though most times appear smug and happy, let it not beguile 
<br />That I’m not without my own challenges or share of this world’s troubles, every once in a while. 
<br />Thank you for your greetings, dear friends who I value greatly. 
<br />Be it known to you — now and for all eternity – 
<br />That every message you send me, moving swiftly and securely,
<br /><br />thank you..thank you very much!!! hmmmmmmmmmmmmmwah!!!!

<br /><br />Happy Mother's Day
<br />means more than flowers and gifts
<br />It means saying thank you
<br />It means I love you
<br />You are my mother, my friend
<br />Today is your day!
<br /><br />Mother is a gift of God. She is an angel, which protects us from all the evils of the world and gives us a secure shelter in her lap whenever we feel stressed and insecure. Irrespective of how we look or behave, our mother showers us with all possible love and blessings in the world. Despite how successful we become, she can't ignore her little concerns for us. Despite we become mature enough, we remain a 'silly darling kid' in our mom's eyes. Though she is a guardian angel to us, we hardly ever get an opportunity to thank her for lending us a shoulder to cry, a lap to rest, hands to catch hold of us whenever we fall. She is our dearest pal and our best companion ever. let us Tell them that we love them and no one else could ever substitute the position they holds in our heart. 
<br /><br />we love you Mama Nelia &amp; to allthe MOms, HAPPY MOTHERS DAY!!!

<br />by John Laset 
<br /><br />Pain... Tension... Fatigue... 
<br />Depression... 
<br />Anger, Aggression, Frustration. 
<br />All these unwanted sensations - 
<br />Burning, hurting, tearing. 
<br />My heart alone, cold and fearing. 
<br />Why won't you let me sleep, let me rest, 
<br />Let me forget 
<br />To eradicate, eliminate, destroy all my regrets? 
<br />These memories inside, swirling, twirling, 
<br />unwilling to reside in the corner of my mind. 
<br />Repeating, resisting, insisting - 
<br />Refusing to be denied its recognition 
<br />Of its position in my 
<br />Frustration, Confusion, Delusion. 
<br />Ah, to close my eyes and let time fly by, 
<br />Because there's so much to gain 
<br />By forgetting these dreams driving me insane. 
<br />Unfocused, unclear, out of control, 
<br />My world spinning, spinning, spinning, 
<br />My sanity flying through the door. 
<br />My reason, my logic, oh, it's tragic, 
<br />Like fine sands running through my hands, 
<br />I'm losing my mind. 
<br /><br />i loved it ! its exactly wat im going through right now

<br /><br />Hi! Im Melani Tupas Tenizo, but my friends used to call me Lanie, Lan or Lanz.
<br /><br />Everyday is the same,even weekends,some days are a smidgen different,but generally the same.My days are packed.though i wake up early in the morning,i still manage to go out at night!i'm up by four &amp; starting doing e-mails &amp; preparing my sons breakfast &amp; things that he gonna need for school.I get in the shower,I get out, get dressed,fix my hair,if I'm lucky I can grab a bite to eat,most of the time not.i kiss my son about a million times,&amp; leave &amp; head to work.Get to work,I work all day, checking in my e-mails,updating my clients &amp; do some follow ups,assisting clients when needed,sometimes I take a break,but only when I have time.i was one of those who probably drove mallgoers crazy, giving them flyers &amp; offering them real estate.when i get bored at the malls,i dragged my friends along to do flyering w/ me.i go out because i can never sleep right away when my day is so energized. i go home right away after work,i end up writing,reading,watching tv &amp; sleeping even later.so i just go out to noisy places where i cant write &amp; think so much abT many things especially preassure at work,&amp; by the time i get home,i'm really tired &amp; have no choice but to sleep.sometimes i feel like my daily routine is more like a treadmill?i get up,take care of my son,head off to work,come home &amp; do chores,make dinner,play w/ my son,sometimes help him in his homework,&amp; then basically collapse in exhaustion,only to get up the next day &amp; do it all over again, On some level,it's unavoidable,only if i have someone there to help me out, these things won't get done unless i'm the one orchestrating them.However,lately there a few ways i did to liven up monotony,such as doing something fun an unexpected,or giving myself a &quot;night off&quot; from repetitive chores.Not only would this give me a &quot;break&quot; &amp; allow me to approach the same tasks the next night w/ greater energy,but jump-starting the system w/ a little change can also help my son find new things to do w/ his time,argue less,&amp; behave more cooperatively in general.during bedtime there are lots of things that keep sinking in my mind,the enormous amounT of fear that so many single moms experience like being afraid of my estranged ex-husband fearful of my ability to provide for family esp to my son,or am i really unsure of myself—wondering if i were aptly equipped w/ the wisdom &amp; knowledge for leading a family single-handedly. 
<br /><br />After i’ve repeatedly made bad choices,i sometimes find myself afraid to make new decisions.By petitioning God w/ our concerns,i shift my problems from my feeble hands into His control.Soon i find that im able to proceed w/ direction, wisdom,peace of mind,&amp; newfound strength. I don't have advice on how to find or set up a situation where you get regular help at home, although I hope some can. But I do have a reality check on whether it is possible to parent as a single. It is. I am as single as single can be - luckily i have a very supported family,but still it does get exhausting physically,emotionally,&amp;mentally sometimes,but most of the time it's fine.I think it's a question of getting myself here mentally.I went into parenting knowing I'd be doing it myself - . And that is a big, big difference.i didn't sign up for this in the beginning. But i can choose it now, or eventually. I recommend trying, if we don't work something else out that works for us . I recommend re-setting our expectations and setting out on an adventure that we're choosing,because we are. It wasn't our first choice,but it's our choice now.I really think this is critical to our happiness.I see single parents by choice doing better emotionally than many parents w/ partners who don't contribute.They have to deal with a lot of disappointment &amp; resentment.I don't.Yes, I have to do every little thing,but it doesn't make me angry. Exhausted sometimes,&amp; I have little pity parties sometimes,but mostly I just do it, enjoy my son,&amp; feel like a strong,capable person.
<br /><br />Abroad,the people i deal w/ are Filipinos,too. they comprise majority of my clients, &amp; also im blessed enough to have thousands of friends,new foriegner friends,&amp; its funny how in each country can be different w/ the way they deal w/ me. some are very hospitable,some are very talkative - they even shared their saddest stories w/ me,&amp; its my pleasure bec i know they trust me &amp; iM also learning from them.
<br /><br />for my company,ROBINSONS LAND CORP.,i always say that at the end of the day, our purpose is to provide good homes &amp; investments.I mean there are many who have been working so hard &amp; for so long but are still renting house.that's why i want people to learn to invest in real estate as much as they do on cars.in the end,when they retire,it is essential they have a place they can call their own.
<br /><br />for my family esp my dad,i know they are proud of me because they knows i really worked for everything i have right now.my friends &amp; my family are the ones who keep me grounded.i can be such a spaced out person sometimes that all fortune, or whatever you call it,doesn't get to me.i mean w/ everything happening,i remain the same,i remain myself.
<br /><br />i just want to make the people arounD me happy.you know, when everything is over,when all the things i have now are gone,what would really define my essense as a person,is how much i have helped others &amp; how much i have touched their lives.it sounds miss universe,but w/ everything i do,every decision i make,i always follow my heart- to give the best as i can for my family &amp; to make people happy.
<br /><br />what makes me &quot;super happy&quot; is my son, mi unico hijo CHRISTIAN FERDINAND.Freedom comes w/ responsibility.&amp; a true sense of responsibility can only be achieved if we understand that we will still have to depend on people.Moving out doesnt mean we should shun our parents &amp; the rest of the world.Our independence will thrive not on the personal strenght alone but will also rely on the strenght of our support system - our family &amp; friends.we'll remember this especially when we run out of coffee at two in the morning.moving out involves a separation not unlike breaking up w/ a bf.the best way to handle it is quite simply to let go.Be ready to break old habits,the usual routine &amp; a lifestyle to which we've grown accustomed.Be even more ready to develop new ones.I have a lot of friends right now.I'm trying to gain as many as I can.Im a single parent.Its difficult because I have to be Mom and Dad at same time.Despite my work schedule,I make time to take my son to school,help him w/ his homework &amp; theres having to assure his day in &amp; day out that (his parents) are there for him.Thats not his fAult that we're not together.My son asks questions once &amp; a while,but I'm very honest w/ him.I tell him what really matters.My husband &amp; I werent really getting along.We had two different personalities,two different views on how to raise a family.One big factor was that I got married so young.I was 18 &amp; his 30.When youre young you think you're in love later you realize you're not pala.
<br /><br />though im a dedicated career woman,the mother in me still twinge of guilt whenever my son asks me to go home when &quot;there's still light.&quot; i has come to terms w/ the demand of my career,however realizing that what's important in the end is not the amounT but the quality of time i spends w/ my son.during our &quot;together time&quot;, i sees to it that we really connect.we genuinely do things together,whether grocery shopping,watching movies together,or a weekend lunch and dinner. &quot; it doesnt matter what we're doing.the point is we're doing it together.&quot;&quot;its about quality time.&quot; while it is true that the responsibilities i has right now can be overwhelming,im also happy w/ the way im dealing it day by day. for me,it's just a matter of taking them on &amp; learning from them,no matter the outcome.&quot;i know we can make mistakes, we can fail &amp; all of that,but for me whether it was success, what's important is the growth &amp; development that a particular experience gives us.&quot;indeed, sky's the limit when it comes to ambition.better yet,only our ambition,as well as our determination to stick with it no matter what,defines our limitations.reaching the top is only a small part of the adventure.the bigger part is getting there &amp;, yes, it's true, too that when we're there,more often than not,it can't seem high enough &amp; we wish we could go higher.as robert frost put it so sccinctly, &quot; happiness makes up in height what it lacks in leNght.&quot;
<br /><br />if the world could give me only one special person i would want that person to be someone i could share a real understanding w/;someone i could be completely open &amp; honest w/;someone who had qualities i admired;someone whose interest &amp; outlooks were interwoven w/ mine.i would want that special person to bring the gift of laughter to my heart &amp; to have no fear of crying on my shoulder.i would want that person to be a reason for me to smile through the seasons of my life.i would want that person to be the joy in many of my best memories, &amp; the thankful thought that tomorrow will always be happy,too.
<br />OR a Cool guy,ideal guy is someone &quot;manly who can be romantic&quot;.i like the guy who's in touch w/ his feelings.or sometimes,the first thing I notice in a man IS how he stands out in a social situation.He may not be the most good looking guy,but if carries himself well,that should get me interested.
<br /><br />wanna share one of my favorite quotes..
<br /><br />&quot;its not always right to stay in pain when you know you've already had too much,&amp; it isn't always wrong to be happy when you know it's about time that you deserve to be&quot; and &quot;It's better to feel the enjoyment of being not committed, rather than suffer in a relationship being cheated&quot;

And I pray too that with all I'm going through at this point in my life, I hope that I can somehow, someway come close to having your strength, your faith, your boldness and your wisdom to endure all! I am extremely blessed to have the presence of a beautiful, wonderful, loving father!!! YOU ARE MY HERO!!!! I Love You So very Much!

<br />The live that I felt for you could not be resisted
<br />The elation that I felt as you grew in my womb
<br />The joy I felt in my heart as I started to bloom
<br /><br />From the first time you kicked,
<br />Until the glorious day you actually appeared
<br />Upside down and much quicker than planned
<br />You changed my life that instant, you understand
<br /><br />Becoming a parent was scary from the start
<br />You hope you do the right thing by following your heart
<br />You give your love and guidance each and every day
<br />Hoping to raise your children the best possible way
<br /><br />But you never receive any specific guarantee
<br />That they'll turn out exactly as you want them to be
<br />You pray that you've influenced them positively each day
<br />In decisions they make, what they do, what they say
<br /><br />You hope and you pray that you've done everything right
<br />But you never know the outcome, not just overnight
<br />So you share in their lives, through the ups and the downs
<br />And try to support them and always be around
<br /><br />So while raising you I tried to do the best that I could do
<br />I don't know exactly what I did to deserve you
<br />But I definitely must have done something right
<br />Because having you for my son has been pure delight
<br /><br />I'm so very proud of the wonderful man you've become
<br />(Hopefully, contributed in part by something I have done)
<br />I hope that my love and guidance has played a small part
<br />I know the most important part comes straight from your heart
<br /><br />You've grown to become a respectable and honorable man
<br />Who is there for friends and family whenever he can
<br />Your love and respect is something I'll always treasure
<br />Having you for my son is one of my life's pleasures
<br /><br />I'll always be there for you in any way that I can
<br />That won't ever change, even now that you're a man
<br />You're my flesh and blood, an important part of my life
<br />And will forever be, even when you have a wife
<br /><br />When that day comes, I wish you all the best
<br />I look forward to watching you create YOUR family nest
<br />Raising children of your own, you'll be a great Dad
<br />To share in YOUR family will make me quite glad
<br /><br />So as you grow living your life your own way
<br />I wish you much love, happiness and good health each day
<br />You deserve a full life and bright future up ahead
<br />But keep in your heart all the things that I've said
<br /><br />I will always cherish the pictures and memories of you
<br />Through infancy, adolescence and manhood you grew
<br />But what I'll cherish the most are the feelings deep in my heart
<br />The bond that I share with you even when we're apart
<br /><br />So feel my love with you each and every day
<br />Even those days that you are so far away
<br />May it give you courage and strength, if that be required
<br />Or may it comfort and hold you, if you so desire
<br /><br />May it help you overcome any obstacle in your way
<br />Or simply just be there for you from day to day
<br />I know you're as strong and as tough as they come
<br />So you be extra careful and come home to your MOM
<br /><br />I’m So Glad That.. God Gave Me A Son Like You. I’m So Proud To Have You As My Son. I See A Little More Of Me In You With Each Passing Year. No Matter How Many Birthdays Come And Go, You’ll Always Be My Little Boy. You are loved so very much! ÄDVANCE HAPPY BIRTHDAY SON!!!! I LOVE YOU SO VERY MUCH!!!!?

<br /><br />Allow me to make a humble “thank you” note
<br />for all the people who remembered me and wrote.
<br />For those who left messages everywhere and bothered
<br />And those wonderful friends who chatted and lingered.
<br />You who took time out from your otherwise busy day
<br />You who stopped awhile, left me a message ”
<br />You, who would have otherwise decided that it’s better not to greet
<br />Than be branded either “eagerly excited” or “terribly late”,
<br />You who would have logged in and out without a trouble or a care.
<br />Still, you did what you did, left a greeting,
<br />It’s friends like you who make birthdays happier
<br />People like you who make parties thrown here and there,
<br />Look no more fabulous and appear none the grander.
<br />It is you who makes me pause in this hurried, confounded world
<br />To appreciate life, count my blessings and remember what I’ve always been told –That friends come and go, in myriad colors, shapes and sizes.
<br />They add meaning to your existence, oh the pleasure of one who socializes!
<br />They may promise to stay forever, swear on their lives and say: “Leave you? Oh never!”
<br />The next day they’d be packing like crazy, running after lost dreams, gripping a dagger!
<br />But the footprint they leave on that old hostile path you once traversed together
<br />Stay with you long after the journey’s over, most times enduring even the harshest of weather.
<br />These friends I speak of may be actual or virtual. They maybe new or old.
<br />I might not see them now in the flesh, never did so, and probably never would.
<br />But the thought of their very existence is enough to put a smile in a face like mine,
<br />That though most times appear smug and happy, let it not beguile
<br />That I’m not without my own challenges or share of this world’s troubles, every once in a while.
<br />Thank you for your greetings, dear friends who I value greatly.
<br />Be it known to you — now and for all eternity –
<br />That every message you send me, moving swiftly and securely,
<br /><br />I have received so many wonderful
<br />wishes on my birthday. I want to
<br />acknowledge to all of you what I probably can’t do personally  due to
<br />the incredible kindness given to me by so many.I have met so many wonderful, unselfish and dedicated people in my life.
<br />My mind has found the ecstasy of intense intellectual conversation,
<br />knowing and not knowing, and the pure love and joy that comes with
<br />appreciating the beauty &amp; kindness of different people .
<br />I feel love, so much love that pours from you, and those closest to
<br />me, and the love that flows from me, giving me more, the more I give.I remember the lines from Shakespeare’s immortal Romeo and Juliet when Juliet says: the more love she gives the more love she has!It
<br />is this deep, giving love, as Dostoevsky says, that can save us. A love
<br />that comes from beauty that inspires us and nourishes us with the
<br />infinite in our souls.“Only Beauty can save us,” he says so magnificently.A
<br />love of beauty that inspires us to sacrifice, to courage, to unending
<br />work and dedication. A vision of light that fills our sight in even the
<br />darkest prison or on the most sun-blessed, windswept mountaintop.Many people have sent gifts and have asked where to send them. Every year, my friends and family try to decide what to give me for my birthday and while I always appreciate the gifts and the fact that they are thinking of me but Please refrain from such, the best gift you could ever give me on this, my birthday is support for this work, my life’s work.It is my work  that gives me the greatest joy in my life.Seeing  people awakening is indescribable pleasure for me.And that’s what I dedicate the rest of this life to.With love for those who are my precious family, and those who are my closest friends — you know who you are…..
<br />so to all my friends who made me laugh...cry.......smile.......and believe that lifes worthwhile despite tough times...
<br />thanks for everything!!!thanks for spending abit of your time with me, for that bit of your time completes my entire
<br />life!!!
<br /><br />&quot;When I blow out the candles on my birthday cake my special wish is for love
<br />and peace throughout the world. This is a time for people everywhere to
<br />think positive thoughts and not to dwell on the negative. We can change
<br />the world if we all remember that we are truly a spark from the same
<br />original source regardless of what religion/God/infinite wisdom we are
<br />accustomed to believe in.&quot;
<br /><br />and also my dozen wishes are the following;
<br />1. FAMILY beside me and FRIENDS who bring out the best in Me.
<br />2. A love that makes me smile and never ends.
<br />3. Belief that everything is possible.
<br />4. Courage to finally do what I've been putting off.
<br />5. Time for myself and a nice day with so much to be thankful for.
<br />6. Promises that are not broken.
<br />7. An answered prayer and dreams that manage to come.
<br />8. A heart that forgives.
<br />9. Beautiful memories of yesterdays and a pathway leading to better tomorrows.
<br />10. A soul that heals and a healthy body.
<br />11. Sunrise after the darkest of nights and
<br />12. A good life and a great appreciation for whatever i do
<br /><br />again thank you so very much, love you all..mwah<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/biggrin.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />I remain your,dearest friend, Lanz

<br /><br />Romantic Valentine's Day festival is much awaited by those in love but dreaded by singles!! So much is the hype about the festival that some singles even become depressed about not having a partner several days before the festival when they see stores decorated with candies, chocolates and flowers to lure the one's in love. Some times the sense of isolation becomes so strong that many singles tend to “hate Valentine's Day” - the day that is actually meant to celebrate love.
<br /><br />Many single men and women go to the extent of calling Valentine's Day a ‘Singles Awareness Day'. This is because they feel that the day strongly reminds them of their unattached status and not having someone to spend the day in romantic and much popularized manner. Initials of the day ‘S-A-D' reflect their status of feeling depressed and unloved.
<br /><br />But dateless people must keep in mind that Valentine's Day is not just to be celebrated by romantically involved couples. The festival is celebrated to express love to anyone we are closed to. We can therefore celebrate Valentine's Day with friends, siblings, parents, grandparents, teachers or anyone who made a difference to our lives with their affection and support. We must take opportunity of the Valentine's Day festival to express our love and gratitude to all persons we love. And what better way to do so than by saying it with a gift of roses, chocolates and beautiful cards.
<br /><br />Singles can make the most of Valentine's Day by spending the day in the company of those they love or by indulging themselves with something luxurious. Here are some tips and ideas on how singles can celebrate the Valentine's Day in charming and memorable fashion:

<br /><br />There are NO winners in a situation like this. He will NOT leave his wife for you.......all married men who cheat go to the same school and use the same lines.....his wife is cold, he doesn't love her any more, he only stays because of the kids, he stays for financial reasons, she won't have sex with him, his feelings for her have changed, religious or cultural reasons, blah blah blah. As one reason gets resolved, another one will come up.
<br /><br />You certainly CAN help it! You can send him home to his wife and tell him he's not going to use you!
<br /><br />There are no winners in a situation like this.....you will never have him, his wife is being cheated on and not getting what she deserves from her marriage and he won't give himself 100% to either one of you!
<br /><br />You're going to get hurt and that's a promise!
<br /><br />Then you're going to end up a lonely lady because he will be with his wife/family on EVERY occasion while you're alone and you will be getting all the crumbs!! If he loved you he would be with you!
<br /><br />Why make an emotional investment in someone who is not free to love you and who you have to share! You're kidding yourself if you think he has sex with you and goes home and doesn't have sex with his wife!!
<br /><br />You are worth more than the leftovers you're getting from this guy and while you're wasting time with him, you could be missing out on someone who is perfect for you .....AND free to love you and be with you ALL the time!

<br />Time to see your troubles coming to an ending.
<br />Life is never hopeless however great your sorrow-
<br />If you're looking forward to a new tomorrow.
<br />If there is time for wishing then there is time for hoping-
<br />When through doubt and darkness you are blindly groping.
<br />Though the heart be heavy and hurt you may be feeling-
<br />If there is time for praying there is time for healing.
<br /><br />So if through your window there is a new day breaking-
<br />Thank God for the promise, though mind and soul be aching,
<br />If with harvest over there is grain enough for gleaning-
<br />There is a new tomorrow and life still has meaning.
