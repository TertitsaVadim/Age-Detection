		<document id="9da813326da083bd75db398f4bce0a68" url=""><![CDATA[The libon's apprentice<br/><br/>Do you continually wonder what the changes of the seasons and the moon,the alignment  of the stars,and the movements of the planets mean? What does the coming of day and night tell you? 
<br /><br />Do you believe that you can through practice become a master in reading and interpreting what these changes mean? As we head toward  2012 let us all resolve to listen to nature more carefully? What did the ancient shamans say about the omens that we see today?
<br /><br />I believe that there is a fundamental communication in nature that we must heed to.  Most of us are missing out  because of the lack of this communication with nature. Our lifestyle may be overwhelming us.
<br />         How can we get  substantial number of the community say 40 % of the population paying attention to natural rhythms?
<br /><br />In my view this attention is possible to achieve.Most  human beings can achieve this sensitivity. If you pay close attention you will get a revelations of these things which I call omens though the path of direct revelation. By this I meant that nature is talking to you all the time and you are capable of understanding the message. Many people do not even know this so they have become sensitive deaf and blind to direct revelations. This has killed their intuition.
<br /><br />Communication with nature  and the forces that govern and influence the environment the path of direct revelation and sharpens our intuition. If enough of us say 1% of any community becomes sensitive to this phenomenon then a revelation will be possible on a wide scale. So what happens next? we shall be able to maintain our balance and harmony, thus furthering the well-being of yourself  and your community and our universe.
<br /><br />The first step towards direct revelation  is simple but complex. It involves stepping aside from our routine habits and thought for as short as 40 days. Change    your habits a little. Give your senses a change to heal and to re tune.For instance start thinking and praying for an opportunity to  spend some quite time away from the hustle and bustle. Think of a moment of quiet when you are fully sober and  without your phone,TV, radio or computer. Seek to find the will and the energy to pray for  time to  listen to the call and singing of birds.Make time for this important natural exercise. You will realize that nature is communicating something. Just listen to the calling of birds and the rhythms. Listen to  the diffenent songs going on. You will instantly realize that there is a communication going on at another level.
<br /><br />The second step is simple.Pray to get the will and the  energy to  give your brain a break from intoxicants.

A Laibon  is a man of mystic ways. Like shamans and Druids everywhere, the Laibon is a master of working with nature, and he knows that through the practice of Natural Mysticism the deep psychic abilities inherent within us could become activated. When this happens man becomes at peace with himself and his universe. This will enable us to experience true connections with people and avoid conflicts. We also get connection with certain places in nature such as forests, certain trees, mountains, lakes, rivers, animals and the spirit world. Through my apprenticeship with Laibon Githae I have learned that the world has many &quot;unseen” entities that cooperate with us to usher in peace and prosperity. 
<br /><br />The Laibon Githae is teaching me to follow a spiritual path that our Agikuyu( Kikuyu) people have followed as a  way of live until the momentus  and infamous colonial disruption. Laibon Githae’s is teaching me  to be innocent and spontaneous as I was as a child. He is guiding me in my reconnection  with nature. I am very lucky to be able to travel to Mt. Kenya for  some of his sessions.
<br /><br />As adults we can learn to reconnect with this path, a path that brings us into direct connection with the soul of the universe.  I know When I am in connection because I can  sense it. I have known with certainty   that the soul of Nature is alive. It is aware of me, and always have been. When we walk to the sacred Mugumo tree, the Laibon lifts up his hands and talks to the spirit of the ancient tree. In my   apprenticeship  I have  discover that Nature expresses itself through those representative forces that indigenous people call spirits. 
<br /><br />Laibon Githae teaches me that The spirit of the world is a multi-leveled matrix and intelligence of our planet and beyond. The Kikuyu and Masai -communities call this mighty spirit  of the world Ngai. The Greeks called it Gaia.
<br /><br />Nowhere is this spirit as powerfully felt as it is on Mt. Kenya. It is said that Ngai  is so accessible form this location than any other place. This makes Kirinyaga (mt. Kenya ) a holy place for all the indigenous people who know this mountain. The Masai call this place Oldonyo Keri, and they revere this location likewise  the Embu and Meru . There is no doubt in my mind that this is a place of mighty power and a natural shrine.
<br /><br />The indigenous people of Mt. Kenya region of Kenya the Kikuyu, Meru and Masai have  a common approach to this deep relationship with the spirit of the universe. And their social order was geared towards awakening the spirit of the world within their community as the foundation underpinning their  justice system  and social order.
<br /><br />Laibon Githae is so elated that all this is knowledge is being revived for the benefit of all the people of the world and especially the indegenous people of the world and especially the American Indians  with whom the Agikuyu can share and have a holy communion around this holy place and exchange experiences. 
<br /><br />These thoughts have become evermore possible because Kenyan politics have changed and   Kenyans have an elected   democratic government in 2002.  The spirit of the people has been freed from the bondage of over 100 years of abouse violence and leadership by empty shells without a spirit. Laibon says that  now  Kenya the land of the sacred shrine is free the spiritual bondage is literally over.
<br /><br />In Laibon Githae's view, the new millenium is the millenium of the Awakening to   the Spirit World. He has seen large numbers of    Agikuyu ,Meru  and Embu people taking the Laibon's spiritual path of  awakening the Spirit  World .Soon the World will now of this and join in.

Once a week I have a session with her.  Today, I made time to be with the Sculptor at her work shop in the out skirts of Arusha where she lives with her family.
<br />          Mieke is Dutch. She has lived in Tanzania for 18 years. Mieke is an excellent teacher. She understands her stones and she shapes them with style.
<br />         During this session, I am working on a deeper level of detail on my sculpture. I have reached a stage where I can use all the tools including a file. I also witnessed other apprentices use a blow torch to polish their sculptures. 
<br />       As always, Mieke is there to guide me and to encourage me. As I pick the chisel to make my cuts, a certain anxiety springs to the surface of my mind. How do I overcome this fear to change things? As the chisel touches the surface and the hammer strikes the blow the fear is transformed into an indomitable spirit of courage, adventure and creativity. 
<br />         What do I want this image to say to me and you, the viewer? That is the foremost question on my mind. I think that there is a message that this stone has for me.   The challenge is how to interpret and realize that intention.
<br />          I have posted the image of my sculpture from session 2 to represent Renaissanceman 57 -my face in PAN. Some of my friends on PAN have asked me why I am &quot;hiding&quot; behind this large mask of uncompleted stone sculpture. &quot;Send me your face' Gareth said. However, and on the contrary, I feel a kinship sculpture.  The more I look at this stone sculpture the more I see a distant reflection of a spirit that my biological face cannot reflect. 
<br />          This sculpture has captured an aspect of my own spirit. Every time I work on this stone I remember the first time I went to the Sculptor's Garden to meet with master Mieke. On that first day, she welcomed me and pointed to a heap of stones of all sizes and shapes.  She encouraged me to choose a stone to work with. She guided me and told me to choose a “…stone that whispered something to me…&quot;
<br />          &quot;When you look at a stone &quot;she said, &quot;try and hear and visualize the message the stone is sending out to you, then if you are happy with it select it…&quot; she said.
<br />           The next challenge is to interpret the message using modeling clay. Following this, the sculptor then cuts his stone with a chisel.
<br />           The stone that spoke to me a magic image was a black 25Kg black serpentine stone from Zimbabwe. Now I know that this may require a leap of faith to digest. But I know that this stone will continue to project the image I saw for a thousand more years to come. Whether this message was encoded in the stone since creation a billion years before is a question to ponder on. 
<br /><br />My first challenge in session 1 was to seek to find the message in the stone and bring it out. That challenge still persists. The stone keeps on speaking with more clarity than before. On this fourth session I realised that this stone is alive. I am prompted to ask the question do stones  have a spirit  or do they capture our spirits and make them their own? The more this question rises the smoother my stone becomes. I find myself sliding and falling into the stone ever more so deeply. Finally, I am determined to capture the spirit in this stone.

<br />Today I visited a cancer treatment center in Nairobi. I went to the MP Shah Cancer center in Nairobi. While seated in the lounge waiting to see the doctor I saw other people waiting there. I wondered whether they were patients or were they visitors like myself.  Seating there was a significant experience for me. Some few persons who walked by were clearly patients escorted by their loved one. One elderly lady struck me. She was in her 60’s. She seems to have had a good life. She was escorted in this her pilgrimage here by very loving younger people. I wish that all persons suffering visiting this cancer center could be escorted by her relatives and friends like this fine old lady. Generally it was not easy to see who else was a patient of cancer and who was escorting the patient. Cancer is a strange disease. But it was not visibly clear who was suffering and who was not. 
<br /><br />MP Shah Hospital is a philanthropic facility rather than a business venture. I was happy to learn that. The building itself is a beacon of hope for the cancer patients and their friends like me.  This imposing modern architectural design is very welcoming. It even   softens the psychological effects of cancer. The building exudes hope and patience style and modernity. 
<br /><br />When my turn came to see the oncologist came, I walked to the doctors office accompanied   my wife. I found myself seated in front of a soft spoken doctor with good demeanor. I had previously only spoken to him   on the telephone. I handed him the diagnostic documents for his analyses. 
<br /><br />After speaking to the doctor for 20 minutes, and explaining to him why I had come and not my friend, I   asked the doctor how long my friend had to live. He told me that my patient had less than 9 months to live at most and if the condition was not urgently treated my patient would die within 3-4 months. 
<br /><br />My patient is suffering from cancer in the esophagus and the tumor is seating on a sensitive aorta that send blood to the heart. This tumor is restricting the flow of food of my patient. 
<br /><br />The patient will now have to be first treated by inserting a stent in the esophagus to enable food to reach the stomach. It is a sorry state of affairs. The treatment prescribed is radio therapy and some mild chemotherapy. 
<br /><br />My patient could not come to the cancer center for now. He requested me to go there instead and take instructions on his behalf. Now his radiotherapy will begin after New Year.
<br /><br />The question that now lingers is why does the body produce cancerous cell? How widespread is this disease? 
<br /><br />Please let me know if you know the answer to my question and also if you have had similar experience. Do you know of anyone who is suffering from cancer?
<br /><br />Can we do anything about it, or are the causes of this deadly disease so linked to modern living that we cannot avoid it? 
<br />Just a thought .

<br />                     At the foot of his farm there is a dam. This dam is a new creation of the government. This project is indeed a very A welcome idea that has been on the blue prints for over 3 decades.  Previously, farmers had taken over the wetland for farming purposes. That dam measures about 1 hectare.  This dam had brought in beautiful birds which migrate from far and wide. 
<br />                 As I had said earlier, the Laibon follows the animist tradition. He believes and teaches that everything in nature has a spirit. The land the trees rocks and the birds have a natural magnetic force. This spirit extends to other phenomena present in the environment and they include ancestral spirits. These are elements with which we share this space. The Laibon demonstrated this rather complex concept very dramatically. He pointed to a pile of timber across the dam from his farm.
<br />    “That pile of timber was a few weeks back a wood that had been planted b professor Wangari Mathai the late Nobel Laureate.  That wood took 20 years to mature and at that right time the dam was dug up by the government for the community. The little wood was a sanctuary where all the water birds used to flock and roost. Now only a pile of wood stands there and just a few ducks can be seen swimming in the dam.”
<br />       The little wood was cut up to make room for a proposed lodge to attract visitors to the area. A committee consisting of members of the community had  “deliberated “ on the matter  and passed that the little wood should make room for  the  proposed lodge.
<br />       The Laibon looked sad and disappointed as he pointed at the pile of sawdust and firewood on the place where a living wood once stood.
<br />        It is clear that committee was not aware of their traditional roots even though they all hail from the location. “There is no understanding of the need to consult the spirit of Ithenguri.”  
<br />       One wonders how we have come to this. The Laibon’s answer is simple: &quot;you will soon discover that you need to consult the guardian spirit of the land before you can meddle.&quot; How do you consult the spirit of a place? I asked. 
<br />      “Every place in which we live you will find that that place has a spirit.” When the time comes, you too will know these things the spirit will teach you. First you have to learn to speak and listen to the language of the spirits - omens.  The rare birds on the water are an omen that needs to be understood.    When the time comes, the rare birds will come back again and they will once again be roosting on the Laibon’s indigenous trees far away from the power of any committee. You must learn the language of the spirits.
<br />         The people of all animist cultures honored   the spirit of a specific place and called on those spirits in healing ceremonies and for cerebrations. In this way generation after generation of indigenous people became aware of the spirits of the places and they honored them. But see now what has happened to Ithenguri dam, when did the rain begin to beat us?
<br />     Once again, to live in harmony, the spirit of things must be recognized on all levels and honored.

<br /><br />Dr. Jack Githae (the Laibon) Is passionate gentleman who advocates for the African Renaissance.  He is my tutor and mentor in all matters of African culture.  He is an expert in traditional Gikuyu herbal medicine, language (the Gikuyu language) rituals and ceremonies and traditions. He has written numerous documents and papers and lectures on the African culture and its renaissance. He believes that unless Africans and in particular African intellectuals and the African middle class takes up the challenge to create conditions for an African renaissance the Gikuyu culture and many other African cultures are facing the threat of extinction primarily caused by ignorant condemnation. 
<br />Laibon Githae has participated in numerous international symposia on Traditional African Medicine. These include WHO, Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) among others. 
<br /> Laibon Githae also advocates for the production of indigenous African crops such as yams, sorghum and   vegetables. As an expert in agriculture and range management he has advocated for sustainable and appropriate technology such as renewable energy. 
<br />The Laibon is also a prophet and a seer. He has been sought after by Traditional elders in matters of Gikuyu ceremonies such as on national prayers and other spiritual matters.  Laibon Githae does not do this work for personal gain or profit. He does it for the greater good of the Gikuyu community and the entire world. 
<br />Join me in my pilgrimage with the Laibon to find the essence of his teaching on shamanism and the   illusive thought of blending ancient African traditions with modernity. 
<br /><br />In this pilgrimage, Renaissanceman invites you to listen and question the forces that define the scope of the issues at hand. On one hand we have the forces of Westernization with the Christian Religion and also along with that the forces of Islam and Eastern religion and morality. On the other hand we have the less advocated and less appreciated indigenous African culture of Animism.
<br />I have full conviction that one can and should embrace both the Western, Eastern the indigenous way of life without conflict. This is the middle way of African renaissance that bring the best of these worlds and treat them with respect. But how can one devise a scientific test to measure the resolution and efficacy of this blend for this culture? 
<br /><br />Indentifying the Challenges and obstcles to an African Renaissance:
<br /><br />Many people in the Western world including  Africans have been taught that traditional African teachings and practives are  pagan and against the teaching of Jesus Christ.
<br />On New Year's day, I got enlightened that this is not necessarily true.
<br /><br />On 1 January 2012, the Laibon invited me to  witnesses a traditional Gikuyu ceremony in which he was asked to bless several families. 
<br /><br />The Laibon performed ceremonies  on several parents and their children who had sought is assistance in this regard. At that ceremony there other elders and a catholic priest. In his benediction, the priest said that Jesus was the light and the way to God.He confirmed  That the true teachings of the prophets and the Bible was not against Gikuyu traditional worship in fact it confirms such worship as proper. 
<br /><br />I need to make more observations on how far the comunity which is overwhelmingly christian and a Muslim minority . One such observation will involve the application of Gikuyu traditional ceremony to bless a modern dwelling house in Nyeri County this year in which members of the community will be invited. After this proposed  African ceremony, which will be presided over by the Laibon and a christian priest, I will carry out a survey to find out if there was a conflict that divide the members of the community as to the appropriateness of the ceremony. Any bright ideas?

		<document id="9aef95248d20e0a9953efcc7fa0c6bbe" url=""><![CDATA[Sculptors apprentice: The spirit of the scupture.<br/><br/>I have been looking forward to my first sculptor's workshop in 2012. Today I  attend my weekly sculpture class with Mieke my mentor. I have been away from my sculpture during the entire festive season. Now it is back to work.
<br />      I arrived at the sculpture garden at 9:00 AM. Mieke was there waiting and she greeted me warmly in her usual pleasant way.  She looked radiant and relaxed after the long break. Yet she has to leave again before long to return to Holland before she returns.
<br />       She is working on a new complex sculpture called A Slice of Energy. This is an abstract design depicting energy. 
<br />       I look around trying to recapture my last thoughts I had on the serpentine stone before me. I turn my sculpture around and around until I am sure that I know where to start.  The sculpture has evolved to a point where more complex improvements are showing and calling out for the chisel or file. These improvements include attention to symmetry of the sculpture and other more subtle aspects  such as expressions and style.
<br />       The first is to deal with is symmetry. My sculpture has two aspects to it. On the one hand it has the face of a human which expresses matter and time.At this point in time the wise head seems to comtemplate something it is in a creative state where matter and spirit talk,I think the sculpure is drawing from the past the present and the future. Energy is at play while matter is in a pause. This face cerebrates and expresses the tangible human form. But life comprises of matter and spirit. In order to express a cerebration of human life, you need to also capture the spirit. That brings us to &quot;the second aspect&quot; the spirit  in man- this is one of the mysteries of human life that makes it very intriguing. To express this aspect of the mystic in human life is very subtle ... yet humans do have this unique ability to know such mysteries.To capture this in a sculpture is a more subtle. How can one  attempt to expresses the universal spiritual energy inherent in man and all objects including this serpentine stone? This is my mission with this so far nameless sculpture.
<br />       The shape of my 25 kg serpentine stone is such that the back of the sculpture’s head has a challenging twist to it. It is not rounded as one would expect. It slopes like a flat board.This defies the creation of a symmetrical head in the conventional sense. 
<br />       After toying with various ideas on how to capture the second phase of the sculpture- the spirit, it was revealed to me to make an expression of spiritual energy within man on this undifined space that defies matter.  
<br />        Now I am  convinced that the expression of the spiritual energy I wish to capture is possible.
<br />        The cuts I chose must be an expression of a hidden force that is so powerful and optimist as to overcome these subdue challenges.  What more can I use as a symbol of this energy  than a out stretched hand to express this concept? 
<br />        The only symbols I could think of to express this energy are created by chipping deep cuts to represent spiritual forces on this  undefined space in my sculpture. This consept did not come easily.I had to listen to the &quot;voice&quot; of the spirit to understand. 
<br />         Mieke kept an eye on the development. She noticed that I was using the wrong tool to form my concept. To capture the human spirit you need a deeper cut and the appropiate tool and energy. I Started chipping away using a forked chisel to cut and define  the energy lines but it was not going well. These lines need to be cut deeper to capture the often unseen strong spiritual forces. “Remember &quot;she said &quot;to use the pointed chisel before the fork.” 
<br />          The fingers and groves representing the spiritual energy should be quite deep and well defined to  to give any impact.  My intention in this expression is that all these lines of force converge at a centre. This centre is the eye of the spiritual storm. What better than to represent this with an eye curved out in the centre of the palm. Is this  a riddle waiting to be interpreted? I think this sculture should have a name The Third Eyed Man.The Third Eye being the spiritual dimention. This is a vision.
<br /><br />The more I reflect on the spirit of the sculpture, the more I am convinced that the riddle has been expressed!  Now if humanity knew that they had a Third Eye would they subdue themselves and the earth?  Now the answer to the riddle is another matter begging for an answer. How can man apply his inherent spiritual force to subdue himself and the earth in the modern age?
<br />          The wise King Solomon once said that  the man who can subdue his own soul is mightier than an army conquering a city. What does this mean? I hope that this sculpture will motivate me to answer that riddle.
<br />                  Soon it was coffee time and Mieke served biscuits and tea. Time flies so fast at the sculpture gardens. But tea time is special. Time stops.  We get to know each other better and further exchange ideas. Today we talked about man's relationship to fear and evil. We also speculated on the life each sculpture would take. When sculptures are finalized and mounted then, they patiently tell a story for ever.

According to the Chinese Agricultural calendar this   is the year of the Black Water Dragon. A dragon is a legendary creature of an extra terrestrial origin. That is means that it is a creature coming from beyond our normal experience.  All legendary stories about Chinese dragons are from the sky, which means heaven in China. In my shaman training, this means something coming from the spirit world.  The image of dragon is mystic or occulted. It is also the symbol associated with mystical powers. This traditional Chinese calendar is known as the &quot;agricultural calendar.&quot; 
<br />     The last appearance of the Water Dragon was 60 years ago in1952. In that year the black Africans in Kenya began their war of liberation against the British government (MAU-MAU war of liberation) that won Kenya's independence. In that struggle the freedom fighters not only used weapons but also invoke the spiritual power to win the war. They had sacred ceremonies at sacred places to where they retreated and prayed to God for courage, and victory. Often those found wounded or dead had clenched fists full of soil. In their manifesto they call for freedom and end of British oppression-Uhuru and the return of their ancestral Lands. 
<br />    As an Apprentice of an African shaman, I am attracted to the concept of the Chinese Agricultural Calendar. It has a cycle of 12 years in which each year has a fixed living symbol- except the Dragon-which is a mystic creature.  2010 was the year of the Rabbit. Next year will be the year of the snake followed by the year of the Horse, Goat,  Monkey, Rooster, Dog, Pig, Rat, Ox , Tiger and Rabbit  in that order. Our African shamans like Laibon Githae have told me of an African agricultural calendar that need to be made more public. It is marked by the rite of passage- circumcision of the boys. It is has a 7 year cycle.  This cycle reminds of Joseph son of Jacob the prophet. While in Egypt he interpreted pharaoh’s dream. There was a cycle of   7 year.The symbol of an Ox , bread and wheat are manifest. These symbols are known to our shamans. 
<br /> Similar to the Chinese Agricultural system, the ancient Mayans had a calendar with even longer cycles. The Mayan calendar has a cycle of a thousand years and repeated   five times. This calendar has shown that 21 December 2012 will be the end of that calendar- that is the end of the 5000 year cycle- also said to be the end of days. Many shamans have interpreted the meaning of this Mayan calendar made more than 5000 year ago. 
<br />    The Mayan calendar has triggered the renewed interest in indigenous spiritual knowledge and set a focus on African indigenous people.  By all reckoning 2012 is a special year. It is prophesied that this is a year where the old world order of restriction to trade and other forms of oppression that affect African will break. The Western financial power and dominance in the field finance and current affairs will fade.  
<br /> I believe that this is the year we shall see a greater emergence of spiritual awareness rooted deeply in indigenous people’s knowledge. The artificial dichotomy between science and mysticism will diminish. The limits on one will be the genesis of the other.  The three hidden qualities of man these are the spirit soul and mind will be clearly articulated and revealed. For instance science acknowledges the mind. The mystics recognize the mind the soul and the spirit of God in man.  The soul is the product of the mind or an internal image oneself. 
<br /> It has been prophesied that this year marks the beginning of a millennium of spirituality. During this year there will be seen an increase in people seeking to visit African holy shrines such as traditional places of worship like Mount Kenya and other special places where Africans once  traditionally worshiped en mass. These places are marked by auspicious living things known to the shamans.
<br /> This knowledge has rather been neglected and crushed by the conservative Westernization philosophy which has embraces a “westernized Christianity”.  This conservative Western culture did not allow the world’s indigenous peoples to express their views nor practice their spirituality. Now, these chains of bondage have been broken. Now Spiritual knowledge can be traced back and resuscitated and brought from   the realms of illegal activity and stereo type. The liberation of these forms of   indigenous spiritual knowledge and wisdom will emerge and gain currency in this Year of the Black Water Dragon. In my view, this is going to bring people closer to nature – the earth, waters, forests and wild animals and spiritual entities. This is not only a great thing for the African soul, but also, it is wholesome for the economy.

<br />             One of the greatest sons of Africa, Kweggyr Aggrey, used to tell the story of a farmer who brought up an eagle among chickens. The Eagle grew up behaving like a chicken and believing he was a chicken. One auspicious day a hunter came by to visit the farmer and an argument ensued as to whether the eagle could remember who he was .The farmer was absolutely sure that he had turned the eagle into a chicken. The hunter asked whether he could try to revive the eagle’s nature. On the first day, he was unable to make him fly beyond the distance that chickens can manage. I told you, said the farmer: I have substituted his soul with that of a chicken. On the second occasion, the same disappointment occurred. He will never learn how to fly, look he walks like a chicken he flies like a chicken and thinks he is a chicken. He has the soul of a chicken. On the third occasion the hunter takes the eagle atop a hill and talks to him, pointed his eyes to the sky and reminding him that he is an eagle. And then it happened. Looking at the limitless immensity of the open sky, the eagle got back its soul and flapped his wings, raised himself, and then up he soared, flying toward the azure.
<br />          The African soul can fly only if it remembers its wings. Re-membering Africa will bring about the flowering of the African renaissance; and Afro-modernity will play its role in ultimately realizing the vision of a common humanity of progress and achievement the will “wipe away the odor of prejudice, and elevate the African race to the height of real godly love and satisfaction. 
<br />         There are important markers in the evolution of the Afro- modernity (the 1900 Pan-African congress in London for instance, or the 1914 birth of Garvey’s Universal Negro Improvement Association in Jamaica); but in my view, the formation of the African National Congress (ANC) in 1912 on the continent crystallized that African idea as an active agency in the construction of the African renaissance. The ANC was the first organization of Africans from diverse nations to fight for justice for the African soul. This momentus event was inspired by the ideas on the New Negro Movement and Pan –Africanism in America, where some of the ANC ‘s founders had interacted with the thoughts of great men like Alexander Crummwell, Booker T. Washington, Marcus Garvey, and W.E.B. Dubois. Pixley Ka Isaka Seme, one of the founders of the ANC, and who in 1904 had written an essay titled “The Regeneration of Africa,” studied at Jesus College in Oxford and at Columbia University in America. He was friends with Alain Locke, editor of the New Negro. In the years from 1896 to 1900, Charlotte Manya Maxeke- another founder member and, later , president of its women’s league- was a student of W.E.B. Dubois.  Salome T. Plaaje interacted with Dubois in the early 1902s in Harlem.
<br />         The ANC was predicated on the African idea. Its anthem Nkosi Sikelele Afrika, took the entire continent as the theatre of its appeal and vision. Its creation marked Africans’ awakening to practical necessity and their ability to confront European capitalist modernity in its white robes. Europe and all her glory and learning was African renaissance worst enemy in the past century. Now we face another century of African Renaissance. What will be our emphasis?
<br />       The Independence of African countries ushered in true African modernity and freedom. In some cases neocolonial struggles hindered true freedom. The launch of the ANC in 1912 and its accession to power in 1994 framed a crucial century that witnessed the beginnings of the African Renaissance. These developments saw explosions of the arts-music, dance and secularism. Thus, just like the energy, vigor, and impetus of the European renaissance in the arts, architecture, and science were only expressions at the aesthetic level,  the energy and tension generated by the  contradictions in the meeting point of two epochs- the old and the new, a dying world and another struggling to be born, much the same was true of Africa where the vigor, contradictions, and tensions of decolonization of the African soul and the rise of an African renaissance meet.
<br />       One crucial phase of the African Reanissance that has not received much energy is the rebirth of our spiritual traditions and culture. How can the   African soul for true liberation without our traditional spiritual knowledge? We have to go back to our shaman's and laibons and re-learn  the spiritual  dimension now lost to many African souls.

<br /><br />At last I am back in Arusha and ready to lose myself into the spirit of my sculpture. I have been away from Arusha for the past eight days since my friend Paul died of cancer on Friday January 27 In Nairobi, Kenya. I am devastated by this loss of my friend Paul.  There was much weeping and grieving among the four hundred friends and relatives who came to bid him goodbye.This was good for my soul. But nothing was as spiritually healing after such loss as to be immersed in a sculpture after a funeral. It  happened that  during this session my mind was tuned to matters spiritual.  Now Paul has gone into the spirit world in heaven and I returned to Arusha and my developing sculpture.  At last I am back in Arusha and ready to lose myself into the spirit world of my sculpture. 
<br />   My sculpture was lying on its side on the floor of the workshop waiting my return. This was a special session because the sculpture I am working on “The Third Eyed man” has to undergo a significant change.  In this phase of my sculptor’s journey, I had to create the spirit of the Third Eyed Man. This phase involved turning the sculpture on its face to capture its spirit. I believe it is a very symbolic phase of the entire work. Opening the third eye was quite a leap in my imagination. It involves curving out a space to reveal the lines of energy that flow out to represent this abstract concept I have called “opening the third eye.”  Eventually after four hours of total concentration of my energy and skill   the third eye began to show. At first very slowly as it opened for the first time. Now gently I worked around the eye lid and on the eye ball to make it blossom into life. Gigi who was present clicked away on a digital camera as I chipped away lost in a spirit world. 
<br />The wonder that comes with creation shone out of the sculpture as I stood it upright to see the effect of the hours of hard work and meditation. What a sight. Where would I keep this wonder was all that was going on in my mind.  I wished aloud that I could work on this for the rest of the day. But so soon did the hours pass. Behind my own head I could feel the third eye opening into the spirit world where Paul was. Yes I can now see backward into heaven.  The Changes in my stone were altogether something I did not imagine.

<br />        I feel that visionaries who embrace deep concern to impact a wholesome African Renaissance may be proportional  to the global number of well informed souls. This is very significant as we are living in a time in which humanity’s problems appear to be reaching critical mass, a time in which our leadership is being questioned at political, corporate, military, and even spiritual levels. Whether the solutions to our problems can be achieved by our current materialistic  methods and leadership is increasingly questionable. 
<br />      In response, increasing numbers of well informed and concerned citizens, whom I call “Renaissance Agents”, are considering the possibility that our problems may not have political, military, or even economic solutions. Rather, the solutions may actually be spiritual in nature, in alignment with the beliefs and values outlined in a new revaluation of our spiritual reality. 
<br />     In addition, as if more and more persons, starting with our children, acquire these altruistic, spiritual based values and beliefs with the fabric of their families, this new way of being will spread throughout the larger society, accelerate this spiritual rebirth.
<br />    Although this awakening has not been reported among the African middle class, and out of Africa generally,  as it has been in America and Western Europe, the invasive influence of western culture and technology upon the rest of the world  suggests that  this reawakening of the spiritual dimension  of our lives will see the light of day.  Kenya’s Central Province  is a case in point that I am familiar with. Where well informed souls are taking a new look at the culture they were taught to ignore as animistic, pagan or otherwise suspect to western conservative culture. This reawakening  may offer on an unprecedented promise of hope for lost African souls. Those lost to materialism in particular, may once again find their way back to a spiritual dimension that places the comunity, the environment and  all humanity as well as a firm guarantee of sweeping changes to come. “We must take heart as we are travelling with an enormous number of allies,” 
<br />          This insight confirms that the Transformational community emerging in Kenya’s  middle class, which is predominantly Christian and western biased,  is of enormous import  and has the power to alter the direction of history  in much the same way the emergence of Christianity utterly changed the Roman world and the Western mind almost two thousand years ago.
<br />         While the time frame for the shift may vary with the ebb and flow of current events, there are no maybes about whether it will happen. The proverbial handwriting is on the internet wall. The history of the world’s people will be profoundly and inescapably changed by the spiritual awakening taking place in counties in Central Province of Kenya and in the West. The results will be felt at every level of the Kenyan society and in the whole of Africa. This spiritual reawakening will by association, determine much of the politics and individual life trends of this century and beyond.

		<document id="f0b27634ab4becdb8ff87b482cb362e9" url=""><![CDATA[Religion, indigenous worship, resistance and African Renaiss<br/><br/> Today 26 February 2012, I read a caption in the Sunday Nation feature page entitled Blomfield: Blame the Mau Mau Not the Colonist.  This feature story has a colored photograph of Mr. Robert Massie-Blomfield. He is a pleasant looking Kenya of British extraction born some 78 years ago. Today, Blomfield teaches Latin and English at Cavina School in Nairobi. He views himself as a true Kenya patriot. 
<br /><br />Mr. Blomfield’s family migrated to Kenya around 1946 when he was only 9. By this time, Mr. Blomfield had begun his education.   Mr. Blomfield is a brave and independent minded man who dares to speak his mind with kind words about the colonial legacy in Kenya.  This is a topic many who hold that view shy away from publicity; many opt to steer away from this unpopular and unpatriotic position. This subject largely represents the shibboleth and test of camp loyalty in a clash between the Western and African cultures. These two sides of the same coin have ardent following.  I have met as many Africans, Europeans and Asians who have sympathies’ with Mr. Blomfield’s positions. 
<br /><br />Mr. Blomfield has publicized his inflexible convictions that the Christian faith and the bible contain the only theological/religious truth.  Conversely, the freedom fighters (Mau Mau) who followed an “African religion” were labeled &quot;pagans&quot; anti-Christ and so on, because they dared the British might. He claims that the Mau Mau war of liberation was counterproductive and it delayed the coming of independence. Furthermore, their actions and thoughts were deemed satanic. 
<br /> The Christian church in Kenya was brought by the Europeans. The Anglican Church in Kenya also tolerated a degree of apartheid policies of the British in Kenya. My mother once told me that there was a chapel in Nyeri that was reserved for the white settlers. All Hotels during that period had a notice that read: “Africans and dogs not allowed.&quot;  Surprisingly long after the cold war, the British embassy in Nairobi and the Anglican Church supported the second liberation. I have no doubt in my mind that this later action speeded up the fall of the Kanu regime in Kenya and ushered in the new dispensation. Why did they do it then and not before is a mystery to me. 
<br /> Mr. Blomfield’s view of an idyllic colonial era is a view held by a few beneficiaries of the system. His view did not take into account the indignity destructive force of the colonial government and the forces of westernization brings to bear on an indigenous society. For starters,the Gikuyu nation was inherently democratic in nature form time immemorial. This is a fact that Mr. Blomfield and his school of thought ignore.  That the Gikuyu people had  enjoyed democracy  for generations before the arrival of the white man. this many sound unreal to many, but it is a historical fact. Save for racial prejudice, greed for conquest, power and inhumanity  and malice; this seems to be the disease that blurred the British view of the Gikuyu people. 
<br /><br />So the question that begs an answer is why then did the Gikuyu people decide to take a sacrament to remove the British if indeed the colonial period was idyllic?  How and when does Mr. Blomfield suggest that Kenya was ripe and ready to get her independence? 
<br /><br />The war for independence was fought by Mau Mau to restore the lost democracy, to restore their dignity, freedom and their sacred land that had been taken by the British. Those who support Mr. Blomfield’s view also argue that the tribes did not have defined land tenure nor have use or value for land let alone  have any land titles to claim any land. Kenya was a vacant land laying idle for the Crown to own and distribute to white settlers for good use. Well Therein lays a riddle. What is the moral here? Where are the Chritian values now?
<br /><br />So, in my view, Mr. Blomfield's school of thought on the matter of Mau Mau and the liberation struggle for Kenya is the Anglican Church position. I do not recall whether the Church in Kenya has never addressed this issue. Does the Church in Kenya  whose knowlege of the bible is authoritative acknowledge that the Jewish religion is similar to the Gikuyu religion?   However, the bible acknowleges that Ngai is Jehovah  why then persecute people who believe in the God of Jesus?   Is it not Biblical to fight against evil just  like Elijah did when he killed the prophets of Baal? So why label the Mau Mau fighters who worship the God of Jesus as satanic and un biblical? Are Blood sacrifices not  bibilical?
<br /><br />Mr. Blomfield seems to forget that the British maintained its hold to Kenya by use of force rather than diplomacy, reason and Christian values. The British were in Kenya for over 70 years by dint of their harsh bark, brawn and sharp weapons and firearms. By targeting the Gikuyu ceremonies and the rituals to discredit that the freedom fighter's legitimacy, Mr. Blomfield is hiding behind a false and  thin intellectual cloak that  need not be pierced to unvail  the real reasons for his opposition to the war for liberation.   He feels that that the large part of the British settles were altruistic fellows who worked hard to transform Kenya into what it is today. I think it is a question of where one finds himself in this historic struggle between the forces of evil and the victims of that evil.  Mr. Blomfield suggests that the knowledge of Christ that was promoted by that government is sufficient justification for colonialism. The  Mau Mau should have had more patience.  It seem to me now that If one comes  from the oppressing class or race and holds their views, then the dignity  of the indignified and oppressed creatures are something that can wait to evolve with time before their cries are heard. 
<br /><br />I have heard other versions from the African perspective that say that the Mau Mau war of liberation was an exercise of a legitimate right to self determination and a sacred duty for the people of Gikuyu. This struggle generated songs that teach us that freedom cannot be taken for granted in the modern world. The British came by might and they could only have left leave by the means they understood and that is  use of terror and unnecessary force, as history has now proved. 
<br /><br />Is Mr. Blomfield opposition to the war of liberation may be founded on the principle that one should not use traditional religious methods to gain liberation?   What was so evil about an African religious ritual to assert sovereignty by demanding an oath of allegiance to the struggle for freedom?  In any event, the oath was an ancient traditional sacrament that bound the Gikuyu   to a sacred cause to sacrifice themselves in defence of their liberty, dignity and their sacred lands. This was a justified oath to rally the Gikuyu people to come forward and lead Kenya into this final war.  War for liberation in the circumstances was  the last option. 
<br /> To this day Mr. Blomfield holds those spiritual sacraments as “satanic” and he has no apologies for it. Notwithstanding that these sacraments and other traditional rituals and ceremonies inspired the ill equipped Mau Mau like David to use a sling shot to bring down the mighty Empire. Mr. Blomfield’s beloved British Empire indeed faltered and fell.
<br /> The Mau Mau viewed the British government as an evil organization that had come to usurp a sovereign nation which had a democratic government older than the British Empire itself. They viewed the Empire as an agent of the devil whose job was to steal, disrupt, and destroy the ceremony of the worship of Ngai and to make it impossible to revive the ancient alters from ever rising again.  Colonialism from my perspective was not just a physical crime of enslaving a nation and denying them their human rights; the British colonialism had a spiritual dimension to smash the worship of Ngai. 
<br /> Mr. Blomfield is said to be a deeply conservative Anglican Christian who tends to view life through the ideologies of his church.  For instance, he says that democracy has only flourished at the expense of Christianity. He has a trait form a long gone Victorian Age that considers Britain God’s appointed authority on Earth. Like the Victorian compatriots, he would prefer to call the colonial adventure a “reformation” enterprise sanctioned by God rather than a crime against humanity sanctioned by Satan, the god of apartheid.   Secondly, he believes that the Mau Mau brought only misery to Africans and that Kenya’s independence came a little too early for Kenya. In this thought, I understand Mr. Blomfield to mean   that freedom came before all Africans had been properly converted into a false people with a false knowledge of God. In this process, Ngai worshipers were labeled as the “Shensi type” meaning savages.  
<br /><br />Thanks to Mr. Blomfield we now have a sober debate on the Colonial legacy.  I see colonialism in terms of crimes against humanity and a litany of many lost opportunities. The British Empire failed to co-exist with God fearing indigenous people in “Eden on earth .“ what does that say about the greatest power on earth at that time? All they brought was an evil agenda to destroy the culture were 100% of the people feared God that placed Ngai above all else. That was the last frontier for this great Empire. Did they not have prophets who warned them against destroying the Gikuyu people or did they ignore their seers? The Colonial government did not have basic humanity, kindness, compassion, respect for diversity and especially racial diversity. The settlers were complaisant to this. One exception was Karen Blixen.  Were there ever colonial powers that came to earth to learn and existed without committing crimes against humanity? Some say that gods came from outer space to teach humanity and to build pyramids and great monuments thousand of year ago. They promised to return. My Laibon has prophesied that the British will return in their numbers as tourists and students not as governors. In terms of one century of African Renaissance, I see the colonial legacy as a challenge rather than a privilege. The Colonial legacy came with it a deep prejudice against African culture. It was label and stigmatized African culture. Today one would have to work very hard to salvage the African brand.  More fundamentally, I thank Mr. Blomfield, for this   debate because it  has enabled me to see colonialism through Mr. Blomfield’s eyes and to revisit my thought about my own existence. This has sharpened my focus on my faith and purpose in this life.  
<br /><br />Mr. Blomfield posts a very challenging conundrum to us all. We must respect him for that. I must thank him for his frankness.  How for instance, do I see this challenge in light of my perception of an African Renaissance?
<br /> There are many Kenyans of British, Asian and African origin who like good Mr. Blomfield believe that the ultimately the jewel in the  colonial legacy brought is that it brought  God to Africans; the church, the school ,the hospital and the only railway system in East Africa. All these are significant elements of an African Renaissance. However, one cannot but look at these as mere bait to conceal   a nasty hook and line in the hand of a swanky agent.   In fact as a result of this interference a lot of Africans were lost; turned away from God (Ngai) to follow a faith that they hardly believed in or understood. How profitable is it then, to lose your soul and gain a railway?  Many African abandoned their practical knowledge and faith in God for a building and congregation graced by a white missionary. The excitement of the train, written word enticed many to the new faith.  But today we teach all children these things irrespective of their creed and colour. It is a basic human right.  That right was traded for a new identity. What is fraud? 
<br /> Today we know we that God cannot be found in the chanting and counting of beads or in a building.  Yet this has driven Gikuyu religious and spiritual traditions and practices to extinction; one can hardly find a Gikuyu clergyman -shaman. I wonder why?  They preached that God does not dwell under trees or on mountains but in churches. That God cannot be found in a forest but in a civilized place called a church.  In any event, anything African was ridiculed and labeled as regressive and had no place in the “industrial world.&quot; Now the industrial word is killing our planet, what we thought was magic and gift of human ingenuity has turned into a monster that threatens the survival of humanity! What folly!  In this day and age, most churches cannot accept those prejudices that were widely respected wisdom only 60 year ago.  London is no longer the center of the world is it? The capital of the world for most Kenyans is Guangzhou and Kenya airways make more money in China than to London. What madness. 
<br /><br />Many colonial subjects were taught that it would take at least one thousand years to develop the Kenyan wilderness to begin to resemble the British country side.  Mr. Blomfield appears to belong to this school of thought. How else would he hold the view that we need to evolve in a calm evolutionary manner. He says we got our independence too early only seventy years on colonial rule?  Would at least 300 years given the desired results? Our independence should have come in 2212! 
<br />These Africans who followed these false doctrines were rewarded with positions in the colonial government. They prospered and built monuments and empires that will last for a long time to come. In this way, the British started to break the Gikuyu tribe into groups.  The Shensi types on one side, “Africans above average” on the other.  In the middle of all this confusion they created a miserably and desperate population. With this form of social engineering the British began to divide the tribe with the aim of creating a “cloned African’ who dreamed of being white. Is this outcome Mr. Blomfield was awaiting for as the signal for African independence? 
<br /><br />African ceremonies and ritual were systematically oppressed or banned. Freedom of traditional worship was banned.   The African religion was banished by the government and with the approval of the church. The clergy were labeled as wizards and driven underground. 
<br /><br />The British believed that with time these harsh and oppressive mean, would produce a new African who did not know anything of his language or his culture and his religion. This evil system of ethnocide could have worked save for Ngai’s favor for his people.  The British were not successful in erasing the Gikuyu religion. The Caribbean islands are a successful experiment of British civilization and colonialism.   Australia, New Zealand, America and many other examples are further examples of what Mr. Blomfield was hoping for Kenya.  All these are living historical records of crimes against humanity; enslavement, ethnocide and forceful movement of population.  In short this can be termed as ethnocide.  These acts were committed by a “Christian kingdom since the 15th century onwards against indigenous tribes. How could the same Empire and its agent have a divine right to civilize and lead the Gikuyu Nation from darkness to find God in the 18th century?
<br />How many African Christians today hold the view that the church has saved Africa from self destructive African culture that was of the devil?   Is this a trick question asked by atheists who have lost their Christian roots?   The truth is that many of our brethren have lost their moral and spiritual compass and they are lost in the pews seeking God.  They have embraced a blind form of westernization whose only saving grace is a cross without Christ in their lives. 
<br /> All human cultures are dynamic. They keep on changing and shedding their weaknesses and folly and sometimes forgetting their values for destructive fashion. The Church too has undergone reformation in its practices and teachings.   Why is there impatience with the African culture?  Why should Africans be under pressure to dismiss our culture for the fashionable western values? Now smoking and drinking are out of fashion even in the west.  Driving will soon be out of fashion.  Free range chickens which we abandoned are in fashion now; organic foods which we abandoned are back in fashion in the west long after we abandoned them for genetically modified varieties. So why are we abandoning our forefathers worship of Ngai?  There has to be a balance and a conscious choice that we must follow. In my view only the Holy Spirit Ngai can reveal these things to us.  Only then can we know what to guard and what to borrow from others. Above all else, we must not confuse modernization with westernization.  
<br />I cannot accept that Gikuyu religious practices are satanic. The obvious conundrum that comes to mind is this: By what mechanism does Christianity inhibit the Gikuyu nation from realizing Ngai’s  spiritual revival- an African cultural Renaissance?  Does an African cultural Renaissance have any significance to modern   philosophy?  
<br />Mr. Blomfield’s view of the political and religious rights of indigenous people does hold any value for African traditions because they are not biblical. I wonder to what extent the Anglicans agree with Mr. Blomfield on this issue.  
<br />The Mau Mau fighters most of them in their 70’s and older have applied  modern human rights legal standards  with  hind sight, to seek compensation against the British government for the crimes against humanity that were meted to them in Kenya starting from 1952 -1959. The entire Gikuyu nation was placed in Nazi type concentration camps. Their crime was to resisting the evil colonial rule.Mr.  Blomfield believes that these are exaggerations created in Calorine Elkins book The British Gulag: The Brutal End of Empire in Kenya.  
<br />This book and others have seriously embarrassed the colonial legacy and the British government. One cannot but feel that the authorities in Britain would like Mr. Blomfield have wished that   this matter had been delayed by another generation, this embarrassment would have lost all credibility particularly because Britain Embassy and its NGO’s around it have cleaned their act and become valiant critic of the Kenyan government over human rights in independent Kenya.  This challenge by the Mau Mau war veterans is a fly in the soup. Fortunately, the British law and in numerous International Conventions cannot countenance abuse of human rights. The Mau Mau suit has passes the legal and morale test and has been admitted for hearing and determination by the Crown Court. In this regard I wish the Mau Mau veterans and my good friend Gatu wa Kahengeri Ngai’s mercies and justice in the British courts. 
<br /><br />This prejudice the British government visited upon innocent Africans in the past three centuries is an anathema to humanity and to Ngai. This I can say without fear of contradiction.  There is no way that the British form of colonialism would be justified as a humane act of civilization of one man by the other. It is rather an act of plunder and destruction of resources and particularly human diversity.  I also reject the notion that Ngai directed the mighty British Empire to colonize and   suck the Gikuyu nation.   The manner in which the African colonialism was practiced clearly show the contempt the British government and other European powers like France, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Germany and Belgium had for darker races people of this planet.  It is grotesque and it cannot be condoned by any legitimate church of Jesus Christ. It also goes against the teaching of Jesus that the greatest commandment is love. 
<br /> In this regard The British sinned against Ngai and his Gikuyu people.  This to my mind was what caused the collapse of the British Empire. Now the British people must seek to meet with the Gikuyu elders for a cleansing ceremony and to agree on general reparation to be paid to lift the curse of the Gikuyu people against the interruption they caused to Ngai’s tribe. Save for this, greater calamity will continue to befall that mighty Kingdom.  Ngai will continue to turn his face against them until they have shown repentance. I do not see what is new or difficult about this.  The government in Australia issued an apology to the aborigines for historical injustices they commited.why then cannot  the British accept to issue an apology for crimes committed against the Gikuyu nation? 
<br />I am of the view that indigenous societies still have something to lend to the global community if they endeavour to rekindle the old flame.  This is possible under Kenya's  new constitution. Under a devolved system of government, Kenyans will choose to lay their emphasis on cultural values first and material things second. 
<br /><br />The freedom and pride we have today as a nation is testimony to the fact that the war for independence was done on time and it could not wait a moment longer. Ngai is great and his wisdom too great to fathom. As it is, the so called &quot;satanic&quot; oath administered by the clergy -sharmans of the Gikuyu inspired the Mau Mau fighters and spooked the mighty British army and the settlers to abandon shop and restore sovereignty back to the Kenyan people. Today I like Mr. Blomfield are freemen in a wonderful country called Kenya. 
<br />Today the Gikuyu people like any other person in Kenya are working hard despite hurdles to revive  our  spiritual practices just like our  forefathers did; just like  Abraham, Moses, Elijah, Meshach , Abednego, John and Jesus Christ reaffirmed our faith in Ngai. 
<br /><br />We too, can now get the divine revelations just like our forefathers did in our free country. The challenges we have with our government; the issues of ignorance, poverty, corruption and disease, all these shall be things of the past and we shall valiantly deal with these ills once we place Ngai back to his place of glory in our lives. This  is the first  order of priorities that will assure us the victory we need as sovereign and proud people.  Ngai must be placed in his place of glory  first in all our dealings and thoughts.  With Ngai on our side we shall overcome the odds and create a land of comfort and plenty for all Kenyans irrespective of their views. If we do so, the British and the whole of Europe will come back in droves to pilgrim in our Holy places and to seek our visions and wisedom and to  worship Ngai with us. 
<br /><br />The new constitution of Kenya recognizes and respects culture diversity. Spiritual and other cultural practices such as those every Gikuyu performed at sacrifices or rituals, rites at the birth, initiation, marriage and death. In all these events communication is established on behalf of every Gikuyu with Ngai the father of all creation. 
<br />As a Gikuyu clergyman's /shaman’s apprentice, I know that the Gikuyu, from whom the core of the Mau Mau freedom fighters came, maintained a close and vital relationship with Jehovah Ngai   the one mighty  God .  
<br />Thaai.

Other indeginous cultures like the Mayans had seen it in their prophesy writen more than 5000 years ago that the dominating Christian and Western culture would end with  the 5th sun in 2012.The old Mayan prophesy in my view  all about the rebirth and rise  of the indeginous culture that was destroyed by Christianity and  western culture.
<br /><br />Drawing inspiration from the initial Agikuyu commonwealth in which  there was harmony between politics and religious or shamanic and ethical precepts I am tempted to think that as a culture the Agikuyu family should  consider their constitutional right to practice and rediscover their culture and history.
<br />             The original  mass harmony that the Agikuyu had with God was robbed from them and replaced with Christianity. There are many truths and values contained in the Christianity that are similar to those taught by indeginous culture. However, the &quot;Western Christians&quot; have doctrine but not the love of Christ in their new religion that they call &quot;Christianity.&quot;  Jesus himself was followed the indeginous jewish religion of Moses, Abraham, Joseph and John the baptist. That religion is no different from what the Agikuyu followed before 1900. Around this time, the Christian English and other Christians from France, Portugal,Germany, came to claim their birth right of conquest. That might is right.The concured and subjugated the Agikuyu people and destroyed their culture and replaced it with a form of  Western Materialist Christianity that had anything but truth and justice. 
<br /> The Agikuyu  people now  have the opportunity to reestablish their culture. This will help them to  have the lost  harmony with God and nature through the new constitutional dispensation. The new constitution has a dovolved structure and creates the position of governor. The governor has the duty to promote indeginous  cultural values and to allocate devolved funds to these functions.In this regard,i see a commited governor focused on three sections of time; the past the present and the future. I define the past as “the foundation of that which is to come”, and the future as “a consequence of that which has happened.” The present is a period for action and vision.
<br /><br />The past is divided into three parts, in which the time before 1900 is regarded as the Agikuyu mass conscious union with God, where a harmony founded on a community of spiritual communion with God reigned. Colonialism destroyed that union and disjointed the harmony, but the disjuncture does not reach its climax until the 2000 after which  the transitional stage which laid the inevitable foundations for the appearance of freedom of association and expression in our modern Kenyan society.
<br /><br />Influenced heavily by the new dispensation, Agikuyu in their   own right must now aspire to lay foundations to assert their own culture in the environment of national unity with other Kenyans.   I will point out that the new constitutional dispensation is not in conflict with the cultural aspiration of any ethnic group... indeed it lays the way for the retrieval of the original social unity, initially expressed through the old Agikuyu commonwealth.  now to be recreated through the disappearance of all forms of suppression and oppression of traditional way of life and to allow it to express itself in its modern form and the re-established unity of spirit and matter as I will enunciate.
<br /><br />I describe the future as a society in which the ideals of freedom of cultural expression in all its forms  and  will be  realized through  asserting constitutional rights to the freedom of conscience. I hope that people will interpret this correctly to mean freed to hold a traditional faith and practises untainted by Westernization and other religious beliefs such as Islam or Christianity.Indeed the Agikuyu did not have a name for their religious practices. We must be jealous to ensure that the crimes against humanity committed by colonial masters do not errod our love for our culture. Central to that is our right to pursue a spiritual and cultural  freedom as enshrined in our constitution without fear. I hope that this  expresses the hope that the change would come about open mindedness to assert our legal rights and to shun any parochial negative ethnicity and all its labels.
<br /><br />Indegionus people must think about the present and the future long and hard. and consider the price they have paid for the conquest and subjugation by the christians.And whether it is an option to continue to being cut off from our culture long after independence. The indeginous people must also consider what is the cost for being cut off from true worship of God, their language, traditions and culture.

But the roots of these conceptions, as well as those of social life in general, lie in the great web of organic life with which the social life is closely and inseparably connected; just as organic life itself is connected with the next life sphere, the cosmic.
<br />There is no absolute line of demarcation between these three life spheres, just as there is no difference between the material and the spiritual life. The three life spheres do, however, form sharply defined grades or epochs within the unified and indivisible universal life. And just as in each individual life sphere, so also in the totality of the universal life, every step toward a higher grade of life must have its antecedents in the lower grade. Compared with the higher order of life, the organic, the cosmic life sphere appears lifeless, especially on the border line which leads from the life of the cosmic bodies to that of the organisms. Here, on the surface of the already cooled-off and stiffened cosmic bodies, we see only the dead residue of the cosmic life sphere, out of which the higher organic life sphere developed. But if we observe the life of the cosmic sphere where it is still being generated and developed in universal space, we cannot deny to it attributes of the divine life-the life that is so beautifully described in our literature in the Words: &quot;Last in creation, first in thought.&quot; The remarkable phenomena which were observed in the modern period, such as the splitting and other changes going on in the double comets of Bielasch and Liais, the solidifying of the cosmic dust, its assumption of the spheroid form and spiral movement, and finally the grouping of these bodies into sidereal and planetary systems, these and other similar phenomena are life processes which can be as little explained by an external and one-sided mechanical gravitation theory, as the process of the division of the embryonic cell or the grouping of the organs in an organism.
<br />Similarly, the human, the social life sphere, rises infinitely higher than the organic, but is in nowise different from it; just as organic life does not differ essentially from the cosmic. Here, also, we meet, on the border-line which leads from the organic into the social life sphere, the natural organic race which, compared with the higher humanitarian life, is spiritless. But in spite of this appearance of spiritlessness, the race is the root of the social life sphere, just as the cosmic bodies were the soil out of which the organisms grew.
<br />Social life is, first of all, a product of the life of definite races, composed of different folk-tribes, each of which has formed its life course in a typical way, In the course of historical development, the typical views of life of the various races came in conflict with one another. From the friction of those antithetical forces were generated the first sparks of the spirit, which contain the germs, out of which higher and more harmonious forms of life will spring forth.
<br />The unity of the human genus is a conception developed in the course of ages through historical activity or a natural idea, inherent in the human soul. The Agikuyu believe that this genius may be  an immediate datum of organic life or a product of the social historical development process. It has the variety of the indigenous tribes as its antecedent, their struggle as its conditions, and their final harmonious cooperation as its aim.
<br />The thus conceived unity of mankind presupposes a plan of the history of humanity, namely, that the multiple phenomena of social life will finally unite and cooperate in a not less harmonious manner than the varied and different phenomena of organic and cosmic life. This unified, divine plan of history is, at present, apparently in its last stage of historical development. But in antiquity, when the nations were still in the grip of natural life, it was only one people, the Agikuyu people of Kenya, which, thanks to its particular genius, was able to perceive the workings of the divine plan in the history of humanity, as well as in the organic and cosmic spheres of life.
<br />If we consider the plan of history, as mapped out in the sacred Scriptures of the Mayans or the Jews, without prejudice, we shall see in it, not only the conception of the unity of mankind, but also the unity of all life, cosmic, organic and social. Our sacred views presuppose the unity of God, in spite of the apparent variety which the word presents, and the unity of the human genus, notwithstanding the differences of races; because the total plan of the history of the world seems to have been always present to the spirit of the Agikuyu people, from the beginning of its history. The entire folk lore and literature of the Agikuyu is to be conceived only from this spiritual point of view. The Agikuyu way of life and their interaction with nature is their historical religion, a historical cult, in contradistinction to Christianity, which is not a natural cult but a compromised creed dictated by king Constantine who was a Pagan and did not know God.
<br /><br />God revealed to the Agikuyu shaman Mugo Kibiru through a dream The arrival of the Christian English and the potential destruction of the entire nation. So in more than meets the eye God guided out forefathers to avoid an early conflict with the Christian English. This genius was not an isolated phenomenon in the 19th century. This  and other supernatural affair is well documented showing that God spoke to his people and guided the Agikuyu during their time of great toment in the hand of the Christian English and the conflict that would eventually unfold. Today the battle continues in subtle forms and by way of propaganda and concealment of the truth.The survival of the Agikuyu on the face of the earth is largely thanks to supernatural spiritual intuition by way of   revelation to his chosen ones among the Agikuyu nation. 
<br /><br />The Christian English had no conception that a black man was capable of spiritual insight outside the real of knowledge. Yet again this is evidence that racisim was a factor in the conquest of Africa.Here we see the ugly head of racism and manifested itself in the manner the Christian English  interpretated events, and the material aspect they saw. Again they were coming from an environment in which they thought that by virture of the matterial knowledge they had the right and might to do as they pleased and to change the course of history without regard to spiritual authority to do so. 
<br /><br />The Christian English came saw and conquered Kenya and her indigenous people. They sawed the seeds of discord rape, theft and  murder became the order of the day as they destroyed the foundation of justice and believe in God. Never before had the Agikuyu seen soo much evil perpetrated with so much impunity of the laws of God and man. All this was again done with the backing of amazing technology and material wealth and arrogance.Eventually, all this came to culminated in great massacres and violence as the Agikuyu people had never seen. Indeed they prayed to God to help them kick out this evil that had come with the Christian English.
<br /><br />Although the Christian English had a conception of the ancient Jewish religion on which Christianity is founded, they could hardly recognize the same religion when it was practiced under the trees rather than in temples. when it was practiced without written word but by heart.One wonders why? is it because they were not Godly? Or is  it  because the Agikuyu were black? 
<br /><br />The Christian English were familiar with  ancient Egyptian monuments which depict indigenous Africans as well as Indo-Germanic and Semitic types, races which have lived from time immemorial in the same land and which were likewise scattered in different countries and climates.Indeed they know that at various times in history the pharaoh was a black man. One now wonders where the root of racism arose to the extent of demeaning the indigenous African to an animal that could be disinherited under international law (Berlin treaty), killed at will, captured and sold as property by the Christian English. It seems to me that 19th century Christianity was just a sham and a veil the Christian Europeans used to get peace of mind.   
<br />The first attempt at a reconciliation of the two types of civilization was made by Christianity, followed by that of Islam, which contested the right to dominion of the former, in Asia, Africa and even in a part of Europe itself, namely, in Spain. Just as the process of conciliation started from the contact of the Hellenic and Jewish cultures, in the ancient Jewish fatherland, so in the meeting of Arabic, Jewish and European cultures in Spain, the second fatherland of the Jews, the final mediation process between the two types of universal history had its origin. But the spiritual spark which arose out of the friction of the two tendencies, and which became the germ of a higher harmonious tendency in which the natural racial antitheses of the historical peoples will ultimately find their reconciliation, this social light germ, the new revelation, should be generated by the indigenous people of Africa who are at the brink of losing their religion and spiritual force.
<br />When Christian England brought the ancient Agikuyu cultural life to an end; they were to arrogant to know that they were destroying a democracy older than their own; a knowledge of God older than their own; there arose, from the ruins of the latter, a new view of the world; and when Christian England struck the mortal blow at the Agikuyu cultural life in the 1900’s when the Agikuyu soon   learned that  the Christian  English were not about to respect the indigenous  people’s rights and that   only violence could liberate the Agikuyu  from the grip of the Christian English. War crimes such as murder mass detention and forceful deportation of population, extermination and torture were committed by the Christians against the Agikuyu people.
<br /> Then there arose again, in the mind of a Agikuyu the concept of liberation and freedom. After an eternity of freedom they had forgotten that there are those who enslave others. So the war for resistance and independence started.
<br /> The people came out of this war in trauma. Many souls were lost. Some were indoctrinated lost their culture. Now the time has come for a   modern world view and a renaissance to bear fruits. Our people at home and in the Diaspora have found out that there is a need for a cultural renaissance. In fact they have learned that there is very little difference between the fundamental truth taught by Judaism and the Agikuyu way of life. This will bring about the reconstruction of our culture pride and spiritual awakening and union with God. 
<br />After the antithesis of the epic clash of the two spiritual tendencies; one Christian and at the wrong end of history and the other the Agikuyu people has gone past its climax, it will be now the time to  give interpretation to our history and culture and to reconcile  the  two points of view. This is the burden of  the Agikuyu people to rise from the ashes and to again seek their God and guide   the Christian English on the ways of the everlasting  God.

<br /><br />The 7th Platoon, G Company, 2nd Scots Guard surrounded a rubber plantation at Sungai Rimoh, Batang Kali, Selangor in Malaya and shot and killed 24 unarmed villagers before setting fire to the village. The only adult male survivor was Chong Hong, who was in his 20s at the time. He fainted and was presumed dead by the Guardsmen. Eyewitnesses include the victims' spouses and children and others, including Tham Yong, aged 17 and Loh Ah Choy, aged 7 at the time. The men had been separated from the women and children for interrogation before the shooting began. The incident today is sometimes described as &quot;Britain's My Lai massacre&quot;.[1] It was in this campaign that Sir Gerald Templer first coined the now famous phrase &quot;hearts and minds&quot; as part of his strategy for victory.
<br /><br />The British Defence Secretary (Denis Healey) instructed Scotland Yard to set up a special task force (led by Frank Williams) to investigate the matter. An alleged lack of evidence gave the incoming Conservative government an excuse to drop the investigation in 1970.
<br /><br />On September 9, 1992, a BBC documentary, an investigative report into the massacre entitled &quot;In Cold Blood&quot; was aired in the United Kingdom and revealed fresh evidence. The documentary included accounts from witnesses and survivors, including confessions of an ex-Scots Guards soldier and interviews with the Scotland Yard police officers who had investigated the case in 1970.
<br /><br />Lari massacre  and the Naivaha Massacres took place in March 1953 in Kenya.
<br /><br />The Lari massacre is well known in Kenya. It took place on 16 March 1953. This massacre was a British government project directed at unarmed civilians. These massacres were commited by the British government against innocent villagers who were targeted because of their ethnicity only.This was also a retribution against the mau mau attack on chief Luka of Lari chief's camp on the night of 15 March 1953. Some women were raped and  some men were castrated before being killed. Houses were set alight and burned down. Cattle was confiscated. The massacres took over 600 Kikuyu  lives and souls in just two days. So far these crimes against humanity have gone unpunished. The Kenya government have never caused any enquiry to be made about this. So cossy was the relationship between the independence government and the British that no questions were asked. what is more, is that the media including the BBC blamed this attack on the Mau Mau. 
<br /><br />Again In March 1953 at Naivasha kenya the British army massacred  many bodies were thrown into the lake and others left to decompose on the fields. The attack took several days. The action was blamed on the Mau May and used as a propaganda tool to discredit the mau mau independence movement.Governor Baring and his masters in Lndon knew what had happenned was a crime against humanity and yet they condoned it on racial grounds. African lives counted for very little then.

<br />Agikuyu people as the American Indians emerged during the past century from the controlling influence of Christian missionaries on the reservations, they are fighting to reclaim their religious heritage and to guard it from distortion by the dominant  Christian culture of the Western world which is associated with modernity and progress. Some Agikuyu just like the  American Indians have expressed the feeling that their religion is a sacred heritage that define them. As such this generation should not allow it to forever perish. That will take away their dignity and identity and reinforce the false notion that they are a lost people. 
<br /> Whether it is  appropriate for  uninitiated persons  non-Agikuyu to be allowed to participating in Agikuyu  rituals such as woprship,initiation,sacrifieces  prophesy and the pilgrimage to holy shrines among them Mt. Kenya (Kirinyaga) is another matter that is open for debate. Some Agikuyu have taken a stance, saying that there is no reason why outsiders should not participate in and learn from Agikuyu  rituals and beliefs in much the same way that they have benefited from the practices of Judaism, Zen, Sufism, Yoga, and other non-European belief systems. As these Agikuyu teachers and spokespeople argue, the world has never been more deeply in need of the teachings (ubuntu) that their tradition has to offer. They acknowlege that majority of the nation is lost to Westernization. However, the challenge ahead  remains to forge ahead as an esoteric tradition before it becomes a mass movement it once was. The individuals of the Agikuyu nation will have  to make their own choices. One thing that seem to unite the two schools of thoutht is that the pilgrimage to Kirinyaga should be open to the uninitiated and to the foreigners alike to come and witness the Agikuyu worship and way of life practiced  by modern Agikuyu who have no hangups towards their ancient culture of enormous value, reaching back to the very earliest forms of spiritual life that were practiced on the earth. 
<br /><br />Archaeologists propose that tens of thousands of years ago a somewhat uniform culture stretched around the world from Africa right across the continent, northernmost regions of the globe from Greenland and Scandinavia to northern Asia and Siberia. The peoples of this circumpolar culture shared many religious beliefs and practices including animism, shamanism, and ceremonies centered around the environment and all its aspects. The culture reached down into China, where it influenced the development of Taoism, and Tibet, whose shamanistic Bon culture left its stamp on Tibetan Buddhism. Beginning as long as 60,000 years ago, the peoples of Africa migrated and influenced other cultures. There is therefore some striking similarities between the culture of the Agikuyu as far as animism is concerned and the American Indians in the plains of North America to Central and South America in beliefs that the earth is a sacred being and its people are spiritual beings. 
<br />The culture of the Native Ameircan conception divides the universe into heaven, earth, and underworld. Distinctions among spirits, divinities, humans, and animals are often blurred. Animals, places, even stones and trees can possess spirits that interact with humans in a kind of cosmic harmony, similar to the ancient concept of kami in the Shinto tradition of Japan. This belief, known as animism, is common among the Agikuyu as well. Among the Agikuyu if anyone drove a spear into the ground in a sacred forest or fell a tree in it or even picked fire wood from it, he would forfeit a goat which was slaughtered and eaten in the thicket itself. To many preliterate religions which hold that personal, intelligent spirits inhabit almost all natural objects, from stones, plants, and rivers to insects, birds, animals, trees, and mountains. American Indians also regard some, but not all, places as sacred; certain locations and animals are singled out as manifestations of the supernatural, including those seen in dreams or visions. 
<br />The native religions of North America, like those of other continents, by and large rely on oral rather than written transmission, which is why they are sometimes called preliterate, or primal, acknowledging their ancient status. In the truest sense, they make up a communal religion; many tribes and members contributing to a tradition which is basically the Agikuyu people. 
<br />Indigenous peoples look on the cosmos as a living womb that nurtures their lives, and so they have less need to destroy or reshape it as more technologically developed cultures do (although today they sometimes abuse the land as people practicing the Westerners culture often did in Africa. do. Their goal could be described as achieving harmony in the personal, social, and cosmic realms, rather than gaining personal salvation or liberation as Western religion does.
<br /> Collectively the Agikuyu are classified as Bantu tribes. This means The People. It is amazing to observe that the terms actually used by tribes such as the Comanche, Hopi, and Lakota Sioux to refer to themselves in their native languages can be translated as &amp;amp;quot;The People.&amp;amp;quot; 
<br />According to historians who have studied the relations between the Indians and the early colonists, the men we call our America’s Founding Fathers were profoundly influenced by their contacts with the land's inhabitants. The idea of uniting the thirteen American colonies came originally from the Indian leader Chief Canassatego of the Iroquois League. In that historic confederation, founded between 1000 and 1400, five and later six member nations had equal voices irrespective of their numbers or seniority -- a forerunner of the Continental Congress and the Senate. The Iroqouis League also had provisions for the democratic political processes known as initiative, referendum, and recall. Even the concept of an open meeting in which citizens exercise an equal voice in decision-making was borrowed from the Indians, along with the Algonquian word for it: caucus. The Indian tradition of having separate leaders for war and peace was also adopted by the Americans (unlike England and many African and Latin American democracies, military leaders cannot serve in the U.S. government unless they first resign their commissions). 
<br />Bejamin Franklin, Tom Paine, Thomas Jefferson, and John Adams, among others, openly acknowledged their debt to Native Americans for the structure of the democracy they crafted. The same revolutionary concepts of government they learned from the Indians were later exported to Europe, where they were carried directly by Thomas Paine. Paine had negotiated with the Iroquois during the American Revolution, tried to learn their language, and sought to incorporate their social structure into the Constitution. 
<br />The Agikuyu on the other hand had a democracy which may be the oldest in the world. This democracy was headed by a senate of elders with a revolving spokesperson who spoke on behalf of the entire tribe. The last such leader was Waiyaki wa Hinga. He was assassinated by the British about 1900. Soon after that the Christian English introduced colonial chiefs who were people who had cooperated with them to dismantle the Agikuyu tribe during the period between 1900 and 1910. These traitors stayed on to become agents of the colonial government even after independence in 1963. 
<br /><br />________________________________________
<br />Shamanism
<br />The Agikuyu religion like the Jewish and Indian religion is interwoven into your life. Everything, the way you live and the way you sleep. The Agikuyu religion is a way of life. To call it a &amp;amp;quot;religion&amp;amp;quot; is misleading. Everything is close to Mother Earth. That closeness now has but vanished and will have to be reinvented all over again. However there still remains pockets of wisdom and culture that may not be too difficult to trace. 
<br />Ron Barton, quoted in The Sacred 
<br />Agikuyu spirituality centers on a collection of beliefs shared by the entire tribe. belief in the Great Spirit Ngai, alongside an animistic belief in individual spirits residing in animals, places, and forces of nature, none of which are seen as higher than the Ngai. As a result, Agikuyu like the  Native American spirituality is nature-based, growing out of a strong sense of interrelation with the earth; shared communal ritual and sacred traditions are accompanied by the teaching of morals, ethics and limits of conduct. This is especially true of North American Indians; Indians of Central and South America follow somewhat different belief systems. The Aztecs of Mexico, for example, who built much of their knowledge and belief on that of the Mayas and other Mezo-Americans (the Toltecs and Olmecs) worshiped over a hundred gods, ranked hierarchically and somewhat bureaucratically like the deities of ancient China. 
<br />Shamanism( mundu Mugo)  is one of the most widely shared components of Agikuyu life. Shamans are spiritually gifted people who through a variety of means have acquired the ability to help others through spontaneous knowledge attributable to Ngai, trance and dream journeying. As in the ancient cultures of China, Tibet, and Northern Russia, North American shamans induce trance states in themselves to facilitate contacting the spirit world and to help heal the afflicted. Shamanic trances can be induced through a variety of techniques, including chanting or drumming, fasting, and in some cases the use of psychotropic substances, the mildest of which might be tobacco, but which can sometimes include entheogens such as peyote and ayahuasca. During these trance contacts, shamans may communicate with spirits of the dead or other spirits and learn what they need to know to help heal the body, mind, or soul of a patient, to locate game, or to predict the future. Because in many tribes almost all men, and some women, went on a vision quest and were said to have contacted the supernatural, sometimes the only difference between shamans and the rest of the tribe was the number or relative power of the spirit guides or helpers contacted by the shamans. 
<br />It is not clear why the Christian English and their colonial and oppressive chiefs were opposes to shamanism among the Agikuyu. White anthropologists have often used the name &amp;amp;quot;medicine man.&amp;amp;quot; But the Christians called them sorcerers and witchcraft to indicate a mixture of shamanic and priestly capacities. In this context, priestly implies the use of rituals, songs, and verbal formulas learned from other priests in the manner of the Brahmans of India. The term medicine man, it does reflect that many tribal shamans were also knowledgeable in the use of hundreds of herbal remedies unknown to Christian English settlers. The 16th-century French explorer Jacques Cartier, for example, had lost 25 of his men to scurvy when a band of Iroquois cured the rest by administering a decoction of pine bark and needles, a source of Vitamin C. 
<br /><br />________________________________________
<br />The Great Spirit
<br />Agikuyu concepts of God are sacred and are not tampered with. People never discussed his person but rather his attributes. For instance his attributes of mercy, anger, punishment providence and protection of the innocent are discussed rather than his person. 
<br />Agikuyu concepts of life after death can also seem contradictory, incorporating elements of reincarnation (either as human or animal), a heavenly afterlife, and ghosts. The often-disputed Indian belief in a &amp;amp;quot;happy hunting ground&amp;amp;quot; is at least consistent with nomadic hunting cultures in Scandinavia and Asia, for whom the afterlife promises an abundance of game. The Agikuyu  agrarian cultures, on the other hand, often saw the afterlife as a subterranean land  where there is plenty of rain and peace and rest. 
<br /><br />________________________________________
<br />Rituals and Customs
<br />Agikuyu beliefs and customs represent a wide range of sources and have evolved over millennia. The rituals embody a sense of communal responsibility reaching back to aboriginal times, and the tradition is tied in with the democratic beliefs of The People. The Agikuyu hand sacred oths that forbade their leaders from corruption. Among the American Indians for instance, anyone elected to a leadership position was expected to give away all his possessions so as not to be able to profit materially from his new position. Related to that is a belief in stewardship rather than ownership of the land. The Europeans who settled America had difficulty comprehending this as they kept trying to buy land from the Indians. In Kenya, the Christian English settlers used the operation of law to take any land that they desired from the people. This is contrary to fundamental Christian teaching. 
<br />Among the Agikuyu for instance, seven ceremonies were taught to tribal elders who had reached various stages of initiation into the council of elders. Those who reached the highest ranks were fit to initiate others to their ranks and also to conduct ceremonies of great importance to the nation.

A destruction based on material greed and an errie mission that enriched Europe beyond her wildest dreams, the evidence of which is visible today in the magnificent cathedrals and capitals in Western Europe. Many omens preceeded the events of conquest of indeginous people.This matter is largly ignored because the indeginous people were subsequently converted into Christianity and they were not encouraged to look back ito the &quot;dark age&quot; of conquest.They were taught not to interpret omens and visions. This is one aspect of the indeginous culture that need to be redressed.Now these people have been impoverished and struck with despair  without their original culture. Is it necessary for them to look back and reconstruct their culture? I think that this is the most important question this generation has to contend with. The answer to this question will break or reconstuct their lost soul, culture and their pride as indeginous people.  Are there any lessons that indeginous people in the 21 century can learn from their  past that affects their future?  It has now become widely accepted that  the knowledge of the conquered indeginous cultures are relevant today.
<br /><br />There are some interesting parallels to be observed between the indeginous culture and the rythms of the &quot;civilized&quot;culture. For instance,the apogee of Mayan and Teotihuacan culture coincides in time with the fall of the Roman Empire. 
<br />During the fourth and fifth centuries A.D. inscriptions based on a partly ideographic, partly phonetic mode of writing became extremely abundant, especially among the Mayas. They testify to the fact that these cultures possessed a profound sense of time and history. The Mayan calendar which ends on 21 December,2012 is further proof that indeginous cultures had something that intrigues 21 century inteletuals . The Mayan calendar, for instance,  was slightly closer to the astronomical year(the atomic clock ) than our own present-day calendar!  
<br /> This pattern of destruction by the Christian West was visited upon the Africans in the 19th Century with similar diverstating  effect. Now, we have the concept of globalization which is a unique opportunity for the indeginous cultures to thrive or for the indeginous people to cut all roots to their past.What  choice the indeginous society have? What omens preceed the creeping globalization? One glaring omen  is climate change, Fukusima nuclear accident and the aftermath, the steps the Japanese people have taken to reject nuclear energy and rever to safer renewable energy sources like the sun the wind and the currents. The other omens are related to greed in the financial markets that have caused a global finacial crises in the US and now in Europe. The meteoric rise of  China - a non western non christian - traditional society? The Face Book, the speed and depth of communication, All these are omens about the future of modern society.
<br />Is It is time to change the Western model of society with aspects of the ancient religion,sprituality and respect for nature in order for humanity to survive  and thrive in the globalised world? Indeginous people must make optimum care not to be sucked into this black hole of modernity. Indeginous people of the world  must see this opening to promote their culture, language,music  and lifestyle using modern media to reach their members and the world. In Africa for instance, the Nigerian films have gained more attention than Hollywood movies among Africans. That is one medium that can be used to advocate and show case indeginous values rather than to caricuture African religous beliefs. Above all, indeginous people   should reconnect with their spititual beliefs and customs festivals and also be flexible enough to let them flourish in the 21 century and beyond. Indeginous people must strive to mark  omens and reflect back to the past inorder to  find their direction in the future.The  Only the  interpretation of  these omens are in the DNA of the indeginous people and their shamans should trust their old ways to find the answers.The question that begs for an answer is  how can we regain our lost culture? How can we overcome the teachings and indoctrination by Christians and Western civilization  that  the indeginous cultures are antithetical to modernity?  How do the indegious people chart their own course and  secure themselves a place in the ranks of &quot;civilized nations.&quot; what will it take to reconstruct and modernise our indeginous soul?
<br /><br />Path of the Conquest
<br /><br />On November 8, 1519, the Spanish conquistadors first entered the great city of Mexico, the metropolis the Aztecs had built on a lake island. Don Hernando Cortes, who was accompanied by six hundred Spaniards and a great many native allies, at last could see for himself the temples and palaces about which he had heard so many marvels. The Spaniards arrived from the direction of Tlalpan, to the south of the city, passing across one of the wide causeways that connected the island with the mainland. When they reached a locality known as Xoloco, they were welcomed by the last of the Motecuhzomas, who had come out to meet them in the belief that the white men must be Quetzalcoatll and other gods, returning at last from across the waters now known as the Gulf of Mexico. Thus Cortes and his men entered the city, not only as guests, but also as gods coming home. It was the first direct encounter between one of the most extraordinary pre-Columbian cultures and the strangers who would eventually destroy it. When the Old World and the Aztecs in the New World met face to face on that November day in 1519, their attitudes toward each other very different. The Aztecs, as we have said, thought the strangers were Quetzalcoatl and other &quot;gods&quot;returning from over the sea, while the Spaniards-despite their amazement at the splendors of Tenochtitlan- considered the Aztecs &quot;pagans&quot; and thought only of seizing their riches and of forcing them to become Christians and Spanish subjects. 
<br /><br />The conquestidors wrote their own version of events,largely trying to rationalise genocide and war crimes and racisim, and crimes against humanity. But these chronicles present only one side of the story, that of the conquerors. For some reason-scorn, perhaps-historians have failed to consider that the conquered might have set down their own version in their own language. This book is the first to offer a selection from those indigenous accounts, some of them written as early as 1528, only seven years after the fall of the city. These writings make up a brief history of the Conquest as told by the victims, and include passages written by native priests and wise men who managed to survive the persecution and death that attended the final struggle. The manuscripts from which Miguel León-Portilla's book &quot;The Broken Spears have drawn are now preserved in a number of different libraries, of which the most important are the National Library in Paris, the Laurenziana Library in Florence and the library of the National Museum of Anthropology in Mexico City.

I woke up from my dream and saw my spirit standing in front of me. my spirit  was strong and bright.I could see it with my inner eye. This is the first time I have seen my own spirit. I panicked and tried to wake up my physical body. 
<br />It was a small step forward to further experience. The next time i wake up my spirit i will travell.  Next time the spirit leaves the body, I will be ready. I will travel past the stars out to the centre of the Milky Way called to the place of prophesy called the Xibalba bay.
<br /> I had a good day that Saturday May 26. I had gone to my sculpture class and had worked on the spiritual eye of my sculpture, and touched the magnetic lines of force that converge on the spirit of the Stone. By the end of the day i was exhausted but excited. I came home and eventually slept like a baby.
<br />  In my sleep I say my rural home, some 400Km away.In my dream i was sleeping when i hear a disturbance coming from the chicken coop. I felt compelled to wake up and find out what the matter was and probably frighten the intruder which i thought was a mongoose.  In my dream i knew that there was a disturbance at the chicken coop because i cold see the disturbance. I could see my home and the chicken coop and the area around it.  It was moon light  in my dream, somehow i could feel the disturbance by sight.  At that point i became conscious that I was asleep and i had to  wake up to see do my manly duties and explore  the cause of the commotion. but instead my spirit rose out of my body and i saw my spirit standing infront of  my bead near where i lay in my bed in Arusha. The spirit was looking relaxed and just standing looking at the curtain in my dark bed room.
<br /><br />For a few seconds i looked at my spirit though my eyes were closed. An emotion started to whip up in me.  I  realised that  I  was looking at my spirit. It was like a cloud in a human form.My heart began to pump harder, and I felt the need to take the opportunity to explore; to go out to some place. By then I was not sure of where or what i wanted the spirit to do. By this instant I had forgotten about the chickens. In just a moment when I thought I should raise up to see the spirit while I was awake and my eyes open, the spirit vanished and returned to its invisible seat. What a pleasant experience.
