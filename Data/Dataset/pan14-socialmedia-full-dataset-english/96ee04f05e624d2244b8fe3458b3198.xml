<br /><br />The sweet taste of love 
<br />Still lingers in my mind 
<br />A succulent tasty morsel 
<br />A treasure worth its find 
<br /><br />A wet and juicy fruit 
<br />That fills my mouth with joy 
<br />Like candy to a baby 
<br />An edible sexy toy 
<br /><br />With nectar sweet as honey 
<br />A syrup of flowing silk 
<br />Like a bubbling kind of lava 
<br />As smooth as warm clear milk 
<br /><br />It breathes with scented oils 
<br />Like a flower in the mist 
<br />And blossoms when caressed 
<br />By the feel of a lover's kiss 
<br /><br />A dessert at its very best 
<br />When embraced with lots of love 
<br />And I can't seem to get enough 
<br />Of this treat I'm thinking of.

<br /><br />Like COVERING UP the real me, when I should show the truth to you.
<br /><br />Or when I sit down and look into MY OWN MIND,
<br /><br />I should let you know about the SATICFYING NIGHTMARES I find!
<br /><br />DARK SHIT, that really shouldn't amuse.
<br /><br />Like putting a gun under my chin, and biding my brain ADIEU,
<br /><br />And my HEART MAKING LOVE to a knife.
<br /><br />And being SATICFIED with my body being ABSENT OF LIFE.
<br /><br />Now my head is full of WTF's and Y's,
<br /><br />Cause this SHIT made me loose THE MOST BEAUTIFUL EYES!
<br /><br />Therefore my heart's emptier than before,
<br /><br />And I'm traped in this DARK ROOM, with a giant steal locke door.
<br /><br />My mind and heart is lossing control,
<br /><br />Becasue I can't bring them back together as a whole.
<br /><br />And my body being LOST with my MIND and HEART.
<br /><br />I'm trying to get better, but im TORN ALL APART!

<br />I still do as it would seem.
<br />I find myself thinking of her night and day.
<br />From my work my mind tends to stray.
<br />Now I just can't stop thinking about,
<br />The time I just let this thought slip out.
<br />See I do love her, so that it seems.
<br />Just thinking about the girl of my dreams.

<br />I'm between your legs, but I can't feel your thighs.
<br />The maple brown color captures my heart,
<br />And pierces my love like a golden dart.
<br />You close your eyes, and you disappear.
<br />Now I'm crying because you're no longer here.
<br />I'm sad and only you know why. 
<br />I'm just sitting here without your sexy sight in my eyes.
