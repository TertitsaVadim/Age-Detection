<br />Its origins date back to the Celts for over 2,500 years, when the Celtic year ended in late summer, on 31 October in our calendar (Samhain). The cattle were brought from the pastures to the stables for the winter. That last day, it was assumed that the spirits could leave the cemetery and take over the bodies of living to rise, asking food and cursing. They were victims of spells if they refused his demands: give me something or I make a prank, which is the translation of &quot;Trick or Treat (Trick or Treat).
<br /><br />To avoid this, the Celtic villages and houses littered the &quot;decorated&quot; with bones, skulls and other unpleasant things, so that the dead spend long scared. Hence the tradition of decorating houses with sinister motives in the current eve of All Saints and costumes. It is therefore a party associated with the coming of the pagan gods to life.
<br />The church of Rome decided to convert to Catholicism holiday. Was established on 1 November as All Saints Day, which in England was called &quot;All Hallows 'Day&quot;, and the night before &quot;All Hallows' Eve&quot; which later led to &quot;Halloween.&quot;
<br /><br />The party was exported to the United States by European immigrants in the nineteenth century, around 1846. However, no mass was first celebrated in 1921. That year was the first Halloween parade in Minnesota and then was followed by other states. The internationalization of Halloween came in the late 70's and early 80's thanks to movies and television series.
<br /><br />At present, children dress for the occasion and walk through the streets demanding candy door to door. After knocking the children pronounce the phrase &quot;Trick or treat.&quot; If adults give them candy, money or any other type of reward, is interpreted to have accepted the deal. If instead they refuse, the boys spend a little joke.
<br /><br />Halloween is a holiday based on fear, death, undead, black magic and mystical monsters. The &quot;characters&quot; that are typically associated with Halloween include ghosts, witches, black cats, goblins, the banshees, zombies and demons, as well as certain literary figures such as Dracula and Frankenstein's monster.
<br />The Celts used to dress in animal skins on October 31 and not being discovered by the spirits, they say, that night come alive. Hence the current practice of dressing up that day. The traditional colors of Halloween are black of night and the orange of the first light of day. Halloween symbols autumn also include elements such as pumpkins and scarecrows.
