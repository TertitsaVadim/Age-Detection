<br />If I'm not skinny enough for you to see my ribs.
<br /><br />I'm sorry..
<br />If I'm not pretty enough to be &quot;your girl&quot;.
<br /><br />I'm sorry...
<br />my boobs aren't big enough to &quot;satisfy&quot; you.
<br /><br />I'm sorry..
<br />If I'm not a playboy model so I don't act like a porn star for you.
<br /><br />I'm sorry..
<br />If i don't have a dream body that turns you on.
<br /><br />I'm sorry..
<br />If I'm too short for you.
<br /><br />I'm sorry..
<br />If i won't drop down to my knees to get you to like me.
<br /><br />I'm sorry..
<br />If my hair isn't just the way you like it.
<br /><br />I'm sorry..
<br />If I'm not the &quot;hottest&quot; girl you have ever seen.
<br /><br />But most of all...
<br /><br />I'm sorry that most guys can't accept a girl for who they really are. Beauty dies with time but a good heart will always be young.
<br /><br />If you're a girl and you agree with this letter, repost as &quot;I'm sorry.&quot;
<br /><br />If you're one of the few GUYS with enough balls to repost and you would never make your girl feel like this, repost as &quot;you're perfect&quot;

<br /><br />We don't care if you talk to other guys.
<br /><br />We don't care if you're friends with other guys.
<br /><br />But when you're sitting next to us, and some random guy walks into the room and you jump up and tackle him, without even introducing us, yeah, it pisses us off.
<br /><br />It doesn't help if you sit there and talk to him for ten minutes without even acknowledging the fact that we're still there.
<br /><br />We don't care if a guy calls you, but at 2 in the morning we do get a little concerned.
<br /><br />Nothing is that important at 2 a.m. that it can't wait
<br />till the morning.
<br /><br />Also, when we tell you you're pretty/ beautiful/ gorgeous/
<br />cute/ stunning, we freaking mean it.
<br /><br />Don't tell us we're wrong.
<br /><br />We'll stop trying to convince you.
<br /><br />The sexiest thing about a girl is confidence.
<br />Yeah, you can quote me.
<br /><br />Don't be mad when we hold the door open. Take Advantage of the mood im in.
<br /><br />LET US PAY FOR YOU!
<br /><br />DON'T &quot;FEEL BAD&quot;
<br /><br />We enjoy doing it.
<br /><br />It's expected.
<br /><br />Smile and
<br /><br />say &quot;thank you.&quot;
<br /><br />Kiss us when no
<br /><br />one's watching.
<br /><br />If you kiss us when you know somebody's looking, we'll be more impressed.
<br /><br />You don't have to get dressed up for us.
<br /><br />If we're going out with you in the first place, you don't have to feel the need to
<br />wear the shortest skirt you have or put on every kind of makeup you own.
<br /><br />We like you for WHO you are and not WHAT you are.
<br /><br />honestly, i think a girl looks more beautiful when she's just in her pj's. or my tshirt and boxers, not all dolled up
<br /><br />Don't take everything we say seriously.
<br /><br />Sarcasm is a beautiful thing. See the beauty in it.
<br /><br />Don't get angry easily.
<br /><br />Stop using magazines/media as your bible.
<br /><br />Don't talk about how hott Morris Chesnutt, Brad Pitt, or Jesse McCartney is in front of us.
<br /><br />It's boring, and we don't care. You have girlfriends for that.
<br /><br />Whatever happened to the word &quot;handsome&quot;/&quot;beautiful&quot;
<br /><br />I'd be utterly stunned by a girl who greeted me
<br />with &quot;Hey handsome!&quot; instead of &quot;Hey baby/ stud/ cutie/ sexy&quot; or whatever else you can think of.
<br /><br />on the other hand im not sayin i woulndnt like it ether ; )
<br /><br />Girls, I cannot stress this enough: IF YOU AREN'T BEING TREATED RIGHT BY A GUY, DON'T WAIT FOR HIM TO CHANGE. DITCH HIS SORRY, DISGRACE-TO-THE-MALE-POPULATION ASS, AND FIND SOMEONE WHO WILL TREAT YOU WITH UTTER
<br />RESPECT
<br /><br />Someone who will honor your morals.
<br /><br />Someone who will make you smile when you're at your
<br />lowest.
<br /><br />Someone who will care for you even when you make mistakes.
<br /><br />Someone who will love you, no matter how bad you make them feel.
<br /><br />Someone who will stop what theyre doing just to look you in the eyes....and say &quot;i love you&quot; ..
<br /><br />........AND ACTUALLY MEAN IT!

<br /><br />Not many girls appreciate nice guys anymore...
<br />And because of this, there are not many left out there...
