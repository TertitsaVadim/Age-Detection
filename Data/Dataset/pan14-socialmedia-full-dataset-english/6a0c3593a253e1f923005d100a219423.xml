<br /><br />MOMMY
<br />I am only 4 inches long
<br />but I have all my organs.
<br />I love the sound of your voice.
<br />The sound of your heart beat
<br />is my favorite lullaby.
<br /><br />Month Two
<br /><br />Mommy
<br />today I learned how to suck my thumb.
<br />If you could see me
<br />you could definitely tell that I am a baby.
<br />I'm not big enough to survive outside my home though.
<br />It is so nice and warm in here.
<br /><br />Month Three
<br /><br />You know what Mommy
<br />I'm a boy!!
<br />I hope that makes you happy.
<br />I always want you to be happy.
<br />I don't like it when you cry.
<br />You sound so sad.
<br />It makes me sad too
<br />and I cry with you even though
<br />you can't hear me.
<br /><br />Month Four
<br /><br />Mommy
<br />my hair is starting to grow.
<br />It is very short and fine
<br />but I will have a lot of it.
<br />I spend a lot of my time exercising.
<br />I can turn my head and curl my fingers and toes
<br />and stretch my arms and legs.
<br />I am becoming quite good at it too.
<br /><br />Month Five
<br /><br />You went to the doctor today.
<br />Mommy, he lied to you.
<br />He said that I'm not a baby.
<br />I am a baby Mommy, your baby.
<br />I think and feel.
<br />Mommy, what's abortion?
<br /><br />Month Six
<br /><br />I can hear that doctor again.
<br />I don't like him.
<br />He seems cold and heartless.
<br />Something is intruding my home.
<br />The doctor called it a needle.
<br />Mommy what is it? It burns!
<br />Please make him stop!
<br />I can't get away from it!
<br />Mommy! HELP me!
<br /><br />Month Seven
<br /><br />Mommy
<br />I am okay.
<br />I am in Jesus's arms.
<br /><br />He is holding me.
<br />He told me about abortion.
<br />Why didn't you want me Mommy?
<br /><br />Every Abortion Is Just . . .
<br /><br />ONE MORE HEART THAT WAS STOPPED.
<br />TWO MORE EYES THAT WILL NEVER SEE.
<br />TWO MORE HANDS THAT WILL NEVER TOUCH.
<br />TWO MORE LEGS THAT WILL NEVER RUN.
<br />ONE MORE MOUTH THAT WILL NEVER SPEAK.
<br /><br />If you're against abortion, post this as...
<br />I dont care how many friends i lose over this

<br /><br />There are not enough words to describe how rong and sick this is! It is just rong!
<br /><br />you are one sick person if you dont repost this i feel for you if
<br />this doesnt touch you because this is just wrong. read this. its disgusting
<br /><br />Walking in my nighty; rubbing my eyes
<br />My fathers sitting on the sofa with his friend
<br />He pats the seat in the middle; i sit
<br />Shivering so cold; a quilt he lends
<br /><br />&quot;Jessy you love me don't you&quot; a smile; his
<br />Their breathe spirts weep
<br />&quot;Daddy you know i do; what is it?&quot;
<br />He smiles at his friend; his hand creeps
<br /><br />His friend takes my hand; looks me in the eyes
<br />Daddys creeping up my nightie; cold hands
<br />I try to pull his hand away;
<br />their grip is strong!
<br />They look at one another; nod; something planned
<br /><br />I feel my palms sweat; Daddys under my knickers
<br />&quot;Daddy im going to bed! Night&quot; Pulling again
<br />But there grip is to strong for weak me
<br />I look at both; and ask, who are these men?
<br /><br />His fingers going up me; pulling away
<br />His friend leans forward; a kiss? Why?
<br />His toungue moving mine; my eyes squint
<br />Lean back and away; &quot;Why are you doing this?&quot;
<br />No answer, i feel the pain inside me; him
<br />Chucks the quilt on the floor; me to
<br />I try and scamper away, but im not fast
<br />&quot;O Daddy please, i love you&quot;
<br /><br />His friend; pulling at my nightie
<br />And my Dad pulling my pants down
<br />His friend pinning my hands to the floor
<br />As my Dad lies himself on the ground
<br /><br />I squirm; as Daddy friend pulls me up
<br />And places me ontop of Daddy; thrusts within
<br />I cry; i bite; i scratch; i slap; i fail
<br />&quot;O Daddy please you win you win!&quot;
<br /><br />I can feel my skin rip; my virginity breaking free
<br />I can feel the blood seep down my leg
<br />&quot;Daddy your hurting me please&quot;
<br />I plead to him and his friend; not even a beg
<br /><br />Daddys laughing; why does he laugh?
<br />His friend shoves himself in my mouth and moans
<br />Tieing my hands together; moving in and out
<br />&quot;Ride me Jessy&quot; He laughs and groans
<br /><br />They smile at one another; laugh to
<br />They roll me over and spread me wide well
<br />My daddy sits on my face; himself in again
<br />While his friend talks and pushes himself inside
<br /><br />I can hardly breathe; i gag for air
<br />I cough and splutter; cry and weep
<br />I beg and plead; but its no use
<br />Theyve already made me hurt and bleed
<br /><br />I stare into his eyes; that look upon me
<br />This is not my Dad; where is he?
<br />If he was still here; would he care
<br />Would he actually even; see?
<br /><br />Finally they get of and lie me on the sofa
<br />My cheeks blouchy from tears and pain
<br />They play with them selfs; all over me
<br />Rub it in; making me feel the shame
<br /><br />&quot;Why Daddy? Please tell me why?&quot;
<br />Dad looks at his friend; and waves him away
<br />&quot;Jessy i love you&quot; he smiles and kisses my cheek
<br />&quot;Is that all you have in your heart to say?&quot;
<br /><br />He puts my nightie on me
<br />he walks me to my bedroom door
<br />Ever since that night; His friend
<br />And himself every Friday come back for more
<br /><br />&quot;Night sweet Girl; You are my life&quot;
<br />Closing the door, tears still down my face
<br />Still the smell of him and his friend
<br />Fade into me like disgrace
<br /><br />I watch the Moon go down; the sun come up
<br />&quot;Jessy its school&quot; Knocking at my door
<br />I cant help but cry; weep in pain
<br />Because im so scared he wanted more
<br /><br />But one night daddy took it too far
<br />Daddy and his friend came back for one last shot
<br />They were worried they would get caught
<br />So he and his friend took me to a cemetary lot
<br /><br />I was blindfolded and my hands were tied back
<br />&quot;Daddy please!! Not tonight!&quot;
<br />Daddy and his friend both had their last fun
<br />After that i tried to put up a fight
<br /><br />I begged daddy &quot;Please no more!&quot;
<br />All he could say &quot;Shut up, you stupid Bitch!&quot;
<br />Daddy unblindfolded me at last
<br />He said I love you so much
<br /><br />He went back into the car and pulled out a bat
<br />&quot;Daddy I swear I wont say a thing!!!!&quot;
<br />I was dead
<br />After only one swing..........................
<br /><br />**... Please if you care for all the children and women who have been raped
<br />repost this bulletin with the Headline &quot;daddy please no&quot;
