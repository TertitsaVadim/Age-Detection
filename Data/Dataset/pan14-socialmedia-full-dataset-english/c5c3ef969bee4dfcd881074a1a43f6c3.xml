The decision to act on some advice is purely personal but I know from my experiences and what I have passed through in life, there are a lot of things I know which others might not have experienced. My pastor said something on Sunday that when he wants to do some things that may seems difficult for him all he does is to say it in church and he knows that haven done that there is no way he can go back on it. I will stand for the truth and what is right even if it means standing alone that does not means that Praise is perfect but I know that I have some Strong points. “Man know thyself”

God in his wisdom has given us free hands to make our choices and our founding fathers in their wisdom have enshrined freedom of expression in the constitution. One striking truth about God is that God will not do those things He has given us the power to do. In reforming AG I believe every opinion needs to be sampled, nobody should be made to feel intimidated to air his or her views though we must not always agree, that’s the way life is. Be wise

It’s too bad that standing a distance of about ten minutes walk from Govt House in the night. Fear will grip you. No Street light in the state capital. This is unacceptable sir. My village Nkpa has no road, in fact its okada that one can use to travel in my village. This is not good sir.
<br />The truth is that when travelling to the east by night, once you enter Niger Bridge, it’s like saying welcome to the strong hold of darkness. You will feel as if you are in a different world. No Street lights even on the bridge, this is pathetic. Most of the roads are good and motorable but when a governor builds beautiful roads and forgot to put street lights, his job hasn’t finished. It’s painful that when you are in a place that is working and you travel home, the reverse becomes the case. I am begging the Eastern Governors to please build the East and make it attractive. God bless you.

Obama in his characteristic manner has been a good orator, so watching him make a speech is not just exciting but the audience will pray that he don't stop quickly because of the gesturing, the analysis and the oratory prowess of the man in question.
<br />This time around his speech focused on something that is so important not just to American as a country but also of global relevance. The searching and eventual killing of the leader and founder of Al-Qaida Osama bin Ladan is something the American government has been so committed to in the last ten years.
<br />Thinking about the sorrow it brought to them as a nation and the kind of terror this group has displayed world over is something that made the American government to see the capturing of Osama as a top priority. This goes a long way to demonstrate as in every human endavour that whatever you are committed in doing; you will eventually achieve the desired result someday. This commitment and resilience paid off on Monday may 2nd 2011 when Osama Bin Ladan was killed in a military action by the United State in his house in Pakistan.
<br />Coming home to Nigeria, we need to analyze the situation and ask ourselves whether our government can go that length in protecting the lives of the citizens more especially after the lives has been lost. One striking thing about Obama's speech was when he said that they will go to any length in ensuring the safety and protection of their citizens. There have been many instances of killing in our country, killing of youth corpers has become the order of the day even recently, killing of the non indigenes of a state is freely exercised mainly in the northern part of the country.
<br />The big question now is “when will our government learn from these incidents that happen in other parts of the world?&quot; It is not a big task to fish out the perpetrator of these evil in our country and bring them to book but the government has not being committed in doing that. The bottom-line is that protection of the lives and properties of the citizens is not the priority of government but it should be. This serves as a wakeup call to the government of the day to rise up to its responsibility and give its citizens the needed protection.

<br />Just last week on this page, I was pleading with Grace to stop pasting the pictures of those murdered in the north following the riot that broke out after the announcement of the presidential election results because those pictures were mind blowing and disturbing, she said sorry and explained. Little did I know that greater one lies ahead. I was moved with tears at work today while reading a report on this day newspaper of Saturday 23rd April 2011 on the tragic and barbaric killing of Ukeoma Ikechukwu and Obinna Okpokiri among others. It’s so sad that these two guys came back from London to serve their fatherland and they were gruesomely cut short. To all politicians who instigate violence, you will definitely pay, it is their turn today nobody knows whose turn it will be tomorrow if this evil is not stopped. There is no justification whatsoever for taking a fellow man's life. God is watching and He will definitely avenge the death of these innocent souls. My heart goes out to the Parents and Sibblings of those that are murdered, its only God that can console you. And to those in authority please use your office to bring to book all the perpetrators of these evil no matter how highly placed they may be. Once again God is watching and He will pay the evil doers back in their own coin. We can't be talking about development when innocent blood are being shade every now and then. Something needs to be done and urgently too. Thanks for reading Please join me in this fight. May God have mercy on Nigeria...... Uguru Praise

<br />A Nigerian Singer (Musician) did a song few years back and the song says (eh get plenty plenty things wey no suppose to happen for this life…plenty plenty things, plenty plenty nonsense). Most times I listen to all sorts of Nigerian music because I know that when some incidents occurs a song that suits the situation readily comes to my mind. Yesterday at the University of Lagos, I was with some of my friends, we were sharing information and also I was sending some mails which I did earlier and some of them didn’t get it. So I brought out my laptop and connected my modem and we were doing our thing and exchanging pleasantries because I haven’t seen some of them for a while now and also strategizing for one of us that is wedding very soon. We were through with what we were doing and I logged off. All these took place at the balcony beside the gate of the FSS Shopping Complex there was no light in the campus so we have to stay there to do our thing and still waiting for the light to come for those that have some other things to do. Folding back my laptop to put it back in my bag two young guys rushed to me and dragged the laptop, saying yes this is them then I asked what’s the meaning of this and what offence have I committed and the reply was that when I get to the station I will know and their bus drove into the complex with Unilag logo and FGN Number Plate as usual, when I saw the bus I told them that I am a government worker and don’t deserve to be treated like this. All my friends with me were very surprised and inquisitive trying to know what really happened before one man in the team took time to explain to us that they are taskforce and is trying to sanitize the institution because the heard the some people are taking advantage of the ICT to do all sorts of fraud and illegal business. I now told him that one we are not aware of this and secondly the approach is very wrong, nobody demanded to know what we were doing before grabbing the laptop and  my bag put them into their bus, I further explained that I schooled here and also a prospective postgraduate student. They now said I should go and explain and apologize to their head – one Mrs. Fadakar, initially I was a little bit reluctant to do that because I have not seen any offence I committed but my friends have starting pleading and kneeling down to the Ultimate woman – Mrs. Fadakar, then I have to join after asking me where I work and my level and stuff like that my things was given back to me but she told me that my approach was very wrong by saying that I am a government worker and doesn’t deserve to be treated like that, that it means that when I get to the top I will be slapping people. Honestly I don’t see anything wrong with what I said, come to think of it Unilag is a federal government institution and I worker with another federal government institution and for government agencies in the same educational sector to be intimidating themselves is what I wasn’t comfortable with that made me to say what I said and I have no apology. 
<br />Let’s look at this issue objectively; one, if there is such laws it should be made known, secondly the approach of implementation should be polite and decent, normally when a law enforcement officer wants to arrest you, they first of all introduce themselves and show their identity card and now tell you that you are under arrest for committing so or so offence, in some instances from what I have read an invitation will be sent to you which if you didn’t honour it, the issue will then get to the previous state. These guys are civilians no uniform no introduction. Unilag claims to be” THE UNIVERSITY OF FIRST CHOICE AND THE NATIONS PRIDE” this presupposes that the institution should be a Role Model in Learning and in Character which is very much enshrined in her Vision Statement and the incident of yesterday never displayed such. My thinking is this – when laws are made it should be made known and the mode of implementation should be polite not to be crude, intimidating and embarrassing. As much as I know and from my research and studies, the Academia is always in the habit of criticizing the government for their policy and also their implementation but when such incidents happens in an Academic environment, it is totally UNACCEPTABLE and that is the display of NONSENSE in fact it’s NONSENSE at its peak which made me to use that song to introduce this write-up. Let me even ask. When did it become an offence to use a laptop in a higher institution? Unilag been among the pioneers of e-learning in Nigeria I still have their publication to that effect in the punch newspaper in my archive that was during the tenure of Prof. Ibidapo Obe  it is very wrong to do some things, everyone reading this may not really understand where I am coming from but my thinking is that the Academia should show example to the government in the way the carry out their activities because it is believed universally that leaders are molded or trained in the universities but when the reverse becomes the case we all should rise against it. If there are laws please let people know about it and when one goes against the law please let the due process be followed in applying the necessary discipline after all the Constitution which is the Bible of the Country says that a suspect remains innocent until proven guilty by a competent court of law. For me intimidation should not be used in this time and age, this is democracy for crying out loud not to talk of using such in an academic environment it is very much unacceptable. Thanks for reading

I work in the Public Sector where we are exposed to certain information more especially government information but it depends on how willing you are to read. When president Olusegun Obasanjo started his second term we had a rumour that a star is coming into his economic team and we all looked forward to who the star will be and further enquires revealed that prof. Charles Soludo the then economic adviser to the president is the start in question. Till tomorrow I have a lot of respect for President Obasanjo because he was able to expose some of the best brains Nigeria can parade at that time in his appointments, you have an option not to agree with me on this. When Soludo came to the economic team he work so hard to certify his purported star status and his work gave birth to the coming of NEEDS, SEEDS and LEEDS. As we all know NEEDS means National Economic Empowerment and Development Strategy to arrive at SEEDS and LEEDS substitute the S for State and L for Local. This concept worked very well and till date it is still Government development plan I stand to be corrected. I think this and other innovative approach to his work made President Obasanjo to appoint him the CBN Governor. During his tenure as the Governor of Nigeria’s apex financial institution the distinguished professor introduced some new thing which is still applicable till date, one of such is the FSS2020 – Financial System Stability 2020, among others followings:
<br /> The Central Bank Governor Professor Charles C. Soludo had on 6th July, 2004 addressed a special meeting of the Committee of bankers in which he outlined some elements of the current banking reforms. Main complements of the reforms however are listed below and include:
<br />i.	Minimum capitalization for banks of N25billion with full compliance by 31st December, 2005;
<br />ii.	Phased   withdrawal   of   public    sector   funds   from   banks; starting in July, 2004;
<br />iii.	Consolidation of banking institutions through mergers and acquisitions;
<br />iv.	Adoption    of    a    risk-focused    and    rule-based    regulatory framework;
<br />v.	Adoption of zero tolerance in the regulatory framework, especially in the area of data/information rendition/reporting;
<br />vi.	Automating the process for the rendition of reforms by banks and other financial institutions through the enhanced Financial Analysis and Surveillance System (e-FASS).
<br />vii.	Establishment of a hotline, confidential internet address (<a href="/go/messages/send/receiver=Governor@cenbank.org">Governor@cenbank.org</a>) for all those wishing to share any confidential information with the Governor of the Central Bank on the operations of the banks or the financial system;
<br />viii.	Strict enforcement of the contingency planning framework for systematic bank distress;
<br />ix.	Establishment of an Assets Management Company as an important element of distress resolution;
<br />x.	Promotion of the enforcement of dormant laws, especially those relating to the issuance of dud cheques, and the law relating to the various liabilities of the board members of banks in cases of failings of the banks;
<br />xi.	Revision and updating of relevant laws, and the drafting of new ones relating to the effective operations of the banking system.
<br />xii.	Collaborating closely with the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) in the establishment of the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) and the enforcement of the anti-money laundering and other economic crime measure; and
<br />xiii.	Rehabilitating with effectively managing the Nigerian Security Printing and Minting (NSPM) Plc to meet the security printing needs of Nigeria, including the banking system which constitutes over 90 per cent of the NSPM's business (Central Bank of Nigeria, 2004).
<br />Evidently, the banking industry's operational performance was not in the best of states when the current reforms were introduced.
<br />What a lot of people don’t know is that some of the things that the present CBN Governor is doing are not started by him. This is because government is a continuum like he said during his lecture in Kano on the introduction of the Islamic non-interest banking that the model was supported by relevant Nigerian laws and was approved by his predecessor prof. Chukwuma Soludo. I actually feel disappointed when I read comments of some Christian religious leaders on the banking model and I placed it that they are either not well informed or has refused to do their research very well before talking. Let me state this obvious truth that if you are a pastor or an imam and you want to have a balanced view on national issues you should at least have the holy book of the other religion(s) for pastors they should have a Quran in their libraries and find time to read it in some cases and for imams or Alfas they should have Bible and find time to read it. Writing this article I have had a Quran on my laptop over the years and I do read it sometimes but I am a practicing Christian that does not take away anything from me. Despite the fact that it is a holy book, it is also a reference material. Some of my view here will centre on what I read from the Quran as well as the Bible because both have information on the non interest banking model being discussed. Also other research that I have carried out before coming up with this will come in handy. In primary economics we were told that a bank is financial institution where money and other valuables are kept for safe custody. And there are many other functions and types of banks.
<br />On the Islamic banking according to Pan African Plc (2011) report History has shown that banking system is among the most imperative aspects of any developed and thriving economy and financial system. A functioning banking system helps to create a more successful and efficient society. Banks facilitate in the transfer of resources from those with excess to those who require extra resources to run their businesses. It is a known fact that banks like any other firm are in business to make money and banks major source of income or profit is the difference in interest rates at which they pay to their depositors and the rate at which they lend to companies and entrepreneurs. Under the Islamic Jurisprudence, depositors’ returns are managed not by a predetermined fixed interest rate, but by the size of the bank’s return on its investments. When disbursing loans, the bank functions as an investment bank, whereby both the investor and the bank not only share the benefits of high returns on investments, but also share the losses. If return on investment is high, the bank will take a percentage of the investor’s profits. This is impossible for conventional banks, which just receive the interest that they themselves fix at the time the loan was made not minding whether the loan receivers made profit or loss.
<br />Non-interest banking can be traced to some young Muslim economists in late forties who believed banking systems should be reorganized on the basis of profit sharing rather than interest rate. They have all recognized the need for commercial banks and the evil of interest in that enterprise, and have proposed a banking system based on the concept of profit and loss sharing. 
<br />The CBN new banking model allows the establishment of the following banking structure as defined by BOFIA 1991:
<br /> I. Commercial Banks 
<br />II. Merchant Banks and 
<br />III. Specialized Banks
<br /> Specialized Banks include non-interest banks, microfinance banks, development banks, mortgage banks and such other banks as may be designated by the CBN from time to time. Guidelines for some of the specialized financial institutions, e.g., microfinance banks primary mortgage institutions and finance companies have been issued under a separate cover. Guidelines for other categories of non-interest banking will be issued upon request which shall be consistent with international best practice. In an a nutshell, CBN defines Non-interest Financial Institution (NIFI) as a bank or Other Financial Institution (OFI) under the purview of the CBN which transacts banking business, engages in trading, investment and commercial activities as well as the provision of financial products and services in accordance with any established non-interest banking principle. This clarifies that the non interest banking is all inclusive so far as you are going to operate according to the laws establishing it. This I believe draws the line between Islamic banking and non interest banking. According to Wikipedia free encyclopedia (2011) Islamic banking (or participant banking) is banking or banking activity that is consistent with the principles of Islamic law (Sharia) and its practical application through the development of Islamic economics. Sharia prohibits the payment or acceptance of specific interest or fees (known as Riba or usury) for loans of money. Investing in businesses that provide goods or services considered contrary to Islamic principles is also Haraam (forbidden). While these principles were used as the basis for a flourishing economy in earlier times, it is only in the late 20th century that a number of Islamic banks were formed to apply these principles to private or semi-private commercial institutions within the Muslim community.
<br />Coming to the issue of Usury which is in simple terms the taking of interest, lets please look at these old testament quotations:  
<br />[Exodus 22:25] If thou lend money to any of my people that is poor by thee, thou shalt not be to him as an usurer, neither shalt thou lay upon him usury.
<br />[Leviticus 25:36] Take thou no usury of him, or increase: but fear thy God; that thy brother may live with thee.
<br />[Leviticus 25:37] Thou shalt not give him thy money upon usury, nor lend him thy victuals for increase.
<br />[Deuteronomy 23:19] Thou shalt not lend upon usury to thy brother; usury of money, usury of victuals, usury of any thing that is lent upon usury:
<br />[Deuteronomy 23:20] Unto a stranger thou mayest lend upon usury; but unto thy brother thou shalt not lend upon usury: that the LORD thy God may bless thee in all that thou settest thine hand to in the land whither thou goest to possess it.
<br />Then from the Quran let’s check these out; 
<br />O you who believe, you shall not take usury, compounded over and over. Observe God, that you may succeed. (Al-'Imran 3:130)
<br />And for practicing usury, which was forbidden, and for consuming the people's money illicitly. We have prepared for the disbelievers among them painful retribution. (Al-Nisa 4:161)
<br />The usury that is practiced to increase some people's wealth, does not gain anything at God. But if people give to charity, seeking God's pleasure, these are the ones who receive their reward many fold. (Ar-Rum 30:39).
<br />In making policies in our dear country, we should take cognizance of the peculiarities of the country. This is a place where loans can only be accessed by only the strong and mighty or the big names. This is a place where your certificate and bright business ideas does not guaranty easy access to finance. It has been said that economy thrives on the growth of small business and if this is not done the economy suffers. What does a business man want? Or what does a person that wants to startup a business wants? The primary question is Finance – cheap one at that, remember your financial management and when someone is offering you fund interest free with the view of sharing profit and loss with you is that not a boost to your ideas. My thinking is this, if non interest banking or Islamic banking or whatever they are called can make funds available and accessible to the teeming unemployed youths please let it be embraced. For me it’s not totally free because I am sure that the necessary feasibility study and analysis of the viability of the business will be done. They are only trying to build a relationship because it will take a fool to leave who supported you when you are nobody to look to someone who never believed in you. When you are given money to start a business and it grows naturally other financial transactions  will be channeled to the bank, they may charge COT though I am yet to clarify that. If this banking model will make our economy lively please let support it but if you think it’s against your faith please don’t patronize it after all using a bank is not by force and it’s like a product which you can decide not to buy. Our religious leaders should please look for ways to better the lots of their followers that’s a way of giving back to the society (CSR). MORE importantly as a Christian I hope I can be allowed to access loan from an Islamic financial institution without discrimination because if there is discrimination the aim will definitely not be achieved. Please let Sanusi bee allowed to do his job. God Bless Nigeria

<br />This very issue has dominated political and economic discussions in our country for some time and the information has been very prominent ever since even when it is not discussed the way it is done presently. In writing about it my own way, I tried to look at what a business is, what a church is and also explained tax. 
<br />Dr Dixon Ogbeche of the university of Lagos in her business policy class in 2010 defined a business as any undertaken that is established to create utility. Utility on the other hand is the satisfaction derived from consuming certain goods and services. This implies that if utility is created some one will be willing to compensate for the time and skill invested in that venture by paying for it.
<br />According to Encarta dictionary (2009) Church (movement), the historical movement that arose from the life and ministry of Jesus of Nazareth. Christians believe that God founded the church through the work of Jesus and that it is sustained by the continual presence of the Holy Spirit.
<br />In New Testament Greek, the most common word for church is ekklesia, meaning “assembly.” In the Greek version of the Old Testament, the word ekklesia was used to render the Hebrew qahal, which denoted the gathering of people for worship. In the New Testament, ekklesia refers to a local Christian community.
<br />The New Testament offers many metaphors for the church, four of which follow. One, it is the body of Christ. Christ is the head, Christians the many members. Two, the church is related to Christ as branches to a vine. A more intricate and pervasive relationship is implied by this image than by the image of the body. Three, the church is the bride of Christ, an image that stresses the personal, intimate quality of the relationship and the depth of mutual commitment. Four, the church is the people of God, a description that stresses, on one hand, the continuity of the church with Israel and, on the other, the church's potential universality.
<br /><br />In primary economics, tax is defined as a compulsory levy imposed by the government on the citizens, non-diplomatic residents and property owners within the country irrespective of the exact amount of services rendered to the tax payer in return. 
<br />Taxation is a system of raising money to finance government. All governments require payments of money—taxes—from people. Governments use tax revenues to pay soldiers and police, to build dams and roads, to operate schools and hospitals, to provide food to the poor and medical care to the elderly, and for hundreds of other purposes. Without taxes to fund its activities, government could not exist.
<br />Throughout history, people have debated the amount and kinds of taxes that a government should impose, as well as how it should distribute the burden of those taxes across society. Unpopular taxes have caused public protests, riots, and even revolutions. In political campaigns, candidates’ views on taxation may partly determine their popularity with voters.
<br />Taxation is one of the most important sources of revenues for modern governments, typically accounting for over 40 percent or more of their income. The remainder of government revenue comes from borrowing and from charging fees for services and also from natural resources. Countries differ considerably in the amount of taxes they collect. In the United States, about 30 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP), a measure of economic output, went for tax payments in 2000. The 30 percent figure is relatively low from a historical standpoint. As a result of a new round of tax cuts in 2003, the tax percentage share of GDP was expected to be lower than at any time since 1959 when many major government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, did not exist. In Canada about 35 percent of the country’s gross domestic product goes for taxes. In France the figure is 45 percent, and in Sweden it is 51 percent.
<br />In addition to using taxation to raise money, governments may raise or lower taxes to achieve social and economic objectives, or to achieve political popularity with certain groups. Taxation can redistribute a society’s wealth by imposing a heavier tax burden on one group in order to fund services for another. Also, some economists consider taxation an important tool for maintaining the stability of a country’s economy.
<br /><br />If churches should pay tax- for me it’s a yes, please I will explain, here the church is looked at as a business because income (money) comes in and if that is the case tax should be paid remember the definition above covered both profit and non-profit making organization which means that the church provides utility. Some people argued that our Lord Jesus paid his tax (Matt 17 V 27). This issue looks very controversial because there are many things that come to play here – the church is a nonprofit making organization if it has to pay tax then it is no more a nonprofit making organization. It is true that many churches more especially in the cities make more money than businesses that are operating legally and also pay their taxes. The income that a church gets is not sometimes you can sit down and determine, the reason for this is simple; giving offering in churches is not by force i.e. it is done willingly. If you sit there and enjoy all the spiritual blessing that goes on in the church and you decide not to give nobody will chase you away but it also places a question mark on your Christianity because the foundation of it is giving. The root of Christianity is love meaning you can give without loving but you cannot love without giving so if we really love God and want to serve him sincerely we must give. Looking at this objectively, there is no guaranty that a church that makes a net income of 200 million in February 2012 can make the same in March because the offering pattern is not static, even tithes that appear to be compulsory in Christendom yet some people don’t pay. The bottom-line on this point is that the income pattern of the church varies, in taxing it a lot of work has to go into it. The fact that a church is big is no proof that they are making money. Some churches exist to contribute to the society, help the less privileged and also spread the gospel of Christ.
<br />Another point is this; if churches are to pay tax, government should be ready to make the environment they operate to be more business friendly and they (churches) may slow down on some of the corporate social responsibility (CSR) programs that they do because some part of their income will now go to government as tax. 
<br />Paying tax will serve as a check mechanism to some pastors, for some men of God, it is their time to laugh and enjoy and as a result of that accountability is thrown to the wind, imposing tax on them will now make them to be more conscious on how they manage their income.
<br />For me instead of taxing the church let them be mandated to invest in the life of their members and the community where they operate more especially the less privileged members because they are the future of the church. A situation where proceed from a church is used to finance the building of a world class university that even ninety percent of the members of the church can’t afford is not really the best. If government imposes that, it may have to create a ministry of religious affairs which will among other things see that there is fund available always to help those that wants to set up churches to open shop. Also other measures has to be in place to enable the churches succeed not a situation where they are left on their own to survive at their own expense but they still pay tax at the end of the day. The truth however remains that running a church is no tea party, whether you own your own or you are engaged somewhere because there are issues and challenges that will confront you which will make the pastor to run if he is not called. I advice the government to look for other area of generating revenue instead of taxing churches but let the churches be socially responsible.

<br />The history of financial sector reforms in Nigeria cannot be complete without talking about the attendant pains that comes with it each time a major reform occurs. As we all know, government and its policies is like two edges sword meaning that it favors some and also makes some to weep, that’s the way government has been over time and will continue to be.  The recent disengagement of the workers in Intercontinental and Oceanic banks is something that sent waves down the body of many and it has raised a number of questions. Merger and acquisition in the banking sector in recent times has a lot of surprises that comes with it. The one conducted under Prof. Soludo’s regime was somehow more positive from the present ones under Mr. Sanusi, I stand to be corrected. Intercontinental Bank sacked some workers but I think that of Ecobank raised a lot of dust. Naturally there are three things that happen to someone on a job – it is either you leave the job on your own or the organization asks you to leave or nature does his own (death). Having said that every worker is expected to be proactive wherever we find ourselves. I have read a lot of stories about Ecobank and the workers they promoted and the casuals they converted but they said nothing or little on the ones they retrenched wrongly. For Intercontinental Bank I read also about the ones they disengaged I therefore come to the conclusion that most of the things we read in the newspapers are packaged report mainly when it has to do with corporate organizations. Few years ago in a church service Sam Adeyemi said that one thing about the media is that they have a way of making you see what they want you to see which is very correct.
<br />I feel very strongly that some of the workers that were unduly sacked deserve a better treatment than they got. The reason is simple,  when you are marrying a wife you are marry both her assets and liabilities, you don’t have to accept the assets and throw the liabilities to the wind because if you do that you are only looking for trouble.
<br />I blame the government on one hand for all these, take for instance the guy that worked for ten years as a casual worker in Oceanic Bank and after this exercise he was disengaged and given only N971,523 to feed himself and his family that for me was very unfair but for some it was a prayer answered. A guy that got N35m and another that got N24m can quietly go into business if they have such ambition or take their time and look for another job. For those that are staff I think they were treated better than the casuals if my studies are right though some people will just say they have sacked me just to get people’s sympathy without telling you the real story. For the casual workers, I know this may sound a bit harsh but it’s just the truth most of you knows that from the terms of contract on your appointment letter you have nothing to benefit from when you are going and more importantly you are not the responsibility of the entity you worked for but that of the organization that hired you. So if you are so employed – casual and this incident happens and you are protesting and complaining for me I think that you are just pushing the limits. Another angle to it is this, when you are on a job as a contract staff and you are not staffed after some years please use your experience and go to where you will be staffed it’s as simple as that. I know a lot of people that are doing very well in the banking sector today most of them started as casual before they moved. A couple of years back a friend told me that his brother that works with UBA collects N30, 000 monthly while the guy that sits beside him and does the same job like him pockets close to N200, 000, the same qualification, the same time of entry but the only difference is the mode of employment and that can be very painful but after a year or thereabout the guy moved to another bank and was staffed and he naturally became a big boy.
<br />The issue is this when some people have problem (s) and they see a temporary solution they tend to forget to look for a permanent solution. In most job vacancies in Nigeria experience plays a big role in getting you by so I see no reason why you will be a casual worker and after five years you are still there. That’s why I said that some people are not just proactive, it is this same class of people that will go into the university with deficiency in either English or Mathematics and they will not do anything about it until final year or till the school send them away.
<br />For some of my friends that are experiencing this, I really feel your pain but my advice is that you look inwards and see what you can do please. For the policy makers they should get their acts right in making some of these decisions because this have the capacity to impact negatively on the organization (s) both in the short and long term.
<br />This is just my honest view. 
<br />Thanks for finding time to read.
<br />God bless you
