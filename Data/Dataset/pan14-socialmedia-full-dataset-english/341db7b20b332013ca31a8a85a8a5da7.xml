Working parents have struggled to find camps or baby-sitting, kids are bored and teachers fret over &amp;quot;summer slide&amp;quot; — the academic losses that research shows hits kids from poor families hardest.
<br /><br />Year-round schooling might seem like the antidote, and in some parts of the country, schools with just a few weeks off are not uncommon. In Raleigh, N.C. and other parts of Wake County, for instance, July 9 was the first day of school for 26,000 students on a year-round calendar.
<br /><br />But year-round schools, which once seemed like a panacea for everything from low test scores to overcrowding, have proved to be a mixed bag. And some places that once embraced them — including Las Vegas, Salt Lake City and parts of California — have returned to traditional calendars.
<br /><br />Research on whether learning improves in year-round schools is mixed, with some year-round schools reporting gains and others finding that kids on traditional schedules do better.
<br /><br />Esther Fusco, a professor at Hofstra University's School of Education, Health and Human Services, says that overall, &amp;quot;research suggests that students in high-needs districts and those who have disabilities do better in year-round learning situations. This is logical because these students do not have the down time that occurs over the summer. But the results are not very significant. I have not seen any study that shows students greatly improve.&amp;quot;
<br /><br />Parents unfamiliar with the year-round concept may not realize that kids on these schedules usually have the same number of school days — about 180 a year — as kids in regular schools. But vacations are distributed differently. So instead of having 10 or 12 weeks off in summer, kids might have a series of three-week breaks. Or they might have six weeks off in summer with additional two-week vacations. For parents who need child care, those repeated short breaks can actually mean more headaches than one long summer break.
<br /><br />Year-round schools also typically cost more to run, thanks to air-conditioning, extra transportation costs and other expenses. And it's harder to make major repairs when classrooms are empty only for short periods.
<br /><br />Salt Lake City ended its year-round schools in 2011 after an analysis showed that comparable local schools with traditional calendars had better test scores, according to Jason Olsen, spokesman for the Salt Lake City School District. Going back to the regular calendar also saves the district money, Olsen said.
<br /><br />And yet, the year-round calendar has its fans. A survey showed that a majority of Salt Lake City parents preferred year-round schools to the regular calendar. &amp;quot;They liked having two weeks away from school every nine weeks,&amp;quot; said Olsen.
<br /><br />Shannon Oelrich, of Cambridge, Minn., loves having her kids in a year-round school that's offered as an option in her district on a first come, first served basis.
<br /><br />&amp;quot;I think it's good,&amp;quot; she said. &amp;quot;The kids don't get as bored for the long break in the summer, and it's good to have a couple of breaks in the middle of the year. They're happier. And when they spend less time away from school, the teachers don't waste so much time reviewing.&amp;quot;
<br /><br />Some year-round schools also use the short breaks for enrichment or remediation, which can keep struggling students on track throughout the year rather than dumping them in summer school.
<br /><br />The year-round concept is also popular among some charter and private schools, where it's seen as a way to make sure kids don't lose ground during long breaks.
<br /><br />But Ann Barrett took her two kids out of a year-round program in Jacksonville, Fla., in the early 1990s, partly because she had an older child in high school on a traditional calendar and they had no vacations together.
<br /><br />She transferred her younger two to a magnet school that went by the regular calendar, but she said that within a few years, the year-round schools in her district returned to the traditional schedule because, &amp;quot;they never had any success to point to. It's one of those things. They try it for a couple years, then go back to the regular thing.&amp;quot;
<br /><br />In districts where year-round calendars are adopted to ease overcrowding, children are placed on what's called a multitrack system with staggered vacations. This can be a huge cost-saver: The kids are never all there at the same time, so the school can accommodate more students in the same space.
<br /><br />In California, multitracking began in the '80s as a way to cope with &amp;quot;an upturn in elementary grade enrollments — the baby boom echo,&amp;quot; said Fred Yeager, a spokesman for the California Department of Education.
<br /><br />Multitracking meant the state didn't have to build as many new schools, and the shorter summer breaks were thought to combat &amp;quot;the learning brain drain,&amp;quot; he said. But the number of multitrack schools has since gone down, to 95 from several hundred in past years, Yeager said.
<br /><br />In Wake County, N.C., where 50 public schools are on the year-round system, &amp;quot;we definitely use the year-round calendar to maximize space and address some capacity issues,&amp;quot; said spokesman Mike Charbonneau. &amp;quot;We have had a rapidly growing school system for the last 10 years.&amp;quot;
<br /><br />Clark County, Nev., which is the Las Vegas school district, also used multitrack year-round schedules to cope with overcrowding. But enrollment has been falling in the area, and all the schools there have gone back to traditional calendars.
<br /><br />Up-to-date statistics on year-round schools are hard to come by. The most recent data from the National Center for Education Statistics found 14 percent of U.S. public schools were on year-round calendars in 2008, with the largest percentage in the South and West.
<br /><br />Billee Bussard, who runs an organization in Florida called Summer Matters, says there's another piece to the argument against year-round schools.
<br /><br />&amp;quot;The year-round calendar limits the window of opportunity for parents to give their children learning experiences outside the school walls,&amp;quot; Bussard said, echoing many parents who cite the importance of extended family time, opportunities for summer camp or travel, and summer jobs that help teens earn money and build resumes.
<br /><br />West Virginia has a few schools with what is referred to in the state as the &amp;quot;balanced calendar&amp;quot; — meaning breaks more evenly distributed throughout the year. In June, the statewide West Virginia PTA passed a resolution supporting balanced calendars as a way to combat summer learning loss.
<br /><br />With parents divided in their preferences and conflicting research results, the debate over which calendar is best may come down to the way Justin Raber, West Virginia's PTA president-elect, put it:
<br /><br />&amp;quot;It is a discussion that each individual community should have to ensure that the educational system is meeting the needs of their greatest asset — the children.&amp;quot;

My wife chose one particular room because it has a wood-burning fireplace. This is probably a stupid question, but will the innkeeper light a fire for us, or do we have to do it ourselves?
<br /><br />Neither one of us knows how to build a fire, nor do we want to spend our anniversary watching instructional videos on YouTube. Nor do we want to burn down the inn. Help!
<br /><br />A: Call and ask the innkeepers. I would guess they would be happy to do it for you. But it wouldn't hurt to get comfortable maintaining a fire, even if you don't build it yourself, so you don't need to keep calling the innkeeper back for help if you need to add a log. I would check if a friend or neighbor has a patio fire pit. Perhaps if you brought over a bottle of wine, he or she would give you a crash course.
<br /><br />Q: I don't fly very often, but I understand that sometimes the overhead space is limited on small planes and people have to check bags at the gate. So I wasn't surprised when the gate agent made an announcement about this when I was waiting to board my flight last week. However, I was surprised when she said you had to remove any lithium batteries from your bag if you were going to check it. Is this some new rule? I wanted to ask the gate agent, but she was busy.
<br /><br />A: U.S. airlines haven't allowed passengers to pack spare lithium batteries in checked bags since 2008, actually. The reason is that these batteries, while generally not dangerous, can burn at very high temperatures if they happen to ignite. I think the logic is that if that were to happen in the cabin of the plane, a flight attendant could use a fire extinguisher and put out the flames, but if a fire started in someone's checked bag, deep in the belly of the plane, no one could get down there to fight the fire. They make the announcement at the gate because a passenger might have, say, a spare lithium battery for a digital camera in his carry-on. That battery shouldn't be in the bag if it's gate-checked -- the passenger should carry it onto the plane. For the record, if a lithium battery is installed in something, it's OK in either a checked or carry-on bag; you just can't check a loose lithium battery.

<br /><br />Following a feisty exchange with the spokesman for environment, councillor Elsie Martlew, he was escorted from the chamber by chief executive Jason Gooding and director of governance Mark Lambert.
<br /><br />Mr Shaw, of Merith Avenue, Botcherby, had asked councillors: “How are you going to control the dog fouling, littering and rubbish where I live? I have never seen it so bad.”
<br /><br />He accused the authority of ignoring his complaints, adding: “It’s not very nice for people to have to pick up dog fouling when they’re paying the council for a good service.”
<br /><br />Mrs Martlew described his actions as “pretty crude”.
<br /><br />She said: “I’ve been around Botcherby. It isn’t bad at all. It is a shame a resident is talking the estate down.”
<br /><br />She said the Labour administration, which took control in May, took street cleaning “very seriously”.
<br /><br />“The Labour group proposed an extra £85,000 for two years [for street cleaning] in the budget and this has made a significant difference to what we can do,” Mrs Martlew added.
<br /><br />“We are looking at the whole service, more mechanisation – there are new vehicles on order and one was delivered today – and street cleaning has been synchronised with recycling collections.”
<br /><br />A rapid-response team had been set up to tackle grot spots. And a three-strong education and enforcement team would soon be

(AAPL)’s <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL211bGJlcnJ5YmFncy5nZWV0Lm1lLw__" target="_blank">Mulberry handbags online sale</a></strong>.
<br />“We didn’t start in a garage but in a shed behind our house, ” co-founder Markus Freitag, 42, said of an upbringing where he and his brother Daniel, 41, made the toys their parents didn’t get them for Christmas as kids. Three decades later, the siblings operate namesake Freitag shops from New york to Tokyo.

<br />From a flagship store cobbled together with 17 freight containers in Zurich’s hip Zueri West area, Freitag now has nine stores, including on Prince Street in Lower Manhattan, the Ginza district of Tokyo, Berlin, Vienna and Davos, home of Switzerland’s annual World Economic Forum. Their bags, while common on Zurich streets and among Swiss business workers, don’t have the pricy cache of Prada, the Italian fashion house, or Louis Vuitton, the French maker of laminated canvas handbags.
<br />Raised by composting parents, the brothers aren’t looking at the top end of the retail market. Instead, they were avid bikers who got the seed for the business after watching freight trucks draped in tarps pass the apartment. Seeking something functional and rainproof, the first bags for students and bikers were carved from truckers’ tarp <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5tdWxiZXJyeWhhbmRiYWdvdXRsZXRzYWxlLmNvLnVrL2JheXN3YXRlci1iYWdzLWMtMS5odG1s" target="_blank">Mulberry Bayswater</a></strong>.
<br />Freitag acquaintance Roland Bruemmer, owner of the Dings shop by Zurich’s main train station, was the first to sell the distinctive bike bags two decades ago. He just didn’t think colorful water-repelling handbags made of tarpaulin, old seatbelts and bicycle tubes would endure.
<br />‘An Evergreen’
<br />“We thought it was exciting but never imagined that it would last 20 years, ” Bruemmer said. The brothers, a display artist and graphic designer, sold 300, 000 bags and accessories last year, 15 percent more than in 2010 and more than twice the 140, 000 of five years earlier.
<br />“We’ve seen so many new brands and products in the past 20 years, but Freitag was one of the only brands that really pulled it through, ” Bruemmer said. “People don’t wonder if it’s in or out, they just know it’s a good product. It’s an evergreen now. ”
<br />The company, with more than 130 employees, designs, manufactures and markets products from ipad covers, purses and wallets to the best-selling, distinctive unisex biking bag. The Museum of Modern Art in New york added a Freitag bag to its designer collection in 2003.
<br />Freitag isn’t listed on the Swiss stock exchange while an initial public offering is a possibility for a company whose bags clung to the shoulders of fans at Bruce Springsteen’s concert this month in Zurich.
<br />Biggest Challenge
<br />“Who knows, maybe one day, ” Daniel Freitag said at the “Out of the Bag” exhibition at Zurich’s design museum that ends July 29. “It’s never been our plan to go public. We’re a family enterprise and we like that we can be true to ourselves and not have shareholders telling us what to do. ”
<br />While the company has been able to grow, the biggest challenge isn’t finances. It’s finding enough usable tarpaulin, especially with exotic colors and designs, the brothers said.
<br />That task belongs to four Zurich-based employees responsible for finding tarps all over Europe. Demand is such for a product with no real competition that the company uses about 390 tons of tarpaulin a year.
<br />Once a tarp arrives at the Zurich factory in suburban Oerlikon, it’s washed in rainwater collected in an underground basin that’s pumped to a washing machine, air dried and photographed. It’s then taken to a work table where a cutter decides the design of the bag. Remnants are recycled.
<br />Bags, iphone
<br />The messenger bags cost 190 francs ($192) to 398 francs while the iphone sleeve costs 60 francs. Freitag’s recent Reference collection of more elegant, uni-colored handbags and tote bags range from 440 francs to 690 francs.
<br />“We do have ideas for further expansion but we like the surprise effect Apple uses, where they announce it a few days before the launch, ” Daniel Freitag said. “We only like to communicate once we know it’s ready .<strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5tdWxiZXJyeWhhbmRiYWdvdXRsZXRzYWxlLmNvLnVrLw__" target="_blank">Mulberry Outlet</a></strong>. ”
<br />The Freitags’ biggest initial investment was 2, 300 francs for an industrial sewing machine. They later borrowed 20, 000 francs from their parents to fund an expansion. The brothers also obtained bank loans twice to finance their store in Zurich and to equip the new Oerlikon factory.
<br />Profits are always reinvested as the brothers try to avoid outside financing when possible.
<br />“Our company is our Rolls-Royce, ” Markus Freitag said. “We reinvest everything because we want to grow by our own means. Perhaps it’s also the designer’s ambition -- the product is the most important thing and if there’s something left, it’s nice to be able to use that to continue to develop. ”

<br /><br />Dana reported earnings of $86 million, or 40 cents a share, up 26 percent from $68 million, or 32 cents a share, in the second quarter of last year. Sales were virtually unchanged from last year at $1 .<strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL211bGJlcnJ5b3V0bGV0dWtjby5la2xhYmxvZy5jb20v" target="_blank">Stylish Mulberry Bags</a></strong>. 95 billion.
<br /><br />Meanwhile, Toledo tableware maker Libbey Inc. reported a second quarter loss of $10. 1 million, or 49 cents a share, due primarily to lower sales in its Mexico and European regions. Overall, the company said its sales decreased 2. 2 percent to $209. 2 million in the quarter, compared to $214 million for the same period in 2011.
<br /><br />While Dana had a solid second quarter, the Maumee-based company did pull back somewhat on its full-year projections based on softening of demand in some <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy50aW1idWsyLmNvbS90YjIv" target="_blank">fashion messenger bags</a></strong>.
<br /><br />“We delivered strong earnings and margin growth in the second quarter despite the impact of currency and soft commercial-vehicle volumes in Brazil, ” company President and Chief executive officer Roger Wood said in a statement. “These strong results reflect our ongoing focus on lean operations, as well as our ability to react quickly to changing market conditions. ”
<br /><br />However, the company tempered expectations for the full year, saying it expected sales to be flat compared to 2011. Dana reported sales of $7. 6 billion last year.
<br /><br />Going into 2012, executives were projecting a 5 percent growth in sales. At the end of the first quarter, they had scaled that back to a 3 percent growth <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5tdWxiZXJyeWhhbmRiYWdvdXRsZXRzYWxlLmNvLnVrL2FsZXhhLWJhZ3MtYy0yLmh0bWw_" target="_blank">Mulberry Alexa</a></strong>.
<br /><br />The company said today that it now expects 2012 sales of $7. 5 billion to $7. 6 billion and earnings per share were reduced from a range of $1. 95 to $2. 05 to a range of $1. 94 to $2. 01.
<br /><br />The company also cut its capital spending projection to $210 million to $230 million from previous projections of $225 million to $250 million.
<br /><br />The company’s stock was up nearly 12 percent in midday trading on the New york Stock exchange.
<br /><br />Dana also announced it would pay a 5 cent per share dividend on Aug. 31 to shareholders of record as of Aug. 10.
<br /><br />“Strong second-quarter results supported our position of financial strength and that, in turn, allows us to provide a greater return to our shareholders while continuing to invest in our growth and technology initiatives, ” Mr. Wood said.
<br /><br />A year ago, Libbey posted a solid second quarter profit of $15. 4 million, or 74 cents a share. But Stephanie Streeter, the company’s chief executive officer, said during the quarter its sales in the Mexico region dipped 12. 9 percent, while those in Europe fell 16 percent.
<br /><br />On the bright side, Libbey’s sales in China grew 24. 2 percent, and they rose 5. 9 percent in the U .<strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5tdWxiZXJyeWhhbmRiYWdvdXRsZXRzYWxlLmNvLnVrL2JheXN3YXRlci1iYWdzLWMtMS5odG1s" target="_blank">Mulberry Bayswater Sale</a></strong>. S. and Canada region. However, the company was hurt additionally by a special $31 million loss incurred by the redemption of debt in conjunction with a new senior note offering completed in the second quarter.
<br /><br />The company’s stock was up 4 percent at midday on the New york Stock exchange.
<br /><br />“We are encouraged by these results, driven by our efforts to increase productivity and control costs as well as the solid sales growth we achieved in select markets, ” Ms. Streeter said in a statement. “Our sales were particularly strong in glass operations in the U. S. and Canada and in China. On the other hand, sales were disappointing in Mexico and Europe.
<br /><br />“Despite this reasonably strong quarter, we have a lot of work to do to sustain performance and secure our future, ” the CEO said.
<br /><br />“The strategic plan we announced earlier this month will strengthen and build upon the effort to improve our cost structure, leverage our advantaged businesses, and strengthen our balance sheet, ” she added.
<br /><br />On July 18, the company announced it was changing its business strategy to one based on regional leadership, instead of global leadership. In the process, Libbey cut 5 percent of its global managerial, professional, and administrative work force.

That’s when they say a porter drove up in a golf cart.  Up to this point in the story, both the Reigniers and Water’s Edge managers agree.  This is where the stories split.
<br /><br />“The porter told them I’ll be right back and I’ll help you,” said General Manager Chris Barstein.  “He didn’t tell them go to the room and leave your bags.  He said I’ll be right back.”
<br /><br />The Reigniers recall the conversation differently.
<br /><br />“He pointed out where our unit was - he said you can go there.  I have one stop to make.  Just leave it here. I will pick it up.  I will deliver it to your unit,” said Lou Reignier.
<br /><br />“He insisted, he insisted that he would be there in two minutes,” said Mary Lou Reignier.  “So wouldn’t it be better for you to go get settled and I’ll bring your luggage to you.”
<br /><br />The Reigniers left their bags behind.  When the porter got to their room they say two bags were missing, including a large duffel with clothing, jewelry, medicine and make-up.  The Reigniers haven’t seen it since. 
<br /><br />The hotel maintains the porter never told them to leave their bags and is not responsible for the loss, while the Reigniers say that’s exactly what they were told. 
<br /><br />Consumer attorney Daniel Blinn says when it comes to lost luggage negligence can be a difficult thing to prove.
<br /><br />“Examples of negligence on the part of the hotel would be if they were to misplace luggage while they’re delivering it to a room if it hadn’t been checked, or if the hotel were to accidentally give a key to the wrong person,” said Blinn.
<br /><br />According to state law, hotels can be liable for anywhere from no more than $1,000 to as little as $350.  In many cases that’s just the cost of the bag alone.
<br /><br />“Consumers really do not have a lot of recourse for losses that can be substantially higher than that,” said Blinn.
<br /><br />The current law was last reviewed by the legislature in 1949, and Blinn doesn’t expect it to be reviewed anytime soon.  That’s because most people staying in Connecticut’s hotels don’t reside in the state, leaving lawmakers with little motivation to update the law.  Federal law requires airlines to reimburse flyers up to $3,300 for lost luggage.  Amtrak will reimburse up to $500 for lost luggage on their trains, more if they purchase insurance.
<br /><br />Blinn says in hotels, travelers should never let their bags out of their sight, even when luggage is being taken by a valet to your room.    He also says if you do part with your belongings always get a claim check no matter where you are traveling.  That’s your only way of showing that the hotel has taken responsibility for your bags.
<br /><br />“If you do that it’s going to be easier to track it down and I think that you’re also going to make sure that the person who gives you the check is going to be aware that they are responsible for the bag,” said Blinn.
<br /><br />Water’s Edge General Manager Chris Barstein says they always give out claim checks for bags they handle and would have assumed responsibility for the Reigniers’ bags had they done the same.  In this case, however, he says the Reigniers’ bags were simply left unattended. 
<br /><br />“You see people walking down to the beach, people walking up from the beach all day long,” said Barstein.  “You can’t leave, as you would anywhere outside, things unattended.”
<br /><br />The Reigniers maintain they did what they were told by staff, and that they’re paying for it with a hefty home owner’s insurance deductible and a bad taste in their mouth.
<br /><br />“I will not ever go down there again, I won’t,” said Mary Lou.  “And I will tell the story to everyone I come in contact with.”

<br /><br />The councilors also will be asked to repeal the $10 Barrington Beach pass fee for senior citizens.
<br /><br />And they will hold a public hearing on Planning Board-recommended amendments to the town’s zoning maps, including a new type of <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL211bGJlcnJ5b3V0bGV0dWtjby5la2xhYmxvZy5jb20v" target="_blank">Stylish Mulberry Bags</a></strong>.
<br /><br />The councilors also will approve salaries for all non-union workers, including all department heads, about one month into the new fiscal year.
<br /><br />The meeting starts at 7 pm in the Council Chamber in town Hall.
<br /><br />The plastic bag-ban proposal will be presented by its originator, Joshua Roberts, a member of the Barrington Conservation Commission, which has endorsed the proposal. See previous Patch story.
<br /><br />Roberts got some additional support for his proposed ban last week from Environment Rhode Island, an advocacy organization. The group presented a letter signed by 14 Barrington businesses and petitions shaped into reusable <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy50aW1idWsyLmNvbS90YjIv" target="_blank">fashion messenger bags</a></strong> that were signed by 340 Barrington residents to Town Council President June Speakman and Town Manager Peter DeAngelis Jr.
<br /><br />The letter said, in part: “We are writing to express our support for a ban on single-use plastic checkout bags here in Barrington…Barrington and Rhode Island can be leaders for the environment and Narragansett Bay by getting rid of plastic bags <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5tdWxiZXJyeWhhbmRiYWdvdXRsZXRzYWxlLmNvLnVrLw__" target="_blank">Mulberry Bags On Sale</a></strong>. ”
<br /><br />Roberts, a political science professor at Roger Williams University, wrote up the proposal as an academic “white paper. ”
<br /><br />“Recycling simply does not work, ” said Roberts. “Recycling is not yet a viable option for the safe, effective disposal of these items. To that end, the most effective way to limit the problem in the environment is to reduce usage by eliminating the bags from the supply chain. ”
<br /><br />Key elements of the proposed ordinance:
<br /><br />No retail store would be allowed to use the plastic bags at checkouts.
<br />Retail stores should make reusable bags available for purchase.
<br />Retail stores would be allowed to charge up to 5 cents per reusable bag.
<br />Fines for violators would put some teeth into the ordinance. A first violation by a retail store would result in a $150 fine. A second violation within a year would be $300. A third violation would be a $750 fine <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5tdWxiZXJyeWhhbmRiYWdvdXRsZXRzYWxlLmNvLnVrLw__" target="_blank">discount mulberry handbags</a></strong>.
<br /><br />Susan Tucker of Barrington has been opposed to the beach-pass fee for seniors since it was put into place by the Town Council last spring at the same time the Parks and Recreation Commission asked to boost the previous $20 beach pass fee for everyone else to $30.
<br /><br />Tucker will present a petition to the councilors with more than 50 names on it asking for a repeal of the fee.
<br /><br />The zoning map amendments would change the zoning for a package of properties in 15 areas. It also would introduce a new type of zoning: Conservation Development for the Nockum Hill area of Barrington.
<br /><br />Its goal is to protect at least 50 percent of a parcel of land as open space at no cost to a town, which in many instances is the only way to preserve land. See previous Patch story.

<br /><br />The salaries for non-union workers were tabled early this month when Town Councilor Bill DeWitt asked the town manager to present a more complete picture of all salaries and benefits paid to these employees at tonight’s meeting. See Patch story on the proposed ordinance that sets the salaries.

<br /><br />The Saints also announced that the Wednesday morning practice session will be open to the public with the gates to the field opening at 7: 50 a. m. and practice running from 8: 50 to 11: 30 a. m.
<br /><br />I got the Cajun Cannon’s thoughts on what he saw on the field.  “I thought it was kind of a mixed <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL211bGJlcnJ5b3V0bGV0dWtjby5la2xhYmxvZy5jb20v" target="_blank">Stylish Mulberry Bags</a></strong> at practice today, ” said Bobby Hebert.
<br /><br />“At times the offense looked good and at times the defense looked good.  I’d say that of all the practices thus far, today was the most sloppy, ” Hebert said.  The Saints jumped offsides a couple of times and Chris Ivory and Darren Sproles both fumbled the ball at the morning practice.
<br /><br />In one-on-one drills which featured the Saints offensive and defensive linemen going at it, Sedrick Ellis got the best of Jahri Evans on one exchange.  However, the big plays were made most consistently by #95 Martez Wilson and #94 Cam Jordan .<strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy50aW1idWsyLmNvbS90YjIv" target="_blank">fashion messenger bags</a></strong>.
<br />Both Jordan and Wilson blew by the linemen in front of them during the drill.  In team drills the Saints worked on third-and-short yardage situations.  Darren Sproles had a four yard gain, then Drew Brees completed a nice pass for a first down to TE Jimmy Graham.
<br /><br />Marquis Johnson then broke up a pass on the next play, and so far he has stood out during training camp for the Saints secondary.  “I’m just trying to make plays.  The players have really taken me in and shown me the ropes and right now, we are all just trying to make the team, ” Johnson said.
<br /><br />Drew Brees then completed a 25-yard pass to Adrian Arrington, followed by a nice 20-yard completion to WR Marques Colston.  Martez Wilson and Tyrunn Walker both did a nice job of getting pressure on the QB in the team session.
<br /><br />Later, wide receiver Joe Morgan made two great catches.  The first catch that Morgan made was just an all-out battle.  Rookie A. J .<strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5tdWxiZXJyeWhhbmRiYWdvdXRsZXRzYWxlLmNvLnVrLw__" target="_blank">Mulberry Bags Outlet</a></strong>. Davis had excellent coverage on Morgan as both leaped in the air for the football.  Davis looked to have the ball on the way down, but Morgan wrestled it away for a nice completion.
<br /><br />Then moments later Morgan hauled in a 40-yard reception, beating Elbert Mack and Isa Abdul Quddus.  “He had 90 yards receiving on two catches.  He’s really playing well right now, ” Bobby Hebert said of Joe Morgan.
<br /><br />Hebert also noted that Rookie WR Nick Toon had his best practice thus far during camp but Hebert thinks that Toon still has a ways to go to catch up with the other receivers. **15**
<br /><br />Coach Joe Vitt also said that CB Jabari Greer injured his groin at practice and that Greer would be <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5tdWxiZXJyeWhhbmRiYWdvdXRsZXRzYWxlLmNvLnVrLw__" target="_blank">discount mulberry bags</a></strong>. The Saints will have meetings the rest of the day and then get back on the field in the morning.

<br /><br />The Ventura County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday took the first step toward that goal by considering a model draft ordinance that would ban single-use plastic carryout bags from retail stores in the region.
<br /><br />While supervisors did not make a decision Tuesday to approve the ban, they did vote 4-1, with Supervisor Peter Foy dissenting, to move forward with an environmental review of the ordinance that could also be used as a model for other coastal counties and cities.
<br /><br />Supervisors also on Tuesday voted 4-1, with Foy dissenting, to endorse spending $8,000 toward a jointly funded regional environmental impact report to review the plastic bag ban.
<br /><br />The $8,000 will come from the county Watershed Protection District's Storm Water Total Maximum Daily Loads Program, which monitors the amount of trash that ends up in the coastal waters.
<br /><br />The draft ordinance prohibits plastic carryout bags at any store that sells food or pharmacies. The ban does not include produce bags or product bags supplied by a store. Customers would be charged 10 cents for each recyclable paper carryout bag.
<br /><br />Restaurants, fast-food establishments and nonfood retail stores would be exempt.
<br /><br />The ordinance was referred to the supervisors by the Beach Erosion Authority for Clean Oceans and Nourishment (BEACON), a multi-jurisdictional joint-powers agency composed of both Ventura and Santa Barbara counties, as well as the coastal cities of Goleta, Santa Barbara, Carpinteria, Ventura, Oxnard and Port Hueneme.
<br /><br />BEACON is an agency responsible for protecting beaches and the coast, and the preservation, protection and enhancement of clean ocean waters.
<br /><br />Supervisors Steve Bennett and John Zaragoza brought the plastic bag ban to the rest of the supervisors at the request of the BEACON board, whose members believe the improper disposal of non-compostable plastic bags is a major component of pollution and is a detriment to wildlife and the environment.
<br /><br />&quot;I appreciate that we're doing this with the coalition under BEACON. It's very appropriate,&quot; said Supervisor Kathy Long, who once served on the BEACON board.
<br /><br />Gerard Kapuscik, interim director of the Ventura County Watershed Protection District, said that participating in the regional environmental impact report effort will help the county meet state mandated requirements that allocate the amount of pollutants in water while still meeting water quality standards.
<br /><br />By participating in a joint environmental impact report, the county is expected to save about $65,000, the cost the county would have to pay if it pursued its own report on a plastic bag ban at a later date.
<br /><br />The joint report is expected to cost between $60,000 and $70,000.
<br /><br />Santa Barbara city and county already have approved supporting the regional report, and each contributed $8,000.
<br /><br />During the next month, BEACON will be asking the cities of Ventura, Oxnard, and Port Hueneme to also fund the joint regional report.
<br /><br />Several community-based organizations, such as the Orfalea Foundation, are also contributing toward the report.
<br /><br />BEACON staff will be overseeing the California Environment Quality Act review process.
<br /><br />&quot;The important thing here is that we're sharing the cost, and all the cities are going to be able to use this CEQA document so they don't have to reinvent the wheel and pay a total of $70,000 or $80,000 that it would cost, Zaragoza said.
<br /><br />A statewide initiative to ban single-use plastic bags failed in 2010, though the Supreme Court last year did uphold the right of cities to ban plastic bags.
<br /><br />Los Angeles County approved a similar environmental impact report and ordinance banning single-use plastic bags, and Los Angeles in May became the largest city in the nation to ban plastic bags.
<br /><br />Carpinteria also approved a ban in March, and Ojai in April became the first city in Ventura County to ban single-use plastic bags.
<br /><br />Bennett said coastal communities have a great interest in banning plastic bags because they get into the watershed and end up in the ocean and river bottoms.
<br /><br />&quot;You can go down to the Ventura River bottom now and see more plastic bags than you would ever want to see down there,&quot; Bennett said.
<br /><br />&quot;This is the first for us to be able to do something. We're not passing an ordinance today but we're trying to get this important EIR work done so that all the coastal communities can look at it and make a decision,&quot; Bennett said.
<br /><br />Foy questioned whether the ordinance could waive costs for shoppers that will have to pay extra if they must buy bags to carry out a lot of groceries.
<br /><br />Ventura Councilman Brian Brennan, who also is the director of BEACON, said the supervisors would have the power to add language to address cost issues when the ordinance comes back for approval at a later time.
