Natural crystals will produce a powdery substance but of a different shade while a glass crystals can?t produce trace of powder. For instance a red Hematite if rubbed on a ceramic would depart a dark red powdery material.<br /><br />Finally, you can also tell if the crystal is real when it produces a sparkling effect. Caused by the direct within them, real crystals can make extraordinary sparkle even when glass won't.

When this is done, the measure can be used at once.  But there can be another issue that how much water system can tolerate.  The system without drainage pipes carry some limitations.  In this case level of ground water can easily be raised by heavy rains or flooding.  But with other two systems the extra water is taken away to remote areas below the ground through proper pipes laid over there.<br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5lcGhlbnJ5LmNvbS9wYXZlcnMvYnJpY2stc3RvbmUuYXNweA__" target="_blank"><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fephenry.com%2Fpavers%2Fbrick-stone.aspx"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://ephenry.com/pavers/brick-stone.aspx</a></a><br /><br />Pro and Con to apply this Measure<br /><br />If no permeable paving is used then precipitated water can easily fill up the storm water system.  This can cause overloading foremost in direction of drinking water pouring out via pavements.  But permeable paving allows water to go down and make use of water stored underground.<br /><br />Pollutants can be stored in the soil or in other material under the pavement and decrease the risk of having pollutants washed of the surface and into sensitive environment. (Davis Langdon)<br /><br />The trees in urban atmosphere just take alot more room for rooting and it would make easier for h2o and air to obtain down deeply.<br /><br />Serious polluted parts is usually acceptable for permeable paving dependent on the model chosen.  But impermeable membrane will go best for it. Is there a sudden, heavy discharge of pollution, it can be accumulated in the area and be shield of.  in case of other two system when discharges happens the pollutants infiltrated down the ground water.<br /><br />Foto: Ramsey-Washington Metro Watershed District<br /><br />Cons<br /><br />Paving demands maintenance to keep the pores open blocked by gravel or grit. (CRD) The maintenance is usually done with industrial vacuum or jet-washing.  The drainage capacity reduces by the time. Research show that the capacity can be reduced with 10-20% after 3-6 years.  With permeable paving on concrete blocks the grit will enhance the filtering properties rather than creating any problem.<br /><br />With recycling facilities and fueling stations urban areas are more prone towards having pollutants.  For these areas permeable paving usually are not suited as pollutant can readily get to ground drinking water.<br /><br />Porous pavement might not be appropriate to have in areas with high traffic or loading docks. Some companies have however developed concrete paving specifically for areas with major site visitors, like for industrial activities.<br /><br />Permeable paving should not be applied at places where piped drainage is installed.  Water coming from other areas must be handled through another way. <br /><br />Using permeable paving in cold climate can cause some issues. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5lcGhlbnJ5LmNvbS9wZXJtZWFibGUtcGF2ZXJzLmFzcHg_" target="_blank">ephenry.com/permeable-pavers.aspx</a><br /><br />Retaining Wall Pavers<br /><br />Traditionally these walls were made from railroad ties and found stone.
