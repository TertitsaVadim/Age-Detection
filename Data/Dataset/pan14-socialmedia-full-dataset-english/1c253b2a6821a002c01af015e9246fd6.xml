<br />The New York  Jets could make a choice on whether Pro Bowl cornerback Darrelle Revis will  play in Sunday's game up against the Steelers prior to team flies to Pittsburgh  on Saturday, coach Rex Ryan said.Revis, a four-time Pro Bowl selection, a break  down concussion in a very 48-28 season-opening victory over the Buffalo <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5zbmFwYmFja3NoYXRzNHUuY29tL3NuYXBiYWNrLWhhdHMtYy04OC5odG1s" target="_blank">Snapback&amp;nbsp;Hats&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</a>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
<br /><br />Bills last weekend. Though he has since been cleared to  operate and strength train, he could be still barred from contact.If he isn't  totally, then Darrelle won't play,&amp;quot; Ryan told reporters on Thursday.  &amp;quot;It's as fundamental as that.In case a guy stood a concussion, I don't  think you would put him with a plane to make a game-time decision. I would  think by Saturday we'll certainly have an answer.&amp;quot;Revis was injured within  the fourth quarter of Sunday's game against Buffalo when he tackled tailback  C.J. Spiller and was accidentally kicked within the head by team mate Bart  Scott.The 27-year-old, that has been a-Pro in the past three seasons, will have  to be cleared with a team physician plus an independent neurological consultant  to play resistant to the Steelers on Sunday.
<br /><br />&amp;quot;It isn't  really my call,&amp;quot; Revis said. &amp;quot;Whatever they say goes. I'd personally  play the role of in existence with a broken leg. They already know that. It's a  competitive spirit inside me that just wants to go forth there and play.&amp;quot;Legend  has it that Minnesota Vikings rookie kicker Blair Walsh designed a 68-yard  field goal in practice ahead of the season started.To hear Adrian Peterson tell  the tale now, it had been longer.I have come across he make a 70-yard basket  during training camp,&amp;quot; Peterson said.After Walsh bailed the Vikings out so  dramatically in the NFL debut last weekend against Jacksonville, Peterson might  be forgiven for stretching the reality a bit. In case the former Georgia  Bulldog keeps banging through 55-yarders by the end of regulation to tie games  and drilling 38-yarders in overtime to win them, the fable of their big kick  will likely only grow over time.Playing a situation that may be often regarded  with tolerance, if not disdain, by the other countries in the team, Walsh has DC&amp;nbsp;Hats&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
<br /><br />already earned himself a loyal fan in Peterson. The  face of the franchise said she has been bragging to family about Walsh's big  leg. When the 55-yarder had at the conclusion of regulation on Sunday, Peterson  immediately looked on an uncle soaking in the stands for the Metrodome.I'll  find him when I get downstairs and say, 'I told you about that guy,'&amp;quot;  Peterson said after the game. &amp;quot;He's good; he's an excellent  leg.&amp;quot;Walsh will be the only player to win his NFL debut by sending the  game into overtime at the end of regulation and kicking an area goal in  overtime, and is particularly certainly one of just three — along with Matt  Bahr in 1979 and Todd Peterson in 1994 — to win his first NFL game with the  overtime basket.So in his first professional week of training, Walsh has hit  kicks that tied and won an activity, been named NFC special teams player of the  week, had Peterson brag about him and also had Vikings owner Zygi Wilf provide  him with the tie off his neck.Like literally off his neck and threw it at  me,&amp;quot; Walsh said. &amp;quot;I didn't understand what can be expected. I was  like, 'Alright.'&amp;quot;Wilf has on occasion given his tie on game day to your  player he felt contributed largely towards victory. But to give it with a  rookie, along with a kicker too, wasn't any small feat.
