<br />the flow of living come my way again
<br />so i can drink life be alive
<br />learn to accept my sin 
<br /><br />but instead i am dead
<br />and i drink my own blood 
<br />dying wilting fading far away 
<br />lacking so much love 
<br /><br />no one knows and no one would want to 
<br />i'm not even sure if i even do 
<br />all i know is that something's not right 
<br />and i'm not even sure that is true 
<br /><br />i thought that i was once okay
<br />someone special 
<br />but i was wrong 
<br />your eyes say i am no one 
<br /><br />your voice sounds like 
<br />nails on a chalkboard
<br />yet they are so beautiful as a
<br />symphony of laughter
<br /><br />when you tell me i am no one 
<br />ugly unintelligent unloved worthless
<br />undererving selfish
<br />morally a bad person
<br /><br />it makes me feel so alive 
<br />but at the same time 
<br />DEAD
<br />because when i hurt at least i feel
<br />i have control i know im real
<br /><br />but deep inside 
<br />locked within my heart 
<br />i hold the secret that maybe
<br />its okay that everything's not
<br />falling apart
<br /><br />if maybe i refuse to listen 
<br />i could love myself more
<br />i could believe that it's true 
<br />that i do deserve love repect
<br />stability 
<br />but maybe every bad thing 
<br />was all because of me ..........

<br />I'm losing control
<br />the past keeps taking me
<br />back to that world
<br /><br />You were my first
<br />My fascination
<br />the end of my world
<br />in disguise of my best friend
<br /><br />Ocean blue eye's
<br />dirty blond hair
<br />you promised to love me
<br />to always care
<br /><br />I looked up at your face
<br />and saw your sweet smile
<br />''it'll be all right
<br />lets lay down for awhile''
<br /><br />''this won't hurt a bit
<br />I swear that you'll love it
<br />make it Worth my while
<br />and I'll hole you for a while''
<br /><br />''Thats what you want isn't it
<br />to be held?
<br />well go through this pain then
<br />it's only rape
<br />you'll get used to it''
<br /><br />''No god please help me
<br />it's not supposed to be this way
<br />it's not supposed to hurt this much
<br />oh please make him stop''
<br /><br />''whats the matter baby
<br />don't you like what I have to give
<br />if you don't like it
<br />tough deal with it....''
<br /><br />Never had I felt such pain
<br />been so used
<br />felt such hatred 
<br />as I did that day
<br /><br />thirteen years old
<br />grew up that day
<br />never look back
<br />you won't survive that way...
<br /><br />Don't feel sympathy. just watch who you trust. please just be careful who you decide to be with. Make sure you can trust them with your life before you go any farther. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cry.gif" alt=":)" />

<br />if she was sad i couldn't tell
<br />i missed the point 
<br />i missed the signs
<br />so if she's gone the fault is mine
<br /><br />i know 
<br />i know a whole lotta things 
<br />even though i could list them 1 by 1 
<br />she will still be hone
<br /><br />her eyes were blue 
<br />her hair was long 
<br />in 64 she was born
<br />in baton rouge
<br />her favorite song was in my life
<br />i memorized her every move 
<br />i knew her books her clothes
<br />but i paid no attention 2 
<br />wat matter'd most
<br /><br />i never asked she never said
<br />when she cried i turned my head 
<br />she dre3amed her dreams behind close doors
<br />and that made them easy 2 ignore
<br /><br />i know i know 
<br />i missed the forest for the tree's
<br />all i have 2 show when she walked out that door
<br />are cold facts an nothing more
<br />her father's tall her mothers gone 
<br />she moved out west when she was 2 
<br />the way she laughed the way she loved
<br />on my god what did i do

<br />and in her heart she knew it was wrong 
<br />but 2much wine and she left his bed at dawn 
<br /><br />now each day is one day that's left in her life
<br />she won't know love

<br />an dreams 
<br />and all her friends say wat a pitty 
<br />wat a loss and in the end

<br />then at least u would know 
<br />how i feel pain yet never show 
<br /><br />but the i might be deemed 
<br />someone else then who i am 
<br />but it happends to me either way
<br />because no one gives a damn 
<br /><br />who cares anyway
<br />no one ever does
<br />i do not know wat's wrong with me 
<br />that i don't deserve ur love
<br /><br />without anyone else to help
<br />i want to cry and pout to scream

<br />Been far away for far too long
<br />I keep dreaming you'll be with me
<br />and you'll never go
<br />Stop breathing if
<br />I don't see you anymore
<br />On my knees, I'll ask
<br />Last chance for one last dance
<br />'Cause with you, I'd withstand
<br />All of hell to hold your hand
<br />I'd give it all
<br />I'd give for us
<br />Give anything but I won't give up
<br />'Cause you know,
<br />Been far away for far too long
<br />So far away
<br />I wanted you to stay
<br />'Cause I needed
<br />I need to hear you say
<br />That I love you
<br />I have loved you all along
<br />And I forgive you
<br />For being away for far too long
<br />So keep breathing
<br />'Cause I'm not leaving you anymore
<br />Believe it
<br />Hold on to me and, never let me go
<br />Keep breathing
<br />'Cause I'm not leaving you anymore
<br />Believe it
<br />Hold on to me and, never let me go
<br />Keep breathing
<br />Hold on to me and, never let me go
<br />Keep breathing
<br />Hold on to me and, never let me go
