<br /><br />i love the way the street lamps glow against the night sky
<br />i love hearing nothing but my own footsteps 
<br />i love the tricks that your mind plays on you as you walk the dark streets.
<br />i love the feeling of having the world to myself
<br />i love the ocean at night, standing on the beach staring out into the black void in front of me, its like standing on the edge of the world
<br />i love being able to get away with anything at night
<br />i love the cool night air on my face
<br />i love the stars shimmering above me
<br />i love the moon staring down at me
<br /><br />i love the night <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" />

<br />anyway back to it, i agreed and got suited up in my tunnel rat suit <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/tongue.gif" alt=":)" /> i used a t-shirt for a balaclava to stop me from breathing in the dust, i had swimming goggles to keep the bits of flying limestone out of my eyes and long sleeve clothes to stop the sharp rocks from tearing my skin to pieces, which ended up happening anyway.
<br /><br />so yeah i got suited up and crawled into this tiny space, i was to be working in a space so small, that in order turn over from my stomache to my back i had to dig a ditch so my hips would fit sideways. i wriggled my way awkwardly into the small space that was to be  the place that i would work in about 45min spaces of time for the next three days.
<br /><br />when i drilled into the wall, the air filled so thickly with dust that i couldnt see my hand infront of my face let alone what i was doing with the drill. 
<br /><br />so yeah basicly my working conditions were dark, cramped, hot, dusty and full of sharp rocks. 
<br /><br />but for some reason.... i absolutely adored it <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />for a few reasons, because im absolutely non-claustrophobic, because when im not drilling, its quiet and isolated, a great place to lay and think, theres a sense of danger, because i could very easily get stuck, so theres a thrill in it and well, its really cool knowing that im the first person to see that room in at least 50-60 years, because before the time that i break through it was sealed by a thick limestone wall....
<br /><br />so yeah,  a new development in my possible choice for a future career path <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/tongue.gif" alt=":)" />

<br /><br />-We don't care if you're friends with other guys.
<br /><br />-But when you're sitting next to us, and some random guy walks into the room and you jump up and tackle him, without even introducing us, yeah, it pisses us off.
<br /><br />-It doesn't help if you sit there and talk to him for ten minutes without even acknowledging the fact that we're still there.
<br /><br />-We don't care if a guy calls you, but at 2 in the morning we do get a little concerned.
<br /><br />-Nothing is that important at 2 a.m. that it can't wait
<br />Till the morning.
<br /><br />-Also, when we tell you you're pretty/ beautiful/ gorgeous/
<br />cute/stunning, we freaking mean it.
<br /><br />-Don't tell us we're wrong.
<br /><br />We'll stop trying to convince you.
<br /><br />-The sexiest thing about a girl is confidence.
<br />Yeah, you can quote me.
<br /><br />-Don't be mad when we hold the door open. Take Advantage of the mood I'm in.
<br /><br />-Let us pay for you!
<br /><br />Don’t &quot;feel bad&quot;
<br /><br />We enjoy doing it.
<br /><br />It's expected.
<br /><br />Smile and
<br /><br />Say &quot;thank you.&quot;
<br /><br />-Kiss us when no one's watching.
<br /><br />-If you kiss us when you know somebody's looking, we'll be more impressed.
<br /><br />-You don't have to get dressed up for us.
<br /><br />-If we're going out with you in the first place, you don't have to feel the need to wear the shortest skirt you have or put on every kind of makeup you own.
<br /><br />-We like you for who you are and not what you are.
<br /><br />Honestly, I think a girl looks more beautiful when she's just in her pj's. Or my t-shirt and boxers, not all dolled up
<br /><br />-Don't take everything we say seriously.
<br /><br />Sarcasm is a beautiful thing. See the beauty in it.
<br /><br />-Don't get angry easily.
<br /><br />-Stop using magazines/media as your bible.
<br /><br />-Don't talk about how hot Morris Chesnutt, Brad Pitt, or Pete Wentz is in front of us.
<br /><br />It's boring, and we don't care. You have girlfriends for that.
<br /><br />-Whatever happened to the word &quot;handsome&quot;/&quot;beautiful?&quot;
<br /><br />I'd be utterly stunned by a girl who greeted me with &quot;Hey handsome!&quot; instead of &quot;Hey baby/ stud/ cutie/ sexy&quot; or whatever else you can think of.
<br /><br />On the other hand I’m not saying I wouldn’t like it either ; )
<br /><br />-Girls, I cannot stress this enough: if you aren't being treated right by a guy, don’t wait for him to change. Ditch his sorry, disgrace to the male population ass and find someone who will treat you with utter respect
<br /><br />Someone who will honor your morals.
<br /><br />Someone who will make you smile when you're at your lowest.
<br /><br />&quot;Someone who will care for you even when you make mistakes.&quot;
<br /><br />Someone who will love you, no matter how bad you make them feel.
<br /><br />Someone who will stop what they’re doing just to look you in the eyes....and say &quot;I love you”...and actually mean it.
<br /><br />Give the nice guys a chance
<br /><br />Guys repost this if you agree
<br /><br />Girls repost this if you think it's cute
<br /><br />Every Guy who isn't a jerk will agree with this, so we hope that all the girls that read this will repost this
<br /><br />*Holding Hands
<br />Girls: If you want to hold his hand, gently bump into it a couple of times.
<br />Guys: Grab it if it happens more than once.
<br /><br />*Cuddling
<br />Girls: When you want to cuddle with him, tell him you're cold
<br />Guys: Automatically move closer to her.
<br /><br />*Movies
<br />Girls: During a movie, if he puts his arm around you, tilt your head on his shoulder
<br />Guys: Lift her chin up and kiss her.
<br /><br />*Loving each other
<br /><br />Guys: When she tells you she loves you, look deep into her eyes, give her a peck on the lips, and tell her you love her too... And mean it.
<br /><br />*Laying below the stars
<br /><br />Girls: When you're both laying under the stars, put your head on his chest and close your eyes as you listen to his steady heart beat
<br />Guys: Whisper in her ear and link your hands with hers.

<br />home from the movies. The boy sensed
<br />there was something wrong because of
<br />the painful silence they shared
<br />between them that night. The girl then
<br />asked the boy to pull over because she
<br />wanted to talk. She told him that her
<br />feelings had changed &amp; that it was
<br />time to move on. A silent tear slid
<br />down his cheek as he slowly reached
<br />into his pocket &amp; passed her a folded
<br />note. At that moment, a drunk driver
<br />was speeding down that very same
<br />street. He swerved right into the
<br />drivers seat, killing the boy.
<br />Miraculously, the girl survived.
<br />Remembering the note, she pulled it
<br />out &amp; read it.
<br />&quot;Without your love, I would die.&quot;
<br /><br />1st: If u post this on a bulletin in 5
<br />minutes someone special will message
<br />or call you.
<br /><br />2nd: REPOST IF YOU CARE ABOUT SOMEONE
<br />SO MUCH THAT YOU CANT LIVE WITHOUT
<br />THEM!!! &quot;(EVEN YOUR BEST FRIENDS!)&quot;
<br /><br />3rd: REPOST AS &quot; 6 word love letter&quot;
