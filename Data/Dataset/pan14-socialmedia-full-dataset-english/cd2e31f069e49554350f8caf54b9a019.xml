Should the PlayStation 3D TV SET be as successful when seems likely, it could wide open the doorway to more new and innovative game playing experiences. <br /><br />It all tones good, doesn't it? But you'll find drawbacks. The major one is the fact that dual player mode will most definately work with 3D games that are specially created to benefit from it. Clearly that mean that all existing games might be incompatible from this mind-set, though of course you'll be prepared to play them as a particular player in 3D.
