Any number above 7 is not good and limits room for RBI to cut rates. Food prices would continue to rise and if Diesel prices go up by Rs. 5 we would see further pressure on prices in the coming months. Coupled with this would be the poor monsoon, effect of which would get reflected in the months of Oct and Nov. RBI may chose to combat inflation over growth for the time being.&quot;

RBI has shown its concern on the growth but inflation remains its major concern. While the inflation is falling the pace of its fall is quite slow. The non-inflation numbers still are showing no signs of a fall and the food inflation is falling due to the seasonal effect. The base effect will also make the numbers look better. But all this is not reflective of the falling inflation. Coupled with this is the fiscal deficit of the government. My view is that in the Jan RBI would not reduce the rates but may signal an easing by cutting the CRR. Once we have the budget in February RBI would have a clear picture on the fiscal front as also on the inflation front and going forward in RBI may look at easing of the monetary policy.</strong>

RBI had reduced the rupee liquidity by approximately  40,000 cr in the 3d qtr of the current fiscal when it has sold dollars to contain the fall of rupee. What it has done by reducing the CRR is to get the liquidity back to the levels of Sep 2011. The average borrowing of banks each day has been to the tune of 1.25 lac cr, which is double of what it should ideally be. Inflation still remains a major concern and inflation will not get contained because it is happening due to structural and international issues. Oil prices have a risk of spiralling upwards and the probability of the government containing its deficit is also very low.
<br /><br />If the GDP of 3d qtr remain in the 7 % range I have my doubt if RBI would cut rates in April. The banks are still risk averse and would remain so till the business environment is good. The credit growth to my mind will continue to remain low for the first half of the current calendar year.

I would peg this year’s growth below 6.5% and going forward too I do not expect it to be much higher. The world scenario does not look very promising in the next 2 years. The fiscal deficit too cannot be controlled anytime soon. Fiscal deficits, inflation, growth are things that take a long time to stabilize and settle and cannot happen in a span of 1-2 years. To my mind the oil prices would continue to remain high in the coming years and the BOP situation of India will worsen, resulting in pressure on rupee. The inflation too would continue to remain high in rel terms. 
<br /><br />No monetary policy or fiscal policy can substantially help  at this point in time, what is required is a government policy that helps competition, policy that promotes agriculture, policy that promotes lending in the right sectors, policy that promotes equitable distribution of credit to all, policy that thus not let credit being given to a selected few and not getting concentrated , policy that promotes innovation and efficiency. Banks have to think intelligently while lending, they have to take risk.”

Food inflation is here to stay in the coming months and with the rupee depreciating I feel that non-food articles inflation will continue to see an upward move. Based on the IIP numbers I feel that demand is falling but at a slow rate, thus demand pull may not contribute to the overall inflation but supply side inflation will continue to remain and would keep pressure on the overall inflation. Personally I feel that RBI should not cut the interest rates in the meeting on April 17, 2012. The macro economic factors still do not favour a rate cut. Saving rate is dropping, the liquidity in the system still remains tight -  thus rate cut would not help and rupee is deprecating and will continue to do so.”

By cutting the rate by 50 basis points RBI has thrown the ball of growth into the court of the government. 
<br /><br />This rate cut will lead only to demand that has for the first time started moderating and thus was helping contain inflation. Weak rupee, oil price increase, increased imports all will lead to higher inflation. While the RBI feels that inflation will be range bound, to my mind it is dependent on a number of external factors that are beyond our control. The way Indian trade deficit is moving I see rupee moving to the range of 54 to a dollar which in turn means inflation. Govet borrowing is not expected to fall, which in turn means inflation. The only way inflation can be contained is if the world economies don’t pick up and commodity prices remain low, which no one would want. Thus to my mind inflation is here to stay with substantial upside risk.
<br /><br />The GDP projection of 6.9% is too optimistic and to my mind it should not be over 6.5% for the entire 11-12. For the next year the way global economy is moving the GDP numbers may not be too impressive. Even if they are they need to co-related to what has constituted to their increase. Thus, whatever are the projections for the next year only reflect a status quo in terms of growth for the economy.
<br /><br />Going forward I would not expect RBI to reduce further anytime soon.”</strong>

I do not expect the 4th qtr GDP number of the last fiscal to be more than 5.5% and going forward too, the  probability of its going up sharply is low. US is stable and trying to settle, Europe is still struggling and it would be couple of years before Europe gets into a stable mode, growth will come post that. The way inflation in India is moving and the way RBI has cut interest rates the probability of savings going up is not there. Since banks offer a -ve interest rate gold imports will continue to rise putting pressure on the rupee and thus further inflation. I do not see oil prices coming down anytime soon thus worsening the deficit  situation. In case the monsoon plays a spoil sport this year we are in for very bad times.
<br /><br />The government faces perhaps one of the widest budget deficit among the emerging economies and borrowing needs for 12-13 are huge. The gap last year was about 6% and going forward there is no reason to believe that the deficit will fall. In case it falls due to disinvestment or auction of natural resources like the spectrum liquidity will be pulled out of the system which again would mean further inputs from RBI and thus inflation.
<br /><br />At the current stage of the Indian economy monetary policy or fiscal policy will be of no help, we need to improve efficiency, cut consumption and ask banks to lend to businesses as easily as they lend to buy cars.&quot;</strong>

The data released today is no surprise. Contraction is happening and will continue to happen till we set right the basics of agriculture and efficiency.  Manufacturing is done by 4.4% which not only reflects poor off take but also poor sentiment that is expected in the coming months. The capital good is down sharply reflecting a long term negative sentiment of the industry. If we look at the capital goods sector on a sequential basis and compare it last year the picture is much more bleak. On the consumption side too demand seems to have dried up. Thus from both the perspective i.e of the manufacturer and the consumer the numbers do not give any positive signals. April will see some upward numbers but the basic sentiment will continue to remain weak. RBI should not cut the rates in the next meeting as IIP alone is not enough to make them cut rates.”

Going forward the inflation will continue to rise, we are still to see a hike in the fuel prices, this will further add to inflation. The inflation would go higher because of higher vegetable and milk prices. The inflation numbers released today will result in a pause from the side of the RBI. The situation is very tricky; we have low growth and high inflation. To my mind the only solution is higher productivity and financing to sectors that result in output growth and not merely consumption growth.”

I think the issue that we must realize is not high borrowing costs but high level of in-efficiency in the system. The issue is not high interest rates but tighter liquidity. Even if the RBI reduces the rate by 25 basis points, it will have no substantial impact on growth. Demand is falling across the globe and in the coming years we would see that countries will focus a lot on domestic production to ensure employment. It would be difficult for India to bounce back on the recovery path till structural changes are made and structural changes take time to show results. Indian trade deficit is at a record high and inflation is not falling
<br /><br />Fall in the mining number is a long term negative for the economy and a .1 % growth in manufacturing is no growth number. India is in a situation of slow growth and high inflation and coupled with this is the poor rainfall that is expected this year. While everyone is banking upon the consumption of the Indian economy I view it very differently, India needs to reduce consumption and spend on production and productivity.
<br /><br />I expect a major employment crisis that India will face in the coming quarters.”

While the slowdown has added pressure on the Reserve Bank of India to reduce interest rates I feel interest rates are not enough to propel the economy. It is a complex situation for the central bank. Weak rupee and continuing inflation limit its headroom for RBI. At most the RBI will lower the rate by a quarter of a percentage point. India’s fiscal deficit and food prices are among risks to inflation and falling rupee adds to the woes of the RBI. India also faces a trade deficit that swelled to a record $184.9 billion in the fiscal year ended March. India’s pace of price increases remains the fastest in the largest emerging economies.”

I was expecting the CRR to be cut by 50 basis points looking at the liquidity situation. The decision has been contrary to what Brazil and China has done. To my mind growth will not happen merely by monetary policy it has to happen from the policy front and that has to come from the government.  To my mind interest rates would have a very low bearing on growth at the current stage of the Indian economy.
<br />To my mind the stance that RBI has taken will not result in reducing inflation but it will have an indirect effect of reducing consumption of goods, mark me, not consumption of  food. This is very important for India as we cannot afford to waste money on consumption.”
