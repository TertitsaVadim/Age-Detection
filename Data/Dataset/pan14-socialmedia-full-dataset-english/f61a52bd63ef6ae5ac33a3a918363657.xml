<br />don,t know about you people out there but that can,t be allowed to happen.
<br />its time the government and Royalty for that matter to sort this out. its time to bring our boys home and let those people kill themselves and not our boys.
<br />place our soldiers at the ports and airports , close all our borders and kick out all asylum seekers and forigen scroungers oops sorry forigen workers and and allow no more forignners to abuse our national health system and get no more free housing , free money and a free life here. bring back our country to the people it truely belongs to the British. may be then this country can get back to the once great country it once was.

<br /><br />The man's tie was stained; his face was plastered with red lipstick, and a half empty bottle of gin was sticking out of his torn coat pocket.
<br /><br />He opened his newspaper and began reading. After a few minutes the man turned to the priest and asked, 'say Father, what causes Arthritis?'
<br /><br />The priest wanting to teach this man a little lesson replies, 'my son, it's caused by loose living, being with cheap, wicked women, too much alcohol, contempt for your fellow man, sleeping around with prostitutes &amp; lack of a bath'.
<br /><br />The drunk muttered in response, 'Well, I'll be damned,' then returned to his paper.
<br /><br />The priest, thinking about what he had said, nudged the man and apologized 'I'm very sorry. I didn't mean to come on so strong. How long have you had arthritis?'
<br /><br />The drunk answered, 'I don't have it, Father. I was just reading here that the Pope does.'

<br />T. B. Bechtel, a City Councilor from Newcastle , Australia , was asked on a local live radio talk show, just what he thought about the allegations of torture of suspected terrorists. His reply prompted his ejection from the studio, but to thunderous applause from the audience.
<br /><br />HIS STATEMENT: 
<br /><br />&quot;If hooking up one raghead terrorist prisoner's testicles to a car battery to get the truth out of the lying little camelshagger will save just one Australian life, then I have only three things to say: 'Red is positive, black is negative, and make sure his nuts are wet'

<br />Now last year sevral parts of the country had severe floods and people made homeless and what did they get virtually nothing and some of them are still strugling to this day.
<br />So i guess theres something drastically wrong here it should be a case of sod them let other countrys give them the money and let that 20 million be put to a greater and more worthwhile cause and lets get this country and our soldiers sorted first and let others worry about the outback countries after all they do sod all for us ! ! ! ! <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/ranting2.gif" alt=":)" />
