<br />Have you ever watched kids on a Marry-Go-Round?
<br />Or listen to the rain slapping on the ground?
<br />Ever follow a butterfly's erratic flight?
<br />Or gazed at the sun into the fading night?
<br />You better slow down.
<br />Don't dance so fast.
<br />Time is short.
<br />The music won't last.
<br />Do you run through each day on the fly?
<br />When you ask how are you?
<br />Do you hear a reply?
<br />When the day is done...do you lie in your bed with the nexr hundred chores running through your head?
<br />You'd better show down.
<br />Dont dance so fast.
<br />Time is short.
<br />The music won't last.
<br />Ever told your child, We'll do it tomorrow?
<br />And in your haste, not see his sorrow?
<br />Ever lost touch,
<br />Let a good frienship die?
<br />Cause you never had time To call and sa &quot;HI&quot;
<br />You'd better slow down.
<br />Don't dance so fast.
<br />Time is short.
<br />The music won't last.
<br />When you run so fast to get somewhere
<br />You miss half the fun of getting there?
<br />When you worry and hurry through the day,
<br />It is like and unopened gift....Thrown away.
<br />Life is not a race.
<br />Do take it slower.
<br />Hear the music, 
<br />Before the song is over.

<br />Put it in a pet carrier and asked the flight attendant for some chicken feed. 
<br />Place a speaker inside the bird, and from another room, amaze your guests with this talking fowl! 
<br />Throw the turkey out the window yelling, &quot;You're FREE! Fly! FLY!&quot; 
<br />From a concealed location, toss in front of a passing car. When they stop, run out screaming that they hit your dog!
<br />Recite the tragic and abusive conditions known to exist at turkey farms. 
<br />Mid-meal turn to mom and say, See mom, I told you they wouldn't notice, you were worried for nothing. 
<br />Announce that you've got a new fear of choking. 
<br />When you arrive, promise that your date won't be more than an hour late, he/she just has to wait for the warden to get together all the necessary release forms, and then they are free to go. 
<br />Twitch a lot and nervously tell the person next to you, &quot;THE SAFETY IS ON while you hold your pocket.&quot;

<br /><br />-- When it appears that you have killed the monster, never check to see if it's really dead. 
<br /><br />-- If you find that your house is built upon or near a cemetery, was once a church that was used for black masses, had previous inhabitants who went mad or committed suicide or died in some horrible fashion, or had inhabitants who performed satanic practices in your house move away immediately. 
<br /><br />-- Never read a book of demon summoning aloud, even as a joke. 
<br /><br />-- Do not search the basement, especially if the power has just gone out. 
<br /><br />-- If your children speak to you in Latin or any other language which they should not know, or if they speak to you using a voice which is other than their own, shoot them immediately. It will save you a lot of grief in the long run. NOTE: It will probably take several rounds to kill them, so be prepared. 
<br /><br />-- When you have the benefit of numbers, never pair off and go it alone. 
<br /><br />-- As a general rule, don't solve puzzles that open portals to Hell. 
<br /><br />-- Never stand in, on, above, below, beside, or anywhere near a grave, tomb, crypt, mausoleum, or other house of the dead. 
<br /><br />-- If you're searching for something which caused a noise and find out that it's just the cat, leave the room immediately if you value your life. 
<br /><br />-- If appliances start operating by themselves, move out. 
<br /><br />-- Do not take --anything-- from the dead. 
<br /><br />-- If you find a town which looks deserted, it's probably for a reason. Take the hint and stay away. 
<br /><br />-- Don't fool with recombinant DNA technology unless you're sure you know what you are doing. 
<br /><br />-- If you're running from the monster, expect to trip or fall down at least twice, more if you are of the female persuasion. Also note that, despite the fact that you are running and the monster is merely rambling along, it's still moving fast enough to catch up with you. 
<br /><br />-- If your companions suddenly begin to exhibit uncharacteristic behavior such as hissing, fascination for blood, glowing eyes, increasing hairiness, and so on, get away from them as fast as possible. 
<br /><br />-- Stay away from certain geographical locations, some of which are listed here: Amityville, Elm Street, Transylvania, the Bermuda Triangle, or any small town in Maine. 
<br /><br />-- If your car runs out of gas at night, do not go to the nearby deserted-looking house to phone for help. 
<br /><br />-- Beware of strangers bearing tools such as chainsaws, staple guns, hedge trimmers, electric carving knives, combines, lawnmowers, butane torches, soldering irons, band saws, or any device made from deceased companions. 
<br /><br />-- Don't make fun of or play with dead things. 
<br /><br />-- If you see a town that looks deserted except for children, do not try to 'help' them - they will eat you. 
<br /><br />-- If you walk into the local abandoned-looking church to seek help or shelter, and you notice that the crucifix is mounted upside down, turn around and go back outside as quietly as possible. 
<br /><br />-- Never have sex in the bunkbeds of recently renovated summer camps. 
<br /><br />-- Whenever you land on a distant planet and find some objects that look like eggs, leave them alone. 
<br /><br />-- Do not allow crewmates back aboard the craft if and after you have found a hideous parasite attached to his/her body. 
<br /><br />-- Be forewarned that a gun is only good for ALMOST killing the monster, never for COMPLETELY killing it. Be sure to have an extra weapon, preferably one with a &quot;flair&quot; (a knife, a harpoon, a heavy box, razor confetti, pop tarts.) 
<br /><br />-- Don't open the closed door, especially if you hear scratching, heavy breathing, or the voice of a dear relative whom you THOUGHT was dead. 
<br /><br />-- Never bathe, especially when in the house alone. 
<br /><br />-- If you are a female, never show your breasts. Easy women die fast. 
<br /><br />-- Never camp or build homes on Indian burial grounds. 
<br /><br />-- If the phone lines are dead, and you hear footsteps upstairs, and you say &quot;Tom. Tom is that you?&quot; and Tom does not answer, run away. 
<br /><br />-- If you have to run away, taking a bus is your best bet. If you take a car the monster will be in it.

<br /><br />the best of friends.
<br /><br />From elementary to high school
<br /><br />from
<br /><br />beginning to end.
<br /><br />Through all those years
<br /><br />their friendship grew.
<br /><br />They both felt the same,
<br /><br />but neither knew.
<br /><br />Each waking moment
<br /><br />since the
<br /><br />day they met.
<br /><br />They both loved each other
<br /><br />sunrise to sunset.
<br /><br />He was all she had
<br /><br />in her terrible life.
<br /><br />He was the one
<br /><br />who kept her from her knife.
<br /><br />She was his angel,
<br /><br />she made him smile.
<br /><br />Though life threw him curves,
<br /><br />she made it all worth while.
<br /><br />Then one day
<br /><br />things went terribly wrong.
<br /><br />The next few weeks
<br /><br />were like a very sad
<br /><br />song.
<br /><br />He made her jealous
<br /><br />on purpose he tried.
<br /><br />When the girl asked, &quot;Do you love her?&quot;
<br /><br />on purpose he lied.
<br /><br />He played with jealousy
<br /><br />like it was a game.
<br /><br />Little did he know
<br /><br />Things would never be the same.
<br /><br />His plan was working
<br /><br />but he had no clue.
<br /><br />How wrong things would go,
<br /><br />the damage he would do.
<br /><br />One night she broke down,
<br /><br />feeling very
<br /><br />alone.
<br /><br />Just her and the blade,
<br /><br />no one else home.
<br /><br />She dialed his number,
<br /><br />he answered, &quot;Hello&quot;
<br /><br />She told him she loved him
<br /><br />and hung up the phone.
<br /><br />He raced to her
<br /><br />house
<br /><br />just a minute too late.
<br /><br />Found her lying in blood,
<br /><br />her heart
<br /><br />had no rate.
<br /><br />Beside her was a note,
<br /><br />in it her confession.
<br /><br />Her love for this boy,
<br /><br />her only obsession.
<br /><br />As he read the note,
<br /><br />he knelt down and cried.
<br /><br />Grabbed her knife,
<br /><br />that night they both died.
<br /><br />She was found in his arms,
<br /><br />both of them dead.
<br /><br />Under her
<br /><br />note
<br /><br />his handwriting said:
<br /><br />&quot;I loved her
<br /><br />so, she never knew.
<br /><br />All this time
<br /><br />I loved her
<br /><br />too.&quot;
<br /><br />if u dont repost this in 20 minutes.. u will lose
<br /><br />the
<br /><br />love of
<br /><br />ur life and never get them back
<br /><br />Title it When a Boy makes a girl jealous
