<br />went though the standard training, completed the practice jumps from 
<br />higher and higher structures, and finally went to take his first jump 
<br />from an airplane. The next day, he called home to his father to 
<br />tell him the news. &quot;So, did you jump?&quot; the father asked.
<br />&quot;Well, let me tell you what happened. We got up in the plane, and 
<br />the sergeant opened up the door and asked for volunteers. About a 
<br />dozen men got up and just walked out of the plane!&quot;
<br />&quot;Is that when you jumped?&quot; asked the father.
<br />&quot;Um, not yet. Then the sergeant started to grab the other men one at a
<br />time and throw them out the door.&quot;
<br />&quot;Did you jump then?&quot; asked the father.
<br />&quot;I'm getting to that. Every one else had jumped, and I was the 
<br />last man left on the plane. I told the sergeant that I was too scared 
<br />to jump. He told me to get off the plane or he'd kick my ass.&quot;
<br />&quot;So, did you jump?&quot;
<br />&quot;Not then. He tried to push me out of the plane, but I grabbed 
<br />onto the door and refused to go. Finally he called over to the Jump 
<br />Master. The Jump Master is this great big guy, about six-foot five, 
<br />and 250 pounds. He said to me, &quot;Boy, are you gonna jump or not?''
<br />I said, &quot;No, sir. I'm too scared. So the Jump Master pulled down 
<br />his zipper and took his penis out. I swear, it was about ten inches 
<br />long and as big around as a baseball bat! He said, 'Boy, either you 
<br />jump out that door, or I'm sticking this little baby up your ass.'&quot;
<br />&quot;So, did you jump?&quot; asked the father.
<br />&quot;Well, a little, at first.&quot;

<br /><br />The barman looks at him and says, 'But you're a duck'.
<br /><br />'I see your eyes are working', replies the duck.
<br /><br />'And you talk!' exclaims the barman.
<br /><br />'I see your ears are working', says the duck, 'Now can I have my beer
<br />and my sandwich please?'
<br /><br />'Certainly', says the barman, 'Sorry about that, it's just we don't get
<br />many ducks in this pub. What are you doing round this way?'
<br /><br />'I'm working on the building site across the road', explains the duck.
<br />Then the duck drinks his beer, eats his sandwich and leaves.
<br /><br />This continues for 2 weeks. Then one day the circus comes to town. The
<br />Ringmaster of the circus comes into the pub and the barman says to him,
<br />'You're with the circus aren't you?, I know this duck that would be just
<br />brilliant in your circus, he talks, drinks beer and everything!'.
<br /><br />'Sounds marvellous', says the ringmaster, 'Get him to give me a call'.
<br /><br />So the next day when the duck comes into the pub the barman says, 'Hey
<br />Mr Duck, I reckon I can line you up with a top job, paying really good
<br />money!'
<br /><br />'Yeah?', says the duck, 'Sounds great, where is it?'
<br /><br />'At the circus', says the barman.
<br /><br />'The circus?' the duck enquires.
<br /><br />'That's right', replies the barman.
<br /><br />'The circus?' the duck asks again.
<br /><br />'Yes' says the barman.
<br /><br />'That place with the big tent?'
<br /><br />'Yeah' the barman replies.
<br /><br />'With all the animals?'
<br /><br />'Of Course' the barman replies.'With the big canvas roof with the hole
<br />in the middle' ?
<br /><br />'That's right!' says the barman.
<br /><br />The duck looks confused. 'What the f*ck would they want with a
<br />plasterer?

<br /><br />As part of the negotiations, the British Government conceded that English spelling had some room for improvement and has accepted a 5-year phase-in plan that would become known as “Euro-English&quot;. 
<br /><br />In the first year, “s” will replace the soft “c&quot;. Sertainly, this will make the sivil servants jump with joy. 
<br /><br />The hard “c” will be dropped in favour of “k&quot;. This should klear up konfusion, and keyboards kan have one less letter. 
<br /><br />There will be growing publik enthusiasm in the sekond year when the troublesome “ph” will be replaced with “f&quot;. This will make words like fotograf 20% shorter. 
<br /><br />In the 3rd year, publik akseptanse of the new spelling kan be expekted to reach the stage where more komplikated changes are possible. 
<br /><br />Governments will enkourage the removal of double letters which have always ben a deterent to akurate speling. 
<br /><br />Also, al wil agre that the horibl mes of the silent “e” in the languag is disgrasful and it should go away. 
<br /><br />By the 4th yer people wil be reseptiv to steps such as replasing “th” with “z” and “w” with “v&quot;.

		<document id="2d99a074a0166bcdeb8f5ead7faff9e2" url=""><![CDATA[Sorry Santa<br/><br/>There are approximately two billion children (persons under 18) in the world. 
<br /><br />However, since Santa does not visit children of Muslim, Hindu, Jewish, or Buddhist (except maybe in Japan) religions, this reduces the workload for Christmas night to 15% of the total, or 378 million (according to the population reference bureau). 
<br /><br />At an average (census) rate of 3.5 children per household, that comes to 108 million homes, presuming there is at least one good child in each. 
<br /><br />Santa has about 31 hours of Christmas to work with, thanks to the different time zones and the rotation of the earth, assuming east to west (which seems logical). 
<br /><br />This works out to 967.7 visits per second. This is to say that for each Christian household with a good child, Santa has around 1/1000th of a second to park the sleigh, hop out, jump down the chimney, fill the stockings, distribute the remaining presents under the tree, eat whatever snacks have been left for him, get back up the chimney, jump into the sleigh and get onto the next house. 
<br /><br />Assuming that each of these 108 million stops is evenly distributed around the earth (which, of course, we know to be false, but will accept for the purposes of our calculations), we are not talking about 0.78 miles per household; a total trip of 75.5 million miles, not counting bathroom stops or breaks. 
<br /><br />This means Santa's sleigh is moving at 650 miles per second - 3,000 times the speed of sound. 
<br /><br />For purposes of comparison, the fastest man made vehicle, the Ulysses space probe, moves at a pokey 27.4 miles per second, and a conventional reindeer can run (at best) 15 miles per hour. 
<br /><br />The payload of the sleigh adds another interesting element. Assuming that each child gets nothing more than a medium sized LEGO set (two pounds), the sleigh is carrying over 500 thousand tons, not counting Santa himself. 
<br /><br />On land, a conventional reindeer can pull no more than 300 pounds. Even granting that flying reindeer can pull 10 times the normal amount, the job can't be done with eight or even nine of them -Santa would need 360,000 of them. 
<br /><br />This increases the payload, not counting the weight of the sleigh, another 54,000 tons, or roughly seven times the weight of the Queen Elizabeth (the ship, not the monarch). 
<br /><br />A mass of nearly 600,000 tons traveling at 650 miles per second creates enormous air resistance - this would heat up the reindeer in the same fashion as a spacecraft re-entering the earth's atmosphere. 
<br /><br />The lead pair of reindeer would absorb 14.3 quintillion joules of energy per second each. In short, they would burst into flames almost instantaneously, exposing the reindeer behind them and creating deafening sonic booms in their wake. 
<br /><br />The entire reindeer team would be vaporized within 4.26 thousandths of a second, or right about the time Santa reaches the fifth house on his trip. 
<br /><br />Not that it matters, however, since Santa, as a result of accelerating from a dead stop to 650 m.p.s. in .001 seconds, would be subjected to acceleration forces of 17,000 g's. 
<br /><br />A 250 pound Santa (which seems ludicrously slim considering all the high calorie snacks he must have consumed over the years) would be pinned to the back of the sleigh by 4,315,015 pounds of force, instantly crushing his bones and organs and reducing him to a quivering blob of pink goo. 
<br /><br />Therefore, if Santa did exist, he's dead now. MERRY CHISTMAS!!!

<br /><br />One night a man had a dream. He dreamed 
<br />he was walking along the beach with the LORD.
<br /><br />Across the sky flashed scenes from his life.
<br />For each scene he noticed two sets of
<br />footprints in the sand: one belonging
<br />to him, and the other to the LORD.
<br /><br />When the last scene of his life flashed before him,
<br />he looked back at the footprints in the sand.
<br /><br />He noticed that many times along the path of
<br />his life there was only one set of footprints.
<br /><br />He also noticed that it happened at the very
<br />lowest and saddest times in his life.
<br /><br />This really bothered him and he
<br />questioned the LORD about it:
<br /><br />&quot;LORD, you said that once I decided to follow
<br />you, you'd walk with me all the way.
<br />But I have noticed that during the most
<br />troublesome times in my life,
<br />there is only one set of footprints.
<br />I don't understand why when
<br />I needed you most you would leave me.&quot;
<br /><br />The LORD replied:
<br /><br />&quot;My son, my precious child,
<br />I love you and I would never leave you.
<br />During your times of trial and suffering,
<br />when you see only one set of footprints,
<br />it was then that I carried you.&quot;

<br /><br />I withdrew the cork from the first bottle, and poured the contents down the sink, with the exception of one glass, which I drank. I then extracted the cork from the second bottle, and I did likewise with it, with the exception of one glass, which I drank. I then withdrew the cork from the third bottle, and poured the whisky down the sink, which I drank. I pulled the cork from the fourth bottle, and poured the bottle down the glass, which I drank. I pulled the bottle from the cork of the next, and drank the sink out of it, and threw the rest down the glass. I pulled out the next glass, and poured the cork down the bottle. Then I corked the sink with the glass, bottled the drink and drank the pour.
<br /><br />When I had everything emptied, I steadied the house with one hand, counted theglasses, corks, bottles and sinks with the other, which were twenty-nine, and as the house came by, I counted them again, and finally had all the houses in one bottle, which I drank.
<br /><br />I am not under the affluence of incohol as some tinkle peep I am. I'm not half as thunk as you might drink. I fool so feelish, I don't who is me. And the drinker I stand here the longer I get.

<br /><br />A man  is getting into the shower just as his wife is finishing up her  shower, when the doorbell rings. 
<br /><br />The  wife quickly wraps herself in a towel and runs downstairs.  
<br /><br />When  she opens the door, there stands Bob, the next-door neighbour.  
<br /><br />Before  she says a word, Bob says, 'I'll give you $800 to drop that towel.'  
<br /><br />After  thinking for a moment, the woman drops her towel and stands naked in  front of Bob, after a few seconds, Bob hands her $800 and leaves.  
<br /><br />The  woman wraps back up in the towel and goes back upstairs.       
<br /><br />When  she gets to the bathroom, her husband asks, 'Who was that?'  
<br /><br />'It  was Bob the next door neighbour,' she  replies. 
<br /><br />'Great,'  the husband says, 'did he say anything about the $800 he owes me?'  
<br /><br />Moral  of the story:  
<br /><br />If  you share critical information pertaining to credit and risk with  your shareholders in time, you may be in a position to prevent  avoidable exposure.  
<br /><br />Lesson  2:  
<br /><br />A  priest offered a Nun a lift. 
<br /><br />She  got in and crossed her legs, forcing her gown to reveal a leg.  
<br /><br />The  priest nearly had an accident. 
<br /><br />After  controlling the car, he stealthily slid his hand up her leg.  
<br /><br />The  nun said, 'Father, remember Psalm 129?'  
<br /><br />The  priest removed his hand. But, changing gears, he let his hand slide  up her leg again. 
<br />The  nun once again said, 'Father, remember Psalm 129?'  
<br /><br />The  priest apologized 'Sorry sister but the flesh is weak.'  
<br /><br />Arriving  at the convent, the nun sighed heavily  
<br />and  went on her way. 
<br /><br />On  his arrival at the church, the priest rushed to look up Psalm 129.  It said, 'Go forth and seek, further up, you will find glory.'  
<br /><br />Moral  of the story:  
<br />If  you are not well informed in your job, you might miss a great  opportunity.  
<br /><br />Lesson  3:  
<br /><br />A  sales rep, an administration clerk, and the manager are walking to  lunch when they find an antique oil lamp.  
<br /><br />They  rub it and a Genie comes out. 
<br />The  Genie says, 'I'll give each of you just one wish.'  
<br />'Me  first! Me first!' says the admin clerk. 'I want to be in the  Bahamas,  driving a speedboat, without a care in the world.'  
<br />Puff!  She's gone. 
<br /><br />'Me  next! Me next!' says the sales rep. 'I want to be in Hawaii ,  relaxing on the beach with my personal masseuse, an endless supply  of Pina Coladas and the love of my life.'  
<br /><br />Puff!  He's gone. 
<br /><br />'OK,  you're up,' the Genie says to the manager.  
<br />The  manager says, 'I want those two back in the office after  
<br />lunch.'

<br />Always  let your boss have the first say.  
<br /><br />Lesson  4  
<br /><br />An  eagle was sitting on a tree resting, doing nothing.  
<br /><br />A  small rabbit saw the eagle and asked him, 'Can I also sit like you  and do nothing?' 
<br />The  eagle answered: 'Sure, why not.'  
<br /><br />So,  the rabbit sat on the ground below the eagle and rested. All of a  sudden, a fox appeared, jumped on the rabbit and ate it.  
<br /><br />Moral  of the story:  
<br />To  be sitting and doing nothing, you must be sitting very, very high  up.  
<br /><br />Lesson  5  
<br /><br />A  turkey was chatting with a bull. 
<br /><br />'I  would love to be able to get to the top of that tree' sighed the  turkey, 'but I haven't got the energy.'  
<br />'Well,  why don't you nibble on some of my droppings?' replied the bull.  They're packed with nutrients.' 
<br /><br />The  turkey pecked at a lump of dung, and found it actually gave him  enough strength to reach the lowest branch of the tree.  
<br /><br />The  next day, after eating some more dung, he reached the second branch.  
<br /><br />Finally  after a fourth night, the turkey was proudly perched at the top of  the tree. 
<br /><br />He  was promptly spotted by a farmer, who shot him out of the tree.  
<br /><br />Moral  of the story:  
<br />Bull  Shit might get you to the top, but it won't keep you  there..
<br /><br />Lesson  6  
<br /><br />A  little bird was flying south for the winter. It was so cold the bird  froze and fell to the ground into a large field.  
<br /><br />While  he was lying there, a cow came by and dropped some dung on him.  
<br /><br />As  the frozen bird lay there in the pile of cow dung, he began to  realize how warm he was. 
<br /><br />The  dung was actually thawing him out!  
<br /><br />He  lay there all warm and happy, and soon began to sing for joy.  
<br />A  passing cat heard the bird singing and came to  investigate. 
<br /><br />Following  the sound, the cat discovered the bird under the pile of cow dung,  and promptly dug him out and ate him.  
<br /><br />Morals  of the story:  
<br />(1)  Not everyone who shits on you is your enemy.  
<br /><br />(2)  Not everyone who gets you out of shit is your  
<br />    friend.
<br /><br />(3)  And when you're in deep shit, it's best to keep  
<br />    your mouth shut!

<br />At last a guy has taken the time to write this all down 
<br /><br />Finally , the guys' side of the story. 
<br />We always hear 
<br />' the rules'
<br />From the female side. 
<br /><br />Now here are the rules from the male side. 
<br /><br />These are our rules!
<br />Please note.. these are all numbered '1 ' 
<br />ON PURPOSE! 
<br /><br />1. Men are NOT mind readers.
<br /><br />1. Learn to work the toilet seat.
<br />You're a big girl. If it's up, put it down.
<br />We need it up, you need it down.
<br />You don't hear us complaining about you leaving it down.
<br /><br />1. Sunday sports It's like the full moon 
<br />or the changing of the tides..
<br />Let it be.
<br /><br />1. Crying is blackmail.
<br /><br />1. Ask for what you want. 
<br />Let us be clear on this one: 
<br />Subtle hints do not work!
<br />Strong hints do not work!
<br />Obvious hints do not work! 
<br />Just say it!
<br /><br />1. Yes and No are perfectly acceptable answers to almost every question.
<br /><br />1. Come to us with a problem only if you want help solving it. That's what we do.
<br />Sympathy is what your girlfriends are for.
<br /><br />1. Anything we said 6 months ago is inadmissible in an argument. 
<br />In fact, all comments become Null and void after 7 Days. 
<br /><br />1. If you think you're fat, you probably are.
<br />Don't ask us.
<br /><br />1. If something we said can be interpreted two ways and one of the ways makes you sad or angry, 
<br />we meant the other one 
<br /><br />1. You can either ask us to do something 
<br />Or tell us how you want it done 
<br />Not both.
<br />If you already know best how to do it, just do it yourself.
<br /><br />1. Whenever possible, Please say whatever you have to say during commercials.. 
<br /><br />1. Christopher Columbus did NOT need directions and neither do we.
<br /><br />1. ALL men see in only 16 colours, like Windows default settings.. 
<br />Peach, for example, is a fruit, not A colour. Pumpkin is also a fruit. 
<br />We have no idea what mauve is.
<br /><br />1. If it itches, it will be scratched. 
<br />We do that.
<br /><br />1. If we ask what is wrong and you say 'nothing,' We will act like nothing's wrong. 
<br />We know you are lying, but it is just not worth the hassle. 
<br /><br />1. If you ask a question you don't want an answer to, Expect an answer you don't want to hear. 
<br /><br />1. When we have to go somewhere, absolutely anything you wear is fine... Really . 
<br /><br />1. Don't ask us what we're thinking about unless you are prepared to discuss such topics as 
<br />FOOTBALL or CRICKET.
<br /><br />1. You have enough clothes. 
<br /><br />1. You have too many shoes.
<br /><br />1. I am in shape. Round IS a shape!
<br /><br />1. Thank you for reading this.
<br />Yes, I know, I have to sleep on the couch tonight;
<br /><br />But did you know men really don't mind that? It's like camping.
<br /><br />Pass this to as many men as you can -
<br />to give them a laugh. 
<br /><br />Pass this to as many women as you can - 
<br />to give them a bigger laugh.

<br />Oxford:
<br />Dear Mrs. Murray,
<br /><br />While we thank you for your valued custom and use of the Tesco Loyalty
<br />Card, the Manager of our store in Banbury is considering banning you
<br />and your family from shopping with us, unless your husband stops his antics.
<br />Below is a list of offences over the past few months all verified by our
<br />surveillance cameras.

<br />trolleys when they weren't looking.

<br />intervals.

<br />feminine products aisle.
<br /><br />4. July 19: Walked up to an employee and told her in an official tone,
<br />&quot;Code 3&quot; in house wares..... And watched what happened.
<br /><br />5. August 14: Moved a 'CAUTION - WET FLOOR' sign to a carpeted area.
<br /><br />6. September 15: Set up a tent in the outdoor clothing department and
<br />told shoppers he'd invite them in if they would bring sausages and a
<br />Calor gas stove.
<br /><br />7. September 23: When the Deputy Manager asked if she could help him,
<br />he began to cry and asked, &quot;Why can't you people just leave me alone?&quot;
<br /><br />8. October 4: Looked right into the security camera; used it as a
<br />mirror, picked his nose, and ate it.
<br /><br />9. November 10: While appearing to be choosing kitchen knives in the
<br />House wares aisle asked an assistant if he knew where the
<br />Antidepressants were.
<br /><br />10. December 3: Darted around the store suspiciously, loudly humming
<br />the &quot;Mission Impossible&quot; theme.
<br /><br />11. December 6: In the kitchenware aisle, practiced the &quot;Madonna look&quot;
<br />Using different size funnels.
<br /><br />12. December 18: Hid in a clothing rack and when people browsed, yelled
<br />&quot;PICK ME!&quot; &quot;PICK ME!&quot;
<br /><br />13. December 21: When an announcement came over the loud speaker,
<br />assumed the foetal position and screamed &quot;NO! NO! It's those voices
<br />again.&quot;
<br />And; last, but not least:
<br /><br />14. December 23: Went into a fitting room, shut the door, waited a
<br />while; then yelled, very loudly, &quot;There is no toilet paper in here.&quot;
<br />Yours sincerely
<br /><br />Charles Brown   (Store Manager)
