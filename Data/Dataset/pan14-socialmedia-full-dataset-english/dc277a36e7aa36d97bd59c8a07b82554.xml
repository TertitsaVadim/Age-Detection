<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5mbG93c3RyaXAuY28udWsv" target="_blank">Kapton tape</a> is a particularly resistant form of adhesive tape. The fact that it remains stable across a vast temperature range – from -273 to 400°C – makes it suitable for a number of unusual uses. It was used extensively during the Apollo Moon missions, with Neil Armstrong even mentioning it by name as the Lunar Ascent Module left the surface of the Moon on its return journey to Earth. In the form of tape, it has many more everyday uses where a thin but durable insulator is required. These include insulation on wiring and other conductive elements such as capacitors, transformers and coils. 
<br /><br />Anti slip tape has a backing of finely ground mineral particle aggregate. In layman’s terms, this means a rough surface which affords good traction to those stepping on it. It is perfect for use in both places where slipping in likely (e.g. on a flat stone floor which is liable to get wet) or where to slip would be particularly hazardous (e.g. in factories, laboratories or areas in which specialist equipment or materials are kept, and on stairs). In order to ensure your anti-slip adhesive tape is reliable, however, you have to make sure it is applied correctly.
<br />  <span class="textAlign textAlignCenter"> <img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/184690980_16640310_49783402.jpg" /></span>
<br /><br />With any form of adhesive tape – Kapton or anti-slip - you must make sure the surface to which you are applying it is dry and free of contaminants. Water or damp can break down the chemical adhesive and lead to your tape becoming loose. Contaminants can have a similarly dangerous effect. If, for example, you were to apply your adhesive tape to a particularly dusty floor, then the dangerous is that the tape adheres to the dirt and not the floor. Again, the risk of the tape coming free is increased.
<br /><br />Temperature can also affect the performance of some (non-Kapton) tapes; too hot and the adhesive may melt, too cold and it may be rendered inactive. The surface to which you are applying the adhesive tape should ideally be around 10°C. If you are applying the tape to stone, wood or some other porous material, then it may be worth using a special primer in order to increase the strength of the bond.
<br /><br />Remove the paper backer from the adhesive tape and press it against the surface. Continue to apply pressure along the length of the applied tape. This can be done easily by hand, though the use of a seam roller may help you get a more even spread and ensure that all areas are firmly pressed down.
<br /><br />Anti-slip tape comes in a range of colours, suitable for a variety of contexts. Black and white hazard line tapes are ideal for particularly hazardous areas, where it is important for an edge or potential danger to be highlighted. Plain black, white and yellow tapes are available for those contexts in which you wish people to remain safe, but do not want anything which looks too harsh.

<br /><br />What is Search Engine Optimisation?
<br /><br />You might well ask. Do you ever wonder why certain businesses appear higher up in search engine results than others? You might have some vague notion that it’s to do with visitor numbers and you’d be right, to an extent. But of course, that’s a self fulfilling prophecy. Those sites which rank most highly in Google are going to get more visitors than those which don’t. So Google has to look to other factors as well. Who’s interacting with this page? Which pages are linking to it? Who’s sharing what’s going on here? Is the website well constructed, well laid out and regularly updated? Does it have a lot of ads and is it trying to spam me?
<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5rcGliLmNvLnVrL3Nlby1zZWFyY2hlbmdpbmVvcHRpbWlzYXRpb24v" target="_blank">Search engine optimisation</a> is about presenting the best front to the search engines. Like putting on a clean, smart suit for a job interview. It doesn’t mean you know any more than you did, that you’re any better at selling cars or teaching people karate, but it shows confidence, an ability to meet the required standards and to present yourself well to others. Your website needs to be the online equivalent of a polite, helpful and confident young man. Not an over confident slob who doesn’t really care what his customers think because he already knows he’s a genius.
<br /><span class="textAlign textAlignCenter"><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/184690980_8563005_49803062.jpg" /></span>
<br /><br />So How Does SEO Work?
<br /><br />As we’ve already said, the search engines take a lot of different factors into account when calculating where sites should be placed in results for different searches. Search engine optimisation works to improve your site’s standing across a number of these different factors.
<br /><br />When Google was born in 1998 it worked by following the links between various sites. The theory – and it was a good theory – was that those sites which attracted the most links were the most authoritative. Their robots might not be able to tell which is the best recipe for chicken soup out there, but humans can. And humans are going to create links to that recipe so all their friends can join in the broth.
<br /><br />Links are still an important part of any SEO campaign, but the strategy has to be more considered. Time was, you or I could go out there, create a thousand links back to your site from some pretty rubbish websites and hey presto, we’re ranking. Nowadays, however, the reputations of the sites which are linking to you are just as important as your own. After all, it’s one thing getting 200 links from a backstreet website filled with ads for little blue pills and quite another to get a single link from BBC News. 
<br /><br />Search engine optimisation is increasingly a form of technical marketing and generating links from authoritative sites is an important part of what SEO agencies do.
<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5rcGliLmNvLnVr" target="_blank">KPI Business Services</a> are a reputable search engine optimisation agency.

<br /><br /><strong>Tyre Pressure Monitoring Sensors</strong>
<br />Tyre pressure monitoring sensors are a form of diagnostic equipment designed to monitor air pressure in pneumatic tyres.
<br /><br />They were first adopted by the European market, where they were used as a luxury, optional feature for vehicles in the 1980s. They were often used on high end, expensive cars such as the Porsche, but these days they are a crucial system for all vehicles.
<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3lvdW5nYXV0b21vdGl2ZWRpcmVjdC5jby51ay9pbmRleC5waHA/Y1BhdGg9OTQmYW1wO29zQ3NpZD1wMHNkZWEwdTJqNmVjMGVmaTdlY2hmcDhtMQ__" target="_blank">Tyre pressure sensors</a> are essential for both mechanics and vehicle owners. Each device is easy to use, and can quickly and accurately measure the air pressure in your tyres. Underinflated tyres cause cars to use more fuel and are the cause of many road accidents. Prevent this from happening and purchase the correct diagnostic equipment for your car.
<br /><br />Tyres senors with the correct air pressure last longer and have high quality stability, power, handling and braking efficiencies. This provides a safer, efficient and more enjoyable travelling experience for you and your passengers.
<br /><span class="textAlign textAlignCenter"><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/184690980_7913706_49803975.jpg" /></span>
<br /><br /><strong>Diagnostic Tools</strong>
<br />There are a wide range of tyre pressure systems available to suit your budget and vehicle requirements. The Eurodiag diagnostic tool is easy to use and gives a clear indication of the tyre’s needs and requirements. Through reacting with the power station involved in the function, the Eurodiag provides an accurate, reliable reading in a matter of seconds. Like many systems, it has a USB port, an ideal feature for connecting the device to a computer and printing out your diagnostic reports. The Eurodiag tyre pressure sensor can also be updated with the internet via an SD card.
<br /><br />Tyre pressure sensors work by using either a direct or indirect system. Direct systems connect with sensors located in the tyres. Indirect systems calculate the tyre pressure through measuring wheel speed and other vehicle sensors. Information collected by the tyre pressure sensor is transmitted to a processor which sends out a warning to the driver when tyre pressure is below the acceptable level. This is usually in the form of a red or amber light on the dashboard.
<br /><br />Under inflated tyres can cause many problems to the overall performance of your vehicle. This often leads to failed MOTs, meaning you have to fork out hundreds of pounds on repairs.
<br /><br />Nowadays, you can purchase compact, wireless tyre pressure monitoring systems for a small price. These include four sensors (one for each tyre) and one in-car display unit. Battery powered units last on average two years with typical usage. Certain devices also have extra features which measure tyre temperature, ideal for extra safety on long journeys.
<br /><br />It is estimated that around 25% of drivers are operating vehicles with under inflated tyres. Ensure you’re not one of them and stay safe on the road with tyre pressure monitoring sensors.

With many fun and exciting , <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5hdGVsaWVyZGVzY2hlZnMuY28udWsvZW4vY29va2luZy1jbGFzc2VzLw__" target="_blank">cooking classes in London</a> available during the school holidays, it is easier than ever to inspire your kids and get them eating a wider variety of foods.
<br /><br />Every parent wants the best for their child, but in a world of fast food and sugary snacks it can be difficult to get kids to eat healthily. New research suggests that there is a simple solution – getting them to cook.
<br />A recent study by City University London has shown cooking classes for children and adults encourage them to eat more fruit and vegetables. There is also evidence that teaching children to cook helps them identify and like a wider range of foods. Being open to new flavours means children are more willing to eat a varied diet, which we all know is the best kind.
<br /><span class="textAlign textAlignCenter"> <img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/184690980_12459654_49824237.jpg" /></span>
<br />While food technology lessons at school certainly help, a more fun and exciting way to get kids into cooking is to take them to a specialist cookery school in the heart of London. Many of these schools have classes specifically for kids, often held during the school holidays. The classes are run by professional chefs and the meals go far beyond rock cakes and pizza. Children can easily be taught to cook healthy, delicious foods that are full of flavour.  Examples of  dishes include ‘seared salmon with braised vegetables’ or ‘pear and chocolate crumble’.
<br /><br />Kids will have seen this sort of food on TV, but the children’s menus in a lot of restaurants are decidedly poor. Sausage, chips and beans just doesn’t cut it, and this is the sort of thing often served in school as well. Jamie Oliver is well known for trying to introduce healthier school dinners. If children and their parents can learn to cook healthy, exciting meals at home, there is less need to have school dinners in the first place. Eating leftovers from the previous evening’s well-cooked meal with some fruit can make for a healthy, inexpensive and tasty packed lunch.
<br /><br />Cooking workshops can also help kids make friends, and in interacting with the chefs they are meeting new adults. It is well known that learning outside the classroom can be more effective, simply because it is more memorable and more engaging than a day at school. Another great thing about these activities is that the kids can try to recreate the dishes at home, showing their parents how it’s done!
<br /><br />Simply being in a professional quality kitchen can be exciting. Most kids will never have seen the large, stainless steel surfaces and huge ovens, and there is nothing like watching a chef chop vegetables with such finesse. The whole experience can inspire children to want to cook more at home and improve their culinary skills.
<br /><br />If you’re wondering how to keep your children occupied during the next holidays, look for a cookery class. Not only does it give them something meaningful and fun to do, it can lead them to make healthier choices in the future.
<br /><br />L’atelier des Chefs offer a huge range of cooking classes for children and adults alike. Their London kitchens are state-of-the-art, and they have professional chefs to teach you the tricks of the trade.  Kids Can Cook! lessons last an hour, during which kids produce great quality dishes such as ‘chicken and mushroom en croute’ and ‘smoked paprika chicken with chorizo’.

Red mullet, sardines and sea bass are delicious and healthy alternatives to meat – perfect for al fresco meals with friends. And for dessert, what can be better than sweets made from succulent peaches or nectarines?

<br /><br />To get the best out of these ingredients you need fantastic recipes and the skills to execute them. This is especially important when hosting a dinner party, as all eyes will be on the food. To boost your confidence or simply to have fun cooking something new, cooking classes are a great way to spend an evening (or an afternoon!). Mediterranean classes are available in London throughout summer and are a great way to make new friends, as well as teaching you professional-quality recipes you can use again at home.
<br /><br />Pasta-making is an example of something you probably haven’t done before, but with a little guidance from a professional chef, it couldn’t be simpler. Italian style cooking is incredibly popular nowadays and attending a pasta making workshop is sure to make you seem like a culinary genius. When you’ve made your very own ravioli, tagliatelle or or linguini from scratch, you’ll wonder why you never tried it before.
<br /><br />There are a number of cookery schools in London, the best of which offer Mediterranean classes in addition to a host of other themes. Classes needn’t be expensive or take up a vast amount of time, either. Some are as short as half an hour, while more in depth sessions provide up to 4 hours of expert tuition. You’ll also have time afterwards to enjoy the meal you’ve created, perhaps with a well-deserved glass of wine. You will also be sent a copy of each recipe so you can recreate the menu at home.
<br /><br />Look for a Mediterranean class today and impress your friends with your new found culinary skills!

Find out how H4H works with other service charities to provide individual care for those wounded, injured and sick from service in the Armed Forces.
<br /><br />Help for Heroes is one of the UK’s most prominent service charities. The charity’s landmark achievement of raising £100 million in three years has changed the lives of thousands of men and women who were wounded, injured or taken sick in the line of duty. So far, they have created an £8.5 million rehabilitation complex at Headley Court, and are currently leading on the creation ofpersonnel recovery centres nationwide, to improve welfare and physical development as well as providing individual assistance to those in need. 
<br /><br />Help for Heroes is all about getting the best for our Armed Forces, and is proud to work together with other service charities to make sure this happens.  Thanks to the brilliant donations from the public, Help for Heroes is able to provide a £6 million Quick Reaction Fund, which is distributed through the services own charities including ABF The Soldiers’ Charity, and the Royal Navy and Royal Marines Charity.

<br /><br />For those who have suffered life changing injuries in service - and their families - the Quick Reaction Fund offers a chance to make day-to-day life that little bit easier with individual care and support. The application process is simple, involving direct communication, so support tailored to each individual can be provided quickly and with a minimum of fuss. Total funding of nearly £3 million has already helped change almost 1,500 lives. 
<br /><br />The money which Help for Heroes and service charities provide from the Quick Reaction Fund has eased mobility issues by paying for, or contributing towards, mobility equipment and necessary lifestyle adaptations, including car adaptations, wheelchairs, tarmac on drives for easier wheelchair access, handbikes and stair lifts. They have also helped provide gym memberships to aid recovery, prosthetic limbs, fitness equipment and canine partners. The Quick Reaction Fund, which was first created in April 2010, also aims to reduce the strain placed on service personnel’s families. It has previously provided funds for temporarily extending family members’ visas, paying for driving lessons for family members so they are able to drive their injured relative to medical appointments, and distance learning courses so family members can continue to support the family while taking on a carer role. 
<br /><br />ABF The Soldiers’ Charity was created in 1944, with the original name the Army Benevolent Fund. It has helped over 4,000 veterans, from every conflict since World War II, including operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. Help for Heroes has a long-term partnership with service charities like ABF The Soldiers’ charity, because they understand they are working towards a common goal. By teaming up with other service charities, Help for Heroes gives individuals the best chance of recovery, helping them to achieve the happy and fulfilling future which they deserve.
