Not only are Governments looking for ways to improve the security of their critical infrastructure systems, enterprises have become increasingly aware of the obvious real threat of data security breaches.<br /><br />The recently released MessageLabs Intelligence 2010 Annual Security report highlights the fact that the 2010 cyber security landscape was “shaped by the technological advances made in more sophisticated forms of malware as the cyber criminals continued to find new and innovative ways to attack computers and businesses”.<br />Addressing the risk of access to confidential data<br /><br />Research shows that attacks on thousands of business computers are becoming less frequent, with targeted attacks on a single company or even one individual, becoming increasingly common. All data is archived and stored in an encrypted format (using 448 Blowfish encryption) to prevent unauthorized access.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.greenvault.co.za"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.greenvault.co.za</a>
