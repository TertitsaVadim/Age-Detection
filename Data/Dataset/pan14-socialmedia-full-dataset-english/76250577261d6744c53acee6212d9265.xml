<br />Shootin BB's at old beer cans
<br />Chokin' on the smoke from a lucky strike
<br />somebody lifted off his old man
<br /><br />We were Football Flunkies
<br />Southern Rock Junkies
<br />Crankin' up the stereo's
<br />Singing Loud and Proud
<br />to &quot;Gimmie Three Steps&quot; &quot;Simple Man&quot; and &quot;Curtis Low&quot;
<br />We were big yuh know
<br /><br />Got some discount Knowledge at the Jr. Collage
<br />Where we majored in beer and girls
<br />It was all real funny 'til we ran out of money
<br />and they threw us out into the world
<br /><br />Yeah the kids that thought they'd run this town
<br />Ain't a runnin' much of anything
<br />Just lovin' and laughin' and bustin' our asses
<br />And we all call it all livin' the dream
<br /><br />These are my people
<br />This is where I come from
<br />Were givin' this life everything we got and then Some
<br />It ain't always pretty
<br />But its real
<br />It's the way we were made
<br />Wouldn't have it any other way
<br />These are my people
<br /><br />Well We take it all week on the chin with a grin
<br />'til we make it to a friday night
<br />And it's church league softball
<br />Holler about a bad call
<br />Preacher breaking up the fight
<br /><br />Then later on at the Green Light Tavern
<br />Well everybody is gathered as friends
<br />And the beers a pourin'
<br />'til Monday Mornin'
<br />And we start it all over again
<br /><br />These are my people
<br />This is where I come from
<br />Were givin' this life everything we got and then some
<br />It ain't always pretty
<br />but it's real
<br />It's the way we were made
<br />Wouldn't have it any other way
<br />These Are My People
<br /><br />We fall Down and We get up
<br />We walk proud and We talk tough
<br />We got heart and We got nerve
<br />Even If we are a bit disturbed
<br /><br />Woo Come on
<br /><br />These are my people
<br />This is where I come from
<br />Were givin' this life everything we got and then some
<br />It ain't always pretty
<br />but it's real

<br />From a lonely cold hotel room
<br />Just to hear her say I love you one more time
<br />And when he heard the sound
<br />Of the kids laughing in the background
<br />He had to wipe away a tear from his eye
<br />A little voice came on the phone
<br />And said &quot;Daddy when you coming home&quot;
<br />He said the first thing that came to his mind
<br /><br />I'm already there
<br />Take a look around
<br />I'm the sunshine in your hair
<br />I'm the shadow on the ground
<br />I'm the whisper in the wind
<br />I'm your imaginary friend
<br />And I know I'm in your prayers
<br />Oh I'm already there
<br /><br />She got back on the phone
<br />Said I really miss you darling
<br />Don't worry about the kids they'll be alright
<br />Wish I was in your arms
<br />Lying right there beside you
<br />But I know that I'll be in your dreams tonight
<br />And I'll gently kiss your lips
<br />Touch you with my fingertips
<br />So turn out the light and close your eyes
<br /><br />I'm already there
<br />Don't make a sound
<br />I'm the beat in your heart
<br />I'm the moonlight shining down
<br />I'm the whisper in the wind
<br />And I'll be there until the end
<br />Can you feel the love that we share
<br />Oh I'm already there
<br /><br />We may be a thousand miles apart
<br />But I'll be with you wherever you are
<br /><br />I'm already there
<br />Take a look around
<br />I'm the sunshine in your hair
<br />I'm the shadow on the ground
<br />I'm the whisper in the wind
<br />And I'll be there until the end
<br />Can you feel the love that we share
<br />Oh I'm already there
<br />Oh I'm already there

<br />Paintin’ waves as they danced, upon the sand
<br />With every stroke, he brought to life
<br />The deep blue of the ocean, against the mornin’ sky
<br />I asked him if he only painted ocean scenes
<br />He said for twenty dollars, I’ll paint you anything.
<br /><br />Well could you Paint Me A Birmingham
<br />Make it look just the way I planned
<br />A little house on the edge of town
<br />Porch goin’ all the way around
<br />Put her there in the front yard swing
<br />Cotton dress make it, early spring
<br />For awhile she’ll be, mine again
<br />If you can Paint Me A Birmingham.
<br /><br />He looked at me, with knowing eyes
<br />Then took a canvas from a bag there by his side
<br />Picked up a brush, and said to me
<br />Son just in this picture, would you like to me
<br />I said if there’s any way you can
<br />Could you paint me back into her arms again.
<br /><br />Paint Me A Birmingham
<br />Make it look just the way I planned
<br />A little house on the edge of town
<br />Porch goin’ all the way around
<br />Put her there in the front yard swing
<br />Cotton dress make it, early spring
<br />For awhile she’ll be, mine again
<br />If you can Paint Me A Birmingham.
<br /><br />Put her there in the front yard swing
<br />Cotton dress make it, early spring
<br />For awhile she’ll be, mine again
<br />If you can Paint Me A, Birmingham.

<br />With your hair falling down in your baby blues
<br />Standing there across the room
<br />I get so lost in the way you move
<br />It makes me reminisce, back two years ago
<br />On a night like this
<br />Teary-eyed, as you took my hand
<br />And I told you that I'd be your man
<br />So many things have come, so many things have gone
<br />One thing that's stayed the same is
<br />Our love still going strong
<br /><br />Baby just look at us, all this time and we're still in love
<br />Something like this just don't exist between a
<br />Backwoods boy and a fairytale princess
<br />People said it would never work out
<br />But living our dreams, we shattered all doubts
<br />It feels good to prove 'em wrong
<br />Just livin' our love song
<br /><br />Oh darling, would you look at me
<br />With my heart beatin' fast, and my shaky knees
<br />It's pretty hard to believe
<br />After all these years, I still need you this badly
<br />You're dancing in my arms
<br />With a spotlight moon and a sea of stars
<br />Oh girl we've come so far
<br />Everything I want is everything that you are
<br />Just wanna lay you down, say I love you
<br />Without a sound
<br />I think you know what I'm talkin' about
<br />Yeah
<br /><br />Baby just look at us, all this time and we're still in love
<br />Something like this just don't exist between a
<br />Backwoods boy and a fairytale princess
<br />People said it would never work out
<br />But living our dreams, we shattered all doubts
<br />It feels good to prove 'em wrong
<br />Just livin' our love song
<br /><br />Baby just look at us, all this time and we're still in love
<br />Something like this just don't exist between a
<br />Backwoods boy and a fairytale princess
<br />People said it would never work out
<br />But living our dreams, we shattered all doubts
<br />Don't it feel good to prove 'em wrong
<br />Just livin' our love song

<br />I say there's some things worth fighting for
<br />What about our freedom and this piece of ground?
<br />We didn't get to keep 'em by backing down
<br />They say we don't realize the mess we're getting in
<br />Before you start preaching
<br />Let me ask you this my friend
<br /><br />Have you forgotten how it felt that day
<br />To see your homeland under fire
<br />And her people blown away?
<br />Have you forgotten when those towers fell?
<br />We had neighbors still inside
<br />Going through a living hell
<br />And you say we shouldn't worry 'bout Bin Laden
<br />Have you forgotten?
<br /><br />They took all the footage off my T.V.
<br />Said it's too disturbing for you and me
<br />It'll just breed anger that's what the experts say
<br />If it was up to me I'd show it every day
<br />Some say this country's just out looking for a fight
<br />After 9/11 man I'd have to say that's right
<br /><br />Have you forgotten how it felt that day
<br />To see your homeland under fire
<br />And her people blown away?
<br />Have you forgotten when those towers fell?
<br />We had neighbors still inside
<br />Going through a living hell
<br />And you say we shouldn't worry 'bout Bin Laden
<br />Have you forgotten?
<br /><br />I've been there with the soldiers
<br />Who've gone away to war
<br />And you can bet they remember
<br />Just what they're fighting for
<br /><br />Have you forgotten all the people killed?
<br />Some went down like heroes in that Pennsylvania field
<br />Have you forgotten about our Pentagon?
<br />All the loved ones that we lost
<br />And those left to carry on
<br />Don't you tell me not to worry about Bin Laden
<br />Have you forgotten?
<br /><br />Have you forgotten?
<br />Have you forgotten?
