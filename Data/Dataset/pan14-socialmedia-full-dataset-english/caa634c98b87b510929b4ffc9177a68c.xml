If it is a boy child, then we prefer introducing him with the sports world. A very few of the parents think of the other extracurricular activities such as Karate. Many of the parents think that teaching karate to the kids will make them aggressive. However, it is just the opposite of what they think. Karate has many positive sides, and it is a wise idea to train the kids with karate skills.<br /><br />Karate is a form of martial art that evolved in the Ryukyu Islands which is now called Okinawa, Japan. The concept of karate came up partially from original fighting methods which called Te and from Chinese kenp. Karate is an outstanding art that involves punching, kicking, strikes of knee and elbow, and helpful techniques like knife-hands. Styles such as grappling, throws, restraints, locks, and vital point strikes are basically taught. One who practices karate is called a karateka.<br /><br />Karate helps to build self-control among the children. Most of the children are found to be lacking of self-control. Parents should provide those kids with the teaching of karate. With regular practice of karate, children can lessen their aggressive attitude. It also helps to enhance the level of concentration among children. The martial art, especially the style of Kyokushin karate helps to develop the co-ordination by the repetitive utilization of the motor skills of the body. It helps to increase strength, flexibility and balance in the body. Over all, the practice of karate trains life skills.<br /><br />This skill helps in the process of building blocks of good personality and leadership. Karate can be practiced by people of any age, but basically, it is good for kids, as this helps them to be able to learn the life skills early in their growth, and also taking on a strong manner of being energetic. It creates a well-built base for a cheerful healthy individual. Earlier, parents used to admit their kids in karate schools, but now even formal schools also provide their students with the facility of teaching karate. It helps the children to save time which they would have to spare if they would go to the karate schools after their formal school.<br /><br />If you are a parent and searching for any school that gives almost all types important facilities to the students including few advices to parents as well, then do not be worried. Onlineschooladmissions is a site that introduces you to numerous schools and helps you to find a perfect school that helps your children to learn co-curricular activities like Karate.

One of the issues that should be on the radar of your Karate Class or Dojo is the issue of child neglect by parents. This neglect does not refer to physical neglect such as food, clothing and shelter, but rather, emotional neglect.<br /><br />Emotional neglect can has many roots, but can lead to various symptoms later such as lack of cognitive ability, lack of social behaviour skills, lack of confidence etc. These symptoms can manifest separately, or one can cause the other and have a snowball effect.<br /><br />One of the key enablers of growing a successful student, is identifying these symptoms and addressing some of these roots. A point should be made at every Instructor's meeting, to discuss the behaviour, interaction and conduct of certain students within the class. You need to look at those that need to be lifted up, but also at those who need to get down to earth. Your training methods should be structured to address both scenarios with a tweak here and there as necessary to tip the scales. This mental reprogramming of a child takes quite a while, depending on the damage caused by a person, event, or a combination of the two.<br /><br />I have personally identified a trend in children that are dropped-off and collected after class vs. children that are brought to class with the parent/s or guardians sitting in on the class. In most cases, the children who are dropped-off, are those children that need boosting vs. those whose parents / guardians are part of the training experience, even by just being there. You do get those parents that are present at the class, but they are disconnected from what their child is doing, how he is performing because they are reading a magazine or something to pass the time. These are the boundary line children and you should consider &quot;working the audience&quot; when identifying that this is happening to a child. Engage with audience by saying, Hey parents, did you see that great stance&quot; or &quot;Hey Daniel's dad, did you teach him this or is he just that good!!&quot;<br /><br />The mission of your class or dojo needs to focussed on building people by what you do and how you do it. Character, sincerity, effort, etiquette, self-control and respect must be the foundation of learning at your dojo and be in the hearts and minds of your students.<br /><br />Teaching children martial arts is like nurturing a Bonsai tree (not to steal the fame from Mr Miagi), You cannot let it grow for 10 years and then try and shape it, it requires constant attention to detail, sometimes, detail you never knew was there.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy56b290b28uY29tL3Byb2ZpbGUvYW5ndXNtY2NhbGw0MTEvYmxvZy9lbnRyeS9tbWF0cmFpbmluZ2hvdXN0b24z" target="_blank">MMA Training Houston</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5zdXBlcm5vdmEuY29tL05lZWRoYW1MZG9hd3VjYXVuYS9ibG9nLzkwOTcwMQ__" target="_blank">Houston MMA</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2FuZ3VzbWNjYWxsNDExLmF1dGlzYWJsZS5jb20vNzY4MDk2NjYxL2hvdXN0b24tbW1hLw__" target="_blank">MMA Training Houston</a>

It is basically a fusion of both arts and was introduced to Japan only in 1921. During this period, Karate was simply known as &quot;Te&quot;, or hand, as called by the Okinawa's. Chinese influence is evident in the original symbol for Karate - the &quot;Tang Hand&quot; or ? Chinese Hand?.<br /><br />Japan began introducing Karate as a subject in schools before the Second World War and soldiers in the army were often trained in the discipline. Competitions and different styles also started emerging as several universities started karate Club programs during this period.<br /><br />Fundamentals of Karate:<br /><br />Karate mainly stresses on volatile combat techniques such as punching, kicking, knee and elbow strikes, and open hand methods.

By focus I am referring to focus of attention, taking instruction, listening to the teacher or put simply concentration. Learning judo, kung fu or karate for kids involves listening to the teacher, understanding the instruction and acting on it. Often this process involves a physical demonstration. Nothing spectacular in any of that but it can result in a concurrent improvement in focus at school.<br /><br />I remember one mother after a grading had finished remarking how well her daughter took instruction. I agreed with her but it turned out that her child had a form of dyslexia which was supposed to make taking instruction difficult. I was incredulous at the time, as the girl in question was one of the most dedicated kids, worked very hard at her training and as a result was one of the most talented kids in the class. I would never have guessed her condition.<br /><br />Other times I have parents telling me their kids grades have improved at school, partly, at least to the kids ability to focus improving. This is all very good but how does this happen?<br /><br />In many ways martial arts classes are an analogy for the big bad world. You get out what you put in, and this should be especially so for kids. Children will mess about given the chance, by balancing learning MA skills with fun games that are relevant to martial arts, the kids have fun and learn through play! This balance of learning and fun keeps kids on track AND focused!<br /><br />Focus in Kids Martial Arts Classes and School is Rewarded <br />In Martial Arts classes, as in school, children that pay attention are able to learn to a higher level than those that don't. In martial arts this is reward is manifested at gradings as the relatively higher skill level in comparison to less attentive kids is demonstrated and rewarded in the form of the highly desirable new coloured belt.<br /><br />At gradings we tend not to fail kids, rather we break belts or grades into quarters so the less able have a reasonable opportunity to progress. This enables a certain amount of leeway to reward those that put the effort in with higher (partial) grades than those that tend to cruise.<br /><br />There is a natural selection process here. If a kid puts the effort in, practices at home as well as in class it is reflected in their ability. It is very obvious to see. Of course the reverse is true; anyone coasting does not improve to the same level.<br /><br />By ensuring that focus in class is rewarded with praise and tangible reward, kids come round to the idea that it's a good idea to listen and act on instruction. Not rocket science but this occurs time and time again. Through positive peer 'pressure' in class to do the correct thing, focus, and with tangible rewards on offer kids get the message. This is reinforced through the sheer joy of learning a physical skill.<br /><br />The act of overcoming an obstacle that once seemed impossible, breeds confidence and supports the notion that focusing on the teachers advice is a good, helpful thing. Nowhere is this more so than in kids martial arts.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2FuZ3VzbWNjYWxsNDExLmppZ3N5LmNvbS9lbnRyaWVzL2dlbmVyYWwvTU1BLVRyYWluaW5nLUhvdXN0b24tNA__" target="_blank">Houston MMA</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wdXJldm9sdW1lLmNvbS9kZW9uY2xpZmZvcmQxMi9wb3N0cy8yNDU3ODA2L01NQStUcmFpbmluZytIb3VzdG9u" target="_blank">MMA Training Houston</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5kaXJlY3RvcmlzZS5jb20vbGlzdGluZy81NDg5MjgtSG91c3Rvbi1NTUEuaHRtbA__" target="_blank">MMA Training Houston</a>

While the confidence that comes from knowing that you can use self defense effectively is important, the true benefits of martial arts training, especially for kids, are much more than just building defensive skills. When taught by the right person, in the right environment, martial arts can be a powerful learning tool to build confidence, determination, focus, and physical fitness. <br /><br />We are all born different. Some kids are born bold and some with low self-esteem. Does your child struggle with confidence? Have your kids ever been bullied or pushed around or perhaps has your child has been the one who is bullying the other kids?

Additionally, martial arts contain the best elements of both team and individual activities since your child will have all of the social benefits of interacting with others while simultaneously being able to learn at their own individual pace. Martial arts are also an empowering way for families to bond. <br /><br />Originating in Asia, martial arts have a range styles and types including Karate, Jujitsu, Aikido, Taekwondo and Kung fu. With the right instructor any of these arts can teach a spectrum of mental, physical and social attributes. When your child learns these valuable life lessons and skills it will help them throughout their life and it will lay a foundation for happiness, fulfillment, and success. <br /><br />The mental benefits of martial arts for kids include increased learning skills, improved focus for kids and discipline for kids. The physical benefits include personal security and physical fitness for kids. And the social benefits include self esteem, respect, friendship and leadership for kids.

Although this self defense sort is very ancient, it is still intact to this day with the customs and techniques prospering here in 2011, while still blossoming and exploding with life (for the general self defense class they were playing rock music on the boombox, which is in all likelihood a new transformation since 1644.) Somehow it works, and its just subtle and not at all nettlesome. My concentration was unquestionably on the teacher, not the audio, but it lends a fun spirit to the lessons and it's just enjoyable to do things to music sometimes.<br /><br />Despite the fact that this shaolin style dates back officially to 1644 and the 1st in the Doo Wai lineage, you must also consider that in 1644 some of these disciplines were already 1000's of years old. Many of the sparring and sanative techniques that were incorporated in 1644 were probably created far earlier in Chinese boxing and healing arts. I think its hard to say how old many of the methods may be, or how old many of the herbal concentrates are as well.<br /><br />When people think of Kung Fu, they are generally thinking of Northern Shaolin style, with its long flowing graceful kicks, but Southern Shaolin Kung Fu looks more like boxing or Karate and isn't at all like what you see in the tv shows typically. White Tiger style is a no nonsense kung fu developed in the Southern Shaolin tradition.<br /><br />The land being hard In the colder northern regions of China, it provided a more stable footing when kicking and stepping, therefor, northern Shaolin styles developed more kicking, acrobatic strategies, while in the warmer southern climate of China, the dirt was not as hard which made kicking and stepping more arduous. As a result, the Southern shaolin style is more focused on higher stances with hand methods. More like boxing or Karate than what most people think of as &quot;kung fu&quot;.<br /><br />Of course, the subject being Shaolin Kung Fu, its not so simple to depict in short little pieces on the web, its a real world training to experience for yourself first hand. I always find language hopelessly limited to accurately portray things with such importance as Shaolin Kung FuShaolin Kung Fu .<br /><br />I don't think its really meant to be thoroughly described in an article on the web. Its an ancient partly oral tradition, partly an active fitness regimen that includes interesting ancient Chinese herbs. You must train on your own as well, to master anything in life, it takes dedication and it takes time. In this case, reading or writing short articles on the topic is never going to even begin to thoroughly describe a venture into the depths of Shaolin Kung Fu the way real first hand experience can.<br /><br />The traditional stories, the ancient wisdom, the accumulation of discoveries from thousands of years really is a very amazing and storied history, but the active fitness lifestyle that comes with Kung Fu training is a huge extra reward. Many people don't have time for fitness , but for those who do, martial arts training can be a very rewarding journey with many reinforcements besides just physical conditioning.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5kaXJlY3RvcmlzZS5jb20vbGlzdGluZy81NDkwNjEtY2xpY2staGVyZS5odG1s" target="_blank"> click here</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2NvbW11bml0eS5iYWJ5Y2VudGVyLmNvbS9qb3VybmFsL2d1dXNyZWVzMzI2LzYxOTUzMTkvaG91c3Rvbl9tbWE_" target="_blank"> click here</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2Rlb25jbGlmZm9yZDEyLmppZ3N5LmNvbS9lbnRyaWVzL2dlbmVyYWwvY2xpY2staGVyZS0z" target="_blank"> click here</a>
