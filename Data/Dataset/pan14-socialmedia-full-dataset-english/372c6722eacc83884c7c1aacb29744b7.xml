<br /><br />WpgCapper Re:
<br /><br />I really like your list. Like that you've mixed it up vs the consensus picks. ex/ i like that you don't have SF as a top 5 team which I agree with. I think they fall off a bit this year mainly bc i think the NFC west teams have improved a lot they won't have the same cupcake games they had last year so i like where you ranked them.
<br /><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/184602989_11583116_49833475.jpg" />
<br />What's your reasoning for having Pittsburgh so high? I feel they're due to fall behind baltimore and cinch this year.
<br /><br />Other teams I thought were odd.
<br /><br />Arizona - too low, they finish close to or at .500 this year
<br /><br />Minnesota - you have them just one back of tampa, seems disrespectful to tampa i think they have a good year. Minnesota is a bottom 4 team for sure.
<br /><br />St. Louis - too low, they finished last year with seemingly their entire team on IR. Theres a reason they were predicted to win the division last year. Fischer finds ways to win without star studded rosters.

<br /><br />slacker00  Re:
<br /><br />I agree with wpgcapper that the Rams and Cards are closer to 8-8 calibre than #29 and #31.
<br /><br />Otherwise, Detroit at #19 seems like an obvious mistake, they are easily in the top 10 ahead of Atlanta, NO, IMHO.
<br /><br />Another head scratcher is Buffalo at , I don't get that at all. They are just inside the bottom 10, best I can tell.

<br /><br />You honestly don't think Welker is a key part of that offense? His production is ridiculous. What about the year he got hurt, and there was no one on the roster who could fill his shoes? Welker is lightning quick laterally, and he can navigate the slot better than anyone else in the league. 
<br /><br />seaborneq  Re:
<br /><br />Welles is 31 and not a qb. He should beg the pats to give him one year deal the rest of his career. No way does he produce those numbers with any other team.

<br /><br />SparJMU Re:
<br /><br />Are all five starters on the 49ers offensive line returning? The reason why the 49ers won last year was their ability to control the line offensively and defensively. If they have the same personnel again this year I would expect the same results.

<br /><br />Bounce Re:
<br /><br />KG is actually 7' but he refused to be listed at 7' because he felt that 7' is a typical Center height so he feared that he might be playing C by coachs decision. This happened way back in Minn, and so they still put him at 6'11... and anyways like there's a big difference in 6'11 &amp; 7

<br /><br />As far as technicals go, I recall 2k saying something like they can't add technicals because it would entail mild violence, and therefore the game wouldn't get an &quot;E&quot; rating or something. Whatever. Ts would still be a good addition for the sake of realism. 
<br /><br />coolcras712 Re:
<br /><br />Technical fouls are not in the game because the NBA wont allow it not 2k, 2k would receive a fine and could face losing their ability to make a basketball game all together if they decided to not follow the NBA strict guide lines we all know EA would jump at the chance to buy exclusive right so 2k has to walk a fine line, anything considered negative is not all in the game that goes for Tattoos that are considered offensive as well.

It got me to wondering, what do you think are the worst calls ever by baseball umpires?

I'm sure the Jeffery Maher incident will come up too.

<br /><br />ThePundit  Re:
<br /><br />How about the ump in the '78 series NOT calling interference on Reggie Jackson when he stuck his butt out to stop a double play ball. The Yankees were down 2-1 in that series against LA and they were losing that game. The Yankees ended up winning that game in extra innings. That play spearheaded the comeback. So instead of being down 3 -1. It was 2-2. A huge difference. The Yankees probably don't win that series without that play.
<br /><br />desertrat  Re:
<br /><br />Last years call in the Angels-White Sox series also comes to mind. Strike 3, inning over, but the ump says the catcher didn't catch the ball. Instead of extra innings, Joe Crede comes up and hits a ball off the wall to bring in the winning run, who happened to be the guy that struck out. Angels had won game 1 of the series, this was game 2. Who knows what would have happened if Angels had pulled it out in extra innings? Momentum and home field for games 3 and 4 could have left the White Sox on the outside lookking in.

As has been the case with my other threads, I hope that we all can develop and learn more about the game of baseball and all of the infinte handicapping techniiques for this sport. I can't think of another sport that has so many different statistical results and subsequent and dependent rankings.

<br /><br />Bottom line is,and I have seen this, experienced this, there is absolutely NO WAY any scout can profject that a player under the age of 20 possesses all five of the scouting traits. That was the case with Billy and you can see throughout the movie how he thought back adn wondered what if I had gone to Stanford.
<br /><br />I do beleive baseball at all levels of play requires more team chemistry and managing and blending of personalities than in any other sport. It is far more subjective sport regarding how scouts look at ball players... There are 60-year dash times and pop-times, but there is also the unknown factor of how a young man handles failure. In no other sport are the best players failing 70% of the time, but in MLB the best hitters in the world do exactly that.

There will be six playoff teams, but only the Final 4 will get season points. The two division winners will get a first round bye with the second and third teams in each division facing each other, so the division winners are assured of being in Final 4. The playoff rounds will last one week each in Weeks 14-16. NFL Week 17 will be ignored. The Champion gets 1500 points, the Championship loser gets 500 points and the two semifinal losers each get their 250 points back. Additionally, beginning with Week 9, the high scorers for each week will get 100 points (with ties split evenly). Note that PickWinnersAllDay already has a spot reserved as he and I agreed that I hold on to the 200 points he sent for the first draft, which he was forced to back out off. The first 10 guys to send 250 via the &quot;Give Points&quot; button below will receive a PM with the draft info, as will PWAD when he sends the 50-point balance. Here are the rules, with the major changes from the first draft being the addition of a FLEX position and the addition of one point per reception.

<br /><br />Suns are my favorite team and its tough losing Nash (my favorite player).. It will affect the chemistry for sure but they can find it again. We all knew he would go anyways.
<br /><br />&amp;nbsp;
<br />Now they have big man backup for Gortat which is huge so they won't have to play that clown Robin Lopez very much.. Scola is real smart and a good passer so hopefully he can work well with Gortat.<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5zZXh5bGluZ2VyaWVuZXQuY29tL2NocmlzdG1hcy1jb3N0dW1lLWMtMTIuaHRtbA__" target="_blank"> christmas underwear</a> .

<br /><br />Nobody has any insight on this team? Haven't been mentioned on TV or anywhere... Its not like they were arguably the best in the West two years ago.
<br /><br />&amp;nbsp;
<br /><br />Speedy88 Re:
<br /><br />&amp;nbsp;
<br /><br />I think the Suns are headed in the right direction, but your delusional thinking they can make the playoffs. Dragic, Beasley and Scola are all nice pick ups, but I don't think they are ready to compete for the playoffs, especially out West.
<br /><br />&amp;nbsp;
<br /><br />I think we can all agree that the Thunder, Lakers, Spurs, Grizzlies, and Clippers should most likely all make the playoffs next year. That leaves three spots left between much better teams like the Nuggets, Jazz, Mavericks, and possibly the Rockets if they get Howard or Bynum. Don't forget the Warriors and T'Wolves.
<br /><br />&amp;nbsp;
<br /><br />To be quite honest, I put you guys only ahead of New Orleans, Sacramento, and Portland in the West. Warriors will be good this year if they can stay healthy. Minnesota is another team too watch out for. I think they would have made the playoffs last year if it weren't for all the injuries in the 2nd half of the season.<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5ld2hvbGVzYWxlY2Fwcy5jb20vQWRpZGFzLVVuZGVyd2Vhci1jODExLmh0bWw_" target="_blank">adidas underwear</a> .
<br /><br />&amp;nbsp;
<br /><br />Knicks should be good next year if everyone is healthy and if they bring back JR Smith...Too bad shumpert won't be there to play some D til later on in season.
<br /><br />Around 2-5 in the East is my expectation of them. IF they play well together, they could surprise some people.

<br /><br />Exactly. If it was rigged then this series would have gone down to the wire. Miami was just the dominate team, and only getting stronger.

<br /><br />When you go to the rally's and see Ron Paul has 10x the following of any other candidate and he wins every straw poll and says things that make the most sense yet the other guy with all the corporation bribes donations wins you know it's totally rigged. 
<br /><br />ChalkyDog Re:
<br /><br />You're partly correct. The thing you are missing, is that the term rigged is a serious misnomer. NBA games are rarely so heavy handed as to be rigged. Instead they are more massaged into helping one side. It is much much easier to do when the teams are so evenly matched.
<br /><br />That said, after game 2, Miami was insanely more dominant. To the point where finessing the outcome couldn't happen. Also, to that point, we must assume that the league wanted Miami to win. So, allowing them to take game 2, then game 3 - is reasonable, no &amp;amp;quot;rigging&amp;amp;quot; need be made. However, game 4 and 5 were so out of hand, the refs were never able to make a few crucial calls to swing the balance, and as a result - the series ended well before the ideal time.

<br /><br />Is it time to panic? I mean I keep hearing it's still early in the season. However, I see no reason for hope in the offense with Duncan, Santana (seems streaky) etc. Pitchers have been giving up a lot of runs recently no thanks to errors.

Yes, he didn't &amp;quot;participate&amp;quot; but the thought of bringing him over here was dumb. I can imagine some guy trying his but off for a job going at Kyrie given that he is a big name. Too big of an injury risk.
<br /><br />Waiters needs to take the ball to the rack. Someone must have told him he was a jump shooter. Bad Idea.
<br /><br />As for a positive Zeller looked really good. Summer league is far for perimeter oriented, so he really didn't get many looks, but for what he got he did well with.
<br /><br />Lastly, what the heck is Charlotte doing? Most teams are going straight man to get looks on new guys and evaluate talent. Charlotte is going full court man to man, 2-2-1 full court traps, matchup zones etc. They are making it harder on themselves and other teams to evaluate talent as that is not how the NBA game is. 
<br /><br />Pronkville  Re:
<br /><br />Waiters with a big shot to put them up and then had a brain fart and called a timeout when he didn't have one, however he didn't really have much of a choice anyway....
<br /><br />I agree, Charlotte was playing some hardcore serious defense, like going 100 mph on defense, hahahah.
<br /><br />mcm.1019 Re:
<br /><br />Charlotte appears to be pretty serious about the summer league...pretty much sent their entire roster to play. I've enjoyed watching some of these games and getting a look at the young guys. Liked what I saw from Zeller yesterday. Waiters didn't shoot it real well, but he was pretty aggressive at attacking. The refs called about 4 or 5 offensive fouls in that game that had me shaking my head...guess it's summer for them too.<img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/184602989_1762471_49843939.jpg" />

<br /><br />I'll pick Jamaal Tinsley of the Indiana Pacers. The other night he had a triple-double against the Washington Wizards including a whopping 23 assists.
<br /><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/184602989_1762471_49843939.jpg" />
<br />26 teams passed on him and I thought he might be kind of a bust because he couldn't hit an outside shot in college but he's really turned into a nice player. I know the Warriors were ready to take him with their 2nd round pick but had to settle on Gilbert Arenas. Tinsley reminds me a little bit of Mark Jackson. He isn't a very good shooter but he can post up. He can create for others. And he uses his body to get physical with other players. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5zZXh5bGluZ2VyaWVuZXQuY29tL3NleHktY29zdHVtZXMtYy0zLmh0bWw_" target="_blank">women costumes</a>  .

<br /><br />I'm picking Bobby Jackson of the Sacramento Kings. He's a great sparkplug off the bench. He's a great defending point guard which is rare for a point guard. And you can also run him at some two. He's a great contrast to Mike Bibby who's more of an offensive point guard. And for a little guy, he does another rare thing. He likes to get inside and mix it up with the big guys to get the rebound.
<br /><br />He's not a great decision maker on the fast break but that's his only weakness.

<br /><br />They had won 6 in a row themselves and were killing the opposition on the road.
<br /><br />And then they went into The Target Center and just got worked.
<br /><br />Flipside Re:
<br /><br />Yeah I saw that on the news. It must have been a great game. I wish I had gotten to see it on T.V. That was some fight.
<br /><br />I read that Kobe tried to take over the game when Shaq got ejected but Kobe kind of choked, hehe. Kobe missed a game-winner at the end of regulation, a free throw that would tied the game with 8 seconds left in overtime and a jumper that would have tied it with .5 seconds left in overtime.
<br /><br />And how about Shaq going after Brad Miller? I know if a big, big guy like Shaq was going after me and swinging at me, I'd be scared as heck. I'd run too like Miller. He'd probably give you brain damage or something if he connected with your head.
