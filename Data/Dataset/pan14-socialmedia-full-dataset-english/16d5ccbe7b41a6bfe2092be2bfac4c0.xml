Sure, we all want to be the hero (and maybe the villain every now and again), but do we have any characters which are really cyphers for our own personalities and beliefs? Let's take Mario as a easy example. He's as harmless as they come in terms of loved ones appeal, and while he does spend a lot of times eating mushrooms, leaves, flowers, along with other mostly organic foods, he's known to love a great spaghetti and meatballs when he's not saving the princess.

Somehow we've hit a point where Farmville is standing as a positive example of an animal-friendly globe whereas Call of Duty regularly has you snapping dogs' necks. Issues get even more complex if you're vegan, leaving you with pretty much Pong or maybe Nintendogs. And Tetris. Thankfully we usually have Tetris (that L block is completely vegan, as if it wasn't obvious).<br /><br />Surprisingly, most likely probably the most positive example of a game character living a vegetarian way of life is Super Meat Boy, a platformer regarded as &quot;Nintendo Hard&quot; by the very best gamers exactly where you run around as a chunk of meat trying to get his girlfriend back. Yes, you're playing as meat, but every thing is out to destroy you, leaving meat the pitiable victim of this harsh globe.<br /><br />Is that the very best we are able to do? A technicality?
