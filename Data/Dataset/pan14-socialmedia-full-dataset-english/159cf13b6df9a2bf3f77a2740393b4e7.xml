It is called the green roofing which is a relatively new approach. This so called green roofings are constructed on top of a roof deck as a vegetative covering.  There are some who refers to this type of roofing as the sky garden or ecoroof.
<br /><br />Its origin can be traced in Scandinavia where it is believed to have been around for centuries.  After that, the trend has continued with the Germans on installing this type of roofing and then it began to be implemented and installed on the global roofing system. 
<br /><br />What are the benefits of having a green roofs?
<br /><br />1. This type of roofing naturally filters the air.
<br /><br />2. They keep the house cooler during warm weather and warmer during winter.
<br /><br />3. They absorb up to 60% of storm water runoff.
<br /><br />4. They boost the life of the roof itself by protecting the waterproof membrane at its foundation from sunlight or puncture damage.
<br /><br />5. Green roofing augments the aesthetics of the rooftop.

<br /><br />3. You need root protection barrier if the weatherproof membrane has chemically organic material such as bitumen or asphalt.  Single ply membranes such as EPDM or butyl rubber are inorganic and do not need root protection barrier.
<br /><br />4. Increasing medium. A few inches of growing medium such as loamy soil is spread on top to allow water and some root penetration. 
<br /><br />5. The house where the green roofing system would be installed should be equipped with the support frame for green vegetation.   Consult with a structural engineer to help you out.
