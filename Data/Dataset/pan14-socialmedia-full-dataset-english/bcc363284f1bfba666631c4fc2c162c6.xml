<br />And I'll never forget
<br /><br />I'd do it again
<br />Without a single regret. 
<br /><br />The sky was dark
<br />The moon was high
<br /><br />We were all alone
<br />Just she and I. 
<br /><br />Her hair was soft
<br />Her eyes were blue
<br /><br />I knew just what
<br />She wanted to do. 
<br /><br />Her skin so soft
<br />Her legs so fine
<br /><br />I ran my fingers
<br />Down her spine. 
<br /><br />I didn't know how
<br />But I tried my best
<br /><br />I started by placing
<br />My hands on her breast. 
<br /><br />I remember my fear
<br />My fast beating heart
<br /><br />But slowly she spread
<br />Her legs apart. 
<br /><br />And when I did it
<br />I felt no shame
<br /><br />All at once
<br />The white stuff came. 
<br /><br />At last it's finished
<br />It's all over now
<br /><br />My first time ever
<br />At milking a cow...

<br /><br />A mechanic was removing the cylinder heads from the motor of a car when he spotted the famous heart surgeon in his shop, who was standing off to the side, waiting for the service manager to come to take a look at his car.
<br /><br />The mechanic shouted across the garage,&quot;Hello Doctor!! Please come over here for a minute.&quot;
<br /><br />The famous surgeon, a bit surprised, walked over to the mechanic.
<br /><br />The mechanic straightened up, wiped his hands on a rag and asked argumentatively, &quot;So doctor, look at this. I also open hearts, take valves out, grind 'em, put in new parts, and when I finish this will work as a new one. So how come you get the big money, when you and me is doing basically the same work? &quot;
<br /><br />The doctor leaned over and whispered to the mechanic.....
<br /><br />.
<br />.
<br />.
<br />.
<br />.
<br />.
<br /><br />He said: &quot;Try to do it when the engine is running&quot;.

<br /><br />He walks down to the store only to find it closed. So he goes into a nearby bar to use the vending machine. 
<br /><br />At the bar he sees a beautiful woman and starts talking to her.     
<br /><br />They have a couple of beers and one thing leads to another and they end up in her apartment.
<br /><br />After they've had their fun, he realizes its 3AM and says, &quot;Oh no, its so late, my wife's going to kill me. Have you got any talcum powder?&quot; 
<br /><br />She gives him some talcum powder, which he proceeds to rub on his hands and then he goes home. 
<br /><br />His wife is waiting for him in the doorway and she is pretty angry. &quot;Where the hell have you been?&quot; 
<br /><br />&quot;Well, honey, it's like this. I went to the store like you asked, but they were closed. So I went to the bar to use the vending machine. I saw this great looking girl there and we had a few drinks and one thing led to another and I ended up in bed with her.&quot; 
<br /><br />&quot;Oh yeah? Let me see your hands!&quot; She sees his hands are covered with powder and... &quot;You God damn liar!!! You were playing pool again!!!&quot;   
<br /><br />*********
<br /><br />Moral of the story : Always tell your wife the truth. She won't believe you anyway.
