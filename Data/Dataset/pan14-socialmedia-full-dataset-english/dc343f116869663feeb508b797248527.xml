<br /><br />today is my bestiest day ever..my classmates celebrated a birthday party for me..isn't it great??
<br />i was wonderful..
<br /><br />At first, ,i was doing my private homework my deskmate at the 2nd rest time rang when suddenly another friend switched off the light..first,i just paid no care for it,but then my deskmate said happy b'day..first,i still didn't realize anything when i asked innocently to my deskmate whose b'day it is..
<br />when she said it was my b'day,i was abruptly shocked plus happy indeed because it has becoming my wishes for several years ago when first i saw i of my friend was celebrated on her birthday too..
<br /><br />then..i was speechless,i just expressed my keen feeling by smiling and felt awkward while olivia brought the cake approaching me..nothin to say for a few second..
<br />after that i decided to join the clapping hands group and still sustain with the speechless gesture..
<br /><br />after that when the cake had arrived in front of me,i eventually could felt about their feeling of people who was be celebreated..like it was finally i could feel becoming important in this life and was surrounded by many many concern friends of mine..
<br />i just feel be blessed to enter this class..
<br /><br />lastly,i would not forget to thank ALL OF MY CLASSMATES whether they had participated in my b'day party or not..
<br />and i think for sure,i have changed my view of point about fenny since i had assumed her as a brutal person who like to bully somebody else and speak as she likes without crossing her mind..
<br /> and once again..thanks for erveryone,yet wish your wishes will come true as mine too

<br />first,we were served by adrianto standing on the 2nd floor while he was serving other customers with marker and asking his favour to write down our greeting for him at a piece of white plain t-shirt he was wearing in..
<br />Yet,it followed with photo session with him,like and actor,huh?!
<br />after that,we entered a small outdoor room without AC but natural air..from that,now we know our city,lovely Medan,is hotter,even at night without any sunlight..pathetic!!
<br />before we had our dinner,we did sing a 'HAPPY BIRTHDAY' song for him and wish him happy birthday..
<br />let's get back a little,when i entered that room,i saw a box of cake,quite small to be found at a party,and it shaped square with a bottle of beer on the top..of course it's made by cake too and probably,it's fake beer,just the shape
<br />let's continue,since the type of menu is buffet,i chose misop for my first menu,it followed with dessert,a bowl of es buah,slurpp!!,YUMMy
<br />it's not the end of my meal,i decided to take nasi bakar coz i of my friend,Widya,want to taste it so i agreed to share with her,but at last,there come 2 other friends joining us to eat nasi bakar..huh..pity of me..T_T
<br />but i don't mind with that,i took bubur sum2 to share with one of my friend,and know,we really did it,only both of us(stingy huh?!LOL)
<br />while we were eating,the MC started to play game..he set several games for us,fortunately,none of the game featuring me..lucky me^^
<br />dinner was done,we proceed our party by ourselves..we did capturing picture with golf park as the background(narcism mode on) because the party was held in the canteen of the golf field..so,cerainly,the location is quite narrow..
<br />Finally,we were done..party was reluctant by phto session featuring b'day host with his classmate..of course i didn't join them since i'm no longer his classmate..
<br />that's all,i took a ride on widya's car with her uncle as our driver that night,and i stop in at bunny's(veranita) house for around an hour to wait for my mom to fetch me..the reason why i didn't want to go home immediately is because i didn't bring any key with me,and my mom did..
<br />so that's why i had to wait for my mom to came back from a wedding party..
<br />lots of activity at saturday night,huh?!WAIT,announcement,my sister did go back to SG at that night too,probably would miss her...
<br />Lets just take a rest then....ZZzzzz..

<br />i just never thought i will have done a mayor election at the age of 17..wow
<br />a little bit sua pa kao,however,i'd lie to describe the conventional method of the elction..
<br /><br />first u arrive there,just put your eye on the people with green shirt,of course the civilian uniform..
<br />and i think for sure,without you ask anything to them,they will warmheartedly to introduce you with your number of place,for it simplest,'TPS 7'
<br />well,i myself didn't do anything..i let my mom to do it herself like registering our consent,and taking the election paper from the staff sitting on their their stand..
<br />then,my mom conducted me to go to a small suggesting place with boundary so that choosing our choice of the best upcoming mayor would be easier and pleasant without being afraid to be bully by other voter..well,i just followed mom's advice to vote for number 10 with Sofyan tan as the contestant..
<br />that's it..putting inside the small box is the end of the process before soaking or dipping your pinkie into a tea cup of ink..

<br /><br />i went out with my gals and one of my friend's bf..it past smoothly as usual,window shopping,eat at one of the cafe at paladium mall,reading freely at gramed,just as the other teenagers do,until my friend's bf who is also our driver to get there tried to do sth crazy on the way going home from sun.he stepped on the gas pedal on the way to drove the car down to the lowest ground then to the ticket payment..
<br />when we were about to drove out from the parking area and suddenly he decided to practice the 'roller coaster' that had been mention before..he had totally got on my nerve,i was about to stop him by not doing that but as i'd had predict,if s.o try to do that,then he would have gone crazier and it's proved because when everyone was screaming to cancel his idea,he really did it worse..i had had known that..honestly,i'm not afraid about the roller coaster idea,but one thing really get me mad is the idea to drag race in the public area with 'me' inside the car..i kept thinking what the first thing i would do if the car suddenly swung over and landed with the upside down position..the worst thing,i really forgot to pray,what a bad Buddhist!
<br />the other 'freak' thing,my best friend who is gf of that insane driver and my cousin,were really enjoying that crazy action..i just could get gloom in silent by glaring the stupider action they could enjoy..i just can't understand what they were thinking..they might have thought that it was the funniest,craziest and of course funkiest thing ever..really pathetic and misleading action...MORON!!!
<br />the thing that really keep my mind on it is when she asked me verbosely if i want to hang out with them again next time and i answer 'no',n i told her my reason,she got mad at me back..she then said to me if that's our last time hanging out together,i immediately feel pain,i have never imagined if she could say that word..perhaps she has changed a lot..i don no ,but few minutes after i arrived at home,i realize that she has changed much..she has become more arrogant,maybe because she has bf now and she has got prettier than before..i still don no what our relationship will be..i really hope she can change her arrogance and be friend with me again..i know she has lots of new friend and probably she won't need me anymore..really though and sucks..

<br />today i woke at 5.30,i started my day by listening to the BBC news from radio..well,after the news had finished,i preceed my sleeping hour for more than 2 hour sleep..actually,i want more,but unfortunately,my father really bothered me by waking me up with annoying reason.according to my father's plan,today is the day for washing AC.that's why i need to woke up early and by 11,the washingman was going to come.
<br />to be honest,today wake-up method is becoming the worst for this week since i am having my summer holiday.owing to that fact,i obviously may sleep later every morning.
<br /><br />just go to the next hour..
<br /><br />then i had made an appoinment with my friend,silvia to go to Arya Duta for participating in a seminar..
<br />2 hours before we met,she phoned me to say that she will bring her brother with her because she told me that his brother had been interested with this seminar..
<br />first,i thought it might be awkward with his elder brother who is about 10 years old older that me n my friend..
<br />but when i arrived there and meet him and after long conversation with the counsellor,i realised that his brother really help our way to have discussion..it was like having your parents there.he really know how to have a formal talk with somebody new.i am amazed.
<br />however,when suddenly my friend said she had to go because his brother's gf is asking for his favor to fetch her from somewhere else.so my friend said goodbye to me and there left me alone..
<br />in the beginning after she left me,nothing went wrong,i continue my consultaion but after i had finished up my problem with the counsellor,i found nowhere to go.from that on,i started to know that i was really alone.my mom could not fetch me from there before six.so i had to wait.at that moment,i was accompanied by my mobile phone n some short messages with my gals,vivian and bunny..
<br />in that conversation,i told vivian that i was in palladium then she gave me a very good news.she was going to come to palladium cz she wanted to visit gramedia..she is kinda nirdy too..haha..that's really fantastic..she really safe my day..
<br />at last,she accompanied me at gramedia till 7,and several minutes later,my mom came to fetch me..really thanks to vivian..
<br />but the time when i was in gramedia,i could feel the feeling of the overseas student..i did really feel lonely.i was like a foreign person(or alien)coming without knowing anyone..then from that,i could really know what a friend is really for..before today,i always try to avoid vivian,she is tremendously kind,but everyone think she is odd..that's the reason why i kept avoiding her..but if you are in an 'alien' places,no matter who they are,you will be so thankful to run into him/her again..that is the most precious thing i learn today..
<br />to be honest,nowadays,i have a lot of friends until i find out that i have become &quot;lagak&quot; in making friends..now i'm aware,i am not suppose to be in that way..i really have to appreciate this high school time because after this high school,i will never posses this moment with thousands of  friend anymore(exaggeration)^^..

<br /><br />today is the when my father arrived back at home for the reunion ceremony held in Penang..
<br />today,is also the first day of my ields course at VL after a long summer break..i am really dissapointed on the result i've gotten..i have been trying very222 hard for my writing while i was having my holiday..i spend the most of my holiday by just staying at home..well, i know,i'm not the only one who spend the long summer holiday alone at home.but i believe everyone are just spending their time by doing somekind of fun.some of them watching movies all the day.but not me.well i know most of the time i had i spended it for having fun either.however,everyday i keep on trying to spare some time by doing my assignment n doing my ields hmwrk.i know i myself asking for it from the teacher.but after i have done it most all of it,the teacher said this week he might not have that time to look at my hmwk..i know i have mess the thing up.i just hope he could be a little bit professional with his job as a teacher.perhaps i have to much demand toward him.but i just don't know why he really hates me.i keep thinking if i need to move out from that course.n now i think this is the time for me..i will move to cindy for joining the intensive class.i just run out of idea what he called my private with VL is.before i enter the ields class,either her mom or him keep saying that it's just gonna be 2 types of ields,one is the one-million first type of ields,the other is cost for 3millions..both types contain 2hrX20sessions only..what an extortion!!!GGRRRR
<br />i decided to take a try with it.it's quite nice at first because the teacher is miss i don know,yeahh,i mean she is more serious in teaching me ields rather than VL.i just figure out that every good thing just come out from their own mouth and from the other is the bad word only..
<br />i don know wat i'm feeling now.i wanna scream.i wanna cry.i just want to tell the truth to s.o trustable.i just can't stand anymoore..when i have a problem with the subject,i won't be hesitate to tell the teacher.with that miss,i got a good response and input,and that's what i expect.with VL,i am just like trapped in unconvenient place,i got nowhere to go.i always expect he could give me a good input like a suggestion from teacher to student.but it never happen.i've tried for a couple of time to tell them,and instead,i am hate by them all.now they seem not to give me a chance to get my score back.i know most people have ever said to me that the most difficult part for 4 of it(speaking,writing,listening,and reading)goes to writing.but he really never try to give me other subject exercises unless i ask him a couple of times.just to tired.i believe cindy won't do that to me.even during the english school test.she gave very very many material to her student to be used as the preparation for the school test.
<br />am i being to sensitive or wat because my sister also used to studying at VL???

<br />hmm..today seems to be a normal day..well,for everyone,it is,but not for me..there's sth annoying me..i don't know..perhaps it's just a conflict from my own brain..don't get it to clear..it's about friendship..i start to ask the real meaning about friendship..now,i am in  the 3rd year of senior high,i saw 1 of my friend,stephanie.she has lots of friend,including me.well,of course because she is charming,she has so amusing character..i thought i could be one of her best friend..maybe i am one,but..i'm just not being so close with her..she seems to has her own world..i've been asking about it from her.noq,when i see her relationship with her best friend,i realise that all of her friend is the real firend.they could stick up for each other.but me,i don't know hw my friend ever do that to me.even now i'm havin a conflict with my cousin..i just felt that she is trying to rob my friend.as i see from the stephanie's cast,a true friend will not throw away their old friend,instead,they will raise their friend,hand in hand,and of course they would share everything with them..so to compare with my case,they seem always throwing me away,treating me as i'm their most wanted enemy..i just want to find the real and true friend.i know i used to treating them the same way like forgetting old friend and look for the new one..i'm just looking for the real friendship..n base on evidence,i thing the real friend i have goes to sylvia..she is genuinely real.i have ever throw her.but now i realise,she is the one who could stick up for me..well,i hope so..i hope buddha will always guide me to be patient and hope his taught may bring wisdom to me to differ good friend or the bad one..

<br /><br />i was shocked about my mom's opinion about my problem..just about 3 hours ago,i'd just got terrible feeling..i'm afraid if i couldn't pass the ields test..i told my mom about it because i know i couldn't bear it anymore..my mom told me that it would not be a big problem,&quot;if you cannot now,you may learn harder..don be too serious about it&quot;.i know..but maybe i have kinda narrow minded person..i didn't want to listen to my mom's advice.i was quiet depressed.i kept on frowning all the dinner's time until my dad joined the meal.when my dad asked me sth,i answered him rudely.it might be so impolite,but i just paid no care about it since i was still controlled by my bad mood.then,my dad started again with his usual critical behaviour.he told my mom sth about me that i do not understand,but i thing for sure,it was not a good critic.then the horrible moment started.my mom start to say to my dad about my problem and she said,&quot;this kid is so serious in dealing with a problem.if you don't understand,just keep pn studying..you must be afraid about spending a lot of money about your private tuition,don't you??&quot;last sentence sounded like mocks to me.at that moment,i started to feel very ruined up.i don't know what to say.i couldn't hold my tears not to dropping out from my eyes.1 dropped suddenly felt.i still could concealed it by quickly swapping it away while my parents didn't pay attention to me.then,the mocks continued.my dad and my mom started to compare my serious behaviour with my other cousins.they must have probably know that i'm quite different from them.i am a shy girl,though,i kept denying it.but i know i am.i always try to change my bad behaviour by keep on trying to find a friend that is hyperactive so that i might be influenced by them and i could be like them.but i was trapped.i am closed with my cousin.she is so active.but..she is so wicked.i'm struggled to keep this relation with her.everytime i have a new friend,she would come,trying to be closed and then robbed my friend away from me.well,she does have capital for it.she is charming.everybody likes her.she has a good looking.she is so cheerful.but i think that everything i have,she will always trying to take it away.i probably feel sad.but i do believe that wheel will always turn up and down.sometimes,i believe i could have a better life than i expect..GUESS WHAT SHERLY,YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE SO STRESS IN ORDER TO FULFILL YOUR DUTY AS A STUDENT.JUST LET IT FLOW.YOU DON'T HAVE TO FILTER ALL THE WATER IN A STREAM.IT WILL BE FILTERED NATURALLY AS LONG AS HUMAN DIDNT DO LITTERING IN IT.SO,JUST GET RELAX..EVERYTHING WILL BE LIKE WHAT YOU WANT AS LONG AS YOU KEEP ON DOING GOOD DEEDS AND BE HARDWORKING,STILL BY ENJOYING YOUR DAY.IF SHE(COUSIN)WANT TO TAKE OVER YOUR RANK,YOU SHOULD JUST LET HER DO THAT.IT WON'T LOSS YOU ANYTHING.NO MATTER WHAT YOUR PARENTS WILL SAY LATER,JUST MAINTAIN YOUR ENJOYMENT IN LIFE..ALWAYS CHEER UP.
<br />WELL,I THINK IN THIS CASE,I SHOULD THANK MY MOM TO REALISING ME TO BE MORE OPEN-MINDED (BEFORE,I HAD ALWAYS GOT STUCK IN MY TARGET ABOUT SCHOLARSHIP AND TUITON GRANT AND POLYTECHNIC THINGS..BUT NOW I REALISE,I DON'T HAVE TO PUSH IT TOO HARD.OCCASIONNALY,THIS THING IS REALLY QUITE CLOSE TO 'LUCK'.IF LUCK ISN'T IN YOUR POSITION,YOU MIGHT BE VERY VERY STRESS IF YOUR DESIRE COULD NOT BE ACCOMPLISHED.SO JUST TAKE IT EASY.LUCK ALSO PLAYS IMPORTANT ROLE IN THIS LIFE CIRCULATION.)TOWARD THIS BEAUTIFUL LIFE.LIFE IS NOT JUST ABOUT ENVIOUS,RANK,OR COMPLIMENT,BUT IT IS MUCH BETTER IF YOU COULD CHEER SOMEBODY UP ALTHOUGH YOU YOURSELF HAVE SMALL PROBLEM..BY SEEING SOMEBODY'S SMILE,YOUR PROBLEM WILL SPONTANEOUSLY GO DISSAPEAR.BUT STILL 1 THING TO REMEMBER,DON'T BE TOO SERIOUS ABOUT IT.LET IT GO IN ITS ORDER.DON'T PUSH IT HARDLY..^^

<br />today was really a big disaster to me..but i don't have anyone to get blame..
<br />okey..today is the first day of my 3rd-year test and it wasn't the real problem,i mean,not even a problem for me..
<br />Everything seems to be normal,like the usual day for test.my friend,bunny,sometimes will offer me to drive me home,well,kinda bless for me.she's pretty kind.but catastrophe immediately happen when i still remember,it began with my sudden changing mood when i forced my cousin,kartini to take a seat inside the trishaw while i prefer to sit near the doorwayout.she was really mad about it.well,i know,if i saw somebody was mad at me,i would probably be influenced by them too although i know it doesn't even worthed.but i've tried to control my mood.reluctantly,i brought that bad mood until the accounting class.i pretend to be sleepy to conceal my madness but actually,i did being sleepy too..until bambang,i of my fellow at course,started to talk about prison break.that is one of my favourite movie series ever be watched.and while that moment,the rain started to wash away my anger.i'm feelin better with rain,sometimes.well,what i didn't realise is the rain was overwealming the road outside,causing terrible flood all over my city and of course the traffic was going crazy at that time.after finishin the course that day,we were all planning to go to my house to continue the study but at last,the plan had been rejected because i angeline decided to go home alone by pedicab and vivi was feelin sorry and choose to accompany her.that's really what a real friend suppose to do.and then,after waiting for a while,everyone had had their own ride.i was just too sure not to go home with vivian.i was thinking if i could go home by pedicab alone since i do believe if my cousin would not asked her parents to fetch us,knowin tat her parents were just to lazy to did the driver's job.finally,we took a ride with Bambang,he was pretty kind.he agreed to take us to Asia but not to Percut(my own residence)for the reason that the car was just too small and compact to survive itself from the heavy rain with water sorrouding it.and then,i agreed to go to cousin's house with her without considering the further result i would obtain.i just couldn't survive at there until the twilight time because the whole family was  migratin to grand polonia,the house they had been living at for  practically 1 year.they finally drove me to Uyen Ai house as it's the nearest place they could reach in the rainy lot(at uyen ai house,the host invited me in and treat me with a plate of gado2 with a glass of jali2,really a tremendous different treatment by 2 different family,what a pathetic but i'm just so thankful bout it.).in that car,there was totally too much conflict i would like to write in this blog.in that car,i could see a family which has been devided into 2 blocks.one is the adolf hitler block(kartini n daddy),the other is the cinderella's(iis and mommy).daddy likes to compare his wife like his daughter,and mommy would argue for her son.wat a mess..and at that moment,i'm sure that i was in the wrong family's car.well,i was standing alone.parents there would keep on blaming my parents for not being care about me.the person playing the role as 'daddy' keep blaming my parents(either my mom n my dad) whilst the 'mommy keep on saying the bad side about my dad.kinda of frustrating to realise that.no wonder my cousin(kartini)is being so adolf hitler too more like daddy.of course she won't realise if his daddy is so annoying as she has already been living in that environment,the environment of hating someone.i have never heard any compliment from her and i'm confident that that behaviour is certainly descended by both people raising her up.but i also wanted to stress up that there is no reason to blame parent about what we are now.it's certainly about what you want to be.somtimes i felt like i really need get rid myself from her but in other situation,when she could really express her gratitude to s.o she considered deserved for it,i might actually like her.i really hate her when she was trying to get the advantage of s.o n always pretend to don't know about s.o's feeling and being no care bout it.she's just sooo like her dad and i hate it.sometimes,i feel that i'm influenced by her bad behaviour to take the advantage of s.o..this is really so complicated.i know life isn't just about mathematics that can be solved just if you know the formula,its is ssoooo muccchhh morrree complicated then that.

<br />yesterday was really a magnificent day..i really enjoy it.it was the day i had barbecue with my classmates.frineds joining that barbecue party are around 19 people and we held it at 1 of my friend's house,theresia(usually we called her there just to shorten) at balige.it's pretty close to my house so i didn't get any problem with the transportation.besides,yesterday was also the day my mum had been going to jakarta,don't really understand the major point,but i guess,perhaps it's becaused of my uncle whom i predict if he had been in a custody.but i'm not sure about that yet since my mum prefer to keep it in secret and pretending if there's nothin happening.
<br />let's get back to the barbecue session..i went there with my cousin,kartini.but unfortunately,she couldn't adjust herself with her new friends.again,lots of my friend seems not to like her so much because,yeahh i know,because she is quite arrogant and shy to speak with her own character.again,there's also 1 of her serious enemy,Monika.maybe that's also the factor why she's so quite at there,because most all the friends come in there are so monika's friend,including me.
<br />MOve on,i was very glad because i felt i was accepted in there.well,perhaps it's not just my feelin,but it's proved when first i met them all at the 2nd floor of the house.they all really welcoming me with small joke,telling me that i should not help them in preparing the equipment n food for bbq.really full impression first step.well,of course finally they accepted me into the 'cooking group' by my perforce..haha..
<br />as the time goes by,we encountered some problem.one of my friend started to get stress and furious because the food is too many.again,it followed by another small conflict when my friend(AH) admonish there(the host)because he thought that there was to rude when she talked to her grandma.well,as everybody knows,grandma n grandpa often talked again n again as they were already old and their memory get weaker.her grandma asked there to ask our phone number since we all are already in 3rd year of senior high.it means we're going to seperate very very soon,how intensing is that huh??
<br />go on,then There is a typical of a sensitive young woman,so she immediately fell into tears and she admited that she was embarassed to us because of her grandma.she just afraid if her grandma will just bother us.but,well,AH had said about the pleasant of There's grandma and i believed his word delegating ours toward her grandma and it means,problem solved!!
<br />then,we ultimately jumped to the main course.bbq n sangwo session.wat a greedy huh??!with both??haha..that's why..
<br /><br />just to conclude,i really enjoyed the togetherness,when my friends n i did everything in mutual assistance.we stretch the chicken meat,slice the veggie and tofu,break the the corn,eat martabak for break time before continue the kitchen job,slice the O lengkong,pin the sate and seasoning the 'kebab',pass the food to the 5th floor since the session would be held up there,sing together while eating,pretend to have a competition between 2 hawker(the sangwo and the keba<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/4210//smilies/cool.gif" alt=":)" />,sleep together(of course boys and girls must be seperated),caught flu together(exactly as the result of the cold night weather plus the share of all eating equipment n of course,saliva..eeww!!)..well,actually,we have to thank the whether a lot because the downpour didn't come..
<br />i'm so happy about the bbq and they all also comment that ystrdy bbq was completely success and they enjoyed much more than the previous bbq still with the same member but without me..haha..
